It is not quite technically correct for the G. of I. to give notice of the exercise by the King of a right 'in respect of India' (because the G. of I. can now only speak for British India). But as the k L*- *■»-«■«•» 4 M SlAft/LZi £%»*+*•+*£*** y / Convention was signed for 'India' this cannot be helped The subjects of Indian States are, as a matter of fact, covered by the notice already given and the accompanying memorandum, and there seems nn harm in the G. of I. purporting to give it again.

(J 5V4/27/16) Dear Gibson, Many thanks for your letter No. P. Z. 841/38 of the 14th February regarding the ratification of the Montreux Convention. As regards the formal notification on behalf of India we think that the text of Kelly 1 s note No. 295 of the 12th October last (please see our official letter j 4447/13 /16 of the 1st November) would be appropriate, subject to the addition at the beginning of the words 'At the instance of the Government of India” and of the words ”in respect of India” at the end of The King s title. The notification covers jurisdiction in respect of British protected persons as set out in the explanatory memorandum which accompanied the United Kingdom notification, but it is not suggested or intended that this explanatory memorandum should be communicated 9 FEB 1938 J.P.

Mr. Eden concurs in the view expressed in paragraph 2 of Sir Miles Lampson’s despatch, that only Moslems were, under the Capitulatory regime, habitually referred by the Consular Court to the Religious Court, and that, therefore, it is only to Moslems that the word 'continueront”, in Article 25 of the R4glement d'Organisation Judiciaire, can properly be applied in the case of British subjects. 3. Mr. Eden is not however in entire agreement with the view set out in paragraph 3. Article 9 of the Hontre Convention provides that any of the High Contracting Parties who possessed, at the time when that Treaty was concluded, consular I. P9L s»-VT.; The Under-Secretary of State, IfNDlA OFFICEi g. o; poi^' c -\ nf \ of OR*- 1 * iflW 8 , T India office.courts in Egypt might retain such courts for the purposes of jurisdiction in matters of personal status in all cases in which the law applicable was the national law of the High Contracting Party concerned. Further any such High Contracting Party who desires to exercise such right must notify the Egyptian Oovernment to this effect at the time of the deposit of his instrument of ratification. His Majesty^ Government’s interpretation of this provision has been that, as a result of the notification made under paragraph 2 of Article 9 in connexion with the ratification in respect of the United Kingdom, any case in which the law applicable is determined by reference to a person who is a British subject or a British protected person^ falls within the jurisdiction of Kis Majesty’s consular court on the grounds that all British subjects or British protected persons are, even though some of them might also be nationals of India or of a Dominion, nationals of The King in respect of the United Kingdom; it has been held therefore that all these cases are covered whether any notification were made in connexion with the Indian or Dominion ratifications or not. This view may still be m principle maintainable, though admittedly it may not be easy to show that, in the terms of Article 9, the national law of, say, Australia is the national law of His Majesty’s Government in respect of the United Kingdom, 4, The Egyptian Government are now in effect denying the validity of this interpretation and are maintaining that cases where the national law applicable is, say, Australian law, are not reserved unless His Majesty mantes a notificatio under paragraph 2 of Article 9 when depositing his Australi ratification. The Egyptian Government do not apparently contestcontest that if such notification is made in connexion with the Australian ratification the reservation will not he validly made on the ground that the Australian Government had no consular court in Egypt before the war. They are apparently prepared to admit that His Britannic Majesty's Supreme Court for Egypt must be regarded as having been a court maintained by and in respect of the whole Empire* 5. In Mr. Eden’s view the Egyptian Government are unlikely to he convinced by any arguments in support of His Majesty* s Government* s interpretation and as they are by implication prepared to accept the existing consular court at Cairo as complying with the terms of paragraph 1 of Article 9 so far as the Government of India and His Majesty’s Governments in the Dominions are concerned, Mr. Eden considers that it might be advisable to fall in with their wishes in this respect* Accordingly, if the Government of India agrees, it is proposed that Sir Miles Lampson should be instructed at the time of deposit of the ratification of India to deliver to the Egyptian Government a notification on the same lines mutatis mutandis as those of the notification made in October last on behalf of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, a copy of which was enclosed in the Foreign Office letter under reference. 6* I am to suggest therefore, for the consideration of the Marquess of Zetland, that the Government of India should be invited by telegraoh to state whether they would agree to the Indian ratification being accompanied by a notification on the lines suggested above. 7* It is understood that copies of the telegrams addressed by the Dominions Office to the Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments on this subject have been sent to the India Office,(J 276/27/16) No*42. *“(165/1/38) BRITISH EMBASSY, CAIRO. 14th January, 1938. Sir, I have the honour to enclose a cony of a note No*38*106/2 (321) of 29th December, 1937, addressed to me by the then Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on December 29th (i.e. prior to the change of Government) in reply to the note and explanatory memorandum which I deposited on 12th October last as reported in my despatch No.1187 of 14th October. 2, The answer to the first point raised by Makram Ebeid Pasha appears to be that only Moslems were, under the capitulatory regime, habitually referred by the Consular Court to the Religious Court, and that, therefore, it is only to Moslems that the word 'continueront”, in Article 25 of the R&amp;glement d f Organisation Judiciaire, can properly be applied in the case of British subjects. 3* I am advised that Makram Pasha is correct in his observation that if the Dominions do not opt to retain statut personnel jurisdiction at the time when they deposit their ratification they will have to be added to the exceptions noted under paragraph (iii) of the explanatory memorandum above referred to* 4. Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., e tc., © tc., etc4. I am further advised that the position of Canada is peculiar. The enclosed note alleges that the letter of adhesion printed with the Montreux documents nrecludes her for exercising the option. X am advised, however, that on a reasonable interpretation, the right to opt is reserved un^er its second paragraph. The Canadian G-overnment could not have foreseen that the condition for claiming one of the rights sanctioned by the Convention would be that the claim should be made at the moment of deposit of ratifications. On this interpretation the only difficulty remaining is the question when Canada must exercise this right. This difficulty is, however, rather inconsistently, solved by Makram Pasha himself when he claims that the adhesion of Canada must be 'formalis£e' in accordance with Article 15 of the Convention, i.e. that Canada must ratify 5. I should be glad to learn whether you agree with the views in paragraphs 2 and 3 above and also when it is proposed to deposit ratifications of the Fontreux Convention on behalf of the Dominions, including Canada if it is held that ratification is necessary in her case.

(129/23/37) \ BRITISH EMBASSY, ROME. 22 nd November, 1937 Sir, a With reference to my despatch No. 939 of the 8 th November regarding the abolition of Capitulations in Egypt I have the honour to inform you that an announcement has appeared in the press to the effect that the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 18th November presented his report on the Decree Law bringing into force in Italy the International Agreement signed at Montreux on the 8 th May, 1937, for the abolition of Capitulations in Egypt. 2. According to the announcement, the Minister’s report records that the initiative for the convocation of the Montreux Conference was taken by the Egyptian State, 'vhich desired to eliminate a juridical system which constituted a limitation on its sovereignty no longer Justifiable by the internal conditions of the country. 3. In fact, as the report points out, Egypt recently modified her legislation and administration of Justice in a sense conforming to the principles valid in the European States, as a result of which she is in a position henceforth to grant to foreigners a guarantee of Juridical rights. 4. The Minister adds in his report that by the Convention the contracting parties declared their willingness to accept the complete abolition of Capitulations in Egypt in all respects. 5/ ght Honourable hony Eden, M.C., etc., etc., etc. Foreign Office.5. By virtue of the new Agreements, and subject to the reservations of the general principles of international law, foreigners in Egypt will be subject to Egyptian legislation in penal, civil, commercial, administrative, fiscal and other matters. It is understood that this legislation will not be incompatible with the principles generally adopted in modern legislation and will not amount, especially in fiscal matters, to discrimination to the detriment of foreigners. 6 . After having described the conditions of the Montreux Agreement, Count Ciano specifies that the position of Italian establishments actually existing in Egypt at the date of the signing of the Convention has been taken into special consideration by the Egyptian Government which has declared its willingness to grant to these establishments the right to continue to carry on freely their activities till the conclusion of an eventual Agreement between Italy and Egypt; and anyway until the end of the so-called period of transition. The establishments in question will be able to appeal to the Mixed Courts, and will be subject to the Egyptian laws and regulations including fiscal laws, in the same conditions as similar Egyptian establishments. They will preserve their legal identities and will be set up on the basis of their constitutional acts, they will be able without prejudice to the laws of expropriation to possess real and personal property necessary for the carrying out of their functions• 7. Finally, the Minister records that in another exchange of Notes it is declared that, pending an agreement between Italy and Egypt regulating the juridical position of Italians/Italians in Egypt and of Egyptians in Italy, the citizens of the two countries resident in the territory of the other shall have the right to acquire real and personal property by purchase, exchange, gift and succession; further, they will be able in conformity with local laws to carry on any kind of industrial or commercial activity including any kind of occupation or profession, the exercise of which is not reserved by the national laws to the citizens of the Egyptian State. These dispositions have been agreed upon on the basis of reciprocity. 8 . I have sent a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Representative in Cairo.

(b) Any authority given to, or any act or thing to be done by, to or for, any Appropriate British Authority may be exercised by, or done by, to or for, any other person for the time being authorised in that behalf according to the custom of the particular service of His Majesty concerned. Article 4. No member of the British Forces shall be subject to the criminal jurisdic tion of the Courts of Egypt, nor to the civil jurisdiction of those Courts in any matter arising out of his official duties. If any civil proceeding is instituted against a member of the British Forces before any Egyptian Court, notification of the proceedings shall be given to His Majesty’s Ambassador, and no further steps shall be taken until twenty-one days have elapsed from the date of notification. This period shall be extended if His Majesty’s Ambassador states that it has not been possible to conclude the necessary investigations in the above time. A statement to the Court by His Majesty’s Ambassador that the proceedings arise out of official duties will be considered as conclusive evidence of that fact.46 • o rie Article 13. / \ F^vDtian Government undertakes at the request of the (a) The Egypt a n reasonable steps to secure f (a\ The Egyptian Government unu C iu^ c = ox the ap pr( , &gt;1 Fri+kh authority to take all reasonable steps to secure the attend “w The Gove—of ^ memte'of forces'as a wtaess at any proceedings before the Egyptian Courts, indu^ Kd Courts court,— ^ the‘appropriate 1 official ^f^the 0 Ministry o?

The position is somewhat complicated as regards the persons whose cases will come before the Court and therefore His Majesty’s Embassy venture to set out the whole position in the hope that the Egyptian Government will take the necessary steps to see that the aforaatlon le made Known to all those authorities and ’ ersons who may he concerned. The British consular court retained in accordance ith the abovementioned notification will exercise urisdiction in all personal status cases %hert the person, ith reference to whom the national 1&amp;* e ascertained in accordance with the provisions of A !9 and 30 of the Annex to the Convention, is under •f the United Kingdom a British subject or a Briti irotected person, except in the following (1) the British consular court will not exerci _ Palestinian citizen or e jurisdiction where that person is i t hi a results from paragraph 3 o Transjordanian national; this Article 25 of the said Annex;* t O d i © (il) the British consular court will not exercise jurisdiction where that person is of the Moslem religion; this results from paragraph 4 of Article 25 of the said Annex; since British subjects and British protected persons of the Moslem religion alone had the right in the past to have recourse to Egyptian religious jurisdictions in matters of personal status, paragraph 5 of Article 25 of the said Annex applies to British subjects and British protected persons of the Moslem religion only; (ill) the British consular court will not exercise jurisdiction where, in accordance with Articles 29 and 30 of the said Mnex, the national law of the person concerned is, at the time of the institution of the proceedings, the law of the Union of South Africa or of the Irish Free State; the representative of the Irish Free State made, as the Egyptian Government will be aware, a declaration at the final plenary session of the Montreux Conference to the effect that his Government did not desire that there should be any reservation of consular Jurisdiction in matters of personal statu Irish Free State citizens; His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom are given to understand that the wishes His Majesty's Government in the Union of ^outh Africa the same effect as regards Union nationals and that a „_ be communicated to the notification to this effect will Egyptian Government at the same time behalf of the Union of the gontraux Convan the ratification on British Embassy, Alexandria, 12th October, 1937. ohove is a true copy, -.n that the aoovc I hereby certify ( 3 gd) D.V.

The point which we had in mina was that, eo far as the position of Union nationals was concerned, the United kingdom had not in fact agreed to the definition contained in existing Union legislation which had been enacted by the Union without consultation with us. while we had no ciesire to enter on any discussion as to the acceptability or otherwise of the general scheme laid down in the Union Nationality ^ct, it seemed clear that, in theory at any rate if not in practice, to accept that as the criterion for the purpose of the ggypt Oi-der in Council aight hare the effect, quite apart rom the apti-ciiii.- class of easy set out in our telegram O.C.M.a., K.C.8.I.telegram No .152^ of depriving individuals autoia&amp;tloaily of the right to claim the benefit af privilege* to which they might be entitled as person** properly belonging to the United kingdom. The Matting of the Union Act is in some respects rather doubtful, and even iicoenstein was unable to say precisely hor* gome of its px*ovisioni3 would be interpreted, but it loo*,* as though it were possible for a British subject from this countiv to become a Union national, without any volition on his own part, after only two years* residence in the Union even though he had no intention of making the Union his permanent ho^e; ana we cannot therefore admit that every 'Union national' is necessarily a person whom tte Union le entitled to claim as against His Hu jest/' s Oovarni.ient In the Uni tea .‘-.iiijidom* particularly when it le a queation of rights to which the person concerned raay attach importance. In this connection you Bill remember that the conclusion* of the Imperial Conference of this year (pages SS and 27 of Omd. 6482) con tempi-ted that any definition of membership of a particular eommuniVcoiaiiuntty within the Commonwealth should be the subject of preliminary consultation between the Member** oi‘ ^he Goiaiiionwealth, and in the absence of such consultation we felt that as a matter of principle it was wrong to commit ourselves to accept the particular definition given in the Union legislation As a matter ox* fact the Union legislation does make some provision for release from Union nationality (Section 6(1) of Act &amp;o*40 of 1927); but this provision is not wholly adequate« since it do^s not cover the particular case of the United kingdom, where no legislation defining M nationals” has been passed* urn do not suggest that you need raise the point with boderistein, but we thought you should be aware of the views held here in case the point arote again. As a matter of fact my recollection is that bodenstein himself said that the definition in the Union Act ox* 1927 was by no means wholly satisfactory; but there is nothing recorded on this point and it could not therefore be quoted against him in case Oi. need.

Further we carefully considered in first instance whether we could draft the Order in such a way as to avoid referring even to Union of South Africa or to Irish Free State, but this was found to be impracticable for reasons with which you are familiar. Clause 9 of draft Order in Council was drafted in its present form as difficulties were felt, for reasons special to the Irish Free State, in making explicit reference to ’’Irish Free state citizens” and while we should see no difficulty in regard to use of formula suggested by Union Government so far as concerns Union nationals we feel that it would be impossible in legal document of this character to make use of different expressions for the Union of Sou oh Africa and Irish Free State for defining category of persons excluded from jurisdiction of court. ,/ould you point out our difficulty to Union Government and ascertain how far they the y suggest as regards Union of South Africa, bearing inmii'id that \;e do not thinl: use of analogous e;rpi»eoflion in case of Irish Free State to he possible.

No.86 of the 4th August, which referred to Article 9 of the Convention signed at Montraux on the 8th May, 1937, for the abolition of the Capitulations in Egypt • 2. It is observed from the second paragraph of your despatch that the Government of the United Kingdom contenplate j informing the Egyptian Government that they are taking steps to provide that the jurisdiction of British Consular Courts in Egypt will not extend to cases where the national lav/ to be applied in accordance with Articles 29 and 30 of the Annex to the Convention is the national lav/ of Saorstat Eireann. My Government would, however, point out that the cases where the national lav/ to be applied under ohe Articles referred to is that of Saorst^t Eireann are cases in v/hich only citizens of Saorstdt Eireann would be involved. They would emphasise that the declaration made by the representative of Saorstdt Eireann at the Mont re ax Conference made clear the position v/ith regard to citizens oi Saorstat Eireann and they, accordingly consider that no steps should be taken by the Government of t Kingdom in that connection. I enclose xor reference a copy of the declaration made oy Hi gat Honourable -the oecretary of State for Dominion Affairs downing Street, London, S.W. 1 . United♦ of Saorst£t Eireann at the Montreux Conference. 3. Referring to the Draft revised Egypt Order in Council which accompanied your despatch and in particular to paragraph 9 (l) (ii) of Part II of the Draft Order, I am to state that the Government of Saorst^t Eireann take the view that, having regard to the position indicated in the previous paragraph, the Draft Order should contain no reference to cases in which the national law to he applied is the lav/ of Saorstat Eireann. The expression ’’British subject' does not include citizens of Saorst&amp;t Eireann. I have, etc., (Sd) E&amp;mon de Valera.

I have great pleasure in joining in the tributes which have been paid to His Uxoollency, the president of the Swiss Confederation, and in the expressions of gratitude to the authorities of the town of Montreux, and of the Canton, for the welcome and hospitality which they have extended to the delegations. I have also, on behalf of my Government, to offer my most sincere congratulations to the- Egyptian delegation, on the fruitful results for Egypt which the Conference has achieved. My country is happy to have had the honour oi participating in a Conference for the achievement of such re&amp;u-i-t Although the Irish Free State was not a party to any ? the treatiss whereby the former regime of foreign capitu^aoions 1 Egypt was created, Irish citizens succeeded to certain apitulatory rights by virtue of a number of treaties wnicn were jplied to our nationals at a time when our country formed part of the UniteC Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The Irish Free State has, however, never post-_.o&amp;ed, fact ever wished to assert a right to-its own consular courts in Egypt, and as one of the High Contracting Parties to the new Convention, the Irish Free State does not propose to avail itself °f any such right, however limited, which the Convention may t0 citizens.In the matter relating to x^ersonal status of its citizens, my country is, of course, anxious that its national laws should be applied not only in dgypt, but in every State throughout the world. We are, therefore, glad to know that, following the present Convention, provision is to be made by the Egyptian Legislature for the application by the Mixed Tribunals of Irish laws, to cases involving personal status of Irish Free State citizens.Telegram COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA From the Government of the*..* Dated27th Augusts 1937c Received at 11,5 amc27th Ai^uat, Ko e 66 Your deapatch of the 4th Auguat 1937 Circular 6,86 and Draft Order in Council, Conrnonwealth Government do not desire to offer any obaervations on the terms of the draft*Telogroa UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA n~ ' 6050 ; 19 ?? 7 Fi-om the Government of the,,. « nQLCSURH IN y ' ETTEN ^..ited 31st Aug,uot r 1937, Received at 11.21 am 31 at August.

InIn this connection His Majesty's Government in the Union of South Africa desire to draw attention to para= nraph 4 of the memorandun of 8th June 1937 in which the uv&gt; Officers state 'It would no doubt be appropriate that the notice given to the Egyptian Government....... should be made on behalf of and at the instance of His Majesty's Governments in Egypt as well as of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom'. From this it would appear that the present draft notification is not in appropriate form. As Hie Majesty’s Government in the Union of South Africa have some interest in the form in which proposed notification under Article IX will finally he made by Hie Majesty's Government*- in the United Kingdom, they would much appreciate receiving &amp; copy thereof in due course * 6, In conclusion.

(Vii minds that the XX.—The Attitude of the Various Delegations. Egyptian Delegation. 12 Nahas Pasha, as president of the conference, conducted the formal business of the plenary sessions with dignity and geniality. He wisely left the anisation of the conference almost entirely to M. Aghnides, the secretary- 0 ° era l t0 M . Politis, as president of the General and Drafting Committees, and ?o M Hansson as president of the Reglement Committee. 1 13 On the whole the Egyptian delegation were reasonable and acquitted themselves well. Bedawi Pasha ran true to form both in his extraordinary technical ability and in his obstinacy in securing his own point of view over matters of detail. Makram Ebeid Pasha was an able and conciliatory negotiator. The Egyptian delegation (with the exception of one point, referred to later) fulfilled perfectly loyally and readily their side of the bargain under Document A. Their reception of our' general support at the conference under the conditions of Document A was genuinely cordial. This was more particularly marked in the earlier stages of the conference, but their cordiality became slightly lessened towards the end, owing to the fact that we took the line (already expressed as the view of His Majesty’s Government to the Egyptian Government before the conference on a point not settled by Document A) that they should drop the paragraph of the R.O.J. which provided for the exclusion of “ sujets and ‘‘proteges” from the transitional Mixed Courts when political difficulties were raised to it by other delegations, and the Egyptian delegation had got their way as regards the duration of the transitional period. This cloud was removed when the United Kingdom delegation played an important part in securing the eventual compromise (now embodied in the last four paragraphs of article 2o of the R.O.J. annexed to the convention). French Delegation. 14 The French delegation were friendly and disposed to co-operate with us and on the technical work in the Drafting Committee, M Chargueraud and M. de Bellefonds were of great assistance through their ability, and they 'ere as consistently helpful as their instructions would permit them to be_ cordiality of the whole delegation with us became more marke as e • came to its end and reached its peak at the very end of the conference general tactics, however, were disastrous for themselves • conference. To begin with they insisted on three main pom s. ( ) , in the length of the transitional regime and its division into F™ ; ( ) Egypt should either enter into engagements of the kind usua y ^ . establishment conventions for a period of unlimited dura ion m Convention, or conclude an Establishment Treaty wit which excluded conference itself; (3) the deletion of the paragraph of the . • • Courts sujets and protdges from the jurisdiction of the transiDonal Mixed Uurts. They did this although as regards the first two points . e y , both of during discussions which Mr. Beckett had held w1 ^ ^^^i delegates then these desiderata were in our view unattainable. The p P • n 0 f the went to Paris in the middle of the conference, causing • ^ ,j 0I1 0 f the sittings of the principal committees, though happi} a authority Drafting Committee work was secured. When they came with^autiiority to surrender on the first two points, they could, if f J? on the third, straightforward manner, have easily secured ^ ^LSfons a situation Instead, owing to the clumsy and devious nature °f em ^ but the was created in which an agreement was supposed to . .. ,, recrimination in two parties differed as to Its terms, and there was considerablejecrimina the course of which each accused the other ot bad a • ( j e | e[rat j on an d the may we p } lave the excessive numbers of th ^ question of divergencies of view which existed in it. The resu , Egyptian feeling snjets and proteges remained unsolved U P t0 ^ n %k e mos t anodyne character had run so high that some compromise, even though controversy the French had to be found, to save their face. As the result of thm controve^ ^ to do completely exhausted their goodwill and bargaining p pgvond that which virtually nothing in obtaining from the Egyptians anythmg^eyoi His Majesty’s Government had already secured in B g [15448]15. For one thing, however, the other delegations may be thankful; the French did not on this occasion bring the work of the conference to a stop by a Ministerial crisis in Paris. Italian Delegation. 16 . The policy of the Italian delegation was one of self-effacement combined with great ability in allowing otheis, notably the United Ivingdom, the French and the Greek delegations, to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for them. Thev made no difficulty over the presence of a Spanish delegation holding full powers from the Valencia Government. Judge Messina took a considerable part in the technical work of the Drafting Committee. He was amusing and not obstructive. Greek Delegation. 17. The Greek delegation worked hard to secure the interests of their countrymen, notably in matters of fondations and statut personnel, and on the whole they achieved more and at the cost of less unpopularity than their French colleagues. M. Politis’s election as chairman of the General Committee was a considerable tribute to the personal position which he has established for himself at international conferences, since the important material interests of his country in Egypt would normally have put the head of the Greek delegation out of court for so responsible a position at a conference for the abolition of the Capitulations in Egypt. As was to be expected, however, M. Politis generally fulfilled his duties as chairman with skill and impartiality. He was, however, naturally not always at home in the difficult questions which occupied the Drafting Committee. Other Foreign Delegations. 18. The United States Government had been informed in confidence of the contents of Document A and had already promised Egypt and His Majesty s Government their full support. Their delegation carried out this policy very effectively ; in particular, their immediate and emphatic support of the Egyptian claim that the transitional period should last twelve years was of great assistance. In spite of Belgium’s considerable material interests in Egypt, the Belgian delegation took up a line which was reasonable and moderate. They collaborated with the United Kingdom delegation cordially and helpfully. The Portuguese representative supported the United Kingdom well, in accordance with the assurances volunteered to His Majesty’s Government by the Portuguese Ambassador in London. The representative of Norway, M. Hansson, took a more prominent part in the negotiations than the interests of his country in Egypt would have warranted, as, in view of his opsition as late President of the Egyptian Mixed Court of Appeal, he was appointed president of the committee which discussed the new Reglement d'Organisation Judiciare of the Mixed Courts in the transitional period. This work he did efficiently, but he displeased the Egyptians by his obvious desire to obtain larger safeguards for foreign interes s than those which the Egyptians could possibly concede. The attitude of other foreign delegations does not call for special comment. Irish Free State and South African Delegations. 19. The Irish Free State delegation took an independent line in their speeches at the formal meetings at the beginning and end of the con ^ ren , c - though they did not take any serious part in the actual negotiations, in h speech at the opening session, the Free State delegate was the only one to expU a wish for the immediate abolition of foreign privileges in Egypt, as oppose abolition after a reasonable period; at the final plenary session for signature announced (without previous warning to the United Kingdom delegation a clearly on instructions from Dublin) that the Free State had ne had consular courts in Egypt and did not therefore desire that J should be any reservation of consular jurisdiction in matters of s personnel '' for Irish Free State citizen's. The Irish Free Sta . te , U i°\ eeI i ment were glad they should go before the Mixed Courts and that it had provided that Irish law as their national law should be applied to them- l His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom proposes to, ^ in favour of keeping a British consular court for “statut pemnnei ^ British nationals (i.e., British subjects and British-protected persons) and as State citizens, being all British nationals (they are nearly all British subjects,the few that are not are British-protected persons in Egypt), will come within the jurisdiction thus reserved, it remains to be seen (i) whether the Irish Free State Government in fact mean to object to cases affecting British nationals who are also Irish Free State citizens being dealt with by the British consular court, and (ii) whether the Mixed Courts will be led to take the view that an Irish Free State citizen possesses a nationality distinct from that of a British national so that the Mixed Courts will have to decide (under article 30 of the R.O.J.) whether they should themselves deal with such a case or leave it to the British consular court. The South African delegation was throughout in agreement with the line taken by the United Kingdom delegation and in fact intervened to oppose a solution of the question whether sujets and protegds of the ex-capitulatory Powers would be subject to the Mixed Courts, which discriminated between different classes of British-protected persons, particularly those from mandated territories. Neither the South African delegation, nor the Irish Free State delegations, made any difficulty about the grouping of the Commonwealth delegations in the preamble and signature portions of the convention and protocol and they collaborated with the United Kingdom delegation in getting over a difficulty as regards the descrip tion of nationals of the ex-capitulatory Powers in article 25, paragraph 1, of the R.O.J., where the expression “nationals of the high contracting parties to the Convention of Montreux ” is used. Canada. 20. His Majesty’s Government in Canada did not think it necessary to send a delegation to the conference, but sent a note to the president of the conference, in which they accepted, in advance, the provisions of any conventions signed and ratified on behalf of other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, on the condition that Canada could claim thereunder the same rights as those States in whose behalf it had been ratified. This letter has been inserted in the Final Act of the conference. Australia, New Zealand and India. 21. I received full powers to sign the conference instruments in respect of Australia, New Zealand and India and acted under these powers. The Secretary-General. 22. M. Aghnides (whose services together with those of his small staff had been lent by the Secretariat of the League of Nations for the con erence) u y justified our expectations, based on his work in a similar capaci y a e ^ Conference a year before. His work was uniformly tactful and e cien an almost faultless working of the machinery during the last week o ^i 011 at a time of extreme pressure and congestion of work, was a considera e ment. III.— The Course of the Discussions at the Conference. 23. The conference met on the 12th April. Nahas Pasha and t0 Pasha, Egyptian delegates, were members of the official Montreux the Coronation, and had, if they were to fulfil the engagemen , complete i ts on the 8 th May. This left only four weeks for the conference to complete Us work unless either the conference was to adjourn or imp &lt; documents arrangements were to be upset. The length and comp ox y con f e rence drawn up at Montreux will show that it was no oasy as a e w a tion had to work finished in so short a time, and the United Kingdom delegation assume the ungrateful task of persuading the confer pvvntian dele cr ation and at greater pressure than most ‘xtrcSd) were^unfortunately not (for whose convenience the pressure had to be exerci ) the least loud in their complaints of being overworke . pvenino 1 of the 11 th 24.

Principal Results of the Instruments Conference. . . . ire d by 33. The preamble of the Montreux Convention is obvioush i n P e ntion article 13 of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance. Article 1 ol7 bolishes the Capitulations in Egypt,(') and article 2, paragraph 1, renders Fcrvptian legislation applicable to foreigners in Egypt “ subject to the applica- b n of the principles of international law.” These two provisions constitute the alisation of paragraph 1 (i) of the annex to article 13 of our Treaty of Alliance. The remainder of the provisions drawn up at the conference are (with small mentions) the ‘ ‘ transitional regime ’ ’ provided for in paragraph 1 (ii) of the ^nex t0 ar ti c le 13 of the Treaty of Alliance, and explained in the remaining &amp; rovisions of that annex and developed in greater detail in Document A. P 1 34 it was stated in paragraph 5 of the annex to article 13 of the Treaty of Alliance that in future not only— “ the assent of the capitulatory Powers will be no longer necessary for the application of any Egyptian legislation to their nationals, but also that the present legislative functions of the Mixed Tribunals as regards the application of°Egyptian legislation to foreigners will terminate. It would follow* from this that the Mixed Tribunals in their judicial capacity would no longer have to pronounce upon the validity of the application to foreigners of an Egyptian law or decree which has been applied to foreigners by the Egyptian Parliament or Government, as the case may be and paragraph (xviii) of the agreed minute to the treaty adds— “ With regard to paragraph 6 of the annex to article 13 (non-discrimina tion), it is understood that questions relating to this declaration are not subjects for the appreciation of any courts in Egypt.” The intention, therefore, was to take away from the Mixed Courts their existing legislative powers as regards the making of Egyptian laws applicable to foreigners and their powers to hold Egyptian laws not applicable to foreigners on the ground that they were outside the legislative capacity of the Egyptian Government, or conflicted with the treaty rights of foreigners ( droits acouis ”). In order to give effect to this intention it was necessary not merely to remove from the existing R.O.J. the articles con ferring legislative powers on the Mixed Courts, but also to amend the old articE 11 which enabled the Mixed Courts to award damages for foreigners if it was held that they suffered damage owing to application to them of a law which infringed rights based on a treaty. . . , , i • i f 35. On the other hand, it was necessary to maintain the most valuable right to sue the Egyptian Government in the Mixed Courts, including t e ri § claim damages for all administrative acts not justified by the law a rigi ^ covers claims for refund of sums levied by way of taxation when i 1 ®. s ,, the assessment was excessive or unjustified. A text of a new ar 1C ^ R.O.J. in this sense appears as article 10 of the annex to Documen _ . ^ of the new P.O.J. annexed to the convention, which deals with this matter, do^ not differ in substance from the text proposed in Document A an is sa is p The following comment in the Drafting Committee s report may e n onnexion :— “ Article 43 {formerly Article 32). “ This article was retained in the form adopted hy the committee mte light of the observations made at the plenary meeting ( • ■ &gt; PP- from which it appears— , , , . i “ (1) That the expression ‘ laws and regulations ’ l 'w£ as covering also provisions of treaties which are of sue a tbe form of been necessary for the Egyptian Government to enact them m the form municipal laws. 0 ) The Drafting Committee report on article 1 says. , abrogation “This provision, which is of a general nature involves ^ necessity^ of all treaties, instruments, arrangements or usages, vhic ' of the convention. , , „ rM^nrvsnl was laid before it to “ In this connexion, the committee wishes to state C p , an( j 0 ther international annex to the convention a text (Doc.

The only i . , • a n a single articles *ere references to certain multilateral conventions which contained, inte or sentences relevant to the Capitulations.‘ ‘ (2) That the term ‘ violation ’ should be taken to mean not only violations of the letter but also violations of the spirit of the law. “ It is further understood that the absence of jurisdiction to question the validity of the application of Egyptian laws or regulations to foreigners entails^ as a consequence, the absence of any jurisdiction to consider whether Egyptian laws are inconsistent with the principles generally adopted in modern legislations or whether they discriminate against foreigners.” Non-Discrimination. 36. Paragraph 6 of the annex to article 13 of the Treaty of Alliance provides— “His Majesty the King of Egypt hereby declares that no Egyptian legislation made applicable to foreigners will be inconsistent with the principles generally adopted in modern legislation or, with particular relation to legislation of a fiscal nature, discriminate against foreigners, including foreign corporate bodies.” Paragraph 13 of Document A states :— “ The Montreux Convention will contain a provision in terms similar to those of paragraph 6 of the annex to article 13 of the Treaty of Alliance.” Effect is given to Document A on this point by— (a) Paragraphs 2 and 3 of article 2 of the convention, which read “ It is understood that the legislation to which foreigners will be subject will not be inconsistent with the principles generally adopted in modern legislation, and will not, with particular relation to legislation of a fiscal nature, entail any discrimination against foreigners or against companies incorporated in accordance with Egyptian law wherein foreigners are substantially interested. “ The immediately preceding paragraph, in so far as it does not con stitute a recognised rule of international law, shall apply only during the transition period.” (b) Part I of the protocol which reads :— “ It is understood that the provisions of article 2 , paragraph 2, of the convention relating to non-discrimination, which are applicable during the transition period, must be interpreted in the light of international practice relating to undertakings of that nature between countries enjoying legislative sovereignty.” (c) Paragraph 2 of the declaration of the Egyptian Government, which is as follows:— ‘ ‘ W ith reference to article 2 , paragraph 2 , of the convention and the protocol relating thereto, the fact that the effect of the non-discrimination rule referred to in the above-mentioned article 2 is limited to the duration of the transition period, does not imply any intention on the part of the Royal Egyptian Government to pursue thereafter in this matter any contrary policy of discrimination against foreigners. The Royal Egyptian Government is. moreover, prepared to conclude Establishment Treaties and Treaties of Friendship with the various Powers.” 3/. Paragraph 2 of article 2 of the convention differs from paragraph 6 of the annex in the Treaty of Alliance (i) in that it does not mention in terms foreign corporate bodies,” but the Drafting Committee’s report (p. 15) states that this was not necessary as foreign companies are covered by the ter® foreigners ; and (ii) in 'that it mentions expressly Egyptian companies in which foreigners are substantially interested (thus goin 0, beyond the treaty an Document A). Ihe Drafting Committee’s report also states— In the framing of this text, account was taken of the fact that among the principles generally adopted in modern legislations, which are refene to m paiagiaph 2 of the text, should certainly be included the rule concernin D respect for legally acquired rights. It is, moreover, understood that the non-discrimination rule set fod m paragi aph 2 of the new text, although considered more especially in iegm to its application to fiscal matters, is a rule of a general nature. ., The term legislation ’ used in article 2 is to be taken in the wi sense which it bears in English.”The whole question of non-discrimination is discussed in greater detail in Part V of this report. 38 It will now be convenient to deal first with the points dealt with in Document A and in the order in which they appear in it. Where the Montreux instruments go beyond or fall short of Document A, attention will be called to it; where no comment of this kind is made, the inference is that the Montreux instruments simply give effect to Document A. Then, certain points will be enumerated which were not dealt with in Document A at all. ( 1 ) 39 . The length of the transitional regime during which the Mixed Tribunals will exercise, in addition to their present jurisdiction, that at present vested in the consular courts will be twelve years, and will terminate on the 14th October, 1949- 40. There is no provision in a protocol of signature (as suggested in Document A) that the new regime should come into force provisionally on a given date if sufficient ratifications have not been received at that date to bring the Montreux Convention definitely into operation. Instead, paragraph 2 of article 3 of the convention provides that the new R.O.J. will apply from the 15th October, 1937, and paragraph 3 of article 15 provides that the convention “will come into force on the 14th October, 1937, if three instruments of ratification have been deposited by that date. It will not, however, enter into force in respect of the other signatories before the date of the deposit of their respective instruments of ratification.” This paragraph is based on a proposal by the United States delegation. Admittedly, the exact legal position as regards countries which have not ratified by the 15th October is intentionally obscure, but all the parties concerned preferred not to make it more precise, the understanding being that no difficulties would be raised in practice if, at least three ratifications having been received, the Egvptian Government put the new regime into force on the 15th October, 1937. The United States delegation, m fact, wrote a letter to Nahas Pasha stating that, even if the United States ratification was not deposited by this date, the United States Government could and would waive its capitulatory rights and its rights to the maintenance of the existing K.O.J. by executive action, provided that all foreigners were subjected to the same regime. 41. Article 8 of the convention provides that no new proceeding (except in statut personnel where this jurisdiction has been reserved) is to be instituted m any consular court in Egypt after the 15th October, 1937, but that proceedings already begun at that date may be completed unless voluntarily transfened to e Mixed Courts under article 53 of the R.O.J. . ^ , 42. Article 12 of the convention provides for the maintenance m r,gyp during the transitional period of the consular judicial records, and t e g ian 0 a right of inspection and of certified copies when this is required by the mixe or national courts in Egypt in connexion with a case within their jurisdiction. e Drafting Committee’s report mentions that fees may be charged for copies. (2a) 43. The Egyptian delegation circulated to the other delegations a Penal Code and a Criminal Procedure Code for application by the Mixe the transitional period. No difficulties were made regarding these ^ &gt; Powers, but they preferred not to take cognisance of them by prmrP i V ed ln the instruments signed at Montreux. The codes were though United on modern and enlightened lines. On the other hand, at the requcs articles ■Kingdom delegation, supported by the French delegation, nrocedure containing essential and elementary guarantees in the mattei o ci • g. were inserted in the R.O.J. itself and thus rendered to transitional regime. Particular attention is drawn in . lirticles 46, 48, 49 (paragraph 1 ) and 50, which read as fo o^s . ‘'Article 46.—En matiere penale, les tribunauxde simple police J les faits qualifies contraventions par la loi et les debts c P ne depassant pas trois mois d’emprisonnement. [15448]o Ption 1 of the declaration by the Egyptian Government in the Final Act states tht it has already decided to extend by decree the competence of the tribunals t the nationals * of Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, ttoumania, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. 49 No Egyptian national may avail himself of the protection of a foreign Power for the purposes of claiming Mixed Court jurisdiction (article 25 of the Redement d’Organisation judiciaire, paragraph 2). (This provision is not in Document A, but is obviously equitable.) 50 Nationals of Syria, the Lebanon, Palestine and Transjordan, will be subiect to the national courts (article 25 of the Reglement d’Organisation udiciaire, paragraph 3). This is a continuation of the status quo under decisions of the Mixed Courts based upon the fact that these territories were formerly part of the Ottoman Empire. It was necessary to provide this expressly in the new redement because they are now “ ressortissants ” of capitulatory Powers. ° 51 Foreign nationals (whether citizens, subjects or protected persons) belonging to religions or confessions or practising rites for which there exist Egyptian tribunals dealing with matters of personal status shall continue under the same conditions as in the past to have their cases heard by the said tribunals in matters relating thereto (article 25 of the Reglement d'Organisation judiciaire, paragraph 4). (This is the first section of the face-saving device( 2 ) which was necessary to bring together the points of view of the Egyptian, French, Netherlands, and United Kingdom delegations.) 52. The Drafting Committee's report observes on this provision (article 25 (4))— “ When the stipulation was made in paragraph 4 that the Egyptian tribunals dealing with matters of personal status shall continue to function under the same conditions as in the past, it was understood that these expres sions do not imply any immobilisation of these judicial organisations in matters relating to personal status, and that the said tribunals will deal with cases not by consular delegation, but in virtue of their own powers. 53 Moslem British subjects and British-protected persons have in the past had recourse to the Sharia courts in Egypt for statut personnel cases, and the Egypt Order in Council (article 91, paragraph 2) enables the British consulai court to recognise the Sharia judgments. The position will be the same m e future, except that the British consular court (retained for statut peisonne ) wi no longer come into the matter at all, as regards Sharia decisions gi\en wi regard to these persons. This paragraph of the R.O.J. really creates an excep ion to article 9 of the convention, providing for the reservation of statu P er ?°?^ n Orthodox British subjects and British-protected persons have not had the ngnt to have recourse to religious courts in Egypt for statut personnel m 11 e pas un the Egypt Order in Council, and will not be covered by this paragiap &gt; are Jews, from whom this right was taken away by the Order m Counci o • 54 .

Article 7 of the convention applies to the Egyptian the rule laid down in article 40 of the R.O.J. for the Mixed kour s. ^ t jj e 65. In article 8 of the annex to Document A appears a dra ^ ve jyin terms of which give jurisdiction to the Mixed and national courts re p the case of third party actions (whatever the nationality of P ar tr munals, ^ ut to principal actions already properly entertained by either -V + 0 give ri se as it appeared that this principle was undesirable, (i) as being Uk X . » c0lir ts to conflicts of jurisdiction, (ii) bringing a foreigner before me ^ this without any form of consent on his part, a particular reserve wim garticle 8 is made in the body of Document A. The conference was faced with a demand by the Egyptian delegation for one of two things in this matter: either the adoption of this Egyptian proposal, or, alternatively, the abolition of third party actions altogether as a special source of jurisdiction for both sets of tribunals. (At present the Mixed Courts possess this jurisdiction, but not the national courts.) The conference wisely chose the latter alternative and article 37 of the R.O.J. gives effect to this conclusion (which gave Bedawi Pasha distress) with a purely facultative power in the Mixed Courts to send a third party action to the national courts, and vice versa, if it was deemed in the interests of justice to do so. Article 5 of the convention obliges the Egyptian Government to introduce the same rule for the national courts. (5) Use of Arabic in the Mixed Courts. 66 . The judicial languages employed in the courts will be (as heretofore) Arabic, English, French and Italian. The operative part of judgments will be pronounced at the hearing in two of the judicial languages, of which one must be Arabic. (The translation of the few lines of which the “ dispositif ” consists can be done in a few minutes on the spot.) After the pronouncement, judgments in a foreign language will be translated in their entirety into Arabic, and those in Arabic will be translated in their entirety into a foreign language. In the event of divergence between the original text and the translation, the former will be authentic (article 12 of the R.O.J.). It is thought that the manner in which the question has been solved avoids all the practical difficulties which were anticipated. ( 6 ) Judicial Personnel. 67. The Court of Appeal will be composed (as before) of eighteen conseillers, of which eleven are foreigners. If required, two additional conseillers, of which one will be a foreigner, will be appointed. (These additional appointments are not provided for in Document A, and this is a useful Egyptian concession going beyond that document.) Foreign vacancies in the Court of Appeal will be filled by the promotion of foreign judges of the tribunals of first instance (article 2 of the R.O.J.). The Drafting Committee’s report records that— “ The Egyptian Government will as far as possible continue the practice now followed in regard to the replacing of a judge of the Court of Appeal of a given nationality by a judge of the same nationality.” Document A provides that seven additional judges shall be added to the existing number of judges for the tribunals of first instance, and that of these, four shall be foreign and three Egyptian. However, of the fifty-five existing Mixed Doui judges, one foreign judge is supernumerary; only six new judges, therefore, wi be appointed, namely, three foreign and three Egyptian. This brings the o a in the courts of first instance to sixty-one judges, of which forty are foieigneis. Foreign vacancies in the tribunals of first instance will be filled by Egyp mn judges, subject to the proviso that the number of foreign judges shall no a below one-third of the total number of judges in the tribunals of first instance (article 3). . , . 68 . No distinction based on the nationality of judges will be ma e ei in the composition of the Chambers or in the appointments to the various posts ox me judicial organisation, including the presidency of tribunals and c am ers. president of the Court of Appeal will be of foreign nationality, and the uce- president of Egyptian nationality. Should the president of a ^ i Egyptian nationality, the vice-president will be of foreign na i J ’ rice versa favtiolp • • i 69. the protocol of the convention states that the selection of foreign judges a matter for the Egyptian Government, but that, m order e s Y fbe persons whom it may select, the Government will approac • , j Ministers of Justice of the foreign countries concerned and will appo ^ persons of whom their respective Governments approve. This w P reQues t contained in Document A, but agreed to by the Egyptian delegation at the^uest of the United Kingdom delegation. It continues the exis i &amp; P Was important to preserve.(7) Parquet. 70. The procurator-general will be a foreigner (article 16 of the R.O.J.). tt p ill assisted by two advocates-general, one Lgyptian and one foreign, of whom the Eevntian will be senior in precedence, but the foreigner will, ?n the Sence of g tle procurator-general, deal with criminal and penal matte, ? (article 17). The Drafting Committee’s report observes (a) with reference to article 17— “ It is not intended to modify in a general way the rule in accordance with which the parquet constitutes an indivisible judicial organ; if, therefore the procurator-general and the second advocate-general are prevented from discharging their duties, they will be replaced by the first advocate-general. Similarly, if the procurator-general and the first advocate- general are prevented from discharging their duties, they shall be replaced by the second advocate-general. (b) with reference to article 18— “ It did not consider it necessary to include a special provision regarding the uromotion of officials of the parquet. It was, however, understood that the Esvntian Government intends to continue the current practice in this matter' as stated in the declaration by the Egyptian delegation recorded in the minutes of the meeting held by the Reglement Committee on the 19th April, 1937 (P.V. 4, p. 11). Both these points {a) and (b) were points to which the procurator-general, Mr. Holmes, attached much importance, and they were, in consequence, piessed by 4-1^^ TTrvUorl TTinorlnm dfdfio-ation. ( 8 ) Pardons and Death Sentences. 71 The procurator-general will be called upon to give his opinion on the execution of death sentences or the total or partial remission of penalties on foreigners (article 21 of the R.O.J.). (9) Perquisitions. 72. Arrests and domiciliary searches of foreigners, except .j n ca ® es “ flagrant delit ” or a call for help from within the dwelling-house, wll l he ca out by, or in the presence of, a member of the mixed parquet or an t judicial police to whom such functions have been delegated by the mixe p 4 (article 47 of the R.O.J.). (10) Deportations. 73. Section 4 of the Egyptian Government’s declaration in the FinalA^ states that, in view of the fact that the abolition of the Capitulations en ^ suppression of all restrictions on the right of that Government to expel D from Egypt, they declare that, during the transitional period, it is n , • ctt() intention to exercise their right of expulsion as regards any foreigner su j ^ the Mixed Courts who has resided in Egypt for a period of at leas ' * t0 (Document A says “not less than seven years ”), nor to refuse him a Egyptian territory if he has temporarily left Egypt, unless— ^ ^ (a) He has been condemned for a crime or an offence punishable by mo re three years’ imprisonment. . . 1 , p U |)lic (h) He has been guilty of activities subversive of or prejudicia F order, tranquillity, morals or health. He is indigent and a burden to the State. . c&lt; nativities 74. The Drafting Committee’s report states that the expression ^ -grated prejudicial to public tranquillity” is to be understood as ineanl P® say. a acts disturbing public tranquillity, but a series of repeated acts, tha i continued form of conduct presenting such a character.3 15 (11a) Prisons. 75. The procurator-general will supervise prisons or penitentiaries in which foreigners are detained. He shall, in addition, have free access at all times to any other place wherein a foreigner may be detained (article 22 of the R.O.J.). (11b) Prison Reglement. Document A stated :— “ In view of the greater number and the different type of Mixed Court prisoners who will in future serve their sentences in Egypt, it is recognised that some modification may be required to existing Prison Reglement of March 1914.” Owing to pressure of work on Bedawi Pasha, the Egyptian Government failed to come to any conclusions before the conference with regard to the modification of the Prison Reglement (suggestions for this purpose made by Sir A. Keown Boyd, the late Director-General of the European Department of the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior, were received by them during the conference). Further, the delegations of the other capitulatory Powers showed little interest in the question, and the pressure of work on other more important questions resulted in this matter being left over. The Egyptian delegation promised orally to the United Kingdom delegation, who did not fail to press them privately on this question, that foreigners sentenced to imprisonment should not be kept at any prisons other than the two modern ones at Cairo and Alexandria, and that they would consider themselves bound by Document A to consult His Majesty's Government before they modified the Prison Reglement. ( 12 ) Statut Personnel. 76. The agreement in Document A was that, in principle, statut personnel cases should go before the Mixed Courts, but that if a majority of the Powers at the conference expressed a desire to reserve consular courts to deal with statut personnel cases, the convention should contain an article permitting them to do so. (This possibility was foreshadowed in the annex to article 13 of the Treaty of Alliance.) At the time Document A was drawn up, the arguments on the merits for and against a reservation of statut personnel seemed to be fairly evenly balanced, but it was anticipated that the French, Italians and Greeks would certainly desire it. In between January and the date of the conference the views entertained in the Foreign Office and at the Embassy in Cairo moved in the direction of the desirability of the reservation of statut personnel. It was therefore a matter of surprise to find at the conference that the French, Italian and Greek delegations were still entirely uncertain in their minds as to whether they were in favour of the reservation of statut personnel or not. Further, there was a great reluctance on all their parts to demand a right of reservation. Apparently they thought, quite erroneously, that this was a demand which the Egyptians would only accede to with reluctance, and that they would be exhausting their bargaining power by making it, whereas, in fact, the Egyptians were nearly indifferent upon this point. These three delegations were much keener on securing (as was also contemplated in Document A) that in matters of statut personnel the foreign national law should always be applied, even the transitional period, and that the Egyptians should have prepared before 1949 a proper code for application by the national civil courts for foreign statut personnel cases. In the end the Gordian knot was cut by joint proposals in both the above senses being put forward by the United Kingdom, French, Grees. and Italian delegations. 77. In view of the facts that (i) the parties to a statut personnel sui may easily be of different nationality; (ii) any one of these parties may possess moie than one nationalitv; and (iii) that the rules applied in different countries o determine the national law to be applied in statut personnel cases differ widely, it was clearly necessary that there should be a set of rules which should determine ( a ) w hat was statut personnel and what was not; (5) whether a statu person case raust be deemed to be a foreign case (coming before the Mixed oi consu c courts) or an Egyptian one (coming before the Egyptian religious cou ), (^ assuming the case to be a foreign case, determining whether i was o fe U within the jurisdiction of the Mixed Courts or within that of the consulai court of a Power which had reserved statut personnel jurisdic 10 , ( )_ • i r^,-v in vtc wptg to apply m the statut ppisonnpl crsbs they national law the ^xed C rec0 a n iJd in Document A, and a rough set of dealt with.

Article 56 excepts from the jurisdiction of the Mixed Courts statut personnel cases which have been duly reserved for consular courts in accordance with article 9 of the convention. 84. (B) Article 9 of the convention provides a facultative power of reserving statut personnel for any high contracting party who at present possesses consular courts in Egypt. The remarks of the delegation of the Irish Free State on this subject at the last plenary meeting have already been referred to above. It has also been pointed out above that this article must be deemed to be without prejudice to article 25, paragraph 4, of the R.O.J., and that the reservation will not include suits affecting nationals who go before the religious courts in Egypt in accordance with that paragraph. Although it is provided that at the end of the transitional regime statut personnel cases pending before consular courts must be transferred to the national tribunals at the state they have then reached, it is made clear by the Drafting Committee's report that this only means that the consular courts themselves must be closed at this date and does not prevent appeals from decisions given by the consular courts being heard after this date, for instance, in England by the Privy Council. 85. Article 10 makes applicable in order to determine the jurisdiction of the consular courts for statut personnel the rules contained in articles 28, 29 and 30 of the R.O.J. Thus, if in accordance with these rules a statut personnel case is one which falls within the domain of some form of British law, the British consular court has jurisdiction. It will be necessary for His Majesty's Govern ment in amending the Egypt Order in Council to make these rules applicable by the British consular court for statut personnel in order to determine its juris diction. It is, however, made clear in the Drafting Committee s report that once it is determined that the British consular court has jurisdiction, nothing in the convention prevents that court from applying to determine this suit any law which it thinks appropriate in accordance with the system of private international law laid down for it. 86 . (C) The declaration in the final Act, though not quite as explicit as might have been desired, does commit the Egyptian Government to adopt indefinitely the principle of the application of the foreign national law m statut personnel cases. It does not, of course (nor could this be expected) commit the Egyptian Government to adopt indefinitely the rules laid down in the K.O.J. tor the determination of the national law. The second paragraph of the declara ion, which was presented by the Egyptian delegation ensures that no Egyptian iu e o procedure for foreign statut personnel cases will be applied to the piejudice o a substantive provision of the foreign national law. . . , „ . , , , 87. It is, in fact, made clear that the courts to which foreign statut personnel cases are to go after the transitional regime are the Egyptian natioi a civil courts, though this is not stated in the Egyptian declaration. 88 . The report of the Drafting Committee, however on article 9 ot tne convention points out that this conclusion necessarily results from paiagiap of article 9. . , , . 89. The Drafting Committee’s report further states, wit declaration, as follows : “In regard to the text of this declara 10 f n • t r _ delegation explained that it understood the general tendency 0 P, na j national law is oriented towards the suppression of therenioi o a dpclara- law.” The explanation of this is that we pressed for the ^clusion^in the declam U it we presseu iui ^ , fjon of a statement that the future Egyptian legislation app lca e a * De rsonal fnrfiicm national law m matters ot peisonai We were as the transitional regime in applying the foreign national • wp w status would apply the foreign internal law and refect t e ; _ • j £ n j te i y CJj0 unable to persuade the Egyptian delegation to commit t ems n • • this (the point was not dealt with in Document A), b f .‘^ ^ 0^0 this Drafting Committee’s report indicates that their P ll &gt; el .' J r uture if and when and it is, at any rate, something upon which we can le } the point arises. . , 07 nf the R.O.J. 90. The Drafting Committee’s report . on a y. ic e V rleleontion’s proposal contains the following statement: “ The l nited King observations made a Document C.C.M./C.R.O.J./2 was withdrawn following the observations [15448]by the Egyptian delegation in Document C.C.M./C.K.O.J./12.” These two papers ail in Annex 2 to this report. The United Kingdom proposal was made because it was pointed out through the Embassy in Cairo just before the con- ference that there was no proper law or procedure m Eng am foi the certification and detention of lunatics or the inspection of places where persons were confined - as lunatics, and our proposal was therefore an improvisation put forward to deal ' T with the situation. The Egyptian delegation s reply however affords some satisfaction in this respect and forms a basis upon which representations can be made if they do not carry out their intentions as declaied in this papei. (13) Consuls. 91 Foreign consuls will be justiciable by the ^lixed Gouits, subject to the restrictions laid down by international law. In particular, thev may not be prosecuted for anv actions committed in the course of their official duties. Their present privileges in the matter of taxation as regards official buildings, customs duties &amp;c will be maintained until the conclusion of consular conventions between Egypt and the various Powers, and in any case during a period of three y e ar s from the signing of the Montreux Convention (article 11 of the convention). (14) “ FondationsC 92. As the obligations which Egypt was prepared to undertake in regard to “ fondations ” only affected some of the other parties to the Montreux Conven tion, it was considered preferable to deal with the subject by a series or exchange of letters. Letters were accordingly exchanged between the Egyptian delegation on the one hand and the United Kingdom, United States, krench, Gieek an Italian delegations to the following effect: The Egyptian Government undertake that, pending the conclusion of a subsequent agreement, or, in any case, until the end of the transitional period, all educational, medical and charitable institutions (associations or foundations) of the countries in question actually existing in Egypt at the date of the convention may continue to carry on their activities subject to the following conditions :— (1) They will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Mixed Courts and subject to Egyptian laws and regulations, including fiscal laws, under the same conditions as similar Egyptian institutions, and also to all measures necessary for the preservation of public order in Egypt. (2) They will retain their legal status and, as regards their organisation an operation, will be governed by their own charters and by then ow curricula (it was understood that the reference to ‘ £ curricula imp ig that schools must not be obliged by Egyptian law to adopt At a ic a the medium of instruction). . . &lt;? ( 3 ) They may, without prejudice to the laws relating to expropria lon purposes of public utility, possess the movable or immovable prop J necessary to enable them to attain their objects and may admim and dispose of their property for these purposes. , (4) They may continue to employ their existing staff and may also e mp^ either Egyptians or foreigners without prejudice in all cases o ^ application of the Egyptian laws now applicable to them, or o ^ Egyptian Government’s general right of control over the en r ) foreigners into Egypt. ((4) is not in Document A, and is one o additional concessions made by the Egyptian delegation.) 93. Furthermore, within the limits of the customs recognised ^ regarding religions other than the State religion, freedom of worsm P e( j on continue to be assured to all religious institutions of the countries concei 1 ~ * i it* 1 r» 1 c 11 SL condition there is no offence against public order or morals. — tween institutions in question is to be drawn up as soon as possible in agreement De . on the Egyptian Government and the Governments of the countries in qn ^ (The French, Greek and Italian delegations have already cqmmunicatea ^ provisional list to the Egyptian delegation. Lists of the United K in £ cl 01 s jkie.) United States institutions must be drawn up and agreed as soon as po s ^ It was accepted that though religious institutions are only referred t0 . ci p a i last part of the note and therefore apparently not covered by the p 111guarantees, they are, in fact, deemed to be covered by the word “charitable and can therefore be included in the lists (as they have been in those annexed to t he French and Italian notes). Thus when religious institutions possess a church, a parson’s house, or a parish room, they are deemed to be performino- a work of “ assistance ’’ and in this capacity get the benefit of all the guarantees. 94 . The Netherlands and Spanish delegations have exchanged notes with the Egyptian delegation to the effect that the Egyptian Government will give the same treatment to their educational, medical, charitable and religious institutions as that accorded to the institutions of the above-mentioned countries. 95 . The following points not in Document A are dealt with in the instruments signed at Montreux (a) Future Position of (i) Mixed Courts Magistrates and Personnel, and (ii) of the Mixed Bar. 90 —(i) The Egyptian Government declare in section 7 of the Final Act of the convention that it does not intend to modify the conditions of service nor the existing salaries of Mixed Court magistrates, officials and employees. In the case of the officials and employees, it will give sympathetic consideration to their treatment in respect of grading, rules for increase of salary and promotion. The cases of any officials or employees discharged at the end of the transitional period will be examined in the light of the circumstances of each case. If the circum stances justify it, certain advantages may be accorded to them from the point of view of pension or compensation. The Egyptian Government intends to ensure the double imposition of taxation on the pensions of foreign magistrates, officials and employees will be avoided. 97. —(ii) As regards the Mixed Bar, the Egyptian Government will enable the lawyers in question to enter the national Bar at the end of the transitional period without restrictive conditions and with their existing seniority. (b) Extradition. 98. The Egyptian Government make the following declaration on extradi tion in the Final Act: In conformity with the practice generally adopted in regard to extradition, the Egyptian Government intends to adopt judicial procedure in this matter. It will, therefore, be necessary for the Mixed Tribunals to pronounce b upon the regularity of the request for extradition when such a request relates m to a foreigner within the jurisdiction of the said tribunals. (c) Literary and Industrial Property. 99. The report of the Drafting Committee contains the following statement on the subject of literary and industrial property and suppression of false marks of origin :— “ The committee, on the basis of an amendment put forward by the French delegation, proceeded to an exchange of views in the course of which the Egyptian delegation stated that their Government was, at present, preparing a law on the matter which will be inspired by the most liberal ideas, and that it would also consider the question of the possibility of Egypt’s accession to the Berne Convention, the Paris Convention and the Madrid Agreement.” The Independence of the Mixed Courts as regards their Internal Organisation and Control of the Bar, &amp;c.

With regard to (ii), Document A contained in the annex (article 2) a provision under which all Egyptian companies, in which there were foreign interests, would continue to be treated as ‘ ‘ foreigners ’ ’ unless there was a clause in their statutes submitting to the jurisdiction of the national courts, and it was stated that the Egyptian Government would declare that they would not insist on the insertion of such a clause in the case of any new company to be created. The point came up at a meeting of the Reglement Committee at which the United Kingdom delegation had already been obliged to play a very prominent part in requesting concession after concession from the Egyptian delegation, including requests on some points not covered by Document A. When this point was reached we again asked for a concession as regards companies, and our demand was immediately met by Bedawi Pasha agreeing to retain as justiciable before the Mixed Courts all existing companies in which foreign interests were represented. Bedawi Pasha went on to state that the concession met every legitimate demand as respecting all acquired rights, and that if new companies were created the persons responsible for incorporating them would proceed to this step with the knowledge that the companies were, for jurisdictional as well as for other purposes, Egyptian nationals. This half-way response to our demands was unexpected, but, while Bedawi Pasha was still speaking, a note was at once passed to the Egyptian delegation referring to the relevant passages of Document A, and pointing out that we were entitled to expect more than this and asking Makram Pasha to intervene before Bedawi had gone too far. (There is some reason to believe that Nahas and Makram did not at first realise that Bedawi’s speech did not correspond with Document A.) Unfortunately, while the discussions by private note were still going on Bedawi had finished speaking and the French and Belgian delegations immediately expressed the most fulsome and, in the circumstances, maladroit satisfaction with the Egyptian proposals. We were therefore faced with the alternative of again intervening in the debate, and saying that we were not satisfied with a concession which had already been welcomed by other delegations at a meeting where the United Kingdom delegation had been demanding and receiving concessions most of the morning or of remaining silent and insisting that the matter should be put right later. Ihe latter course was chosen, and at the end of the meeting Makram at once acknowledged the obligation of his delegation. It was put to him that he might urge his own people spontaneously to reconsider the matter on the ground that the result would be that after October next foreigners would incorporate th 61 -*’ companies in Cyprus or elsewhere instead of in Egypt, and the distinction won therefore only mean a loss of revenue to the Egyptian Government. When it came to the point, however, so much publicity had been given in the Egyptian press to the limited concession given and the Egyptian reasons for not extending i^ that Makram found it extremely difficult to be as good as his word; an i was clear that if the question was to be reopened it would have to be done y e United Kingdom delegation alone. The United Kingdom delegation in priva pressed their Egyptian colleagues as hard as they could on this pom , u unable to achieve success. The Egyptians made it clear that if as e lr , this further concession in public because it was in Document 1 ey thereafter decline at the request of anybody or in any circumstances e to advance a comma beyond Document A on any point, dney I’eterre fact that in many points we had ourselves asked for more, and ‘ to it. It was also clear that the United Kingdom instead of con the political advantage of being the ally which had helped Egyp 1 Jlwation proceedings—might thereafter be represented as the most ^ n at the conference. Another contributory cause of our failure 0 mra- concession was that the United Kingdom delegation were, as exp \r ori f r eux graph (b) below, seeking assurances about the relationship be we reached Convention and the Anglo-Egvptian Treaty of Alliance A P „ ^ where the United Kingdom delegation had to choose between P^ Sbin ° re ^ t one or the other, and it was the latter which they were ms ru interests all costs. Assurances were given to us privately that i a 7 facility will wished to incorporate companies before the 15th Octobei nex ^ benefit be given to them to do so and that these companies won, be kept in by being subject to Mixed Court jurisdiction.

As regards the first of these two p m although the text of the treaty, and of our amendment which was based o , not quite free from ambiguity, the Egyptian delegation agreed to di op after discussion with us. When Makram Pasha was reminded , ligation had been raised in the treaty negotiations and we had then said that tn &amp; , extended to legislation of all kinds and that fiscal legislation was on Y , as a particular and most important example, he loyally agreed to a 1 . * • ^ had been said at that time.

This was repoi e ^ 18th April immediately to the Foreign Office and to the Embassy a ^ )nmen t a telegram in which the Foreign Office were asked to urge the French *0 | n not to endeavour to insist on permanent guarantees in this or other ma , j n the telegram the view was expressed (for reasons which were (te ^- 0 . 11 office) a joint legal opinion by Mr. Besly and Mr. Beckett and sent to the loie D23 th t it was, in fact, more natural to read the provision of the treaty as being part fthe transitional regime. No action was taken on this matter for two days after the despatch of this telegram, but, on the 21 st April, it became necessary to submit the amendment to the General Committee. I did so in a prepared speech, the tPims of which had been to some extent concerted beforehand with the Egyptian delegation and the general lines of which had also been communicated to the French The Egyptian delegation accepted the amendment in a speech by Makram Pasha of the general lines of which, though not its exact words, we had also been informed beforehand. In my speech the following points were made ( 1 ) That the non-discrimination provision covered legislation of all kinds and was not confined to fiscal legislation. (21 That it prohibited discrimination in fact as well as in law. (3 That it must be interpreted in accordance with international practice and 1 decisions of the Permanent Court with regard to non-discrimination obligations of this kind. Reference was specifically made to a decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice with regard to the treatment of Polish nationals in Danzig, where the Permanent Court decided in the sense indicated in point ( 2 ). (41 That it was an obligation of a kind which a fully independent fetate possessing legislative sovereignty could perfectly well undertake. ( 5 s ) That as an obligation it should be confined to the transitional regime. /a\ That the fact that this obligation was limited to the twelve-year period did not mean that the Egyptian Government meant to adopt a policy of discrimination thereafter. On the contraij, their policy wojhd always be against discrimination, and to give effect to this policy thev wished to conclude before the end of the transitional regime bilatera reciprocal conventions with the different capitulatory Powers. 108. All these points were accepted by Makram Pasha in his speech who however, also made the point that the fact that a gi\en ega affected foreigners more than nationals was not alone su cien he gave legal provision was discriminatory. In order to illustra e is &amp; . various examples (which appeared to be unexceptionable) of taxation, the profession of broker in Egypt was at confined to foreigners, but this would not make it discrimination if the g„ P Government imposed a patente tax on the profession ot y^er, ^ ^ cneeches 109. It was generally accepted at the conference that these two s t &gt;eect^ should be of particular importance hereafter as regards e i p Pr ° V il0 n ' The Foreign Office in a telegram received^ two or three approved the attitude of the delegation in this matter as re^c themselves the Montreux Convention.

The provision in^he nrotocol really had'its origin in a totally unacceptable proposal of the EgStirddegation-a proposal,“however, which really had as its basis their mfnunum desire to get on record somewhere in the signed documents (o) that the ohSon must be interpreted in the light of general international practice; and ( 6 ) that it was an obligation which a State with full legislative sovereignty could undertake The actual provision in the protocol is if anything helpful rather to the side of the capitulatory Powers than to the Egyptians, since Danzig poTO legislative sovereignty within the limits of its Constitution, and it can there be shown that the decision of the Permanent Court with regard to Danzi applicable. The provision in the Final Act gives effect to the proposal which the United Kingdom delegation had induced the Egyptian delegation to accept, viz that the Egyptian Government should declare that they had no mten on o adopting the contrary policy of discrimination at the end of the transit . period. This declaration, though not creating a strict legal obligation su jec interpretation by the Permanent Court, is clearly of very considerable legal ana diplomatic value. . u rented 113. When these texts were all settled and the convention was bei ©P for signature on the final Saturday, the United Kingdom delegation a s obtain from the Egyptians the exchange of letters desired by ihe Foreign as regards the relation between the Montreux Convention and the Anglo- 0&gt; [ Treaty of xUlliance. The difficult discussions in the Drafting ^p mn ^ ltt€e non-discrimination had, of course, made it more difficult to obtain thebe . The Egyptian delegation maintained that they could not admit that the pro in the treaty imposed any legal obligation upon them as regards non-discii ^ tion lasting beyond the transitional period; and, although the letters w 1 wished them to sign merely left the point open, they were afraid of the iinp r which would be created in Egypt if any exchange of letters hitherto hep were revealed in Parliament here at a later date. They therefore propose ^ the letters should be published immediately, and that, in order to misinterpretation in Egypt, the initiative over this matter should appear o from them. The letters eventually exchanged between Nahas Pasha and were in satisfactory terms, and are reproduced in Annex 3 of this repoi . ^ at again, it must be remembered that no foreign delegation had any knowle g ^ there was any difference or discussion between the Foreign Office, the de g ^ and the Egyptians as to the meaning or effect of paragraph 6 of the an article 13 of the treaty or that these letters were exchanged. . , i oU t to 114.

(c) The Length of the Transitional Regime. The Replacement of Foreign Judges in the Mixed Tribunals of First Instance. Position of Sujets and Proteges of the Capitulatory Powers before the Mixed Courts. French Demands for Permanent Assurances and FjStablishment Clauses. 115. These four separate points were so closely linked in the negotiations that it is necessary to treat them together. In Document A a period of twelve years is accepted for the transitional regime, and the period is not subdivided, Egyptian replacements in the courts of first instance being accepted as from the beginning of the period. 116. As regards the sujets and proteges, Document A contains an Egyptian proposal that these classes of nationals should not be able to claim the jurisdiction of the Mixed Courts. The question is confusing because of the differences of terminology employed by different countries, but the idea was that only those nationals of the capitulatory Powers who possessed in the metropolitan territory full rights of citizenship should be justiciable by the Mixed Courts. The French have two classes of such subordinate nationals, under the terms ‘‘sujets’' and “protegds,” the Italians have colonial “sujets,” and His Majesty’s Government have “ British protected persons,” namely, the nationals of protectorates, protected States and mandated territories. The Egyptians had, in fact, begun by framing their proposal so as to exclude all nationals coming from colonies, even though they possessed the full right of citizenship in the metro politan territory. Discussion in January convinced them that this was quite impossible, but they retained the modified proposal indicated above. This proposal was not, as the footnote shows, accepted on behalf of His Majesty s Government during the discussions in Cairo. Later, however, after i n ^ T * departmental discussion in London, the Egyptian Government were informed that His Majesty’s Government would agree to it on condition that the other capitulatory Powers concerned also did so; but that if the proposal was resisted upon political grounds, His Majesty’s Government would not suppoit the Egyptian delegation in insisting on it. ' 117. His Majesty’s Government were naturally only prepared to accept any proposal on these lines which affected the “subordinate nationals oil ranee and Italy in the same manner as it affected British-protected persons. J-h e 0I 1 ^ other distinction which His Majesty’s Government would accept \vould consist in the exclusion of one class of British-protected persons, namely, Pales mians, who (like Syrians) do not, on the basis of the decisions of the Mixed Lourts themselves, enjoy the jurisdiction of the Mixed Courts at present, on the groun s that these territories were formerly part of the Ottoman Empire. 118. The Egyptians opened' the discussion regarding the duration ot me transitional period by demanding twelve years and stating rather aggressi y that that figure was final so far as they were concerned Ihe French delegation countered by suggesting eighteen years with a division thereof into ree p &gt; of which the last would be one of virtual Egyptianisation within the frames or °f the Mixed Courts system. They made no serious attempt to S 1 ' e r fj' , the choice of eighteen years, but said it was not final so far as F . concerned. The bad impression made by the Egyptian method o Pp s ° , , Proposal was minimised by a conciliatory rejoinder by Makram Pasha, a Portuguese and United States delegations supported the Egyp i , ‘ ears This enabled the United Kingdom delegation also to adhere to twelve v , without giving the impression that the length of the transitional period had already been privately agreed upon.

French delegation discussed this document with Nahas 1 as a eX citable Owing partly to the absence from the meeting of the com P etent i a j pman ds. Nahas Makram Pasha, but mainly to the excessiveness of the French ^ french, Pasha, in the course of a heated interview, flatly refused (accordin &amp; neX t day at least) to accept the memorandum even as a basis of discussion. further the leader of the French delegation, M. de Tessan, left for Paris ^legation instructions. (It is worth noting that for the second time the hgyp27 had bluntly refused to bargain at all on an important point.) The Foreign Office enquired whether they should urge the French Government not to be intransigent, but the delegation considered that in the existing situation their previous sugges tion was no longer appropriate, since the French, in their present mood, might be exasperated by an intervention on the part of His Majesty’s Government; it seemed preferable to confine action for the moment to mediation at Montreux. On the 27th April, M. de Tessan returned, and in the course of two days’ private negotiations with the Egyptians it was learnt unofficially from Makram Pasha that the outstanding points had been solved on the following lines:— (a) The French would accept the twelve-year transitional period without sub-division. (b) The French would drop their demand for settlement at Montreux of the principles to be embodied in their future establishment convention with Egypt, while the Egyptians promised to open negotiations with them on the subject this year and before negotiating with any other Power. (c) The Egyptians would agree, first, that all sujets and proteges established in Egypt before the coming into force of the transitional regime would benefit by the Mixed Court jurisdiction during that period, but that those who emigrated into Egypt later would not. (This compromise would have caused no difficulty to the United Kingdom delegation, as it applied to all British-protected persons and all French sujets and proteges equally, and was less than what His Majesty’s Government were prepared to accept if other delegations agreed to do likewise.) Secondly, that it would be provided that the Egyptian nationality law of 1929 would not apply to persons whose fathers were born in Egypt before 1929. 123. A session of the General Committee was therefore held on the 30th April to discuss these points. The committee agreed that the duration of the transitional period should be twelve years, but it was clear that the French had let slip here a concession which they might have obtained had they negotiated moie skilfully. The Norwegian, Swedish, Danish and Netherlands delegations openl} asked for a French lead in insisting on the division of the twelve years into periods, in the first of which there should be limitations on the replacement ot foreign judges by Egyptian judges in the Mixed Courts of first instance, ine French delegation had been strongly in favour of this earlier in the nego ia ions, and the Egyptians had let the United Kingdom delegation unders an a would, if necessary, make concessions on this point. The French, ow ^ ’ now got themselves into a position where they could not ask for it, an was that the Scandinavians and the Dutch had to fall into line. 124.

The Italian delegation referred to the King of Italy as Emper J Full Powers first problem was to ensure that the Committee for the y. ellfi / • t K eir re p 0 rt on should not create a difficult situation by referring to this poi persuaded the various credentials.

I PP er £, 1 ’ Kingdom and recognised de jure Italian sovereignty over Abyssinia, i /} e o p nvprnnl ents. the French delegations referred the point to their respecti\e ^ 132. The view of the Foreign Office was that it would . t j D convention should be signed without any reference ^ ein ? afterwards which case His Majesty’s Government would take tne n P however- necessary) that this signature did not imply any de jure recogm • ^ u n ited the French delegation were instructed to take / i A i po .’ a tion wanted Kingdom delegation should co-operate with them. The French S r ecogniti° D a slight additional support for the view that the question ot 7 chairman 0 ] had not been compromised, and, in conjunction with M. * 011 . ,1 v consider 60 the General Committee, they evolved a further P roce(iu r e , u^l^vention in tbese would assist later in maintaining that the signature ot tne A u vss inia. terms involved no form of recognition of the title of Emperoi o29 133. At the penultimate meeting of the General Committee M. Politis announced in an offhand way, as if merely condescending to give the meeting the benefit of his va.st experience in points of form at international conferences, that several delegations had asked him whether they could be held in any way responsible for the correctness of the descriptions of the heads of States, members of delegations, &amp;c., in the preamble of the convention and in the Final Act; he therefore took'this opportunity to say that each delegation was responsible solely for the correctness of their own descriptions and those of their own heads of States. This explanation was repeated again at the final meeting of the committee. 134. The Italian delegation did not take the point up at all. Either it escaped their notice, or else they were themselves glad of M. Politis’s declaration in view of the fact that another of the signatories of the Montreux instruments was the Spanish Government of Valencia, whom Italy does not recognise. (2) Position of Yugoslavia. 135. The Yugoslav representative at Geneva approached the United Kingdom delegation and stated that his Government had requested His Majesty’s Government and the French Government to look after their interests at this 136. The Yugoslav Charge d’Affaires in London had, in fact, approached the Foreign Office, but with a more restricted request, namely, that His Majesty’s Government should admit the Yugoslav contention of equality of rights with the capitulatory Powers, and should use their good offices for the definitive recognition of that contention at the conference. The Yugoslav Charge d’Affaires had been informed in reply that His Majesty’s Government would willingly use their good offices for the recognition that Yugoslav nations should, during the transitional regime be subject to the jurisdiction of the Mixed Courts as foreigners m the same manner as the nationals of the capitulatory Powers, and this assurance has been realised by paragraph 1 of the Egyptian declaration m the Final Act. It will be observed from the foregoing that the request of the Yugoslav Charge d’Affaires was, in fact, less comprehensive than that referred to by the Yugoslav representative at Geneva, and also that His Majest) s Governmen s rep y e slightly short of the assurance asked for, since they could not assert that Yugoslav nationals would be in the same position as nationals of the capitulatory Powers in absolutely every respect. A similar reply was returned by the delegation to tiie Yugoslav representative at Geneva. (3) The Position of Roumania. 137. The Roumanian Minister at The Hague approached the United Kingdom delegation with two requests : (a) That Roumanians shou S equal treatment with the nationals of capitulatory Powers during e period; and (5) that one of the new judges in the Mixed Courts should be Roumanian. (The Roumanian Minister in London made a sl “ 11 1 1 , ar .^fp^^ nian Foreign Office.) As regards the first point, M. Pella was to a subjects were amply covered by the terms of the Egyptian circ t eed Powers of the 3rd February, and, moreover, the Treaty of Ber m, &gt; § 1 n, them most-favoured-nation rights as regards capitulatory pnvi ^ paragraph 1 of the Egyptian declaration in the Final Act ^ request. As regards the second request he was merely told pressure taken thereof. (The delegation did not, in fact, feel justifie i g » on the Egyptians over this question.) (4) The Position of Albania. 138. The Albanians, like the nationals of certain i n c iyil Japan and Bulgaria, are subject to the jurisdiction of e ^ , Court juris- and commercial matters as the result of a decision ^v/rLprl Courts have no prudence, but in penal matters (in which the ^toveniment jurisdiction) they are subject to the native courts. , ,, , assimilated to tfiade a determined effort to ensure that their subjec s ag t y g wou i(j those of the capitulatory Powers during the transitiona p &gt; courts p ena l have entailed removing them from the jurisdiction f^ elves justified in matters, His Majesty’s Government did not consider themselves jus, T , „ rAvprnment on the subject. They informed the Albanian pressing the Egyptian G the j a p ane se and Bulgarian Governments), but Government accordingly ( the instrument signed at Montreux would not added that they would see subsequent inclusion of Albanian nationals present any legal ‘ 0 ^ e d Courts, should Egypt desire to do so as the within the .], urisd ! ct “ between herself and Albania.

The question of lunacy seems to require some special consideration. This Question has two aspects (i) the determination of the question whether a person m Egypt is a lunatic and, therefore, whether it is necessary that arrangements should be made for his detention and the removal from him of the conduct of his affairs and (ii) the effect of lunacy upon transactions concluded by a lunatic and the persons to whom any property which he may have m Egypt should be entrusted for custody and management. Of these two questions (ii) is clearly a matter of statut personnel. As a matter of principle (i) would not appear to come under this heading. It is suggested, however, that it would be convenient for the present purposes by an express provision to make (i) also part of statut personnel and o p ace le nu within the iurisdiction of the court having jurisdiction in statut personnel ft is, therefore, suggested that the R.O.J. should contain a provision express^ stating that the jurisdiction in lunacy of the statut personnel court should be deemed to include both questions (i) and (ii) above, but that as regar q () it should not be necessary to apply the law of the foreign nationality and tha for the purposes of question (i) the evidence of medical practitioners appoint by the procureur general for the purpose should always be o ame II.

This is, however, a peculiarity of English law. Tinder other legislative systems, it has, on the contrary, a purely administrative Character except that the judicial authority may intervene in the event of a disagreement as to the setting at liberty of a lunatic under confinement. S The“e would be no justification for making an exception to this general rule in E ffnder the present system, lunatics are confined in public establishments which are subject to strict supervision by the authorities and to ru es which render impossible any arbitrary or unduly prolonged detention. If a lunatic is confinedTa private or public establishment, anyone can ensure the intervention ami supervision of the Parquet by lodging a complaint on the grounds of illegal Mention or sequestration, without prejudice to any civil action for damages. The Egyptian Government proposes, moreover shortly to introduce a system relating to lunatics which will be based on the following principles: Lunatics will be confined in public or private establishments which must be authorised by the State and subject to its supervision. The confinement of lunatics will be supervised by a Council which will “Snal Court of Appeal and a mpresentative of the PuUic Sot'? autionl.ea Ministry of Poblic Health, and an order for his “i '*''™' 1 ' g Sd until after a period of observation.

By this mail you will receive a copy of an official despatch to the Canadian Commonwealth Union Government dealing both with the notification which it is desired to make under Article 9 of the Montreal Convention relating to the abolition of Capitulations in Egypt and with the consequent revised draft Egypt Order in Council. 2. The notification under Article 9 of the Convention should we think give no trouble and we hope that Dominion Governments in general will not have any comments on it. The notification c reates nothing new and will simply continue the existing Court. 3. Furthermore, the despatch includes a draft of revised Egypt Order in Council to replace the Egypt Ord^r in Council, 1930, which at present governs British consalar jurisdiction in Egypt. The semi-official letter to wmch I have already referred explains the reasons for tne mnn in which the new Order in Council has been draf and I ^UD, K.C.B. 11 3E0PPHEY WHISiLABI), K.C.M.G., C.B.

The first point is, of course, whether the Union will in fact agree, as Ur. Bodenstein agreed, (when discussing the question with us in London), to permit the necessary action to be taken by the United Kingdom Order in Council with a recital in it of the request and consent of the Union. Assuming that the Union will agree in principle, the next question from our pointof view is whether they will agree in practice without seeing the whole text of the Order in its final form. as you will see, the Order is very long consisting of 136 clauses and covers a great deal of technical matter which can scarcely be of interest to the Union Government. ly'rom the point of view of form the * Iff provisions of interest to the Union Government are those contained in the fifth Recital and clause 9j the terms of these provisions have been approved by the Attorney- General and can be regarded as a final dr^ft. hope that you will be able to get the assent of the Union on both these points at an early date. as you will see from our despatch the Foreign Office are anxious to have any replies from Dominion Governments by the 1st Septem at the latest. The Order has to be made before October and there is a lot of work required on it here. The Foreign Office think that there must oe few if any British subjects in Egypt who could be considered to be Unio nationals' whereas the total number of British subjects andall) only) and British protected persons in Egypt amounts to about 30,000 to 40,000. So that ifrom a practical point of vie* we feel that the Union Government ought not to maice difficulties over what is to them largely a theoretical quest ion* Canadian Should the Commonwealth Government comment Union on the inclusion in article 9 of the clause providing that jurisdiction is not to extend to cases where the national law to be applied is that of the Irish Free State you should refer them to the declaration made at the Montreux Conference by the representative of the Irish Free State of which a copy is enclosed. From this you will see that the Irish Free State Government desire that citizens of the Irish Free State shall appear before the Mixed Court and not the Consular Court. A similar Canada provision relating to the Commonwealth. the union of South Africa Canadian nationals would have the effect of depriving Australians Union nationals of the benefit of the jurisdiction of the Consular Court which they can claim as British Subjects and which Canada we understand that the C om monwealt h the Union have no desire to disclaim. Indeed, in the case of the Union, the privilege of retaining access to the Consular Court is the logio corollary of the Union’s signature of the Convent i unqualified by any such declaration as that made by Irish Free State Delegate*T^-i^o + inn made at the Montreux Ccnference by the representative Pec.iaL^-±-..- of 5 ' the Irish Free State. Mr. Cremins (Irish Free State): M. le president de la Confederation Helvetique, Mr. president, Excellencies. I have great pleasure in joining in the tributes which have been paid to His Excellency, the president of the Sv/iss Confederation, and in the expressions of gratitude to the authorities of the town of Montreux, and of the Canton, for the welcome and hospitality which they have extended to the delegations. I have also, on behalf of my Government, to offer my most sincere congratulations uo the Egyptian delegation, on the fruitful results for Egypt which the Conference has achieved. My country is happy to have had the honour of participating in a Conference for the achievement of results. Although the, Irish Free State was not a party to any of the treaties whereby the former regime of foreign capitulations in Egypt was created, Irish citizens succeeded to certain capitulatory rights by virtue of a number of treaties wni applied to our nationals at a time when our country * orined -^ a of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The Irish Free State has, however, never possessed, in fact ever washed to assert a right to its own ^onsu Egypt, and as one of the High Contracting Pax Convention, the Irish Free State does not propose Of any SU ch right, however limited, which the Convention may offer to its citizens. InIn the matter relating to personal status of its citizens, my country is, of course, anxious that its national laws should be applied not only in Egypt, but in every state throughout the world. IVe are, therefore, glad to know that, following the present Convention, provision is to be made by the Egyptian Legislature for the application by the Mixed Tribunals of Irish laws, to cases involving personal status of Irish Free State citizens.7X13/37 2% July, 1937.

With reference to Article 25, paragraph 1, of the Reglement d'organisation judiciaire, the Royal Egyptian Government has already decided to extend by decree the competence of the Mixed Tribunals to nationals of the following eight States: Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Roumania, Switzerland, Yugoslavia. 2. Non-discrimination rule. With reference to Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Convention and the Protocol relating thereto, the fact that the effect of the non-discrimination rule referred to in the above-mentioned Article 2 is limited to the duration of the transition period, does not imply any intention on the part of the Royal Egyptian Government to pursue thereafter in this matter any contrary policy of discrimination against foreigners. The Royal Egyptian Government is, moreover, prepared to conclude Establishment Treaties and Treaties of Friendship with the various Powers.e la person- otamment dans et 1 &amp; Turquie ( cette rnatioff ■ernement royal tatut personnel, gle de fond de a cette applies- suppression de it royal egyptien oire de 1’Egypte, :e Gouvemement oit d’expulsiona i mixtes qui aura , ni de lui refuser ment quitte, saul i pour un delit | ment; nature subversive quillite, la morale t. se en outre d'ins- I Itative dont fera x mixtes, en vue contestations an la personne dont sejour en Egypte, Ision est basee. — 54 — 3 . Personal status. The Royal Egyptian Government, having already and more particularly in the Establishment Treaties which it has concluded with Iran and Turkey, spontaneously adopted the principle that, in matters of personal status, the personal law should apply, intends to adopt the same principle with reaard thereto in the future. ° As regards the rules of procedure, which the Royal Egvntian Government intends to enact for cases of personal status these will be applied provided that no substantive rule of the foreign national law prevents their application. ^ 4 . Deportation. Although the abolition of Capitulations entails the removal of all the existing restrictions on the Royal Egyptian Govern ment’s right to deport foreigners who are within E«yptian territory, nevertheless that Government does not intend to exercise during the transition period its right of deportation in respect of a foreigner subject to the jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals, who shall have resided in Egypt for at least five years, or to refuse such a foreigner access to Egyptian territory if he has temporarily quitted that territory, unless : ( a ) he has been convicted in respect of a crime or misde meanour punishable by more than three months’ imprisonment, (b) he has been guilty of activities of a subversive nature or to the prejudice of public order or public tranquillity, moralitv or health, or (c) he is indigent and a burden upon the State. The Royal Egyptian Government further proposes to set up an administrative advisory committee, of which the Procurator General of the Mixed Tribunals shall be a member, for the purpose of examining any disputes on the subject of the identity or the nationality of the person whose deportation is under consideration, or of the length of his residence in Egypt, or of the existence of the facts which constitute the grounds for deportation.5. Extradition. In conformity with the practice generally adopted in regard to extradition, the Royal Egyptian Government intends to adopt judicial procedure in this matter. It will therefore be necessary for the Mixed Tribunals to pronounce upon the regula rity of the request for extradition when such request relates to a foreigner within the jurisdiction of the said Tribunals. 6. Clause relating to the jurisdiction to which disputes SHOULD BE SUBMITTED. With reference to Article 26 of the Reglement d'organisation judiciaire, the Royal Egyptian Government does not intend to insert in Government contracts (including contracts made by public administrations and municipalities) any clause relating to the jurisdiction to which disputes should be submitted. 7 . Judges, officials and members of the Bar. The Royal Egyptian Government does not intend to alter either the existing conditions of service or the present salaries of judges of the Mixed Tribunals. Similarly, the Government does not intend to alter the present salaries of officials and employees of the said Tribunals. It will give sympathetic consideration to their treatment in respect of grading, rules for increase of salary and promotion, when the new cadre now being considered is introduced. The case of any such officials and employees who may be retired at the end of the transition period will receive special consideration, the circumstances peculiar to each individual being taken into account. Should such circumstances justify it, certain advantages may be granted in the matter of the pension or compensation to be paid. As regards the pensions of foreign judges, officials and employees, the Government intends to ensure that they are not prejudiced by double taxation. Furthermore, in the case of advocates admitted to practise at the Mixed Bar the Egyptian Government intends to take the necessary measures to enable such advocates, at the end of the transition period, to obtain unconditionally the inscription of their names and the recognition of their professional seniority on the roll of the Order of Advocates practising in the National Tribunals.a) Leti Sir, As inform! and ch United that tl you th; in any mentio: date of6 Y A. — LETTRES SE RAPPORTANT AUX ETABLISSEMENTS (ASSOCIATIONS OU FONDATIONS) SCOLAIRES, MEDICAUX ET D’ASSISTANCE A. — LETTERS RELATING TO EDUCATIONAL, MEDICAL AND CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS (ASSOCIATIONS OR FOUNDATIONS) a) Letter from the President of the Egyptian Delegation to the President of the Delegation of the United States of America.

N. POLITIS AND APPROVED BY THE CONFERENCE ON MAY 5 TH AND 6 TH, 1937. The Drafting and Co-ordination Committee set up by the General Committee at its meeting on April 23rd began its work on April 26th, 1937 ; it held 16 meetings. It was composed of representatives of the delegations of the United Kingdom, P^gypt, France, Italy and Greece under the Chairmanship of M. Politis (Greece), and, in his absence, under that of M. Hansson (Norway). On more than one occasion the Committee availed itself of the power given it by the General Committee to invite a delegation, not represented on it, to take part in the consideration of a proposal which it had submitted. The task of the Committee was to examine, from the point of view of drafting, and to co-ordinate the texts of the Draft Rules concerning Judicial Organisation and of the Draft Conven tion, adopted at first reading by the two Committees of the Conference. The Drafting Committee’s terms of reference also included the task of examining from the technical standpoint the proposals submitted by various delegations whether directly to it or to either of the plenary Committees and referred to it by the latter, with a view to its deciding whether or not they should be inserted in the Acts of the Conference.Finally, the Committee was entrusted with the task of examining various suggestions submitted by the delegations and of drafting appropriate texts, where necessary for insertion in the said Acts. Using the Minutes as a basis, the Committee first examined the Draft Rules concerning Judicial Organisation, then the Draft Convention, and discussed, in connection with each Article, the proposals and suggestions relating thereto. Certain Articles were retained in the form approved at first reading by the competent Committee. Others were amended in conformity with the decisions taken by the Committees. Supplementary texts were adopted, in the form of new provisions inserted in the existing articles, in that of new articles or in that of declara tions, protocols and letters. Lastly, the Committee proceeded to co-ordinate the texts as a whole. The latter call for the following observations : A. “ R&amp;GLEMENT D’ORGANISATION JUDICIAIRE ”. I. Organisation and Composition. Article 1. This Article was retained in the form adopted by the Com mittee (P.V. 2, p. 7). Articles 2 and 3 (Formerly articles 2 and 2 bis). The Committee thought it advisable to devote Article 2 to the Mixed Court of Appeal and to make a separate Article 3 for the Tribunals of first instance. The text of the Egyptian proposal was therefore modified and supplemented by new provisions in order to take account of the decisions reached by the General Committee at its meeting on April 30th 1937 (P.V. 6 , p. 22 ). It is understood that the Egyptian Government will as far as possible continue the practice now followed in regard to theto have the matter reconsidered by the said General Assembly. If the latter maintained its proposals, there is every reason to assume that these would be ratified by the Court. Articles 8 to 13 (Formerly articles 7 to 12). Apart from a few purely formal changes, the Drafting Committee retained the texts as adopted by the Committee (P.V. 3 , p. 19 ; P.V. 4, p. 4). Article 14 (Formerly article 13). The Committee confined itself to simplifying the text adopted by the Plenary Committee (P.V. 4, p. 6 ). Article 15 (Formerly article 14). The text was retained with the modifications decided upon by the Committee (P.V. 4, p. 7). II. PARQUET. Article 16 (Formerly article 15). The text proposed reproduces that adopted by the Committee, with certain purely formal modifications (P.V. 4, p. 10) Article 17 (Formerly article 16). In accordance with the Committee’s decision (P.V. 4, p. 10), this text was revised and supplemented in order to establish the precedence of the Egyptian Advocate General. It is not intended to modify in a general way the rule in accordance with which the Parquet constitutes an indivisible judicial organ ; if, therefore, the Procurator General and the second Advocate General are prevented from discharging their duties, they will be replaced by the first Advocate General. Similarly, if the Procurator General and the first Advocate General are prevented from discharging their duties, they shall be replaced by the second Advocate General.Article 18 (Formerly article 16 bis). The Committee thought it advisable to make a separate Article of the last paragraph of Article 17 of the initial draft. It did not consider it necessary to include a special provision regarding the promotion of officials of the Parquet. It was, however, understood that the Egyptian Government intends to continue the current practice in this matter, as stated in the declaration by the Egyptian delegation recorded in the minutes of the meeting held by the Reglement Committee on April 19th, 1937 (P.V. 4, p. 11). Article 19 (Formerly article 16 ter). The Committee drafted this new Article on the basis of the provisions of Article 28 of the Reglement d'organisation judiciaire at present in force and those of Article 63 of the Reglement general judiciaire. It inserted the new Article in response to a suggestion made by the Portuguese delegation which was approved by the Committee and referred to the Drafting Committee (P.V. 4, p. 121. K sJ Article 20 (Formerly article 17). In view of the observations submitted to the Committee (P.V. 4, p. 12), the Drafting Committee proposes to make of the original Article 20 the second paragraph of the new Article 20. Article 21 (Formerly article 17 bis). This new Article was inserted in response to a proposal made by the United Kingdom delegation (Document C.C.M./C.G./ll). Article 22 (Formerly article 17 ter). In this new Article, the Committee retained, with slight modifications in drafting, the first two paragraphs of the text of a proposal by the United States delegation, as amended by the ad hoc sub-committee and adopted by the Reglement Committee (P.V. 8 , p. 2 ). Yiw i , ^ 4a — 7 — The other two paragraphs of the same text are the subject of Article 49. Article 23 (Formerly article 18). p. The text of this Article has been simplified in accordance with the decision taken by the Committee (P.V. 4, p. 16). The text adopted will enable the members of the “ Ministere public ” to sit henceforth only when they consider their presence necessary in the interests of justice, provided that the case is not one in regard to which they are obliged to give an opinion. Article 24 (Formerly article 19). In conformity with the Committee’s decision (P.V. 4, p. 17), the Drafting Committee deleted the clause concerning with drawals from the Government deposit and consignment office. Formerly Article 20. See formerly Article 17. III. COMPETENCE. Article 25 (Formerly article 21). The Drafting Committee drew up a new text for paragraph 1 of this Article in connection with which there will now be no list annexed. The formula adopted in the last phrase of this text does not exclude stateless persons. When stipulation in paragraph 4 that the Egyptian tribunals dealing matters of personal status shall continue to function under the same conditions as in the past, it was understood that these expressions do not imply any immobilisation of the judicial organisation in matters relating to personal status, but that the said tribunals will deal with cases not by consular delegation, but in virtue of their own powers.— 8 — A. Competence in Civil and Commercial Matters Article 26 (Formerly article 22). The text of this Article was retained, with slight modifications in the form adopted by the Committee (P.V. 5 , p. 3 ). In this connection, the Committee examined the proposal by the United Kingdom delegation to include in the Reglement d’organisation jucliciaire two special Articles reproducing the provisions of Articles 13 and 14 of the Mixed Civil Code. It came to the conclusion that there was no need to insert the said provisions, which belong by their nature to the Mixed Civil Code, and that it was sufficient to take note of the declaration made to the Drafting Committee by the Egyptian delegation to the effect that the Egyptian Government does not intend to modify the texts in question. Articles 27 to 32 (Formerly articles 23 to 23 sexier). The Committee retained with slight modifications the texts of these Articles as drawn up by the ad hoc sub-committee and adopted by the Reglement Committee (P.V. 6 , p. 3 and P.V. 7 , p. 2 ). It is understood that the term “ incapacity ” used in these Articles covers all cases of incapacity, including lunacy with or without interdiction. The United Kingdom delegation’s proposal in document C.C.M./C.R.O.J ./2 was withdrawn following the observations made by the Egyptian delegation in Document C.C.M./C.R.O.J./12. In adopting the provisions of Article 29 concerning the foreign national law to be applied in the various matters relating to personal status, the Committee wished to refer strictly to questions of personal status and not to other questions which might incidentally arise in the course of litigation relating to personal status. It is further understood that the term “ law ” is to be taken not in the sense of formal laws but in that of law in general.Article 33 (Formerly article 24). This Article was retained in the form adopted by the Committee (P.V. 5, p. 23). ♦ Articles 34 and 35 (Formerly articles 24 bis and 24 ter). These new Articles embody the declaration by the Egyptian delegation in which the latter agreed to make an exception to the general principle laid down in Article 33 in respect, on the one hand, of Egyptian corporate bodies in which foreigners possess substantial interests and, on the other, of mixed bank ruptcies (P.V. 5, p. 21). It is understood that the term „ substantial ” used in Article 34 means that the interests concerned are neither of a trivial nor of a fictitious nature. It shall be left to jurisprudence to decide upon that question. In regard to Article 35, it is, moreover, understood that the transfer of jurisdiction in matters relating to bankruptcy shall take place on the day when a foreign creditor enters an appea rance. Article 36 (Formerly article 25). The Drafting Committee retained the text adopted by the Committee (P.V. 5, p. 23). Article 37 (Formerly article 26). The new text of this Article was drawn up by the Committee in harmony with Article 5 of the Draft Convention as adopted by the General Committee. Article 38 (Formerly article 27). The first two paragraphs were retained in the form adopted by the Reglement Committee. A third paragraph was inserted in accordance with the proposal submitted to that effect by the Greek delegation and referred to the Drafting Committee (P.V. 5, p. 25). The rule proposed is, moreover, merely an application of the pauline action relating to Wakfs.10 — Article 39 (Formerly article 28). The text approved by the Reglement Committee (P.V. 5 , p. 25) was retained without change. * Article 40 (Formerly article 29). The Committee thought it advisable to supplement the second paragraph of this article by a provision allowing the tribunal to admit proof to the contrary. It added a third paragraph in accordance with a pro posal concerning endorsement of negotiable instruments which M. Roussos laid before the Reglement Committee and which it referred to the Drafting Committee. (P.V. 5 , p. 23...). It was understood that this article refers only to cessions the object ol which is to avoid the jurisdiction of the National Tribunals and not to legitimate cessions the ejject of which is a change in jurisdiction. The last paragraph of the article was inserted on the proposal of the Egyptian delegation to cover the case of irregular endor sements or endorsements for purposes of collection. The natio nality of the endorsee constituted by such endorsement for purposes of collection cannot, in fact, determine the competence of the tribunal. Article 41 (Formerly article 30). The Drafting Committee thought it should amend the text adopted at first reading by the Committee (P.V. 5, p. 27) so as to enable proceedings already instituted before the Mixed Tribunals to be continued should the parties thereto agree, even when the party whose existence gave the case a mixed character is no longer a party to the proceedings. Article 42 (Formerly article 31). I he Drafting Committee retained the text adopted by the Committee (P.V. 5, p. 27) without alteration.11 Article 43 (Formerly article 32). ♦ ims amcie was retained m the form adopted by the Com mittee, in the light of the observations made at the plenar meeting (P.V. 5, pp. 4 to 19) from which it appears : ( 1 ) that the expression „ laws and regulations ” should be understood as covering also provisions of treaties of a nature such that they had to be transformed by the Egyptian Govern ment into a text of municipal law ; ( 2 ) that the term „ violation ” should be taken to mean not only violations of the letter but also violations of the spirit of the law. p It is further understood that the prohibition of decisions as to the validity of the application of Egyptian laws or regula tions to foreigners entails, as a consequence, the prohibiten of consideration as to whether Egyptian laws are inconsistent with the principles generally adopted in modern legislations or whether they discriminate against foreigners. Article 44 (Formerly article 331. The text of this article was approved by the Committee at first reading (P.V. 6 , p. 29). Article 45 (Formerly article 34). In accordance with the promise made in plenary meeting (P.V. 6 , p. 29), the Egyptian delegation, after consideration, accepted the insertion in this article of a new clause bringing within the competence of the Mixed Tribunals crimes and misdemeanours arising out of reckless or fraudulent bankruptcy in the case of mixed bankruptcy proceedings. Article 46 (Formerly article 34 bis). This new article was inserted on the proposal of the Eevotian delegation. F It is understood that the Egyptian Government may consider the introduction of new provisions concerning appeals in correc tional matters.— 12 — Article 47 (Formerly article 34 ter). This new article embodies a proposal by the United States delegation. . Article 48 (Formerly article 34 quatert. This new article was inserted on the proposal of the Egyptian delegation, following upon the discussion which took nlace in the Committee (P.V. 6 , p. 22). Article 49 (Formerly article 34 quinter). The first paragraph of this new article was inserted, at the request of the United Kingdom delegation, in order to’ specify the guarantees which the „ Code destruction criminelle mixte ” provides concerning the arrest of foreigners. The last two paragraphs reproduce the rules set forth in a United States proposal which was approved in principle by the Committee and referred to the Drafting Committee. They merely reproduce a current rule of international practice. Article 50 (Formerly article 34 sexier). This is a new article inserted on the proposal of the Egyptian delegation, following upon the discussion which took place in the Committee (P.V. 6 , p. 22). IV. General and Transitory Provisions. Article 51 (Formerly article 35). The Drafting Committee adopted the text approved by the Committee (P.V. 6 , p. 29) without alteration. Formerly article 36. The Committee thought this article was superfluous and decided to delete it.— 13 — Article 52 (Formerly article 37 ). The Drafting Committee retained the text adopted by the Committee (P.V. 6 , p. 30). Formerly article 38. This article had been deleted on the decision of the nlenarv Committee (P.V. 6 , p. 30). Formerly article 39. The Drafting Committee decided to delete this article. Article 53 (Formerly articles 40 and 41). The Drafting Committee slightly simplified the first paragraph of Article 53 (Formerly article 40) as adopted by the Committee (P.V. 6 , p. 31). It further decided to introduce the text of the old Article 41 as a new paragraph of this article. Article 54 (Formerly article 42). The Drafting Committee thought it should amend this article in order to make its purport clear. Article 55 (Formerly article 43). The Drafting Committee retained with some slight modifi cations this text which had been referred to it for consideration by the Committee (P.V. 7, p. 3), and which merely applies a general rule to the Mixed Tribunals. Article 56 (Formerly article 43 bis). This new article was drawn up in order to take account of a proposal submitted to the Drafting Committee by the United Kingdom delegation.Article 57 (Formerly article 44). sous-comite '■V. 8, p. 2). The Drafting Committee retained the text proposed by the ad hoc sub-committee and adopted by the Heglement Committee (P.V. 8 , p. 2). i Article 58 (Formerly article 45 ). This article calls for no observations. lPITULATIONS icle et I’avait 17). js delegations jet. al, comporte arrangement a Convention u’il avait ete e a la Conven- ites et autres es.

Article 1. The General Committee had adopted this Article in principle and had referred it to the Drafting Committee (P.V. 2 , p. 26) The variants proposed having been withdrawn by the dele gations concerned, the Drafting Committee agreed to the text given in the draft. This provision, which is of a general nature, involves of necessity, the abrogation of all treaties, instruments, arrangements or usages which would be contrary to the provisions of the Convention. In this connection, the Committee wishes to state that a proposal was laid before it to annex to the Convention a list (Document C.C.M./C.G./IS'* of the treaties and other international instruments thus abrogated. This suggestion was not followed by the Committee because certain delegations preferred merely to adopt the general formula contained in Article 1, while certain others were not in a position to undertake the examination of the list in question. Article 2. The original text of this Article has been retained by the Committee in the form adopted at first reading by the General Committee at its meeting on April 23rd, 1937 (P.V. 5). The Committee decided to insert two new paragraphs, the first based on the amendment proposed by the United Kingdom— 15 — delegation (Document C.C.M./C.G./l) with a view to the insertion of a non-discrimination clause and the second on the counter proposal by the Egyptian delegation (C.C.M./C.G./ 8 ). The text drawn up is that of the counter-proposal in question with the addition of a phrase concerning,, companies incorporated /Tin accordance with Egyptian law wherein foreigners are substan tially interested The Committee did not think it necessary to make special mention of foreign companies, since it considered that these are covered by the term „ foreigners In the framing of this text, account was taken of the fact that among the principles generally adopted in modern legisla tions, which are referred to in paragraph 2 of the text, should certainly be included the rule concerning respect for legally acquired rights. It is, moreover, understood that the non-discrimination rule set forth in paragraph 2 of the new text, although considered more especially in regard to its application to fiscal matters, is a rule of a general nature. The term ,, legislation ” used in Article 2 is to be taken in the wide sense which it bears in English. Article 3. Retained in the form adopted at first reading by the General Committee (P.V. 6 , p. 13). Article 4. This Article had been adopted at first reading by the General Committee (P.V. 5, p. 28). The Committee deleted the second sentence of this Article, as it thought it unnecessary. Formerly Article 5. This Article had been deleted by the General Committee (P.V. 3, p. 5). Article 5 (Formerly article 6 ). The Committee thought it superfluous to reproduce in this Article, with reference to the National Tribunals, the rules— 16 — laid down for the Mixed Tribunals in Article 37 of the draft Rules concerning Judicial Organisation. It thought it preferable to restrict itself to a reference to the said Article by providing that the same rules should be applied by the National Courts in the matter of subsidiary actions. % Article 6 (Formerly article 6 bis). This Article corresponds to Article 45 of the draft Reglemenl d’organisation judiciaire. Article 7 (Formerly article 6 ter). This new Article reproduces Article 42 of the draft Rules concerning Judicial Organisation. Article 8 (Formerly article 7). The Committee retained the substance of the text referred to it by the General Committee (P.V. 4, p. 14) merely modifying the wording in order to take account of the insertion of new Articles. Article 9 (Formerly article 7 bis). This new Article was inserted in the form proposed by the Egyptian delegation which took account in its draft of a proposal laid before the General Committee by the British, French, Greek and Italian delegations (P.V. 4, p. 12). It is understood that the National Tribunals to which cases relating to personal status must be transferred in virtue of paragraph 4 are the National Civil Tribunals, without prejudice to any special agreements which Egypt and certain Powers might conclude if they deemed it necessary. It is further understood that the fourth paragraph refers only to suits pending before the Consular Courts in Egypt and that suits pending appeal or in cassation before a court in another country will be pursued before the national jurisdiction according to the rules of procedure of the country concerned.Article 10 (ancien article 7 tef).

This new Article was inserted on the Egyptian Delegation’s proposal. It is understood that a Consular Court is free to apply any law which it thinks appiopiiate when dealing with a case coming within its jurisdiction in virtue of Articles 8 and 9 . Article 11 (Formerly article 7 quater). This new Article was drawn up by the Drafting Committee on the basis of the proposals submitted by the Egyptian and French delegations. Article 12 (Formerly article 8 ). The first part of this Article was retained in the form adopted at first reading by the General Committee (P.V. 4, p. 14). The second part was replaced by a second paragraph which takes account of the amendment proposed by the United States delegation (Document C.C.M./C.G./9). It goes without saying that this paragraph is to be interpreted without prejudice to the right of consulates to collect fees for the copies supplied by them. * * * Literary and industrial property. In regard to the protection of literary and industrial property and the suppression of false marks of origin, the Committee, on the basis of a suggestion put forward by the French delegation, proceeded to an exchange of views in the course of which the Egyptian delegation stated that the Royal Egyptian Government was at present preparing a law on the matter which will be inspired by the most liberal ideas, and that it will also consider the question of the possibility of Egypt’s accession to the Berne Convention, the Paris Convention and the Madrid Agreement.mm — 18 — FINAL PROVISIONS. Article 13 (Formerly article 9). * The Committee retained the text of the original draft as the first paragraph of this Article. The second paragraph was drafted in agreement with the United States delegation in place of the additional text proposed by that delegation (Document C.C.M./C.G./ 2 ). Article 14 (Formerly article 10). The Committee retained the text adopted at first reading by the General Committee (P.V. 4, p. 16), with merely the modifications required by the fact that there is only one annex to the Convention. It was understood that, apart from this annex, all other texts forming an integral part of the Convention will be drawn up in the two languages, English and French. Article 15 (Formerly articles 11 and 12). The Committee agreed with the United States delegation’s proposal to substitute the single text submitted by it for the old Articles 11 and 12 (Document C.C.M./C.G./10). The Committee, however, decided to raise the minimum of ratifications necessary for the entry into force of the Convention from two to three. III. PROTOCOL. The Committee proceeded to an exchange of views on the interpretation of the non-discrimination clause applicable during the transition period, as given in the minutes of the General Committee (P.V. 4, pp. 17 to 18 ; P.V. 5, pp. 8 to 23). As a result of this exchange of views, it though fit to insert a special text to that effect in the Protocol.IV. DECLARA1 ION B\ THE ROYAL EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT. 1. Competence of the Mixed Tribunals. This declaration indicates the manner in which the Egyptian Government intends to apply the rule embodied in Artirlo paragraph 1 , of the Reglement. 2. Non-discrimination rule. This declaration calls for no observation. Personal status. This declaration is based upon the ideas set out in a proposal by the United Kingdom, French, Greek and Italian delegations (Document C.C.M./C.G./7). 8 In regard to the text of this declaration the Egyptian dele gation explained that it understood the general tendency of private international law is oriented towards the suppression of reference to another national law. Deportation. This declaration was made by the Egyptian delegation in response to a suggestion made by the Netherlands delegation (C.R.C./4, page 9). The Egyptian delegation explained to the Committee that the expression « activites portant atteinte a la tranquillite », was to be understood as meaning not isolated acts disturbing public tranquillity, but a series of repeated acts, that is to say, a continued form of conduct presenting such a character. 5. Extradition. 1 his declaration takes account of a suggestion by the Belgian delegation.— 20 — 6. Clause relating to the jurisdiction to which disputes SHOULD BE SUBMITTED. In this declaration, the Egyptian delegation took account ^of the wish expressed by several delegations in the discussion jn Article 26 by the Reglement Committee (P.V. 5 , p. 2). 7. Judges officials and members of the Bar. This declaration was made by the Egyptian delegation to take into account the observations and proposals made by the Norwegian delegation (C.R.C./4, p. 4) and the Danish, Nether lands and Swedish delegations (C.R.C./4, Addendum). This declaration gave satisfaction in respect of the points covered by it. V. LETTER CONCERNING EDUCATIONAL, MEDICAL AND CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS (ASSOCIATIONS OR FOUNDATIONS). The Egyptian Government declared its intention to maintain these institutions. As, however, the question does not interest all the Contracting Parties, it was agreed to deal with the matter by an exchange of letters between the Egyptian delegation, on the one hand, and the delegations interested on the other. The text drawn up to this effect by the Committee clearly explains the character and the extent of the understanding which was reached. As regards the titles and qualifications of the staff of the institutions referred to, no other conditions will, of course, be required than those prescribed by the Egyptian laws at present applicable.FOiEIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. - May 28th, 1937. y* 3^ Dear Clauson, I enclose for the benefit of India a copy of the instruments produced at the Montreux Conference.

Native ex-Ottoman mandated territories and protected persons of Egyptian nationality are excluded from mixed court (exclusion mandate in general is thus dropped), B.

Makram added very confidentially that in the last resort Egyptians would give way on penal matters also. In that event protected persons would in fact he saved hut there would remain theoretica discrimination in favour of Sujets. Male ram gave me to und^- stand that he was in consultation with the French over this and specifically referred to Garre an French Counsellor ficm Cairo. 2. Later Chargueraud and Lagarde ol the French delegation approached Mr. Beckett and myself saying that they had asxed f or support of the French Embassy in London. We told them of2 . of the substance of paragraph 1 above and they said there had been no discussions at all between them and the Egyptians since Friday's meeting of the general commission but that they had heard u indirectly fr of the option proposal. They said that while they agreed with us that 'hf' was Quite harmless they could, not agree to any solution which would mean even in theory that Tuni; ians would be inferior to Libyans and Ethiopians. This would be grotesque result of all their efforts on behalf of their protected persons. lifter private consultation between Mr. Beckett and myself we informed them that we believed His Majesty's Government would support French Government in this contention and that if French delegation were prepared to refuse all further discussion of compromises on the position of protected persons as distinct from dujets our delegation would support them pending your confirmation, we said chat we would report this to you for confirmation and would maintain attitude unless and until you gave us instructions to the contrary. Unless the Egyptians agreed to delete paragraph 2 of article 21 in its present form and substitute harmless rhetoric of 'A' work of conference would have to go on leaving this point reserved if necessary until the moment of signature and neither French nor United Kingdom delegations would sign if no solution were reached by then. Chargueraud and Lagarde undertook on behalf of their delegation to engage in no further compromise on this point an d I am about to inform Egyptians that on our instructions in accordance with Captain Wallace’s letter we feel bound to support the French pending instructions from ,/ou. while we shall avo ia irrevocable commitments and while it is for nis majesty s Go vernmentGovernment to decide whether we can agree to distinction even theoretically which places Italian Sujets in more favoured position than British protected persons we expressed our personal opinion for your guidance that we think it unlikely that Egyptians will really allow conference to break down on this issue though we cannot of course guarantee this and we further feel it is wrong to give way on a view which has been definitely stated in writing by Captain Wallace.

In matters of statut personnel it is admitted that nonammedans and even Christians of above country will belong to Egyptian religious courts (as they are excepted in their own countries)”. Three has the effect of excluding ex-Ottoman mandated territories only. Makram explains that these are to be understood as the only exceptions to the general rule that ‘'etrangers' 1 are nessortissants of the Powers concerned i. e. that all Citoyens Sujets2 , Sujets, Sudditi or Proteges (including men.da.ted persons other than those referred to among exceptions) will come automatically under Ire mixed court aid as far as mandates are concerned he appears to have met as. I said that I would report this proposal but that pending instructions we were precluded from discussing any solution other than paragraph 2 as it stood or its complete omission, rie toio. me that Ahlam hah or and Garreau had in fact had discussions since Friday 5 s meeting and that the latter had agreed to (4) of his text.

It will be observed proposal would theoretically affect not merely British protected persons but also British subjects. It would be useful to know whether His Majesty’s Government could accept points 1 and 5 (point 2 referring only to Egyptians is obviously acceptable) on assumption that all other colonial powers accepted it too. Alternatively [? would we] accept if number 1 read M the majority of which are Moslems and speak Arabic 1 which would apparently exclude India an alternative which might possibly be obtained without our appearing to enter into discussion of this proposal. Point number 4 is a completely futile one to us though apparently something of the kind was agreed to some days ago with french, we do not know whether for bilateral or general applica tion. Complications of this point are so great especially having regard to reservation of statut personnel that it seems difficult to believe His Majesty’s Government could d.ecide in iive days to accept it* A.s . 0 »As regards 'B' in paragraph 1 of our telegram No. 16 Makram now tells us that for penal matters persons referred to in point 1 of his new formula reported in our telegram No. 17 would he justiciable in mixed court without question.

Our telegram No* 18. Bad atmosphere in French-Egyptian relations is stiffen ing the attitude of both parties. French to whom we showed new formula last night (they professed not to have seen it though Makram alleged that he and Ahmed Maher showed it to Garreau on Sunday and that he personally accepted it) tell us that it is completely unacceptable. Ifnen asked if they would stand out if His Majesty’s Government were able to accept they replied that urgent request will be made in London that we should not do so. Makram on the other hand declared that the Egyptians can retire no further as regards recognition of French T' rthern Africas and are prepared for breakdown on this issue though he fully admits they agreed to give up substance. Over-strain of chief working delegates and the obstinacy of Ahmed Maher are the contributory factors and the chances of abandonment of this childish insistence of some reference to African neighbours are certainly no more than even. While Egyptians concentrate nain anger onfFrench Delegation [?accusing] them 01 every ^ind of bad faith they also express profound sorrow at cur frot accepting their new formula and say French have declined . discuss on grounds that we will not look at it. (French this.) if breakdown were to occur over this point we shallshall have to exercise all care to avoid responsibility for it being fastened on us in fgypt. Yfe should in the long run be more blamed than the French owing to our special position. This atmosphere is making Egyptians more difficult both in drafting Committee and private uiscussions.

Agree- rienb was exactly in accordance with Docu 'Ont A except that the possibility of adding two new members to Court of Appeal, one .jgypcian and one loreign, was to be provided for. In this way tne lirst point of agreement between French and Ngyptians described in my telegram No. 14 was carried out and meeting adjourned in most cordial and hopeful atmosphere after having begun but not finished the discussion of Article 21 of the R.O.J, On paragraph 1 there was no great difficulty of principle,apart irorn Norwegian proposition that Russian refugees should be admitted to Nixed Court jurisdiction which the Ngyptians will not grant. Technical difficulties were left for solution by the drafting Committee. fhe Committee met again in the late afternoon having only the second paragraph of Article 21 to deal with and it was anticipated that the proceedings would go through automatically because French and Ngyptians had agreed beforehand, when the proceedings began, however, it at once became apparent ^ ila t this was not the case and that French and Ngyptians have entirely different recollections as to what their agreement was u pon this point and each now accuses the other of bad faith.2 . The French say that they never accepted the proposed compromise contained in point No« 5 of ay telegram No. 14 and that they had understood that the Egyptian delegation would itself propose the entire deletion of paragraph 2 of Article 21 at the beginning of the Meeting. The proposal in point No. 5 in ay telegram No. 14 of course caused no difficulty to us because it applied to all British protected persons and to all French su^ets and proteges equally, and was less than we were ourselves prepared to concede if other delegations agreed to do so too. In the course, however, of a most difficult debate in committee other solutions were proposed which would have been unacceptable to us including one whicn put sujets on a more favoured footing than proteges (protected persons) and in addition excluded all persons from mandated territories altogether. The South African delegation objected to this and we were also compelled to inter vene and make it clear that we could not accept this solution though of course there was no objection to excepting the natives of ex-Ottoman mandated merriteries who do not enjoy the juris diction of the mixed Courts at present. French delegation therefore have again mismanaged their bilateral conversations with Egyptians and have already more than lost ail the goodwill that they had obtained by the concessions us regards the .mixed Court's in the morning.

All their colonial nationals are sujets including their Ethiopian nationals, and therefore were covered without restriction; and the only discrimination was against persons who were labelled as prot6g6s whore it was proposed to exclude the natives of mandat- ’ territories altogether and at one stage of the debate to have restrictions on the native: ° f protected States. ie are now using our influence to get the Egyptians to agree to drop paragraph 2 of Article 21 altogether pointing out that we only accepted this on condition that all other lowers accepted it, and that we told them before the Conference tnai, if it ga^e rise to political difficulties, in our view this v ' as a point u P° n which they must give way.

My dear Prime Minister, Your Excellency .111 remember that, in the agreed record of the conclusions reached between Bedawi Pasha end Mr. Besly, and Mr.Beckett and Mr. Kelly, m their discussions of questions to be raised at Montreux, it was stated, under the heading of -Definition of Foreigner', 'There may be added a provision indicating that, for the 'purposes of this definition, the nationals of His Majesty 'The Kin*, Great Britain etc. do not include British 'protected persons, nationals of the French Republic do not 'include French sujets or prot&lt;Sggs . and the nationals of His 'Majesty the King of Italy do not include Italian suddltl' .

Dear Clauson, Many thanks for your letter of to-day, T.Z. 22 99/37 With reference to the last paragraph of your letter, I note what you say. Perhaps, however, in this connexion you may be interested to refer to correspondence between the India Office and the Foreign Office of a year or two ago in which, if my memory serves, we both came to the conclusion that it' would be possible for India to accede to a convention for the reciprocal enforcement of Judgments under an article referring to'bther members of the British Comnonwealth of Nations. Whether or not India has ever actually acceded to any convention dealing with any other matter under an accession article so worded I am afraid I am unable to say from memory. Yours sincerely, .J.

Do you agree, and if so, do you concur in the attached draft telegram to the Government of India? There is a small point which may be worth noting Sir Miles Lampson sent the Egyptian Government’s invitation to attend the Conference direct to the Govemmert of India. I suppose that it would really have been better for the invitation to have been sent through the foreign Office to this Office, and if you agree, I would propose to point this out to the Foreigi Office, lest a precedent might be established by default. 0 r f ^ ^ (/f //dT-V-tP *-&lt;* 6 M- &gt;/ ej i^wT- ' ^ I J - * 1 ) *-|.vprobable however that the course that they will take will be to yl yr \ P ut in tt not,e •Ither saying that they will agree to accept whatever the other Powers have agreed to or disinters a ting the me Ives from the whole matter.

This list should show therefore an Australian delegation with Captain I^uan Wallace opposite it and the delegation of the Union of South Africa in its proper alphabetical place. For the mooant the names of Hew Zealandenilhe Irish Free State should be inserted in their place but a blank left opposite. India sho^ild also be shown with Captain uan Wallace as its delegate. I suggest that a copy of this minute should be sent by post by Hr.

Oriental secretary has communicated views of His Majesty's Government and explanation of constitutional position in detail to the minister lor Foreign Affairs and 1 also took opportunity on March 3rd of mentioning the matter to the Prime Minister. They botn raised objections to proposal on the ground that it would make difficulties for the Egyptian Government with certain non-capitulatory Governments, e.g. , Roumania, Czechoslovakia and Poland who were claiming to be represented at the Conference. Minister for Foreign Affairs was afraid that the latter would be bound to argue that representation of Dominions would involve discrimination against them. Oriental Secretary after pointing out constitutional position of Dominions which could in no way be compared to that of oecession States said that unless former took part in Conference they might well lay claim to ca pitulatory rights even after surrender of such rights by United Kingdom. Minister for Foreign Affairs seemed to be shaken by this and said that he fully understood His Majesty's Government s Point of view and was anxious to do what he could to help. He suggested referring the matter to Bedawa. 2. Mr. Besly has now spoken to Bedawa who at first reacted a g a inst proposal as strongly as when first put to him by Mr. Beckett.Mr. Beckett. Mr. Besly however finally persuaded him that it was a technical necessity imposed by Bedawa asked if it would be sufficient for Bgypt to amplify invitation already sent officially to His Majesty's u-overnment by another note asking His Majesty’s Government to invite each of the dominions to Conference on Egypt’s behalf. Mr. Besly gathered that Bedawa did not mind ho 7 w this note was worded as long as Egypt did not have herself to address separate invitations to each Dominion.

Che status of Dominion Governments and the Government of India with regard to the capitulatory rights of His majesty The King is legally exactly the same as that of the United Kingdom Government. They have exactly the same right to be invited. They are Govern ments of a Capitulatory Power. Consequently the objections put forward on Egyptian side are not relevant. It is essential therefore that Egyptian Government should in vite them, but it is immaterial legally whether they do so by means of separate notes or by a single note requesting you to convey an invitation to the Governments of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, Union of South Africa, Irish Free State and India. I should prefer the former but am prepared not to insist upon it. I therefore approve the procedure suggested in the penultimate sentence of your telegram. fou should leave the Egyptian Government under no misapprehen sion as regards the facts stated in paragraph 1 above.

V ^ tf'S P.Z 17 71 *m - Department. E^rzj fl'OJk,, Please see the notes at P.Z. 807/37 on the question whether, in the Transitional period 'before the complete abolition ol the Capitulations in Egypt during which British subjects will be tried by the Mixed Courts, British Protected Persons should be similarly treated or should be subject to the Egyptian Courts. The Government of India’s views are given in their telegram of the 3rd March at P.Z.1509/37. They ask that if possible Indian States subjects and residents of tribal areas should be treated the same as British subjects in this respect (i.e. should be subject to the Mixed Court.) Meanwhile the matter has been the subject of detailed discussion at the Foreign Office (see the minutes of the meeting of 26th February) and the Colonial Office have subsequently agreed that in the light of the arguments adduced by the Foreign Olfice the proposal that British Protected Persons snould immediately become subject to the Egyptian Courts provided French 'sujfje^ts' and Italian 'subditi 1 ' are similarly treated - may be accepted. In these circumstances it hardly seems possible for us to stand out, despite the Government of India's view (which of course was expressed without full knowledge of the considerations involved). The arguments briefly are:- Against. !) it is an e^flished and^mportant^princip^e that t ^ ere h sh ^ d an ^ British Protected Persons, Sw r.P«“e“ » it repercussions.2) The proposal would merely benefit the Egyptians without any corresponding gain to H.M.G. DRA] In favour. 1) Palestinians and Trans Jordanians, who comprise the overwhelming majority of British Protected Persons in Egypt, are already subject to the Egyptian Courts (as being ex-Ottoman subjects). Therefore the proposal would in fact affect very few people indeed, of whom a negligible number woulc^ eyer come into Court. 2) The period in question is limited (12 years), 3) The proposal would not in any case take effect unless the French and Italians agree, which is by no means probable. 4) The circumstances are unique. The French might possibly cite the precedent in res^d to Morocco, but they could hardly do so if, as is probable, they resist the present proposal. Nowhere else could similar circumstances arise, so far as one can see. 5) H.M.G. will be giving very little up, whereas the Egyptians attach the greatest importance to the exclusion of French n sui^je#ts tI and Italian M subditi !t from the f1i'xr2 Courts, ihe policy of H.M.G. has been not 'co bargain with the Egyptians but to help them as allies and well- wishers, to find a modus operandi for the abolition of Capitulations. 0VERNMEN1 POLITK ✓ S*U.

J.Clauson, Esq., INDIA OFFICE./h SriCO u) or n;$*?rmi A jeeting was hold at the Foreign office on February 26 to discuss the question whether British protected persons should be subjected to the native Courts daring the transitional r^iue which is to follow the abolition of Capitulations in Egypt. The following were present:- Hb rr ii KR. DUMCAN, •Ci. BIGG * Foreign Office (in the Chair) Colonial Office me. azoK.m, MR. CLAUSGK, 'e. Bscmr, KB. SOKMS COCKS Boainions Office India Office Foreign Office MR. BTCiCiTP recapitulated the fact that there were two categories of privileged foreigners in Egypt. (1) Those who enjoyed Capitulatory rifjits, including the ’ ' ' ' tn ' * jurisdiction of tie f ixed Courts. (t) Those trtio enjoyed th sdiction of the ixed Courts only. As regards (1), r. Beckett explained that all British subjects enjoyed Capitulatory rights. ere we certain that, as a aatter of law, British protected persons enjoyed thea? In point of fact they had cone so and the -pyptian Governucnt had raised no objection but they had not expressly admitted it and were not until r cent discussions t ook place really aware of 'British protected persons as a class at all. Tatogory (2) Included all Capitulatory nationals plus the nationals of certain other countries. Before the ar the Misti Courts decided that every foreigner that was not an Ottotaaa national e&amp;ae under their jurisdiction. The .gyptiana did not like/Ute this mling, but h«d to acquiesce in It.’ , s result of the far tUrhlsh SM ,r.i n , y over £|!Jptltns ^ , and certain Turkish territories werp „n-u ++ ^ . ° ,/ere allotted to Great Britain and France under mandate. The Mixed + u , Mlxea courts then had to decide whether they had jurisdiction over Turks and ex-Turks, (e.g. Palestinians). They decided that they had wm. Mr. Beckett maintained that, if their pre-far view was’right, then their postwar ruling was wrong in law, at any rate as ' regards Palestinians etc., however wise it might have been politically. His Majesty's Government, however, acquiesced in the decision, and refrained from claiming Capitulatory rights for Palestinians and, in Mr. Beckett's view, it had a reaction on the Capitulatory rights of British protected persons. if British protected persons were entitled as such to Capitulatory rights, then the fact that Palestinians were former Ottoman subjects should be entirely immaterial. as, however. Bis Majesty's Government had acquiesced in the Mixed Courts' ruling, the case for British protected persons being entitled to Capitulatory rights was pro tanto weakened. The Mixed Courts '■’ere either unaware or rejected the view that Palestinians etc. might claim Mixed Court jurisdiction as Capitulatory nationals and treated the question as if they cane in class (2) rather indicating that all British protected persons came in class (2). MR. BIGG suggested that the case of Palestinians was a genuine exception, not only because they were ex-Ottoman subjects, but because they had never enjoyed Capitulatory rights before, or these reasons it night be said that His Majesty's Government had merely waived their rights in this particular case. MR. BECiJ^T'T answered that in point of fact we had not e kplicitly waived our rights. MR. DOUCAK /— -- - weEa e 'cen but onlntfllned tont it was no aore than tot. &lt;3 to • V » contlimixi ‘ his ny J-to .us expiations, then pointed out tot. vixen the Capitulations disappe^d, the t^itional Mixed Courts would have not only to civil Jurisdiction of the exists Mixed Courts, but the criatol Jurisdiction of to Consular Churls witich were to be abolished. tot categories of foret^ers should be entitled to the Jurisdiction of the transitional Mixed Co'-rts Should they be those who were at present enjoying Capitulatory rights, or those who enjoyed the jurisdiction of the present Mixed Courts, or should the definition enbody a comprise between the two The proposal solution agreed on between His Majesty's Government and the Kgyptian Govemnent was such a compromise* Mr* Beckett then stated the exact scope of the concessions proposed in Foreign Office letter of February 3rd (as modified by .tir* Connor Green’s letter of ftibi'mry 19th) [J 225/L3/16]* Very tev British nationals would in practice actually find then selves being brought before tiie native (Jourts instead of the hired Courts during the twelve years transitional period as a result of the proposed concession. (Bo question was now raised as s any class of British subjects. The Egyptians had given way on this. In fact not understanding British nationiilitj taey had thought 'British subjects' only covered natives of ibe United f ingdom and that all ' colonial nationals * were in the position in which British protected persons in fact are). Palestinians and Ti’ansjordanians were the only numerous category British protected persons to be found in gypt, and they were already subject to the native Courts. (Mr. Beckett explained Incidentally/incidentally that the proposal put forward in the Foreign office letter was intended to Bean that British protected person persons should the question;. ;.r. Beckett thought that there was no strong reason why His Majesty's dovernaent should insist on ®»int»ining the ^ixed Courts right* of these few British protected persons. * j and unless His ajesty’s Oovermaent gawe way the Egyptians would not be able to insist that the French and the Italians should give way about the rights of their su.lets. protd :ds and subditi . Incidentally, it was by no Beans certain that the French and the Its ians wauL give way ( taough, of course, Mr. lieckett could not I guarantee this), and, if they did not, His Majesty's Governaent would not have to sake a concession either, enquired whether His Majesty's Goveraacnt would press the French and tlie Italians to give way. ■0i« BFCdgfT replied that the pressure bright by His Majestyfe GoveriMent would not be very strong. On soae of the points to b« discussed at the Capitulations Conference ills Majesty's Govemaenl were prepared to support the gyptians to the utteraost. 7ne question of protected persons, sujets, etc., was not one of then. UK. BIGQ felt that the proposed concession aerely entailed giving up the rights of His Majesty's Oovernaent for the benefit of the Egyptians in their negotiations with the French and the Italians. ..r. Bigg enquired whether there were any ot»ier con cessions which His Majesty's Government could offer to tlie figyptians. UR. Br^ hVi' replied that the policy of His Majesty's Qovem- ®cnt in the recent discussions with the ligyptians was that tuere should be no barge inin.;, but rather an attetipt on the part of the two allies to find a nodus operandl for toe abolition of the Capitulations.wonderea ^ther this British concession could not oe held In reserve* ‘ li '-‘' **•* •‘““'f U wmu not bo rawlMe to to., tt. totnoh and Uto Italic m wltiiout comltting ourselres.

BI 1 ■- agreed thn t bits concessi®^! was ot no great practical importance. uhat mattered was toe question of principle. It was toe policy of the Colonial Office to en eavour to obtain the same prtvilt ;es both for British profc.cted persons and for British/U) British subjects. m aany cases they .ere the saae people in the same territory, and divided only by a narrow line. Therefore the proposed concession would mice an awkward precedent* ' A 28id that he ws a strong supporter in general of the Oolonial Office policy on this point, and he maiiita ine&lt;&gt; -hat the position would be safeguarded in tiie present case. lie pointed out (1) that the Capital a ions Convention would ex ressly state that only in this question of jurisdiction would there be any difference between British subjects and British protected persons, and (2) that the vast majority of British protected persons (i.e. Palestinians) affected already received different treatment from British subjects fn. U iu suggested that (2) was for an exceptional reason. -iR. B UKKTT replied that so was this an exceptional Case,r (r pointed out the ulfficultv th.» ^ ncuity that if ills Majesty a Govemaent pressed u,e , re M e M lwlm 0mrmmls ^ setter, .fere alsft .ell c . 5 „ ln ^ ^ ,rerot, sr.j uellens »ould tom or His Go.erment end Insist on dlfferertlel treeteent of Brltlel, , vi anusa protected persons because of the precedent in question. MR. 3EC:-.iSTT replied that this »*,« ^ .. wt. uus HUS true of Morocco where the French would no doubt take that Hr. w u «.aae tnat une, but he could not think of any other situation in which the suggested differential treatment could possibly arise. 1„ an y case the French and Italians could not take this line if they had resisted the proposal. ^ adde(i td&amp;t the ®ere fact that the concession was discussed at an international conference would giwe publicity to the distinction between British subjects and British protected persons, with the result that the latter sight in various countries be deprived of the privileges which they otherwise enjoy. This would be regrettable, particularly in view oi the Colonial Office policy mentioned above. Good reasons could undoubtedly be found why His Majesty 1 s Government had allowed differentiation in the present case, but the fact would remain that differentiation had been made. MR. Df: !' Ciii'i enquired whether there was any overwhelming reason which made it necessaiy that His l&amp;jesty*s Government should make this concession. kiu BKCKETT replied that there was no single reason, but t'h her a number of arguments which, taken together, appeared to the Foreign Office to be very strong: (a) the concessionA amounted to little in practice (as had been agreed earlier in the meetingIbj if the French and the Italians held out agairs; the concession, as they most likely would, nothing would come of it, (c) the concession might facilitate the negotiation of points which were really essential; it would majce it easier to get agreement at Montreux. if the French and Italians agreed, we could then if necessary, ress Egypt to give way in return for some other point: if the French and Italians refused, and Fgypt gave way to them we could use this as a ground to press the French and Italians to t ive way over something else. m- . C.A -. SELL added that (d) if the Conference broke down, the Egyptians mi&amp;ht denounce the Capitulations unilaterally, and the Capitulatory Powers would lose all their rights. The Egyptians had probably a fairly good legal case for denunciation, and might well have a good political case if the Conference broke down as a result of the unreasonableness of the l owers. •'ih. PU:CAK enquired whether :is Majesty's Government had any hold over the Egyptian Government to prevent them taking this action. MR. CA^i- BKbL replied that by the Anglo-E^yptian Treaty the Egyptians were only committed not to denounce the Capitulations until the Conference had been held* After that they were free, so far as their le&amp;al obligations to the United Kingdom were concerned. MR. BECKETT added that, in the circumstances foreshadowed, His Majesty’s Government ai^ht well have to a^ree to unilateraldenunciation. They a i*ht conceivably b et i0 ae sort of 6 uarar.tees for their national*, but this was by no means certain* MlkJMMl explained that toe India Office had at present ar. open mind on this subject. On the ore hand they felt as strongly as the Colonial Office urn the principle of no differentiation between British subjects and British protected persona should be maintained. On the other hand however, they were inclined to ft*ree with the Foreign Office that the present circumstances were entirely exce tionai. They were awaiting the views of the Govenment of India, and Mr, Qauson undertook to h&amp;ve &amp; reminder sent to Ux&amp;t Government. :jl*» - ( -v^ : explained that the Dominions Office had no objection to the ?ofei^n Office proposal as regards the protected , ersons under their jurisdiction, nor did he thin* that any of the Dominions would raise objection. MR. otJ'i'i A. : then discussed the particular question whether the definition proposed by Hr. Corner Green, in his letter mentioned above, for the classes of British persons who should be subjected to tilxed Court Jurisdiction would be adequate for its intended purpose. He agreed with the arguments In that letter that the definition v*&amp;s not water-tight, but that cases were not likely to arise in which locally naturalised British subjects, or nationals of a Dominion under Dominion legislation, would find thecsselves involved In litigation in Egypt, and that, if such cases did arise the f ixed Courts and the Egyptian authorities would not be likely to spot the distirctioa between these/these persons and British subjects proper. Mr. Duncan enquired however, what the attitude of His Majesty's Government would be if the Fixed Courts or the ligyptian authorities asked inconvenient questions. .a. B -0 '~. i replied tliat His Majesty* s Government could declare that person to be a British subject in such and such a territory, or else a national (or citizen) of such and such a Don inion, without adding that he was not a British subject in general. The Mixed Courts and the Egyptian authorities would not be likely to object. Mri. D’JijQAH thought that, if the Colonial Office could be satisfied on the question of principle, the definition proposed in Mr. Connor Green's letter would be adequate so far as they were concerned. IT WAS AQitHKD that the Colonial Office should submit the question of principle to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, together with the various arguments advanced in the present record of the meeting, with a view to an early decision.

Sir, I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a minute by the Oriental Secretary regarding a conversation of a reliable agent with the editor of two local French language newspapers on the subject of the Capitulations. 2. The French desideratum regarding the companies with interet mixte is safeguarded by our understanding with the Egyptian Government. It looks, however, as if there is going to be trouble about the distinction between citizens and subjects. It may quite well be difficult for the French to make an invidious distinction against Algerians. I have etc., (Signed) Miles W. Lampson Ambassador. ■ ae Sight Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., e tc., etc. , etc. i&gt;—GAPITULATIONS. A reliable agent informed me that he had recently had a conversation with M. Enkiri, editor of the ,, Partout ,, and 'Dimanche', which two papers are modestly financed by the German, Italian and Japanese Legations. Enkiri is producing a special number on Capitulations which is to show the extent of foreign interests in and assistance to Egypt. Enkiri said that from his conversations with the three above Legations ie gathered tnnt there was going to be considerable opposition at Montreux. M. Garreau had said that it was impossible for the French to accept the Egyptian thesis regarding Interet Mixte or the distinction between subjects and citizens. Admission of the first would involve handing over powerful French interests like the Credit Foncier to local jurisdiction. As regards the second point the French were already having serious trouble in Algeria provoked by Italian and German propaganda. It was impossible for them to incur further unpopularity in Algeria by making such an invidious distinction. Already the Algerians were going very much against the classification of citizens and subjects and arrangements were already being made to include a greater number of Algerians in the category of citizens in order to pacify them.

'The rights under the capitulatory treaties are the rights of The King. At the time the treaties were concluded The .ling acted only through one Government, the Government of the united kingdom, for the purposes of foreign affairs. Now, in addition to the Government of the United Kingdom, he acts through the Governments of the Dominions and the Government of India, all members of the League. Consequently in law the surrender of His Majesty's capitulatory ri ghts must be action taken by The King not merely through his Government in the United Kingdom, hut through his other Governments aD eve-mentioned. You should, explain furthermore that the absence f of separate invitations to each Dominion Government might cause the se.governments to feel that their status is international affairsis not fully recognised by Igypt. the same time it is thought unlikely that any of the dominion Governments will wish to he represented, though His kajesty’s Government in the United Kingdom cannot give any formal assurance to this effect. It is, in fact, prohahle that if t e matter is put to them in proper form they will merely intimate their acceptance of whatever the other governments represented at Montreux agree to. You should make it clear that the suggestion made hy the Egyptians to hr. Beckett, namely that the dominions should he represented not as separate units hut as part of a single British Empire Delegation is not in accordance with the present constitutional procedure of the British nnpire, nor in accordance with the practice at other conferences, and would inevitably lead to undesirable complications. Most convenient procedure for issue of invitations to Dominions would he that Egyptian Government should address to you separate notes in resoect of each nominion on which you could telegraph direct to Dominion Government.flLE COPY 5 o u ! j a 1937 y r , SECRET Cf)nftyl' dlM C-.Q J/ ; 7 Arc. gch/vh, (66 groupeo) 1166 COPIES OIRCULATiiD) D E!

The Treaties which have so far governed the enjoyment of Capitulatory rights have been the Treaties signed with the Ottoman Porte in 1675, 1809 and 1861. The scheme prepared by the negotiators of the Treaty provided for a Oonference of the interested countries and for discussions in advance of this Conference between the United Kingdom and Egypt, at which the two Governments should endeavour to agree upon the details of the transitional regime provided for in the Annex to Article 13 in order that Egypt might present to the conference proposals which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would feel able to support. A meeting was accordingly held with the Egyptian Treaty delegatee in London on the 28th August when a memorandum presented by the United Kingdom representatives was discussed. A copy of this memorandum and record of this meeting is enclosed marked I. a further memorandum was communicated uo the EgyptianEgyptian Government in TWcm* / ln uece ® b ^ (copy enclosed marked II), and conversations took place »+ n ^ v.

It will be seen from the last sub-paragraph of paragraph 3 of Paper III that a small paint was left undecided in the conversations in January in connexion with the definition of the word 'foreigner' for the purpose of the jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals in Egypt during the transitional regime fore-shadowed in paragraph 1 (ii) 0 f the Annex to Article 13 of the Treaty of Alliance. The existing Mixed Tribunals were instituted to supplement the consular courts provided for under the Capitulations and with a view to trying civil oases between Egyptians and foreigners or between foreigners of different nationalities. The meaning of the word 'foreigner' for the purpose of the jurisdiction of these tribunals has never been defined to the satisfaction of all parties, but Hie nixed courts decided before the war that foreigners for this purpose included not only the subjects of the Capitulatory Powers proper in these oases but also all persons who were not Ottoman nationals. On the other hand in criminal cases and in civil cases between persons of the same nationality the Mixed Courts neverhad any jurisdiction and where these persons were not capitulatory nationals, these cases came before the Egyptian native courts and where they were capitulatory nationals before the Consuiar Courts. After the war the Mixed Courts held that natives of Palestine and other ex Ottoman territories who had now become British or French protected persons were not foreigners and as a consequence capitulatoryvj? capitulatory rights hare not been 0 l»in h &lt; een claimed in respect of them This decision in fact weaken* tv, weakens the case for contending that protected nationala as a whnio cv. j e whole are capitulatory nationals although Consular jurisdiction has in f*«t as ln ;f aot continued to be exercised over British nrnt*„t... 811 P r °teoted persons other than Palestinians. 4. The scheme for the transitional regime l8 that the jurisdiction of the Consular courts shall pass to the Mixed Courts and owing to this discrepancy between the existing definition of 'foreigners' for the purpose of the Mixed Courts and for the purpose of Consular jurisdiction, it was a matter of some delicacy to reach agreement on the definition oi loreigners for use during the transitional regime, as regards non-capitulatory foreigners ay halfway solution was agreed which included the nationals of some ioreign countries and not those of others. In the course of the discussions in January the Egyptian representatives suggested that British protected persons and the French and Italian equivalents should not be covered by the definition. It was this proposal which was reserved in Document III for further consideration by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. From a practical point of view, the proposal would not appear to present any seriats disadvantages to His Majesty’s Government, as theonly British protected persons to be found in Egypt in any numbers are Palestinians who are, in accordance with the description given above, already subject to the Egyptian native courts. To the Egyptians, a concession on this point would be valuable as they are anxious to exclude natives of French and Italian territories in Africa and Asia from the jurisdiction of mixed courts during the transitional regime. It is accordingly at present .under . considerationV consideration whether the gg^Um Oorernment informed « Government inlhe r should not be for their part are prepared to convention but only 1 rora the definition of foreigner for the purpoeea of Hlxed ° 0urt Juri ® dlotlaa * British subjects including those oi siatio or African native origin would under the proposed arrangement enjoy the benefit of access to the mixed tribunals. o. airing the discussions at Cairo the Egyptian Government issued on the 16th January a note inviting the Governments of Capitulatory Powers to attend the Conferenoe at Montreux. A copy is attached marked IV, At the end of the discussions in Cairo they issued on February 3rd a furtha note containing their proposals for the transitional regime. A oopy is attached marked V. A comparison of Document V with Document III will show that the Egyptian note only sets out those proposals to which the Egyptian Government them selves attached importance, leaving the Powers to ask for guarantees in return.

[Wednesday 24th February.] MINUTE OR SUGGESTED REPLY. Mr. Eden: The Egyptian Government’s Note of 3rd February to the Capitulatory Powers in no way expresses an agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Egyptian Government. In this con nection I would refer my hon. Friend to the very full reply given on this subject bv my Noble Friend to the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Hopkm) on 9th February, in which the position of His Majesty’s Government with regard to this Note has already been stated.I do not know if you are dealing with Foreign Office letter No* J 225/13/16 of the 3rd February regarding a point arising irom the proposed abolition of the Capitulations in Egypt. if you are not, perhaps you will be kind enough to pass it on to whoever is.

On balance, therefore, we feel that our original definition is likely to raise many more complicated questions than it would avoid, and so we wish to substitute for it the plain words 'British subjects'.

MacDonald doubts whether the Dominions will in practice desire to be represented but he is of the opinion that their concurrence in the course proposed m paragraph 4 of Foreign Office letter of the 22nd January would be more readily forthcoming if they have first received and declined an invitation to participate in the Conference. In this connection he is disposed to agree that the procedure suggested of letters to the President of the Conference, on the analogy of the letters comnunicated by the Governments of Canada, New Zealand and the union of South Africa to the President of the Montreux Conference last year, would be the most suitable method by which the Dominion Governments could announce their intention no longer to claim any rights which they may possess under the earlier Treaties, 3. Mr* MacDonald would be glad, should Mr. Bden see no objection, if the Egyptian Government may accordingly be approached with a view to the issue of formal invitations to the Dominion Governments to be represented at the proposed Conference. 4 # With regard to Foreign Office letter of the 3rd February,A r- 3rd February I an to request you to inform Mr. Sden, that Mr. MacDonald concura in the suggestions made in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of that letter and subject to the concurrence of the other Departments concerned, he would propose to cormunlcate the substance of these paragraphs to the ominion Governments when the documents enclosed in Foreign Office letter of the 22nd January are sent to them. 6.

(You may if you think desirable leave with the authority with whom you speak a copy of the Treaty and a memorandum of the substance of your remarks).

After explaining that the Egyptian Government propose to issue shortly a further circular note making detailed proposals for the transitional regime . you should add that His Majesty's Government, though committed to the scheme in the annex to Article 13 of the Treaty, are not necessarily committed on all points of detail in this further Egyptian note. 3. You should go on to say that, as is well known, there is a strong desire in Egypt to abolish the capitulations unilaterally and moreover the Egyptian Government are convinced that they have a sound legal right to do so. While there can be no doubt that Egypt possesses the legal right to terminate the Mixed Courts at one year's notice, PI is Majesty's Government reserve for the present their attitude witPi regard to the unilateral abolition of the capitulations, both on the political and on the legal side of the question, since the Egyptian Government are committed by their Treaty with the United Kingdom not to attempt/attempt to denounce either the Mixed Courts or the capitulations until after the holding of the capitulations Conference and its eventual failure. His Majesty’s Government however, feel it their duty to intimate confidentially and witnout delay to the Government of the country in wnich you reside that it is oy no means clear that che iiigyp tian Government could not make a good legal case for a right to abolish the capitulations unilaterally. In these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government feel certain that the Governments of the capitulatory Powers will receive sympathetically the laudable willingness of the Egyptian Government to deal with the matter by negotiation and to offer a transitional regime giving guarantees to foreigners and affording a necessary period of transition from the capitulatory to the non-capitulatory era. It appears to His Majesty’s Government incontestable that more v/ill be achieved by a sympathetic reception of the Egyptian proposals than by an attitude of obstruction. (Sd.)

S.W. 1. 3rd February, 1937. . Sir, .fP Dominions OfVice ' 6 ^ 1 ' 61106 t0 Pore:L S ri Office letter to the /No. J 9242/90/16 of the 22nd January,copy of which was transmitted to the India Office on the 23rd January, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to request you to draw the attention of the Marquess of Zetland to the following point arising from the proposed abolition of the capitulations in Sgypt. It will be observed from paragraph 8 (i) of the Annex to Article 13 of the Anglo-Egj’ptian Treaty of the 26th August 1936 (Cmd. 5270) that one of the questions to be decided is the definition of the word 'foreigner' for the purpose of the jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals during the transitional regime foreshadowed in paragraph 1 (ii) of the Annex. As Lord Zetland is aware, this question is discussed in paragraphs 2 to 4 of the memorandum to the Egyptian Government which forms the second enclosure to the Foreign Office letter under reference. In eimplification of those paragraphs, I am to explain that the existing Mixed Tribunals were instituted to supplement the Consular Courts provided for under the capitulations and with a view to trying certain categories of cases between Egyptians and non-Egyptian foreigners or oetween foreigners of different nationalities. The meaning of the word 'foreigner' for the purpose of the jurisdiction of these tribunals has never been defined to the satisfaction of all parties, but it may be said broadly that the Mixed Courts have Under-Secretary of State, India Office. REDO. POt. 4EFEB1937. OFFICE ENCLOSURE m/AIR MAIL LU’ic:: No. 6 ; -8 FEB 1937 IM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND SECRET DEPT. INDIA OTFISEA in practice not only had Jurisdiction over the subjects of the capitulatory Powers proper (which are Belgium, Danmark, Prance, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway,Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United States of America) but have also established Jurisdiction over most non-Egyptians. (However, the rights formerly held by Tsarist Russia may be considered to have lapsed, and except for Japanese, persons of African or Asiatic origin have as a general principle never enjoyed the jurisdiction of the Mixed Courts, On the other hand, Asiatics or Africans who are British subjects or British protected persons enjoy the same privileges as all other British subjects and protected persons in Egypt, with the exception of Palestinians as being former subjects of the Ottoman Empire, As regards the generality of Africans and Asiatics, the Egyptian Government have always successfully insisted that these shall be justiciable before the Native Courts in the same way as Egyptians). 2. Owing to this discrepancy between the existing definition of 'foreigners M for the purposes of the Mixed Courts and for the purpose of capitulatory rights, it will be a matter of some delicacy to reach agreement on a definition for use during the transitional regime , and in the course of the discussions at present proceeding between His Majesty’s Government and the Egyptian Government (mention of which is made in paragraph 2 of Foreign Office letter under reference) it has been suggested that British protected persons should not be covered by that definition. The advantage of this concession is that it would not appear to affect His Majesty’s Government very greatly from a practical point of view, while being of considerable value to the Egyptian Government. The arguments/ -'-jarguments in favour of the foregoing atat™ * 8 mg statement are as follows: On the one hand, the only British protected persons to he found in Egypt in any numbers are Palestinians, and they, as stated above, are already subject to the Egyptian Native Courts. Consequently, the British protected persons who in actual practice would be tried before the Egyptian Native Courts instead of the Mixed Courts during the transitional regime would be extremely few in number. (As stated in paragraph 1 (ii) of the Annex to article 13 of the Treaty, this regime is to last only -for a reasonable and not unduly prolonged 'period'; after that period all foreigners, without distinction of status, will be justiciable by the Egyptian Native Courts). On the other hand, the Egyptians would much appreciate this tangible evidence that His Majesty^ Government support the principle that Africans and Asiatics should not enjoy extra territorial rights of any description, since it would clearly strengthen the hand of the Egyptian Government in claiming that natives of French and Italian territories in Africa or Asia should be excluded from the jurisdiction of the Mixed Courts during the transitional regime . 3. It will be useful to state in detail the categories of British protected persons involved by the foregoing proposal. British protected persons may be stated to consist of the following classes:- (a) Persons enjoying British protection by virtue of their connexion with a British protected State or a State under British suzerainty or a British mandated territory. Mr. Eden proposes that the persons covered by the above definition should be subject to the Egyptian native courts during the transitional regime . (b)/(to) So far as Mr. ®i en is are, there are three other categories of persons who nUght for the purpose of registration m Egypt under tne Egypt Ord.r-m-Coun.u l93 o b, „ British protected persons but who are not Rr.its v, die not British protected persons in the same sense as the catpo-nr*^ m category mentioned above. They are (i) foreigners whose protection h** -k protection has been undertaken toy His Majesty’s Government; (u) per80ns C0Mected with Cyprus who have acquired neither Egyptian nor British nationality, with whom may toe classed a numtoer of persons of other origin who enjoy British protection for special reasons; (in) persons Wh ° Briti8h su1:) j ect s only in some part of His Majesty’s dominions (locally naturalised British subjects) or *o are not British subjects at all tout are nationals of a Dominion under Dominion legislation (e.g. certain citizens of the Irish Free State). Mr. Men sees no reason why category (i) should be excluded from the jurisdiction of the native courts in the transitional period. He also feels that category (ii) could b^ subjected without hardship to the native courtsj he surmises that in any case they are very few in number. (The Egyptian Government are anxious to subject all Cypriots to the native courts during the transitional regime but Mr. Eden will resist this suggestion strongly in so far as it concerns British subjects . He will resist a similar Egyptian suggestion in respect of Maltese). On the other hand Mr. Eden would propose to insist that category (iii) should come within the jurisdiction of the mixed courts. 4. Mr. Eden has therefore in view the following definition for the British persons who, in his opinion, should come under the jurisdiction of the mixed courts during the transitional regime/5. regime:- 'British subjects^/and person^ who under the la.,s in force in any .part'of the British Commonwealth 'of Nationg”are - nationals or citizens of that part Mr. Eden would be glad to receive the early observations of Lord Zetland on the foregoing proposal.

It is understood that in the event of its being found imnofSf' bring into effect the arrangements referred to in paragraph 2 theE f Government retains its full rights unimpaired with regard to the capitSS regime, including the Mixed Tribunals. f 5. It is understood that paragraph 2 (a) involves not merely that assent of the Capitulatory Powers will be no longer necessary for h application of any Egyptian legislation to their nationals but‘ also tW the present legislative functions of the Mixed Tribunals ’as regards th application of Egyptian legislation to foreigners will terminate It would follow from this that the Mixed Tribunals in their judicial capacity would no longer have to pronounce upon the validity of the application to foreigners of an Egyptian law or decree which has been applied to foreigners bv the Egyptian Parliament or Government, as the case may be. 6. His Majesty the King of Egypt hereby declares that no Egyptian legislation made applicable to foreigners will be inconsistent with the principles generally adopted in modern legislation or, with particular relation to legislation of a fiscal nature, discriminate against foreigners, including foreign corporate bodies. 7. In view of the fact that it is the practice in most countries to apply to foreigners the law of their nationality in matters of “statut personnel,” consideration will be given to the desirability of excepting from the transfer of jurisdiction, at any rate in the first place, matters relating to “statut personnel ” affecting nationals of those Capitulatory Powers who wish that their Consular authorities should continue to exercise such jurisdiction. 8. The transitional regime for the Mixed Tribunals and the transfer to them of the jurisdiction at present exercised by the Consular Courts (which regime and transfer will, of course, be subject to the provisions of the special convention referred to in Article 9) will necessitate the revision of existing law’s relating to the organisation and jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals,18 1 °f this tegiu e e nts t0 Article Annex: — ntions i n ^ 0n Egyptian Ptian legislation lts necessary n k ot undulv d Tribunals will Clal jurisdiction 'nsular Courts. ’ len t will be ^ a PProach tie the removal of 1 A forei 8®eri :ed Tribunals as the Government w ny opposed to will collaborate them by using ,hts in Egypt. ld impossible to 2 , the Egyptian the capitulatory merely that the cessary for the &gt; hut also that as regards the iate.

The High Contracting Parties agree that any difference on the subject of the application or interpretation of the provisions of the present tieaty xvInch they are unable to settle by direct negotiation shall be dea t with in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations. Article 10. At an &gt; time after the expiration of a period of twenty years from the coming into force of the treaty, the High Contracting Parties will, at the request of either of them, enter into negotiations with a view to such revision of its terms by agreement between them as may be appropriate in the circumstances as they then exist T n case of the High Contracting Parties being unable to agree upon the terms of the revised treaty, the difference will be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations for decision in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant in force at the time of signature of the present treaty or to such other person or body of persons for decision m accordance with such procedure as the High Contracting Parties ma J agree. It is agreed that any revision of this treaty will provide for the continuation of the Alliance between the High Contracting Parties in accordance with the principles contained in Articles 4 5 ° 6 and 7. Nevertheless, with the consent of both High Contracting Parties, negotiations may be entered into at any time after the expiration of a period of ten years after the coming into force of the treaty, with a view to such revision as aforesaid.15 Agreed Minute.

The said police will remain for the same period under the command of British officers. With a view to facilitating the gradual substitution of Egyptian officials for the said European element and thereby securing the harmonious working of the police organisation, the Egyptian Govern ment propose to dispense annually with the services of one-fifth of the number of European police officials. The Egyptian Government, in view of the treaty of friendship and alliance signed to-day, will, when engaging the services of foreign experts, generally prefer British subjects possessing the necessary qualifications.

I wish to place on record certain further understandings in regard toJO.htary matters wh.ch have been reached between us in connexion w. - the Treaty of Alliance signed this day. ( 1 ) British personnel shall be withdrawn from the Egyptian Army and the functions of the Inspector-General and his staff shall terminate. ( 2 ) The Egyptian Government, desiring to perfect the training of the Egyptian Army including the Air Force, and intending, in the interests of the alliance which has been established, that such foreign instructors as they may deem necessary shall be chosen from amongst British subjects only, will avail themselves of the advice of a British Military Mission for such time as they may deem necessary for the purposes aforesaid. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will furnish the Military Mission which the Egyptian Government desire, and will also undertake to receive and provide proper training in the United Kingdom for any personnel of the Egyptian forces which the Egyptian Government may desire to send for the purpose of being trained. In the circumstances created bv this treaty the Egyptian Government will naturally not desire to send any personnel of their armed forces to undergo a course in anv training establishment or unit abroad elsewhere than in the United Kingdom, provided that this shall not prevent it from sending to any other country such personnel as cannot be received in training establishments and units in the United Kingdom.

Cairo, December 29, 1936. Enclosure 1 . Sir M. Lampson to Mustapha El-Nahas Pasha. My dear Prime Minister, Cairo, December 24; 1936. YOUR Excellency will remember that in the memorandum which was communicated to the Egyptian delegation and discussed in London at a meeting held with them in the Foreign Office on the 28th August last, a promise was given that the views of His Majesty’s Government on certain points arising out of the capitulatory provisions to the treaty would be made the subject of a special communication. On the instructions of my Government, I now have much pleasure in trans mitting to you a memorandum stating the views of His Majesty’s Government on these questions. In sending your Excellency these suggestions, I would make it clear that there will no doubt be further points which will inevitably arise which it may be desirable to discuss at a later stage. Believe me, MILES W. LAMPSON. Enclosure 2. Memorandum. [908 a—1]state of affairs, and therefore His Majesty s Government consider it should be uifreed that for civil cases, the definition of foreigner for the purposes of determining jurisdiction of the Mixed Courts should be that resulting f rom existing jurisprudence of these courts. ,, ,, r . e o bj 4s r e&lt;r a rds criminal matters, the definition of foreigner” for th^ existing criminal jurisdiction of the Mixed Courts contraventions,” bank riintov offences and offences against the court and its officers) should remain as at nresent and His Majesty’s Government consider it would he the best and most Lical solution to adopt as the definition of foreigner for the purposes of the 'X cr iminal jurisdiction of the Mixed Courts the same definition. If, however , T. ^ dVinnlH see strong obiection to this on the ground tw over “ foreigners ” without any express restriction, they would he exercising it over a class of non-Egyptians over which the national tribunals now claim iurisdiction His Majesty’s Government would he prepared to agree to a provision transferring expressly to the Mixed Courts full correctional and criminal juris diction over all persons hitherto entitled to consular jurisdiction, together with such other persons, if any, to whom the Egyptian Government may by subsequent legislation extend such jurisdiction. This would amount to a substitution of the description for the definition. The advantage of this substitution is that it avoids complicated argument about the definition of a rare category of cases the exact status of which is not clearly defined at present, and in fact maintains the status guo with regard to such cases while leaving open the possibility of special agreements between the Egyptian Government and other Powers. 4 ir or civil cases between two foreigners of the same nationality, which would also now pass to the Mixed Courts, no definition is required. The desired result would be achieved by omitting the words “ de nationalite differente” in R rwio ‘ - 1 j n i UX,rl«rv™f iudiciaire mixte. T _. ^ 5 As regards statut personnel cases, His Majesty s (uovernment consider ( 1 ) that the Mfxed Courts should have jurisdiction in such cases, and the present specific exclusion from their jurisdiction of statut personnel embodied in article 4 and article 5 of the Code civil mixte and article 9 of the Reglement d'Organisa- tion judiciaire mixte should be abrogated*, ( 2 ) that if the majoiity of the capitulatory Powers at the conference press for a right to exclude statut personnel cases concerning their nationals from the transfer of consular jurisdiction to the Mixed Courts, the Egyptian Government should be ready to agree to the inclusion in the convention of a provision under which such transfer should not take place in the case of nationals of such capitulatory Powers as give notice within a certain fixed period that they desire to exercise their right. His Majesty s Government desire to remind the Egyptian Government in this connexion that this right is expressly contemplated in paragraph 7 of the annex to article 13 of the Treaty of Alliance. They would further point out that, in view of the large number of Egyptian nationals subject in matters of statut personnel to religious tribunals in Egypt at present, it would not appear to be open to objection from the Egyptian point of view to accord this right. 6 . If the majority of the capitulatory Powers at the conference are wnh^g to agree that jurisdiction in statut personnel cases over their nationals should be transferred to the Mixed Courts, His Majesty’s Government are also prepared to agree. If, however, in view of the attitude of the majority of these Powers, it is necessary to concede a right to except statut personnel cases from the transfer, it is probable that His Majesty’s Government would also exercise this right. 7. Statut personnel cases form part of civil jurisdiction, and therefore so far as the Mixed Courts are concerned no special (lefinition of ' foreigner toi this purpose would be required. The Mixed Courts would have jurisdiction in statut personnel over the same foreigners as are covered by their existing juris prudence in connexion with their jurisdiction in other civil suits, except t0 ^ e extent that this jurisdiction was cut down by the exercise of the right referred o in paragraph 5 (2) above. There might also be a provision that the Mixed Cour s when dealing with a statut personnel case should, so far as possible, arrange tna the chamber should include a judge of the “ nationality ” of the “ suit ana that where there was no such judge they might appoint assessors of tna nationality, and that they should apply the law of this nationality as 6 substantive law to determine matters in dispute.3 8 . It may, however, be necessary for th in matters of statut personnel to have ( ' PI .t!in l 2 ' P 0 SeS i° f determining jurisdiction considered to be the “ nationality of the o,?; t .® P f eCla A mles determining what is in the possible event of the parties to a t0 ' the P ul 'Poses of jurisdiction —tionality.

The discussion which took place on the 28th August raised very important questions in relation to the personnel of the Mixed Tribunals, in connexion with the desire of the Egyptian Government that there should be an increase in the proportion of Egyptian judges. His Majesty’s Government have given the most sympathetic consideration to Egyptian desires in this respect. It would seem clear that there are two opposite dangers to be avoided : On the one hand, a Premature dislocation of existing organisation; on the other hand, an abrupt change at the end of the transition period. In order to meet both these difficulties, it is tentatively suggested that an increase in the proportion of Egyptian judges should take place during the last five years of the transition regime, and that this rise should be made gradually by providing that during these five years European vacancies on the tribunals of first instances should be filled by Egypti ans &gt; an d those in the Court of Appeal by promoting European judges of first instance. Further, in order to avoid difficulties as to the composition of courts, it is suggested that, throughout the transition period, there should be no formal obligation to compose the chambers with a majority either of foreign or of Egyptian judges. This would entail the deletion of those provisions of the Reglement d’Organisation judiciaire which prescribe how the bench of the tribunals and chambers of the Mixed Courts for the decision of cases should be divided between foreign and Egyptian judges. 10. As regards the parquet, the following suggestions are made in place of those contained at the end of paragraph 9 in the memorandum given to the Egyptian delegation before the meeting in London on the 28th August:— ( 1 ) There should be a European member of the parquet in each tribunal of first instance. While it should be provided that the procurator- general must be European for the whole of the transition period, it may be agreed that during the last five years of the period vacancies occurring in these other European parquet posts may be filled by Egyptians. ( 2 ) The police, when engaged in arresting and searching the houses of foreigners subject to full criminal jurisdiction of the Mixed Courts, should be accompanied and directed by an official of the Mixed Parquet or by a police officer specially delegated by the procureur general. The Mixed Courts should have an adequate number of such parquet officials.11. It remains to offer observations as promised in the memnro a August last as regards the procedure in ease of pardons of persons (r ' ldu ® of the Mixed Courts or remissions of sentences imposed on foreieners connexion with the execution of capital sentences passed on foreign”” &amp; 80 in suggested that a provision might be included by which the nronir ^ “ should be consulted by the Egyptian Government before they decide to gen ® H * or to commute a sentence of death, and before they decide unon m Car 7 ° - remission of a sentence imposed by the Mixed Courts. • ' P a ™ 0I i or 12. There are certain further points on which His Majesty’s C consider it desirable at this stage to make .suggestions in'accordance wiTa 1 liberty to do so reserved in the memorandum of August 1936 the 13. His Majesty’s Government also think it most imoortant in „ a reassure the capitulatory Powers with regard to this matter tW VV der 10 Government should undertake that the present powers of insnectinn A ptlan procurator-general of the Mixed Courts possesses under existing 'p 1 ‘ Ch ? he legislation, on those sections of Egyptian prisons where Win Vptla “ incarcerated, should be continued throughout the transition r&amp;ime V re they think it desirable that European lock-ups should be definiteh- an r a and placed under the administration of the Mixed Courts who shS h! empowered to engage such a small number of qualified personnel to muT ^ of them as may seem necessary. 1 ta ve c harge 14. Finally, His Majesty s Government consider that the denortatmn ? foreigners who are subject to the plenary criminal jurisdiction of the It °1 Courts must during the transition regime, only take place on an orde^fromThr Mixed Courts, except in cases where a visitor to Egypt has overstaved a Hmit I visa or in immigration cases, and that the Mixed Criminal Code andThe plS f Criminal Procedure should contain provisions to provide for thisEGYPT AND SUDAN. August 28, 1936. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 4. [J 7498/190/16] Copy No* Procedure for Giving Effect to Capitulations: Provisions of Anglo-Egyptian T reaty. IN accordance with the proposal in Mr. Beckett’s memorandum in J 7230 r vUiieh was approved by the Secretary of State, a meeting was held in the Foreign Omce on the 28th August with representatives of the Egyptian Government in order to seek agreement on this matter. Egyptian Go\ eminent was represented by Makram Ebeid Pasha, Hafez Ann 1 asha, \\ assif Ghali Pasha, Ahmed Maher Pasha and Amin Osman Bey The Foreign Office was represented by Mr. Beckett and Mr. Campbell. J he proceedings of the meeting were based on the attached memorandum by Mr. Beckett, copies of which had been communicated to the Egyptian represen tatives on the 27th August. It was explained that there were some points in the memorandum on which it would be desirable and even necessary to reach agreement now. The other points could be discussed now in a preliminary manner to assist the reaching of agreement as soon as possible with the Residency when the Egyptian delegates returned to Egypt. I.— Manner, Date and Place of Negotiations. It was agreed that the best method for negotiating the necessary treaty or protocol between Egypt and the capitulatory Powers providing for the abolition of the Capitulations and the institution of a transitional Mixed Court regime would be by means of a conference to be held in January 1937. As regards the place at which the conference should take place, it was agreed that the choice lay between Cairo and some “neutral ' city, possibly Montreux. The Egyptian representatives stated that they were divided in opinion on the question. On the one hand, Cairo was desirable, since the archives necessary for the discussion of these questions and the persons best qualified to discuss them were to be found in that city. On the other hand, there was the danger that in Cairo the influence of foreign communities in Egypt, who were nervous about any change in the capitulatory regime, would be exerted in an undue manner upon their respective national delegations. The Egyptian representatives undertook to inform the Foreign Office of their decision before they left London. The Egvptian representatives readily agreed to paragraph 4 of the memorandum attached. II.— Subject-Matter of Conference. While discussing the question of a conference, Hafez Afifi urged that the abolition of the legislative Capitulations, with which the question °f ttm cessation of the legislative functions of the Mixed Courts is bound up, should not be dealt with in the conference on the ground that, if they were so dealt with, opportunities would be given to the capitulatory Powers to impose all sorts of conditions and seek bargains with regard to capitulatory usages as the price o t eir consen o the establishment of a transitional regime for the Mixed Courts and their final extinction. The Capitulations, he urged, unlike the Mixed Courts were not he subject of treaties between Egypt and the Powers, and gyp s ou e e ' to secure their abolition independently of the proposed conference Mr. Beckett argued that the procedure proposed by Afifi Pasha would be neithei proper wise It was contrary to the procedure indicated in paragraphs 1 and i of the Capitulations annex. ' No capitulatory Power would be would the Capitulations until the transitory regime had been fixed and the legime uou be conditional on the Capitulations being surren eie . [783 ee—4] BAfter some discussion Hafez Afifi reserved his own personal opinion n th matter. His point was not taken up by his colleagues and may reason a b? h! considered as abandoned. ^ be &amp; III .—Unilateral Egyptian Denunciation of Capitulations if Conference fa'l Question of Support by His Majesty's Government. Afifi Pasha also asked whether His Majesty's Government would now tell th Egyptian Government that, should the conference fail, they would support th 6 Egyptian Government in unilateral abolition of the Capitulations. In makin 6 this enquiry he was not contemplating unilateral abolition of the Mixed Courts’ Mr. Beckett answered that it was impossible for His Majesty’s Government to give any such undertaking. His Majesty's Government were confident that the conference would succeed if the proposals made to the Powers were reasonable and moderate, and the meeting was being held for the purpose of reaching between His Majesty's Government and the Egyptian Government an agreed 'moderate proposal which should have really good prospects of acceptance. The Egyptian Government must trust His Majesty's Government as their allies in this ^matter The Egyptian representatives expressed general readiness to do so, but repeated that they would much like some assurance of the kind, though they realised that they were asking His Majesty's Government to give an undertaking in respect of a hypothetical situation and that His Majesty’s Government were always reluctant to do this. IV .—Length of the Transition Regime for the Mixed Courts. This subject was then discussed. Mr. Beckett explained that His Majesty's Government had not proposed twenty years for this period because it might have been falsely associated in the public mind with the period of twenty years mentioned in article 16 of the Treaty of Alliance. They had, therefore, taken eighteen years. 7 he Egyptian Representatives stated that Nahas Pasha was entirely opposed to the period being one of more than eight or, at the very most, ten years. Makram Pasha explained that in Nahas Pasha's view, and in that of other members of the Government, any longer period w T ouid break the treaty. To the man in the street the Capitulations meant the Mixed Courts. The Egyptian public would simply not understand that as a result of a treaty which stipulated the abolition of the Capitulations the detested Mixed Courts should continue for longer than eight or ten years. This period could be explained as necessary for the preparation of new r codes and other necessary adjustments; anything more could not. Nahas Pasha was extremely strong on the point. tu P e ?k e tt pointed out that the real grievance of Egypt in this matter was e legislative functions of the Mixed Courts, and the fact that foreigners did not pay the ordinary taxes. These would disappear in about a year. . akram Pasha said that, on the contrary, the Mixed Courts as such were the Far f t nevanc ? J ;! 16 in the street. He gave the instance of usurers, even ur 0 I )eai1 men s l ra w in order to get claims in respect of loans p n .* e ^ lxec ^ Courts. The result often was that on a judgment of the loans onruri ? i ? Pf asant I° un d himself called upon to pay 8 or 9 per cent, on proceedino-s^n at” 1 ' P ercenta ge was increased by the great expense of which had W 6 r^\ X ^ Courts. He referred to Iraq and iudicial regime men had been applied m that country. import r ® m mded the Egyptian representatives that the comparative countries The Hi f01 ' eign “'ities in Egypt was far greater than in other them and thej wouflSrt infl ° f ^ ^ W0U ' d be a grGat ^ i? General consent tn tha v ^ . m ^ uence °n their Governments. It was necessary, if ^ene.al consent to the abolition of the Capitulations was to be secured m January,3 ^Liovunment foi a penod of eighteen years (they would be ready to accept fifteen yeais as an absolute minimum) could easily be presented to the Egyptian Govern ment in an advantageous light, and, after all, the period was not so very long in the life of a nation. A. shoi t period would result in its being hardiv worth while to establish a transitional regime. M&lt;ih i(uu Pasha lepeated his earlier arguments, ihe Mixed Courts, he said, had been imposed on Egypt and were a restriction of Egyptian sovereignty. Further discussion having failed to produce agreement in the meeting, the point was reserved for discussion between the Secretary of State and Nahas Pasha in the afternoon (see below). (See paragraph 4 above l the discussion of the other points may be regarded as preliminary only.) V .—New Codes for the Mixed Courts during the (a) Transition Regime. This point was then discussed. Makram Pasha said that at present he saw no objection to the adoption of the Draft Penal Code (“ Percival Code ') already in existence, though he thought there was a native penal code already prepared other than the so-called “ Percival Code.” Afifi Pasha pointed out that the “Percival Code” would be satisfactory except that a few portions of it, which related to the political regime in Egypt which had just been closed by the treaty, would need modification or omission. Mr. Beckett, in reply to Makram Pasha, urged that it was better to take a code, i.e., the Percival Code, to which the majority of the Powers, as well as the Egyptian Government, had already agreed. If a new code which had not this advantage were to be left for consideration at the conference, endless discussions would ensue. As regards the Code of Criminal Procedure, there was that of 1933, which would be ready, as Makram Pasha said, in a month or two. This had been prepared by the Procurator-General of the Mixed Courts and some European judges of those tribunals. It was agreed that the Percival Code and the Code of 1933, now about to be completed, should be recommended for adoption at the conference. (b) Proportion of Egyptian to Foreign Judges. With regard to the suggested increase in the personnel of the Mixed Courts which woulcf be necessitated by the transitional regime, Makram Pasha said that there was one point of extreme importance which he wished to make. He considered that the relative number of European and Egyptian judges in t e Mixed Courts should be modified so that there should be an equal number oi Egyptians and Europeans. In making this proposal Makram Pasha said (and Afifi Pasha supported him earnestly) that its object was to ensure the training of a sufficient number of Egyptian judges for service m the Egyptian courts which would succeed those of the transition regime. The proposal, he could assure the Foreign Office, was an entirely sincere one. [783 ee—4] (i) N.B.—This sug; ggestion was the last five years of a period of fifteen years. B 24 Makram Pasha on his side suggested that the Egyptians’ wish mi^ht h met if from the beginning of the transition regime Egyptian judges should b • a majority in the Courts of First Instance and European judges in a maiorit 6 ^ the Courts of Appeal. In this manner European interests would be am T safeguarded and their fears might be allayed, since they could always ha ik recourse to appeal. The matter was left with these two suggestions in the field as a subject f further discussion and one on which the meeting felt that some arraneem °t could be reached. (c) Egyptian Presidency of Chambers and Use of A rabic Language. Makram Pasha said there were two other points of great importance to th Egyptian Government. These were ( 1 ) the question of Egyptian presidency of the Chambers, and (2) the use of the Arabic language. ^ It was pointed out that on these two points His Majesty's Government had already largely supported the Egyptian point of view and'that a considerable number of other foreign Governments had done the same. His Majesty's Government had entirely adopted the Egyptian view regarding the presidency of Chambers; and with regard to the use of Arabic, they had^ expressed their sympathy in principle, while giving the opinion that it was a matter to be settled by the courts themselves. (d) Extent of Additions to Mixed Court and Mixed Parquet Personnel. As regards the numbers of additional judges, &amp;c., in the Mixed Courts and the Mixed Parquet, this was left as a matter for later discussion. The Egyptian Representatives, however, strongly objected to the suggestion that there should be a certain number of European police with the rank of inspectors of the Mixed C ourt Parquet who should be entrusted with the duty of arresting and searching the houses of foreigners under the transition regime working under the jurisdiction of the Mixed Court Parquet. Makram Pasha pointed out with some heat that under the treaty the European police would disappear entirely in five years and that there could be no European police left. The suggestion in the Foreign Office memorandum was merely reversing the treaty provisions. Mr. Beckett pointed out that this was not the intention at all, that the point WaS k°ki e 0 u w . lcl1 Europeans had (possibly exaggerated) fears and that it would probably be wise to make some arrangement of the kind suggested. Mdkram Pasha pointed out that Egyptian police were already used in the nrro 1 / 1068 ^theie were no European police officials) for the purposes of arrests and the searching of the houses of foreigners. 0 ^ serve ^ if this was so the Egyptian police were accom panied by foreign consuls or their representatives. P fu h (l replied that the consuls seldom, if ever, went in person, and Eoyptiai^ ^ le P lesen f e d by the consular kawass, who was a servant and an iinrUr^tka ri SOm ? Emission the principle that this duty should be carried out subordinntp 1 ^- su P*T v ! slon the Mixed Court Parquet and not merely by some subordinate police official was agreed upon.( 2 ) have one or^vn Pn 0 ^ 6 '^’ re Pf ate h that it would probablv be found desirable to naye one oi two Europeans to help in these duties. that probablv^nrnp ^ rr l att ' er should be left for further discussion and k u 1011 sa tisfactory to both points of view could be found. ( 2 ) Note by Mr. Beckett:— the Mixed Parquet who act get agreement that an official or representative of the police when effectin'? arrp V ^ ^ 16 or ^ ers ^ ie Trocureur gdndral should accompany the Egyptian side to calling ° V s ^ arches against foreigners. There will be objection on importance provided the nrinofT °™ cia ^ s ' police,’ but the word used is not of practical operation and supervises ita pyJ* V' S 8ecure&lt; ^ that the Parquet official is in charge of the i vlsesit s execution by the police.”(e) Piopoi t/on o f Egyptian to European Judges (continued). Finally, XIaktam Pasha again emphasised the need for satisfying the Egyptian wish to equalise the number of European and Egyptian judges in the Mixed Courts loi the puipose of training Egyptian judges for their duties at ^the end of the transition regime. .l/ 7 \ Beckett again advised caution and suggested that it would be unwise to go too fast. He urged the need for presenting simple proposals to the conference when it met if long discussions were to be prevented. VI .—Period of Transition Regime (see IV above). The Secretary of State visited Nahas Pasha at the Dorchester Hotel in the afternoon of the 28th August in order to talk on various matters. The question of the length of the transition regime for the Mixed Courts was discussed. Nahas Pasha urged that the period should be as short as possible and stated that he thought eight or, at the most, ten years should be sufficient. He repeated the arguments used by the Egyptian representatives at the meeting in the morning. The Secretary of State, on his side, urged the need for a longer period and pressed for fifteen years. He said that the French Ambassador had expressed some anxiety to him that very morning regarding the period of the transition regime. After some discussion it appeared that Nahas Pasha would close at twelve years at once. During these discussions Amin Osman Bey told Mr. Beckett that he thought His Majesty's Government could get twelve years if they closed at once, though it was just possible that after a day or two Nahas Pasha would come up to fifteen years. This, however, was doubtful and in the nature of a gamble. Moreover, if we got Nahas to accept too long a period Mohamed Mahmud and other non-Government members of the delegation would use it as a ground for stumping the country and starting a campaign against Nahas and this would be bad for the treaty. After private reference to Mr. Beckett, who told the Secretary of State what Amin Osman Bey had said and gave the opinion that twelve years was long enough to maKe it worth while establishing the transition period, and that foreign Governments and others would probably be relieved at finding the period was not shorter, Mr. Eden decided that on balance the wisest course was to close at twelve years. He thought that the French Ambassador would in reality be quite relieved at the period being so long, as he had given the impression that he thought the Mixed Courts would disappeai almost immediately. , .. . . i Mr. Eden, therefore, informed Nahas Pasha that he would accept twelve years, and this period was agreed to.

The above are the principal points which have occurred to us at the present moment. There is always, however, the possibility as the matter is further investigated that other points will present themselves,'for instance, it may be desirable to provide that, as the Mixed Courts are taking over the jurisdiction of the consular courts, the records of the consular courts should be available to the Mixed Courts where a case pending before the latter arises out of or is connected with proceedings which have previously been taken in the former. W. E. BECKETT. August 26, 1936.-S P.6617/llOA. ?) 0 iitG 1936 Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary MacDonald to request you to invite the attention of Mr. Secretary Eden to telegram No.128 Saving of the 6th December from ;,ir Miles Lampson and connected telegraphic correspondence, copies of which have been received in this Department, and to state that he has noted that it is proposed that a conierence shall be held in the near future to consider the future of capitulations in Egypt. in 1933, when consideration was being given to the policy which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom should adopt if a request were received from the French Government for the surrender of British extra-territorial rights in Morocco, an examination was made in this Department of the interest of the Dominions in this question, and the conclusion was reached that before any definite undertakings were given by His Majesty’s Government in IE UNDhh SECKETiUir OF STATE, FvhEIGN OH ICE.in the United Kingdom with regard to the surrender of capitulations it would be desirable to consult the Dominions. In this connection your attention is invited to paragraph 4 of my predecessor’s Secret despatch Dominions No.447 of the 18th August, 1930, regarding the abolition of Sxtra-territoriality in China, a copy of which was sent to the Foreign Office under cover of Dominions Office letter No.6Q£3/ll7 of the 18th August, 1930. 3. It is accordingly requested that before any conference is held to discuss the future of capitulations in Egypt tr. MacDonald may be informed in such time as to enable him to consult the Dominions of the attitude likely to be adopted by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom regarding a surrender of capitulatory rights and to consider whether it would be necessary to invite the Dominion Governments to participate in any agreement which may ultimately be concluded with the Egyptian Government on this subject. 4.
