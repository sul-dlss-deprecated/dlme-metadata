The next place visited was iLalala, l-ir miles N./#. of A1 ^lisan. •Phis town is in two portions mile apart, at eq^ual distances from the sea, composed of about l^-.O and 100 houses respective xy nearly all of stone and dwelt in by the Bu Ghawwas and Bait Marhun sections of the A1 ii.athir, j?he eastern and larger portion contains a spacious and well built mosque and some good houses of and S stories many of which are kept in good repair notably that in possession of the tub-Wali Shaikh Bakhit- The latter is a slave of S.ulaiman bin Euwailim and is responsible to him for the collection of revenue arid taxes (which are generally paid in kind) throughout this portion of the coast. Bach division of Lalala town has a graveyard a few hundred yards to the North surrounded by a low wall: some of the graves appear to be ibOO years old, so far as one could judge from their appearance and by comparing them with those in the graveyards of A1 Bilad. The town of Eialala is sur rounded toy cotton plantations, with a little tobacco and sugar cane. Cocoanut trees are plentiful, but we saw no date palms in any part of Lhufar. Returning to A1 Jisan from Salala we passed some interesting stone quarries about ^ mile from the town.. The stone is peculiarly white and handsome, but not very durable: there is however plenty of it and the majority of the houses in the neighbourhood have been built and are kept in repair from these quarries.
