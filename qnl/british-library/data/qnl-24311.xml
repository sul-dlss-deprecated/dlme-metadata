Thoughthe Manamah market has become important yet the street are narrow and as the majority of the landed property situated I m the market is not in good condition owing to the existing narrow lanes which make the landed property far from business centre, it would be desirable to open a road starting from Shaikh Hamad’s ’chabras' to the east as far as Colonel Barrett Road. The opening of such a road also adds to the. value of the property. Undoubtedly the improved condition of the country and the increasing importance of the property situated on that road support this idea.1.
