Two outstanding events, the Assyrian affair in August followed ty the League of Nations 1 enquiry, and the most unexpected death of King Eaisal which took place in September between the Assyrian affair and the enquiry, overshadowed all other happenings in 1 1RAQ during 1933i 2* The General election, held in February in accordance with His Majesty’s wishes, resulted, as had been expected, in an easy victory for the existing cabinet of Naji Shawkat. The Elections were carefully controlled and only the King* s nominees were elected to the Chamber of Deputies. King Faisal was virtually dictator in a country which was only nominally constit utional. The King had many interests; he kept alive the pan-Arab movement, intrigues for the throne of SYRIA, and was active in fostering amongst the Arab leaders enmity to Ibn Sa f ud the present holder of the former Hashimite throne of HEJAZ. In ’IRAQ too, the King had a number of schemes which included the con struction of new palaces and bridges, new irrigation works, and the BAGHDAD-HAIFA Railway. To cope with these many interests, the Palace contained a busy Diwan or Secretariat, capable of handling a heavy correspond ence. The Palace was a hive of political activity and no contractor or seeker of concessions from EUROPE or SYRIA could afford to neglect the Royal Diwan. By adroit manoeuvres the King had almost complete control •ver the Cabinet which comprised, for the most part, ^ivil officials who were quite amenable but entirely lacking in initiative. This Cabinet was not, however, entirely to the King’s liking since their negative attitude made it obvious to everyone that the policy of the Government was being dictated from the Palace. Consequently, in March, he appointed as Premier Rashid Ali Gailani, whose Cabinet included two most influential politicians in ’IRAQ - Nuri Pasha as Sa’id as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Yasin Pasha al Hashimi, the leader of the Opposition Party, as Minister of Finance. The in clusion of the latter in the Gailani Cabinet was an astute move as Yasin’s previous position as leader of the Ultra-Nationalist Party, in favour of drastic revision of the Treaty and anti-British in sentiment, now proved invaluable to the King whenever his own interests ran counter to the British. As a convenient medium for the introduction of modified Nationalist measures in which the King had a personal interest, the Minister of Finance soon became the most important person in the Cabinet.Page 2. 4. The publication in. May of a hook entitled 'Arabhood in the Balance” was the next important event and gave rise to a sudden and unexpected revival of Shia activity in the Holy Cities and in the Middle Euphrates area generally. The author, Abdul Razzaq al Hassan, a Sunni, cast doubts on certain fundamental beliefs in the Shia faith, and since the book was published with the apparent approval of the responsible authorities in BAGHDAD, it was taken by the Shias as yet another in stance of the oppressive i^clicy of a predominantly Sunni Government towards the Shia domniunity, which was most inadequately represented in Parliament, For a time, the situation looked, ugly and extra police were drafted to the disturbed area, and the fact that it did not develop was due partly to the prosecution and sub sequent imprisonment of the authdr, and chiefly to the attitude of the leading divines; while agreeing that Abdul Razzaq deserved punishment, they deprecated any act of violence likely to widen the breach between the Shia and Sunni Communities. Finally, it was suggested that the book had been inspired by an outside agency with the aim of causing discord within the Moslem world and t)he agitation gradually subsided, but it is quite likely to be revived in s&lt;ome form or other in the near future. The Shias at present, have no really capable leader, but they are not lively to remain for long content with a Sunni Government in which they are al most unrepresented. 6* On 6th June, King Faisal left BAGHDAD on a visit to EUROPE whioh was to include an official visit to Buckingham Palaoe. The ’Iraqi delegation to the International Economic Conference to be held in LONDON on 12th J^ne, composed of Yasin, Nuri, and Rustam Beg Haidar, left at the same time. Great things were expected in ’IRA^ from these two visits; it was assumed that King Faisal would obtain some revision of the Treaty, while the delegation was expected to negotiate a loan fov the construction of the GHARRAF and HAB3AN- IYAH irrigation works and to make financial arrangements ^ or . BA-GHBADoHAIFA Railway. Consequently, the political situation in ’IRAQ remained very quiet and oare was taken to permit no expression of anti-British sentiments. In oonsoquence a ceremony which was arranged to be held at RUMAITHA on 30th June, to commemmorate the Arab rising against the British in 1920 was ill-attended, and, despite a good deal of publicity in the extremist press, occasioned little local interest. This quiet interlude was brought to an abrupt conclusion by the situation in the north, which culminated in the massacre of a number of Assyrians at SIMEL on 11th August which is described in paras. 17 - 22 below. King Faisal returned in great haste at the beginning of August and the delegation reached BAGHDAD about the same time. The King had proposed to stay for only a few days before returning to SWITZERLAND to complete his rest cure, but in deference to the wishes of the British Authorities, postponed his departure until 1st September. Six days after his departure, the news of Ktng Faisal’s death inPage 3. SWITZERLAND reached BAGHDAD, and, on the norning of 8th September, before the news nad buen disclosed to the general public, his son was proclaimed King Ghazi the Eirst. Ob SCth September, the new King was betrothed to Princess Aliya, the second daughter of his uncle ex-King Ali, The reason for this haste was the fact that the constitution only allows succession in the direct male line of descent, so that it was imperative that the new King should have a son as soon as possible. ^_ The Oabinet which had resigned on the death of King Faisal was re-appointed by his successor, but for some time appeared to be uncertain what was likely to happen. The forceful personality of the late King had played such an important part in the political life of the country that his death left a gap which it seemed to be impossible to fill; it was considered quite certain that it could not be filled by his 22 year old successor; there was also a godd deal of anxiety in political circles as to the outcome of the League of Nations’ enquiry into the Assyrian affair, since part of the European press was urging the necessity for a resumption of the mandate by GREAT BRITAIN. 8 * ’Iraqi case was presented to the Council of the League of Nations at GENEVA on 4th October by Yasin, who was accompanied by Nuri; the former returned to 3AGHLAD on 21st October, while Nuri proceeded to PARIS to make arrangements about the Assyrians who had remained in SYRIA. As soon as Yasin returned, Rashid Ali, the Premier, asked the King to dissolve Parliament. The reason given was that the Cabinet did not feel that it had the confidence of the existing Chamber, which essential in ordur to carry out its proposed pro gramme of reforms; the real reason probably was that tht Government, ani particularly Yasin, feared criticism of the attitude adopted at GENEVA, and hoped to be left to their own devices for a few months v/hile the elections were being held. To the general surprise, King Ghazi rc-fused to dissolve Parliament and when, in consequence, the cabinet resigned, their resignations were accepted. . N ? ri re ^ urr *ed to BAGHDAD on 4th November, and a few days iator, the composition of the new Cabinet unat:r Jamil Madfa’i was announced. It comprised for tne most part, ex-ministers of no outstanding ability v.uth tne exception of Nuri, who was appointed Minister of foreign Affairs and acting Minister of 3e*ence. Rashid A!i, Yasin and his supporter, Ja’afar Abu Timman, and Hikmat Beg Sulaiman, who had been Minister of Interior unng the Assyrian affair in August, were excluded and tne last two resigned their seats in Parliament. Upon taxing office, the new Government announced no programme and their present policy seems to be to remain on good terms with GREAT BRITAIN and to create a breathing space in which ’IRA3 can take stock of the entirely new situation created by the removal of King Faisal from the political stage. Nuri is the strong man of the Govern- ment, and is at present fn control of the situation; there is no opposition in Parliament worthy of the name, ' although at present discredited and without a following, probably remains a power to be reckoned with at some time in the future.Page 4. SOCIAL AKD ECONOMIC . 10* There has luring the past year been a steady reduction in the nuiLber of Lvitish adviser 3 employed by the ’Iraqi Govorniuont and almost all those retained have been withdrawn from the Provinces to BAGHDAD* The usefulness of the British adviser has also de creased since it is noticeable that the ’Iraqi official is reluctant to seek advice and often prefers to take action in his own way even though such action may land him in difficulties. 11. Towards the end of the year, there was a general post amongst the Government officials and a number of Mutasarrifs, Qaimmaqams, and Mudirs, changed places with one another; this new policy which is a feature in ’IRAQ today, is having a definite effect on the attitude of the people towards the Government, formerly the government official remained in one post for some years and became so well-known to the people that they went with their troubles to him rather as to the individual than to the official. With the more frequent changes which are the custom nowadays, officials are not personally so well-known and so are consulted more in their official capacity with a consequent increase in the prestige or unpopularity of the Government rather than of the individual. 12. Another change which is becoming evident, is the creation of new classes and class consciousness. Prior to 1915, the population of ’IRAQ was tribal and largely nomadic. It was easy to gain a living, and food was plentiful; the rich men kept open house and the universal fraternity enjoined by the Qoran was observed. The feudal Shaikh was always available to the petitioner, both in his own house and as he rode about the land. 13. Today, irrigation schemes have settled most of the people on the land and the power of the feudal shaikh has been much curtailed and placed in the hands of the effendi class of government official. To accommodate the latter and other persons who have recently made money by commercial enterprise, a vast number of new houses have sprung up round BAGHDAD. This newly rich community has no traditional respon sibility towards the poorer classes and regard them with disdainful pity rather than with helpful sympathy. 14. At the same time, there has been a large influx from country to town of young men seeking employ ment in the brickworks and factories or hoping to take advantage of their newly conferred education by obtain ing a post as a clerk or minor government official. These young men have no Caudal overlord to whom they can go for a meal when hungry or for advice when in doubt about their future welfare. Even if they try to souk out some official, access to him is difficult for he travels to his office in a saloon motor car and when there, is protected by a number of clerks and minor officials. There are today in BAGHDAD a number ofPage 5. young men without work or means and with nothing to do but wander about the streets hungry and disgruntled, naturally blaming westernisation‘for their misfortunes, and providing a fertile soil for anti-3uropean agitation 15. ?or this reason, the boycott of the Electric Light Company (managed by Belgians), a movement started in October by vendors of oil lamps, soon became of political importance and necessitated the banishment of seven of the ringleaders to the SULAIMANI Liwa, where they are to remain under police supervision for six months. With the completion of work on the I.P,C, pipe line, the consequent discharge of many of the Iraqi employees, and the cessation of building activity in BAGHDAD, the number of unemployed will probably increase rapidly during 1934 and may prove a considerable embarrassment to the government.Page 6. SECTION II - INTERNAL SECURITY. 16* At the beginning of the year, KURDISTAN was quiet. The successful conclusion to the BARZAN Operations ha&lt;i had a subduing effect on the tribes, and Shaikh Ahmed being out of the country, there was no central figure around which discontented and rebellious elements could assemble. The position was, nowever, somewhat marred by the presence of his brotners and other leaders of the late rebels in the neighbourhood of the Turkish frontier. Diiring April and May trouble was experienced by their delivering raids on ’Iraqi villages for the enforcement of money dues. A force was concentrated, and, with the co-operation of the Turks, succeeded in persuading the raiders to accept a liberal amnesty which granted them afree pardon and allowed them to return to their villages with their arms on promises of future good behaviour. In July the Turks handed over Shaikh Ahmed to the ’Iraqi Government from whom he received most considerate treatment. The Government’s liberality in its treat ment of the BARZAN Tribes was due, not so much to a desire to waive past offences, as to the gathering difficulties of the Assyrian situation which indicated that it might be necessary to obtain help from the Kurdish tribes, 17* On 4th January Mar Shimun returned from GENEVA where he had represented the unsatisfactory position of the Assyrians to the League of Nations and had obtained an undertaking that the ’Iraqi Government would select a foreign expert to assist in settling the landless Assyrians. In the meantime, the Government had appointed Malik Khoshaba as leader and spokesman of that group of Assyrians who were anxious to co-operate with the Government in the matter of land settlement. 18• Despite advances made by the Government, Mar Shimun refused to co-operate in the land settlement policy unless his temporal as well as spiritual authority was recognisud. Gradually, as the Mar Shimun’s recalcitrant attituue became increasingly clear, the gap widened between his adherents and those other Assyrians who recognised that the best prospects for their future lay in co-operation with the Government. Peelings began to run high in the north and a trivial incident in which Assyrians were accused of throwing stones on to the roof of a house occupied by 'Iraq Army officers was taken as an Assyrian insult to the Army as a whole, l 9 * In June, the situation rapidly deteriorated with the coming into prominence of Yacou son of Malik Ismail as a leader of the Mar Shimun element, and his leading a party of about 200 armed men into the district north east of DOHUK and refusing to come in and explain his action. He eventually yielded to persuasion, but only just in time to save the Government from the necessity of fetching him in by force. Meanwhile,Page 7. in BAGHDAD all chance of reconciliation between Mar Shimun ana the Government had passed, and, fearing that Mar Shimun’s reappearance in MOSUL would have an undes irable effect, the Government aecided to detain him in BAGHDAD* 20. A final effort was made by the administration in July to retrieve the situation by calling a meeting of all the Assyrian leaders, explaining the position to them, and making a final appeal to them to accept a position to which there was no practicable alternative. The meeting failed, and in July Yacou led a party of about 1,000 armed Assyrians over the frontier into SYRIA. The position was judged by the Government as the most suitable that would be likely to occur for the disarming and final quelling of the discontented section of the Assyrians. It was therefore decided to bring matters to a head and the Army was accordingly concentrated in the area near the Syrian frontier. 21. Negotiations with the French for the peaceful disarmament of the Assyrians failed and when they crossed the river back into ’IRAQ on 4th August, fight ing broke out with the Army piquets. The Assyrians broke through the Army’s cordon, and the Kurdish tribes, many of which had previously been issued with arms, were called in to assist in hunting them down. A number of Assyrian villages were looted and about 600 Assyrians w^re killed; the majority of them had volun tarily surrendered to the Army or police and many of them had had nothing to do with the migration to SYRIA. The worst excesses occurred at SIMEL on 11th August, and a reign of terror in the area of operations and a state of acute alarm amongst the Christian population in general were produced. On 18th August, however, a notice was issued that the rebellion was at an end and threatening with legal punishment anyone molesting Assyrians. A camp was formed at MOSUL for women and children whose menfolx haa perished and the depend ents of the Assyrian Levies were moved to HINAILI. 22* It was early appreciated by the ’Iraq Govern ment that the behaviour of the Army might evoke foreign intervention through the League. Such an eventuality would have had strong reactions on the Nationalist out look of the people, and its effect would have been to render the position of the Government precarious. Steps were therefore taken to prevent its occurrence. Outbursts of anti-foreign, and particularly anti-British sentiment in the press and in public declaration wore condoned, and even encouraged, ana at the same time it was allowed to be knov/n that foreign intervention might result in the affronted population revenging themselves on the whole Christian community in the North. The declaration of the League in October shewed that no intervention was contemplated and the violence of political feeling quickly abated.Page 8. 23, Efforts ? 7er3 made to rehabilitate the evicted Assyrian villagers by encouraging them to return to their villages, and by organising material aid. These efforts met with only partial success. Attempts to restore loot produced little result, primarily owing to the fact that thb officials were afraid of antagonising the Kurds, Compensation was slow, insufficient, and grudging, and though the policy of Oovernment in advocating resettle ment was straightforward, lack cf sympathy on the part of the junior executive officials in applying it has been more than anything else responsible for its failure. The year ends with a very small fraction of the Assyrians in the DCHTJK and SHAIKHAN Qadhas back on the land. In the undisturbed areas the Assyrians carry on a normal economic life, but share the outlook of their more unfort unate kinsmen in their utter lack of trust in Government, and in their hope that a satisfactory offer from the League will be forthcoming which will allow them to leave 1 IRAQ. 24, Apart from the Assyrian situation, affairs in KURDISTAN are more satisfactory than they have been for some tine. It was only natural that the Kurds should have eagerly accepted the opportunity offered by Govern ment to obey their natural instinct to loot Assyrian villages. There were one or two instances of Assyrians murdered by Kurds and it took some time for the general wave of lawlessness which had been engendered to die down. The Government’s policy was to conciliate the Kurds and so it was necessary to overlook offences, and to refrain from pressing the Kurdish tribes in the interests of justice for the Assyrians, There is no indication however, that the Kurdish leaders will adopt a truculent attitude now that they are in an advantageous position vis-a-vis the Government, Prom the tribesmen’s point cf view, the Government succesofully quelled the Assyrian outbreak, and their respect for its power has consequently increased. The Kurds are likely to remain orderly and well disposed to the Government as long as the latter’s conciliatory attitude is maintained. CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ’IRAQ . 25, Apart from the manifestations of Shia unrest in the Middle and Lower Euphrates districts during the month of May, to the origin and extent of which refer ence has already been made in paragraph 4, the year 1933 was characterised by an atmosphere of unusual tranquillity in the tribal districts. This was due to a variety of causes, the three principal ones being:- the closer association of the loading shaimhs with the government and with the trend of political thought in the Capital; a general observance of the ’’wait and see” policy, advocated by the late King during his visit to the Middle Euphrates district early in 1933, which lasted up to the tine of his death in September; and, finally, the fact that the rains during the winter of 1932/1933 had been adequate, the flood period in both the Euphrates and Tigris had been normal and problems of irrigation had consequentj_y caused the minimum amount of tension between tribal cultivators.Page 9. 26. Outside the actual towns representing the administrative headquarters of the respective Liwas, little interest was shown either in the PALESTINE disturbances with their resultant attempted Jewish boycoDt in * or ev^n in the Assyrian situation in the i.lOSUL Liwa. The tribal Shaikhs satisfied their national sentiments by elaborate protestations of loyalty to the Crown, and parochial affairs, only slightly disturbed by the subsequent death of the King, continued to occupy their major interests. 2T. Tribal tranquillity has not, how^v^r, con noted a general increase in law and ordvjr throughout the provincial districts; murder, especially as a deterrent to sexual peccadillos, is still a most common offence; hold-ups of road traffic have occurred in most districts; traffic in firearms, prohibited by the Government and almost stamped out under the British administration, has definitely increased, especially in the DPiTANIYAH Liwa where the Holy City of NAJAP forms the principal market. In the summer of 1933, the British Ambassador commented on the laxity in con trol exercised by government officials in the southern Liwas, but, although the comment was merited and the gravity of the situation appreciated by the responsible authorities in BAGHDAD, the Assyrian troubles in the MOSUL Liwa in August deflected all interest from the south and conditions had shown no appreciable improve ment up to the end of 1933.Pago 10. SECTIO N III INDUSTRIES &amp; RESO URCES. GENER/vL S URV EY. • 28* although the general commerce of T IRA^ showed a marked improvement during 1933 as compared with 1932, notably owing..to tho expansion of trade with PERSIA and the advance in prices of exports such as wool, hides and furs, no progress was made with any of the more im portant projects visualised in the Capital Works plan. The large amount of money flowing into tho country from oil royalties and construction of the Pipe Line caused a repercussion on trade in general, and the purchasing power of the country moved to a higher basis. The economic life of the country, however, still depends on the volume of its exports and, as tnese are mainly of an agricultural character, it is essential that such projects as the building of the HABBANIYAH reservoir, the GHARRAF Scheme and other measures calculated to in crease the agricultural prosperity of the country by the conservation and distribution of its water supply, should be given priority of consideration. No serious attempt has yet been made to improve the general qual ity of 1 1RAQ’s main exports - dates, wheat, wool and hides - and ungraded consignments of these commodities continue to fetch low prices in the world markets in comparison with the products of other nations. Thus, until some effort is made to collate the individual ef forts of the small holder and the existing Directorate of Agriculture is either reformed as a Ministry or at least re-organised on a more active basis, ’IRAQ will continue to lag behind her more progressive neighbours and depend for tho major portion of her revenue on roy alties derived from the foreign exploitation of her natural resources. June an 1 Iraqi delegation composed of Yasin, Nuri, and Rustam Beg Haidar, attended the Economic Con ference in LONDON, their main intention being to negot- iate a loan for the construction of the GHARRAF and HA3BANIYAH irrigation works and to make financial arrange ments for the BAGHDAD - HAIFA railway. It appears, however, that little resulted from the conference though the question of a loan to the Government is still under discussion. The Government is, however, eager to pro ceed with its irrigation schemes, and a tender submitted by a British firm in respect of the HAB3ANIYAH scheme has been practically accepted, and the Government possess sufficient funds to enable this work to start. Tenders have now been invited for the construction of the GHARRAF Barrage but it is improbable that there will be develop ments in this respect until the settlement of a loan has been effected.Page 11. OIL. 30. Rapid progress was made by the ’Iraq Petroleum Company during 195o and the welding and burying of the pipe line is now complete on all three sections, KIRKUK - HADITHA, HALITIIA - HAIFA, RADITHA - TRIPOLI, with the exception of the pumping station points which must re main unconnected until thoso stations are constructed. It is expected that all pumping stations will be com pleted in 1934. In approximately two months time, it is intended to pump oil along the line from KIRKUK to HADITHA for testing purposes, and with the completion of the pumping stations, it is anticipated that oil will be running along the entire length of pipe line before the end of 1934, The provisions under the amended con cession granted to this company by the ’Iraq Government will thus be complied with by a date considerably earlier than had originally been expected. 31. The British Oil Development Company, a subsid iary branch of Mosul Oil Fields Ltd., which was granted a concession by the ’Iraq Government in 1932 to prospect and drill for oil in the lands west of the TIGRIS and north of the 33rd parallel of latitude, was reported to have struck oil towards the und of 1933. Reports re garding the progress of this company have not been given much publicity, but it is probable that 1934 will see a general increase in activity in the SHERGAT Area. CIVIL AVIATION . 32. The new airport for civilian aircraft at BAGHDAD 'VEST was officially opened in April by H,M. King Faisal. 33. Three civil air lines are at present operating through 'IRAQ:- (a) Impe rial Airways. ENGLAND to SINGAPORE. (b) R oyal Dutch ^ir Lines . CROYDON to BATAVIA. (via HOLLAND). ( c ) Air Orien t. MARSEILLES to HA JOI (French Inao-China). These three services all operate a weekly two-way ser vice and convey both mails and passengers. 34. ’Iraq Airwork Ltd., which is British owned, in tended to operate a mail and passenger service between BAGHDAD and LARNICA (CYPRUS) connecting with the Lloyd Triestino Company’s liners, but received a serious set back in March when its first Spartan Cruiser crashed at RAMADI en route for BAGHDAD. Since this event there have been no further developments regarding this ser vice, but the company is at present negotiating with the ’Iraq Government concerning the inauguration of a daily passenger service between BAGHDAD and BASRAH, and a weekly passenger service between BAGHDAD and TEHRANPage 12. THE D ESLIRT ROUTa . 35. During the year 'Che overland route to the Mediterranean ports was 'busier than in 1932, and most shipments to EUROPE and UIERIC^ are 'being made by that route. Reductions in the rates of the transport charges have been possible owing to the large volume of transport and the increase m the number of companies operating by the desert route. The Nairn Transport Company have conveyed considerably more passengers than in previous years. This notable increase is due mainly to the number of Italians who are employed in railway construction work in PERSIA and who have been sent to PERSIA by the overland route.Pago 13. SECTION IV ARMY ,\ND AIR FORCES. 36 During 1933, the strength of the Army was increased hy one ‘battalion nf infantry, making a total of 12, and Ay cue cn^in^r platoon. a section of Armoured Cars was also formed and at present has two cars, Crossley six-wn^cl^u. cnassis with bodies con structed locally. in all branches as far as finance will permit. Early in 1934, one 18 pr u battery and throe frontier battalions will be formed. The men for the latter are to be Kurds drawn from those now serving in the ’Iraq Army and officers will be mainly of Kurdish nationality. The battalions are to be stationed at BILLEH, DIANA and HALABJA. 38. Recruiting is still on a voluntary basis, but the amended draft of the National Service Bill, passed to the Chamber of Deputies for its initial reading at the end of 1933, was received v/ith much enthusiasm. It is unlikely to be enforced in the near future, as it is estimated that the census will not be completed for two years. Opposition to the measure must be expected from the Shias of the Middle Euphrates area and from KURDISTAN, but there are indications that the opposition is growing less strong. a really effective military machine. its morale suf fered badly as a result of the failures during the BARZAN Operations in 1932, and it was partly for this reason that its success in dealing with the Assyrian troubles, as described earlier in paragraphs 17 et seq, was exaggerated by the Government and general public. It is doubtful whether, quite apart from the SIMEL in cident, the Army really had very much to be proud of. ihe material of which the rank and file are composed is on the whole quite good, but is badly handicapped by the quality of the officers, particularly those in the more senior ranks. Most of these are of the effendi class from the cities, had Turkish training, dislike hardship and discomfort, and earn little respect from their men. Some improvement should result from the new officers ordinance which enforces a maximum age limit in each rank and prohibits promotion unless a specified percent age of service has been spent with a Unit. 4G. The Inspector General reported that the level of training reached by the Army in 1933 was well below the normal. This was probably partly duo to the de pleted strength of the military mission. Owing to the fact that a number of contracts had expired, and new ones had not been arranged, instead of the establishment of eleven, there were at the end of the year only four officers serving in ’IRAQ, and of those, throe were of junior rank. The policy is to increase the Army gradually 59 It cannot be said that the Army is at presentPage 14 RO Y,iL * IRxV^ AIR F ORCii . 41. During 1933, the strength of the Royal ’Iraq Air ^orco was inervased hy the addition of eight D.H.84 aircraft (Dragons with two G-ipsy engines) which were flo-n out from ENGLAND in May. 42. In November, Zaim Ismail bin Ibrahim Namuq, who was then Q.M.G. at Army Neadquartors, was appointed Director of the Force which now comprises:- (i) A Service Squauron of two Dragon flights and one Puss Moth flight. (ii) A flying training school of thrue flight Each flight has tnree Gipsy Moths and there are three in reserve. 43. Service training was severely handicapped by extensive modifications which had to be carried out on the Dragon aircraft and by the necessity for detaching two flights to the north for some months on account of operations. The flying training school which has one British officer and two sergeant pilot instructors has made very good progress. Nineteen officer pupils were admitted on 1st June, one died and three were found un fit for flying duties, but the other fifteen had flown solo by the end of September. There are now ^ifty-one aircraft apprentices under training as mechanics. The work of the twenty-four who are due to complete train ing next April, is of a high quality and a further twenty-two will be placed unuer training on 1st May. The Air Officer Commanding recently inspected the force at the invitation of the ’Iraqi authorities and ex pressed himself as being very satisfied with the admin istration and general efficiency. 44. A Squadron of twelve Hawker Audax aircraft is being formed this year and six of the aircraft arc to be flown out from ENGLAND in May.Page 15. SgOTIQN V_ JO^IGN RKL, ^TIONS. TURKEY. 4-q . Little information has buun obtained from TURKEY during the past year and during recent months it has boon confined to one or t-vo articles in the news papers. The most 1 iportant event seems to have been the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Turkish Republic, A reception was held by the Turkish Minister in BAGHD/D while in TURKEY the celebrations lasted three days and a special feature was the broadcast of speeches throughout the country on the benefits which have been bestowed by the Republic. ^ military review, in which a whole Army Corps took part, was held at and the drill and bearing of the troops is reported to have been excellent. It was noticeable that the representatives of the U.S.S.R. wore treated as the chief guests of hon our throughout the celebrations. regime, TURKEY has during the past ten years made rapid strides along the path to westernisation. Much has been done to improve communications, but in the more re mote districts, they still remain very primitive. During 1933, ,-910,000,000 was voted for new railway con struction, and, although the expenditure is to be spread ovur a number of years, this represents a very large sum for a country of TURKEY’S limited resources. A new port is to be constructed at EREGLI on the BLACK SEA at a cost of £1,160,000 and in February, an air service was instituted between ISTANBUL and ANK.&amp;u two trivial incidents, suen as raids to steal a few sheep, but, as in the matter of the BARZAU rebels, referred to in paragraph 16 above, TURKEY has shown a desire for friendly relations and a willingness to ob serve the Treaty of non-aggression and bon-voisinage entered into with ’IRAQ a few years ago. # IK Q is naturally interested in the rapid development of her neighbour in the north under the in fluence of its military dictator. The reported strength and efficiency of the Army and the enthusiasm for its Air Service, within recent years £5,000,000 has been collected by the Air League and handed over to the Gov ernment for the purchase of military aircraft, have un doubtedly had an influence on ’IRAQ’S determination to augment her military strength to the limit of the country’s financial resources. wnij.se tne uompany received an extension of the conces sion for thirty additional years.

I.M. the Shah was taken as an indication of the growing spirit of nationalism and independence in PERSIA and so attracted considerable interest in ’IRAQ* 50, Later in the year this spirit was reflected in the BASIDU incident. Since 1323, the British flag has flown at BASIDU, a snail harbour m QISH1I Island used as a British Naval Station, and, after the removal of the coaling station to IIENJAM Island in 1913, a care taker was left at BASIDU to maintain the flag. On 31st July, 1933, a party landed from a Persian sloop, hauled down and tore the flag, telling the caretaker that if he hoisted it again he would be shot. The outrage was dis covered by H.M. S. ’’Bideford' on 5th August; the flag was replaced and an armed guard put ashore. An official apology was demanded from the Persian Government, which reluctantly complied, denying all responsibility and stating that the action was one of an irresponsible sub ordinate. This is improbable, for since 1926 the Persian Government has shown an increasing interest in BASIDU, whilst in 1928 armed occupation was threatened and an attempt was made to collect customs dues. In October, 19o3, following the flag incident, a further attempt was maue to establish customs rights. TheMudir of Customs boaraea a dhow in BASIDU waters to inspect her papers, stating that he was acting on written instructions. He was arrested by the officer in charge of the guard and a strong protest was lodged by the British Government. The tone of the reply was by no means conciliatory, asked GREAT BRITAIN to justify her armed intervention in Persian territory, and de manded redress. Tith the object of restoring British prestige, the 1st Destroyer Flotilla was sent from the MEDITERRANEAN for a cruise in the PERSIAN GULF. Oil was not poured on troubled waters by a very outspoken article on the conditions in PERSIA in the 'Times' of 28th November to which the Shah took great exception, and relations with GREAT BRITAIN were thus somev/hat strained. 52. Teymourtache died in prison on October 3rd; he had been the King’s right hand man and with him res ponsible for the po-iicy of reform which is working such great changes in the country. Teymourtache was of good family and was educated in PE rn R0GRAD and his abil ity was proved in four successive Parliaments and later as Governor and Governor-General. Then H.I.M. the Shah decided to exercise more direct control of Govern ment through a Ministry of Court, Teymourtache was selected as Minister. Teymourtache had advanced ideas on education, emancipation of women and westernisation generally; with the full support of the King, he was most active in promoting various schemes of 'reform and came to be considered as the power behind the throne but this led to his ultimate downfall. During his visit to EUROPE in 1932, his enemies managed to under- I fi n DrToa?A P ? S ^ t i? n ^ nd news 01 ' his alm ^st royal reception in RlbsIA led the Snah to suspect his personal aims. On returning to P^RGIA, Teymourtache was dismissed from oiiice ana was subsequently arrested on charges of brib ery and corruption, condemned to refund 516,000 and to 10 years imprisonment, but he failed to survive one year of this sentence.g&gt;® r\ Page 17. 5 1 5 * , The fal1 P^-wur jf Tcyiiiourtache, put no check upon the Shah's progruuiue of reform ana uevelop- ment. ihe most important project fur the moment is &gt;ns ^ r uctio;n of the Trans-Persian railway. in May ^hanish—Swedish c mipany signed a contract for de- ° f th0 line BANDER SHAH on BAKDER S SrATTPrS hpi’ the i &gt;orticn from TEHRAN to tr J bc ‘ finished by March, 1939.

The future of PERSIA as ’IRAK’S neighbour is a n interesting subject of speculation. The progress made during the past few years has been most remarkable, rut since the dismissal of Teymourtache, H.I.M. the Shah xas carried on practically single-handed; he is reported ;? be v a J lck man and liable to fits of ungovernable rage pr °bably exaggerated by his ministers //hen they wish to dissuade foreign diplomats from visit ing him. Hhile education, industry and communications have been developing, the administration in outlying failuci id Pace and it is quite poss ible that the removal of the Shah’s guiding hand would be quickly followed by a rapid deterioration of the sit- throughout the country. Persian raids into o r, ^ conf lned to the occasional incursion par y o bandits would prebably become more serious in character and neceosilate the reinforcement of police and army detachments on tne eastern frontier; on*the eth^r hand the possibility of organised invasion from PmAblA tould become still more remote and the respon sibilities of the Royal Air Pirce in ’IRAQ would be thereby decreased.

Relations between frontier officials were main tained on an amicable basis. The rainfall during the winter period 1932-33 was adequate and, although the Iraqi nomads and semi-nomads moved ^ut to their cus tomary grazing areas in the vicinity of the ’IRAQ-NAJD tr*' ntier, there was ample grazing for their flocks and the usual bickering wv-ich arises when a suction is com pelled, for economic reasons, to cross the frontier zone aid not take place during the period under review. A certain amount of inter-tribal stock lo- ting occurred during the period when the Ruwalla of SYRIA and the ^aof IRAQ were brought into annual proximity in the wiiD^AN Area, but no raids of a serious nature were re- P or e • 7n February, 19o5, Ibn Sa’ud’s tax collectorsPago 19.

At the end of May, 19od, tne Gomiuanaant of Police of the Southern Desert left on an official visit to JAUf where he discussed with Ahdul Aziz as ijudairi, the Governor of the Province, the problem of inter-tribal raiding on the ’IRAQ-NAJD border and the mutual return of looted stock; a broad basis of settlement was agreed upon and subsequent meetings, accompanied by the inevitable de lays and arguments common to a tribal Majlis, took place during the remaining months of the year. BAGHDAD, H.M. the late King Faisal, who appeared^to realise that the association of the Hashimite Family with the Rafaua Revolt (organised in the summer of 19^2 with the object of re-establishing the Hashimite Family in the H3JAZ. and finally squashed by Ibn Sa’ud in August of tliat year) had brought him into rather undesir able prominence, viewed the abortive settlement of the ASiR revolt and the subsequent steady deterioration of relationships between the Imam Yahya and Ibn Sa’ud with detuchud interest. Visitors from SA’UDIA arriving in Baghdad were always sure of a welcome and financial re compense in respect of any information they brought, but there was at no time any suggestion that E.lC King Faisal had other than an academic, if vivid, interest in the problems that beset the ruler of the neighbour ing state of SA’UDiA. The death of King Faisal in September precJuded any active participation on his part in affairs in ASIR, but the trend of events is still followed with the keenest interest in Palace cir- c^ub, and, though a pious hope is expressed that hostil ities nay be avoided, there is little doubt that nows of a decisive reverse to tne da’idi forces in ASIR would be received with enthusiasm. 61. Possibly owing the Sa’udi Government’s pre occupation with affairs in the south, but more probably owing to lack of funds or any genuine interest in the project, no further progress was made during 1933 with the proposed pilgrim boute for m^tor transport between -RAQ and the KEJAZ; this, together with other ambitious schemes for internal expansion in SA’UDIA, including he foundation of a State Bank and the construction of the railroad between JEDDA and MECCA, appear to have been aropped through lack of necessary funds.

Although ’IRAQ has, since her release from the British ? T andate in October, 1932, extended a sym pathetic interest towards Arab Nationalist aspirations in PALdOTINE, she has not considered it n^cu^sary to associate herself in any direct manner witxi movements arising out of the various anti-Zionist demonstrations which took place in 1933 as a protest against Jewish immigration. The ’Ira^i nationalist press devoted a great deal of attention to tne anti—Zionist movement, but was careful to stress its anti-3ritish aspect in preference to the Anti-Jewish one. The most import ant event in PALEBTIN 1 ], from the ’Iraqi point-of-viuw, was the breakdown of 1^cal control in October, 1933, when severe rioting took place in JERUSALEM and was followed by similar demonstrations in the provincial districts. The following brief r^sum^ of affairs in PALESTINE indicates the extent to which local politics in ’IRAQ were influenced by these external disorders. 63. iiiarly in 1933 feeling began to run high against the heavy Jewish immigration figures and the sale )f land to the Jews; there was much indignation with the Govern ment and an Arab non-party conference met in JERUSALEM in March. Resolutions were passed to adopt a policy of non-co-operation, to boycott British goods, and to raise funds to prevent the purchase of land by the Jews. The Arab executive was reviveu to form h governing body forthese activities wmen, However, made little progress. The question of the eviction of Arabs from the V/ADI HaWaRITH district, an area reserved for Jewish settlement, although it was satisfactorily settled later, aroused intense feeling in PALESTINE during the month of June, and was reflected in BAGHDAD by numerous articles in the local press and an abortive attempt to follow the Palestinian lead and boycott Jewish goods. Numerous societies came into existence, of which the Young Men’s Congress and the Moslem-Christian Union were the most active. The visit of King Eaisal to PALESTINE, enroute for EUKOPS, was a further outstanding event in the political situation during tms month, ana revealed an underlying desire on tne ^art of the Palestinian and Syrian community for Pan-Arab unity; it also indicated the confidence which certain sections were prepared to place in the King of ’IRAQ as tne recognised leader of the Arab Nationalist movement. 65. The PALESTINE Government’s report on immigration was the signal early in October f^r intense activity which culminated on October 13th, in a demonstration )f some 2,000 participants in JERUSALEM. This was suppressed by the police. In spite of Government prohibition, the Arab executive ordered strikes and demonstrations in all the principal towns. Prom October 27th to November 2nd the police were attacked and forced to fire on the mobs in JA^A, HAIFA, NABLUS and TULKARAM. Casualties to the police were one killed and twenty-eight wounded, whilst of the rioters, twenty-six were killed and about 200 injured. By November 3rd, the movement was broken and the leaders arrested.Page 21 66, It is signifioant that the violence of the rioters was dir^ctuci solely against the Police and not the Jews, Of the iaoter, ten ^nly were injured in an accidental clash with the motors at HAIFA. Through out tne disturbances,the British officered Arab police were loyal and shwol groat devotion to duty. Attempts were made t) organise meetings in sympathy at MOSUL, BAG-HBAD and BASRA, but met with little response for the people were far more intern.ited in the domestic situ ation resulting fr on the death of Xing Faisal and the Assyrian troubles. 67, Events in neighbouring countries are n;ted with interest in ’IRAQ, but for the moment have very little effect. It is noteworthy that, during the memorial service, which took place in BAGHDAD on 24th October in accordance with Arab custom and on the fortieth day after the burial of the late King Faisal, it was left to the delegates from PALESTINE and TRANS JORDAN to champion, in a variety of lengthy speeches, the cause of Arab unity. The ’Iraqis themselves listened with polite and academic interest to the opin ions of their visitors, but there is little doubt that the speeches made on this solemn occasion brought home to them a very definite realisation of the considerable degree of emancipation they had already attained. The consolidation of their own position became a matter of greater importance than the encouragement of National ist aspirations in others. To say that the Pan-Arab movement is dead w^uld be equivalent to saying that the average Englishman is not pro-British. Thus, when Haji Amin left JERUSALEM in May on a visit to ’IRAQ and INDIA, he was accorded the welcome due to him as Grand Mufti, but his appeal for funds to found a Moslem Uni versity met with little response in BAGHDAD. Revivals in Pan-Arabianism at the moment denote that some party considers it may help their own interests; King Faisal supported the movement as he hoped it might help to the throne of SYRIA and King Ghasi may follow in his foot steps; Abbas Hilmi, the ex-Khedive, is a supporter for he probably hopes it may prove a source of irritation King Fuad; Adil Arslan, Ihsan al Jabiri, and others may be described as professional nationalists to whom the French position in SYRIA is a constant source of annoyance and they consider that Pan-Arabianism may be a means to remove it. Thus, though the Pan-Arab move ment is not dead and even shows signs of revival in PALESTINE, it seems unlikely fvjr tne present to become of much importance to the situation in ’IRAQ. SYRIA . 68, ’IRAQ has always taken more interest in the affairs of SYRIA than in those of her other neighbours, partly because the late King Faisal had reigned for a short time in DAMASCUS and undoubtedly hoped to do so again, and also because, while both countries were under mandate, it w'as easy to compare conditions in the two and the nationalist parties in each had similar aspir ations. During the past year, therefore, although ’IRAQ has been chiefly occupied with her own affairs, events across her western frontier have attracted sympathetic interest.Page 22. b9. During his last year of office, M. Ponsot, the late High Commissioner who loft for PRANCE on 2nd July, spared no effort to arrange a treaty for SYRIA on the lines of the ’Iraqi-British Treaty, and, during the latter part of his regime, his dealings with the Syrian nationalist party shewed gr^at indulgence and were in strong contrast with his unsympathetic attitude towards the domestic difficulties of the Lebanese Republic. Unfortunately, his conciliatory attitude was judged by the Syrians to be due to weakness, while in the LEBANON he estranged even the Christian elements who had pre viously been the strongest supporters of the Prench Mandate. 70. M* Ponsot was appointed to SYRIA in 1926 just after the Druse Rebellion had been stamped out and was faced with a very difficult situation, for the Syrians owing to their sympathy with the Druse were distinctly hostile to the Prench. By means of a con ciliatory attitude, M. Ponsot managed to re-establish order and security, and, at the end of 1930 an organic law was passed defining SYRIA as a Republic with mo Chamber. The elections held at the end of the follow ing year had to be abandoned owing to riots in DAMASCUS, and, when resumed, practically at the point of the bayonet, resulted in a moderate majority government with Mohammed Ali Bey as President. 71. M. Ponsot was kept sc busy in SYRIA that he had little time to spare fer the affairs of the LEBANON where a republican government had been formed in great haste by his predeceosor just before his departure and was rapidly reducing the country to a state of chaos, which the Lebanese attributed to rotten Prench admin istration. Efforts in SYRIA proved abortive, owing to the insistence of the nationalists that a Treaty for SYRIA was impossible unless LATAKIA and the JEBEL DRUSE were included. Always a poor sailor, M. Ponsot’s health failed whenever political waters became troubled; at the end of March, 1933, the French Chamber had in structed him to conclude a Treaty without delay, but by the end of May n^ progress had been maae; after six weeks in bed, the doctors prescribed a complete rest and M. Ponsot left for PRANCE witn his tasx unaccomplished. 72. Count Damien de Martel landed at BEIRUT on 12th October and at once managed to convey the impression that a new regime had started. Quite soon he was given an opportunity of showing his mettle for grossly ex aggerated reports were received about the anti-Govern ment demonstrations in PALESTINE described in paragraph 65 above. A demonstration in sympathy took place in DAMASCUS on 3rd November, and an attempt was made to loot a police station, but Prench armed forces were present in great strength, the mob was fired upon and dispersed rapidly. Attempted demonstrations in TYRE, 3IB0N, TRIPOLI and LATAKIA were dispersed without serious incident.Page 23. 73. ‘ Count de Martel then produced the expected treaty Vhich v T as signed hy French and Syrian represent atives n n 16th Novenher, hut when it was sent for rati fication pandtn'niuni broke l-oose in the Chamber of Deities, and the High Commissioner adjourned Parliament for four days. The day before it was due to reassemble, the High Commissi'.ner wrote to the president to the effect that the Chi Her was obviously too inexperienced t:&gt; discuss such an imp rta: t matter; the treaty was withdrawn and access t) tiio Chaiubor prohibited. 74. The wording of tne proposed treaty was very similar to that of the * Iragi-British treaty, but the real substance was contained in protocols ’'a” and M 3 U , which reserved the most important points for future settlement. The nationalists insist that unless LATAKIA and the JEEEL DRUSE arc united to SYRIA, the economic situation of the last would be quite impossible. The French also proposed to retain control of the customs and quarantine revenue, and the Syrians believe that they will be saddled with the heavy cost f Prench military occupation not only in the future, but for the past 14 years as well. 75. The next move in SYRIA is awaitod with interest in BAGHDAD. There are rumours that the Drench are not now averse to the establishment of a monarchy, and that ex-King Ali is a strong candidate for the throne, but it appears to be unlikely that they would regard with favour the adjacent countries of SYRIA and ’IRAQ both under a ruler of tne Hashimite family.
