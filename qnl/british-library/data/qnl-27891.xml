Dear Sir, With further reference to the matter of the closing of our Perim Branch, for which the authority of the Advisory Committee was given in your letter of 12th instant, we have to inform you that the Sheik Seyd - Perim cable and the Perim - Aden cable have now been permanently joined through in the Cable House at Perim.

' -'I.-L Aden 14th March 19M ho, 72 Sir I have the honour to refer to your Confidential despatch of the 27th February 1955 regarding the negotiations between His Majesty the King of the Yeaten, the Ja&amp;», and the Eastern Telegraph Company for the establishment of cable coanunication between Sheikh Said and Peri® 2. In the course of ay recent visit to S&amp;n’a I was approached by the Imam’s foreign Minister with the request that I should ask whether you can see your way to intervene in order to procure for the Government of the Yemen more favourable terms than had been offered them by the Company in August 1952 (vide the attachment to ay Confidential despatch So, 204 of the 19th October 1952). 5. The Foreign Minister handed me at the same time a copy of a letter that he had written in this connection to the Jirectorate of the International Telegraph Union at Berne on the 12th October 1952. This letter, a copy of which I enclose herewith, sets out clearly enough the '—-‘sons why the government oi the Yemen consider th t the ms offered by the Company are exorbitant. 4. The Foreign Minister explained to me that the Imam was most anxious to release himself from the Italian control of his (wireless) telegraphic communication with the outside world. His wireless installations at San’a and Hodcida had been set up by Italians, and all his messages are relayed through stations in Eritrea. He had recently been~ 1 &lt;$) n been able to replace certain of the laltan personnel in the Yemen by local operators, but in consiaeration of his political relations with Italy the Imaa felt that too sudden ijia sweeping an action in this respect would be impolitic. b. The Treaty of Friendship with the Yemen having now been signed, I recommend that the Imam’s desire for the establishment of a link between the telegraphic systems of the Yemeni Government and the Kastem Telegraph Company shoula be encouraged, ana that, if possible, the Company should be persuaded to modify their terms, which, although I am not competent precisely to criticise them, appear to me to be unfavourable to the Yemeni Government.

Please refer to my despatch No. 72 of the 14th March, on the subject of cable connections between Sheikh Said and Peri*. It is probable that the Yenen Foreign Minister will enquire on this subject when Lake goes to ^anaa. I consider it very desirable politically to give encouragettent to this project and I trust you can authorise Lake to return a favourable reply.Downing Street, 9th ^ngust, 19M. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your confidential despatch No. 7£ of the 14th of March and to your telegram of the 5rd of August on the subject of cable communication between Sheikh $ la and rerim. 2. I have been in communication with Messrs. Cable and tireless Limited on the matter, and am informed by them that they are at present negotiating for the establishment of a wireless station at Mem, and that If these negotiations reach a successful conclusion, the best method for establishing communication with the y eaen will probably be by wireless from den. The Company ;ire actively pursuing the question, but no definite indication can yet be given as to when the negotiations will be completed. 5. There will be no objection to Lieutenant Colonel Lake giving this information to the Yemen Tovernment.sir. I have the honour to refer to your Confidential deepatoh No. £Q4 of the 19th of (otober, 193*, regarding the negotiations between the Imam of the Ye&amp;en and the Eastern telegraph Company for the ra-establishment of oeble oommunioation between Sheikh Said and lerlm, suod to inform you that I haro considered, in consultation with the other interested departments of His Majesty 1 * ^oTernr*snt the suggestion made in paragraph 3 of your despatch that the Eastern Telegraph Company should be discoursed from completing an agreement with the Imam ad long as the latter maintains his antagonistic attitude towards British interests. 2. There are certain objections to adopting the course of action which you auggeot. In the first place, it would appear undesirable in principle for His I'ajeaty’s CoYernment to intervene on political grounds in a transaction by a private British Company provided the transaction is legal. Experience shows that even vhen such intervention is made with every reservation, the Company concerned is apt to hold Ills M&amp;jesty 9 a Government responsible for the commercial consequences which ensue. This consideration has, of course, additional force at a time, like the present, when trade is generally depressed. 3. Secondly, the Department of Overseas Trade, who have been consulted, do not consider it impossible that ths THE RESIDENTthe Imam may be able to obtain oable con*.unio&amp;tion vith the out aide world without renortin:; to the ^astern ^ele^qraph Company, through the medium of Companiee whioh exiat in Germany, Italy and poaaibly the United Statoe of America. It is true that no oomnunioatlon oan be establinhed between Perim and the outside world without the oo*operation of the Kastern telegraph Company who own the Perim*Aden oable. But by the use of a wireless transmitting set it would be possible for the Imam to oommunioate with other non-British wireless service© suoh, for example, as the Italian senrioe in iddis Ababa, although that service i© believed not to be wording at the present moment. It Is not desirable to encourage the Imam to seek for other means of oommunleatlon with the outside world. 4. In view of the above oon©iderations, therefore, His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that it would be undesirable to make any attempt to induce the Eastern Telegraph Company to delay the completion of an agreement with the T—m of the Yemen and I do not propose to communicate with the Company in the matter. Should the Company approach you, it would be advisable to warn them th^.t in the absence of Treaty relations between His Majesty's Government and the Imam, they cannot rely on any action by His Majesty's Govornment to assist them in main taining the terms of any contract into which they may enter with the Imam.

Department. It will be remembered that, subject to the views of the Department of Overseas Trade, this Office was inclined to agree with the Foreign Office in accepting the suggestion of the Resident at Aden that we should discourage the Eastern Telegraph Company from canpleting their agreement with the Imam for the re-establishment of cable communication between Sheikh Said and Perim, so long as the Imam maintained his hostility towards British interests and so long as there was no risk of a foreign competitor appearing on the scene (see paragraph 2 of Mr.Laithwaite’s minute on P.Z.54/33). Our attitude must now be reconsidered in the light of the memorandum addressed to the Foreign Office by the D.O.T. (P.Z.509/33), from which it appears that although communication could not be established between Perim and the outside world without the co-operation of the Eastern Telegraph Company, the Imam might be able to obtain the facilities he requires by using wireless. The D.O.T. also point out that there are objections of principle to the intervention of H.M.G. on political grounds in a transaction by a private British company. The Foreign Office are now inclined to think that no action should be taken to impede the completion of the negotiations between the Imam and the Company,and the General Post Office, although they are unable to express a view regarding the political implications of the question, stress the undesirability,in the present financial circumstances of Imperial and International Communications Ltd., of impeding the Company’s endeavours to extend their business. With/With regard to paragraph 3 of the Foreign Office letter of 21st January (P.Z.509/33) it now appears from the last Aden Intelligence Summary received here that the rumour that the Imam had ordered the raising of the embargo on trade between the Imam and Aden is without foundation. Although this Office is not very closely interested in the question it is ^suggested that we may tell the Colonial Office that we are inclined to agree with the Foreign Office point of view. ff Gu^&gt;-P.Z. 6C7/33.

It appc&amp;re to the department of Overseas Trade that two points arise, on© of fact and the ot er of principle. They are as follows (i) Whether any foreign company is technically able to lay a submarine cable from Sheikh 2aid to Perlm. (11) Whether it is expedient on general grounds that Hie Majesty's $overment should Intervene with a private company for purely political reasons. 3. %ith regard to point (1) above the department of Overseas Trad© understand that companies exist in Germany, Italy, and possible the U.3.A. who could construct and lay such a cable, but that no communication could be established between Ferla and the outside world without the co-operation of the Eastern Telegraph Company, who own the Perim-A&amp;en cable. On the other hand, by the use of a wireless transmitting set at some stage of the line of communication it would be possible for the Imam of the Yemen to communicate with other non-British wireless services such, for example, as the Italian service in Addis baba, although that is believed not to be working st the present moment. *./4* V tth regard to consldftrfctlon (11) above, the &gt;ept*pt;aent of Oversea* Trade feel that on principle it is undeelrable on general grounds for any deportment of - His Majesty’s Government to intervene on political grounds In a transaction by a private British company, provided that that transaction ia legal* The Foreign Office will recollect that even when such intervention is &amp;ade with every reserve, the companies concerned are apt to hold His Majesty*e Govemnent responsible for the commercial consequences which ensue, as was the case in regard to the former Abyssinian Corporation and the British Trade Corporation. This opinion, in which it is understood that His Majesty’s Treasury generally concur, has additional force at moments in which trade la generally depressed. It raises, aowever, a question of general principle, and it is for that reason that the itepartaent of Overseas Trade are offering their views upon this matter to the Foreign Office in order that the Foreign Office, if they do not dissent from them, may forward them to the Colonial Office, who have so far only been informed that a reply from the iepart,ment of Overseas Trade will reach them through the Foreign Office. 5* It is possible that the Foreign Office may consider in the last resort that the decision upon the matter should rest with the General Post Office. 36, Old *ueeiA treet, LOHX)H, $*f.l. 11th January, 1933.97902/32. 2 .

In adopting the course of action suggested abowe, however, he considers that due allowance must be made for the fact that the Company presusiably extract the offer which they have made to the Imam*a Government to be commercially profitable to them, and that they may therefore have some cause for grievance if, as a result of their complying with the wishes of His Majesty’s Government, an opportunity of profitable develop ment of their business is either lost or unduly delayed. 3.

Please see the letters from the Colonial Office dated 22nd November, P.Z.7083/32, and P.Z.7089/32 respectively, flagged below. The first letter deals with the general question of the negotiations with the Imam; the second with the Imam’s desire for the re-establishment of cable communication between Sheikh Said and Perim. Both have been if the subject of unofficial discussion with the Foreign Office, as the result of which it was agreed that we should h old our hand until they had replied. 2. As regards the Imam’s anxiety to re-establish cable communication, the position is briefly that the local agent of the Eastern Telegraph Company is apparently satisfied that there is little or no risk of the Imam being able to obtain the cable connection that he desires save through the Company. The D.O.T. (P.Z.7803/32) have been asked to confirm this. Subject to an affirmative reply, we may agree with the Foreign Office (P.Z.7612/32) in accepting Colonel Reilly’s suggestion that we should discourage the Company from completing their agreement with the Imam so long as the Imam maintains his presentgntagonistic attitude towards British interests and there is no risk of a foreign competitor appearing on the scene.

Sir, \c\ I hate the honour to incite a relerence to parabreph 1779 in Political Intelligence SuDanary No.261ior the week ending 12th January 1932 despatched under No.8 of the 13th January 1932, and to forward copies of a corres pondence on the subject of the proposed Perim-Sheikh : aid cable which has been supplied to me by the local Kanager of the Eastern Telegraph Company. It will be seen that the negotiations between the Company and the Imam’s Government have reached a point at which an agreement may shortly be drawn up oetween them. 2. As you are aware the Imam is atill holding out on the point of the wording of the Third Article of his proposed treaty with His Majesty’s Government, and he has so far sent no reply to my last letter to him on this subject, a copy of which was forwarded to you under my despatch No.174 dated 7th September 1932. At the same time he continues to maintain strictly his embargo on trade between the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate in spite of my representations to him on this subject. The obj&amp;ct of t-is embargo appears to be partly economic and partly political. The Ima** wishes to divert the overland trade between his country and Aden to the port of Mocha, which he is anxious to revive; and it is probable that he also intends to use His Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, London.this economic pressure on the Protectorate as a weapon with which to bargain for political concessions from His Majesty’s Government. In practice the embargo causes but little inconvenience to business people in Aden, as to them it is largely a matter of indifference whether their trade with the If «aen passes by land or by sea. On the other hand the Chiefs and people of those portions of the Protectorate through which the main trade routes pass - notably the Sultan of lahej and the Amir of Dhala* - are suffering considerable losses through the diminution ♦ in theircu a tomary transit dues. 3, It appears to me t be inappropriate that a British firm should assist the Imam in obtaining the economic advantages which the cable connection with Perim may afford him at a time when he on his side is obstructing the path of a political settlement with His Majesty’s Government and is making use of an economic campaign against the British Protectorate in order to gain advantages for himself. I therefore suggest that the Eastern Telegraph Company should be discouraged from completing their agree ment with the Imam as long as he maintains his antagonistic attitude towards British interests. It ia the Imam’s habit to say that he must defer the settlement of minor questions, such as the exchange of prisoners, release of hostages and the raising of his embargo, until after the conclusion of a treaty, and it may be of advantage to employ similar tactics on our side. 4. I understand from the Aden Manager of the Eastern Telegraph Company that there is little or no risk of the Imam being able to obtain the cable connection that he desires through any agency other than that of the Eastern Telegraph Company.
