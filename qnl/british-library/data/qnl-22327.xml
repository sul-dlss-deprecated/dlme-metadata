Sir, V/ith reforence to your despatch No. 29145/1933 of the 2 nd November 1933, concerning pearl-fishing in the Bead Sea, 1 have the honour to report that the Saudi Arab Government have granted to Sheykh Abdurrahraan ^usaibl a concession for pearl-fishing along the coasts of this kingdom. Little is known or the terms of this concession, whichwas first heard of in September of this year and of which no account has as yet been published, although it is alleged that the concession is a monopoly and moreover applies to Doth Bed Bea and Persian Gulf shores of „ gg| the *-&gt;audi Arab kingdom. 2 . iiheykh Abdurrahman Qysaibi is a member of the merchant family of that name in the Persian Gulf, whose firm is, as you are aware, well known both in urope and India as dealers in pearls. It is under stood that Ibn Gaud has now granted them this con cession for a period of fifteen years against, in all probability, a remission of some part of the lar 6 e debt which he had owed the firm for several years. The concessionaire is said to have agreed to the annua] payment of twenty per cent of the gross profit derived from the concession and to have made Ibn Baud The Principal Secretary of Btate for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade. ian advance of five hundred pounds geld to he repaid hy deduction from Hie first and if necessary subse quent payments due to the Government. 3. As a result of the concession a party of some seventeen Venezuelan and Chilean pearl divers with equipment, arrived in Jedda early in September under the leadership of a Syrian-Venezuelan named ^alim Abouhamad, stated by the French Consulate here to be a Maronite Christian belonging to a family well-known in the Lebanon, and proceeded to inspiact along the Had Gea coast of Saudi Arabia from Wejh in the north of Jlzan and the Farasan islands in the south. ’he party returned to dedda this month. 4. ^t is reported that Salim Abouhamad is favourably impressed by the commercial possibilities of exploita tion, especially in the south, northern shores having on the whole proved disappointing, but thinks it necessary to prohibit all pearl-fishing for two years in order to nurse the beds which at present contain chiefly small sized shells of litlie value. Gheykh Abdurrahman is said to ba making proposals to this effect to the *iaudi Arab Government but the king's reaction is still unknown. 5. i’he experiment so far has involved Gheykh Abdurrahman Qus&amp;ioi, on nis own admission, in financial loss and it remains to be seen whether these first efforts will be followed up. At any rate oalim Abouhamad’s contract with ^usaibi seems to be at an end with his return, and he and his party are under- stood to be preparing to leave the country. At first a return ticket to Venezuela was foreshadowed but nowit is 'believed that 3alim Ahouhamad is sufficiently impressed hy the possibilities at the southern ena of the xi.ed hea to approach the Italian authorities in hritrea with a proposal for a concession for himself there, he now intends to visit Mass&amp;wa touching on the way at hudeyda, with a view, perhaps, to explore the possibilities of securing a concession from the Imam of the femen as well. 6.

Memorandum:- —^ The following may be of interest to you. At the annual meeting of Nakhudas and leaders of t.. .j diving industry over which I presided on Tuesday m 9th February, there was a discussion about the past season and the future of the diving industry. It was agreed that the last season had been an extremely bad one from the point of view of divers and Nakhudas and only a very small proportion of boats made any pro±it, diners in the majority of the boats emd merely increased their debts to their Nakhudas. After the diving had closed however there was a sharp rise in prices of pearls in India and pearl merchants and brokers made profits, one broker told me that he made Fun6,000/— on a single deal by acting as a go-between in the sale of a lot for l fc lakhs. The poor result was due not to low prices being paid for pearls but owing to heavy rise in cost of provisioning the fleet, had Food prices been the same as last year most boats would have shewn a profit. All this is corraborated by the figures which I have now worked out. The meeting discussed the problems of the next season. I warned them that they should not assume that rice would be available for the fleet. The members begged the Government to take steps to obtain a supply of dates which should be set aside for sale to the Nakhudas at the time the diving started.2 They gave various estimates of the date consumption by divers, which I have not yet been able to check myself, but according to very rough estimates about 1,000 tons vvould be required to supply the fleet during the diving season. I shall be able to verify this by going through the accounts of some individual boats and so obtain an idea of the quantity per head. I intend to discuss with His Highness the possibility of the Government purchasing a supply of dates now to be held in reserve till Rekbah (start of diving) to be sold to Nakhudas. It was agreed that wheat could be used as a substitute for rice should this be necessary. The meeting decided to increase the diving advances slightly in view of the higher cost of living and the following advances were decided upon:- Tesqaam Salaf Khar j eeh 1361 1362 Diver Puller Diver Puller 30 25 30 25 30 25 30 25 20 15 30 20 Adviser to the Government.

BAHRAIN RECEIPT.Extract from a letter received from Major Tandy, Political Agent, Kuwait. Theres an official matter I might mention now as I should like to discuss it when you come here but haven't the time to marshall my facts and write officially before you leave. I should not be in the least surprised if some of our bright boys here do not manage to import modern diving gear before the 1847 season starts. The Shaikh told me it had been mentioned to him and that he said that there was no objection as far as he was concerned. I told him my opinion was that this was a matter affecting the whole Gulf and that if Arab pearl-fishers took to mechanical means it might be difficult to prevent others doing the same and doing it more efficiently. I am not sure that we shouldn't make a demarche on the subject before our Kuwaiti friends start unpacking their diving suits. Once they have spent the money and imported the gear the Shaikh will be most reluctant to inflict losses on them by telling them they may not use it.f- D.O.

Colonel Hay remarks that in view of the facts (a) that divers can mostly obtain other employment and (b) with the probable expansion of the Japanese cultured pearl industry the Gulf pearl may soon be unable to find a profitable market, it is perhaps no longer necessary to discourage the use of modern diving equipment by local Arabs (but not of course by foreigners).

No. Z'S*?- ' S'- Adviserate, March 9 , 194” $ Yesterday morning I discussed the subject your letter No, D I discussed the subject of 96 dated 4th March with His Highness as I was not prepared to offer my own comments on a matter of such great importance to the people of Bahrain without first ascertaining his views on the subject. I would say however that my opinion on the matter is identical to that of His Highness and the leaders of the diving industry. 2. His Highness entirely disagrees with the arguments expressed in your letter favouring the abolition of the restriction on mechanical methods of diving. He does not think that most of the men now employed in diving could find other employment in Bahrain and he would be unwilling to see his people compelled to go abroad in order to find work. The cultured pearl industry has been in active existence for about 15 years. When cultured pearls were sold for about one third less than the price of pearls there was a serious slump in the pearl trade but when the price of cultured pearls decreased until they cost only a little more than the best artificial pearls then there was less adverse effect on the pearl industry. If the cultured pearl industry expands it is possible that they will become even cheaper than they are now and will descend to the level of high grade artificial pearls. His Highness believes that there will always be a mrket for pearls 2 / ——— ConMentiai. BAHRAIN RECEIPT.3/— 2 3. Today the Bahrain divers number about 6,000 - 7,000 men and with their families and dependents some 24,000 persons are to a great extent dependent upon the diving industry. If diving with modern equipment was permitted the work could be carried out by a very few men who could scour the bed of the sea for its pearl shells. Today, and in the past, divers without apparatus are unable to gather more than a small proportion of the shells and therefore they only collect the large mature shells which are most likely to contain pearls. They leave all tte small shells and a large proportion of the others as well and this enables the oysters to breed. If divers could stay below for a long period they could, and would, clean up the banks with the probable result that the shells on the banks would become exhausted as has happened in Ceylon which was for centuries a flourishing diving area but has now ceased to produce shells. 4. After discussing the matter with me Eis Highness summoned a number of the leading Nakhudas to appear in my office this morning and, with Shaikh Daij, I ascer tained their views on the subject. The very suggestion of permission being given for the use of mechanical apparatus raised a most violent storm of protest. I enquired from the Nakhudas how they would view the intro duction of modern diving methods in other gulf states if not in Bahrain, their reply was that from time immemorial certain pearling banks were recognised as belonging to Bahrain, for the purpose of diving, these, fortunately, are the richest banks in the Gulf and if anyone attempted to use diving equipment on the Bahrain banks every diver and Nakhuda would oppose the innovationV - 3 - by all possible means. The Nakhudas left the meeting in a state of considerable excitement and much of their displeasure was directed against the Kozaibis who are known to be interested in the project of using mechanical apparatus. 5. My estimate of the value of last season’s catch is 32 lakhs of rupees which is 11$ higher than in 1364 and in 1364 the catch was about 58$ higher than in the previous year. This sum represents the money paid for the pearl catch in Bahrain. It is true that during the last selling season there has been a decrease in pearl prices in Bombay but the reason for this is not a lack of demand for pearls but the physical impossibility of dealing in pearls because owing to communal disorders, it is dangerous for Moslems to enter the Hindu districts and vice versa. From this it would appear that the pearl industry is not yet a dying one. 6 . I claim to have some knowledge of the pearl industry and I do not believe that the time has come for the introduction of mechanical methods. I am surprised that the Shaikh of Kuwait apparently approves of the idea but Kuwait’s interest in the pearl diving is small in comparison to its degree of importance in Bahrain. His Highness is of the opinion that the attitude of Bahrain in this matter would be shared by the Rulers of the Trucial Coast, but in any case Bahrain is today the centre of the trade and would be more seriously injured if anything were done to damage its oldest industry. Lt. Colonel A.C. Galloway, C.I.3., O.B.E., H. B. M’s Political Agent, Bahrain.D.O. No.C/349. POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN. The 13th of March, 1947. Dear Colonel Hay, r, S' please refer to the correspondence ending with this Agency Express Letter No.c/330, dated the 9th of March, 1947, regarding mechanical methods of diving for pearls. 2. Galloway put the statements made in paragraph 3 of your letter No.336-S, dated the 20th February, 1947, before Belgrave who talked to the Shaikh. Both he and the Shaikh - they appear to be edifyingly united in this matter - reacted very strongly. Belgrave states that M His Highness entirely disagrees with the arguments expressed in your letter'. The Shaikh apparently does not think that other employment will be locally available for the six or seven thousand men engaged in diving nor does he agree that the cultured pearl will compete with the real article; in fact, 'His Highness believes that there will always be a market for pearls'. 3. I am not happy about the position. My impression is that Belgrave and the Shaikh regard the idea of 'mechanical' diving with such horror that they will never consent even to recognize its existence by making rules to regulate it. At the same time I am doubtful whether they can resist competition from it in other States even if they remain successful in preventing its introduction on the Bahrain banks. I myself regard its introduction as desirable provided its use is regulated, but if we conclude that we cannot regulate it, then it is probably best to resist its introduction. 4. I shall be interested to hear the results of any discussion you may have had on the subject when you were in Kuwait. Yours sincerely, The Hon»ble Lt-Col. W.R.

This news has disconcerted our thought since, as it is known to Your Highness, the centre of pearl trade has, for hundreds of years, been India and that the ban imposed on the import of pearl into India is a great catastrophe to us and to all who handle this trade. Thus, since the receipt of this news, the marchants have ceased to buy and sell and the trade may completely stop. Ho one except God can predict what will be our fate and that of the orincipal trade of this country.

By order, for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. ENCLOSURE. Demi-official dated 26th November, 1947 from E.P. Donaldson, Esquire, C.M.G., to A.C.B. Symon Esquire, New Delhi. x . Confidential. BAHRAIN RECEIPT. Date. V A/ Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, London S.W.l. 26th November, 1947. My dear Symon, As you know pearls are on the list of goods whose import into India the Government of India will not at present license at all. The Sheikh of Bahrain, who has made urgent represent ations to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, says that at present Bombay is the only market where pearls can be properly processed, graded etc., and that formany classes of pearls there is no market outside India. The trade figures suggest that the great bulk of Persian Gulf pearls go to India and that formerly they were mostly retained there. The effect on the economy of the Persian Gulf of the Government of Indian embargo therefore needs no emphasis. Indian retained imports of Gulf pearls were running fairly steadily at something bet ween six and seven lakhs of rupees before the war and rose grea tly in value in 1943/44. 2. Clearly the Government of India are, on general grounds, right to ban the import of luxuries of this nature at the present time. But since,apart from our own position and inter- estwe are responsible for the interests of the Government of India in the Persian Gulf, we feel bound at least to bring the representation of the Sheikh to the notice of the Govern* ment of India and we should be glad if this could be done. We must also consider ourselves whether any remedy can be found for the situation as it affects the Gulf. 3. One of the possibilities which we have considered is diverting tPade to this country. The Board of Trade at present permit the import of pearls under a scheme whereby 80% by value are re-exported: but from enquiries made of the trade it seems that British jewellers are not at present interested, and we have not at this stage pursued the matter further. Our reason for this is that, even if it were possible to obtain some short term advantage by importing and re exporting these jtear^s from the United Kingdom, it would be bad policy to work towards such a drastic surgical operation as would be involved, when the trade has gone to Bombay in the past. The Board of Trade have also asked their men in Canada U.S.A., Portugal, Uruguay, Iraq, Syria and Persia to report on the prospects for Persian Gulf pearls in those countries. The results are not yet in. Whatever those results may be, we still feel that some attempt should be made to find the solution of the problem within the Indian orbit. We cannot pres the Indians freely to license the import of pearls (incidentally it was not only from the Gulf that India imported pearls in the past), but we wonder whether they might not be prepared to con sider doing something on the lines of the Board of Traded sch eme here - i.e. permitting the import of pearls at least to some extent, subject to re-export of a high percentage by value and trying to build up a re-export trade connection with hard currency countries. There appears to have been no such trade on any scale before the war, but the enclosed extract from the records of the former Finance Department of the Government of India which was given to the Political Resident during visit to Delhi in 1946 shows that Indian pearl trade with the U.S.A. in 1944 was not inconsiderable. If such a trade could be established and expanded it would be to the advantage of all concerned - the Gulf, the Government of India (for both Political and financial reasons) and ourselves (for the sameW? reasons)-4. In this connection you may be interested to see the attach ed extract from a Persian Gulf Intelligence Summary for the period lst-15th August, 1947* We do not know ^r. Wynan^s standard or scale, but his activities show that there is an American interest. The Government of India would probably prefer to see pearls going to market via Bombay rather than direct, for the additional reason of alleviating what must be some degree of hardship among the local merchants and craftsmen due to the embargo. 5. We should be grateful if the problem could be discussed with the Government of India, as soon as convenient, on these lines and a report sent home, with a copy to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf to whom I am sending a copy of this letter.

Bahrain recei .J/A: D £ VNOn 6th January 1948, His Highness held a meeting at the Adviserate which was attended by a number of leading pearl merchants to discuss the matter of foreign pearls being imported into Bahrain. The meeting was called because during the last few days packets of Venezuelian pearls and also pearls alleged to be from the Red Sea have been sent to Bahrain pearl merchants for disposal. There was a very lively discussion about the — grave danger to the reputation of Gulf pearls, which are and always have been recognised as the finest pearls in the world, which would occur if South American and other pearls were mixed with Gulf pearls. The meeting was strongly and unanimously in favour of preventing foreign pearls from entering Bahrain. The merchants pointed out that the pearl trade had been seriously hit by the exclusion of pearls from India and this latest danger wouM strike another blow at the industry. The meeting urged His Highness to communicate with other Rulers in the Gulf and asked him to use his good offices towards obtaining an agreement from the Rulers of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman that they would forbid the entry of foreign pearls to their States. His Highness told the meeting that he would not allow foreign pearls into Bahrain and composed telegrams to His Majesty King Ibn Saud and the Rulers of Kuwait and Oman. Regarding Qatar, His Highness informed the meeting that he hoped thatQatar of its 2 /—- 2 - own accord would take the same action as Bahrain but if Qatar did not do so he would forbid his people to do any trade in pearls with Qatar pearl merchants. He reminded the meeting that the first cultured pearl to be brought to Bahrain was brought here by a Qatar merchant, Khalil al Bakir.

Dear Mr. Harrison, I am writing to you concerning our previous correspondence on possible laternative markets for Persian Gulf pearls now that restrictiore in India do not permit their importation into that country. Our enquiries addressed to the overseas officer in the countries mentioned in my letter of 23rd September, have, up to the present elicited C' - ® following responsess- Persia . The Counsellor (Commercial) at Tehran reports that his Market Investigation Officer, who has had 25 years experience in the country informed that Persia is already a market for Gulf Pearls, although it would be difficult to estimate the importance of the trade as practically all of them are smuggled into the country. He points out that where the Persian authorities cannot prevent sugar and tea being smuggled in by the dhow-load, it is absolutely impossible for them to prevent small packages of pearls being brought in, and in his opinion it is safe to say that not 5$ of the pearls on the Persian market have ever paid duty. C anada .The trade commissioner at Winnipeg reports that there is little or no market for pearls in his area, such as are needed from time to time for replacement purposes are bought from supplies in Montreal or Toronto. The Trade Commissioner at Toronto states that there is only a small local market for natural pearls, the majority of those used being of the manufactured type. Messrs. Birks-Ellis-Byrie Ltd., of 138, Yonge Street Toronto, who are the principal jewellers in Canada, already import a few Persian Gulf pearls through their London office, Henry Birks and Sons Ltd 19, Hatton Garden, E.C.l, but they hold out no hope that Canada would afford an alternative market over and above the volume already being taken. The only firm v/ho have expressed interest in this enquiry are Jules Boas, 85, Richmond Street West, Troonto, who are well known import ers of precious stones. They do not at present handle pearls. The Trade Commissioner at Vancouver confirms this market information _and states that Mr. Frank Jackson, wholesale jeweller, 144, West Hastings Street, has expressed interest and would like to have further details. The Trade Commissioner at Vontreal has made enquiries and states that there should be a limited demand for pearls in his territoty and suggests that persons wishing to export should communicate with the London office of Messrs. Henry Birk and sons Ltd., at the address given above. It would appear that on the whole, a small scale market for pearls exists in Canada, but I should point out that, since commencing these .enquiries, the Canadian Government has placed an embargo on the import ation of jewellery and that, consequently, no business is possible at the present time. Syria &amp; Lebanon . The Commercial Secretary at Beirut has discussed the question with the President of the local Jeweller f s Association who stated that Syria was a better potential market than the Lebanon but that the following Lebanese firms were known to be interest h in the importation of pearls :- R &amp; T J&amp;mous Foued Fattal, Souk Raad-el-Hani Bouk Raad-el-Hani, Beirut, Lebanon. Beirut, Lebanon,i i v A further report from Syria is awaited* * I raq * According to a report from Baghdad the istuation in this ee# / i country is largely similar to that obtaining in Persia* P ortugal * Amemorandum from the Commercial Secretary at Lisbon is enclosed. .

There are quite consiatwble imports of pearls into Portugal, considering the size of the country* Thus the official value of imports for 1945 and 1946 was approximately Esc 700,000 and Esc* 750,000 respectively. The main supplier was the U-S.A* then Japan, India and the U*K* There is thus a possibility that the Persian Gulf pearls might find a market here. The most probable importers are:- Jose Ramos, Lda., Rua do Ouro, 280-lo, Lisbon. Martins Lda., Rua dos Fanqueiros, 390- So . Lisbon. Armando Halpern, Rua da Madalena, 182-2o. Lisbon. B Sacks, Rua do Ataide, 26, Lisbon. Jose Mota, Suer., Rua Mousinho da Bilveira, 279-lo. Oporto.

Precisely what import of pearls will be allowed in the terms of that Notice is uncertain, but the Trade Commissioner in Bombay is being asked to make enquiries in the matter and to report generally on it. 3. The Bahrein Intelligence Summary for the first half of November contained an item to the effect that Mr. Henry C. Wynant (see your para 4) had already bought pearls to the value of i 120,000 on Gulf pearls during the current season - which, by the way, we note has been a particularly poor one, the return being only half as much as usual. 4. The poorness of the season, Mr. Vl^ nan t , s operations and the partial withdrawal of the Government of Indian ban may between them solve the Sheikh 1 s problem, and it might therefore be as well not to approach the Government of Inuia at this stage. V^’e will consider the matter further w T hen we have the report from the Trade Commissioner, Bombay. '5.

Entry of Persian Gulf pearls into Pakistan and India. 3 j J Reference to previous correspondence :— This office D.O. No.400/18 dated 3rd January 1948. Coniine ntiaL 'me.O'* To His Highness Shaikh Sulman bin Hamad AXKhalifah, Ruler of Bahrain. After compliments and respects:- Your Highness is doubtless aware of the measures taken by the Indian G-overnment recently to stop the entry of pearls into that country. We had placed before Your Highness our position resulting from the enforcement of this measure.which is still in force. We thought it best to submit this petition hoping that Your Highness may be pleased to give it Your Highness’s gracious care and interest. This measure has adversely affected the entire pearling industry of the Persian Gulf and in particular the industry of the Arab Amirates. We beg to bring to Your Highness’s notice that we consider that we should consult His Majesty King Ibn Saud and Their Excellencies the Rulers of the Arab States in the Persian Gulf and decide on a common plan to communicate with the two Governments of India and Pakistan and to submit to them first about those tens of thousand people who depend on diving alone and nothing else for their livelihood, and the many other people who have been trading in this commodity since years and know no other trade. At the same time in India itself there are many people who work on these pearls and obtain their living from this industry. They are the drillers of these pearls and those who work them and polish them and then the jewellers who set them in jewellery. Secondly India doubtless benefits from this trade because the Indian traders after working on the pearls export them to Europe, America and the Eastern countries; these pearls 2 /2 sometimes are even brought back again into Behrain. India therefore benefits from this trade more than us because a major portion of the profits go to Indian merchants. Thirdly, although pearls are considered as a luxury the import of pearls into India from the Gulf is nothing compared to the imports of luxury articles as well as essential articles from India to the Gulf States. c Fourthly the quantity of pearls whw enter India during recent years is much less compared to what used to be imported into India in the past because of the very small production of the pearling banks. Fifthly, pearls have been free from any restriction in India since many many years. We consider that Your Highness should discuss this matter with Hobble The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and we feel confident that he will help us in this vital matter. Y/e beseech Your Highness to accept our respects and thanks. May God preserve you. Pearl merchants of Bahrain. Dated 16th Safer 1367.1 it® CONFIDENTIAL * POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN.

It has been decided to send these pearls for examination to Bombay where they have a suitable apparatus for testing them. Owing to the embargo on the import of pearls into India it is necessary to obtain the previous sanction of the Government of India for the entry of these pearls into Bombay.

A reply has now been received from the Counsellor (Commercial) at Washington in response to the enquiry in respect of market possibilities in the United States of America. The reply, which is enclosed, consists of the following documents (1) A statement showing the value of natural and cultured pearls imported into the U.S.A. in 1946 from the different supplying countries; (il) A memorandum prepared by the Consulate General at New York together with a list of the principal imnorters of natural pearls in that city and a statement of the pearl trade by one of the leading New York merchants, and (ill) a memorandum prepared by the Consulate General at San Francisco. In a covering letter the Counsellor (Commercial) makes the following remarks It seems clear that practically the whole of pearl buying for the United States of America is concentrated in New York and that the rer-uirmment s for other parts of the country are drawn from merchants in New York. You will see from New York’s memorandum that the firms which still engage in the natural pearl business and are interested in Persian Gulf pearls are having difficulty in connection with the drilling and bleaching of pearls since the suspension of imports in I^di Arrivals of both natural pearls and cultured! pearls have progressively increased since the conclusion of hostili ties.* It may be of interest to record that the United States Commercial Company rece tly imported 13,767 strands of cultured pearls from Japan and sold them by auction for a total of £379,511. The consignment was sold in 34 cases on an r, as is” basis and as the auction was conducted by sealed bids, a reliable average value is difficult to establish; one case containing 471 strands sold for £35,000 whereas two others with 454 strands and 420 strands respectively fetched £ll,000 and 12,600. The sale of natural pearls in this market might be assisted by the reduction in Customs duty from 10 to 5 per cent ad Valorem, which is to come into effect on January 1st, 1948. The extent to which this reduction may effect sales is probably limited, however, in view of the comparative price of natural pearls. It is hoped that the information furnished will be of use to you. You will of course treat certain remarks with the necessary reservations. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) A. Howard. F.A.K. Harrison, Es^- ., Commonwealth Relations Office, Whitehall, S.W.lMEMORANDUM To The Commercial Secretariat, British Embassy, Washington. From New York Consulate-General Subject The Market for Natural Pearls from the Persian Gulf in the U.S.A. 1. Imports of natural pearls into the United States are made by a very few firms who operate independently except on excep- tional occasions when a financial risk is too great. Although shrewd and keen competitors they have a great respect for each other, and joint ventures are not difficult accomplishment. 2. A list of four of the principal importers of natural pearls is attached as Appendix 1. Two other names are excluded from this list since they wished to make specific suggestions before their names were submitted as potential buyers. Their names will be forwarded together with their comments when these come to hand, but since both parties are out of New York it is not likely that these will be received before next year. 3. Notable personalities of past years in natural pearls, such as Leonard Rosenthal and others, are now dealing entirely in cultured pearls. 4. It appears that all the natural peal traders have in the past, been completely dependent on the Indian pearls industry for drilling the pearls. The Indians also accomplished the art of bleachign with chemicals, and the aid of sunlight to improve the lustre w&gt;ich, was originated by the Persian Gulf natives. 5. It is believed in the trade that pearls are still finding their way into India despite regulations prohibiting imports. The U.S. firms who are interested in Persian Gulf pearls are in a dilemma regarding the drilling in particular and the bleaching of pearls if the pearls cannot enter India* 6. These firms and other interested parties sent a mission to the Persian Gulf last June to investigate the situation. The mission was undertaken by Dr. A.E. Alexander of the Gem Laboratory Inc. and Mr. Charles Murray, of 636 Fifth Avenue, who discovered the native ruler of Bahrein wanted li million dollars before he would entertain suggestions. They accomplished little, but their experience did not entirely discourage would-be importers and merchants who are still willing to buy from the Persian Gulf. 7* It is considered that developing a market for the larger sizes reruired unique skill, particularly to overcome the publicity given at the present time to the cultured pearl. The United States firms interested in the Persian Gulf pearls are ready to use their best endeavours to create a demand for all sizes of natural pearls, if they can overcome the difficulties outlined above. 8. A report on the Pearl Market submitted by Mr. Rene Block of 61C Fifth Avenue is attached as Appendix II to this memorandum. Mr. Block is acknowledged in the trade as being •auite a fighter for the natural pearl”.

December, 1947■ APPENDIX II Confidential October 1944 THE PEARL MARKET Financial Aspect The international pearl market has up to now remained in the state of depression into which it had been thrown by the crisis of 1929. Without examining in detail all the elements which deter mined this state of affairs, it can be said that the competition of Japanese cultured pearls - pearls made of a foreign substance, a mass of mother-ofpearl of no value covered with a thin coat of pearly material - has not been counteracted in a suitable manner. The public was not warned against this Japanese trash » Introduced under the equivocation of the word ’cultured* - and was allowed to believe that cultured pearls are similar to natural pearls which is false. Also no effort has been made, no initiative undertaken, no group formed to fight with adequate means the disfavour into which the natural pearl had unjusti fiably fallen. In fact the price of pearls had fallen to a level represent ing less than 10# of that which obtained in 1928-1929. Prices have risen noticeably since last year and have reached now, according to cuality, 16 to 20# of the old prices. Many reasons militate in favor of a rapid and lasting acceleration of this rise. First are the general reasons for the increase in prices of merchandise, because of the automatic process of the monetary depreciation. Then are the special reasons for the increase in price of the fine v pearl : !• Increase in price at the source. In Bombay pearls of certain sizes and qualities have almost tripled in price in the last two years. Even at these prices it is practically impossible to obtain them. Ill efforts made by certain New York merchants to buy pearls In Bombay have remained more of less unsuccessful. It must be remembered that Bombay is the most important commercial market for oriental pearls found in the Persian Gulf, particularly for most of the production of the Island of Bahrein. At Bahrein the production of the fisheries decreases from year to year. The number of divers which, twenty years ago, was about 60,000 is now under 6,000. Powerful oil refineries which have been built in recent years at Bahrein after the discovery of oil in that area, pay higher wages than the fisheries, especially as the fisheries work only about four months a year. However, as divers share in the profits of the boats for which they work, higher market prices would undoubtedly assure a continuation of supply. The markets of France and Great Britain were supplied almost exclusively by Bombay and the United States obtained its pearls from these two countries. The Importation of pearls into the United States reached a yearly average of JtXSE #10 millions during the period from 1920 to 1930. This importation deminished progressively to #200,000 in 1942 and to practically nothing in 1943. 2. Healthy situation of the pearl market in the United State The stocks are really insignificant in value in relation to the buying power of the country. They are in the hands of a few powerful New York retail houses and several wealthy dealers. The middle and small retailers have practically nothing. Thus the market is healthy. In view of the assets of pearl merchandise, there is no corresponding liability. IAppendix II (ContM) 3. Sincerity of price observed on fine pearls. The prices result from the free play of the law of supply and demand. This is not the case with all other gems, particularly with the diamond, in which powerful English financial organizations are limiting production, regulating the distribution and consequently fixing the prices arbitra rily, a procedure which is a real danger. The purchase of fine pearls offers more security as an investment than the purchase of diamonds. 4. Gradual disappearance of Japanese pearls, called 1 cultured* from the market. Their prices have gene up more than tem times in the last two years and will continue to rise. The prohibition against importing them will probably last long after the war. In short, it has been seen, all the technical reasons ire in favour of an increase in the price of pearls. The consupp- tion has a tendency to increase because of a need to use up surplus money. Favourable publicity would easily encourage an important acceleration of the movement. A cursory examination of the ruestion will show that the impetus is easy to give and the publicity is easy to make. Commercial Aspect Tn the present situation where the use of precious metals is regelated if not practically forbidden to the Jeweller and where skilled labout has pretentions which render the manufacture of mounted jewels very difficult and burdensome, it is of in estimable advantage to be able to utilise pearls which are sufficient in themselves. A pearl necklace is a thing of beauty in itself. It has no need of a mounting or setting of any kind. It can readily be enlarged or modified which is of advantage to the jeweller. And finally, publicity for the pearl is easy and of infinite variety. Pearls have been known since the earliest days. In India they have been considered sacred; the Hindus venerate them as attributes of divinity. Women feel that they are protected by pearls from an evil fate. Mythology dedidates the pearl to Venus. The pari has at all times been the preferred gem of the great people of the world from the Pharaoh^, the Chinese Empercre, the Rajahs, to the Greeks and Romans. It has remained so with modern rulers. The Queen of England, members of royal families and all the great ladies of English and American society are never without their neck laces which they wear in one, two or even triple strands. It is supreme In jewelry and without her pearls a woman of quality is never completely dressed. It is the only jewel which can be worn as well during the day or night, on a dress, a blouse or on the satin of the skin.. Contrary to other jewelry whichoften does not complement certain costumes or gives the appearance of a display of riches in bad taste, the pearl necklace, a pearl at the lobe of the ear or on the finger, always adds to the natural distinction of those who wear them..A woman who has a pearl necklace of natural, fine pearls is proud of it. She never feels completely dressed, nor completely at her esthetic best without her necklace of pearls. A woman is never perfectly beautiful without it.MEMORANDUM REGARDING THE MARKET POSSIBILITIES OF N ATURAL P EARLS Several of the largest jewellery houses in this area have been contacted regarding the market possibilities of natural pearls. They inform us that cultured pearls have nearly supplanted the use of natural pearls in this market.

The principal reason is the lack of interest amongst the operators of jewellery stores in promoting the sale of natural pearls, their reluctance in learning to distinguish between natuzt l and c^ilturnl peu rlo* and in failing to pess any information on to the consuming public. The average clcsaler In the TJ.S. does not t prociate the beauty or quality of a fine natural pe; rl, end usually ;rofers to sell cultured perrls or even simulated jx^rls* econdly, the presents luxury tax on jev;eller 3 , items together with the high rate of taxation on the ineome of the middle and upper bracket rroupe coml)ine to prevent any rzceet increase in the ©ele ©f natural pearls ea it is amongst the middle and upper clrse bracket inccme grcu}» that ttie greatest market for pearls exist. Thirdly, the reluctance of the dealers to advertise extensively the natural pearl* Tho great amount - of publicity given to the cultured pearl has tended to dircour? e dealers in naturr1 pearls from *&lt; vertising. k. Fourthly, the uncertainty of the supply of natural pearls st the present time. There ic sane doubt Tffcother pearls will be available since the import control announced by the Government of India. There is also considerable concern as to whether arrangements can be made- for drilling the pearls. It is understood that some drillers have been m transf cured/Hr trfinsfen*od from Bombay to the Bahrein Islands in an attempt to establish the pearl drilling Industry exem pt the flslier- aien in the Islands, but it is not known hem i iccoosful tills will turn out to be# trilling has been ette- [&gt;ted in the tJ#S# Juerrons sod / ndersen Company «t one . 7 e. consifiertble quantity of pearls to be drilled in this country.
