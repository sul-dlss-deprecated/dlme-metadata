The principle correspondents in the file are the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, and the Political Agent in Bahrain during 1945, Cornelius James Pelly.Belgrave’s original proposal for the Bahrain Government to sell or lease the land in question (marked as plot C on Belgrave’s hand-drawn map, folio 3) was met favourably by the British Government. Plans for the acquisition proceeded, until it became clear that Shaikh Salmān bin Ḥamad Āl Khalīfah did not want to sell or lease the land (folio 7), causing some confusion before Shaikh Salmān eventually opted to make a gift the land to the RAF A map of the area, showing RAF property, land leased for civil aviation purposes, and the new plot of land gifted to the RAF by Shaikh Salmān, is on folio 17. Five years after the transfer, officials at Air Headquarters requested copies of the title deeds of the land from the Political Agent. Their request is enclosed in the file, accompanied by a map of Muharraq (folio 15) showing the plots of land owned by the RAF and civilian air authorities. A key to the map (folio 13) is also included.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>RAF Muharraq, British airbase</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003e5#share">Non-commercial use only</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003e5#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
