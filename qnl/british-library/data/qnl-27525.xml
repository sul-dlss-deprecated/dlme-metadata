No reply has yet been received tony signal to Political Resident requesting confirmation of the alleged incident concerning a Persian man of war and a Kuwait Dhow off Henjam. It would appear that these incidents are likely to become more frequent. There is no doubt that an enormous amount of smuggling does take place between the Arabian and Persian Coasts. The raison d*etre of the new Persian Navy is to attempt to stop it. I have heard on good authority that the majority of the smuggling is carried out by Persians in Persian Dhows who go over to the Arabian Coast, load up their Dhows, and smuggle the goods into Persia. Confirmation of these incidents is difficult, especially as to the locality (i.e. whether in Persian territorial waters or not) • * * * * * * Extract enclosure No.4 in East Indies Letter No.578/E.I.156 of 22nd August,1933. e i KUWAIT. 17.

(No. 497.) / ^ Sir, Tehran, October 27, 1933. / 5 7 ' WITH reference to my telegram No. 276 of the 22nd October, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of a note that I have received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of the search and detention of the Koweiti dhow Fath-ul-Khair, near Henjam, on the 10th April. 2 . I cannot discover any discrepancies in the accounts of this incident given to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, except that the sum of 300 rupees given as the amount of the damages in my first note (see my despatch No. 232 of the 19th May) was increased to 400 rupees in my second note (see my despatch £ No. 382.Qf the 29th July), an increase which can easily be explained on the ground that - the later information revealed more extensive damages. The sum of 400 rupees was stated in my second note to be due in respect of the first collision; no sum was mentioned in respect of the second collision. 3. The use of the term “near Henjam ’’ conveniently ignores the fact that the dhow was 4 miles from the coast when first hailed by the Babr. This is of course within the limits claimed by the Persian Government as territorial waters, but they do not base any part of their case upon this fact. 4. The point about the absence of a flag and ship’s papers is perhaps worth attention. It seems to me that our position would be strengthened in these cases if all dhows were made to fly the flag of the ruler of the port to which they belong and to carry a certificate proving their nationality. 5. I suggest that I should reply to this note that His Majesty’s Government do not admit the right of Persian vessels to search Eritish or British-protected dhows on the high seas, and deal with the question of the discrepancies on the lines that I have indicated. I should add that the Persian note contains nothing to refute the charges of bad seamanship and inhumanity brought against the commander of the Babr, although it is possible that he may have tried to make amends for his earlier conduct by treating the captain and crew kindly when once they were at Bander Abbas. The reply would have to add that the question of representations on behalf of Arab rulers had been, or would be, treated separately. 6 . 1 shall deal in a separate despatch with the last two paragraphs of the Minister for Foreign Affairs' note. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire (No. 180). I have, &amp;c. V. A. L. MALLET. Enclosure in No. 1. Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty's Charge d Affaires. (Translation.) M. le Charge d’Affaires, YOUR esteemed note of the 7th Murdad (29th July, 1933), addressed to his Highness Feroughi, concerning the explanation of the complaint of the captain of the Fath-ul-Khair, was duly received. 2. As you will have seen, certain points of contradiction and discrepancies are to be observed in the statements and complaints made by the captain of the dhow, such as that in one place he ascribes the losses incurred to the first collision of the ship with the Babr. and in another place to the second collision which [971 x—10] 'i e2 occurred after the breaking of the rope. Similarly, he has on one occasion placed the amount of the losses at 300 rupees, and on another occasion at 400 rupees. In addition, although he admits that the ship Babr had ordered him to stop near Henjam, yet he complains of the actions of the said ship on the high seas. 3. Nevertheless, the matter was referred to the quarters concerned and enquiries were made as to the facts of the case. The telegram received from the south has confirmed the facts which have been brought to your notice in the note of the 14th Tir (5th July, 1933), and in especial the Imperial navy has declared plainly that no sort of damage has been caused to the dhow, and even that when the captain of the dhow was being released he expressed his utmost satisfaction at the kindness shown to himself and to his men. 4. In short, the dhow Fath-ul-Khair, when near Henjam, was suspected by the ship Babr of transporting smuggled goods, and as on account of bad weather the inspection of the cargo and the examination of the documents of the ship was made impossible at that place, the dhow was, in the company and under the guidance of some sailors of the Babr, piloted to Bandar Abbas, where the local customs examined its cargo. 5 . From the telegram received I gather that the dhow Fath-ul-Khair was not in possession of ships’ papers, and had no British flag, although one cannot accept the waybills and flags of such dhows at their face value. 6 . As regards the damages incurred, as the matter has been totally denied by the Imperial navy, I presume that the captain of the dhow meant the damages incurred as a result of the breaking of the mast following the storm at sea prior to his meeting with the ship Babr. 7. While furnishing the afore-mentioned facts I find myself compelled to draw your attention to the discussion I had with you on Sunday last, the 24th Mehr (the 15th October, 1933), relating to the fact that the correspondence and discussions of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Imperial Government with His Britannic Majesty’s Legation in respect of matters relating to the sheikhs inhabiting the Persian Gulf have had a purely private character and it should not, therefore, be supposed that the Persian naval authorities in the Gulf have committed any irregular act or permitted injustice or oppression (to be caused) to any person. Otherwise, the views of the Imperial Government are the same as those set forth in the note of the 29th Shahrivar, 1307 (30th September, 1928), from his Excellency Pakrevan to His Britannic Majesty’s Legation. 8 . In the circumstances it is, therefore, natural that the Imperial Govern ment cannot admit any sort of official intervention on the part of His Britannic Maiesty’s Government in matters relating to the sheikhs inhabiting the Persian Gulf.

Both letter and statement speak for themselves. 3. I would ask, if you see no objection to such course that strong protest be made to the Central Persian Governioent at Tehra with a view to curbing the stupid and irresponsible activities of their gunboat commanders. 4. As His Excellency the Shaikh rightly remarks, if such treatment is to be meted out to every dhow master, who happens to be anywhere near the Persian side of the Gulf, much hardship and general lack of confidence in the power of the British ITavy to protect the Gulf trade routes as used by Arab sailing craft, will re sul t. 5. Prom separate enquiries which I have taken pains to make, it seems certain that the Dhow was seized on the high seas and not anywhere near Persian territorial waters. 6. But even if the occurrence did take place within the 3 mile limit, there i s no reason why the master of the Dhow should have not been treated with all due courtesy.7.

I am sending herewith a statement made by one Salim bin ilubarak by name, a Kuwait subject and Uakhuda.of Bum ’'P&amp;th ul Khair M Ho•10, in order to let you know how great was the trouble he had been caused by the Persian war-ship M Babr M , which met him near Hen jam, when, owing to a strong Shamal wind, he was trying to make for that harbour to rrend his sails. You will come to know the complete story from the statement made by the abovementioned nakhuda. This treatment is very high handed, indeed, and it will cause a great deal of trouble and distress to the ship owners in the Gulf, Pur the r I am afraid that similar occurrences are likely to happen again and 1, therefore, beg to draw your attention to this incident and to request that it may kindly beTranslation of a statement made by Salim bin Mubarak Makhuda oi 3um M Fatii ul i.hair' ifo*lO, 'which belongs to Kuwait* I, Salim bin Mubarak, rTakhuda of Bum 'Fath ul Khair' sailed in my ooat, with a load of fish oil from the i r ahra ports (Ports of Hadhramout), and while trying to make the harbour of Henjam, where I wanted to mend my sails, I wa s me t by the Persian warship w Babr M , which stood in my way and ordered me to cast enchor* I told them that I was going to Henjam, and that it was very dangerous for me to cast anchor just where I was, but they insisted on my doing so, and the more I tried to persuade them the more they insisted. So I had no choice but to cast anchor where they wished. n/hen I cast anchor the Captain asked me what was my cargo, and from where was it shipped. I replied him that my cargo was fish oil, and that it was shipped from the Mahra ports, where no Customs authorities had existed to get a manifest from them. He also asked me whither was my destination, and I replied him that my destination was Dubai and Bahrain. Afterwards he ordered me to get ready to proceed in my boat to Bandar *-vbbas, but I said that the boat must remain at henjam, and that I, alone, was. prepared to go with him in the warship to any place he desired, but that he should undertake to pay such expenses, as might be incurred for food etc. He then said, 0 1 shall a gk from Mohammerah whether they agree to the boat remaining at Henjam, otherwise I shal] have to tow it to Bandar Abbas”. And after 3 hours he received a reply from Mohammerah to the effect that the boat should proceed to Bandar Abbas. Therefore, I told the Captain that the-V the boat could only proceed if he would accept responsibility for any dar^age that might happen to the boat or cargo. The Cap tarn refused to do this. He then took my Dhow in tow, but after a short distance the rope broke. The warship then turned and ran against the bo&amp; t causing damage to a great part of its bow; Again she tried to tow the Dhow but again the rope broke. I, thereupon, asked the Captain to send some of his crew on board my Dhow and allow it to return to Henjam, but he again would not agree to this. Eventually he took me with him on board the warship-leaving my boat with five of his crew on board with orders to proceed with it to Bandar Abbas. We reached Bandar Abbas in the ship, and the Captain sent a motor boat to assist to bring in the Bum and the crew. They arrived after 8 hours. Then I wa s called before the Director of Customs who began to question me, and to him I replied just as stated above. He also asked whether I discharged any of my cargo in Persian Ports, and I replied him that I was going to Dubai and Bahrain that I had no orders from the owners of cargo to call at any other ports besides those two, and that I had endeavoured to make Henjam merely to xk mend my sails. At last after a great deal of argument, and after very many requests he allowed us to leave and to call at Henjam to get our sails repaired. We left at once.jms/Mj (59 groups) £591 DEC From (CCPIi&amp;i OIBGULATi*^)). X P H E H 0 F T E L F fl H A M The Political Resident in t'le Persian Guli* to Secretary State for India.
