(Ah &lt;Xrry\AJUO&lt;-'^y~ Oj Copy No. T ^ pr&gt;-rJb-&lt;Xsvr) OicQeyf TefLr\ t Sir R. Bullard to Mr. Eden.—(Received 2\st March.) (No. 111.) Sir, Tehran, \Qth March, 1944. AS I had the honour to inform you in my telegram No. 229. dated th e 9th March , I presented to His Imperial Majesty the Shah on that date the credentials appointing me His Majesty’s Ambassador at this post. The ceremonial on our side was unusual in that several of the fourteen members of the staff whom I took with me had no uniforms, either because they had lost their property by bombing or because they had come to Tehran by air and could not bring uniforms; they wore evening dress, and thereby imparted a slightly inter national colour to our general appearance. His Majesty’s Ambassador was himself rather below the standard for such an occasion, having a uniform without gold lace on the chest, the Scotch friend in London charged with the conversion of the coat from consul-general’s to Minister’s having convinced even Messrs. Moss Brothers that gold braid on the chest is not de rigueur for a Minister of (I think) the third class. The Persian Court officials made up, however, for any drabness in our appearance by wearing gold braid wherever it could be sewn on—breastplates, backpieces, stomachers and all; to such an extent that I could not deprecate the comment of the additional military attache, Colonel Pybus, who quoted from Bishop Blougram’s Apology :— “ . . . . his back brave with the needlework of Noodledom.” \ J * C. o. i \ 2. The ceremony took place at the Gulistan Palace, whither we were conducted by the head of the Protocol Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. I was eventually shown into an inner room; my own staff was left behind, but I found His Imperial Majesty the Shah backed by a line of Court officials. It had been agreed that there should be no speeches, but, after I had made a formal statement about my new appointment and presented the letters, the Shah made a speech of welcome, which could not be left without reply. To this the Shah, seeming to be too nervous to stop, retorted in words which again could not be left in the air. I began to feel as one does in greeting an Iraqi, where one has at least eleven ways of saying good morning and each is met by a crisp reply. In the end the Shah put an end to the exchange of compliments by desperately shaking my hand. One remark of mine was not an empty compliment: I could say with sincerity that, having been here through so many bad days, I was very happy to remain with the hope that better times would come. On the other hand, the Shah was certainly sincere in expressing deep gratifica- i tion at the raising of the status of His Majesty’s representative at the Court of • Tehran. 3. I now presented to His Majesty the members of the staff, several of whom were already known to him. He then put into execution a procedure recently devised to distinguish between ambassadors and ministers at the presentation of credentials, whereby ambassadors are to have a private interview with the Shah, which is not to be granted to ministers. This enabled the embassy staff to enjoy tea and conversation for three-quarters of an hour while I had a rather incon clusive talk with the Shah and the Minister for Foreign Affairs which might have gone on for twice as long if, warned by experience, I had not picked up my gloves one by one and finally laid my hand on my hat. His Majesty began by referring to my approaching visit to the United Kingdom, and I said that I hoped that he and his ministers would raise before I left any questions which they would like me to discuss in London. At this the Minister for Foreign Affairs grinned, remembering, I think, the desiderata of the Persian Government as conveyed to the Foreign Office by M. Hajir in a memorandum which I had described as the same length as the Shah Reza Avenue, a thoroughfare several ■, miles in length. The Minister for Foreign Affairs talked a great deal about the difficulty of dealing with the Russians, who blamed the Persians if there was insecurity in the Russian area, and yet haggled for months about posting [51—58]another hundred soldiers there or sending in a few more rifles and rounds of ammunition. The effect of this discourse was to show (what is perfectly true) that the British behave towards the Persians with greater consideration than the Russians. I spoke of our hope that the war would not last very much longer; that the retirement of the foreign troops would relieve the Persian Government of many problems, particularly a psychological problem of great importance; and that the assumption of entire responsibility for security by the Persians would be effected smoothly and effectively. 4. At one point the Shah said that Persians—army officers included—were still inclined to run either to the British or the Russians, while the British and j the Russians would say that one officer was this and another that. This, he said, ■was bad. I agreed that to try to play one ally off against another was ] undesirable as well as useless, but said that we were not to be blamed if in the interests of Persia we preferred honest Persians to corrupt ones. I was thinking of the chief of the Shah’s military cabinet, whom no one believes to be honest, and the Shah was probably thinking of him too. 5. The Shah' said that he thought that the British ought to have a more constructive policy. I recited some of the items in our programme for Persia help in feeding the country and in making the most of its transport and other resources, support for the American advisers, and so on, and asked whether His Majesty could mention anything more constructive that we could do. His Majesty could not, and I do not know what he was thinking of. 6. When speaking of possible ways of absorbing the skilled Persian labour which will be set free when Persia ceases to be a road to Russia, the Shah said j that some might be employed in the Persian navy, £ ‘ if we have a navy.” This ! was said with genuine and unconscious sadness. I have reported before how : deeply the Persians feel the almost total loss of their infant navy at our hands, ! partly by destruction during the invasion of August 1941, and partly by I requisitioning. 7. At my suggestion, a signed portrait of His Majesty King George was sent out for the Shah after the Tehran Conference. Unfortunately, the glass was broken in transit, and, although I was able to replace the glass, it was not possible to repair properly the slight damage done to the frame and the portrait by the splinters. I had informed the Minister of Court beforehand that 1 hoped the frame, and if possible the portrait, would be replaced, and had asked whether the Shah would perhaps like to receive the portrait unframed. This proposal had been accepted, and I therefore handed the portrait to His Majesty, who expressed great gratification at the gift and remarked on the excellence of the portrait as a likeness. 8. The Shah was wearing two Persian decorations, but not the G.C.B. // 9. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. 1 R. W.

Owing to complication which this decision creates in our relations with certain Central and South American countries, we have asked United States Government to postpone public announcement for a short time. We have also requested them to arrange that their announcement, when made, shall be simultaneous with ours. Meanwhile* both United States Minister and His Majesty’s Minister have informed Shah and Persian Government in confidence of proposal, which Persians undertook to keep secret. Soviet Ambassador at Tehran has, hov/ever, learned, probably from A Persian source, of what is intended and recently asked His Majesty’s Minister to confirm his in formation. His Majesty’s Minister did so but added that matter was at present confidential and that His Majesty's Government . were considering manner and time of notifying Soviet Government, 2. In order to avoid any unnecessary danger of leakage, we had not proposed to inform Soviet Government until very shortly before public announcement was made. In view of the foregoing, however* we think it would be better to inform Soviet Government at onee*. Unless you aec objection, I shall be grateful if you will now do so and request them to treat the matter as confidential pending public announcement. 3# We doubt if it is necessary to give Soviet Government any reason for our decision. But if you think it desirable to do so you may say tba ^ Persian Government have expressed them selves in favour of the change and, now that Persia has assumed the statosrf a co-belld gerent, we have decided, in view of the fact that so many countries already maintain Embassies at Tehran, to comply with their views 5 [Copies sent to Mr. Smyth U O.T.P# I E I * I INDIA OFFICE 1 Z Ay St*/' , yindexEEt indexe LCYPHER] ^ 'v^Tt -; f ■ • ^ A /£/• ^ s &gt; Pi^H C^&gt; ■ • J ...
