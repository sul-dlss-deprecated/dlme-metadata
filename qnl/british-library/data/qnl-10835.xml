The colophon (f. 87v) has been deliberatedly erased, and next to it a more recent hand has written '‘Alī the scribe completed its writing on 10 Sha‘bān 1320 (تم في تأريخ عشر شهر شعبان المعظم سنة ألف وعشرين وثلاثمائة تحريره [؟] علي الكاتب)'. This date, however, is problematic since the manuscript appears to have been copied in the 17th century, while 10 Sha‘bān 1320 (= 12 November 1902) is clearly far too late to be correct. It is possible that the last line of this note was added later, and the intended date should be 10 Sha‘bān 1320 (= 18 October 1611), and this is the date written by a much later (probably ninteenth-century) hand on front paper iii. Cureton (
                           Catalogus codicum manuscriptorum orientalium qui in Museo Britannico asservantur, 1846-71, p. 620) suggests that perhaps the Calendar of the Martyrs, used by the Copts of Egypt, may be intended here for the year, but its use for the year alongside the Islamic (as opposed to the Coptic) month is odd. If the Calendar of the Martyrs were, indeed, the intended era, the date would correspond to 10 Sha‘bān 1012 (= 13 January 1604). In any event, the date offered by this note need not be taken as the actual date the manuscript was completed, since the manuscript's original colophon has been erased and replaced with this note of dubious authority.Contents:1) Hero of Alexandria (إيرن),
