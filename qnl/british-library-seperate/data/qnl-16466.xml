                           Euphrates, for conveyance to the Presidency. Kemball recommends to Robinson's care two additional slaves, who are being held at Kemball's disposal by the Chief of Lingah. Kemball encloses a letter (not included), which should be given to the Chief of Lingah by whomever Robinson sends to collect the slaves in question, so that they may also be delivered to the Naval Depot and eventually taken to Bombay.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673709.0x000007#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
