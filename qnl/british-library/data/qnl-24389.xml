In reality ; will sustain heavy losses by this valuation but until the expiryRegarding the assessment of the value of the properties of two Persians over which a dispute arose between the owners* assessors and the assessors appointed by the Bahrain Government. It is very difficult to follow any set method of valua tion adopted in India or other civilised countries where the Land Acquisition Law has been fully developed. There are quarters both in Manamah and Muharraq where lands and buildings demand higher prices than those in other quarters not so cen trally situated. For instance, properties situated to the south of the Agency, i.e. in the Ewazis* quarters, obtain more value than those in the west. But the towns have not been divided into areas where an approximataffixed value can be attached to property situated there. Nor is the price paid for a property at the time of its last purchase by the owner a standard of its valuation as a great majority of houses and other properties have been taken by creditors from their debtors for ridiculously high prices as the only way of satis fying their claims - , and one of the houses under consideration (the house in Muharraq) was actually taken in lieu of a debt for an incredibly high sum of Ps. 1500/- which is far in excess of the real value of the house. The method of valuation adopt ed by the Public Works Department in India -namely, assessing the value of the land according to its site and the value of the material at the rate of Rs. 4/-^ per square foot and deduct ing Re. 1/- per square foot on account of depreciation - does not s eem to c onform to the conditions in Bahrain as neither the value of the land per square foot is fixed for any particular quarters nor does the material used in local buildings yield to assessment according to Indian standards. A reconciliation ot the values fixed by the ov/ners* and the Bahrain Government’s assessors^ — adoption of a happy medium does not appear to be a proper solution either as one of the owners* assessors fa when asked by a friend the reason for^/putting unnecessarily high values to the properties of his client stated that his only object was that the third assessor would most likely fix the/-- 2 - the value betv;een the first two assessments, 2, Taking all these difficulties into consideration and having no other alternative to fall back upon, I have based my assessment of the values, particularly of the houses£rnen- tioned in Land Department letter No. 318/29 LD dated the 14th June 1938 (belonging to Abdullah bin Ibrahim Baluki) on the amount of rent yielded by a particular house. According to my estimates and^what I enquired from uninterested landlords, even a most up-to-date house built with first class material and equipped tolerably with modern conveniences should pay its //^ value back within^l2 years from the rent realised for it. If the same standard is adopted for the two houses in dispute which^far from being modern or built of first class material, are either in a dilapidated condition like the one situated in Muharraq, or are situated in the heart of prostitute area where no decent man would like to buy a house as is the case // with the house situated in Manamah . If the standard of^/12 years 1 rent is adopted, the owneis of the properties would be placed in a very advantageous position and no injustice can be feared by them. I have therefore followed this principle in valuating the houses. 3. The house in Nanamah was bought by the owner in 1935 for Rs. 1800/- and was repaired by him later. It fetches a rent of Rs. 14/- p.m., although the owner*s representative states that it was as a special favour to the tenant that the rent was so low and that the actual rent of the house is much higher. But his statement bears no value^' taking into c onsideration the location and the style of the house I have definitely come to the conclusion that its rent can never be more t han Rs. 14Ay- a house with three dark, narrow^ unventi lated rooms dov/nstairs and one room upstairs sur rounded by thatched huts (barastis).situated in most objectional quarter and also occupied by not a very respectable man. At the rate of Rs. 14/- p.m. the yearly rent would be Rs. 168/- // and the rent for iS*years Rs. 1848/-. This is the value- /•N -3- which the owner would be av/fully lucky to get if he were t o sell his house on his own, and I therefore assess this house for that amount as against Rs. 2200/- assessed by the owners assessor and Rs. 1800/- by the Bahrain Governments assessor. 4. The house in Muharraq is a small dungeon-looking abode with two suffocating rooms and has been divided into two, the second portion being only a barasti W.C. and no room. It n was bought by the owner in 1935 in lieu of a debt for Rs. 1500/- It has been unoccupied and unrented for a number of years and li not likely to yield a rent of more than Rs. 4/8 per mensem if it is at all rented. At the rate of Rs. 4/8 p.m. the rent for one year would be Rs. 54/- and for 12 years Rs. 648/-. In my estimate the house including both the portions is not v. orth more. 5. In regard to the properties mentioned in Land Depart ment letter No. 395/25 LD/1357 dated the 6th July 1938 - namely 3 unreclaimed pieces of land in the sea belonging to Llulla Ibrahim bin Muhammad Ewazi - their values cannot be assessed on the principle of yearly rent. Nor are there any^/in the Land Department shov/ing whether and for what nrice similar pieces of land, if any, were bought or sold. The pieces are still unreclaimed and it needs the sinking of colossal sums of money before the three pieces respectively 9, 8 and 5 feet deep and 200x200, 200x100 and 150x150 dharas in area can be filled and reclaimed for building or any other purposes. These pihces were bought by the owner from the then Ruler of Bahrain Shaikh 'Isa for ; s. 3500/-, 's. 2500/-, and Rs. 2^00/-, res pectively in the year 1923 when the pearl irade was improving every year and there were signs of all round prosperity. The financial condition of the Island has improved since the last 4 or 5 years owing to oil d evelopments and the value of pro- perties, especially houses, shops and 'useful’^pieces of land has increased. But it has not reached the pitch of 1923 and is far from superseding it. The values fixed by the owner's-4- assessor at Rs. 15000/-, 7500/-, and 7500/-, respectively are merely imaginary and only suggest in guise the owner’s desire to get more. In any case although the reclamation of these pieces of land requires huge suins of money, still the Island is marching rapidly towards progress arid after all the expenses incurred on reclamation the pieces may be worth little less than their purchase value plus the cost of reclamation. I am therefore of opinion that the present value* of these pieces of land are Rs. 3000/-, Rs. 2000/-, and Rs. 2000/-, respectively t slightly less than their original purchase values, as compared with the Land Department’s valuations namely Rs. 2500/-, 1500/- and 1500/- respectively. 6. The estimated values of all these properties - houses and pieces of land - are tabulated in the attached appendix. n netter dated August 1933 from Ibrahim bin I.nhamad &gt;*wazi. A.P.A. The applicant's statement in saying that the last piece of his land is measuring 250 dharas by 150 dharas is correct as 1 have v§- ? ifiod this from the original document* fhe -price paid by the owner for this land as mentioned in the document is ^s.2300 and not Rs.2^00.

I beg to state tnat I have come to icnow that you have issued a notification regarding the sale of 3 pieces of land belonging to Ibrahim Muhammad Mahmud Rwazi and situated in the sea. As the date of the pur chase of the said pieces of land was in 1342 (1923) and the said Ibrahim was my partner in business in years 1341 and 1342 (1922-23), and he beiiig in Bahrain and I in Bombay, I knew nothing about the purchase of these pieces of land nor did he enter it in the partnership*s accounts or mention anything about it. I therefore object to his propriety rights and request you not to register the sale of the land at his request until necessary in vestigations have been made in this connection. It is Os' worth noticing from where the said Ibrahim obtainedjjfckis sum of money and how he came to possess the pieces of land. As I have heard, the pieces of land were bought in 1342 (1923) for Rs.8,300/- and have been sold for the same price to Shaikh Mustafa bin Abdul Latif where as the price of land and property has tremendously increased as compared with previous years.and these pieces must be sold for a higher price. This point is also worthy of consideration. At any rate, as the said gentleman haA^no position or money from the very beginning he bought these pieces of land with the joint sum of partnership, and that too, without my knowledge and without crediting it to the accounts, he cairn at be tne owner of the pieces of land or sell them. Besides other land or property which may be found in the name of Ibrahim, I will claim the said pieces of land. I request that the sale of the pieces of land may be postponed. Countersigned.

On 15th Ramadhan ia57 (3-11-33) I wrote a letter under ho,185 from Bingah to the Band Registration Department stating the facts and protesting. Consequently I left for B a hrain from Lmgah in order to sue my claim. On 3rd Shawal 1357 I arrived at Bahrain, but I was not permitted to land, so I was compelled to go to Bushire. On 12th Shawal I returned from Xishire, wanted to land, but was not permitted to do so. I therefore proceeded to Duoai and from There I submitted three letters under Bos#208, 216 and 23/ dated 15th Shawal, 5th Dhil Qadah and 20th Dhil ^adah respectively, asking permission to come to 3 a hrain, but no permi ssion was'given; I proceeded to B a ndar Abbas. It is now understood that the B ahrain Court has issued an 3 X parte decree against me with a view that I did not appear in the Court on the fixed time. In fact I protest aganst that decree according to law and I do no accept it in any way because firstly the Court has neither warned me nor sent me a summons to the effect that I should appear on such and such a time and I defaulted to do so. S e condly I came to B a hrain, but I was not allowed to land. Such being the legal evidences there lies no legal objection or plea against me. In the circumstances if any decree has been issued by the Bahrain Court, against me would be improper and legally could not be considered and the three plots of land in question are my lawful property and nothing else. dsual Bndi ng.No. ^/J Political A^enc^ Bahrain, Si2nd Pobruary 1941 To The Superintendent, Land Be partme nt, Bahrain.

I beg to bring to your notice that Ibrahim had no money so that he may be able to purchase those lands with hie own money for himself and moreover the said Ibrahim had no right to do any sort of transaction for his own person* His treachery can be proveu from the document of partnership which was drawn up in duplicate in 134U of which himself and did not say a word about the Dubai, but unfortunately owing to the intrigues of one copy is in his_o _ hie poeoeBoion.

November, 1938. To H. B. M'S Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum: Reference law relating to the immovable property in Bahrain owned by Iranians. Haji Mohammad Tayab Khunji has withheld from assessment a large piece of open ground in Manamah, Farik Shark (opposite the house occupied by the Assistant Political Agent; and an Amarah in Manamah, the ground floor of which is occupied by his shops and ^odowns and the first floor is on rent. He claims that the former is the site for his future residence but he has failed to build it or begin the building during the one year period of proclamation, and should forfeit the previlege and consequently the ground should be assessed and taken over by the Government. He claims the latter his business premises. This is in accordance with the law but he has no right too rent any poruion of it. he mk.y Uierex'ore be ordered to remove the present tenants. Adviser to the Government.il Oil Statement of Haji Muhammad *ayyib Khunji* We are living at present in tiie house oi my brotner, Haji Muhammad ‘‘•ahir Khunji* The construction of our house has not yet been started but we nave bougnt all tde building material,i•e-, stones, cement, wood, etc., and the construction will begin after tne winter montns are over as now the days are too short and unsuitable for building purposes. The stones are lying at tne site oi tne proposed house. As for the upper storey of tne Amarah in bazar in which our office is situated we want the whole Amarah - lower and upper portions as well - for our business. We are in need of a large number of godowns and as those in tne Amarah are not sufficient for us we have to keep three godowns under our use in the other Amarah which has already been assessed. The division of the Amarah into two will not serve our purpose as we cannot use the upper portion either for our office or godowns. The roof of the buildings in Bahrain are so flimsy that no upper storey can be used for storing purposes. As for shifting the office to the upper storey it will be awfully inconvenient to customers. garden it would be possible for me to retain the garden. The reason why I have not staHiedthe construction oi the house on this piece of land is that I wanted to build a house in tne garden ana sell this piece of land if 1 was allowed to retain the garden. I, therefore, pray that I may be favoured with the permission to keep the garden for myself. When I had an interview with H.B.M T s Political Agent last year I was told that if I built a house in my /0 /&gt; v h?H&amp;AD memorandum No* 868 dated the 22nd November 1938 from th* Adviser to the Bahrain Government, and alao the state ment of Haji Mohammad Tayyib Khunji recorded before the Indian Assistant* 2* To take the Aaarah in Nanamah ^irst* Haji Mohammad Tayyib Khunjl claims that he requires the whole of this /'marah for his business, and I am prepared to accept this contention* He is entitled under the law to retain a place of business and he may be allowed to retain the whole of this 'marah for the purpose* It follows, however, that the building must be retained in actual fact for his business and that no part of It should be rented to other persons. Haji Mohammad Tayyib Khunji therefore must remove the present tenants of the top- storey of his Amarah without delay* 3* In regard to the piece of land for a house, I observe that Haji Mohammad now claims that I told him it would be possible for him to retain his garden if he built a house in it. This is an inaccurate statement* ' hnt T did sny was t t if he built a house in the garden, it mirht be possible to arrange to retain the whole or oart of the garden for residential purposes* Clearly it was his business to come to an a ^anyement ♦ with the Bahrain Government on this account and this h * has failed to do • He may however approach the Bahrain Government direct (provided he does so at once) with a request to be allowed to keep the garden or part of it for the purpose of building a house, as an alternative to retaining the piece of open ground in Manamah, Farik Shark. The Bahrain Government are of course fully justified in claiming that as building has not yet begun even this plot of land should be assessed and taken over. As a matter of grace, however, I consider that/-that it is reasonable to allow Haji Foharimad three months more in which to undertake c nstraction of a house* He claims that he has all the building materials ready and as this is the season in which masons and coolies are readily available it should be easy enough for him to get well ahead with the building within the period of three months. If no active steps are taken within this period for the building of a residence it will be open to the Bahrain Government to apply for further consideration of this part of the Order. 4.

Y.Z.• ^ • 'V &lt; ■ f 1 * “ 5 ’ r • Va.luation of properties of Ha.ii Mohd Taycb KLiunj i , /ll ^yC\ J Re. A.P.A f o dated 29th September, 1938. In the ascessment of these properties I have been guided by a combination of principles and methods, namely, current rent original purchase price and purchase price- in the vicinity as necessitated oy each case. But in each case allowance nas been made for a numoer of factors which ma^e it impossiole to adhere to one particular principle. Por instance, the easiest and most effective method of valu ing the pieces of land would be uo calculate their square area and value them at the rate of square foot. But all the pieces of land under valuation (Nos.3,4 and 5) are so uneven and full of so many corners that it is not possible, with means at ray disposal, to calculate their square area and assess them on that basis. Even the Land Department are not in possession of instruments necessary for this purpose and have no record of the square area of any {jtf* plots ol land. Similarly ) vfMn&gt;e if the gardens are valued at current ren tal their value would be very small as one of them^ specially the large garden (No.7), is still in infancy and while it may not yield a big rental now it is full o± luture potentialities. In the same way,the original purchase price of the piece of land in Hinaini Sooq (No.6) is far in excess of its value owing to the fact that it is no /) its f) longer a source of that nigh income which it used to command when Hinaini water used to oe sold there. 2. The valuation of each of the properties is however discusse*(.under separate heads in the following :- No,1. aMARAH IN BAZAR. : It was bought by the owner for Rs.14,000/- in 1350 (1931) and two rooms were added about 3 years ago at a cost of Rs.7,000/-. The annual rent of the Amarah, as ascertained from the records of municipality, is Rs.860/-, although according to the owner’s statement it is about Rs.1,000/-. The two houses are sepa rately rented and their annual rent was Rs.o65/- each tillA/V Rs. 19,080/- »2- r cf~t&gt; Kv&gt;. Ba lira in Government compulsorily acquiring them and putting them to sale, the owner raised it to Rs.500/- each. The total rent of the Amarah (Rs.360/-) and the two houses (Rs.730/- at the rate of Ro. 06 b/- each) amounts to Rs.1590/- / per annum and to Rs.19,080/- for Ik, years; c-uid ohat is tx^eir present value. The total coot of the Amarah ana the houses according to owner’s own statement, was Rs.hl,000/- out of which he has realised Rs . 6 , 020/- from the Amarah on account of rent for the last 7 years and Ro.1,310/- from the two houses during the last 3 years. In other words, he has earned Rs.7,330/- from the Amarah and the two houses out of a total cost of Rs.21,000/ leaving the unearned value at l\67c/~ Rs.SI,006/- which if deducted from the sum of Rs.19,080/-, n the present value of the &gt;vmarah etc, woulu still leave ^ balance of Rs.5,410/- to owner’s creuit over and above the profits he made from the rents during these years . No.2 (i) A HOUSE RkhR BnhhDIiiYAH . : It was purcnase&lt;* for Rs .3,971/- in lieu of a debt in 1352 (1933). It does not yield any rent at present as tne owner has given it to a friend to live free and even if its past rent is taicen into consideration or its current rent estimated ncitner would give its correct value as a large piece of land is also ; attached to it and, altnough the house itself is old and poorly looking, its value has been increased by this piece of land. It is not very convenient either to assess the house and the piece of land separately as it is not possible to calculate the sqare area of the latter and value it on that basis. Ordinarily I would have assesseu it at its ori- !ginal purchase value but because it was tunen in lieu of a debt and no similar properties in the vicinity would fetch that value, I have reduced R s.521/ - from the original price (ha. Rs .3971/-) and assess the house with the piece of land at Rs.3,450/-. (ii) ^ PlhCE OF i^Nn hmJOINGING (ij xJiOVh . It is a separate piece of land and was bought for-3- A Hs.3,500/- Rs.1,100/- for Re. 50/- in 1353 (1934) out not in lieu oi‘ a debt and i worth Ro.50/- oven today. lii.e total value oi (i) ana (ii; in my opinion is Ro.3,600/- tiaere 1 ore Re . 3, 500/-. No .3 : a Pli.CK J? LxiUD . : The Saaf i huts on tli0 P iecci have not oeen included in the asLessment by the Bahrain Government as they are concerned only with *irfliaemovable property'.’ The piece of ground was bought for Rs.1,000/- in 13o3 (193^). As a rule, the value oi‘ properties has not | increased in the quarters where this piece of land is situ- , ated. But the Laud department has valued it at Rs. 1,100/- and l agree to it. No.4 ; A_PIhCE OF LAND m Qhp HIN4NI S00Q r . : It was Gought for Rs.11,000/- as stated by the owner about 12 years ago. ^it that time it was considered to be a valuable- piece as Hinaini water used to be sold there and its monthly rent was Rs.75/- which amounted to Rs.900/- per annum and Rs.10,800/- for 12 yearsjand that mey be considered its value in those days. But it no longer commands the ori- vileged position of tiajHtoig Hinaini wataer stand. The Bala- diyah built their own stand 4 years ago and closed it down by order. It is neither fit for a house nor a decent shoo which would bring handsome rent as it is situated in „nc of *ne dirtiest parts oi oa^ar ana can only be usea eivher as an indigenous bakery or' as a place for selling grass or fish. It lias been lying waste since then and cannot fetch more than Rs.25/- per mensem if it is rented by the owner. On that presumption its rent for one year would be Rs.300/- and for 12 years Rs.3,600/-, which, in my opinion, is its present value. — •A-—^-ATLOL op LiiN L IN FliRIb, ZnV/ii,VInA ; it was bought for Rs.1000/- aoot 12 years ago. But it is worth raorc now because it lies on the junction of Fariq Zawawida and-4- \A I and Sunni Persian quarters i.o. tne Pariq ^wa^iyah, and Sunni Persians attach % great value to it. One of these Persians actually offerred hs.1,700/- and, if I am not ill-informed, has secretly bought it for tnat amount. But his reason for raising the value to Rs.1,700/- was that he was under the impression that the Land Department had valued it at Rs.1,600/- and he thought it worth while to add another hundred. The purchase has not yet been effected officially i.e. by registration in the Land Department and it is also plausible that when the buyer comes to hnow that the Land Department have valued it at Rs.1,400/- and not Rs.1,600/- he may go back upon his word and may not offer more than Rs.1,500/-, Rs.100/- more than the assessment of the Land Department. In view of these considerations and iii the absence of any record of the exact square area of the plot I think that Rs.1,500/- is quite reasonable price for Rs. 1,500/-/ 7 this piece of land. *1 Rs.200/- No.6: A DhTE GARDEN IN VILLAGE KARRiiNn : It was bought for Rs.200/- in 1354 (1935). Its annual rent is Rs.10/- (Rs.120/- for 12 years) and it has not been looked after properly. At any rate , it is not worth more than Rs.200/- as it is situated on such a high level that no artesian well can propel^ water high enough to reach it. I therefore agree with Uie Land Dess, rtment and assess it at its purchase value. No.7 : A GnRDLD IN SAHnlYh. : The plot was bought from the Bahrain Govenment for Rs.2,000/- about 9 years ago. Two artesian wells were added to it at a cost of Rs.1,800/- z yVV ^ t ’ and Rs. 1,500/- respectively and a sw4^ming tank at Rs.l,600/r D This makes up a total cost of Rs.6,900/- to owner. For the past 9 years the garden is meeting its expenses : its annual yield amounts to Rs.500/- and the owner has been spending ail on it. Ordinarilly, a garden like this, if situated in a village far off Lanamah, would not be a very valuable asset but because it lies at the outskirts of the town its &amp;5 Rs.12,404/- ita value has increased. A full fledged garden in Bahrain is usually valued at the rate of mapua-as . A maghras is tne area necessary for the growth and outspread of one date tree and is equal to 18 to 20 square feet (i.e. 306 to 400 feet). The value of one ma^hras varies from Rs.2/- to Rs.10/- 1 according to the site, the drainage and also the quality of the dates of the garden. But as the present garden is quite close to the town and can be uaea not only as a source of income but also for pastime, I have valued it at Rs.l4/- per maghras. The area of tno garden is approximately 646 A 417 square feet (2,69,382 feet) or 886 maghras at the rate i of 18 square feet (i.e. 304# feet)per maphras and at the rate of Rs.14/- per maghras its value would be Rs.12,404/- ft nLetter No.61/181 de.ted tlie 17tii October, from Ha w i Muiicuamcid Tayeb jbdiunji. ,c/^ h w / y Applie&amp;nt is not satisfied with the valua tion of P.A^ Assessor (with the exception of item 6) and requests that a further period of one year may be granted to him to sell his properties at what he calls their 'real valuation* if the values suggested by him are not accepted by the Bahrain Government. The applicant cannot force his own valuations upon the Bahrain Government or demand any /Vvthem arbitrary value^^rw*^except those fixed by P.A. or those available in the market, whichever is greater (Articles 3 and 4 of Property Law). He has already sold item No,5 for Rs.1,700/-, Rs.200/- more than P.A's valuation, and he is entitled to it not from the Bahrain Government but from the buyer direct. As for ocher items he does not say whether he has been able to find a buyer or not and the question of the validity of their values does not arise• 2. As for the extenfiion of the period, within which he is allowed to own immovable property, to another year, there is no specific provision for or against it in the Property Law. The Law (S.3) only provides that the owner ' may continue to own the property for one year from the date' of the notification issued by the Agency. (2nd November 1937). If it is construed to imply that the owner shoii Id not own it after one year the applicant has no right to e^tenfcion. If it is interpreted to stipulate that he c i '-*h own it even after tne expiry of one year, his request is reasonable. But the discretion lies with tnc Bahrain dnviy Government who, under section 3, 'at any time after the expiry of one year may compulsorily acquire the property or put ft up tor sale', as tnc question of valuation e was referred to us by the Bahrain Government and as Bahrain Government have discretionary powers to acquire the properly &amp;r_tcr ouc r car the point regarding the1^' tension of a period of further one year to enable the applicant to obtain the so-called w real values' for his properties can best be dealt with by them. Of course under the provisions of S.4, every foreigner to whom the Property Law applies 'shall submit to the strict Court a list of such immovable Drooerty' and also 'Hhe district * &gt; -&gt; Court may determine in each case the period within which the assessment shall be completed. But the list of proper ty has been submitted to the District Court and the assessment has been completed and finally decided^and the District Court has nothing to do with the grant or refusal of the exten sion of any period of time to enable the owner to find a better value for his property. May applicant be ashed to apply to Bahrain Govern ment . 3* as for the interview requested by him in connec tion with the garden, P.A. or A.P.A. may fix time. Probably applicant will request P.A. to exempt the garden from J&amp;xc ^ Prouerty Law. 1 ‘ ! /W' «-T o t OU-. is?. r L U-n . ^ ^ j?- / ^,'Z£c SruJn^JZZK/. • A (flluXa (y t C,uc ^ ^ , is, r\L. btZL J ^ ^^ IJl LXZL% No * 298-K/22.

Political Agent, Bahrain Yusuf Dilumi, BahrainTranslation of a letter dated 1st roharram 1359 (10th February 1940) from Hsg i ¥usuf Dilumi to the Political Agent, Bahrain. On the 27th (6/2/40) I received your letter and I do not know how to make a statement in reply to what you have stated which may be acceptable to you. A sum of Hs.6000 or more can be obtained as rent per annum from a property on which a sum of Hs.235C00/- has been paid and spent though it has not been conpleted. It will surely on completion brings more money. There is no reason that it should be sold at such a price. I never heard in my life that the -tiigh Government has treated her subjects in such an unfavour able manner. The high Government became master of the whole world by her just treatment to her subjects but on the contrary owing to my own bad luck I was not treated favourably. As regards the vacation of the place I at once complied with your orders and vacated it. I am grateful for your permission to me to leave the place, and 1 hope to do so as soon as I recover the various claims which I have against the people of tds&amp;A Bahrain.15^ GQVgRENMgNT OF BAHRAIN .

Sir, The Head of the 3rd Political Department has informed the Assistant Oriental Secretary that a certain Ibrahim Behbani, of ^badan, ha's complained to the Imperial Government that his uncle Hajji Yusef, an Iranian subject resident in --'SB Bahrein, had recently had his landed property there expropriated M at a valuation which he considers unjustly low. He has been - % paid Rupees 39,000 but considers that the property was worth Rupees 235,000. Monsieur Inti^am asked that enquiries might be ma.de regarding this complaint, and I shall be grateful if you will furnish me with a report on the matter. 2. In view of the possibility of more formal representa tions being made by the Imperial Government if the complaint should prove to be well founded, I consider that we should bear in mind the principle set out in paragraph 3 of Mr. Butier s letter No.548/^/38 of the 2nd duly 1938 to your predecessor, namely, that we should always be ready to make enquiries as to the facts in any case, but should not agree either to transmit representations from the Imperial Governmen tc the Sheikh’s Government or to put pressure .on the latter. &amp; am, Sir, Your obedient servant The Hon’ble Lt.Col. -•b.

Haji Yusuf had submitted his list of property to the District Court in September 1938 and this included two Amaras which the Bahrain Government were entitled to acquire under the terms of the Property Law. The Bahrain Government appointed their assessor and Haji Yusuf was also invited to appoint his own assessor. This he refused to do and the Bahrain Government*© assessor submitted his estimate of the value of the two Amaras at the end of October 1939. The assessment, which appeared to be very reasonable, was confirmed by me. Baji Yusuf then wrote in December 1939 to me protecting against the acquisition of his property on the untenable ground that he had acquired it with cash which he had brought from Persia. Ke said that he would not even sell it for is 5 la£hs. He was summoned to appear before me the assessor. This he refused to accept and the cheque is still in this office. The Bahrain Government took over possession of the two Amaras and subsequently leased them for h 3250/- per annum. Bince property owners in Bahrain it is sufficiently evident from this that the valuation of fe 39,000 was on the generous side. The valuation of &amp; 2,35,000 claimed by Haji Yusuf*s nephew is ridiculous. the Bahrain law regarding ownership of immovable property by and was offered a cheque for * 39,000, the figure fixed by expect to fl£ke 10 % oft their capital outlay at least Yours sincerely, Captain A.C.

A Persian subject who has lived at Bahrain for some time, named Haji Muhammad Yusuf DaILAMI, owns property in Bahrain. In accordance with a recent law he has to sell his property, and on receiving instruc tions from the local authorities to that effect he has been trying to find a buyer. But he cannot find a buyer who will give him more than 35,000 Hupees, though he frimself says he bought the land for 235,000 Rupees. It is in fact a forced sale. 3. The Prime Minister has sent the papers to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, directing them to talk over the matter with this Legation. The Prime Minister suggests that the matter of the sale might be allowed to lie fallow for the duration of the war • 4. I should be grateful for your observations in this matter.

I take it that the fact of the Hinistry of the Interior having referred this case to the Bushire Governorate implies^ that they view Bahrain as a part of the territory of that Covernorate; for, if they regarded it as foreign territory, they would have approached His Majesty # s Legation direct.

About a year and half ago my father Haji Yusuf Dilumipur r — was at Bahrain and had a business connection. He was told by the Bah. ain Government either to acouire Bahrain nationality or to leave the country for Persia leaving all his property there. He did so and came to Iran. He possesses a house and a Caravanserai at Bahrain. According to Bahrain law he had to se&amp;l the Caravanserai to Government who wished to take only for Rs.39,000, but as my father has spent more money over the building he did not J\ agree to this term and asked for actual cost of building which is about Bs.225,000. In fact, this building was actually bought by my father from late Haji Abul Qasim Shirazi for Ps. 150,000 and then he made further extention to it costing him Rs.75,000. r It appears that the Bahrain Government have taken possession of the Caravanserai and are not prepared to pay anything more than the above sum. I therefore beg to request your honour that either the Bahrain Government purchase the building as per documents my father holds showing the actual amount spent on it, or allow him to sell the building to others at the current rate ruling there. Should the above be impracticable and since the building has now been gifted to me by my father I may be peimitted by the Government of Bahrain to go there and stay at Bahrain and acquire the Bahrain nationality. I hope that your honour will give your kind consideration to this case for which act of kindness I will be grateful for ever. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd.

The file contains several of these cases where litigants either claim property or dispute the prices paid for property up for sale due to the new regulation. Most correspondence is between Persian subjects and the Political Agency in Bahrain, alongside property evaluations carried out by the Land Registration Department in Bahrain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Property legislation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Conflict resolution</topic></subject><subject><topic>Migration law</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002c7#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
