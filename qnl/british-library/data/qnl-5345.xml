According ly the Government of India, after consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf have sanctioned the revision of the fixed travelling allowance allotments on the basis of past actuals as shown below:- From to Bushire Rs. 5400 Rs.8400 Mohammerah Rs. 600 Rs.1000 Bandar Abbas Rs. 800 Ps.1200 Bahrain Rs. 800 P.s.2000 Kerman Rs. 800 Ps.2400 • Kuwait Rs, 300 Rs.1000 ^Musoat^ e c&amp;j v ^o / x # CQ K 800 Rs.14003 # The increased rates will remain in force for a period end of which period the possibility of modification will he considered.

With 2 spare copies..„„ Tot+pr of 21st December 1921, requirt Three points raised by the foreign 1 to be dealt with.- of the compensation which ^ (1) the Treasury stipulation that n p- x ^ i a V v ^ nn the abolition of the staff posts ■fesy may have to be pa^d toncmed shall fall »» th« Imperial Erdiequer. (2) the Treasury demahd that the poet at Shuster should continue to be a charge upon Mesopotamian funds. (3) the Treasury suggestion that there should be an enquiry into the comparative cost of the maintenance of the consular posts in Persia in the British and Insian spheres Consideration of these points has been delayed in the hope of receiving ^ by mail a copy of the detailed orders passed by the Government of India on ^ the Secretary of State's telegram of 7th January, which would have rendered ^ it possible to inform the Treasury what steps had been taken to give effect eir stipulation that a suitable proportion of the increase of pay d be regarded as a bonus reducible when the cost of living appreciably falls. 7 ' This is, however, not essential, and further delay in dealing with the three points noted above appears inadvisable. ( 1 ) ( 2 ) for 0D6 {beenq (/‘'V (3) The question of an enquiry into the comparative cost of maintenance of consular posts in Persia in the British and Indian spheres. The high cost of Consular posts maintained by India has long been a stumbling block to the Treasury, and it will be recollected that Mr. (how Sir John) Wood was sent on deputation to the Persian Gulf in 1912 to report on possible economies. Certain reductions in expenditure were thereupon made, but their effect has been largely counterbalanced by the increase i^expenditure now sanctioned. It is probable, however, that with the very large recent increase in the pajr of the Levant Consular Service, one cause of the discrepancy has no longer its former influence. What the exact nature of the enquiry is which the Treasury propose there is nothing to show. Probably they themselves have no clear ideas on the point. It is unlikely that they would accept a purely ex parte enquiry such as that of 1912. They presumably desire a committee of enquiry■ 921 , Minute Paper.

It therefore appears desirable that a small cornrai ssi on * consisting of one representative of of. the Treasury, one representative of the Foreign Office, and one representative of the India Office should visit one or two consulates from each sphere, examine local conditions, and report on the possibility of reduction of expenditure. It ought also to be within the instructions of the commission to report whether the small scale of expenditure on Foreign Office Consulates is consistent with true economy* From the point of view of this office the appointment of a representative on such a commission would be in accordance with the general principle that members of this office should, when possible, gain some direct knowledge of the countries with which they are concerned. It is understood that Mr. Monteath wbuld be willing to serve in such a capacity* The expense involved need not be great though this is probably the point to which the Treasury will raise objection. Another point which requires consideration is whether such an enquiry should be undertaken in anticipation of the proposals which the Government of India have been promising for the last two years in regard to expenditure in Persia in general. On the whole it appears that the enquiry into consular expend iture may well be undertaken independently of the general question, and that the investigation of the committeecommittee will be a useful, if not indeed a necessary, pre liminary to the consideration of the broader problems which it may be expected tbit the Government of India will wish discussed in this connection.

A draft telegram is accordingly submitted which embodies the views of the Financial Secretary as expressed in pencil on the draft letter on the composition of the suggested Committee. (SD.) J.A. SIMPSON. 21/4/22. Financial Secretary For the favour of observations. It seems to me t subject to your views, that it is premature at present to propose the particular from of enquiry suggested in the draft telegram, and that it is impossible to say what procedure will best meet the case until the ground has been cleared by a further examination of the facts. I do not know whether the Financial Department has any further information (e.g. budget estimates) which would make it possible to draw up a reasonably up-to-date comparative statement of India and Foreign Office scales of expenditure^ or to identify the particular items to which Treasury criticism is likely k &lt;Ljl (1) &gt; ■ J to be directed at the present time. In so far as disparities are due to the difference in scales of pay between officers of the Indian Political DepartmentMinute Paper. Department. J &lt;■) ICjp? { S&gt; and officers of the Consular services, it is obvious that enquiry by a touring committee would not advance matters, and on the other hand it seems to me doubtful whether it would be wcafeh while to appoint such a committee to investigate details of menial establishment etc. If a comparison shows that it is true generally that the Foreign Office consulates are able to make do with a substantially lower scale of office establishment, etc. it seems a question whether the most effective procedure would not be to fix correspondingly low figures for the various Indian consulates and to call on the officers concerned to rearrange their establishments accordingly or to show cause at once why this is impossible. The appointment of an Indian Hetrenchment Committee also appears possibly to afford a means of enquiry which may without any further arrangements meet the wishes of the Treasury for immediate purposes. I find it difficult to believe that the Covemment of India in their present mood, and with a Retrenchment Committee to assist them, will overlook any opportunities of economy, even those verging on meanness, I have added a draft letter as an alternative for consideration.Draft Paper. r t ,n 1 6 . /T ‘ „ y ^ 4290 3000 7/21 [3413—2] i 2223 1 „ Department.

Viscount Peel is quite prepared to accept this proposal in principle, and to take such steps as may be thought most appropriate to give effect to it; but he feels at present considerable doubt what those steps should be, and he would suggest that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, with whom the proposal originated, should be invited to indicate their views on the subject in more detail. In order to decide on the course to be adopted it would appearappear desirable in the first place to obtain a statement, as up-to-date as possible, of the figures which are proposed to be brought into comparison. It i will then appear what disparities in scales of expenditure in fact exist, and the Lords Commission ers of the Treasury will be able indicate any particular items that in their opinion call for special scrutiny.

The grounds for the above increases of expenditure are explained ^n detail in the letter of the Political Resident and its enclosures Briefly speakino-, the enhanced rates of pay and allowances are based on the high cost of^iivino*, the entire absence of amenities and the other drawbacks attendant on service at Bahrein, while the new appointments are advocated ■partly to cope with the existing work, but mainly in anticipation of the additional duties which will devolve on the Political Agent and his staff on the introduction of the Bahrein Order-in-CounciL He have given the proposals our careful consideration and are satisfied as to their ultimate necessity. Bahrein is at present the most unpopular and expensive post m the Persian Gulf, and the office is probably the hardest worked of all those under the Bushire Residency. At the time of the introduction of the office allowance system the amount of the Bahrein allowance and the personnel of the establishment were fixed at the lowest possible minimum, as it was honed that substantial economies in labour and expenditure would result from the new scheme. Our expectations, however, as regards the diminution of wmrk have not been realised, and it is evident that salaries which may, until comparatively recently, have been adequate are no longer so. ^ In submitting his recommendations as regards this Agency in 1912, Mr. Wood entered a caution that, owiny to the cost of living and the burden of work, an increase of expenditure might he found necessary before long. 4 . We do not, however, desire to give effect to the proposals regarding the Indian Assistant, the interpreter, the munshi and the additional provision for judicial contingencies unless and until the Oider-in-Couneil is brought into force. Its introduction*remains suspended under your Lordship’s tele gram, dated the 22nd November 1913. The proposals concerning the head clerk, the second clerk, the vernacular clerk and the record-keeper are un connected with the Order, but we consider that these also, with the exception of that relating to the head clerk, may, without detriment, he postponed pending its introduction. The head clerk stands in a position somewhat different from that of the other clerks, and has, in our opinion, a strong claim to immediate relief. We have, therefore, sanctioned the grant to him of the increases recommended as an alternative hy Sir P. Cox, viz., a local allowance of Rs. 50 a month and an enhanced house-rent allowance of Rs. 20 a month. As regards the remaining proposals, we request, your Lordship’s sanction to the creation of an additional appointment of Indian Assistant on Rs. 250—10—300 a month, with a house-rent allowance of Rs. 25 a month, to take effect from the date on which the Order-in-Council comes into force; and to the lump sum addition of Rs. 3,000 to the office allowance (which will thus be raised from Rs. 12,200 to Rs. 15,20Q) with effect from the same date, it being left to the Political Agent, to rearrange Ins staff as he may think best. We recommend this enhancement of the office allowance on the understanding that it will be regarded as a final settlement, and that any further expenditure from theTpvispd allowance that may he found necessary in future on any account will be met by countervailing economies under the same head.

In the first two communications above noted Major Trevor asks, on the general grounds of increased cost of living and a lack of the amenities of life, for an increase in pay for his Head Clerk and the two junior clerks of his office. The third communication embraces the above proposals and others connected with the introduction of the new Bahrein Order-in-Council. 3. As regards the former, Major Trevor has explained the position fully. For tha reasons given by him, Bahrein is at present certainly the most unpopular post in the Gulf and relief of some kind is, in my opinion, urgently needed. 4. An increase to their salaries has, as the Government of India are aware, already been asked for by the Consular Officers at Mohammerah and Ahwaz for the Head Clerks at those ports, and in the case of the latter, Government have recently been pleased to sanction a local allowance of Rs. 30 per mensem. The conditions of life at Bahrein are certainly more difficult than at either of the two posts above referred to, and if Government find themselves unable to accede to a definite increase of salary in the case of the Head Clerk, I would venture to suggest a local allowance for the post of not less than Rs. 50 per men sem. 5. At the existing cost of living, the present scale of pay does not, in my opinion, reasonably suffice. As Major Trevor has pointed out, the temptation 1 for clerks at Bahrein to augment their salaries by irregular means is a very con siderable one, and the latter is, I regret to say, a feature of the position w r hich has i recently come prominently to my notice. 6. As regards Major Trevor’s third communication (No. 687 of 8th Novem ber 1913), I understand that further publicity is not to be given to the Bahrein Order-in-Council for the present. I venture respectfully, however, to express the hope that this fact may not be allowed to preclude consideration by Government of the various recommendations made by our Political Agent at Bahrein in his present communication. 7. The proposals for increased stall are necessitated by and are the direct result of a policy deliberately considered and sanctioned by Government, and they will have to be faced sooner or later. The enclosure to Major Trevor’s letter affords ample testimony to the very extensive nature of the Political Agent’s jurisdiction under the Order-in-Council, and I do not consider it will be feasible for the extra work involved by the latter to be performed in an efficient manner with the limited staff at present available. The increase amounts to Rs. 6,585 which, it is expected, will be covered by j the realisation of fees proposed to be levied under the Order. 8. Under these circumstances, Major Trevor’s recommendations for an increased office establishment have my ready support, and I venture to submit them for the very favourable consideration of Government. 9. The usual proposition statement is being submitted through the Compt roller, India Treasuries. 568F.D. - .*,0 A*c 4 No. 685, dated Bahrein, the 8 th November 1913. From— Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrein, To—L ieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to address you regarding the pay of the clerks of mv office, which was fixed in the recent reorganization of the Gulf Offices by Foreign Depart ment letter No. 2085-Est. A., dated the 6th July 1912. As this letter has divide the establishment into pensionable and non-pensionable portions, I presume i will be necessary to deal with these separately. I had been waiting to address you on the whole subject until the publication of the Bahrein Order-m-Council, but as the Order does not appear it is undesirable to wait any longer 1 therefore venture to submit this letter on the question of the pay of the Head Clerk who now is the only pensionable member of my office, and to ask that it may be consi e with my letter No. 686 of to-day dealing with the remainder of the clerical estab lishment. The pay of the Head Clerk is now Rs. 120-6-150 'plus Rs. 15 house rent. I beg to urge that this is insufficient having regard to the very high and ever increasing cost of living here. As far as my experience goes the cost of the necessaries of life here is much greater than at any other place in the Gulf. Nothing J 8 § here except a few inferior dates and a little lucerne—there is no livestock to speck of in the island. Consequently everything has to be imported which natura tends to high rates. This is greatly aggravated by the fact that the greater part of the community live by the pearling business. This appears to induce speculate e and extravagant habits amongst those engaged in it, and dea ers and brokers and divers alike throw money about like water when they have it, and run up heav) debts when they have not. Divers especially will pay fancy prices for anything they want, especially for meat, fish and fruit, etc., and this habit naturally raises the rates even higher. At the present time the prices of various principal commodities are as follows Water (best quality available from Hunaiui .. Annas 4 to annas 8 a small goat skin. Water “ Ghaful ” (brackish) Annas 1 to 1-6 a skin. ' .. 6 to 8 annas a lb. Meat Fish' Fowls Wheat Flour Rice 4 annas a lb. Rupees 2 each. 0 - 1-6 a lb. 0-1-9 a lb. 0-2-0 to 0-2-3 a lb. A natural corollary of these high rates is that wages are very high. A cooly wants at least a rupee a day, and annas 4 for any trifling job. No servant can be got under Rs. 16 to 18 per mensem, and servants are very independent as there a always lobs going for them. No tailors or boot makers, who can do other than Aral/style work, exist in Bahrein, nor is there any school to which a clerk can send his children unless he is a member of the Dutch Reformed Church of Amen or does not mind running the risk that his children may become members of that body This fact, combined with the unpleasantness and unhealthmess of the climate, renders it often necessary for a married man to keep up two establishments which of course nearly doubles his expenditure. In view of the facts set forth above, I trust it will be agreed that life here for clerks is very expensive. It is also very unpleasant, as no amenities of lift, exist for an educated man, and no recreations of any sort. In the circumstances clerks deserve good pay. and I would respectfully urge that the Head Clerk s W b ® to Rs. 150-10-200 plus Rs. 20 house rent. I may mention that Rs. 20 is ac y paid in rent now by the Head Clerk and 2nd Clerk and Vernacular Clerk. I have heard that some of the other Political Officers in the Gulf have »PP w that the maximum pay of the Head Clerks of then offices should be raised to Rs. 180 wffich H the pay of the Head Clerk at Muscat. Perhaps if these applications are sanctioned it may Le thought desirable for the sake of f We hme office the same. I beg to say that in my opinion the extra cost of living heregreatly exceeds tlie extra Us. 20 for which I am applying. The only appreciable difference therefore which pay of Rs. 200 per mensem would make, would be a slight increase in the clerk’s pension, and I venture to assert that, if a clerk serves here long enough for a pension and remains here until he has earned it, he richly deserves this small benefit. As the Tlead Clerk’s is the only pensionable post on the establishment I have not submitted a proposition statement. No. 686 , dated Bahrein, the 8 th November 1913. From —Major A. P. Trevor, C.I E., Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In continuation of my letter No. 685, dated the 8th November 1913,1 have the honour to address you on the subject of raising the pay of the two junior non- pensionable cerks in the Agency establishment. For the reasons set forth in my above-mentioned letter in the case of the Head Clerk, the junior clerks find it difficult, if not impossible, to live on their present pay, and they have considerable temptation to augment it by irregular means. Clerks ' get higher pay in merchants’ offices and often have better openings for advance- j ment. At the present moment both the 2nd Clerk and Vernacular Clerk are pay ing Rs. 20 each house rent for quite inferior quarters. I therefore venture to propose that the pay of the 2nd Clerk should be raised to Rs. 95-5-120 and that the Vernacular Clerk should receive the same. V hen the office allowance for this Agency was sanctioned by the Government of India in their Foreign Department letter No. 20875-Est.A., dated the 6th July 1912, out of a total grant of Rs. 12,200 an allotment of Rs. 7,504 was sanctioned for establishment based on the pay of the existing office establishment, viz : Per mensem. Per annum. Rs. a. p. Rs. A. p. Rs. Interpreter ..100-10-150 137 8 0 House rent .. 15 0 0 Total 152 8 0 1,830 2 nd Clerk ..75-5-100 93 12 0 House rent .. 15 0 0 Total 108 12 0 1,305 Vernacular Clerk .. 75-5-100 93 12 0 House rent .. 15 0 0 Total 108 12 0 1,305 Daftari .. • • • • 42 0 0 500 Menial Establishment • • » • 90 0 0 1,080 Compounder and Dresser .. .. 42 0 0 500 Two Hospital servants at Rs. 16 each 32 0 0 384 Boat Establishment .. 50 0 0 600 Total 626 0 0 7,504 The other allotments of the grant were reduced to the lowest possible amounts, and it is therefore not possible for me to increase the pay of these two clerks without exceeding my office allowance, or stinting the expenditure under other heads. For this reason it is necessary for me to ask for an increase in the office allowance grant. I do not, however, desire to ask simply for an increase in the allowance of an amount corresponding to the proposed increase of pay, but to request that the proposed increase of pay may be sanctioned, and the increases in the allowance and other changes may be considered with the tentative proposals regarding the Bahrein Order-in-Ccuncil which I am submitting with my letter Nc. 687 of to-day..4 No. 687, dated Bahrein, the 8 th November 1913. From Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrein, To Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to address you on the subject of the reorganization of the Agency Office, which will, in my opinion, become necessary on the appearance oi Bahrein Order-in-Council. I believe that the Order will be issued before long, and I therefore venture to address you on the subject in anticipation of its appearance, partly because it has become necessary to ask for an increase in the pay of the head and junior clerks of the office, and it seems to me desirable to put all proposals about the establishment forward together ; and partly because, m my opinion, if a hopeless congestion of work is to be avoided, it is very desirable, and even necessary, that an increase of the establishment should be sanctioned and appointed (if possible) before the day on which the order is to come into force. I have already suggested in my letters Nos. 685 and 686 of to-day, that the pav of the Head Clerk should be increased to Rs. 150-10-200 plus Rs. 20 house rent, and the pav of the two junior clerks (2nd Clerk and Vernacular Clerk) to Rs. 95-5-120 plus Rs 20 house rent on account of the excessive and ever increasing cost of living in Bahrein. I have dealt with these increases separately, as of course they are quite distinct proposals, but it seems advisable to include them in this scheme, which is intended to deal comprehensively with the whole matter. I now beg to propose that the following new posts should be created One Native Assistant and Registrar of the Court on Rs. 250-10-300 plus Rs. 25 house rent. One Record Keeper for English and Vernacular records on Rs. 80-5-100 plus Rs. 20 house rent. One Munshi on Rs. 50 per mensem plus Rs. 10 house rent. I beg to set forth below my grounds for proposing the above-mentioned appointments :— Native Assistant and Registrar—l venture to think that a perusal of the Order- in-Council shows conclusively that the Political Agent must have some responsible officer of the Court who can assist him in the general judicial work, and also in the administration of estates, in bankruptcy proceedings, etc. I foresee that it will frequently become necessary to appoint an officer of the Court as adminis trator of estates or a receiver in bankruptcy proceedings. There are always a lot of the latter, though it is more often in the form of winding up the afiairs of an absccn ling debtor, than of regular bankruptcy cases. Absconlmg has been reduced to a fine art in Bahrein. “ Bahranis ” being so clannish and secretive actually “ abscond ” (to all intents and purposes) while actually lying perdu somewhere in the place, awaiting a suitable moment for opening negotiations with their creditors with a view to compounding. Meanwhile, of course, all the work of selling effects, collecting assets, etc., has to go on. Hitherto esta-tes and bankruptcy business has been done through the Mujlis-el-Urfi in a dilatory and haphazard manner, cases dragging on for years. After the issue of the Order a great deal of extra work will devolve upon the Political Agent in estates alone. Further, a responsible officer is required to take charge of the Agency during the absence of the Political Agent on tour, etc. Under the present conditions the Political Agent has very little time for Political work, or to interest himself in com mercial matters, or indeed to do anything but judicial work, and work connected with it. There are a number of petty cases, but they would not take up all the time if it were not for the fact that so many summons and letters have to be sent to the “ Amirs ”, and even complaints made to the Sheikh before the attendance of the parties can be secured. A great deal of this work could be taken off the Political Agent’s hands if he had a trustworthy and responsible Native Assistant, especially if the latter could be given the powers of a third class Magistrate and of a third grade Munsif in Bahrein. I do not know if there are any legal or other objections to this but if it is possible it would be an excellent thing from a local point of view. The Political Agent would then be not tied to Headquarters as he is at present, and at times when the PoliticalAgent had urgent or important Political work to do, the Native Assistant could relieve him of the petty case work. Now that an arrangement has been arrived at with Turkey regarding the status of Katar, I anticipate that it will become increasingly necessary for the Political Agent to visit that place in order to get into personal touch, and if possible friendly relations with the Ruling Sheikhs there and his relatives. In the same way if Bin Saud retains possession of Hasa and Katif, it will become necessary to visit the ports on that part of the coast fairly frequently, in order to get into personal relations with Bin Baud’s Lieutenants in those places. As most of the import into Hasa and Katif is done through Bahrein, and as there is a considerable export of dates from there, a good deal of which is in the hands of Hindus, cases are bound to arise in which the Agency will require the assistance of these gentlemen. As they govern in the old patriarchal style, not very much can be done by correspondence, unless backed up by friendly personal relations and occasional visits. In the future, therefore, it may become necessary for the Political Agent to be absent from Headquarters a good deal. In such circumstances, I beg to say that I think it is undesirable that the Agency should be left in charge of the Head Clerk, a non-gazetted officer on small pay, unless he happens to be a man of great integrity of character, as the temptations are considerable. I venture to urge, therefore, that even now it is necessary to have a res ponsible officer to relieve the Political Agent of some of the petty cases, and to leave him free to do other more important work; and that in the future it will be still more necessary in order to have a responsible officer to leave in charge of the Agency. Taking into consideratoin the work^he will have to do, and the re sponsibilities of his post, I would further urge that the Native Assistant should be a gazetted officer. Should such a post be sanctioned it will be impossible to expect any intelligent educated man to stay in it with the prospect of remaining at Bahrein all his service or for an indefinite number of years. Occasionally the post might be given to one of the Interpreters or Munshis at this or some other office in the Gulf on promotion or as a reward for good work ; but ordinarily no such man having proper qualifications—which ought to include a good working know ledge of the Indian Codes which will be made applicable to Bahrein—is likely to be available. I would suggest therefore that as a rule the post should be filled by voung Muhammadan officers who have studied Arabic at school or at the Univer sity and who desire to see a little of the Gulf. Such officers might be seconded for four or five vears for service here, and should be men who are already holding or are in the running for gazetted appointments. As mentioned above I consider it essential that the Native Assistant should be a gazetted officer. Record Keeper. It is very necessary that the records of the English office and Vernacular office should be properly kept and the files of the cases properly indexed and numbered, etc. At present the staff is overburdened with work, nd no one has time to look after the records, consequently it is very difficult to t ace papers, or find an old case, and a great deal of time is thus wasted. ' hen tr t busy with the records the Record Keeper can assist either the English office or the Vernacular office as need may arise. The English office will have a considerable quantity of extra work thrown on it by the introduction of the Order-in-Council, e.g., registering several thousand persons, a large ^number of boats and other things. Munshi —This official should be a man who knows Arabic well (and prefer- Persian also) and can write a good hand. He need not know English. H will be employed in making fair copies of letters, filling m summons, writina routine letters to the Amir’s Mujlis members, etc., in short all work not mne a knowledge of English. He will also take simple cases to the Kazi, Tnd to the Salifah Judge. As regards the present staff of the Vernacular office, I would propose to retain Hp Interpreter on a slightly modified scale of pay; wz., Rs. 125=5=150 instead f R 100=10=150 plus house rent at Rs. 20 instead of Rs. 15 to be on the sarne f otincr as the other clerks. The present incumbent is now drawing Rs. 120. With the appointment of a Native Assistant he would be free to do his proper 568FDTo meet the incteased expenditure proposed, there will he considerable receipts under the Order-in-Council—-firstly by fees received for the registration of British and Foreign subjects amenable to the Order ; secondly by Court-fees ; and thirdly by fees received for miscellaneous Consular and notarial duties performed by the Political Agent. As regards tlie first head, in accordance with the terms of the Order, I would propose that Rs. 2 he charged to well-to-do people, and Re. 1 to everyone else. As any cooly here can earn Re. 1 (and more) in a day, this amount will not be bur densome. 1 have been making enquiries through the heads of the various commum-; ties as to the number of registrable persons with the result shown in the annexed table. I have classed as “ temporary ” certain petty shopkeepers, masons, labour ers and others who come over at the busy seasons and remam for some months, •ometimes some years, before going home. The “ floating ” population consists mostly of divers, haulers, and other persons connected with the pearling business, together with, I regret to say, a considerable number of loafers, pimps and other undesirable hangers-on who follow the divers. The total estimated numbers are :—■ Nationality. (A). fe I Permanent. (A). 1 Temporary. (B). Floating.

It is difficult to give any estimate of the probable receipts under the third head, Miscellaneous Consular and Notarial Fees, as there are no data to go on. The fees might be levied at the rates laid down m Instructions to Consular Offi cers ” but realised in Indian Court-fee Stamps instead of Consular Stamps. There will be a certain number of boats belonging to Persian residents to register, and some odd fees for registration of documents, attestations, passports, etc. 1 do not, how ever, think much will be realised, and think that Rs. 500 would cover the probable receipts under this head. Thus the estimated receipts will amount to :— Under Head 1 Registration Fees „ „ 2 Court-fees .. . „ 3 Miscellaneous Consular Rs. 5,000 per annum. 1,500 „ „ 500 „ Total .. 7,000 „ The cost of the increase of establishment which I am now proposing amounts to Rs. 6,585 per annum, and, as noted above, I estimate the receipts under the Order to be Rs. 7,000 per annum, that is to say, that no extra expense to Government will be involved by my proposals. I would respectfully request therefore that the allotment for this Agency under “ 25-Political ” may be increased by Rs. 4,260 and that the “ Office Allow ance ” grant may be increased by Rs. 2,800 bringing it up to Rs. U5,000. I have added Rs. 475 to the Rs. 2,325 actually required for new posts and increases of pay, as a larger grant for “ Judicial Contingencies ” is urgently necessary even now, and will be still more required when the Order-in-Council comes out. I may mention that my present annual allotment of Rs. 300 under this sub-head in the w Office Allowance ” grant was already exceeded by Rs. 25-14-0 in the September accounts. I earnestly trust therefore that my suggestions may be accepted and the new posts sanctioned, and hope that you will see your way to recommending my pro posals favourably to Government. In conclusion I beg to observe that for some years now, Political Agents here have been awaiting the publication of the Order-in-Council, and pending its appear ance have been willing to carry on the Court and Vernacular work in the hand-to- mouth slipshod way in which it has to be done at present owing to the limited staff. After the appearance of the Order and the establishment of a regular Court on a proper legal footing, it would, I venture to urge, be derogatory to our position in Bahrein to carry on the judicial work in any but a really efficient and correct manner ; and I venture to say that no Political Agent will ever consent to preside over a properly constituted court with the present inadequate staff of the Verna cular office for any longer time than he can help. On all grounds an increase of the staff is urgently required, and I have therefore ventured to lay these proposals before you for favourable consideration.

FOREIGN AND POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. ESTABLISHMENT. To The Most Hon’ble the MARQUESS of CREWE, K.G., Bis Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Simla, the 6th August 1914. My Lord Marquess, We have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with ; Your Lordship’s Political despatch No. 10, dated the 31st January 1913, \ confirming our instructions in connection with the reduction ot expenditure on Agencies and Consulates under the Busbire Residency. 2 In paragraph 3(7) of our letter in the Foreign Department to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 2085 Est.-A., dated the 0th July 1912, it was laid down that unexpended balances of contract grants will lapse at the end of each financial year. This rule has been found in practice to result in considerable inconyenience. For it is frequently necessary for disbursing officers to make purchases, e.g., of medical or marine stores, from Government Departments, such purchases being adjusted by book debit. But statements of account from the Departments concerned are often not received before the close of the financial year, and disbursing officers in consequence find it difficult so to regulate their expenditure as not to exceed their office allowances°or contract grants. The rule, moreover, really militates against economy, since it offers no inducement to officers to effect a saving in such grants. 3. We consider that the above difficulty will best be met by permitting Consular officers and Political Agents who are entrusted with the control of office allowances and other contract grants to carry forward to the next financial year all unexpended balances of these grants and by allowing them, in addition, to overdraw against the latter up to a limit of Rs. 250 in each case: such overdrafts to he adjusted by debit against thq contract grants sanctioned for the ensuing financial year. t 31^ s19U 5/1911.

This aspect of the new system was not considered in detail when the proposals in connection with office allowances were submitted for sanction, for it seemed unlikely that anyone would be adversely affected to an appreciable extent. Since the receipt of your letter, however, the matter ha^s been very carefully examined. The result of this examination has be^n to confirm our original impression. As the exact pensionary benefits which might have accrued under the old conditions to incumbents ox appointments which havenow ceased to be pensionary depended considerably on future probabilities, it is difficult to suggest any hard and fast rule to saxcgu&lt; such interests in those instances where they are ■ , threatened.threatened. We propose, therefore, to make no general recoi mendations hut to deal with each case as it arises, on its merits, allowing enhanced pensions, with the sanction of the Secretary of State, in cases where such a course appears clearly justifieo hy the circumstances.

My Lord Marquess, We have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Your Lordship’s despatch No. 10 (Political), dated the 31st January 1913, approving of the orders issued in our letter No. 2085 Est.-A., dated the 6th July 1912, to the address of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, with the object of effecting a reduction of expenditure on the Agencies and Consulates under the Bushire Residency. 2. Paragraphs 3 to 5 of the letter referred to contained instructions regulating expenditure from the office allowance and fixing the status of incumbents of pensionable appointments who were in future to he paid from that allowance. For the reasons explained in the enclosed copy of correspondence with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, we have now sanctioned a slight modification of those orders as regards the incidence of the privilege leave allowances of these men, and in requesting Your Lordship to confirm our orders we would ask for general authority to make a similar modification ot the office allowance rules in any other Consulate or Agency where the new system has been or may be introduced.

I have the honour to address Government on the subject of paragraph 4 (b) (ii) (2) of Foreign Department letter No. 2085-Est.A., dated the 6th July 1912, and to enclose, for reference, copies of the communications marginally noted that have NO 2108 Of sth September 1912. passed between the Comptroller, India T. A. No. 1026 Of 2nd October 1912. Treasuries, and myselt m that connection. 2. It will be observed that “ short leave ” has been defined by the Comptroller, India Treasuries, as “ privilege leave ” or “ examination leave” and long leave ^ as “ all other kinds of leave ” subject to the proviso that the allowance for the pri vilege portion of such leave shall be debitable to the Office Allowance , 3. It is especially in connection with the latter kind of leave that I now ha\e the honour to address Government. Owing to the d'fficulties of communication and the expense of the Journey it is seldom if ever a clerk in this Residency would apply for “ short leave .

Inter alia it was laid down that the leave allowances of such men during privilege leave whether taken by itself or in combination wi o er would be met from the Office allowance. Y on point out the administrative di - cnlties created by this ruling, which you say are accent aatcd by the tact that m computing your Office allow nee those charges were not taken into account ; and yon accordingly recommend that privilege leave allowances, when such leave is taken in combination with any other kind of leave, and provided the combined leave is for a period of not less than six months, shall be met from general revenues in tbe same manner as allowances during long leave. 2. Subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, the Government of India are pleased to accept your recommendation, on the under standing that the privilege leave allowance shall in no case exceed the salary on which the allowances admissible during other kind of leave are calculated, i.e., the salary which the officer concerned was drawing in his last pensionable appoint ment under Government.

The Most Honourable the MARQUIS of CREWE, K.G., Eis Majestifs Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 29th August 1912. U ! fi * My Lord Marquis, In paragraph 4 of the Secret Despatch from Lord Minto’s Government No. 160, dated the 17th November 1910 , Your Lordship was informed that Sir Percy Cox's proposals for effecting a reduction of expenditure in the Agencies and Consulates under the Bushire Residency were under consideration, and that the economies resulting therefrom were estimated at Rs. 67,509 a year. 2 As Your Lordship is aware*, we deputed Mr. J. B. Y ood, C.I.E., of our Pohtical Department, to visit the Persian * Telegram from the Secretary of State, dated in order to examine the question of the 19th February 1912. re( lnction of expenditure in these Consu- lates and Agencies, and to report on the feasibility of introducing a system of office allowances somewhat on the lines of that obtaining in the Consulates under the London Foreign Office. 3. We now enclose, for Your Lordship’s information, a copy of the final orders which we have issued as a result of these Letter No. 2085-Eat. A., dated the 6th July enquiries, together with a statement shewing 1912. their financial effect as compared with the sanctioned grants for the year 1910-11, which formed the basis of our original estimate. Your Lordship will observe that arrangements have been made to utilize the Bahrain launch to meet the requirements both of the Bahrain Agency and of the Bunder Abbas Consulate. Consequently the expenditure of Rs. 7,400 a year and Rs. 60,000 initial, which Your Lordship ■f Secretary of State's despatch, No. 101-Pol., sa nctionedf for the provision of a launch for dated the 4th September 1908. ^ Bunder ^bas Consulate, will not be incurred. The total saving effected by these orders may, therefore, be taken to beRs. 59 ,790+7,400= Rs. 67,190 a year. 4.

To Lieutenant-Colonel Sir PERCY COX, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Dated Simla, the 6th July 1912. Sir, I am directed to refer to your letter No. 2106, dated the 6th August 1910, regarding the reduction of expenditure in the Bushire Residency and subordinate offices. 2. I am, in the first place, to notice the following errors and omissions in the proposition ’and other statements accompanying your letter: Muscat. (a) The sanctioned pay. of the 2nd clerk is Rs. 120 and not Rs. 125 as shown • in the proposition statement. . ,b) The sanctioned grant for 1910-11 under the head “ Travelling allowance for Officers and Establishment is Rs. 1,250 and not Rs. 1,000 as shown in Statement B. . (c) The sanctioned grant of Rs. 800 under the head “ Medical and Hospital ' 7 Stores and Supplies ” has been omitted from Statement B. Koweit. The sanctioned pay of the Head Clerk is Rs 120-5-150 and not Rs. 100 io—150 as shown in the proposition statement. 3 I am to inform you that the Government of India approve generally of the proposals for reduction of expenditure submitted by you At the same time they iecoenise that in distant and isolated posts it is difficult, except at an exces sive cost to maintain a clerical establishment capable of deabrg with accounts blhe? f uthority petty alterations in the Consulate or Agency charges, which higher oUtnoiiiy j r 1lT1f i p^adient to -adopt. In pursuance of this it may Rom timejfco ti ^ n ^ w de cided, subject to the approval of His object the Governm , India and on the analogy of the system prevailing Majesty’s Secretary of State to la ^ at the disposal of each in Consulates under the Lomfcn Foreign Office, ^p^^ a p P tion of the Consul or Agent fixed hitherto met from separate fixed allotments, establishment a nd other , ch K ar ^, h from th e S e contract grants will be left entirely The details of the charges o e liberty to vary the scale of charges -Hi «* *» a. M- lng C (11 The annual grants must not be exceeded in any case, the Consul or Political ( } Agent concerned being held personally responsible for any excess. (21 All establishment paid from the office allowance or other contract ( ' grants will be non-pensionable, but special arrangements will be made, 255 FDas explained in paragraph 4 below to. protect, in certain cases, the interests of officers now holding pensionable appointments under (3) No officer will have the power to bind his successor to the scale of charges adopted by him. (4) No officer will draw more than one-fourth of the annual contract al- ( ) lowances, each quarter, without the specific orders of the Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf. (5) Each officer will render an account of his expenditure from the contract ( } allowances to the Political Resident m the Persian Gulf in such form and at such intervals, as the Resident may prescribe. The latter will inform the Camptroller, India Treasuries, of the amount passed by him from time to time, as regards each office ; and the Comptroller, India Treasuries, will ask for no further accounts of disbursements from the contract grants, and will content himself with seeing that the total grant is not exceeded. 161 The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf will have full powers of re- anpropriation of surrendered savings on contract grants, but the grant of each Consul or Political Agent will be diminished by such sur rendered savings, and he will be personally liable for any excess over the contract grant so diminished. The Resident will inform the Comptroller, India Treasuries, of any such reappropriations. (7) Unexpended balances of contract grants will lapse at the end of each (8) Except as provided in paragraph 4 below the leave rules in the Civil Service Regulations will not be applicable to any members of the establishment paid from the contract grants, but they will be entitled to such leave and such allowance as the Consul or Political Agent concerned may decide to grant. (9) Sale proceeds of old furniture and other Government property will not in future be credited to Government in the ordinary manner, but will be added to the amount of the office allowance at the disposal of the Political Agent or Consul concerned. A separate account should, however, be maintained of all amounts realised from the sale of durbar presents and submitted annually for the information of the Govern ment of India. (TO) The rules in Article 98 oithe Civil Account Code, Volume I, as regards contingent charges, will not be appliable to any purchases made- from the contract grants. (11) The cash in hand of each Consul or Political Agent will be limited to Tth of his sanctioned budget allotment. 4. With reference to conditions (2) and (8) referred to in paragraph 3 above, I am to explain that two classes of cases are likely to arise as regards the present incumbents of posts, which are now paid from general revenues and are pensionable, but which will hereafter be paid from the office or other contract allowance and will accordingly be non-pensionable, viz .:— (a) of men whose services will not be required in future by the Consul or Political Agent; and (b) of men whose services will be required in future by the Consul or Political Agent and who will be paid from the office allowance. (i) Cases falling under (a) should be dealt with under the rules in Section II of Chapter XVIII, Civil Service Regulations. (ii) As regards cases falling under (b), subject to the approval of the Secretary of State for India, the Government of India, are pleased to decide :(1) that all service paid from the office allowance will be treated as foreign service of the first kind in respect of which no contribu tion for leave allowancs and pension will be payable; and (2) that the officers concerned will continue to obtain leave under the Civil Service Regulations, subject to the discretionary control of the Consul or Political Agent. AJ1 allowances during privi lege leave whether taken by itself or in combination with other leave, will be met from the office allowance, while allowances during long leave will be met from general revenues, the rule in Article B35 (a), Civil Service Regulations, being relaxed for this purpose. Under the above rules, for the period during which an officer is paid from the office allowance, the calculation of bis emoluments counting towards pension will be based on the pay he was drawing immediately prior to bis transfer to the t/wcm-foreign service, following the rule in Articles 779 (b) and 754 (6) (ii), Civil Service Regulations, while his allowances during long leave will be similarly calculated. During privilege leave the Consul or Political Agent can give him any allowance be pleases, not less than the pay that he drew T m his last pensionable appointment under Covernment. If the officer is at a later date transferred to a pensionable post under Government he will simply be reverting from foreign service to Government service proper; and for the period during which he holds such pensionable post, the calculation of his emoluments for the purposes of leave allowances and pension will be based on the pay of the latter appointment. Should a Consul or Political Agent cease to require the services of an officer belonging to this class, he should give him three months’ notice of discharge, and at the same time advise the Government of India of his intention. If no suitable appointment in Government service can be provided for the officer he will be liable to be retired under the rules govering the grant of compensation pension. I am to request that you will furnish the Comptroller, India Treasuries, direct with a complete list of officers falling under this class. 5 In view of the peculiar conditions of service in the Persian Gulf, whe^e incumbents of the pensionable posts will ordinarily be recruited by selection from the non-pensionable establishment, the Government of India are pleased to grant a general exemption from the provisions of Article 478 (a), Civil Service Regula tions, to all non-gazetted establishments in the Bushire Residency and other sub ordinate offices in the Persian Gulf. * 6. In consequence of the introduction of the system described above, it has been decided to revise the various allotments for the Consulates and Agencies within your jurisdiction ; and the orders of the Government of India on each case are noted below. These orders are subject to the condition that the provision made in the office allowance of the different Agencies and Consulates for Care and Repair of Buildings,” though based on the sanctioned grants of previous years, must be regarded as tentative, and subject to revision as the result of the recom mendations, contained in your telegram No. 288, dated the 21st March 1912, and letter No. 630, dated the 24th March 1912.

The Shroff allowance of Rs. 25 a month paid to the Head Clerk for Treasury work will be abolished on the next change of incumbents. _ If it is found neces sary to continue it after that event, the Political Agent will be required to find the money from his office allowance. In this connection I am to request that the present arrangement under which the duties of Treasurer and Accountant of the Muscat Treasury are combined in the hands of the Head Clerk may be discontinued. The proper arrangement is, in the opinion of the Government of India, that the Head Clerk should be Ac countant and the 2nd Clerk Treasurer, or vice versa, as the Political Agent may decide. Pending consideration of the general proposals contained in your letter No. 630, dated the 24th Ma^chlQ^, the Government of India are unable to cancel the arrangements recently sanctioned under which the care and repair of all public buildings in Muscat have been entrusted to the Bombay Public Works Depart ment*Bahrain.

(c) It will be observed that your proposal to increase the pay of the Head Clerk to Rs. 170 a month has not been sanctioned. In the opinion of the Govern ment of India an incremental pay of Rs. 120—6—50 should be sufficient. V ith reference to paragraph 4 of Mr. Aood’s letter No. 6, dated the 21st March 1912, I am to explain that the Government of India consider it preferable to include the provision for the Second Clerk in the office allowance. (d) The Government of India approve of the suggestion that the Bahrain launch should be used to meet the requirements both of the Bahrain Agency and of the Bundar Abbas Consulate: the question of providing a separate launch for the latter station need not, therefore, be further considered. It is left to you to distribute the contract grant sanctioned to meet the charges on account of the launch between Bahrain and Bundar Abbas, should you consider desirable to do so. (e) These orders render unnecessary any further action with reference to the proposals contained in your letters Nos. 2064, 2405 and 3115 dated respec tively the 13th August, 16th September and 10th December 1911.

Foreign Office, Sir, 20th. January 1911. I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 16th and 21st ultimo relative to proposed reductions of expenditure on Consular establishments in Persia. I am to express to you Sir E. Grey’s satisfaction at the economies which it is intended to introduce under this head and his concurrence in the proposal of the Earl of Crewe to inform the Government of India that the reduced scale of charges is approved, and I am at the same time to suggest that further savings might properly be effected by the general adoption of the recommendations made by His Majesty’s Consul in Seistan in the fourth paragraph of his letter of 4th January 1910 to the Government of India, copy of which is enclosed in your letter of the 21st ultimo. Those recommendations appear to justify the practice followed at the posts which are officered from the Levant Consular Service. I am further to observe that in the letter of 20th February 1909 from this Office, in which Sir E. Grey’s views on this subject are fully set forth, the desirability of revising the distribution of Consular posts in Persia between the Levant Consular and Indian services is emphasised equally with the need for a reduction in the existing scale of charges connected with the latter of those services. Sir E. Grey observes, however, that in your two letters under reply only the second of these points is dealt with, and I am accordingly to express the hope that Lord Crewe will give his serious consideration also to the former point which, in Sir E. Grey’s view, is one of great importance. I am to add that the question of the amount to be contributed from Imperial services to the cost of the Intelligence Officer attached to Llis Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed, referred to in the penultimate paragraph of your letter of the 16th ultimo, is being considered and will form the subject of a subsequent communication. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State Louis Mallet. for India. Enclosure No. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, 25th February 1911. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 45,597, dated the 20th January 1911, regarding the reductions of expenditure that have been effected at His Majesty’s Consular establishments at Meshed, Turbat-i-Haidari, and Seistan. In your letter attention is drawn to the desirability ol the general adoption of recommendations made by His Majesty’s Consul in Seistan, in favour of a large reduction of the personnel attached to the Persian Consulates. As to this I am to observe that, in regard to Meshed and Turbat-i-Haidari, as well as Seistan itself, the recommendations have already been acted on, and it seems reasonable to suppose that the same course will be found to have been followed in regard to Bushire S. 58. B■ m ,l the Consulates in the Persian Gulf, when the further report of the Government of India regarding them has been received.

O'.auy obsertt!on re o£ P the Secretary of State for Affatrs wd be bo^ in mind when the report of the Government of India above reterrea to h^^irtfefence^to&amp;e remarks in the latter half, of your letter regaidiit the redistribution of Consular posts in Persia between the Levant and the Indian services, I am to say that the Lari of Creve has given this subject his most careful consideration and regrets that he is iinnblp to find himself in agreement with bir Urey. . In Sir C. Hardinge’s letter of 20th February 1909, stress is laid upon the effect of the Anglo-Russian Convention m this connection. W h e far from under-estimating the value of that instrument, Lord Crewe is not convinced bv recent Ivents that the time has yet come when Indian interests can be regarded as so securely established ms-a-ms of other Powers that any reasonable precautions can safely be neglected ; and die present moment, when the advent of German competition is threatened in regions which hitherto have largely been supplied 1^ India, and when the construction is contemplated of railwajs that w touch Indian interests in many vital points, would seem to him to be singularly inopportune for the withdrawal of Indian officers from any Dosts within the British sphere. . . . As regards Bagdad, I am to say that m view of the present impossi bility of obtaining for British Indians, even with an Indian officer as Consul-General and Political Resident, the protection enjoyed elsewhere by British subjects, Lord Crewe could not contemplate with equanimity the substitution of an officer of the Levant Service, who, whatever his merits, would, from his experience and training, possess no experience of Indian feelings and customs, while the policy recently followed by His Majesty’s Consul at Basra, of which Sir E. Grey found it necessary to express his disapproval, in connection with Mohammera, furnishes an example of the extent to which even an experienced and able officer ot that service may fail to appreciate the wider interests of India and Great Britain in the Persian Gulf. Whether purely British interests would, in the present state of our relations with Turkey, he any better served by a reduction in the establishment of His Majesty’s represen tative at Bagdad is not a question for the Secretary of State for India. But I am to invite attention to the letters on this subject from successive Consuls-General which are already in the posseesion of your Depart ment, and to the information recorded in Mr. Lorimer’s summary for April-May Section IX (7) to the effect that Nazim Pasha had complained to the Turkish Government of the size of the British Residency, and and had recommended that steps be taken to obtain the abolition of the British post office and the removal of the Residency Guard and of the R.I.M.S. Comet. As regards the incidence of expenditure at Bagdad {vide ante penultimate paragraph of Sir Charles Hardinge’s letter above quoted) I am to enclose a memorandum from which it will be seen that, despite the intention of the Agreement of 1900, the effect of that instrument has been to throw on Indian revenues in respect of Persia and Turkish Arabia an excess charge which more than covers the expenditure on the Bagdad Residency. While, therefore, Lord Crewe is not less anxious than Sir E. Grey to reduce expenditure, he is strongly of opinion that in the present conflict of international interests in the middle East this cannot be regarded as the paramount consideration. I have, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, R- Ritchie. Foreign Office.s ^ Annex. Memorandum. It lias recently been brought to notice that, owing to causes which it is perhaps unnecessary to discuss in this connection, the Agreement of 1900, which was intended to equalise diplomatic and consular expendi ture in Persia and Turkish Arabia as between England and India, left India as a matter of fact to bear unaded a considerable portion of that expenditure. That this is the case can be seen from the following statement of payments and receipts of the two Governments in respect of 1907-08, the latest year in respect of which the accounts have been finally adjusted :— India. Persia :— Outlay in Persia Add contribution to Foreign Office in respect of Persia in 1907-08 Deduct refund by Foreign Office in 1909-10 Turkish Arabia:— Outlay in Turkish Arabia (not including Koweit) - Add contribution to Foreign Office in 1907-08 in in respect of Basra Deduct refund by Foreign Office in 1909-10 in respect of Mr. Gaskin £ 66,832 487 67,319 16,818 5,634 1,400 7,034 43 £ 50,501 Total net expenditure in Persia and Turkish Arabia - - - 6,991 57,492 Foreign Office.

While far from under-estimating the value of that instrument Lord Crewe is not convinced by recent events that the time has yet come when Indian interests can be regarded as so securely established vis a vis of other Powers that any reasonable precautions can safely be neglected; and the present moment^when the i advent of German competition is threatened in regions which hitherto have largely been supplied by India, and when the construction is con templated of railways that will touch Indian interests in many vital points - would seem to him to be i singularlysingularly inopportune for the withdrawal of Indian off icers. from any posts within the British sphere* Indians^, even with an Indian officer as Consul-General and Political Resident, the protection enjoyed elsewhere by British subjects^Lord Crewe could not contemplate with equanimity the substitution of an officer of the Levant Service t who - \d by H.M.Consul at Basra - of which Sir R.Grey found it necessary to express h is disapproval - in con nexion with Mohammera } furnishes an example of the extent to which even an experienced and able officer of that service may fail to in the establishment of H.M.repre sentative at Bagdad is not a question for the S.of S. for India.

What has teen discovered since that letter ijoas written is that - despite this fact,and despite the intention of the Welhy Commission that Diplomatic and Consular expenditure on the Persian Mission and certain minor Consulates (which included Turkish Arabia) should be equally shared between the two G-ovemments - the effect of their actual recommendation (i.e. that the contribution of £7000 a year previously paid by this Office to the Foreign Office should be reduced to £2000 a year) was to leave this Office to bear unaided a considerable portion of the total expenditure. The explanation of this paradox is as follows:- (1) In his answer to Q Q, 12413-4 put by the Welby Commission Sir H. Waterfield submitted a +• statement (printed at pp.413-4 vol. 11 of the Report) shewing:- 1 .O' A ^ X. Average expenditure by Foreign Office on diplomatic and consular services in Persia and Turkish Aiubia in 1893-4, 1894-5, and 1895-6 . lf&lt; do. by Indiaybut including an annual contribution of £7,000 to Foreign Office ... £. 21,825 30,522 Sir H. Waterfield remarked that as the Foreign Office was receiving £7000 a year from the India Office their gross expenditure must be reduced by that amount to arrive at their correct outlay. But in reply to a later question (Q Q. 14986-7) Sir H. Waterfield seems to have overlooked the fact that £7000 a year ought to be deducted from the gross outlay of the Foreign Office to arrive at their net outlay. For he stated that in order to divide expenditure equally between the Foreign Office and the India Office the contribution of £7000 a year should be reduced to about £2,650. The process by which he arrived at this figure was plainly as follows*- IndiaIndia Office expenditure (including contribution of £7000 to Foreign Office)... Fo re ign lexp enditure (neglecting receipt from India Office) Excess of Indian expenditure £ * ... 30,522 ... 21,825. 8,697. half of this 4,348. and deducting this sum from £7000 the reminder is £2,652. It will be seen that, if the £7000 contributed by the India Office had been deducted from the gross Foreign Office outlay, the result would have been very different. The calculation would then have been : • • • • • • f j Indian expenditure Foreign Office expenditure :- (£21,825 ~ 7000=J f » Excess expenditure by India Half this excessttt: 1 converted into a„Qantrihu£ianJ:rQjn^tbaJ!l&amp;e£im~Qf£lG-Z+ to Ind ia of £848, A further correction necessary to equalise expenditure toas the omission from the Foreign Office figures of annual expenditure in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission (para, 246 of their *r Report) of a sum of £833 included on account of the M Karun River Subsidy, The Committee* recommended that the Basra-Baghdad subsidy paid by India should be regarded as the equivalent of the Karun Subsidy paid by the Foreign Office* Sir Hy. Waterfield was not of course responsible for the omission of this further correction. With this correction it will be seen A. that the expenditure met by India was greater than that met by the Foreign Office by £16,530 (£15,697, as above + £833), and that, to equalise matters^our contribution of £7000 a year to the Foreign Office ought to have been reduced by £ = £8,2o5 (i.e. turned into a contribution by to£1,265) Ap a matter of fact the Royal Commission 2t + L ' (// recommended a reduction (by £5000 or £3,265 short of i^r /hs.u^ — A tfSzr Ajx^ £ (.0, t( h Sf^r'foo what the reduction should have been, and India was thus left to bear alone an annual expenditure of £2 X-3265 - £6530 (besides being required, under the terms of the 7 India was also required under the ) settlement of 1900, to Agreement of 1900 to contribute ) £1400 a year for Basra, but on the ) other hand, in the interval Joetween f he j pay £400 a year separately x on account of Kerman) &gt; over by the Foreign Office. j (2) Further y in the interval between the period covered by the figures given by Sir H. Waterfield and | September 1900, the date of the Agreement which followed on the Report of the Welhy Commission, the expenditure of the Government of India had risen considerably while that of the Foreign Office had remained practically stationary. The figures are as fol1ows :- India1 India ' r itUAevej(t'Y u ' € ~' ^ _Xc £ £ ...

Add net expenditure in Turkish Arabia shown in Foreign Office Estimates for 1899-1900 and 1900—01 (see Ests. for 1900-01, pp.437, 449)No credit in respect of this relatively increased outlay was given to India in the settlement of 1900. Thus in addition to the £6530 + 400 mentioned above India was left to bear unaided a further sum of £6645 (6738 - 93) or, in all, £13.575. this original disparity was subsequently reduced' to attached to the present draft letter to the Foreign Office it was £9,568. The details given in that %/ p “ t V Memorandum show that our expenditure in Turkish Arabia came to £6,991 while that of the Foreign Office was only £175 net. Accordingly, it seems quite reasonable to say that, in effect, the whole of the expenditure in Turkish Arabia is borne by India. Chwing to causes which are somewhat obscure about £10,000.

On the Mission being “ in 1859 again transferred to the 1 oreign Office, Lord “ John Bussell refused to revise the agreement; and “ thus it became recognised that India should pay “ i- 2 -ths of the cost, subject to a maximum of 12,000b a “ year In 1871, the Select Committee on Diplomatic “ and Consular Services recommended that the pro- “ portion paid by India should be reduced as it nad » been found that, out of an average of IM^Ca “ vear, the Imperial Government had paid only 3,12A- “ Correspondence ensued; and at en fQQo t^fO000Z “ charge against India was reduced in 1880 to 10.000-., “ and in 1891 to 7,000L till the 31st March, 1901.

I am afraid that from these two accounts we shall get into rather a barren controversy ; do you not think it would be possible for us to come to some agreement upon them ? I ought to point out to you that these figures, as given by the Treasury, were for 1891, whereas you are dealing ivith 1886. I gathered from the figures you ga\ e that it was at a time when India was paying 10,000?. ?—That is so. 1 have the figures for India tor a later period ; but it is the English part that I feel so uncertain about. The Indian figures have risen largely under Khorassan ; otherwise thej- are much the same, and India is now paying Bupees 3,94,696—that is to say, she was in 1893-4. It has again increased since that. Converting that at the rate of exchange of Is. 2fcZ. which was the official rate of that year, India was paying in English money 24,257?., to which must be added the English payment of &lt; ,000?., which would bring her payments up to 31,257?.; and, as far as I can judge from the English estimates, the total charge for the Legation was 12,170?., of which India contributed 7,000?., so that the net charge on the United Kingdom would be 5,170?. No doubt that must be increased by an estimate for non-effective charges, and very possibly there may be something to add foi establishment; that I suppose the Foreign Office would lie able to tell us. I should have to apply to them to know what they consider the cost;_ but on the figures that I made out, I think that India is paying inore than 85 per cent., whereas under the proportion of 12 to 5 she ought only to be paying 70^ per cent. 12 407. This account which I have before me, which comes from the Treasury, comes to a very different result, because it gives three-fifths to India and two- fifths to the United Kingdom, whereas your account toves four-fifths to India and one-fifth to the United Kingdom?— Yes, it is very different. 12 408 You have given me a paper which I think state’s shortly what the point is to which the Indian Government would wish to draiv the attention of the Commission, in order that we may express our opinion asTthe figure of apportionment ?-Yes. It is simply whether or not the 7,003?. is an unduly large proportion of the total charges. , . „ 12 409 (Mr. Courtney.)

The average payments of the last three years have been 2L824hbytke Foreign Office, or 41-7 per cent., and by the India Office, or 58*3 per cent.

Since 1863 the Government of India have paid a subsidy for the carriage of mails between Bussorah and Baghdad. The subsidy is Bs. 24,000 for a weekly service. The Indian Post Office does not require a weekly service, but the Government of India are willing, Sir H. Waterfield says, to pay the subsidy in consideration of the large p 37 ^ ard Indian native community resident at Baghdad. The British Post Office does not think 49, p. 375. a subsidy necessary. In 1888 the Persian Government opened the River Karun up to Ahwaz. Messrs. Lynch placed steamboats on the river, and in 1890 they obtained a subsidy from the British Government amounting to 2,000/. a year, to which it was agreed that India should contribute a moiety ; but the Government of India consider that India has not the same interest in the navigation of the Karun as she has in that of the Tigris^ It is extremely difficult to appraise the respective interests of Great Britain and India in these subsidised services. It is admitted that each has an interest, political as well as commercial, in those regions, and probably the equity of the case would be met by dividing them. If India maintains the Bussorah Baghdad service, Gieat Britain might maintain the Karun service^V nr,; U/^ 3ff?- ***** jUU S'. 0. Qq. 12,308 ct seq. Appendices Vol. 1L, 'N'os. 48, iO p- ^ 85, (c.) The Persian Mission. 242. The Persian Mission was established in 1810, and was maintained at the charge of G-reat Britain until 1823, when it was transferred to India. Prom 1823 to 1831 'it was wholly supported from Indian funds. In 1835 it was re-transferred to the British Poreign Office, the Indian Government contributing 12,000/. a year towards its cost. In 1859 another change was made, and the Mission and the Consulates at Tehran, Tabriz, and llesht, were placed under the Government of India. The cost of the Mission was then estimated at 15,000/. a year, towards which Great Britain paid 3,0001. and 2,000/. on account of the Consulates. In I860 the Mission and the Consulates were re-transferred to the British Poreign Office, and from. 1860-1 to 1879-80 India contributed 12,000/. towards the Mission, leaving the Consulates at the sole charge of Great Britain. In 1880, on the recommendation of the Select Committee which inquired, in 1871, into Diplomatic and Consular Establishments, the Indian contribution to the Mission was reduced to 10,000/., and that rate was paid till 1890-1. In 1891 it was decided at the Poreign Office Conference, which, under the presidency of Lord Salisbury, examined various questions at issue between the two Governments, to reduce the contribution to 7,000/. The Treasury consider that contribution too small, and the Indian Government consider it too great. The Treasury has made a calculation of the charges incurred by India and Great Britain respectively for the Mission and the Consulates in Persia, including the telegraphic establishments, but exclusive of the subsidies to steam service on the Tigris and Karun. They estimate the Indian charge in 1891 at 24,600/. and the British charge at 16,400/. Sir H. Waterheld states the average expenditure of India on the Persian Q. 14,986 Mission and Consulates during the three years 1893-4, 1894-5, 1895-6, at 30,522/.; of Great Britain at 21,824 /. The two Governments are not agreed as to the extent of their respective interests in Persia. It is, in our opinion, desirable to adopt a general principle of division which will put an end to these discussions. Both countries have admittedly a large interest in Persia, and we think that the charges of the Mission and Consulates should be evenly divided between the two countries. We think, also, that the British Foreign Office should not create or add to the establishments and services under its control without the consent of the Government of India, and vice versa, that the Government of India should not add to the establishments and services under their control without the consent of the Foreign Office. Lastly, the charge as made up for division should be complete, including outfits, pensions, aud all contingencies, to which the Government of India sometimes demurs. aragrapl?^ ' The Persian Mission .—We have recommended that the charges of the Legation and t2&gt; Consulates in Persia should be evenly divided between the United Kingdom and India; that no addition should be made to those charges without the assent of the two Governments; and that the charge in each case should be complete, covering outfits, pensions, and contingencies. 364.

The total cost of the proposal of the Government of India is 2,6131. per annum, as compared with an annual expenditure during Major Sykes’incumbency of the post, which is believed to have amounted to about 1,200/. In future it is proposed that the expense (2,613/.) should be borne in equal shares by Imperial and Indian revenues, account being taken of the annual contribution from Indian revenues of 400/. a year, which is included in the Indian contribution towards the Diplomatic and Consular expenses in Persia and elsewhere.The Secretary of State in Council will be glndto be informed whether the proposal of the Government of India is accepted in principle by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and hy the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury. If so, the details might be arranged in connection with the settlement of charges, which is apparently con templated by the Lords Commissioners in their letter to the Foreign t See Enclosure No. 5 in Secret De spatch to India, No. 29 of 13th September 1901.

I laid before the Marquess of Lansdowne your letter of the Sth ultimo relative to a proposal of the Government of India that a permanent British Consulate should be established at Kerman in Persia. Lord Lansdowne approves the proposal in principle and considers the establishment of this Consulate to be very desirable on political grounds. His Lordship has accordingly recommended the suggested arrange ment to the favourable consideration of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. . A letter has now been received from the Treasury sanctioning the establishment of a permanent British Consulate at Kerman at a total cost of two thousand six hundred and thirteen pounds (2,613Z.) a year, to be divided equally between the Imperial Government and the Government of India. . . The Treasury propose to address a further communication to this Department as to the method of giving effect to the apportionment of cost between the two Governments.

Treasury Chambers, g- r 6th September J 902. Adverting to the last paragraph of the Treasury letter (12531) of the 13th ultimo, I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury to request you to lay before the Marquess of Lansdowne tbe following expression of their views as to the method of giving effect to the apportionment of cost of the ie\iscd arrange ments for the Kerman Consulate between the British and Indian Governments. As it was settled two years ago that a contribution of 6,000/. should represent India’s share of the expenses of the Persian Mission and the Minor Consulates (which included Kerman), the only point that needs to he taken into consideration now is the apportionment of the increased charge in respect of this Consulate. The future cost of the establishment being 2,613/., and the present expenditure amounting to 1,973/., the diderence of 640/. represents the total additional cost which has to be taken into account as affecting the two Governments under tbe new arrangements. Half (320/.) of this latter sum represents the increased cost which will fall on the Diplo matic and Consular Services Vote, which already bears an expenditure of 1,212/. per annum for this Consulate ; and consequently a total sum of 1,532/. per annum represents the contribution which should be made to Indian revenues when tbe whole charge of the Consulate is taken over by the Government of India. My Lords agree in the principle which commends itself to the Eoreign Office and India Office, viz., that this sum (1,532/. ) will most conveniently be brought to account by reducing the Indian contribution from 6,000/. to 4,468/. per annum as from the date on which Indian revenues assume the whole charge. The Under Secretary of State, I am, &amp;c., E. W. Hamilton. Eoreign Office.of 'ivin^ effect to t!ie apportionment between the British aod Indian Governments of the cost of the Kerman Consulate. 2. In reply I am to say that his Lordship in Council accepts the principle that under the Agreement of September 1900 the payment by India to the Imperial Exchequer of 6,000/.. in addition to the charges at that time defrayed out of Indian revenues, must he regarded as India’s share of the expenses of the Persian Mission and the minor Consulates, as they then stood. His Lordship, however, cannot accept the view of the Lords Commissioners that the amount to he credited to Indian revenues on account of the re-arrangements regarding the Kerman Consulate is represented by a reduction of 1,532/. in the Indian contribution to the Consular and Diplomatic Vote. The salary (761/.) of Major Phillott, the present temporary incumbent, is an item of expenditure incurred subsequently to the date of the Agreement, and must, therefore, for the purposes of this calculation, be regarded as a part of the additional expenditure which should be borne in equal shares by the British and Indian Governments. The account would, therefore, stand as follows : — £ Future cost - - - - 2,613 Cost before Major Phillott’s temporary appointment - 1,212 Difference - - 1,401 which sum, in his Lordship’s view, and not 610/., represents the total additional cost which has now to be taken into account. The deduction to be made from the Indian contribution would, therefore, appear to be 1,212(. + ' j’ 1 = 1,912/. 10s. 3. His Lordship in Council infers from Sir E. Hamilton’s letter that the Lords Commissioners do not now propose to pursue the investi gation as to the proportion in which the total effective cost of Diplomatic and Consular Services in Persia is at present defrayed by India and the United Kingdom respectively, which they appeared to contemplate in their letter 'to the Foreign Office of the 8th August 1901. His Lordship would, however, be glad to be furnished with a copy of the statement which has been furnished by the Foreign Office to their Lordships in compliance with their request. 4. In the meantime I am to point out that there have been several items of expenditure in connection with the Persian Consular Service which have recently been incurred by the Government of India after consultation with ‘the Foreign Office. These items concern (l) the Seistan Consulate and the reduction in the Khorassan establishment, (2) the Bunder Abbas Yice-Consulate, (3) the Military Attache at Shiraz; the aggregate total cost of which has, in the two former cases, hitherto been borne exclusively by Indian revenues, the latter being an entirely new appointment. 5. As regards Seistan, the letter from this Office of 20th March 1900 informed you of the general arrangements which the Government of India then contemplated, and Lord Salisbury’s concurrence was intimated in vour reply of the 29th of March. But, as you are aware from the letter from this Office of the 19th of October 1900, the proposal for a permanent appointment at Seistan was not sanctioned till that month. The final scheme of the Government of India for the establishment in Seistan has not yet reached this Office. When it is received, it will, as was mentioned in my letter of the 26th of November 1901, be forwarded to the Foreign Office. 12539.

In addition to the recurring charges re ! ult y^ from^ndfat revenues, ^lAiuMing^te^th^BiTsldre?Baghdad?and Seistan Consulates, a sum which may he roughly taken at 7,00 )/. 9 It appears to Lord George Hamilton that it is desirable to make as soon as possible the further adjustments that are necessary, under the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Indian Expenditme, in respect of such of these additional charges as have been mcur,ed since the™agreement mentioned in the second paragraph of this letter. At the sam? time, the question of the continuance of the contribution towards the cost of the Consular guards at Ispahan, which this Office has provisionally undertaken to make, might he definitely settled. 10 When an agreement has been reached regarding the particular charges now under consideration, any later adjustment on account ot further changes in establishments m Persia could be easily made ,,s occasion arises. 11. On learning that Lord Lansdowne shares his views as to the pro cedure to he adopted, Lord George Hamilton will instruct the Governmen of India to furnish accurate information regarding the additional expenditure incurred since September 1900 for the services mentioned in paiagraphs 4 to 8 of this letter. , 1 iiave, etc., The Under Secretary of State, A.

I am also to enclose a statement of the effective cost of the Diplomatic and Consular establishments in Persia to the Imperial Exchequer. The statement supplied by the India Office, according to v/hich the estimated expenditure for 1901-02 amounts to 35,899ib, in addition to the consolidated contribution of 6,000£. paid to the Imperial Govern ment, includes charges incurred in Turkish Arabia which should , presumably, be withdrawn! They are as follows :— at Is. 4&lt;d. = 9,109Z. The total estimated charge would thus be reduced from 35,899/. to 26,790/., apart from the contribution of 6,000/. As the statement of expenses paid from Imperial funds, amounting to 22,459/., does not include non-effective charges, the items under the head “ superannuation ” in the Indian Statement should likewise be withdrawn for purposes of comparison. It should also be noted that certain extraordinary expenses' in connection with Persia, such as the cost of the Shah’s visit to England in July next, which will probably amount to 5,000/. or 6,000/., are borne by the Imperial Exchequer. In the statement supplied by the India Office the whole of the consolidated contribution of 6,000/. from India has been taken as part of the expenses in Persia. It appears, however, from the correspondence between this Department and the Treasury, ending with your letter No. 16,959 of the 18th of October 1900, that of this sum only 2,400/. have any connection with Persia; 400/. are for the Consulate at Kerman, and 2,000/. represent the remainder of the contribution formerly paid from Indian funds, viz., 12,500/. for China, and 7,000/. for Persia.

Ford Lansdowne sees no ground for disputing this contention, and 1 am to inquire whether the Lords of the Treasury are prepared to accept the reduction of the contribution from the Government of India by the amount now suggested.

This arrangement furnishes a simple basis for calculating the additional expenses to be borne—on the principle of half and half payments—by this country and by India accordingly in respect of new charges incurred by either country since the date of the 1900 Agreement. My Lords await a further communication as regards the other details referred to in the India Office letter of the 5th ultimo; but they may add that the result of any further modifications should be shown in the Estimate for Diplomatic and Consular Services as a net addition to, or deduction from, the sum of 6,000/. per annum as modified by the Kerman deduction above.

Treasury Chambers, 1st January 1903, Sir, In reply to Mr. Villiers’ letter of the 4th ultimo, I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury to state, for the information of the Marquess of Lansdowne, that they approve the proposal of the Secretary of State for India in Council to increase the sumptuary allowance payable to the Consul-G-eneral at Meshed, when his total emoluments fall short of Its. 2. 150 a month by such amount as may be necessary to bring them up to that sum, and that they agree that a moiety of the additional cost should be taken into account in calculating the India contribution to the expenses of Consular services in India My Lords note, however, that this increase, as well as that of 11s. 200 a month for an allowance to the Agency Surgeon, approved by their letter of the 27th ultimo, is directly attributable to economies recently effected in the Consular establishment; and they presume that Imperial funds will be benefited by these economies (so far as they are subsequent in date to the arrangement of 1900) by the addition to the Indian con tribution of half the saving effected. Otherwise, the temporary discontinuance of a charge borne under the arrangement, upon Indian revenues, would have the effect of transferring a moiety thereof, upon its restoration to Imperial funds—a result which would clearly be inequitable. As regards reductions effected before 1900, which have subsequently to be replaced, the case is more difficult, but in order not in any way to disturb the finality of the arrangement, my Lords will be content to regard all net increases since that date, whatever may be the previous history of the establishments in which they occur, as new charges to which the British Exchequer should properly contribute. The same principles should of course be applied to increases and decreases in the cost of establishments borne on the Diplomatic and Consular Services Vote, to which India contributes. As the recent changes in. the Meshed Consulate appear to Imve been numerous, my Lords would be glad to be furnished with a statement showing the increases and decreases which have taken place since the 1900 arrangement, and the net effect upon the amount of the Indian contribution. It would be convenient if this statement accompanied the Estimate for Diplomatic and Consular Services, 1903-04, and embraced all the changes both on the Imperial, and on the Indian side which result in the net figure shown in the Estimate as India’s contribution towards the cost of the Persian Mission and Minor Consulates. I am further to suggest that a similar statement should accompany the Estimate for future years, and that, unless objection is seen thereto, the net difference in annual rates should take effect as from 1st April following, in the accounts between the two Governments. /The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.

No. 1. India Office to Treasury. F. 3418. 17th July 1900. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to draw the attention of the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury to the proposals of the Royal Commission on Indian Expenditure, regarding the apportionment of charge between the Governments of the United Kingdom and of India for purposes in which both are interested. According to paragraph 364 of the Report of the Commission, the total amount of the annual charges to be transferred from the revenues of India to those of the United Kingdom would be approximately 293,000/. ; but this includes a sum of 108,000/. sterling as one half of the military charges for Aden, which should have been stated as 108,000 tens of rupees, so that a reduction of 36,000/. must be made. The total amount of the relief which India would receive, if all the recommendations of the Commission were adopted, would therefore be, not 293,000/., but 257,000/. a year. I am desired to express Lord George Hamilton’s confident hope that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury will accept the unanimous opinion of the Commission, in so far as it is in favour of relieving the revenues of India to that extent. As regards the heads under which the relief should be given, 1 am directed to make the following suggestions. It appears to Lord George Hamilton that this opportunity might with advantage be taken to put an end to certain minor pay ments that are now made by India, and thus to simplify the accounts between the two Governments. At present the Secretary of State in Council pays 75 OOO/. a year on account of the Mission to the Court of Persia, 12,500/. a year for Her Majesty’s Establishments in China, and 1,787/. as contributions towards the expenses of the Jeddah, Momein, and Busreh Consulates, making a total of 21,287/. for political charges. He also pays a subsidy of 10,000/. a year to the Eastern Telegraph Company on account of the Zanzibar-Mauritius cable. I am to suggest that for the future all these contributions might be foregone by the Imperial Government. His Lordship assumes that 130,000/. will be allowed as half the cost of the transport of troops to and from India, and will be defrayed by the Imperial Government, in accordance with the proposals of the Commissiou. With respect to the Military Charges for Aden, Lord George Hamilton desires me to suggest that the sum to be granted from Imperial revenues might equitably be fixed at 100 , 000 /. a year, being slightly in excess of the share which the Commissioners considered that the Imperial Government should bear, but on the other hand somewhat less than the sum (108,000/.) by which they apparently intended that India should benefit under this head. If these suggestions are accepted by the Lords Commissioners, the total amount of relief to be received by India will be 261,287/.* a year, and Lord George Hamilton is prepared to accept that sum as satisfying the equitable claims of India under existing circumstances in respect of the subjects re- Total . . - £261,287 ferred to the Royal Commission. * Political charges Telegraph subsidy Transport, moiety Share of Aden expenses £ 21,287 10,000 130.000 100.000 1 have, &amp;c.

The Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury have carefully considered, in communication with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for War, your letter of the 17th July 1900, relative to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Indian Expenditure in favour of the transfer of certain annual charges from the revenues of India to those of the United Kingdom ; and I am directed to request that you will submit to the Secretary of State for India in Council the following reply. After the necessary correction of the figure given by the Royal Commission for half the military charges for Aden, their recommendations are that the following grants be made by the Imperial Government to India: — £ In aid of the charge for the India Office - - - 50,000 Half the military charges for Aden - - - - 72,000 Jncreased contribution to the charge of the Persian Mission - 5.000 Half the cost”oFtT7eTransport of trobps to and from ImSaT - 130,006 Total - - 257,000 The modification of these proposals suggested in your letter under reply consists in the substitution, for the direct contribution in aid of the charge for the India Office, and for the 5,000/. increase of contribution to the Persian Mission, of the following: — sB £ Additional grant in respect of the military charges for Aden (making the total 100,000/.) - _ _ 28,000 The waiver by the Imperial Government of certain minor payments now made annually by India:— 1. Subsidy to the Eastern Telegraph Company on account of the Zanzibar-Mauritius Cable - - 10,000 2. Persian Mission ------ 7,000 3. Establishments in China - - - 12,500 4. Consulates at Jeddah, Momein, and Basra - - 1,787 31,287 Total - * - 59,287 This sura, together with 72,000/. representing half the military charges for Aden and 130,000/. representing half the cost of transport of troops, makes up a total of 261,287/., as compared with the 257,000/. recommended by the Royal Commission, beyond which my Lords are not prepared to increase materially the contribution from Imperial Funds. With reference to the above proposals, the Secretary of State for War informs my Lords that he is prepared to make an annual contribution from Army Funds, towards the cost of the transport of troops and towards the military charges for Aden, of 230,000/., to commence as from 1st April 1901. His Lordship, however, points out that the Royal Commission recommended that the capitation rate, which forms the basis of the contri bution paid by India for Home Effective Charges, should be revised in five or six years, and he proposes therefore that the contribution of 230,000/. should remain in force for a similar period. My Lords concur in this proposal. There remains to be considered the suggestion that the Imperial Government should forego the payments now made by India to the extent of 31,287/. per annum, as set out above. My Lords fully share the opinion of the Secretary of State in Council that it is desirable to take the opportunity of putting an end to these payments, so far as circum stances justify, with a view to simplifying to that extent the accounts between the two Governments; and, for their part, they readily agree to give up the Indian contribution of 10,000/. per annum towards the subsidy for the Zinz : bar-Mauritius cable. 387 .—Sess. 2 . A 3As regards the other payments by India winch are now appropriated m a.d of the Diplomatic and Consular Vote, the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs hat expressed his views in a letter dated the 11th ultimo, of which I am to enclose a copy It will be seen that the Marquess of Salisbury is prepared to forego the following sums :— For establishments in China - - - ' ' For the Persian Mission (the sum recommended by the Koyal Commission) £ 12.500 5,000 17.500 2 000/. per annum would thus continue to be payable by India in respect of the t^oy»ciqti Mission The Foreign'office letter points out that 1,787/. does not correctly represent the existina . contributions for Jeddah, Momein, and Basra Consulates, which should be 2 664/ per annum and suggests that India should continue to pay a lump sum of 6,0001. (to include the remaining 2,000/. in respect of the Persian Mission, and the present con tributions (a) for the Consulates at Jeddah, Momein, and Basra, and (o) for the Consulates at Kerman and Chiengmai). My Lords concur in this suggestion, which would have the result of making the total concession to India about 500/. more than the 257 000/. per annum recommended by the Royal Commission. My Lords trust that the Secretary of State in Council will be able to accept the above proposals as satisfying the equitable claims of India, under existing circumstances, in respect of the subjects referred to the Royal Commission. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) E. W. Hamilton Enclosure in No. 5. Foreign Office to Treasury. llth August 1900. The Marquess of Salisbury has given careful consideration to your letter of the 26th ultimo, and to the proposals of the Secretary of State for India with regard to the withdrawal of certain contributions hitherto made from Indian funds towards Her Majesty’s Diplomatic and Consular Establishments in China, Persia, and Turkey. I am directed by his Lordship to state that, in view of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Indian Expenditure, he is prepared to accept the arrangement as modified by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, viz., that the contribution of 12,500/. towards the establishments in China should no longer appear as an appro priation-in-aid of the Diplomatic and Consular Vote, and thac the 7,000/. now furnished by India towards Imperial expenditure in Persia should be reduced by 5,000/. With regard to the payments for the maintenance of Her Majesty’s Consulates at Jeddah, Momein, and Basra, 1 am to observe that the sum of 1,787/. does not correctly represent the amounts supplied by India for that purpose. The figures appear to have been taken from the Appropriation Account for 1898-99, which, amongst other things, only included a half-year’s contribution in the case of Basra. The items now stand as follows:— For Jeddah „ Momein - „ Basra £ 790 474 (maximum) 1,400 £2,664A 4 / I am also to point out that contributions have hitherto been towards the expenses of two other consulates, viz.:— For Kerman ------ „ Chiengmai - - - - received from India £ 400 (maximum) 1,000 1,400 Lord Salisbury entirely concurs in Lord George Hamilton’s view that it is very desirable to put an end to the minor payments which are now made by India, and thus to simplify the accounts between the two Governments, and he gathers from the expressions contained in your letter that the Lords of the Treasury are of the same opinion. The periodical revision of these assessments gives rise to some inconvenience, and to much lengthy correspondence. If the Secretary of State is asked to forego so large a sum as 17,500/. for the benefit of the Indian Exchequer, there seems to be no sufficient reason for disputing the exact figures at which the half share to be borne by India on account of each individual consulate should from time to time be fixed. Moreover, these special payments are apt to attract attention, and to give rise to adverse comment and criticism, relating as they do to places affected by so many diverse political considera tions, and situated so far apart on the Red Sea and the Shatt-el-Arab and in remote provinces of Persia, China, and Siam. It appears to his Lordship that the desired simplification of accounts can best be effected by merging the smaller payments in one general contribution, which, however much reduced, might still be regarded as a share of the Imperial expenditure in China, Persia, and Siam. I am therefore to suggest, for their Lordships’ consideration, that the Government of India should for the future contribute 6,000/. per annum to the Diplomatic and Consular Vote, this sum being arrived at approximately as follows:— Remnant of general contribution for Persia Existing contributions for Jeddah „ „ „ Momein - „ „ Kerman „ Chiengmai The total amount at present paid from Indian revenues is 23,564/., and the saving to India by reducing this sum to 6,000/. is 17,564/., as compared with 17,500/., the figure mentioned in your letter.

My Lord, In your predecessor’s Secret despatch No. 15, dated the 25th June 1909, Lord Morley invited our attention to a suggestion made by His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that expenditure on Seistan should be reduced forthwith by one-half, and he requested us to consider what material reductions could be immediately effected.

It will he perceived from the statement accompanying our letter to the Consul, No. 3151 Est. A., dated the 10th October 1910, that the effect of our orders is a reduction of approximately Rs. 42,000 in the annual budget allotment for the Consulate. This reduction will be further increased later by the abolition of the Vice-Consulate at Koh-i-Malik Siah, which will be effected as soon as provision can be made for the present incumbent, and by other economies which are still under consideration.

From— Major W. F. (VConnor, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Seistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In reference to the correspondence regarding the proposed reductions in the cost of the Seistan Consulate, I have the honour to forward herewith revised proposals as indicated in paragraph 3 of my letter to you No. K.-100, dated 14th September 1909. These proposals as you will observe are substantially the same as those put forward in my first letter on the subject quoted above, and involve a reduction of Us. 37,345. Further acquaintance with the conditions, political and other wise, prevailing in Seistan and the Kainat has, however, as I had anticipated caused me to modify to some extent my first opinions and has led to several changes in detail. The majority of these are unimportant and require no special explanation except such as is given in the “Explanatory Notes” attached to the enclosed Table of figures. I have withdrawn, for instance, my proposals for modifications in the present office staff which are at present unnecessary and undesirable; as also those for the abolition of the Hospital Assistant at Birjand and the reduction of the pay of the Hospital Assistant at Seistan, neither of which I would now recommend. Whilst on the other hand I have proposed a still larger decrease in the numbers of the Escort here and of the Levy establishment. Such increases as I have proposed in the establishment have been explained elsewhere; but in further justification of these I would point out that I am proposing a total reduction of the personnel by 61 * persons _ and an increase of only t 6—a net 6 reduction of 55. 3. With regard to the four “ Ghulams ” whom I now propose to entertain I would explain that my object in submitting this proposal is to obtain the services of four Persians, properly paid and mounted, to accompany the Consul on tour (more especially in the Kainat) and on ceremonial occasions. The present Seistan Levies are, as I have discovered, practically useless outside Seistan. The rates prevailing in the Kainat are practically double those m Seistan, and it is impossible for the Levies to feed their horses and. themselves and to maintain a decent appearance without either running into debt or receiving extra allowances from Secret Service or some other source, both of which courses are undesirable. But besides this the Seistani is of little use as a guide or informant outside his own country. His language and manners are uncouth and he is quite unfitted for any ceremonial, besides being constitu- tionaiy and irremediably lazy. Still I regard a few of them as useful in Seistan as guides, etc.: and these I would propose to retain, and to enlist in the place of those whose services are dispensed with four Persians or Afghans vho will be regular Government servants paid by Government and mounted on Govern ment horses. Their horses and saddlery, I may observe, will cost nothing m the first instance, as they can he taken from amongst the horses and saddlery lett surplus by the proposed reduction of the escort. 4. I would take this opportunity of observing that in my opinion the prestige and local influence of our Consulate will lose nothing by the large reductions now proposed in its numbers. I have had the opportunity of seeing other Consulates in other parts of Persia (notably our Consulate-General at Tabriz whose whole establishment scarcely amounts to ten persons) and I have not found that a large heterogeneous retinue, or the employment of local men (except in extreme moderation) adds at all to the position or influence of the * Vice-Consul Vice-Consul, Koh-i-Miilik Siah Peons .

I am aware of the difficulties which had to be faced in starting a Consulate in Seistan at all (and X am myself not without experience of a similar character) • but times have now changed and there would seem to be no present reason to’suppose that such obstacles will ever be placed in our way again. And with regard to my proposal for the payment^ of Its. XOO^ a month to the Telegraphist^ at Seistan in view of the reduction of the Vice-Consul, and in consi ieration of his worK as a Confidential Clerk in this office, I would venture to observe that I consider such a sum expended upon a reliable European is very much better spent than it would be on any number of Indian clerks, interpreters, or personal assistants. However useful and even indispensable such assistants may be in India, the majority of them are, I fear, in Persia, more of a hindrance than a help to a Consul in the performance of his duties. Their position in Persia is exceptional, and leads in too many cases to intrigue and undesirable connections. In fact I think that generally speaking the larger the staff the more work the Consul has to do and the greater are his difficulties in settling petty cases, etc. 5. In conclusion I would say that with regard to the actual execution of such of the proposed reductions or increases as may meet with ^ the approval of the Government of India, I would propose to treat each individual case on its merits and on receipt of a general receipt (order?) from Government would be prepared to carry out their orders, only submitting to them for special sanction such specific instances as may, for individual or Apolitical reasons, require special treatment.

F. O’CONNOR, Major, His Bi itannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain. Explanation of figures in attached table. Item 1. Abolition of Vice-Consul .—I am of opinion (as was also Major Kennion) that this officer is no longer necessary on the staff of this Consulate. I am of opinion that his duties could be adequately performed by the Medical Officer at Seistan with the assistance of the Telegraphist at that place who works in the capacity of Confidential Clerk in the Consulate office. The present position of the Medical Officer here is a special one demanding special rates of pay which will have to be continued during the period Captain Hunter remains here (his three years of special duty terminate on 4th January 1911), after which date I hope it will be possible to effect a small saying in the nett cost of the Medical Officer. Captain Hunter is at present paid as follows :—• Rs. Pay of rank 600 Special deputation allowance 400 Vice-Consul's Acting allowance 300 Total . 1,300 If the Medical Officer were made a permanent member of the Consular staff it would be unnecessary, I think, to pay such large allowances (which exceed the amount of the present incumbent’s pay of rank); but at the same time in view of the climate, the impossibility of realising anything by private practice, and the general conditions of life in Seistan, liberal allowances would be necessary. ^ But I propose to address the Government of India again separately on this subject before Captain Hunter’s time here expires and meanwhile I merely advert to the matter to show that I hope to effect a saving of at least Bs. 100 a month in the salary of the Medical Officer here by the end of next year (or whenever Captain Hunter quits the appointment). Regarding a suitable remuneration to the Telegraphist I have noted lower down under item 32, which remarks may please be read in connection with the foregoing.0 4 Item 2. Abolition of Vice-Consul, Koh-i-Mahk —Major Kenmon and I are both of opinion that this officer may now be dispensed with, and his place taken by a writer for whom I have proposed a salary of Rs. 60 (item 26). I am also acquainted with a trustworthy man who would fill this post very suitably and with the sanction of the Government of India I would be prepared to carry out the change at once. Item 3.

At the same tune to have a post of our own between Seistan and Koh-i-Malik Siah is a valuable privilege and one which might very possibly prove at some time of great practical use to us. At present therefore I merely propose a reduction m the establishment which will 5 effect a saving of Rs. 2,100 per annum and probably involve a post twice instead of thrice a week. Later on should telegraphic communication be established between here and Koh-i-Malik Siah, a further reduction might be possible. The Government of India will recollect that at Gyantse I main tained a dak over 100 miles of mountainous country which arrived and left once every five days and which proved quite sufficient and was very econo mically worked (I had only 4 dakwalas all told, but then their animals were the property of, and fed at the cost of, Government). Regarding the two Kassadars whose reduction I have shown here I would say that I do not propose that they should be abolished, hut that as the duties they perform are purely of a postal nature, their cost should be borne by the Postal Department. I regard them as necessary m fact, but do not consider that this Consulate should pay for them. a Present Establishment. 1 Ressaidar at Rs. 150 . 2 Duffadars at Rs. 45 . 2 Naiks at Rs. 40 25 Sowars at Rs. 34 . Yearly. Rs. 1,800 1,080 960 10,200 Total . 14,040' Item 14 Sumptuary allowance to Hospital Assistants. Captain Hunter aorees with me in thinking that the present small sumptuary allowance of P^s 15 to the Hospital Assistant at Seistan may be continued and that an allowance of Rs 10 might with advantage be given to the Hospital Assistant at Biriand He has pointed out to me that at neither of these two places can ' the Hospital Assistant make anything (except small sums on very rare occasions) by private practice and that on the other hand they hold a very respectable position locally which involves certain small expenses m entertain- •or The influence of our medical work is so good and conducted on the whole with such small cost that I think these allowances may be sanctioned with good results. I would incidentally invite attention to my diary for the week ending 4th December 1909, where the attendance at the two hospitals during the month of November 1909 is shown as 2,937 and 1,417, respectively. Ttaw 15 Travelling allowances for Officers and establishment. follows on abolition of Vice-Consul and Vice-Consul, Koh-i-Malik Siah. Item 16. Language Reduction follows on Captain Daukes’ departure. Item 17 Camel contract.—I have enquired very carefully into this matter and I am of opinion that the camel contract, beyond being a conve nience to the Consulate and to a few Persian and Indian merchants serves no necessary purpose and is of small value, if any, in encouraging British trade, the chief purpose for which it was originally recommended ; and at the same time it very much increases the work of this office. I therefore recommend its abolition and its substitution by a “ Trade Agency ” to be conducted by some suitable local firm or agent who should receive from Government a subsidy of Rs 50 per mensem to compensate him for any actual out-of-pocket expenses he may be put to in clerical work, etc., and to show Government’s approval and support The duties of this agent would be to provide camels when required and generally to assist all persons trading with India and Persia. The present camel contract runs till 22nd November 1910 ; but it would be possible to terminate it by paying the contractor a sum of the same value as he himself has deposited with us as security, namely, Rs. 200. With the approval of the Government of India I am prepared to carry this change into execution at once, and to appoint a suitable Trade Agent. Items 18, 19, 20, 21, and ££.—These reductions follow on the reduction of the Escort. Items 23 and 24.— Require no explanation. The exact economy to he effected in postal and telegraphic charges cannot be exactly estimated and must necessarily vary from year to year. The figures given here are calculated from the expenditure up to date during the current financial year. Item 25. Persian Mirza.—See paragraph 2 (a) of my letter No. K.-100, dated the 14th September 1909 , and my telegram No. 245-C, dated the 22nd December 1909. Item 26. Writer at Koh-i-Malik Siah.—-This appointment would follow the abolition of the Vice-Consul at Koh-i-Malik Siah. See remarks under item 2 above. Item 27. Ghulams.—Th^ reason for this increase is explained in the attached covering letter, and would follow on the reduction of the piesent Levy establishment. Details are as follows :— Yearly. Rs. 1 Mir Akhor or Head Ghulam at Rs. 27 . 324 3 Ghulams at Rs. 16 . . . • • 576 Clothing allowance to 4 men at Rs. 35 . • 140 Repairs to saddlery at Rs. 15 per saddle . 60 Peed and keep of 4 horses at Rs. 175 700 Total . 1,800 0 dItem 28. Upkeep of lalang Huh loute. —Major Kennion’s numerous communications on this subject will explain why I have asked for this sum to expend upon the Palang Kuh route, and it is the more desirable now to render is road suitable for caravan traffic since the Customs Department have opened a Customs bureau at Birjand. ™ House-rent, Birjand.-See my telegram No. K.-219, dated 22nd October 1909. Item 30. Trade agency.See remarks under item 17 above. Item 31.' Compensation for dak sowars' camels and horses. —In view of the great mortality of all kinds of animals in Seistan, I venture to ask for this amount yearly to enable me to grant small sums in compensation from time to time for the death of dak sowars’ horses and camels. Item 32. Allowance to Ielegraphist at Seistan .—See remark under item 1 above. If the Vice-Consul here is permanently abolished and his place taken by the Medical Officer, it will I think be essential for the latter to rely to some considerable extent during the absence of the Consul upon the assistance in the Confidential office of the Telegraphist stationed permanently at Seistan. The Sub-Assistant Superintendent at present stationed here, Mr. E. A. McManus, has been in Seistan now for five years and during that period has worked in all respects as a Confidential Clerk in this office to the complete satisfaction of all the officers under whom he has served. He has now a thorough acquaintance with the various complicated political conditions prevailing in Seistan and on its frontiers, and of the difficulties previous Consuls and Vice-Consuls have had to face, and of the various personalities of this country. His assistance and advice are of great value and would be almost indispensable to a Medical Officer coming here to take over the duties of Vice- Consul as a stranger. Moreover, during the periods when the Consul is away, the Medical Officer having his own (very heavy) work to do at the hospital could not spare as much time to office and general work as could a Vice-Consul, with no other duties ^ to perform, and the work and responsibility of the Confidential Office Assistant will be proportionately increased. In view of these considerations then and of the fact that a reduction may I think he made next year in the allowance of the Medical Officer I venture to recommend an allowance of Rs. 100 a month to the Telegraphist in Seistan, and am confident that this expenditure is justifiable and will he productive of good results. I have added some remarks of a more general character but bearing also on this matter in the letter accompanying these proposals. W. E. O’CONNOR, Major, Mis Britannic Majesty's Consul for Seistan and Main.No. 3l5l-Est.-(A). From The SECEETARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA, Foreign Department, to To Major F. McCONAGHEY, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Seistan and Kain. Simla, the 10th October 1910. Sir, I am directed to refer to Major O’Connor’s letter, No. 5-C., dated the 4th January 1910, and connected correspondence and to convey the following orders of the Government of India, on the proposals for effecting a reduction of the exist ing cost of the Seistan Consulate. Abolition of the appointment of Vice-Consul, Seistan. Items 1, 3 and 16 of the statement attached to the letter cited above.— The appointment of Vice-Consul, Seistan, as a separate post is hereby abolished and with effect from the date of this letter the duties will be performed ex-officio by the medical officer of the Consulate. I am to add that the Secretary of State for India is being invited to s anction a |Vice-Consular allowance of Rs. 100 a month, for the medical officer for the additional duties, with retrospective effect, from the same date. Abolition of the appointment of Vice-Consul at Koh-i-Malik Siah. Items Nos. 2, 13 and 26. —The Government of India, accept the proposal that a news-writer on Rs. 60 a month should replace the Vice-Consul at Koh-i-Malik Siah ; this change will be introduced when Khan Bahadur Mahomed Ashraf Khan, the present Vice-Consul, vacates the appointment. I am to add that endeavours are being made to provide the Khan Bahadur with a suitable appointment elsewhere. Office servants and Ghulams. Items Nos. 4 and 27.- 1 Head Ghulam at Rs. 27 a month .. 3 Ghulams at Rs. 16 each Clothing allowance for 4 men at Rs. 36 per man. Repairs to saddlery at Rs. 15 per saddle Feed and keep of 4 horses at Rs. 175 Yearly. Rs. 324 576 140 60 700 The Government of India sanction the proposed enter tainment of four Ghulams at a total cost of Rs. 1,800 a year as detailed on the margin ; but in view of the considerable extra expenditure involved by this measure they are of opinion that the menial establish ment is capable of reduction beyond the limits proposed by Major O’Connor. It Total i.soo should be possible for the Consul when he is at headquarters to employ the Ghulams as office chaprassies, thus rendering a reduction of 4 chaprassies feasible. Further, since the office and hospital are in the same compound, and since the escort is to be reduced, it is unnecessary in the opinion of the Government of India, to retain as many as 4 bhisties and 5 sweepers. It also seems unnecessary to retain the services of a moochi. 475FD2 I am accordingly to request that the following appointments may be reduced forthwith :— 4 Peons on Rs. 14 a month each. 1 Bhisti on Rs. 10 a month. 1 Bhisti on Rs. 8 a month. 1 Sweeper on Rs. 10 a month. 1 Moochi on Rs. 35 a month. and that a further reduction of 1 Bhisti on Rs. 10 a month. 1 Sweeper on Rs. 10 a month. 1 Gardener on Rs. 20 a month. should he effected as soon as the Vice-Consulate at Koh-i-Malik Siah is abolished. I am also to enquire whether it is not possible to dispense with the services of the carpenter and the two shop-keepers, especially the latter. Considering the pro- fitable nature of the work it seems probable that private persons may be willing to undertake it without any remuneration. I am to add that the necessary provision for the clothing allowance to the Ghulams should be budgetted for under the head Allowances and that for “ repairs to saddlery ” and “ feed and keep of horses on the same account, under the head “ Supplies and Services.” Item 5. —The Government of India, accept 'the proposal to reduce this establishment to 1 Jamadar at Rs. 45. 1 DufEadar at Rs. 35. 10 Sowars at Rs. 20 each. thereby effecting a saving of Rs. 2,100 a year and I am to request that you will take action accordingly. I am at the same time to suggest for your consideration that the services of the Jamadar and Duffadar mi^ht be dispensed with and one of the sowars of the escort deputed once a month to disburse the pay of the dak sowars and make any necessary inspection. Revised arrangements for Birjand. Items 7, 8 and 29. —These have already been disposed of, vide the correspond ence ending with the telegram from the Government of India, in the Foreign Department, No. 1171-Est.-(A), dated the 9th April 1910. Carrier 'pigeons. Item 70.—The Government of India agree that there is no necessity for making any provision on this account. I am, however, to point out that the provision m the budget which it is now proposed to surrender was unauthorised, and that no credit can be taken for this item. Levy establishment. Item llj —The Government of India approve of the proposal to reduce the strength of this establishment by 8 men and to revise the pay of the remaining 7 men, as proposed in Major O’Connor’s letter No. 115-C., dated the 30th March 1910, and as detailed below :— 2 Duffadars at Rs. 38 per mmssm each. 4 Sowars at Rs. 26 per mensem each. 1 Sowar at Rs. 3l per mensem. There is also no objection to an allowance of 2 krans per diem being given to these men when travelling, on the distinct understanding that the total expendi ture under this head will not exceed Rs. 200 a year and will be met from the exist ing budget grant for travelling allowance. I am at the same time to enquire whether it is not possible to make a further reduction of one duffadar and one sowar. As at present advised, the Governmentn ^sil wilsti? reke i .atjoi Disikfei flimsy 'Oiiiia &lt;4« * ments. Chagai Levies. Item 12. The Government of India agree to the immediate withdrawal of these levies from Seistan and I am to request that you will arrange all details in direct communication with the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. Sumptuary allowance to Hospital Assistants. Item 14. The proposal to reduce the grant under this head by Rs. 300 a year is approved. Travelling allowance. Item 15. The proposal to reduce the sanctioned provision under this head from Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 4,000 is approved. Camel Contract. Items 17 and SO .—I am to invite attention to the telegram from the Govern ment of India in the Foreign Department No. 2259-Est.-A, dafed the 13th July 1910, and to request that proposals on this subject may be framed in con sultation with the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. Discount on bills. Item 23. The proposal to surrender the entire sanctioned grant of Rs. 500 under this head is approved. Service 'postage and telegram charges. Item 24. The proposal to reduce the sanctioned grant under this head from Rs. 7,000 to Rs. 3,000 is approved. Office establishment. Items 25 and 32.—Major O'Connor’s proposals under this head, so far from effecting any economy, are calculated to cause additional expenditure of Rs. 3,000 a year ' and in view of the Secretary of State’s strict injunctions on the subject,’ the Government of India are unable to entertain any proposal which involves increased expenditure. The proposal to employ the Telegraphist as Confidential Clerk, and to enter tain a Persian Mirza, can therefore only be considered on condition that the additional cost is met by corresponding reductions. I am accordingly to convey sanction to the office establishment of the Seistan Consulate being fixed on one of the two following scales : and I am to request that you will inform the Government of India which alternative you adopt: 1 Head Clerk on Rs. 150—10—200. 1 Accountant on Rs. 80— 4 —100. Nov) Sanctioned. Either. 1 Head Clerk on Rs. 150—10—200 per mensem .I am to add that, should you choose the second alternative, the Government of India sanction the second entertainment of the Persian Mirza on Rs. 100 a month with efiect from the 1st January 1910. Maintenance of the Palang Kuh route. Item 28-In view of the importance of thi* route for Indian trade, the Government of India accept Major 0 Connor’s fW. fho P.W&lt;yes for the maintenance of this route should be met from Indian revenues. I am accordingly to convey sanction to the provision in the current year’s estimates under “45-Civil Works— Maintenance of Roads” being increased from “Ho Rs. 1,000. But the approval of His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran must be obtained before any expenditure is incurred on the route. Compensation for dak sowar’s camels and horses. Item 31. —The Government of India sanction an expenditure of Rs. 300 on this account in the current year under f 'Supplies and Services.” Reduction of escorts and the reduction of contingent grants which depend on the strength of the escorts. Items 6, 9, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22.—The proposal to reduce the strength of the escort has already been considered and the orders of the Govern ment of India, accepting Major O’Connor’s proposals, conveyed to you vide the correspondence ending with the telegram from the Government of India in the Foreign Department No. 1334-Est.-(B), dated the 21st April 1910. The provision in the current year’s estimates under the different heads affect ed should therefore be proportionately reduced the grant for clothing for escorts (item 22) being reduced from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 200. Reduction of certain miscellaneous grants. —In view of the absolute necessity for economising wherever possible, the Government of India have decided that the sanctioned grants in the current year’s estimates under the heads detailed be low should be reduced to the amounts noted against each. Existing. Now sanctioned. Supplies and Services. Secret Service 4,200 3,000 Purchase and repair of tents 800 500 Contingencies.

It has been suggested as a measure of economy that the headquarters of the Consulate might be removed to Birjand which would do away with the necessity of having a separate Vice-Consul at that place. The Government of India are not prepared to take up this question at present, but I am to request that this may be borne in mind as a possible measure of economy to be effected hereafter.Future of the men whose services will be dispensed with. Major O’Connor has not submitted any recommendations on this subject and I am accordingly to invite your attention to Articles 352 (6), 436 and 481 {a) of the Civil Service Regulations and to reque- t that the procedure therein laid down may be followed in the cases of such of the members of your establishment whose services will be dispensed with in accordance with these orders. In no case can the payment of a compensation penginn or gratuity from the Secret Service Grant be sanctioned and each case ieSm the grant of a compensation pension or gratuity should be submitted to the Government of India' separately, through the Comptroller, India Treasuries, with the necessary pension papers. In conclusion I am to request that a proposition statement in duplicate in the prescribed form, showing the entire establishment of the Seistan Consulate as it will stand according to these orders, and also a statement of your revised budget grants for the current year in the attached form, may be submitted without delay to the Government of India through the Comptroller, India Treasuries.

In our Foreign Despatch No. 168, dated the 23rd December 1909, we informed Your Lordship of the proposed substitution of a Native Agency at Turbat-i-Haidari for the Consulate formerly existing at that place. The saving resulting from this measure, which has now been carried into effect, amounts to Rs. 88,560 as shown in the accompanying statement A.* Enclosure 1. ^ very substantial reduction has also been effected in the cost of the Meshed Consulate-General, which we have reduced from Rs. 1,52,410, the budget figure for 1909-10, to Rs. 1,08,340,+ making a saving of Rs. 44,070 a year.

To The Right Hon’ble the EARL of CREWE, K.G., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Fort William ; the 17th November 1910. My Lord, In your predecessor’s Secret despatch No. 15, dated the 25th June 1909, Lord Morley invited our attention to a suggestion made by His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that expenditure on Seis&lt;an should be reduced forthwith by one-half, and he requested us to consider what material reductions could be immediately effected. We now have the honour to forward, for Tour Lordship’s inform- Letter from Hi. Britannic M.je.t,', Co„.„i fer ation, a copy of the correspondence noted on the margin, showing the reductions which, as the result of careful consider ation, we have made in the charges for the Seistan Consulate. 2. It will be perceived from the statement accompanying our letter to the Consul, No. 3151 Est. A., dated the 10th October 1910, that the effect of our orders is a reduction of approximately Rs. 42,000 in the annual budget allotment for the Consulate. This reduction will be further increased later by the abolition of the Vice-Consulate at Koh-i-Malik Siah, which will be effected as soon as provision can be made for the present incumbent, and by ot'.er economies which are still under consideration. The heads under which reduc tion has already been ordered are— Seistan and Kain, No. 5 C., dated the 4th January 1910. Letter to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain, No. 3151 Est.

The majority of these are unimportant and require no special explanation except such as is given in the “Explanatory Notes” attached to the enclosed Table of figures. I have withdrawn, for instance, my proposals for modifications in the present office staff which are at present unnecessary and undesirable; as also those for the abolition of the Hospital Assistant at Birjand and the reduction of the pay of the Hospital Assistant at Seistan, neither of which I would now recommend. Whilst on the other hand I have proposed a still larger decrease in the numbers of the Escort here and of the Levy establishment. Such increases as I have proposed in the establishment have been explained elsewhere; but in further justification of these I would point out that I am proposing a total reduction of the personnel by 61 * persons and an increase of only f 6—a net reduction of 55. 1 r ?£ ard f° u . r “ Ghulams ” whom I now propose to entertain I would explain that my object in submitting this proposal is to obtain the services of four Persians, properly paid and mounted, to accompany the Consul on tour (more especially in the Kainat) and on ceremonial occasions. The present Seistan Levies are, as ^ I have discovered, practically useless outside Seistan. The ^ rates prevailing in the Kainat are practically double those in Seistan, and it is impossible for the Levies to feed their horses and themselves and ^ to maintain a decent appearance without either running into debt or receiving extra allowances from Secret Service or some other source, both of which courses are undesirable. But besides this the Seistani is of little use as a guide or informant outside his own country. His language and manners are uncouth and he is quite unfitted for any ceremonial, besides being constitu- tionaly and irremediably lazy. Still I regard a few of them as useful in Seistan as guides, etc.: and these I would propose to retain, and to enlist in the place of those whose services are dispensed with four Persians or Afghans who will be regular Government servants paid by Government and mounted on Govern ment horses. Their horses and saddlery, I may observe, will cost nothing in the first instance, as they can be taken from amongst the horses and saddlery left surplus by the proposed reduction of the escort. 4. I would take this opportunity of observing that in my opinion the prestige and local influence of our Consulate will lose nothing by the large reductions now proposed in its numbers. I have had the opportunity of seeing other Consulates in other parts of Persia (notably our Consulate-General at Tabriz whose whole establishment scarcely amounts to ten persons) and I have not found that a large heterogeneous retinue, or the employment of local men (except in extreme moderation) adds at all to the position or influence of the 2661 P.

With regard to the 6 fourr 1 r am aW are of the difficulties which had to he faced m starting a Consu ate in Seistan at all (and I am myself not without expenence of a similar character) • but times have now changed and there would seem to be no present reason to suppose that such obstacles will ever be placed m our way again. And with regard to my proposal for the payment of Its. 100 a month to the mi 1 -cf at Qpidfln in view of the reduction of the Vice-Consul, and m consideration of Ids work as a Confidential Clerk in this office, I would renture to observe that I consider such a sum expended upon a reliable European is very much better spent than it would he On any number of Indian clerks, tote,'ureters or personal assistants. However useful and even indispensable KSt m^ in India, the majority of them are, I fear, m Persia, more of a hindrance than a help to a Consul in the performance of his duties. Their position in Persia is exceptional, and leads m too many cases to intrigue and undesirable connections. In fact I think that generally speaking the larger the staff the more work the Consul has to do and the greater are hs difficulties iu settling petty cases, etc. • # 6 In conclusion I would say that with regard to the actual execution of such of the proposed reductions or increases as may meet with the approval of the Government of India, I would propose to treat each individual case on its m^rite anToTreceipt X general receipt 1 (order?) from Government would be prepared to carry out their orders, only submitting to them for special sanction such specific instances as may, for individual orjpohtical reasons, require special treatment.

Abolition of Vice-Consul. —I am of opinion (as was also Major Kennion) that this officer is no longer necessary on the staff of this Consulate. I am of opinion that his duties could be adequately performed by the Medical Officer at Seistan with the assistance of the Telegraphist at that place who works in the capacity of Confidential Clerk in the Consulate office. The present position of the Medical Officer here is a special one demanding special rates of pay which will have to be continued during the period Captain Hunter remains here (his three years of special duty terminate on 4th January 1911), after which date I hope it will be possible to effect a small saving in the nett cost of the Medical Officer. Captain Hunter is at present paid as follows :—• Us. Pay of rank . . . . . . . c, 600 Special deputation allowance . . . • . . . 400 Vice-ConsuFs Acting allowance. . . . . . . 300 Total . 1,300 If the Medical Officer were made a permanent member of the Consular staff it would he unnecessary, I think, to pay such large allowances (which exceed the amount of the present incumbent’s pay of rank); but at the same time in view of the climate, the impossibility of realising anything by private practice, and the general conditions of life in Seistan, liberal allowances would be necessary. But I propose to address the Government of India again separately on this subject before Captain Hunter’s time here expires and meanwhile I merely advert to the matter to show that I hope to effect a saving of at least Bs. 100 a month in the salary of the Medical Officer here by the end of next year (or whenever Captain Hunter quits the appointment). Regarding a suitable remuneration to the Telegraphist I have noted lower down under item 32, which remarks may please be read in connection with the foregoing.4 X tilii aisu cnjtjuaiJJLucti. vtauu. « n. va^v i. -■— post V6ry suitably and with the sanction of the Government of India I would be prepared to carry out the change at once. Item 3. Exchange compensation allowance. —Follows reduction of the Vice- Consul’s appointment. Item 4. Office servants. —Reduction of two chaprasies at Rs. 14 making an annual saving of Rs. 340. Item 5. Dak Sowars .— Present Establishment. Yearly.

At the same time to have a post of our own between Seistan and Koh-i-Malik Siah is a valuable privilege and one which might very possibly prove at some time of great practical use to us. At present therefore I merely propose a reduction in the establishment which will effect a saving of Rs. 2,100 per annum and probably involve a post twice instead of thrice a week. Later on should telegraphic communication be established between here and Koh-i-Malik Siah, a further reduction might be possible. The Government of India will recollect that at Gyantse I main tained a dak over 100 miles of mountainous country which arrived and left once every five days and which proved quite sufficient and was very econo mically worked (I had only 4 dakwalas all told, but then their animals were the property of, and fed at the cost of, Government). Regarding the two Kassadars whose reduction I have shown here I would say that I do not propose that they should be abolished, but that as the duties they perform are purely of a postal nature, their cost should be borne by the Postal Department. I regard them as necessary in fact, but do not consider that this Consulate should pay for them. Item 6. Escorts .— Yearly.

Rsl 540 960 4,080 5,580 8,460 I am of opinion that the present Escort is unnecessarily large and that a much smaller number of men will be sufficient for ceremonial purposes. Such a reduction is in consonance with the Anglo-Eussian Agreement and with the reductions already effected or about to be effected in the Cossack Escorts at Seistan and Birjand. Items 7, 8, and 29.

Item 13- Horse Allowance to Vice-Consul^ Koh-i-Malik Siah. hollows on abolition of Vice-Consul, Koh-i-Malik Siah. 2661 F. D.6 Item M Sumptuary allowance to Hospital Assistants. Captain Hunter agrees with me in thinking that the present small sumptuary allowance of Ps 15 to the Hospital Assistant at Seistan may be continued and that an allowance of Es. 10 might with advantage be given to the Hospital Assistant at Biriand He has pointed out to me that at neither of these two places can the Hospital Assistant make anything (except small sums on very rare occasions) by private practice and that on the other hand they hold a very respectable position locally which involves certain small expenses m entertain- in' The influence of our medical work is so good and conducted on the whole with such small cost that I think these allowances may be sanctioned with good results. I would incidentally invite attention to my diary for the week ending 4th December 1909, where the attendance at the two hospitals during the montlf of November 1909 is shown as 2,987 and 1,417, respectively. Item 15. Travelling allowances for Officers and establishment.—Rsfoxotion , r* tx * /''I 1 « J on! --i _1\/T a 11 lr Item 16. Language allowance.— Heduction follows on Captain Daukes’ departure. Item 17. Camel contract.—1 have enquired very carefully into this matter and I am of opinion that the camel contract, beyond being a conve nience to the Consulate and to a few Persian and Indian merchants, serves no necessary purpose and is of small value, if any, in encouraging Biitish trade, the chief purpose for which it was originally recommended ; and at the same time it very much increases the work of this office. I therefore recommend its abolition and its substitution by a “ Trade Agency ” to he conducted by some suitable local firm or agent who should receive from Government a subsidy of Its. 50 per mensem to compensate him for any actual out-ol-pocket expenses he may be put to in clerical work, etc., and to show Government’s approval and support. The duties of this agent would be to provide camels when required and generally to assist all persons trading with India and Persia. The present camel contract runs tfil 22nd November 1910; but it would be possible to terminate it by paying the contractor a sum of the same value as he himself has deposited with us as security, namely, Es. 200. With the approval of the Government of India I am prepared to carry this change into execution at once, and to appoint a suitable Trade Agent. I Items 18, 19, 20, 21, and &amp; 2 .— These reductions follow on the reduction of the Escort. Items 23 and 24.— Eequire no explanation. The exact economy to be effected in postal and telegraphic charges cannot be exactly estimated and must necessarily vary from year to year. The figures given here are calculated from the expenditure up to date during the current financial year. Item 25. Persian Mirza.—Sez paragraph 2 {a) of my letter No. K.-100, dated the 14th September 1909, and my telegram No. 245-C., dated the 22nd December 1909. Item 26.

He lias now a thorough acquaintance with the various complicated political conffitTons prevailing m Seistan and on its frontiers, and of the difficulties previous Consuls and Vice-Consuls have had to face, and of the various personalities of this country. ^ His assistance and advice are of great value and would be almost indispensable to a Medical Officer coming here to take over the duties of Vice- Consu! as a stranger Moreover, during the periods when the Consul is away, the Medical Officer having his own (very heavy) work to do at the hospital could not spare as much time to office and general work as could a Vice-Consul with no other duties ^ to perform, and the work and responsibility of the Confidential Office Assistant will be proportionately increased. In view of these considerations then and of the fact that a reduction may I think be made next year in the allowance of the Medical Officer I venture to recommend an allowance of Rs. 100 a month to the Telegraphist in Seistan, and am confident that this expenditure is justifiable and will be productive of good results. I have added some remarks of a more general character but bearing also on this matter in the letter accompanying these proposals. W. E.

Feom To The SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA, Foreign Department Major F. McCONAGHEY, ffis Britannic Majesty's Consul for Seistan and Kain. Simla, the 10th October 1910. Sir, I am directed to refer to Major O’Connor’s letter, No. 5-C., dated the 4th January 1910, and connected correspondence and to convey the following orders of the Government of India, on the proposals for effecting a reduction of the exist ing cost of the Seistan Consulate. Abolition of the appointment of Vice-Consul, Seistan. Items 1, 3 and 16 of the statement attached to the letter cited above .—■ The appointment of Vice-Consul, Seistan, as a separate post is hereby abolished and with effect from the date of this letter the duties will be performed ex-officio by the medical officer of the Consulate. I am to add that the Secretary of State for India is being invited to sanction a |Vice-Consular allowance of Rs. 100 a month, for the medical officer for the additional duties, with retrospective effect, from the same date. Abolition of the appointment of Vice-Consul at Koh-i-Malih Siah. Items Nos. 2, 13 and 26. —The Government of India, accept the proposal that a news-writer on Rs. 60 a month should replace the Vice-Consul at Koh-i-Malik Siah ; this change will be introduced when Khan Bahadur Mahomed Ashraf Khan, the present Vice-Consul, vacates the appointment. I am to add that endeavours are being made to provide the Khan Bahadur with a suitable appointment elsewhere. Office servants and Ghulams. Items Nos. 4 and 27.—The Government of India sanction the proposed enter- Yeariy. tainment of four Ghulams at a total cost of Rs. 1,800 a year as detailed on the margin ; but in view of the considerable extra expenditure involved by this measure they are of opinion that the menial establish ment is capable of reduction beyond the limits proposed by Major O’Connor. It should be possible for the Consul when he Rs. I Head Ghulam at Rs. 27 a month .. 324 3 Ghulams at Rs. 16 each .. .. 576 Clothing allowance for 4 men at Rs. 35 140 per man. Repairs to saddlery at Rs. 15 per saddle 60 Feed and keep of 4 horses at Rs. 175 700 Total 1,800 _ ^ is at headquarters to employ the Ghulams as office chaprassies, thus rendering a reduction of 4 chaprassies feasible. Further, since the office and hospital ^ re the same compound, and since the escort is to be reduced, it is unnecessary m the opinion of the Government of India, to retain as many as 4 bhisties and 5 sweepers. It also seems unnecessary to retain the services of a moochi. 475FD2 I am accordingly to request that the following appointments may be reduced forthwith :— 4 Peons on Rs. 14 a month each. 1 Bhisti on Rs. 10 a month. 1 Bhisti on Rs. 8 a month. 1 Sweeper on Rs. 10 a month. 1 Moochi on Rs. 35 a month. and that a further reduction of 1 Bhisti on Rs. 10 a month. 1 Sweeper on Rs. 10 a month. 1 Gardener on Rs. 20 » K oh-i-Malik Siah is abolished, should be effected as soon a dispose with the services of the I am also to enqmre whether it rs not ^ atter .

I am at the same time to suggest for your consideration that the services of the Jamadar and Duffadar might be dispensed with and one of the sowars of the escort deputed once a month to disburse the pay of the dak sowars and make any necessary inspection.

I am, however, to point out that the P r j&gt; v ^ion m the budget which it is now proposed to surrender was unauthorised, and that no credit can be taken for this item. Levy establishment. Item 11: —The Government of India approve of the proposal to reduce the strength of this establishment by 8 men and to revise the pay of the remaining 7 men, as proposed in Major O’Connor’s letter No. 115-C., dated the 30th March 1910, and as detailed below — 2 Duffadars at Rs. 38 p^r mmsem each. 4 Sowars at Rs. 26 per mensem each. 1 Sowar at Rs. 3l per mensem. There is also no objection to an allowance of 2 krans per diem being given to these men when travelling, on the distinct understanding that the total expendi ture under this head will not exceed Rs. 200 a year and will be met from the exist ing budget grant for travelling allowance. I am at the same time to enquire whether it is not possible to make a further reduction of one duffadar and one sowar. As at present advised, the Governmenof India are inclined to think that one duffadar and 4 sowars plus the four Ghulams whose entertamment has no w been sanctioned, should be sufficient for all require- ments. ^ •* ,&lt;; Chagai Levies. Item 22.—The Government of India agree to the immediate withdrawal of these levies from Seistan and I am to request that you will arrange all details in direct communication with the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan.

Items 25 and 32. —Major O’Oonnor’s proposals under this head, so far from effecting any economy, are calculated to cause additional expenditure of Rs. 3,000 a year ; and in view of the Secretary of State’s strict injunctions on the subject, the Government of India are unable to entertain any proposal which involves increased expenditure. The proposal to employ the Telegraphist as Confidential Clerk, and to enter tain a Persian Mirza, can therefore only be considered on condition that the additional cost is met by corresponding reductions. I am accordingly to convey sanction to the office establishment of the Seistan Consulate being fixed on one of the two following scales: and I am to request that you will inform the Government of India which alternative you adopt:— Existing. 1 Head Clerk on Rs. 150—10—200. 1 Accountant on Rs. 80—4—100. 1 2nd Clerk on Rs. 60—4—80. 1 3rd Clerk on Rs. 25—2—35.

Maintenance of the Palang Kuh route. Item 28. In view of the importance of this route for Indian trade, the Government of India accept Major O’Connor’s recommendation that the charges for the maintenance of this route should be met ^ from Indian revenues. ™ I am accordingly to convey sanction to the provision in the current year s estimates under “45-Civil Works—Maintenance of Roads” being increased from Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,000. But the approval of His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran must be obtained before any expenditure is incurred on the route. Compensation for dak sowar's camels and horses. Item 31. —The Government of India sanction an expenditure of Rs. 300 on this account in the current year under ‘‘Supplies and Services.” Reduction of escorts and the reduction of contingent grants which depend on the strength of the escorts. Items 6, 9, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22.—The proposal to reduce the strength of the escort has already been considered and the orders of the Govern ment of India, accepting Major O’Connor’s proposals, conveyed to you vide the correspondence ending with the telegram from the Government of India in the Foreign Department No. 1334-Est.-(B), dated the 21st April 1910.

Altairs. To ditto, dated 25th June 1909. 2. It will be seen that Sir E. Grey, being strongly impressed by the striking contrast in cost between the appointments in Persia filled from the Levant Service and the Indian Political Department, respectively, proposes to meet the difficulty caused by the high scale of expenditure on the Indian establishments by transferring to the Levant Service, as suitable candidates become available, all the inland appointments now filled by Indian officers, with the exception of those in Seistan, the Military Attacheship at Meshed, and possibly the medical appointment at that place. It is also proposed to transfer to the Levant Service the appointment of Political Resident and Consul-General at Bagdad. In view of the change m the political situation consequent on the Anglo-Russian Agreement, and on a con sideration of the efficiency displayed during the recent critical period by officers of the Levant Service at Tabriz and Ispahan, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is satisfied that the proposed transfer can be carried out without detriment to Imperial or Indian interests. 3. Apart from the force of the arguments based on economy to which Sir E. Grey has referred, I consider it expedient, on principles of policy, that except in places such as Seistan and the Gulf littoral, where the local circumstances render the employment of Indian officers desirable, the conduct of Consular affairs in Persia should rest with the Foreign Office and in the hands of its officers of the Levant Service. If in any particular post, such as Bagdad, a practical need arises for the services of an official acquainted with any Indian language, it can be met by the employment of an Indian officer in a subordinate position s. 15.snch as Mr. Gaskin now fills. I approve, therefore, of the proposal to transfer, as the opportunity occurs, to the Levantine service ail t e posts indicated, with the exception of those connected with Bushire and the Persian Gulf littoral, Meshed and Seistan. As regards Meshed, I recognise that an alteration of the present system involves consideration of our relations with Afghanistan, and before I finally agree to t e transfer of the appointments there other than that of Military Attache I shall await an expression of Your Excellency’s views which I desire to with the least possible delay. 4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs further recommends as an immediate measure that the Consulate at Turbat-i-Haidan should be reduced to the status of a Native Agency, such as existed prior to 190d, on the ground that the conditions have altered so materially since the Consulate was created that he would no longer feel justified in asking the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury to bear a moiety of the cost involved. This recommendation, it should be observed, as been made after a consideration of the views expressed in paragraph 4 of your Secret letter No. 179, dated the 8th October 1908. I request that you will reconsider the question in the light of the conclusions at which Sir E. Grey has arrived, and I shall be glad to receive your views on it with the least possible delay, as also on the proposal that the requirements of Birjand should be met by the appointment of a tele graph officer as Vice-Consul, and that, if it is considered indispensable to station a medical officer there, “ the occupant of the post should be “ dependent on Seistan, be provided with a limited travelling allowance, •&lt; an d be in charge of any medical work connected with the latter “ place.” 5. In connection with my Secret Despatch No. 2 of the Sth January 1909, Your Excellency in Council will not fail to notice that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggests that expenditure on Seistan should be reduced forthwith by one half. 1 am aware that the Seistan post, owing to its isolated frontier position, and the duties which devolve upon its officers in connection with Indian trade, sanitary measures, and the arms traffic, cannot be compared with other posts, where the services rendered are less varied and more economically performed. The telegraph charges are also to be taken into account. But I am disposed to agree with Sir E. Grey that the expenditure can be reduced, and I request that you will proceed at once to consider what material reductions can be immediately effected. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Morley of Blackburn.&gt; Lj Sir, No. ENCLOSURES. Enclosure No. 1. Foreign Office to India Office Foreign Office, T tit 20th February 1909. am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th January respecting the possibility of a reduction m expenditure on consular establishments in Persia. It is observed that the Government of India, whose despatch forms the enclosure in your letter, confine themselves to deprecating reduction in the existing number of establishments, and do not discuss revision of the charges of each individual post, and that their attention has been called to this omission, a tabular statement being forwarded setting forth the striking contrast in cost between the appointments filled from the Levant Service and the Indian Departments respectively. I am to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that Sir E. Grey is profoundly impressed by the comparative charges as between the two services, and by the marked increase in recent years of the cost of the Indian appointments, particularly Seistan. Apart from the expenditure connected with the Legation at Tehran, it appears that nine posts are filled from the Indian Departments at a yearly cost of 52,500L, as against 6,300L spent upon six posts filled from the Levant Service. Sir E. Grey has taken the state of affairs, as evidenced by these figures, into serious consideration ; he has arrived at the conclusion that a revision should be made, both of the distribution of posts as between the two Services and of the existing scale of charges. In arriving at this conclusion, the Secretary of State has been influenced by two principal considerations, (a) the efficient conduct of the business of the important posts at Tabreez and Ispahan during the recent period of crisis and unusual difficulty, and (6) the change in the diplomatic situation, following on the signature of the Anglo-Russian Convention. Tabreez and Ispahan have, with the exception of Tehran, been the centres of the most important events in Persia during recent months : the officers at these posts where the expenditure is on a very moderate scale have, as Lord Morley will no doubt concede, satisfactorily dis charged their duties not only in regard to Imperial interests, but also in regard to those matters which may be deemed to affect more closely Indian affairs ; and, under the existing arrangements, the Government of India have been kept fully informed as to the progress of events in the places in question. With the signature of the Anglo-Russian Convention, the diplomatic aspects of the Persian problem must necessarily assume essential and increasing modification. Whereas formerly Persia was the centre of continual rivalry in the local interests of Great Britain and Russia, the aim and object of the Anglo-Russian Convention is, above all, to define and safeguard the respective interests, especially political, of the two countries, thus putting a period to the friction in Persia which has exercised so harmful an influence on our general relations with Russia in the past. Whatever justification, therefore, may hitherto have existed for the expenditure of large sums on consular establishments in Persia, Sir E. A 2 S. 15.Grey cannot but feel that, in view both of the clear definition of the British and Russian spheres of interest and of the aim that in future Persian problems should constitute a subsidiary, as distinct from a cardinal factor in British policy towards Russia, no further reason exists for maintaining, in the majority of the Persian consular posts, a scale which is both sumptuous and exceptional. . . _ In these circumstances, while Sir E. Grey is strongly of opinion that it would be advisable for the establishment at Seistan (as constituting, in a certain measure, an administrative outpost of the Indian Govern ment), and for the posts on the littoral of the Persian Gulf to continue to be officered from the Indian Departments, I am to invite Lord Morley’s observations on the view of the Secretary of State that the remaining inland posts, now filled by Indian officers, might suitably be transferred to officers of the Levant Service. . . . , . . , In the event of the arrangement outlined meeting with His Lordship s concurrence, the only Indian officer whose retention at Meshed would appear to be called for, would be the Military Attache; unless, indeed, it should be desired, for purposes of quarantine, to continue the medical appointment. The arrangements proposed could, however, only come gradually into force in the course of two or three years, as the supply of officers of the Levant Service would not sooner correspond to the demand. In the meantime, however, I am to express Sir E. Grey’s view that no useful purpose will be served by the upkeep of the post, costing 6,200Z. a year, at Turbat-i-Haidari, which, as you are aware, is within the Russian sphere. The circumstances under which this post was created in 1903 are well known to the Secretary of State for India ; and, with the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Agreement, Sir E. Grey considers that the conditions have materially altered, and he would no longer feel justified in recommending the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury to bear a moiety of the cost involved. Lie accordingly is of opinion that a Rative Agency, as advocated by Captain Keyes and as existed formerly, would fully meet the requirements of the situation. With regard to the establishment at Seistan, the Secretary of State considers that the existing charges are extravagant; and I am to submit, for Lord Morley’s earnest consideration, a proposal that the existing expenditure should be reduced by one-half forthwith. If it is held to be indispensable to station a medical officer at Birjand, I am to suggest that the occupant of the post should be dependent upon Seistan, be provided with a limited travelling allowance, and be in charge of any medical work connected with the latter place. His Majesty’s Minister is, however, of opinion that a Vice-Consulate at Birjand, to be filled by a telegraph officer, would meet all requirements. Finally, I am to express -the view of Sir E. Grey that the Consulate- General at Bagdad should be transferred to the Levant Service. The cost of this establishment was included in the arrangement of 1900, being fixed at 7,800L, of which half was to be contributed from Imperial funds. It is estimated that the cost to the Indian and British Exchequers could, if the post were transferred as proposed, be very materially reduced, without detriment to the public service. Indian interests, both commercial and political, as well as such duties as the administration of the Oudh Bequest, would, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, not suffer from the adoption of this proposal; while, in view of the increasing importance of Mesopotamia from the political point of view, there would be advantage if the Consul-General at Bagdad were under the sole control of His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. In submitting these views to the Secretary of State for India, Sir E. Grey is of opinion that a saving of some thousands a year to the British and Indian Exchequers may be effected by the adoption of the proposals which he has suggested without any sacrifice of efficiency, and he■g-aimiui ventures therefore to recommend them to Lord Morley’s favourable r Lhe Under Secretary of State for India.

But presumably there is no immediate need to consider the modifications of existing arrangements that may be necessary hereafter, if the post is transferred to the Levant Consular Service.

To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor Yv ith reference to the Secret Despatch of Your Excellency’s expenditure on Consular establishments in Persia, I enclose copy of a 2. Ihe question, as is pointed out in that letter, cannot be confined to the narrower ground of the practicability in present circumstances of abolishing altogether any of the existing Consulates and Vice- Consulates, and I request that you will scrutinise in detail the various items connected with expenditure on the establishments attached to the existing posts, and furnish me with a report at the earliest date that may be feasible on any economies that it may be possible to effect. 3. The form of the annual statement of your expenditure in Persia, which classifies the cost at the various posts under very few heads, precludes any efficient criticism in this country of the reasonableness of the scale on wdiich these establishments are maintained. In particular further details are needed as to the item “ Contingencies,” and the cost of escorts and consular guards should be separately shown. I must observe that the contrast between the cost of the appointments filled from the Levant Service and the Indian Departments respectively, as showm in the attached Table, is very striking, even when full allowance is made for the higher rates of Indian pay, and for the special conditions of the Indian appointments on the Afghan border and in the Gulf. There is also a marked contrast between the cost of the posts at Kerman, Ahwaz, and Kermanshah on the one hand, and in Seistan on the other. The expenditure on the latter has risen from Rs. 71,334 in 1902-03 to Rs. 159,388 in 1906-07, a total exceeding that of the charges at Meshed. General of India in Council.

It vdll be observed that the question of the necessity of retaining the post of the Assistant to the Consul in Seistan and of maintaining aConsular as well as a Medical Officer at Turbat-i-Haidari is raised in the letter to the Foreign Office. Your Excellency is aware, of the importance attached by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury to restricting the Consular expenditure in Persia within the narrowest limits consistent with a due protection of British and Indian interests. The considerations which render a strict insistence on economy necessary in regard to the demands on the British Exchequer apply with even greater force to India. I trust that Your Excellency, when you furnish the report for which I have asked on the details of this expenditure, will be able to effect material reductions. Unless this can be accomplished, there will be an increasing difficulty in obtaining the sanction of His Majesty’s Government to such increases of expenditure as Your Excellency’s Government may from time to time find it necessary to propose. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Morley of Blackburn. i**—*ENCLOSURES. Enclosure No. 1.

T? - am fip re - cted to en ^ ose » to be laid before the Secretary of State n° f ?nA e o Cret letter from tlie Government of India, No. 179 dated 8th October 1908, regarding the possibility of a reduction of expenditure on consular establishments in Persia It will be observed that the Government of India confine themselves m t eir present letter to considering whether any of the Consulates and Vice-Consulates now existing can be abolished, and do not discuss in any detail the practicability of a reduction of the expenditure on the establishments attached to these posts, assuming them to be retained. Copy of a Despatch drawing attention to the omission and asking for the early submission of a report on this aspect of the question is enclosed. As regards the practicability of abolishing any of the existing posts, Viscount Morley would be glad to be favoured with Sir E. Grey’s views. As regards the Consulate at Turbat-i-Haidari, it may be observed that, though the withdrawal of the post may not be desirable at present, the question is worth considering whether it is necessary to maintain there both a Consul and an Officer of the Indian Medical Service. According to the list of the Foreign Department of the Government of India of the 1st duly the Medical Officer at Turbat was acting as Vice- Consul at Birjand, and this arrangement might be continued, if consular representation at Birjand as well as at Turbat is considered necessary. As regards Seistan, the establishment, as shown in the above- mentioned list, consisted of a Consul, an Assistant to the Consul with the status of Vice-Consul, and a Medical Officer on plague duty. It seems a question whether in normal circumstances it would not suffice to maintain in Seistan Consul and a Medical Officer. The reasons which led to the deputation to Seistan of an Assistant to the Consul were stated in the Government of India’s letter of the 21st July 1904, enclosed in Sir H. Walpole’s letter of 29th September 1904. 1 am to take this opportunity to suggest that, when an Officer of the Levant Service is available for the Consulate at Shiraz, which is being temporarily held by Mr. Bill of the Indian Political Department, Kermanshah might be transferred to the Levant Service and Shiraz allotted to the Indian Political Department.

My Lord, We have the honour to refer to paragraph 3 of our despatch No. 67 (External), dated the 26th March 1908, in which we promised a further com munication regarding the possibility of a reduction of expenditure in Persia. 2. We need not assure Your Lordship that we have approached this question with a strong and determined desire to reduce, wherever possible, the burden which is thrown upon the revenues of India by the maintenance of our consular establishments in Persia. And if after long and anxious enquiry we are not able, as we are not able, to recommend any measure of retrenchment, it is because the pressure of recent events, and any forecasts that we can draw from Persian affairs, have driven us to conclude that our interests will be gravely menaced by the weakening or impoverishment of our consular staff* While the Anglo-Eussian Agreement may point towards a policy of withdrawal, the vigorous intervention and insistence of Germany, the growing industrial interest of India in Persia, and the internal condition of Persia itself, all point unhesitatingly the other way. 3. At the present moment the consular representation in Persia, outside Tehran, of Great Britain and Eussia compares as follows:—in the Russian sphere Great Britain and Eussia are both represented at Tabriz, Eesht, Ispahan Kermanshah, Meshed and Turbat-i-Haidari, while Eussia in addition is re presented at Ardebil and Asterabad: in the British sphere Great Britain and Eussia are b ith represented at Kerman, Seistan and Bunder Abbas, and Eussia is also represented at Birjand: in the neutral zone Great Britain and Eussia are both represented at Bushire, and in addition Great Britain is represented at Shiraz, Mohammerah, and Ahwaz. Thus Great Britain and Eussia are each represented in 13 places; Eussia preponderating in both the Eussian and the British spheres and Great Britain preponderating in the neutral zone. The Germans have, as yet, consular representation only at Bushire, but important tours have been made by Herr Kurt Jung, Dr. Grothe, and others, and there are active agents for Germany in the Gulf and elsewhere. Neither Eussia2 nor Germany shows the least intention of reducing their activity; the Russian staff is appreciably stronger than the British; and Mr. Marling reported in his despatch No. 143, dated 15th June 1908, that in the last 13 months the Russian Consular guards had been increased by four officers and 140 men. 4. In the Russian sphere Tabriz, Ispahan and Resht are directly under the Foreign Office. Meshed is the head-quarters of the Governor-General of Khorasan on whose good-will the security of the Seistan-Meshed trade route and the maintenance of British interests in Seistan and Kain largely depend; and the Consul-General is charged with the important duty of acting as an intermediary between Afghan and Persian officials, and generally of keeping a watchful eye on the Perso-Afghan frontier and Russian Central Asia. Por military reasons the retention of our Consulate in Meshed is of peculiar importance. Commercially Kermanskak is important, because of the large and increasing volume of Indian trade which passes through that district: politically, it 'is important on account of its proximity to the projected line of the Baghdad Railway and its position as being on the best if not the only possible alignment of an extension of that railway to Tehran, and on a possible align- ment of a railway from the north to the south of Persia. At the present moment Kermanskak has special importance as an outpost for obtaining trustworthy information regarding the designs of Germany in that quarter, the progress of the Turko-Persian frontier dispute, and developments in Luristan. As &amp; to Turbat-i-Haidari, Your Lordship will observe from the corres pondence, of which a copy is enclosed, that Captain Keyes, our present Consul, has somewhat lightly suggested (on the eve, it may be noted, of his departure) the abolition of the Consulate and the substitution of a Native agency in its place. The suggestion is opposed on the weightiest grounds both by Major Sykes and Mr. Marling, and with special regard to the position occupied by Russia in relation to the sanitary cordon on the Perso-Afghan frontier, and the necessity for continuous and effective protection of the interests of Indian and Afghan traders in that neighbourhood. We are quite unable to recommend the suggestion for acceptance. Not only would our action, as pointed out by Mr. Marling, lend itself in appearance to the impu tation that we had entirely abandoned Northern Persia to Russia; it would also make itself felt all along the eastern border, especially in Seistan, and might complicate our relations with Afghanistan. 5. In the British sphere we are already less represented than is Russia, and it seems scarcely necessary to justify the existence of our establishments at Bunder Abbas, Kerman and Seistan, at all of which places His Majesty s Government apparently desire that British interests should be fully maintained. We only refer to the proposal made by Major Kennion for establishing a Yice-Consulate at Birjand, to say that we understand that Your Lordship will consult us regarding it on a future occasion. 6. There remains the neutral zone. Our relations with the Sheikh and the potentialities of the Karun valley demand constant attention from our representative at Mohammerah. The fresh discovery of oil at Ahwaz, the interest taken by the Germans in this neighbourhood, the importance of retain ing control over the Bakhtiaris, the possibilities of railway development, an of the extension of the operations of the Indo-European Telegraph Departmen jn connection with the Ahwaz-Borasjun Telegraph line, all point to the urgen3 e b IJB ;«iil iSi ilk ip ilwl ftii lift yb 0 })Si i: |JS'&gt; 8 l( ; necessity of retaining a representative at this place. Bushire and Shiraz, apart from important local interests, are the winter and summer residence of the Resident and Consul-General who watches our interest in the Gulf, and any abandonment of our position at either of these places would constitute a severe blow to our influence throughout the British sphere. The activity of the Germans must not be overlooked: already it has been proposed by Mr. Marling to establish a Vice-Consulate in Lingah. 6. From the foregoing considerations we are forced to conclude that no reduction in establishments can be effected without serious risk to our political and commercial position, not only in Persia, but in Afghanistan. Events in the former country are now closely observed in the latter. The Afghans appear to have formed the impression that we are about to partition both Persia and Afghanistan with Russia. It is important at the present juncture that, in the absence of urgent and grave reasons for a change, no action should be taken which might lend colour to the interpretation which an intensely suspicious people like the Afghans appear ready to place on the Anglo-Russian Convention.

MESTON.f Confidential.] No. 37-C., dated Meshed, the 28th March 1908. From— Major P. M. Sykes, I.A., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan, Meshed, To—S. H. Butler, Esq., C. I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to forward a copy of a letter from Captain Keyes (No.l9-C. of 14th March 1908), in which that officer recommends the reduction of the Turbat Consulate to a Native Agency. 2. Captain Keyes’ principal arguments are apparently three in number : (a) that the founding of the Consulate was not,fully warranted, (b) that Captain lyass did not acquire an exceptional position at Turbat, and (c) that, if we were to reduce the post to a Native Agency, it would counteract influences adverse to ourselves as well as the present arrangement. 3. To take the first point as set forth in paragraph 9 and elsewhere in the letter under reference, Captain Keyes is aware of nothing that occurred in the way of Russian obstructiveness after the affair of the Patna Nawabs in 1901 when the action taken “practically put an end to the objectionable zeal of the Russian officers.” This and similar passages show that, in Captain Keyes’ opinion, the foundation of the Turbat Consulate was needless. I hardly think that my predecessors would have recommended the establish ment of the Turbat post, or that the Government of India would have incurred the great expenditure involved without carefully examining the question : and this seems to be a sufficient reply to Captain Keyes’ arguments. 4. The position originally held by Captain lyass is also, I think, an acknow ledged fact. Even in distant Kerman Captain lyass was known, and I imagine that the Government of India do not require fresh proof that that official was the uncrowned King of Turbat. So far as Persian public opinion was concerned, even before Captain Keyes’ arrival in Persia, it was a common report that the Czar had said that “ Miller and lyass never sleep”. 5. Captain Keyes recommends the reduction of Turbat to a Native Agency, and thinks that the Meshed Consulate-General could then “ as effectively coun teract the evil effects to British trade and influence caused by the combined Russian Consulate and cordon, as with a Consulate at Turbat,” I can hardly imagine that this argument will commend itself to the Government of India, as, to lay down that a Native Agent can hold his own as effectively as a Consulate provided with a Medical Officer against a Russian official of Captain lyass’ experi ence and ability, who also commands Persian troops, surely needs no refutation. If, however, a parallel be desirable, we have the case of Birjand where a Hospital Assistant was stationed by me in 1899, and where the Government of India is now contemplating the establishment of a Vice-Consulate, presumably on the grounds that a Native Hospital Assistant is not the equal of a British official, 6 Throughout Captain Keyes’ letter there is, in my humble opinion, what has recentlv been termed by His Majesty’s Secretary for Foreign Affairs as “a very intense view of the interests on the spot, which is not easily reconcileable with the larger interests elsewhere ”, I consequently propose to deal with the question in its wider aspect. The Anglo-Russian Convention, which has recently been concluded, ha~, theoretically, put an end to the rivalry of the two powers in Persia; and we ar undoubtedly ready to observe it in the spirit as well as m the letter. Whether our rivals are equally ready to do so remains to be seen. In any case, our sphere in Persia has been made a small one and practically consists of a slice of Eastern Persia with Persian Baluchistan and Kerman. Of these, strategically speaking, I 288 F. D.Eastern Persia is by tar tlie most important, and it behoves us to guarrl ou exiguous sphere by every legitimate means. Can any one then urge that the reduction of Turbat would not weaken our position in Eastern Persia, which consists of a series of centres of British influence, parallel to the Afghan frontier? The answer must surely be in the negative. 7. We next have to consider the point of view of Persians and Afghans Eleven years ago, Sir Mortimer Durand strongly recommended the aboltion of the Resht Consulate as being unnecessary; but the Nasir-ul Mulk was instructed by the then Shah to point out to Lord Salisbury that the effect on Persian opinion would be serious. The post was, consequently, not abolished. When we compare Turbat which is, generally speaking, the touring branch of this Consulate-General and its position with regard to Meshed and Herat, we can easily foresee what Persians and Afghans would think, if Captain Keyes’ proposals were adopted Their immoveable opinion would be that we came to Turbat to show that Captain lyass, in spite of his being in command of Fenian troops, was not the permanent ruler of the district: but that, from some strange infirmity of purpose or from timidity we had shirked the completion of the task, whereas semi-bankrupt Russia allows no signs of relaxing her grasp, even on Southern Persia. True, we might plead the Anglo-Russian Convention: but, to that, the reply would be, “ why has not Russia left Seistan ?” To prove that the Afghans watch keenly our action at Turbat, I need only refer to the Diary of the Native Attache Meshed Consulate-General, on special duty at Herat for the 5th to 18th April kW It shows clearly that evils did exist at that period or two years after the Patna Nawab’s case, and that the Afghans considered the Russian action, which we subsequently checked, to be intolerable. In short, to retire from Turbat so long as the illegal quarantine cordon exists would undoubtedly constitute a heavy blow to British prestige, and one that in my humble opinion, we should have rightly deserved. 8. Another point is that the Government of India are anxious, for obvious reasons, to-secure control of quarantine arrangements on the Perso-Afghan fron tier : but a policy of scuttle or semi-scuttle would surely wreck this scheme or at any rate, make it infinitely more difficult. 9. To conclude, if Russia hands over quarantine arrangements on the Perso- Afghan boundary to us, they must undoubtedly be directed by this Consulate- General, which alone is in touch with the leading Persian officials of Khorasan anrl with the Governor of Herat. Turbat, Karez, aSd Birjand would then beTe Cffief centres from which this quarantine would be worked. If my suggestion that Kain be replaced under Meshed be approved and the question of the frontier be treated as one, I think that the scope of the Turbat Consulate might be enlarged and some expense be saved to Government by placing a medical officer as Vice-Consul at Birjand under the touring Consul at Turbat: but, to reduce Turbat at a time when Persia is in the throes of a revolution and, so long as the Russians maintain t f quarantine cordon would appear to me to be unworthy of the steadfast policy of the Government of India. r J 10.

M Sykes C.M.G., I.A., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General an Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan. of th^tMrstnt 6 T W hiAV n n trUCti T co ? tained “your endorsement No. 21-( 01 the -th instant, I have the honour to submit the following report on the mail tenance of our Consulate at Turbat-i-Haidari. 0 P. I have seen no papers relating to the Russian sanitary cordon from its institution m 1897 till 1901, when the case of the Patna Nawabs again brought e ma ter ^Ro prominence ; nor have I been able to obtain information of any cases of flagrant abuse of power on the part of the Russian officers of the cordon previous to that event. In the files you have sent me I have also fouid no record of any further cases of serious obstruction between 1901 and Captain Winter s arrival here in January 1904, 3. Captain Winter’s instructions contained in the marginally noted letter from the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department were to the effiect that he was to watch and report oh the action of the Russian officers/ and prevent, as far as posable, flagrant abuses on their part, especially as regards the preferential treatment of Persian as against British and Afghan subjects, I understand from these instructions that the British Consul was also to attempt to curtail the influence of the Russian officials in local matters unconnected with their sanitary duties. That this influence was believed to be considerable is shown by Sir Arthur Hardinge’s despatch No. 199 of 9th September 1905, to the Marquess of Lansdowne, in which he alludes to Captain lyass as having been, before Captain Winter’s arrival, “almost a de facto local Governor.” In Captain Winter’s instructions mention was also made of the attempts on Russia’s part to attract the Afghan wool trade direct to Trans Caspia. I have not seen it stated officially, but I understand that this Consulate was never intended to be permanent. 4. I would now submit that the object aimed at in the institution of a tem porary Consulate at Turbat-i-Uaidari, i.e., the prevention of the acquisition of undue influence in sanitary and local matters by the Russian officers of the cordon, and the consequent injury to British trade and influence, has been attained, as completely as is possible by local action, and that all that is now required is an agency to report to His Majesty’s Consul-General any fresh attempts to acquire influence beyond that which might legitimately be expected under the recently concluded Convention. 5. To take the original business of the Sanitary cordon first, I have not been able to obtain information of any flagrant abuses of their position by the Russian officers since the institution of this Consulate ; or, indeed, subsequent to the affair of the Patna Nawabs : the action taken by us in that case having apparently caused the Russian Government to direct their officers to moderate their zeal. The merchants of the place inform me that since Captain Winter’s arrival the examination of caravans has b en conducted with more courtesy, and delays have been less annoying ; but their complaints of the manner of conducting ex amination, prior to this, must seem rather strange to any one who has had the misfortune to make the acquaintance of the Turkish sanitary authorities. The irrelevant questioning of everyone who passes the corckum has also t&amp;ased since Captain lyass completed his Gazetteer, and the inconvenience to the few British caravans proceeding to Meshed is as small as can be, while a cordon exists. On the outbreak of plague in Seistan misdirected zeal and irksome regulations might have been expected; but, considering that Russian doctors are in absolute ignorance of the latest discoveries regarding plague, look on Indian methods as criminally fatalistic and themselves suffer from incredible nervousness, their moderation was surprising. It is also worthy of note that the outbreak of plague at Jangal—within a few miles of the cordon—was dealt with by Captain W atson, without a protest from the Russians. As regards the influence acquired by Captain lyass, nothing I have learnt here warrants the statement that he was almost a de facto local Governor, or that his influence much exceeded that of other Russian Consuls who are able to procure 3the dismissal of officials incurring their displeasure.. The fact,, however, that he has officers and men of the Tehran Brigade and of the local regiments under his orders naturally gives him a certain advantage. • 7, As regards the wool trade, Turbat-i-JHaidari s importance has been trans ferred to Karez, which now has a customs house competent to deal with all business. Although Karez is in the Turbat-i-JIaidari Consular district the British Agent there is directly under the orders of His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed, which, rather than either of these two places, is the centre of the trade. There is not’a single British Indian trader at Turbat-i-Haidari, and the small amount of British goods-that find their way into the districts are purchased through middle men in Meshed or Yezd. / i. r g. To sum up it was the existence of the sanitary cordon in any form to which we objected, not merely to the fact that it was under Russian officials ; but if it were ever expected that our opening a Consulate here would lead Russia to give up the cordon, this hope Should have been abandoned long ago. The question thus resolves itself into whether His Majesty’s Consul General could not, with the assistance of a Native Agent, as effectively counteract the evil effects to British trade and influence caused by the combined Russian Consulate and cordon, as with a Consul. 9. As I have mentioned above, the action taken by us in the affair of the Patna Nawabs practically put an end to the objectionable zeal of the Russian officers. If such a result could be produced before the ratification of the Sanitary Convention of Paris, with Anglo-Russian relations in the state they were in 1901, it is not too much to expect that, now our relations are on a different footing, the Russian Government will not again use the cordon as they did in this one instance. As regards the influence of the Russian Consul, as he now is, in local matters, it must be remembered that seven years ago there was no telegraph line to Turbat- i-Haidari, and local officials and landowners were in almost complete ignorance of the course of events- in other parts of Persia. This has all been altered in the last few years, and public opinion has been so educated that it has been put out of the power of the Russian Consul to obtain the influence he was at one time believed to possess. A British Agent in telegraphic communication with Meshed, 84 miles away, should be able to keep His Majesty’s Consul-General sufficiently informed of the state of affairs here. 10. Should it be decided to reduce this Consulate to an agency, I would suggest that a Muhammadan Hospital Assistant with plague experience be appoint ed as British Agent. From what I have seen of our Indian Hospital Assistants in Persia, I consider that most of them are capable of more than holding their own against Russian doctors. Such a man would be able to carry on the work done by our Consulate Hospital, which has been our chief agent for acquiring the position we now hold in Turbat-i-Haidari; while his professional visits would give him the opportunity of obtaining information inaccessible to the ordinary agent.
