Sir: - r{ With reference to your letter of the 11th. of De cember lust, respecting the discourtesy shown to the officers of His Majesty's Ship 'Lapwing' by the Turkish authorities at El Katif in June last year, I am direct ed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to enclose herein, to be laid before Mr. Secretary Morley copy of a Despatch from His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople on the subject. It will be seen that the present Caimakam of El Katif has received written instructions to tender a for mal apology to the Commander of His Majesty's Ship 'Lapwing', on his next visit, for the discourtesy shown by the previous Acting Caimakam; but Sir N. O'Conor understands that should His Majesty's Government so de sire, the apology will be made to the Commander of the first British warship which may call there. Sir Under Secretary of State India Office. pSir E. Grey is of opinion that if no apology is tendered until the return of His Majesty's Ship 'Lap wing' herself, the incident may by that time be so re mote that the apology will not have due effect locally. He would therefore propose, subject to the concurrence of Mr. Morley, to instruct Sir N. O'Conor to request that the apology shall be made to the Commander of the First British Warship which may touch at El Katif. A similar letter has been addressed to the Admi ralty . I am Sir Your most obedient humble ServantM 30. Jo v 2894 JAN 97 IDORJ Pern, SI January 1908 Tir, I hare received your despatch lTo.507 of Itecember 17 in which you request me to deman from the Porte that a formal apology he made hy the o^fenuinr officials to the Coa.nander of H.M.S.

It is accordingly desirable that the Yali of Bussorah should be instructed by his Government to furnish an open letter to Lieutenant-Commander Gouldsmith, containing peremptory orders to the local officials at El Katif to proceed on board His Majesty’s ship “ Lapwing,” at such a date and hour as may prove convenient to the Officer in Command, and tender a former apology, both in writing and in person, for their previous misconduct.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 353 of the 28th August, I have the honour to forward herewith a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah reporting his representations to the Yali on the subject of the lack of courtesy shown by the Kaimakam of Katif to British naval officers. „ I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O’CONOR. ON receipt to-day of your Excellency’s despatch of the 8th October, concerning the discourteous treatment of British naval officers at Katif by the local authorities, I at once called on the Yali and asked him if he had received the despatch of the Minister of the Interior on the subject. It had not yet reached him. I explained what had occurred, and translated to his Excellency the paragraphs of Lieutenant-Commander Gouldsmith’s letter regarding the treatment he had received. As instructed, I made it clear to him that His Majesty’s Government would not tolerate such discourtesy to British naval officers, and I said that your Excellency desired me to point out that if the Kaimakam was not dismissed or very severely reprimanded, and compelled to apologize in a suitable manner, the matter would become serious. His Excellency expressed his very keen regret that such an incident should have occurred. From Lieutenant-Commander Gouldsmith’s letter it appeared to him that the captain of the port was chiefly to blame in the matter. He said there was no Kaimakam at Katif at the time, but a certain Avni Effendi was then in charge as Acting Kaimakam, with whom he was dissatisfied, and he had since been removed. I remarked that the Acting Kaimakam was apparently cognizant of what was taking place, as he was in his house and close to the landing-stage, and the Com mander of the “Lapwing” had received information that the officials who misbehaved themselves were acting under his orders. His Excellency promised to make a searching inquiry on receipt of the despatch of the Minister of the Interior, and assured me that the guilty parties would be punished.

Turkish Authorities at Katif. 2. I venture with the highest respect to observe that the course recom mended by His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India and adopted by His Ma jesty’s Minister for Foreign Affairs seems mainly to animadvert upon the conduct of the Turkish Representative at Katif, as a procedure which “ practically amounted to sheltering the pirate ” Ahmed bin Salman; and no steps appear to have been authorised in the direction of obtaining any apology or reparation locally for the affront offered to the Commander of one of His Majesty s Ships in person. The intimate association which necessarily exists between the Naval Autho- _ rities and the Resident in the task of maintaining our prestige and influence in the Persian Gulf will I hope be accepted as my excuse or justification for ex pressing the feeling that the local aspect of a humiliating incident has, in this case, hardly received the consideration which it deserved at the hands of His Majesty’s Government. As the Government of India are aware, in the course of official cooperation, f ^ Commanders of His Majesty’s Ships are often called upon in the interests of the service, to act emergently on requisitions from the Resident, in anticipation o the Admiral’s concurrence*. The steps authorised by His Majesty’s Government in the present case afford little or no practical guarantee to any one with local experience of T . u [ kl sn methods in these waters, that His Majesty’s Ship would not be treated with the same contumely if she were to visit Katif again in the immediate future. I should certainly hesitate greatly to ask any Commander to place himself in such a po sition, and cannot doubt but that an officer with a humiliating and unexpiated experience in his mind, such as that possessed by Commander Gouldsmith ot. His Majesty’s Ship “ Lapwing,” would be extremely loth to repeat the expfeat* ment. 3. I venture therefore respectfully to ask the Government of India, in order that the dignity of their subsidised ships may be maintained, to consider the ex pediency of asking His Majesty’s Government to induce the Porte to arrange for the accord of some overt local act of apology for the affront offered to His Majesty’s Ship ' Lapwing.” ^ ' I am unaware of the view, which His Excellency the Naval Commander-in« Chief may entertain on this point, but subject to them it would seem t0 ra ®. a conveniet and suitable solution if the Wali of Bussorah were instnmted by ms Government to furnish an open letter to Lieutenant-Commander Gouldsmith, containing peremptory orders to the offending officials at Katif to procee on board His Majesty’s Ship Lapwing ” and offer a formal apology both in writing, j and in person for his previous discourtesy..

The Sublime Porte will recollect that the facts con cerning this pirate were brought to its notice by His Ma jesty* s Embassy on the 18th of September last, when the hope was expressed that the Commander of the ■Lapwing' might count on the cooperation of the Ottoman Authorities in the accomplishment of his duty.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that owing to the very serious outbreak of plague at Bahrein, 1 am anxious to avoid as far as possible sending a Man-of-War there this year. I should be much obliged if you would kindly inform me of the exact state of affairs there, as up to the present 1 have had no official account of the extent to which the disease is spreading. I should also like to know whether the pearling fleet intend going out as usual. Should they do so and should the plague break out among them while at sea, a very serious state of affairs would probably ensue, as whole boats’ crews would probably be swept off at a time and we should have craft with plague* stricken corpses in them drifting about the Gulf. If it becomes absolutely necessary to send a ship to protect them I _ would propose that she should make Bushire her head-quarters, and while cruising in Bahrein Waters she should communicate with no one, but merely show the flag among the pearl banks, and to a certain extent in the waters between Bahrein and the Mainland.

It is not advisable nor is it desired by the Senior Naval Officer that you should touch at Bahrein or have contact with pearling dhows, but without having actual contact you may be able to obtain information at Katif or from dhows met with on the banks, as to the progress of the pearling season and the extent to which it is being hampered by piague ; and 1 shall be glad of any news you may be able to bring me on this head.

Sir, In pursuance of your orders of 18th June 1907, I have the honour to report that on Thursday, the 20th June, I spoke with several dhows on the Aboakul and Shagata banks, and gained information that no cases of plague were on board any of the dhows on these banks, and that the pearling season so far is not good owing to the bad weather. No information as to the whereabouts of Ahmed bin Selman could be obtained. I therefore proceeded to the anchorage off Katif (7 miles from the town). 2. The following morning Lieutenant Roberts and myself landed to pay a friendly visit to the Sheikh on Tarut Island, but could gain no information. I also asked several dhows in the harbour with the same result. We then landed at Katif; took donkeys to the gate of the town where we were met by the Port Officer and the Customs Authority. We were insolently informed by these officials, who caught hold of our donkeys’ heads, turned them to the beach again, also hustling both donkeys and ourselves, that we were not allowed to land, or see the 1 urkish Kaimmakam without written authority from Bassora or Constan tinople. We then informed them that we would wait in the boat whilst they informed the Kaimmakam that we wished to pay him a friendly visit, but they told us that he would not see us, and they also refused to convey my message to him. 3. By appearances I should judge that the orders for us not to land or pay a visit to the Kaimmakam had been given by his orders, as his house is situated by the landing place, and from information received, he was at home, and these instructions came from him. As the officials were so hostile to us, we embarked for our ship again. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, A. N. GOULDSMITH, Lieut.-Commander. Major P.

With reference to paragraph 2 of my letter No.^2205, dated 16th September 1 ( .;06, on the subject of the pirate Ahmed bin Selman, I have the honour to forward, for information, copies of the letters which passed between myself and Sheikh Jasim bin Thani, together with a copy of letter No. 499, dated 16th November 1906, from the Political Agent, Bahrein, to my address, on the same subject. Dated the 25 th September 1906 . From— Major P. Z.Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To —Sheikh Jasim bin Thani, Lusail. After compliments. —I trust that since I had the pleasure of seeing you in Lusail in May last, you have been enjoying good health, and that your eyes no longer give you any trouble. You will not have forgotten that my object in visiting you then apart from the pleasure of meeting and conversing with you, was to warn yourself and your sons of the rumours abroad regarding the intentions of the pirate Ahmed bin Selman, and to ask your co-operation in suppressing him and request you to give your sons and dependents injunctions to have nothing to do with him. After seeing you I went on to Doha and Wakra, although you said your son Abdullah was probably absent in the interior, to leave word with the people of those places to the same effect. In spite of this, however, I now learn with much surprise that he, Ahmed, has recently appeared without fear in Doha, and that while your son Abdullah did not receive him or have anything to do with him, nevertheless your relative Abdullah bin Ghanam received him and harboured him. After hearing your expressions of friendliness and goodwill, this news has much disappointed me, and I fear that my Government will be vexed when the information reaches them. Before they refer to me in the matter, I trust you will see fit to explain to me the meaning of Addullah bin GhananPs conduct, and to inform me what action you propose to take in the direction of punishing him. I have always spoken well of you and your family to my Government. What advantage will you derive from giving them cause to have a bad opinion of you and your sons from their association with such notorious evil-doers as Ahmed bin Selman? You are well aware from old time that the primary object of the British Government is to maintain absolute peace and security on the sea, so that all the natives of the littoral may trade without fear. If persons in the position of yourself and your sons harbour and entertain the evil-doers, how can there be peace ? Such conduct will bring trouble upon all. I look forward to receiving an early reply from you and trust that the answer will be such as to please me. Forwarded through the Political Agent, Bahrein, with Residency No. 2264, dated 25th Septemher 1906. No. 499 , dated Bahrein, the 16 th November 1906 . From— Captain F. B. Prideaux, Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to your letter No. 2264, dated the 25th September 1906, with which you enclosed a letter to be forwarded to Sheikh Jasim bin lhani on the subject of the pirate Ahmed bin Selman’s surprise-visit to Doha, I have the honour to enclose, with a translation, the reply which Sheikh Jasim has transmitted to me for you.2 2. The Sheikh affirms in his letter that the pirate did not stay a day in Doha. My Interpreter, Mr. Inam-al Hak, however, reports that in the course of his recent visit to Lusail and Doha (which port he w as compelled to visit to get a passage bnck to .Bahrein), he learnt confidentially from reliable sources that the pirate had undoubtedly stayed three days in the house of Khalid-Al Ghanam (a brother of Abdallah), though he arrived there stealthily and threw On himself on his host’s mercy, declaring that he was absolutely without provisions. On the third day, it is said, Khaiid gave the pirate a bag of rice and some money, with a warning to disappear, as he was in danger of being arrested. There is no evidence that Sheikh Abdallah bin Jasim was privy to his cousin Khaiid’s conduct. 3 . In the circumstances, I recommend that no further notice be taken of the incident. Translation of a letter from Sheikh Jasim bin Thani&gt; to Major P. Z. Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated ' lath October 1906. After compliments. —It was the happiest of hours when I received your kind letter, dated the aad 1 rea(i it praising God for your good health and condition. I have been informed of what was contained in your letter. As about your enquiry after my health, this is due to your good self, and I thank God (besides whom there is no other God) that I am in the best of health and peace, and enquire (firstly) of no other thing but your health. Next, as about Ahmad as Selman, you heard that became to Doha and that my son Abdallah rejected him and did not receive him, and that he put up with Abdallah A 1 Ghanam. The said Ahmad as Selman, it is true, secretly entered borders of the town, but as soon as my son Abdallah heard of this, he sent men (after Ahmed bin Selman) to arrest him and tie him down. He (the pirate) felt that Abdallah’s servants were after him, and he hid himself with people out side the town, and they dressed him in a woman’s dress and let him flee at night, and by God he did not st;iy a day. Let not the meaning of interested people be hidden from you. As for me, I, Jasim, by God ! if it be in my power to arrest him, I will send him over to you. This person we have exc &gt;mmunicated since the time evil emanated from him. He does not come to the side (of country) we inhabit and ever since our being we have never harboured a mischievous person and evil doer, nor do we deal in a thing which annoys the High British Government. Insha-allah j we shall always remain custodians of truth and friendship. This is what was necessary to inform you.No. 2258, dated Bushire, the 25th September 1906. From— Major P. Z.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Foreign Department ,/r^ Endorsement No. 3687-E.B., dated 12th September 1906, giving cover to a des- ( 3 ^ 1 patch (No. 471, dated 10th July 1906) from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople to the Foreign Office, on the subject of a visit recently paid to A 1 Bidaa by Captain Prideaux and myself. 2. Major Nimet Effendi’s account is not so fantastic as these Turkish reports generally are, but it may be as well for me to mention that Sheikh Jasim bin Thahi had informed us the day before that his son Abdullah was away in the interior in connection with a caravan robbery, and this we found to be the case. Major^ Nimet Effendi having sent down a representative to meet us with an invitation to come and see him, I saw no reason to refuse, and found him very pleasant and hospitable I informed him of the rumours which were abroad regarding Ahmed bin Selman and said I had come to warn Sheikh Jasim and his sons of their obligation to suppress the pirate. So far Major Nimet Effendi’s report is correct but the language which he claims to have held with us about the necessity of consulting the Wali, etc., is purely imaginative. As the Government of India are aware from Captain Prideaux’s recent reports, Ahmed bin Selman had since appeared fearlessly in Doha of A 1 Bidaa, and was allowed to depart in peace. G. C.

I am addressing a friendly remonstrance to Sheikh Jasim bin Thani, on learning the fact that the pirate was entertained by one of his relations and that his son made no attempt to capture him. I do not think it would be politic to do more than that at the present junc ture. Nor would it be advisable to recognise the Turkish position at A 1 Bidaa in any way, by making a communication to the Porte on the subject; but as a proof of the fact that the Turks do nothing to help us in coping with piracy, occasion might arise when it would be useful to us to quote the fact that this notorious pirate does not hesitate to stroll into a port where they are by way of maintaining a garrison. No. 407,dated Bahrein, the 10th September 1906. From— Captain F. B. PrideauX, Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to this ofhce Diary Entries Nos. 163,168 and 174, dated respectively the 9th, 16th and 21st July 1906, I have honour to report that about 3 weeks ago the definite news was brought to Bahrein that Ahmad bin Salman the pirate had come to Doha in Katar. 2. He first went to Sheikh Abdallah bin Jasim, the local headman, but the latter refused to entertain him and he then went to another member of the Bin Thani family, Shaikh Abdallah bin Ghanam, who received him more or less hospitably and apparently meant to allow him to stay as long as the pirate wished. 3. I communicated the information I had received to the Commander of H. M. S. a Redbreast, ” who went as soon as possible to the Katar Pearl- banks, remaining there a few days, and then returned to Bahrein. 4. I am informed that Ahmad bin Salman’s presence in Doha has caused a good deal of anxiety among the Bahrein pearlers, but in my opinion it is not likely that the pirate will commit piracy on the Pearl*banks east of the peninsula as he know r s that the consequences may be serious for his Katar friends if he does. 5. There is no doubt that the presence of H. M. S. “ Redbreast ” in these waters has had a very pacifying effect and that it was extremely necessary, but I fear that there is as little likelihood as ever of the pirate’s dropping into our hands, until the Naval authorities can make arrangements for boats to cruize unawares along the shores of the mainland.M ^ In any further communica tion on tkis iubject, please quote Vo. llO~J and address The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

He also reports that Pin deinan's followers are deserting him. It appears that after seizing the first boat, he attacked another which carried 15 armed men. They returned his fire wounding Pin Selman himself slightly, and killing one of his followers. Pin Selman then returned to Parr al Tharan (about IB miles South Eastward of El Katif) and allowed the prisoners taken in his first attack to return to Bahrein in their boat. lc e Admiral -ir Edmund S.Poe X.C.V.O., - Commander-in-Chief, His own people being very angry at their H.LI.Ships &amp; Vessels, HAST INDIES.their feilure to secure any plunder, and having been for ^ two days without food then deserted him saying they would have nothing more to ao with his expeait ions. k x * * * Next norning (27th July) I proceeded to Hen,ism where I anchored at 10.30 a.m. 10.- There have been several more vague rumours as to the Persian Governor General's visiting Hen,jam, but he has not yet appeared and I do not think he wili do so un+il the final settlement as to the ownership of the island is arrived at. ***** I left Hen.jam for Pasidu 31st July arriving there the sane evening.

Seeing that this person is a native of Bahrein, a cousin of the Sheikh of Bahrein, and domiciled and resident with his family at Bahrein, it is not improbable that he attacks vessels from there when occasion offers. This person has been condemned by default in the Criminal Court of Nejd to fifteen years’ imprisonment, and the authorities of Katif are endeavouring to eradicate him, but as he does not come to that neighbourhood he might easily be captured if search were made for him by the authorities of Bahrein.” I have, &amp;c.

WllH reference to my despatch No. 843 of the 27th November last, I have the honour to report that I learnt through a secret and confidential source that the Ottoman Ministry of M ai has lately received despatches from Moustafa Hilmi Bey, Commandant of Nejd, calling attention to the visits of British ships of war to the Katr Coast. Hilmi Bey refers to a previous report sent in October last, in which he announced the arrival of His Majesty’s ship “ Sphinx ” at Ojeir and Katif with the British Consul (sic) at Bahrein on board, and their meeting with the Kaimakam of Katif, and to a later despatch of March of this year, in which he had reported that the “ Consul ” had again come in a ship to the Katr Coast, and on certain pretences had taken with him certain Sheikhs, and had used threats to Ottoman subjects, and was endeavouring to disturb the minds of the population. The Commandant has forwarded a letter from Major Nimet Effendi of the drd Battalion of the 43rd Regiment at Katr, of which the following is a translation :— “ On Thursday morning at one o’clock (Turkish) the 28th instant, o.s. (presumably May), a two-funnelled British steamer arrived and anchored ten minutes’ distance out. An officer was sent to make inquiries, but at the same time the steamer’s boat come to the shore with the Naibs of Bushire and Bahrein, the captain and a dragoman. On being asked why they had come they replied that they had business with Sheikh Abdullah. They were requested to address themselves to me, and after they had rested a little we discussed matters. They said they had been the day before to Sheikh Jasim-eth-Thani and had the intention of touching at other places on the coast, their object being to warn the Sheikhs to put down the piratical acts of Ahmed-es- Selman. We conversed in suitable language, and I pointed out to them that it was not proper that they should come without orders, and that in such matters they should have consulted the A r ali and act according to his instructions ; they then returned to the steamer, which left. From the inquiries which I made, both open and secret, it appears that their object was to force the Sheikhs to put down these piracies or else to give them a document stating that they were powerless to do so, which would be undesirable, as your Excellency will admit.” Moustafa Hilmi Bey confirming the statements of Major Nimet Effendi states that it is essential that the persons arrested on account of Ahmed-es-Selman’s piracies should be punished so as to afford no scope for such intervention. Bin Na-zra and the negro, Salim, two of the pirate’s companions had been arrested at Katif, but though Salim avowed his guilt, as proved by the papers sent to the Mutessarif, the latter ordered him to be released. The Commandant of Nejd further complains that the Mutessarif has given no effect to his request for the despatch of the Turkish gun-boat “ Kilid-el-Bahr ” to patrol the coast so as to deprive the English of their excuse for interfering, and he concludes his report by again requesting instructions as to how he is to act with regard to such foreigners who arrive on the coast. 1 think it is probable that the somewhat vague complaints made to you by the Turkish Ambassador on the 14th ultimo, as reported in your despatch No. 250 of the 21st ultimo, relative to certain alleged proceedings of the British Agent at Bahrein may have been based upon the reports received by the Sublime Porte from the Turkish military authorities in the Persian Gulf, respecting the visits of His Majesty’s ships to the coast between Bahrein and Koweit, of which the despatches whicli I have quoted above from the Commandant of Nejd and the Major commanding the troops at Katr may be taken as specimens.

Due notice of the visit was given to the Kairaakam who raisw no objection whatever and received the British officers with great hospitality. There is clearly no foundation for the report that any explorations were rcado in the neighbourhood as both Captain Prideaux and Commander Bowraan remain- ca in the Kaimaksn’s house during the whole of their stay at Katif and did not even walk through the town.

His Majesty's Embassy understood that orders were thereupon telegraphed to the Vaii of Basra in structing him to act in conformity with this request andana cua not fail duly to inform Hie Majeety'e Government of the aeeurance given to them by the Sublime Porte. Hie Majeety’e Embaeey regrets to etaoe however that up to the present moment these asearaaces have not only remained a ueao letter but that Ahmed bin Selm&amp;n has since cotiultted two fresh acta of piracy. It appears that on one icoth anu 26th of June last he ana eight companions seized a Tarut fishing boat in Rufeu Bay on the East of Tarut Islanu. They com pelled the crew oi three men to wotk one coat anu sailed her to Fasht-al-Jarnu a few miles North of Bahrein. Here they attacked a large boat which had been sent out by a Bahrein merchant to buy pearls from one uiveis ana killed one man, mortally wounding another who afterwards men and seriously injuring two more. They carried off the pearling beat together with the second son of tne owner ana also pearls ana cash to the value of several thousand rupees. b Tne British Agent at Banrein subsequently called on the Kaimmakam of Katif ana endeavoured to persuaae himhim to ettect one piraoes* capture, hut irom iater information it appears that the latter has net taken any efficacious measures with that object. Under these circumstances His Majesty's Embassy is constrained once more to draw the serious atten tion ol the Sublime Porte oo tins matter ana to re quest that prompt measures may be ta^en to secure the punishment of the pirate chief and hie associates ana that due compensation may be pain to British sub jects for the losses suetamea by them in conse quence of Ahmed bin Selman'e acts of piracy which are aue to the supinenesSof the Ottoman authorities ana the failure of the Imperial Government to maintain proper police supervision in the Persian Gulf.[This Document ia the Property of His Bril iq Majesty s Government] v AEABTA.

I LEAI 1 N from a very confidential source that, according to information which lias reached the Imperial Ottoman Government, the Vali of Bussorah has received two telegrams from the Kaimakam of Katif and Mansour Pasha, employe of the Civil List, stating that the condition of the caza is very disturbed, and the population is entirely abandoning it. Ihe Vali observes that as these telegrams have been sent via Bushire and Eao, the contents are necessarily known abroad; yet though he has appealed twenty-one times for steps to be taken for the defence of the coast and for the adoption of the necessary measures nothing has been done, and the state of affairs is getting more and more serious.

In continuation of my telegram, dated 27th instant, I have the honour to forward copies of correspondence which has passed in connection with the subject dealt with in my letter No. 421, dated and September, to your address, namely the delivery of a slave to the Kaimakam of Katif.

Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— Captain F. B. Prideaux, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrein. I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 261, dated 10th August, report ing another piracy by some of Ahmed-bin-Selman’s gang. The Government of India was informed and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, asked to continue pressing the Turkish authorities. I also addressed the Senior Naval Officer with a view to H. M. S. “ Lapwing” being sent up if possible on her arrival at Muscat where she was very shortly expected. That vessel however being delayed, Captain Bowman has been good enough to return with H. M. S. “ Sphinx ” and should now be with you. 3 2. Your recent commendable personal efforts to circumvent these pirates were duly communicated to Government. Unfortunately they have not yet been crowned with success, but it is very necessary that we with the help and advice of the Commanders of His Majesty’s ships, should persevere in the endeavour to check the piracies, and pending any sanction that may ultimately be accorded for arming a dhow or supervising an armed dhow, I think the knowledge on the Arab coast that a man-of-war was on the spot would have a deterrent effect in lawless quarters, and that H. M. S. Sphinx ” might usefully cruise in the vicinity of the pearl banks and keep herself in evidence. 3. It might do good too if you were to proceed to Katif in her and have a friendly interview with the Kaimakam in order to see what he is doing in the direction of Ahmed-bin-Selman’s capture. C528FDPlease consult Captain Bowman fully and use your discretion in arranging with him for taking advantage of the “ Sphinx’s ” presence in the way that is most likely to have practical effect.

The Resident desires me to suggest to you that when you visit Katif it may be possible to recover that slave who was handed over to the Kaimakam by Sheikh Esa. 7 No. 325, dated the aist September 1905. From— Captain F. B Prideaux, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In compliance with the instructions contained in the 3rd paragraph of your letter No. 1307, dated the 7th September 1905, I have the honour to report that I proceeded to Katif in H. M. S. “ Sphinx ” and had a long interview with the Kaimakam in company with Commander Bowman, R. N., on the 16th instant. 2. We did not go earlier to Katif as the new Kaimakam Mahomed Nejib Bey had only passed through Bahrein on the 9th instant, when he transferred himself direct from the mail steamer to a sailing boat in this harbour. I there fore thought it necessary to write to him in advance giving notice of my intention to visit him, so that he might make himself acquainted with the subjects that were likely to be mooted between us. A copy of my letter No. 314, dated the nth September 1905, is attached for your information. 3 The “Sphinx ” was anchored to the south of Tarut Island and about 74 miles from the Katif landing-place and the state of the tides necessitated our making an early start for the shore and remaining there all day. Commander Bowman and I therefore left the ship at about 6-15 A M., and reached the landing stage at 7-30 A^M., being met there by the Kaimakam, the principal military officers and a number of local notables who were introduced to us as members of the Kaimakam’s Council. We were at once conducted to the house at the shore-end of the pier where a guard of honour saluted us, and then we went upstairs into the room where visitors are always located, followed by the officers and Councillors to the number of about 12 or 15 persons. 4. We first informed the Kaimakam that we had come to consult with him as to how the pirates might be hunted down, and on this subject Nejib Bey's replies were not very satisfactory. He declared that he was doing his utmost to suppress the institution himself, but admitted that at the present moment he had no idea as to where the pirates were. He objected, however, to our offer to co-operate with Turkish troops on the coast of the mainland or in Turkish waters and I did not press the point much knowing that to do so would be quite futile, and that my other business might be adversely prejudiced in consequence. It seemed to me that the Kaimakam’s language was chosen to some extent for the benefit of the gallery, and accord ingly when the discussion of the pirates was concluded, I suggested that the rest of our interview might be held in greater privacy as though none of our conversa tion was too confidential for the Councillors’ ears, it was to be presumed that if the Kaimakam desired their advice on any point, he would prefer to seek it out of our presence. I further remarked that I considered my dignity entitled me to make the claim. After demurring a little, the Kaimakam took his Council outside, and a few minutes later he returned with one Councillor only besides his interpreter whose presence was essential as Nejib Bey speaks no language except Turkish. He then remarked that the room had been getting unbearably hot, and l think that he was rather pleased to have his superiority over the Councillors thus emphatically called attention to.5 - Before leaving the subject of the pirates I should state that the Kaima- i kam himself was the first to refer to the slave, Salim bin Mubarak, saying that the man had been released from jail and was at my disposal on my giving a receipt in writing for him, and adding that he quite concurred in the opinion I had expressed as to the man’s innocence. Salim was thereupon forthwith pro* duced, and he was subsequently given a passage to Bahrein in H. M. S. “ Sphipx ” and a paper of freedom under the General Act of the Brussels Con vention by Commander Bowman, to protect him from any claims of the Beni Hajir or others in future. 6. The other subjects which I discussed with the Kaimakam were the claims of the Bunniahs against the Katif Customs Farmers and the cases of certain Turkish and Bahrein subjects, who after incurring commercial liabilities with British subjects in Bahrein had absconded to Katif and whose return for the trial of their cases by the Commercial Mejlis of Bahrein I desired. 7 In the first of these matters, as reported separately in my letter No. 324* dated the 20th September 1905, nothing was effected owing to the absence of the Head of the Customs Firm from Katif; in the other cases it was settled that I should apply in writing for the extradition of each absconder separately with the details of the claims against them, but as the Kaimakam and his two companions asserted emphatically that no special extradition arrangements existed between Bahrein and Katif, such as exist between Bahrein and the independent Arab ports in the Gulf I do not think that any Turkish subjects will be extradited without pressure from Basrah and I am very doubtful even as to whether any Bahreinis will be returned. In the course of our conversation on this subject, the Turkish Interpreter, who was one of the Senior Military Officers in the Port, enquired why the 200 deserters from the Turkish Army now settled in Bahrein were never given up, and I replied that I have never heard of their extradition having been applied for. On the subject of the absconded merchants I shall report again later when the replies of the Kaimakam to my applications have been received. On several occasions during our interview Captain Bowman and I noticed the surprisingly frank references made by the Kaimakam to the suzerainty of Great Britain over Bahrein, and I am therefore hopeful that my letters to Nejib Bey will at least not be ignored, as has hitherto been my experience in my corre spondence with the Turkish officials of Hasa and Katif. The Kaimakam’s civility may possibly be partly due to the fact of his being a native of Diarbekr, where I 1 understand half the population is Christian, and to his long official service of 37 years during which' he has doubtless met many British Consular officers. 8. At 2 P.M we were entertained to a very substantial lunch, at the con clusion of which we would have been glad to have been left to ourselves for a few hours, but on my suggesting that the Governor must have plenty of other work to attend to, and saying that we would gladly excuse him from keeping us company any longer, His Excellency replied that if he had any work to do, he would preferably attend to it at midnight rather than part from us before our boat came in, so that we were perforce compelled to keep up a desultory con versation with the old gentleman and the various subordinate officials who con tinually came to and fro, until 6-30 P.M. ! At 4 P.M. we suggested a walk through the town, but the proposal was not well received, and as I did not wish that attention should be drawn to the fact that I was neither a regular Consular officer nor the possessor of a passport to enter Turkey, we at once let the matter drop. In the future, however, if no Consular officer is appointed to Hasa and I am expected periodically to visit Katif I think that some special arrangement should be made i under which I may be permitted to move freely in and around the town and even to spend some weeks there annually, specially during the date purchasing season ; 1 without such an arrangement it is quite impossible for our traders to obtain fair play from the two leading Mohammedan merchants, who if they could settle their private feud would be practically autocrats of the oasis. 9. On taking our leave we were accompanied to the end of the landing stage by the Kaimakam and the whole assembly of officials as well as the guard of honour. We did not reach the ship until 9 P.M. as the tide and wind wereboth strongly against us. On the whole I think our visit was decidedly a success, for apart from the recovery of the slave Salim, which has pleased the people of Bahrein, I believe that the knowledge that the “ Sphinx ” is remaining in these waters for some time to come will spur the Kaimakam to his greatest possible effort to capture Ahmed bin Selman. The Basrah authorities have undoubtedly urged Nejib Bey to do his utmost in this direction and he is willing to respond, but unfortunately the military and subordinate officials are apathetic and it remains to be seen whether the present Governor will attain any greater success than did his predecessors who undoubtedly all succumbed to the influence and bribes of the pirate s friends. One of the last acts of the late acting Kaimakam, 1 hear, was to release the 4 Bedouin (but not their Sheikh Tami bin Taza), who had been arrested on suspicion of being accomplices of Ahmed bin Selman, at a ransom of Rs. 300 per man.

After compliments.—\n continuation of my letter No. 286, dated the 19 th Jamadi ai Than; 1323, to y 0ur Excellency’s predecessor on the subject of Salim bin Mubarak, the escaped slave of the pirate Ahmed bin Selman, I have the honour to inform you that l have learn, from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah that His Excellency the VVali of Basrah has desired you to return the slave to Bahrein at your earliest convenience. I hope that as soon as you have leisure to attend to this case you will do what is needful in the matter. In the mean while it is only necessary to remind you that His Britannic Majesty’s Ambas sador at Constantinople has requested the Government of the Sublime Porte to hold your predecessor and yourself personally responsible for the kind treatment of Salim bin Mubarak. 2. With regard to the general question of piracy in addition to the case of the “ Shuei ” which I mentioned in my last letter as having attacked the boat of Abdul Latif bin Habib about 5 weeks ago, I have just received fresh information to the effect that a party of Beni Hajir are now at sea, with piratical intentions. To consult with you personally as to the best measures to be adopted for the suppression of this nuisance, I intend to give myself the pleasure of visiting you at Katif next Friday, the fg^^-^ber'iQos Britannic Majesty’s ship “ Sphinx ”, weather permitting. I earnestly hope that your Excellency’s term of office as Governor of Katif will witness the fulfilment of our Governments’ desires in this connection, and that the prosperity of the trade between your district and Bahrein and India will continue to increase. 3. I may mention that the ” Sphinx ” has come here direct from Maskat which she left on the with a clean Bill of Health, so that your Quarantine Officer will doubtless give us “ free pratique ” when we arrive in your harbour.

Simla, the 31 st August 1905 . Sib., With reference to His Excellency the Viceroy’s telegram of 22 nd July 1905 , we have the honour to transmit, for your information, copies of corre- - - - — spondence, as marked in the margin, relative to a recrudes cence of piracy under the leader ship of Ahmad-bin-Selman in the vicinity of Bahrein. Attention is invited to the fresh evidence of the complicity of the 1 — A. ^ ... A-■ ^m i a r'. Vv &gt;-v a .'wnii w* i’s I 4-of r\ Txr o r I f \ y* r\nc*r4 ttz-x »-• local Turkish authorities which has been accumulated since we addressed you on 8th December last, and especially to the statement of Salem-bin-Mubarak, an escaped slave of the pirate, corroborated in certain details by the son of the owner of one of the attacked boats, which confirms us in our view that Ahmad-bin-Selman is allowed to live undisturbed in Turkish territory and to make it the base of his piratical attacks. 3 . At the present moment when the Political Agent at Bahrein is endeavouring to acquire influence over Sheikh Esa, in accordance with the scheme laid before you in our Secret despatch No. 85 , dated the 21 st April 1904 , it is in our opinion highly important that we should be in a position to guarantee to the latter the safety of his subjects while engaged in maritime trade, especially as the Sheikh is specifically bound by his Treaty obligations to refrain from reprisals. It is understood that a Pro-Memorid was presented to the Porte in January last, demanding energetic measures for the suppression of Ahmad-bin-Selman’s piracies, as well as for the restoration to the victims of the value of the property plundered; and we would request to be informed whether any assurances have been received in reply, or any steps taken by the Turkish Government to indicate that they realise the gravity of the situation. 4. The proceedings described in the correspondence now submitted show clearly how much the Political Officer at Bahrein is hampered by not having at his own disposal some suitable vessel with which he can ward off and punish such small piratical attacks in the neighbourhood of the island as do not warrant an appeal to the Senior Naval Officer for the despatch of a gun-boat, and we would, therefore, urge the advisability of supplying him at an early date with2 the special vessel to which reference was made in our Marine despatch No. 8 of 3 rd November 1904, regarding the future sphere of operations of the subsidised ships in Indian waters. We have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servants, / &lt; t tyz-V6. In very dilatory fashion the 3 boats were got ready, and on the afternoon of the 28th June, I went on board accompanied by my interpreter and the Jemadar and 12 sepoys of the Agency Guard. There were 20 Arabs in my ‘ Mashuwa ’ and about 25 in each of the other two. 7. In the course of the next three days we searched the coast of the mainland from Dohat Ain A 1 Seh to Ras Tanura, omitting the Katif Oasis, and if the wind had not been extremely unfavourable we would have gone still further north. In the circumstances, however, we turned back from this point and sailed into Katif harbour, where I interviewed the Kaim Makam Ibrahim Effendi as related in the memorandum which accompanies this report. I found the Kaim Makam very civil in his attitude, though the Senior Military Officer was inclined to be discourteous and was very officious in his enquiries as to my right to bring my 3 ‘ Mashuwas ’ into Katif harbour. 8. One of the leading Arabs on board my vessel had a wife and house at Darein, the place on Tarut Island which commands the south entrance to Katif. Opposite this place, therefore, he waded ashore, and at the time of my departure from Katif he returned with the information that the Kaim Makam had only sent out his search-boat after hearing that I had started from Bahrein, and that besides doing this he had imprisoned the father-in-law of Ahmed bin Selman who is a notable of the Beni Hajir tribe, and was opportunely found in the town of Katif. This fact was concealed from me by the Kaim Makam probably because the Sheikh would eventually be allowed to buy his liberty. My inform ant also reported that the pirates were believed still to be in the vicinity of Bahrein either on the Katr Coast or that of Dthaharan, south of Katif. I, therefore, decided to return to Bahrein and to ask the Chief to get more definite information before I set out again. 9. Sheikh Isa talks a good deal about the rapidity with which he would destroy the pirates if he were given a free hand by Government, but my obser vations incline me to think that his servants are not whole-hearted in their desire to fall in with them. On the recent expedition I advised the three Commanders of the Mashuwas to cover as wide an area as possible each day, but found that they persisted in keeping together in spite of all that I said. A better result would probably be obtained if a few blue-jackets were sent out in each Mash uwa to cruise separately within defined limits for a lengthened period, but even then it will be very difficult to prevent the pirates escaping ashore if the identity of our boats is suspected. Our best chance of ending the career of Ahmed bin Selman I think lies in the Government of India setting a price of Rs. 1,000 or Rs. 1,500 on his head, and if this were done I believe the desired €^€0^ would soon be achieved, as there is probably no one who would take up the quarrel to make a blood-feud of it. Memorandu?n, translation of which in Arabic was given by Captain F. B&lt; Prideaux to the Kami Makam of Katif on the 1st July 1905, At the request of the Kaim Makam of Katif I write the following memoran- dum regarding my visit to Katif. I left Bahrein on the afternoon of Wednesday the 28th June 100=; in com pany 3 boats (Mashuwas) manned by the Sheikh of Bahrein, to search for the pirate Ahmed bin Selman on the high seas. We first proceeded southward^ and slowly in consequence of the winds being unfavourable, worked northward's with many tackings, from Dohat Ain A1 Seh as far as Ras Tanura. We arrived at the latter place about mid-day on the 1st July, and in this space of time only fell in with two suspicious looking Mashuwas which however turned out to be innocently engaged. To-day on account of the northwind having increased consmerably in yehemence, and as I found myself comparatively close to Katif I deemed to visit this port in order to learn the latest news from the Kaim Makam, and to hear the details of the first attack made by the pirate upon a Katif boat. r On arriving m the harbour, I sent a messenger to the landing-place to ask permission for me to land and visit the Kaim Makam, On permission beinggranted I came ashore with a small retinue composed of my interpreter, the Indian officer of my escort, the Nakhodas of the 3 boats (as representatives of Sheikh Isa), and 4 other men—their followers—who punted my boat ashore, The Kaim Makam had little information to give me except that he a/so had sent a boat out in search of the pirate, and was making all possible efforts to effect his capture. He agreed with me on the question of the Turkish and British Governments being both equally desirous of putting an end to the career of this pirate, and kindly promised that if he ever again heard of Ahmed bin Selman starting oat to commit piracy, he would himself at once give me timely information. * 1 I availed myself also of this convenient opportunity to discuss two other subjects in which the Government of India are much interested, vis., the chances of the Behaih murderers of Sheikh Selman bin Diaij being captured, and the claims of certain Bunniahs for refunds of customs dues paid in excess, I am hopeful of considerable benefit accruing to the two Governments from this personal meeting between the Kaim Makam and myself.[Confidential.] No. 360, dated Eushire, the 30th July (received 7th August) 1905.

In continuation of my covering letter No. 329, dated 15th July, I have th e •Bahrein No. 243, dated 22nd July 1905. honour tO forward 3 . copy of a further communication * received from the Politi cal Agent, Bahrein, on the subject of Ahmed bin Selman’s piracies. 2. After writing his first letter No. 220, Captain Prideaux sent me, demi- officially on 8th July, some suggestions for circumventing the pirates, which were to the effect that if a man-of-war was available at Bushire, it might hire and take over two Persian native craft and, placing some blue-jacketsln them, cruise along the Coast to the north and south just before coming in sight of Bahrein. I communicated his suggestions to the Senior Naval Officer, Commanding H. M. S. “ Sphinx, ” which had recently returned to Maskat from Bombay, and asked him to let me know by telegram how far he thought it might be possible to comply, but after reference to His Excellency the Commander- in-Chief, he replied on 23rd that the Admiral would not approve ; His Excellency’s reasons in the present case no doubt being (apart from the views expressed in Sir Charles Drury’s letter to your address No. 920 of 26th April 1903) — {a) That it is difficult to spare blue-jackets from His Majesty’s ships in the Gulf as at present manned. (b) That excessive exposure of the men to the sun cannot be avoided at this season of the year. 3. In the meanwhile, 1 had received news of Sheikh Ali’s contemplated surrender, and in communicating again with Captain Bowman, I asked him to proceed and take over Sheikh Ali and at the same time confer with Captain Prideaux as to the best method of procedure against the pirates. The “Sphinx ” should have arrived at Bahrein on 28th instant. 17th Copies of the telegraphic correspondencef marginally noted are attached for information. Since then Captain Prideaux has made another praise-worthy attempt to come in touch with the pirates but with no better success, as will be seen from his report now forwarded. 4 fResident to Senior Naval Officer, dated July 1905.

Resident to Senior Naval Officer, dated 23rd July 1905. 4. At the conclusion of his letter, while realising that the suppression of these acts of piracy constitutes a difficult problem, he mentions that he proposes to address me further on the subject at an early date. Meanwhile it seems advisable that I should not delay in placing the Government of India in posse ssion of such details as are available in case any communications are being made to the Turkish Government on the subject. In this connection I may mention that on hearing from Captain Prideaux that Ahmed bin Selman was abroad again, I at once communicated with His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah and I attach a copy of his reply, the terms of which, do not, I fear, warrant the hope that the attitude of the Turkish authorities is likely to take any effective turn. Until I receive the Political Agent’s further report and have consulted the Senior Naval Officer whom I expect in a day or two, I hesitate to make any&gt;&lt;3 2 specific proposals, but I would venture to express the opinion that the fact of our endeavouring to take practical steps on the spot need not prevent our using this recrudescence of piracy under the leadership of Ahmed bh/selman to press other important matters upon the Turkish Government as suc-ffested’ in (paragraph 5)? 332 ’ ' 6th Ju ’ y the subject of Kate Affai” 5. In conclusion I would draw attention to the fact that the statement mT , i, Capt r m Pnde t ux by Ahmed bin Selman’s escaped retainer, sllim bin ubarak, makes it clear that the pirate, (a Bahrein subject) and his familv have been persistently harboured in territory claimed by the Turks and that the Ahlferrf f 0U ?| on th( :' r ^ st venture from Anich which is practically Katif, where Ahmed s family remained during his absence. f 1 &gt; w ‘'«c \\ e have therefore a very strong case against the Turks. rn ^ M° St o f th n P l??f S t l : ’ entioned in ^e enclosures will be found in Admiralty Chart No. 2837-8., “ Persian Gulf, Western Sheet.”) / ^amiralty Telegram, dated 17th July 1904.

With reference to my letter No. 220, dated the 6th July 1905, on the subiect o the Pirate Ahmed bin Selman, I have the honour to report that n consequence of the receipt of authentic news that the boat of Ahmed bin Saad Madhahakl had been seen in Dohat Dthalum, I started out a second time with two ‘ Mashu- was hired and manned by the Chief, on the afternoon of the 15th instant *•11 2 ' ?U r ln [ orma . nt , ha d s f ld thf 1 !t would be possible, if we found the pirates still in the place indicated, to land a party behind a Cape, which forms one of the sides of the Bay, unobserved by the pirates with a very good chance of taking them in rear as well as m front. 3. To this plan my Arabs had agreed before starting, but I subseauentlv found that they had no intention of carrying it out and when the time came for action they asked me if I wished them all to be killed. Their one idea again was to show themselves as strong as possible in order if possible to induce the pirates to abandon their boat and prisoners without firing a shot. 4. We entered the bay of Dohat Dthalum on the morning of the 16th and found no boats there. We then sailed down the coast Tnd proceeded ks far Dohat Zikrit on the western side of the Katar peninsula. There we learnt from q a ,T am t P r n n °/u th f Bed °T th D at L A . hm « d bin Selman had gone inland and t at the stolen boat had escaped to Bahrein. We accordingly started back for Manama which we reached on the 18th instant. 5. Since my return I have seen Yusuf, the son of the owner of the stolen boat, and Salim bin Mubarak, the follower of Ahmed-bin-Selman, who assisted in bringing the boat to Bahrein. A copy of the latter’s recorded statement is attached for your information, the account of events since the capture of the boat being corroborated by Yusuf bin Saad. F D ^ * s ev ^ ent ^he pirates are befriended by the majority of the Bedouin Beni Hajirany A1 Morra—who frequent the Dthaharan (Hasa) and western Katar coasts. Until the attitude of both the Turks and Sheikh Esa towards these people is materially changed there is little chance of piracy being stamped out. I propose therefore to address you further on this subject at an early date in a letter dealing mainly with the case of the murder of Sheikh Selman bin Diaii by the Behaih section of the A 1 Morra. J J[Confidential.] No. 365, dated Bushire, the 2nd (received 14th) August 1905. From— MAJOR P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Offg. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. To—S. M. Fraser, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward the marginally noted statement which was Statement of Salim bin Mubarak enslaved ser* received as an enclosure to Bahrein letter vant of Ahmed bin Selman, Pirate. ^0. 243, dated 22 nd July IQOS. 2. I have to express regret that, owing to an oversight it was omitted to forward this statement with this office letter No. 360, dated 30th July, to which it should have been a sub-enclosure. Statement of Salem bin Mubarak, negroid enslaved servant of Ahmed bin Selman, the pirate. lam a free-born native of Wadi Dowasir in Central Arabia and was kidnapped from there some years ago, when out collecting grass, by a party of the A 1 Morra. The latter sold me to the Beni Hajir, and they passed me on to Ahmed-bin-Selman as a slave. My master is married to the sister of the Chief of the A 1 Muhammad*. • One of the two great clans of the Beni Hajir Sheikh Muhammad bin Madthi bin Faza. tr5be ' During the winter months he lives with his wife’s relations in the desert between the Hasa Oasis and the coast. On the 1st day of the month Rabi-al-Thani (4th June 1905), my master set out on his piratical adventures from the encampment at Tubaat in the desert and came to Anich on the edge of the Katif Oasis with his family, myself and seven men who had promised to join him in his nefarious work. Many of the Beni Hajir also came to Katif, and some went to Bahrein ostensibly for the purposes of saluting Sheikh Isa and engaging themselves as pearlers. Of the seven men who joined Ahmed bin Selman tw’o belonged to the A 1 Jabir (section of A 1 Morra), one to the A 1 Fahaida (section of A 1 Morra), three to the Sahama (BeniQahtan) and one to the A 1 Muhammad (Beni Hajir). There were only 3 rifles and one sword amongst the whole party. Ahmed bin Selman installed his family at Anich, and he and I remained there six days, while the other men spread themselves along the coast looking for a boat that could be easily seized. Eventually Ahmed bin Tami bin Taza, a cousin by marriage of my master, told us that a small boat was lying off Rufeah on Tarut Island, and the whole party of nine of us accordingly left Anich at sunset, reached Rufeah in two hours, swan off to the boat and suc:essfully seized it as the boatmen were asleep. We sailed at once towards the east, and in the morning found Ahmed Madhahaki’s ‘Mashuwa’ near the reef Fasht-al-Jarim. Ahmed bin Selman opened fire, killing one man who fell into the sea and wounding others who were seen rolling about in the boat. We then boarded the boat, put the wounded men into the smaller one with the boatmen who belonged to it and turned them adrift. Then we returned to the Dthaharan coast and anchored in Dohar Dthalum. From there my master sent men to Katif for news as to the action taken by the Katif and Bahrein Governments. He first heard that his wife’s uncle Tami bin Taza had been arrested by the Turks. He accordingly summoned his family from Anich and, on their arrival on two camels, he set sail with them and his whole party including four prisoners for Dohat Salwa. There he heard about the 3 Bahrein boats being out in search of him and thereupon he left me and two other men in charge of the boat and the captives, while he himself took his family and booty inland to the encamp ment of the A 1 Muhammad Sheikh, Muhammad bin Madthi bin Taza, and tried2 to get more men to join him in his piratical career. Seeing my chance of escaping from servitude I joined Yusuf bin Saad and the other prisoners i„ throwing my two comrades into the sea, and when they got hold of P the small thembThind^'^ ^ ° nSS t0 Mashuwa we cut the ro P e and sa i'ed aw-ay leaving • „ The , P™£iP al .P er ® on who give* Ahmed bin Selman news about Bahrein is Hamad bin Tami, a brother of Ahmed and son of the Sheikh who has been imprisoned by the Turks.

As no information has reached Bahrein concerning the loss of such a boat, I am sending copies of Nakhoda Abdal Latif bin Habib s statement to the Kaim-makam of Katif and to Sheikh Ahmed bin Thani of Bida. Statement of Abdal Latif bin Habib, Nakhoda of the boat of Abdallah bin Alwan, of Katif and Bahrein, recorded on the Jth August 1905 . Nine days ago we left Katif. We were six men and one woman, and had in our boat 200 packages of dates consigned to the name of Ahmed bin Selman, a merchant of Bahrein, also Rs. 162 cash, Rs. 43 of which were sent by Abdal lah bin Faras for the same Ahmed bin Selman. The day we left Katif we met on our way near Kaskus a ‘ Shuei ’ boat which had the appearance of a pearl ing boat and in which were some ten or twelve Bedus. But to our surprise the) fired at us, pulled round the sail of their boat and sailed fast towards us. When they got sufficiently close they again opened fire hitting a boy some twelve years old, son of Isa Almukhnar of Dalebia, with the result that he ro le down into the sea. Then they jumped into our boat, and wounded two of our company with their daggers, my son Jasim, receiving two wounds in the face and in the hand and Ali A 1 Hasavi 5 wounds. Afterwards the pirates put 3 of their men in our boat and the rest sailed back. We went on for two days till we reached a bay. I do not know the name of this bay. Never before had I seen the place. We anchored near the sea shore. Here the three men landed and took with them all our cash and the packages of dates besides our sail-cloth worth Rs. 100 and cooking utensils and coffee-pots worth Rs. 20 and clothes of the value of Rs. 25, also the clothes of th e woman with us. They let us go after giving us all sorts of worries and troubles. Inc names of those three mfn are Ali, Jabr and Jabir, and all the way they were using insulting expressions towards us saying that some men of ^ jail in Katif, that they would chase any boat they saw, and that they were the followers of Ahmed bin Selman the pirate. We saw a small jolly boat in that bay. We left there 3 days ago, directing our course to the north aided by the Polar star : on the morning of the 6th ins tant we reached Budeya, and on the same afternoon Manama. G.

S ntlf rUt ^ and i vlt , h 2 V 160 as \ ee P m it. The pirate leader was accompanied by 8 other men, and though no violence was done to the 3 boatmen they were compelled to work the boat until the richer prize was captured. ’ 7 3 * A few hours before dawn the pirates weighed anchor and proceeded until they espied a fleet of 30 pearling boats which had temporarily taken refuge from a gale under the lee of the reef known as Fasht-al-Jarim, a few miles north of ahrem. Here too was a Mashuwa ” (a faster type of sailing boat) which had been sent out by a merchant of Bahrein, by name Ahmed bin Saad Madha- tiaki, to buy pearls of the divers. a «.u’ pearlln £ boats were the first to leave their refuge in the early mornincr th ^ } proc cc d cd to attack the unsuspecting occupants of the Mashuwa. Too late the latter awoke to their danger, and though one of their inen fired a shot at the pirates, the latter were able to reply with a volley which killed a youth, a son of Ahmed bin Saad, mortally wounded one man who died subsequently in hospital at Bahrein, and seriously injured two others. The pirates then jumped on board the “ Mashuwa ” and turned all the occu pants of it, with the exception of Yusuf, the second son of Ahmed bin Saad, into the smaller boat, while Ahmed bin Selman ordered them to remain where they were until he had gone out of sight. The victims then came to Bahrein and the ^ larut boatmen two days later took their boat to Katif and reported the matter to the Kaim-Makam. The pirates took Yusuf bin Ahmed away with them sav ing that when they had done with the “Mashuwa,” he would be able to sail it back to his home. Up to this time, however, no further information has been obtained regarding the fate of either Yusuf or his boat. The property plundered from the ‘ Mashuwa ” in pearls and cash is valued by Ahmed bin Saad at Rs 3 , 600 . 5- On receiving the news of these piracies, I at once communicated with the Lhief of Bahrein, and after some consideration it was arranged that he should fit out and man three large Mashuwas to go in search of the pirates, and that as the Government of India do not approve of the Trucial Chiefs sending out boats for warlike purposes under any circumstances unobserved, I should accom pany the expedition to see that no improprieties occurred and to assist in the capture or destruction of the pirates if they could be found.2 6 . In very dilatory fashion the 3 boats were got ready, and on the afternoon of the 28 th June, I went on board accompanied by my interpreter and the Jemadar and 12 sepoys of the Agency Guard. There were 20 Arabs in my ' Mashuwa J and about 25 in each of the other two* 7 . In the course of the next three days we searched the coast of the mainland from Dohat Ain A1 Seh to Ras Tanufa, omitting the Katif Oasis, and if the wind had not been extremely unfavourable we would have gone still further north. In the circumstances, however, we turned back from this point and sailed into Katif harbour, where I interviewed the Kaim Makam Ibrahim Effendi as related in the memorandum which accompanies this report. I found the Kaim Makam very civil in his attitude, though the Senior Military Officer was inclined to be discourteous and was very officious in his enquiries as to my right to bring my 3 ( Mashuwas * into Katif harbour. 8 . One of the leading Arabs on board my vessel had a wife and house at Darein, the place on Tarut Island which commands the south entrance to Katif. Opposite this place, therefore, he waded ashore, and at the time of my departure from Katif he returned with the information that the Kaim Makam had only sent out his search-boat after hearing that I had started from Bahrein, and that besides doing this he had imprisoned the father-in-law of Ahmed bin Selman who is a notable of the Beni Hajir tribe, and was opportunely found in the town of Katif. This fact was concealed from me by the Kaim Makam probably because the Sheikh would eventually be allowed to buy his liberty. My inform ant also reported that the pirates were believed still to be in the vicinity of Bahrein either on the Katr Coast or that of Dthaharan, south of Katif. I, therefore decided to return to Bahrein and to ask the Chief to get more definite’information before I set out again. 9 . Sheikh Isa talks a good deal about the rapidity with which he would destroy the pirates if he were given a free hand by Government, but my obser vations incline me to think that his servants are not whole-hearted in their desire to fall in with them. On the recent expedition I advised the three Commanders of the Mashuwas to cover as wide an area as possible each day, but found that they persisted in keeping together in spite of all that I said/ A better result would probably be obtained if a few blue-jackets were sent out in each Mash uwa to cruise separately within defined limits for a lengthened period, but even then it will be very difficult to prevent the pirates escaping ashore if the identity of our boats is suspected. Our best chance of ending the career of Ahmed bin Selman I think lies in the Government of India setting a price of Rs. 1,000 or Rs. 1,500 on his head, and if this were done I believe the desired effect’ would soon be achieved, as there is probably no one who would take ud the ouarrel to make a blood-feud of it.

Uari- nitch, the Second Dragoman of this Embassy, to the minister of the Interior again urging that immediate and effective steps be taken to suppress the acts of piracy taking place in the Persian Gulf. The Minister assured Mr. Marinitch that the wishes of the Embassy would be complied with and His Excellency at once telegraphed to the Vali of Bussorah instructing him to act in conformity with the demands contained in the Memorandum.

Although the Ministry of the Interior addressed a communication to the Vali of Basra on the 21/4 December last instructing the local authorities to lay hands at once on Ahmed bin Seiran and his associates who indulge in acts of piracy in the Persian Gulf and especially in tne Katif waters, yet, according to information just received from His Britannic Majesty’s Principal Secre tary of State for Foreign Affairs, it appears that these ruffians have not yet been secured, although the place of their concealment is well known to the local authorities. In tnese circumstances, and in obedience to the instructions received from the Foreign Office, His Ma jesty’s Embassy beg to call the attention of His Ex cellency the Minister of tne Interior to the necessity of giving assurances to His'Majesty's Embassy that the Imperial Ottoman Government will send categorical and efficacious orders to the effect that measures will be takenhenceforth to these acts of piracy. taken to put a stop aiat tnese ruffians will be immediately seized and tne value of the plundered property, which amounts that to J hupoos, will ho restored to the victims.To * Enclosure, Sir Nicoles O’Conor to the Marquess of Lansdowne, No. 833, dated the loth December 1903. arrested.

I ort IV illiam, the 8 th December 1V01. Sir, We have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with vour Secret telegram, dated the r 8 th September 3904, regarding the recent acts oJ piracy committed in the Persian Gulf near Katif by Ahmfd-bin-Selman .. 2&gt; T, he detailed in the annexed schedule are forwarded for inform- ation. R will be observed that, in October 1901, the Political Resident Tn the Persian GuU reported the occurrence of piracies off the Arabian Coast and that members of the Beni Hajir tribe, residing in the El Katr Peninsula were held to have been concerned in at least one of the four eases mentioned in letter No. 187, dated Hth October 1901, from Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball In September 1902, that officer drew attention to the recrudescence of acts of piracy in the vicimty of El Katr and Bahrein, committed by a party of the same tribe under the leadership of one Ahmad-bin-Selman, a notorious wt character. Endeavours were made to secure steps being taken by the Turkish officials towards the arrest of Ahmad-bin-Selman. These endeavours resulted m a communication,* dated 15th December 1903, from the Sublime Porte stating that the pirate had left foi- Koweit, and could not consequently be « * ,1 4 V Vr* ° f note that ’ in October 1902, it' was reported that he had thrown himself on the mercy of the Mutessarif of A 1 Hassa, to whom he is stated to have personally handed two pearls, and who promised him pardon on condition that he divulged the names of his accom- phcesS and that the latter gave up their share of the plunder. The statement that he had left for Koweit was further refuted by Mr. Gaskin, Assistant o Rical Agent, Balirein, in August 1903. The recent cases of piracy committed y Ahmad-bin-Selman go to show that Mr. Gaskin made a correct statement when he reported that the pirate had evidently been advised to keep out of the way : the fact being that he is not arrested by the Turkish authorities, because they hope that as a cousin and subject of Shaikh Isa, Chief of Bahrein, who has sub^ectsf ^ ^ 16 k® w ill prove a thorn in the side of that Chief’s i v 3 ' p P^P® 8 ® reviewing the more recent cases of piracy in the neighbour- °f ! ^ a l irem J an d the El Katr Peninsula, which have for Ion 11 * been subjected to piratical depredations. Iu the year 18S7, no fewer than° seven serious piracies occurred between the months of July and October. These were reported in our despatch No. 59, dated the 17th April 1888. Of late years— there have been no such outbreaks as this, hut the evil still continues. In lojy, tour cases were reported. In 1900 there were five more cases. In 1901 there appears to have been complete immunity. In 1902 four distinct acts of piracy were committed by one gang under the leadership of Ahmad-bin- oelman, while in 1903 he again appeared in the vicinity of Katif, but, beyond an unsuccessful attempt upon a Bahrein dhow in the vicinity of the marl banks off the Katr coast, no act of piracy was reported.r r appears ( 10 ) Early in July 1902, Ahmad-bin-Selman and party stole a boat from Seihat. Stress of weather on 19th J uly drove him back to a point north of Ojair, when an armed boat party was sent against him by the inhabitants of Seihat, and be bad to abandon the boat and dee ashore. ( 11 ) Later in July 1902, the same party stole a boat at Senabis, a village on the island of Tarut. The Kaimmakam of Katif was reported to have sent an armed dhow after them. They, however, crossed to the island of Um JSasam • and ( 12 ) on 4th August, captured a Bahrein dhow of 28 tons burden with gear, vessel was lying at Um JS T asam to load lime for Bahrein. The crew with three donkeys and drivers, were taken to Thahran. (13) On 12th August 1902, by the aid of the above-mentioned boat, they plundered another Bahrein boat of Thein, taking all its gear, utensils and about S4,000 worth of pearls and $50 in cash from a passenger, a native of Bahrein. They then sailed for Dohat-al-Thalum at Thahran, 'where they landed with their plunder. The owner of the boat took advantage of the opportunity and escaped with his boat : the one stolen off Um Nasam° bv the pirates. iNo redress is reported to have been secured in any of these four The details of the several piracies committed in 1899, 1900, and 1902 are as follows:— (1) In Eebruary 1899, a Persian boat was plundered off Abu Zaluf on the El Katr coast. It was subsequently reported, however, that it was doubtful whether this w r as a genuine case of piracy. ( 2 ) On the 11 th August 1899, a boat belonging to a Bahrein subject was attacked and plundered near the Shakta pearl banks in the vicinity of Katif. ^ The pirates are said to have belonged to Daren in the same neighbourhood.' The value of the property stolen was not reported, but a small proportion is said to have been recovered. How^ recovery w^as effected is not clear. Sir Nicolas O’Conor w r as, however, directed to instruct His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah to let it be known that in future the British Government wmuld itself deal with such cases. Certain of the offenders were eventually imprisoned for long terms by the Turkish authorities. (3) On the 16th August 1899, a boat belonging to a Bahrein subject w^as attacked and carried off near Dbakira. The boat was subsequently recovered through Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani of El Katr. (4) In August 1899, twm boats belonging to British Indian subjects w^ere plundered at Dibal on the El Katr coast. One of the boats was carried off and abandoned near Zobara on the same coast. The total value of the property stolen was over lls. 16,000. Part to the value of Its. 2,067 w r as recovered through Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani. (5) On the 17th August 1900, a Bahrein boat was plundered on the Khora pearl bank near Ras Tanurah by men from Daren. One of the persons in the boat was drowned, and property valued at Rs. 3,924 w r as carried off. As the result of representations to the Mutessarif of A1 liassa, a sum of Rs. 996-8-0 together with four pearls, w r as eventually restored to the owmer. ( 6 ) On the 2 nd September 1900, a party of men, said to belong to the Beni Hajir tribe, attacked a Bahrein boat some seven miles north of Bahrein and carried off property valued at Rs. 731. No redress was obtained. (7) On the same date, an attack was made by men of the Beni Hajir tribe on some Arabs in the island of Um Nasam off Bahrein. ( 8 ) On the 18th August 1900, a Bahrein boat w r as attacked on the Graimia pearl bank six miles north of Ras Rekkan. Property valued at Rs. 315-8-0 was stolen. No redress was obtained. (9) On the 6 th September 1900, a Bahrein boat was attacked off Ojair. Twm persons w T ere wounded, and considerable property (value not stated) was plundered. Most of the property belonged to Turkish subjects, and was re covered by tbe Mutessarif of A1 Hassa, wdio punished the tribe responsible for the outrage. None of the property belonging to the Bahrein owners to have been restored.4. We venture to submit the following observations on the incidents winch are reci ed above The offenders in all the cases appear to have come from the mainland. \Y here they have been residents of territories which are nominally subject to the Ottoman Porte endeavours have been made to enlist the co operation of the Turh^h authorities, but only in those cases detailed as (2) and (5), were punishments awarded to the offenders and partial restoration of property obtained In the case cited as (9), the only one in which Turkish subjects apparently lost anything prompt action was taken in securing the recovery of most of the property of the Turkish subjects, but not of that belonging to the Bahrein owners. Again, when the base of operations has been m El katr, it has been found possible, in the cases noted as (3) - d , W ’ A1 t0 P 1 1 ’? Cur ® rG ? tlt ution by bringing pressure to bear through Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani the leading Chief of that peninsula. The piracfes lepoited recently are of a three-fold nature : inasmuch as Ahmad-bin-Selman and companions first seized a boat at Safvva, near Katif, which belonged to a Bahrein subject, then plundered another boat, the property of a resident of Katr, and eventually committed an act of piracy on a Persian sailing boat crossing with melons from the Persian coast of the Gulf. The printing a . ct 0t p V: ac y ls , ^ at the , Katr boat ’ which appears to be the first of its kind since 1900, and it will be observed from this case that Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani has taken the opportunity of pointing out that it is the duty of His Maiestv’s io\eminent to grant protection to vessels against piracy in view of the fact that they prohibit the Arab Chiefs from themselves patrolling the sea. t mi' Th * ^ coacl,1 ! ie a P rot ectorate treaty with Sheikh Ahmed- bin-lhani of El Katr has already been referred to, and the remarks contained m y our Secret despatch No. 41, dated the 9th September 1904, on the subiect are receiving our careful consideration, and our views on the subiect will be submitted to His Majesty’s Government in due course. It is acknowledged in that despatch that the absence of any agreement with the Sheikh mar in certain contingencies, prove a hindrance to the proper exercise by His Maiestv’s ships of their duties in the suppression of piracy and the maintenance of the peace of the Gulf. Moreover, the continuance of these acts of piracy brin^ into prominence the unsatisfactory character of Turkish administration in A1 Hassa and the apathy shown by the local officials in dealing with repeated representa tions wdiich have been made with respect to losses sustained by subjects of the Chief of Bahrein. But whatever course of action may ultimately be decided on as regards the political status of El Katr, we take advantage of the present com plaint received from Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani, through the Chief of Bahrein to urge that a strong representation should be made to the Sublime Porte with a view to the arrest of the pirate Ahmad-bin-Selman and the restitution of property plundered by him. The heavy loss inflicted on the Katr subiect affects the interests of British Indian and Bahrein subjects to whom the owner of the boat is indebted, and it is the third year in succession that Ahmad-bin- Selman has committed these depredations.

The piracies referred to are as follows :— (1st) Piracy committed at the Graim'ah pearl bank off Ras Rakan on El Katr, reported to the Government of India in this office letter No. 230, dated 10 th September 1900. {2nd) Piracy committed on the boat of Haji Selman bin Haji Ahmad, a Bahreini on the Khora bank near Ras Tanoora, Katif, vide correspondence ending with this office letter No. 79, dated 22 nd April 1901.2 {3rd) Piracy committed at sea on a Bahrein boat 8 miles north of Bahrein, vide this office letter No. 237, dated 1st October 1900. (dth) Piracy committed on a Bahrein boat off Ojair, vide this office letter No. 238, dated 1st October 1900. 3. With reference to the first case the pirates are believed to belong to the Beni Hajir tribe, residing on the El-Katr Peninsula. It has not been possible to ascertain who the pirates actually were or from what place they obtained the boat in which they committed the piracy. The only way that I can suggest of obtaining compensation for the victims in this piracy is to attach such goods as may be found in Bahrein belonging to the Chief of Katr, whom we hold responsible for keeping order within his territory. I propose to visit Bahrein shortly and will ascertain how far this suggestion is feasible. The second case has been partially settled by the Turks. In the third case no settlement has been effected. In the fourth case most of the property taken belonged to Turkish subjects, and the Turkish authorities have, I am informed, taken steps to punish the tribe who committed this piracy. The Bahrein subjects, however, who suffered on the occasion, have not, so far as I have heard, been given any redress. So far as these three cases are concerned, I can only suggest that if my proposal to send a ship of war to Katif in connection with the murder of Shaikh Selman bin Diaij el Khalifa is approved, vide my letter No. 146, dated 12th August 1901, the opportunity might be taken of demanding a settlement of the cases.

Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 187, dated the 14th October 1901, regarding certain piracies which occurred during 1900 on the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf. 2 , You were authorised in my letter No. 1803-E.A., dated the 21st Octo ber 190], to arrange for a man-of-war to be sent to Katif at some convenient opportunity with a view to enquiries being made as to what steps, if any, have been taken by the local Turkish officials to punish the murderers of Sheikh Selman bin Diaij el Khalifah and others of Bahrein. Enquiries may, as you suggest, be made at the same time as to the action that is being taken in regard to those cases of piracy mentioned in your letter under acknowledg ment, for the settlement of which the Turkish authorities have already been held responsible. The Commander of the vessel should, however, be careful to coniine himself to enquiries and should make no demand upon the local officials. As to the case which occurred within the jurisdiction of the Chief of El Katr, a further report will be awaited.

Kemball, I.S.C., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to invite a reference to the letter No. 1964-E A., dated the 16th November 1901, from the Under-Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, regarding certain piracies which occurred during 1900 on the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf.t 3 2. The critical position of affairs at Koweit has, up to the present, pre vented me from arranging for the visit of a giri-boat to Katif with a view to in quiries being made as to what st )ps, if any, have been taken by the local Turkish authorities to punish the murderers of Sheikh Salman-bin-Diaij-ehKalifah of Bahrein and the perpetrators of certam piracies referred to in my letter No. 187, dated the 14th October 1901. I hope, however, to be able to arrange for the visit to be made before long. 3. With regard to the case which occurred within the jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Katr, l hare ascertained that the Sheikh’s Agent at Bahrein is an Arab merchant of Bahrein, by name Sheikh Abdul Bahman-bin-Idan. This man usually has in his possession varying amounts of cash belonging to the Chief of Katr, find the proceeds of the large parcels of pearls sent annually by the Katr Chief to Bombay for sale are remitted to his care. It would, I under stand, be possible for the Assistant Political Agent with the assistance of the Chief of Bahrein to avail himself of a suitable opportunity and seize property belonging to the 8heikh of Katr of sufficient value to cover the losses incurred through the piracies for which the Katr Sheikh is held responsible. 4. The piracy reported in my above-quoted letter, which occurred on the 18th August 1900 off the Katr Coast, was not of a particularly serious nature, the property alleged to have been taken having only amounted to Rs. 315-8. The piracies, however, which took place in the year 1899, vide correspondence ending with my letter No. 270, dated the 19th November 1900, were far more serious, my predecessor having claimed more than Rs. 12,000 from the Chief of Katr on their account. The letter which I addressed to the Chief of Katr in accordance with the authority given to me in your letter No. 284-E.A., dated the 19th February 1901, did not receive a satisfactory reply, and these piracies are still unredressed. I forward herewith copies of this letter and of the Chief’s reply. 5. Although tbe proposal to seize such property belonging to the Katr Chief as we can lay our hands on in Bahrein does not entirely commend itself to me, I can see no other way of obtaining any compensation for the sufferers by the piracies referred to. It is practically impossible for us to punish the perpe trators of the piracies who are probably Bedouins and have no fixed place of residence. If, then, the proposal to obtain redress by the seizure in Bahrein of the property belonging to the Chief of Katr, off whose territory the piracies occurred, does not meet with the approval of the Government of India, I can only suggest that the cases should be allowed to drop. During the current year no case of piracy in the neighbourhood of El*Katr has been reported, and it is possible that the Chief of Katr has recognized his responsibility and has taken the necessary preventive measures. In the event of any future case occurring in which it is proved that the pirates have come from the Katr pen insula, I would suggest that I may be authorized to at once seize such property belonging to the Katr Chief as I can lay my hands on and to hold the same until suitable redress is given. No. 66, dated the 9 th March 1901 . From— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, I.S.C., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani, Chief of Katr. After Compliments .—I have not replied sooner to your letter dated azndRatn-ni-Thari 1318 a. h._ which you disclaim responsibility for the action of the Beni Hajirs who reside in Katr and are ia the habit of committing piracies at sea in that neighbourhood. The reason for tbe delay in replying to your letter was, that it was necessary forme to refer the matter to my Government. It is not necessary for me to recapitulate the piracies which have taken place during recent years in the neighbourhood of Katr ; but the object of my now writing to you is to impress on you the fact that my Government view the occurrence of piracies in any part of the Persian Gulf with extreme displeasure, that they cannot admit your disclaimer of responsibility for control of the Bedouins who reside in El-Katr and that, if necessary, steps will be taken to bring this res ponsibility home to you. You should lose no time in warning all owners of4 boats residing on tho Coast of El-ICatr that they must be careful not to allow leu botts to be used by these Bedouin marauders, as in future it will b-neces sary to bold the owners of boats, which are used by the pirates!res^nsMe I trust that you will accept this warning in the friendly spirit in which it is sent, and that you will take steps to prevent piracies occurring in future.

Also that they (boat owners) could prevent them (the pirates'! if tlicv saw them near the shore; this is not possible, because the number of the crew is small and they have no power to oppose or prevent. ISo. .JSM-ii.A., dated Fort William, the 6th February 1902. From-The Under-Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Depart &lt;*“* Ij n m dll ’ ecte ^° ^knowledge the receipt of your letter No. 227 , dated the 28th December ld 01 5&gt; on the subject of certain piracies which occurred off the El-Katr peninsula during the years 1899 and 1900. in 2 . Your letter deals with three cases of piracy, two of which oocuriWI in August 1899, while the third dates from August 1900. In the third case the stolen property is valued at Rs. 315-8 only, but in the two earlier cases property of the value of more than Rs. 12,000 is alleged to have been plundered ItE understood that of the property stolen in the two piracies which occurred in August 1899 a portion valued at about Rs. 2,067 has been recovered by Sheikh Ahmed-bm-lhani, the Ruling Sheikh of El-Katr, but that no effort has been made by him to recover the remainder of the property which was looted on those two occasions or to exact redress from the Bedouins who committed the * Secret E., November 1900, Nos. 61-69 (No. 64 ). smaller outrage at Graimia Pearl Bank . i + • i- 1U August;* 1900. You now suggest that, m order to ohtam compensation for the sufferers by these piracies thn property of the El-Katr Chief in Bahrein should be attached, or that as an alternative, the cases should be allowed to drop. A third alternative , which was suggested in your letter No. 270, dated the 19th November 1900,’ would5 be to send a boat expedition to punish the villages from which the pirates embarked. r 3. The Government of India have decided, in view of the time which has elapsed since the occurrence of these piracies, and of certain pre*occupations in other parts of the Persian Gulf, that active measures for the exaction of redress ^ from the Sheikh of Ll-Katr or irom the offending villages cannot now be wisely or profitably undertaken, and that the cases must be allowed to drop. Having regard, however, to the language held by Colonel Meade to the Sheikh in Nov ember 1899, the Government of India have come to their present decision with reluctance, and they cannot but regret thnt, owing to the want of definite proposals from two successive Political Residents, the opportunity for exacting full and timely reparation for th.ese outrages should have been allowed to pass. In the opinion of the Government of India, some speedy measures of redress should be adopted in future if such outrages are repeated ; and, in the event of any fresh case of piiacy occurring off the El-Jvatr peninsula, the Political Resident should^ not only cause the property of the Katr Chief in Bahrein to be attached until redress is given, but should also submit proposals at once for a boat expedition against the villages immediately concerned, if that appears to be the best and most effective method of inflicting punishment and enforcing reparation. No. 28 S.A., dated Shiraz, the 13th September 1902. From— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of the correspondence ending with your letter No. 294-E.A., dated 6 th February 1902, I have the honour to report, for the information of the Government of India, the recrudescence of acts of piracy, in the vicinity of El Katr and Bahrein, committed by a party of Beni Hajir Arabs under the leadership of one Ahmad-bin-Selman, a notorious bad character. 2. Early in July this man succeeded in stealing a boat from Seihat, but stress of weather on July 19th drove him back to a point north of Ojair, on hearing of which the inhabitants of Seihat sent an armed boat party against him obliging him to abandon his craft and flee ashore. 3. Some days later Ahmad and his gang stole a boat at Senalis with which they crossed to the island of Um Nasan, and on August 4th captured a Bahrein dhow of 28 tons burden which was lying there to load lime for Bahrein, by means of which dhow some ten days later they waylaid and robbed another Bahrein boat, off Thaein in the Katr Peninsula, of its entire gear and utensils as well as of cash and pearls, the property of a trader on board, to the total value of some $5,400, and then proceeded to Dohat Thalum in Thahran, south of Katif, in Turkish territory, where they landed with their plunder. 4. The Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, informs me that Ahmad-bin- Selman, of whose nationality I am not yet aw r are, had been residing recently at Sweisima in El Katr territory, where his family now is, and as these piracies seem to have occurred in hi Kar waters, while some of the property plundered from the first Bahrein boat was disposed of at places under the jurisdiction of the Sheikh of El Katr, it seems a case to apply the orders conveyed in paragraph 3 of your letter above quoted, and I have instructed the Assistant Political Agent accordingly, who, I may mention, had already warned Sheikh Ahmad-bin- Thani that he would be held responsible and had also requested the Kaimma- kam of Katif to co-operate in suppressing Ahmad and his gang. 5. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah has been requested to move the Wali to send strict orders to his subordinates to take energetic measures and informs me that he has done so, and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, is arranging at my request to depute a gunboat to Bahrein with a view to con certing measures, either by means of a boat expedition or otherwise to put down this gang. 6 . I have not considered it advisable to accede to a request of Sheikh Isa of Bahrein that he might be permitted to despatch an expedition against6 Ahmad, owing to tho probability that tho pursuit would load tho Bahreinoso into Turkish waters and possibly into Turkish territories and thus produce inconvenient complications.

In reply to Captain Hunt’s letters No. 638 of August 18th and No. 676 of September 1 st, concerning the piracies of Ahmad-bin-Selman off the Coast of Katif, I have the honour to enclose herewith copies of two letters I have addressed to the Wali of Basrah on the subject, and also a translation of His Excellency’s reply. I hear that the Turkish gunboat Kdid-el-BaJir is shortly to be sent down the Arab Coast; but so decrepit a vessel, even if she eventually starts, can be of but little use for the prevention of piracy. The fact is that the local Turkish Government seems quite unable to maintain order either by land or sea in the districts for which it is responsible. No. 86, dated the 22nd August 1902. From—A. C. Wratislaw, Ksq., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, To— His Excellency Mustafa Nouri Pasha, Wali of Basrah. Erom information received from the British Agent in the Island of Bahrein, it appears that a notorious outlay named Ahmad-bin-Selman has collected a band of Bedouins from the Katif district and is committing piracies in those waters. He is actually in possession of a large Bahrein sailing vessel which he captured at the island of Urn Nasan, it is very necessary that he should be captured. The British Agent has already communicated with the Raimmakam of Katif about this matter, and I beg that Your Excellency will also send the necessary instructions to the spot. No. 92, dated the 3rd September 1902. From—A. C. W ratislaw, Esq., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, To—His Excellency Mustafa Nouri Pasha, Wali of Basrah. With reference to my letter to Your Excellency No. 86 of August 22nd, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that the pirate Ahmad-bin-Selman has employed the vessel which he captured at Um Nasan in the capture of another Bahrein boom near Thaein, from which he looted money and pearls to the value of Rs. (sic in original) 5,400. After committing this crime the pirates are reported to have returned to Dohat Thalam in Thahran, south of Katif, and to have landed the stolen pro perty in Turkish territory. Considering that the previous piracies referred to in my letter No. 130 of December 10 , 1901, still remain unpunished, I beg that Your Excellency will kindly inform me whether the resources at the disposal of the local Turkish authorities are sufficient to ensure the arrest and7 punishment of these malefactors or whether it is desirable that a British vessel of war should be sent to assist in maintaining the security of the coast of Katif.

Having read your letter No. 92 of 3rd September 1902, I beg to say that, on receipt of your letter No. 86 of 22nd August, the necessary communications were made to the Governor of Nejd, and that on receipt of reply to a second and urgent message to him pointing out the serious nature of the question, the Vilayet will take the necessary steps and endeavour to procure the restitution of the solen property and the punishment of the delinquents. I beg to add that there is no med to send a steamer to help in the matter, thanks to the protecting arm of the Padshah. Sent to His Majesty’s Resident and Consul-General, Bushire, with the compliments of the undersigned. No. 167, dated Busbire, the 8th December 1902. From— Lieut&amp;naxt Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with my letter No. 132, dated the 22nd September 1902, on the subject of certain piracies committed upon Bahrein boats by Ahmad-bin-Selmau. As a result of further enquiries, it transpired that the pirate Ahmad-bin- Selman is not a subject of the Chief of Katr. He belongs to the A1 Khalifah family of Bahrein, and is, therefore, a subject of the Chief of Bahrein. He has, however, been for some time an outlaw from Bahrein and has resided in Katr, but he had left Katr long before the present piracies occurred, and had removed to Turkish territory, whence he set forth on his piratical expedition. His family is living at present in Bahrein. It would not, therefore, be just to hold the Chief of Katr responsible; and the Chief of Bahrein, who was consulted in the matter, has stated that he does not think that the Chief of Katr is in any way responsible to him on account of these piracies, and he objected under the cir cumstances to take any steps with regard to the Katr Chief’s property in Bahrein. 2. There is no doubt that the pirate Ahmad-bin-Selman is now in Turkish territory, where the proceeds of the piracy on the Bahrein boat committed otf Katr were taken. Prom a recent report from the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, No. 245, dated 30th November 1902, copy of which is herewith for warded, it appears that he has actually been in the hands of the Turkish authorities. It is very desirable that steps should now be taken to prevent this pirate from doing any further mischief, and I will bring the facts to the knowledge of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah. 3. When I was recently at Bahrein, the Chief spoke to me on the subject of piracies, and said that he would be very glad if permission could be granted to him to proceed in pursuit of pirates by sea. He stated that it occasionally happened that information reached him of the whereabouts of a pirate and that, if he was able to act immediately upon the receipt of such information and was permitted to send away an armed dhow in pursuit, he was confident that he would be able to impose a check on piracies in the neighbourhood of Bahrein. He expressed the opinion that the fact of it being known that he had such per mission from the British Government would of itself act as a deterrent to intend ing pirates and he readily agreed to abide by any restrictions which the British Government might choose to impose as to the limits within which his boats might cruise. He agreed to consult the Political Officer at Bahrein prior to sending an armed dhow to sea and also to put a responsible and trustworthy official in charge of the dhow which he sent in pursuit of pirates. I informed the Chief that! would refer his request to the Government of India as I could not myself give him the permission, and I instructed Mr. Gaskin to submit an official report to me on the subject.8 4. The Government of India is aware of the difficulties which exist in- thp way of our ships of war taking any active steps in the matter of these piracies 10 generally occur towards the close of the pearling season. The information about a piracy only reaches us after the piracy has been committed 3 in of 1 piracy. 18 praCtlCall - v lm P°ssible for our ships of war to put down this kind I am inclined, therefore, to think that the Chief of Bahrein mieht he siven the permission for which he asks on the conditions that before he semis an i ? s7k asked that'on^of l P - ermiSSi0n °/v, the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein is nm asked, thdt one of his sons or other responsible person is nut in pWc*a a point nort^of Ras t Tano° Pe ' at H I1S °f the i b0at are confined to the sp as betwefn the ne^ghbowhood of AhBidaa ^ r0Und the Katr P “ la ino. dated Bahrein, the 30th November 1902.

As experience has shown that the action of His Maiestv’s shins and m.r reference to the Turkish Government for redress have Wtherto proved futile it remains that some more effective measures be adopted to put a stop to the recurrence of piracies m these waters. I therefore venture to bring forward for your consideration, a suggestion of the Chief of Bahrein, that he mav be w aSS1 t m i t . he , ma ^ ei : of P uttin o down piracies. He has repeatedly expressed to me his desire to obtain the permission of the Government of India to have m readiness, during the pearling season, an armed boat under one of his sons to proceed against the pirates directly information is received of their havmg paken to sea. In his remarks to me he laid much stress on the fact that, though the Government of India have been good enough to take up all cases of piracies reported to them and such measures as have been possible under the difficult circumstances have been taken, it is unfortunate that, owing to the lapse of time usually occurring between the date on which the piracies are com mitted and the arrival of His Majesty’s ship of war on the scene, the pirates are able.to get away, and to the apathy of the Turkish Government in matters con cerning Bahrein, the subsequent references to that Government generallv prove abortive ; and he thinks, and I agree with him, that local measures are likelv to prove a success. ^ The fact that the pirates getting to know that the Chief of Bahrein has been given permission to take active measures against them in the event of their proceeding on depredatory expeditions at sea, will in itself, in my opinion, be a9 check on them, and, as generally information of intended expeditions is forth coming prior to their start, the Chief can fall in with them before any serious mischief is done. I am of opinion that so long as the Chief on each occasion consults the Assistant Political Agent and limits his action to pursuing pirates only and confining his independent operations or giving assistance to a British gunboat whenever one is present within the seas between 25° 20' and 26° SO 7 north latitudes and abstains from entering Turkish waters when a Turkish gun boat is present, there-can be no serious objections. Translation of a letter, dated the 2ind October 190'2, from Sviyid Tkaxib, Mutessarif of Al- Hassa, to Sviyid Abdulla-bin-Ibrahim, Bahrein. After compliments .—I have received your letter, dated the 11th Novem ber 1902, and all that you stated has been understood. Ahmad-bin-Selman asked for mercy and his taking refuge has been accepted on condition that he will give the names of his companions and each of them gives up his share of the plunder. I have found in his possession two pearls only and they are in my safe custody until the final results are obtained. 1 have sent you your freed slave and, please God, shortly I will do the necessary towards the discovering of your property.

I pointed out that he had already addressed the Mutessarif of Nejd several times on the subject and had received no reply. I reminded him that Ahmed-bin-Selman was a standing menace to traffic in Bahrein waters, and that orders were sent by the Porte in 1902 to pursue and capture him. I asked the Yali to give his serious attention to the matter, more10 especially as the date season was now approaching and I anticipated interference with the Indian sailing vessels.

In continuation of my report No. 145, dated the 11th July 1903, I have the honour to report that, in accordance with my advise, the Chief of Bahrein sent a detective to watch Ahm^d-bin-Selman’s movements, and last night the Chief sent me a message to the effect that the person sent by him to the mainland has just returned and reported that the pirate, with four Amair tribesmen, has obtained a boat and is now at Saihat, four miles below Katif, preparing to put to sea. LJ There are generally a large Bahrein boat or two at the Island of Um Nasan, and it is likely that the pirates will make for that island with a view to obtain a boat suitable to their purpose. I have instructed the Chief to send about ten reliable men to tlie island to capture the pirates should they land there. Um Nasan being one of the Bahrein group and belonging to the Chief no complication can arise. I have also advised the Chief to warn all boats putting to sea to keep a look out for the pirates. The Turks have had ample warning, but the only action they will take will be to send a small boat with five or six soldiers from Katif across to Bahrein and back again to impress us with an idea that they are looking for the pirates.

In continuation of my letter No. 159, dated the 19th July 1903, I have the honour to forward, for your information, a translation of a letter I have received from Saiyid Taleb P&amp;sba, Mutessarif of Al-Hassa, on the subject of the pirate, Ahmed-bin Selman. It would seem from the MutessariTs letter that the pirate had left the district when he was sought after by the Turks and has gone towards Koweit; but I may state that the Kaimmakam and the Mutessarif’s messenger have been misled, as Ahmed was at Annich near Katif at the time, anti he was subsequently seen at ^ihat, and, lastly, I hardly think that he would go to Koweit territory. Of course, it is quite possible that it may have been hmted to the pirate to leave the district and go in hiding with some tribe under Sheikh Mubarak ; and with a view to warn Sheikh Mubarak, and, if possible, to effect the capture of the pirate, a letter may be addressed to him on the subject, and request him to have the man seized and sent for trial to Bahrein, where ample evidence can be produced against him. The man is a native of Bahrein and a cousin of Sheikh Isa, so there can be no objection to such a course being taken. Translation of a letter from Saiyid Taleb Pasha, Mutessarif of Nejd, to the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, dated the 20th Rabi-ul-Thani 1321 116th July 19u3). I had, ere this, replied to you by letter about the pirate, Ahmed-bin- Selman, and his companions, whom you asked me to imprison. I gave distinct orders to the Agent of the Kaimmakam of Katif to make enquiries with a view to his pursuing and capturing him. I sent this letter with one of my men in whom 1 have confidence; and he, in company with the Kaimmakam and the Commandant of the forces, Muhammad Ah hffendi, went to the house of Nasir-bin-Mubarak and his neighbours, the Bern Hajir and made a secret search, giving out that they were searching for deserted soldiers. They, however, did not find him, and my messenger returned to me with a reply from the Kaimmakam, stating that, according to authentic reports, the man had left some davs aao towards Koweit along with his cousins, and they have been unable to capture them, 1 have strictly enjoined bun not to neglect this matter, and on receiving news of their return towards Katif, be should pursue and capture them, and inform me of the result at once. You may rest assured that, whenever he returns, he will be captured. Besides this, you may detail men to ascertain his whereabouts and inform me, when I shall carry out your wishes. If you have any important work at Katif, please refer it direct to t e Kaimmakam.

The Chief states that since the British Government prohibit the Arab Chiefs sending out armed boats to patrol the sea against pirates, the Chiefs conform to the policy and rely upon the British Government to employ their 'ood offices when occasion arises, and for this reason Sheikh Jassim j invokes our assistance rather than apply direct to the Turks. I think that this f instance goes to show that it is Sheikh JassinFs desire to cut himself adrift f from the Turks, and not knowing how we should take a direct application ^ for help he makes it through Sheikh Isa. Saeed and Ali, sons of Mohamed-el-Mehanedi, the victims, state that they left Khor Shagig'on the 7th instant, taking with them cash to the amount of Us 2 467-8-0 in ^Rupees, Dollars and Turkish Liras and Rs. 780 worth of nearls to meet some debts in Bahrein and make purchases ; that when on Fasht-el-Debil off Ras Rakan they dropped anchor awaiting a favourable wind to take them to Bahrein and while they were asleep at noon that day, the ffirate Ahmed-bin-Selman, with fourteen companions boarded them and towed them to Howar Island, where the pirates relieved them of everything they possessed and allowed them to go and that they proceeded to Lusail ana renorted the matter to Sheikh Jassim.

I now learn from a confidential source that Memdoub Pasha the Minister of the Interior has tele graphed to the Vail of Bussorah stating that the fre quent recurrence of Piracy and the immunity of the cul prits have given rise to complaints on the part of the British Embassy. It is essential in the Interests of public security that Immediate measure be taken for discovering and capturing the offending parties. Memdoub Pasha lays Tbe Marquess of Lansdowne, K. G.,lays stress on the fact that the apparent inability of coping with these unlawful proceedingswill bring about an intervention on the part of the British Government for the maintenance of tranquillity in the waters in question which is a duty devolving upon the Imperial Ottoman Government. The telegram concluded by saying that such intervention is foreshadowed in the last paragraph of the Embassy's Note Verbale, and as such a contingency would affect the dignity of the State and ought to be avoided, the authorities must take proper measures for putting a stop to these acts of piracy.
