Later References.Office of/the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Bated, 4th Rajah, 1347 e of/the Of 1347 H. B. M’s political Agent, Bahrain Sir, I have the honour to inform you that a question has arisen in connection with the building contracts which were undertaken by Mr. Ghaus for the Bahrain Government. Mr. Ghaus states that he carried out various additional works not included in the specifications,( 1) Cut Stone Pillars to the the office building, (3) Painting some rooms on the upper floor, (4) Certain partitions etc. in the office building which were decided on during the actual buildings. Mr. Ghaus certainly did these things but at the time there was no question of their being paid for. Later on Mr. Ghaus asked for payment for these extra alterations etc. I informed him that I would speak to Shaikh Hamad. The Palace instead of plas Lime plastering matter lapsed until 27-10-46 when I wrote toto Mr. Ghaus informing him that I did not con sider that he had a claim. The letter, apparently did not reach Mr. Ghaus. Mr. Ghaus has now sent in his claim again, but each time with no figures mentioned. Yesterday I spoke to H. E• Shaikh Hamad on the subject. H. E. Shaikh Hamad is strongly of the opinion that nothing more should be paid to Mr. Ghaus. H. E. Shaikh Hamad informed me that he is not, and never was satisfied with Mr. Ghaus’s work and that he was paid too much. As you are the arbitrator in the matter I am referring it to you. My own opinion is that if Mr. Ghaus intended, at the time of building, to charge for the alterations and additions he should have brought up the matter then and not left it until many months later. The Bahrain State has paid the following amounts to Mr. Ghaus. On account of Sea Road Hs. 1,23,190/- I enclose herewith relative correspon dence which please return.

Bahrain Ref. your Number 137 of 1929, dated 13th Feby 1929. I enclose contracts of the Government Office and the palace also some correspondence on the sub9 ject. V/ill you please return them when finished with. I admit that the contractor actually did certain work and built some of the upper rooms of the office building, and I believe in the palace, on rather a different plan to that of the specifi cations but no question of extra payment was raised at the time. Either I or Major Baly, or Major Holmes, who was advising, unofficially, on the building, reco- mended certain alterations which only appeared advantageous as the actual building progressed. It is extremely ill judged of the contractor to refer to any hopes which he entertained of obtain ing distinction from H. M.’s Government by building the Palace. I have spoken to you about this un officially so you know the circumstances. I should like to say that H. E. Shaikh Hamad has always considered that the contractor’s prices were excessive and that the building work, not particularly the sea road^was done with bad material and was not properly finished off. Per sonally I believe that Shaikh Hamad’s opinion is partly the result of local persons who greatly resented a foreigner obtaining the three big con tracts, but at the same time I consider that some of the work on the Government Offices is not v/earing as well as it should, considering the cost. The upper pillars are even now needing support and one of them is in a dangerous condition. This however has no direct bearing on the question of his claims.

His Excellency Shaikh Kamad is not and never has been satisfied with the work done by you and the defects now apparent in the palajice and the Adviser’s house would appear to support his view.

Jo &amp; o /'-f'-V- BUSH 1 RE, 2 5 th I 93 I* (p. G.) sir, I beg to aclaiowledge receipt of your letter ITo .860 dated 15 ^ July I9JI and to reply as follows to the points raised by you. % You state that it would appear from the correspondence on the subject that you axe able to trace that I have not moved in the matter of my claim since January 1929 .T 0 this I would respectfully reply that I have not only been pressing from time to time for the early settlement of my claim,but I even approached you at Karachi in August 1930 and again reminded you vide my letter dated 3 rd September 1930*1^ is only in reply to my last reminder of the 4^ July I93I»^ a ^ a reply has been vouchsafed to me in your letter under ref erence.Then, even if I had not reminded as frequently, I venture to submit that it *&amp;s for your office to dispose of the correspondence and my claim which had been submitted to the Agency by the Bahrein Government at my request .The matter however was held in abeyance and has remained pending in the Agency records upto now. You next state that as far as you can discover from the papers the Bahrein Government have definitely refused to pay any sums over and above those already paid to me.As far as I recollect the Bahrein Govern ment never refused to pay me any sum over and above that already paid to me.On the contrary they were willing to pay me certain items of my claim on condition I agree to drop the remainder.To this I did not agree and ir* accordance with the terms of my agreement I requested the Bahrein Govern ment rS. M. GHAUS. Continued Sheet 1^0.2 Government to refer the matter to the Political Agent for arbitration. The point at issue was to determine vfaether or not I had carried out the items in regard to which I claimed payment, in addition to the work atipulateu xu. conbract.il it ia pi oveu anu a^aitoea enat X uiu ao tne additional work to that for viiich I have alraady been paid,then my claim has to be considered and the Bahrein Government's refusal to pay any sums over and above those already paid to me cannot be accepted as closing the mat/1 ©r • You also state that His Excellency Shaikh Harnad is not and never has been satisfied with the work done by me and that txie defects now apparent in the palace and the Adviser»s home would appear to support his view. Against this I wo tad ask you kindly to peruse the attached copies of unsolicited testimonials granted to me(one by Major Frank Holmes who super, vised the building operations before the arrival of Mr.Belgrave the State adviser and the other by adviser himself under whose personal supervision I have completed all my contracts, aiid these both written in their own hand writing) which express not only the Adviser f s but also H.E. Shaikh Hamad 1 s entire satisfaction at my work.If H.E.was at any time not satis fied with my work he should not have given me the contract for the construction of the Sea face wall in addition to the contract for building the palace and Government offices,and he was at liberty even then to stop me from continuing and completing- the buildings or to refuse ^ pay me in full the contracted amount if the work done by me was bad and/to his sat isfaction.Ha,however, aia none oi tnese tilings and tnat he snoula now entirely change his opinion about my work can only be construed as a plea for avoiding payment of my claim.If after a lapse of five years defects are dbraced in the buildings it remains to be seen whether the defects are due to the faulty construction or the ravages of the extremely humid climate of Bahrein.The defects might be defined so as to enable me to explain them. You finally state that since I have taken no action in the matter for the last two and half years it does not appear to you that you can usefully intervene at this point and you therefore p&gt;-oposfe\the matter es closed.S. M. GHAUS. Continued Sheets The Following is a chronological account of the case. I3-I-27. I submitted my claim to the Adviser Bahrein. 6 - 4 - 27 . I sent a reminder in writing. I made several personal requ © 3 ^ 3 ^ or settlement. 2 - 4-28 i sent a further reminder in writing. I requested that the maUW ’placed before the Political Agent,Bahrein for arbitration. Sometime in February or March 1929 I received a communication from Political Agent,Bahrein asking me to submit details of my claim. Owing to the pressure of fulfilling other contracts and engagements I lost sight of the matter. u August. 1930.1 interviewed Political Agent,Bahrein at Karachi. 3 - 9 -I 930 .I replied to Political Agent,Bahrein stating claim in detail already submitted to Adviser Bahrein,whose records may be consulted. 4 - 7 - 51 , x addressed a reminder to Political Agent Bahrein. /'tnbp rTuK-A tdt' I own I have not been sufficiently in the matter,but I could not give it my continuos attention owing to the demands made upon my time and attention by other engagements.However I relied upon the efficiency of the Political Agent f s office at Bahrein to dispose of all references made to it in due time, and from the above statement of the case you will I trust agree that I have not been quite so neglectful of rty interest in the matter as to justify the case being closed without a truth ful examination ox my ox aim. The fact is that according to the terms of my agreement with the Bahrein Government,to carry out the various works entrusted to me,any differences arising between that Government and me were to be submitted to the Political Agent Bahrein for arbitration.I accordingly asked,since the Bahrein Goverhment did not agree to pay me in full for the additional work done,£hat my claim should be submitted to the Political Agent Bahrein for decision.If therefore after due examination of my clainyou are convinced that I am not entitled to receive any further payments from the Bahrein Government,it is for you to say so definitely and I will abide by the decision. ^t knowing my claim to be just I feel that such will not be your decision.

With reference to your endorsement No. 1428 of the 23rd December, 1931, enclosing a copy of a letter from Mr. Ghaus, the Contractor who built the Sea Hoad, Palace and Government Offices I consider that the applicant’s claim for Rs. 4339/- from the Bahrain State is absurd. I would ask you to refer to the previous correspondence on this subject in which I pointed out that though the contractor did in fact make certain alterations in the buildings during the course of the work yet he did not at the time make any application for additional payment neither did he make any such application on the completion of the contracts when he was paid the various amounts for which he contracted to construct the build ings.Ho: ?3 , Political Agency, Bahrain, the 17th January 1932, To, Mr Muhammad Ghaus, Ahmadiya Business House, Bushire, Dear Sir, Please refer to your letter dated the 11th October 1931 claiming Rs.4,339/- from the Bahrain Government. \ The Bahrain Government have no objection to the case being disposed of by arbitration and I would be glad to know whether you wish to attend personally or whether you wish me to dispose the matter on the evidence you have provided.

Since you have kindly given me the option either to attend personally or to depend on your goodself.and as I have full confidence of receiving justice at your hands I donot feel the necessity of attending personally and request your honour to kindly proceed with the case in a way you may deem fit.If however at a later stage my presence found to be necessary by your honour I shall come personally without fail on hearing from you.

GovarwMort uffice huildincs * The intervention ©f the A^Qucy vas saught by the Adviser in 1928 / when he received the claim ^without any figures) from lir.uhaus. Tiie additions etc as put by Mr, (ihaus are as under, 1, Two extra rooms on the ground floor of the Govt, office and one on the upper floor, 2. Lime plaster over the gutch plaster when the latter had been completed. ^Govt. office,; o. Hall’s distemper to some rooms on the ground floor, 4, Pressed stone pillars in place of ordinary stone* pillars in gutch, when these had been completed.(Palace} Jir.Belgx’ave admits of all these alterations and also that these were not shown on the specif ice. ti on, rather ' on a different plan to that of the specification.'(p. 12 ; There is a slight objection to the item of lime plaster but there also he says that in his opinion this was part of the building though not definitely specified in /£ contract. In short it is admitted by the Bahre in Gbvt, that these additions were done and completed by Mr.Chaos*.) Ui tlieae foraed no part of the plan on which Mr.Ghana had to v/ork and thttt those were done according to the wishes of the aupervising officera. should not .Now remains the question that why/Bahrein Government ihastaatxaKct pay for the work that .they admit was not on the plan and tliat this 'was an additional work and done according to their wishes. They raise the following queationa:- 1. It was understood that he will not be paid for this . 2. He forwarded his claim many months after he had completed and handed over the buildinga♦ 3. The instability of the work done by him. 4. Shaikh Hamad was never satisfied with his work.iMr. Belgrave believes tiiat the cause of Shaikh Hamad’s . s . disatisfaction Yias the influence of the local opinion n who greatly resented a foreigner obtaing three big c ontracts.{page 12 .) 5.in the course of the work Mi’. Ghaus did not make any application for the additional payment. if-'- As regarda the first objection it must have arisen^that as Mr.Ghaus did not object to do the additions he was do w**« asked to/( either by Hr.Belgruvo, Major Daly or did Major Holmes Jada neither/he raiswat any question of additional payiients for these, it meant that lie was well satisfied icbth to do the work within the contract c To some extent it seems x'eaconable that he should have asked for the extra payment if he knew that he was not doing the work within the payment fixed for it 6 But on the other hand he might have been afraid to raise objections to do a work that he was asxed to do by big men that he may lose all wox*k in future by these petty questions^that he was sure /will not be ref used. The fact that he forwarded the claim too late is explained in his letter at page 9, where he says Jrimj t in addition to the change of construction in accordance \rith the advice oi Majoi' B&amp;ly i have carx’ied out many P.t.o.other additions imd alterations to the palace building but for having certain object in view which the Advsr and your honour { Col Barrett.; aloo nay be well aware of ray not having charged anything for same.** It is quite obvious from this that he wanted the then i*.A. to give him the title of K e B 0 for those additions.But when ne could not find any likelihood He thought it best not to lose the amount as well.Hie letter at page 21 shows that the delay was due to the ' pressure of fulfilling / other contracts ' when he lost sight of the roattor. As to the 3rd objection, the instability of the work, the Adviser said in 192^ ' the wox\k on the Government ofiices is not wearing well as it should, considering tbe coat ; and the upx^ttr pillars are even now needing support and one of then is in a dangerous conditions.” The work must nave been not of the oest material but it should have been shown when he handed over the building after duly inspected by the officers concerened as he replies letter at in his^page 19. In the completion certificate the Advsr has written Hr. Ghana's work, which has been under my direct supervision has shown itself to be entirely satisfactory .... ** and iir Gliaus has submitted the copy of the certificate ^page 22 ) showing that the work was good and was appreciated by all and that the defects are t due not to the faulty construction but to the 'ravages of the extremely humid climate of Bahrein'.He also sa^e that if his work was bad the Government was at liberty to stop him from continuing and completeing the work or to refuse full payment.Ipage 20 J The Advar admits at page 12 that this has no direct bearing on the question of hi/ds claims. The fourth objection is Ghuikh Hamad's dissatis- faction.The copy of the'unsolicited testimonial ' as Mr.Ghaus puts it in his letter at i*gG 20 shows that M the result of hia works have given every satisfaction to His Excellency Shaikh Hamad ...' and hr.Gaus has forwarded this copy to this objection referred to in4 in tills office letter Ho:860 dated 15th July . 1^31 a t page 16, He says also that it cannot be u dissatisfaction when he had to remove the construction and replace it as ho was asked to do, Ihe fifth objection that he did not apply for the additional payments either an the course of construction or on the completion,has cone under the first one,It seems,as the B.Govt.eay, quite strange that he should have kept qui^e for so many months and the from iipril 19^8 to August 1930, if the question of h.B.’s title is kept aside it seems quite possible that he was not sure of the payment 0 f the extra work and so he had no idea of claiming it« But as it did not cost him much,he must have thought of trying his luck, that if he gets anything it would be alright otherwise it would be considered as a reminder to what the Adviser and the , do P*A, had to^ about Ijis distinctions, But now when he is completely disappointed about his distinctions and a ray of hope in the correspondence, he lias put his whole heart to fight for the additional payments. In our last letter to him ^at page 30 ) he has been jfcttSabdcaik informed that the matter lias cone to the b.a's arbitration and that either he should come himself to Bahrein or to depend upon the evidence 3 ie had produced heretofore *His reply is at page 31 where he wishes P.A. to dispose of the case in his absence unless his presence is essentially required PNo. 33^ Political Agency, Bahrain, the 15th March 1932* To Mr* Muhammad Ghaus, iihmadiya Business House, BUSH I R G.

A.JArbitration in the claim made by Muhammad CAvuau against the hehrain Government for worka carried out in the year IrSo. The builoin^s in respect of which the claim is aado are the Government builain^ (in which the ^dviser f s office ana private uouse is sttuateu) ane his .Kcellency hiiaikn iiamad’s palace. The work was baseu on a^ecments witn specifications entereo into between the parties and these containeu n clause that in tne event of any dispute between them the matter was to be referred to the Political Agent for arbitration. 2. The claimant,hereafter referred to as tne Contractor,states that he made his first claim regarding the Government buildings in ■ anuary j ciax.-.. for tne palace about the same- time. he also states that he sent a reminder on tue uth ieoruary,but he aid not wnen submitting his claims stake any statement as to how much was due to hirtu* There is no trace whatever of either of these applications in the Adviser^ oil ice ana the earliest letter of nis which can be discovered is a letter dated the 2nd iipril 1928 in which he mentions extra work and &amp;xs for settlement of his claim. The Auviser replieu to this a day or two later on the 27th hnaw&amp;l stating that he did not consider that the Contractor had any claim on the Bahrain htate lor any alterations he had carried out ana asked for full particulars so that he might refer to the Political ^;ent for his opinion. No reply to this letter can be traced,but kr. Ghaus wrote again on the 22nd November 1928 asking for the settlement of his claim. To this tne Adviser replied referring him to his former letter and again asked him for details. Mr. i Ghaus then submitted details of his claim which were: (a). Dismantling 14 gutch pillars and erecting in their place 14 pillars faceu with stone in the palace. (H- gillie plastering the Government buildings insiue and out.(cy • Jonstrue* rocme rad ?, p? rtition A'ail^tnu, (d&gt;. rnintijog rooRB in the upper storey of the office building. Lg still made no ciaia for a fixed amount but obsenrea in a postscript that the danraiu OoTemment could easily calculate tii© cost of the work. 3. Vhe i olitical Kgent propareo to arbitrate in the matter ano askeu tne Adviser for copies of the agreement on the d2na ^ecember 1935 but i see from &amp; letter on the Agency file aateu the Uth January that the contractor went to dushire without waiting for a hearing of his case ana tne {natter was,therefore, shelved pending his return. The contractor contented fcimself with writing to tne Political A.^ent on tfie Qth February (still without stating the amount claimed) ana was asked in reply (loth iirhrch 1929) by the Political ugent to otaie the exact i amount he considered due. He did not reply to this letter. The next letter which can be traced from nim is one oateu the 4tn July 1931 in which the claim is shown as Ls.4,339/-,bat it is # true that he mentioned the rartter verbally to the Political /igent in August 1930 while on recess in nrrehi. ‘ihe Bahrain Government wex^o informed that ids ooritiactor now claimco Ka.4,339/- and they rejected this as absurd. Jr.Chaus was inforaea on the 17th January 1932 that the imhrain Government had no objection to tue case being disposed of by arbliration anu from this arose tne present application for arbitration. 4. i obtained copies of the agreafients witn refjai'a to the construction of both builaings and also visitoa anu inspected tne builain/ts themselves. 1 will take the contractor’s claim in detail. The first it will be remembered reierred to the construction o: pillars of (a'caseu s.^nv. ir. tnu pn^.-.c.. in ^iss&lt; place of 14 pillars of stone anu ,utch which were apparently unsatisfactory, i examinee the contract for the palaoe which states tnat tne exposed faces of the pillars are to be of '’dresseu carried stone,pointed with cement” ana it is in noQ way apparent tuet ai^tiling imu been constructed aiffersat to wnat provided tor in tne contract,for this is exactly what the present pillars are. it may be noted in passing that this work was of poor quality and one of the corner pillars nas already had to be repaired. b. There remains the claim with regard to the Government building, ^irae plastering was not mentioned in the contract of this building,but tne same applies to the palace,but there the contractor carried out identical work without making any claiB for it ana it seems fairly clear that ne lime plastered the Government building for reasons ol his own (possibly to conceal the cracks which are now becoming more ana more evident) and possioiy id consideration of otuer won no was to do by tne contract but was released from doing. The next point is tne two additional rooms ana the partition in tne bath room. It is true tmit certain alterations haa been made in tne design of the lower storey,but these were made at the time the building was constructed and not afterwaras,and the rooms were made by the readjustment oi the ground space, here again it is impossible to say whether inis was not the result Ic^some quid pro quo and if the work was to be charged for a suppltmentary estimate should have been made. In tin ' connection may be noted tne omission of the compound walls ana the gates wnich tne contractor was obliged to erect by the contract and/&gt;ere never constructed at all. G. There remains (d) the painting of certain rooms in the upper storey. It is i/apossible at tuis stage, alter several other coats of paint nave been put on, to assess tnis work, but since it was not mentioned in the contract there is some reason to suppose that it was an additional work and 1 am disposed to admit this claim, the cost of which should be calculated by the Bahrain Government as was originally requested b v the contractor. 7. The correct course for the contractor on being asked to HX&gt; undertake alterations if/concession was granted mm in return, was to submit supplementary estimates and after tney had beenAs © Sfinctioned and the co^t a preed upon, to proceed witn the work. It is clear that the contractor did not choose to do this ana it is impossible at this point to assess what his motives were for omitting to do so. i have,nowever,been snown a ver^ interesting autograph letter signed by -r.Chaus dated the oth April 1127 in which he says referring to the palace ,f it is true i hake promised to make no additional charges for all the adeitions and alterations made suhsepuantly which has itself cost me a tremenuous difference but it will not at the same tine be unfair to ask for compensation for maidag 14 pillars accoruing to specification and when eompieteu had to pull uown to substitute same by dressed stones by order', ihen again in his letter dated dth February 1129 io the loliticai Agent he says ne has carried out many otuer adcutions ana alterations to tne palace buiiuing without having charged for tnis. B. it raust not oe overlooked that the contractor,while receiving payment in full was allowed to omit certain portions of the work contracted for,for instance,the boundary wall and gates of the Government buildings have never been put up at all. i have little uoubt tnat^alteration4took place in the grounu plan of the building or its plastering were compensated for by concessions of this nature and,therefore,reject the contmctor 1 s claim in toto except for the claim (d),painting rooms in the upper storey and the Bahrain Government should estimate the cost of this and hold the amount at ^r.Gnaus• , d^o ♦ 1. The contractor has been extremely lax in pursuing his cleim ana by his own sutki admission took no action between april 1128 and august 1130. .nan as*:ed in arch 1129 by the olitioal Ai:ent to submit details of his claim he never replied and ne attributes this to ti^e pressure of fulfilling otner contracts, he also suaiet that he imagined that once he had made his claim the agency would act automatically in the matter, it should be notea here,however,that when he had been askeu to appear for arbitratin' . without waiting for a settlement ana tnii-Agency which now recexvua some cases a ye;/, cannot oe luqi i expected to interest itseif in an application lor arbitration which has paid no court lees,if the applicant chooses to allow his claim to re min in abeyance two years at a time. 10. lac contractor has mace some play of the fact that he was given a certificate by the huviser on the conclusion of the work to the effect that he anu * haikh named were fully satisfiea with the work that h&amp;u boon done, it should be mentioned that neither -r.Belgrave nor his Excellency Phaikh Hamad are ' engineers and the proof of the pudding is in the eating. I have no hesitation whatever in saying tuat ooth buildings were not of satisfactory workmanship ana the cracks now apparent all over the lower floor walls in the palace ana the collapse of the beams in the passage of the upper floor of tue (tovernment building clearly show tnis. A more eye would doubtless detect other defects which should not exist in a comparatively new building. 11. r ihe award, therefore is, that the Bahrain hoveraaent should estimate tne* cost of the painting done in tue upper storey of tiie Government builaiag ana hold this amount at -nr.uhaus ! disposal. a! 1 other claims are rejected ana the oaurain wovera*. ment are in no way liable for any future claims from ^r.Gh&amp;us on behalf of the palace or public buildings,once this amount has been paid over.
