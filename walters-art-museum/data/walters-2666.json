There are four sons of Horus and this amulet is part of a set of four (Walters 48.1638-1641). The sons of Horus protected he vital organs of the body after mummification.  The image is that of a baboon-headed mummiform human.  The figure faces proper right.  It is composed of blue glazed faience with the details picked out in purple/black manganese. The figure wears a tripartite wig, but unlike the other three in this set he does not wear a broad collar.  There are five diagonal stripes of manganese across the mummiform body representing the mummy wrappings or braces.  A horizontal fracture at knee level separated the amulet into two fragments which have since been reattached. \r\n\r\nNumerous funerary amulets were usually placed among the many layers of linen strips used to wrap mummies. Specific amulets, along with their required position on the body, are listed in funerary texts such as \"The Book of the Dead.\" Amulets were sometimes sewn directly onto the wrappings or could be incorporated into a bead net shroud covering the mummy. These amulets have been modeled with a flat underside and are pierced by tiny holes around the edges for attachment.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/4506", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "23rd-25th Dynasty", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2009-09-17T15:10:01.847", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1641_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1641_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1641_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1641_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1641_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "2054, 10, 2513, 2704", "Images": "CUR_48.1641_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_48.1641_Rev_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_48.1641_SideA_DD_RS2009.jpg, PL1_42.373_48.1667-1668_48.1634-1637_48.1638-1641_Fnt_TR_T84II.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
