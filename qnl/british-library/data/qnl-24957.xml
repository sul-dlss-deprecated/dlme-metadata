To Dated Bushire the 7th January, 194/?, FOREIGN, NEW DELHI, Subject: Conveyance Allowance to Reference memorandum No. F. 20(12)-E(A)/38 dated the 26th March, 1938, from the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, sanctioning a conveyance allowance of Rs. 30/- per mensem to the Medical Officer, Kuwait. 2. The present rate of conveyance allowance of Rs. 30/- per mensem sanctioned in 1938 is obviously inadequate at present since the wages of a driver-cleaner alone in Kuwait are over Rs. 150/- per mensem. Again, the Medical Officer has recently had to import from India spare parts costing about Rs. 285/- which, in normal times, would not have cost more than Rs. 70/-. The prices of tyres and tubes have increased proportionately. It is therefore indisputable that the Medical Officer is put to considerable loss in maint aining in running order a motor car which is essential for the efficient discharge of his duties. A case for an increase in the Conveyance allowance should have been made long ago, but was not done as it was erroneously believed that the increase in cost of labour and material was only of a temporary nature. With the Kuwait Oil Company opening up their activities, conditions are not likely to improve, and may deteriorate still further. 3. There is no question of the Medical Officer not maintaining a driver-cleaner as his car must remain attended at piers where he has to leave it while he visits ships in Kuwait bay during the course of his duty. 4. I accordingly recommend strongly that his conveyance allowance be increased to at least Rs. 150/- per mensem with effect from the 1st January, 1946. = BRITAIN = The issue of the above has been authorised.

I should have thought that this would be sufficiently attractive, but if something better is necessary I would be inclined to increase the taxable income to say £1200 rather than the Jbreign Service Allowance* A tax- free allowance of £1500 per annum plus free accommodation is high compared with the usual run of this allowance. # I concur in the terms of the draft letter to ur~. -d • » .

Office. 2. It Y/as felt that the matter might most conveniently be considered under heads; (a.) H.M.G, f s international responsibilities, (b) the provision of medical facilities for H.H.G.’s own representatives in the Gulf, and (o) the political importance of G. undertaking medical commitments in the axea in excess of their minimum internalionvl responsibilities. 3. As regards (a.) Intornat ional r^seonsibilit ies . it v/as explained that these Arab States (except for Muscat; had no international sta.tus, and that their international commitments woro devolved upon H.H.G. by treaties and agreements. In addition, under article 90 of the International Sanitary Convention of 1926 H.II.G. undertook a. special responsibility for quarantine control in the Persian Gulf, though the precise meaning of this article v/as far from clear. It was open to H.H.G. t^ persuade the various Rulers to assist by the provision of quarantine and other health measures from their own resources, and to arrange for the levying of quarantine fees from the shipping and air companies which used the Gulf ports and airfields. Sir R. Hay mentioned that Bahrein and Hu seal already paid a contribution towards the cost of British quarantine officers in these Stales. Among the measures necessary would be the regular provision and dissemination of epidemiological reports. * A. Provision of medical fa-ciliti^s for H.m.G. *3 pan representatives i n the Gulf . This had hitherto been a responsibility of the Residency sA*go on, and the surgeons attached to the Agency staffs. Sir R. Hay stated TJ^at at Bahrein it would be possible as an alternative for such facilitios' to be provided by the Bahrein Stale Hospital on payment of a contribution by H.H.G., and at H'uscal/by the .unerican mission. ^ siniilHr rrra.n^omont i 1 i ght ^ j 1 + 1 ^ 'i t j—\&lt;dien the—new-K owe it Govum m-ffe hOGpittl ' Wen oampletod-.,. /55 .

Government already had o. rca.s on ably efficient nedica.l organisation though this at present v/as mainly concerned '/itn curative ra.thcr than preventive measures. It v. r a,s desirable to encourage other States, such as iiov:eit and Qatar, vhich had the necessary financia.1 resources, to do likcy/ise. The Trucial. States hov/cver were very poor and ba.clcv/ard, and it wen considered that here there \7c.s a. strong cane for the provision by H.n.G. of sor.ic direct ncdice.l facilities such an the establishment of a dispensary. Similarly the continued maintenance .of the dispensary a.t idusca.t should, if possible, be arranged. From the political point of vic\7 these steps vould be likely to have a beneficent effect. o. It i/as in the light of the above considerations, the meeting felt, that the main recommendation of Dr. Pridie’s report, namely the appoint ment of a Hcallth ^divser to the Political Resident at a salary of aoout ,12,500 a. year, could best be considered. The recomncnGaition ’./an tha.t this appointment should be made additional to the existing staff. The Foreign Office pointed out tha.t this ’.mould be subject to Treasury approval. It -.an mar^od hov/cvcr that a good cane could be made out for the appointment of such an officer for a period of 15 months, during v/hich tine he r/ould be expected to drav; up a report making recommendations for the future medical set-up in the Gulf. ^ suitable officer for such an appointment might be found from the Indian medical Service, but since that service was being disbanded on 15 th x.ugust it would be desirable to take steps to this end as soon as possible, salary of the range of 12,000 - 12,500 per annum v/ould in any case be necessary, meanwhile the existing establishment should be maintained, tne Indian medical staff being retained on deputation terms subject to t 110 agreement of the Government of India.

In the period between the wars# as a measure of economy the I.M.S* post at Muscat was abolished being replaced by an I.M*D* post and surgeon of the latter were combined resulting in the under-staffing noted by Dr. Pridie.

Regarding the staff recommended in para 6 (b) of Dr. Pridia's note, the Govemaent of India has never found it possible to staff its Persian Gulf posts on the lavish scale recommended by Dr. Pridie. If H.M.G. can do so the advantages are obvious# but it must be remembered that Suropean medical men of standing will not, in these days, be found for Persian Gulf posts unless the latter carry with them full modem amenities such as air conditioning, which are now recognised as essentials and not luxuries.

Subsequently, with the development of the States* Medical Services this establishment might be reduced and arrangements made for the Oil Company* s doctors to treat members of the Residency and Agency staffs.

I have the honour to be, With the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, The Right Honourable Ernest Bevin, M.R. , &lt;Sgd.) RANaff) CAMPBELL Foreign Office, London,S* W* 1.Dear Miss Waterlow, : I are sorry not to have been able to reply earlier to your telephone call last week about Cable 390 fra Cairo, but the research required has taken rather a long time. I find that the sanita. y defence of the Persian Gulf has received considerable attention at Sanitary Conferences for many years, and I think I had better start with the earliest references I have been able to trace. According to a report -from Dr. Theodore Thomson in 1906 f the Convention drawn up at the International Sanitary Conference, 1894» 'provided for the establishment of a lag© lazaret with complete sanitary staff and equipment at Fao, a small lazaret near Basra, and sanitary posts at Basra (then already established), Xoweit, Manama in Bahrein, Bandar Abbas, Bushire, Mohamnerah, Owadar, and Maskat. The British Government, however, did not accept that part of the Convention which embodied these proposals, and the scheme wasnot carried out. This scheme, indeed, was thrown over board at the 1897 Conference, the Convention of that year providing simply for a sanitary station near Basra and another at or in the neighbourhood of the Island of Hormuz or of Kishra. near the entrance to the Gulf. These proposals -were accepted by the British Government, and Persia also ratified the Convention Miss Waterlow. * • Middle East Department, Foreign Office, Downing Street, S.W. 1.Convention, subject to the reservation that the station at the entrance to the Gulf should he under the Persian flag and should have Persian guards'. The International Sanitary Convention, 1903, provided for the Basra station as before, and for ^ sanitary station at Hormuz (copy of text attached). 'The British Delegates were empowered by His Majesty^ Government to sign that Convention, subject to reservations regarding the finding of the funds for the construction of the proposed station near the entrance of the Persian Gulf, and the reorganisation of the Constantinople Superior Board of Health, which is charged, under the Convention, with the construction upkeep, and control of this station. The British Government, however, through its delegation, expressed its doubts as to the necessity of such a station, pointing out that the experience of recent years lent no support to that view and in addition,* called in question the suitability of Hormuz, with its unhealthy climate, as a site for that purpose.' The 1903 Convention was not ratified until 1907» and meanwhile a proposition was made that the observation station near the entrance to the Gulf, which had never come into being, should be placed on the Island of Hen jam and should be constructed, maintained and controlled by the Persian Government instead of the Constantinople Superior Board of Health. It was for this reason that Dr. Thomson visited the Persian Gulf and made his report, which proposed that the 'scheme best adapted, in the cii*eumstaaces to secure a reasonable degree of protec tiou to Bur ope and the minimum of interference with commercial interests in the Gulf of Persia, consists in the perfecting of theEXT I i /! ‘ JL the present sanitary stations at Bfohanimerah and Bushire, the estahlishment of a sanitary station at Koweit, and the creation of a new station in place of that now existing at Basra. Sanitary defence of the Gulf hased on these lines will afford a greater degree of protection to Europe against plague and cholera than would he secured hy a sentinel station near the entrance of the Gulf combined with a terminal station at Basra; and will not imnose on shipping the unnecessai»y and prejudicial restrictions that would result frem the latter scheme.* - The provisions in the 1903 Convention were revised at the 1912 Conference on the grounds that the orocedure had the double inconvenience of taking off their course a large proportion of the ships^entering the Gulf and imposing on them a delay, varying between three and twenty hours, whilst sanitary measures were carried out. On the other hand, epidemics of plague and cholera had occurred in 1904 in certain ports on the Gulf and surrounding areas without its having been carried (at least directly) by ships coming from India and other foreign countries, and the sanitary establishment at the entrance to the Gulf had been unable to prevent transmission of the diseases from one coastal region to another. The Conference therefore decided that the sanitary defence of the region should be left to the competent authorities in the two interested countries (copy of the relative Article ( 83 ) in the 1912 Convention is attached). Article; Article 90 of the International Sanitary Convention, 1926 replaced Article 83 of the 1912 Convention. A despatch from the United Kingdom delegation during the 1926 Conference states that towards the conclusion of the final sitting of the Conference an effort was made, without success, by the Persian delegation, supported by the Hedjaz and the Soviet delegations, to eliminate this Article « on the grounds that Persia was fully competent to administer the sanitary services in her ports without foreign intei»vention. The Persian delegate had for some days been active lobbying ' ny delegations likely to be sympathetic to his contention, and a vote on a show of hands produced ten for and ten against this . proposal, with many abstentions. Before proceeding to a poll, the United Kingdom delegation took the opportunity of explaining briefly the serious consequences of the Persian proposal which had been sprung upon them so late in the course of the conference as to render diplomatic negotiations impossible. None the less they had proposed that Article 90 should be replaced by an article saying that the sanitary regime in Persian ports would be determined by subsequent negotiations between H.M* Goverrment and the Persian Government. The Persian delegate, however, declined to consider any compromise. The United Kingdom delegation alluded to the greatly increased danger of the spre id of infection due to the construction of the Basra-Baghdad Railway and the motor convoys which run between Baghdad and Beyrout, and urged the importance of the issue on which the vote would be taken, and the resulting vote completely reversed the previous vote and the Persian proposal was defeated by a large majority. The Persian delegate then put in the reservation which is contained . atOB’ VEiJaJS JOi'iYS iTIOii 1897 tor tlie prevent ion of the introduction spread of the plague, and for the necessary sanitary supervision of the Red Sea and Persian Gulf traffic II. Sanitary jpgsts in the Persian Gulf There are two places in the Persian Gulf where the establislment of sanitary posts is expedient - one in tlv* Straits of Ormuz (the Islaiid of Oniuz, the Island of kisiin, or, failing these, a j/lace to be settled in their vicinity); the other at a place to be settled in the neighbourhood of Bassorah. provided with at least two doctors, and with sanitary officers and guards and complete appliances for disinfection.

The sanitary posts at Omuz and Bassorah shall be under the control of the Constantinople Board of Health. The Ottoman and Persian Governments shall come to an agreement with regard to the post at Ormuz. Until the Ottoman and Persian Governments have arrived at this agreement, a sanitary post shall be established as a temporary measure in one of the islands in the Straits of Ownuz, and the Board of Health shall post doctors and sanitary guards at this place.

It will take some time to obtain the information required by the Government of India regarding the willingness of the various members of the staff to continue to serve in the Gulf. This information is being collected and a separate report will be submitted in due course. (b) Quarantine arrangements. I have as yet submitted no proposals regarding the future quarantine arrangements in the Gulf as I have been'without expert advice. A medical officer has now been deputed by H.M.G. to examine the subject and is likely to arrive in Bahrain on the 1 st So far as I am aware Indian pilgrims will be vezy little affected by any quarantine arrangements we may make in the rur. ports. Probably of such pilgrims whether bound for Kerb el a or Ifecca disembark at Basra. Unless there happened to be a serious epidemic in Iraq, when we should have to put a quarantine station on the Iraq-Kuwait land frontier, such pilgrims woaP 1 not come within the scope of our quarantine operations.^ I think practically all quarantine buildings and equipment proper in the Gulf are owned by the States concerned. This point is being checked. There is, however, a considerable amount of equipment in Government dispensaries which is the property of the Government of India either solely or jointly with H.ILG. Lists of such equipment are being prepared.iXh^ o V, MEDICAL SERVICES. These can be divided into two main headsJ (a) Residency and Agency Medical officers officers and (b) Quarantine arrangements. Residency and A gency Medical Officers a nd subordinate staff. It is necessary to consider first the maintenance of the existing organization during the ’'Agency' 1 period from 1st April 3 1947 to 1st April 3 1948 3 and second the ultimate future of the existing staff. The Political Resident should asccrtain 3 as soon as possible, whether Lt. Steele, Dr, Hynes, Captain Mathews, and Sub-Assistant Surgeons from Bombay and the Punjab serving in Muscat and the Trucial coast respectively, will be willing -- subject in the case of the two last-named to the approval of their existing posts up to 1st April, 1948, or such earlier date as H.M.G. may fix for their relief, on the existing terms. Similar information should be obtained regarding such of the inferior staff as is recruited from India and or employed on a permanent basis. No indication regarding the ultimate future of the staff can be given until H.M.G's intentions are known; but in regard to all Indian members of the staffs it will be useful to know whether the individual concerned would wish to continue to serve in the Gulf should an opportunity occur on satisfactory terms, or would in any case wish to return to India. A complete and up to date list of medical staff in the Gulf, both gazetted and subordinate, is required, giving in the case of tne latter details of appointments, permanent or temporary, with date on which sanction expires in the case of the latter, and scales of pay, with pay at present drawn in each case.V* k Ulh- (b) Ouaranti no arryin^omcnt.s. It is understood that tho Political Resident has had under consideration a general overhaul and considerable expansion of tho existing quarantine system in the Gulf. Nothing is known of those proposals hero, which will become a matter primarily for the consideration of H.M.G. The only aspect in which tho Govt, of India's particular interests may bo involved is as regards that portion of the Indian pilgrim traffic which uses the Persian Gulf route; should this aspect enter into the Political Resident's proposals we should be glad to receive details at this stage.

GULF. 1* There exist two principal International Treaties relating to quarantine, the International Sanitary Convention, 1926 and the International Sanitary Convention for Aerial Navigation, 1933* Both these Conventions were modified in 1944 so as to take account of war conditions and of the existence of UNRRA* By the Protocols of 1946 both Conventions were prolonged in force until the date on which they shall be superseded by new Conventions. Under arrangements dating from 1864, quarantine arrangements in the Persian Culf were in the hands of British Medical Officers lent by the Government of India from the Indian Medical Service. Expenditure on the quarantine service was snared between fha iVr.uau rtrl I 1 -anrfc. Imperial and Indian revenues. At the International Sanitary Convention in Paris, the meetings of which concluded in June, 19A6, the Persian representatives endeavoured unsuccessfully to secure recognition of the fact that Persia was- now fully competent to administer the sanitary services in her ports without foreign intervention. Article 90 of the International Sanitary Convention, 1926, refers to sanitary control in the Persian Gulf as follows 'In so far as navigation of the Persian Gulf is concerned, the sanitary contro] provided for in Part I of this Convention shall be appl 6 y sanitary author ties of ports of departure as well as of arrival'. 2. In signing the Convention, the Plenipotentiaries of Persia declared that nothing justified the maintenaiice of a special provision regarding the Persian Gulf and they therefore made the most express reservations in regard to Article 90. They refer re declared that the status quo in the Gulf could not in any way bind their Government. To this the British Plenipotentiaries replied by a counter-reservation saving the status quo pending the conclusion of an agreement on the subject between H.M.G. and Persia. 3* Under the Convention of 1926, therefore, responsibility for the SBefficiency of quarantine services in the Persian Gulf rested with the Government of India. As a result of negotiations between H.M.G. and Persia responsibility for quarantine control on the Persian sid e of the Gulf was in 1928 transferred to Persia. The Government of India retained responsibility for quarantine arrangements on the Arab Coast. 4. The representatives of the Government of India signed the International Sanitary Convention of 1926 with a reservation regarding the comoulsory notification of contagious diseases as required by Article 8 . Bvt the Government of India have never ratified this Convention, nor have they adhered to the Convention for Aerial Navigation of 1933. On the other hand; India has always undertaken to conform as far as possible to the provisions of these Conventions t and this undertaking presumably applies to the arrangements for sanitary and quarantine control in the Persian Gulf. 5. There are three recognised quarantine stations on the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf at Kuwait, Bahrein and Muscat, with an officer of the I.M.S. as Quarantine Medical Officer at each station. Until recently the Residency Surgeon at Bahrain acted as Chief Quarantine Medical Officer, Arab Coast, and was responsible for the general efficiency of the quarantine arrangements in the various agencies. Major A«M. Greenaway has now retired from this appointment and it appears that the Government of India does not propose to fill this vacancy, on the grounds that: (a) no I.M.S. officer is available for the appointment, and (b) future medical arrangements in the Gulf will soon be the concern of H.k.G. It is therefore proposed that Lt. M.Ii.A. Steele, the Quarantine Medical Officer at Bahrain, shall also undertake duties of Residency Surgeon/and this arrangement will presumably continue during the contemplated transition period.6# The principal Quarantine Regulations which are applicable to the Persian Gulf are those to be observed on the appearance of plague, cholera, yellow fever and certain other communicable diseases such as typhus and smallpox. Smallpox is endemic in the Persian Gulf and the disease frequently assumes epidemic proportions particularly in the area of Bahrein, the Trucial Coast and Muscat. Epidemics are ^ reported by Cable &amp; Wireless as soon as they occur. Weekly Health Reports are received at Bahrein from Karachi and Baghdad. Reports on the working of quarantine on the Arab Coast rendered annually by the Residency Surgeon have been generally satisfactory. The organisation of the quarantine stations at Karachi, Bahrein and Muscat is good. There are also isolation camps at Dubai and Sharjah which are run satisfactorily by the Shaikhs of those places under the advice of the Medical Officer at Dubai. No cases of plague, cholera, yellow fever or typhus have been mentioned in Annual Reports for the last six years, though a letter from Col. Hay in September, 1946 (Ext. 6372/46) referred to a case of yellow fever in a ship visiting Has Tanura. We are not in possession of information as to how far the quarantine services in the Gulf are able to comply with the detailed provisions regarding the measures to be taken at ports on arrival and departure of vessels, or at airfields on the arrival and departure of aircraft. But we know that the Quarantine Medical Officer at Bahrein is called upon to do a vast amount of technical quarantine wrork in connection with shipping (principally tankers) calling at Bahrein. Oh the other hand, the special conditions in the Gulf Shaikdoins must inevitably put a number of limitations on the application of some of the regu±«rti.aA*- contained in the International 0 .xiitary Convention, 1926, and the International Convention for Aerial Navigation, 1933* It was only in 1942, for example, that a law was passed in Bahrein for the compulsory notification of infectious diseases and there are still no quarantine precautions in this port in respect of travellers arriving by air, of passengers and crews in country craft, or of personnel of the Arabian-American Oil Company who flock to the island from the mainland. 7. In September, 1946, the Political Resident indicated that all quarantine arrangements in the ports of the Gulf Shaikhdoms required overhauling, and he promised to report on the position in due course, (Ext. 6372/46). More recently, when the question of a successor to the post of kesidency Surgeon was being considered, the Political Resident proposed to the Government of India that a competent I.M.S. officer should be appointed for a fixed period to study the whole medical and quarantine organisation in the Gulf and make recommendations for the future. The Government of India, however, for the reasons given in paragraph 5 above have rejected this proposal and it seems clear that the existing arrangements will continue until H.M.G. takes over the responsibility for quarantine control on the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf. It therefore seems desirable that we should now ask Col. Hay if he and the already overworked Lt. Steele could supply a report on the present position regarding quarantine arrangements in the Gulf with recommendations as to the future organisation.

It 4 *' 2. I am very much disappointed at the refusal of the Government of India to send me an I.M.S. officer to help me in making recommendations regarding the future medical set up in the Gulf. I regard it as almost certain that a Residency Surgeon will be required permanently and I should have expected that those concerned with the future of European I.M.S. officers would have been at pains to fill an appointment which will probably continue to exist after the services of British officers in India have been dispensed with. 3. In the meanwhile I am in a very awkward position. I shall presumably during the next few months have to make recommendations for the future organisation of this Residency and its subordinate offices and activities and I shall find myself in great difficulty if I have no officer competent to advise me on the medical side. Since Rooney died in 1941 the post of Residency Surgeon has been held by stop-gaps and all medical activity has stagnated. The Government dispensaries at Bahrain, Kuwait and Muscat are just carrying*qut without sufficient funds or equipment and ought eitlier to be run properly or abandoned. We have money to build hospitals or dispensaries at Dubai and Doha but nothing has been done for lack of expert advice, and as I have already pointed out, vide paras 4 and 6 of my demi-official letter Io .737- , f i n-H in ■ .n - -t. -—v, n -n 1946 to \ eightman, our quarantine arrangements are most inadequate and Require thorough overhauling. To illustrate my difficulties, one matter that is most urgent -is the provision of a residence for the Quarantine Medical Officer Kuwait. He is at present living in a leased house, and the lease terminates in March 1948. The owner is not willing to renew it, it is impossible to obtain any other suitable accommodation and we must therefore make up our minds either to abolish the appointment or build a new house for the incumbent. I have little doubt in my own mind that the latter is the correct alternative but I should feel much happier in making a recommendation accordingly if I had competent medical advice behind me. 4. In the light of the above remarks I' hope you will be able either to persuade the Government of India to send me a European I.L1.S. officer or to find a suitable medical officer from some other source. An officer with administrative experience in the East is required and if the Government of India are unable to assist possibly you may be able to obtain a suitable incumbent The India Office, London.2 '•v incumbent from the Sudan. A retired I.M.S. officer might fill the bill but it might be difficult to find one who could stand up to the climate of the Gulf. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to .Veightman..

He is of the opinion that as Great Britain has acceded to the various international sanitary conventions (see in particular Article 83 of the International Sanitary Convention of 1912, copy enclosed for ready reference), we are, vis-a-vis the outside world, responsible for Kuwait’s execution of the Quarantine Regulations while the actual agency by which they are executed is a matter for settlement between the Kuwait Government and ourselves.

Would you please refer to paragraph 6 of your confidential letter No. 737-S dated 10th September, 19A-6, addressed to Weightman, in which you refer briefly to the need.for overhauling the quarantine arrangements of the ports of the G-ulf Shaikhdoms? I have now seen the correspondence ending with Crichtons letter to you No. F.12(if)-E/47 dated 18 th March about the general problem of medical organisation and quarantine control in the Persian Gulf. 2. We have at present little information on the working of quarantine arrangements on the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf, except that contained in the Annual Reports by the Residency Surgeon, but it seems likely that the special conditions in the Gulf must inevitably put a number of limitations upon the application of some/&lt;cl some of the provisions of the International Sanitary convention of 1926 and the International Sanitary Convention for Aerial Navigation, 1933, 3* This is a matter which must soon engage the attention of and we should like'to obtain within the next few months a general picture of the existing medical and quarantine organisation in the Ghilf. We realise that it must be a matter of some inconvenience to you that the G-overnment of India have been unable to depute an 1.11,3. officer to study the problems in the Gulf, and that Steele must be greatly overworked by combining.the duties of Residency Surgeon and Quarantine Medical Officer, Bahrein. Nevertheless, it seems very desirable that some attempt should be made to report on the.existing situation and to make recommendations for the future organisation of medical and quarantine services in the Gulf. 4. I do not know how far you have been able to proceed with the proposal put forward in your letter of 10 th September, 1946, to prepare a report of this / nature.nature, but I should be glad if you could let us have as soon as possible your own statement of the present position together with recommendations for the future.M opy of derai-oif iciai lot teg' Wo »411i-]| (D )/46, dated tr:e 19th Octobor 1946, from no Under Secretary to th« Li i&gt;i 4^ U/662 dated the 27th June 1946 to Ui / ,* uan, and to enclose f copy of b telegram sent to the Secretary of Jt^-te, for India on the subject of the transfer of t: o Residency ‘Surgeon r s post from Bushire to Bahrain* Surgeon, Bahr in’*, and I am to invite your vim/s on ‘oe emolu'nrnts which you consider should be can ic o by the new post* Be'ails of the change that will be affecon between the Residency Surgeon/s present and proposed duties, my also kindly be furnished.

I promised that the Political Department would communicate with the Foreign Department of the Government of India in regard to the first point A&amp;rformtNl; in regard to the second point a proposal for a Resident Medical Officer at Sharjah was already under the active consideration of His Majesty’s Government. It was agreed that it would prohahly he a good thing to get hold of Dr. Morgan on his return from Geneva and explain the whole position informally to him in order that he might he able to pass on any necessary information informally to the Director of the Paris Office or anyother member that might raise the subject. It was felt that there was no necessity for any official pronouncement on the matter.// &lt;•' P.z. 7018/1936. d 1 Crl rtfh faatj n/t heuit ? bt vmiM-Au. k^n A mH\ QZr~ktkt*J /^VtUA . 73. h' CtoMirt* Please see attached letter from Dr.Morgan. v Xfi ' The matter is one of considerable importance and I find 7 myself unable to give a satisfactory reply to the letter. These towns on the Persian Gulf which till recently were remote from civilization have suddenly found themselves on a main line of air-travel. A quarantine organization suited to the new conditions is needed and I think there need be no difficulty in making a proper arrangement. The weak point in the present scheme is Sharjah which seems to have no medical officer at all. The best means of dealing with the problem would be to ask Government of India to consult their P.H.C. as to the organization of prooer quarantine supervision over the whole of the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf.where the working of the scheme should be placed under the supervision of the P.H.C. I do not know who is to pay for the quarantine, but the cost should be very small. India is keenly interested in these aerodromes from the point of view of the possible introduction of yellow fever by air traffic, and as the medical officers at present employed are recruited from India, there are obvious advantages in giving control to the Indian Government. I do not think we are justified in pressing Dr.Morgan to give an assurance to the Office International on the lines of the Foreign Office letter of 23rd July, 1936. Perhans an informal conference would clear the air. J.Y.D.Megaw. 18. 9. 36.Cl » rs I confess quite frankly that I am rather uneasy about the whole matter and feel personally disinclined to take the responsibility of giving the assurances referred to above on the strength of the information that is at present in my hands. In the circumstances I should be grateful for your opinion on the matter in general and, in particular, whether on these assurances it would be possible to establish some machinery in the near future by which regular periodic communications could be made to the Paris Office concerning the epidemiological conditions in and around the aerodromes concerned, and urgent communications whenever circumstances called for them. As you know, the Paris Office meets on October 19th and this would ordinarily be the first available opportunity for imparting to the Office the information referred to in the Foreign Office letter of the 23rd July.

Subjects- Sanitary administration on the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf. with reference to your Express Letter No. P.Z. 1454/36 of the 13th Aarch 1936, with enclosures. In the first place it may be as well to ihdicate what is the present machinery for dealing with the sani tary administration of the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf. ^On the Iranian coast this Besidency has of course no responsibility! the quarantine administration being entirely in the hands of the Iranian medical autho ritiesj. At Bushire there is a Residency Surgeon of the Indian Medical service, who is the Chief Quarantine Medical officer for the Coast in question, and who has immediately under him at Bushire an Assistant Surgeon. At Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat, besides the Political Agents, there are Assistant Surgeons of the Indian Medi- cal Bepartment, who are Quarantine Medical officers for the local Eulers, and who work under the residency our- geon by whom their activities are co-ordinated. # -ACivil....* 2* The three weak limks in the quarantine chain are ia) the Trucial Coast, where we have a Residency Agent hut no Medical officer, U&gt;) Gwadur, which though belonging to Muscat is situated on the Baluchistan coast, where though there is a Residency Agent there is no Medical officer, and where moreover the aerodrome is situated some twelve miles inland from the town, and (c) the Batineh coast stretching from muscat up to the Has Musandam peninsula. With regard to la). 1 have suggested that an Assistant Surgeon should he posted at Sharjah for work on the Trucial Coast, hut there are financial diffi culties in the way of this proposition and the question is under the consideration of the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government - vide correspondence ending with Government of India letter Ho. 5'. 31 (5)-H/ 35 of the 5th Jb'ebruaBy 1936. With regard to lb). The Political Agent, Muscat, has suggested that the post of Hesidency Agent there should he held by a retired Sub-Assistant Surgeon who could perform the duties of local Medical Officer, and 1 will address the Government of India separately on this subject. With regard to Ic). l have no proposals to make for this area since it is comparatively unimportant; unlike la) rnd lb) neither steamships nor air services touch there though it is visited occasionally by His Majesty’s Ships and Hoyal Air .force aircraft. 3. The Assistant Surgeons at Kuwait and Bahrain have in the past attended to the Sea services and have now extended their duties to the Air Services under theCivil Air Agreements 'between His majesty's Government and the two Kulers concern eci. The Assistant ourgeon at muscat, owing to the Gwadur aerodrome 'being on the opposite coast, is unable to do any work in connection with the Air Services, 4. With regard to the smallpox epidemic cut of which the present correspondence has arisen, the course of events was as follows. un the 30th December 1935 in a telegram to me in connection with a proposed flight of aircraft along the Trucia_l Ooast, the Air Officer Commanding, Bagdad, mentioned that the flight might have to avoid Sharjah owing to smallpox. on the same day I received a tele gram from the Political Agent, Bahrain, that smallpox had broken out on the Trucial Coast and telegraphed to the Political Agent, Bahrain, that the residency Agent, Sharjah, with whom he is in wireless touch, should arrange with the Shaikh of Sharjah and Imperial Airways Station Superintendent to isolate the Imperial Airways Best House from the town. On the 31st December the Air Officer Commanding telegraphed to me that he was sending a Hedical officer by imperial Airways' plane of that date to vaccinate all personnel of the nest xiouse. This telegram was repeated to the Political Agent, Bahrain, and the Senior Naval Officer, Bersia_n Gulf, so all who were locally concerned knew what was happen ing. on the 4th January, having obtained from the residency Agent through the Political Agent, Bahrain, the number of cases and deaths, I sent the following telegram addressed ; Government of India, repeated minister, Tehran, Consul Basra for information of Port Health...-5- concerned* Dr.Barrett Heggs makes no mention of this latter telegram though i assume he was informed of it hy the Bort Health officer, Basra* There is no need for an Elpidemiological information service within the Gulf to he arranged internationally, as suggested hy Dr. Barrett Heggs. The machinery detailed in paragraph 1 above is quite adequate, and in the present instance has worked well. 6. The vaccination at Sharjah referred to in Dr. Barrett Heggs 1 letter of 6th January 1936, Ho. H.366 to the Ministry of interior, Bjablic Health Directorate, Bagdad, was carried out partly hy the iloyal Air Borce Medical Officer referred to in the Air Officer Command ing Bagdad's telegram of 31st December, partly hy the Station Superintendent, Imperial Airways, and partly hy a vaccinator and the Assistant Surgeon, Bahrain, sent hy the Political Agent of that place. Vaccination is, moreover, carried out on the Trucial Coast as opportunity offers and in December 1934 the Medical Officer from Bahrain carried out over 300 vaccinations, mostly at Dihai, and vaccinated the 37 guards and 4 other employees of the Airways* Station. 7. With regard to the possibility of cholera reach ing Iraq via the Persian Gulf referred to hy Dr^Barrett Heggs in his first letter of 6th January. In the opinion of the Hesidency Surgeon cholera is more likely to reach Iraq via the Persian than the Arab side of the Gulf, and on the latter side we should get warning from the Political Agents at muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait. 8.

T. Morgan of the Ministry of Health, raises the question of the Sanitary administration at aerodromes on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf. It is understood that Dr.Morgan has communicated unofficially to Major-General Sir John Megaw copy of the correspondence in question. 2. The International Sanitary Convention for Aerial Navigation, signed at The Hague, 12th April, 1933, came into force on the 1st August 1935 (Treaty Series No.19 (1935) Cmd.4938). According to the terms of the excluding declaration made at the time of signature by the United Kingdom plenipotentiary under paragraph 1 of Article 65, the convention is not applicable to British Colonies and Protectorates unless notice has been given by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom that it is desired to apply the convention to any of these territories. Although, therefore, the convention is not applicable to the Arab States of the Persian Gulf which are under British protection (and in Mr. Eden’s view all these territories are from the international point of view under British protection, except Muscat), Mr. Eden is of opinion that it is/ The Under-Secretary of State, India Office.is open to His Majesty^ Government to give the required notice in respect of these States, including Bahrain and Koweit, hut excluding Muscat. I am to point out, however, that the convention prescribes certain measures which are to he taken by the contracting parties, and to refer in this connexion to Articles 3 and 7. These measures should ordinarily he taken before the Convention is applied to the territories concerned* 3* Mr. Eden would he glad to receive the views of the Marquess of Zetland as to the advisability of such notice being given on behalf of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf under British protection* 4. If it is thought inadvisable to do this either because His Majesty*s Government in the United Kingdom have not previously extended conventions to the Gulf States under the colonial articles of conventions and this may lead to suggestions for other extensions (such as the Sanitary Convention itself) which may be undesirable, or because, owing to the fact that the native rulers enjoy internal independence and have in most cases only somewhat primitive machinery of government. His Majesty’s Government could not be sure that conventional obligations undertaken would be fulfilled, it may nevertheless be desirable that it should be possible for the Ministry of Health to give to the International Public Health Office assurances to the following effect: (1) that in the aerodromes used by Imperial Airways on the Gulf all the usual health precautions will be taken; and (2) that the Political Residents and Political Agentsi in the Gulf will use their best efforts to see that the ordinary sanitary precautions are taken in the territories of the Arab States there and that information relating to these states* of the kind which is usually supplied to the International Office relating to territories where the Sanitary conventions apply, will as far as possible be communicated to the Office through the Ministry of Health or if the Marquess of Zetland prefers through the Government of India.

The Hague, April 12, 1933. With a view to the regulation of the sanitary control of aerial navigation, the undersigned, plenipotentiaries of the High Contracting Parties, furnished with full powers found in good and due form, have agreed on the following articles:— Part I .—General Provisions. Article 1. For the purposes of this Convention the High Contracting Parties adopt the following definitions :— I. —The word aircraft includes any machine which can derive support in the atmosphere from the reactions of the air, and is intended for aerial navigation. The present Convention applies only to aircraft— (1) of which the place of departure and place of final landing are situated in different territories; (2) which, although the place of departure and place of final landing are situated on the same territory, make an inter mediate landing on a different territory; (3) which fly without landing over more than one territory; whether these territories are placed under the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate or authority of the same Power or of different Powers. II. —The words authorised aerodrome denote a customs or other aerodrome, specially designated as such by the competent authority of the State in which it is situated, on which aircraft may make their first landing on entering a territory, or from which they may depart on leaving a territory. HI.—The words sanitary aerodrome denote an authorised aero drome organised and equipped in accordance with the terms of Article 5 of the present Convention, and designated as such by any competent authority of the country. IV.—The word creic includes any person having duties on board in connexion with the flying or the safety of the flight of the aircraft or employed on board in any way in the service of the aircraft, the passengers or the cargo.V. —The words local area denote a well-defined area, such as a province, a government, a district, a department, a canton, an island, a commune, a town, a quarter of a town, a village, a port, an agglomeration, &amp;c., whatever may be the extent and population of such areas. Subject to the conditions laid down in Article 8 of the present Convention, an aerodrome may constitute a local area. VI. —The word observation means the isolation of persons in a suitable place. The word surveillance means that persons are not isolated, they may move about freely, but that they are notified to the sanitary authorities of the several places whither they are bound and are subjected to a medical examination with a view to establishing their state of health. VII. —The word day means an interval of 24 hours. Article 2. Whatever relates in the present Convention to aerodromes is to be understood as applying mutatis mutandis to places for the landing on water of hydroplanes and similar craft. Section I.— Aerodromes in general and their Staff. Article 8 . Each High Contracting Party undertakes to provide on his authorised aerodromes a sanitary organisation adapted to the current needs of prophylaxis, which as a minimum shall consist of definite arrangements to ensure the attendance of a medical practitioner, at such times as may be necessary, for the medical examinations contemplated by the present Convention. Article 4. It rests with each High Contracting Party, taking into account the risks of infectious disease to which his territory may be exposed, to decide whether or not to establish sanitary aerodromes and which authorised aerodromes shall be selected for this purpose. Article 5. The sanitary aerodrome shall at all times have at its disposal— (a) An organised medical service with one medical officer at least and one or more sanitary inspectors, it being understood that this staff will not necessarily be in permanent attendance at the aerodrome; (b) A place for medical inspection;/ 27 (c) Equipment for taking and despatching suspected material for examination in a laboratory, if such examination cannot be made on the spot; (d) Facilities, in the case of necessity for the isolation, transport and care of the sick, for the isolation of contacts separately from the sick and for carrying out any other prophylactic measure in suitable premises either within the aerodrome or in proximity to it; A) Apparatus necessary for carrying out disinfection, disinsec- tisation and deratisation if required, as well as any other measures laid down in the present Convention. The aerodrome shall be provided with a sufficient supply of wholesome drinking water, and with a proper and safe system for the disposal of excreta and refuse, and for the removal of waste water. The aerodrome shall, as far as possible, be protected from rats. Article 6. The medical officer of the sanitary aerodrome shall be an official of, or approved by, the competent sanitary authority. Article 7. Each High Contracting Party shall communicate, either to the Office International d’Hygiene publique or to the Internationa) Commission for Air Navigation (which will transmit to each other the information thus received) a list of his sanitary aerodromes, in order that it may be brought to the knowledge of the other High Contracting Parties. The communication shall include, in the case of each aerodrome, details as to its situation, its sanitary equipment and its sanitary staff. The notification to the Office International d’Hygiene publique provided for in the present Article, as well as in Articles 8, 87, 40, 58, 59 and 60 of the present Convention may, in the case of those High • Contracting Parties who have adhered to the Pan-American Sanitary Code, be made through the intermediary of the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau. Article 8. In order that a sanitary aerodrome may be designated as a local area for the purpose of notification of infectious diseases and for other purposes as provided by the present Convention it must be so organised that— (1) The entry and exit of any persons are under the supervision and control of the competent authority;v *28 (2) In the case of a disease specified in Article 18 of this Convention occurring in the surrounding territory, access to the aerodrome by any route other than the air is forbidden to persons suspected of being infected, and measures are applied to the satisfaction of the competent authority with a view to preventing persons who are resident in or passing through the aerodrome from being exposed to the risk of infection, either by contact with persons from outside or by any other means. ^ In order that an authorised aerodrome which is not a sanitary aerodrome may similarly be designated a local area, it is necessary in addition that it shall be so situated, topographically, as to be beyond all probable risk of infection from without. The High Contracting Parties shall notify to the Office Inter national d’Hygiene publique aerodromes which have been constituted local areas in accordance with the terms of the present Article and the Office International d’Hygiene publique will communicate the notification to the other High Contracting Parties and to the Inter national Commission for Air Navigation. Section II .—Aircraft Sanitary Documents. Article 9. The following entries shall be made in the journey log book, under the heading “Observations”:— (1) Any facts relevant to public health which have arisen on the aircraft in course of the voyage; (2) Any sanitary measures undergone by the aircraft before departure or at places of call, in application of the present Convention. (3) Information concerning the appearance in the country from which the aircraft is departing of any of the infectious diseases mentioned in Part III of the present Convention. This entry is made with a view to facilitating the medical examination which passengers arriving at aerodromes in another territory may be required to undergo. For this purpose the Government of any non-infected country in which one of the said diseases makes its appearance shall, in addition to other means by which it is already required to inform other countries of the outbreak of such diseases and of their nature, transmit the necessary information to the competent authorities of each of its authorised aerodromes. The latter shall enter the information in the journey log of any aircraft leaving the aerodrome duiing a period of fifteen days from the date on which the information was first received. Aircraft shall not be required to carry Bills of Health. The entries made in the journey log book in accordance with the terms29 of this Article shall be verified and certified free of charge by the competent authority of the aerodrome. Section III .—Merchandise and Mails. Article 10. In addition to the measures prescribed in Articles 25, 29, 33, 4 ^ 44 , 47 , 49 and 51 of the present (Convention, merchandise in aircraft may be subject to the laws of the country as regards measures to be applied to merchandise imported by whatever means of transport. Article 11. Letters and correspondence, printed matter, books, newspapers, business documents, postal packages and anything sent by post shall not be subject to any sanitary measure unless they contain articles coming within the terms of Article 33 of the present Convention. Part II .—Sanitary Regulations generally Applicable. Article 12. In the case of sanitary or authorised aerodromes, the medical officer attached to the aerodrome has the right, either before the departure or after the landing of aircraft, to proceed to inspect the sanitary condition of passengers and crew, whenever circumstances justify this measure. This visit should, however, be so arranged in relation to the other ordinary administrative and customs operations as to avoid any delay or interference with the continuation of the voyage. No fees shall be charged for this inspection. Reservation is made of the right of the Sanitary and Maritime Quarantine Board of Egypt to levy dues in accordance wdth its special powers. Article 13. The competent authority of any aerodrome may, on the advice of the medical officer attached to the aerodrome, prohibit the embarkation of persons with symptoms of infectious disease, except in the case of the transport of sick persons by aircraft specially allocated for the purpose. In the absence of a medical officer the competent authority of the aerodrome may defer the departure of such persons until the ad\ ice of a doctor has been obtained. Article 14. Aircraft in flight are forbidden to throw or to let fall matter capable of producing an outbreak of infectious disease.30 Article 15. If the commander of the aircraft wishes to disembark a sick person he shall, so far as he is able, notify the aerodrome of arrival in good time before landing. Article 16. If there is on board an aircraft a case of infectious disease J|y verified by the medical officer attached to the aerodrome, not being a disease specified in Part III of the present Convention, the usual measures in force in the country in which the aerodrome is situated shall be applied. The sick person may be landed and, if the competent sanitary authority considers it desirable, isolated in a suitable place; the other passengers and the crew shall have the right to continue the voyage after medical inspection, and, if necessary, the carrying out of the appropriate sanitary measures. Such of these sanitary measures as can be carried out at the aerodrome shall be so arranged in relation to the administrative and customs operations that the aircraft may be detained as short a time as possible. Article 17. • r ^ expressly provided for in the present Convention mrcraft shall be exempt from sanitary formalities at the aerodromes both of call and of final destination. Part III. Sanitary Regulations applicable in the case of certain Diseases. Article 18. •u j i. 111 e im? suoject ot the special measun prescribed by this Part of the Convention are plague, cholera, yello fever, typhus and smallpox. For the purposes of the present Convention the period of incuba- aS 6 ! ys in the £ Case of pla S ue ’ 5 da ^ s in the ^se of cholera, 6 days m the case of yellow fever, 12 days in the case of typhus, and 14 days in the case of smallpox. ail fwLH hief h ? alth aut i 10r u iti . e8 sha11 tran smit to the sanitary and ° f . t 1 heir [ e8 P ective countries all information contained m the epidemiological notifications and communications received from the Office International d’Hygiene publique (and the Regional Bureaux with which it has made agreements for this(zst) 31 purpose) in execution of the provisions of the International Sanitary Convention of the 21st June, 1926,* which may affect the exercise of sanitary control in those aerodromes. Article 21. The measures prescribed in this Part of the Convention shall be regarded as constituting a maximum within the limits of which High Conflicting Parties may regulate the procedure which may be applied to ,^raft. It is for each High Contracting Party to determine whether measures should be applied, within the limits of the present Conven tion, to arrivals from a foreign local area or aerodrome. In this respect information received and measures already applied shall, in accordance with Article 54 of the present Convention, be taken into the fullest possible account. Article 22. For the purpose of Part III of the present Convention a local area is considered to be infected when the conditions specified in the International Sanitary Convention of the 21st June, 1926, are applicable to it.t Chapter 1. —Measures applicable in the Case of Plague, Cholera, Typhus and Smallpox. Section I. —Measures on Departure. Article 23. The measures to be applied on the departure of aircraft from a local area infected by one of the diseases mentioned in this Chapter are the following :— (1) Thorough cleansing of the aircraft, especially the parts liable to be contaminated. (2) Medical inspection of passengers and crew. (3) Exclusion of any person showing symptoms of one of the diseases in question; as well as of persons in such close relation with the sick as to render them liable to transmit the infection of these diseases. (4) Inspection of personal effects, which shall only be accepted if in a reasonable state of cleanliness. * Cmd. 3207. t According to the terms of the International Sanitary Convention of the 21st June, 1926, Article 10, and the first paragraph of Article 11, a local area is considered “infected” by one of the diseases in question, in the following circumstances: For plague and yellow fever when the first case recognised as non-imported is reported; for cholera when forming a foyer that is, when the occurrence of new cases outside the immediate surroundings of the first cases proves that the spread of the disease has not been confined to the place where it began; for typhus and smallpox when they appear in epidemic form.32 (5) In the case of plague, deratisation if there is any reason to suspect the presence of rats on board. (6) In the case of typhus, disinsectisation, limited to persons who, after medical inspection, are considered as likely to convey infection, and to their effects. The aircraft’s papers shall be annotated in accordance with the requirements of Article 9. Section II .—Measures on Arrival. Article 24. Aircraft, even when coming from a local area infected by one of the diseases to which this Chapter applies, may land at any authorised aerodrome. Nevertheless, each High Contracting Party, if epidemiological conditions demand such action, has the right to require aircraft coming from particular local areas to land at prescribed sanitary or authorised aerodromes, account being taken of the geographical position of those aerodromes and of the routes followed by the aircraft, in such a manner as not to hamper aerial navigation. The only measures which, if necessary, may be taken at authorised aerodromes which are not also sanitary aerodromes, are the medical inspection of crew and passengers and the landing and isolation of the sick. Passengers and crew r may not move beyond the limits prescribed by the aerodrome authority except with the permis sion of the visiting medical officer. This restriction may continue to be imposed on the aircraft at each landing place until it arrives at a sanitary aerodrome, where it will be subject to the measures laid down in this Chapter. Article 25. The commander of the aircraft is required, on landing, to place himself at the disposal of the sanitary authority, to answer all requests for information affecting public health which are made to him by the competent service, and to produce the aircraft’s papers for examination. Should an aircraft, on entering a territory, land elsewhere than on a sanitary or authorised aerodrome, the commander of the aircraft shall, if the aircraft comes from an infected local area or is itself infected, notify the nearest local authority to this effect, and the latter shall take such measures as are appropriate to the circumstances, being guided by the general principles on which the present Convention is based, and shall, if possible, direct the aircraft to a sanitary aerodrome. No cargo shall be unloaded and no passenger or member of the crew shall leave the vicinity of the aircraft without the permission of the competent sanitary authority.Article 26. In the application of the present Convention, surveillance may not be replaced by observation except— (a) in circumstances in which it would not be practicable to carry out surveillance with sufficient thoroughness; or (b) if the risk of the introduction of infection into the country is dfc considered to be exceptionally serious; or if the person who would be subject to surveillance cannot furnish adequate sanitary guarantees. Persons under observation or surveillance shall submit themselves to any examination which the competent sanitary authority may consider necessary. (A)— Plague. Article 27. If there has not been a case of plague on board, the only measures which may be prescribed are— (1) Medical inspection of passengers and crew; (2) Deratisation and disinsectisation, if in exceptional cases these operations are considered necessary, and if they have not been carried out at the aerodrome of departure ; (8) The crew and passengers may be subjected to surveillance for a period not exceeding six days from the date on which the aircraft left the infected local area. Article 28. If there is on board a recognised or suspected case of plague, the following measures are applicable :— (1) Medical inspection; (2) The sick shall be immediately disembarked and isolated; (8) All persons who have been in contact with the sick, and those whom the sanitary authority has reason to consider suspect, shall be subject to surveillance for a period not exceeding six days from the date of arrival of the aircraft; (4) Personal effects, linen and any other articles which in the opinion of the sanitary authority are infected, shall be disinsectised and, if necessary, disinfected; (5) Any parts of the aircraft which are suspected of being infected shall be disinsectised; (6) The sanitary authority may carry out deratisation in excep tional cases, if there is any reason to suspect the presence of rats on board and if the operation was not carried out on departure.34 Article 29. If the sanitary authority considers that merchandise coming from an area infected with plague may harbour rats or fleas, such merchandise shall not be discharged except with the necessary precautions. (B)— Cholera. Article 80. If there has not been a case of cholera on board, the only measures which may be prescribed are— (1) Medical inspection of passengers and crew; (2) Surveillance of passengers and crew for a period not exceeding five days from the date on which the aircraft left the infected local area. Article 31. If a case of disease presenting clinical signs of cholera appears on board during the voyage, the aircraft shall be subject, at places of call or on arrival, to the following procedure :— (1) Medical inspection; (2) The sick shall be immediately disembarked and isolated; (3) I he crew and passengers shall be kept under surveillance for a period not exceeding five days from the date of arrival of the aircraft; (4) Personal effects, linen and all other articles which in the opinion of the sanitary authority are infected, shall be disinfected; (5) The parts of the aircraft which have been occupied by the sick or which are regarded as liable to have been' infected, shall be disinfected; (6) When the drinking water on board is considered suspect, it s all be disinfected, and if practicable emptied out and replaced, after the disinfection of the container, by whole some water. In countries in which investigation for the detection of carriers of the cholera vibrio is prescribed for the inhabitants, persons arriving by aircraft who wish to remain in the country shall submit to the obligations imposed on the inhabitants. Article 32. Persons producing proof that they have been vaccinated against cholera within less than six months and more than six days, may be subjected to surveillance only. Proof shall consist of a written certificate signed bv a doctor whose signature shall be officially authenticated; failing such35 authentication, the certificate shall be countersigned by either (a) the medical officer attached to a sanitary aerodrome or (b) a person, other than the person performing the vaccination, who is authorised to witness an application for a passport under the regulations of the country.

Apart from cases where these signs are present, proof shall be afforded by a written certificate of a doctor, authenticated in the manner prescribed in the second paragraph of Article 82. Chapter II. —Measures applicable in the case of Yellow Fever. Section I.— General Provisions. Article 36. In territories where endemicity of yellow fever is suspected, the High Contracting Parties shall take the necessary steps to ascertain whether yellow fever exists in their territory in a form which, though not clinically recognisable, might be revealed by biological examination. Article 37. Independently of the notification of cases of and circumstances relating to recognised cases of yellow fever as laid down in Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 of the International Sanitary Convention of the 21st June, 1926, each High Contracting Party undertakes to notify immediately to the other High Contracting Parties and at the same time to the Office International d’Hygiene publique (either directly or indirectly through the Regional Bureaux with which it has made agreements for this purpose), the discovery in his territory of the actual existence of yellow fever in the above-mentioned form. Section II.— Provisions concerning regions in which Yellow Fever has occurred or exists in an endemic form. Article 38. Notwithstanding Article 4 of the present Convention, and subject to the terms of Article 46 hereafter, every aerodrome which receives aircraft to which Article 1, I, second paragraph, applies, and which37 is situated in a region, that is to say a part of a territory, in which yellow fever exists in a form clinically or biologically recognisable, shall become a sanitary aerodrome as defined in the present Convention, and in addition, shall be— (1) Situated at an adequate distance from the nearest inhabited centre. (2) Provided with arrangements for a water supply completely ^ protected against mosquitoes and kept as free as possible W from mosquitoes by systematic measures for the suppres sion of breeding places and the destruction of the insects in all stages of development. (3) Provided with mosquito-proof dwellings for the crews of aircraft and for the staff of the aerodrome. (4) Provided with a mosquito-proof dwelling in which passengers can be accommodated or hospitalised when it is necessary to apply the measures specified in Articles 42 and 44 below. Article 39. If, in the region where yellow fever has occurred or exists in an endemic form, there is not already an aerodrome fulfilling the conditions specified in the preceding Article, all aerial navigation from this region to any other territory shall be suspended until such an aerodrome shall have been established. Article 40. Every aerodrome established and equipped in accordance with the provisions of Article 38 above shall be called an mti-amary! aerodrome, and shall be deemed to be a separate local area. The creation of such an aerodrome shall be notified by the High Contracting Party in whose territory it is situated to the other High Contracting Parties, and either to the Office International d Hygiene publique or to the International Commission for Aerial Navigation, under the conditions laid down in Article 7. Consequent on this notification, the declaration of the presence of yellow fever in an adjacent town or village, or in another local area shall not apply to the aerodrome, and the aerodrome shall not be declared infected unless yellow fever occurs among the persons residing therein. Article 41. If an anti-amaryl aerodrome becomes an infected local area, aerial navigation from that aerodrome to any other territory shall be discontinued until all measures have been taken to free it from infection, and all risk of the spread of yellow fever has ceased. Article 42. Where the anti-amaryl aerodrome is not infected, but yellow fever exists in the region, the following measures shall be takenon the departure, or in any event as late as possible before the departure, of an aircraft:— (1) Inspection of the aircraft and cargo to ensure that they do not contain mosquitoes, and, if necessary, disinsectisation. A record of this inspection and any action taken shall be entered in the journey log-book. (2) Medical inspection of passengers and crew; those who are suspected of suffering from yellow fever, or in whose^se it has been duly established that they have been exposed to the infection of yellow fever, shall be required to remain under observation either within the precincts of the aerodrome or elsewhere, under conditions approved by the sanitary authority, until six days have elapsed since the last day on which they were exposed to infection. (3) The names of the passengers and crew shall be entered in the journey log-book, together with the relevant informa tion with regard to their exposure to infection, and the period and conditions of the observation which they have undergone prior to departure. Article 43. Aircraft in transit, not coming from a region in which yellow fever exists, and landing for the purpose of taking in supplies in an anti-amaryl aerodrome, shall be exempt from the prescribed sanitary measures on leaving that aerodrome. In the further course of the voyage they shall not be subject to the provisions of this Chapter provided that the fact that they have called at an anti-amaryl aero drome for the sole purpose of taking in supplies is entered in the journey log-book. Article 44. Aircraft to which Article 1, I, second paragraph, of the present Convention applies, flying between two regions where yellow fever exists must depart from and land at an anti-amaryl aerodrome in these regions. Passengers, crew and cargo shall not be disembarked or embarked except at an anti-amaryl aerodrome. During the voyage between these aerodromes aircraft may land for the purpose of taking in supplies in any aerodrome not situated within a region where yellow fever exists. The measures to be taken on arrival at the anti-amaryl aerodrome are the following:— (1) Inspection of the aircraft and cargo to ensure that they do not contain mosquitoes, and, if necessary, disinsectisation. (2) Medical examination of passengers and crew to ascertain that they are free from symptoms of yellow fever. If a person is suspected to be suffering from yellow fever, or if it has not been established to the satisfaction of the sanitary authority89 of the aerodrome of arrival that a person has completed a period of six days since possible exposure to infection, he may be subjected to observation either within the precincts of the aerodrome or elsewhere, under conditions approved by the sanitary authority, for a period ^not exceeding six days reckoned from the last day on w r hich that person could have been infected. Article 45. ■^Aircraft having departed from an anti-amaryl aerodrome in a region where yellow fever exists and arriving at a region where yellow fever does not exist, shall be subject to the provisions of Sections III and IV below. Article 46. For the purposes of local aerial navigation, nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the Governments of neighbouring terri tories in which yellow fever is found or exists endemically from establishing or employing, by mutual agreement, aerodromes which are not anti-amaryl aerodromes, for the needs of aerial navigation exclusively between these territories. Section III.— Provisions in respect of Territories or Regions in which Yellow Fever does not exist, hut in which there may be conditions which permit of its development. Article 47. In territories or regions where yellow fever does not exist, but where there may be conditions which permit of its development, the measures which may be taken on the arrival of an aircraft at a sanitary aerodrome are the following:— (1) Inspection of aircraft and cargo to ensure that they do not contain mosquitoes, and, if necessary, disinsectisation. (2) Medical examination of passengers and crew to ascertain that they are free from symptoms of yellow fever. If a person is suspected to be suffering from yellow fever, or if it has not been established to the satisfaction of the sanitary authority of the aerodrome that a person has completed a period of six days since possible exposure to infection, he may be subjected to observation either within the precincts of the aerodrome or else where, under conditions approved by the sanitary authority, for a period not exceeding six days reckoned from the last day on which that person could have been infected. Article 48. The High Contracting Parties undertake, save in exceptional circumstances which will require to be justified, not to invokesanitary reasons for prohibiting the landing in the territories referred to in Article 47 of aircraft coming from regions where yellow fever exists, provided that the provisions of Section II of this Chapter, particularly those concerning the measures to be taken on departure, are observed there. Article 49. Nevertheless, the High Contracting Parties may designate particular sanitary aerodromes as those at which aircraft from te«p- tories where yellow fever exists shall land for the purpose^)! disembarking passengers, crew or cargo. Section IV. —Provisions in respect of Territories or regions where the conditions do not permit of the development of Yellow Fever. Article 50. In territories or regions where the conditions do not permit of the development of yellow fever, aircraft coming from regions where yellow fever exists may land on any sanitary or authorised aerodrome. Article 51. The measures to be taken on arrival are the following:— (1) Inspection of the aircraft and cargo to ensure that they do not contain mosquitoes, and, if necessary, disinsectisation. (2) Medical inspection of passengers and crew. Chapter III.— General Provisions. Article 52. Persons who arrive in aircraft in the territory of any High Contracting Party and who have been exposed to risk of infection by one of the diseases referred to in Article 18 of the present Convention, and who are within the period of incubation, may, subject to the provisions of Chapter II of this Part, be subjected to surveillance until the termination of that period. In the case of cholera and smallpox, the provisions of Articles 82 and 85 relating to immunised persons apply equally to action under this Article. Article 53. Persons who, on arrival at an aerodrome, are considered under the terms of this Part liable to surveillance up to the expiration of the period of incubation of the disease, may nevertheless continue the voyage on condition that the fact is notified to the authorities of subsequent landing places and of the place of arrival, either by means of an entry in the journey log-book as prescribed in Article 9of the presenl Convention, or by some other method sufficient to secure that they can be subjected to medical inspection in any subsequent aerodrome on the route. Persons who are liable to observation under the terms of Articles 26, 44 (fourth paragraph) and 47 (second paragraph) of this Convention, shall not be authorised until the expiration of the period of incubation to continue their voyage, except—in the case of diseases other than yellow fever—with the approval of the sanitary authorities of fte place of their destination. Article 54. In applying sanitary measures to an aircraft coming from an infected local area, the sanitary authority of every aerodrome shall, to the greatest possible extent, take into account all measures which have already been applied to the aircraft in another sanitary aerodrome abroad or in the same country, and which are duly noted in the journey log-book referred to in Article 9 of the present Convention. Aircraft coming from an infected local area which have already been subjected to satisfactory sanitary measures shall not be subjected to these measures a second time on arrival at another aerodrome, whether the latter belongs to the same country or not, provided no subsequent incident has occurred which calls for the application of the sanitary measures in question, and that the aircraft has not called at an infected aerodrome except to take in fuel. Article 55. The aerodrome authority applying sanitary measures shall, whenever requested, furnish free of charge to the commander of the aircraft, or any other interested person, a certificate specifying the nature of the measures, the methods employed, the parts of the aircraft treated, and the reason why the measures have been applied. The authority shall also issue, on demand and without charge, to passengers arriving by an aircraft in which a case of one of the infectious diseases referred to in Article 18 has occurred, a certificate showing the date of their arrival and the measures to which they and their luggage have been subjected. Article 56. Save as expressly provided in the present Convention, aircraft shall not be detained for sanitary reasons. If an aircraft has been occupied by a person suffering from plague, cholera, yellow fever, typhus or smallpox, its detention shall be limited to the period strictly necessary for it to undergo the prophylactic measures applicable to the aircraft in the case of each disease referred to in the present Convention.k Article 57. Subject to the provisions of Chapter II of the present Convention, and particularly those of Article 47, any aircraft which does not wish to submit to the measures prescribed by the aerodrome authority in virtue of the provisions of the present Convention, is at liberty to continue its voyage. It may not, however, land' in another aerodrome of the same country except for the purpose of taking in supplies. An aircraft shall be permitted to land goods on condition that it is isolated and that the goods are subjected, if necessary, to the measures laid down in Article 10 of the present Convention. Aircraft shall also be permitted to disembark passengers at their request, on condition that such passengers submit to the measures prescribed by the sanitary authority. Aircraft may also take in fuel, replacements, food and water while remaining in isolation. Part IV .—Final Provisions. Article 58. Any two or more High Contracting Parties have the right to conclude between themselves, on the basis of the principles of the present Convention, special agreements relating to particular points concerning aerial sanitary measures notably as regards the applica tion within their territories of Chapter II of Part III. These agreements, as well as those referred to in Article 46, shall be notified as soon as they come into force either to the Office International d’Hygiene publique or to the International Commission foi An Navigation, under the conditions laid down in Article 7. Article 59. The High Contracting Parties agree to seek the opinion of the Permanent Committee of the Office International d’Hygiene publique, before having recourse to any other procedure, should any disagree ment .arise between them as to the interpretation of the present Convention. r Article 60. a P wi u ? ic ® t0 the provisions of the last paragraph of Article 42 the High Contracting Parties undertake to apply the same tariff of charges to the aircraft of other High Contracting Parties as they apply to their own national aircraft for sanitary operations in their aerodromes. This tariff shall be as moderate as possible, and shall be notified either to the Office International d’Hygiene publique or to the nternational Commission for Air Navigation under the conditions laid down in Article 7.

LONDON, S.W.1. /j' February, 1936. Dear Cxauson, With reference to our conversation this afternoon in regard to certain questions which have arisen regarding the application of the International Sanitary Convention and of quarantine restrictions in the Persian Gulf on the Arabian Coast, I am enclosing a copy of the letter from Dr. Morgan of the Ministry of Health on the subject, together with a copy of the documents which he forwarded to You thought that it would be desirable in the first instance to ask for the views of the Resident. Yours sincerely. M.J. Clauson, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.COPY. 1181 19 36 MINISTRY OP HEALTH, WHITEHALL, .S.W.l. 29th January, 1936, 'fit? Lear Burkett, We recently received from the Office International d 1 Hygiene publique a notification of an outbreak of smallpox at Sharjah in the Persian Gulf. I had occasion last week while in Paris to see Lr. Abt, the Director of the Office International d'Hygiene publique, and discussed the matter with him. The origin of the information received at the Paris Office was a letter, dated the 6th January, signed by Dr. Barrett Heggs on behalf of the Director-General of Health, Iraq. A copy of this letter is annexed. Prom it you will see that some 750 oases of smallpox are alleged to have occurred in six small towns in the area during the past few weeks. The information was first obtained from the Principal Medical Officer, Iraq Command, R.A.F., Baghdad, vtiio telephoned to Dr. Heggs on the 30th September reporting the outbreak of the disease. Dr. Heggs communicated at once with the Imperial Airways Company at Baghdad, and by arrangement with them the Principal Medical Officer, R.A.F., kindly sent a Medical Officer by airplane from Baghdad to Sharjah. Certain preventive measures were subsequently taken with the result that the Civil Health Administration, Baghdad, were able to wire to Karachi, Palestine and Alexandria to the effect that vaccination had been carried out and that it was considered that the only measures necessary were surveillance of air passengers and crews who had stopped at Sharjah. In another letter from Dr. Heggs to Dr. Abt, also dated the 6th January, a copy of which is annexed, you will note the remark that an epidemiological information service within the Gulf is badly needed and that this can only be arranged internationally. The outbreak of smallpox at Sharjah raises a number of questions in regard to the application of the International Sanitary Convention and of quarantine of air traffic generally in the Persian Gulf. I fear I was unable to give Dr. Abt any information on the matter, since I know nothing of the circumstances: what Government or Governments are responsible for sanitary administration a^-ong the southern shore of the Persian Gulf; are there any local administrative authorities, and what are the actual measures for medical supervision and quarantine of aircraft, their crews and passengers, in the aerodromes in the region ? Dr. Abt has prepared a note on the territorial status of areas in the Persian Gulf in which there are aerodromes of the Imperial Airways Company, but he is not sure whether the information he gives is accurate. The subject will in all probability be referred to at the next session of the Paris Office in May, particularly in regard to the authorities responsible for sanitary control in the aerodromes, the danger of infection of the aerodromes from without, especially by local inhabitants, and finally the possibility of establishing a service of epidemiological information for the area. Although I do not know the circum stances some doubt is raised in my mind as to whether the Iraq Health Services and the R.A.F. in Iraq have any mandate to occupy themselves with health conditions in the Persian Gulf. But /perhaps ,perhaps this is a local arrangement concluded between Iraq and Imperial Airways. • t * Yours sincerely. (Signed) W.T. Morgan. r ! tCOPY. MINISTRY OP INTERIOR Public Healti Directorate BAGHDAD IRAQ,. 6th January, 193 6. The Office International d^Hygiene publique, 195 Boulevard Saint-Germain, PARIS. Sir » In reference to the report sent to you to-dey as to the smallpox outbreak at Sharjah area of the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf. I wish to draw your attention to the fact that epidemiological information from the Gulf is bad. On a previous occasion also in 1932 the only information of a severe outbreak of smallpox near Bahrein was a communication from the Royal Air Force of Iraq who had seen a large encampment while flying down the Gulf and had landed to discover a large collection of cases entirely unattended to and unknown. Smallpox is endemic in these areas but more important here is the question of cholera which may enter the Gulf from India and be equally unknown for a long time. An Epidemiological information service within the Gulf is badly needed. This can only be arranged internationally. In 1932 we approached all known medical officers and missionary doctors throughout the Gulf to endeavour to establish a mutual arrangement but nothing came of it. In view of the Air Service in addition to the Sea traffic the matter is worthy of serious consideration. , I wish to express my indebtedness to the kindness of the R.A.*'. who have assisted us in these matters in the past so readily. I am. Your obedient Servant, BARRETT HEGGS for DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH.Ministry of Interior Public Eeelth Pireotorate Baghdad 'Irak*. COPY.

The Aircraft Station has a rest house and is a refuelling station. Some 750 cases of Smallpox have occurred in the following six small towns in the. area during the past few weeks, namely Ras al Kaimah 30 cases, 40 deaths. Urn al Qawain 80 cases, 4 deaths, Heera 30 cases and 2 deaths, Ajman 15 cases.end 7 deaths, Sharjah 100 cases and 18 deaths, Dubai ,500 cases and 60 deaths. Our information was first obtained from the Principal Medipal Officer, Iraq Command, Baghdad who telephoned me on. 30th December that an outbreak of this disease was reported at Sharjah. I communicated at once with the imperial Airways Company at Baghdad and by arrangement with them the Principal Medical Officer^ R.A.F. kindly sent a medical officer by aeroplane from Baghdad to Sharjah. I notified the aerodromes at Basrah and Baghdad. The Imperial Airways Company on 3rd January report that all the Staff of the Aircraft Station and rest house at Sharjah including the native labour and the guards have been /vaccinated.vaccinated. • Nd cases have occurred in the Station itself. Vaccine was obtained from Karachi and 600 persons in Sharjah were vaccinated by the Aerodrome Staff and more vac3ine has been sent to continue the vaccination. The British political officer at Bahrein has sent a vaccinator from Bahrein to vaccinate the other villages. Sharjah is informed that log books of Aircraft must be endorsed that Sharjah Area is infected with Smallpox and that passengers and crews who stopped at Sharjah will be under Surveillance only.

LOCAL INTniRESTS . 10. On receipt of information from the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, on the 6th January of the outbreak of Smallpox on the frucial Coast, quarantine restrictions were imposed on all vessels arriving from the ports infected and on travellers coming from those places by overland routes. The public was duly informed and notices posted in Muscat and Matrah to the effect that nobody would be allowed to board steamers or sailing vessels ai^riving from the infected places unless they could produce proof of having been successfully vaccinated a fortnight before. Vaccinations are being carried out in the Age Hospital and a good number of people have so far been treated.M.096/^5 21st Febru^iry, 1935 My dear Rendel, lam enclosing herewith an extract from LUPIN'S Report of Proceedings for the period 1st. to 15th October, 1934 (the main part of the letter has, of coarse, already been sent to you officially). You will see tuat when UJP1U was at Abadan on the 6th October there was some slight misunuerstanding about the quarantine flag. In view of the 1 ersian attitude in the Shatt, we felt that a matter such as this might easily lead to diplomatic action, and we nave therefore thought it desirable to look fairly closely into it. believe also of other navies&gt; not to aispia w the —, quarantine flag (meaning 'My ship is healthy and 1 request free pratique') in H.M.Ships on approaching a port. The exact origin of this custom is not known, but possibly it arose because it is equally the custom of local authorities to board a man-of-war immediately on arrival whatever the circumstances. Also it would obviously be inconvenient if in the event of ships arriving in company they were all to fly the quarantine flag, as i‘ cannot be expected ships, and the custom is in fact for the Senior officer's ship only to be boardeo. It is the 'custom of tt.e service' (ana we that the Medical Officer of “ealth would board all G.W.Renael Esq., C., .G., UUvX LjOUw • FOREIGN OFFICE, S. W. iIt is also customary in those days to report byf*/T in advance that the bill of health is clean or otherwise and the visit of the Medical Officer of wealth is therefore usually merely to confirm this anu give pratlQue. It might well be that if this matter were explained to the Persian authorities they would wish to conform to the 'custom of the sea'. On the other hand we realise that Article 911, King’s Hegulations and Admiralty Instructions, states that in foreign ports H.to.Ships are to comply strictly witn all local regulations relative to quarantine, ana so far as can be judged from here it would seem ttiat there is no insuperable objection to flying the appropriate quanantine flag if tne Persians insist. There may, howeveri* be special reasons in the Gulf to the contrary. Subject to any comments you may have to offer, we suggest that Knatchbull-Hugesson and the Senior naval officer, iersian Gulf, shoulo both be informed in the sense of tne foregoing, so that if the question arises again both may be ready to explain the usual custom to the Persians or to meet their demands if they are insistent. I am sending a copy of this letter to ■ jaithwaite. fours sincerely, £, A.

After securing at ho. 5 Jetty a uiessage was received tnat the quarantine flag should be hoisted. At the time the Commanding officer was with thei narbour “-aster who said that some of the snips of the lersian Gulf Division used this flag at Abadan and the (uarantine -edical officer would probably be late if the flag was not hoisted, orders however, were given that the flag was not to be hoisted and the quarantine medical Officer arrived shortly afterwards ano was inter iewed by the Commanding 'fficer, the “eaical Officer of Lib IN being sick ashore. 9. The Quarantine Medical Office at once brougnt up this iwatter of the flag and it was at first thought that he hao heard LUPIN had had smallpox and that there was no “-edical Officer on board, this however was not the case. The matter was the subject of a lengthy discussion in welch the Commanuing fficer pointed out that it was not usually customary for any warship visiting foreign ports to fly this flag unless there was some special reason for this to be done, furthermore when LUPIN visited Abadan in July and the Commanding officer attenoed ty the British Consul called on the Governor the flag had not been used; consequently it could have been a very suitable occasion on wnisti to raise the matter. The quarantine Medical Officer stated that it was laid down in the - ersian orders that the flag was to be displayed and he was unaware LUPIN had not flown it on her last visit. 10. The quarantine Medical Officer then enquired whether this matter had been settled, i.e. whether LUPIN would hoist tue flag on the next occasion of visiting Abadan. The Commanding officer was able to evade an answer as the question of Lib IN visiting Abadan in the future might never arise. 11. The Quarantine -edical officer then left the ship quite forgetting to give pratique, but this was obtained from him as he went over the brow. 12. The Commanding officer, H.f.S.BIDEFORD, has been informed of this incident, which was not oiscussed officially with the -nglo t rsian Oil Company or the Vice Consul at fcohammerah who was away on leave.mmPrinted in England.
