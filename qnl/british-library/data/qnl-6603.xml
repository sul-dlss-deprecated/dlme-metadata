With reference to previous correspondence on the subject of the protection of the oil-lields and pipe-line in Arabistan, i am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to request that you will inform the Secretary of State for India that they attach great importance, from a naval point of view, to prompt action being taken which will ensure that there shall be no interference with the oil supply. 2. They have studied the opinions of Sir P. Cox and the Military Staff Officers, contained in the enclosure to Indian Foreign Secretary’s letter 33 M. of the 14th August. They concur generally in Sir Percy Cox’s Minute of the 18th June, and think that t he conclusions drawn by the General Staff in India are based upon presumptions which are hardly justified in present circum stances. Tlie most probable contingency appears to be that the Bakhtiaris will remain loyal to their engagements to His Majesty’s Government, and that, even should German influence succeed in stirring up the country against us, they will not go so far as to damage their own interests. In that case, a comparatively small force will suffice to keep lawless hands from damaging the pipe-line, and in consequence the serious measures suggested by the General Staff as being necessary if any intervention is undertaken will not be required. 3. For these reasons my Lords would strongly deprecate the removal of troops from Akwaz for the present. 4 . The question of water supply will be dealt with in a separate com munication.

(Similar letters addressed to the War Office and Foreign Office.) nne.K : —Report of Departmental Committee on the Defence oj the Persian Oil-fields, Ac. ]. An inter-departmental Committee representing the Admiralty, War Office, Foreign Office, and India Office, met at the India Office on the 3rd October 1915, to consider the question of the defence, in various eventualities,of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's oil-iiehls and pipe-line in South-Western Persia. The Committee was constituted as follows : General Sir E. Barrow, G.C.B. (India Ottice). Vice-Admiral Sir E. Slade, K.C.I.E., K.C.\ .(&gt;. (Admiralty). Col. the Hon. M. G. Talbot (W ar Office). Mr. L. Oliphant (Foreign Office). Mr. J. E. Shuckburgh (India Office). 2. The general ])osit.ion with regard to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company s concession in Persia may be brielly stated. The Company was formed in 1909 to work a concession obtained from the Persian Government in 1901 by Mr. W. K. D’Arcy. which runs for 00 years from the 28th May 1901, and gives the exclusive right to drill for, produce, pipe,^ and carry awcy oil and petroleum products throughout the whole Persian Empire excluding the five Northern provinces (Azerbaijan, Ghdan, Mazanderan, Asteiabad, an(t Khoi- assan). The only oil-fields at present being worked by the Company under this concession are situated in the neighbourhood of Maidan-i-Naphtun in the Bakhtiari country,' whence the oil is conveyed in a pipe-line to the Company s refinery on Abadan Island at the head ol the Peisian Gulf. Aftei leaving the Bakhtiari hills the pipe-line runs through a tribal area subject to the influence of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Under agreement with the Company the Bakhtiari Khans have undertaken to police and protect the field works and upper section of the-pipe line, while the Sheikh of Mohammerah is under a similar obligation in regard to the refinery and the lower part of the line. 1 he Bakhtiari Khans are entitled, by agreement, to 3 per cent, of the shares in anv company formed to work oil in Bakhtiari country, and thus have a substantial interest in the success of the venture. In May 1914 an agreement was concluded between the Company and the Admiralty, by which the latter acquired a sufficient number of shares to give them a controlling interest in the Company’s operations. 3. Up to the end of 1914, the pipe-line was never interfered with; but m January and February of the present year considerable’damage was done by the Bawi, an Arab tribe then m revolt against the Sheikh of Mohammciah, to the section Ivmg between the Bakhtiari border and Ahwaz. 1 he damage has since been repaired, and the Bawi have made their submission to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and have formally accepted responsibility for the security of the pipe-line, telephone line and the ( ompany s employees, in letmn foi which a subsidy of l,000f. has been granted to the tribe. The Bakhtiaris have so far fulfilled their engagements; but in May 1915, when a rupture with the Persian Government seemed imminent, it was thought desirable to execute a further agreement with the Khans, by which they undertook, in the event of hostilities*’between Great Britain and Persia, and of their finding themselves no longer in a position to afford the necessary protection, to give the head of the oil-fields community 20 days’ notice in advance, and to be responsible for the safety of the Company’s employees during those 20 days. The agreement was dated the 24th May 1915. It may be mentioned that the population at the oil fields consists of some T000 souls, including 40 Europeans. 1 In the event of disturbances in Persia endangering the oil-fields, it is considered that half-measures would be useless, and that only two practicable courses are open to us, viz. ( 1 ) To despatch a military force sufficiently strong to defend the fields and pipe-line against all comers ; or (2) To shut down the fields and withdraw the personnel until such time as the Bakhtiaris are in a position to resume their engagements. The political objections to abandoning so important an interest, or, in Sir P. Cox’s words, “ leaving a large and valuable settlement, representing some millions of money, to be wrecked,” are sufficiently obvious ; and there is the further consideration that the Admiralty attach great importance to the continued supply of oil from the Persian fields for naval purposes. It has been argued that the Bakhtiaris, being financially interested in the enterprise, are unlikelv in any circumstances “to kill the goose which lays the golden* Letter Xo. 304 4- 0, dated 19th .June 1915, with enclosures. _ * Telegram No. 304/5 0, dated ‘JTth .June 1915 Letter No. 304/6/0, dated *27th dune 1945. with enclosures. e &lt;rcrs.' But, as against this view, it must be borne m imml that th(‘ tribe may be offered inducements by our enemies which will more than outweigh any losses incidental to the destruction of the oil-Iields. 5 'yhe Committee having considered the marginally-noted reports fiom the General Officer Commanding, Indian hx- peditionary Force “ D,’ and having heard the views of Vice-Admiral Sir Fdmoiul Slade, who is personally acquainted with local conditions in the districts concerned, resolved unanimously to submit the following conclusions for the consideration of His Majesty s Government: - (1 ) That the estimates—varying from one to two divisions -of the force requisite to defend our interests in the Anglo-Persian oil-fields, which have been submitted by the military authorities in Force “ 1&gt;,” are excessive in almost everv respect, as they do not tak.c sufficient a( count ol . ( rt ) The fact that the Chaab and Bawi tribes are unlikely to act against us after the recent lessons they have received, so long as-we maintain adequate forces for their repression, and so long as we are m alliance with the Sheikh of Mohaminerah ; (b) The fact that the Bakhtiaris are unable to concentrate against us m large numbers and have no guns, while the Persian Government have practically no armed force of any value; The fact that if we hold the portable water supply at the oil-fields no sustained attack on us can be made there. (2.) That for the above reasons, if Persia declared war, and if jehab^ were proclaimed, a brigade with a few mountain guns would suffice to hold the oil-fields and the water supply against any probable or possible attack, while a couple of battalions with a proportion of guns and cavalry could hold the Karan line up to and including Ilalila. . ( 3 .) This being so, the Committee consider that, provided that certain measures as proposed below are now taken, we can always rely on being able to detach a sufficient force for this duty so long as we maintain m the Basra- Ahwaz region a force of not less than two brigades of infantry, two regiments of cavalry, and two batteries ol Horse and Mountain Aitilleiy. G. On these premisses the Committee make the following recommendations. W Measures to be taken at once. 1 . The Karun to he recognised as the line of communications up to Halila, and for the purpose two steamers and barges to be placed on the river above Ahwaz. . . . . IT. The post now at Ahwaz to be transferred to Nasm on the left bank. III. A cart road to be made from Halila via Ab-Ganji to the foot of the Anjirak Kota! (S miles). . , A f IV. A water pipe to be laid from the Karun at lialda to the foot ot the Anjirak and a Burj with pumping power inside to be erected at or near this ^ V. A good mule road to he made up the Anjirak and thence along the oil pipe-line to the Ab-i-1 enibi. 1 he distance is about 1-- uules. Of these measures, III., IV. and \. should be carried out by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. I. and 11. are essentially matters for military action and expenditure. Measures to be taken when war threatens. VI a f orc .e to be despatched without delay to the oil-lields. This force to comprise :— A brigade of Infantry. One or two sections of Mountain Artillery. A company of Sappers and Miners.This force might have to detach a battalion to hold the water supply at Maidan-i-Naplitak. It would also have to furnish a detachment for Ab-Ganji and provide all escorts and picquets from Ab-Ganji to the oil-fields (lo miles). VII. The cart road from Darra Khazina via AI&gt;Gah to Ah-i-Tembi to be abandoned as it runs through an indefensible defile. \lll. Fortified towers or posts to constructed at the Kotals for guards and picquets and a defensible post at Ab-Gauji for a double company. IX. Two battalions and a cavalry regiment to be detailed for guarding the line Ahwaz-Malila. A post to be formed for a quarter battalion and one squadron at Halila and a similar post at Bandi Kir or Mulla Thaneh. The rest to be concentrated at Nasin (vide II). 7. The whole of these proposals are subject to the condition laid down in paragraph 5 (3) that a certain force is always maintained in the Basra-Ahwaz region. 1 his condition would not apply if we were in possession of Bagdad, as in that case the maintenance of normal order in the Bakhtiari hills would appear to be assured.
