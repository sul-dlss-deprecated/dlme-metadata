Rules of procedure to be followed by officers of the Indian Political Service, when submitting application® for leave or when proceeding on, or returning from leave. All officers and Administrations corresponding direct with the External Affairs and Political Departments are addressed twice annually (usually in March and September) with a request to report whether they or any of the officers of the Indian Political Service serving under them contemplate applying for leave during the periods of 6 months commenc ing respectively on the following 1st July and 1st January. It is very desirable that all officers desiring leave should express their wishes in response to these enquiries and that applications for leave should never be made at short notice except in circumstances of real and unforeseen necessity. 2. When the half-yearly returns have been scrutinised and the post ings position considered, the local Administrations etc, will be informed of the extent to which applications can be favourably considered, and formal applications should then be submitted by the officers concerned, accompanied by a report from the Audit Officer as to the applicant's title to the leave applied for. 3. Every officer proceeding on leave must report to the Under Secre tary in the Political Department, a week in advance: (a.) the name of the ship in which he intends to embark or (b) if he travels by air, the date of departure by plane and the name of the air transport company by which he will be travelling, and (c) his address on leave. If there should be any change in his leave address he should notify it at once (a) if in England, a Dominion or Colony, to the High Commr. or other appropriate authority, and (b) if on leave in India, direct to the Under Secretary, Political Department. 4. Every effort will be made to ensure that an officer on leave out of India shall be informed through the High Commissioner for India of his posting on return from leave in good time before the date of embarka tion. Failing this, or in case of change of orders, intimation will be made direct by wireless message to the Ship on which he is travelling. 5. Every officer on leave out of India should, before his return, com municate direct to the Under Secretary, Political Department (and in the case of an officer proceeding to the N.-W.F.P. to the Chief Secretary to the Government of the N.-W.F.P.) the probable dates of his embarka tion for and arrival in India, the port at which he proposes to land and the steamer by which he will travel.

Revised Rules of Procedure to be followed by officers of the Indian Political Service, when submitting applications for leave or when proceeding on, or returning from leave. (Received with Letter l^o.F. 16( 47)-E/38, dated the 13th January, 1939, from the Government of India in the External Affairs Department.) 1 A,Rules of procedure to be followed by officers of the Indian Political Service, when submitting application^ for leave or when proceeding on, or returning from leave. All officers and Administrations corresponding direct with the External Affairs and Political Departments are addressed twice annually (usually in March and September) with a request to report whether they or any of the officers of the Indian Political Service serving under them contemplate applying for leave during the periods of 6 months commenc ing respectively on the following 1st July and 1st January. It is very desirable that all officers desiring leave should express their wishes in response to these enquiries and that applications for leave should never be made at short notice except in circumstances of real and unforeseen necessity. 2. When the half-yearly returns have been scrutinised and the post ings position considered, the local Administrations etc, will be informed of the extent to which applications can be favourably considered, and formal applications should then be submitted by the officers concerned, accompanied by a report from the Audit Officer as to the applicant's title to the leave applied for. 3. Every officer proceeding on leave must report to the Under Secre tary in the Political Department, a week in advance: (a.) the name of the ship in which he intends to embark or (6) if he travels by air, the date of departure by plane and the name of the air transport company by which he will be travelling, and (c) his address on leave. If there should be any change in his leave address he should notify it at once (a) if in England, a Dominion or Colony, to the High Commr. or other appropriate authority, and (b) if on leave in India, direct to the Under Secretary, Political Department. 4. Every effort will be made to ensure that an officer on leave out of India shall be informed through the High Commissioner for India of his posting on return from leave in good time before the date of embarka tion. Failing this, or in case of change of orders, intimation will be made direct by wireless message to the Ship on which he is travelling. 5. Every officer on leave out of India should, before his return, com municate direct to the Under Secretary, Political Department (and in the case of an officer proceeding to the N.-W.P.P. to the Chief Secretary to the Government of the N.-W.F.P.) the probable dates of his embarka tion for and arrival in India, the port at which he proposes to land and the steamer by which he will travel. This report should, if possible, reach the Under Secretary, Political Department at least one clear month before the probable date of his embarkation for India. [F. No. 16 (47)-E/38].
