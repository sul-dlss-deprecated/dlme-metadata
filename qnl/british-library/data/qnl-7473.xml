MILITARY REPORT ON THE BRITISH PROTECTORATE OF ADEN. tCHAPTER I. Geography. The British Protectorate of Aden coders a strip of territory stretching along the southern coast of Arabia from the neighbourhood of the Red Sea on the west to the confines of Oman on the east. Its maximum width inland from the coast is roughly about loo miles. For the greater part of its length the boundary is not precisely defined, a part of the western section of the border only having been delimited in a formal manner. Of the eastern portion of the Protectorate we know little, if anything, more than formerly; a very large tract remains unsurveyed and untraversed by Europeans. It follows that any report on the Protectorate as a whole must be necessarily very incomplete, and susceptible of great additions in the future. The territory, in the interior, forming the British Protectorate, is in the possession of nine principal tribes, recognised by the Porte as under British influence * It also includes their sub-tribes or dependencies. The nine tribes are— The ’Abdali. The ’Akrabi. The Fadli. The Haushabi. The Aulaki. The Yafa’i. The Subehi. The 'Amiri (Dala). The 'Alawi. In addition, relations exist with the following tribes along the coast of the east:— The Wahidi. The Shekh of 'Irka. The Shekh of Lower Haura. The Ka’iti (of Makalla and Shehr). The town of Kishn and the island of Sokotra (Mahri). * Lord Granville’s and Lord Derby’s despatches, 1873-74. [C57QMGIB] A—o s It is proposed to deal more particularly with the former, our relations with the latter practically affecting the coast-line only, and preventing the annexation of the ports by any foreign power. General. The coast of the Red Sea is bounded by a maritime range, which, at a distance of some 60 miles westwards of Aden, recedes from the sea, leaving a considerable plain, again narrowed down to the coast, by the Haushabi and Fadli hills. At a general distance of 30 to 40 miles north ot Aden begin the foot hills of a series of st eeply scarped mountain chains, ot igneous rt'ck, they strike approximately east and west, gradually increasing in height to the northward from altitudes of between 2,000 and 4,000 feet, till on the northern boundary of the British Protectorate, the lofty chain ot mountains is reach d, extending from the Turkish mountains o^ A 1 And (o,Ko6 feet) along the Mares range, to the high peaks of the Yafa 1 country. These ranges are cut through, from the north, by the rivers Tibanand Bana and by numerous well-defined Wadis, dry except in flood-time, and from the north-east, by the river Hassan. # The southern portion consists of sandy plain, in parts covered by sparse thorn-trees, in which the only cultivation is to be found in, and near, the beds of the rivers and wadis which intersect it, where the alluvial soil, particularly in the ’Abdali country, between the two branches of the Tiban, and the Fadli country, between the Bana and Hassan rivers, is verv productive. In the central portion, as in the Haushabi, southern »Amiri and Lower Yafa’i countries, consisting of an intricate mass of sharply peaked mountains, the river and wadi beds, widening at^ times into fertile little valleys, still remain the principal centres of habitation and cultivation, while further to the north, where many of the ranges are flat-topped, and elevated table lands occur, cultivation is carried on on the summits, and on the slopes by means of terraced fields. From the Fadli hills, eastwards, the maritime range continues near the shore, retreating again in the Aulaki country, although the vicinity of the coast is broken by smaller rocky hills. The mountain chains again in crease in height the further inland they extend, till, to their north, the great desert is reached, extending eastward between the 15th and 16th parallels of latitude to the Hadramaut. The country is by all accounts more sterile than that to the west, sandy tracts and plateaux covered with basaltic debris occupying the intervening spaces between the mountains, and fewer favourable sites for cultivation being found. The coast-line. A glance at the map will shew that the coast-line, extending from Shekh Said on the west, to Kishn on the east, is roughly between 600 and 700 miles in extent. There are, however, comparatively few places that need be considered in detail in a military report, and these would more properly come under the heading of harbours. From Shekh Said eastwards, to the mouth of the river Hassan, the coast is low and sandy, the hills standing back a minimum distance of about ten miles, except in the case of isolated mountain masses like Jabal Kharaz and the Aden peninsula itself. It is diversified by occasional rocky head-lands, and inlets or Khors, generally too shallow to admit of any but boats and small native craft,3 entering them. As a rule, steam vessels of average draught can approach to a distance of r to 4 a mile of the coast, and landing can be effected by boats, without difficulty at most points, in fair weather. Normally there is no regular surf on the coast between Aden and Shekh Said but. it may be expected at most of the low stretches of coast to the east. Landing can, however be carried out without much danger, the native boats being the best for the purpose. In the south-west monsoon, and Ov'casionally during the north-east monsoon, such operations would be extremely hazardous. The bank of broken ground lying between Ras ’Ara and Ras Kau is mentioned by the Red Sea Pilot, as the only really dangerous stretch for vessels approaching the Gulf of Aden coast. Between Shekh Said and Aden, the coast is entirely devoid of cultiva tion, the soil being either soft sand, or, very frequently, hard desert or “ khabt” sparseL- covered with mimosa thorn, and good going for either troops or transport. Ashore road runs from Mokha, past Shekh Said, to Aden, sometimes actually along the shore and never more than twm or three miles inland. It is only suitable for mounted troops, convoys, etc., on account of the long distances between the wells, of which the majority are brackish, and the ardu us nature of the march, caused by the climatic conditions and the stretches of heavy sand. From Aden eastwards, the country near the sea is low and sandy as far as Makatm, but cultivation and villages are found within a mile or two of the shore in the Fadli country, near the embouchures of the Selat Suhebia and the rivers Bana an i Hassan. Beyond Makatin, to the east, the generality of the coast is sandy, but much varied wuth low rocky points and more commanding head-lands, the majority being uninhabited, and cultivation only occurring in the neighbourhood of the various towns and villages. Land frontier. At every step w r hen dealing with the Aden Hinterland, we are met with the difficulty of defective knowledge and unsurveyed and untraversed country. In the case of the land frontier, however, the border of the most importance, both from a commerciTl and a strategical point of view, is the w'estern or the boundary between the British Protectorate and Turkish Yemen, w'hirh is also the best known. As the boundary line is shewn in detail on the map, it is unnecessary to particularise too closely, and it may be roughly described as a line following a general north-easterly direction, from a point, a little to the east of the Turkish fort of Turba (Shekh Said), till it strikes the Rubh al Khali desert, at a distance of roughly 300 miles in a straight line. Of this, the por- tion between Turba, and a point on the Bana river to the nqxtk of the Mares mountains, has been actually delimited by an Anglo-Turkish Commission, and the general understanding betw r een the tw r o Governments withregaid to the remainder, till the actual completion of delimitation is roughly that a line drawn north-east from Lakmat as Shub, a village in Amiri territory, defines the dividing line of the sphere of influence of the two powers. Of this frontier, the most important section is that comprised by the Amir of Dala’s, the Haushati, and a portion of the Subehi, territories. Through these districts pass the main trade routes from Turkish Yemen, and they are also the only routes which could be utilised by a force advancing4 into British territory from Turkish Yemen, or the converse. These main lines o&lt; advance may be brought under three heads, and it is proposed to consider shortly how the frontier as at present established affects each— (a) Through the Dala valley from northern Yemen (San'a, Yerim, etc.). (b) Through the Tiban valley fromTaiz and Mavia. (c) From the x\ T akil Hamra past Mafalis and down the Wadi Ma’din. With regard to {a), the boundary crosses the valley drained by the Selat Kataba, and bounded to the north and west by the high and precipi tous mountains of A 1 Aud, through which the main route to San’a passes. Any move from the British side of the border, either to the north or the west, would entail the ascent of high passes, both difficult and susceptible of efficient defence. The Turkish advance on the other hand, though across the undulating Dala valley, would encounter the chain of low hills stretching from near Jalila towards Jabal Harir, which present a line of positions which must be passed before reaching^the heads of the passes, the Nakil Khureba and the Nakil Rabad, leading down from Dala to the lower-lying country. Assuming that this were accomplished, their only route would be down a river-bed commanded by steep hilb on either side, or by side tracks, barely passable for transport, over most difficult mountainous country. With respect to ( 3 ), an advance from Mavia would encounter a line of low hills on the British side very close to the actual boundary, which effectually command the valley as it opens out at the south foot of the Mavia pass, and the open plateau of the Habil Arabi. These positions, it is true, would be within distant fire from heavy artillery from theJalisa-Am Amma (Turkish) range, but the difficulty of getting big guns into effective positions, if indeed possible at all, would be so great, that this scarcely comes within the scope of practical politics. In the first instance, it would involve the existence of such guns, which is extremely doubtful, and in the second, the making of roads practicable for them. On the other hand, any advance on Mavia would involve the pass age of the Mavia pass, a defile easily defensible by light artillery and muskeby. An advance on Mavia from the east, by the Wadis Tusan and Hilhal, would also encounter great natural difficulties. An advance from the Turkish side from Taiz would be most difficult against opposition. The actual western frontier of the 'Amri Haushabi follows generally the crest-line of a chain of hills completely commanding the extensive plain in Turkish territory to the west. This chain is passable for transport at four points, by the Wadis Akkan (or Natid), the YVarezan, the Selat Sudan, and by the Wadi Hakab. In each case the passage is in the nature of a defile to which access could be effectively barred by the high ground on the British side on the actual boundary. The 'Amri country itself also presents positions wffiich it would be difficult to pass, while still further back, the vicinity of the junction of the Akkan with the d iban, forms a position, the forcing of which may be regarded as practi cally impossible. It must also be remembered that by the Tiban route alone would water in sufficient quantity for a force, large enough to attempt such offensive measures, be found.5 • V 0r , a ' advanc f from . ’ Anlr ‘ territory in the direction of Taiz the ■ nit.al advantage of terra,n would lie on the side of the British. ' The Akkan-Nat'd route is, for some distance at any rate, commanded by the high Turkish hill- to the south (the Yusufi range), but an advance across the low-lying Bad,, country near the course of the Sudan and Warezan wcu'd appear poss.ble, 1 he country between the Padu and Taiz as far as can be seen from the hills of Humala and Tinsum, is broken by low hills and naural difficulties, favouring defence, would no doubt present them- selves. T he only thing that can be said in the absence of a survey of this tract, is that we know the country beyond the Turkish border near Taiz to be low-lying, comparatively lev. 1, well-watered and fertile and fron e tier y m ° re FaCt ' Cable at this P oint tlia ' are the other portions of the With regard to fc), the heights are entirely in possession of the Turks and the Nakil Hamra, though a good road possesses such facilities for defence, as to be practically impregnable. es ror On the other hand, the Wadi Ma'din, on the British side of the frontier, offers several positions dominating the surrounding low-Iving country and a long desert march, the few wells being either held o? rendeied useless, would effectually check any forward movement, evin if these positions were passed. even n The 'estern border, north-eastwards from Lakmat as Shub in its present undefined condition, need only be touched on very briefly i„ as far as it affects the military aspect of the frontier. T he main barrier to any Turkish encroachments to the east is the exceedingly difficult and high mountainous country of the Yafa, tribe a warlike and indepen lent race of great numerical strength The Turkish district of Rada lies on a lofty tablefand some 30 miles to the north-west of the line from l.akmat as Shub Any aggressive move of theirs towards the east would almost certainly mZt with opposition from the tribes in a very difficult country, nor is ther» anv route which would permit of an advance south-east, through Yafa or along the Bana, which in that part flows between high and precipitous hills f ,h’ ‘°, summanse situation as regards tl/AnJo-Turkish frontier, the high ranges and mountain passes are in the hands of the I urks, except in the Taiz-Haushabi portion, and should effectually bar'any advance from our side. But on the British side of the frontier strong positions occur on every route, which, although not so commanding arf perhaps tactically better fitted, and more easily adaptable, for defen?; It is possibly rather unnecessary to imagine so unlikely a situation as hostilities ,n Yemen, between Great Britain and Turkey invdvZ an advance from one side or the other, especially in a county in which places capable of supplying even a brigade, with sufficient water and food or forage are of rare occurrence, and in which marching by detach ments would be a necessity. At the same time, jt seems worth while to attempt to give a general idea of what the strategical aspect of the rontilr is, at the points where the main routes cross it. ntier With regard to the remainder of the frontier, it can only be dcs cnbed in very general terms as .t has neither been visited nor surveyed Briefly, the northern and eastern frontiers of the British are the tribal frontiers of the nine tribes. It is as vet ncer, 9 r 0ra , te country of Beda will be formally recognised as under British protectio,?6 * T but its ultimate inclusion appears probable. It may therefore be said that the British Protectorate is bounded on the north by the extensive and impassable desert tract known as the Rubh al Khali. The eastern frontier is also unexplored. It is known to consist of mountainous and desert country, little inhabited or cultivated, in which the principal routes run southwards towards the sea coast. Mountain systems. With the exception of the comparatively small stretches of sandy maritime plain to the south, the whole of the Aden Protectorate is moun tainous. Although doubtless forming part of a system of chains extending across southern Yemen from east to west of which some are stiU very clearly tiaceable, the connection between the different chains is now hard to follow, isolated masses in parts running north and south and forming a most intricate mass of rugged peaks It is only proposed to touch very generally on these, as a reference to the map will convey a far clearer idea than any written description. In the Subehi country, in the south west corner, the maritime lange bordering the Red Sea roughly follows the line of the coast at a distance of about ten miles inland, in several parallel lines. The mountains are very rugged and almost devoid of vegetation and as a rule, difficult of ascent. The principal peaks are, the curious point of Sin Samfa (Sin Ar. tooth) 2,821 ft., J. Wusid, called in the charts Barn Hill, 1,972 ft., and the almost isolated masses of J. am Missas 2,043 feet and J. Kharaz 2,754 feet, the, end of the maritime range abutting on the sea coast. Further inland, to the east, a succession of ranges border the numerous wadis draining south towards Turan, rising about 1 000 feet above the level of the river-beds, while to the north-west, on the boundary line of the Protectorate, a group of high mountains, of a general altitude of 4,000 to 6,oco feet occurs, of which the most noticeable peaks ate the isolatf d range of J. Hawab, J. Rasin in Turkish territory, and the long ridge of J. Jardad which forms the beginning of the system alluded to before, running roughly east and west across Southern Yemen. The mountains at this point form a water-shed, the wadis in British territory (with one or two exceptions) draining south, while those on the Turkish side, of which the W. am Ghail is the principal, drain west to the Red Sea. To the east of Jardad and J. am Ibdar, the Zureki hills, of which the principal peak is J Munif, 6,856 feet, cut through by the Wadis 'Ubil and Adim, carry on the scarp towards the long ridge of J. Iraf, which turning almost north, on the west bank of the Wadi Ma’din, connects this line with the highest range in Southern Yemen, that extending in an unbroken line from J. Sabar near Taiz to the Tiban, and which is the most fertile part of South Arabia. The mountain wall from Hawab east wards is roughly the north-west boundary of the British Protectorate, the foot-hills of the main ranges, and in a few cases, the exterior ridge only, being in Subehi territory. North of the high J. Sabar range, of which the extremities, east of the Kubati and Yusufi mountains, are in the possession of the Juheli Subehi and’Amri Haushabi respectively, is the ’Amri cou:tYy, consisting of broken low hills. To their north, another high range runs east and west, its western extremity curving to the south ; from J. Jalisa on the J-7 south-west to J. Jarban, and thence east to J. Amamma (7,300 feet) and J. Warwa (5,879 feet) ; the portion of this range, west of J. Basesa, is Turkish and east of it, Haushab', To the east of the Tiban, in Haushabi country, between it and the Wadial Milah, lies an iriegular mass of bare and rugged mountains between 3,000 and 4,000 feet high, while to their east again are the Danbari hills, the southernmost range of the Radfan system. Bordering the Tiban on the west, is a high mountain wall, pierced in places by wadis draining east to the Tiban, of which the main feature is the mass of J. Hasha (8,417 feet), the lower eastern spurs being in the territory of the Amir of Dala. 1 he Amiri country is entirely composed of mountains of an exces sively rugged and abrupt description. On the east is the continuous range formed by Jabal Harir (7,754 feet), a flat topped ridge running north to south, with exceedingly steep and precipitous sides falling away to the Bana, and J. Halmin, connected with Harir by a col, a rugged mountain, rising steeply on the west in sharp peaks and running eastwards in long ridges to the Bana. In the centre are the Shairi hills and the rugged pro montory jutting out from the head of the Dala valley, and culminating in the remarkable plateau of Ad Dubiyat, whence it falls away in a series of rockv foot-hills to the Suheb valley. The north-western part is occupied by the great mountain mass of J. Jihaf (7,840 feet), the summit of which contains fertile valleys and slopes, and which extends southwards in two great spurs, the easterly, culminating in the bluff of J. Mafari (6,490 feet), and the westerly, forming the Humedi mountains, with the abrupt pinnacles of J Misman (7,033 feet) and J. Seyan. On the north are sheer precipices of 2,000 feet. The south-western part is an intricate mass of rugged mountains, separated from the Jihaf system by the deep gorge of the Tabaghain, of which the most conspicuous peaks to the north are J. an Nad (7 131 feet) and J. Mashwara (6,355 feet), continuing down to the Haushabi mountains between the Tiban and the Wadi al Milah. The Radfan range, in the south-eastern corner, juts to the north in bold spurs, and falls away on the east to the Bana. The principal peak is J. al Huria (6 107 feet), and the range encloses fertile valleys. To the north of J. Harir in Amiri territory, are the Shaibi mountains, connected with Harir on the south, and with Mares on the west. They are excessively steep and rugged, but contain fertile valleys. J. Awabil (7,648 feet) is the principal peak. North of the Shaibi, across the Bana, is the high plateau of Rube'aten with J. Anitha, and J. Shamroh (7,881 feet), as its most conspicuous peaks. To the east of the Shaibi mountains, and separated from them by the Bana, are the lofty and rugged peaks of the Upper Yafa'i which present an inhospitable and serrated front to the south. The higher points, of which J. Al Ah is the principal, rise to above 8,000 feet, and enclose deep valleys which are said to be very fertile They have, as yet, not been visited by Europeans. To their south, separated from the Radfan mountains by the Bana, are the Lower Yafa'i hills, which rise at their highest point, in Jabal Maufaja, to 7,276 feet, and are composed of short ridges running east and west, well wooded, and with tne slopes culti vated by terraced fields. To their south again, separated from the Lower Yafa’i by the River Hassan, is the maritime range of the Fadli tribe, the peaks varying from some 2,000 feet to 5,600 feet (J. Ures).Eastwards of the Yafa’i and Fadli mountains lies an unsurveyed tract, concerning which there is very little information, though the naval charts shew a practically continuous range of high mountains running parallel to the coast. The main system in the Aulaki country is from the account of Mr. Bury, who traversed the country some 5 years back, the chain of the Kaur al Audilla which crosses the country between the Upper and Lower Aulaki, from east to west, and of which the estimated height of the highest peak is about 8,000 feet. Rivers. The only rivers are the Tiban and its tributaries—the Warezan and Sudan—, the Bana, and the Hassan. The Tiban, rising in Turkish Yemen between Jibla and Ibb, enters the British Protectorate in Amiri territory, in the low-lying country north-west of Jabal Jihaf. It then turns south and flows through a very deep and narrow precipitous gorge between J. Jihaf and J. Hasha. Fur ther to the south, in the Ahmadi and Haushabi countries, its valley is comparatively open, spaces of about i mile width occurring, with cultiva tion at intervals on the banks. Near the junction of the Warezan and the Wadi Akkan, the valley broadens to about a mile, narrowing again near Jol Madram, till at Nobat Dukem, it issues from the mountains, and flows across the plain in Abdali territory with strips of cultivation on either bank &gt; couple of miles below Zaida, the stream bifurcates forming a d e ita of rich and well cultivated alluvial soil. The easterly branch, the Wadi a s Saghair, reaches the coast some 3 miles to the north-east of Imad, and the westerly, the Wadi al Kabir, at ihe Hiswa on the northern shore of Aden harbour It is only after floods that the water ever reaches D ar b and Fiyush, but it may always be found in the bed of the torrent a f e w feet below the surface, and large quantities from the Hiswa (signifying an underground spring or channel) are, or at any rate were, b r ou ght daily into Aden for sale. its course through the mountains the Tiban flows about a foot deep and ten to fifteen yards wide in the dry season, with a current of about 3 miles per hour. Below Musemir, the bed is occasionally dry for a short distance, the water having been diverted to cultivation. The water is freely carried off by the Arabs by irrigation channels, from below the Fajra gorge between J. Hasha and J. Jihaf, throughout the re mainder of its course through the mountains. Like all mountain streams, the Tiban is subject to sudden floods in the rains, and a great mass of water comes down with little warning. As the bed is frequently used as a highway, great care must be observed at that season, especially in the narrow go ge above Hafasa. The water is as a rule clear, and apparently good for drinking purposes, but it has a bad reputation among the Arabs, and was certainly the cause of intestinal troubles among the escort of the Commission, on a march down the valley. T his is probably due to the soakage from the irrigated and manured fields on the banks. Its use for drinking purposes is of course often inevitable, but it should be avoided where possible. There are good springs of excellent drinking water, both at Musemir and at the mouth of the Wadi Tus’an, Care should be taken in allowing camels to graze, as a poisonous species of oleander grows in the bed between Musemir and Tus'an.9 1 he only perennial tributary of the Tiban is the IVnrezany which, tising at the foot of J. Sabar, enters Haushabi territory on the western 'Amri border, and flows in a south-easterly direction through the ‘Amri country till it joins the Tiban, a little below the small village of Habil Masweda. In the dry season, it flows about 4 f°ot deep and ten yards Wide, at the rate of about 3 miles per hour. For a short distance below where it enters ’Amri country, there is a little cultivation on the banks, and the bed is some 50 yards wide, but it soon enters a cutting in a stone- covered, barren plain, which continues till it joins the Tiban. Quicksands are reported near its junction with the W. Fakir. The Selat Sudan, rising near Nakil Maharras in Soban, traverses the Turkish district of Shurman under the name of the Selat Shurman, and joins the Warezan just after entering Harfshabi territory. Its volume of water is about the same as that of the Warezan. Neither the water of the Warezan nor that of the Sudan is considered by the Arabs good for drinking. It is a fact that their valleys are feverish, enlarged spleens among the natives being Very common. The river Bana rises far to the north-west among the hills to the north of Ibb. Sweeping round to the north of the Mares range, it enters the British Protectorate between the district of Rube’aten, and the Shaibi country, running east, to the south of Dabiani, till at its junction with the Selat Sih its course southwards begins. The Bana was crossed in September 1903 (the rainy season) by a British force, between Shaibi and Ru'ee’aten. The altitude of the river bed at this point is 4,200 feet, the slopes above the banks being very steep and precipitcus&gt; and the summits of the highest mountains rising to about 8,000 feet. The stream was 20 to 25 yards wide with a Current of 3 miles per hour and a depth of 2 feet to 2^ feet. The banks were about 3 feet above water-level with a varying width on either side of level ground up to a maximum of 50 yards, covered with rushes and undergrowth, and in places, a fair number of large trees. In the dry season the depth does not probably exceed feet, but after heavy and continuous rain, the stream becomes an impassable and rushing torrent, some ten feet in depth. On its course through the Upper Yafa’i and Halmin countries, the Bana flows between high mountains, and cultivation occurs in its valley Ln parts. Then, skirting the Radfan mountains, it enters the Habil Jabr plain. The valley here opens out, and the stream, making a bold curve eastwards and then southwards, emerges from the hills into the plain. Below the Habil jabr plain, the Bana again passes through the mountainous tract between the hills of the Dairi tribe (the Radfari system), and the mountains of the Lower Yafa’i till it emerges at the village of A 1 Masn’a, whence it flows southwards over the alluvial plain to the sea. The Abbian or low-lying tract between the rivers Hassan and Bana is well irrigated and cultivated, the matter of the water-rights forming a ground of standing feud between the Fadli and Lower Yafa’i tribes. It is only at times of flood, that the water reaches the sea. The quality of the water seems to be good for drinking. Mrs. Bent describes the Bana bed below Khanfar in the Lower Yafa’i country, as so thickly overhung with trees that their branches had to be lopped off to enable the party to pass, and also mentions the reported existence of quicksands in this neighbourhood. The Bana has no perennial tributaries of any importance. [C57QMGIBI BIO The river Hassan, of which the exact source is uncertain, enters FadJi territory from the north-east and traverses the valley of the Yeramis between the Fadli maritime range, and the mountains of the Lower Yafa’i. It receives the drainage east and south of A 1 Kara (the capital of the Lower YafaM country) and also a considerable share of the drainage of the country inhabited by the Markashi. Its principal tributaries, flowing from the Lower Yafa’i country, are the Wadis Silib, Sarrar, Thiba and Hatat. According to information received by Mr. Tate, who conducted a survey of a portion of the Lower Yafa’i country in 1893, the three first join the Hassan in the vicinity of the village of Na’ab, and are said to contain water throughout their course. He describes the valley of the Wadi Silib as fairly open, but that of the other streams draining the Lower Yafa’i as narrow trough-like valleys. The Wadi Hatat rises under the Nakil Maskaba pass, and joins the Hassan about 12 to 14 miles north-east of A 1 Husn. In the upper part of its course, water is frequently met with issuing from springs in the river bed ; trees, from which the stream takes its name, and of which the leaves are poisonous, line the banks. The Hassan according to Hunter, though broader than the Bana, is fordable at all times. Its waters do not reach the sea (5 miles north east of the embouchure of the Bana) more than a dozen times a year.11 CHAPTER It. Ethnography. The British Protectorate is inhabited by a number of tribes, each sub-divided into sub-tribes or clans, varying both in character, in their manner of living and in the nature of their political institutions. They may be said to present the same essentialcharacteristics, which have been modified to some extent by their origin, and still more so by the nature of the country they inhabit. The ruling trait in the Arab character is pride and an intense love of independence. This is noticeable throughout, though naturally less so, in the case of a tribe like the Abdali, in constant communication with Aden. To such an extent is it carried in the case of the wilder tribes like the Subehi or the Upper Yafa’i, that in the case of the former, scarcely a clan owns one acknowledged headman, and there are almost as many 'Akils or headmen as there are tribesmen, and in the case of the latter, who nominally own allegiance to one Sultan, the powerful tribal Shekhs are ready at a moment’s notice to disobey him if his views do not happen to fall in with theirs, and every tribesman is equally ready to differ from the views of his Shekh and to follow his own impulse. Curiously enough, therefore, this love of independence is a source of weakness rather than strength, as it is the chief factor in preventing tribes who might otherwise be formidable antagonists from combining. In fact this quality may be more properly called impatience of control, and would make any use of Arabs as soldiers, except under the most irregular and lax conditions, impossible. That they are both jealous and quarrelsome, the existence of blood- feuds among the various tribes gives ample proof, and treachery is often resorted to to attain their ends. They are ordinarily self-contained and quiet in demeanour, but it takes very little to rouse them to a state of wild excitement, when they appear as yelling and gesticulating maniacs, liable at any moment to explode or to let off their guns ; still, in the wildest moments, a leaven of sense seems to remain which, as a rule, prevents their going to extremities. Possibly by force of contrast, the quality which they seem to admire most and which certainly produces the best effect, is firmness, combined with infinite patience and a quiet demeanour. Anything in the shape of bluster or loss of self-control, either in the most important or most trivial transaction, seems to at once bring out the latent spirit of opposition. The Arab has quite enough shrewdness to know when severe measures have been deserved, but anything in the nature of arbitrary conduct or hot temper receives his unsparing condemnation. In dealing with a variety of tribes with such different characteristics it is difficult to generalise ; broadly they may be divided into settled and agricultural, and nomad, races, with the differences due to, and insepar able from, their mode of life. The settled Arab is exceedingly industrious ; the terraced fields on the mountain slopes, and the carefully constructed irrigation-channels, bear witness to a great capacity for steady and persev ering work. The women work hard, but the men do their share of the field work, the women’s task being mainly about the house and involving the carrying of water, which as the Arab invariably builds his tower on steep and rocky knolls is no light labour. Their habits are simple and their diet frugal. They are hospitable and, like all Muhammadan communities, charitable—— . 12 to the poor, and their love of children generally, is a very noticeable feature. It is a curious fact, that hated as is the Turkish rule throughout Yemen, Turkish deserters making for Aden, almost invariably arrive safely. They are, as a rule, quite destitute at starting, and depend entirely on the charity of the Arab tribes through whom they pass. The Arabs are fanatical-Muhammadans and much under the influence of their Sayids, but in ordinary intercourse with them, after the initial distrust has been overcome, their fanaticism is rarely apparent . and the chief men, not excluding the Sayids, are ordinarily courteous in their demeanour and pleasant to deal with. The quality which is perhaps most in evidence, and which is so repugnant to the average Englishman as to often overshadow their better qualities, is their excessive and ver&gt; apparent cupidity, which appears to be inherent in all classes. The religion of the great majority of the country is that of the Shaft sect of Sunni Mahomedans. The practice of the religion varies, of course, in the different districts. Among some of the nomad races, it is little more than a name, and more civilized Arabs say somewhat contemptuously of the wilder clans of the Subehi, “ They do not even know how to pray.’* Mosques are universal in the villages, and are well kept, and in even the wildest parts, shrines erected to the memory of some departed Say id, are common, and are frequently the resorts of pilgrimage. Among the mo r e settled population, education is carried on, on the usual Muhammadan lines, and it is the exception to find an Arab of such districts unable to read or write. They are indefatigable letter-writers, and the writing of begging letters is a branch of the epistolary art that claims much of their attention. Among the nomads, education is rather the excep tion than the rule. Physically the Arab is usually rather short, but wiry and capable of great endurance and exertion. In many districts there is a considerable admixture of negro blood, but the pure Arab possesses aquiline, sometimes rather Jewish features, with a light brown complexion, and bright and intelligent eyes. As the distribution of the different classes varies so much among the different tribes, it will perhaps be more convenient to give a brief account of each. Fuller details regarding the more important and better known tribes will be found in later chapters. The territory of the Amir of Dala. The Amiri tribes are a confederacy of small separate tribes owning allegiance in.very varying degree to the Amir of Dala. They may be grouped as follows :— 1. The Amiris own relatives, connections and dependents, who inhabit the tow T n of Dala and the districts-of Zubed, south of Dala, and Tafwa in the Hardaba valley. The people of Jabal Harir, who are “Raya’* or subjects of the Amir, the Sayid community of Haj Said, the inhabitants of Hazat al Abid, descendants of former slaves of the Amir, and the Ahl Rasesi, a hereditary clan of caravan guides and camel contractors, also come under this heading. They number all told about 6,000 souls and are under the immediate jurisdiction of the Amir. 2. The Ahl Jihaf and the Ahl Mafari.— Y\\e Ahl Jihaf arc a settled agricultural people inhabiting the central part of Jabal Jihaf. Theynumber about 2,000 men capable of bearing arms and are divided into some 30 clans. The Bani Said, numbering about 500 men under Sayid Muhammad Taha, perhaps the most influential man in Amiri territory, inhabit the south-western spur. The Ahl Mafari inhabit the spur of Jihaf whose continuation forms the Mafari district. They are quite independent of the Ahl Jihaf, although maintaining close relations with them. They number about 300 men capable of bearing arms. 3. The Azraki and Mehrabi .—Of the valleys and hills south-west of Dala are closely connected by origin and inter-marriage. Some live in settled villages in the Azraki valley, but the majority are nomadic, and inhabit the hiH-country near J. Mashwara. They are immediately subject to, and in close relations with, the Amir to whom they pay a quarter of the produce of the lands they own in proximity to Dala. They number about 600 and 300 fighting men respectively. 4. The llumedi and the Ahmadi .— The former inhabit the south western spur from J. Jihaf, and the latter, the valleys of the Tiban and Tabaghain, and the neighbouring hills and are for the most part settled agriculturists. They number about 600 fighting men each. They acknowledge the Amir’s authority, and pay a regular tribute, but as far as jurisdiction is concerned, are more immediately und^r their own chiefs. 5. The Dakkam —Inhabit the valley, ncrth-west of J. Jihaf, and number some 300 fighting men. They migrated from the Haushabi country some generations ago, and were independent until invaded by the Amir Shafal about 40 vears since. They bring annual presents, in token of subjection, and, according to the Amir’s statement, have agreed to pay a regular tribute henceforward. 6. The Shairt —Inhabiting Jalila and other villages in the Dala valley, the broken hills to the east of it, and the A 1 Hadar district, south of the Khureba defile, though a separate tribe, are closely associated with the Amir, and are to a limited extent under his jurisdiction. They pay no regular tribute but are bound to assist him in time of war. They number about 50c fighting men. 7. The Halmin —Inhabit the valleys draining to the Bana and the low hills between the Selat Dabab and the Selat Hardaba, and number about 500 men. They are adherents of the Amir and he places great reliance on them in time of war. They pay no tribute. 8. The Al Afud —Is a comprehensive name for all the tribes inhabiting the northern slopes of the Radfan mountains, and the low-lying country between them and the Halmin. They consist of six tribes — The Ahl Abdalla, The Hajeli, The Bakri, The Dairi, The Mahlai, The Kotaibi, with a total fighting strength of about 4,000. Of these, the Kotaibi, numbering some 1,500 to 1,800 fighting men, is the principal tribe. They are nominally under the Amir of Dala, but as evidenced by the events of 1903 in which two British expeditions had to be sent againstthem, the second, against the Kotaibi, of a somewhat serious nature, it is apparent that he has very little real hold over them. They are of a wild and intractable nature, much given to raiding, for which they have the less excuse as their valleys are very fertile ; they are more in the nature of a thorn in the Amir's side than a source of additional strength. Blood feuds exist between the various tribes, but these do not prevent their combining against a common enemy. The classes represented in the Amir of Data’s territories are the Shekhs or hereditary chiefs, either of districts or of the various villages. They may be called hereditary although it does not necessarily follow that the son of a Shekh always succeeds his father, but it is usually the case. The Sayids or religious caste, descended from the prophet, who form practically autonomous communities. The Sayid communities in Amiri country are the Bani Said of Jabal Jihaf before mentioned, the Sayids of Dubiyat, a rich community of the Sufian branch, whose original founder is buried near Lahej, the capital of the Abdali country, the Ahl Ha] Said, and the Sayids of Habil al Jabr living to the east of the Radfan mountains. The Kaba’il,' or tribesmen, independent householders who form the main fighting force of the country, and who in the case of districts which pay tribute, pay tithes to the Amir. The “Raya,” subjects of the Amir who cultivate land belonging to- him, of the produce from which he takes a half. These are chiefly repre sented by the people of Harir and a few villages in the Dala valley. The “ Asakir ” or professional soldiers, maintained by the Amir, of whom there are some two or three hundred. The slaves, “ Abid, ' and their descendants. The Jews, of whom there are some thousands in Amiri territory, and about 400 in Dala itself, are the principal craftsmen in the country. The Amir Shaif bin Saif lives at Bala itself in a large tower above the town, the Dar al Haid. He is an intelligent and capable man, and as Arab rulers go, may be considered enlightened. He has much to be thankful for to the British, for the restoration of territory which the Turks had annexed, and his interest is best served by being friendly to us. During the British occupation of Dala he amassed large sums of money, but his gratitude in no way conflicted with his business interests. He has several sons, of whom all, except the eldest Nasir bin Shaif, and one of the younger, Sef, a boy of fifteen, are kept much in the back-ground. The Amir wdll probably be succeeded by Nasir who seems a capable young man. Further details regarding this tribe will be found in the report on Dala. The Haushabi tribe. The population of the Haushabi country is estimated at about 7,000 souls. Unlike the Amiri, they form one tribe under their Sultan, sub divided into some 50 small clans. There are, however, two main divisions the Haushabi proper, inhabiting the eastern part of the country, and the fiban valley, as well as the northern boundary, and the ’Amri (plural ’Amur), a division comprising some 6 clans with from 200 to 300 fight ing men, inhabiting the tract enclosed by the Wadis Warezan and Akkan, and the Wadi Hidaba. They were formerly a small independent tribe who some generations back came under the domination of the Haushabi(W) •5 Su'tan : they pay tribute an.l may be considered an integral portion of the a Sultan* Mohsin bin AH is a weak and ill-balanced ruler as far f^^and WU v t ,a^ a )0 ung man of an amiable, but not very bright disposition.

The Subehi are a wild and independent tribe numbering in all perhaos wfcT g m . en » and with the exception of the sections settled in the Wadi Ma din, and a few other valleys, mainly nomadic. They have no ve U rv a fitfl° r h , ead Shek b ^nd are divided into a number of sub-Uibes with very little cohesion and frequently blood-feuds between them, and for this reason, and on account of their being thinly distributed over wide areas combination on a general scale is unlikely. ’ J ar, *° US j t? b ; trib / S are ~ in the north-east corner the Humedi, Ba sus, Juberi and Matarafi, nomad clans of 40 to 100 fighting men owning herds of sheep and goats and inhabiting a very barren, rocky and Materless country. The first three named are notorious raiders and are entirely nomads without any habitations. The Matarafi own t or 4 towers and a little cultivation m Wadi Mulehia, but are practically nomafls. J he same description applies to the Makhdumi to their west The ^ n TtZ' T are K- S - lg Jl tly u? 10 ' e vt Se &gt; t J tled * Tte Dubeni still more to the west, and the Jurabun the Warn Ma din, are far more prosperous tribes, living j ages ^ell-built stone towers, with a good deal of cultivation 1 he last-named 4 tribes have about 300 fighting men each. The Jurabi and Dubem, though very prosperous, are no less warlike than their intract- able, and wilder, eastern neighbours, continual blood feuds prevailing • Noth.—N ow succeeded by Ali Mana.among them. The jliledi are mostly in the village of Sliawar. The Atifi and Buremi have one or two villages each, with cultivation around, but are mainly nomadic. The tribes on the west are generally much more tractable than those on the east. In ordinary intercourse, the Subehi tribesman is a far pleasanter man to meet than the Dala or Haushabi yokel, although it is not wise to place too much reliance on his good faith. The classes chiefly represented in the Subehi country ate the tribesmen, the Sayids, who are very numerous in the Wadi Ma’din, and in small settlements to the west (in the Mudariba valley, Turan, etc.). The majority of these are of the Sufian branch. They are peaceable people and though many of them go armed, are not, at any rate, aggressive. The “ Hajri ” are also frequently met with, and are a very useful class as messengers, guides, etc. The Hajri are said to have migrated from a village of that name in the Hadramaut. They are of unmistakeable African origin, and are migratory in their habits, travelling from place to place, and working at harvest-time, collecting supplies for petty trading transactions, etc. The Subehi are dealt with in greater detail later on. The Abdali. The Abdali were the first tribe with whom we entered into relations. Since the taking of Aden, and the early years of British occupation our relations with the Abdali have been close and friendly. The tribe numbers some 10,000 to 15,000 inhabitants, of whom about half inhabit the capital, Al Hauta or Lahej. It would appear that even from the earliest days, the Abdali have never had a warlike reputation. Instances have occur red in their history, when they have bought off the attacks of the Aulaki and other warlike tribes, and when the Sultan has been at war with his neigh bours, he has depended very largely on the services of hired mercenaries, from other, and more warlike, tribes. From their position on the main trade route to the interior, and their proximity to Aden, the population is much more mixed than that of the other tribes. The Abdali proper are divided into some 60 clans, but even among these, the admixture of negro blood is considerable. Representatives of the various races met with at a seaport like Aden, may be found in Lahej, Sidis, Somalis Hajris, etc .rt ' y e ; ga t ged * n , cultivatin k fertile tract enclos ed by the two branches of the d iban, and from this district, Aden is practmally supplied in grass, forage, vegetables, wood, etc. The Sultan, Sir Ahmad Fadl, &gt;^an intelligent man, in close relations with the Aden esi ency. He is in many ways a go-between between the British authorities and other less known tribes and is in possession of a arge revenue derived from transit-dues on goods, payment from the Brkifh esHmateTbt Hu r „t':Hn' I 88 t 6 P r, d ' ‘T 8 ° n etC ‘ ™ s ^nue was esrimacea 05 nunter in 1000 as reaching an aggregate of -70 0™ 1 he Sultan entertains a body of sfvahili fill Lv in number who form Ins body guard.

P C man y The authority exercised by the Sultan of f ahei w u- is much more absolute than that of the chiefs of any of theTribes17 previously mentioned. The administration of civil and criminal justice is according to the usual Mahomedan law, and is in the hands of the Kadi of Lahej, but the Sultan occasionally adjudicates in serious cases. The Akrabi Are a small tribe of some 250 fighting men. They bear a warlike reputation and were originally a sub-tribe of the Abdali, till over ico years back, they asserted their independence, and wrested the fort of Bir Ahmad from the Sultan of Lahej The revenue they originally derived from transit dues has greatly declined, and their chief source of income is the sale of forage, jowari, wood, etc. The Yafa'i. Yafa is divided into two powerful tribes connected by origin and inter course, but quite separate from the point of view of administration. The two main divisions are, according to British nomenclature, the Upper Yafa'i and the Lower Yafa’i. These divisions are based on the respective geographical positions of the tribes as well as on the fact of the Upper Yafa’i inhabiting higher country. At the same time, these appellations are not technically correct as the Arabic name for the Upper Yafa’i is the Yafa’i as Sufal (Sufal meaning “ low,”) and the Lower Yafa’i are always referred to as the Yafa’i Bani Kasid. Although it is as well to mention this anomaly, it will be found simpler to retain the accus tomed designations of “Upper ” and “ Lower ' throughout. The Upper Yafa’i or Yafa'i as Sufal are a large and warlike tribe in habiting a very rugged and mountainous country As no British force has ever penetrated into it, is more than usually difficult to gauge their fighting strengths This has, however, been estimated at some 20,000 to 25,000 fighting men. The Upper Yafa’i are divided into 5 main tribes, and certain dependen cies, owning allegiance to the Sultan, are also included among them. The principal divisions of Upper Yafa proper are — The Mausata, numbering some 8,000 fighting men. The Dube, numbering about 5,000 fighting men. The Muflahai numbering some 5,000 men. The B’osi, numoering some 500 men. The Da’ucii, numbering some 500 men. Each of these sub-tribes are further sub-divided into a number of clans. In addition, there are the following Utached tribes :— The Shaibi, with a fighting strength of about 2,500. Rube’aten with some 400 fighting men. N avva ,, ,, ,, ,, Juban „ „ 800 „ „ Dabiani „ „ w „ „ The ruler of the Upper rata’i is the Sulttn Kahtan bin’Umr. His authority is, however, far from absolute, and he might rather be described as the hereditary chief in time of war or nat onal stress. The Mausata are, under the rul# of a chief, styled the Nakib, and except that they now acknowledge the frmily of Kahtan, the Ahl She Mi Ali [C57QMGIB] Ci8 as the heads of Yafa, are independent. The present Nakib is Ali Askar who, in common with his brother Mohsin, rules the Mausata. They are very old men and much of their authority is delegated to Ali Mohsin Askar, the nephew of the Nakib. He is a man of exceptionally shrewd and strong character. The Dube are also under a powerful Shekh, Muhammad Muthanna bin Atif Jabr, while the Muflahai owe allegiance to Shekh Abdarrahman as Sakkaf. Not only is each of these chiefs practically independent, but Kahtan is unfortunate in the possession of a turbulent brother, Salih bin Umr, as well as cousins of Turkish proclivities, and on his return from Aden in 1903, where he had been to conclude a treaty with the British, he found himself shut out of his capital, A 1 Mahajaba, by his brother Salih, Of the dependencies, the Shaibi are chiefly under Mausata influence. They are a warlike tribe, sharing many of the characteristics of the Upper Yafa’i. Rube’aten, N’awa, and Juban, though the inhabitants/like the majority of the Yafa’i are of Himiaritic origin, are possibly by reason of their geographical position, of a less wild character than the Yafa’i and Shaibi. The people of Dabiani are to all intents and purposes nomads. 1 he families of Kahtan, the Nakibs, and headmen generally are physi cally of a very fine type ; well-built, with good features and an unmistakeable air of good breeding, and well-educated, they hardly seem to belong to the same country as the wilder tribesmen. Education is universal among the Shekhs, and Sayids. of whom there are many. The Yafa’i tribesman is of sturdy physique and independent character. The vice of cupidity is strongly marked throughout. Many of them turn their warlike proclivities to pro fitable account by taking service in war time with other tribes, and they furnish a contingent to the Nizam of Hyderabad. It is also not uncommon to find men who have seen the world as firemen, chiefly on Messagerie ships, and to find oneself addressed in English or French by a wild-looking indi vidual in a blue kilt, and covered with the indigo dye which comes off freely, is a sufficiently startling experience. The Lowey Yafa’i or Yafa'i Bani Kasid —also known as the Bani Afif, number some 8,000 fighting men. In general characteristics, they resemble the Upper Yafa’i. The Sultan^ Abdalla bin Mohsin who lives at A1 Kara maintains close relations with the Upper Yafa’i with whom he has considerable influence. 1 he four principal divisions of the tribe are— The Kaladi with some 2,500 fighting men. ■ Th 6 ” ■ ' Il5 ° 0 - '» I he Sadi , 2j ooo „ „ The Yazidi .. * ,,000 '» v &gt;1 » )&gt; )) ,, ,, P iese ar ® st iH further sub-divided into a number of clans. Hairis and r^hadims, a low caste approximating to the sweeper, are found near A 1 Husn in the lower country. 1 nc, r auli. + 1 \ Fac , 1 are .M P°' ver ^ u J tr ib e w ith some 6,000 fighting men, of turbulent and warhke disposition, who from the date of the taking Aden till the year 1870, displayed consistent hostility to the British. *19 They are divided into some 24 sections, of which the principal are the Markashi, Allaha, Ahl Hanash, Ahl Hasana and Dathina. The Markashi who possess a large slice of the eastern sea board and who reside in the hills, claim descent from the Himiarites, while the Dathina and Ahl Hasana come of Upper Aulaki stock. The code of morality seems, among the mountaineers of the Fadli country, to be of a lower order than in the remainder of Yemen, the curious custom prevailing among the Markashi of holding a baseborn son in greater estimation than a legitimate one. Since 1870 the Fadli have been at continual feud either with the Lower Aulaki or with the Lower Ya f a i, a standing bone of contention with the latter being the water rights of a canal, the Naz’ia, cut for irrigation purposes from the Bana river. British intervention in their inter-tribal dis putes has been frequently necessitated, and may very possibly again be called for. The Dathina and other tribes in the eastern Fadli country are very little under the control of the Sultan, and are of a wild and predatory disposition. The present Sultan is reported to be at the point of death and it seems to be uncertain who his successor will be. The Aulaki. The Aulaki like the Yafa'i are divided into two main divisions, the Upper and Lower. Very little is known of the country or indeed of the people. Many clans are of a wild type and predatory in their habits. The Upper Aulaki are under the Sultan Salih bu Abdalla. According to Mr. Bury, they can muster some 9,coo fighting men, of whom about 1,000 are “ Asakir” or professional soldiers maintained by the Sultan. Of the inhabitants of the town of Ansab, some 60 per cent, are Hadramaut merchants. Not only are the outlying tribes much addicted to raiding, but also counter-raids are made sub rosa from Ansab on the offenders, the Sultan apparently finding this system of punishment more congenial than a regular punitory expedition. The district of Yeshbum is under its own ruler, Om Rasas bin Farid, who is, to all intents and purposes, independent of the Sultan, but they are closely allied for mutual defence. The inhabitants are much engaged in commercial pursuits. The Upper Aulaki are divided into two main divisions, the Ahl Maan and the Ahl Mahajar. Each of these tribes numbers some 4,000 fight ing men and is divided into sub-tribes, which again are split into a variety of clans. With the exception of those inhabiting the towns, their occupations are pastoral and agricultural, many of them being nomadic. The inhabitants of Yeshbum are included among the Ahl Maan. The Ahl Hamam, a division of the Ahl Mahajar, numbering 1,200 men are nomadic, and inclined to be predatory, and scour the Hamami desert on the look out for caravans. The Lower Aulaki are formed by the large tribe of the Ba Kazim who number between 4,000 and 5,000 men. This tribe is split up into some 20 sub-tribes, and the population seems fairly evenly divided between agricultural and nomadic classes. Two Sahmai chiefs, Fadl and Ali bin Mehsin, are at the present time supreme among the Ba Kazim, and of the two, Ali, who lives at Jidhaba, is the most influential.20 The Alawi. The A'avri are a small tribe inhabiting the angle between the Haushabi and Amiri territories and the Radfan mountains. Their principal village is A 1 Kasb'a, in the Selat Hardaba, other villages being A 1 Khariba, As Sauda, Al Hauta, Ad Danib, Jiml and Al Hajar. The total population does not exceed 1,500, the fighting men num bering about 500. They are under the rule of a Shekh who like other rulers in South Yemen, originally administered the country for the Imam of Sana’a and subsequently became independent. The Shekh receives a stipend from Government of 60 dollars per annum, secured under Govern ment Resolution of 14th May 1875, and a protectorate Treaty concluded in 1895. They are a friendly tribe, on bad terms with their neighbours the Kotaibi. A good deal of land is under cultivation near the Selat Hardaba, according to Hunter, about 1,000 acres. Jovvari is the staple crop. The existing wells in the country contain, as a rule, a poor supply of water. The inhabitants consist of tribesmen, and “ Raya ” or subjects, in about equal proportion. Hunter states that the administration of civil and criminal justice lies in the hands of the Shekh, but that an appeal lies to the Kadi of Dufciyat, the Sufi colony in Amiri territory. The Wahidi. Little more information is available concerning the ccast-tribe, than is contained in Colonel Hunter’s ‘‘ Arab tribes in the vicinity of Aden ” from which the following is condensed. The Wahidi inhabit a stretch of territory near the Wadi Maifd which includes some 50 miles of coast line extending from Ras al Kalb to a point west of Balhaf, where the territory of the Duyaibi commences. It is divided into 3 main districts— r. Habban. 2. ’iizan. 3. Bir AH. The principal places of (1) are— Habban with some 250 houses and 2,500 inhabitants situated in the midst of a plain about 3,000 feet high. Hauta with some 200 houses and 2,000 inhabitants on the Wadi Amakfn. Roda, Sh’ab, Tirdan and Arrakin. The chief villages of (2) are— ’Izzan with some 300 inhabitants. Kadur „ „ 1 000 „ Libya ,, ,, 600 ,, Raida ,, ,, i,coo ,, Radum ,, ,, 800 „ Other villages in Wahidi territory are Ras-al-Kalb, Bir Ali, Baihaf ^nu Ras-al-Majdaha. The population of Ras-al-Kalb is estimated at 2,000. Bir-Ali and Balhaf contain very few inhabitants. The harbour of Bir Ali is a small circular and safe bay, 1 mile long by i£ broad, exposed to winds from the south. 1'he total population is estimated at 9,000 souls.v 21 The British Government is in treaty relations with the Wahidi Sultans nf Ralhaf and Bit Ali, the former of whom can muster some 6oo, and the lal er 2 500 followers. Many of these, however, are Hajris. The country in the vicinity of the Wadi Malta’ is described as fertile, jowari, bajn, wheat and barley as well as dates and limes being grown. Four crops are reaped yearly, one rain crop and three irrigation; cattle are tew in num ber but sheep and goats numerous. At Habban water is more scarce and irrigation is not possible. . The inhabitants are not of an aggressive character. ^ Administration lies in the bands of the Sultans but their power is not despotic. Important matters are discussed with the bhekhs of sub-tribes, ■some 8 in number, and an appeal lies to the Sharifs or Sayids who have considerable influence. .0 j t Relations with the Wahidi first began in 1872 and some ten years later tl ev requested to be placed under British protection but no steps were taken in the matter till in 1888 protectorate treaties were entered into with the Sultans of Bir Ali and Balhaf in common with other tribes alone the coast. The Sultan of Balhaf has on two occasions given some trouble necessitating the despatch of a man-of-war and a small force, and in 1894 he was brought to Aden and confined at Sira island for some time. Trka. Irka is a small port of the Duyaibi tribe which is in the possession of i ^hekh of the Badas family whose ancestors settled at Haura many years ago whence they moved to Irka. It was opened as a port for trade seme 40 years back against the wishes of the Wahidi Sultans who were, however, powerless to prevent it as the Shekh possessed considerable in fluence. A protectorate treaty was made with him in 1888. , A treaty was made with the Shekh of Lower Haura a small port to the Yvest of Ghubbet-al-Ain in the same year. The Ka’iti. (Makalla and Shehr). The important seaports of Makalla and Shehr are now in the hands of this tribe and a Protectorate Treaty was concluded with their ruler, the lamadar of Shehr and Makalla in 1888. The history of these ports is, 1 owever inextricably connected with two other tribes—the kathiri and the Kasadi ’d he former who were a powerful tribe numbering some 7,000 fiohtine men were in possession of the ports and the surrounding country some 400 years ago. Owing to internal dissensions, they called on the Yafa’i to intervene and a sub-tribe of the latter thus gained a footing there and eventually possessed themselves of Makalla, and the Ka iti, another sub-tribe of Shehr. The Kathiri made several attempts to re-take these places and in 1866 actually captured Shehr but were unable to hold it for Inner In the early years of the last century, members of the Ka iti and the Sir took service with the Nizam of Hyderabad and settled there, amassing considerable wealth. I he continual fighting that subsequently occurred was complicated by the assistance o the faction at Hyderabad involving on several occasions the purchase of steamers to interfere with Ihc rival party’s shipping, and thus necessitating the frequent intervention of the British Government.22 Turkish intrigues further complicated the situation. AH attempts to arbitrate in the dispute proved fruitless, and in 1881, the Ka'iti ruler, the- Jamadar of Shehr, finally captured Makalla and the adjacent place’s of Fuwa and Rurum, thus dispossessing the Kasadi Nakib who took refuge in Aden. A Protectorate Treaty was concluded with the Jamadar of Shehr and Makalla in 1882, one clause of which provided for a lakh of dollars being paid by the latter for the maintenance of the ex-Nakib. The trade from the two ports is considerable and the revenue accruing to the Jamadar was estimated at dollars 1,20,000 per annum. No recent data as to the amount are available. The Jamadar possesses a steamer by means of which frequent inter course with Hyderabad is maintained. His standing force was estimated by Hunter at t,8oo men but more recent reports place the number at 1.000. The men receive some sort of training from Indian pensioned officers. Till lately they were armed with nondescript rifles but sanction for the purchase from the British Government of 600 Martinis was recently applied for. 3 The Mahri. The territory of the Mahri tribe embraces a large tract around the port of Kishn with a population, including many Bedouin tribes, of some 50.000. The island of Sokotra is also an appanage of the Mahri Sultan of Kishn and is governed by a member of his family. The island which is very mountainous is visited by small native trading craft, the principal product for export being ghee. v ^ As early as 1835 negotiations for the possession of the island were entered into and a detachment of troops landed and camped there but nothing came of it and they were withdrawn. It was not till 1886 that a protectorate treaty was finally entered into with the Sultan of Kishn and Sokotra.mm 23 CHAPTER III. Climate and health report. In a country of such varying altitudes as the Aden Hinterland, ranging from the sea-level to 8,000 ft., it follows that a general appreciation of the climate is impossible. For purposes of description, the country may be divided into three general classes, (a) the low-lying plain country between the hills and the seashore, ( 3 ) the lower valleys and river-beds, and (&lt;?) the elevated plateau and hill country. (a) The plain, of which the majority consists of sandy desert, or “ khabt ” is, as may be expected, very hot. In theactual neighbourhood of the sea, the atmosphere is like that of Aden, moist and steamy, but a very few miles inland, a marked difference is perceptible, the atmosphere being of the typical dry, and desert, character. The cooler weather in this plain lasts for 3 or, at the most, 4 months, from November till February. Unfor tunately, no data as to temperature are available, but it may be said that although no actual cold weather can be experienced, the climate at this season would offer no obstacle to the operations of troops. The nights are fresh and even up to the end of May, no really hot nights were experienced. As a rule a good breeze blows during the day and night dying away in the early morning and evening. The Boundary Commission was working in the lower country between Jabal Hawab and Shekh Said till the end of May, and although it had been found advisable to send away the British troops with the escort and supporting column, in April, as several slight cases of sun-stroke had occurred and one man died from the heat on the march to the coast (the troops were in single-fly tents), no sickness from the heat occurred, either among the British officers, or the native troops. The labours of the survey-party and their escort were arduous, involving day long exposure to the sun, and the continual ascent of hills, but no evil effects resulted. The highest temperature recorded under the single fly of a tent, during the month of May, was 104 deg. Fahr. This tract may in fact be summed up as hot but healthy, the only factor for sickness, other than that due to the sun, being the occasional necessity of drinking brackish water, which after a few days produced diarrhoea, and occasionally, dysentery. From May to September, sand-storms are of frequent occurrence, and thunder, accompanied by heavy showers of rain, sometimes all three com bined, occur. While the Commission was encamped among the low hills at Karaba, at a height of about 2,000 feet, in early May, after several oppres sive days, a heavy thunderstorm was experienced, with a violent wind which levelled many tents, and torrential rain mingled with hail. The storm lasted for 2 hours when the river beds became rushing and impassable torrents. These characteristics do not, however, apply to the lower-lying country under cultivation, such as the Lahej oasis, where the standing crops and irrigation channels, not only render the atmosphere more oppres sive, but also conduce to the breeding of anopheles mosquitoes, and consequ ent malaria. The neighbourhood of Lahej, and the Tiban above it, have a bad reputation on this account, and the shortest possible halts compatible with the necessities of the occasion should be made. (£) Though somewhat cooler than the low-lying plain-country, the lower hills, and country near the river beds, are responsible for nearly all the sickness that occurred among the troops, both native and British, employed *(A 24 in the Hinterland during 1903, and the early part of 1904. That this sickness was most severe, the medical reports shew, for beyond the large percentage of deaths, and the very large roll of sick, every regiment or corps, whether British or native, which passed a month or so in these parts, was reported unfit for further active service on their return to Aden. The foregoing remarks apply particularly to the valley of the Tiban, at certain points of which, political and military requirements necessitated the presence of troops ; at Dar Akkan and at Musemir, for some months each, and at Nobat Dukem, practically continuously. The first- named place may be described as a death-trap.. The natives hold that it is inhabited by devils, and there seems some ground for this belief, in the light of the consequences to the troops stationed there. Malaria also occurred among troops stationed near Hardaba and at Sulek in the Selat Hardaba, as well as among those employed in the Kotaibi expedition, where camping near the river beds was a necessity, but to a less extent. Mosquitoes are common in all these parts. We know little about the Bana; the upper Bana at any rate does not bear a malarious reputation, but the lower reaches are no doubt unhealthy. With regard to the Yeramis valley, Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Bent who passed up it in 1897, were brought back to Aden quite prostrated by malaria, and lay ill in hospital for several weeks. Mr. Bent's death, immedi ately on returning to England, may be attributed to the consequences of this illness. The malaria, especially in the Tiban valley, is of a serious and sometimes a malignant kind. At the same time, it does not appear that this malarious belt extends very far from the river. The Boundary Com mission marched down the Tiban in December, 1903, from the Dakkarn to near Musemir. Camps were, wherever possible, selected on the high plateaux several hundred feet above the river. Turning off near Musemir, the Commission passed two months near Addareja and above Hawemi in the Wadi Natid. There was practically no malaria either among the personnel or the escort. Anopheles mosquitoes were observed, though not in large quantities, and no doubt in the rainy season the results w r ould have been different. Prophylactic quinine parades were regularly held. (c) The climate of the higher country, such as the Dala valley, with a general elevation of 4j5° 0 5&gt; 0o ° ft., and of the hills rising to 8,000 ft., is both temperate and healthy. Although the troops at Dala were in single- flv tents, no great hardship during the hotter months was experienced, and the nights were invariably fresh. In 1902, some malaria occurred among the members, and escort, of the Commission at Dala. In the case of the latter it was possibly attributable to the fact of their having to furnish escorts to convoys to Aden, which involved the passing of the malarious Hardaba and Tiban valleys. The health of the troops stationed at Dala in 1903, the “Aden 5 '°-! u . m !) was considered by the Medical Officers as ‘'Good falling to hair when the detachments from the malarious Tiban valley were brought in, and it appears to be the general opinion that the malaria which subsequently occurred was contracted when in the unhealthy tracts above referred to. A little scurvy occurred among natives, but fresh vegetable? were soon procurable. Several cases of enteric occurred among British troops at Dala. A committee of medical officers faded to find the direct cause and the cases were classed as sporadic. Dysentery was of frequent occurrence throughout the country. A few cases of pneumonia and pulmo nary disease attributed to chill or exposure, as well as liver complaintsV *5 from the same cause, also occurred. In the spring of 1903, boils, and sores caused by failure of abrasions, etc., to heal, were not uncommon.' Kain may be expected between May and October ; it is very local in its effects and precarious It varies much from year to year and does not appear to depend on th? regular monsoon currents. As a rule it takes the form of heavy storms accompanied by thunder and frequently hail, which last for an hour or two. Occasionally a fine rain or drizzle lasting for some hours sets in, but this is not common. The storms usually occur towards the evening, or in the afternoon. The heaviest fall is as a rule during the months of June, July, and August, while September, October, and November, were found (esp. in 1902) to be the most unhealthy months. The differ ence in the prevalence of malaria in Dala itself, in the two years 1902 and ico3, is probably due to the fact that the rainfall in the former year (r3 inches) was much heavier, and standing crops abounded, while in 1903, the actual neighbourhood of Dala was quite denuded of them, and very few mosquitoes were observed. At the same time the climate is never so malarious as to defeat all precautions and preventive measures, which certainly proved to be the case in the Tiban valley. The prevailing wind was from the s &gt;ulh-east The cold weather is fresh and pleasant (December to March), the nights cold, but stopping short of frost. Mist is common in the early part of the day during the cold months. Occasional light rain falls. On the highe r mountains, the climate is always cool and pleasant, frost often occur ring in the winter. The rainfall cn the mountains is naturally heavier, the great mass of Jabal Jdiaf attracting much of the rain from the Dala vallev, and the hail is very severe. The idea of using Jihaf as a Sanatarium for Aden is under dis ussion. If otherwise feasible the scheme would doubtless have ben-‘ficial results. The fever-stricken invalids from Dar Akkan were stationed for some months at Balas, some two-thirds of the way up, with excellent results. With regard to the eastern part of the protectorate, we have no experience, but it may be taken for granted that under the same conditions of altitude, country, and climate, the same results may be expected.

Much can no doubt be done by careful selection of camps, filling in or treating stagnant pools, etc., but in the neighbourhood of a river where sluggish back-waters abound, this is almost impossible. A liberal issue of quinine is essential. Medical autho rities have recommended the issue of mosquito-netting for the troops. Eminently sensible as is the suggestion, it is difficult of execution when, as was the case, troops were sleeping on the ground in single-fly G. S. tents, or, as in the Kotaibi expedition, bivouacking without any tents at all, but in the event of permanent occupation, under more comfortable conditions, its adoption should present no difficulties. The connection between mosquitoes and malaria is too well known to require comment, but as a concrete instance of personal observation, it may be mentioned, that during the occupation of Fashoda in 1899, a detachment of the battalion in garrison there were stationed at a spot on the Sobat river, more malarious, if possible, than Fashoda, and were provided with mosqu ito curtains, whereas the troops at Fashoda had none. The detachment .suffered of course, but in a far less degree than the head-quarters at Fashoda. The quality of the dtinking water in the parts visited was on the whole good, and though dysentery occurred, disease due to water cannot be said to have borne a large part in the general health of the t oops With regard to the diseases most prevalent among the Arabs, and which came under the notice of the various medical officers malaria was27 almost universal, more severe of C °J irS ^ Jmararla'even among small districts, where greatly enlarged ^eens duetto mai for children, were the rule ; S yphihs was » e cially near the coast, treatment.

Resources. .. ^—Agriculture claims the attention of a very large proper- t.on of the inhabitants of the British Protectorate. Unpromisfn/asThe coun ry looks, the fertility of the mountain valleys and slopes, and the a luvial tracts near the streams and rivers, is surprising. Immense phins are taken throughout to secure any possible irrigation ; water rights^ are the most frequent cause of inter-tribal strife, ! n the mountains, where the r^d[L^7 deilt th p , rainfal! &gt; g peat ingenuity is often disp]a &gt;e d A Ug v' e ra :r water nght round ahiI1 toa particular field to be ^ 16 1 r , ,Vers ’ fre( T j ent irrigation channels carry off the ater while the smaller streams are diverted to the fells according nn A hX L ed p g reement » so many days being given to a proprietor on o e bank and so many to one on the other, while after their turn the stream is allowed to_ flow for a mile or so further, for a day or wo o the benefit of a third proprietor.

Dates are grown in large quantities in the Wadi Ma’ciin and in the Suhehi valleys, westwards towards the coast. Those n &gt;t required forborne consumption are expo ted: contractors from Aden buying the crop on the tree. They are also grown in the Aulaki country, but not to the same extent. Onions of small size but fair quality, and leeks, are also grown. Potatoes of excellent quality were obtainable in Dala, being imported from Turkish Yemen. Grapes and small peaches are obtainable in Dala, but the majority are grown in Mares, an V other Furkish district^. Coffee is not grown in large quantities in the British Protectorate, the best coming from the Turkish side of the border. Some, however, is grown in Yafa, the Halmin and Kotaibi valleys, and a little near Dala. “ Kat ” is an irrigated crop, on which much labour is expended. Some, but not very much, is grown in British territory. Indigo is chiefly grown in the neighbourhoo.l of Behan and the northern Au'aki counfry ; it is largely imported into other districts and is the staple dye for clothes “ Waras,' bastard saffron, is grown, chiefly on J. Jihaf, and is exported to Aden. Roses flourish in the Shaibi country, and are used for the manufac ture of attar of roses. They are also grown in the Hadramaut. Cotton is grown in Behan and the northern Aulaki country. In the higher regions the climate and soil are well adapted to European vege tables, most of which were grown in Dala successfully. Supplies ,— Broadly speaking, none of the districts in the British Pro tectorate produce more cereal food stuffs than are required for the consump tion of the inhabitants, taking good years with bad. This applies parti cularly to the majority of the country, which is non-irrigated and depen dent on the rainfall. The district of Lahej may perhaps be excepted. It largely supplies Aden with jowari, grass, karbi, etc., but any very heavy extra call on its resources would be likely to cause a shortage in one direction or the other. At the same time, Lahej can be depended on for larger quantities than other districts, as it has the advantage of irrigation. Grass is brought into Aden from Lahej and the neighbouring country and in the winter is fairly plentiful, but as the hot weather progresses it becomes very expensive, 14 annas or 1 rupee being the cost of an Aden maund of 28 lbs. During the occupation of Dala in 1903, it was found impossible to supply the mules of the 2 mountain batteries with forage locally. Orders were at one time given to obtain as much grain as possible on the spot, to save the very heavy item of transport. The figures are given in the report on Dala and shew the amount of the various items obtained, and the prices paid. Before the arrival of the troops, the local rates were 2 to 3 times lower. 1902 had been a good year for crops, but the figures are not absolutely representative, as some, though probably not very much, was brought in from the Turkish districts of Yubi and Haiki, till the Turks stopped its exportation. These two districts, in close proximity to the Amiri country, and with a level road for transport, produce a quantity of jowari, but the probability of Turkish interference discounts their value. It is as well to note that the Turkish country, practically all along the border, is most fertile, and that the tribes on the British side, often obtain their supplies thence, when their own crops fail. The sequel to our purchase of30 crrain In Dala was, that the harvest of 1903, proving a failure, the people who had sold most of their grain reserve, had some difficulty in supplying Uieir wants and in the ensuing winter and spring, had to pay exorbitant ratG TTatspTt'is^lso'a difficulty throughout, in obtaining supplies from a distance, as the people, in the case of an expedition of any size, will have hired out their camels, and unless camels are supplied by the troops wantin'* the supplies, there is great difficulty in getting them in. _ In^theHiushabi country, there is no difficulty in getting gram and forage in moderate quantities, but fora large force, Lahej, and ot - r neighbouring districts, would have to be drawn on, as the cultivation in thewe^tern portion is mostly in the restricted 1 iban bed. The Fadli country contains a very fertile tract between the Bana and Hassan. It is not apparently as much cultivated as U might be, and the standin- dispute between the Fadli and Lower \af’ai above referred to, introduces an element of uncertainty as to the yield to be expected at any 81Ve Ti e a Subehi country is entirely barren In its eastern and southern nor tions but a fertile tract is found near the Wadi Ma’chn which compares favour ably with other districts. No difficulty was found in supplying some 800 camels with forage during March and April, and the markets were well supplied with native food-stuffs at moderate rates. The valleys westwards, thence to the coast, vs ere, as a rule, fertile, and some 600 camels were supplied with forage without any difficulty. Th e staple forage for animals is, universallyj the staiks ana leaves of the dhirra and duklin. . . . ^ , j xt 1 ,, D • During the Kotaibi expedition in October and November, the Bujer and Mazra valleys were covered with excellent dhirra and dukhn crops. Some soo camels, and the mules of a mountain battery and transport mules, were freely supplied with forage. Much was also destroyed, but even then, whole fields remained standing. , , * , . f It is worth noting for similar expeditions that the Arab in case ot hostilities, invariably buries his grain, either ina“ madfan ' or deep grain- pit or under the manure heaps near the villages, the grain being sewn in bags of matting. These are carefully concealed and often hard to dis cover but they repay a little investigation. The Shaibi valleys and Rube'aten, and by all accounts. Yafa also, are fertile. Bearded wheat and barley are chiefly grown. It is impossible to estimate the amount of forage available, but it does not seem likely that a very large quantity would be procurable, while if the Yafa were hostile, it would be difficult to obtain. At the same time, in the case of an advance aloncr the Selat Sih, on the north-western Yafa border, the districts to the north-west, which are by all accounts fertile, might be tapped. But too little is known of the local conditions to say anything for certain. According to Mr. Bury’s account, dhirra is sown in Dahr and the Upper Aulaki country in May and in Dathina and other districts, south of the Kaur al Audilla in October, and ripens in four months. Dukhn is chiefly grown in Dathina in May. Dijr is grown in Dathina and “ kadb ” a species of clover in Dahr, and the Upper Aulaki, and occasional good grass is found. Grass is, as a rule, very scanty, and imported compress'd bales were almost always necessary.( 3 * Commerce .-—The greater proportion of the tra'Je in the districts under British protection, more especially in.the western portion, is a transit trade from Turkish Yemen, from which coffee, “ kat,' and skins, in large quantities, are exported, and to w'hich in return, kerosene oil, clothes, tobacco, etc., are imported ; the districts through which these commodities pass, obtaining their revenue from transit dues, guaranteeing the safety of caravans, etc. Hides are the principal export from Dala and the neigh bouring districts, as also, with the addition of dates, from the Subehi. The coast towns from Aden eastwards^ do a considerable trade in sharks’ fins and dried fish generally, 'these are largely exported to the East by sea, as also into the interior of the Hadramant. Dried fish are curiously enough often used as food for camels, specially on the east coast, towards the Hadramant. , TT , Honey is an article largely exported from Yeshbum and the Hadra mant generally. Much attention is also paid to apiculture in the western part of the Protectorate, but the export does not seem anything like so considerable as from the eastern d stricts. Frankincense, gum and attar of roses are also exported from the Hadramaut, while the imports are chieflv kerosene, cloths, hardware, etc. Brecch-loading rifles and carbines, and ammunition, are now freely imported, especially vU Ras al ‘Ara, and favourable landing places between Shekh Said and Aden, and some are said to filter ti.rough Turkish Yemen, being landed on the Red Sea coast, but it would seem that the larger quantity are imported direct. The chief markets for these are the town of Al Hauta (Lahej), and various markets at the head of the Ma’din valley. Grain, especially jowari, is imported to Aden from India, and in times of failure of crops, to the interior. . , . f . Industries .— Of these there are not many. The Jew^s are the chief arti ficers and produce the silver work used in ornaments, “Jimbe’a” (dagger) sheaths, etc., but the finest work of this kind comes from I urkish Yemen. Hides are roughly dressed for export. Rough blacksmith’s work is done, such as simple repairs to arms and agricultural implements. Weaving of a plain kind of cloth is carried on by Jews, better textures of more elaborate design come from Yafa, while the nomadic tribes to the north and east weave a kind of rug, and the black cloth of rough texture used for tents. Dyeing of cloths, both with indigo and a green dye obtained from a tree is carried on locally. Matting of palm fibre is made almost univer sally Carpentering is of a rough nature : doors and their frames, and agricultural implements are the usual t bjocts of their skill. ^ ^ Powder is manufactured both by Jews and Arabs ; it is of a coarse kind and usually used for the matchlock, but reloading and recapping sdid-drawn caitridges is carried on in Dala, and probably in other places cis well Masonry is of a good solid kind ; the blocks of stone are well trimmed and either built in with mortar, or in more simple buildings the crevices are filled in with small fragments of stone. Throughout the more mountainous country stone, a kind of granite, excellent for building, is plentiful. In the plain towns, mud-bricks are frequently used. „ ^ Generally speaking, manufactures are only sufficient for, and intended to supply, the simple needs of the inhabitants. Labour except in Aden and the coast towns, centres to which those in search of employment migrate, is scarce and difficult to obtain,33 as well as expensive. In several cases which came under notice in the Wadi Ma’din, the most thickly populated part of the Subehi country, for building towers and repairing wells, w orkmen were brought from Turkish territory. Hajris and analogous classes are often employed but they are not numerous. The experiment has not been tried in the interior, but it would seem that anything in the shape of a coolie corps from local Arabs would be unobtainable. A nimals —Camels are the universal beast of burden throughout the country. They are smaller in size than the Indian camel and l.ghter in build, suggesting rather an inferior riding camel, than a regular breed of baggage animal. I here are several varieties, but they may be civided generally into hill camels and plain camels The former are exceedingly active and sure-footed, and rheir leet wear wonderfully well in the stony ground. Few can carry a 400 lb. load, 300 lbs. would be about the aver age load for both hill and plain camels, and in very steep and mountainous country they w-ill not take more than 200 lbs. With a light load they will ascend rough slopes of to 8* for a limited distance. Nearly all the camels employed during 1902-4 were hired and accompanied by their owners On the whole they did fairly well ; the mortality was not great, and no large numbers broke down. The expeditions in w’hic-h they were used, though the ground traversed was often very trying, did not give continuous marching enough to try them very high, but the majority had been in hard work between Aden and Dala previously. The Arab camel has, however, tw r o very great disadvantages as a transport animal : he is accustomed to being watered every day, and will barelv go more than two days without water at a pinch, and he is used to being hand fed with jowari fodder, and when in work, the owner never seems to let him graze. This is some times inevitable, as good grazing is scarce in many hill tracts, but excellent grazing was met with at times in the Subehi country, and though forage was very scarce, pressure had to be put on the men to graze their animals. The only camels observed grazing freely were she-camels with young and camels out of w'ork. 1 here is no doubt the camel would g aze fieely, if allowed to, and would be all the better for it. Mang* is very prevalent throughout, and is respon-ible for many break-downs. The Arab, though he knows the remedy well enough, is often very careless about it in the earlier stages. Katran, a kin i of native tar, much used in the Sudan, is as good a remedy as anything, and can be obtained at almost any Arab village. With regard to numbers, it is difficult to make any very accurate estimate. Large numbers are engaged in the carrying trade, and judging by the loads, they were also the best specimens. 800 was the utmost, the camel-contractor at Dala estimated he could get from the Amiri country, and this number included some from Turkish Yemen. In fact, throughout, camels were brought in for hire from the Turkish districts, a large black animal being a noticeable variety. In 1903, camels were taken for Somaliland, and the last years generally w'ere perhaps not favourable to collecting large numbers. Local conditions may of course change, but it would be fairly safe to say that 1,500 to 2,000 workable animals would be the outside that one could expect to collect with a month’s notice for any given expedition. The contract( 33 price was one dollar (Rs. 1-4) a day including keep and camelman to 3 camels. A good baggage camel sells for about 70 dollars. It is as well to note, that during hostile operations, a piquet should always be placed on the camels, to prevent the drivers from bolting with their boasts Neglect of this precaution caused great inconvenience on several occasions, and it might well have serious consequences The riding camel is a fine animal, very active and capable of great endurance. The best are obtained from Lahej and the Subehi country. The Subehi begin riding them very young, but they take good care of them and they grow into strong animals. Those in possessi n of the Aden troop are of this stock ; they are good trotters and capable of hard woi k. Their feet last surprisingly *vell on stony ground. _ _ Some baggage camels purchased by the Commission, and carefully looked after, turned into fine strong animals and easily carried their 400 lbs day after day. The nomad clans of the Aulaki own riding camels but no details are available as to numbers. , Horses .—Horses in the Protecto ate are a negligible quantity. \\ ith the exception of the nomad tribes on the northern border, only the chief men are in possession of them. Small numbers are brought lor sale from Jauf, but they are as a rule coarse bred animals. Donkeys —are fairly numerous and of a strong but small breed. They carry loads up to about 120 lbs. and cost from 15 to 40 dollars. They are alS ° C^y^—areof a good stamp, both plough and slaughter oxen and milch-cows. The cost of either is between 20 ami 30 dollars. The m Ich-cows occasionally are particularly good. They are numerous throughout in settled districts, and no difficulty was expenenced in obtaining enough oxen to supply the British troops in Dala (1,000 men) during the yeat ^ShlTand^goah-^ plentiful throughout. Each cost from 4 to 6 dollars. The sheep make good mutton, but they are small, and it was found more economical to feed the troops on Soma!, sheep marched from Aden Thev are especially numerous among nomadic tubes like the Subehi The goats give a good yield of milk. In tune o( peace there would be no difficulty in obtaining good numbers of both ,( necessary In Le o! hostility among the inhabitants they dnve their flocks off to the bills and captures would, as a rule, be difficult. ChicUns and ^s.-Small in size obtainable throughout. Transport. Transport in the Aden Hinterland is practically comprised in the word •1 came s ” Mention will be made of camel-carts being taken to Nobat Dukem, anTt? wouio perhaps n be c ^» ra “4r^ t tl l s r^r^7aced e that grw'di'fficulty was experienced in getting them through the heavy sand great dimci y p^d not be counted at mU ch over one mile per hour Jowari stalks and reeds were strewn on the heaviest parts of the track but the former especially, broke up very much. The ordinary load for a camel was calculated at four maunds. The 'cK&amp;eot hired 6 transport the driver was included m the lure of the camels. [C 57 QM G1B ]34 Compared together it works out— i man. 3 camels. 12 maunds. 2 men. 2 camels. 2 carts. 12 maunds. A convoy arrived at Nobat Dukem on May I2tb, 1903, having occupied 33 hours fora distance (in three stages) of 35 miles. The average pace of the ordinary pack convoy is in fair country 2! miles per hour. The experiment was abandoned. The pack saddle is of a simple, strong, and fairly good pattern. It consists of a wooden tree, the sticks crossing in a V shape at pommel and cantle to which the loads are bound, the body of the saddle covered with sacking or matting, and the pad of grass, included in the same cover underneath the tree. This is the chief disadvantage of the saddle, as it is very difficult to shift the stuffing to remove pressure from a wounded spot, and thus acamel which with a little adjustment of its saddle could be worked without any evil consequences, often becomes hopelessly galled. The native riding saddle is not unlike a rough “ Makhlufa,' Sudan riding sad dle. V shaped sticks at the pommel give a slight grip for the legs. The rider sits frontwise, his legs crossed on the camel’s neck. The majority of the country is wooded, and fuel is obtainable nearly everywhere. In the desert tracts and maritime plain, thorn trees of the acacia family grow in fair profusion. The river-beds are as a rule thickly lined with tamarisk ; date palms are common in the lower valleys to the west, as well as dom palms, which are found in valleys near the coast and in small quantities near the shore. The “ balas,” an edible green fig and various kinds of bastard fig, are common. Juniper trees grow in profusion on ranges towards the south-west and on the Juheli hills. The most useful tree is on the whole the “ ulub,' the Indian “ Ber” tree, which is universal in the cultivated portion. The leaves are used as fodder for camels and domestic animals and the tree is considered as private property. The fruit called “ dom,” a small berry with a stone, not unlike a crab apple, is eaten by the Arabs, and the wood is strong and suited for building. Good camel grazingis afforded by the “ Rak ” (Indian pileu), “ashak' and several varieties of mimosa. Wild animals .—Wild animals have been dealt with in the local reports, but it is worth mentioning that the oryx, which has always been regarded as a mythical inhabitant of the Arabian peninsula, has been brought into Aden from the desert country to the north-east. Wood and trees,35 CHAPTER V. Harbours and Anchorages. In the whole coast-line of the British Protectorate, the harbour of Aden itself is the only one giving shelter to vessels in all weathers. There are, however, various inlets and head lands which afford safe anchorage, under certain conditions of wind and weather, and it is proposed to briefly consider the most important of these, from west to east. Ras al Ara. Ras al ’Ara is a projection 11 miles in width east and ■ west, the centre of which is the southern extreme of Arabia. There is good -anchorage in the small bay westward of Ras al ’Ara affording shelter against the strong winds of the north-east monsoon. I he beach round the bay is somewhat steep. Troops and stores were embarked and disembarked frequently during the months of April and May. In the case of the latter, some difficulty was experienced in rough weather as there is no jetty or convenience for landing. There is a well at Ras 'Ara providing a fairly abundant supply of brackish water, and a ruined tow'er built by the Sultan of Lahej. It is a starting point for the Subehi interior, and by its use a long desert march is avoided (v. routes). Landing was effected without difficulty at ’Uzzaf, in the Ghubbat al Haiki, the bay to the west of the headland. Bandar Imran ,—Bandar Imran, east of Khor’Umera, between the headland of J. Marsa and Ras Imran, forms a bay with a depth of 12 and 13 fathoms at tw^o miles off shore. It affords at its eastern end, under Ras Imran, excellent shelter from easterly winds. Water near the shore fresh at Hiswa Kau, and brackish, at Bir Mukhnuk. Shukra .—The chief port of the Fadli tribe. Anchorage ,—A small harbour for boats, with from one to 2\ fathoms, is formed by a break in the reef which fronts the shore, at a distance of 4 mile. Good anchorage outside the reef with from 7 to 9 fathoms, 4 or 5 cables outside. On landing at Shukra, in February 1896, there w^as a considerable surf on the b^ach, but no difficulty was experienced, transhipment from the ship's, into native, boats being carried out outside the surf-line. The sea was moderately calm at the time. Makatin .— Makatin Saghair, east of Shukra, is a small anchorage for boats, formed by a projecting point 5 miles westward of MakatinT The water is shallow and the bottom rocky. Makatin is an anchorage formed by a slightly projecting rocky point from which four rocky islets and a sunken rock project 21' cables to the southward. It is resorted to by native trading vessels for shelter during the north-east monsoon ; the anchorage is on the western side of the islets, where the water is perfectly smooth, when blowing hard from the north-east. (A rocky patch of three feet lies three cables south by west of the islets, with a 4 fathoms patch at 3 cables south-south-east'of it, another patch of fathoms, lies nearly £ mile east of the outer islet). Ghubbet al Ain and Troops have been landed on several occasions at Balhaf on minor military operations. Between Ras al Ghu- sain and Ras al Aseda, a bay named Ghubbet-al-Ain, is formed, receding 6 miles from a line connecting the two points. On its shores are the {36 v villages of Ain ba M’abad, and Ain-al-Jaweri, the former consisting of a mosque and about 100 huts, the latter of 70 huts. Springs of water, date-trees, and jowari abound. Further eastward is the small fishing vil lage of Jil'a and the anchorage of 3 alhaf, which affords good shelter during easterly winds. Balhaf .—The foreshore is rocky with some sandy patches near Balhaf; to the west, there is a long stretch of sandy shore, and to the east, a rocky promontory runs out into the sea. There is a small sandy bay just beneath the place where the tower stood, partly protected from the surf, where landing would be possible except in the very worst of weather, do the west, the shore is low-lying, rising near Balhaf to small hills at a distance of 500 or too yards, behind which li-e other ridges. Further west, the hills recede from' the shore A mile and a half to the west of Balhaf, is a large mass of rock, called in the Admiralty chart Black Barn, some 200 or 300 feet high, and quite isolated. Immediately to the east of the bay. is the rocky promontory, rising to 50 or 60 feet, close to the shore. An enemy occupying this could greatly annoy any landing party. Surf permitting, a landing could be effected to the west. Ships can lie within 930 yards of the shore in 15 fathoms of water. The stone tower of Ba’.haf and the mat huts were destroyed in 1902. There is indifferent water at Jil 'a. Bindar Husn Ghorab is a small secure, well-sheltered bay immedi ately eastward of the head-land of that name. Bandar Burum \s a. bay, miles wi le, northward of Ras Burum affording a secure anch rage during the south-west monsoon, but is open to easterly and north-east uinds. It is resorted to by shipping from Makalla during the south-west moi soon. The village of Burum with about sro inhabitants has a supply of good water. The best anchorage, in the south west monsoon, is in from 7 to 9 fathoms, but a ground-swell rolls in. Makalla .—Next to Aden, the prnopal commercial town on the south coast of Arabia is partly built on a nar ow projecting rocky point, and partly at the foot of a range of reduisn limestone cliffs rising to a height of about 300 feH to 500 feet immediately behind the town. Anchorage bank of soundings in Makalla bay on which ancho rage may be obtained, extends about £ mile from the shore, near the town, increasing to nearly one mile off Fuwa, a village between Makalla and Burum. A vessel may lie in p mfecc security during the north-east mon soon. A stone jetty opposite the Jamadar's palace, renders landing fairly easy. In case of hostility, a landing might be effected, surf permitting, to the west, or possibly round the comer of Ras Makalla, to the east. During the south-west monsoon, the surf is bad all along this coast. Except near Fuwa, troops would be exposed, when landing, to fire from com manding pcsitions. Water and supplies abundant. The water is about two miles from the town. Bandar Ru'ineni, a north-east of Ras Makalla, has from 4 to 6 fathoms close in shore. Native trading vessels find shelter here during the south-west monsoon. As Shehr, a large town of between 6,000 and 10,000 inhabitants, has an open road-stoad. The best anchorage is in 7 or 8 fathoms, from 7 cables to one mile from the shore. The foreshore is sandy and flat, rising at a distance of about a mile from the shore, to a height of 50 feet, in a ridgei 37 of low sand-hills. During the south-west monsoon there is a good deal of surf, but landing can generally be effected in native boats. As a rule the surf is less in the morning before io A.M. When visited in February, although surf was present, a landing was effected without difficulty, transfer being made to native boats outside the surf belt. Water in the town, 2 bad wells only. Under a mile from the town towards J. Yaculif, at Dafuoja, some 30 wells of fair water. Kishn —Kishn bay is formed by the projecting headlands of Ras Sharwen and Ras Darja, 13 miles apart. The depths are regular, there being 8 to 10 fathoms water nearly two miles from the shore, gradually decreasing towards the beach. During the north-east monsoon, there is a heavy ground swell and a high surf on the beach, which renders landing dangerous except immediately westwards of Ras Darja, where there is a nook in which the small trading boats land their goods. The shore of the bay is low and sandy near the sea, having a high range of hills in the background with a barren tract of undulating sand hills interven ing. The best anchorage is in Bandar Lask, the western part of Kishn Bay, in about 5 fathoms, 4 mile from the shore; here vessels are sheltered from the south-west monsoon and lie in comparatively smooth water. In other parts of the bay, a heavy swell rolls in at that season. Landing was effected during the month of February in native boats without much difficulty. Kishn, a large straggling town, the principal port of the Mahri tribe, and the residence of the Sultan, lies about J mile from the shore. For further detai’s regarding the coast and anchorages generally, the leader is referred to the Red Sea Pilot.38 CHAPTER VI. Communications. Beyond the settlement of Shekh Othman which may be said to be part -of Aden there are no roads, properly speaking, in the Aden Protectorate. There are, however, numerous camel tracks, those on the main caravan lines being, as a rule, in good order, and offering no difficulty to transport. It is perhaps needless to again mention the want of accurate know ledge with regard to the eastern portion of the protectorate. The fact of the Upper Yafa, and much of the lower Yafa country, being unvisited, has already been referred to. The most important routes from a commercial point of view are those communicating with Turkish Yemen to the north and north-west of Aden, as the traffic of the eastern countries is nearly all by routes leading south, to adjacent ports on the sea coast. Group I.—Routes leading North and North-West to Turkish FRONTIER. The three main routes to the Turkish frontier, taken in order from east to west, are— (a) That leading to the Dala valley and thence to Kataba in Turkish Yemen. (f&gt;) That leading by the Tiban valley to Taiz and Mavia. (e) That by Mafalis and the Nakil Hamra to Taiz. In addition, the Turkish frontier can be reached at Ka^aba in the Haiki country, thence to Mokha, either direct from Aden, or more con veniently, by disembarking at Ras al ’ Ara. (a) The first 35 miles from Shekh Othman to Nobat Dukem are the same for (a) and (&amp;). The country traversed is, with the exception of the Lahej oasis, desert. Nobat Dukem may be reached either by Lahej, to which there are three tracks, the centre one passing Bir 'Amr being the most direct or by a more easterly route past Bir Said Ali, and thence, on the left bank of the Wadi as Saghair. This route was the one usually followed by the troops in 1903; two 10 mile stages and one 14 mile stage to Nobat Dukem. In the case of a Brigade marching simultaneously, it would probably be necessary, on account of water, to use the Lahej route as well. These routes converge a little to the south of Zaida, but this would matter the less as there is a sufficiency of water at Nobat Dukem. Camel carts and wheeled artillery (field) were taken as far as Nobat Dukem, but with diffi culty, on account of the stretches of heavy sand. On all routes, heavy going for infantry will be found, but there is noth ing to delay transport. On the Lahej route, crops and irrigation may occasionally narrow the track, and cause slight delay. From Nobat Dukem on there are three main lines of approach to Dala:— 1. The Hardaba route. 2. The Mashwara route. 3. The Tiban valley route. No. 1 from Nobat Dukem 40 miles in 3 stages. This is the most direct and the most generally used. It gives a choice of three passes ti 39 leading up to the Dala valley, up to the foot of which it winds gently up the Selat Hardaba. The passes are, the Nakil Rabad, used for the regular passage of troops and convoys 1902-4, with an ascent of about 800 feet in a mile at a fairly easy gradient. The Nakil Thoba, an ascent of 1000 feet L\ a difl ? Cult , than the Nakil Rabad - but sHghtly more direct. 1 he Nakil Khureba, the pass generally used for caravans to Turkish Yemen. The first portion of the ascent, about 600 feet in h mile is the worst; after this, the remains of an old paved road are met, and the road has been improved by the troops. With the improvement of the lower portion, it would make the best road of the three. It leads direct to the village of Jalila. Water sufficient for a Battalion with transport. _ 2 - The Mashwara route, about the same in point of distance, is more difficult, and water is more scarce. Except as an alternative in case of a large body marching, to economise water on the Hardaba route, it would hardly be used by troops. The Tiban valley route is more circuitous, following the valleys of the Tiban and Tabaghain, and ascending to Dala by the short but some what difficult pass of the Darj an Nishfi. Distance 'from Nobat Dukem 56 miles in 5 stages. ’ 3 During the dry season, the Tiban can be ascended to Karad, whence a fair track branches north-east to Sanah near Kataba, a distance from Nobat Dukem of about 55 miles. [The Boundary Commission marched down the Tiban in December from Sanah, the stages being Karad, Hafasa and Asfal Tusan, where a halt for survey work, etc., was made. The advantage of Tusan as a stage is that a good spring obviates drinkino' the Tiban water. The marching is in the bed of the river, and involves cons tant wading but the only difficult part of the bed is in the gorge above Hafasa. A working party sent on ahead was able to clear away &amp; obstruc tions, and no great difficulty was experienced, nor did any casualties among camels occur. In the event of a storm and consequent freshet, this route (above Hafasa) would be most dangerous.] Fair caravan tracks lead up the Wadis Tusan and Hilhal to Mavia. ^ ^From Dala, the main caravan route runs straight down the valley to Kataba, whence San’a (capital Turkish Yemen) is distant 8 marches via the Nakil Hadda pass, Yarim, Damar and W’alan. { 6 ) From Nobat Dukem, a track, improved sufficiently in 1903, to admit of the passage of field guns, leads up the valley of the Tiban, with the mountains gradually rising higher on either side, for about 11 miles, when the Wadi Akkan joins the Tiban. Up to this point there is plentiful water from the Tiban. The caravan route to Taiz follows the Wadi Akkan to the junction of the Wadis Natid and Hidaba. Here it crosses the upland on the right bank of the Wadi Natid, for about 4^ miles, till it strikes the Wadi again near Hawemi, in which neighbourhood alone, would a plentiful supply of water be found. About 3 miles beyond Hawemi, or roughly 16 miles from the mouth of the Akkan, the Turkish frontier is met. The Natid is followed from the border till nearly up to the Turkish customs-house of Rahda (9 miles beyond the border, in the Badu country). This portion of the route offers no difficulty to transport, but is heavy marching for troops. The field guns were not taken beyond Dar Akkan. In dealing with this route, the pass to the east of the Juheli hills must not be forgotten, the Nakil Madraja; on the south of it there is a barren,roucrh, and waterless stretch of some ao miles between it and the Tiban f but this would offer no difficulty to mounted troops, and the pass gives, access to the flank of the Akkan-Taiz route near the junction of the Hidaba and Akkan Wadis {vide Route No. 7). The caravan route to Mavia is the same as that to Taiz as far as the junction of the Akkan with the Tiban; thence, however, the Tiban is follow ed to the neighbourhood of Musemir where the track crosses a rough and undulating stony plateau much inteisected by nullahs and by the Warezan, in a north-west direction, past the village of Addareja, and up the Wadi to the west of it. The best halting place is the vicinity of the Habil Arabi between the Wadis Ziyak and Reda, where water in plenty is found except in extreme drought; even then the Warezan is only a few miles away. There was an inexhaustible supply in this neighbourhood in January, and though it probably decreases towards April and May, a fair supply is from all accounts always available without having recourse to the Warezan. From this point, a plateau intersected by several deep nullahs, with occasional low hills, leads to the defile of the Nakil Mavia, just beyond the summit of which is the village of Mavia, at a distance of about 25 miles from Musemir. Two fair tracks connect the Akkan-Taiz and the Mavia routes, in the Kafuf-Hawemi line. N. B.— \t is as well to mention here that the best and most plentiful water supply is generally found in small streams flowing in nullahs for a mile or so. Their course is, however, very capricious, and a stream which has been flowing abundantly for several years may suddenly dis appear. It would therefore be far from wise to trust implicitly to any but the most recent report without further investigation. The same remark applies to wells. (c) The caravan route to Mafalis direct from Aden, vid Bir Ahmad, Bir Fadl, Am Rija and the Wadi Ma’din presents long and trying stretches of desert in the first stages. It was used by the troops support ing the Commission in the Subehi country, in the spring of 1904. The water-supply till the stream in the Wadi Ma’din is reached at Kuhlan, is brackish and scanty, and would not suffice for more than \ battalion with transport under present conditions, but even then great economy must be exercised. Five stages to Kuhlan. Water must be carried between Bir Fadl and Am Rija. Distance fromShekh Othman to Kuhlan about 50 miles. Alternative route, slightly longer, but better going and water, by disembarking at Ras al 'Ara and thence by Turan, Mu’ammaria and Am Fajra to the Wadi Ma’din. transport could be marched out by coast road from Aden to Ras al’Ara. Abundant and good stream water at Kuhlan, whence short stage of about 5 miles to Mafalis. Easiest route for transport, by the Wadi Ma’din which is, however, much commanded between Sanawi and Mafalis. In case of hostilities, best route by the Nijd Rifad pass, heights of J. Kawa and J. Nabat being held. They are, however, commanded, though not at close range, by mountains on opposite (right) bank of the Wadi Ma’din. Lateral tracks exist connecting {£&gt;) and (c). (1) From the Nakil Madraja by Mulehia, Dar Murshid Nasir and Am Farsha to Kuhlan. Passed by the Boundary Commission (about 400 men and 400 animals) in February. Water was sufficient except at DarMurshidi ■ f 1 f -r-* 4 ^ Nasir, for which stage it must be carried. A rough road for transport and commanded almost throughout. 2. From Nobat Dukem to Dar al Kudaimi via Habil and Am Rija. Sandy with waterless stretch of 20 miles between Habil and Am Rija. 3 * Tracks from Lahej and Hait al Lim to Am Rija vid Am Shaibi. Sandv wirh waterless 15 mile stretch between the Wadi al Kabir and Am Shaibi Between (c) and the sea, the track to Ras al ' Ara from Dar a! Kudaimi, already mentioned ; an »ther route further to tie north from Am Fajra to Dar Salim ba I habit. Am Mijza and Mudariba, whence the Wadi Turan rr,ay either be followed to Turan, and Ras al’Ara, or another route taken crossing the Wadis Bitan and Kaluli, via. Ghail Barbar to Turan. Neither difficult for transport but the Wadi Turan route easiest and most direct. Water sufficient for 300 men and 300 animals was found throughout in April and May. The last-named route follows the line of the Turkish border. A track from Ghail Barbar leads in 3 easy stages to Karaba in the Haiki (Turkish) country whence laden camels pass to Moza’ and thence to Mokha. Group II.— Routes leading to the north. Our knowledge of these routes is very imperfect, Rube'aten being the most northerly point to which any British expedition has penetrated in the Yafa country, while in the Lower Yafa, Al Kara marks the furthest limit of exploration northward’s. Rube’aten was reached in four marches from Dala. The first, across the Dala plain to Khalla, a Muflahai village in the angle between J. Harir and the Shaibi mountains, an easy march; the second, to Awabil in the Shaibi country involving the ascent of three passes, causing much delay and very trying to transport; the third, a descent to the Bana River by the Wadi Bakhal; and the fourth, the ascent of a very difficult pass, the Nakil Sehan, rising nearly 3,000 feet. Some lightly laden camels w’ere taken up with great difficulty, but the pass can only be said to be fit for mule transport Water was plentiful throughout. An easier pass exists, the Nakil Yahamis ; it is however longer. Any extended reconnaissance was impossible on account of the threatened hostility of the Yafa’i. The main routes to the Yafa (Upper) country are by all accounts difficult. They necessitate the ascent of the Bana which can be reached f:©m Dala by the pass, the Nakil Set, between J. Harir and J. Halmin, and the turning off up the Wadi Hatib or the Selat Sih. Al Kara, the capital of the Lower Yafa country is about 90 miles distant from Aden. The most direct route is by Imad, Bir Mijhar and Al Husn to the the mouth of the Wadi Hatat, which is ascended as far as the Maskaba pass, whence the Wadi am Haddara leads to al Kara. The road contains several bad places for transport including the Nakil Maska ba, an ascent of about 2,000 feet. Al Kara can also be reached from Jimil in the ’Alawi country, and from the Yeramis valley vid the Wadi Silib but no details as to these routes are available. Group III. —Routes in the eastern portion of the protec torate. Those traversed are few in number, including from Aden to Loder to Ansab via, Shukra, and to Ansab via, Makatin. They were carried [C57QMGIB] F42 out by small parties so that it is exceedingly difficult to gauge their resources as far as troops are concerned. From the reports furnished, how ever, it appears that water is scanty and bad, and that they are unsuited to the passage of other than small parties. Details will be found in routes Nos. 20 to 23. Railway communications. There are no railway communications. A scheme has been discussed for laying a light railway to the Turkish frontier, and the mercantile com munity of Aden are anxious for it. So far it has got no further than the proposal stage, and it is doubtful if it would at all repay the cost of con struction. The Tiban valley was suggested as a suitable line, but this was reported unfavourably on by the Field Engineer with the Aden Column as it would involve the construction of several bridges, any project of taking the line along the river-bed being impossible in view of “ wash outs'. Maritime communications. On maritime communications with Aden it is unnecessary to say much. All the principal lines from England to India call there. For traffic with the local ports, an Indian Marine ship of the “ Dalhousie M class is alw r ays stationed there, and there are several small coasting steamers belonging to Messrs. Cowasji Dinshaw of Aden (3) and to the Perim Coal Company (2) capable of carrying from 100 to 200 troops, which can be chartered in case of necessity. These were used both for traffic during the Somaliland campaign, and for taking the troops supporting the Com mission to Aden from Ras al 'Ara. There are no inland water communications. Telegraph and signalling. A Field telegraph was laid from Aden to Dala during the work of the Boundary Commission. So much trouble was caused by the constant cutting of the line, chiefly by the Kotaibi tribe, between Nobat Dukem and Dala, that this portion of the line was rolled up in July 1903. Signallin 0- communication was established between Dala and Nobat Dukem by an intermediate party camped on Dubiyat, whence J. Shamsan at Aden is visible in clear weather. Much interruption was caused, especially during the winter months, by the mists. In the Subehi country signalling commu^ jnication with Aden was also maintained by a connecting station on Jabalain from the Ma din valley. In most parts of the country, in which troops were operating, it would nearly always be possible to establish good connecting stations, although convenience of signalling might not always coincide with blve't™ be detailed? etC '’ ^ large en ° USh t0 reS ‘ St attacks - mi S htCHAPTER VII. Fortresses. Of fortresses, properly speaking, in the interior, there cire norte, but toearly all Arab villages in the mountains consist of solidly built stone towers, almost invariably placed in commanding positions, and necessitat ing destruction by artillery or demolition by gun-cotton.* The towers are invariably loop-holed for musketry and if stubbornly held, an attack without artillery would prove costly. They are generally square in shape and sometimes {eg, the Haushabi Sultan’s guard-tower at Minjara) so built as to provide flanking fire on the door. They are usually 2 or 3 storeys in height with a flat roof surrounded by a low parapet. A few well- placed shell from a 10-pr. mountain gun were sufficient to demolish those fired at. At 500 yards the shell frequently passed through without domg much damage and the effect seemed better at 1,000 yards range. The villages are not surrounded by walls, but the erection of sangars would quickly convert them into positions impossible to assault by infantry unsupported by artillery. Villages in the plain such as Anad on the lower Tiban are occasionally strengthened by a mud wall. The coast towns of Makalla and Shehr areTortified chiefly against attacks from Bedouins from the land side, and are extremely vulnerable against artillery fire from the sea. ... Makalla.—There are three forts on the sea level, semi-circular in shape, and built of stone. Several guns S. B., principally 12-pounder, are mounted in each. They are very antiquated. In 1902, the limits of the town had just been extended, the west gate being beyond the New Palace, and a new gate-way having been erected. A wall, some 20 feet high and 10 feet thick, was in course of erection, from the barracks to the hill below watch-tower No. 3, and the hill had been scarped at its point of junction. On the cliffs above Makalla, are six watch towers for protection against Bedouins, solidly built of stone. The three forts A, B, and C, have respectively 6 , 4, and 3, emplacements visible from the sea and in forts A, and B, all seem to be occupied by guns. Fort C could not be seen distinctly owing to distance. Forts A and B command the landing at Makalla, and even with old guns their fire at so short a range would be very deadly against boats. The buildings in the town are from 3 to 4 storeys high, and would lend themselves to street fighting. As Shehr —Is surrounded on the land side by a wall, about 20 feet high, with towers at frequent intervals; average distance between about 150 yards. They are about 30 feet high and 40 feet in breadth. There are 5 gates ; 2 large ones, one in the west wall and one in the north wall, and three small ones, at north-west and north-east corners of the wall, and in the east wall. All these gates are surmounted by fortified gate- ^ The sea-shore is quite open with no attempt at fortification. The wall seems to be of sundried bricks, but at each end, where it joins the sea, a very solid circular tower of stone is built into the sea, far enough to prevent it being passed even at low tide. These are joi ned by a heavy stone wal l * lbs. gun-cotton was the usual charge for an average tower. In ill-built towers where good tamping was possible 20 to 25 lbs. sufficed, and in the case of two or three extra large towers So to 60 lbs. was used.to the rest of the wall. They have some gun emplacements, and probably mount some 12-pounder S. B. guns, of which there are some in the town In the centre of the town stands a square fort. It has two doors on the sea-ward side, the walls are loop-holed and the top of the wall crenelated. It is about 100 yards square and 30 feet high, very solid in appearance, and built of stone, either sand-stone or granite. The houses are some 3 or 4 storeys in height, more scattered than the buildings in Makalla. but effectively situated for the defence of the town against a landing party. The citv of Shibamin the interior of the Hadramaut, is also described as being surrounded by a mud-brick wall with watch-towers at intervals but no details are available.CHAPTER VIII. History. v The early history of Aden, and the districts now forming the British Protectorate, is inextricably connected with that of the remainder of the pro vince ol Yemen, and involves a long series of conquest and counter-conquest. It would be beside the purpose of a military report to more than touch very briefly on the reasons that prompied the annexation of Aden, and the consequent relations with the tribes of the interior. It is worth noting hovyever, that the Turks originally captured Aden in 1538, as a base to assist them in their operations against the Portuguese and that except fora short interval, when it was taken by the Portuguese, they remained in possession of it till their evacuation of Yemen in 1630, when the province fell under the domination of the Imams of San’a. This explains to some extent the mental attitude of the Turks, throughout, in dealing with ques tions concerning southern Yemen, for, although officially recognising the claim of the British to Aden and certain districts of Yemen, they yet, in their inmost hearts, look on British occupation of these tracts, as an infringe ment of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, and there is little doubt th^ t this feeling has affected their policy to as recent a date as the present delimitation of the boundaries of the respective empires. It is also interesting to note the connection of several of the indepen dent rulers of districts in the British sphere of influence, with the Imams of San’a; the Sultans of the Abdali (Lahej) and Haushabi, the Amir of Dala, and the Aulaki Sultans, were all formerly “ Wakils ” or viceroys of the Imam, till, on the decline of his power, they declared their indepen dence. (In the case of the Abdali in 1728.) 1 he lower Yafa’i were also under the domination of the Imam. British interest in the Red Sea and Arabian ports had already manifested itself for some 200 years, when, towards the beginning of the 19th century, the need for the more efficient protection of shipping, and of a coaling dep6t and port of call, made itself more acutely felt. Aden was at this time in the possession of the Abdali Sultan; its former commercial importance had greatly declined, and its population numbered less l829 than a thousand. In 1829, some coal was landed on Sira island, Aden, for the use of the “Hugh Lindsay”, the first steamer built in India, but as labour was unobtainable, Makalla was adopted as a coaling station instead. l8 6 In 1836, the ship “ Deria Doulat, - ' sailing under British colours, was wrecked in the Ghubbet Selan, the wreck was plundered, and the passengers subjected to brutalities by Arabs from Aden. In order to obtain redress and to prevent the recurrence of similar outrages, Captain Haines, I.N., afterwards the first Resident, was despatched to Aden by the Bombay Government, to obtain reparation, and to endeavour to secure the place by purchase. A portion of the indemnity required was obtained, and a bond granted by the Sultan to the effect that he would cede the place to the British, in March 1839, against an annual pension of 8,700 dollars. i 839 *—The treachery of the Arabs, however, rendered further 1839. negotiations abortive and in consequence of this and further evidences of bad faith, on the i6th January 1839, H.M S. ‘‘ Volage” (28 guns) and46 H. M. S. “ Cruizer ’* (10 guns), with 300 European and 400 native troops, arrived at Aden, and, after sending a final message to the Sultan to deliver up the place, bombarded it and took it by assault, with a loss to the British of 15, and to the Arabs of 150 men. The garrison had consisted of 7oo soldiers from the interior. The Sultan and his family fled to Lahej. The first step of the Resident, Captain Haines, was to throw up temporary fortifications against a sudden attack, and to keep the tribes quiet till his position was secure. Before the end of January, he had con cluded a treaty of peace and friendship with the ’Azaiba, a branch of the Abdali who maintained consistent friendship wdth the British, and during the next month, similar agreements were entered into with the Akrabi, Subehi, Fadli, Yafa’i, Amiri, and Sharjabi (the last-named, a tribe now well within the Turkish border). The population soon began to increase, and little more than a year after the first capture, it had risen to 4 600. From the very first, it became evident that the occupation of Aden itself would be of little use unless a good understanding were arrived at with the neighbouring tribes, as in their hands lay the power of interfer ing with the land-borne trade, and the supplies on which the town w'as, in those early days, so largely dependent* The first years shew a turbulent record with a good deal of fighting, though as regards the British, not of a very deadly kind. The Abdali Chief had been paid a sum of 541 dollars, the first instalment of the purchase stipend originally agreed on, but no later than November 1839, he made his first attempt to retake Aden, in conjunction with the Chief of the Fadli. The attack was repulsed with a loss to the Arabs of 200 killed and wounded. The Abdali's stipend was stopped, and the Fadli coast, and port of Shukra, blockaded. A second attempt by tribes in the pay of the Abdali Sultan in May 1840 was no more successful, and th6 l8 ‘ 10 ' Arabs suffered heavy loss. A third attempt was made in July 1841. by about 5,000 Arabs. They were met by the fire of gunboats anchored 1 A * near the Isthmus position, and the fire from the works completing their discomfiture, they retired with a loss of 300 men. The Abdali and Fadli, who w'ere principally concerned in this attack, then established a post called Nobat Shekh Mahdi, not many miles from the Barrier Gate of Aden, whence they commenced a series of outrages on traders and others bringing supplies, which culminated in an attack by a column of 200 British and 300 native soldiers on the fort. Its destruction w r as successfully accomplished with the loss of one man by sun-stroke, and one officer and 4 men wounded. The force, on their return journey to Aden, proceeded to Shekh Othman and demolished the fort there. Both the Abdali and the Fadli Sultan subsequently made friendly overtures. In 1844 the Abdali’s stipend, wdth a year's back-pay in consideration of his improved behaviour, was restored to him, and he was required to sign a more stringent agreement. in August 1846, a fanatic, named Sayid Ismail, having preached a Jehad in Mecca, and making his way by slow stages, gathered recruits, till on his 1844. 1846.^-r 47 arny.il at Lahej, his force mustered some 2,000 men. Here he was joined by a body of the same number, chiefly from the Abdali and Fadli and his force was entertained by the Abdali Sultan and others. An abortive attach on the Aden works was made, and the Sayid having unfortunately promised his adherents invulnerability and failed to insure it, his following melted away, and he retired with the Fadli Sultan, who, again evincing a disposition to give trouble, found his coast blockaded. &amp; 0 In 1847 , a large force of Aulaki invaded Lahej, and only retired on 1847. t ^ ie payment by the Sultan of some 3,‘too dollars. 1849. I o 49 &gt; a fresh commercial treaty was , concluded with the Sultan of the Abdali. The Turks in 1850 despatched a force of some 300 regulars and &gt;850-54. 5 °° other armed men to annex the ... j / , i , P or ^ s Makalla and Shehr. The natives, combining, defeated them at Burum with considerable loss The years from 1850 to 1854 were marked by a series of atrocities in which the Akrabi were chiefly involved, and for which their port of Bir Ahmad was blockaded. The most serious of these was an attack on a party of four British officers by a fanatic, at Waht, near Lahej, which resulted in the death of one and injuries to two others. The murderer was given an asylum in Fadli territory, and the stipend of the Sultan was stopped in consequence. rr I n i 855 &gt; the Fadli Sultan made his peace, and the blockade on the 1855. port of Shukra was removed. A treaty was f * . . made with the Lower Aulaki for the pre vention of the importation of slaves. ,856. i8 5 6 was marked by bad relations between the Abdali and the Fadli. The following year, both the Fadli and the Akrabi tendered their 1857. submission, and relations with the neigh- f ^ , louring tribes were on a much more satisfactory footing. The Sultan of the Abdali, Ali Mohsin, however an intriguing man, whose chief aim had been to foment trouble with other tribes, and to pose as a go-between with the British Government, finding that matters were altogether too peaceful for his taste, began to caus? serious annoyance, first by imposing extortionate tolls, and later by plundering caravans. J It was therefore found necessary in March 185S to organise an 1858. expedition against Shekh OthmanT A force of infantry and artillery, together with some seamen, proceeded against the place, and were opposed by some 500 Arabs whom they succeeded in putting to flight, and the fort of Shekh Othman was blown up without a single British casualty, and with a loss of about 30 to the Arabs. The next few years were devoid of any important incident, but 1863. in i86 3 &gt; a treaty was signed with the . . . Nakibs of Makalla, and Shehr, abolishing the slave trade in their dominions.i866.

The year 1873 is an important one in the history of the Protec- Ihe year 73 i orat e, as Turkish aggression from the * 873 - north, then first made itself distinctly felt, of “ opportunity ^in'tle^conftlon 1 which “prUiLd after the evacuation of Yemen by the Egyptians in 1840.

The Haushabi Sultan aggrieved at £.s «v«ses aMhe hands of the Abdali, and in temporary d.sgrace with the British author, ties intrigued with the Turkish Governor at Taiz, and was successful in inducing a Turkish force to advance to the frontiers of Lahe].49 Representations were at once made to the Porte by Her Majesty's Government, and the immediate withdrawal of the Turkish troops was promised. I he promise was, however, not carried out, and, at the insti- gahon of an intriguing brother of the Abdali Sultan, a Turkish force actually occupied h.s fortified house at A1 Hauta, the capital of tne I ahei Gountry. 1 he Resident, on this, with a force of artillery, infantry, and cavalry, occupied the Lahej district, but the Turks did not withdraw till December of the same year. A Turkish force also marched through the Alawi country, and compelled the head Shekh who had refused his alle- g.ance to the I urk.sh authorities at Taiz, to surrender his son as a hos- tfl 6 ' u atter WaS eventuall y Pleased on the representations of the iontish Government. In this year also occurred the Turkish occupation of Data, which practicaliy continued in a greater or lesser degree till the evacuation J al ' la In 1903. lurkish encroachment, although subsequently making itself felt to some extent all along the boundary has always been particularly active in the Amiri country, ft is, however, ig tne ••nine tribes' informed the Porte that Her Maiesty’s Government could not view with indifference any Turkish interference with them. It was followed in 1874 by a further despatch from Lord Derby strongly deprecatmg any interference by Turkish officials with stipendiary chiefs. 1 he Porte replied that the Governor-General of Yemen had been instructed to prevent any such interference. In 1876 the Resident concluded a treaty with the Sultan of Kishn and 1876. Sokotra by the terms of which the Sultan, in , . , . , , consideration of a payment of 3,000 dollars and a yearly subsidy of $ 360, bound himself not to cede the island or any of its dependencies to any power but Great Britain. Proposals for such a treaty had been mooted as early as 1835, but the conclusion of the trea.y m 1876 was motived by the advance of the Egyptians along the Islami 1 and ^ thG recent visit of a Turkish training ship to the During succeeding years no military operations on any considerable scale were necessary, but continual broils among the various tribes cou- i88 I# stantly called for the intervention of the ’ . British authorities. In the year 1881 the Kotaibi first began to give trouble by exacting dues on the Hardaba route. In the same year an agreement, termed the “ Subehi agreement ' was entered into with the Sultan of Lahej, by which he undertook to make himself responsible for the gold behaviour of the Subehi sub-tribes whose stipends had been stopped the previous year cn account of outrages on the roads, in consideration of their stipends being paid to him A truce of a m° re lasting nature was concluded, by the intervention of the Resident, between the Abdali and the Haushabi. In the course of the following year the Abdali Sultan made an expe dition into the Subehi country, and compell- 1882. ec I the submission of the majority of the sub- , . . . . tribes : he established small garrisons of nis soldiers in various places in fortified towers. u- S1 ? ekh 0thman and ,a nds in the vicinity, a portion of which had already been obtained in 1878, were finally secured by [C57Q.MGIB] G5 ° purchase from the Abdali. 25,000 dollars being paid, and the subsidy of the Sultan being increased to 1,641 dollars per month. The political condition of the ports of Makalla and Shehr had for several years caused considerable trouble to the British authorities— fighting for the possession of the ports, necessitating the frequent des patch of ships of war from Aden, had been of constant occurrence be tween the Kasadi, Kathiri and Ka'iti, tribes. The situation was still further complicated bv financial transactions between the belligerents, vhich rendered adjustment doubly difficult, and by the possibility of the Turks seizing the opportunity of internal troubles to gain a footing there, in ib&amp;2 thesituat.on culminated in the victory of the Ka’iii. and the British Government executed a treaty with their chief, the Jamadar of Shehr and Makalla, by which the latter bound himself not to cede the ports of Shehr, Makalla or Durum or their dependencies to any power hut the British, nor to acknowledge the superioTty of any other power without the consent of the British Government. In consideiation of this he received an annual stipend of 360 dollars. He also paid into the hands of the Resident a sum of 100,000 dollars for the maintenance of the Ka adi ex- i\ai&gt;ib of Makaila. 1 he year 1883 was marked by host lities between the Fadli and Aulaki tribes, duiing which the latter i?53 ‘ invaded Fadli territory. The Lower Yafa’i, who appeared at one time likely to join in the feud, were prevailed upon by the British authorities to maintain an attitude ot neutrality. In iS«4 it was found necessary to support the Amir of Dala against the Kotaibi. 50 sabres of the Aden troop l88 ‘ , • and a few sappers were despatched against them and a few towers destroyed. The Ko^aibi then tendeied their sub mission to the Amir. It is interesting to note the difference in strength of the force then employed and that necessary 20 years later. In 1886, an additional treaty was concluded with the Sultan of Kishn and Sokotra, whereby the island and its ,886 ' dependencies were formally placed under British protection. The Resident proceeded to Sokotra in person, the Union Jack was hoisted at Tamrida and a salute of 21 guns fired. The “ Subehi agreement ” with the Sultan of Lahej had for several years proved unsatisfactory. The Sultan had shewn a disposition to evade his obligations and in point of fact was not powerful enough to keep the turbulent Subehi in order. In 1886 he intimated his wish to withdraw from it and reported that one of his garrisons had been put to death and others were surrounded by the Subehi. He was accordingly lent rifles and ammunition, and, assisted by 50 sabres of the Aden Troop, was able to extricate the garrisons. The agreement having become inoperative the stipends were paid direct as heretofore. Into the events of the next few years it is unnecessary to enter too closely : they were characterised by frequent intertribal hostilities, which at times necessitated the intervention of the British authorities ; but military expeditions of any importance were in no case necessary. In 1888, in pursuance of a proposal made by Lord Dufferin, that Protec torate Treaties should be entered into with 18 ’ all the coast-tribes from Shekh Said to Groan treaties of this nature were concluded with the Wahidi Sultans ofS' Ralhaf and Bir Ali, thf* Lower Aulaki, tl»e Shekhs of Lower Haura and Irka, the Mahri, the Akrabi and the Fadli. In the following year similar engagements were entered into with QQ the Atiti and Baihimi Subehi lOoQ. The conduct of the Wahidi Sultan of Balhalf, necessitated the despatch g of a man-of-war and a detachment of Native 94 ' Infantry to Balhalf. The Sultan was cap- tured without resistance and for some time detained in Aden. In the same year bad blood, between the Abdali and the Haushabi, cul minated in hostilities of a somewhat serious nature. The Abdali were victorious. In the year 1900, trouble occurred on the northern Haushabi boundary between the Turkish tribe of Humar, and the Haushabi. The representative of Tur kish authority in those regions at that time, was an Arab of Humar origin, by name Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, an astute, but intriguing and danger ous man. As well as possessing very considerable influence with the Turks, he had come to an understanding with the Abdali Sultan, still, though not Of enlv, on bad terms with the Haushabi, to divert caravan traffic from Haushabi territory by the erection of towers at certain points. This arrangement fell through, but in the early part of 19 o, Muhammad Nasir erected a tow r er at Kafuf about two miles to the north-west of the village of Addareja, and well within Haushabi limits, from which he and his Humars were able to cause considerable annoyance to the Haushabi. Representation to the Turkish autliorities produced promises of evacuation but no action. Lighting ensued, but the Haushabi were unable to turn out the Humar unaided, and in July igoi, a British force consisting cf 200 of the West Kent Regiment, 200 cf the 5th Bombay Light Infantry, a camel battery of 7-pounder guns, and a pe centage of sapp-rs and Aden Troop, were despatched under Major Rowe of the West Kent Regiment to eject them. In the meantime v uhammad Nasir, by misrepresentations to the Turkish authorities at Taiz, that the British force was intended to commit a wanton aggression on Turkish territory, induced them to despatch a force of 400 men, w ho proceeded to Kafuf and occupied the tow f er. On the arrival of the British force, the heights near the village of Addareja were found to be occupied by the Humar. They were attacked and put to flight and the at tack was then directed on the tower which was mainly defended by the Turks. When night fell, the Turks w'ere still in possession of the tower, but they evacuated it during the night, leaving 5 dead on the ground and 8 prisoners. Their total casualties were estimated at 40. The British force lost four killed and 5 wounded. As a consequence of this contretemps, the Porte who had previously rejected offers of demarcation of the fron- tier, themselves proposed it. The offer was accepted, and in January 1902 the British Commissioners proceeded to Dala, the portion of the boundary which I9 ° 2, seemed to promise the most difficulty. The first meeting with the Turkish Commissioners took place soon after. The history of the early proceedings of the International Commission is fully given in the report on Dala, and it is not proposed to do more than give a short account of the military operations which took place in the ensuing5 2 year. A further expedition to Balhaf was necessary and the tower there destroyed. During 1902 negotiations with the Turkish Commissioners proceeded , 903i bu t slowly owing to Turkish obstruction, and at the beginning of 1903, matters were little more advanced than they had been a year before The escort of the British Commission had originally been a double company of Native Infantry, but owing to the demeanour of the Turks who were still occupy ing Jalila, a village in Amiri territory, within 3 miles of the town of Dala, it was found necessary to exert pressure, and in January 1903, a column was despatched to Dala consisting of some 300 British, and 200 native soldiers. 1 his was still further strengthened, in the ensuing month, till in March, there was present a force of 700 British Infantry, 860 Native Infantry and 8 mountain guns (Abbotabad Mountain Battery and section camel q prs. with details No. 45 Company, Royal Garrison Artillery) or a total of 2,200 fighting men. No. 6 British Mountain Battery arrived soon after, and 2 ciuisers from the Mediterranean squadron were despatched to Aden to hold themselves in readiness. A force of 400 British and Native Infantry and 4 gm s (two 9-pr, field guns and two 7 pr. camel guns) occupied Dar Akkan, a post commanding the Tiban valley route. Towards the end of March, the l urks received orders from the Porte to evacuate Jalila and to retire to Kataba ; the British Commission followed them to Sanah, an Amiri village some 2 miles from Kataba and in these places they remained till, the end of the year. The only tribes who had shewn any disposition to give trouble were the A 1 Ajud oi the Radfan range. In May 1903, the Ahl Abdalla attacked a convoy on its way to Dala, and killed an Arab belonging to it. It was necessary to teach them a lesson and a column consisting of 200 British and Native Infantry with 4 guns of No. 6 Mountain Battery, the whole under Major Dowell, R. G. A., was despatched from Dala on the fjtli Mav. Un the 20th, tribesmen of the,Bakri and Mahlai sections collected on the heights round the British camp in the Rabwa valley, and made a hostile demonstration. Some firing ensued, and the Arabs were dis persed by artillety and rifle fire. Two British soldiers were wounded ihe column subsequently proceeded to the village of Dabra belong mg to the Ahl Abdalla, the original aggressors, wTere 3 towers were blown up with gun-cotton, and a fourth demolished by artillery fire. This w^as the first occasion on which the new iopr. B.L. mountain gun was fired onfield service. 1 he column returned to Dala on the 25th May. The Abbottabad ieft'at 1 Aden attGr ^ retUrned t0 India in J une &gt; their guns (8 pr M. L.) being In September, a survey party from the Boundary Commission was sent to carry out work in the Shaibi country, and in the district of Rube’aten With an escort of 200 British and Native Infantry with maxim and section of No. 6 Mountain Battery, under Major Delamain, 123rd Outranks Onthe h i d at th6 Vi!,a ' e ° f AwabiI on the ,st instant - n the 4th instant, while a native surveyor, with a strong escort was at work rear the v.llage of Hadara (Rabat section ol Shaibi) a g pa«y o Arab To o that village opened fire on the party, killing ,he native surveyor and f 8 a ( ? epo o„ The fire was reUn«d and reinforcements being sent f ont camp the village of Hadara was shelled and the principal towe-s subsequently blown up with gun-cotton. The survey party, with Major53 Delamain’s column, moved on to Rube'aten on the gth September, their place at Awabil being taken by a column under Captain Shewed, 123rd Outram’s Rifles, of 200 British and Native Infantry and a section of 7-pr. camel guns. I he pos tion consisted of a tower and perimeter camp surround ed by a stone wall and was a sufficiently formidable objective to any force unprovided with artillery. During the previous months, negotiations for the conclusion of a treaty between Sultan Kahtan of the Upper Yafa'i and the British Govern ment, had been in progress. A brother of Kahtan's, Salih bin ‘ Umr, had formerly been in receipt of a stipend from the Turks, which had been discontinued in consequence of the Delimitation proceedings. Salih had also put himself out of court by his recent conduct, so far as any expecta tion of inclusion in the treaty was concernerl. He was in consequence in a discontented frame of mind, and ripe for any mischief. The movement of the Biitish towards Rube’ aten gave him the opportunity for which he had been waiting, and assembling some 2,000 of his adherents in Yafa he moved dowm towards the Bana. Uncertain at fiist which force to attack, he finally decided in favour of Aw’abil camp, and on the morning of the 13th September, attacked it with a force of some 5°o riflemen, a heavy storm on the preceding night having soaked his followers and put most of his matchlock-men out of action The attack commenced at 7 A.M. and at 2 p.m the Arabs after some heavy firing, ictired witti a loss estimated at 20 killed and more wounded. Six dea l were left on the ground near the camp. The British casualties were 1 killed and 5 wounded. 1 he Yafa’i retired to their country in some confusion, carrying with them most of their dead and severely wounded. On the following day a re.nforcement consisting of 300 British Infantty and 2 sectons of No. 6 Mountain Battery, under the General Officer Com manding, arrived at Awabil. There were no further hostilities and the survey party and escort rejoining on the 16th, the force returned to Dala in 3 dt-tachments. The Danbari tribe, of the Radfan group, shortly afterwards began to make trouble on the line of communications, robbing caravans and murder ing wayfarers, and finally looting the dak between A 1 Milah and Nobat Dukem. A column under Lieutenant-Colonel English consisting of 200 British and ico native infantry, with 1 section, No 6 Mountain Batter , and 1 section, 45 Company, Royal Garrison Artillery, with 8-pT. guns on camels, were despatched against the marauders’ village of Nakhlen in the Danbari country. While proceeding up the valley in which Nakhlen was situated, the force was exposed to a sniping fire from the tribesmen, who w'ere kept at a distance by the British fire. I he village being reached, several towers and fields of crops were destroyed and the force retired. The tribesmen, however, followed up with some boldness, and succeeded in getting within close range of the rear-guard, a course which necessitated the taking up of successive rear-guard positions ; some biisk firing ensued till the entrance of the vallev was reached, beyond which the enemy did not venture. The British casualties were, fighting men, killed 1 (Royal Dublin Fusiliers), wounded 5. Followers, wounded 2. The Dublin Fusil iers, who were due for embarkation, did not return to Dala, but proceeded straight to Aden. The Kotaibi tribe had become increasingly troublesome on the road ; both by interfering with the field telegraph till it was removed a few months54 previously, and by looting caravans and forcibly Exacting tolls from wayfarers on the Habilen,a plain between Jiml and Hardaba not far from the entrance to their country. A post had accordingly been placed at Sulek, at the junction of the Rabvva and Hardaba valleys garrisoned by 70 men of the 102nd Gre nadiers under Captain Lloyd-Jones, and information obtained there pointed to the probability of the Kotaibi shortly taking the field. At the end of October, they ambushed the mail near Hardaba post, killing the two sowars escorting it and looting the mail-bags. Almost immediately after, they surrounded the post of Sulek in fore?, maintaining a galling fire from surrounding hills. A force of 300 British and Native Infantry and 2 guns, No. 6 Mountain Battery, under Colonel Scallon, left Dala on the night of the '23th and on the following morning joined by a section of 8-pr. guns from Nobat Dukem, attacked the Kotaibi and succeeded in dislodging them from the near est hills. Captain Lloyd-Jones was severely wounded during the day. A further force arrived that day from Dala under the General Officer Com manding, a section of No. 6 Mountain Battery and an additional 150 Hants marched in from Nob it Dukem and all tension was removed. On the succeeding days fighting in the vicinity of Sulek continued and on the 1st November, a force consisting of some 550 British and native infantry, and 4 guns, advanced into Kotaibi territory and occupied the villao-e of Kariati. The next days were spent in destroying many towers in the Mazra valley, and 200 Buffs with a section of 8-pr. guns having arrived (bringing the total guns to 10 ), an advance was made up the Bujer valley the villages of Saman, Liima, and Dil Hajera, occupied, and many towers destroyed. On the 12th the troops withdrew from the Shekh’s village, Dil Hajera, which had been destroyed ; the enemy who had continued to resist till the occupation of that place, had evidently received a severe lesson and caused no trouble during the retirement. The troops returned to Dala on the 15th November, a strengthened garrison being left at Sulek. The British casualties during the operations were 10 killed or mortally wounded. Wounded 21 (including 2 British and 1 native officers). The enemies* casualties were estimated at 200 killed and wounded, but, owing to the rugged nature of the country which enabled the Arabs to carry off their dead, a practice which they never neglect if possible, it was difficult to ascertain with any exactitude. Although the Kotaihi Shekh did not tender his submission at the time the results were very satisfactory. Any reverse might well have had a serious effect, as the garrison at Dala had been necessarily dangerously reduced, and turbulent tribes who would immediately have joined** in had any ^ serious check been experienced, were not wanting. No further hostilities occurred during the remainder of the year. Treaties were concluded by the Resident with Sultan Kahtan the Nakibs of the Mausata, and the Dube section of Upper Yafa’i. * On the 16th December, the Boundary Commission having come to an agreement with the Turks respecting the Amiri boundary, marched by the T iban route to the Haushabi country, the majority of the garrison at Dala being withdrawn to Musemir. in January 1904, a survey party with a small escort was despatched to the Aulaki country by the Resident. They encountered hostility from the tribesmen near Loder who fired on the camp. A native surveyor was shot dead and a khalassi wounded. The party returned to Aden. , k e gp ni d n 2 of February, the Boundary Commission entered the Subehi country. Several outrages had been committed by this tribe.afcrfl'! 55 near Nobat Dukem, and their temper was somewhat uncertain. A strong supporting column was left by the General Officer Commanding, at Muse um- in the Haushabi country, and a further column consisting of 600 British and Native Infantry with 2 guns, despatched to Khatibia in i934 the Subehi country to await the Commis sion. The Shekhs were, however, uni formly friendly. Some shots were fired on the first day of entering the country at a well-piquet, by some irresponsible tribesmen, who were put to flight by fire from the Commission escort, and the passage of the Am Fidna pass near Am Farsha by the Boundary Commission was contested by a small unruly section of the Ahl Heh, numbering about 40 men. Some delay was caused in dislodging them, and a certain amount of powder burnt with no casualties to the British and about 5 to the Arabs. The villages of Dar Ibrahim and Dar Imad were destroyed the following day. With the exception of not infrequent snip ing on a small scale into the Commission, and supporting column, camps in the Wadi Ma’din, and some shots fired by the Mifyahi section at a party of British soldiers, w hich necessitated the destruction of their towers, no further hostilities occurred. Captain Warneford, Political Officer, when on his way to join the supporting troops was treacherously murdered at Am Rija by an Arab police Naik in Government employ. During April, the British troops who w r ere beginning to feel the severe heat, returned to Aden mi Ras al 'Ara, a wing of the 94th Russell’s Infantry remaining in support of the Commission. On the 23rd May, the Commission reached the coast at Ras al 'Ara, on the termination of their field work. The escort and supporting troops returned to Aden by sea, the Commissioners proceeding to Perim to complete matters with the Turkish Commissioners at Shekh Said. A force of British and Native Infantry with a section of guns remained at Dala at which place a political officer remained. In July, the Kotaibi were again reported to be inclined to give trouble. A force w'as immediately despatched from Aden by the General Officer Commanding, but no hostile measu/es w r ere neces. ary. Wastage in men .—Representative figures are in this case somewhat hard to arrive at as of the troops employed during the operations, two British Regiments went home in toto and 1 British and 1 Native Mountain batteries returned to India. The number of men invalided was therefore probably much less than it wmuld have been, had these units remained in Aden.

Horses (Aden troop and officers’ chargers) and mules did well and kept in good condition. There were a few casualties among the latter from wound or accident but the total loss was quite insignificant. With regard to camels, those owned by the Commission probably did more, and more continuous, marching than other Government animals. The losses were very slight. Among the hired transport the losses incurred were chiefly due to the owners working unfit or immature animals. [C57QMGIB] H-• .--.Vi- 59 CHAPTER IX. Administration. The question of administration, in dealing with independent Arab States, is not one which need occupy much space. Such as it is, it varies in different districts both in nature and degree, but the foundation for all, the Sharia or Koranic law is the same. The Kadis are entrusted with the administration of this law: the ruler of the country adjudicates in serious cases, and assists the Kadi as far as the execution of his deci sions is concerned. I here is, however, a wide difference between^ theory and practice and in the majority of districts the ruler s authority over most of his subjects, with the exception of his personal retainers and entourage, is very slight. The Sultan of Lahej exercises a more absolute authority over his tribe than other rulers, with the exception perhaps of the Jamadar of Shehr and Makalla. The Haushabi, if a' riiler of stronger character, would, both from the nature of his country and the character of his people, wield much the same authority over the majority. In the Amiri country, which has been already described as a confederacy of various small tribes, the Amir’s authority, as has been seen, is only absolute over a comparative ly small proportion. The Upper Yafa’i Sultan has little or no authority over his tribe as far as administration is concerned. Of the Fadli, several of the sub-tribes are independent. T. he Aulaki have several rulers, \\ hile many of the outlying and nomadic tribes are practically beyond the conti ol of their Sultans. The Subehi are a law unto themselves. It will be seen, therefore, that the term ” Administration ” is somewhat difficult of application to so heterogeneous a collection of tribes. ^ , Penalties for the more serious crimes are, however, laid down ; their exaction depends on the power of the ruler to exert his authority, or perhaps, in many cases, to get hold of the Offender. Murder is broadly punishable by death, but the question is complicated by the institu tion of “ diya ” or blood-money, the rules as^ to which seem somewhat complicated and vary in their application in the different districts. Human life is very cheap, in the sense of the frequency with which murder is committed. In the sense of pecuniary compensation, it is expensive, a sum of 770 dollars (or 100 she-camels, which seems a ^ very disproportionate alternative) being exacted. *The whole question is still further complicated by differences in pro cedure in cases of wilful murder and accidental killing. It is only worth touch ing on, in as far as the escape of the crimi nal, which, in the wilder districts almost non-payment of the penalty, leads to the * (Note. — Hunter mentions 1,000 sequins cr 100 she-carels for murder and 700 doliais for man slaughter, but 770 dollars or 10 she- camels was always mentioned in the country. The i.oco sequins have probably dropped out which would account for the disproportion). invariably occurs, and the existence of blood-feuds which complicate inter-tribal dealings and, indi rectly, our own dealings with the tribes. For wounding, there is a scale of fines computed on the gravity of the injury inflicted. In the case of the capture of a murderer, the relatives of the Deceased have the option of killing him or accepting the “ diya. ” . Amputation of the hand is the punishment for theft in most districts, but it does not seem to be often exacted at the present day. Fines are in flicted for the same offence.61 The commoner weights and measures (chiefly grain) are the Rati equal to about i lb. The Kasa equal to 5 ratls generally : (in Dala the Kasa is about 6f lbs and varies slightly in different districts in the neighbourhood). The Kadha equal to 16 Kasa. The Farasla equal to 28 pounds. Of these the Kasa and Kadha are used in measuring grain. The Rail and the Farasla for weight in bulk as a load of dates, etc. Superficial land measure in Lahej, according to Hunter, is the u Dimd ” equivalent to 1,700 or :,8oo square yards or about an acre. The “ Dira” apparently of about the same extent was used in Dala. For calculating length of marches, etc., from native information, nothing but practice and even acquaintance with the idiosyncracies of a particular informant, are of much avail. They are of course measured by time, and the Arab's notions of time, according to our ideas, are exceedingly vague. ‘‘ Sa’ah ' or hour is a very elastic and misleading term. Distances traversed, naturally vary much with the going, but a caravan “ day' may be taken from 10 miles to a maximum of 15 miles. (If it were a question of reaching water, the distance might be longer). A “foot ” day would vary from some 15 to 20 miles. A short march is often described as “ mughadda” literally from sunrise to the hour of the first meal, generally taken about 9 or 10 A.M., and would mean a march of some 3 or 4 hours’ duration. The hours of prayer are often a rough guide. The following formula; to calculate dates according to the Muham madan era may be of use;— (1) To find 1734 A.D. according to the Hejira:— From 1734, subtract 621, the difference of the two eras. 1113.

Military. . “’Asakir ” or professional soldiers are maintained by the rulers of the various districts under British protection, but except in the case of the Jatnadar of Shehr and Makalla and the Upper Aulaki Sultan, who main tain respectively about 1,000 men, they do not exceed two or three hundred per district. The main fighting force are the “ Kaba’il ” or tribesmen, and in the case of an unwarlike country like Lahej, the Sultan when going to war, hires the services of mercenaries from warlike tribes like the Yafa’i for the occasion. The “’Asakir ” are as a rule more in the nature of a body-guard for the chief, and an assistance to him in tax collecting. They are often of the slave class, either of African descent, or li Muwallad’' or half-caste. Armament, The principal rulers have a few cannon of antiquated pattern, which produce more of a moral than a real effect, though firearms alone can do little against stone towers. Firearms are the chief weapon of the fighting man. The old matchlock, or long Arab gun, is rapidly being replaced by the breech-loader, the most common pattern being the Legras rifle or carbine. Remingtons, Turkish Martinis, and a few other patterns are occasionally seen, but in comparatively small numbers. The re-arma- ment with the breech-loader is going on rapidly. They are naturally, at present, commoner near the coast. Practically all the Subehi now have them. The Kotaibi and Radfan tribes are also well provided with them, as are the Haushabi. Many of the Yafa’i still carry the old matchlock, but every man who can, obtains a breech-loader,, and in a very few years the former will only be seen as a curio. Mr. Bury sta'es that on his visit to Ansab, the matchlock was universal, but that is five years ago, and the Aulaki are probably replacing them jike other tribes. Generally, as time goes on, the Arab will, from his better armament, become a 'more formidable opponent. Ammunition for the breech-loader is of course net very plentiful, but the Arab husbands his rounds as well as he can ; still any protracted operations would be likely to exhaust the stock. During the Kotaibi expedition, a native report, from a reliable source, stated that the tribes men were running short, and for a few days they did not show up much. Another report, soon after, came that they had received several camel loads of ammunition from Lahej. It may have been a coincidence, but almost the next day, they made a sharp attack and fired away a’good number of rounds. Each tribesman as a rule has his bandolier full of ammunition, some 40 rounds apiece, and unless he has sufficient warning to lay in a reserve stock, no very easy thing on short notice, his warlike career is necessarily limited. It would therefore seem well worth while in case of future hostilities, to keep a sharp look-out on any side tracks by which the ammunition would most probably be brought up. In this con nection, Arab allies might be usefully employed. Whether they could be trusted not to let the ammunition through, is another matter, but if they were allowed to keep all they took, it wou&gt;d probably be a greater attrac tion than the opposing side could offer. Native reloading and recapping does not seem to have, as yet, attained to any considerable proportions 663 Very few smokeless rifles have been observed, and those only in the possession of the chief men (excluding any given as Durbar presents to friendly Sultans), but 303 ammunition can be purchased both in Lahej and in the Wadi Ma’din. The introduction of even a small proportion of such rifles would greatly increase the Arab’s capacity for annoyance. The sword is generally only carried by chief men, Sayids, Sufis, and men of a more peaceful class, Spears are often carried by men without rifles, and are usually used for stabbing, the objective being the region of the liver. The “Jambi'a,” a short broad curved dagger, is carried on all occa sions by all classes. The ornamentation of the sheath and hilt depends on the status of the wearer. It is capable of inflicting a most severe wound. Fighting qualities and method of fighting. Most tribes may be described as fighting races. The least warlike are, perhaps, the Abdali, certain sections of the Haushabi, and the Amiri in the vicinity of Dala. The best ally of the Arab is the country which he inhabits. About the plain country, it is not necessary to say more than that sand dunes, and rolling ground, with a certain amount of scrub, alford cover from which a resolute man can give a good deal of annoyance. The hillman is generally of a more warlike disposition. Accustomed from his youth up to petty feuds, in which carelessness in taking cover, or failure to keep his ejes open may easily cost him his life, he is both active and sure-footed and can make good time on a hill side. His fighting is generally in his own country or on the border, and he has a very shrewd idea of a commanding position and of where a sangar can be placed to best advantage. The hills and stones in Yemen are of much the same colour as the Arab himself, who usually fights stripped to the waist, and it is by no means easy to discern a brown head cautiously poked up from behind a browm stone at some 800 yards. The smoke of his rifle of course discovers his approximate position, but with anything of a wind blowing, it is even then difficult to ascertain exactly where he is located. The average track in the hills is along the bed of a nullah with high and precipitous hills on either side difficult enough of ascent in themselves. Artillery was found of the greatest assistance in clearing the way suffi ciently for the infantry to crown the heights with little opposition, and had it not been freely employed, the casualties during recent operations would have been much heavier. During the Kotaibi expedition, the Arabs at first showed little fear of shell fire, but as time went on, they evinced an increasing aversion to it. They were shrewd enough to dis cover that the occupation of sangars gave an excellent target to artillery, and soon abandoned the practice. Of rifle fire they have little fear, at any rate when behind cover, and though they are quite alive to the advantages of smokeless powder, the solid bullet of the Lee-Metford is looked on with contempt, as they say that unless it hits in the heart or head, it does little harm. * Their own firearms are carelessly looked after* the foresight being frequently blunted and the slide of the back-sight loose. At the same time they are far from contemptible marksmen, and are capable of fair approximate shooting. Although not understanding the figures on the leaf, they have, from practice, a fair idea of how to regulate it, and notmfreauentlv use a conspicuous tree or other object as a range-mark. Famj recent experience, such tales as the Arabs putting “ the back-sight full up to make the bullet hit harder,' may be looked on as myths. ^ As regards charges or attacks at close quarters, we have no experience. The rifle-armed Arab carries no bayonet, and has no stabbing weapon but the Jambi’a: they occasionally follow up to short distances, a party of Kotaibi once getting to 30 yards of a company of British Infantry and caus ing some casualties by a suddenly delivered fire, but of charges proper, there was no attempt. During the attack on Awabil, a chief was seen to leap on a rock and wave his sword, in a manner interpreted by the garrison as an encouragement to his men to charge, but as a bullet immediately knocked him' off the rock again, there was no opportunity of elaborating the theorv. A large body of spear-men were reported to be in reserve on that occasion, but the riflemen being repulsed, they did not shew up.^ Night attacks were frequently promised, but on no occasion carried out. Inquiries from friendly Arabs as to the manner in which they would be delivered, elicited the information that they would take the form of heavy fire from any commanding position which they could occupy. Sniping into camps at night on a small scale w r as not uncommon, but no casualties were ever caused by it. . . -u .u a u As allies in carrying on operations against another tribe, the Arab has several disadvantages, and it is doubtful if any benefit would ever result. In the first placed is impossible to distinguish the friendly from the hostile Arab. Co-operation being taken to mean pushing out well to the front in search of loot if no actual fight is in progress, it is obvious that this not only hampers the troops, but constitutes a source of danger, as if it is known that friendly Arabs are out in front, parties of the enemy may be allowed, as on one occasion actually occurred, to get close up with im punity. As guides, they are frequently useful, as, if on bad terms with the hostile tribe, their fidelity can be depended on, and certain selected in dividuals in British employ rendered most excellent service. During the operations in the Kotaibi country, retainers of the Amir of Dala were on several occasions usefully employed in occupying hills near camp, which, while too far away to piquet, it was just as well to deny to the enemy. Experience went to show that the Arab is not a very early bird as a general rule. The Yafa’i were expected to, and very possibly would have, attacked Awabil in the small hours or at dawn, but for a heavy storm at that hour ; but the Kotaibi were never found to be early afoot, and on one occasion found their sangars occupied, while they had left them to cook and eat an early meal. At the same time it is dangerous to generalise from isolated instances, and it is as well to be prepared both for night attacks and for finding the Arabs astir at early dawn. The Ahl Asir, who have been for some time constantly fighting with the Turks, are said to not infrequently charge, and it is also as well to make allowance for the difference in tactics which the fanatical spirit of a Jehad might introduce. Boldness, at present, among the tribes, may be set down to ignorance as to the effect of modern weapons, and less resistance expected as opera tions advance. In fact, the action of the Ahl Heh in holding up the escort of the Boundary Commission, 250 Infantry and 2 guns, when they had65 actually reached the head of a commanding pass, with a handful of about 40 men, can be accounted for on no other hypothesis. Although a good number of men are killed every year in small inter tribal skirmishes and feuds, inter-tribal warfare on a larger scale is seldom of a very deadly nature. During the capture of certain Haushabi forts by the Abdali in 1894, the defenders, who opened a hot fire while the assailants were at a distance, ceased firing as soon as they had come within effective range, and the casualties, after several thousand men had been engaged some days, did not exceed five. In fact, the object on these occasions, is to bring matters to an end without causing too heavy losses which would only impede the ultimate adjustment of the dispute. The Arab of the hills may be not inaptly compared to the Pathan, though less formidable than, and without the dash of, the latter. The con ditions of life, their towers, which in inter-tribal warfare are to all practical purposes forts, the continual existence of feuds necessitating constant watchfulness and practice in partisan warfare, all tend to produce much the same result. Operations hitherto have all been directed against isolated tribes, but should any cause such as a Jehad, ever lead to any thing like combination on a large scale, there is little doubt that in view of the great natural difficulties of the country, both as regards offensive tactics and the supplying of a large force, operations would assume a very serious character. With regard to numbers, the estimates of the fighting strength of the various tribes, rough as they are, are the only guide that can be given, and on the political situation at any given time, would depend the numbers from whom opposition might be expected. Reference has been made in a former chapter to the unsuitability of the Arab temperament to regular military service. There seems, however, no reason why he might not be utilised and do good work in a more or less irregular capacity, the bonds of discipline being made as little irksome as possible. The Arab has the following qualities as a fighting man; keen sight and wiry active physique ; he is accustomed to a very frugal diet. He has a natural aptitude for scouting, skirmishing, etc., and is, as a rule, intelligent and quick to learn. He is keen on marksmanship and with a little instruction could be a very good shot. He is fond of a fight and if led by men he trusts, would probably behave pluckily enough. On the other hand he is excitable, quarrelsome, and very independent in spirit. Great tact would be required in dealing with him ; he is fairly easily led but hard to drive. Much would depend on the careful selection of the men, more on that of the native officers, who should be of suitable social position and character, and still more on the British officer in charge, who should be not only thoroughly conversant with the language, but also endowed with considerable patience and tact, for both would be required. Some ten Arabs were engaged by the Boundary Commission from the Dala tribes, and remained with it throughout. They were employed as guides, orderlies, etc., and did most excellent work. Though nothing pleased them better than the chance of a brush with aggressive tribesmen, they were most useful as intermediaries, and te their headman, Shekh Husen Salih, of the Azraki tribe, a man liked and respected by officers and men of the whole force, much of the success in dealing with suspicious and [C57QMGIB] I66 * semi-hostile tribes was due. It would seem that there would be room for employment of such men, not only in the interior but also in such a campaign as the Somali, where a company or so could be usefully em ployed as Camel Mounted Infantry. It would of course be an experiment, and it is impossible to forecast how it would answer, but given favourable conditions, there would seem to be no reason why it should not be a success. ■&amp;CI' drvi n-vrir ( 1 2 t-i*—x ^ V sf ^ ( ii .J QtfCo-Z*. rxn^t 'S 1 ‘LGYL.L-jf t*' 'bxT tc -i (hi) ^ l x ' ^ i C^iyC ^ t 7 V c&lt;. , On L^T,'l A.

They maintain on the whole friendly relations with one another, though there are certain exceptions the original ground of the bad feeling dating a good many years back. The relations between the Abdali and the Haushabi, though no open feud now exists between them, have been strained since the early seventies nor is there much prospect of a more cordial feeling during the life of present Haushabi Sultan, in whose mind the loss of the lands of A 1 Anad and the reverses he has sustained, are bound to rankle. Nor can any permanent settlement be expected between the Fadli and Lower Yafai tribes as long as water possesses the value that it does in an otherwise sterile country, and the Arab disposition remains unchanged. Fighting over the water rights of the Nazi'a, the irrigation canal, between the liana and Ha^san rivers, already mentioned, has been for many years of constant occurrence and was in progress as lately as last year. The inter-tnba! rdatmns of the other tribes are on the whole amicable beuds are bound to occur between neighbours from time to time but with the exceptions noted above, there may be said to be no standing cause for bad blood. The wilder tribes of the Subehi are almost certain to continue annoying their neighbours by occasional raids, and in the case ot the greatest offenders, punishment is very difficult as they possess neither tovvers nor crops, the loss of which would affect them much, and they can always escape by taking to the hills. VVith regard to external relations, the powers with whom the tribes hold intercourse, are ourselves and the Turks. The delimitation of the most important section of the boundary between the two Empires may fairly be expected to put a stop to most of the intrigue and aggression which has been prevalent in the past, but that none will occur in the future ls improbable, taking into consideration the bent of the Turkish official mind, fortunately, the treatment of their tribes by the Turks furnishes a sufficiently good object lesson to those on our side, and it is certainly to the interest of rulers of British-protected States to deserve well of our Government. At the same time, unpopular as is the Turkish regime, the ( ‘Sultan of Roum ” is a great personage, the Arab ruler is easily Hattered, and given flattering secret overtures from the Vali of \emen, and pique against some neighbouring ruler, or childish discon tent against ourselves, it is not impossible that troublesome complica tions may yet arise. It is difficult to see, however, in view of the dehmte understanding as to the respective spheres of influence of the two Governments, how such complications could be of a very serious cuaracrer. With regard to the north-wesb section of the boundary which has not yet been delimited, a clear understanding as to the spheres of influence will no doubt be arrived at. But even should such understanding yet leave something to be desired, as matters at present stand in Turkish emen, the lurk has his hands far too full to wander so far afield ohould such an opportunity occur in the future, the main obstacles to his advance to the east is the tribe of Upper Yafa’i, which is definitely68 counted among those under British influence, and with which open over tures are thus debarred. Although certain individuals are not want- in' to whom a Turkish stipend, sub rosa ) would be acceptable, the tribe as &amp; a whole are most averse to Turkish interference and there seems little likelihood of an intrigue in this direction, at any rate as matters stand at present, meeting with any success. As regards Beda and Behan, even in the absence of a satisfactory agreement concerning them, their distance from any effective Turkish centre would seem to render their position fairly secure. It is also not unlikely that feuds between our own and J urkish border tribes may occur, causing possible interruption to the caravan traffic, from which a very anomalous situation might well arise, as the Turks, at the present day, have little or no hold on the more powerful tribes on their southern border, and even with the desire for loyal co-operation, it would be, at the least, inconvenient for them to organise an expedition to these parts, Turkish border customs-posts may also not improbably afford instances of extortion calling for representation, but though complications on the border, of one kind or another, are by no means out of the question, our position is to this extent strengthened, that whereas formerly, the Turkish authorities could easily draw a red herring across the scent by disputing the ownership of the territory in which an incident occurred, the definite settlement of the boundary will now oblige them to keep to the point at issue, or, at any rate, provide good scope for their ingenuity in devising some other pretext for evading it. A statement compiled by the Aden Residency shewing the treaty relations existing between the British Government and the tribes in the British Protectorate is attached to this chapter.Statement showing the tribes in the vicinity of Aden who are in treaty relation with the British Government. T 6 9PREFACE. This report was written in a preliminary form by Major J. K. Tod in the summer of 1903. By means of the informa tion subsequently collected by Captain E. A. F. Redl, the Mili tary Report written by Major A. Crawford, and Memoranda by the late Captain G. Warneford, many corrections and additions have since been made. In transliterating Arabic names as far as possible the Hun terian system has been adhered to exceptions being made where too strict an adherence would be misleading. Thus, where the article assimilates its 1 to the following consonant the sound is followed in transliteration, e, g., Ad Dala (not A 1 Dala). Where in pronunciation a consonant is completely elided it is omitted, e. g., Jji is written ol as the £ is not sounded at all. ^ and * 3 , though they have a strongly aspirated dental sound, similar to the dth in ‘width,’ are transliterated as simply ‘d.’ It is believed that this will prove to be the least mis leading form. The following terms are of frequent occurrence :— Wadi. —River, or valley of any description. Selat. —Watercourse. Ghail .—Running stream. Jabal. —Mountain or hill. Same as above, but generally smaller. Lakmat. —Hill or hillock. Sh'ab. —Ravine. Habil. —Undulating upland. Naktl. —Mountain Pass. Bir. —Well. Wall. —Shrine. Bab. Madiak Deyak Dakar. —Cliff. ]- Gorge.

Geography. Sixty or 70 miles inland from Aden, and generally parallel with the „ , coast line rises the steeply scarped mountain Lienera • a ✓ i range which may be said to form the first step of the highlands of Yemen. In the immediate hinterland of Aden itself the two principal rivers ol this part of Arabia, the Wadi Tiban, and the Wadi Bana, flowing frorr north to south cut through the above range. The mountain tract between them forms, roughly speaking, the Amir of Dala’s territory. Though the range here presents a very irregular front towards the south, the scarp may be clearly traced in the abrupt cliffs of Jabal Mafari, Ad Dubiyat, and Jabal Harir. Southwards, it falls away in a series of broken mountains and hills to the Aden littoral The above mentioned tract consists mainly of rugged mountains of igneous rock, with here and there broad cultivated valleys. The Amir of Dala’s territory is bounded on the north by a line which B . leaves the Wadi Bana at the foot of a promi nent hill, Haid Ithri, runs west over the crest of this hill and down to the valley of the Selat Bakain, across it, and up Haid Sala, a big spur of Jabal Harir, divides the village of Adina on the south from Marat on the north, and reaches the summit of Jabal Harir just north of the village of A 1 Fokaha, descends by the Nakil Ha ban spur, passes just north of the Shairi village of Khubedat and then runs down the southern branch of the Wadi A 1 Haslab to near the village of Sarara, then turns north, over the peak of Jabal Akram, and crosses the valley north of that hill between the Amiri village of Dar al Hanbali, and the Muflahai village of Khalla, then north- west among the foothills of the Shaibi range near the Amiri village of Al Kuren to a cons picuous red rock which marks the junction of the lands of Habil al Jilb (Shaibi), Al Kuren and Al Ukla. The line then goes north up a steep spur to a point on the Mares border known as Ras Nakil Adana. From this point westwards the Amir's border is the frontier between the British protectorate and Turkish territory. The line goes west across the Nakil Suedato Nijd M’awad at the head of the Wadi Reshan, then south to the summit of the hill called Jabal Barkan ; west along the south ern slopes of a ridge to its western point, known as Jabal Jerad, thence to Nijd Aslum £ a mile south of Kataba ; crosses the Selat Kataba 2 miles below the town, then south-west to Nijd an Nus, turns due west across Habil Bajah and the Selat Human to the tomb of Wali Umr Ismail, thence goes south-w r est, crossing the Wadi Jimri just above Kule’a as Sufla, to high ground called Habil Hawar ; thence it runs south across the Wadi Tiban and up to a high north-eastern shoulder of Jabal Hesha known as Jabal Sarir. The districts which border on the Amir of Dala’s territory along the above line are as follows From the Wadi Bana to the Selat Bakain, the [c 57 qmgib] k-vr -rsi. 77 Shaibi districts of the A 1 Musallami, and the As Siel ; thence across Jabal Harir and across Jabal Akram to the Shaibi foothills is a district belonging to the Muflahai section of the Yafa, the central village of which is khal a. Thence to near A 1 Ukla, the small district of Habil al Jilb, belonging to the As Siel section of the Shaibi. Thence to near Kataba the Turkish district of Mares The lands of Kataba itself up to the main Selat Kataba water course ; thence to the Selat al Jimri, the district of Yubi ; thence up to Jabal Hesha, the district of Haiki. The western border of the Amir of Dala’s territory also marks the frontier of the British Protectorate. The line runs south from Jabal Sarir, generally parallel to the course of the Wadi Tiban and a mile or two west of it, traversing the steep slopes of Jabal He'ha: first to the high point J. Mansura west of the Dakkam viUaoe of Ukaib. then across a valley to another point J Fanana; across the valley of the Wadi Hafasa, and up to the peak of Jabal Rima which marks the Ahmadi border ; then down to the Wadi Hora which it crosses just above the Ahmadi villages of Hora, then south over a spur of J. Attaba, and across the Wadi Mukhailan and the Wadi Tusan just above their junction; then up to a point, Lakmat Ash Shijfa, and along the crest line of the range from which the \Vadi Kurim and the Wadi Hilhal drain east to the Tiban, then up a broken ridge by J. Mimtar until it meets the Haushabi border at a peak called Haid Hasun on the range which connects Jabal Warwa with Jabal Am Amma. The districts which border on the Amir of Dala’s territory along this line are, from the Haiki district down to the W 7 adi Mukhailan, Jabal Hesha ; thence to the Nakil Hilhal, Amara ; and from the Nakil Hilhal to the Hau shabi border, Human The Amir of Dala’s territory is bounded on the south by a line which from Haid Hasun runs east for a short distance along the main range, then follows the spur forming the southern watershed of Wadi Hilhal, crosses the Wadi Tiban at the junction of its left bank tributary, the Wadi Shan, ascends and follows southwards the crest of the mountains above the left bank of the Tiban so as to exclude the Haushabi villages and lands of Al Kama and Lijma, and meets the Wadi 1 iban again at the junction of the Wadi Makhran ; leaves the Wadi Tiban again, following eastwards the crest of the hills forming the southern watershed of the Wadi Makh ran to the Kalaban peak, thence along the col which is crossed by the pass (Nakil Hesha) at the head of the Wadi Bilih, then south-east along the southern watershed of the Selat Kharjan and down a spur to a point called Safa Atla on the right bank of the Wadi al Milah ; thence north across the Wadi al Milah up to the peak of Jabal Barrash and follows the crest line 3^ miles further north, then follows round the head of a tributary of the Selat am Suhebiya and runs south-east down the ridge above the right bank of the Selat Tuwana, then turns east across the Selat am Suhebiya just leaving the villages of Al Hamra and At Tamer to the south. The line now turns south ascending a north eastern spur of the Radfan mountains called Haid Musa, to a peak called Jabal Fallaha, then turns east along the watershed which connects Jabal Fallaha with Jabal Al Huria, the highest peak of the Radfan mountains. From Jabal Al Huria it runs down east or north-east to the Wadi Bana. -f■ f 7 8 The districts which border on the Amir of Dala’s territory along this line are as follows From Haid Hasun on the west to Safa Atla on the bank of the Wadi al Milah, the country of the Haushabi. From Safa Atla round to Jabal Fallaha the country of the Alawi. From Jabal Fallaha to the Wadi Bana, the Danbari and Dairi districts of the Radfan Mountains, both of which tribes are supposed to acknowledge the supremacy of the Haushabi Sultan. On the east the Wadi Bana forms the boundary of the Amir of Dala’s territory dividing it from the Yafa country on the left bank. The country comprised within the above limits is about 750 square miles in extent. ^ Imost the entire country consists of mountains of a remarkably abrupt .... , and rugged description. Mountain systems. °° On the east is the continuous range formed by Jabal Harir and Jabal Halmin. In the centre the bhairi hills, and the rugged promontory which juts south from the head of the Dala valley culminates in the remarkable plateau of Ad Dubiyat, and falls away, in a series of rocky foothills to the Suheb vallev. The north-western part is occupied by the great mountain mass of Jabal Jihaf, with its far reaching spurs and offshoots. 1 he whole of the south-western part is an intricate mass of rugged mountains, cons picuous among which are the peaks of Jabal Mashwara and Jabal An Nad in the north, and Jabal Hakla, Jabal Hadwa, Haid al Harfa and others, in the south. The south-eastern corner is occupied by the massive and rocky northern spurs of the Radfan range. Jabal Harir (7,754 feet) is a conspicuous flat-topped ridge running from north to south in continuation of the Jabal Harir. Mares and Shaibi ranges; on the east it is steeply scarped for some hundreds of feet, then falls away in broken hill?* and deep cut valleys to the Wadi Bana; the western slopes are also very steep down to the Selat an Noba, but at the head of that valley they fall away more gradually in the rocky ridges of the Shain country to the Dala } plain. On the south Jabal Harir is connected jabal Halmin. by a low col with Jabal Halmin (7,53* feet), a rugged mountain rising steeply on the west to sharp peaks and running down eastwards in long ridges and deep valleys to the Wadi Bana. The Shairi hills form a series of parallel ridges, the intermediate valleys draining westwards into tne Mala Jabal Shairi. valley. The highest peak of Jabal Shairi (6,525 feet) rises conspicuously between the Khureba gorge on the west, and that of the Selat an Noba on the east. ^ , The narrow tongue of broken and precipitous high and which rum, south from Dala rises to its highest level Ad Dubiyat. j n the plateau of Ad Dubiyat. The plateau stonv and sloping, about a square mile in extent, its highest point crowned by the white shrine of Wali Hassan, 5,884 feet, which forms a conspicuous land-mark. On all sides except the north the table.land falls away in sheer precipices of great herght. Below to he south .9 rugged mass of foot-hills, prominent among which are the rocky crest oUabal Farah, and the triple crags of Jabal Barash ( 3 , 99 °) fett *Jabal Jihaf (7,840 feet) is a massive rocky mountain with abrupt crags and precipices, but with a considerable extent Jabal Jihaf. of corn p ara tj ve ly level cultivated ground near the summit, and in the valleys, the most extensive of which drain to the south. ., . The highest summits are on the northernmost ridge whence steep precipices 2,000 to 3,000 feet in height, and rugged spurs fall away to the plain country of A 1 Hajar. On the east the slopes are similarly abrupt and rocky rising from the Dala plain. On the west is the deep narrow gorge of the Wadi Tiban to which again the massive spurs of Jabal Jihaf fall away in tremendous precipices of bare rock. The most considerable of these western spurs is Jabal Amur which forms the boundary between the Humada and Dakkam. Southwards the Jabal Jihaf system extends in two great spurs ; the one forms the district of Mafari, and culminates to the south in the remarkable fortress-like bluff of Jabal Mafari (6,490 feet). The other originating from the western ridge of Jabal Jihaf, rises first to the twin peak of Jabal Ayub (Jabal Thamad and jabal Amkayan, 7,394 feel) and thence to the south forms the district of Humedi with its curiously abrupt pinnacles Jabal Misman, 7,033 feet and Jabal Seyan. Severed from the Jabal Jihaf system by the deep gorge of the Wadi Tabaghain is the extremely involved mountain South-western system. system that occupies the south-western part of the Amir of Dala’s territory. The rounded summit of Jabal Mashwara ( 6,355 feet ) is connected to the east by a low col with the Dubiyat heights. Westward from Jabal Mashwara runs a steep range with Jabal Kohilan (5,462 feet) as one of its peaks, and rising 00 the west to Jaabl An Nad, a fine peak 7,131 feet, which towers above the valleys of the Tabaghain and the Tiban. From Jabal Mashwara southwards runs the rocky serrated range of Jabat Lassat. From Jabal Kohilan originate the southward ramifications which culminate in the peaks of jabal Hakla, Jabal Hadwa, and Jabal Kalaban, as well as the rugged mountains which tower above the Tiban valley behind A 1 Kama and Lijma. From Jabal An Nad the rocky spur of Jabal Shamukan runs down into the angle between the Wadi Shan and the Wadi Tiban. The northern part of the Radfan range which is comprised within the Amir's territory consists of bold rocky spurs which a an * jut far out to the north from the main mountain. Their general aspect is extremely bare and arid, but they enclose deep and fertile valleys of considerable extent, such as the Selat Masra and the Selat Bujer. Jabal al Huria, the highest peak of the Radfan range, is 6,107 feet above sea level. The only rivers are the Wadi Bana and the R,,crs - Wadi Tiban. The Wadi Bana which rises far to the north-west among the hills north of Ibb, sweeps round the north of the Al Aud, Mares, and Shaibi countries and enters the territory of the Amir at its north-eastern corner. Thence it forms its eastern boundary until it passes out of Amiri territory again at the junction of the Abdulla and Dairi borders on the east of the Radfan Mountains, It runs in a deep valley between big hills, but there are broadV 5S 8o The river runs from 2 to 3 feet cultivated spaces on its banks in parts, deep in the dry season. The Wadi Tiban which rises between Ibb and Jibla enters Amiri territory in the lowlying Dakkam country north-west of Jabal Jihaf It then turns south and flows near the western border down a narrow eor^e be tween Jabal Jihaf and Jabal Hesha. Through the Ahmadi country its valley is comparatively open, as much as a quarter of a mile wide in places with stretches of cultivation at intervals along its banks. V * The principal tributary watercourses of the Wadi Tiban in Dala territory are— On the right bank :—Wadi Hora. Wadi Tusan Wadi Hilhal. On the left bank :—Wadi Tabaghain. Wadi Shan. Wadi Makhran. The Wadi Tiban runs about a foot deep, and lo to 15 yards wide in the dry season. It leaves Amin territory at the Haushabi border, about f, 5 the po ! nt whl ‘ r ? 11 entered ‘t- Both the Wadi Bana and the Wadi Tiban are frequently enclosed by narrow gorges and both are liable to sudden floods. ° All other Wadis in Amiri territory are torrent beds which are either dry except in time of sudden flood or have only a few small springs. The largest of these are :— The watercourse which rises west of Jahal Harir and runs south under the names of the Selat an Noba, Selat ad Dabab and the Seiat ar Rabwa to the Suheb valley at Jimil. There is a good ghail or running stream in the part of this watercourse t miles above Sulek. J The Selat Hardaba, the sources of which are in the gorges of A1 Khureba and A 1 Haki immediately east of Dala, and which also runs south to theSuheb valley at^md. There are good springs at Ghail Hardaba, 16 miles down the valley from Dala. . T^ e . Tabaghain, which is formed by the junction of the channels w nch taking their rise high up on Jihaf descend south draining the Azraki Mafan and Humedi country, and runs west down a fine gorge to the liban. There is a small perennial stream at intervals in its course viz m the Darj an Nishfi gorge south-west of Dala, in the Azraki countr’y just above Ad Dakka, and in the Ahmadi country below the A 1 Madiak gorge Inthe Azraki country the watercourse is known as the Wadi ar Rona ’ The Wadi Mash wa ra, which takes its rise on Jabal Mashwara, and runs due south in a deep rocky gorge, becoming the Wadi al Milah when it enters Haushabi territory. . The Wadi Tem which drains the southern slopes of the Halmin moun tains, and the north-eastern slopes of the Radfan Mountains and runs east in a wide open valley to the Wadi Bana. 7 ^* AWa which rises high up in the Radfan Hills, and runs north-west through the Kotaibi country to Nobat al Kariati at the northern foot of the hills, then turns south to join the Selat am Suhebiya near Jimil The lower part of the valley is i a mile to a mile wide, cultivated up to the foot of the hills on either side. The watercourse is dry and sandy. Higher up the valley narrows and there is a running stream. 4 /8r The Selal Bujcr which has its source among the M Bakri hills of the Rad fan range and runs west to join the Selat Masra at Nobat al Kariati. There are two main branches, in the more northerly of which, a running stream (ghaib takes its rise. This stream runs about 15 feet wide, and 1 foot deep, till it loses itself at Nobat al Kariati, 5 miles from its source. The lower part of the valley is a narrow gorge between rocky hills. Near the village of Sum’an the gorge opens, and there is cultivation, though the valley is still narrow. ^782 (sy CHAPTER IK Ethnographv. The Amir of Dala’s territory is inhabited by a number of different £. cneral tribes that have little in common besides their Arab nationality, and few ties to bind them together beyond the need for mutual support and protection. Many of them barely acknowledge the Amir's suzerainty. Their frequent feuds and dissensions keep them apart, and they cannot be regarded in any sense as one people. Society is divided into classes as usual among Arabs, ■ viz., the Seyidsj the priestly caste descended from the Prophet. The Shekhs, hereditary chiefs. The Kabail, or tribesmen. f Ihe Asakir, profes sional soldiers. The R'aya or peasant farmer class; and the slaves. The people are physically a poor race, the men short and slight though wiry and active. The majority are not Characteristics. pure Arabs, but show an unmistakeable strain of African slave blood. This is even the case with the Amirs themselves. There are a considerable number of pure negroes among them, the descen dants of former slaves. The people are industrious and simple in their habits; they have the ordinary Arab characteristics of pride, and an intense love of indepen dence. They are hospitable. |self-contained under ordinary circumstan ces, but very excitable when provoked. They are very jealous and quar relsome as is proved by the constant strife between tribes and clans, and the blood feuds in almost every family. The manner in which these feuds are carried on shows them to be vindictive and treacherous, with liitle sense of honour. Their apparent avariciousness is no doubt partly due to the way in which their cupidity has been excited in their dealings with the Government. They are much under the influence of their Seyids, and have all the fanatical intolerance of a narrow minded Muham madan community. On the other hand, many of the better class men, not excepting the Seyids themselves, when once their prejudices are overcome, prove to be intelligent, courteous, and pleasant to deal with. A considerable number of the people have travelled and seen the world, either as traders, or as stokers on board ships, but their experi- ences do not as a rule seem to have lessened their prejudices against the unbeliever. The women though kept in a position of inferiority as usual with Mussalmans, are not secluded, but go about freely and unveiled. They do a great deal of the work of the household such as tending cattle, draw ing water, cutting firewood, etc. The majority of the population are settled, living in villages of solidly constructed stone houses, and occupying them- Habits and customs. selves with agriculture and commerce. A large proportion however, in the southern part especially, are nomadic, keeping large herds of goats and sheep, and moving about as the grazing and water-supply at different seasons require.§3 The men wear a loin cloth, a cloth wrapped round the waist and sup porting the jimbea knife, and a body cloth of Clothing, etc. dark blue cotton. The indigo dye has an unplea sant odour, and conies off freely, giving the wearers a very dirty appear ance. The headdress is a small blue turban, but in the remoter parts of the hills the men bind a mere strip of cloth tightly round their heads and comb their hair out and tie it in a fuzzy bunch at the back of their heads. The custom of tying the ' fatila ’ or slow match round the turban is dying out, as matchlocks are replaced by rifles. It is usual to go barefooted, but for long distances on the stony hill paths simple leather sandals are used. The principal Shekhs wear white jackets and cloured loin cloths, and silk turbans of bright colours, orange and red predominating. Every man carries either a rifle or matchlock, or a spear, and all wear the ‘ jimbea/ a broad curved dagger, in the waist cloth ; those of well-to-do people are handsome with chased silver sheaths. Men who own rifles wear a waist bandolier with cartridges. The women wear a loose robe with wide sleeves, generally dark blue, but sometimes green or red, embroidered round the collar, and down the front and back, and tied in at the waist by a sash of similar material, the embroidered ends of which hang down in front. They wear a dark head cloth which falls gracefully over the shoulders. They are not bad looking as a rule, but they often cover their faces and bodies with a yellow powder made from the ‘ war as ’ or bastard saffron, and ‘ Hurud ' (Hindustani llaldi) as a precaution against fever it is said, a most disguising habit. On occasions they paint their faces with designs in narrow black lints, and some daub their cheeks with a greasy pigment of a vermillion hue which gives a most unpleasing effect. The Arabs are content with simple fare. Their chief food consists of t bread made from wheat or millet ; ‘ asid ' a thick porridge made of fi ur with ‘ saman ’ (ghi, or clarified butter), and boiled goat’s flesh, or a soup called ‘ marak ’. Fowls and eggs are regarded as luxuries. As vegetables they take onions, garlic, carrots, and radishes. ‘ Helwa ’ is a sweetmeat made of honey, flour, milk and sugar. They drink coffee at all times, generally a concoction from the husk, called ‘ kashr ’ flavoured with ginger. The men smoke a great deal using ordinary hukas, and either Indian tobacco known as ‘ surati ’ or country tobacco called ‘ hanumi ’ which comes from Mokalla and elsewhere, and the best quality of which is called * arifi ’. All who can afford it are addicted to chewing ‘ kat The Arabs have very crude ideas of medical treatment. There are no Medifine . regular doctors, but some Seyids profess a knowledge of alchemy, and the use of herbs as medicines, and dispense extracts from the Koran as charms. The use of such amulets is very common, they are tied round children’s necks and arms, or hung in strings over their shoulders, each in little leather packet or silver case. They are even rolled up and administered as pills. It is usual to tie a charm round a horse’s neck.84 Barbers bleed and cup and perform circumcision. In the rainv season when fever is prevalent, a common cactus called ‘ kassas ’ is chopped up and mixed with food as a purgative. ^ For ulcers, which are very common, effusions from leaves are used and a brass plate is bound firmly over the sore. For aches and pains it is usual to sear the patient with a hot iron. Sanitary arrangements are very wanting. Latrines even in the best houses are merely projections from the wall in the upper storev the filth being allowed to accumulate below. ^ The religion of the country is that of the Shafi sect of Sunni Mu- Religion, etc. hammadans. I he masjids are kept with care, and the hours of prayer generally observed. Shrines are very numerous, every section of the population having one to which it is specially devoted. The shrines are either to a revered ancestor, or to some patron saint of ancient tradition. The position of ' mansab ’ in charge of a shrine is an honoured one, and is generally hereditary. The more sacred shrines are centres of pilgrimage. The pilgrims brin^ *a gift for the mansab who in return entertains them during their stay. &amp; Religious festivals are celebrated by meetings for the reading of the Koran, by processions with singing, and dancing and feasting? At the time of the Id-al-Fitr all business is suspended for 4 or 5 days. At Dala there is a process on of the inhabitants headed by the Amir, and accom panied by music and dancing. Rifle shooting then takes place, after which a goat or sheep is killed in every household. After sunset a bonfire is lighted on every roof. The ceremony of marriage is the simple ‘ nikah ’ rite. The parties hold one another’s hands in the presence of the kadi while he reads from the Koran, witnesses on both sides being present. The bridegroom is accom panied to and from the house of the bride by friends and relations dancing a rythmic dance to the sound of pipes and tom-toms, and firing guns. All joyous occasions are celebrated by feasting, slaying bullocks or sheep or goats, and eating ‘ kdt Professional minstrels are also called in to perform. A minstrel troupe consists of about half a dozen men and women who dance and sing to the pipe and tom-tom. The dance is a very active one, and by no means un graceful. Any solemn compact between tribes and individuals is sealed by the killing of a goat in the name of the Almighty. The Arabs are punctilious in matters of etiquette. A Shekh always receives any visitor of distinction with the ‘ Tashira ’ or salute of guns, with ball cartridge as a rule ; and he would consider himself slighted if the visitor did not accept his hospitality for at least a night. The ordinary mode of greeting between friends is to clasp hands and kiss the back of one another's hands. An inferior greeting a Shekh or Seyid will bend low and kiss him on the knee, and on the head and even on the back. Arabic is generally spoken but there are many local peculiarities of Language. dialect, and the language differs in many respects from the Arabic of Egypt. [C 57 MGIB] L*5 Tribes. The tribeships of the Amir of Dala’s terri tories may be grouped as follows :— The Amir's own relatives, connections and dependents. The Shairi. The Ahl Jihaf, Beni Said, and the Ahl Mafari. The Azraki and the Mihrabi. The Humedi and the Ahmadi. The Dakkam. The Halmin. The A 1 Ajud tribes. The Amir’s relatives, con- The Amir’s own clan are known as the Ahl neciions and depencents. Ahmad Or Ahl Cll Amir. They, together with related clans, the Beni Mas'ad^ Aval Murshid y Ayal Muthana, etc., live in Dala town, and in the Ash Shiraf district, in Zubed south of Dala, and in the districts of Tafwa in the liardaba valley and Kharafa in the Wadi Dabab. The other branches of the Amir’s clan are :— The Beni Hadi of the Ash Shiraf villages of Di Hiran, A 1 W'ara, Kokaba, 01 Sumed, and Ar Rabat; and of Kharafa. The Beni Mutahar of Kharafa and of the northern part of the Dala plain, viz., the villages of A 1 Husen, Marfad, Lakmat ash SlTub, Kubah, utaria, Sanah, etc. The Beni Shafoi of Dala, Zubed, Haiaz and Kharafa. The Beni Mar shad of Khobar and Minadi. The Beni Kasim of Dala, Harir, Tafwa and Kharafa. Besides the above there are a great many families who, though not blood connections of the Amir, are immediately subject to and dependent upon him. Such are the Bzni Abadi of Dala, the Ahl Amama and Beni Yakut al Kahaila al Janadba of A 1 Kabar, the Beni Jubari of Habil Di Ishar, the Beni Masha, Beni Habjur a.x\&amp; Beni al Hadidi oi Zubed. he Beni Juwer of Al Hajar and Al Kurb, the Ahl Said Ismail and Ahl Kurman of Marsaba, and the Beni al Komasi oi Laghwal. The people of Jabal Harir also come under the heading of immediate dependents of the Amir. They are of the r’aya class, and number about 800 souls. They were formerly under Yafa influence and are perhaps of Yafa origin. Other communities that are among the immediate dependents of the Amir are The Ahl Haj Said of Lakmat as Sallah, Sh’ab al As’ud, Ad Dabar, Bajaha and Hadida. They are a Seyid clan who claim to be descendants of Abdul Kadir Jailani. Haj Said was born in Hadramut; he became a darwesh, migrated and settled near Jabal Hadid, the spur of Jabal Jihaf above Lakmat as Sallah. He is said to have wrought many miracles ; his tomb is preserved with much veneration and his descendants are revered by the people of Dala as their special Seyids. The Ahl Haj Said number about 500 souls. The A bid of Hazat al A bid, a district comprising four villages, at the north-eastern foot of Jabal Jihaf, They are descendants of former slaves, and number about 600 souls The Ahl Basesi of Al Minadi, a clan of hereditary caravan guides and camel contractors who originally immigrated from Haushabi country.86 Some of them are still in Haushabi territory, some in Shairi country, and some in Yemen at places on the caravan route to Sana. Those of A1 Minadi number about 50 souls. Altogether, the immediate subjects of the Amir, probably number about 6,000 souls. The Ahl Jihaf ziz, a settled agricultural people inhabiting the main *1., t-u £ j au, c • central part of Jabal Jihaf. They number about 000 men capable or bearing arms ; and are divid- ed into about 30 clans, the most important of which are toe Zendani, the Abu Hadal, the Beni Nakib, and the Katrani. The Beni Said, origin not known, inhabit the south-western spur of Jabal Jihaf north of the Humedi, and number about 500 souls. Though not Seyids themselves they acknowledge as their chief Seyid Muhammad Taha, the present head of the family of Seyids descended from Abd-ar Kahman Abu Da’er whose shrine stands on the hill of Arshi just west of Dala. Seyid Muhammad Taha has perhaps more general influence among the different tritrships than any other man in the Amir of Dala’s territory and is a close adherent of the Amir. The Ahl Mafari, or Beni Hadeyan, who inhabit the southern spur of Jabal Jih-if, and are quite independent of the Ahl Jihaf though they maintain close relations with them, number about 150 men capable of bearing arms. They are a settled village population. The Azraki and Mihrabi of the valleys and hills south-west of Dala ate closely connected bv intermarriage and re lationship. The Mihrabi are said to be of Yafa origin. The Azraki are in two main divisions, the Sabah who originated from the Beni Saha of Yafa and the Murhebi from the Zedi of Hashid wa Bakil. The present Shekhs of the Azraki migrated from Yafa country some generations ago and usurped the authority of Shekhs after they had been settled among the tribe sometime. Part live in settled villages in the Azraki valley south-west of Dala, but the majority are nomadic, inhabiting the wild hill country south of Jabal Mashwara. The Azraki number about 400 men capable of bearing arms, the Mihrabi about 300. The Humedi who inhabit the south-western spur from Jabal Jihaf, and the Ahmadi of the Tiban and Tabaghain valleys and neighbouring hills, are also said to be of Yafa stock. Each numbers 400 to 500 men capable of bearing arms. The greater part are settled agriculturists. The- Dakkam of the plain country north-west of Jabal Jihaf, and Dakkani the Tiban valley west of Jabal Jihaf belonged originally to the Amur division of the Haus habi from whose country they migrated a few generations ago. They maintained themselves as an independent tribe until their country was in vaded by the Amir Shafal of Dala 30 to 40 years ago. They number about 300 men capable of bearing arms. The Shairi who inhabit the broken hills east of the Dala plain and the A 1 Hadar district fKhureba, Dimna, Mar- kula and Radua) south of the Khureba defile, though a separate tribe, have for a long time past been closely allied with Humedi and Ahmadi. Shairi.88 The Ahl Abdalla, located on the north-east slopes of the Radfan mountains have a special reputation as a fighting tribe. They number about 200 men capable of bearing arms, and are divided into clans the chief ot which are the Ahl Sh’aibi and the Ahl Kumali. The various Seyid communities settled in the Amir of Dala’s terri- Seyids. tories constitute a large and important ele ment in the population. Though generally looked up to as the priestly caste there is little in their outward appear ance to distinguish them from ordinary Arabs. Only a fe* of the princi pal ones who specially devote themselves to religious exercises wear white clothes and carry rosaries. The majority dress similarly to the Arab tribesmen, carry arms as they do, and occupy themselves with agri culture and trading. They are as much engaged in feuds and quarrels and as ready to resort to fighting. ^ ' The Seyid communities are generally wealthy and powerful and in most cases are practically independent. Seyids are permitted to marry women of other classes, but their own women may only marry Seyids. Ad Dubiyat —The Seyids of \d Dubiyat are of the branch of Seyids known as Sudan ’• who are said to have originated from Jibla near Ibb The tomb of the^r founder, Abu Sufian, is, however, at the village of Sufiaii near the capital of Lahej. They own a considerable extent of rich land and are very well to do and independent. They are greatly respected by all the people, and the shrine of Wali Hassan, the tomb of one of them who died 20 to 25 years ago, is the chief resort of pilgrims in the Amir of Dala's territories. The Seyids together with their'adherents (the Beni Mashali, Beni ITashid and Beni A 1 Anshali) and their slaves and dependents, number about 500 souls. Ahl Haj Said.—The Seyids of the Ahl Haj Said have been described above among the immediate dependents of the Amir. Seyids of Arshi.— (See Beni Said above.) //abil Al Jabr. The Seyids of Habil al Jabr are a small community only numbering about 50, under Seyids Abdalla Abdal Kawi, and Seyid Fadl of Al Karma. I am not sure whether the latter is the same as^ a Seyid of great influence who is known as Seyid Fadl bin Alawi of Sheib at Tern. These Seyids are associated in many ways with the Yafa across the Wadi Bana. Jews also constitute a considerable element in the population num- Jews. bering some thousands (Crawford says 5,000) Their largest settlements are in Dala itself (400) at Khurdi on Jabal Jihaf, at Al Malaha of the Shairi, and at Habil al Jilb at the foot of the Shaibi hills. They are treated by the Arabs with a good deal of contumely, and kept under various restrictions, such as not being allowed to own’land, nor to carry arms, nor to build houses of more than one story. Neverthe less they seem to be a fairly prosperous and contented community. They live in quarters set apart for them and support themselves as traders wea vers and artificers. ) The men are distinct from the Arabs in dress and appearance. They wear a white loin cloth, and a longitudinal garment with a hole in the centre by which it is passed over the head, the garment falling to the waistin front and behind, and being tied by strings at the side. On the head is a coloured skull cap and long locks of hair are brought down in front of the ears. They are industrious, submissive people, and many of them have good features, and not unpleasing appearance.90 CHAPTER III. Climate and Health. There is a difference of nearly 6,000 ft. between the highest and lowest altitudes in the Amir of Dala’s territory. It follows that there is much variety of climate. In the valleys of the Bana and the Tiban and in the low country south of the Dala heights the heat is severe during the greater part of the year, and the climate is malarious and ill-suited to Europeans. On the Dala plateau, the elevation of which varies from about 5,000 ft. to about 4,300 ft., the climate is comparatively cool and healthy, sufficiently so to suggest its suitability for a sanatorium for Aden. It is an equable climate ; no real cold in the winter months, and in summer the heat, though trying at times, was never very severe. 1 he lowest temperature recorded under the outer fly of a tent was 40° in February, the highest 102° in June. The diurnal range of temperature is often as much as 30° and over. The prevailing wind at all times of the year was from the south-east. The rainfall is precarious. It is not evenly distributed, and does not appear to depend upon any regular monsoon current, it nearly all falls during the months of June, July and August, and is in the form of sudden thunderstorms of short duration, and very local in their character. The total rainfall for 1902 was a little over 18 inches. From December to March, the air is fresh and clear, and fairly brac ing. Though there is practically no rain, a good deal ot moisture is fur nished by the regular morning mists, known by the Arabs as ‘ Am Amma. ’ This mist gathers in heavy masses in the valleys, and generally rolls up to the plateau with the southerly wind by about 8 or 9 in the morning, and is dispersed by the sun towards midday. Not infrequently thick wet mist forms during the night over the Dala plateau and lasts for the greater part of the day. A north wind blew at times in the morning and there was then no mist. In April and May there was much gusty wind, with dust, and occa sional thunderstorms. In May 1903 in the country about Kataba there was daily rain for a week or more. In June, July and August there was much atmospheric disturbance. Frequent thunderstorms with heavy rain and hail, generally in the after noon, made the air cool and pleasant. These storms seldom lasted for more than an hour or two. They circled round and came from all direc tions, but most frequently from the north and west. The mountain mass of Jabal Jihaf seemed to intercept many storms and prevent rain falling in the immediate neighbourhood of Dala, and the rainfall on Jabal Jihaf and in the plain country to the north appeared to be greater than at Dala. The hailstones do much damage to young crops, especially on Jabal Jihaf. The wind sometimes blew from the north for some days durino- the summer and autumn months and was accompanied by a good deal of haze. In July and August this wind brought large flights of locusts which were very destructive. September, October, and November were the most unhealthy months of the year. Malaria was very prevalent, not only among Europeans and natives of India, but also among the Arabs themselves. Anopheles mosquitoes were present, though not in great numbers from July to October. 19 * The most prevalent diseases among the troops were malaria, dysen tery, bronchitis, and boils. Much of the sickness was contracted while marching through the low-lying country, and much was due to exposure in tents, and would no doubt disappear under more favourable conditions. The following table of temperatures is from a record kept by Lieute nant Tandy, Royal Engineers, the thermometer being placed under the outer fly of a tent. Temperature at Dala.

The heights of Jabal Jihaf, 2,500 feet above the Dala plain offer, a much more bracing climate, with a much cooler temperature during the summer months. The establishment of a sanatorium for British troops is under consi deration; the site selected for experiment is near the village of Kama, 7,coo feet above sea level, and within about two and-a-half hours’ march of Dala by an easy camel road. The violent storms which visit Jabal Jihaf during July, August and September, and the cold weather mists, have been regarded as disadvan tages, but with good shelter they should do no harm.9 2 CHAPTER IV. Resources. Bare and rocky as the mountains of the Amir of Dala's country are, the Agriculture. fertility of the intervening valleys is often ^ surprising. In nearly all these valleys where the slopes are not too steep, there is a deposit of rich alluvial soil, and it ' s °! ne P arls spread over a wide extent. Every available foot of such ground ,s carefully cult.vated, the earth being retained'by a series of terraces. 1 he retaining walls are often of considerable height and solidity . St . a k ple cr!,ps 0f the J c ° untr y are rain-crops, and in order to utilise to the utmost the uncertain and often scanty rainfall every hillside and every undulation of the ground is drained in the required direction by water channels, s\mply constructed of loose stones or pebbles tnr, TVS 6 Sam6 f T P( S e u n V eWol]e of the Aguiar processes of agricul- tnlfe h ^ USe f° l^u M u ahar ’ a wooden board attached by chains to the alf mnn ]T nS fi ° 7 t 1 SOiI is scra P ed U P to f °rm a low bank fi Id tn d f h iv fie d &gt;E T ° P rev ® nt . scou ring the overflow channel from one fidd to another is often revetted with stone and built in steps. Phe plough oxen are of a good powerful breed ; the plough used is a S 7 PWltl ? an u T 0 1 n 'P 01nt ed j share. There is sometimes a wooden tube attached through which the seed is dropped into the furrow. Many of the fields are manured with cattle, sheep, and goat manure. Considerable labour is expended in weeding; the men work in rows digging up the earth between the furrows with short mattocks, or when the crop is one or two feet high a plough is driven between the rows, to root up^tlie weeds and loosen the soil; the oxen do not appear to injure the Crops- Tta chief crops are millets, vis., Dirra, Dukhn, the Indian Bajra. corres P ondin g to the Indian Jowari, and ,b;J nSpr, ; g f are r S 7 n ReS *' a white J° wari ; Gkarib, a coarse red Jowari, ch efly used for feeding cattle; a fine millet which grows in a seedTof 8 which ^ a smal !

[C 57 QMGIB] M93 _ , The leaves of Dirra and Dukhn, called ‘ Barash' are used as fodder for cattle, and he stalks for camels and horses. The finer dirra stalks are the best. A fairly plentiful supply is obtainable provided that transport is avail able to bring it in from a distance. It was however insufficient for the needs of the troops in 1903, when there were 2 mule batteries, besides several hundred camels. There is a fair amount of good ‘ dub’ grass on the Dala plain after the rain Kat is an irrigated crop on the production of which much labour is ex- pended. It grows in bushes not unlike small tea bushes, two or three feet high. The ten der leaves and shoots are chewed while still fresh by every Arab who can afford the luxury. Kftt has a slightly bitter taste, and its effect is stimulating with subse quent drowsiness. It is sold in bundles, each bundle a large handful. 5 bundles for a Real is the usual price in Dala, and is about the amount that a regular K 4 t-chewer wdll consume in a day. There are many Kat plantations on the Qala highlands, at about 4,000 to 5.000 feet, and it grows a good deal higher, the best being said to be that which comes from Taiz. It is found at about 3,000 feet in the Tiban Valley, and that is probably the lowest elevation at which it w ill grow well. Coffee is only grown in small quantities in the Amir of Dala’s territory ; C offce ^ the climate appears to be not so suitable as in other parts of Yemen. 1 here are a few small plantations in the neighbourhood of Dala ; in sheltered valleys on Jabal Jihaf, in the valleys east of Jabal Harir, and in some of the valleys of the Radfan mountains. I he Arabs themselves prefer coffee made from the husk (kashr) to coffee made from the berry (ban) saying that the latter is constipating. In Dala they often roast and grind berry and husk together. Ginger is generally added to the infusion, and sometimes salt. There is very little fruit grown in Dala territory, but grapes of very Fruit and vegetables. [air quaHty are brought in from the Mares hills, both w'hite and purple ; the best were white with no noticeable seeds. There are also obtainable figs, apricots, pea ches, pomegranates, melons, and limes. Plantains are grown in the Radfan Mountains. Potatoes of good quality are obtainable in large quantities from Yemen, and tomatos are grown at Kataba and elsewhere. Onions, leeks, radishes, etc., are growm in enclosed and irrigated gardens. Most English vege tables will flourish at Dala if well watered. Indigo (Arabic Hawar) is very largely used, the vats in which the Indigo. b' ue clothes universally worn by the Arabs are prepared may be seen by many of the village wells. A gloss is given to the dye by beating and pressing the cloth with boards. The indigo is imported. Some coming from Behan and other districts to the north-east. A small amount is said to be grown in the Radfan Mountains, and the Bana Valley. Most of the valleys are well wooded ; notably the Wadi Hardaba, the Wood trees. Wadi Kataba, the Wadi Haza, and the Wadi ... a l Azrak so that firewood is always plentiful provided that transport is available.94 The commonest tree is the ‘ Ulb/ the Indian ‘ Ber.’ Its yellow berries called ‘ doin/ are eaten by the people, the young branches are lopped off to feed goats and camels, or to form hedges round the fields ; it affords good timber and fuel and is highly valued by the Arabs. The frequent lopping of branches stunts their growth, but fine spteading trees, 40 to 50 feet in height,are not uncommon. There are several kinds of Ficus ; the ‘Sukum ’ which corresponds to the Indian Daman. The ‘ Balas,’ the edible g^een fig The ‘ Tolak,’ a fine tree, the best specimens of which are at Ad Dubiyat; and others. One of the commonest trees is the* Athab’ (In ban Timur), from the inner bark of which the Fatila, or tinder slow match is made. It is also a ficus, though like a willow in appearance. There are many kinds of Acacia, the Sumar, which corresponds to the Indian Babul, and others known as the Ashrak, Sirrahi, Du ha etc. Tamarisk (Athal) is common both in the valleys, and in the form of low scrub on the Dala Plain. Stunted Date Palms (Nakhla) are found in some valleys, and mats are made from their leaves. There are several kinds of Aloe, the commonest is a handsome red flowering variety. Jasmine, Daphne, and other flowering shrubs are found in the sheltered valleys. J he Adenium Obesum is very common, and conspicuous by its beau tiful crimson flowers ; it is at its best in October, as also-a prickly shrub called ‘ Shokh Rubah ’ or Monkey Thorn which bears a profusion of delicate mauve flowers. Quarries near Dala and in many other parts afford a practically g tono unlimited supply of excellent stone for build ing purposes. It is granite, grey or reddish. The Arabs are skilful in quarrying the stone by blasting, and squaring it in blocks for building their ‘ dars ' or stone towers. There are outcrops of lime in many parts of the hills. The Arabs pay much attention to bee-keeping. The hives in the D , . form of wooden cylinders two or three feet Bee-keeping. , . . ,, long may often be seen stacked near tne villages. Honey of good quality is produced, that from the small yellow flower of the ‘ kassas ' cactus is said to be the best. By arrangement between the villagers the hives are moved from the valleys up into the mountains and vice versa, according to the seasons when the plants most frequented by bees are in bloom. The hives are loaded on camels for the purpose. The transit trade between Aden and Yemen is the chief source of wealth to the inhabitants of Dala territory. A large proportion of them own camels which they let on hire. The chief contractors for caravans are the Basesi, a dan settled in Dala territory, whose head Shekh, Muthana ai Basesi, lives at AI Minadi, 8 miles north of Dala. Little is exported from Dala besides hides and skins, the preparation of which is the chief industry in Dala town itself. Imports from Aden are kerosine oil, spun yarn, cloths, tobacco, salt, dates, spices and many sundries. Imports from Yemen are coffee, grain, earthenware, etc. Commerce.05 The following numbers were given as the month!) averages of camel loads passing the Sanah custom-house : From Yemen to Data and Aden.

The weekly Market. market on Thursday is attended by people from every direction. On a well-attended market day the numbers coming in were counted and found to be approximately as follows men 2,300, camels 480, cattle ioo ; donkeys 450, sheep and goats 550. . ^ hese ambers are exclusive of those already in Dala. and numerous arrivals over mght The attendance is much smaller at the seasons at which agriculture claims the attention of the people A weekly market held every Tuesday at A1 Husen, 10 miles north of DaJa, is nearly as largely attended as that of Dala itself. The dealings at these bazars are chiefly in livestock, grain, coffee, kerosine oil, and cloths. Weaving is done exclusively by Jews. They use looms of simple Industries. construction, and only make cotton cloths of _ . f^e plainest texture. e only artificers are also Jews.

Only the Horse, and mules. principal Shekhs ride horses The few horses that are brought in to Dala from the country of Jof, 200 miles to the north, are coarse bred animals of an inferior type.

A goat or sheep for slaughter costs from 4 to 6 Reals. Large flocks are kept in the Wadi Kataba, in the Dakkam country, and in the southern Azraki conntry. There is no wheeled traffic in the Amir of Tala’s territory. The nar- Trang ort row roads only admit of pack transport on p camels or donkeys. Ibex are fairly numerous in the wilder parts of the hills. Horns mea- . . suring almost 48 inches have been obtained. In less precipitous parts a gazelle is found similar to the Indian Chinkara, but darker in colour. Baboons in large herds are frequently nut with and do considerable damage to crops. Conies inhabit crevices in the rocks and hares are numerous on the Dala plain. There are leopards, of a small, light coloured species, to judge from the skins I have seen. Hyaenas, civet cats, foxes, porcupines, hedgehogs, and rodents of various kinds are common. There are many snakes, a large pro portion of which are poisonous, and lizards in great variety. Of game birds, there is a very fine red legged partridge, larger than the Himalayan chukor, and differing from it in plumage, especially by its black crest. Guinea fowl are found in the valley of the Selat Kataba, and in the Wadi Makhran. A kind of small sand grouse is common in the more low-lying parts, and a small partridge like the sisi of northern India. Green pigeon are numerous. Seven varieties of wild duck were seen, also snipe, curlew, solitary plover and bustard (greater and lesser). r9 8 CHAPTER V. Communications. There are no roads, strictly speaking, in the Amir of Dalas’s territory. All the main lines of communication are tracks practicable for camel transport, and there are few parts which are inaccessible for camels. There are three main lines of approach from Aden to Dala— the Hardaba route, the Mashwara route, and the Tibau Valley route. Hardaba Route —The first is the most direct and the most generally used. The distance is 83 miles in 7 stages. It winds easily up the stony Hardaba Wadi, and gives a choice of the following three passes leading up to Dala. The Nakil RabtiLd, an ascent of 780 feet in a mile at a fairly easy gra dient. (This was the pass used for the regular passage of troops and convoys between Aden and Dala in 1902 and 1903, and the path was considerably improved. The Nakil Thoba, a.n ascent oi about 1,000 feet in a mile, more difficult than the Nakil Rabad, but slightly more direct. The Nakil Khureba, the pass generally used by caravans bound for Turkish Yemen. The actual steep ascent is about 600 feet in half a mile. There are remains of an old paved road in parts of the ascent. This pass is probably the one most capable of conversion into a good road. It leads direct to the village of Jalela, and as an approach to Dala itself is less direct by about a mile than the Nakil Rabad. Mashwara Route .—The Mashwara route is more difficult than the Hardaba route, and water is more scarce. The distance is 84 miles in 8 stages. The Mashwara Pass is much more difficult than the passes on the Hardaba route. It is only used by caravans as an alternative route with a view to escaping the exactions of the Radfan tribes. liban Fa/tey A0«te.~The Tiban Valley route, though circuitous, is in some respects the most favourable of all. The distance is 98 miles in 8 or 9 stages. It ascends the Tiban Valley to the junction of the Wadi Tabaghain, then turns up the Wadi Tabaghain and through the Azraki country to Dala. The water-supply is good and plentiful throughout, and the road offers no difficulty except the short pass of the Nakil Darja an Nishfi close to Dala. On the Dala plain easy paths lead in all directions. The main caravan route to Turkish Yemen runs from the head of the Nakil Khureba straight down the valley till it crosses the frontier near Kataba whence San’a is distant 9 marches via, the Nakil Hadda Pass, Yerini, Da mar, and W'alan. Paths practicable for camels, though none too easy, give access to Jabal Jihaf on the west of the Dala Plain and to the Shairi country and99 Jabal Harir on the east, and to the Shaibi country on the north-east. A good path with a ruling gradient of i in 8 has now been made from Dala to Jabal Jihaf by the Nakil as Sueda. There are two caravan routes which lead from Dala territory to the Yafa country. The easier branches east from Ar Radu’a in the Hardaba valley, 8 miles from Dala, goes to Dar al Jabr at the foot of the Halmin hills, then down the Selat Dabab southwards for 5 or 6 miles, then east wards over plain country south of the I almin hills, to Al Hajafand Danaba near Jabal Battar, then by a long descent into the Wadi Tern, and down the Tern valley to the Wadi Bana, and across it to the Southern Yafa country. Five stages from Dala to Al Kara. This route is joined in the Wadi Tem by an easy path from Jimil over a low pass, the Nakil ar Rabwa. The other route from Dala to the Yafa country leads from Dala itself down the Nakil Naima, or Nakil al Karn pass in the Shairi country down to Al Madi in the Halmin country ; crosses the difficult Nakil Set pass over the col which unites Jabal Harir on the north with Jabal Halmin on the south. Then down the winding Selat Shara to the Wadi Bana, and across it and up the passes leading to the northern and central Yafa country. Four stages from Dala to Mahjaba. There are two caravan routes which lead west from the Dala plain into Turkish Yemen. One leads through the Dakkam country north of Jabal Jihaf and up the Tiban valley and branches to Ibb and Taiz. The other goes down the Wadi Tabaghain, across the Tiban Valley and through the Amara country to Mavia, thence on to Taiz. A field telegraph was laid from Aden to Dala in the winter of IQ02- Telegraph line to Aden. ° 3 - u followed the line of the Hardaba route and the Nakil Rabad, and inter mediate telegraph offices were established at Bir am Saifi, Nobat Dukem, and Jimil. No great difficulties were encountered, but the hos tility of the tribes was the cause of frequent interruptions. On this account the line from Nobat Dukem to Dala was removed in July 1903. Heliographic communication was established in its place by means of an intermediate station at Dubiyat.■■■ 100 CHAPTER VI. Forts and Fortified Posts. {By Major Crawford.) For the purposes of intertribal warfare, each village may be considered a fort, each isolated dar a fortified post. Their sites are usually selected with a view to defensibility, often on a height or projecting spur when these are available, but as the question of water-supply is important and the wells are as a rule in the valleys beneath it is often impossible to make use of the best available tactical position owing to its distance from water. Hence it may and often does occur that a dar is commanded from an adjacent height within close musketry range. In the Amiri district the dars are solidly built of dry stone with walls tu'o to three feet thick, and a narrow staircase following an outside wall. In preparing foundations on a rocky site, a sloping surface instead of being levelled is merely built up with stones of gradually increasing size until the required breadth is ob tained, and these apparently insecure foundations seem to do very well. 'I here is usually a basement into which cattle are driven at night, a first and often a second floor for living rooms and a flat roof sometimes having a small reception room on the top. The windows are . merely narrow slits resembling loopholes and the roof is surrounded by a parapet of loose stones w hich can be tipped over or used as missiles on an enemy at close quarters. A courtyard with outbuildings is sometimes found attached to the better class dars {e.g. } Jarna) on Jabal Jihaf. When an addition or annexe is built no break of joint or bond is introduced between the new and original w-alls. it is evident that a village consisting of several of these dars close together {e.g., Jalela) is in a good posture for defence and could be rapidly strengthened into a fort by connecting the walls so as to form a continuous enceinte. The village of Kama on Jabal Jihaf appears to be the solitary instance in w'hich this has been adopted. Here one door gives access to the whole village, a small one on the edge of a cliff. Illustrations of three different types of dars are attached. Also as illustration of the block house erected in the Hardaba valley during 1903 by the Aden column. [C 57 QMCI 3 J NHistory. Little is known of the origin and early history of the Amirs of Dala. They are said to be descendants of “ Muwallads ” or half-caste slaves of the Imam of San’a. s Captain Warneford writes : “ The Amirs are descended from a slave cf one of the Imams, who about 300 years ago rose high in his master’s favour, and was made an Amir or General of his troops, being eventually given the district round Kataba to rule. When the power of the Imams declined, the Amirs made themselves independent.' The first of the line, Amir Hassan ash Shafali, ruled about 350 years ago, and, though succession is by election, the Amirship has remained in the same family ever since. The fact that the traditions of the western tribeships, who are said to be of Yafa origin, are chiefly concerned with resistance to Zedi invasions from the north, suggests the probability that the Amirship was founded by the Imam of San’a with a view to consolidating his influence in these parts in opposition to the rival power of the Yafa. The following is a .list of the Amirs, with the approximate date of their accessions. Its C( rrectness H far from certain ; many enquiries have been made but no two accounts agree :— Amir Hassan ash Shafali. „ Abd al Hadi „ Ahmad „ Kssslm ,, Ahmad ... „ Bubr&gt;kr ... ... „ Hassan „ Shafal ’Abd al Hadi ... ,, Sef ’Abd al Hadi (never actuallv ruied) „ Sli Mukbil ’Abd al Hadi „ Ahaif bin Sef Abd al Hadi A H. 982 (A.D. „ 1025 (A L). „ ? „ 1118 (A D. „ ? „ 1217 (A.D. „ 1270 (A.D. ,, 1291 (A.D. „ 1304 (A.D. 1574) 1615) 1706) 1801) J 853 ) 1872) 1885) The following is a list given by the present Amir himself : — Shafal bin Ahmad. Saleh bin Ahmad. Ahmad bin Shafal. Kasim bin Ahmad. Ahmad bin Kasim. Huren bin Ahmad. Bubakrbin Husen. Hassan bin Bubakr. Tahir bin Bubakr. Abd al Hadi bin Hassan, Mus 'ad bin Hassan. . Shafal bin Abd al Hadi. Aii Mukbil bin Abd al Hadi. Shaif bin Sef Abd al Hadi. v r inforn ;ant states The first Amir was Amir bin Ahmad al Yafa of Al Kara, and had two sons, Ahmad and Saleh. In the month of Kajab 9-2 A H. the Imam Hasan bin Kasim placed him in command of garnson 3 at Sulek, Husn ash Sh atil, Hardaba and Kharafa to guard theroads. Under him were placed Al&gt;u Bakr al Musalimi, Abu Umar ad Daghfali, the Beni Kotaib, all the country of the Ahl Aj’ud, and of the Halmin. The Amir was enjoined to protect the Scyids of Ad Dubiyat. Amir bin Ahmad’s successors w r ere :— Ahmad Amr. Kasim Ahmad. Bubakr Kasim. Hasan Bubakr. Abd al Hadi bin Hasan. Musa'd Hasan. Shafal Abd al Hadi. Ali Mukbil Shaif Sef.” Documents in possession of the present Amir show that his pre decessors were feudatories of the Imam up to shortly before the reconquest of Yemen by the Turks in 1872. They also prove that their territories and privileges extended beyond their present limits and included Kataba and the open country westward of that town, also certain payments and privileges at Damar, Taiz, Mavia, Ibb, and Uden. One of these docu ments is an edict dated 1 1 18 A.H. (A D. 1706) by the then Imam of San’a to Amir Ahmad bin Kasim ash Shafal ; and another to Amir Hasan bin Bubakr ash Shafal in 1217 A.H. .(A D. 3801). The original capital of the Amir was at a place called Arshi within a mile to the west of the pr&lt; sent town of Dala, it was subsequently moved to Al Haiaz about 3 miles north-east of the present town of Dala near Al Jalela. Shafal 'Abd al Hadi is said to be the last Amir who had his resi dence at Al Haiaz. • The relations of the Amirs of Dala wdth the British Government date from soon after the annexation of Aden by the British in 1839, when the Amir entered into an agreement by which he undertook to keep the roads open, and to be answerable for outrages committed by the tribes subject to him, in consideration of receiving an annual subsidy of $ 50. This agreement was renewed to Amir Ali Mukbil on his visiting Aden in 1880, and the stipend was increased to $ 100 in 1881. In 1872 Shafal bin Abd al Hadi was Amir of Dala. His death in i3 2 January of that year caused a division among the electors of the district in the choice of a successor. One party, mainly the inhabitants of the towns, including a number of the Amiri clan, elected Muhammad Musa’d ; the other, consisting of the peasants and cultivators, and many of the descendants of ’Abd al Hadi, chose Sef bin 'Abd al Hadi. Both candidates were lineal descendants of brothers, each of whom held the chieftainship—the former being the son of the last Amir but one, and the latter a brother of the lately deceased Amir. Sef died before the election was completed, and in April, 1872, 'Ali Mukbil, nephew of the late Amir Sha’fal was unanimously chosen ruler. Early in 1873 the wave of Turkish aggression began to approach the i8 borders of Dala territory, and Ali Mukbil was com pelled by force of circumstances to give in his sub mission to the Porte, but he previously expressed to the Resident at Aden his desire to adhere to his alliance with the British Government. A Turkish Muhafiz was installed at Dala, and the Amir was directed to pay 800 dollars a year to the Porte, receiving a stipend of 40 dollarBoth at this time and later frequent appeals were made to the Aden Residency for protection against Turkish aggression, but certain hostile influences appear to have been exercised to prevent the Resident being informed of the true state of affairs. It is probably due to underhand dealings by Saleh Jafir, the late Native Assistant Resident, that more active measures were not taken. Ali Mukbil himself went to Aden to lay his case before the Resident, and on his return to Dala he was summoned by the Kaim-Makam of Kataba and imprisoned, his uncle Muhammad Musa'd being appointed Mudir of Dala in his stead. Sef, the father of the present Amir, called upon the Yafa to assist hirn in obtaining Ali Mukbil’s release. They responded, sending a force of about 5.000 to Dala. The Turks despatched 200 to 310 men with a gun from Kataba against them. This force halted for the night at Minadi, and then took up a position on the rising ground between Jalela and Kabar. The Arabs at once attacked but the fire of the Turks was too much for them. They fled leaving, it is said, 70 dead on the ground, and the Yafa returned to their country. In consequence of strong ^ diplomatic representations by the British Government to the Porte, Ali Mukbil was released in January, 1874. The Turks however continued to support Muhammad Musa’d against him, and Ali Mukbil retired to Kharafa w r hile Muhammad Musa'd, in close alliance with Muthanna Muhammad, a Shairi Shekh, successfully maintained himself at Dala until he was killed when forcibly collecting taxes in Zubed. This occasion was taken advantage of by the Ottoman authorities to endeavour to persuade Ali Mukbil to cea^e re c lstance. On his refusal, Abdalla, son of Muhammad Musa’ci, was ap pointed his father’s successor, the Porte de claring that he had been elected by the people, and maintaining that Ali Muk bil was Amir of Khaiafa only. On the J7tb Rajab 1293 (October, 1875) the Governor-General of Yemen was compelled to acknowledge Ali Mukbil Amir of Dala, but he did so in such a way as to imply that the Amir held his position at the pleasure of the Ottoman Government, and the villages of Khobar, Minadi, Sh’ab al As'ud, and A 1 Wab'eh were retained by the Turks. Abdalla Muhammad Musa’d also continued to resist All Mukbil shutting himself up in his fortified house at Dala within 70 yards of Ali Mukbil’s tower. This ig g state of affairs continued until March 1878, when all Turkish countenance was wiih- drawn from Abdalla Muhammad Musa’d, and Ali Mukbil succeeded in driving him to take refuge in Turkish territory. He now resides at the Seyid settlement of Ash Sharaf in the Humedi country of the Wadi al Bun abstaining from all interference in the affairs of Dala. Meanwhile in 1877 the Resident at Aden had made a formrl proposal to the Wali of Yemen to settle the Dala question by arbitration, but the latter prevaricated and nothing resulted. In 1880 in recognition of the good offices of the Amir in the s fftlement i g go of disputes between the Abdali and Haushabi, he was presented with a howitzer, and the Aden Troop accompanied by an Assistant Resident visited the Dala district. The report by Lieutenant-Colonel Stevens Commanding the Aden Troop proves that Turkish occupation of Jabal Jihaf, of many Shairi villages, and of many Amiri villages on the Dala plain, including Jalela, wasio 4 len :ile n g ate sn. md ba of the ed, the •en rks the &gt;ng ;ish :bil nst 3 se led ‘d. to sal, ap : de- uk- the mir ion ar, ilia U P his 7 8 &gt; ith- in :he !un isal the ent ind er, the the airi ^as 1886. then a recognised fact. Again in i88.{, 50 sabres of the Aden Troop were sent to punish the Kotaibi for exactions on the Hardaba caravan route, and to help the Amir to re-assert his authority over them. This was accom plished in the month of July. Meanwhile, Turkish encroachment and intrigue continued with little interruption, and the Porte resisted or eluded all efforts made by the Foreign Office to bring about an amicable settlement by a delimitation of the frontier. In January, 1885, a Turkish force with a gun encamped between Al i8g Jakla and Al W’ara and forcibly levied tribute from the AM Haj Said and from the Ash Shiraf villages of Al W’ara, Di Hiran, Ar Rabat, Sirafi, Kokaba, and Ol Sumed. The Turkish authorities also put pressure upon theShairi Shekhs to seduce them from their allegiance to the Amir, and they sent an armed force up to Jabal Jihaf. In November 18^5 the Resident with 50 sabres of the Aden Troop visited Dala, but this did not check Turkish activity. In the summer of 1886 the Turks again established themselves near Al Jalela and now proceeded to build a fortified post and instal a regular garrison. They sent an expedition into the country of Mafari and Humedi south of Jabal Jihaf, but the tribesmen strenuously resisted and the Turks withdrew and contented themselves with intriguing, forming in each tribeship a faction which favoured defection from the Amir and submission to Turkish rule. On the 10th September 1886 Amir Ali Mukbil died, and his nephew, the present Amir, Shaif bin Sef, was elected to succeed him. The Turks from their base at Jalela continued to exact tribute from the Amir’s subjects of the Ash Shiraf villages, of Hazat Al Abid, and of the Wadi Safiya, and from the Shairi tribe, also, through their adherent, the Zendani chief, from the people of Jabal Jihaf. In 1887 the Amir complained of a threatening letter addressed by the la^e Mutasarif of Taiz to the Shekhs of Dala and in 1888 he found new causes of alarm in the intrigues of Seyid Radvvan of Ad Dubiyat with the Turks, and in the disaffection of his own brother Abdul Kawi of Al Kafla. With the aid of the Halmin and Aj’ud tribesmen he ejected the latter. In November 1888 in consequence of the irregular levying of dues on the caravan route by the various Chiefs, the Resident summoned a meeting at Al Mijba in the Alawi country, when the Amir among others subscribed to a schedule of rates to be levied in future. On the Dala plain affairs seem to have remained unaltered until the very existence of Turkish rule in Yemen was shaken by the rebel lion of 1891*92. The Turks, driven out of the Al Aud country, fell back on Kataba. They were followed up by the insurgents, and took refuge in Di Hiran, Dala, and other places in the Amir's territory. The Amir then collected several thousands of his followers, took up his position at Sanah, and occupied the line of the Wadi Kataba to withstand the further advance of the Zedi insurgents. The latter meanwhile took Kataba looting the treasury and the town but leaving the Arabs’ property untouched. They then found themselves checked by the Amir. He refused their demand for the surrender of the 1887. 18S8.105 Turks on the ground that they had cast themselves on his protection. After about a month large reinforcements reached the Turks, and the refugees returned to their original posts in Kataba and the neighbourhood. In return for these services the Turks appear to have restored to the Amir many of his rights which they had usurped. A Turkish regular garri son of 40 or 50 men was maintained at Jalela, and the place, together with the neighbouring Shairi villages of Lakmat A 1 Hajfar. Jalas and A 1 Wab’eh remained in possession of the Turks, but from this time forward the Amir had free access to his northern villages, to those of the Wadi as Safiya, Aid Haj Said, and Ash Shiraf districts, and he dr. w revenue without hin drance from them and from the greater part of the Shairi tribe, as well as from the Mafari, Humedi, Ahmadi, etc. In 1892-93 Captain (now Colonel) Wahab was employed in surveying the Aden hinterland, and in the course of the operations he visited Dala. '1 urkish influence was then so established and their occupation so far a recognised fact that besides Jalela and the surrounding Shairi villages, the villages of the Wadi Safiya, of Ash Shiraf, and those west of Dala at the foot of Jabal Jihaf, were pointed out to him as Turkish villages. Jabal Jihaf, and the country of the Mafari, the Azraki and the Mihrabi had come to be described in the Aden Residency records as Turkish, and as no suggestion t &gt; the contrary appears to have been made at this time, the error was carried on in the survey maps then made. The year 1900 was marked by the affair of Ad Dareja. An Arab named Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, an active agent of the Turks in their policy of expan sion, transgressing the Haushabi border from Mavia, established himself in a tower at Ad Daieji. Frequent protests to the Porte failing to effect his recall, an expedition was despatched from Aden in July to eject him. In the fight which ensued, although the Porte had expressly disowned Muhammad Nasir, the British force found itself in conflict with Turkish regular troops These however quickly withdrew and the tower was I9oI&gt; destroyed. The Yemen authorities chose to regard this affair as unprovoked British aggression, and as a result, the Porte, who had hitherto evaded all British proposals for the delimitation of the frontier, and had declined a suggestion made by the British ambassador only the year before, now themselves made a proposal to tliis effect. 1 1 was accepted by the British Govern ment, and negotiations were entered into with the Ottoman Government which led to the appointment of a j int Commission. At the time of the receipt of the Turkish proposal for delimitation (October 1901), Major Davies, Acting First Assistant Resident at Aden, had just been deputed to visit Dala and make enquiries on thespot about the Amiri border. ^ He reached Dala in November and was prevented by the Turkish officials from going anywhere beyond the immediate neigh bourhood of Dala town. He neverthele s ascertained that much which had hitherto been regarded as Turkish really belonged to the Amir, and that effective Turkish occupation was confined to the small group of Shairi villages in the centre of Dala plain. It also appears from his report that the Turks, evidently with a view to anticipating fair judgment by the Commission, had greatly strengthened their military position. The garri son of Jalela had been reinforced by about 400 men with 4 guns. Jabalio6 Shahad, a commanding eminence south of Jalela &gt; had been occupied and fortified, and a detachment with a gun had been pos'ed on Jabal Jihaf. This was the state of affairs when the British Commission, under 2 Colonel Waliab, arrived and encamped at Dala on the 26th January, 1902. The Turkish Commission arrived 3 weeks later, having been delayed by various causes. At the first meeting, the Turkish Commissioners advanced an extra vagant claim which included Jabal Harir, the whole of the Shairi, Jabal jihaf, the Mafari, Azraki, Mihrabi, Humedi and Ahmadi, and left to the Amir little of his territories beyond the town of Dala itself and the Hal min and A 1 Aj'ud countries. They drew a cordon of Arab levies at a short distance round the north of Dala town with orders to fire upon anyone w'ho attempted to pass from the British camp. They occupied Jabal Mafari with Arab levies, and when a protest was made reinforced them by regular troops. So uncompromising was their attitude that negotiations were broken off and the situation referred to Government. Strong diplomatic representations to the Porte proved ineffectual and* the unsatisfactory state of affairs lasted throughout the year. In December the Amir Shaif proceeded to India at the invitation of 1903. the Government, to attend the Delhi Durbar. He was accompanied by his son Sef and a few Shekhs and followers. The party returned in February 1903. In January 1903 a force consisting of the Dublin Fusibers, the 23rd Bombay Rifles, No. 6 British Mountain Battery, the Abbottabad Mountain Battery, two 7 pr. camel guns, and detachments of the Hampshire Rewi- ment, the 2nd Bombay Grenadiers, the Aden Troop, and the Bombay Sappers and Miners was concentrated at Dala, and military posts were established at Nobat Dukem and Dar Akkan in the Tiban valley. The ostensible object was to act as a support to the Commission in the event of a proposed move into the Yafa country to the north-east. Two cruisers of the Mediterranean squadron were retained at Aden. A field telegraph was laid from Aden to Dala. The effect^ upon the progress of the negotiations was soon apparent. The Furks received ordeis from Constantinople to evacuate all positions which they had occupied with military force subsequently to the agree ment between the British and Ottoman Governments to delimit 0 the frontier. They withdrew from Jabal Mafari, Jabal Jihaf, and Jabal Shahad, and in hebruary the British Commissioners with a strong escort visited those places, and the Ahl Haj Said district to verify the evacuation Further pressure induced the Porte to order its Commissioners to concede in principle the British claim for the Amir of Dala’s border and to withdraw from Jalela. This they did on the 21st March, retiring’with all their troops to Kataba. 0 c ,/ i ; he P° St at Jalela ' V3S occu P ied b Y a British detachment and the Bnti-h Commission advanced to Sanah, a mile and a half south of Kataba. . Here fresh differences of opinion arose as to the detailed interpie- tation 01 the British claim, and the Question had to be again referred to the Governments at London and Constantiuopie. In May 1903 outrages by some of the A 1 Aj’ud tribes upon the caravan route led to the despatch from Dala of a column consisting of 100107 Royal Dublin Fusiliers, 100, 23rd Bombay Rifles, and 4 guns, No. 6 Moun tain Battery accompanied by the Political Officer, and the Amir of Dataj to chastise the offenders. S )me resistance was offered by the Kotaibi, the Mahlai and the Deiri and by the Bakri, and Ahl Abdalla. The latter being the principal aggressors were punished by the destruction of the 4 towers constituting their village of Ad Dabra. All the tribes tendered their submission to the Amir. Pending the settlement of the points at issue on the Kataba border the joint Commission occupied itself with the delimitation of the Shaibi- Mares border, and survey parties visited the Shaibi Hills, and crossed the Wadi Bana to the Rubeaten country. These operations led to some hostilities with the Shaibi, and on the 13th September a force of 500 Yafa attacked the camp of the escort to the survey party on Jabal Awabil, but were repulsed with loss. The Kotaibi tribe meanwhile became more and more aggressive and a military post was established at Sulek at the junction of the Wadi ar Rabwa with the Wadi Hardaba, to check their raids upon the line of com munications. This post they attacked in force towards the end of Octo ber and closely invested it until, On the morning of th i 29th, the Sulek garrison was relieved by a force from Dala under Colonel Scallon. The British force further reinforced from Nobat Dukem to a strength of 800 Infantry and 10 guns then advanced under command of General Maitland into the Kotaibi country and severely punished the tribe by the destruction of many villages and towers in the Masra and Bujec valleys. The troops returned to Dala on the 15th November leaving a strong gar rison at Sulek. About a month later the Kotaibi Shekhs met the Political Officer by agreement at As Sulek but the : r attitude was so defiant that they were summarily dismissed with a threat of renewed hostilities. Later on they so far modified their demeanour as to return some rifles that had been captured at the time of the attack on Sulek. It was not till December 1903, that the frontier line of the Amir of Dala’s territory was finally settled between the British and Turkish Gov ernments. On the 16th of that month the joint commission marched from Sanah by the Tiban valley to the Haushabi country, erecting boun dary pillars as they wer.t Captain Warneford, Political Officer, remained at Dala with a force of British and Indian Infantry and a section of Artillery, while the re mainder of the troops were withdrawn to Musemir, In July 1904, owing to renewed restlessness on the part of the Kotaibi, a force was sent out from Aden, but active hostilities did not ensue. The present Amir of Dala Shaif bin Sef is between 50 and 60 years cf age and has five sons, the eldest, Nasir bin Shaif, is about 24 or 25, The Amir’s favourite son, Sef bin Shaif, is about 15.lo8 CHAPTER VIH. Administration. For more than 30 years Turkish aggression and intrigue has been undermining the authority of the Amirs in the greater part of their domin ions. Neither the present Amir nor his predecessor have known what it is to be free from this adverse influence, and it is not very clear what the Amir’s relations with some of the tribeships have been in normal times. ' Amir Shaif bin Sef is a capable ruler, and it is probable that, restored to his rights and confirmed in them by British support, he will exercise more real authority than former Amirs. His eldest son, Nasir bin Shaif, has often officiated as Amir during his father’s absence and has proved himself well qualified for the position. The Amir exercises immediate jurisdiction over his own kindred, adherents and dependents, that is to say, the inhabitants of Dala town and district of Jabal Harir, of the Ash Shiraf, As Safiya, Ahl Haj Said, Hazat al Abid, Lakmat Ash Sh’ub, Zubed, Tafwa, and Kharafa districts. He personally owns lands in many of the above and farms them out to various relatives, claiming a share of the produce for himself. This produce, together with tribute in kind from some of the tribes, goes to the maintenance of the Amir’s ‘ Asakir,’ or soldiery, and other dependents, to presents to Shekhs, and to the entertainment of visitors and guests. The various tribes under the Amir of Dala are to a great extent autonomous, but the election of their Shekhs is subject to the Amir’s approval^rtant matters and disputes between tribes are referred to the Amir’s arbitration. . . The principal Seyid communities are also to some extent autono- m0U The relations of the different tribes with the Amir are of varying degree^ ^ ac k now i e dg C the Amir as their chief, and pay him a regular sum annually for certain lands leased to them. The Dakkam pay no regular tribute, but their Shekhs visit Dala annually bringing presents in token of subjection. ^ The Mafari country is the Amir’s own property by gift from the Imam, as well as by sale from the Iladeyan Shekhs. The Amir appoints the Shekhs and they pay him revenue annually, in money and in kind, The Azraki are immediately subject to, and in close relations with, the Amir, they own lands in the proximity of Dala, paying to the Amir a quarter of the producers well as a regular annual tribute. The Mihrabi stand in similar relations to the Amir. .... . . 1 j • The Shairi are under the Amir’s jurisdiction, and he owns lands in their country. They pay no regular tribute, but are bound to join his standard in case of war. , , . j 1 1 j The Ahmadi and the Humedi both pay regulae tribute and acknowledge the Amir's authority. [C 57 QMGIB]109 The Amir claims to exercise jurisdiction oVer the Halmin and Aj’ud pibes, but they pay no revenue, and are to a great extent independent, only owing a sort of general allegiance to the Amir and being supposed to join his standard in time of war. In the case of the tribes who do not pay regular tribute, the Amir Helf. exercises the right' of ‘ Helf.’ This word which means literally ‘ Alliance' is used to express the compulsory entertainment by people of one whom they acknowledge as a chief and protector. The entertainment generally con sists in housing the chief and his followers and providing a goat for every ten men, and ‘ asid/ a thick porridge of flour, ghi, etc., for all. J he chief civil and criminal administration is in the hands of the Amir himself. When at Dala he holds court daily in his house, the “ Daral Haid. M Offenders are brought before him and witnesses and others whose attend ance is required are summoned by a crier from the top of his tower bv name. Civil suits are brought before him for arbitration by contending parties who are not however bound to submit to his decision/ If dissatis fied they can claim to have the matter decided by Koranic law and take the case before the Kadi (at Khobar) against whose decision they can further refer to the Kadis at Jibla. In some cases the issue is at once referred to Jibla. Either party refusing to accept the decision of the Jibla court, would be punished by imprisonment. Arrests are effected by the Amir s Asakir or armed retainers, and offenders are imprisoned in a dungeon below the Dar al Haid. There is no code other than the Koranic: law. Arwa is a term signifying a formal appeal to the Amir for justice or protection or the granting of a petition, emphasized by the slaying of a bullock in his presence as an offering. T. he office of Kadi is hereditary. The Kadis receive no regular Kadis. stipend but are assigned fees from the losing r s , e a cas e, and they receive occasional presents from the Amir. The late Kadi of Al Khobar, Abd al Karim bin Muhammad al Abdi was held in high esteem. He died in May 1902 and m the minority of his son, the office is held by his brother, Abd ar Rahim who does not however possess the same degree of influence. The other Kadi of Dala is Abd Al Kawi who lives on Jabal Harir. He is in bad odour for taking bribes. Some tribes have their own Kadis ; Muhammad Khalid of As Salab is Kadi of the Humedi, and one Abdalla Humadi is Kadi of the Seyids of Ad Dubiyat. Their authority is however small, all important cases' bein&lt;r referred either to the Kadi of Al Khobar or to the court at Jibla. &amp; An institution of the Imam's which seems to have outlived all changes Court of Appeal. is a high court of appeal for all Yemen. It is ,, fl , „ Et J lbla Ib . b &gt; and is constituted by an assembly of learned Kadis. Their decision is final in all cases. This is recognised by the Arabs everywhere, and their udgments are executed bv the Arair as well as by the Shekhs of Turkish Yemen. The head of this court is Ai Kadi Abdal Wahab bin Ahmad al Musannif. Important cases are often referred direct to this court F dSCS The government of village communities is deputed to ‘Akils’ who are responsible to the Amir or to their Shekhs for the maintenance of order and the payment of dues. cc 01no Manslaughter in pursuance of blood-feuds is common. The feud is sometimes allowed to take its course, but the Punishrr.ent of offences. matter can be, and often is, settled by the pay ment of‘diva' or blood money. The relatives of a murdered man have the riaht of killing the murderer. The latter when arrested is ta.cen to the grave^of his victim whose relatives may then demand his death, or the payment of “ diya,” or may condone the offence. . The full “diya' is a sum of $770 or 100 camels. The delinquent if unable to pay appeals to his relatives, and if they fail to satisfy the claim, his property is mortgaged to the relatives of the murdered man. n a case of manslaughter the relatives may claim a sum not exceeding halt ^ Adultery or assault are punished by a fine of $75 or failing payment Robbery and other offences are punished by imprisonment, the culprit beino- sometimes tied in a constrained position and exposed to the cold ; by finest and sometimes, though rarely, by the loss of a hand. Imprisonment is also inflicted for debt. For the continuance of a quarrel which has-been formally settled by arbitration, both parties are im prisoned and only released on payment of a fine to the Amir. , The assessment of crops is made by the Amir who, a little before harvest time, personally visits the districts in Assessment. which he claims a proportion of the_ produce. In the absence of the Amir the assessment is made by his son or his orincipal agent, one Muhammad Said. . . . o c P The Amir takes half the produce from Jaba Hanr, the As Safiya, Zubed, Tafwa, and Kharafa districts. One-tenth from the Ash Shiraf dis trict. and the Az Zanad lands. The weekly market at Dala is an important source of revenue to ^ the Amir. He employs agents to collect dues as follows 1 kasa (5 lbs.) Market dues. For every 12 kasa of grain that changes hands For every camel load of kerosine oil, t.e., 4 cases, the price being 16 Reals ... ••• ••• For every camel load of dates ••• For every camel load of coffee ••• ••• For every camel load of ghi (saman) For every camel load of skins (usually 320 goats skins) For every 8 sheep or goats For every camel sold ...

The Turks have endeavoured to introduce the Majidiya coinage, valuing the dollar at 2 Rupees, but it has not proved acceptable to tbe Arabs. nrI 12 CHAPTER IX. Military. There is no military organisation in the Amir of Dala’s territories. The Amir maintains about 100 ‘ asakir ' or armed retainers, some of whom remain at Dala in attendance on the Amir, and others garrison Jabal Harir, Kharafa and other outlying parts, or collect dues at frontier posts. They act as escort to visitors, and form the nucleus of the force of tribes men in case of inter-tribal warfare. . The c kabail ' or tribesmen form the real fighting force of the country. It is estimated that under the most favourable circumstances the Amir could collect 6,000 to 7,000 men at one time nearly all armed with rities or matchlocks. Their only skill in fighting consists in quickness of move ment among the rocky hills and cleverness in taking advantage of cover or occupying commanding positions. They often managed to keep up a hot fire upon our troops without a single man exposing himself to view. They accompany their movements with a shrill cry. , • • a The Arabs are arrant braggarts, and are fond of describing their inter tribal conflicts as sanguinary affairs, but enquiry shows that the casualties seldom exceed two or three a side. * . . f Most of the tribesmen are now armed with rifles. By far the greater number of these are short French Gras rifles (modele 1 866-70) sighted up to 1,000 metres, imported from Jibuti. Most aire marked Manufacture d’ArmesSb Etienne/’ The outside puce paid for one of them is 20 Reals and this includes a bandolier and 20 cartridges. Ammunition alone sells in Dala at the rate of 10 rounds for a Real. There are also among the Amir’s followers about a hundred Martini-Henry and Martim-Peabody Rifles, the latter obtained from time to time from Turkish deserters, a few Remingtons, and a few converted Sniders. , Many of the Arabs keep in practice by shooting game, and firing at marks and can make good use of their rifles. Ignorance of the use o sights generally prevents their fire from being accurate at any but point blank ranges. During the fighting in the A 1 A jud country in November 1003 it was observed that the tribesmen had evidently ranged upon certain well marked points beforehand and made good shooting in consequence. Martini-Henry rifles are called by the Arabs ‘ Marti/ Martin,-Peabody ‘Turk/. Gras Rifles ‘ Fransawi’ (French), Remingtons ‘Missen’ (Egyptian). Sniders ‘ Tabak’; and all Magazine Rifles ‘ Mesar, a corruption of Mauser. Martini Rifles are valued at about 40 Reals. Those who have not n Aes carry omr matchlock muskets generally ornamented with silver studs and bands, ind^e butts sometimes inlaid with ivory. The other arms of the Arabs are simple light spears, and the curved dagger known as Jimbea They some times use these in ambushing an enemy, but they rarely join hand to hand in open fight. Only Shekhs of distinction carry swords. The Arab • dars • or stone houses are generally built and situated with a view to defence They are solidly constructed square buildings from two to four storeys in height with a parapet round the roof. The windows small, l ke 'Rough stone ‘ sangars ’ are built to defend approaches.1*5 DALA— Lat. Long. 44 0 43' E. Elevation, 4,900 feet. Gene-ai The town of Dala with the residence of the Amir stands at the head of an op^n high-lying valley which falls away gently to the north, drain ing to the Selat Ixataba, and so to the Wadi Tiban. This valley extends about 10 miles from north to south and is on an average 3 miles in width. Its central part is called Wadi-as-Safiya. The chief tributaries to the Wadi-as-Safiya are the Wadi Insham and Wadi Ghosha draining the lands between Dala and Kabar. Wadi Anama and Wadi Laf drain ing the Ash Shiraf district. Wadi Rahban and Wadi Sirr from Dala past Jalela. Tne Wadi Dahira and the Wadi Haslab draining the northernmost part of the Shairi country and the Muflahai district of Khalla. The Wadi Suhal draining the lands of Al Husen, Marfad, and Khobar. The Wadi Haza closely skirting the north-eastern foot of Jabal Jihaf. The greater part of these are mere depressions without any marked watercourse. In contrast to the rugged mountains which enclose it on all sides this country has the appearance of a plain, but the surface is broken by numerous rocky eminences, and broad “ habils ' as the stony undulations are called ; these are clothed with a scattered growth of thorn, cactus, aloe, etc. The intermediate depressions contain rich alluvial soil, and are nearly all carefully cultivated. In some parts they are well wooded with the common “ Ulb ”, (the “ Ber ” of India) as well as with a variety of acacias, wild figs, etc. There are some low-lying parts (east of Jabal-as-Soda and in the Wadi Haza), which are wooded with tamarisk, and which become very swampy after rain, and are incapable of cultivation. The northern part of the Dala plateau, as this valley is commonly called, has more the nature of a plain, than the southern, and there are wider stretches of cultivable soil, but also of barren stony and sandy ground. The numerous villages are solidly built of stone, and most are perched on rocky eminences. The best general view is obtained from the peak of Jabal Di Bet which rises steeply a little to the east of Dala town. To the west and north-west the view is limited by the precipitous sides and rugged spurs of Jabal Jihaf. Of the numerous villages on that mountain the only ones visible are those near its eastern foot; Al Haud, and An Nukahi. A north-eastern spur of Jabal Jihaf with the twin peaks of Adina and Ad Dubeli stands out boldly just to the north of the Ash Shiraf villages (Di Hiran, Al W'ara, &amp;c.) and hides from view the Ahl Haj Said, Hazat al Abid, and Sanah districts. Far beyond this spur is seen the jagged outline of Jabal Matrah, the most westerly of the Mares Mountains, and the part of the Al Aud hills, which is crossed by the Nakil Hadda pass, while in the far distance may be seen the fine peak of Jabal Shakhab Amma, 10,800 feet high, like a great dome with a pinnacle of sheer rock rising from its apex. The mountain wall of Mares and Shaib extends across the northern horizon till to the north-east it breaks into the lower ridge of Jabal Awabil where is the only approach to the Shaibi country practicable¥ Jabal S ha- had. Kharba ridgp. Communi cations on the pla teau. 116 for troops. The crest line then rises to the flat-topped ridge of Jaba Harir which bounds the view to the east. Enclosed in this amphitheatre of mountains lies the Dala plateau. Its eastern part is broken by tbe rocky ridges of the Shairi country which rise to a high peak at their southern end, \\hile north of them Jabal Akram of the Muflahai (Yafa) stands conspicuous. Immediately north-east of Dala town is a mass of rocky hills which hide from view the open plain at the head of the Khureba pass. Just beyond these hills to the north stands the commanding isolated hill Jabal Shahad, which over-looks all routes across the plateau from Dala, and from the Khureba pass, and which was fortified and occupied by the Turks throughout 1902. In the plain that lies stretched below as one looks north from Jabal Di Bet, the village of A 1 Kabar on a conical hill is a central object a mile distant. Half a mile further north is the shrine of Wali Shafi, which stands at the eastern foot of the Kharba ridge : this is a narrow sharp crested ridge which rises 150 to 200 feet above the plain, and lies across it east and west about £ a mile in length. Near its western end, not far from the foot of Jabal Jihaf is another abrupt rocky hill on which stands the village of Ar Rabat. Looking past the eastern side of A 1 Kabar, and about a mile beyond it A 1 Jalela is seen, on a low ridge which runs north-w'est from Jabal Shahad. ^ , A mile and a half north of A 1 Jalela another isolated hill, Jabahas Soda, similar in appearance to Jabal Shahad rises from the middle of the plain. Kataba is visible on a clear day, the direction being over Wali Shafi and the low hills near Sirafi. Over the western shoulder of Jabal-as-Soda 3 towers on a ridge mark the position of Lakmat Ash Sh’ub, and still further A 1 Ukla may be discerned at the foot of the Mares hills. Over the eastern shoulder of Jabal Shahad, A 1 Husen, where a weekly Tuesday market is held, may be seen on a spur which runs west from Jabal Akram. The main route from Dala to Kataba goes past A 1 Kabar, and A 1 Jalela, passes east of Jabal-as-Soda, and joining the main caravan route by the Nakil Khureba goes north passing near the Shairi villages of Lakmat A 1 Hajfar, Jalas, and A 1 Wab’eh, passes west of A 1 Minadi and Af Khobar, and east of Sanah. An alternative path almost equally good goes from Jalela, west of Jabal-as-Soda, and cuts into the first near Jalas. .5- The distance from Dala to Kataba is 12 miles. Another route on leaving Dala crosses the‘ habils ’ on the western side of the valley, goes by Ar Rabat, A 1 W’ara, Kaukaba and Sirafi, thence skirts the foot of Jabal Jihaf passing Shab-al-As'ud, and Bajaha, and going dowm the Wadi Haza, whence it branches either north to Kataba or west by Habil-as-Suk to the Tiban valley. This route is a good deal more winding and rougher than the first. A somewhat rough path leads along the foot of the Shairi hills to A Husen. There are many lateral communications, paths between all villages.*3\ 117 The path from Dala to the Shairi country and the Nakil Khureba leads past A 1 Kabar, and passes south of Jabal Shahad ; a direct path also goes east from A 1 Kabar, over a low pass, practicable for camels, to A 1 Kuren, and the Nakil Khureba. Another path goes east from Dala to A 1 Jarba, then down the Selat Jarba (rather rough), to the Shairi country. The approaches from the low country to the Dala district are as follows: 1. Nakil Khureba .—See Route I. A regular caravan pass, ascent 700 feet in a mile. There are traces of an old paved road. Path commanded Approach- by rocky hills on either side; at the head of the pass, emerges on to a es to the cultivated p’ain in view of Jabal Shihad at a distance of about a mile. DaIa P la * Near the head of the pass is the shrine of Wali Idrus, and the ruined village of Shamsan. There are two paths from A 1 Khureba by which the pass may be turned, one is : — A steep winding footpath ascending the west side of the gorge to A! Jarba whence easy paths branch to all parts of the plateau. The other, also a steep winding foot-path ascends the east side, and at the top joins a good easy path which, coming from Dakar on the south leads north to A 1 Ushari and A 1 Kuren. Another steep foot-path leads from Ad Dimna up to Dakar, thence easy to A 1 Kuren. 2. Nakil al-Hakl —Up the next gorge to the west of the A 1 Khureba gorge. A foot-path only. The path is good and easy up the water-course to about half a mile past A 1 Hakl, it then begins to wind steeply up over boulders in a narrow ravine, very steep in parts, quite unfit for pack transport. The ascent is 850 feet up from Al Hakl. The steep part takes f of an hour on foot. The pass can be turned by two paths leading up on to the range which, running south from Al Jarba, divides the Ai Khureba valley from the Al Hakl valley. One of these paths leaves the main water-course half a mile north of Ad Dimna, and branching to the right winds up steeply for about a mile, then leads north to Al Jarba at easy gradients along the top of the range. The other path goes steeply up eastwards from Al Hakl, and after an ascent of 800 feet joins the path from Ad Dimna and leads to AI Jarba. Both these paths could be fitted for pack transport with a moderate amount of labour. Al Jarba can also be reached from Al Hakl, by a stiff climb up a big ravine just north of Al Hakl to the right of the main path. 3. Nakil Rabad.— See. Route !. The main pass on the route from Aden to Dala. A good easy camel path. Ascent about 800 feet, and takes camels nearly an hour. The top of the ascent is about a mile from Kaflat Zubed. A good road leads past that place, and on up a cultivated valley, Wadi Diak, to Dala. Another path fit for pack transport, and could be easily improved leads from the top of the ascent, by the village of Laghwal direct to Al Kabar and Al Jalela. Rabad foot-path to Zubed .—There is also a steep foot-path leading up to Kaflat Zubed, from the Selat Rabad,118 4. An alternative to the Ar Rabad NaVi!. The path branches from the regular Aden-Dala route at A 1 Hamra, in the Wadi Hardaba and goes up the water-course past the village of At Thoba. The ascent is longer and steeper than the Nakil Rabad, and is fit for lightly laden camels. The top of the ascent is near Az Zanad, and is a good deal higher than the top of the Nakil Rabad ; an easy path leads down to Kaflat Zubed, and so on to Dala. 5. Nakil Tuwana. —See Route I. A stiff pass, approached from JimilupSelat Tuwana. Ascends to A 1 Hukal, near Az Zanad, total ascent i,8oo feet. Thence path leads by Az Zanad and Zubed to Dala. 6. The following paths lead up to Ad Dubiyat, and so give access to Dala. Nakil Satab. —Path from Jimil leads up the Tuwana water-course past Tuwana and Satab, and two paths lead up to Ad Dubiyat, one a foot-path the other practicable for lightly laden camels. Nakil Duba. —Branches from the Mashwara route a little below Khushan. and leads vid Sum’an, and A 1 Alaya to Dubiyat. Camels use this pass but it is steep and difficult. 7. Nakil Shab-al-Ashar. —From Ad Dakka near Ad Darb in the Azraki country a path leads east up the Selat Maksa for a mile, then branches up a tributary water-course, the Selat ar Rida, to Az Zanad. Practicable for camels, but rocky and steep. A foot-path to Kaflat Zubed continues straight up the Selat Maksa ; this could be made into a camel road by a little blasting in one or two places. 8. Nakil Darja an Nishfi. —See Routes III and IV. The pass by which the Mashwara route ascends to Dala from the Azraki country. Regularly used by laden camels, but the path is much in need of repair. The ascent is up a narrow ravine between precipitous crags, and there is a stream. Ascent of the Pass is 450 feet. 9. Another, rather rough camel path leads from the Wadi al-Bun, and the Humedi country, across a ridge to the head of the Nakil-Darja an Nishfi. 10. Nakil Na'ima. —Pass from the Halminto the Shairi country. Path leads from the Selat Dabab up a narrow ravine westwards, past Na’ima to A 1 Kariya near the head of the ascent, thence vid A 1 Ushari, and Al Kuren to Al Jalela or Dala. Practicable for camels, a regularly used route from the Halmin country. Water. —The Dala plateau possesses no perennial streams ; only a few small ones run in the valleys during the rainy season and for a few weeks after. Numerous wells furnish water sufficient for the needs of the people and for irrigating a few gardens. Near Dala town the water is not far from the surface, the wells being 20 to 50 feet to the water. In the northern part of the valley the wells are much fewer in number and are often as much as 70 or 80 feet to the water. In the Wadi Haza however water is plentiful and there are 4 or 5 wells, the water 20 to 30 feet below the surface.I !9 Camping Ground, —The best campiug grounds in the Dala district are On the fields north and east of Dala town and near A 1 Kabar, or on the stonv uplands (habils) on the western side of the valley, near the foot of jabal Jihaf, from near Dala on the south to Kokaba on the north. On fields and uplands near A 1 Jalela. Water from wells which are numerous in all this southern part of the valley. In the northern part of the Dala plain the best camping ground is on some high lying stony ground a mile south of Sanah. Water from Bir Mandal, a good well, water 25 to 30 feet below the surface ; further supply from the wells of the Hazat-al-Abid villages! mile to I mile distant. Dala town, —The residence of the Amir is called Dar A 1 Haid. It consists of a small group of “ dars ' or stone towers Dala town. stands on the top of a rocky hill. The town clusters at the northern foot of this hill, and partly up its slopes about 200 feet below'. It is compactly built and consists of about ^2c houses, most of which are solidly constructed square stone dars, 'j or 4 storeys in height, but about a quarter are the less pretentious houses of Jews. The streets are narrow, irregular and dirty. On the western side of the town is an open space where the weekly market is held, and the J'ews prepare thread for weaving, and beside it the Jews' quarter and synagogue. On the eastern side is a smaller open space where skins are dried and cured, and beyond it another small Jewish quarter. On the northern side of the town is the principal mosque, with a white topped minaret. There is also a mosque at a little distance to the north, with a grave-yard beside it and a shrine, Wali JVhuthanna Abdul Hamid ; also several outlying “ dars' on slight eminences. Half a mile to the west on a hill, is a shrine, Wali Abu Dar. The ground right up to the towm is terraced for cultivation. On the southern side of the hilt is the village of Habil Di Ishar, a suburb of Dala. Population. —The Arab population of Dala numbers about 2,000 souls. The Jew' population about 4 0 °- Most of the Arabs are agriculturists. Weaving is the principal occu pation of the Jew's. The principal merchants number 30 Arabs, and 6 Jews: about 100 Arabs, and 15 Jews are traders on a smaller scale. There are very few artificers ; 3 or 4 Jews and 1 or 2 Arabs work as silversmiths and blacksmiths, but their work is only of the simplest kind. The chiet industry among the Arabs is the preparation of skins for export.120 The inhabitants of the Amir’s residence on the top of the hill number about and consist ofthe Amir’s own family (5 sons), his brother Abdal Kawi’s family, the late Amir AH Mukbil's family; slaves, and retainers (Asakar). The principal inhabitants of the town are relations of the Amir, num bering about 150, viz.) the families of:—A1 Haj Murshid, Muhammad Musa d, Muhammad Muthanna, Muhammad Hassan, Saleh Musa'd, Kassim Hassan, Musa’d Muhammad, Husen Thabit, Hassan Muthanna, Ahmad Muthanna, Husen Muthanna and Mukbil Hassan. The other leading families, not of the Amir , s own kin are the Beni Abadi, and the Ayal Farah Majali, 225 in number. Also see Part I, Chapter 5. Dcila market. A weekly market is held on Thursdays, and is attended by people from all directions. Traffic is principally i'n livestock, grain, skins, oil, coffee and cloths. Notes were made as follows of the numbers of men and animals com ing to and leaving the Dala market. They were, however, made a little before the Id festival, which is by far the busiest time.

The district consists of broken stony hills with fertile valleys bet* ween. The main valley is the Wadi Diak. The route from Dala runs down this valley over a succession of terraced fields to Kaflat Zubed, 3 miles. Here is a wide extent of cultivated ground, and the valley turning eastwards, drains to the Azraki country under the name of the Selat Maks a. The main route, turning westwards at Kaflat Zubed, descends by the Nakil Rabad to the Hardaba valley. A foot-path leads from Kaflat Zubed down the Selat Maksa to Ad Dakka in the Azraki valley. Camels must go by Az Zanad and the Selat ar Rida. The head Shekh of the district is Kasim Saleh of Kaflat Zubed. The villages are as follows :— Kaflat Zubed. —Twenty-five towers and 30 smaller houses.. Shekhs of Beni Mashba and Beni Hassan Fadl. Other families of Beni A 1 Harlidi, Beni A 1 Ma’ri, Beni A 1 J’adi and Beni Shafal or Ahl A 1 Amir. Estimated population 250, Laghwal .—Eight towers and 15 smaller houses. Half a mile east of Kaflat Zubed, near the edge of the A 1 Hakl ravine. An alternative route from the Nakil Rabad to Dala leads by Laghwal (this route is the better one for troops camped north of Dala to use). Estimated population 150; Beni Habjur. Marsaba .—On the opposite side of the Wadi Diak to Kaflat Zubed \ mile West of the latter. Six towers and 20 smaller houses of Ahl Said Ismail, Ahl Kurman, Ahl Shodabi, Ahl Jabari and Ahl Hurkam. Estimated population 120. Al Hajar.—YinM a mile up the Wadi Diak from Marsaba, and to the west. Two towers and to smaller houses. Beni Juwer and others. Esti mated population 40. Al Kurb .—In a sheltered cultivated valley among the hills, west of the route from Dala to Kaflat Zubed, near Al Hajar. The lands of Al Kurb drain by a narrow gorge west to the Azraki valley; and a path leads down to Dar Matahin. Ten towers and 20 smaller houses; Ashraf and Beni Al Wajia, Beni Al Johar, Beni Juwer, Beni Abdul and Beni Sharafi. Estimated population 130. Dar Lislaf .—In an enclosed valley just south of Dala town. Two towers and 4 smaller houses, Beni Ad’ur. Estimated population 25, Habil Di Ishar .—Close to Dala town, 10 towers, and 25 smaller houses, Beni Jubari. Estimated population 200.•zanAd— An open valley or plain 4 miles south of Dala, constituting a small district of Dala. The plain is about square miles in extent, and there are only about 6 scattered towers upon it and a few small houses. The ground drains west to the Selat ar Rida, and so by the Selat Maksa to the Azraki valley. Across a stony ridge to the south-east, in a narrow valley draining to the Hardaba is the small village of Di Anas which belongs to the Az Zanad district; a little coffee is grown. Di Anas is at the foot of the abrupt peak of Jabal Dabub, and a steep foot path leads down by some ancient ruins called As Safra, to A 1 Hamra in the Hardaba valley. The population of Az Zanad numbers about 120 souls, and consists partly of Ayal Ashraf of Ad Dubiyat under Said Abad Mehrabi, and partly of R’aya and Abid of the Amir of Dala who are under Shekh Kasim of Zubed. The families of the Amir's subjects are the Ayal Talib Hanash Ai jadi, and the Beni Mas'ud. The soil of the Az Zanad plain is poor and shallow, and there is little water, 2 wells; and in Sh’ab Milah below the eastern edge of the plateau is a spring forming a good pool of clear water. At the north-eastern corner of the Az Zanad plain is the head of the Nakil 1 hoba pass which leads down into the Hardaba route. A rough path, practicable for camels, goes west down the Selat ar Rida and the Selat Maksa to the Azraki valley.iftJBIYAT— The tongue of broken highland which projects lo miles to the south from Dala reaches its greatest elevation in the plateau of Ad Dubiyat at its southern extremity. The plateau is irregular, about square miles in extent. The greater part is bare, and stony or rocky. On the north the ground is in the form of an amphitheatre draining to the west, and containing a basin of fertile soil which is cultivated in terraced fields. The southern part is more in the nature of a tableland with flat ledges, partly of bare rock, partly of cultivated ground, a sort of shelf which terminates on the south in abrupt precipices of sheer rock. The whole plateau slopes gradually up to the culminating point at its eastern end, the rocky hill on which stands the white shrine of Wali Hassan. Most of the drainage goes west through the amphitheatre above described, and down to the Selat Tuwana, but several deep ravines run down from the southern edge of the plateau; the largest of these are, the Selat Tolaba which drains south-east to the Wadi Hardaba, and the Selat Satab which drains south-west to the Wadi Tuwana. The village of Ad Dubiyat stands near the western edge of the plateau just south of the cultivated basin above mentioned. It consists of about 25 large Mars’ and 30 or 40 less pretentious houses. In the centre is the large house of the Mansab, Seyid Ali Radwan which is called ‘ Dar al Afif,’ and another house called ‘ Dar al Mukadam ’. The population numbers about 400 souls, and consists mainly of the Seyids, the chief families of whom are those of the Mansab, Seyid Ali Radwan, of Seyid Hassan, of Seyid Muhammad Mahadar and Sevid Ahmad Mohsin. Besides the Seyids are the Beni Majali, Beni Hashid, and Beni al Anshali (to which last the Kadis belong). The Seyids of Ad Dubiyat are of the Sufian family, and this settlement is said to have been founded by the grandson of the Abu Sufian whose tomb is at the village of As Sufian near Lahej. The village was first built on the hill on which Wali Hassan now stands, and the remains may still be traced. The tomb of the founder is on the south-east side of the present village. It is much frequented by pilgrims. There are three regularly appointed times of pilgrimage in the year, viz. t the 10th Muhar- ram, 12th Rabi al Avval, and 17th Rajab. The ‘ Ziarat ’ or visit of the pilgrims lasts two days, and the proceed ings consist of a procession with candles and flags, reading of the Koran in a big hall in the Mansab’s house, and feasting and eating of Kat. The shrine of Wali Hassan stands on the highest point of the plateau, a conical hill, a'mile east of the village, at an elevation of 5,884 feet. An extensive view is obtained in all directions, and the white domed *Wali is a conspicuous landmark to travellers from the south. Wali Hassan is also a popular resort of pilgrims, but is not more than about 25 years old. Seyid Hassan is credited with having performed miracles, and his memory is much venerated. His tomb is in a small wa lled enclosure, with two small tanks lined with cement; below it oa the north side, a few paces down, is the tomb of his son, Ali Hassan.After the occupation of Dala and imprisonment of Amir Ali Mukbil&gt; by the Turks in 1873, they sent a detachment of 40 or 50 men with one gun to occupy Ad Dubiyat. They did not remain in occupation for long, but the Commandant one Mustafa, appears to have entered into very friendly relations with the Seyids, and after his departure subscrib ed to the building of Wali Hassan. On several subsequent occasions the Turks have intrigued with the Seyids of Ad Dubiyat with a view to gaining their submission. Dukhn (Bajra) is the commonest crop, also a certain amount of Dirra p (Jowari), Gilgil (sesamum), and digga (vetch). As spring crops a little Crops,etc ' wheat and barley, and ‘ helba ’ and ‘attar' peas, are grown. The rain fall is said to be generally less, and the crops poorer than in the neigh bourhood of Dala, but besides the land on the plateau the Sada of Ad Dubiyat own fertile lands in the Selat Tolaba, on Jabal Suheb a southern spur from the plateau, in the Tuwana valley, the valley of the Selat ar Rida which runs north to Az Zanad, and on the Az Zanad plain. The village of A 1 Hukl, a mile south of Az Zanad is inhabited by dependents of the Seyids who cultivate the lands on their behalf. There are large herds of goats and sheep belonging to Ad Dubiyat, which graze in the deep ravines on the southern side of the plateau. There are also about 50 cattle. The greater part of the plateau is treeless, but in the fields below Ad Dubiyat village there are several fine Tolak trees, a kind of ficus, and TreeS * some of the ravines to the south are well wooded with acacia. There are 4 wells, about 300 yards north of the village and about 50 Water yards apart. Only 2 of these are fit for drinking ; each contains about 7 feet of water, and the w^ater is 25 feet below the surface in one, and 50 feet in the other. Both are in constant use by the inhabitants. There is a masonry reservoir for rain water half a mile east of the village, which measures about 20' x 20' x 6', but it is not in good condition. The distance from Ad Dubiyat to Ad Dala by road is 10 miles. Leav- Communi ing the plateau there is a steep rocky descent, and the path is rough and ca^nsl'' winding for 4 miles, then enters a gorge between rocky hills ; to the east Jabal Dafar with ruins of an old Seyid village and tanks, to the west Jabal Nakha. Ats miles there are good springs in the Selat ar Rida, and camping space on the fields of A 1 Hukl. Thence a steep stony path leads down, and across the Selat ar Rida to the Az Zanad plain. From Az Zanad the path leads over a low stony pass to Zubed whence Dala is 3 miles distant by a good path. This route is practicable for laden camels and for horses, but the roughness of the 1st half makes progress slow. A path practicable for camels, but rough, leads south-west from Ad Dubiyat down into the Wadi Tuwana. It is known as the Nakil Satab. A footpath leads south-east past a precipitous crag known as Bet al W’al, and down the Selat Tolaba into the Wadi Hardaba. A path practicable for camels leads west from Ad Dubiyat, down to the head of the Nakil Tuwana, then continues w r est dowm the Selat Suman, passing below Suman, to the Azraki valley near Khashan 6$ miles.128 HAZAT AL ABID— A district under the Amir of Dala and inhabited by descendants of slaves of former Amirs. It is situated at the north-eastern foot of Jabal Jihaf, and comprises the villages of Ad Deyalim,. Al Mashab, A 1 Wisha. bh'ab Faja, and Habil asSuk. - . Stands on a spur i mile north-west of Al Bajaha of the • i , . a -^ ^ alc ^• ^ consists of about 20 small stone houses^and has about 80 inhabitants^ close to Ad Deyalim, and consists of 2 ‘ dars’ and 30 small houses, and has about 125 inhabitants. Al Wishar* —i mile further west consists of 20 small houses with about 80 inhabitants. At the foot of the spur on which it stands is a good well, only 20 feet to the water. --Nearly | mile further west in a re-entrant is Sh’ab Faia, a village of 70 or 80 small houses with about 250 inhabitants. In the valley below, across a few fields is a good well, 20 feet to the water. ^ a mi ^ e ^ urt ^ er weston a spur near the opening of the Wadi Sewat. 30 houses and about 125 inhabitants ; there is shrine on the hill top above the village. The valley between the lower slopes of Jabal Jihaf on which the above villages stand, and a detached range of low hills opposite, is called WadiHaza.^ It is well wooded with Ulb and Tamarisk, and the soil is rich. It drains to the Wadi Kataba. At the eastern end of the detached range are the ruins of Al Maubaja, said to have been destroyed by the Turks about 10 years ago. A little further to the east is a good w-ell Bit Mandal. 0 ’129 HARIR— The high ridge of Jabal Harir rises to the east of the Dala plain, from the centre of which its summit is about 8 miles distant. The ridge extends nearly 5 miles north and south, and the highest point (about 7,800 feet) is a little north of the centre. The top is mostly bare rock shelving to the west and from ^ a mile to 1 ^ miles wide j there are many depressions in which there is fertile soil cultivated in terraced fields. On the east the shelf breaks abruptly awaj in crags and precipices, below which long rocky spurs run out eastwards with sheltered valleys between, where wheat, barley, and coffee are grown. These valleys from north to south are the Selat Raka in, Selat Adina, Selat Seika, Selat Asha and Selat Moghar Ali, all draining to the Selat Shara, and so to the Wadi Dana. To the west the mountain shelves gradually from its crest line for a mile on an average then falls steeply to the Wadi an Noba which lower down becomes the Wadi ad Dabab. A col connects Jabal Harir on the north with Jabal Awabil of the Sh’aibi. The descent to this col from the village of Ad Dahira at the northern end of Jabal Harir is very precipitous. On the south Jabal Harir is connected with Jabal Obera of the Halmin by a low col across which leads the Nakil Set pass on the route from l)ala to Mahjaba j a steep path leads down to it from the southern point of Jabal Harir. On the highest point of Jabal Harir half a mile east of A 1 Fokaha is a shrine known as Wali al Ma’ud, a white tomb in a walled enclosure, with tanks lined with cement. An extensive view is obtained of the Shaibi country to the north, the Yafa hills to the east, and the Halmin hills to the south, and the Dala country, and hills beyond to the west. The northern part of Jabal Harir, wdth the villages of Ad Dahira, Arshi and Marat, belongs to the Muflahai division of the Yafa. Ad Dahira stands conspicuously on the northernmost point of Jabal Harir, while Arshi and Marat are just below to the east in a sheltered valley wdth a wide extent of cultivated land and several w'ells. Ad Dahira ... ... ... 20 houses, 100 inhabitants. Arshi ... ... ... ... 30 „ 200 Marat ... ... ... ... 6 „ 30 The rest of Jabal Harir is inhabited by subjects of the Amir of Dala of the r’aya class numbering about 800. They are said to be of Yafa origin. [CsjQMGIB]! 3 i Approaches to Jabal Harir. There are 3 approaches to Jabal Harir at its north-western shoulder. 1. Nakil Haban.—{Sw accompanying Road Sketch.) This is the only approach to Jabal Harir practicable for camels, and it is only fit for lightly laden camels carefully led. The road from Dala to the foot of Nakil Haban starts north-east past Kabar, and south of Jabal Shahad, then turns north, leaving Kuren Mas- hak, and 01 Sabula to the right, and Lakmat Hajfar, Haiaz, and Kurai to the left. At 5 rniles turns east up the Wadi Haslab passing Rakka on the left; Dar-al-Hajaf and Dariba on the right; enters the cultivated valley of Sarara at 7 miles. Over a low ridge into the Kharba valley and up it. At 9 miles is a running stream Ghail Haban, 2 good springs and carrping ground (Asfal Nakil Haban). Hence the route follows an old Hinr.iaritic paved road which Major Crawford describes as follows The route follows the old Himiaritic paved road—an interesting relic- though washed away in several places it can be ascended by camels loaded up to 200 lbs. The road where in repair has a minimum breadth of 10 feet and is of solid construction. Perpendicular faces are sur mounted by zigzags and in some places it is carried along rocky slopes a considerable distance by building up level. It is regularly stepped in places where the slope is too steep to admit of ramping. It is overgrown in some parts and in a few places has quite fallen into decay, fortunately not in any essential places. In traversing compara tively level stretches of rock its course is marked out by low stone parapets—a bad plan as they tend to confine the w^ater that falls on the road, to deliver it on the paved portions lower down, and wash these away. On the other hand where the road is led along steep rocky slopes, on the edge of precipices, or in the zigzags where a parapet would be really useful, there are no traces of its having ever existed. Proceeding up the road which is about 4 miles long and involves 3 rise of about 2,200 feet, a pool of drinking water is passed and the road proceeds in an easterly direction up a spur with a deep ravine on either side. The western side of the spur is generally adhered to until a col which practically divides Harir into 2 parts is reached. The village of Dahira will be seen about 1 mile to the north, Marat far below in the valley to the east and Arshi cn a rocky spur just opposite the col. These are 3 Muflahai villages. Turning south, Fokaha is approached up a narrow ravine with cultivation (including coffee) in it, and a col is reached having Fokaha just above on the east and Hauta (a new villao-e with a mosque) on the west. Half a mile of gentle descent through intermittent cultivation and camp ing ground is reached just opposite Masn’a (2 dars) and separated from it by a ravine. Just below in the ravine is a spring suitable for washing purposes and a well, Bir Marahad, (6 feet square, 12 feet deep with 5 feet of water in it) and good to drink. The camping ground is small and pleasantly sited. Wood is difficult to get and should be sent up from below if possible. Camel grazing is scanty. The infantry workng very easy and with frequent halts took about 3^ hours over this march. b*3 2 2. Nakil Yesaran .—(See Major Crawford's Road Sketch.) From A1 Malaha in the Shairi country a path leads east to Ar Rakka at the foot of Jabal Hanr, and thence a footpath goes due east up a ridge to A 1 Fokaha, 3| miles from Ar Rakka, 6| from A1 Malaha. 3. Nakil al Kabl .—From Lakmat an Nub, which is also reached by the path from Al Malaha, a path goes south-east up the western side of Jabal Harir to Dar Al Kabl at miles. Thence a very steep foot-path up the crags for a mile till the shelving rock of the top is reached, 2 miles over rock and terraced fields by Al Jos, and Masn'a to Al Fokaha, miles from Lakmat an Nub, 8 miles from Al Malaha. This is the most direct approach from Dala, via Al Kuren, Al Malaha and Lakmat an Nub. The only other approaches are very steep foot-paths.*33 SHAIRI— The Shairi inhabit the central part of the Dala plateau, the hills to the east, and the Khureba Valley. The estimated population is about 3,000, with about 500 fighting men. There are about 30 villages. They are divided into 5 clans— 1. Al Bakri .—Said to have been originally settled in the country by the Imam of San’a. The Shekhs are 3 brothers, Muhammad, Saleh, and Abdulla, sons of the former Shekh Muthanna Muhammad ; the eldest espoused the cause of the Turks. He was on intimate terms with Seyid Ahmad Mohsin, the fanatical, anti-British Seyid of Lakmat as Sallah, and is allied with him by marriage. Saleh only returned in 1902 after being 3 years a refugee in the Al Haiki country, having committed a cold-blooded murder. He relates that he visited Aden with his father Muthanna about 1882 to make representa tions about Turkish encroachments; about a year after their return the Turks came and destroyed their tower at Lakmat al Hajfar, and took Shekh Muthanna prisoner to San’a. He was released after a year’s captivity in deference to British protests. The Turks in releasing him endeavoured to persuade him to submit to their rule. He died about 2 years after the building of the Turkish post at Jalela, i.e. } about 1888. Another influential Shekh of this section is Saleh Kasim Hubesh of Al Jalela. The district inhabited by the clan is known as Bakur, and the villages are :— Villages. Al Jaleta ... Lakmat at Hajfar Jalas Al Wabeh ... Estimated. population.

The Turks occupied the village of Jalela about 1886, built a fortified post, and remained in possession of Jalela, and the neighbouring villages of Lakmat Al Hajfar, Jalas and Wabeh, until as a result of the enquiries made by the Boundary Commission they were made to withdraw in March 1903.i 3 6 JIHAF— jabal Jiliaf is a considerable mountain mass which bounds the Dala plain on the west. Its highest point Jabal Manara is 7,840 feet high. The central part is in the form of a broken plateau with an average elevation of 7,000 feet. The northern and southern parts take the form of long irregular spurs of considerable height and steepness, with deep narrow valleys between. The principal valleys on the north are the Wadi Sewat, and the Wadi Mattar, and the three main northern spurs are Jabal al Urr, Raid al Kasas, and Jabal Umel. On the south, the principal valley is that which in its upper course is called the Wadi ar Rahan in its middle course the Selat al Habil, and in its lower course Wadi al Bun! It is between the Mafari spur on the east, and the Humedi spur on the west. Another valley, the Wadi M'abr, taking its rise among the peaks east of Sarir runs south-east, and drains to the cultivated lands west of Dala town. The central and northern parts are inhabited by the Ahl Jihaf, and the western part by the Beni Said. The central plateau is bounded on the north by a row of peaks, the most prominent of which are Jabal Manara, Jabal Ba Kuder, Jabal an Noba and Jabal Masn'a. On the east is a serrated ridge, the highest points of which are Jabal Rabek, and Jabal Shijan with ruined build ings upon them. Near the village of Kama is the shrine of Wali Sahib ar Rubat and just below the summit of Jabal Manara is a tomb, about 20 feet long, reputed to be that of Nabi Sha’ib or Jethro father-in-law of Moses. The summit of Jabal Jihaf commands an extensive view to the north over the plain country of Al Hajar to the mountains of Jabal Sha’r, Jabal al Aud, and Jabal Mares, and west up the Tiban valley to Jabal Suhban. All the central part of Jabal Jihaf has a good and plentiful water-supply from numerous wells and springs, and there is a very considerable ex tent of cultivated ground. Besides the usual crops of millets, peas, sesamum, etc., irrigated crops of wheat, barley and Indian corn are grown in some of the valleys, and there are a few coffee plantations. Waras (bastard saffron) is grown in places, and a rose garden was seen near the village of Shima. The Ahl Jihaf number about 3,000 and can muster about 600 fighting men. They are divided into 34 clans, the largest of which are the Ahu Hadal and the Beni Nakib. The most influential Shekhs are— Saleh Husen az Zendani, Mohsin Ahmad al Katrani, and Naji Mohsin Abu Hadal. Under the Turkish occupation, Shekh Saleh Husen az Zendani, (and his father before him) was appointed head shekh of the Ahl Jihaf and collected revenue for the Turks but his appointment was only recognised by the people under compulsion and owing to the presence of Turkish troops. The Zendani family have however long been considered the leading family of Jihaf. In 1278 A, H. they agreed to pay the Amir of Dala an140 r Villages. Estimated Population. Headmen. Haljum ... 150 ...

A good camel road, 8 feet wide, and with a ruling gradient of 1 in 8, well drained, with culverts and Irish bridges, was made by the troops of the Aden column in 1903. Distance from Dala to Kama 5^ miles. Total ascent about 2,000 feet. From Dala the road runs north-west across fields to the ridge which connects Jabal Jihaf with Jabal Mafari, ascends a steep spur by zigzags, and at 2 miles passes below the Azraki village of I halat on a rocky crag, then goes over a col and past the deserted site of Subahrir at 21 miles.The road runs north at 3 miles leaving the Mafari village of Sueda to the west, skirts the base of a cliff and turns west to the site of the camp occupied in 1903 just below the village of Balas (3! miles). The road then descends for a short distance and at 4 miles ascends to a small plateau which was the site of another camp. The road continues northwards passing A 1 Asdaf on the right and Bude’a on the left, then ascends to steep southern slope of Kama plateau by a series of zigzags and after a level £ mile reaches the plateau, 5^ miles, over a short bit of paved road. [Fiom report by Major Craw ford). Nakil Shedud. —A steep footpath, but not difficult leads up the ravine of the Wadi M'abr, at first following the watercourse past the village of A 1 Humera, then ascending the rocky slopes, passing Dar al Haifa, and issuing on to the Jthaf plateau near Sarir. Distance from Dala to Sarir about 5 miles. A £ mile above Al Humera a path branches west and ascends steeply to Balas and Kama. Aakt'l ash Shima or Nakil ad Dakar. —From near 01 Sumed in fhe Ash Shiraf District a steep footpath ascen Is from below the spur of Ad Dahar. The path is very stony and winding, and the ascent is a trying one of about 1.000 feet before the path debouches on the culti vated valley in which Ash Shima, Al Madad, etc, are situated. When the Turks had a garrison on Jabal Jihaf they used to send mules up and down this Nakil. Nakil al Haib. —The only approach on the north side of Jihaf which is practicable for camels. 1 he ascent begins near the village of Hadana in the Dakkam country, and is a very tedious one of fully 2,000 feet in 3 miles. The path reaches the summit of the western, Sabra, ridge, near the villages of Al Haib and Kumala, but there is still a rocky as'cent of 200 feet before the village of Yakub Lakma on the Jihaf plateau is reached. The following are steep foot-paths only :— Nakil Matwat. —From Matwat to Al Hakl. Nakil Rukba. —From Rukba in the Dakkam country to Sabra. Naktl Ghvmrog —From the Dakkam country up the Wadi Mattar to Sharan and Hadur. Nakil Jeru —Up the Wadi Sewat to Jabal Manara. Nakil ad Danaba. —From Danaba on the east up to Madad. Nakil Tabl. — Fxom Wadi M’abr to Subahrir. Nakil Morejaha. —From Al Haud near Dala to Aifar. There are also a few steep approaches from the Humedi country. Proposed site for a sanitarium for Aden on Jabal Jihaf. Immediately west of the village of Kama on Jabal Jihaf is a broad open spur at an elevation of 7,000 feet which has been proposed as a suitable site for a sanitarium for Aden. The accompanying sketch of the ground is by Major Crawford, and he reports on it as follows : The tract of country shown in the sketch is a rocky upland situated between the upper and lower heights of Jabal Jihaf. It is surrounded by142 valleys of which that to the east of Kama descends to the Dala plain : the others all find their way to the Wadi A 1 Bun, the main artery of Jabal Jihaf, and a tributary of the Wadi Tabaghain which joins the River Tiban. The surface of the plateau largely consists of rock, smooth, black and of rounded contour on the top, but descending to the valleys in steep broken slopes, often precipitous and in some cases forming perpendicular cliffs, the most remarkable of which are those to the south and south-west of Dar Gharasah. The locality is said to have been the site of the ancient city of Rodda. At all events there is sufficient evidence of its having been well populated in former days, in the shape of ruins, two disused ceme teries of considerable extent and the remnant of a broad, well built road at the south-eastern corner, indicating the main approa^i to the plateau. The mosque and tomb of Nabi-Shaib—said to be one of the sons of Jacob—is situated on the flat col connecting Kama with the upper plateau and is held in veneration, throughout the neighbouring country. It has been a favourite burying ground in the past but the largest cemetery is that about 300 yards east of Maharras, and north of the ruins on the adjacent hill. Besides these, numerous small groups of graves are to be met with here and there. The plateau itself is separated into two wel’-defined portions by valleys running north and south from a col about 50 feet below the upper or eastern portion. Beyond these valleys there is a descent of about 100 feet, chiefly over rock, to the lower or western portion which is itself divided by a valley running east and west and separating into two at the village of Maharras. Another valley starting in the vicinity of Dar Sha’ab runs westward, and enters the main boun dary valley by a narrow gate under Jarna. These valleys are all highly cultivated, the fields being formed by revetment walls, thrown across the valley, one above the other in steps after the manner in general use throughout this country. When the distance to be revetted exceeds ten feet, two walls one a little set back from the other, are built, the interven ing space forming a pathway or water channel or both. Kama is a good example of a fortified Arab village. Its position is naturally strong, though commanded from the north by heights within modern rifle It consists of a few — ^ Men. Women. Children.

An outer line of defence is formed by three dars on the slope below' : the cattle sheds are between the inner and outer lines. It has a small tank but is dependent for its water-supply on a not very accessible well about 350 feet beneath. It practically commands both upper and lower plateaus. Maharras consists of two blocks of which the southern one is mostly in ruin, two small dars being alone inhabited. This village is not so well built as Kama readily defensible, even from the point of*43 view of Arab warfare. It is picturesquely situated and has a fine well within a stone's throw. Jarna is a fine example of a well-built isolated dar, and its position on a spur with more or less precipitous rocks on three sides, leaves little to be desired. Dar Sha’ab is a small unimport ant dar, well commanded from the main plateau, and Dar Gharasah is little more than a shepherd's dwelling. Population and resources in animals are given in the above table. There are but two wells on the plateau, both in the valley running westwards to Maharras. Of these the lower is a very fine one. It is 9 feet square and about 40 feet deep. At the end of the dry season it ^ contained 17 feet of water which rose to 32 feet a week after the com mencement of the rains. The upper well is 15 feet deep only : it is dry in the dry season. The well below Kama is also a small one about 18 feet deep. It is liable to fail in a prolonged drought, and did so this year. The three wells south of the hills with ruins on it are small and not readily accessible. The main boundary valley running west from Kama has numerous wells which have been surveyed and measured. To render them available, a road connecting them with the plateau would be necessary. There is an interesting group of old Arab granaries about 250 yards east of Maharras. Grain is stored in them after the harvest and withdrawn as required in excellent preservation. It will be seen that the proportion of ground under cultivation is considerable. The principal crop is Dirra or jowari. Some pulse and barley is also grown.144 Ahl Mafari. % History. MAFARI— The Ahl Mafari inhabit Jabal Mafari, and the district known as A 1 Uzlat Mafari, between Jabal Mafari and Jabal Jihaf. Their origin is from the Zedi of the Hashid wa Bakil district of Yemen. There are 3 clans— The Beni Hadeyan, The Beni Jalal, and The Beni Shams-ud-din. The principal Shekhs belong to the Beni Hadeyar. which is the predo minant clan, sometimes giving its name to the whole tribe. The chief is Nakib Ghalib bin Ahmad ; the others Shekh Mutlak bin Nasir, and Shekh Obeid (or Abdalla) Muhammad Talib A 1 M'akar. The estimated population is 800 and they can muster about 150 fight ing men. Jabal Mafari was granted to the Amir of Dala by the Imam of San’a in A. H. f238. In A. H. 1279 (A. D. 1862) Makib Abdalla bin Ahmad Hadeyan sold Jabal Mafari, and half of the district below with all lands, rights, and dues, to Amir Shafal Abdal Hadi. In A. H. 1291 (A. D. 1874) Nakib Yahia Hassan Hadeyan sold the remainder of the Mafari district, together with tribute from Jihaf and Humedi to Amir Sef Abdal Hadi. Again in A. H. 1303 (A. D. 1885) Nakib Ghalib bin Ahmad Hadeyan confirmed the previous acts, and acknowledged Amir Shaif bin Sef as his Chief. Thus the Amirs of Dala have acquired greater personal and proprie tary rights over the Ahl Mafari than over the other tribes subject to them. A story is told of an unsuccessful attack by the Turks on Jabal Mafari, apparently about 1886, when they brought cannon to bear upon it at a long range from the northern side. Nakib Ghalib threw in his lot with the &amp; Turks when they occupied Jabal Jihaf in 1901, while Shekhs Mutlak and Obeid al M'akar remained loyal to the Amir. In this Ghalib followed the lead of Shekh Saleh Husen Zendani of Jihaf with whom he is on intimate terms By agreement with Ghalib the Turks occupied Jabal Mafari in 1901, with a party of Arab levies, and socn after the meeting of the Joint Com mission they replaced them by a party of 40 regular troops. This act of aggression was the main cause of the rupture of negotiations between the Commission in iqo2. The Turks finally withdrew from Jabal Mafari in February 1903, and the British Commission then visited the mountain and were received by Nakib Ghalib who, however, endea voured to hold out for terms that should render him practically independ ent of the Amir. There is bitter feud between Nakib Ghalib, and Shekh Kasim of Zubed, owing to the former, at the time of the Turkish ascendancy, having given his daughter in marriage to Shekh .Saleh Husen Zendani though she had been formally betrothed to Shekh Kasim.146 r Water. returns getting shorter, narrower, and steeper towards the top. This path is built of stone, and is well, and ingenious ly constructed, in some parts being carried on wooden beams. It is said to have been put into its present state of repair by the Turks who occupied the mountain with a small torce in 1902. It is practicable for infantry only. The ascent is about 1,000 feet. Donkeys are taken up this path. A second approach is from the Azraki village of Mojaran at the east ern foot; a foot path ascends, passes above Wall Hadej bin Muhamma , and reaches the summit from its southern side. A third approach is from the Azraki village of A1 Masn’a at the south ern foot of Jabal Mafari, a foot path ascending by Wah Hadej. “ There is no spring nor natural source : only a few tanks for collecting rain-water. When these are exhausted water must be fetched from springs beneath the mountain. There are two of these : (a) Ghail Hufera in the ravine running from the col on the north to the Wadi al Bun: the spring is about 250 feet below the col. (£) A spring below the ravine by which the tableland of the summit drains to the south.” (Crawford.) The villages and towers on Jabal Mafari are as follows:— On the summit. Villages.

The Azraki (Ahl Azarak) inhabit the valley south of Dala, approached by the Nakil Darja an Nishfi pass ; they also inhabit the hills further south down to the Haushabi border. There are two divisions— The Saba descended from the Yafa, Peni Saba. The Murhebi descended from the Zedi of Hashid wa Bakil, northern Yemen. They are bounded on the north and west by Dala; Mafari ; Ahmadi ; Mihrabi ; and Haushabi. On the south by Haushabi, and Alawi. On the east by Alawi, and the Amir of Dala’s districts of Ad Dubiyat, Az Zanad, and Zubed. The most northerly outlying village is Thalath on the hills miles due west of Dala town. The gorge of A 1 Madi’ak in the Wadi Tabaghain marks the meeting point of the territories of the Azraki, Mafari, Ahmadi, and Mihrabi. The hill of Safa Atla on the right bank of the Wadi A 1 Milah marks the meeting point of the territories of the Azraki, Haushabi, and Alawi.

Saleh Kassim of Ad Darb, whose son, Husen Saleh, is in Government employ ; cousin of Shekh Hassan. Shaiya Kassim of A 1 Maktar, brother of above. The Shekhs have full criminal jurisdiction over the tribe. They pay no tribute to the Amir, but are required to give military service in time of war. The settled population is chiefly centred in villages in the valley of the Selat Al A^arak, which is the upper course of the Wadi Tabaghain. There are fair perennial springs near the northernmost villages, but the rainfall is precarious, and the crops are to some extent dependent on freshets from the surrounding hills in the rainy season. To the south across the hills (Jabal Mashwara, etc.) which bound the above valley, are several deep valleys the nomad inhabitants of which con stitute rather more than half the population of the Azraki. The district is called Balad as Saraya Ruhba. The chief valleys are those of the Selat Tuwana, and the Selat Mashwara (upper course of the Wadi A 1 Milah). To the south-west the Wadi Makhran, draining to the Tiban, has a small Azraki population (40 men). There are isolated patches of cultivation in all these valleys, but for the most part they are narrowly enclosed between steep rocky hills, and water is nowhere plentiful. The people are pastoral. The Mashwara route, an important alternative Kafila route from Aden to Yemen, traverses the Azraki country from Rahwat A 1 Hanani on the south to the Nakil Darja an Nishfi on the north.» *49 The route from Dala to Mavia and Taiz goes down the main Azraki valley.

The name, Azraki, is said to be derived from the root, Zarak, to Hurl, from the skill of their ancestors in hurling spears and stones. This with special reference to a tradition of the repulse of an invasion by an Imam of San’a, when the counter attack was led by the Shekh's son hurling a stone which broke the leg of one of the leaders of the Imam’s troops, his father shooting the other. The present ruling family, called Saba, to which all the Shckhs belong, are Yafa intruders who established themselves in the Wadi Madarezani, 2 or 3 generations ago, gradually encroached, and finally seized Al Maktar, killed the ruling Shekh, and assumed the chiefship of the Azraki. •These are the largest villages,\ 0 W N I 5 1 MUMEDI (PI. Humada). The Humedi (Aid Humada) inhabit the south-western spur of Jabal Jihaf, from Jabal Ayub down to the Wadi Tabaghain. They are bounded, on the north by the Dakkam of Jabal Amur, and the Beni Said of Jabal Jihaf. On the east by the Selat al Habil and Wadi al Bun, separating them from the Mafari. On the south by the Wadi Tabaghain south of which are the Ahmadi ; and on the west by the Ahmadi in the Tiban Valley. Estimated population, 2,500, with 400 fighting men. Shekhs. —Husen-bin-Hassan of Al Adan on Jabal Misman, who has remained loyal to the Amir of Dala throughout. Shaif Mukbil, of Mu’ad who espoused the Turkish cause. He claims to be by right Chief Shekh of the Humedi. He has two brothers, Nasir Mukbil, and Yahiya Mukbil. The Humedi, under an agreement, dated A. H. 1276 (A.D. 1859), con firmed in A. H. 1285, pay the Amir of Dala an annual tribute of 60 dollars and 40 kelas of grain. By the same document they agree that the election of their Shekh is subject to the Amir’s approval. The most remarkable natural features of the country are the very abrupt peaks of Jabal Misman and Jabal Seyan. The best part of the country is that on the eastern side of the main range, draining to the Selat al Habil, with the fertile tracts of Balad Ali, and Mu’ad. On the west and south, deep valleys between rugged and precipitous spurs drain to the Wadi Tiban and Wadi Tabaghain ; the largest are the Selat Lakafa and the Selat Hajwa. It is related that the Turks attacked Al Adan about 1886, and the people took up a strong position on a rock at the foot of Jabal Misman depending for their water upon some tanks. The Turks breached these tanks with cannon and the people fled to Dala, but returned to their country when the Turks left it about a month later.

Also the highlands of Jabal An Nad, or Jabal A was. On the west the Ahmadi are bounded by the Turkish districts of Ataba, Amara, ana Humar. On the east by the Humedi, Azraki and Mihrabi. The estimated population is 3,000 with 500 fighting men. The head Shekh of the Ahrr.adi is Awas-bin-Tahir, who lives at Al Husen on the left bank of the Tiban, and has residences at Al Mahala in the Wadi Hora and elsewhere. He has remained loyal to the Amir throughout. His father Tahir- bin-Hadi lives at the village of Jabal A was on the east side of Jabal An Nad. He intrigued with the Turks during 1902. The Ahmadi are bound by a document dated 1277 A. H. confirmed in 1286 A. H. to pay the Amir of Dala a tribute of 55 dollars and 1,5 kada of grain annually. The Ahl Hassan are a. powerful section of the Ahmadi, inhabiting Mazaba in the Upper Wadi Tabaghain, and the plateau of Al Hakl, above to the south. Some time ago this clan engaged in hostilities with the Amir of Dala, which resulted in the latter defeating them and getting them into his power. The Amir then appears to have utilised his influence over the Ahl Hassan to obtain from the Ahmadi Shekh Tahir Hadi-bin-Naji Awas an agreement dated A. H. 1308, by which the latter assigned to the Amir half of the Ahmadi territory and half of the revenues. Subsequently the Ahmadi Shekhs made an agreement wdth the Amir to forego these rights on payment of 1,000 dollars. A quarrel arose about the execution of the terms the Amir retaining the original document ; but it was afterwards patched up and the Amir married Shekh Tahir’s daughter, and made a fresh agreement with the tribe. The Amir still appears to use his influence with the Ahl Hassan to bring pressure on the rest of the Ahmadi. Jabal An Nad (7,13! feet) is a very fine peak which towers above the Jabal An Nad. valleys of the 1 iban and the Tabaghain. Near the summit is a shrine sacred to Nabi Shaib, a saint especially venerated in this part of Arabia. Near the shrine is a curious cleft which runs down like a chimney to open at the base of a cliff some hundreds of feet below. Tradition asserts that the saint w r as fleeing from the infidels upon his camel, and when hard pressed the mountain opened to receive him. ^ The northern, southern and western sides are very precipitous. On the east, below the steep upper slopes, is a broad valley in which the village of Jabal-bin-Awas is situated. Further east across the deep cleft of the Sh ab an Nakab, is the open plateau of Al Hakl, with ample camping space, and sufficient water-supply, at a height of about 4,500 feet.*55 The village of Rahwat Abdalla marks the point at which the Wadi Tiban enters Ahmadi territory. It is at the opening Wadi Tiban. of t j ie g 0r g e by which the river descends from the plain country of A 1 Fajra or Dakkam. The gorge though difficult is practicable for lightly laden camels. On entering Ahmadi territory the river is still narrowly enclosed between lofty and precipitous mountain spurs, but there is a little cultivation along the banks. Ihe stream is 15 to 20 feet wdde and a few inches deep in the dry season. The junction of the Wadi Tabaghain on the left bank is 2 miles below Rahwat Abdalla. Here the valley is more open, and there is camping space for 200 or 300 men. The route from Dala to Mavia, or to Musemir, comes down the Tabaghain, and turns down the Tiban valley. Continuing down the Tiban valley a short gorge is traversed, and 2 miles below the labaghain, the Wadi Hora joins on the right bank. A mile further down is the junction of the Wadi Tusan, also on the right bank, and the route to Mavia turns up it. After passing another short gorge the picturesquely situated tower of A 1 Husen is reached, the residence of Shtkh Awas. There is here a wide stretch of cultivated ground. 2 miles below A 1 Husen is the junction of the Wadi t ilhal on the right bank another route to Mawda branches here. The valley of the Tiban now becomes more open, the hills enclosing it lower, the river is less winding and the crossings fewer. 3^ miles below the Wadi Hilhal the Wadi Shan joins on the left bank. Here the limit of Ahmadi territory is reached. A little frequented route to Dala goes up the Wadi Shan and over a steep pass, traversing Mihrabi and Azraki territory. Xhe tributary valleys of the Wadi Fiban, so far as they lie within Ahmadi territory, are reported on by Major Crawford, R. A., as follows : 1 Wadi Tabaghain (left bank). 2. Wadi Hora (right bank). 3.

The northern entrance of the gorge of the Wadi Tiban is known as Bab al Fajra al Asfal, and a gorge by which the Selat Kataba enters Dakkam territory is known as Bal al Fajra al Ali. The plain country inhabited by the Dakkam forms part of the wide tract of low-lying country known among the Arabs as ‘ Al Hajar.’ This term comprises all the districts from Jabal Sh’ar and Jabal al Aud on the north, to Jabal Hesha and Jabal Jihaf on the south, and from Jabal Mares on the east to Jabal Suhban on the west. The northern border of the Dakkam is the boundary between the territory of the Amir of Dala, and the Turkish district of Al Yubi. The western border the boundary between Dala territory, and the Turkish districts of Al Haiki and Jabal Hesha. The Ahl Dakkam are said to have originated from the Amur division of the Haushabi, and to have migrated to the Al Fajra country where they maintained an independent position until they were conquered and subjugated by the Amir Shafal Abd al Hadi. They pay no regular tribute but bring an annual present to Dala in token of allegiance. The Turks exacted tribute in 1901. The estimated population is 1,800 with about 300 fighting men. The head Shekh is Nap Abdalla who lives at Ukaib on the north eastern slopes of Jabal Hesha, or at Hafasa in aright bank tributary cf the Tiban, Wadi Hafasa.

Their allegiance to the Amir is merely nominal, they pay no tribute and are practically indepen dent. They have close relations with the Muflahar division ofthe\afa across the Wadi Bana, and are probably of \afa stock. The Halmin inhabit the rugged mountain tract between the A 1 Aj’ud country on the south and Jabal Harir on the north. The highest peaks are those of Jabal Haram, Jabal Ubera and Haid ad Dayab. Most of the villages are located in deep valleys running east to the Wadi Bana, the northernmost, the Selat Shara, the southernmost the Selat at KaKb. The Wadi ad Dabab above Kharafa is also Halmin. The Halmin are bounded on the north by Jabal Harir, and Shaibi country; on the east by Yafa districts Dahrashi and Sulemani; on the south by the Hajeli and Mahlai; on the west by Shairi and Amiri country. The estimated population is 4,000 with 800 fighting men. The principal Shekh is Kasim bin Kasim bin Abu Umar of Ad Dabab near Kharafa, on the western side of the Halmin hills. The Halmin are divided into clans as follows:— Clan.

Then winds up steep rocky slopes till at 4 miles a flat gravelly plateau is reached. From the northern edge of this small plateau the cliff goes almost sheer down to the deep valley of the Selat Dalbir (Ahl Murri), and one looks down upon the tower, and village, coffee plantations and terraced fields of Dalbir. The path continues east, up a narrow ravine, for ^ a mile, then over a broad gently sloping spur into the main head watercourse of the Selat Dalbir. The path turning south-south-east follows up the watercourse at a comparatively easy gradient. To the east is Jabal al Falaha, a big peak, the western slopes of which are practicable. At 6 miles the head of the valley is reached and a sharply defined col is crossed. To the south thelground falls precipitously to the Selat Madnun, a deep valley belonging to the Danabir. The path now leads in a general easterly direction along the southern face of Jabal al Faliha, at first steep descent, then a similar ascent and the path turns more towards the north to cross a rocky spur at 6£ miles. Below in the valley to the south are the two small villages of Madnun with terraced fields and coffee cultivation. Hence the path runs north-north-east gradually descending, till at miles the upper watercourse of the Selat Madnun is crossed, Ail ascent of $ mile in the sane general direction now leads over the main watershed which unites Jabal al Falaha to Jabal al Huria, and on crossing it near a small ruined tower, (Shab al Kawadar) the upper basin of the Selat al Masra is entered. This here consists of broad rock slopes with small watercourses in which are a few terraced fields and small coffee plantations. There are three hamlets of stone houses, the nearest, Dahat Kushem, is close to the watershed. The other two, Al Migsa, and Ghail Hanash about f mile further to the east. From Dahat Kushem the ground falls precipitously to the valley of the Selat at Masra in which running water could be seen far below. The water-supply of Dahat Kushem is from a small spring about 200 feet below to the west. The other two villages- were said to have a much more plentiful supply. Owing to the opposition offered by the tribesmen Dahat Kushem was the farthest point reached. It is probably the most suitable camping place for a party visiting the summit. The summit appeared to be not more than miles distant to the east, by a path easy compared with that traversed on the marelvSECTION III. REPORTS HAUSHABI, SUBEHI AND YAFA’I TRIBES, TURKISH AND NORTH WESTERN BORDER DISTRICTS AND THE RIVER TIBAN.CHAPTER I. The Haushabi (pi. Hawashib). The territory inhabited by the Haushabi tribe lies some 30 to 40 miles to the north of Aden and is roughly about 600 square miles in extent. The country consists ol a long and narrow strip, its greatest length being from Harur on the east to beyond Kuddash on the west. The whole of the western part is mountainous, the mountains being of a particularly bleak and barren character with little vegetation and rugged sides difficult of ascent. In this portion, cultivation is almost entirely carried on in the valleys of the Tiban, Warezan and various wadis; stretches of “ habil ” or stone-covered plain occur frequently between the hills, but these are useless for purposes of cultivation. The eastern part is, with the exception of some cultivation near Harfir and Ar Raha, sandy desert. The southern boundary runs from Harur to Nobat Dukem, whence it follows the crest-line of the range of hills running parallel to the right bank of the Tiban to a little below the junction of the Wadi Akkan, from which it passes in a south-westerly direction, south of Minjara and Hidaba and skirting the north of the Juheli hills to J. Muharrika. From Harur to Nobat Dukem the border marches with the Abdali; thence to J. Muharrika with the Subehi. From J. Muharrika it crosses the Wadi Hidaba just below the Kubati village of Suk-ar-Rabu, then the Wadi Natid at Par Nasir Harbi, whence it follows in a general north-west direction the crest-line of the low hills (J. Gbefan. Humala and Rakabat Tinsam) overlooking the low-lying Yusufiyin and Badu countres. From Tinsam it follows a general north-east direction crossing the Fkabil Arabi just to the south of the village of Nabu, and the Am Amma range at J. Basesa, on the north side of which Ahmadi territory is met. This portion is the boundary with the Turkish Sanjak of Taiz. the conterminous districts being Kubati, Yusufi, Badu and Humar. The boundary is shewn in detail on the map. Hence the Haushabi boundary with the Ahmadi runs east, north of J. Warwa, to the junction of the Wadi Shan with the Tiban, whence it turns south, on the left bank of the Tiban to the Wadi Makhran, the villages and lands of Lijma and A 1 Kam’a, being included on the Haushabi side. The line then runs east along the southern watershed of the Wadi Makhran to ]. Kalaban, and along the col crossed by the Nakil Hesha pass at the head of the Wadi Bilih ; then south-east along the southern watershed of the Selat Kharjan and down a spur to a point called Safa Atla, where the boundary with the Amiri ends. The line then passes south to A 1 Milah bordering on the 'Alawi and south-east, by Dar-al- Ashraf, Bir Shakfa and Bir-al-Jiyin to Harur, the Danbari (Radfan tribe nominally under Haushabi influence) being to the north. Both mountains and rivers are dealt with elsewhere, the 'Amri portion being described in detail later, including the Warezan and its principal tributary nullahs. The portion between the’Amri country and the Turkish border to the north, although generally of a barren character, deserves some slight notice, merely from the fact of its proximity to the Turkish district of Humar. To the north-west of Musemir between the Warezan and the Am Amma—Warwa range, lies an undulating stony plateau rising at times into low but rugged hills, cut through by several nullahs with abrupt177 son, the present Sultan Mohsin bin Ali,* and which have cost the Haushabi the fertile lands of Zaida and A 1 Anad, and narrowed their southern border to Nobat Dukem. The loss of A 1 Anad occurred in the time of the present Sultan, whose oppressive policy also caused the Wajihi, Shamera, and Shijri sections living at the south foot of the Am Amma range, to volun tarily place themselves under Turkish administration. Especially in the western part of the country, ruined towers, and land out of cultivation, tear eloquent witness to the unfortunate state of affairs prevailing. Administration, as far as such a term is applicable to the arbitrary policy pursued by the present Sultan, lies chiefly in his hands. He is assisted by a Wazir, an elderly man of strongly marked Negro descent. The Kadi of the Haushabi is As Sid Obed of a branch of the Sufian Sayids, who lives at Dar al Ashraf near Dar Sheban. The head Shekh of the ' Amri is one Ghalib Kaid al Busemi, an astute man of strong character, though quite illiterate. The terms, on which the ’ Amri stand with the Sultan, are of a very uncertain nature. During the last year the Sultan has driven most of the Jerewi clan from the country, and during his time, there is very little chance of the inhabitants being able to devote themselves to peaceful pursuits. At the same time' they are doubtless often to blame, and the Haushabi Sultan is bound to protect the caravan routes with the interior. As regards the footing on which the Haushabi stand with the Turkish tribes, the definite settlement of the frontier will doubtless remove the chief grounds of dispute. It does not appear that the tribes bear one another any particular enmity. The Humar are the most inclined to arrogance with regard to the Haushabi; this is probably the remains of the leaven of the Muhammad Nasir Mukbil spirit, which may be expect ed to wear off in time. With the Badu and the Yusufiyin, the ’ Amri mix freely, as with the Kubeta. They are in fact necessary to one another, and mutual accommodation, in Turkish caravans passing safely through Haushabi territory, or Haushabis finding asylum from their Sultan among Turkish tribes, is called for by the situation. Feuds between Arab tribes there will always be, but they do not as a rule materially affect the general situation. The relations with the North-East Subehi and the Haushabi are also somewhat peculiar. Continual outrages on the caravan route both in Abdali and Haushabi territory are caused by the Subehi, and the ' Amri are at con stant feud with the Humedi, Juberi, and Ba’sus sections. At the same time, certain Subehi Shekhs frequent both the Abdali and Haushabi Sultans. It w r as freely stated by natives that both of these Sultans, between whom in spite of temporary truces bad blood is bound to exist, are not infrequently the instigators of the Subehi raids which occur on one country or the other, and taking the Arab capacity for intrigue into consideration, it is not improbable that this may be the case. The population of the Haushabi is about 7,000, the fighting strength between 2,000 and 3,000 men. The accompanying statement would make their fighting strength under 2,000, but it is by no means certain that the Wazir did not omit certain clans, as the statement was compiled from memory. * Note. — Since printing this report, Aii Mana has succeeded his uncle Mohsin bin Ali. The present political condition of the country may therefore very possibly improve. [C57QMGIB] Z183 IVadis Karl ahan and Red a — Although, not actually within ’Amri territory, it is as well to mention here, the Wadis Karkahan and Reda, which rising to the north, near the foot of the Amamma range, unite just to the east of the ruined tower of Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, north of Kafuf, and join the Warezan a mile below the junction of the Ziyak. The Reda contains a stream of excellent water flowing for about ^ mile till it is diverted to irrigate cultivation, originating in a spring which fills a pool some 20 yards in diameter and 2' to 3' deep. A small stream of good water rises in the Wadi Karkahan, just above its junction with the Reda, and flows for about ^ mile, breaking forth twice before the Wadi, under the name of the Wadi A 1 Milah reaches the Warezan. The level uplands, between the Ziyak and the Reda nullahs, afford an excellent camping ground with water sufficient for several thousand men. Water would be less plentiful about April, but these nullahs are said never to run dry. Wadi Hakkab — The Wadi Hakkab, to the south of the steep slopes of J. Thamaran, which joins the Warezan about a mile above tlie confluence of the Ziyak, is well wooded and bordered in places by cultivated fields. It contains no running water. There are several small villages which obtain their water from shallow springs and wells in their vicinity. Wadi Mijza — The Wadi Mijza, a dry nullah formed by the junction of the Wadis Kuruf and Hlub, joins the Warezan from the south. The village of Ulub with well is in a fertile little valley, well cultivated. Several other dry nullahs drain into the Warezan on either side. Wadi Akkan and Tributaries — There is, as a rule, no running water in the Akkan or tributaries dur ing the dry season. The Akkan, 40 to 50 yards wide, is formed by the junction of the Wadi Natid, rising at the foot of the Yusufiyin hills near al Hajr in Turkish territory, and the Wadi Hidaba, coming from the foot of the Nakil Wuzif between the Kubati and Yusufi hills. Wadi Hidaba — The portion of the Wadi Hidaba above Minjara, near the Yusufiyin border contains some ten small villages with cultivated land on either bank and in the vicinity. The water-supply, from two indifferent wells, is not more than suffi cient forthe population (Bir Minjara, bad water, Bir Ali and Bir Hanesb). Above the village of Al Ashar, the Wadi Hidaba enters a precipitous defde between the mountains of the Kubati and Yusufi groups, with here and there a narrow strip of cultivation on either side. About a mile above the village is a third well (Bir Dariba) used by some six of the vil lages. Depth in January 5' ; refills after 1 hour’s rest. 42 feet to water. A^little beyond this well, the Wadi takes a westerly turn, and is joined from the south-east by the Wadi Fari (Juheli). A mile or so further up occurs the boundary between the ’Amri and the Kubati. There is a good spring of water 2\ miles above Bir Dariba, in Wadi Makar in Kubati territory, and another smaller one in Juheli near the junction of Wadi Fari. The natives say that after a good year’s rein, there is flowing184 water during the dry season in Wadi Hidaba from near the Kubati boundary to the village of AI Ashar, and after heavy rain an impass- able torrent comes down. The Wadi Hidaba joins the Wadi Natid about a mile below the Minjara tower. Wadi Natid — The Wadi Natid, which is the main branch of the Akkan, maintains T 5 ° yards, the banks wooded with tamar.sk and rak vP&gt; eu) The level spaces on either bank, from i to £ mile wide, are cultivated from the Turkish border above the village of Tabra, down to the village of Hawemi. It contains four small villages. There is a good well, Lir Adlan, m the river-bed, 5 feet of water (January) and a total depth of 50 feet, just aoove the junction of tile Wadi Faki, ,^ aWemi&gt; ! V T the north * ea st. The upper part of this Wadi (Al Faki) is wooded, with steep and precipitous banks.- ii miles from its mouth is an indifferent well, and thence down, it widens out to about | mile of cultivated ground on the right bank. There are three small villages on low hills. Hawemi Springs— The most reliable and abundant water-supply in this portion of the Amri country consists of a group of springs on either bank of the Wadi Natid in the neighbourhood of Hawemi. The most plentiful are at Ha wemi itself, on the left bank. From an undulating stretch of turf, a few acres in extent, several springs furnish a practically inexhaustible supply rlnmd °V.

Tinsam and J Humala (3,794 feet), overlook the Humar country and the Badu plain. In the south-west corner, the peaks of J. Kinban, J. Kura 14,810 feet), and others, including J Nadikh or Muharrika, are within the Amri limits, and form the most northerly range of the great mountain mass, which comprises the high hills of the Yusufiyin, (Nabi Shaib, 6,566 feet), the Juheli hills and those in possession of the Kubati themselves. These hills are covered with low undergrowth. Their slopes are exces sively abrupt and the summits sharply peaked. Commitnications .are no roads available for wheeled traffic in the ’Amri country. Camel tracks lead from place to place over the uplands and following the courses of the principal Wadis. Two main caravan routes from Aden pass through 'Amri country to Turkish territory. 1. The Akkan route to Taie leaving the Tiban, follows the bed of the Akkan to the junction of the Wadis Natid and Hidaba. Here it crosses the upland on the right bank of the W. Natid for about 4^ miles, passing the springs of Karrash (clnse to the track on the right) about 1$ miles before again striking the Natid, opposite Hawemi. From Hawemi the Wadi is followed for about 3 miles to the Turkish border, and thence on, caravans reckon on 3 to 4 hours march to the Turkish custom house at Surra, more generally known as Rahda, in the Fadu country. 13 miles from Hawemi to Rahda. From Rahda to Taiz, one long day’s march and for caravans two days. 1 his route offers no difficulty to transport but the nullah bed is heavy marching for troops. The lower portion of the Akkan is unsafe for small parties of travellers, by reason of the (Ba’asus) Subehi who infest the road. Caravans from Aden usually halt at Karrash or Hawemi. Approximate distance from the mouth of the Akkan to the Turkish frontier, 16 miles. There is a well, Bir Salim and spring at Mirza, about a mile from the Turkish border, which was used by the Turkish Com* mission, and escort of over 200 men. From Musemir, a fair camel track traversing the uplands to the west of the Tiban, crosses the Warezan, and joins the above, a little to the east of J. A 1 Karsh, near the junction of W. Mahsos. 2. Route to Mavia .—The track leaves the Tiban at Musemir over uplands and across nullahs direction almost north-west, for about 6 miles, vhen the Warezan is met, followed for a short distance and left to the south. The track continues crossing and following nullahs at intervals passing just north of the village of Addareja, and up the Wadi Addareja or al Milah to the stream in the Wadi Karkahan, the usual halting place for caravans. Distance from Musemir, about 15 miles. This is a trying march for baggage camels, as although there are no very difficult places, the continual descent into, and ascent from, nullahs, involves a considerable strain. There is running water in the Wadi Addareja near the village. The conspicuous needle-like point of J. Jalisa serves as a guide to the general direction soon after leaving the Tiban. From the Karkahan, the track proceeds over the Habil Arabi to the village of Daba, in Turkish territory (3^ miles), and gradually up the Wadi Daba to the Nakil Mavia (4,550 ft), between J. Jarban and J. Am Amma whence a short descent leads to Mavia just below the top of the pass, at 9^ miles from the Karkahan. Total distance from Musemir, 25 to 26 miles.186 The Nakil Mavia offers no difficulties to transport. Routes passable for laden camels also lead to Shurman up the Wadis Hakkab and Sudan. The Hakkab route .—From Musemir is identical with 2, as fai as the village of Addareja, where it branches, and passing by Shahataria, ascends the Wadi Hakkab. For the Selat Sudan route, the Warezan is followed from Shahataria till the Sudan is reached. These two last routes were formerly frequentlv used by caravans, but the Turkish authorities, wishing to restrict the traffic to the two main routes on which are the customs posts of Mavia and Rahda, discouraged their use. Communication with the above and the Akkan route exists by two good camel tracks, one of which leaves the Wadi Natid at Hawemi, and the other a little higher up, ascends the Wadi F'aki. These lead to the Warezan. Communication with the Subehi country to the south is either from the Nakil Wuzif at the head of ihe Wadi Hidaba, or from Minjara by the Nakil Madraja. The Nakil Wuzif Fes in Yusufi territory. A gradual ascent up the Wadi Hidaba leads to the foot of it. The pass is aescribed as passable for camels with light loads, preferably half loads. Its altitude is 4,187 feet and it passes between the Yusufi and Kubati peaks, Al Kokab (6,440 ft.) to the north, and Al Khadr (5,755 ft) to ihe south. Distance from Al Ashar in the Wadi Hidaba, to the top, about 5^ miles. The track descends to Al Hanaka, where there is repirted to be plenty of water, and eventually to Dar am Farsha in the Subehi country. Caravans reckon 2 to 2^ days from Al Ashar to Dar am Farsha. Nakil Madraja .—From the 'Amri to the Sutehi country, passes at an altilude of 2,728 ft. between the Subehi hills, J. Fatharam to the west and Lakmat Isa to the east. The roads approaching it converge from Musemir, and from the west and north-west of the 'Amri country, at the tower of Minjara, at the junction of the Wadis Nakil and Hidaba. {N. B .—It should be noted that the tower marked on the half inch survey map of 1895 i s n ' )W deserted and that a new tower has been built and occupied by men of the Haushabi Sultan, on the left bank of the Wadi Hidaba, just opposite the old tower. The well below it is useless at present but might probably be improved.) From Minjara, the Wadi Nakil is ascended for miles. A dry snndv Wadi with banks 36 to 40 ft. high at first and 50 yards in breadth gradually widening out between the ’Amri mountains of Abbian and Laheb on the west and the Subehi hills, Asharan and Tehan to the east. At 2f miles a good well, Bir Humed, is reached, and the Juheli Wadi Fari joins on the west. Wadi Shuben joins a little lower on the east. From the well, an easy ascent about i mile in length, leads to the top of the pass. From here a paved road built up with stones, and in places, 5 yards wide, leads down, at first rather steeply to the sandy Wadi Kaifi, along which the road to Lahej passes for a mile or so. The track is indistinct at the end of the paved road. No difficulty to transport, though the steep descent is bound to cause some delay. There is a well some 2 miles below the pass, but this does not now contain water (Bir Malaout). (Feb ruary 1904). Caravans for Lahej must either go as far as Nobat Dukem, Al Anad, or Zaida before finding water, except one or two waterholes or187 springs reported totally insufficient for more than quite a few men, and often dry. Prom the Wadi Kaifi, a track (bad) over ravines and stony upland, branches on the right bank to the southern and western Subehi country. The nearest well with an adequate supply of water is Bir Kuren in W. Dar (Matarafi) about 7 miles from the top of the pass. Springs with an ample supply of water in a ravine, Sueda. were found, 2 miles north of Bir Kuren. These are used by the people of Dar Mulehia. No hil Fari — A difficult track described as for foot passengers only, from the Wadi Midaba, follows the Wadi Fari in Juheli territory, ascends the pass at the head of it, and joins the Madraja route near Bir Burned on the 'Amri side of the Madraja pass by a Wadi also called Wadi Fari or Farda. Lateral Communications — Several lateral tracks cross the western portion of the ^Amri country. 'I he main one from Kafuf crosses the Warezan near the village of Khuderat Akrub^and proceeds up the Wadis Mijza and Ulub. A short way up the Wadi Ulub, a track branches to Hawemi. Another, some what longer, continues as far as the village of Ulub and turning some what west, strikes the Wadi Faki which it follows till the W. Natid is reached at Bir Adlan. Hence a good track leads to Hidaba and Minjara. From Hawemi, good tracks lead to Hidaba and Minjara. None of the above offer any difficulty to transport. A track from Hawemi leads over the J. Yebbas Karsh range to Musemir. It is said to be unsuited for baggage animals. Resources — I he disturbed conditions under which the ’Amri have been living tor the last few years have had a disastrous effect on the country. V\ ith the amount of water at their disposal in the north-west portion, one would expect, arguing from the analogy of Dala and other countries further north, to find every inch of cultivable ground utilised. But, owincr to the fact that they are at feud with most of their neighbours, much good land, all hough showing signs of former cultivation has been of late neglected. This is especially noticeable in the valley of the Warezan. The arbitrary policy of the present Sultan, in knocking down their towers, imprisoning and otherwise harrassing the inhabitants for no apparent adequate reason, can hardly be looked upon as a direct encouragement to agricultural enterprise. The cultivated portion of the 'Amri country is entirely limited to the various river-beds enumerated above and their im mediate vicinity. With theexception of the Warezan valley and the small strips of cultivation, irrigated from the Ziyak and Karkahan, the crops are dependent on the rainfall. The staple crops are dhirra (jowari) and dukhn (bajri), the proportion of each grown depending on whether the rains are delayed Dhirra is sown if the rains are early enough to permit of it. Maize is grown during the cold weather and “dijr' (vetch), the leaves of which are much used as camel food, is also cultivated. A little wheat, “burr', is also grown in the irrigated portions during the cold weather. It is impossible at the time of writing to make any accurate estimate of the amount of fodder and grain procurable, as the preceding rains failed almost entirely, and many acres of apparently fertile land have not been sown this year. The people are at present subsisting on maize (February 1904) and importing jowari from the neighbouring Turkish countries. Generally speaking, the country does not produce more than is required by the people for their own consumption, taking good yearswith bad, but forage (karbi) sufficient for some 500 animals, and in ordinary seasons, jowari, would probably be available with a day’s notice. The hired camel men with the Boundary Commission have found no difficulty in supplying their camels (300 to 400) with karbi, on which they principally subsist, while in the 'Amri country. Wood and Fuel — ^ The^Wadis are all well wooded, tamarisk being the commonest tree. Rak and ‘ ashak which afford good camel grazing, as well as mimo sa, are frequently seen. There is a grove of date-palms near the springs of Hav^mi. The “ulub ’ (ber) tree grows among the cultivation. They are much valued by the Arabs as camel and cattle food/ are carefully pruned, and considered as private property. The upper part of the Wadi Hidaba, above A 1 'shar, is exceptionally green and well* wooded, bastard fig, with tamarind and a few palms furnishing the principle varieties. The grazing is, however, better in the lower reaches. The Amri country would be considered distinctly good, as a camel grazing country as south Arabian countries go, and plenty of fuel can be procured everywhere. Villages — These, as a rule, are poorly built and consist of a cluster of stone hovels with one, or a few, roughly built stone “ dars ' (towers) among them. A good many dars having teen knocked down by the Haushabi Sultan in the last few years, the people are probably w’aiting for more settled times before rebuilding. The villages in the neighbourhood of Hidaba, the residence of the Head-Shekh, are somewhat more prosperous in ap pearance. An uncommon feature is the presence, in this part, of conical thatched roofs to the stone houses. Bee-hives are often to be found in large numbers near the villages, and a considerable quantity of honey must be produced. Many of the villages possess one solidly built tower, generally in a commanding position, which serves as a “Keep” for the inhabitants in time of alarm. The Haushabi Sultan has a strongly built tower at Minjara, garrisoned by about half a dozen of his soldiers of whom he maintains 50 to loo, mostly in Musemir, in a commandino- position on the left bank of the Wadi Hidaba, with the object o*f overawing the Subehi raiders. Occupations-* I he people seem to have no particular trade or industry. Most of them are engaged in tilling their land and some in the carrying trade between Aden and Turkish Yemen. There was formerly a market at Hawemi, but lately owing to the excessive dues levied by the Sultan, it has fallen in to desuetude. The people do most of their buying and selling at Mirza, or Suk al Hurvva, in Turkish Yemen, and at Suk ar Rabu just over the Kubati border. Livestock— Few cattle and sheep have been observed. Goats, however, are more plentiful. Small numbers of cattle, etc., could be purchased at the various villages. Chickens and eggs, in small quantities also obtainable. 1 here are no horses and few donkeys. Camels — Probably 300 is quite the outside number of working camels in the country. Many of these are engaged in the carrying trade between Ta.z or Mavta and Aden. After about a week's notice, the Commission were able to hire 80 camels iOcally.j? 9 i Bir Kuren, but it is entirely dependent on the rain-fall and when traversed m February 1904, did not appear to have produced a crop in the preceding year. 1 he remainder of their country is very rugged and barren, and with the exception of Bir Kuren, a good well, and springs ia Sueda ravine- some 2 miles north of Bir Kuren and near the foot of the Kubati moun tains—it appears to be waterless. The pools in the Sueda ravine though somewhat difficult of access, would have watered (February 1904) at the least 500 camels. Water was reported in two adjacent ravines but there was no opportunity of inspecting it. 1 he North-East Subeld tribes are physically rather fine men, lightly bu.lt but very wiry. Many of them have good features and bright, singularly light coloured, eyes. They are exceedingly ignorant and suspi cious, and require most careful treatment to avoid arousing hostility Most, if not all, seen were armed with breech-loaders, (mostly the universal Tegras-carbine) and it is no exaggeration to say that their fingers are figuratively, continually on their triggers. The Matarafi own riding camels but not apparently in large numbers. I hroughout thewhoFe Subehi country, the riding camels observed were all exceedingly young—the owners evidently selling all animals of 4 years of age and using the young ones for their own riding, at the same time breaking them to the saddle. Curiously enough, this does not seem to produce the bad effect one would expect, as the Subehi riding camel is much sought alter and bears a high reputation for endurance. The Matarafi own large flocks of goats which they pasture at the foot of the Kubati hills. 7 he blood-feud whmh exists between them and the Kubati is probably owing to disputed pasture rights in the first instance* The Makk-dumi living in Wadis Alasan and Marasa, comprise some 5 sections. The country is much the same as that previously described a little cultivation existing in the two river-beds. The only two wells known (Bir Ghassan in Wadi Alasan and Bir Marasa) contain a poor sup ply of water. A ravine—al Kadi—near the foot of the Kubati hiNs north- of Dar Murshid Nasir, is reported to contain a good supply of water, but there was no opportunity of inspecting it. Doubtless there are several- water-holding ravines along the Kubati border but the suspicious and semi-hostile people keep their existence secret. The Mansuri living in the neighbourhood of the Wadi Rfasharii number about 300 men, and were formerly the most powerful of the Subehr tribes, exercising effectual, as they still do (in the case of the Shujefi at least) nominal, suzerainty over the bhujefi, Jaz'ai, and Korehi clans to the north west. 7 hese clans held the position of “'Raya ” or subjects of the Mansuri to whom they paid tribute. The continual feuds existing among the Subehi tribes for many years past, have served to destroy the preponderating influence of any particular tribe, and to cause the small out-lying clans to the north to fall almost entirely under the influence of the powerful Turkish tribes of Kubati, Absi, and Yusufi. The actual chief of the Mansuri is Sef ba Abdalla, a boy of about 14, his uncle, Salih ba Ahmad, administering his affairs for him. I here is a little cultivation in the Wadi Masharij around the few scattered towers, and a little in the Wadi Suleb. The only well in Wadi192 Masharii had fallen in and the owner was given money to repair it. A good many riding camels were seen, “ dijr ' (vetch) which was plentiful, being the fodder used for them. AU Heh. The small sections inhabiting the Wadi Heh, which con tains some cultivation but no well, are counted among the Mansun. The Khulefi, especially, bear a reputation for robbery and were originally domiciledneartheAbdali border, from which the Sultan forced them to move in consequence of their constant depredations. They are said to still push their raids as far afield.as the Tiban. These clans were the only Subehi who manifested any overt hostility to the passage of the Commission, causing some delay by disputing the passage of the Am Fidna pass into Wadi Heh. When driven from the heights they continued firing from Dar Ibrahim, which was partly destroyed by shell-fire, and from the surrounding hills, and they subsequently fired a few shots ’into camp at night on several occasions. The Beyond the Wadi Heh, the country becomes markedly more fertile in character,—Wadi Am Farsha—the head-quarters of the Dubeni, containing the first date-palms met with, and good strips of cultivation extending down to the sandy plain near Dar al Kudaimi, with several small villages of two or three towers apiece, and several wells. Am Farsha itself is supplied by two wells, of which one contains a good quantity of water, but both are brackish. The Dubeni villages also extend w'estw'ards along Wadi Ahij, in which there is a well, to the southern part of Wadi Hakat where there is a good deal of cultivation with date-palms and a good well at Biren. Although the Dubeni and the Jurabi are at feud, exception seems to be made in the case of the Jerew'i section, whose principal village J afih, is in the Wadi Ma’din among those of the Jurabi. The Zedin are a small tribe north of the Dubeni near the Kubati border numbering some 60 men. They live in the Wadis Tukar (upper part of the Wadi Am Farsha), Hakat, and Sihr. Although they have of late years to some extent fallen under the influence of the Kubati Shekh, Selim, they have always remained entirely Subehi. The Shujefi .—This is not, however, the case with the Shujefi, a small scattered clan (V. Statement A Mansuri), the villages in the Wadis Sha'ab and Yumit having been practically absorbed by the Absi Shekh who collected taxes from them on behalf of the Turks. The Shujefi in the Wadi Sha’ab have been restored to Subehi status, those in the Yumit remaining on the Turkish side of the boundary. There is a small stream in Wadi Sihr near Nobat as Sihr and a good deal of cultivation around both Zedin and Shujefi villages. The Ahl Sha’ab —inhabit the eastern extremity of the Wadi Sha’ab which is very fertile. They are a small community of Sayids, or religious cgct, who have of late years come under the influence of the Absi Shekh and through him paid dues to the Turks. They have now been included within the boundaries of the Subehi. Their head-man, one Abd-al-Kovvi,*93 is a courtly and well educated old gentleman who passed many years at the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad and forms a curious contrast to his wilder neighbours. I he jfurabi. The Jurabi subdivided into a number of sections and numbering between 3^0 and 400 men, inhabit the valley of the Wadi Ma’din which is by far the richest part of the Subehi country. Not only is the head of the Wadi a singularly well adapted collecting basin for the rain-fall rendered certain by the neighbourhood of the high Absi and Yusufi mountains, but a good stream appears twice in the Wadi between Mafalis and Kuhlan, by means of which the fields near the Wadi itself can be frequently watered in the dry season. There are several wells in the Wadi itself, as well as at Ghurik and at Habil as Sabt. Groves of date-palms are numerous, most of the produce being sold wholesale by the “ tree ” to contractors from Aden. The staple rain-crops Bre jowari and bajri ; good irrigated crops of Indian corn were being cut at the end of February. Sesame, mustard seed used for making oil-cake, and a few limes, are also grown. Although some 600 transport camels were stationed for nearly two months in the Wadi Ma’din, no difficulty was experienced in supplying them with karbi, while the camel-men and others dependent on native supplies, were able to obtain all they required at very reasonable rates. There was not much demand for meat, the troops being supplied with Somali sheep and goats from Aden, but beef of fair quality was procurable locally, and the Arab breeds of sheep and goats were plentiful. The sheep, although affording good mutton, are small, and cost, usually, 4 dollars a head. Several large markets are held near the Jurabi border, the only one actually in Subehi territory being Suk al Sabt (Saturday) in the Wadi Ma’din at Ghurik. Others held, are a Wednesday market in the Humedi country in Wadi Ma’bak, one near the Athwari border, and one near the Korehi villages below Mafalis. Country produce, animals, etc., are sold, as well as imported goods such as cloths, sugar, cheap cigarettes, etc. Arms and ammunition are also procurable, the chief market for these being Suk ar Rabu in the Humedi (Turkish) country. A Legras carbine costs 14 dollars, about 12 rounds of ammunition going to the dollar. The Jurabi are well armed, and should be a powerful tribe well able to resist the encroachments of the Turkish tribes, but they are much weakened by internal dissensions which prevent their co-operating, except in case of actual hostilities. At the present time (1904) a stubbornly prosecuted blood feud exists between the Atawi and Mifyahi sections, with the result that the latter have been unable to obtain access to the stream to irrigate their fields for two years, car. raise no crops and their palm-trees are dying, but neither the Kadis nor other influential men have succeeded in adjusting matters. The two streams—the Ghail Akashi and the Ghail Maula—as well as being the life of the country, are also the cause of most of the internal disputes. They are each controlled by a tribesman bearing the hereditary designation of the “Sid al Ma”, or controller of the water, to whom the various sections pay dues for the use of it. The water is diverted now to this, and now to that, bank, and allotted to the variousrgt individuals for a specified time, being led by artificial channels to the land to be irrigated. Attempts to divert or obtain an unfair share of the- water lead to quarrels m the first instance, with a blood-feud to obtain for years. Treacherous murders in pursuit of these feuds are common, and several occurred during the stay of the Commission in the Wadi Ma’din- One of the Subehi Kadis, Thabit Abu Baler lives with the Jurabi at Habil as Sabt near the Sanawi shrine, the principal Kadi living in Wadi Ma’bak with the Humedi. Theoretically, disputes, etc., are submitted for their arbitration, but the Subehi are an unruly people and not addicted to agreeing with a decision which does not fall in with their inclinations.. Baggage camels are owned by the Jurabi as also by the Wabasha tribes, lower down the Wadi, but they are not numerous. Al Wahasha. —(V. Statement A.) is a generic name for several tribes living in the Ma'din valley below the Jurabi. Of these, the principal, and the only tribe abutting on the Turkish boundary are the J-uledi who live at and near Shawar, at the east foot of the J. Iraf range. The Juledi are another tribe whose influence, originally widely extended, has waned of late years. Although numerically weak, and actually inhabiting a very restricted area, the Juledi Shekh exercised influence, and exacted tribute in the past, from various small clans as far west as- J. ’Akama, some 30 odd miles only, east of Mokha. But at the present time, partly owing to the extension of Turkish influence from Mokha and partly to the independent spirit engendered among these clans by the possession of rifles, although they acknowledge his suzerainty, it has become nominal only. Certain clans, such as the Mudariba and the Aghbari, still pay a small amount, or more probably offer ‘ entertainment^ only, while others, (the Mishwali, Bokari) have of late years paid to the Turks through the Shekh of the Durafi. The Juledi proper border on the Zureki on their (Juledi) west,, along the J. Iraf range, and on their north, along the Wadi Danuba, till the Buremi are met near the Wadi Adim. Shawar is a village of some ^ dozen towers built on a hill above the Wadi Shawar, the Shekh’s being a large and well-built tower. There is a well below the village. The Buremi .—Who border on the south Zureki territory for a short distance near the Wadi Adim consist of some four sections in all not exceeding 150 men, but, as with the Juledi,. there are several small tribes or clans, “Raya' or subjects of theirs, although practically indepen dent at the present time, who inhabit country as far west as J. 'Akkar about 25 miles east of Mokha, but the northernmost clans have fallen under the influence of the Mokha authorities. The Buremi proper live at Dar Mujaba and a few near Am Fajra, the Khulefi division of the Buremi living at Am Fajra itself, a small village with a tower, a few huts and a good well, at which the neighbouring nomads water their flocks. The country to the south consists of rolling sand hills, to the north, the range of hills of J. Musinna and Masn'a, and to the west, between Am Fajra and the Wadi Adim, is an undulating stony plain with many acacia thorn trees.»95 The Bushbushi section live at the hamlet of Ali ba Jirjah in the Adim ontheZureki border, and the 'Utri, at Nassera and Dar Salim Thabit, a couple of miles to the south. There is a little cultivation in the neighbourhood but water is very scarce, the only well which produces any appreciable supply being Bir Majdura in Wadi Majdura and that is brackish. The Buremi are an ignorant people, to a great extent nomads, and covering long distances on their camels. In common with the other western tribes of the Subehi, they seem much more peaceably disposed than the eastern tribes such as the Matarafi. T’' The Shumaya —Are a small clan living in Juledi territory but mow independent. They border on the Zureki in the Wadi Ubil, the boun dary being just above their hamlet of Mijza which consists of two towers and some huts. There are date-palms in the Wadi and cultivation which they irrigate from a good stream coming from the Zureki country and ending just above Mijza. The stream breaks forth again | mile below Mijza and flows for about a mile. Am Mijba and Am Majarih are small hamlets with a little cultivation lower down the Wadi. From the Wadi ’Ubil on westwards, the inhabitants on either side of the border consist of small clans, on the Subehi side living in either Atifi, Juledi or Buremi territory, in small valleys with a little cultivation frequently watered by small streams. Many of them were either originally, or have of later years assumed the character of, Sufis, a re- 1 gious sect of which the founder is buried near Lahej but which has q* branches in nearly the whole of South Yemen, Ad Dubiyat in the Amir of Dala’s. and Shabvva in the Haushabi Sultan’s country, being among their principal centres. This character confers certain advantages in the shape of immunity from tribal feuds, and to a great extent from the payment of dues to ihe ruling Shekh. MuJariba .—South of the Alkami (Turkish) and west of the Shumaya, ■ separated from the latter by some 8 miles of stony and uncultivated country, are the small clan of Mudariba, inhabiting a fertile little valley traversed bv the Wadi Am Barhana which joining the Wadi Khosana, forms the Wadi Turan. The majority of the inhabitants are Sufis and occupy a cluster of little hamlets, consisting of a tower and a few huts apiece, surrounded with date-palms and cultivation near the junction of the Wadis, where a good stream springs forth and flows at intervals for some two miles along the Wadi Turan. There are also two wells, and a third well with poor supply and some small springs in the Wadi Amjueil close by. Karbi is abundant. The people of Mudariba, adherents of the Juledi Shekh in whose territory their^ valley is, were found to be peaceable and well- disposed. About 7 miles further down the Wadi Turan, is the village of Am Shat in Buremi territory but also inhabited by Sufis. It contains gome 30 houses and stone huts, and is supplied by three good wells, one of which is nearly two miles up the Wadi, one near, and one a little below the village. A stream Ghail Rahban rises in the Wadi about 2 miles below' on the road to Turan.The K'aluli .—West of Mudaribn in the Wadis Bitan, and K’aluli (also called W. Furrukhia and Am Lasb) are a small tribe of some 200 men. The Wadi Bitan of which the left bank is bounded by a rugged spur of Jabal Hawab, contains a good stream, Ghail Manobait, which flows for about a mile above the junction of Wadi Harhar, four wells and three or four towers at intervals, a few palm trees and a little cultivation. There is a good spring in rocky pools in a nullah under Hawab, about a mile to the east of Dar Talib. There are very few inhabitants, among them some Sufis, the majority of the K’aluli living in the Wadi of that name separated from the Wadi Bitan by the ridge of J. Ahmad, crossed by a rough little pass, Barh Dhamka. The Wadi K’aluli contains 6 or 7 small villages with 4 wells and good strips of cultivation. The best water-supply is a stream Ghail Funkur miles below Bet Am Lasb, which contains good water and flows for about a mile. Lower down is another stream—Ghail Fum’—giving a good supply, but slightly brackish. A well about a^ mile below, Bir Sulemani, is said to contain sweet w'ater. A fair quantity of karbi, and ordinary native supplies in small quantities are procurable. The Arkami .—At the head of the K'aluli Wadi, is a small valley at the south foot of J. Havvab inhabited by a small clan of about 20 men. There is a tower with a little cultivation near, and a well in a ravine about a mile to the south, only some 18 inches in diameter, and containing when seen about 10 feet of water. It was said by the inhabitants to vield a good supply. The road from the Wadi Bitan to the Haiki valley passes through this valley—Wadi Suder—the passes leading in and out, though not high, have several very difficult bits for camels. Both the K’aluli and the 'Arkami inhabit Buremi territory. They are independent, at the present time, of the Buremi Shekh. The Shubeki—z. small nomad tribe in Buremi territory, inhabit the desolate valley of the Wadi Tarbaha, to the west of the Wadi K’aluli: it consists of a stony plain enclosed on both sides by rocky and barren hills, is intersected by numerous dry nullahs and covered with sparse vegetation affording grazing for the goats, and sheep of the Shubeki. Its average width is' 3 about 2 miles. With the exception of Hisi Ahmad, a deep well with a very scanty supply of brackish water, there is no water between Ghail Funi’ in the Wadi K’aluli and Ghail Kuleta in Wadi Hurrim, a distance of about 8 miles. There is no cultivation nor are any supplies procurable on the spot. [Turbat-Abul-Asrar or Bani Surur, are a small community of Sayids inhabiting a fertile little valley to the north-east of the Hawab range. The shrine there is of some local renown. There is a small village with three wells of good water and a certain amount of cultivation, jowari and date-palms. It is as yet undecided whether this settlement will be included on the Turkish or the British side of the border though the land was originally Subehi. The valley adjoins that of Mudariba and fair tracks lead from it to the Wadi Bitan, to Am Albia and to the Haiki valley.] The The Atifi proper do not appear to number more than about 50 men, although their tribal limits extend south of the Buremi*97 from near Am Fajra to Hawerib and the little group of Turan villages thcnr only fixed habitation and along the coast from the Barhimi border to kuddam, north of Dubab. With the exception of a well about a mile east of Nobat Sayyela (Sayyela well is dry) and a little cultivation near it the whole of the southern portion is desert. Turan itself contains three fair wells and a stream, Ghail Hazaruf, not far up the Wadi Turan, and there is some cultivation near the villages. The Buseli, a small clan of Sayyids, live with the Atifi at Turan. alon^the* coast SeVeral ClanS llvin S in Atifi territory to the north and . tl Jf Se , ^ A {?

The Wadi Hurnm is enclosed by steep rocky banks for most of its course and below Ghail Kuleta, is very difficult for transport. The Makhaya and the Bant Inhabit the lower part of the Wadi Hurrim where it issues from the hills, near the hamlet of Am Nabia which consists of one stone tower and a few karbi huts with a few acres of cultivation. There is a good well, and springs in the Wadi Hurrim about 2 miles above the hamlet. The Bani Fatah, who are Sufis, also own the wells of Uzzaf and Sukaya on the coast. They own a few riding camels and flocks of sheep and goats with which they wander in search of pasture. f _ T .^ Jarthati live near J. Wusid and J. Kharaz. About 2 miles north o. J. Wusid, is a narrow gorge, Ghail Barbar, containing a perennial rivulet, which fills &amp; masonry tank in good repair, of a capacity of about 5,ooo gallons once in 12 hours. There is a tower and a little cultivation irri gated by this tank a little below it. A fair well—Hisi Fara—exists about 2 *1 miles off, just to the south of J. Wusid. The Boundary Commission and supporting column, some 800 men and 500 animals in all, were camped for two days at Ghail Barbar, and good water was procured in sufficient quantity with reasonable economy from the spring and well. A wing of a Native Infantry regiment camped there for several weeks and obtained sufficient forage for their camel transport. Some cultivation exists at Al Didia a few miles south of J. Wusid. Throughout the Atifi country, the men, in the proportion of about 2 out of 3, were armed with breech-loaders, the remainder carrying spears or swords. They appeared perfectly peaceful and well disposed, and under normal circumstances, a small escort of ten to twenty sowars would probably be sufficient. The tribes enumerated above include practically all the Subehi clans of any importance with the exception of the Barhimi who inhabit the sea-coast, east ol Jabal Kharaz and who are from all accounts a fairly well behaved section, nomads for the most part, and the Rujai of Am Rija numbering about 70 men.

The Ottoman Empire is divided into some 28 provinces or “Vilayets' each vilayet being administered by a Vali or Governor General. The vilayet is composed of two or more districts or “ Saniak ” ruled by a Governor or “Mutassarif” and the Sanjak of three or more Kaza' each under a “Kaimakam”. The Kaza is still further subdivided into 'Z or more “Nahie' administered by a Mudir. J The Vilayet of Yemen is divided into three Sanjaks* of which •Asir is some times the one immediately adjoining the territory under included as a 4th. The 3 Principal Sanjaks are San’a Taiz and Hodeda. Haushabi border. British protection, is that of Taiz. Its head-quar ters are the city of Taiz itself at the north foot of J. Sabar and some 20 odd miles distant from the The districts of this Sanjak which border on the territory of the Amir of Oala are, the Kaza of K^taba, comprising the districts of Mares. A1 Aud, A 1 Haiki, A1 \ubi and Hasha. Amara and for a short distance, Humar, (Kama ira). On the boundary of the Haushabi Sultan are, Humar, Badu, Yusufi and Kubat,. On the Subehi border. Kubati, Yusufi, Absi, Athwari, Salihi Humedi, Zureki, Alkami, Mishwah, Haiki and Hakmi. Amara and Humar were originally included in the Kataba Kaza but some years ago, a new district was formed and placed under the “administration of a Humar Arab of humble antecedents, Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, to whose action the Addareja incident of 1901 was entirely due. On his subsequent removal, his nephew, Kaid Salih was made the acting Mudir. This district, called Kama’ira, includes Humar, Amira, Sorak, Shurman Janadiya as well as Badu and Khadir (Salami), the two last having been transferred from the Kaza of Hujeria. 5 Districts under the Kaza of Hujerfa, in proximity to the British Shulifi ^ ^ USU^1, Kub ^ t1 ' Absi, Athwari, Hakimi, Ariki, Ghabra and The Kaimakam of Kataba usually some 40 miles distant, beyond the Nakil The Kaimakam of Hujeria, lives in the being stationed at Hefan in Ghabra. the vicinity of Mavia. resides at Kdtaba, or at Nadira Hadda, with a Mudir at Mares! Bani Hammad district, a Mudir Kaid Sahh s head-quarters are in fhe rule of the Turks in Yemen is one of armed force and it mav be taken as a general rule that the amount of revenue collected from a given district, varies in inverse ratio to the distance of that district from the head-quarters of the Government ; no Arab paying taxes unless he sees good and sufficient reason for so doing. n e Such districts as Shurman and Janadiya, easily accessible from, and in close proximity to, laiz, pay with regularity.21 I The system adopted by the Turks in more distant regions is to select some Shekh of strong (and probably unscrupulous) character and to farm out the tithes to him. He has the moral support of the Government, and, in consequence of the abuses necessarily resulting from such a system, not infrequently the support of the Government troops to enforce the payment of taxes, often in excess of the actual assessment. Other districts again, either by reason of their distance, or their inaccessibility; refuse payment altogether. The Turkish procedure, in such cases, takes the form of a military expedition consisting of a few hundred infantry and a mountain gun or two, which at intervals of some 7 years, visits the defaulting districts. In case of very distant or less productive districts, the visitation may only occur once in 10 to 15 years. The inhabitants either flee or offer resistance, generally the latter. The resistance having been overcome and the inhabitants having fled, the Turkish force establishes itself in the district, laying hands on all that they can in the way of supplies and portable property, and usually knocking down the Shekh’s and chief men’s towers “ pour encourager les autres ”. When the people are tired of staying away, they^ open negotiations, with the invariable result of their compromising with a lump sum for their arrears. The Turkish force then moves to the next district. If the first occupation has been really effectual, less resistance may be looked for on subsequent occasions. Such raids or “revenue-collecting” expeditions constitute in many cases the only pretence of Turkish rule or administration. Briefly then, Turkish districts may be said to come under one of three heads— (а) Districts which pay directly and with regularity to the Government. (б) Districts whose taxes are farmed out to local Shekhs strong enough to enforce payment (with occasional armed assistance). (&lt;?) Districts which only pay under compulsion when visited by a strong Turkish military force. The districts on the British boundary from the Kaza of Kataba to the Badu, would be included in the first and second categories; Yusufi, Kubati, Humedi, and Zureki in the third; while the Hakmi, again, are under the influence cf the Turkish representatives at Shekh Said and Mokha. Regular garrisons in the vicinity of the frontier exist at Taiz, usual strength 500 men* to 1 or 2 battalions,— at Kataba—probably 50 to 200 men normally, at Shekh Said and Mokha, 2 companies normally at each. Though not actually near the border it is as well to mention Turbat-at-Tayar in Dubhan ; there is always a small garrison there and it is used as a base for tax-collecting expeditions. On these occasions troops are moved up from Taiz or from wherever they can be spared. The Wadi Ma’din can be reached thence either by the Nakil Basit and the Hakimi country or past Makatira and through the Humedi. A fruitful source of border incidents is the line of frontier customs posts, which exist at the following places j Qn the Amiri border near Kataba, a customs post with a levy of some 20 Arabs mostly from the A 1 Aud district. Their nominal212 pay is from 15 to 30 rupees per mensem but under the pretext of prevention of smuggling they realize more thau their stipulat ed pay. r 2. On the Haushabi border, at Mavia, a central customs in which local (Humar) Arabs are pecuniarily interested. They constitute a levy and are adherents of Shekh Kaid Salih, the acting Mudir of Kama’ira. 3 - A customs post at Rahda, levies of Shuafi and Yusufi Arabs. Their conduct gives rise to much of the bad feeling which exists between the 'Amri Haushabi and their neighbours. 4. On the Subehi border, a customs post at Mafalis in the Afhwarl country, managed by a Turk of mixed Turkish and Arab parent- age with the assistance of some 20 local Arabs, also financially interested in the “ administration ' of the customs. 3 5. An irregular branch of the same at Doka in the Wadi Sh’ab, in charge of a few local Arabs who exact what dues they can without any pretence of adhering to any fixed scale. There is a Turkish Mudir or Inspector of Customs in the Taiz district who travels among the various posts, but the term administration may be looked on as a dead letter. ■’ Theoretically 1 and 8 per cent, ad valorem should be charged on exports and imports respectively, but a special scale seems to have been instituted varying with the nature of the goods to be taxed. Even were this adhered to, it would be comparatively well, but there is little doubt that the amount taken from the unfortunate passer-by is computed on no other scale than the individual rapacity or necessities of the Superintendent of any given post and his staff. The Arab of Turkish Yemem is w^ell armed, more particularly to the south and south-west. Large numbers of rifles and quantities of ammu- tion find their way from Jibuti through British territory from Ras AV Ara Usually of the Legras make, a carbine costs no more than 12 to 15 dollars in the neighbourhood of Mafalis and donkey-loads of ammunition may be observed crossing the frontier daily. Although Lee-Metfords have not been actually seen in this neighbourhood, '303 ammunition can be purchased in small quantities at almost any of the weekly market-? nn either side of the Subehi border near Mafalis. It is now some 7 years since the Turks last visited Kubati and Yusufi in force, and over 15 since their last visit to the Humedi and Zure- ki. There can be little doubt that they would find a tax-collecting expedi tion at the present day a difficult business, and probably not worth the expenditure of money and lives if the tribesmen really meant resistance. If smokeless powder be generally introduced, it will be a serious thinff for the British as well. The Arab, an adept at taking cover and helped by the rugged nature of his country, is an elusive and by no means despi cable antagonist. During the Kotaibi expedition in November 1003 the only means of identifying the tribesman’s whereabouts was often the smoke of his rifle, and were he armed with a smokeless weapon, both the difficulties and the casualties of such an expedition would be very materi ally increased. J213 Arab tribes are frequently referred to in the plural and as unavoid able confusion may sometimes result, it is perhaps as well to mention those whose variation is most marked.— Kubdti pi.

The districts which follow have been arranged in sequence as far as possible from Kataba as a starting point, south-westwards, towards the Red Sea Coast. MARES. The Mares district is west of the Shaibi heights, and forms with them the mountain wall which bounds the Dala plain on the north. It extends, however, further north-west so as to comprise a high serrated range up to the borders of the A 1 Aud district. It is a mountainous tract 5 or 6 miles wide bounded on the north by the deep valley of the Wadi Dana. The central part of Mares is in the nature of a plateau draining N. by deep ravines to the Dana. The general level of the plateau is about 7,000 ft., above which several peaks rise for several hundred feet, the highest point being reached at J. Jamima with an altitude of a little over 7,600 ft. on the Mares-Shaibi boundary* The plateau and various smaller valleys are well cultivated, jowari and karbi, as well as barley and wheat (burr), being grown. Grapes of small size but fair quality, are also produced. The villages derive their water from numerous wells. Approaches—The. Mares mountains are difficult of access, the only caravan approach from the west near Kataba, being by the Nakil Shem. Camels should however be lightly laden. From the east, there is said to be a fair carnel road from the Wadi Bana up the W. Yer’a. The Nakil Shem leads from Kataba to A 1 Jabara and would probably take baggage camels about 5 or 6 hours. The Nakil al Tilm from Mos’a, east of Kataba, joins the Nakil Shem. A difficult mule track. The Nakil Hazhaz from Habil al Jilb to Atabat, occupies sortie a hours and is passable for lightly laden mules. The Nakil Haifa, from Reshan to Ad Dea, is slightly longer and is also practicable for mules. The Nakil Markam from Humar to Al Badewa, foot-track. The Nakil Adani from Habil Al Jilb to Al Jau. Difficult foot-track. The Nakil as Suedafrom Al Ukla to Atabat. Difficult foot-track, [C57QMGIB] E E2 i 5 not to exceed 600 souls. There are two mosques, a coffee-house, a couple of oil-presses and some 20 shops. The inhabitants are in constant com munication with Aden, chiefly in connection with the skin trade. One Abdalla Ali Shakrir, the son of Ali Shakrir, partner of Seyid Taha, a skin merchant in Aden, is the local agent in Kataba. A bi-weekly market is held in the town. The Shekhship of Kataba shews a somewhat troubled record of recent years The former Shekh, Abderrahman Ardtha al Hanumi was deposed by the Turks at!th e instigation of Mukbil Thabit al Madadia who was appointed Shekh. The latter was murdered in Kataba by members of Abderrahman’s clan in revenge. The murderer Ahmad, son of Abderrahman and the clan of Al Ahnum, 'fled to Shaib and Dthi Hiran and their towers in Kataba, to the number of 7, were destroyed. Mukbil 1 habit was suc ceeded as Shekh by his son Ahmad, who in turn was murdered at the beginning of 1904 at the neighbouring village of Humar, while trying to collect taxes for the Turks. He was succeeded by another of the farm y Muhammad Mukbil Thabit. The inhabitants of Kataba enjoy a doubtful security as to their personal property under the arbitrary Turkish rule At a time of great scarcity of grain in the autumn of 1903, the Turks rst forbade anv higher, than a ridiculously low, rate, being charged for grain, and finding that enough could not be obtained by these means, forcibly raided the granaries of the inhabitants, including the Shekh s. Kataba is the head-quarters of the district of that name, and is the usual residence of the Kaimakam. There are 4 Mudirs under him— 1. The Mudir of Ammar and Sh’ar. „ of Al Aud, Al Haiki and Al Yubi. ,, of Hasha, Ataba, Doran and Al Ahduf (Hadefi). 4 . „ „ of Mares. Wafer .— Kataba derives its water from 5 wells in the watercourse south of the town—Bir Suhaili, Al Masna, Al Aslum, Al Jama Al Wata. In the town is a well reported dry—Bir Al Amya. A well, Bir Zire a, | mile south east of the town has now been included on the British side of the Border. During the drought in 1903 the town of Kataba was by all accounts veiy indifferently supplied with water. Barracks.—A square stone mud-covered building * mile south of the town with a few small huts forms the barracks of the 1 urkish detachment in Kataba. During the stay of the Commission, the usual strength was four companies of infantry but the normal strength would probably be between £ a company and ? companies according to local requirements. HAIKI AND YUBI. The tract occupied by the Haiki and Yubi tribes covers an area of some 140 sq. miles, and is traversed by the main road from Kataba to Mavia and Tala. The Yubi west of the Mares hills, south of Al Aud and north of Dnk- kam (Amir)i, occupy a stretch of flat country drained by the belat 3 -217 Upper Haiki draining to Wadi Tiban. Kurri. Al Behali.

THE TRIBES OF AL AUD— Al Aud is an inclusive name for several tribes inhabiting the high range to the north of Mares and Yubi, which rises at its highest points to the peaks of Jabal Dodan (9,806 ft.) and Jabal Madrah (9,292 ft.) This mountain wall is traversed by the high passes of the Nakil Hadda between J. Dodan and J. Madrah, which leads to Nadira and is described as a good camel road, by the Nakil Salih, to the west of J. Dodan, said to be a fair camel road ; and by the Nakil Shak, in the territory of J. Sh'ar, a difficult pass. The chief tribes of Al Aud are :— The As Sharji- —Under Shekh Hadi Ahmad, chief of Bet as Sharji, strength some 300 to 400 men. Their country lies to the north of the Yubi at the south foot of J.. Madrah. Villages.—Bet as Sharji, Hatab, Husen Bet as Sharji, Azab, Al Kuddam, Karn as Shira, ’Uzlat al Ashur (a group of hamlets on J. Shami) and others. The .SVjW/.—Strength about 2,000 men in two divisions, under Shekhs Abd ar Rab of al Kaula, and Hazam Abdalla. Villages—Nu’a, Kaula, Mankir /on J. Mankir on south bank of the River Bana), As Sakka, Al Adan, Maris (at foot of Nakil Hadda), Shermeh, Al Kuren, Bet Naham, and others. The Subari. —Strength 400 men, under Shekh Abdulla as Subari of Sikna, live near the Nakil Hadda. Villages.—Sikna, Khariba, Afafar, and others. The Bani FadL —On J. Dodan, strength 200 men. Villages—Dodan, San’a, Le’an, Didrub, Bet al Kahnin and others. The Zamzami .—Some 400 strong, live near the River Bana. They inhabit a cluster of villages called generically ’Uzlat al Zam zami. The country of the Al Aud tribes is exceedingly fertile and well watered. The tribesmen are large camel owners and many of the camels engaged by the Boundary Commission and force at Dala belonged to them. Fa j rat al Aud to the north-west of J. Dodan is a fertile and open valley. To the north of Al Aud is the large and very fertile district of Jabal Sh’ar under Shekh Salih Yahia Azam al Amn, who ^ har- lives at Asmaha. It includes J. Atara. Also north of Al Aud, beyond the north bank of the river Bana, is the large tribe of Ammar inhabiting the vicinity Ammar. ghakhab Ammar. Their chief Shekhs are Naji Mohsin Hadi of Mazaba,Tahir Fara of A 1 Ajlub, and Salih Kalab of Kasha. 2-1 S' HASHA. West of the River Tiban and opposite Jabal Jihaf is the consider able mountain mass of Jabal Hasha, falling away on the north, east, and south to the Tiban in high and precipitous rocky spurs. The Tiban on its southwards course flows round its northern and eastern foot. The Wadi A 1 Hakl meeting the Selat Sanajer drains the western slopes. On the northern border is Haiki ; to the north-east, Dakkam ; to the east Dakkam and Ahmadi (Amiri) whose territory includes the Ti ban valley, the border line running near the high spurs of J. Mansura, J. Fanana, the village of Hefa, and J. Kima. To the south, Ahmadi and Amara and to the west, Amara, The summit, some 8,000 feet high rising at its highest point to J. Kordan (8,41 7 feet), has an area of some 5 square miles, level enough to admit of cultivation and habitation. It is supplied with water from both springs and wells, the villages being mostly on the summit and the north-east slope. There is only one approach to J. Hasha passable for baggage animals and any native foot-tracks that may exist, are of necessity very difficult. This road, the Nakil Rufis, ascends Hasha from the north, starting at the village of Thaukab (or Thukhab) and ending at A 1 Karn. The road has at some time been carefully built up and is fairly well laid out. The original foot-way is about 8 feet wide and shows signs of having been roughly paved. Very little excavation has been done, the road-way being built out from the hill side, and contained by a good retaining wall ; the surface of the road-way is at present badly broken up and in places the retaining wall is giving way, but decay has not yet gone so far that a few days' work could not make the road as good as it has ever been.. The total ascent, from about 1 mile south of Thaukab, where the climb really begins, to A 1 Karn, is about 2,500 feet and the distance 4 to 5 miles, giving an average slope of about 1 in 11 (probably the steepest parts are 1 in 6). The first part of the road from 1 mile south of Thaukab to J. Man sura (distance about 2 miles) is the steepest. At Mansura there is a large water-tank 7 feet deep and 20 feet in diameter, lined with lime plaster and in fair condition. Ten yards to the west of the tank (called Sid Rufas), is a strong single-storied blockhouse, built of large stones about 20 feet square. The tank and blockhouse stand on a flat spur some 50 yards which entirely commands the road to Thaukab, nearly every portion of it being visible. The spur itself is commanded by the summit of J. Hasha. From Mansura to the top, the road is easy. The road in its present condition takes laden mules about 2 hours from Thaukab to Mansura, and 1^ hours from Mansura to A 1 Karn. It is practicable for lightly laden camels and if repaired, w-ould be so for fully laden ones. The Ahl Hasha are a small clan probably not numbering over 500 men. Their principal Shekh is one Hamud bin Ahmad ad Daghaf.219 llfl of Hasha villages :— Al Adan. Al Makdar. Nobat Shar*. Ital. Sufa f. Al Hefa. Al Kariya. Kordan. Al Karn. Mashkab Karla al Bet. Aukat.

The Turkish tribe of Humar, inhabit a tract of mountainous country 'Some loo to 150 square miles in extent, to the immediate north of the ‘Haushabi. Its northern boundary is formed by Amara and Shurman, southern and 'eastern by the Ha-ushabi, and western by the Shurman and the Badu 'country. The Selat Sudan, containing a perennial stream, 12 feet wide and 4 inches deep in the dry season, flows approximately on the western border. The Homar country includes both the north and south slopes of the high range, extending from Jabal Am Amma (7,300 feet) to J. Jaiisa (5,900 feet) of which the principal intervening peaks are J. Jarban, Farsis and Selan. It is divided by this chain into three main geographical ■ parts— (0) The north foot of Am Amma, open country containing plenty of cultivation with some 25 villages among which is Mavia. (£) The western portion between the Selat Sudan and J. Jarban, low'-lying and well cultivated with about 30 villages. (c) The head of the Wadi Ziyak and tributaries, narrow valleys com prising some 25 villages. Small villages are built on the summits and upper slopes of the whole range, from Jaiisa to Am Amma, cultivation being carried out by means of terraced fields. Such villages of which there are about 50, depend on water being carried up from the valleys. The upper part of the Wadi Na'aman called the Wadi Hanakaj rising at the south foot of Am Amma, contains £ dozen small villages with a couple of wells. The only flowing stream is the Selat Sudan. The staple crops are jowri and bajari, with a little wheat and barley. mavia is the principal village. It is situated in a commanding position just to the north of the Nakil Mavia, or pass between J. J. Jarban and Am Amma, and contains some 30 Arab houses with 4 wells, and probably numbers 150 inhabitants.There is a Turkish customs post, the personnel of which is cont* posed of some 30 or 40 Arab levies, but no regular garrison. Approaches .—The main caravan route from the south, is that leading from the Tiban, past Addareja to Mavia. A good caravan route leads from Mavia to Taiz. Fair tracks lead to Mavia from the east, (from the Tiban) by the Wadis Tusan and Hilhal. From the north a caravan track reaches Mavia. It is formed by the continuation of the roads from the Nakil Hadda and Kataba. The population of the country is approximately 5,000 to 6,000 souls, the occupation of the people mainly agricultural ; some are camel owners and find employment in the carrying-trade on the caravan routes, especially that between Mavia and Aden which is much frequented. The late head bhekh, Kaid Heresh, was a man of some influence* He was succeeded by his son Hassan Kaid who, however, has no power. The whole country is under the influence of the notorious Muhammad bin Nasir Mukbil and his family. He was appointed Mudif of the district of Kam’aira, in which the Humar are included, and the collection of taxes and the management of the Mavia customs lay in his hands. Although, after his share in the Ad dareja incident of 1901, the Turkish authorities could do no less than re move him from office, and keep him under observation at San’a, he was at once succeeded by his nephew, Shekh Kaid Salih who, under the style of Wakil or acting Mudir, administers ” the country. One Shekh Jazim, living at the border village of Daba, the Mansub (keeper or administrator) of the shrine of Hakami also appears to enjoy some local importance. The numar-Haushabi boundary was for several years the scene of constant border incidents and encroachments. Notwithstanding the fact that these culminated in 1901 at Addareja, bad feeling between the two tribes, on border matters, has continued up to the present day. It may be confidently expected that the final and definite settlement of the frontier will dissipate this in time. Several of the clans on the south of the Am Amma range were originally under the Haushabi Sultan but they have now become thoroughly identified with the Humar.

Taiz, the head-quarters of the Muttassarif or Governor of the province, is a walled city situated at the north foot of Jabal Sabar. The walls’ however, are in bad repair. The population is estimated at 2,ooo, mostly Arabs and a few’ Turkish officials with a sprinkling of Greek and Indian merchants^ The houses are built of rough stone. I he town is abundantly supplied with water brought by pipes from J. Sabar. The garrison varies in strength from 500 men to 2 battalions, the barracks and hospital being situated on rising ground to S. of the town. Taiz has the reputation of being very feverish. The district immediately surrounding it, Taizia, is exceedingly fertile. BADU. At the northern foot of the high range extending from J. Sabar east wards, to the mountains of the Yusufiyin, is an extensive and fertile plain. The eastern portion of this is inhabited by the Badu tribe. The Warezan, rising near the foot of Nakil Moka in the J. Sabar range, traverses their territory from west to east leaving it at the north eastern corner. On the south they are bounded by the Shuafi and Ariki. On the north by the Humar and the ’Amri Haushabi. On the east by the Amri, Yusufiyin, and Hajri, and on the west by Khadir (Salami). ^ a f.^ ern P° r tion of their country is level, and intersected bv several Wadis which join the Warezan, the principal being W. Rahda or Amlah. The cultivation is chiefly in the southern part, under the hieh range. &amp; The Warezan is used to a limited extent only for irrigating the fields, as, f°r a considerable part of its course, it flows in a deep cutting, and elsewhere is liable to sudden floods in the rains, which do much damage to cultivation, &amp;(tsx 225 The eastern and north-eastern borders are fringed by hills in pos session of the Yusufiyin and ’Amri, extending up to J. J. Humala and Tinsatn, near the point where the Warezan enters the ’Amri boundary. From this point westwards, along the northern border, the country appears more level, broken only by low hills, bush covered and rocky, while as far as can be judged from a distance, broken ground again begins on the west ern boundary, behind the white mosque of Shekh Thabit. The plain is well wooded in parts ; camel grazing is said to be good and ‘ ulub ’ trees plentiful ; many small villages are scattered about the plain on every available knoll. The Warezan is the only perennial river, but there is said to be a small flowing stream in one of its tributaries, the Ghail Jashiya. Water from wells is reported abundant. The Badu country is approached by several routes, the chief being the main caravan route from Aden to Taiz. From the east, the Akkan route by the Wadi Natid, and as it is called higher up, the Wadi Shureja to Rahda, the Turkish customs post, and from the south, by Mafalis and the Nakil Hamra. a high but well-constructed route, descending to Suk al Hurwa on the Ariki border. Population, etc .—The Badu are estimated at some 2,000 fighting men. Although, from their proximity to Taiz and the low-lying nature of their country, they can offer little resistance to Turkish taxation, they bear the reputation of a powerful tribe, and when in feud with their neighbours, the Yusufiyin, who are numerically stronger, they generally get the best of it. They own large numbers of camels and are much interested in the carrying trade between Taiz and Aden. There are 4 principal clans, the Bani Ahmad said to number close cn 1,000 fighting men, being the most powerful. These are the Bani Ahmad, Bani Zed, Haddala, and Bani Bakri. The Chief Shekh is Abdu Nasher Ghalib living at the village of Dab wan. Other Shekhs are Abdul Aziz ibn Hail, Makaret Thabit of the Bani Bakri, Kaid Muhammad of the Bani Zed, Nasher bin Zed and Haid bin Kasim. The Badu were formerly included in the district of Hujeria, but have recently been transferred to that of Kama'ira. BADU VILLAGES. In the Eastern part oj the country. A’r Reda. Hamariya Milesa.

The last-named, however, is partly in possession of the Absi. The Yusufiyin are bounded on the north by the 'Amri, the Badu and Hajr (from east to west) ; on the S. by Kubati: on the N. by Kubati and ’Amri, and on the W. by Absi and Ghabra. The principal wadis draining the country are, to the south, the Wadis Hidabaand fdanakaand their tribu taries, of which the water-shed is the Nakil Wuzif in Yusufiyin territory ; to the north, the Wadi Shureja the continuation of the Wadi Natid (called in its higher portions Wadi Zavvani and W. Hajr) and the W. Dubbi to the west of J. Nabi Shaib, which joins the Wadi Shureja. They also constitute the principal approaches to the country. The plain presents much the same characteristics as the Badu country. 1 he mountainous portion, with its intervening wadis is well cultivated ; the water in the wadis being mostly derived from wells, and on the hills from springs. The supply is not, however, sufficient to admit of irrigation, and the natives state that drought in the summer is not uncommon. The staple crops are jowari and bajri. The majority of the villages are small, those in the plain, especially, containing little more than 1 or 2 towers each, and a collection of hovels The villages on the mountains are more solidly built. Population^tc. — Native information unanimously places the fightino- strength of the Yusufiyin at from 3,000 to 4,000 men. Although the number is possibly exaggerated, there is little doubt that they lire far stronger, numerically, than either the Badu or the Kubeta. They consist of two main divisions, the Yusufiyin proper, subdivided into 16 clans, of which the Mobariza is the most considerable, and the Mavvasat comprising some ten clans. The latter inhabit the mountains to the S. and W. Included among them is a small clan, the Jaza’i, who were originally ‘Raya' or subject to the Mansuri Subehi, and it appears pos sible that other small clans may have been absorbed in the same manner. The Principal Shekh. at the present time, is Abd al Jalil Jazim of the Mobariza, living on J. Kaben. His influence, however, seems to be largely confined to his own clan and a few others only. A former Shekh — Abdarrahim—who died some 12 years ago, by all ac counts exercised a paramount influence over the whole tribe. He was succeeded by his son Kasher who, however, by intriguing with the Turks and particularly by importing mercenaries from the north to enforce his orders, incurred the animosity of the tribesmen wffio threw off their allegi ance to him. Since then, each section has been to a great extent under its own Shekh. The. chief Shekh of the Mawasat is Radman bin Abdalla Murshid living in W. Airim, The relations of the Yusufiyin with the Turks are much the same as those of the Kubeta. As seems to be the invariable rule among the Yemen Arabs, feuds exist with both the Absi and the Kubeta and occasional skirmishes , result. Their relations with the Amri have been touched on in the report on that district.2^0 KUBATI. The Kubati country, to the immediate north of the Subehi, is formed by the southernmost range of high mountains in this part of South Arabia, and extends roughly south-west and north-east. . mountains consist of two parallel main ranges, that to the south having J. I has (5,564 feet) as its highest peak, that to the north, called Al Khadr, rising at its highest point to J. Tarfa (5,755 feet). . f Thrse ar f, i° ined b r the Nijd ar Rama, a col which divides the intervening valley into two basins, the easterly, draining by the Wadi Arasim into the Alasan (Subehi), and the westerly by Wadi Ar Rama or babeh, into Wadi Sihr, on its course south to the Subehi country. r 11 S] ° P ?

Of these the most powerful section is the Najjarin, the section of the chief Shekh, Selim Abd al Wahab. The Ashaiila are said to have been formerly the leading section, till they were decimated by internal feuds to such an extent that only some 20 men remain. The Kubeta have been for many years under Turkish influence. Lika most of the outlying Turkish tribes at a distance from the central Govern- ment, their allegiance is more nominal than real, and they are, toall practi cal purposes, autonomous. They only pay taxes when visited by a Turkish military force bene on one of their periodical “ revenue collecting expedi tions.” The last occasion of the kind dates back some seven years, when Rifat Bey, with a body of troops, descended on the country, and stayed for 8 months. The people resisted, and Selim fled, but was prevailed on to return and to induce the people to submit. The Subehi are at continual feud with the Kubeta at one or other point along the border; at the present time the relations between the Matarafi Section of the Subehi and the latter, are hostile, and frequent small skirmishes take place. Although Shekh Selim is generally mentioned as the paramount chief of the Kubeta, his influence over the tribe as a whole seems to be some what overrated nor would he appear to be a man of very strong character. He is much under the influence of more astute men, and particularly under that of his nephew Kahtan bin Husen. The largest village is that of Najjarin which contains some solidly built towers.(15 ^35 The Gliabra also lay claim to the village of Hurrim inhabited by the Yusufiyin and state that the latter make them a regular payment for the use of it. THE ARIKI (pi. Aruk). A large tribe inhabiting the northern slopes of the range, and the fringe of plain at the north foot, are bounded on the east by Ghabra and Shuafi, south by Hakimi north by Badu and west by Selu. Their principal village is Musaliar or Suk al Hurwa, in the plain, almost on the border of Badu and Shuafi. A large market attended by all the neighbouring tribes is held here, and seems to be by far the most considerable in this part of the country. The Aruk number some 1,500 to 2,000 men. Their country is fertile, and is drained by the Wadi Kura, a tributary of the Amlah. They are also interested in the carrying trade. Principal villages .— Musahar. Rohab. W’alan. ’Arar. M’azlj. Kedma. Hujjeri. Dthi Samar. Jaibal. Ghabib. Hadia. A’amur. Murar. Mishra. THE HAKIMI (pi. Ahkum). The Hakimi, bounded on the south by the Kab^hi and Athwari, east by the Athwaji. north by Ariki and west by Kadas, inhabit the very fertile valleys of Wadi al Ahkum (the upper part of the Wadi Ma'din ), which constitutes the main approach from the south, and its affluents, the Wadis Zuberi and Subun. All three of these Wadis contain flowing streams at intervals, and are used for irrigation ; coffee and grapes are grown, as well as the usual crops of dhirra and barley. The high range culminating in the peak of J. Matran (7,590 ft.) on the border of Kadas. closes the country to the west. It is crossed by three passes, the northernmost, the Nakil Halakan (6,990 ft.) described as a difficult pass leading to Selu, the Nakil Basit (5,750 ft.) leading to Kadas, passable for transport, and the Nakil Turba (6,180) leading to Kadas, Dubhan and the head of the Wadi Adim.

TheHumedi, south of the SaliViT, north of Zureki, east of Nabahi (a Makatira section) and west of the Jurabi Subehi, inhabit the valley of the Wadi Ma’bak. The shrine of Othman, about a mile from the junction of the Ma’bak with the Ma’din, marks their eastern limit with the Jurabi. Although quite a small tribe, numbering 70 to 100 fighting men, from their position on the trade route to Makatira and other districts of Hujeria, the Humedi exercise considerable local influence, and are a factor to be taken into account in all frontier questions concerned with the upper part of the Wadi Ma'din. Although Ali Mukbil, the father of the present Shekh, visited Aden in the past, in company with certain Subehi Shekhs, and received presents from the Aden Residency, the Humedi are in no sense Subehi by origin, and at the present day continual jealousy and animosity exists between them and the neighbouring Jurabi section, the Ayeri. The present Shekh—Muhammad bin Ali Mukbil—is a man of strong but aggressive character, and the long period of immunity which his country has enjoyed from a visitation from the Turks—over 15 years— combined with his financial prosperity, has apparently given him a dispropor tionate sense of his own importance. The Humedi derive a large and steady income from the transit dues on “ kat'' passing through their country from Makatira, as well as from traffic in arms and ammunition, which find their way into the Humedi country from Ras al'Ara and thence to Turkish Yemen and the Subehi. Thus, though numerically weak, the Humedi are well armed and furnished with abundant ammunition, and Muhammad Ali seems to be able to count on substantial help from the Makatira clans, the nearest of which, the Nabahi, is almost entirely under his influence. Kadi Thabit bin Thabit, acknowledged by the Subehi as their princi pal Kadi, lives with the Humedi in the Wadi Ma’bak. The Wadi Ma’bak contains no flowing water in the dry season, but the villages are well provided with water from wells, and there is a good strip of cultivation on either bank. Humedi milages .— As Sharj, ‘ Araer, Habil Bani Salah, Hojia, Hudadeh, Habit Tawi, A 1 Kahira, Am Buaiya, A 1 Hadda. THE MAKTARI (pi. Makatira). To the west of the Humedi are the Makatira, who appear to be more in the nature of a confederacy of small separate tribes than a single tribe [C57QMGIB] Htl238 divided into clans or sections as for instance the Absi or Yusuti. To their north are the Sharjabi and the small tribes of Kabshi, Kawashi and Shabuti, to the south and west, the Zureki, The central rallying point of Makatira is the remarkable mountain of Jabal al kala’ (6,949 ft.) “ the citadel ’’—with its flat top, from which steeply scarped and inaccessible cliffs descend sheer to the cultivated and inhabited lower slopes. The Makatira claim to have never submitted to the Turks, as when hard pressed they take refuge on the summit of J. al Kala’ to which there is said to be only one accessible, but very difficult, approach, which cau be closed at will by the removal of a species of ladder There are several towers on the summit, which is cultivated and provided with an ample spring of water, sufficient for irrigation of the fields. Such live-stock as exists, is either carried up when very young, or born on the mountain. The various Makatira tribes either inhabit the upper affluents of the Wadi Ma’bak, the lower slopes of J. al Kala’, or neighbouring hills (J.J. Khuzfar, Thamaidani, Kasira and Jahili). The immediate western neighbours of the Humedi are the Nabahi estimated at about 200 men liv ing on and near J. Rasan. Shekh, Said ba Sad.

The Madjari —Scattered on the east side: only villages of their own, Kubeba, Makbub, and Jardad. More than usual difficulty w?s experienced in obtaining an estimate of numbers—unreliable at best—. Probably, however, the combined Makatira tribes would muster about 1,500 fighting men. There appears to be no predominant Shekh exercising influence over more than his own clan, and each clan has several head-men more or lesson an equality. The mountains of Makatira are exceedingly fertile, the usual crops as well as grapes being grown, but the main industry is the cultivation of “ kat, ” a shrub to the chewing of whose leaves the Yemen Arab is passionately addicted. His capacity for the consumption of “ kat ” seems, indeed, only limited by his purse. The Makatira “ kat' ; practically sup plies the Aden market, several merchants of the district, interested in its disposal, living permanently in Aden. As a few bundles of a dozen twigs or so cost a dollar, a very large income must be realised by its sale. THE ZUREKl. The Zureki, bordering on the east and south on the Juledi Subehi, and on the south, on the Buremi, are the last of the large or important tribes met with on the Subehi border westwards to the coast. They inhabit the valleys of the Wadis Adim and ’Ubil, both of which contain flowing streams at intervals, and are fringed with cultivation and date palms, and the intervening mountainous country, the highest peak being Jabal Munif (6,856 ft.). From the irregular shape of their country they march with a variety of other districts, their northern boundary including Humedi, Maktari, Sharjab, the Zazai of J. Sadan, and Bani Hummtd or Muhammad. On the east, they march with Maktari, Humedi and Juledi ^from north 10 south) ; on the south with Juledi, Buremi, Bushbushi and Shumaya, all Subehi (from east to west) and on the west with Alkami (Turkish). They seem, as far as the Yemen Arab can be, to be a peaceably disposed race, whose chief desire it is to live quietly without Turkish interferem e which they are prepared to resist. They have not been molested by the Turks for the last 16 years, and on the Turkish Commis sion recently passing through the Wadi Adim, they were much perturbed in mind and uncertain whether to take up arms or not. However, having240 realized that the Turkish visit, on this occasion, involved no attemot at taxation, they decided to offer no resistance. ^ The greater part of the Zur&lt; ki are located in the Wadi ’Ubil, in which a good stream flows throughout its course through Zurcki territory and its affluents the Wadis Munif, Fuan, and ’Akiani. The stream in the Wadi Aditn ends just short of the Subehi border. A weekly market is held at Suk al Ithrtin, in the Wadi ’Ubil near the ‘ ^maya border at which the neighbouring tribes do most of their buyin°- and selling. Whilst the British Commission were at Mudariba, not far rom the Zureki border, sufficient dhirra flour was brought to supply some obtai'necf ^ trans P ort ^ een P rov &gt;ded, much more could have been Mnn^ 1 - 6 S .^ ions in the Wadi’Ubil are the Jahari, Odari ; and Munasi , m the Wadi Fuan, the Dukhaini and the Bahai. The chief Shekh is one Muhammad Hizam described as a young and energeUcman Other influential Shekhs are Nasir as Saghair, a^n old Sad a ^ ^ ^ ^ and a PP— d well-disposed, I he Zureki probably number from 1,000 to 1,500 fighting men.

Am Khariz, Am Makbanu, Mutarih, Am Ajam, Solafba. North of the Zureki country is Jabal Sadan, inhabited by several small clans numbering some 6o° men in all. These are the Za’zai, the Massahi ap u 1 n J he Makram l* 0f tliese t}ie 2 a’zai under Akils ’Alwan Said and Ah ha Hedara are by far the most considerable. (They are distinct from the Makatira clan of that name.) 7 aist,nct , Bet ween the Zureki country and the sea. the Turkish border is occu- p. y a number of small tribes of little importance, inhabiting the mountain ranges and their intermediate valleys, and also the Tihanfa or low-lying country, between the maritime range and the Red Sea coast The hiHs here forma watershed, the valleys draining either south tirough the Subehi ccuutry, or west to the Red Sea between Shekh Said and Mokha. They are as a rule fertile, fringed with date-palms and cultivation, with small streams flowing for a short distance/ The24 * Wadi Am Gtad, in particular, which strikes the sea near Mokha, is ex ceedingly fertile, and contains a good and perennial stream. Jovvari (dhirra) and other crops are freely raised, and fruits such as mangoes of a small kind, and limes, are plentiful. The Tihama country in the vicinity of the large vdlage of Moza, is well cultivated. The Subehi tribal territory extended, and still nominally extends, as far north and west as Jabal ’Ak ima, Jabal 'Akkar, and Kuddam, a little north of Dubab on the Red Sea. The small clans inhabiting this tract were “ tenants' of the Juledi and Atifi Subehi, to whom they paid a small sum annually as tribute, but many of them 'have fallen under the influence of the Mokha authorities, and have paid taxes to the Turks through the Shekh of the Durafi, and any connection with the Subehi may be said to be at an end. The tribes generally seem of a far more peaceful character than those further east. The caravan route from Hujeria to Moza and Mokha traverses this part of the country from east to west, and can be joined from the south, in Wadi Shabu at the village of Mabta, by a track leading from the Mudariba valley, which offers no difficulty to transport and on which water is fairly plentiful. Tracks exist communicating from valley to valley. They are mostly ve r y rough, but a little work and blasting would render them fit for camel transport. The Alkami —West of the Zureki are the Alkami, whose border marches with the Mudariba (British) clan. They inhabit Jabal al Ibdar and the valleys to north and west of it, and are practically nomads, owning very few villages. Those seen were somewhat wild and poverty-stricken in appearance. The Alakima number ab^ut 300 men ; their headman is the Akil Rashid bin Alvvan. Such villages as they possess are very small, little more than a tower and a few huts. Villages .—Dar Rashid, Khabal, and a few others. The valleys inhabited by them are the Wadis Barahina, ’Utib, Al Khabal, Bandah, and Shurera. North of the Alakima are :— The Arsuti, a small clan on Jabal Rasin, numbering 20 men. Headman. Said al Jaraiyib. They belong to the Sufi sect and own one village. The Bini Muhammad or Hummid, a small clan of 40 men live in Wadi Batana which joins the Wadi 'Ubil. Shekh .—Hail Abdalla Muhammad. Villages, Kishrar, Arada. ’Ukcma, Madhaf.

The Mishwali .—West of the Alakima. the Turkish border is conti nued by the Mishwali who number about 300 men, and live in the Shukera and Am Albia valleys. Their Shekhs are: Salim ‘Alwan, Ali Zatru, Muhammad Abdalla and Ali Samsan. Villages .—Am Husn, Al Mandara, Am’ Asha, Head-Shekh ’Atia. The above are included in Am Albia. There is a stream in Wadi Harhar in their vicinity. Mukauza, Hadara Dar Mulesa, watered by wells. Also Karia Wadi M’akab Am Turesh, Am Khuneyif. Al Kashnia, Kariat Wadi Bukcr, As Sufai, Huseb Aswad, Henneh. The Mishwali are divided into several clans of which the principal are the Kammera, the Fattena, the Sharrera, the Al Asha’ir. The Bokari in Wadi Ruwes, north of the Mishwali, number about 100 men. Their Shekh is Nasir Salih. Villages.—V.3iT\a.\. Sufi, Kariat Jarad, Kariat Rumadu, Dar al Kanbaria. Wadi Hinna is a broad valley draining to Wadi am Ghail, well cultivated, and watered from wells. 1 he villages in it consist ol stone towers, from 10 to 15 in number. North of the Boka i are the Durafi, whose district is called Al Waza’ia. Their Shekh is Midhish Gtianem, the Turkish Multazim, or tithe-collector, above mentioned. They are a small clan about 70 men in number. Villages.—Ma.uz2i, At Tor, Mdiya, Torera. To their north again, living on and beyond Jabal Jardad and near the head of Wadi am Ghail are the Bani 'Umar, numbering about 100 men. Shekh, Muhammad Abdalla. The Aghbari north of Jabal Hawab, are another small tribe with about 150 men, under Shekh Abdu Muhammad. They have three clans, of which the principal are the Banaya and Jawabira. The Aushahi, Shekh al Fitni, inhabit the Wadi am Ghail to the west of the Bani Sheba. They number about 300 men and own many small hamlets. Other small clans in this neighbourhood are the Al ’Amera in Wadi Ruddif, the Bani ’Ali in Wadi al Hadna, the ‘Utemi near Wadi Shabu and the Asbuhi and Hamruri in Wadi Shabu. The Haiki .—The Haiki are the most westerly of the Turkish tribes on the British boundary, w ho inhabit the mountainous country. They occupy the Wadi al Haiki which drains west to the Red Sea, north of Dubab.^43 They number about 150 men, and are divided into four sections. The Farreja under Shekh Ghanem Ali, live in Karaba. The ‘Arreda under Yahia Rabbash, live in Mabdal. The Ayud, under Muhammad al Muha’il, live in Khunnaha. The Alakima under Abdu Ali Hassan, live in Sanama. Ghanem Ali has the best claim to the Headship, but Yahia Rabbash is the Turkish nominee, and actually has the most influence. He is a turbulent man, badly in want of a lesson, and gave some trouble on the occasion of the delimitation of the boundary. The Wadi al Haiki, formed by the junction of the Wadi as Salh or Karaba, and the Ghail Samadato the south, is in parts, a rocky gorge with overhanging cliffs or steep hills on either side, which widens out in places sufficiently to admit of strips of cultivation. Karaba, the principal and most northerly village, consists of scattered stone towers, between 10 and 15 in number, built on the banks, at and below the junction of the two nullahs above-mentioned. Five wells supply the inhabitants, while in the Salh Wadi, there is a stream, and in the Samada, rocky spring-pools, each situated about a mile above the junction. The water is excellent in both, and the supply practically inexhaustible. Little forage was obtained at Karaba in 1904, but one week’s supply for 500 camels was brought in from Moza and neighbouring valleys without any difficulty, and in an average year, provided the natives are friendly, should always be procurable after two days’ notice. Sanama is about 8 miles below Karaba, and Mabdal between the two. Hisi Sef, a small village inhabited by Sufis, in a valley south-east of Karaba is in Haiki territory. Some 20 Sufis also live at Karaba. The best approach to the Haiki country is from the south, by the Wadi Hurrim. This provides for abundant water in the Wadi K’aluli and the Wadi Hurrim, and, for most of the way, obviates passing up a nullah commanded on both sides, the usual South Arabian mountain road. From the west, the Wadi al Haiki can be ascended from Huneshia. It offers no difficulty to transport. Laden camels pass freely between Karaba and Moza, but the tracks from the east, down the Wadis As Salh and as Samada, are difficult for transport, the latter especially. Hakmi .—West of the Haiki are the Hakmi who inhabit the desert country between the hills and the Red Sea. Both the Hakmi, and the Haiki border on Atifi territory. The Hakmi number about 200 men. Their principal village is Kaddaha. To their north-east, are the Moza’i inhabiting the large and flourish ing village of Moza, and the very fertile vicinity of the Wadi am Ghail. They number about 500 men. Moza is very well supplied with wate aad an aqueduct from it pro vides for the wants of the town of Mokha, 18 miles distant.244 Alokha .—The MeshalkhaanJ the Maslahi are cafled the M'okha tribes^ “The town of Mokha in latitude 13 deg. 19' north, lies in a small bay y between two low points about i| miles apart, on each side of which is a fort in ruins. Between the forts extends the sea-wall, which protects the town, and allows access to it by a single gate only ; in front of the gate is a stone pier or jetty. The town extends in a north and south direc tion along the shore, is about ^ mile square and, from the sea has an im posing appearance. The houses generally are large, white, and built of stone, but .are either in ruins or in a state of great decay; there are several mosques with lofty minarets. The streets are very narrow and in some places impassable from the debris. ,; (Red Sea Pilot, 1900). Information as to the present population of Mokha is uncertain. It is probably about 5,000. Normal garrison 2 companies. Shekh Said and Turba .—Recent investigation has elicited the fact that Shekh Said, though actually in the occupation of Turkey, is in reality well within the limits of the Atifi Subehi, or the British protectorate. “ Port Shekh Said” or Khor Gharera is an inlet, about 2 miles north-east of the headland, running inland about 2£ miles in a south east direction, with a breadth varying from 50 yards at the entrance to nearly a mile at the inner end. It is exceedingly shallow and much of it is dry at low water. It was purchased by a French Company in 1870 for the purpose of forming docks, but the attempt was soon after abandoned and the building which was constructed, is in ruins. On a low rocky hill to the east of the Khor, is the Turkish telegraph station communicating with Mokha and Perim. Gharrera is a small hamlet of mat huts near the Khor. East of Ras Bab al Mandeb is the small bay of Turba, above which is the Turkish fort of Turba, with a garrison of 2 companies. The fort itself is on a spur of the headland, Ras Turba, between 200 and 300 feet high, built of masonry with an earthen exterior slope and about 60 yards square. Within the parapet is a small stone building; 4 fifteen centimetre Krupp guns are said to be mounted “en barbette” within the fort, but on a recent visit to the Turba bay, only one gun could be distinguished which seemed to answer to this descrip tion, and three guns were observed, on travelling carriages, which looked like the average field gun. To the east of the fort on Jabal ’Utba, was a solid stone barrack building, with a 2nd storey built above an archway, and above this again a small building near which a gun, apparently of the size of a 9-pounder, on a very antiquated wooden carriage, was mounted. On Jabal Manhali (865 feet) to the west, and by far the highest point of the peninsula, was another small building with a very similar gun near it. Turba and Shekh Said are very badly provided with water, the few wells existing, being both scanty in supply and brackish. The hamlet of Turba consists of about 20 mat huts. The country between Shekh Said and the hills, and on the road to Mokha, is sandy desert.245 CHAPTER IV. Tribes on the North-West Frontier. [Notes on tribes in proximity to the north-east line’from Lakmat as bliub in Amin territory. The following notes were collected at Sanah in 1903 to assist the work of the Boundary Commission in event of delimitation to the north-east. The information, entirely from native sources, Shekhs of districts or travelling Sayids who visited the Commission, or who were sen out to collect information-is necessarily very incomplete and pro-' bably frequently incorrect It can only have an/ value [ill an oppor tunity of visiting these districts occurs, when it may save a certain amount of initial drudgery. y a certam The accompanying sketch map was compiled by the Survey Officer with the Commission, from topographical data in his possession and from the statements of the natives.] The districts in the vicinity of the proposed north-east line may be brought under the following headings : ' 06 1. Districts under Turkish influence, direct and indirect. 2. Districts directly under, and districts connected with, the Om Rasas Sultanate of Beda. 3. Independent districts. 4. Yafa and its dependencies. (It is not proposed to touch on these here as they have been dealt with in Captain Warneford’s Memorandum.) The Sultanate of Beda was formerly very powerful and its influence extended north-west to near Rada. At the present date, however Dhanemi has fallen, at any rate under indirect Turkish influence, and the hold of Beda on other out-lying tribes is very slight. The tribes from Murad, northwards, can be classed as independent at the present day, Mareb being the most influential factor among them. With regard to the inhabitants generally, the Shekhs seen, whether from the 1 urkish districts or from the dependencies of Beda. were intelli gent and well-educated, the tribesmen independent and sturdy men of a far more attractive type than the inhabitants of the Amiri and neio-hbour- ing countries. ° They bear a warlike reputation but there is liftle doubt that their chief fire-arm is the old matchlock, breech-loaders not yet having penetrated so far in large quantities. I. DISTRICTS UNDER TURKISH INFLUENCE. Rada or Bilid al Arsh —is the most easterly district in which the Turks make any pretence of effective occupation, slight as it is. It is administered by a Wakil (acting) Kaimakam having under his orders a few Arab levies and living in the city of Rada itself. Beyond the levies, there is normally no regular garrison, though troops are despatch ed there from time to time, to assist the Kaimakam in the collection of taxes and they use Rada as a base for their revenue ‘raids' to outlying districts. ; a [C57QMGIB]247 The principal mountain is Jabal Monkal on which is situated Furkhan, the Shekh’s village. According to his statement it is about 6 hours' march from Rada. The fighting strength of the Ahl Sabar is probably about 300 men, although the Shekh laid claim to a much larger number. Villages — Furkhan. Al Maskufa. Husn Sharaza. Yuman. Maswara. Karn al Ma!ah. Zakkim. Abi. Juber. Karia S^id. Kharba. DarasSuhefi. Hawat. Al Hajar. Anas or Ans .—The status of Bilad Anas, vis-a-vis the Turks, seems to be much the same as that of Sabar. It is described as level country with good water-supply from w-ells and very fertile, the produce being much the same as that of Rada. There are said to be about 300 fighting men. Shekh .—Ahmad Abdilla al Masri of Manasih. Clans. — Bani Ansi, Dahab, Salih, Ahl Ahmad and Battal. Villages. —Ar Rakza, al Hamra, Manasih, Aklila and many small hamlets. Riyashia, Hubeshia, and Hajajia —are small districts on a lofty table land, considerably higher than Juban and sloping down to the Bana River near which, Damt, the principal place of Hubeshia, is situated. They are exceedingly fertile and well supplied with water. The fighting strength of each would be approximately 300 to 400 men. They pay taxes to the Turks with regularity. Riyashia .— Muhammad Ali Jahami and Muhammad Zed Jahami. Clans. —Hamatlahab, Talab, Muflahi, Jabal, Khariba. Villages. Talab (a lar-ge village said to produce 200 men), iBet as Saremi and Klirab. Hubeshia .—Shekh Ahmad Salih Dahiri. —Damt and Ad Dahira. Said to be about the size of Ad Dala. Villages - Sharkani, Moda, Mahajaba, Bet al Haidari, Kaula, Khubania, Dar at Talaya, Husn al Ahla, Al Sowafa. There are hot springs near the bed of the Bana, not far from the town of Damt and the village of al Mahajaba. These are always referred to by the natives as “ Al Hammam.'. KefaAl or Upper Kefa, under Turkish influence to some extent at any rate, is described as a very fertile undulating country. The agri cultural produce is much the same as that of Rada district, w'hile the inhabitants own many sheep and goats. Wells are said to be plentiful, while springs (or streams) exist, from which crops are irrigated. The Wadis Fed and Matar in particular, which, uniting form the Wadi Diroba, contain streams which the Ahl Koreshi utilise for that purpose. The principal Shekh is Ahmad All Jara'un who has a following of come 800 men including the Ahl Abbas, Bani Ziad, and Ahl Jauf.j &gt;48 ’TTk ? tl ; e , r , She 1 k . hs t a ™ .Muhammad Said ad Dabab of Gfcarora and Ali Ubad al Masudi of A1 Hanaka.

The people, with a fighting strenoth of 150 men, are cultivators, herdsmen, and weavers. A certain proportion are nomads, living in tents. They follow Ahmad Ali Jara’un. Shekk .—Ahmad Abdalla Abu Diba. ranges.—Hatab, Shamla, An Nuba, As Shakba, Ar Radha. Tent settlement.—Shakba. Sufla and Dthaya. . Tty us—are nomads with about 100 fighting men in all, about 80 living near Rada, and the remainder on the north bank of the Selat Sih They also follow Ahmad Ah Jara un. * Ghanemi.-Jhe large tract to the south-east of Rada under the generic name of Bilad al Ghanem comprises a collection of small tribes under the sway of the powerful Shekh Kaid Jabri Nasir. He is to ad practical purposes an ,ndependent chieftain, but Ghanemi is claimed by the Turks as part of the sub-d,strict of Rada. Informer years it formed a part of the Beda Sultanate. ^ lormed ^ The history of Kaid Jabri Nasir is as follows Some is to aovears ago the Turks set up a Mudir in Suwadi. On his attempting levy tax-s he was killed by the tribesmen. A Turkish force sent to exact retribuHon beheaded some fifteen Shekhs of whom the father of Kaid Jabri NW was one. About 5 years later, the Turks appointed Kaid lahri K-. Mudir “ Nahid Bilad al Ghanem ” with a monthly stipend of 60 dollars’ It is not quite clear what motived this action as the Ahl Ghanem hv .ll' accounts have never paid taxes and are practically independent’-Verv possibly, however they considered that they thus rendered the ackno,7 iedgment of this district as Turkish, certain, without the trouble and , of ,, ; a . v ' n 2 t0 administer it themselves. Kaid Jabri Nasir lives at rsijd al Kahir in the Basin country. Ghanemi is also known as Kefa as Sufla or Lower Kefa. * f 15 credlted with 1,0°° to 1,500 fighting men. The country is fertile, though less so than Rada. Wells are said to be plentiful the principal crops being jowari, wheat and barley. ' ine249 The Sub-tribes of Ghanemi are :— The Basiri. The Mansuri. The Huseni. The Radmani. The Kairi. The Sirhani. The Sare. Mansuri Villages — Sara, Mansam, Damahat, Sid, Masai. Other Villages —A\ Abl, Khamam. Huseni. —Shekh ’ Amr Abd Ahmad.

Sirhani Shekfis.—Ab&amp; 3 i\'rabo Salim, Salim Sirhan. Sirhani Villages.—W Kharaba, Al Abali, An Nukom, Al Musen’a, Kadda, Hamah Monkata, Hajt. Amid —is a small distrct numbering about 200 fighting men which was lormerly under the Beda Sultans to whom they furnished soldiers in war-time. They appear now 7 to have fallen under the influence of Kaid Jabri Nasir, but pay no tribute, and by some accounts are on bad terms with him. The country is level, wdth numerous w 7 ells and very fertile, jowari, wheat, and barley, as w-ell as fruits of various kinds, being grown. Head Shekh .—Ahmad Nasir.

Beda or Bilad ad Dahir (the plateau country). The district of Beda and its dependencies forms a collection of small tribes in the nature of a confederacy, under the Om Rassas Sultanate of Beda. The Beda Sultans were formerly a very powerful factor, exercis ing a wide-spread and effective influence, involving the payment of tribute, and the performance of military service by the tribes subject to the central authority. Their influence has waned considerably of late years, some tribes having fallen under Turkish influence and others more parti cularly to the north w r est, becoming independent.250 The present ruler is the Sultan Alawi-bin-Husen. He is, however, of weak intellect and the country is actually administered by h : s cousin, Ali-bin-Ahmad. Beda proper consists of some ten tribes The A 1 Omar. Hashami. Dafari. Hayasbi. Maljami (more properly classed as a dependency). The fighting strength generally attributed to tbe first nine is 3,000 men, but this is probably much exaggerated. The relations of the different tribes vary, some paying tribute from which others are exempted by reason of performing military service. Taffa is a generic name comprising the Hayashi. Hashami, and Dafari tribes. Beda proper is, topographically, an elevated plateau sloping gradually to the lower-lying country of Behan al Daula to the North, and the Aulaki country to the East and South. The soil is of a sandy nature and is fertile, indigo being grown as well as jowari and bajri. The inhabitants of Beda city are largely engaged in dyeing cloths. Behan ad Daula.—\s a small district to the north of Beda proper. The inhabitants, who are described as peaceful cultivators, are directly under, and subjects or “ Raya ” of, the Beda Sultan. Other small tribes which appear to be directly dependent on Beda are :— The Bani Whose country is also called the Wadi Markha. They number some 300 fighting men, and their country is described as very fertile, the usual crops and fruits being grown, as well as cotton and indigo. The people are mostly weavers and cultivators. The Tahri .—A small clan of 50 men, north of Maljami. Sultan Husen- bin-Ali of the Om Rasas family lives with them. The Azzani. Homekani. Dubani. Madafari. Mash’ari. Villages .—Al ’Aik and Ayai. The Wanabi .—A small district south of Karan, furnish soldiers to the Beda Sultan, and are said to receive an allowance or stipend from him. Kawim .—A small mountainous district north of the Selat Hamra, with about 100 fighting men. They are directly under the Beda SuEanate.25 1 Shekh. —Ahmad Dami. Villages.—M Biles, Ijleh, Marub, Hadara. (Kawim al Faim is a small district between Harib and Behan al Kasab, They have no connection with Beda and follow the Musa am.) Maliami .—A dependency of the Sultan o( Beda to whom they pay tribute, is a large district, level and fertile, and watered by numerous wells. The people own many camels, cattle, and goats. The tribe is divided into 8 clans with a total fighting strength of 800 men. There are no Shekhs, properly speaking, but each clan is headed by an 'Akil, who is responsible to the Sultan of Beda. Clans.—1. Ahl al Reshada. 50 men. Akil Salim Bubak. Villages. —Reshid. Huttan. Al Jarub. Hurrir. 2. Ahl Rahesh. 30 men. Akil Abdalla Husen. Village .— Madaran. 3. Ahl Hamil. 150 men. Akil Muhd. Abdillah. Villages. — Sarawil, Munkhur, M Mahajaba, ’Usela, Kaka, Al Kowa, Rahban. 4. Ahl Saad. 120 men. Akil, Abdalla Abdahmad. Villages .—Dthi Khnir, Wasat, Kusemi, Shab Saulan. 5. Ahl Abu Tag. 50 men. Akil Bubak Daifalla. Village.—Shah Helwa 6 Ahl Ghasham. 200 men. Akil, Said Alawi. 7. Ahl Ghailan. 20 men. Akil Muhd. Salih. —Razaeka al Gbadani 8. Ahl Mansur. 140 men. Akil, Bubak Alawi. Villages. Davb ibn Eyash. Muharaka, As Shurba, As Sharj, Had wan, Shab al Malaha. By some accounts the three principal clans are the Ahl Muftah, the Ahl Ghasham and the Ahl Mansur, among which the smaller clans enumerated above are included. The Bani Mur. —North of Maljami are a small clan of 50 men connected with the Maljami. They pay no tribute. Shekh .— Ali Abdalla al Jamali. Villages. — Fahaili, Barkan, Kabesh, Aukaba. Suwadi—\s to some extent a dependency of Beda. It does not appear, however, that they pay tribute. The fighting strength of the tnbe ,s atout 250 men ; their occupation, weavers, cult.vators, and herdsmen. A certain proportion are nomads. The country is level and fertile, and wells are plentiful. Some 16 years ago, a Turkish force camped in Suwadi (on the occasion of their beheading the ,5 Shekhs), but it does not appear that they have ever revisited the country.Shekh —Khadr Abdalla of al Khoa. Clans. —Ahl Hassan, Ahl Salim, Ahl Khadr. Villages .— Al Khoa, Karia, Dahba, Al Mahnak, Ad Dek, Al Ajrad, Kariat Sa- leam, Nafasan, Al Jahadir. Al Khid^-shi, Al (ihirus, Hinshan, Kariat Ahl Salih, Jiwal, Shida. Shomri, Kabwa, and various tent settlements. Awadi. —The last of the tribes who can now be counted as under the influence of Beda, are a small clan probably numbering 100 men all told. 7 hey are divided into the follovving sections which live scattered among the districts of Hauran and Karan :— Sections. —Avvr.di Jurebat, Awadi Radman, Awadi Makhlak, Awadi Aghwal. Jurebat. —Akil Husen Salih. No villages. Nomads inhabiting tents. Radman. —Head Shekh. Al Hajiri Abd Wes. Villages. —Al Habil and Al Hajar. Makhlak. —Villages. As Soda and Al Wa'il. III. INDEPENDENT TRIBES. Behan Al Rasab. —Is a large tract under the Ashraf rulers Salih-bin* Ahmad and Sef-bin-Ahmad, containing the large city of Suk al Kasab. The tribe inhabiting the country are the Musabain who appear to comprise the inhabitants of Suk al Kasab itself. It is a large city, situated in the sandy Wadi Behan and built of mud bricks, with a population of 1,000 men, of whom only about one half are tribesmen (Kaba'il) or fighting men, the remainder being weavers or dyers. There is a good deal of cultivation in the Wadi Behan, indigo being the principal crop, as the dyeing of cloth is the main industry in the city. Oilseed, cotton, and in winter, barley and wheat, are also grown. A considerable export of indigo and dyed cloths takes place from Behan and neighbouring districts, which supply the tribesmen to the south, Yafa, Dala, etc , with the blue cloths so universally worn. Apart from the Ashraf rulers, the most influential man in Behan al Kasab and indeed in the surrounding country, is the Kadi Atik-bin-Ahmad. Although the country is in no way under Turkish influence, the Kadi is a frequent visitor to San’a, where he is handsomely treated and re ceives presents of horses, robes of honour and probably money, though he has no regular salary. He is inclined to run with the hare and hunt with the hound's as he has, at one time or another, held communication with Aden.( no 253 He is certainly an astute man, particularly influential from his religious character, whose good will and services would be of paramount assistance to any move of ours in that direction. The Kadi lives at the village of Roda. Sections .— Ahl Naim. Villages A 1 Ahmar, Shaka, Asakir and Kasaba' Ahl Raja. ^ Ahl Mansur. Nomads living in tent? with their flocks. Ahl Rikabi. j Faraj.

Marib (Saba) .— A district under the Amir of Marib, Al Sharif Husen-bin-Abdarrahman, comprises the large city of Marib, in which the Sharif lives, and certain outlying villages. The country is level and sandy. Wells are said to be numerous, and dates, cotton and indigo are grown. Rock salt is also extracted from two hills, and exported in large quantities to districts to the south and south west. There are many camels and horses in the country. The population is said to be 1,500 men, of whom one-third, being weavers and dyers, are not classed as fighting men. Clans. —Ad Dahana, Ahl Sharjab, Bani ar Rabi, Bani Sudan, Al Ashraf, Bani al Hudebi. [csjqmgib] kk254 The Ashraf number 300 men. Villages. —A 1 Kal’a, Kusdan, Zobra, Bankala, Moja, Al ’Akaer. B attar ith .— A nomad tribe under the influence of the Amir of Marib, inhabit a tract which appears to be sandy desert, with oases containing wells and date palms. The inhabitants, who own horses, camels and large flocks, are tent-dwellers and there are no settled villages. Shekhs. —Kurad-bin-Shamakh and Firai-bin-Shamakh. Clans. —Sudani, ’Uzebi, Raji, Mohsini. Hani or Hinna.— A smaller tribe of about 100 fighting men under the Amir of Marib. The people are entirely nomadic, owning horses and flocks, and living ift tents. They also weave rugs and export salt. The country is sandy with a few wells and date-palms. Harib.— Is a large district under the Sharif Amr Hadi-hin-Ahmad, to whom the people pay tribute. It appears to be entirely independent at the present day. The country is fairly level and well cultivated, with numerous wells. Cotton and indigo are grown. There are two towns, Darb al Ali and Dafb Abu Tuhef built of brick, and many smaller villages. The population is estimated at 800 men, of whom the Ashraf, the only fighting men, number 200. The remainder are weavers and dyers in indigo. Clans. —Tuhefi, Musai, Khashl, Madafari, Ahl Abu Komeri, Ahl Islam, Ahl Amr al Wadi. Muradt —- Is a large district rugged and uncultivated for the most part. The inhabitants are independent nomads under the leadership of Talib-bin- Ahmad, a blind Shekh, who lives at the village of Ar Rekhs, near which alone there is any cultivation. Bastard saffron (waras) t and coffee are said to be grown there. The majority of the people own large flocks which they water from springs in the ravines, few wells existing. Ar Rekhs is the only settled village, others being only tent settlements. They also traffic in salt, probably brought from Marib, which they exchange for grain, and weave rugs. Their fighting strength is estimated at 1,000 men. Clans .—Al S'atra, 200 men under Talib-bin-Ahmad. Bani Sef, 200 men, Al Karada, 250 men. Al Jamil, 300 men.3. Ahl Himyar and as Sakur. 70 fighting men. Shekhs Husen Abdalla al Himyari and Husen Abdalla as Sakur. Villages .—Ar Roda, Al Ghadir, Al Jadma, Kariat Ibrahim, Kania, Darmana Hadawi, Al Kharaba. This district is also known as Al Mustanir. Bant Dabiani al Kubli .—An independent nomad tribe inhabit ing mountainous and rugged country without cultivation, watered by a stream draining to Murad. They number some 500 fighting men and own flocks of sheep and goats. There is only one settled village, Ar Ra’ed. Chief Shekh, Salih Said al Humedi. Al Hada .—A nomadic tribe of some 300 fighting men are connected with the Bani Dabiani, whom they follow. The country presents the same characteristics and is watered by small streams draining to Murad. The people, who are tent dwellers, weave rugs and own flocks. As Sabla is the only settled village. Shekhs .—Ahmad Abdalla Ali Salih, and Ahmad bin Kasim. Koman .—A nomadic tribe with some 200 fighting men. Charac teristics of people and country approximate toal Hada. It is connected with Jauf al Khalid to the north-east, a district concerning which no details were obtainable. NOTES ON ROUTES. It is of course impossible to place much reliance on routes based entirely on native information and dealing with unsurveyed country at a considerable distance ; at the same time it seems worth while to record the statements of some of the more intelligent men as to*approximate distances, nature of country, etc., if only as a basis for further inquiry. The local acceptance ol “on foot’* is usually the “ Mukattib' or letter carrier who walks about 20 miles a day. Caravans travel 10 to 15 miles. Tracks suitable for mule and camel transport only. 1.

The country of the Yafa'i lies to the north and north-east of Aden and is divided into two main divisions, hitherto known officially as the Upper and Lower Yafa'i respectively, the Upper Yafa’i being to the north and the Lower Yafa’i to the south. But this nomenclature is unfortunately opposed to that of the tribes themselves, who call the northern division the Yut'a’i-as-Sufal or low, and the southern division the Yafa’i Bani Afif or Bani Kasid. In this note these terms as used by the Arabs will be followed. The Yafa’i-as-Sufal is a country consisting of high mountains and deep valleys. The principal ranges of mountains are Jabal Shimr lying between the country of the Dtbube and Mausata clans ; Jabals Shamsan, Dthi-Marsua and Zevi, in the Mausata territory: and the Jabal-al-’Ur range forming the border between Yafa’i-as-Sufal and the Beda country and Jabal al Ali and Jabal Suleman in the centre of Yafa’i. The principal river of the country is the Wadi Bana which flows through it from north-west to south-east, but there are several of its tributaries and small valleys which have running streams in them. Amongst these are the WadiHatib, the Wadi Jahami and the Selat-as Sih. Water can be found in nearly all valleys during the months of July, August, and September, the rainy season. The principal articles of cultivation are red jowari, white jowari, bajri, wheat, barley, lucerne, and coffee. The general elevation of the Yafa’i-as-Sufal is between 4,000 and 7,000 feet above the sea and therefore the climate is equable and generally cool and pleasant; the country appears to be fertile and thickly inhabited. The rainfall is apparently about 20 to 25 inches annually. The Yafa’i as a tribe are Himyaritic in origin with the exception of a few border clans who have come from the north and have gradually become affiliated. The Yafa’i were formerly under the Imams of Sana’a, but they revolted about the end of the seventeenth century and became independent. They are now perhaps one of the most powerful tribes in Yemen. The total fighting strength of the Yafa’i-as-Sufal is estimated at about 25,000 men. The Y’afa’i Bani Kasid are supposed to be able to muster about 8,000 men.265 The district of Juban is divided equally amongst the Shekhs of the two families or houses. Those of the house of Ishak own half and those of the house of Abdul Rub the other half. II. The second clan of the Yafa'i-as-Sufal in importance and numbers is the Dthube. Their territory is the southern portion or the YafaT-as-Sufal and they are bounded on the south by the Yafa'i-Bani-Kasid, on the east by the country of Am-Rasas, on the west by the Bo’si clan and on the north by the Mausata and the Dabiani. The total fighting strength of the Dthube is about 5,000 men. The Shekh of the Dthube is Muhammad Muthana bin Atif Jabir living in the town of Dthi Surah whose authority extends over the whole clan, with the exception of the Hadrami who are practically independent. It is divided into seven principal sections—- ( 4 ) As-Su’aidi. (1) Surri- ( 2 ) Sharafi. ( 3 ) As-Sal ah i ( 5 ) At-Taffi. (6) As-Saili. ( 7 ) A 1 -Hadrami. The latter section, as is also evidenced by their, name, have migrated to his country from the AYadi Hadramaut. 1. The section of As-Surri live in the town of Dthi Surah. They are 4,000 in numbers. 2. The town of the Ash-Sharafi is 'Antar with 2,000 inhabitants. Their villages are— o Population. Population.

The next largest clan among the Yafa’i-as-Sufal is that of the Muflahai who originally migrated from Sad Marib. The territory of this clan is divid ed into two portions, the larger of which is located on the eastern side of the Wadi Bana, beyond the Halmin and the Shaibi and has for its chief villao-e Ah Jurba, the smaller portion being north, north-west and north-east of Jabal Harir and the Shairi country, and having for its chief village Al-Khalla. The section of the Muflahais are— (1) As-Sakkaf. ( 2 ) As-Sulmani. ( 3 ) Ad-Dabrosbi. ( 5 ) Al-Mashali. ( 4 ) Ad-Dtharbani. (6) Al-Muflahai of Khalla. The head of the Muflahai as a elan is Shekh Abdul Rahman bin Kasim As-Sakkaf of Ah Jurba, who is an influential man in Yafa’i-as-Sufal, with a large personal following.269 5 . Masli'ali’s sub-sections are as under :— Talbi S tlmi or Hakami llilali .. Sa’adi Asbalii ...

In Dahira, Abdul Hadi has half share and Abdul Rah has ^ share and the remaining 5 share is divided amongst the Shekhsof Khalla (MohsinMana, eto.). In Khalla, Abdul Hadi has | sha^e ; Abdul Rah has £ and the rest belonging to Mohsin Mana and other Shekhs of Khalla. In Kharaba, Abdul Hadi has £ and his relatives have the other half. Arshi, Dar Ar-Itakka, A 1 Karema, Al-Manahi, Ash Sharej, belong to Abdul Rab. The total fighting strength of the Muflahais is estimated at 5,000 men. IV. The Bosi are a smaller clan than any of the preceding, their total popula tion is estimated at about 2,000 souls and the number of their fighting men at 500 . Their chief Shekh is Salim bin Ali Ad-Dubai, and under him is, amongst others, Akil Shaif Wahas Ad-Dubai. The Bosi country is flat plain intersected by small valleys the principal of which is the Wadi Al-Ab'us. The Bosi clan are bounded on the north by the Mausata elan, on the east by the Hadrami section of the Dube clan, on the south by the Dube clan and on the west by the Nakibi section of the Yazadi clan of the Y^afa’i Bani Kasid. [C 5 7 QMGIB] MM271 The district has continuously paid revenue to the Sultans of Yafah-As- Sufal for 200 years, and is a personal appanage of the reigning Sultan. The Turks sent troops into Rube’aten 32 years ago, during the period when Ahmad Muktar Pasha was Governor-General of Yemen. They probably collected revenue and continued sending troops once a year and collecting revenue, until three years and nine months ago, since which time they have not entered the country or collected revenue. During the period, of nearly 29 years that the Turks made the people of Rube’aten pay revenue to them, Rube’aten continued to pay its ordinary tribute to the Sultan of Yafa’i. The total population of Rube’aten is estimated at about 2,000 souls and their fighting men at 400 . The Shekhs are— ( 1 ) Yahia bin Askar bin Abdulla, of Ahl Abu Ali. ( 2 ) Saleh bin Ahmad Ali, of Aid Abu Ali—living in Kariat-Annifa—Akil Said Ahmad. ( 3 ) Yabia Nasir Omar Shibren, of Bani Shibren. Besides these Shekhs there are four Akils holding their lands and villages under grants from the Imams, and who pay no tribute to Sultan Kahtan, but on the contrary receive one-fifth of the revenue collected by the Shekhs. These Akils are— (1) Ahmad Hamada,Bani Kes. I (3) Saleh Muthanna Omar A1 Akri. (2) Ahmad Ahmad Kurtur, Bani Kes. | (4) Abdulla Ahmad Bubakr Mnrshed. These four Akils holding right from the Imams are called &lt;e Akbar/’ in contradistinction to the Shekhs and rayas. The Shekhs pay Kahtan annually a sum varying from 20 to 40 dollars each, according to whether the country has had a good or bad season ; each fighting man }ays Sultan Kahtan annually 8 annas as a tax. Rube’aten is divided into four districts— (1) Rubh-Al-Ilawi. (2) Rubh Al-Akri. Rubh-Al-Ilawi has the villages of— (1) Khulia ... ... ... Akil Muzaid Mohsin. (2) A1 Kabira ... ...

The Bani Kes section under the control of Shekh Yahia bin Askar bin Abdalla live in the town of Bani Kes (Akils Ahmed bin Ahmed and Ahmed Abdalla Hamada). The Rafai Tarika section (originally from Upper Egypt) occupy the villages. (1) Kharoa (Akils Saleh. Bubakr ar Rafai, Abdul Rahman, Muhammad Musa, Muhammed Saleh). ( 5 ) Arash (Akils Mohsio Ali and Omar Ahmad). VII. The Shaibi clan is a large one whose connection with the main el ms of the Yafah-As-Sufal is somewhat indefinite consisting mainly of a doubtful claim by the Nakibs of the Mausata to tribute and military assistance from the Shaibi. . T1 &gt;e total population of the Shaibi is estimated at about 10,000 sou’s and their total fighting strength at about 2.500 men. The approximate boundaries of their territories are on the west the districts of Mares ; on the north Rube’aten ; on the east Dabiani, Reu, and the Muflahai ; on the south-west the Muflahai of Khalla j and on the south east the Halmin tribe. The country is a high and broad mountain ridge with deep valleys drain ing north and east to the River Bana. A small amount of coffee is grown, also icd and white jowari, and barley as rain crops j by irrigation from wells, wheat and lucerne. The elevation being between 6,000 to 8,000 feet above the sea, the climate is cool and pleasant. The head Shekh of the clan is Ali Mana as Sakladi who lives at the town of Bakhal.The total population of the Yazidi is about 2,000 and their fighting men 600 , these figures being exclusive of the Nakibi. Their head Shekh is Husen bin Muhammad Ali Batali residing at Ali Khadra. The important section of the Yazidi called the Nakibi is sometimes considered as a clan in itself, and its origin is Kasadi, the tribe who formerly ruled in Makalla. The following are Nakibi villages (1) Hanakat-Di-Nakib.j ( 3 ) Rahwab. I ( 5 ) Hamhuma. ( 2 ) Madik. | ( 4 ) Bani-As-Siyal. j (6) Mudedha. ( 7 ) A 1 Arakah. All the above seven villages are situated in Selat-Dthi-Nakib. The Nakibi can muster about 400 fighting men. Dthala ; ') G, WARNEFORD, 14th November 1903. Political Officer.o 279 Chapter VI.— The Wadi Tiban, The valley of the \\ adi Tiban practically forms the western boundary Wadi of Amiri territory which it traverses from north to south. Its source is Tioan. in the Turkish sphere of influence beyond the mountain ranges of Jabal Suhban and Jabal Badan through which it passes before entering the lands of the Dakkam tribe (Amiri). Above this point its course has not been reconnoitred. Traversing the Dakkam territory between Miles, steep banks, with cultivation here and there on each side and the lofty ^ mountain of Jabal Hasha on the right, it enters a deep gorge between a that mountain and Jabal Jihaf about half a mile below the village of Karad (Dakkam). Two miles further on a narrow gate, the Bab Fajra A 1 Ali is reached with lofty precipices on either side. Another five miles and the Shab Mofattah, a dry ravine on the right bank is reached mark- s ing the boundary between the Dakkam and Ahmadi tribes. Cultivation recommences here and a mile further on is the village of Rahwat A 1 Abdalla (Ahmadi). The junction of the *Wadi Tabaghain is reached on the left bank in 10 2 miles. A well frequented trade route follows the bed of this Wadi and turns down the Tiban. It is made use of by caravans trading between Dala, Mavia in Turkish territory and Musemir (Haushabi). The river bed between Karad and the Tabaghain is but little used as a road. The going is rough and stony. In the actual pass it involves wading down the bed of the stream often between boulders of considerable size! It would be impracticable if the stream were swollen and dangerous if there were a chance of a freshet or spate. But under normal condi tions though tedious, it can be and has been used by men, horses and ba gg a g e animals. If an advance party be sent ahead to remove obs tacles left by the last floods, the passage of a column will be much facilitated. After passing the confluence of the Tabaghain two small villages are I2 passed on the left bank, a short gorge about half a mile long with a large detached rock in the bed of the stream at either end is traversed and I3 the Wadi Hora on the right bank is reached 2 miles lower down. A mile further down, the Wadi Tusan comes in on the right bank also nearly opposite the village of Tawarsa. A caravan route to Mavia pro ceeds up the Tusan. There is another short gorge half a mile further on, on emerging from which Dar A1 Husen, the residence of the Ahmadi Shekh, is seen, picturesquely perched on the right bank. Two miles below, the Wadi Hilhal (up which an alternative route to Mavia proceeds) comes in on the right bank just beyond Takafal, a well IS built village on a bluff on the left bank. The river-bed now becomes more open, the hills in the immediate vicinity of it lower, the course of the river is less winding and the crossings constantly fewer. A few poor villages are passed. In 4 miles the Wadi Shan on the left bank is reached and this is the limit of the Ahmadi territory. A little frequented 19 route leading over a steep pass goes up the Wadi to Dala traversing Mehrabi and Azraki territory en route. •Note.— For detail concerning tributary ravines, Section II, Part II ' Ahmadi.’'280 Miles. 28 34 44 5 o S 3 Continuing down stream the hills close in again, the river resumes its winding course and is frequently dammed for irrigation purposes, chan nels leading from field to field, and frequently carried round bluffs of rock supported on built-up banks of stone and sometimes on timber. The villages of Sukami (both banks) —Mubarek (right bank)— here the Selat Mubarek comes in from Jabal Warwa on the right—-and Dirjud are passed in the order named and in 2 miles El Kama is reached. This is a conspicuous ruined fort on an isolated rock on the right bank commanding the valley for some distance both up and down stream at a bend. It appears to have been deserted owing to natural decay, the walls having fallen apart. The course of the stream now becomes very winding, the hills on either side more or less precipitous, culminating on the right bank in the lofty and inaccessible peaks of Jabal Warwa, frequented by ibex. The villages of Hasna and Ma’amrat on the right bank, Dal and Lijma on the left bank are passed and that of Makhran left bank) is reached two miles below El Kama. The Wadi Makhran comes in on the left bank just below it. A track—said to be difficult for loaded camels— leads up this valley and across a pass into the Wadi El Mileh where it joins the Mishwara route just below the well of Uluf-Uluf. Half a mile lower down the river issues from the mountains in a narrow gorge, those on the right bank receding in a westerly direction towards Ad Dareja. On quitting the gorge, Bashariya, a village with a white mosque, is seen on the left bank and after passing the ruined tower of Majar and other small villages of stone hovels with thatched roofs (Di Ashar, Fusel, Kubbib, Gaudun) Musemir is reached in 5 miles. Musemir is the residence of the Haushabi Sultan, whose dwelling is a large 3-storied building of mud bricks surrounded by two or three detached groups of huts. Continuing, the river passes through a defile a mile below, Jabel Mana with its perpendicular precipices conspicuous on the left,bank, and again traverses a plain between banks of sixty feet or more. Four miles more and the Warezan—a perennial stream with a flow about half that of the Tiban—comes in on the right bank opposite the village of Habil Masweda and a mile further on the Akkan, reduced in the dry season to a few chains of brackish pools, also on the right bank. The spar of Dar Akkan opposite the tower of that name is just below the junction on the right bank. It is a good tactical position commanding as it does the junctions of the Warezan and the Akkan with the Tiban and was occu pied by a British and Native detachment in the early part of 1903, but was abandoned on account of its unhealthiness. The ranges of hills, higher on the right bank than the left, now close in again and continue to within about 2 miles of Nobat Dukem, the village of Jol Madram (left bank) being passed on the way. At Nobat Dukem the hilly region is quitted for good, a barren plain is traversed and in 6 miles the village (mud walled) of Al Anad is reached. This is the first village in the Sultan of Lahej’s territory, and just beneath it the valley of the Bilih water-course almost unites with the Tiban. Tw'o miles further on is the large village of Shakka marking the commencement of the highly cultivated district of Lahej and a mile beyond is Zaida. These two last villages are both on the left bank and are similar in character, built of mud bricks and walled as protection against the robbers of the Subehv tribe.r 1 - 28i Below Zaidathe course of the Tiban divides into two branches, the left or eastern one being called the Wadi As Saghair the right or western one , the Wadi Al Kabir, the main district of Lahej between them. Ihelett branch is usually dry except during a flood and gradually dies away. The right branch is the main stream, but its waters are eventually absorbed by the cultivation. Between the district of Lahej and the sea there is a barren tract of land. It is said that the waters of the Tiban occasionally, although rarely, reach the sea after abnormal floods in the rainy season. Although the stream is perennial, short waterless stretches of river bed will be met with during the greater part Dimensions. of the year between Bashariya and Musem.r, This is owing to the entire volume ot water— which in the dry season is not very considerable—being led off into the cultivation and returned again lower down During bebruary (1904) a stretch of about 500 vards immediately below Mus^mir remained dry. On the 'trd of February a stretch of nearly a mile below Bashariya was dr&gt;. Two ^1 a vs later water was observed to be running in this stretch, but a similar portion of river-bed somewhat lower down was observed to be dry. This rcourse°was due to the manipulation o stream by he .nhab. tants in accordance with recognized water-rights. On the 3 r(1 ™ beb,ua £ he vLter in Ihe gorge above Basharia was runmng m a smgle nvulet 6 feet broad with a® average depth of 4 inches but in the ramy season the normal size ot the stream when not swollen by floods or would be about 15 to 20 feet broad with a depth of one foot.

Epitome.-~Th\s is the route that was regularly used by troops and convoys march ing from Aden to Dala in 1903, and is the line taken by the Field Telegraph. Standing camps were pitched at all the stages. Wheeled artillery and camel carts were taken as far as Nobat Dukem, but not without difficulty owing to the heavy sand in parts. The road is fit for camel transport throughout. Length 74. miles, 6 stages, The first 2% stages are through Abdali territory. Thence to half-way on the 5th stage Haushabi, thence a few miles only in Alawi territory, and the vest of the route in the Amir of Dala’s territory. Stages 1 to 3 through open level country, mostly sandy desert. Then mountains are entered, but road is tairly level, following up valleys, till the steep pass, 780 feet ascent, up to Dala is reached on the last stage. Forage and fuel at all stages must be arranged for beforehand. Greatest scarcity is at stages 4 and 5.

The path is over good firm open ground for 1 mile to the place where the river di vides to form the Lahej delta, then very heavy sand for 2 miles, then rises on to good firm ground, passing through cultivation. At 4^ miles it passes east of Zaida, a mud- walled fortified enclosure, and at 6 miles Shaka, a mud -built village,both on the river bank. There is good camping ground near Shaka, and a route branches east across the desert to Dar Sheban (see Route No. 11 ). 2 wells at Shaka. The Wadi Tiban here runs in a broad gravelly bed with well defined banks, 20 to 30 feet high in places. The light alluvial soil bordering the river is much broken by ravines, and the path is often flooded and rendered difficult for camels while the fields are under irrigation; a good track can always be found by keeping a little to the east. From Shaka the direction is north, up the left bank of the 1 iban. The dry Se at B'hh is crossed at its junction with the Tiban.

Al Milah 3 1 47 Leaving Nobat Dukem northwards, the path runs for the first mile and a quarter over high-lying open ground,^then descends easily into the bed of the Selat Bilih and follows it up to 8 miles. It is a broad winding shingly torrent bed between steep hills, the banks fringed with tamarisk, and acacia, and coarse grass. To the east is the peak of Jabal Manif. (A good alternative road, made by the sappers and minors in 1903, runs along the left bank, joining the kajila track A1 Mukhalla at 3 miles and cutting into the riverbed again at 4 miles) At 7 miles is Matlah a camping-ground much used by caravans, but the water in some holes is scanty and impure. The Wadi here maVes a bend, and the path, leaving it, goes up a dry water-course north-east for a mile, then over open stony plateau land, good firm going; then descends easily between reeky hills to Al Milah. . , . , r u j Al Milah is a small collection of wretched huts on the right bank of the dry stony Selat Al Milah. . . . Camp on the opposite, left, bank, in a clear space among mimosa jungle. There is an old well in the bed of the Wadi a short way below the village, and a little above the old well is th elarge new well dug in 1903, which affords good and ample water-supp y. The site of the post established in 1903 is a low rocky hill, 500 yards north-east of the camp, and above the right bank of the Selat Al Juma which drains to the Selat Am Suhebiya. Waterholes dug in the bed of the Selat Al Juma, afford plentiful water, only about 8 feet below the surface. Very little forage procurable locally ; plenty of fuel. «; Ghail Hardaba 12 59 From Al Milah the direction is a little east of north straight towards the Jimil hill which lorms a good landmark. The path leads among rocky hills, but is very good and firm. It n«jes to cross some ridges, and at 6 miles descends into the bed of the Wadi Am Suhebiya just below J imil. (To the right, by a well called Bir Mahbaja, and the village of Sh’ab Ad Diwan is the site of the Jimil poet of 1903.)2 88 Route No. I— conid. The-path turns north up the stony bed of the Wadi Am Suhebiva for a mile, then ascends on to the Habilen plateau; the territory of the Amir of Dala is here entered. I o the east is the village of As Sulek, and the site of the post established in 1003. The path runs good and level actoss the c tony Babilen plateau till'at 10 miles it descends rather steeply into the bed of the Selat Hardaba. Then winds easilv up the stony bed until the springs of Ghail Hardaba are reached at 12 miles.

Continuing up the Hardaba wate-course, which is here more open and less winding, the village of Ar Kadu’a is reached at 7! miles (half a mile above it on a rocky hill on the left bank is the site of the post established in 1903). I he route here leaves the Hardaba water-course and goes up a tributary nullah in which is a spring, and caravan halting place in a narrow gorge, then winds up over a spur and down into the Selat Rabad, ‘hen turns up it to the toot of the Nakil Rabad at lio miles. The ascent of the pass is 780 feet in about a nule, the path winding up steep rocky slopes. The gradient is generally easy, b^t there are one or two steep zigzags for a short distance. Laden camels take about an hour to make the ascent. From the top of the pass the path descends easily through fields to the village of Kaflat Zubed. Hence two paths lead to Dala. The one to the west of Kaflat Zubed passes betwe -n that village and Marsaba, up a narrow cultivated valley, Wadi Diak, well wooded with ulub trees. At 13 miles is a steep rocky ascent of 200 feet, after which the path is nearly level, past the village of Habil Di Ishar to l)ala, 1 he other path from Zubed passes east of Kaflat Zubed, and west of Laghwal, winds among rocky hills, quite good and ea-y. At 14! miles ascends rather steeply to eeoas a col whence it descends easily skirting the- foot of the steep hill east o f Dala town, till it enters Dala from the east The latter path is the more direct for tro«ps camped north of Dala town. ALTERNATIVES TO SOME STAGES OF ROUTE No. 1.

It runs along the left bank of the Wadi Tibnn, the bed of which is some 80 feet below. At first the route goes north-west over firm open level ground. At 3 miles is Tannan, a disused “ Dar ”. After this the road crosses several deep nullahs. At 7I miles is Jol Madram where there is some cultivation in the riverbed, and good camping ground on either bank. From Jol Madram the road is level to ti miles, then crosses two deep nullahs. Dar Akkan is reached at 12 miles. Camping ground anywhere on the bank of the river. The m litary post established in 1903 is miles distant, on the top of a steep hill, up which the road leads. On leaving Dar Akkan the track descends into the bed of the river, but soon ascends the left bank again and goes along it, a wel marked track, passing Habil Ma~ weda and keeping close along the foot-hills of Jabal Mana so as to avoid the deep nullahs which run into the Tiban. (In the dry season the Arabs prefer to take their camels along the river-bed, but if there is any likelihood of flood, it is better to keep to the upper road.) At 3 miles the river passes through a narrow gorge, and the track descends into the bed and leads up the gorge. If there be a flood, it is necessary to wait till it has subsided. After traversing the gorge which is £ mile long, the path goes through some fields in the river-bed and ascends the left bank at 4^ miles. At 6 miles Musemir is reached, a group of five Dars, the residence of the Sultan of the Haushabi. From Musemir the path winds up the cultivated vadey of the Wadi Tiban. Th e valley is 200 to 300 yards w ide betw een steep banks, 100 to 200 feet high. I he stream is insignificant in the dry season, parts of the river-bed are quite dry at times, the water beino- led off for irrigation. At io| miles, just above the village of Bashiriya the valley narrows to a rocky gorge, and the stream was dammed, so that one had to wade lor a short distance through 2 feet of water. Above the gorge the dry Wadi Makhran joins the Tiban valley from the east (a route fit for camels branches up it and over a difficult pass, to Masnah on the Mashwara route See Lateral Communications, t). Continuing up the Tiban, Lijma is reached at 12 miles in a wide cultivated part of the valley. Good camping-ground on the fields; forage, fuel, and grain procurable with due notice.

Above A 1 Kama is a narrow defile, the vauey men widens again, anu me path crosses and re-crosses the I iban ; the bed is stony, but the going is quite good except for the frequent wading. '1 here are several hamlets on either side with patches of cultivation. At 3 miles a rather difficult route branches east up the Wadi Shan and across the hills to the Azraki country. {See Lateral Communications, 4.) Here is the northern limit of the Haushabi, and continuing up the Tiban, Ahmadi territory is entered. Pass Khurba and several small villages, and at 6| miles a route branches west up the Wadi Hilhal to Mavia. Still crossing and recrossing the T iban, pass 'I akafal and Ar Rona on the left bank, and reach A 1 Husen at 8 miles; good camping space on fields ; residence of Shekh Awas of the Ahmadi. I he Tiban is about 10 to 20 yards wide in the dry season, and a foot deep. Just above A 1 Husen is a narrow gorge, then the valley widens again and a good route leads west up the Wadi Shurman and across the Turkish border to Mavia. Continuing past A 1 Hujra and A 1 Arish both on the left bank with stretches of cultivated land, the mouth of the Wadi Tabaghain is reached at 10 miles. Good camping ground ; supplies procurable. The Wadi Tiban is here about 6 yards wide and 8 inches deep in the dry season.

At 4 miles is A 1 Kuren on a spur above the south bank ; at 43 miles Mazaba, and at 5! Adina. The fields above Adina are watered by an irrigation channel, and hence onwards is a perennial stream. The valley narrows to a gorge between precipices of sheer rock ; the path is quite good, crossing and recrossing the stream, the banks of which are well-wooded. At 7 miles a deep gorge, Shab Nakab, joins from the south. At 8 miles the valley opens again, and by the springs whicti give rise to the above mentioned stream is the camping-ground of An Namasa. Supplies procurable from the neighbouring Ahmadi villages of Mathad, Mazaba, etc. 8 Dala ... 12 The path continues east up the bed of the Wadi which is here dry and stony. At starting Mathad is passed on the north bank and on the south bank a place where a Sunday market is held, and near it the village of Mazaba (from the latter place a steep camel path branches south to the plateau of A 1 Hakl, 2 miles distant). At one mile the valley narrows to the gorge of A 1 Madiak, the meeting place of the territories of the Ahmadi, the Humedi, the Mafari, and the Azraki. Beyond the short gorge is the wide cultivated valley of the Azraki. The valley of the Wadi al Bun joins from the north. The path continues east, either in the bed of the Wadi or through the fields on its southern bank, passing the Azraki villages of Habla, Walan, and Al Kabah on the south bank, and Shab Aswad, Al Masnah, and Ad Danaba on the north. To the north is the precipitous bluff of Jabal Mafari. At 53 miles the Mashwara route joins from the south, and the path leaving the bed of the Wadi just short of Ad Darb turns north up a somewhat steep rocky ascent of a mile, then down to the bed of the Wadi again at 8 miles, and north up it passing Dar Matahin where are good springs. At 9^ miles commences a steep ascent up a rocky gorge known as Nakil Darja an Nishfi ; the fir^t part is a rough zigzag, and near the top is another zigzag roughly paved and slippery. I he total ascent is 500 feet; there is a flowing stream in the gorge.

The track crosses cultivation, level and gocd going for about 2g miles. Then an easy ascent up the Nakil Rakab and a rather steep descent to the Selat Sudan about I s - mile further. The Selat Sudan contains a good supply of flowing water. Reported bad for drinking purposes. Crossing the S.

A little above this point is a w'dl in bed, Bir Adlan, containing normally about 6 ft. good water. Site of Com mission Camp on small stony plateau on ri«ht bank, not well-suited for military camp. At two miles several hamlets on either bank, the Wadi turns a little north of west! The Turkish boundary is passed about § mile beyond, just above a tower, Dar Nasir Harbi, on left bank. The Wadi continues in the same direction for i | miles commanded by high hills to the south and bv a low rocky ridge to the north. Several small hamlets are passed, among them Mirza with a w-ell in the bed, which, w'ith a small stream in the Wadi Mirza joining the right bank, supplied the Turkish Commission and escort of 200 men. 'I he Wadi Natid, here called the Wadi Zawani, turns south-west for a mile, and then west. At 9 miles from Hawemi, the track leaves the left bank of the Wadi which has considerably narrowed, and strikes west over the level plain to Rahda which is reached at about 13 miles.

The Ghail Jashiya, a small stream joining the Warezan is crossed, and a thickly wooded plain leads to the Warezan which is rrosssd. Cultivation is then traversed with several small hamlets on the right hand (Dar Shekh Hail and Makaia). The dry Wadi Mahes, in which there is a good well, is crossed, and passing between two low knolls with Dar Shekh Abdu Nasher on left hand, Badu country is left and Khadir entered at the village of Dimna, close to the track on the right hand. A grave-yard is traversed and the Wadi Rahban containing a stream, crossed. Several hamlets being passed on the right, the village of Zailai, the half-way ha’ting-place for caravans to Taiz, is reached. Here there is a spring and two welli. Track level and good throughout. From Zailai the dry Wadi Katan is ascended and leads to a steepish pass, the Nakif Sureh, giving access to a level plateau which is traversed, The district ot Taizia is entered here.

Wadi Farj joins from the west and a little before another nullah from the east. From the well, an easy ascent up a fair but stony track, leads after i mhe to the top of the Mad raja pass. The track at summit is in a cutting with hills rising steeply on either hard. Just after descent -commences, a good paved road is met, which winds rather steeply down south slope on side of spur in reentrant ravine. The road-way made some years ago by the Sultan of Lahej, is in good repair, from 3 to 6 yards broad and solidly banked up with stones. It offers no difficulties to transport but pass is bound to cause some delay. Made road about £ mile long ; track then follows Wadi Kaifi, sandy with low rocky ridges on either side. Track to Lahej branches on left bank. Some thorn scrub which requires clearing. At 6| miles track leaves main nullah on rmht bank and difficult going ensues up narrow nullahs and stony uplands, causing much delay to transport for 3 miles about in a southerly direction. At 8| miles, track des- cendsinto cultivated Wadi, opposite Dar Abdalla Amad, at Bir Mulehia. Well prac tically contains no water. Three stone towers on little hills and huts of karbi.

At 3 mites, moderate short descent into small nullah leading over short stony bit into Wadi Jibu, sandy bed with steepish banks which is followed for about a mile. A further low pass, bad for transport, leads into Wadi Dumi which is followed for a short distance and another rough little pass leads into the cultivated valley of Wadi Alasan, at 6 miles. The shrine of Wali Hassan is a short distance up the Alasan on the left bank. Wadi Alasan broad wadi with strips of cultivation and tamarisk trees , high ground on both banks.

Sh’ab Moharrak, small nullah, joins on right bank and the Wadi turns north, passing the Dubeni village of Tafih (30 houses) | mile further up on left bank. A little further, the low hill Ghara- ka is passed on left bank with a group of Masfari and Atawi villages. At 2 miles, the Wadi Ma’bak, a broad sandy Wadi with high banks, much tamarisk, joins from the west. There is a shallow' well in the Wadi at this point. Right bank continues high and much w'coded. Small village of Hajeri | mile distant on spur of J. Reshash. A little further up, ravine Gharaka joins left bank and another small village is passed. At 2f miles Ghorik, a village in two parts of some 30 houses and towers, is passed on right bank. Well in nullah. A weekly market is held here. Half mile to the west is the shrine of Sanawi with village and well. Almost opposite, small W. Hajur joins and another shallow well is passed. At 3^ miles a group of small Jurabi villages of l or 2 towers apiece on small conical hills is passed on either bank among groves of date-palms and irrigated fields. The right bank becomes less abrupt. The cultivated Wadi Sh’ab branches at right angles to the left bank behind a palm grove. At the 4th mile, high hills close in on either side, still however, leaving a strip of cultivation, and ^ mile further up, the stream-Ghail Maula—again appears in the Wadi, below this being led off to the fields. A small hamlet—Hajet Ma’fa—is on the right bank. Up to this point general direction north-west, hence on, north. For another § mile there is a defile narrowing to 80 yards between high steep hills ; a strip of high reeds and tamarisk on either side. The small villages of Humara and Sharj Ate are, passed on the right and left banks respectively. At about 5^ miles the ravine, Sh’ab Tashiya, joins the right bank almost opposite a watch-tower formerly built by the Sultan of Lahej. At 6 miles, Maula, a village of 20 houses, inhabited by Sayids, is passed on the right bank and opposite is the small village of Auja. From this point the valley opens out, containing cultivation and palm-groves. Several fair-sized Athwari and Shajefi villages (Turkish)—notably Anashi—are passed on the left bank below the high hill of Husn Mafalis. Mafalis itself is reached at about 7 miles on the right bank. A village of some 20 houses with the white Dar of the Athwari Shekh conspicuous above it. The customs post is a small Dar in the vicinity. Kaid Na’man, the Athwari Sheikh, is also the head of the local customs post assisted by his own tribesmen. There are no regular troops normally. Ghail Dabab which rises above, furnishes Mafalis with a plentiful supply of good water. The surrounding country is cultivated and the fertile hills to the north must provide abundant supplies.Alternative to stage 7, joined at Tafih, i mile to north of Kuhlan. Alternative route from Kuhlan to Mafails. A track from Am Farsba branches northwards from near the Wali of ’Umar Ibra him, before Kuhlan is reached. It passes just to the east of the village of Tafih. mostly over undulating, uncultivated ground between the hills of 1 urra and Furi to Wadi Sh’ab which it crosses. Thence an ascent of f mile over a somewhat stony pass between the high hills of Kawa on left and Nabat on right, and a descent of the same distance. It joins the Wadi Ma’din in Turkish territory near the village of Anashi. This track has lately been used by caravans to avoid passing the Humedi tower Dar Abd Muham mad. The path is stony and in need of improvement, but offers no serious difficulty to transport. It is far more direct as a road from Am Farsha to Mafalis than the winding bed of the W. Ma’din. but there is no suitable halting place with water or supplies on the road. The road can be joined from Kuhlan itself near Tafih. The pass between Kawa and Nabat is called the Nijd Rifad and the track takes its name from this.3 12 Route No. X. {Lateral) Track connecting Route g with the coast at Ras Al ( Ara.)

Am Faira (Khulefi Subehi) comprises 3 towers (2 rumed) on low hilIs, and has one well of good water, near the junction of W. Musinna from north with W. Am Karia. It supplied 300 men and 300 camels, as well as large flocks of sheep and goats. Popu lation mostly nomadic. Karbi can be collected with 1 day’s notice. Camping ground (unlimited) on ground near well, or on and near low hill, to south of Wadi Am Karia. No difficulty to ttansport, but tiring marching for troops. From Am Fajra, a fair track leads across a stony undulating plain covered with acacia trees, direction almost due west. No difficulty for transport and good marching. Narrow front necessary, however, as stony plain precludes broader formation. To the north are foot hills of the high range; to south open plain, oevciai small ravines are crossed, the most considerable, the W. Am Shahar, at 3 i miles. At 4! miles, a stony track descends.steeply 100 to 200 feet and crosses a broad aeepcleft,formedby the Wadis Am Hulaya and Majdura, which are separated by lo’v ridge.

Immediately after the Wadi Majdura is crossed, the track ascends a steep bank and passing over a ridge, leads, after a short descent to Wadi-am-Kudera, which is crossed. Thence on a stony plain, thickly overgrown with acacia affording excellent camel grazing. The Wadi Adim, at this point broad and sandy with low banks, is reached at about miles. Kariat-am-Nassera, consisting of 4 towers on little hills with some cultivation, about a mile before. The best camping-ground with space for 1 battalion, is on a ‘ HabiP’ about ^ mile south of the village, below a ruined tower on left bank of Wadi Adim.

At 4 miles a track leading north from Jaruba, crosses at right angles. Several shallow nullahs are crossed. At 7 miles, a low defile leads gradually down to an acacia covered plateau, on the left bank of Wadi ’Ubil, and from this, a track leads down into the Wadi ’Ubil at 8 miles. Nobat Mijza, a large tower, is passed a little before. On the right bank of Wadi ’Ubil is another tower, Oar Maruaza, and some karbi huts, hxcellent camp for large force on high plateau on right bank. Date-palms and cultivation in Wadi.

Shallow well in Wadi and small pools f mile below in Wadi- am jueil. At 7 miles the track, passing fora short distance up the Wadi Mashkara, enters the Mudariba valiey, skirting the north foot ofj. Am A.biad which closes the valley to the south. A shrine Walt Salih ba Thabit is passed at 8th mile on the left. Track then enters the Wadi al Malaha, which it follows to its junction with the Wadi Khosana at 9 miles. Right bank well cultivated, with many date-palms, several small hamlets of one or two tovvers apiece, standing back from the Wadi, form the settlement of Mudariba. Plenty of karbi can be obtained from the inhabitants (Sufis); grain and other local supplies in small quantities Abundant stream of good water, at junction of Wadis Khosana and Malaha, flowing at intervals fcr about 3 miles down the Wadi Turan or Timnan.

Camping-ground on plain near Wali Salih-ba- Thabit,or on fields near stream. Mudariba (1,200 ft) From the junction of the Wadis Khosana and Malaha, the track follows the bed of the Wadi 4of Timnan or Turan, in a south-easterly direction, miles. passing two small towers with cultivation on the left bank. High steep hills enclose the Wadi on either side. The stream flows and dies away at intervals. At two miles, the Wadi-am-Jueil joins the left bank. This Wadi could be followed from Tahamia without entering the Mudariba valley but contains one or two low rocky steps which would give some difficulty to transport at present. At about Am Shat3*4 3 miles, the high hills end and (he valley becomes more open. The last of the stream is also seen here. The bed contains heavier sand and widens out At 4 miles Wadi-am-Hajarten, continuation of Wadi Bilan, joins right bank. About 2 miles above Am Shat some cultivation is passed on the right bank and a fair well, in a field standing back about 50 yards from the Wadi. Am Shat is reached at 8 miles, a villag-e of about 30 houses on a plateau over looking t he left bank of the Wadi Turan. There is a well just abreast of the village and another f mile below it on the left bank. Good water and fair supply.

J From Hisi Ahmad, the track ascends the Wadi Tarbaha in a north-west direction, crosMng numerous dry and shallow w’ater-courses. No difficulty to transport. The valley is from I to 2 miles broad, gently undulating and stony, much intersected by water-courses and covered with low scrub. It is enclosed by hills on north-east and south west. At about 81 miles the Wadi Hurim is reached at Ghail Kuleta. A good direction point is a vein of white stone on the hill to north-w r est of the Wadi Hurim shaped roughly like a Greek Ample space for camping on stony upland on left bank and plentiful supply of good water from spring pools in the Wadi Hurim.

Wood and camel grazing plentiful. Kakaba l,8oo feet. 1\ 39 miles. The Wadi Hurim, direction north-north-west, can be ascended from the start, or a track followed on stony plateau above left bank level at first, but later crossing several steep ravines, which joins the Wadi after about 3 miles. The former is preferable for transport. The Wadi Hurim, with high banks, is about 100yards wide at Kuleta but gradually narrows. The bed is very stony in places. It is commanded almost through out by heights on either side. A few wild fig trees used as camel fodder and many acacia on banks. The bed, in which three small springs are passed, is ascended for 3 miles. For about the next miles the track crosses and recrosses the wadi. A w'ell is passed on the left at 4$ miles. Just beyond this point, Wadi-al-Hathor joins from the west and the track leaves the Wadi and ascends and traverses a stony plateau on thie left bank for about a mile—the Barh al Haima.

Ascending the Wadi-a!- Haiki in north-east direction from this point for about f mile, a well, Bir as Suk, sup plying several towers, is passed on the right. A narrow gorge with sheer cliffs on either side is passed through, leading to the bifurcation of the Wadi at 7$ miles, the right-hand branch being called As Samada and that to the left As Salh. Best camping-ground, space for two battalions with transport, in the angle on a stony plateau, but in case of hostilities, at least 3 piquets would be required on adjacent heights- Ample supply of water of good quality in both the Salh and Samada Wadis from streams about a mile above the bifurcation. 300 men and 400 animals produced no appreciable diminution on that in the Samada. Karaba about 12 towers with out buildings, scattered over about miles length, on both banks of Wadi. 4 Wells. Strips of cultivation on banks. Native supplies and forage in small quantities.

It is very rough and at the foot of the range passes through dense mimosa jungle. Laden camels cannot dscend the range and donkeys must be used. Some can be obtained with two days’ notice from the ’Akil of the Kaur, Muhammad AbdaKa, as also a tribal escort against marauders. The Kaur, elevation about 7,500 ft., is ascended and crossed. By leaving Mijda at dawn, it is just possible to cross the Kaur, and descend into Wadi Tilhak before dusk. A small Bedouin village of 30 souls on the south bank, who possess a few goats and a few patches of barley cultivation. 6. AS SOMA.—12 miles. 72 miles. From Wadi Tilhak, track continues almost north, rises a short distance and then descends in zigzags over succession of terraced fields to Wadi Dihaura. On the north side of the Kaur is a wide plateau covered with low hills with intervening plains. Track continues close to bed of Wadi Dihaura, till at 6 miles some pools are passed. Here track turns a little west of north and at about ten miles, crosses steep and rocky gorge of Wadi Khalla (pools). Up to this point the track is exceedingly rugged and bad Beyond Wadi Khalla, it emerges on to a broad level plain, the Dahr plateau. This, on approaching As Soma, is much cut up by irrigation channels. Well cultivated and fertile with several wells of good water standing at 20 ft. below the surface. Said by natives to be plentiful the whole year round. As Soma or Sama, a town of about 3,000 souls. 7. POOLS IN WADI KHAURA.—16 miles. 88 miles. Leaving As Soma, the track continues a little east of north for about 7 miles, crossing three successive plains, skirted by low hills and ascending the mountains on the west bank of Wadi Kha’la. The path runs along the ridge of this eminence, the ’Akaba, which is the watershed between the Wadis Surum and Khalla. Little cultivation after leaving As Soma but large tracts of dry grass occur, affording excellent^ fodder and sprouting tresh after rain. The track to the ’Akaba is good but the ’Akaba is impassable for heavily laden camels and many caravans substitute donkeys for the journey to Ansab. At 7 miles the track turns east for a mile and leads by a most abrupt descent into Wadi Khalla with rough and stony bed, the banks wooded with mimosa and ’ulub trees and steep hills rising on either hand. A short distance further on, Wadi Khalla falls imo Wadi Surum by a precipitous gorge on the right bank. From the Sth mile, the track [CS7QMGIB] AAA349 follows Wadi Khalla, here called Wadi Khaura in a north noith-ea-t direction. A chain of pools of good water is reached at 16 miles. The water appears to be permanent. No habitations but occasional encampments of Bedouins gracing their flocks. 8. HOTA.—15 miles. 103 miles. The Wadi Khaura is followed north-north-east. At about 4 miles from the pools, the VV'adi Tirimid flows down a precipitous gorge on the left bank of the Khaura, and contains an inexhaus ible supply of water in pools, some of which are ten feet deep. Near this spot, thick clumps of tamarisk occur. At two miles below the junction, the Wadi opens out to a width of f mile, between two mountain ranges. A mountain spur abuts on the Wadi called A 1 Mukriba which saves foot passengers a detour. Thick jungle is encountered which does not obstruct the path, here running over light sand. $ mile from the Mukriba, shallow pools occur which require care to avoid fouling. It might be necessary to break the stage here. Further on, the ranges draw apart, and passing some Himiaritic ruins on a hill-slope to the left, the path swings away from the Wadi on to the plain of Khaura, a name applied to the village of Ali bin ’Alawi the ’Akil, and to the strip of country extending to Hota The path from Khaura rejoins the Wadi and passes the villages of Setanan and Hota at 13 and 15 miles respectively.

Curving a little west of north, a sandy plain with sparse scrub is traversed for about 5 miles, sloping towards Wadi Akhdar on the west. A belt of low thick bush is passed and the track passing between two hill spurs, through which runs Wadi Akhdar. emerges on the plain of Rahab. 1 rack east-north-eist across a broad open plain strewn with sm ill limestone slabs, strikes VVadi Laika at nearly 24 miles, passing a graveyard and cairn on the right. The gorge is followed north over some rather difficult stony going, a pool of brackish water being reached about a mile further on. Here the gorge opens to an amphitheatre 400 yards broad with precipitous sides, except to the north-north-east, the direction of the Wadi. The winding Wadi is followed till at 28 miles, Jol al Husan, a well known bivouac for caravans, is reached, a small deep pool of good water lying about a mile beyond this. 3.

Several villages west of the track about here. (There are no indications in report as to where this stage should be. As however bad going and a pass occur in next stage it is well not to stop too short.)35 1 5 - VESHBUM—14 miles. 87 miles. Crossing Wadi Meria, track leads north west through a broad tract of arable land into Wadi Rafal at about 1 mile, a narrow wooded gorge, between two peaks of Haid Sahaba, soon bearing north-east, fmd then, curving to north-west Here track leaves it and passes no th east on stony plateau on left bank,called jol al’Ark.
