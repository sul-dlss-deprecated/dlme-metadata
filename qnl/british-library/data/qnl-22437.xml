C Ldl vtNotes on Teaching for all Masters 1. A boy has a pair of eyes, a mind, a pair of ears, and a tongue. Make use of all these .properly and you will be a successful teacher. (a) Teach a boy by his sight—teach him by what he can see with his eyes, or can be made to see by guidance from you. (b) Make him use his mind—make him think. The question “ why ” cannot be asked too often by the Master, and a wrong answer is better than none. (c) Make him use his mind and his ears together, i.e., make him attend. Ask him questions frequently, and never ask questions in order, i.e., one boy after another as they sit in class, but scatter your questions ail over the class. If ji boy knows exactly when his turn for a question will come, he will sleep the rest of the time. Do not confine your questions to a few boys only. Remember also that a slack body and a slack mind go together. Make the boys sit up straight, and jump up quickly, and stand up straight when answering a question. (d) Make a bo\ use his tongue make the class talk j make them answer and ask questions, the mote this is done by the boys and the less by you the better. A class lesson is not a lecture. 2. Remember that boys always imitate. Therefore, always set a good example be careful of your dress and appearance, your way of standing, and your way of talking. 3. Don’t shout, but talk quietly and distinctly. Shouting only confuses boys. Only raise your voice to emphasize something important. 4. Be interested in your subject—if you are not, the class will not be. The mere you study your subject, the more interested you will be. Therefore, read books about your subject out of, school. 5. Prepare your lesson beforehand, and begin each lesson with a clear idea in your mind of what you are going to teach. Don’t be caught by the class, not knowing something that you ought to know about the lesson. Keep to the subject of the lesson. Don t waste time on things which have nothing to do with the lesson. It is advisable to write down notes beforehand in your Note Book on what you want to teach in the lesson, especially in subjects like History, Geography, Object Lessons, &amp;c. 6. Don’t make mistakes yourself, and don’t let the class make any mistakes without being collected. Encourage the boys to point out each other’s mistakes. Keep your own attention alert all the time. 7. Train the boys’ memories. Make them tell you at the end of a lesson what they have learnt. Give them short lists of words and names, etc., to learn at home. 4l Make ceitain that the class understand what you have taught them. It is not enough to say ‘ Do you understand ? ” and then be content with the answer “ yes.” Most boys will say “yes ” ter- to save themselves trouble, though they do not understand. Make the class show you tint thev understand by telling you what you have explained to them. 9. Remember that the brains of boys soon get tired, and cannot grasp very*much at one time. 1 herefore, do not try to teach them too much at one time, and watch carefully to see if their minds are getting weary. A little thoroughly understood and learnt, is better than much only half understood— e.g., in a reading lesson. (a) Begin with a revision of the last lesson by the class. (b) Spend not more than 25 minutes in reading by the pupils, each pupil reading only a few lines. “ y (c) Make the class tell you in their own words the story they have read. (d) Make the class write down from dictation, a few of the more difficult words from the lesson, and correct each other’s mistakes. 10. Let the boy use the blackboard occasionally for a few minutes only. Let them write or draw on it, and the class say whether the boy at the blackboard is right or wrong. . Don’t pick out only the best boy to go to the blackboard. 11. Written work. One period a week or half of two periods each week should be given up to written work, but in arithmetic there should be written work in every period. Insist on neatness and good arrangement. Other written work necessary should be done at home. Remember that the class lesson is for instruction chiefly. Instruction is not possible at home, therefore, doh’t waste time in class by written work which can be done at home. y Don’t waste time'by correcting written work in class while the class sit idle. Correct it at home, mark it and give it back to the class next day, pointing out any important mistakes. All written work must be dated by the boys. Insist on neatness and good writing. 12. A few boys will work well because they are keen and interested; the majority need inducement. Therefore, give marks to all boys for every lesson. Encourage competition.{ Jxt i r DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. Government Schools of Iraq. SYLLABUS OF THE PRIMARY COURSE OF STUDY. / APPROVED BY THE DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION AND THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE.

It is hoped that the English translation of the syllabus will assist P.O.s and A.P.O.s in their periodical visits to schools, and en able them to satisfy themselves that instruction is being carried out on the lines prescribed. The syllabus, as now issued, is based on considerable educa tional experience in Eastern countries. It has been drawn up as carefully as the circumstances permit, and has been examined and approved by the Education Committee. It must be emphasised, however, that it is only a provisional measure made to meet the urgent demands of the moment, and it is liable to revision and ex pansion in the future as conditions change. The special attention of all Masters is called to the “ General Hints on Teaching,” which are being issued as a separate publica tion. Headmasters of Elementary Schools must adopt the syllabus to suit their special needs, e.g., in schools where English is not taught, and where there are only four classes, the syllabus, as laid down for the Elementary Section of Primary Schools, should be followed in the First and Second-year Classes, while the syllabus for the four Primary Classes should be followed in outline in the Third and Fourth-year Classes with the substitution of other sub jects for English, e.g., Arabic, History, Geography, or Arithmetic, and the omission of detail where necessary. The time-table pub lished with the syllabus shows how the adaptation of periods is to be carried out. Pupils, who are non-Moslems, will not attend the lesson in Quran or Islam. In schools where the pupils of any one creed con stitute 25 per cent, or more of the total number, special arrange! ments will be made for their religious instruction during these hours by a teacher of .their own faith, whose salary will be paid in whole or in part by the department. In cases where such pupils form less than 25 per cent., the Headmaster shall arrange with the parents, should the latter de sire it, for these pupils to receive religious instruction as above, but not at the expense of the department. Where this is impractic able, owing to the lack of a competent teacher or otherwise, the pupils shall spend the period in studying those subjects in which they are backward. V if2 / Daily Time-table. The daily time-table for Elementary and Primary Schools will be as follows :— Period. Morning. 1st 8.0 — 8.45 2nd 8.50— 9.35 3rd • 10.0 —10.45 4th 10.50—11.35 Afternoon. 5th 1.30— 2.15 6th 2.20— 3. 5 7th 3.15— 4. 0 Government schools are closed on Thursday afternoons and on Fridays. In Primary Schools, the Elementary Section, and in Element ary Schools, the First and Second years will devote the period 3.15 to 4.0 p.m. to games and walks outside the school under supervision. ) ■/I '&lt; .. • • mi*—/VS-- 5 % t • Quran and Religion. NuiE. 1. The teaching of the Quran and Religion is of great im~ portance in Primary Schools because Religion is the basis of moral training. Religious and Moral training must go hand-in-hand, and the latter without the former is of little value. Religious Teachers must, therefore, bear in mind that it is not enough to teach boys what the rules and ceremonies of their religion are; they must show them how the spirit of these rules must be carried out in their daily lives, and how their conduct always must be based on them. 2. In teaching the Quran, Masters must remember that learn ing verses by heart without understanding their meaning has little educational merit. They must explain the meaning of the verses to the boys as far as possible and satisfy themselves that they under stand them. SYLLABUS. FIRST YEAR ELEMENTARY (Six Periods a Week).

The objects of teaching the Arabic language in Primary Schools are, firstly, to enable the pupils to speak, read, and write cor rect Arabic, and to distinguish between the various modes of speech, and secondly, to make the reading of Arab literature a source of pleasure to them so that they will take an interest in it when they leave school and devote a great part of their leisure to it. In teaching the language the following points should be ob served :— (1) The Master must do his best to ensure that the pupils neither see, hear, nor speak anything but good and correct Arabic. (2) Suitable passages from the best literature (not those which simply illustrate the use of the rules of grammar) should be selected both in the pieces for dictation and in the examples used to explain lessons of grammar. (3) Any incorrect pronunciation and expression on the part of the pupils must be corrected immediately by the Master, and all mistakes in written exercises should, after correction, be explained to the class. (4) Exercises on the application of the rules of grammar should frequently be given to the pupils, so that the employment of these rules may become a habit with them. (5) The pieces for Recitation should be adapted to the intelli gence of the boys and the words and expressions in these pieces ex plained clearly so that the pupils may be able to employ them in their own speech and writing. (6) In composition the Master should carefully prepare a skeleton in each lesson, the leading points being well chosen and arranged in logical order. The pupils should be taught to use cor rect and easy sentences and avoid all pretence at rhymed prose and the frequent use of synonyms. (7) The teachers of all subjects taught through the medium of Arabic should not leave a mistake in the language uncorrected and they should always employ good and correct Arabic in teaching. SYLLABUS. FIRST YEAR ELEMENTARY. Reading, Conversation, Writing and Spelling (Five Periods a Week). Note : (1) Pupils must use a suitable book.

(1) The object of this course is to effect an improvement in the handwriting of the pupils, especially in riqa a. In the teaching of thuluth and naskh, attention should be paid to the shakl. Mistakes in handwriting should constantly be pointed out and corrected. (2) Teachers of subjects other than writing should likewise exert efforts to improve the ordinary writing of their pupils. Great attention should be paid in each lesson to the position of the writer so as to avoid harm being done to the eye or spine, and also to the way in which he holds the pen. (3) In the Second Year Elementary, one period a week will be devoted to naskh and the other period to riqa’a. In the Eirst and Second Years* Primary, one period, every two weeks, will be devoted to thuluth, and the others will be devoted to naskh and riqa’a. In the Third and Fourth Years, the greatest importance will be attached to riqa’a. SYLLABUS. FIRST YEAR ELEMENTARY (Four Periods a Week).

Before taking a lesson in geography, the Master should con sult the history syllabus and illustrate his lesson as far as possible with the history of the country described. In the Elementary Classes, frequent use should be made of the sand tray and of geographical games. 2. In all classes the wall-map should invariably be used to illustrate the lesson, both by Master and pupils. The drawing of sketch-maps should be taught in the Second Year Elementary and First Year Primary, accurately drawn maps only in the more advanced stages. 3. Teach by making a boy use his eyes and his mind at the same time. Make him look at the map and tell you what he sees and get him to understand the reason for what he sees, e.g., he will see that there is a port at Basrah—why ? Why and because cannot be used too frequently in geography. Use pictures as well as maps as much as you can. Pictures are interesting as well as instructive. 4. Only a few names should be learnt at first, more can be learnt as the boy progresses. SYLLABUS. FIRST YEAR ELEMENTARY (Two Periods a Week).

Teach the collection between history and geography when ever you can. 3. Teach cause and effect—mere learning by heart of names is no good. 4. Use pictures whenever you can—a boy cannot understand the history of a country and he will not be interested, unless he has some idea of what its people, its buildings, etc., looked like. A picture of some great historical event impresses it far more vividly on the boy than a book or talking. 5. Tell any stories about historical people that you can.

This course of study is meant to encourage the faculty of observation, to develop dexterity in the use of the hand, to strengthen the relation between the hand and the mind, and to teach the pupils by this means to express their ideas. 2. The Master should always be careful how he uses the chalk in the course of the lesson. His sketches should be made to help his explanations and should not be left as diagrams to be copied. In the Elementary Classes, no preliminary outline should be allowed, but pupils should start at the centre of the Object and gradually work outwards, expanding the drawing to the desired shape. Some times careful drawings should be made in pencil only. SYLLABUS. FIRST YEAR PRIMARY (One Period a Week). A. (1) Drawing on the ground. The pupils should draw straight and curved lines, circles, simple natural objects such as : Oranges, water-glasses; constructed objects, such as footballs, water- jars, kites.

(1) Objects. Objects which require to have an outline drawn before filling in with colour, e.g., flowers, leaves, bridges, mosques, letter-boxes, ships, etc. (2) Designs. More difficult designs chosen by the Master. (3) Memory Drawing. Simple objects observed previous to the lesson or at its beginning. These drawings will be made in pen cil or in colour. FOURTH YEAR PRIMARY (One Period a Week). (1) Drhwing in Colour. From the objects themselves, or from examples. , (2) Outline drawing in pencil. From the objects themselves- or drawings representing them. (3) Memory Drawing. (4) Designs. Different designs suggested by the Master.s 24 S. Manual Training. NOTE. 1. The object of Manual Training in Primary Schools is to de velop the faculty of observation, to train the hand and eye, to culti vate the brain, and to instil the sense of accuracy and method. Each practical lesson or the introduction of a new exercise should be prefaced by a short demonstration to be given by the Master to the class as a whole. Such demonstration should describe the object to be made, should explain the method to be followed and the result to be attained. The pupils should co-operate with him in the explanation. An actual example or model of the exercise to be done (except in memory lessons) must always be shown to the class. The Master should trv to avoid helping the individual boy, or cor- ecting his work. His function is to supervise the work of the pupils, point out mistakes, to advise how they can be corrected, and to leave the boy to follow his instructions and do the work himself. The element of time should not be overlooked and boys should not be allowed to take too long over any exercise. Masters should always be striving to introduce new exercises. An important aim in Manual Training Classes is to make the work interesting to the boys, nnd the Master should understand that the interest of the pupils is the greatest factor in progress. 2. The Master will use the models and exercises which are suited to the class. 3. All materials should be used with great care and in using them the necessity of economy should not be forgotten. 4. In the higher classes, the pupils will be asked to make models which will necessitate the use of something more than mere manual skill, and which will test the technique, intelligence and pov&amp;r of invention of the boys. 5. In teaching, it is not necessary to give the same exercises as those mentioned below, as they are meant to be examples. SYLLABUS (Two Periods a Week). Clay Modelling. Clay, being easily shaped by the hand, forms an excellent mate rial for manual training. Modelling tools should, therefore, only be used where necessary, the best tool being the “ fingers. To main tain for “ clay-modelling ” a real educational value, each lesson should be arranged to teach observation, comparison, recollection and reproduction. All exercises should be modelled from an actual ex ample or a model ; and in correcting mistakes the copy should be the standard of comparison. I - * M odelling Exercises. Exercises in manipulating clay, practising rolling, pressing, indentation of surface, etc., using hands only. Making models of eggs, balls, oranges, apples, with fairly uniform surfaces.

The use of the chain.p N Object Lessons. NOTES. 1. Object lessons are a valuable means of training the eye and the mind at the same time; therefore make the boys look carefully at the object, tell you what they see, and try to make them tell you the reasons for what they see. Teach the boys to notice things them selves, e.cj., the way a camel’s feet are formed. 2. Make the boys compare objects of the same type and see how they resemble each other and differ, and why; e.q., in animals, x sheep and goat, duck and goose; tea and coffee. 3. Always use the object yourself to illustrate the lesson, e.q., a piece of coal. If the actual object is not available, use a picture of the object. 4. Remember that anything you can do to make the knowledge derived from daily observation indie exact and more useful is worth doing, e.q., a fly, a palm tree. In this way not only is the lesson made more interesting, but future study is made easier. 5. Hygiene is most important, because it deals with matters which affect the every day lives of the boys, and if it is taught w T ell it will have good practical results in increased healthiness and in creased cleanliness among the boys, e.q., if a boy knows why it is necessary for him to wash his body and the bad effects that come from not washing it, he^will be more inclined to do so than if he only regards washing as a nuisance which has no reason for it.

NOTE. I n The objects of translation are two :— {a) To teach boys the construction of English sentences and to show them how English differs from Arabic. Particular attention therefore should be paid to expressions where English differs from Arabic, e.g., the Relative Pronoun—the use of the word “ have.” (6) To improve their knowledge of good idiomatic English as opposed to English which may be grammatically correct but is not used. The boy must be taught to speak and write English as an Englishman speaks and writes it, not as a foreigner. The Course should include :— (a) Both oral and written work: • (b) Translation from English into Arabic and vice versa. (c) Lists of simple idiomatic expressions and phrases in gene ral use to be learnt thoroughly by the boys at home. SYLLABUS. THIRD YEAR (One Period a Week). Oral Work. (a) Translation oi simple sentences selected or adapted from the reading books prescribed, wTiether English or Arabic. (b) Translation of simple sentences alternately from Arabic into English and vice versa, prepared by the Master and so gradu ated as to complement the study of the two languages. Y.#.-—The exercises should consist mainly of translation from English into .1 rabic, not from Arabic into English O Written Work. Exercises of the same nature as in the oral work. V The written exercises should begin a few weeks after the opening of the school year. kOLRTH YEAR (Two Periods a Week). Oral Work. (a) Translation of sentences from English into Arabic and from Arabic into English trom the reading books prescribed, whether Arabic or English. {b) Translation of sentences alternately from Arabic into Eng lish and vice versa, prepared by the Master x and so graduated as to complement the study of the two languages. . ..

Written Work. \ Exercises of the same nature as in the oral work. Exercises in the translation of such sentences as bear upon the work of Govern ment offices—translation of brief official letters. J * ♦ * » *31 \ English Language. NOTE. 1. Instruction must be entirely oral at first—for at least two months. 2. leach by objects which the boy can see in the class-room or outside, or by pictures or rough drawings on the board. 3. Teach also by action when you can, i.e., do a thing and get the boys to tell you what you have done or make a boy do something. e.g., stand on the desk, and another boy tell you what he is doino- or lias done. 4. Teach by questions and answers, but always insist on a com plete sentence being made. One word answers are no good, e.g. r Q. What is this ”? A. 'Knife ” : this is no use. Also do not let questions be answered merely by repeating your words, e.g., “ Is the book on the table ” ? Bad answer : ' No, the book is not on the table.” Good answer : £ ‘ No, it is on the chair.” Also try to ask questions which cannot be answered in the same words, e.g., Q. “What is ypur brother ” ? A. “ He is a Clerk in the Police Office.” 5. Talk English yourself as much as possible, but use Arabic to explain any word or sentence which you are not sure that the boys understand. Remember that one word in Arabic will often explain a thing better than ten minutes talking in English. 6. Insist on correct pronunciation and correct grammar. Make a boy go on repeating a word or a sentence until he savs it correctly. Get the boys to talk correctly from habit. /. In reading do not let the boys sing or speak quicklv: Make them get the emphasis on the right part of the sentence. 8. Grammar should not be taught separately, but during the lesson as necessity arises. Only the simplest rules should be taught —there is no need to learn long rules by heart. Grammatical terms should only be used as a convenient means ol teaching how to write and speak the language correctly, and should be explained by the Arabic counterparts as far as it is prac ticable. 9. Recitation is useless if it becomes a machine-like repetition of words meaningless to the pupil. There must be plentymf life and full expression given to the meaning by inflection of the voice. The dramatic sense should be encouraged. 10. Dictation exercises should be carefully corrected and the mistakes written correctly by the pupil. 11. Original effort should be encouraged as much as possible especially in composition. The subject should be one of interest to the boys and within the scope of their daily experience. ' SYLLABUS.

Instruction in penmanship is to be kept in view by all Teachers of English. Every Master must insist on all the written work being done with neatness and in a firm, round, legible hand. The general character of the writing in all the exercise-books will be considered in deciding upon the proficiency of the pupils in this sub ject. 2. The position of the pupil as well as that of his pen and copy book should be the object of the Master’s constant attention. 3. The blackboard is to be used for making corrections as well as for model writing. SYLLABUS (Two Periods in First Primary Year : One Period in other Primary Years). The progressive exercises in penmanship (large-hand half-test, small hand, capitals and figures) are to be based on the method of the copy-books authorised for use. The graduation of these exer cises is indicated by the arrangement of the subject-matter of the copy-books recommended for each class. APhysical Training. NOTE. The Instructor should explain to the pupils the object of physical training and its physical effects on the conditions' of the body generally in correcting and developing it; also its educational value. He should explain also the effects of and the muscles exer cised in the different groups of exercise. The Instructor should do his best to make physical training in teresting to the pupils in order that the lessons may be more fruitful and effective. S1LLABUS (Three Periods a Week).
