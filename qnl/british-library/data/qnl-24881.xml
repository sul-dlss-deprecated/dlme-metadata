We note that Sir Geoffrey Prior does not think that the doubt about the future production of aviation spirit by B.A.P.C.O. will influence them to refrain from pressing their claim in respect of their rlgnts under their Agreement to construct shore tankage. In these circumstances, we do not wish to press our suggestion that the negotiations for the extension of Ihe Civil Air Agreement should be deferred. We agree that there were other considerations which influenced the decision to negotiate now for an extension of the Civil Air Agreement, but the position vis-a-vis B.A.P.C.O. 50 i was the outstanding one and the M.C.A., for their part, would not otherwise have wished to open the question of extending the agreement until nearer the date of the expiration of the current period of tenure. As I have said, however, we defer to the view of the Political Resident in this matter and are prepared to see the negotiations go forward as originally planned.

I attended a meeting of the British Aviation Petroleum Production Assignments Committee yesterday when it was stated in the course of discussion about fuel supplies generally, that the B.A.P.C.O. would probably not go into production after all, but that a final decision had not yet been reached. 3* This, of course, has a distinct bearing on the question whether it is necessary for us to extend our agreement with the Sheikh of Bahrein for a further seven years beyond December, 1948, primarily for the purpose of protecting our position vis a vis the Bahrein Petroleum Company, in the matter of construction of shore tankage* * If the B.A.P.C.O. do not after all go into production is it not unlikely that they will insist upon their alleged monopoly rights for the construction of shore tankage,and if they do not insist on these rights, is there any point in our proceeding with the proposal to extend our agreement at this juncture^ It seems to us that we may find ourselves in the position of protecting a position which does not arise* I do not suggest that we should stop the negotiations with the Sheikh if they have already started but that,if there is evidence on the spot^of which Sir Geoffrey Prior will be aware) F.A.K.

Less than 2 out of the 110 hours spent in the air involved flight in cloud or visibility less than three miles. Even this short period was almost entirely composed of brief ascents or descents through cloud layers. The fimtl landing at Hum on the return flight was * the only occasion on which' a ’’procedure' descent through cloud had to be made. ivorage yisibiUtv range fyom typical cruising altitude f °.% 10 -&gt; 0 Q 0 rk, appeared to be somewhere between 5 and' 50 miles. On remarkably few occasions did it drop below the five mile limit. ... The severity of tropical thunderstorms notably at night, and the imperative necessity for giving them a wide berth v/as most striking. The local meteorological services appear to he able to forecast the formation and movement of these storms with considerable accuracy, although the provision of additional upcountry reporting stations would clearly improve the reliability of the weather services in such places as Central Africa. (e) The effect of tropical noon-day sun on the temperature of the outside and inside of a metal aircraft, insofar as this complicates servicing and inconveniences passengers and crew is remarkable. * (*) (c&gt; (d) (g) The great height (20,000 ft, or more above ground level) frequently attained by cumulous clouds and associated air turbulence indicates the advantages to be gained both in terms, of passenger comfort and of operational economy, by using- aircraft with pressure cabins that can overfly storms. The air.is comparatively oalm, clear and cool in the early morning. TV _^ ccor dingly extremely important so to regulate schedules f 1 :L S hts ^^ carried out between say 0500 and 1300 hours, both in the interests of operational safety and passenger comfort Between midday and well after sunset in tropical climates, the air is extremely turbulent, from ground level upwards. &gt;/~S - 3 - 8 * The fact that the only mechanical fault that in any way interfered with the operation of any of the aircraft in which air passages were made, was an electrical short-circuit on a very old radio set in an R.i'i.F. /»nson, is a striking testimony to U.S.i. manufacturing and British and South African maintenance skill, aaoiag that most of the 15,000 miles covered '''were flown in Douglas Dakotas operated by B.O.A.C. &amp; S.A.A.F. Also of interest was the fact that on no occasion was it necessary to delay or to alter a scheduled time of takeoff (even,because an extremely hot engine failed to start when required) or to turn back or divert once the aircraft was airborne, either for mechanical or other reasons. This also is regarded as a remarkable achievement on behalf of the various operators concerned. 9» With three minor exceptions (concerning which the H.Q* Operations staff are aware) the B.O.A.C.’s standard of operation was extremely high. ihe operating technique of the only South African Airways pilot in v/hose hands a flight was made, did not impress. The standard of the military pilotage experienced both in R.A.F. and S.A.A.F. aircraft was on the whole high, except in the case of one S.A.A.F. captain who must have been very new to the Job of flying Dakotas, judging by his poor attempts to land his aircraft smoothly. It was at the hands of this same pilot that the one really frightening episode was experienced, namely a ten minutes flight on a bumpy day at a height of 10-20 ft. over a game reserve near Tabora, in the course of which turns were made with one wing tip virtually scraping the backs of various wild beasts. With a fully loaded dakota on such a rough day, this would have been an extremely hazardous manoeuvre even if it had been executed by a most experienced pilot. The margin of safety against the possibility of some untoward happening or the slightest error of judgement was nil. No official complaint was lodged, as it was a military aircraft, on which civilian passengers were travelling by courtesy of the South African Air Force, 1 C. Unfortunately time did not permit a detailed study of the adequacy of the existing meteorological and signals organisation on the Cape to Cairo route, from the operators and pilot’s point of view. A general impression was gained, however, that the organisation was susceptible of some improvement.before civil operations conducted on an economical peace-time footing are resumed. It needed no investigation to see how necessary is an improvement in the air traffic control organisation which naturally includes an aircraft safety service. The control of traffic between Cairo and Khartoum is administered by R.A.F. Middle East Command. The system employed is considered to warrant improvement or better still requires to be 'civilianised” as soon as possible. In East Africa, the R.A.F. has just instituted flying control at Eastleigh airfield, Nairobi. The set-up shows promise but is liable to be closed down suddenly if the R.A.F. personnel administering it are withdrawn. There is apparently little or nor traffic control over flights crossing Rhodesian territory. Nor was it decided at the Capetown conference to do anything about this lack of facilities, save to consider the position at a later date when the Southern Africa Standing Technical Committee is set up and starts functioning. The South Africans are known to be considering a two-area niliterv control system for the Union, with area stations at Capetown and Pretoria This scheme which is only in an embryo stage needs closely to be integrated with requirements of civil aviation. g d In short, air traffic control arrangements throughout the route intention TQV±6 ^ ur Z entl y&gt; their improvements being the underlying G.108092 ••./Note:G. 108092 .../(e) Note: The Coimnonwealth Air Transport Council meeting held in London in July 1945 considered the position, and set up a new 'Committee on Air Navigation'and Ground Organisation” (C.^«N.G.O) to review just such issues as this, '■ ^ 11. The following is a summary of the principal lessons to he learned from the Mission’s tour. (a) How invaluable is the assistance of a qualified civil engineer on an Aerodrome Mission such as this. Proposed action - That an M.C.A. engineer be made available to take part in all future Aerodrome Missions. (b) How important it is to have a special aircraft available for transporting the members of an Aerodrome Mission from one place to the next. By relying solely on the availability of scheduled air services, jobs sometimes have to be rushed or even left unfinished; alternatively, one place of interest has to be omitted from the itinerary altogether, because no irregular air service happens to call there. Proposed Action - That one of the Ministry's civil operations fleet aircraft should be made available for use by any future Aerodrome Mission. (c) What a mistake it is for operational representatives of the Ministry, as well as representatives of the Government's chosen air operating instrument, to inspect an air route in the wake of a Ministerial party. The problems to be solved at specific places are likely under such an arrangement to be discovered only after the Minister's party has left, whereas they should, of course, be presented to him on arrival, for solution. Proposed Action - Operational staff should in the case of all future Ministerial tours precede the official party along the route it is to follow and on arrival at its destination. (d) How essential it is that operations staff both from the Ministry and from all interested air operating concerns, should be in attendance throughout any civil aviation conference. Had steps to this end been taken in the case of the Cape Town conference, consideration would have been given to the very important subject of air traffic control coupled with an appropriate distress and rescue organisation, both of which are essential for the new B.O.A.C. 'York” service on all sections of the route between U.K. and the Union of South Africa. As it happened, neither of these subjects was discussed - indeed they were very nearly forgotten altogether - with the result that a golden opportunity of setting up a suitable organisation for that section of the route lying between Nairobi and Cape Town was missed and consequently much time lost. Proposed Action - At all future civil aviation conferences an Air Navigation and Ground Organisation Committee should be set up to study the routes under discussion and ensure that they are organised and equipped in a manner satisfactory to the pilots who are to fly them. A precedent for such action was set at the recent Commonwealth Air Transport Council Meeting in London, when a Commonwealth Committee, known by the initials C.A.N.G.O., was set up.(e) How much overseas representatives of the Ministry of Civil .Aviation, Local .Aviation Administrators, Airport Managers and Airport Engineers benefit from the opportunity of being able to discuss technical advances and trends with informed officers newly arrived in their country from London, and conversely how much these visiting officers stand to learn and how much better they can thereafter further the cause of British civil aviation. There is no doubt that U.K. technical missions to foreign countries pay good dividends in terns of prestige and, it is to be hoped, of overseas trade. • Proposed Action - Further missions should be despatched from U.K. at regular intervals, if British spheres of influence and commercial markest are to survive in the face of official and commercial competition from foreign quarters.

CAIRO 1. ^ All comr.iercial air traffic except that carried by U.5. Air Transport C Cor^and is at present handled at the Egyptian International Civil Airport at Alii aza . On one side of it, and only about 2 miles array, lies He liopolis R.A.F. airfield. On the opposite side, about 3 wiles distant, lies Payne Field (Matariya), an U.S. A.T.C. airfield. R.A.F. Transport Comand has’up to now used the new Cairo V/es t airfield which is situated nearly pO miles away on the other side of Cairo. 2. iJI'AIA. - A camp for a R.A.P. transport squadron is being erected at , Almaza. 3.O.A.C. has a. fairly'- large aircraft maintenance organisation there. The airport serves as Misr Airline's operating and i.iaintenance base. The South African Air Perce bases a large nu ber of Dakotas at Almaza for use on their shuttle service between Italy and the Union. In addition, there are the various activities of the Royal Egyptian Air force, which range from instructional flying on Moths to operational training on modern fighters. Finally the instructional aircraft belonging to the Misr. Club and School of Flying are almost continually doing ab initio training of civil pupils both by day and by night. The imminence of dangerous congestion at Almaza is obvious; furthermore, some of the activities are clearly most inappropriate to an airport intended for international passenger, mail and freight traffic. The large number of different lodgers, each with their own buildings, has resulted in encroachment on the landing area and in obstruction of flying approaches. Added to all this is the fact that the site is not a really first class one, because it is so hemmed in by built up areas on two sides and by sand hills on the other two. There are, however, two facts that tend to ameliorate the situation, namely. - (i) assuming that the necessary land can b’o obtained, sand hills can always be removed at a price, and (ii) the two runways that are between them estimated by A.M. Meteorological Office to be isable on 0: ^ all occasions (assuming that aircraft can safely land in cross winds of up to 15 m.p.h.) are the very two that are fairly readily extendable. Nevertheless, Almaza as it u-.w. stands will have to be developed tremendously if it is to be made into a first rate international airport, capable of continuing to serve as such for a reasonable length of time. It appears that it will never bo possible to construct dual parallel runways with sufficient lateral separation for safety, except at fabulous expense, which is unfortunate, as it means that if and when the optimum handling capacity is reached, another airport will be needed to accommodate the overflow traffic. 3* HELIOPOLIS. - Like Almaza, is hemmed in by tall buildings and hills. The possibility of extending it is no better than, if as good as, the present civil airport. Its surface has a marked overall gradient from South to North. The principal point in its favour is its close proximity to, and ready access from the centre of Cairo. But taken all round, it does not possess any appreciable advantage over Almaza in terms of development potentiality. PAINE FIELD ~ Is a fine open site, but is not as accessible from Cairo as is Almaza. Its principal shortcoming - and an insuperable one at that - is the sloping nature of the landing area. For instance the main runway slopes downward from South East to North West at an average overall gradient of 1 in 56 . The over-all gradient on the North East - South West subsidiary- runway is as steep as 1 in 53* Such severe gradients are not considered acceptable for future civil air transport operations. On the other hand, availability of the runways as they stand for emergency landings must not be disregarded. 5. CAIRO UEST - Is a better site than those mentioned above but is far too remote from Cairo to warrant serious consideration as a base for Cairo bound traffic, except as a bad weather alternate or as an emergency landing ground for use if and when the Almaza runways are declared temporarily or permanently unserviceable on account of the presence of crashed aircraft or, alternatively, of surface repairs in progress. A. 3,103092; • • •- 2 - 6 . except i or the small site at Dokki, to r/hich the Hisr Piping Club anu chool ax’e s nor tip to move from Almasa, no mention has been heard of any other area close to Cairo that is suitable for the construction of a modern airport. Yet in a flat country like this, it is thought quite possible that there are otner sites nearer to the centre of the city than Cairo best, that have not previously been considered for such purpose. It would, therefore, bo as ./ell ii the whole district were thoroughly combed to ascertain the true ^ position. jh .brief rexerenee is approprir.te at this juncture to the Egyptian Government’s land/marine airport site at LAI dd i'iAfijTU T , near Alexandria. The sa.ee 0 ^ this project lias marked attractions from an operational point of view, although tne money so far invested in it is not considered likely to produce muen return, as the surface of the land airport is not yet strong enough for safe use by lar^o modern transport aircraft; nor is the flying boat lagooon (as yet unflood) expected to prove sufficiently .large for the operation of coranerciaj. flying boats of the future (see also Part B, of this Appendix). Reverting to Alj.iasa, the short teim development '//ork that should be under- oaken io improve the airport is listed hereafter, an indication being given as oO che irjportance of each item. In so doing, it is assumed (a) that Egypt wishes to have a Class II airport capable of taking the fastest and heaviest land planes now being constructed or designed in any country, save only machines weighiftg over 150,000 I’ps, gross and those intended for ultra- long-naul services and (b) that the Southern Africa ’’desirable” airport standards agreed at Cape Town in March 1%5 arc applicable. To allow for local air density, occasioned principally by high temperatures, it is suggested that a correction factor of 1.15 ought to be applied to all basic longitudinal dimensions, (i) Primary runway - Make the HE - S7 runway instead of the N-S runway the niain one, for use'when there is no appreciable wind or when the visibility is sufficiently bad to necessitate an instrument landing. (The principal advan* iage. to be gained b so doing is the elimination of overall gradient; the existing main runway slopes at 1 in 100 approximately from North to SoVtth.) Extend the existing paving to the HE to give a total runway length of 7,150 ft. after making a cutting 1,200 ft. wide through the sand hills and levelling the desert beyond. Ensure at the same time that there is a 1,500 ft. long overrun at each end of the paving, together with appropriate flightway zoning : - 1,500 ft, level, with 1 in 50 floor beyond. E^ority - urgent, in so far as provision of the cutting through the sand hills is concerned and semi-urgent thereafter. (ii) Secondary runwa y - Extend the North-South paved runway to the North to a maximum length of 5&gt;750 ft., (i.e. make it a subsidiary runway), ensuring That there is a 1,200 ft. overrun at each end, together with appropriate flightway zoning:- 1,500 ft. level with 1 in 40 floor beyond. •P riority - non-urgent, except for clea.rs.nce of telegraph lines and buildings in the Southern flightway, to give a clear floor of 1 in 50 measured _rom the end of the existing paving. Note: This clearance work is understood to be in progress. (iii) Qy her fligntway clearance - Clear the South-East flightway to give a iloor as near I in 50 as possible, measured from the end of the paved runway, by removing the existing quarantine buildings and also the high sand hills behind them. Priorit y - semi-urgent, (iv) Runway surface - Take whatever steps are necessary to prevent the sand - mix surface of the N-S and the H3-SN runways from deteriorating. Priority - urgent. Note: 'Armouring” of the runways is already in progress. ( (iii) (iv) v ) Rpra^-y s trength - Have scientific tests carried out to determine the aring capacity of the sub-soil and of the surface of the existing runways, in- 3 - / , order to determine how best to ensure that they stand up to loads of* the order of 67 ,000 lbs, per wheel group at tyre pressures of up to 80 lbs. per square inch. Priority - urgent, as it is essential to know ~ the result of these tests before runway extensions are commenced. z-s (vi) Runway width - '7iden the main and the N-S subsidiary runway to 300 and 250 ft. respectively. Priority - non-urgent (vii) Ligh ting - Install R.A.P. (modified) contact lighting along the edges of the existing North-South and IIS-S’.V runwa^rs and. at a. later stage a.long the other two runways. Priority - urgent. Note: The necessary light fittings are already on their way to Egypt. (viii) A ctivity (a) Misr Flying Club and School acitivities to be transferred to Dokki. (b) Everything possible to be done to assist the Royal Egyptian Air Force to obtain the use of He Iowan or some other R.A.F. airfield. Priority - Both (a) and (b) are urgent, as B.O.A.C. forks and R.A.F. Transport Command Dakotas will very shortly be using the airport in increasing numbers - and they do not mix well in the air or on the ground with ,, Moths ,, . (i-) Buildings - Siting of the nc r w terminal building to be reviewed in relation to possible changes in the runway layout and to possible imp^rovements in the road connections to Cairo, always remembering that the best site for them is as near as possible to the centre point of the primary runwa~. Priority - only urgent in so far as the date of completion of building plans is approaching and modifications to them might possibly have to be made to suit them to any altero-tion to the layout decided upon. ( : 0 T raffi c control - Responsibility for control of Almaza traffic is understood to be vested in tne Egyptian Government, d/hen tho Transport Command Squadron moves in, the R.A.F. Flying Control staff posted to Almaza will If safety of flying operations in the Cairo vicinity is to be assured, it must'be understood that it is not just effective control' of Almaza traffic that is needed but rather co-ordination of the flow of traffic to and from Almaza with the flow in and out of both Heliopolis and Payne Field. For the time being it is considered that this responsibility cannot be shouldered by any authority except by the R.A.F., although, in due course, it may have to be handed over to tue .Egyptians, but preferably not until we have succeeded in persuadiny them to employ a British Chief Control Officer, just as they have a British Aerodrome Adviser (Mr. Savage), 9. Conclusi on_ A3jnaza is not a first class site for an international airport. Further more, it has been somewhat spoilt by mushroom building growth round the perimeter, some ox which it has, unfortunately, been beyond the power of the Egyptian Director of Civil Aviation to prevent.

Q.108092.61 CIVIL AIRPORTS IN EAIffSTINE (LYDD/Q APEEKDIX B, 1 , Lydda is a fine airport on a good site, with some room for expansion notably towards the v/est and N* W« 2* The radius of curvature on some of the taxiways is rather too sharp, with the consequence that large aircraft find it difficult readily to negotiate bends. This, coupled with the fact that the soil at the e 3 ges of the paved areas (including certain portions of the runways) is such that if a modern four-engined aircraft leaves them it gets bogged, is a weak feature* 3 , Plans for extending the apron in front of the terminal building and for constructing a new parking area on the East side of the main building site were inspected. Although these improvements are to be made to'meet military requirements, they will undoubtedly enhance the value and the facilities of the airport when it finally reverts to civil use. Conclusion A, The layout of the runways and the buildings reveals commendable foresight. Recent expenditure on the paved surfaces to meet wartine military requirements, has undoubtedly resulted in improving the airport and prolonging its life for civil flying operations. 5* It is recommended that full consideration be given, in consultation with D.C.A. Palestine, to the suggestion advanced by the B.O.A.C. representative on the U.K. aerodrome mission, that 25 yds. wide consolidated shoulders should be constructed along each edge of all runways, as an insurance against the loss or damage of a valuable transport aircraft consequent upon its swinging off the runway and sinking into the soft black cotton soil along the edge of the 50 yds. wide runway. In this connection the fact that the original sand—mix runways underlie certain sections of the newly constructed concrete runv/ays, should be taken into account. 0 . 10809 ^~ n en.iro.,.;- nev; site closer or, at least as close, to the centre ox oairo as Almaa can be found for development in the distant future typ&amp;W W Ut ptM4x*H4i to. fa* lUtuwMiwfa IJUIUIU 'cUi' upwationa \7ixl oo prepared to risk damage to their air liners, as the result of their leaving runways and getting bogged, it vdll clearlv be necessary either for the runways themselves to be v/idened to, say, 300 ft or * alternatively, for consolidated shoulders, say, 150 ft. mde to be constructed on each side 01 the paved runways as they stand. 2 .

There is a short secondary runway of similar construction to the main runway and approximately at right angles to it; it is very seldom used however* 2* Besides the terminal building there is one hangar about the size of a Bellman* The apron in front of this building gets so soft and sticky in the heat of the day that only the lightest types of transport aircraft are likely to be able to use it without making serious ruts. 5. In the light of the foregoing it appears that the question of Baghdad's airport development will have to be tackled in two stages. 4* In the first place the engineering problem of improving the bearing capacity of the existing runways and apron must be fully investigated and then solved at the earliest possible moment. To this &gt; end, arrangements have been made for the Chief Engineer, Iraq and Persia Command, H.A.F. to visit the airport, inspect the paved areas and arrange for appropriate tests to be carried out on the surfacing material and the sub-soil. This action which was initiated as long ago as 20th March 1945 has since been followed up by a signal from Home. The steps taken have the full concurrence of Akram Mustaq, the Director of Civil Aviation, Iraq. 5. Secondly there is the question of how the future development of Baghdad West site is to be planned. Various possibilities were disoussed on the spot with the Iraq State Railway Engineers and Architects, as well as with the D.C.A. The advice verbally tendered was to the effect that a new main runway should be laid parallel to the existing one and on the side of it remote from the city. A new secondary runway v/as also advocated although its orientation was left undecided pending the analysis by D.M.O. London of the local surface wind records. 6 . To implement some such plan, does not appear likely to present a difficult problem or to prove a very expensive matter. There should be no difficulty in assuring that the flight-ways are unobstructed and so far as preparation of the surface is concerned, it will not bo necessary to do much levelling or grading, except in connection with the filling in of a disused canal and generally with the drainage of the areas. An engineer’s report on this latter question is desirable, as there is reason to suppose that the land is subject to flooding. Conclusion and Recommendation . 7* Provided that the engineering report when received states that the sub-soil is capable of taking the loads that will be imposed on runways constructed for use by the heaviest aircraft of the future, it is considered that a Class I International Airport can readily be developed in the immediate vicinity of the existing airport. It is however understood that Mr. G-umbley (D.C.A. Palestine) has advocated development of an entirely different site on the far side of the city, near Hinaidi Military airfield. This scheme is not however regarded with favour by the Iraq State Railway Authorities, who were in fact careful not to mention it to the U.K. Mission. Although this alternative site was not inspected, it is considered that it would prove extremely difficult to make a prima facie case for developing it, rather than Baghdad West, seeing that the latter is so close to the town centre and so conveniently situated with respect to the site proposed for the new main railway G .108092 terminus. /a8 , Sufficient information was left with the Iraq State Railways Engineering staff to enable them to produce a tentative layout which could subsequently be referred by the D.C.i'j. to London for comment. 9# Just such a development scheme has since been received, studied and criticised in certain respects, from an operational point of view It is still highly desirable that a Civil Engineer should visit the site and advise on constructional aspects of the project. B. Basra . ”1. The Port of Basra’s airport at Margil was, when visited, in process of having its N.W. - S.E. runway extended to the utmost in the former direction. By now this main runway should be fully 2,000 yards long by 50 yards wide. The construction is such that it should prove strong enough regularly to stand the weight of the heaviest aircraft now flying. 2. The construction of two other new runways, approximately 3*000 yards long is contemplated. The erection of a new terminal building on a site suitably located with respect to the new, - as opposed to the existing - runways, is also contemplated. As however the N.V/. - S.E. runway has been shown by statistics compiled locally to be in use on 71 % of all occasions and as its optimum length has already been reached, the wisdom of proceeding with this plan was queried. 3* Thereafter an offer was made - and gladly accepted by Mr. Coleman, the Port Managering Director, and All Fuad, the airport Manager - that after the surface wind analysis had been undertaken, a possible alternative layout would be suggested. Work on the wind analysis has now been completed in London, on the basis of meteorological data received by pose from Basra. Having given the abovementioned undertaking, an inspection was made of the almost level desert land to the South-West of the existing landing area. A plan showing the existing roads and railway lines in this vicinity was requested and has since been supplied. The only obstructions of any consequence in the vicinity are cranes in the dock area and the wireless masts belonging to the civil and the Admiralty radio stations, situated to the South-West of the existing airport. 4. .Advice was tendered on the spot concerning:- (a) taxy-v/ay arrangements to serve the far end of the fully extended main runway; (b) night lighting for the new extension, and (c) appropriate siting for a new Tv'/T Homing Beacon. 5* Arrangements were also made for Wing Commander Laws, Civil Signals Representative in the Middle East, to visit the airport and advise the proprietors generally on communication matters. 6 , The fact that current British policy entails by-passing Basra altogether, in so far as long and medium stage Empire Trunk Services are concerned, was mentioned in conversation. The Port officers regard this as a political decision that is not irrevocable as far as Iraq officialdom is concerned. They claim with some force that - G .1080923S - 3 - •(i) Basra, Being situated near Abadan and other important oil centres, is likely to generate more traffic than Baghdad, although the latter is admitted to be the ^ political, as opposed to the commercial, capital of the country; (ii) with all their engineering experience and backing, the Port Authority is certain to be able to produce a better airport than Baghdad and to run it more efficiently. Judging by appearances, this is more than likely to prove to be the case, unless the Capital City takes a far more serious interest in the design and the administration of its airport, than it has done in the past. Summary and Recommendation . 7* Although the existing airport is small by modern standards, there is plenty of space to the South-West either for its extension or alternatively for its entire reconstruction* The Port Authority is extremely keen and knowledgeable in so far as aeronautical and engineering aspects of airport design are concerned* Nevertheless they welcome the technical advice that has been promised and will shortly be given to them. 8 * It is recommended that the possibility of substituting Basra for ‘ j Baghdad as a staging point for U.K. Trunk Services to India, Australia, and the Par East be kept constantly under review.

The principal shortcomings of the existing aeordrome on MUHURRAQ ISL/'iND are as follows: - operations, although they can be extended by removing certain palm-groves and sand hills, together with a few European residences; but the south-west flightway is always bound to be obstructed to some extent by native houses in the nearby native town. (iv) The terminal building is a makeshift affair and will certainly have to be replaced before long, if BAHREIN is to remain a staging post on the medium stage route from the U. K. to India, .Australasia and the Par East. 2 . Tne location of the existing aerodrome near the causeway that connects Muhurraq Island with BAHREIN ISLAND (two miles distant) and also comparatively close to the flying boat base (three miles away), is regarded as a point in favour of its retention and development. 3* The only satisfactory alternative appears to be the construction of an entirely new aerodrome, possibly a joint civil - R.A.F. user project, on MANAMA ISLAND. An excellent site known as HAMALA (alias ALl) has been discovered by the local A.M.D.N. representative, in the course of his searches for a 'very heavy bomber' airfield site for the R.A.F. It is situated 8 -miles south-west of MANAMA town and the adjacent flying boat base and was inspected in detail on 17/3/45. It was found not to suffer from shortcomings (i), (ii) or (iii) above* On the contrary, adequate space is available for the provision of unobstructed runways of ample length to cater for all civil aviation eventualities. The main runway can conveniently be constructed nearly parallel with the direction of the prevailing wind. Care must be taken however to avoid so orientating it., that it points straight at the only ground for miles around, namely the (knot* of hills in the centre of Manama Island, some 10 miles to the S.E. of the site. The sub-soil is sound rock to be found a few feet down and the sea-water table is 1 8 -feet below the surface. The purchase of the necessary land might prove expensive unless the British Political Agent is given a period of at least six months in which to conduct negotiations. 4. The principle objections to the site are:- 5» No firm estimate of the probable cost of constructing a new civil aern (i) The main runway is not orientated into the prevailing wind which is very constant and blows from betv/een north and north-west„ (ii) The sub-soil has a poor bearing capacity, notably after . wet v/eather, apparently because of the very high Sea water table ( 2-4 feet below the surface). (iii) The existing runv/ays are not long enough for future civil (a) its comparative remoteness from MANAMA (which is the largest *T' TTrKV /-\ in 4- L* 'T' &lt;-&gt;• T i ^ ^ n .rv • i 'l.i — — ... town on the Island) and from inhabited localities generally, and (b) the lack of good road access. possibility that the local Government might choose to invest sav half 6 a million pounds in a new airport rather than in India Government6 * The American intention to construct a large airfield at DHAHRAN near BAHREIN ISLAND but on the Saudi-Arabian mainland, seems to have been 'blocked' politically* Two comparatively short sand-mixed runways are said to constitute the present airfield, but time did not permit inspection of the site. 7* Assuming that BAHREIN is to remain 'on the map', so far as British ^ trunk and other international air routes are concerned, the balance of the arguments is definitely in favour of the construction of a new at HAMALA, together with the provision of a nev/ road linking it to the town of MANAMA. To spend a lot more money on the MUHJJRRAQ site, with its physical limitations and its admittedly unsatisfactory sub-soil would probably prove tantamount to ' 1 pouring money down the drain 1 1 If aircraft gross weights and tyro pressures increase to the extent forecast, it is extremely doubtful whether runways laid at MUHURRAQ, however well they are constructed, would stand-up satisfactorily to the loads involved* Use of the natural surface of the site by currant American civil aircraft types has already proved to be impracticable and the expedient of laying temporary runways of pierced steel plank construction has been indulged in although such runways are not expected to have a life of more than about two years* 8 . Yet another consideration is whether a solution can be found to the problem of keeping the existing landing area serviceable, whilst new paved runways are being constructed* This extremely difficult problem might well prove incapable of solution if traffic using the aerodrome was heavy, in which case the construction of a new airfield would constitute the only possible alternative. 9* Summary and Recommendations The following action is advocated in the circumstances:- (a) Preparation of a full engineering report on the suitability of the HAMALA site, and also the possibility of constructing on the MUHURRAQ sub-soil runways that would stand up to the loads imposed by 150,000 lbs. aircraft, with tyre pressures of up to 80 lbs. a square inch, 0 &gt;) Further consideration of the possibility and the desirability of by-passing BAHREIN altogether - its local needs could probably be served by a feeder line from Baghdad and/or Karachi - and of adopting some other staging post in its stead. For instance it might be found that a large airport could be constructed more readily and perhaps more cheaply elsewhere, to serve as a staging post for medium stage services on the Baghdad - Karachi section of the trunk route from U. K. to India, Australasia and the Far East. (c) On receipt of the engineering report (a) (above), and if no suitable alternative locality for a staging post can be found ((b) above), the Air Ministry and the BAHREIN Government (through the India Office) should be consulted to ascertain the extent to which they would be willing to contribute financially to the cost of developing an airport on BAHREIN Island to meet all foreseeable civil and military require ments. 10 * Action as recommended should proceed as rapidly as possible, as the temporary runways now provided at MUHURRAQ will probably not be suitable for use by civil aircraft for more than about two years from now. The corositroc effect of sea air on the steel planting, combined with the strain imposed on the surface by R.A.F. aircraft proceeding to or from the Far East are expected to result in their rapid deterioration. G.108092APPENDIX E CIVIL AIRPORTS IN SUDAN (KHARTOUI.'l ) 1* The existing aerodrome at Khartoum which is used by B.O.A.C. but run by the R.A.F., has three sand-mix runways, one of which is short (800 yards) and points straight at the hangars. The other two runways have perfectly clear approaches and are 2,000 and 1,700 yards long respectively. Slight extensions to the good runways would be a comparatively simple matter. Turning loops of very small radius are provided at their southern extremities and will need to be modified for the successful operations of 'York ’ 1 aircraft. After a period of rain,-the ground alongside the runways (which are 50 yards 7 /ide) is too soft to support the weight of a transport type aircraft. 2. The Sudan Government is most anxious to'get rid of this aerodrome, as it lies only miles from the centre of Khartoum town and interferes seriously with local development proposals. 3. Two Service airfields exist at Wadi Seidna, 15 miles North-North West of Khartoum and on the opposite side of the Pdver Nile. The North airfield has no runways, few facilities and is no longer in use. The South airfield was loaned to the U.S.A.T.C. and was in constant use by that Service up till the late Spring of this year. It has two good runways, 2,500 $rtid 2,000 yards long respectively, built on a sound gravel subsoil. On account of the presence of deep wadis, extension of these run-ways is difficult. On the other hand, on each side of the paving, 75 yards wide shoulders have been prepared and are suitable for use by heavy aircraft in all weather conditions. The approaches are good, Judged by European standards, but not as perfect as those of sites nearer Khartoum. Road access is very poor, the route lying through the old town of On&amp;urnan and thence atfoss a Series of v/adis which flood after rain and are not bridged. There is no railway track nearer than Khartoum. From a civil aviation point of view, the only attraction of the South airfield is that it has two sound runways on good subsoil. The Sudan Government is unwilling to consider its adoption as a Civil Airport because it is situated adjacent to the brand new state school, the buildings of which were used in emergency as accommodation for American Air Force personnel. 4* The R.A.F. has a natural-surface square-shape landing ground at Gordon’s Tree, about seven miles S.S. 7. of the centre of Khartoum Town. It is approached by a first-class road and the journey takes only 15 minutes by car. There are railway yards barely two miles away and the B.O.A.C. flying boat jetty on the White Nile is only one mile distant. 5* It is on this site that the Sudan Government contemplates the construction of a new civil airport,, Subject to the result of tests of soil samples to determine whether runways to take loads imposed by aircraft weighing up to 150,000 lbs. gross can satisfactorily be constructed, there is no doubt that the site is eminently suitable for the purpose in view. The Local Government is aware that it has been suggested that this airfield be made a joint-user one, although the scheme they have evolved does not indicate any sites as earmarked for R.A.F. buildings. This is because the Service authorities in the Middle East have not until recently taken any interest in the project. However, arrangements were made for representatives of Headquarters, Middle East Command, Cairo to visit Khartoum and discuss the position generally before the middle of May. If all went well, the Sudan Government should by now be in a position to submit a development plan and estimate for a joint-use airfield. G. 108092- 2 ~ 6 * So far as the Civil Aviation aspect of the airport design is concerned, the following action was taken before leaving Khartoum:- (i) A copy of the Capetown Class I and Class II Southern Africa airport standards was given to Mr. Roger Phillips (Deputy^Assistant Civil Secretary (Air), Sudan Government) with a recomendation that whereas the site should be planned initially to Class II standards, the possibility of later expanding it to conform with the Class I specification should not be overlooked. (ii) A copy of the local surface wind records was brought home and has since been analysed by D.M.O. The result of the analysis goes to show that two runways laid in conformity with the Sudan development plan will afford satisfactoiy coverage. (iii) Certain suggestions were made verbally in Khartoum, concerning the location of the civil buildings and the layout of the taxiway system. (iv) A.M.D.G.Y. has arranged for soil samples to be sent to England for examination and test. Mr. Booth, the local Director of Public Works, who was on leave in U.K. recently ■ has been in touch with ii.D.of V# (C.A.) regarding soil test an.; runway constructional problems generally. He too has arranged icr soil samples to be sent to the Road Research Laboratory in England where they will be subject to a different series of tests. » Summary and Recommendations . 7* Khartoum badly needs a new civil airport. If the.soil at Gordon's Tree is found to be satisfactory, the site should prove ideal. Plans for a joint-user airfield ought to be finalised at the earliest possible date, so that a detailed estimate of the probable cost of construction can be prepared. Thereafter as little time as possible should be lost in deciding who is to contribute to the cost of the project, and in what proportion. 8 . The existing aerodrome will suffice for regular peace-time civil operations by 'York' aircraft for no longer than is absolutely necessary. In any event a certain amount of money will almost certainly nave to be spent on it forthwith to satisfy immediate B.O.ii.C. requirements. It must be borne in mind that the Americans have now pulled out of Wadi Seidna South altogether, so that this airfield may not be available much longer for use by B.O.A.C. aircraft that are unable for technical reasons to operate safely from Khartoum. G .106092CIVIL AIRPORTS IN THE UNION OP SOUTH AFRICA Appendix F A* General • The policy of the Union of South Africa is to develop a major international airport in the Pretoria-Johannesburg area., capable of accommodating the largest landplanes so far envisaged and at the seme time to proceed pith somewhat less ambitious projects at Capetown and Durban, in the shape of new civil airports capable of accommodating aircra ft weighing up to approximately 150,000 lbs, gross. 2 . Until these new airports are ready the position will be as follows (a) The South African Air Force airfield at Brooklyn will continue to serve as Capetown's civil airport. (b) The temporary civil landing ground at Palmeitfontein near Johannesburg will be available for 'York' aircraft operating between the United Kingdom and the Union. South African Airways feeder services will continue to use the Rand airport at Germistown for Johannesburg traffic and Zwartkop airfield for Pretoria traffic, for the time being. B. Johannesburg/Pretoria 1 • Although the Rand civil airport at Germistown has been developed tremendously during the war, notably as regards erection of hangars, Y/orkshops, etc., no paved runways have been laid. The undulating nature of the grass surface and the comparatively small dimensions of the landing area render it definitely unsuitable for the commercial operation of York aircraft. 2 . Zwartkop airfield near Pretoria, which is operated by the South African Air Force is not unlike Rand airport in chat it has plenty of buildings but no paved runways. The landing area is very undulating os well as being strictly limited in size by topographical features. 3. It is because of the unsuitability of these two aerodromes that the South Africa State Railway authorities decided about a year ago to develop a temporary civil landing ground on a new site about 10 miles from Johannesburgh, known as Palmeitiontein. . ; Unfortunately it is badly situated to serve Pretoria being about 3A- miles distant. It is for this reason that it has been developed on a temporary basis only. 4. At the end of March, there Y/ere three fairly level grass strips marked off to give 2,200, 1,600 and 1,400 yards respectively. In course of construction parallel to the 2,200 yards runway v’as a 2,000 yards paved runway (10 inches of imported stone, surfaced v.lth a half-inch coating of Tarmac). A simple wooden hut-type terminal building was nearly ready for occupation, as was a control tower mounted on a standard water tank iron-girder support. A small paved apron was being laid in front of the terminal building and the Bellman hangar site; eventually it is to be linked with the near end of the 2,000 yard paved runway. At a later stage a second paved runway 1,400 yards long is to beHaid at an angle of about 50 ° to the primary one. 5. The site is, on the whole, a good one, although judging from reports of ,r York' aircraft sinking into the grass surface when manoeuvring on the ground shortly after a period of heavy rain, there, is some doubt as to whether the sub soil is really suitable for a major airport. It is not possible to say precisely what are the limiting lengths of runways that could be provided; this 7 /ould probably depend upon the amount of soil shifting that the proprietors were prepared to undertake. There' are seemingly no abrupt slopes in the vicinity of the site, that Y/ould render extensions uneconomical. 6 . _ It is proposed that the Union's new International Airoort should be Oonstructed at Kempton Park which is a first rate site lying roughly between Johannesburg and Pretoria, 11 miles from the former and about 23^fram the latter town. Development plans were studied on the spot and appeared satisfactory, G. 108092 . ■ /although ...1 • It was also learned on the best authority that elaborate plans are being G.108092. /prepared - 2 - although the building layout depicted seemed to lack imagination.

The present plans show one ^ards X I ^* ma ^ n runv/a y an ^- two subsidiaries of 2,750 y^ds J-he close proximity of a large dynamite factory constitutes a widely can vassed argument against the development of this particular site. Although no map that indicates the precise location and extent of the factory has been inspected, it is thought that it should not be difficult so to orientate the run- . ^&amp;ys did to design the associated trailic pattern that aircraft never have to f3y directly over the explosive area itself. Such an arrangement might involve rather mde circuits for small aircraft but would probably constitute no hardship in so lar as modern transport types were concerned. 8 . Prom an engineering point, the success of the construction of Kempton Park as an airport is considered to be assured, if it is left in the capable hands of Colonel Greathead, the South African State Railway's Airport Adviser, Conclusion The capital city of the Union and the Reef generally are fortunate in having available such excellent site as Kempton Perk. C. Capetown ^• Brooklyn airfield has been developed during the war as a base for erecting end testing aircraft rather than for operational purposes, although it has been used by a squadron of S.A.A.P. Venturas. It possesses numerous Belman hangars and hutted oifices. The nev/ly-erected control tower is of wooden construction. The landing area is located very close under Table Mountain, with the result that runways are only practicable in three directions at 45 ° to each other. Slightly N.W. of the landing area there is a very large wireless transmitting station, the masts of which constitute a nasty hazard. 2. The dimensions of the grass strips as marked out are 1700, 1500, and 1400 yds. respectively. The soil is sandy and very light and the surface is not well knit with grass; in consequence the sand blows about badly in an aircraft's slip stream, There is one short but wide section of paved runway 800 yards by 200 yards, linked to the apron by a taxi track. It is stated to be almost essential for heavy aircraft to use this strip immediately after rain in the vlnter, as the unpaved surface gets very soft. The extension of the landing area-to the North is practicable but would inevitably involve considerable surface grading, 3. Local airfield control by R/T has recently been instituted and an area control systeal is shortly to be organised by S.A.A.P. 4. Only 1miles distant to the N.E# lies the Royal Naval Air Station at Wingfield. It is stated to have four paved runways each 1200 yards long and to be capable of considerable extension. 5. Whilst in Cape Town, it was first learned that a new civil airport is projected and that the site had already been tentatively earmarked. Details of the site and of the layout, have since been made available to Branch C.A.I. by the office of the Union of South Africe , s High Commissioner in London. Conclusions 6 . Capetown badly needs a better airport than Brooklyn just as soon as possible. The Unrion's intention is remedy the positions, but its aim is unlikely to be achieved for two years. D, Durbarprepared for a new civil airport to serve Durban.. The site prpaasionally selected is 'on a river delta'. The water courses that cn 3 this delta are to be diverted via an artificial cutting through sone low hills bordering the site* The very fact that over 5,000,000 cubic yards of soil have to be shifted to make this cutting, gives some ^es of the magnitude of the project generally.

D, DurbanHi (3; CIVIL AIRPORTS IN ICSNYA (NAIROBI) Appendix G- 1^* There is very little to add to the report dated 6 th April, 1945, comparing Eastleigh^,A.P. airfield with the nev/ civil site named DOONHOLM, situated just across tk Ravine to the South-East. It will be recalled that this report was compiled in Nairobi on the Minister of Civil Aviation’s instructions and that all three members of the U.K. Aerodrome Mission were signatory to it. 2 . Even if it were not for the fact that the development of Doonholm site is reckoned to be cheaper than that of Eastleigh, there is everything to be ®aid in favour of the course advocated, seeing that it will thereby be possible to continue operating the U.K. — Johannesburg trunk route and other local air services from; nastleigh without introducing risks and hazards during the period when the nev/ air port is under construction. In this connection it should be mentioned that the ' Eastleigh runways in their present form are not expected to last for long, as they were laid hurriedly. For permanent civil use they would need to be reconstructed. 3. If the Air Ministry dislikes, the idea of having joint air traffic control of operations from two aerodromes so close together and civil control must have over-riding authority in the interests of civil air transport safety - they can perhaps save money by scrapping the existing aerodrome and building a taxi track and road from their permanent buildings on the technical site across the less steep portion of the ravine on to the new civil runways, seeing that runway maintenance changes are thereby obviated. I 4. The point raised in paragraph 10(f) of the report referred to in paragraph 1 above, concerning the desirability of slightly altering the direction of the new main runway at Doonholm has now been resolved. It has been decided that the two runways should be laid exactly parallel to the Eastleigh ones. 5. The need^for incurring some expenditure on improving Eastleigh up to the safety standards required for ’'York’' operations has been discussed at length with B.O.A.G. A statement of agreed minimum requirements has recently been communica ted to the Ministry in an official letter from B.O.A.C.

D, DurbanPlease see the note^ of the meeting at the H.F.T. on 14th September, which Sir G-. Prior, attended on the subject of the installation of oil tanks and supply of aviation fuel at Bahrein. The background of this complicated subject is Explained in the papers flagged X. ^ Sir G. Prior has now recorded tJ&amp;e note^in this connection in which he suggests that it will be desirable to take early measures for the extension of the Bahrein Civil Air Agreement ' 1 by ten years from 1943, when it is due to expire. His point is that BAPCO may discover that our position as regards installation of aviation oil tanks rests primarily on the Civil Air Agreement, and that they ioay suggest to the Bahrein Cgvemment some alteration on this point in their favour mibrf the time conies to renew it in 1943 or before. Sir G. Prior thinks that he should have no great difficulty in persuading the Sheikh now to give us a further ten years on the grounds that we cannot really be expected to plan ahead and involve ourselves in large future expenditure when we have no guarantee of our continued tenure of the AAl^'H'**** iigre&lt;?meat beyond 1943. I have spoken to the Ministry of no particular objection to Ihe proposal if is not actually committing T ^, m. Civil Aviation and their first reaction was that there was we advise it. It 'ouroolTi^eg to much since^e|only pay the Sheikh an annual sum of £500 plus an additional £4^ a year for each additional service' thus the amount which qS-i ^&gt;7 pay is proportionate to the amount of use which we make of Bahrein, and we are only committed to an expenditure of £500 a year. It is suggested that the best way of getting the matter clear would be to have a meeting at the India Office, and a draft letter to the Ministry of Civil Aviation suggesting this is submitted. Sir G.

He considered that the present moment when the British need to restrict dollar purchases was wellknown was a favourable one for reverting to Abadan supplies. He also confirmed that there could be no objection to the use by Anglo- Irani an o floating storage at Bahrein. f 10. It was agreed that insofar as xlnglo-Irani an were able to meet British requirements in Bahrein from Abadan on a competitive basis, the Air Ministry would purchase supplies from this couroe and if necessary would afford Anglo-Iranian the requisite facilities for erecting tankage on R.A.P. sites. 11 . As a first step the Air Ministry, provided they were assured of supplies to meet their immediate needs, would inform B.A.P.0.0. that they did not wish to purchase any further supplies of Bahrein aviation fuel, and that they would meet local requirements from Abadan under their existing contract with Anglo-Iranian.

The political Agent considers, and I agree, that all that the sale would transfer would be what we understand to be the »proprietary* rights in the land, and that the Shaikh would retain all his ‘•State' 1 rights of charging fees, taxation, etc. unless he limited them by another agreement e.g. a Civil Air Agreement. This would mean that in any future Civil Air Agreement made with the Shaikh only the element of rental would be deducted in computing tne total payment to be made, which total forms the consideration for other elements as well e.g. the right to establish aerodromes, to charge fees, freedom from Customs dues etc, ,/hether the value of the landing fees is calculated on the actual number of services functioning at any one time (as at present vide clause 16 of the Bahrain -'ivil xir Agreement], or met oy a fixed annual payment designed to cover any number of services is a matter for negotiati o_j., the j.act tnat the value of landing fees, exemption from Customs dues, and similar privileges are computed in assessing the total payment is evidence of the iscognition of the Shaikh’s rights in respect of them.I*IHWARD TELEGRAM EXT 2131 163: »%45 Q ' o ?

R.A.F# Middle East as you suggest. While I know that the political resident's suggestion was that we define the alighting area, including the shore area, surely if we ask for the shore area to be defined it will be sufficient.

If» however, you still think I should signal H.Q. R.A.F. Middle East, I will of course do so. Personally I think less confusion will arise by leaving the matter as it stands. F.A.K.

W.C.2. l6th February, 1945 Dear Harrison, We have instructed Mr. F.W. Hancock of the Civil Aviation Department to proceed in company with Mr. Neil Richardson of B.O.A.C., to Bahrein for the purpose of inspecting the aerodrome and ground organisation there in connection with post-wan Civil Aviation. The present arrangements are that they will leave Baghdad for Bahrein on Tuesday, 15th March, departing for Cairo on Thursday, 15th March. If you think it necessary, will you please be good enough to let the Political Resident in the Bahrein Gulf know of their visit and ask him to facilitate their task as necessary. You may, of course, think it unnecessary to bother him in the matter as the R.A.F. Local Authorities are being informed. Yours sincerely F.A.K.

He said that they had selected two possible rites for a landing ground on tfanahah Island neither of which were ideal and that whichever of the two was eventually chosen it would prove somewhat of a problem for the engineers. Qne^bf the sites is Just after the main ^anamah-Awall road l«?av»rs the pula belt and the other is on the west side of the island bet v sen Bud ayah and Zellaq. According to curtain-Jones his suggestion* will now go to the Air Ministry and nothing will bo he«rc? of the project until they have considered the matter. 2. The area required is very considerable. As much as four thousand yards of clear ground being necessary in these days for the main runway f of this approximately throe thousand five hundred yards would be made runway. In addition there mu t be two other runways of approximately two thousand yards. I asked curtain-j nes to let me have a rough plan of the selec ted areas so that I could make preliminary enquiries regarding the ownership of the land. He asked whether there would be any difficulty in acquiring the land and I said that as far as I could foresee there would be v;ry little (tifflculty If the ground were Bahrain Government owned but that in the event of it being prl/ately owned there might be serious difficulties. 3. I asked why an additional landing ground was required and was told that imharraq was not, in its present state, sufficiently firm for very heavy bombers, that the work of building concrete runways, though perfectly feasible, could The Hobble Sir Geoffrey Prior, Political Eosldent in the Persian Gulf Bushire. /only • *•,only bo done by gravely interrupting tho flow of aircraft eastwards and that this could not be permit ted 9 and that although the iron plating now being put down at Muharraq would be protected from corrosion and would Uice the weight 01 viry heavy bombers there whs no certainty that it #ould do so for an indefinite time* The risk of Muharraq breaking up could not be accepted as the flow of aircraft must not be Interrupted therefore some additional site would have to be found* I gathered from curtain- Jones that he had suggested going to the Has Tanura site while MUharraq was put into a fit state to take all types of craft presumably by concreting runways. 4. The above is the gist of the conversation* I gather that the Amoricans are proving as difficult as usual and have announced that the landing ground could be completed by American engineers in six months. curtain-Jones does not think this possible but I do not agree with him for I foel that with their ruthless methods they could do the work in time but we should have a v ry difficult time later trying to re-balance the labour market* Yours sincerely, &lt;«U) T.

W.C.2. 25th January, 1945• Your letter of 1st January (EXT. 5674/14-) to Sir James Ross about the definition of the alighting area at tlanama was briefly touched upon at our meeting this morning at the Air Mins try when the related matter of the installation of bulk storage tanks at Bahrein was discussed. So far as the Air Ministry is concerned, we agree, notwith standing the view expressed in 1937j that it is desirable to define the area of the H Sea Aerodrome* 4 at Manama and that in this connection the formal acceptance of the Bahrein Government of the definition of ”Aerodrome' in the Indian Aircraft Rules 1920 should be secured. We shall therefore be grateful if you will ask the Political Resident to proceed accordingly, after consultation with the Local R.A. F. Authorities and B.O.A. C. regarding the area actually to be defined. With regard to the penultimate paragraph of your letter, we would not suggest for one moment that the political negotiations and our good relationships with the Sheikh should be embarrassed in any way by the almost insignificant financial issues which may arise, but it would be as well that the negotiator should have in mind the financial position as it stands today, i.e. that the payments to the Sheikh resulting from increased civil air operations by both landplanes and flying boats have risen fromi£50 in the first year of the Givil Agreement to £1,600 in the last completed year, and are likely to rise still higher. Against that, we may be asked for some payment for the rent of land which has been in long established use, has formed an essential part of the flying boat operations and only now comes into the question because of a general (but proper) proposal to define precisely what areas of land and foreshore constitute the Manama Air Base from the point of view of tenancy rights. At this morning^ meeting it was, as you know, decided to provide bulk fuel storage tanks at Manama, and we shall have to acquire land adjacent to the jetty for that purpose. It would therefore P.A.K.

The international convention relating to air transport is the Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation 1919&gt; the provisions of which were implemented by H.H.G. in the Air Navigation Act 1920* No definition of an aerodrome was included either in the Convention or in the Act. A definition was given in the Statutory Rules and Orders which were issued under the Act (§.R. &amp; 0. 1922 No.663)&gt; but for the present purpose this definition is probably less satisfactory than that included in the Indian Aircraft Rules 1920 and the Orders are in any case limited to navigation in or over the British Islands or the territorial waters adjacent thereto. For what it is worth you may, however, like to have the United kingdom definition, which is:- 'Aerodcme” means any definite and limited ground or water area intended to be used, either wholly or in part, for the landing or departure of aircraft. Since the Bahrein Government seem content to accept the definition contained in the Indian Aircraft Rules 1920, perhaps it would be sufficient to proceed on this basis. in.

Sir, V ' • I have the honour to enclose copies of a letter addressed by me No.C/1429 dated October 5th to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and his reply thereto dated October 17 th, No. 1917 - 31 . 2. The question of the extension of the pier to*accommodate the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's refuelling barge which is prim arily used for storing petrol for the refuelling of aircraft engaged in the carrying of Service personnel requires immediate decision. I have therefore informed Air Headquarters, Habban- iyah, in reply to their telegram No. 17 of October 3rd_. (a copy of which is enclosed) that the Bahrain Government have no objection to the project provided the Anglo-Irani a n Oil Company will be prepared to pay such reasonable rent as nay be demanded should it be eventually decided that the new extension is not part of the aerodrome buildings as defined in Indian Aircraft Rules 1920. I 3« You wli .1 note that th® Adviser has raised the general question of the recent extensions to the pier# In 1937 Sir Olaf Caroe who was than acting as Resident held the view that the shelter for passengers referred to in paragraph 5 of the Adviser's letter was a facility which should be considered to be covered by the Civil Air Agreement (cf. para 4 of Sir Olaf Caroe's letter No.C/298 dated September 30th, 1337). Later in the same year Sir Trenchard Rowle having returned from leave this ruling was reversed and the area of land required for the shelter was considered not to come within the 'aerodroce' for the reasons apparently that it could be considered to be 'cultivated or occupied land' and Imperial Airwayswars adjudged to be liable to pay an annual rental (cf« para 4^ of 3ii Trenchard Fowled letter No. 86 B-S dated 20th December, Ij37). Thus there have been opposing decisions within a period of threa months though of course the latter ruling has more weight and has in fact determined our attitude up to the present tiine. Much so that I have raired the question verbally with the British Overseas Airways Corporation and the Royal Air Force, and the latter are now investigating their position vis-a-vis the British Overseas Airways Corporation, about which they seem somewhat perplexed* On receiving an official communication fron the Royal Air Fores it was my intention to m&amp;’&lt;ce an official reference to the Bahrain Government* 4. In my opinion the ruling given by Sir Qlaf Caroe was e correct and therefore we should consider tne pier and the present buildings as being part of the 'aerocirome* and thus covered by the Civil Air Agreement and the interested parties i.e. the Bahrain Government, R.A.F. and the B.O.A.C. be so informed. Vfhen conveying this decision to the h.A.F. I suggest that they should be asited to delineate on a map of the area what in their view are the exact boundaries of the 'aerodrome' • Once this lias been don^ and the Bahrain Government have agreed to the boundaries the position will be much simplified and the question of the leasing of sites should not arise though I consider this Agency and the Bahrain Govex*nmant should always be consulted before any construction takes place in order that it may be ascertained whether there is any political or other objection* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, Bahrain.• /&gt; C 0 r Y CONFIDtJlIIAi.

Prom, r i ■* •» ‘j C. Dalrymple Belgrade, Esquire, C.3.E., Adviser to the Buiiraiif Government, Bahrain. ' To, His Britannic Majesty*s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your memorandum No.C/1429 dated 6 th October, 1944, which raises various questions in connection with the buildings at the sea aerodrome and the Civil Air Agreement. 2. According to the Civil Air Agreement His Highness the Shaikh granted to the British Government exclusive rights to establish and maintain as Kis Highness* agents two aerodromes in Bahrain, the land aerodrome on Muharraq Island the sea aerodrome on Manama. The agreement was for seven years, from 1 st January 1942. 3. It a pears to me that according to the agreement the question as to whether the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company should be allowed to run a pipe line along the Royal Air Force pier and to build an extension to the R.A.F. pier to accommodate a refilling barge is a matter for the British Government to decide. The site of the proposed extension is inside the sea aerodrome and the new building is part of the buildings pertaining to the aerodrome according to my interpretation of the definition of an aerodrome as described in Indian Aircraft Rules 1920 of which % an extract was sent to me by you.n- 4. If however it is considered that the new extension is not a part of the aerodrome buildings the Bahrain Govern ment will be willing to lease the site to the A*I.O.C« at a reasonable rent. In this connection I would point out that the Bahrain Petroleum Company could have no objection to the laying down of pipe lines as the Bapco concession does not ^rant the Company an exclusive right to the use of pipe lines in Bahrain. 5. There are various points connected with the buildings used by the R.A.F. on the edge of the aerodrome which I think should be clarified. The building occupied by the R.A.F. at the land end of the pier was bought by the British Government from the Bahrain Government about 15 years ago. The property includes about 30 feet of the foreshore. The pier was built by the R.A.F. y most of it occupies ground ^ £ which is the property of the Bahrain Government and the R.A.F. has no title of it. The site of the small house on the south of the pier, previously used for passengers, is leased by the Bahrain Government to Imperial Airways for 15 years. The lease was made before the Civil Air Agree ment was concluded. The extension in width of the pier and the enlargement of the pierhead, which was only complet ed this year, was carried out by ti.e R.A.F. or by the British Overseas Airways Corporation without the permission of the Bahrain Government on land belonging to the Bahrain Government. It would appear that these two works, widening the pier and adding to the pierhead come under the category of structures pertaining to the aero drome, according to the Civil Air Agreement. 6 . The Civil Air Agreement is for seven years. It is most unlikely that it will not be renewvd In some form / or otheror other after that period but I thiak it is desirable that it should be established to whom these various buildiags &gt; which are built upon Baurain Government land, do actually belong* If the agreement is not renewed will their ownership revert to the Bahrain Government ? 7* His Highness* attitude in all matters of this des cription is that during the war every possible assistance should be given freely by his State to military services* His Highness does not regard commercial companies and military services as being in the same category and there fore I suggest that the ownership of the H.A.F. - B.O.A*C. on trie sea aerodrome should be put on a sound basis* I have the honour to be.

Dated the 12th November, 1944. From: The Political Agent, Bahrain . To: The Hon 1 ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Bahrain . Sir, I have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter No. 73-12 dated the 9th of February 1944 from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government on the subject of the lease of a section of the present landing ground at Muharraq. 2. I took up the question with the Air Liaison Officer and on the 26th of October he called upon me and stated that he had now been instructed by his Headquarters to discuss the rmU position. At my suggestion our discussions were deferred until the 7th of November in order to enable the Adviser to the Bahrain Government to be present. After some general conversation on the subject under consideration I suggested that a possible solution would be for the Air Ministry to rent the area 'C* for the remaining period of the Civil Air Agreement under which the area' •B* was leased to them. This would mean that the three areas, ’A 1 , *B 1 , and ‘C’ would be under the control of the R.A.F., ’A* for ever, '3 1 and ‘C until the 3lst of December 1948 when the whole future question of civil aviation in its relation to the Persian Gulf in general and Bahrain in particular could be considered. The Air Liaison Officer and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government stated that they were in agreement with my suggestion and the former indicated that he would communicate with Air Headquarters Iraq.

Tos H.B.M*s. Political Agent, Bahrain . MBMORANDUM . The present aerodrome at Muharraq now consists of three different sections ,, A M the area which is owned by the H.A.F., acquired some yegrs ago by purchase from the Bahrain Government. '‘B' the old Civil Aerodrome which is leased fr 9 m the Bahrain Government by the Air Ministry. 'C M an irregular shaped ground lying between the areas A and B which is the property of the Bahrain Government and for which no rental is paid. I think it is desirable at this time that some definite arrangement should be made between the Bahrain Government and the R.A.F. about area ,, C H which covers approx imately 504178 square yards. The Bahrain Government would be willing either to sell this piece of land to the R.A.F. or to let it to the R.A.F. in the same manner as the other area the R.A.F. rented from the Bahrain Government. I enclose a rough sketch showing the position of the area in question and I should be grateful if the matter could be taken up with the proper authorities. Sd./ Dalryraple Belgrave.

Unfortunately the landing gr unc ao Maharraq was not sufficiently solid to permit of its being hsed by Halifaxes whose weight per square inch of tyre was great er than any other aircraft. The possibility of improving the surface by the use of wire mesh had been considered and would be very satisfactory but unfortunately wire mesh was very bare to come by and might not be immediately.available. In the meantime two experts were due to arrive on the 2nd who would make a care ful examination of the landing ground. They would also examine the Has Tanurah and Dhahran landing grounds. 2. Air Commodore Whitney Straight stated tha.t he would very much like to land at Has Tanurah and Dhahran with a viev/ to examining thowe landing grounds to see whether they would be suitable for his purpose. I explained that permission would have to be sought from the Saudi Government and that I would set^ about doing so first thing the next morning. I asked whether he had considered Qatar peninsula, forgetting the absence of water there. But he did not appear to be particularly interested and I do not think that we need expect any move in that direction. . 3.

Please refer to Jedda telegram 157 of 10th May, copy forwarded under EXT. 2156/14 of 19th May 1944 (not copied to Bahrein), regarding American request for permission to construct airfields in Saudi Arabia. 2. On October 3rd A.O.C. Middle East telegraphed stating that message had been received from Washington by local U. S.A.A.F. authorities requiring them to arrange immediately for the provision of Very Heavy Bomber Airfield at Dhahran, and that reply had been sent to iTashington on A. O.C. 's advice requesting that proposal should be put as firm requirement to British Chiefs of Staff, Until such proposal is received no action is being taken by British authorities either at Washington or London. 3. Meanwhile, matter has been considered here provisionally under following heads:- (a) Our transport interests. /f Air Ministry consider that it would be advantageous to have large relief aerodrome of this kind provided it did not add to our maintenance difficulties in the area. Sane relief could, however, possibly be afforded at perhaps less cost by Americans developing Abadan. As regards Bahrain, trouble is at present being experienced v/ioh use of runways by heavy aircraft, though by use of steel planicing it is hoped that airfield will be fit for use by heavy aircraft by February next. To provide full length V.H.B. runways however, at Bahrain, would be major undertaking of many months and airfield would meanwhile be largely out of commission. (i jmi replying separately tc^our R-rp-rn.^ ^ letter No. c/209 of _A£ )th August regarding future use cf Muharraq aerodrome) (b) Constructicnal aspect. Owing to other liabilities in Middle East and Persian Gulf region it would probably be impossible for British Authorities to construct airfield at Lhahran of type proposed and Americans would have to do it themselves and at their own charge, (c) The American case. The Americans can probably make a good military case for building a heavy bomber airfield at Dhahran though it is doubtful whether they could justify provision of V.H.B. airfield. The northern route via the Azores and Persian Gulf is being developed and will be much more heavily used than hitherto. It is possible however, that development of Abadan may suit them as well for ’ /practical \practical purposes. (d) The Political aspect. It is considered tint only circunstances in which K.M.G. should endeavour to assist the dncricans to overccine Ibn Saud s prohable reluctance t ; omit the construction of new airfields in his territory would be if the construction of such ainielus were essential to the war effort. It must therefore be considerc whether facilities already existing at airfields in the Persian Gulf area are sufficient without the provision of a new airfield in Saudi Arabia. It would probably be desirable to advise Ibn Saud that he should request an assurance that the airfield would revert to his ownership after the war* A. You will see that the matter has not yet reached a definite stage and if you have any observations on the political aspect I should be glad to receive them by telegram. It seems not improbable that if the wnericans in fact constructed an airfield at Dhahran in accordance with their own requirements they would cease to use Bahrain to any appreciable extent* Th® of th® above ha® b®ea duly authorised#practical purposes.

GEOFFREY PRIOR Political Resident, Persian Gulf ATTESTED for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.H In Karachi on the 17th of August Mr. hloyd-Taylor the B.O.A.C. Regions.!, Direqtgr showe^ me the minutes of a- w—1|III-T. T, - ' rn ■ —! / meeting of the Middle East Air Transport hoard held in Cairo on the Axh cf August. It was recorded that Air Vice Marshal Betts had stated that the U.S.A. .C. wished to construct r large aerodrome at Dhahran capable of accommodat ing heavy aircraft. The Air Vice Marshal inti istdothat short Aft^.iiya 0 f essential materials would render this impractic able. lie further stated that experiments carried out at Bahrain showed that the landing ground there was unsuitable for heavy aircraft at present and that owing to ataospnerlc conditions it would not bfc possible to rendox* it suitable y /I A** in the future. 2. Mr. Llo - .•'•'.lor was by this reuort .mich r-' h ‘.A- C*~ fa*. . if/*' Oi he? oonsidsrsd ill founded us h 'i had air 3acly’ had expari/Tients carried out by Mr. Atkin the Corporation^ engineer, vho was present during flay eonversetion with the Regional Director* which had proved to the satisfaction of both of tho:a that though not at preso/it suitable for the heaviest aircruit it would be a matter of little difficulty to make the landing ground into one of the finest in the world. 3. This is the first intimation that I have had that the R.a.F. are dissatisfied with the *iuharrak ground and that experiments had been carried out. Thpt the ; eovier bombers showed &amp; tendency to sink when uj-ou a, load of petrol is a fact . but r have always been given to understand that the resurfacing c i the landing strips after the war would be simple ai’.d wt»ulcl remove this present dis advantage. Until Ay interview with Mr. Lloyd-Taylor I understood from conversations xxiiix which I had had with .,rP h el. Sir Frederick Bowhill and Air Vice Marshalls Collier end Davison that the Mubarrak gromd was ideal for post war aviation. It is therefore somewhat surprising to learn that not only v/ill it not be ideal but is in fact a complete f ail* ure * . In view of the importance tti Bain^ain of A.V.M. k 4— ^2- statement it is desirable that the A*0.

Lloyd Taylor, Mvisidnal Superintendent, British Cverseas Airways Corporation,! ; 2gCl1Led to see me this morning# He stated that ■ a'wtltri'pa'ted increasing their services very shortly and that they proposed, that no night stop should be made in bahrain, but the bast- Bound service would halt for two hours in the early jaoming anc. the West-bound for two hours in the aiternoon# Thus it would only be necessary to provide passengers with breakfast and tea. However, he considered that arrangements would have to be made to cater for emergency night stops and that the maximum number of persons who would have to stay at night and be rationed would not exceed 200# 2# i made it clear to hr# Lloyd Taylor that the British Overseas Airways Corporation would have to import food stuffs to meet their requirements and that they could not be supplied from bahrain# Meat and fish would probably be available; the latter all the y%ar round ana the former in adequate quantities in the winter, but they must also be prepared to be rationed as far as meat is concerned during the summer months. An other words, they would have to cater for themselves to the same extent as the Royal Air j oree do now# 3# Mr. Lloyd Taylor said that he had great visions of the future and considered that Bahrain would become one of the principal air ports of the England - Australia route after the war. He visualised a very large concrete landing ground the preparation cf which would involve suction dredging and the raising of the present surface of Moh&amp;rraq island by at least two feet. He also foresaw the provision of a marine base at moharraq instead of at Manama as at present am the building of adequate first class hotel accommodation for a very large number of passengers. He suggested that the scheme should be put in hand almost immediately so as to be prepared to resume peace-time services as soon as the war was over and he asked what the channel of communication with the Bahrain Government would be. 4. 1 said that he would no doubt make his representa tions to the Headquarters of his own Company and that they would approach the Political Authorities in the Persian Gulf through the India Office. As soon as such an approach has been made the Political Authorities would take up the major questions of the lease of land, etc., with the Bahrain Government and as they arise tne British overseas Airways Corporation would conduct their ordinary small routine business direct with tie officials of the Bahrain Government provided the Political Agency was fully informed of what was being done and that it was clear that all non-routine matters would be dealt with through the Agency ana not direct.r 3 ' ■ ILE COP' r E^r ‘ p; n . w -J IK7ARD TELli f S4 -%QgJ^ ' - ^7* ( If in any case the communication of the contents , of this document to any person outside G-overoment Service is authorised, it must be paraphrased)« Allotted to External Department..

We have now to consider the position which has arisen following the permission granted to K. L. M. to make calls at Bahrein. His Majesty's Government and the Sheikh lays on the former the obligation to pay to the Sheikh the amount of any customs duty on fuel and oil supplies to aircraft other than those of Imperial Airways Ltd. (now 3.0.A.C. /( We assume that in practice the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are responsible for the payment direct to the Bahrein Government of the amounts of duty on fuel and oil supplied to K.L.M.

The agreement is due to be renewed therefore, on the 1st January next, and the DeparZtment of Civil Aviation of the Air Ministry have written requesting that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf may be directed to negotiate with the Sheikh, for the renewal of the agreement on the same lines for a further period of 7 years commencing 1st January, 1942.

In April last we made a payment for the period ending 31st December 1939 and in the absence of specific provision we calculated payment for the additional services passing through Bahrein by reference to the number of months up to that date during v/hich the additional services were to be operated. on the outbreak of war three of the additional services were suspended but two have since been re-instated with effect from 18th October and 4th November 1939 respectively. We are now proposing to make payment in respect of 1940, amounting to £950 on the basis of three additional services, and normally v/e should take steps to recover from that total a sum of approximately £75 in respect of the period during 1939 in v/hich the additional services v/ere suspended. We hesitate to do so, however, without being assured that at the present time there v/ould be C.H. Johnston, Ssq. , Foreign office, Downing street, S.W.l. no/no undesirable political reactions. v/e have particularly in mind the press reports of the generosity of the Sheikh in the way of a contribution towards the expenses of the war.

(It ia regretted that King 1 e Iriuter's copies of the British Overseas Airways Act are not yet available, but the enclosed copies of the Bill as introduced in the House of Lords h&amp;ve been brought up to date by the insertion of all the amendments made subsequently)• 2* Under that Act the undertaking of Imperial Airways, Ltd., by whom the Empire Air Mail scheme is at present operated, is to be transferred, from an '’appointed day” in the neer future, to a new statutory corporation to be called 'British Oversea* Airway^ Corporation'. Under ection 10 of the Act, contracts between the secretary of .tate ^or Air and the company will be terminated from the 'appointed day' but contracts between His Majesty’s lost mas ter ••General and the company will continue, with the substitution qi the Corporation xor the company. The Empire Agreement is one ofthe agreements which will be terminated in to far as the contract between the secretary oi ^t&amp;te for Air and the company it concerned. It it nevertneleas intended that the Lervictb for which the Empire Agreement proviaeo thall be continued and developed, and it is hoped that the effect of the revised arrangements, when fully operative, will be auch that participating Goverrimenta will receive, not merely services as good a&amp; would have been the ca&amp;e if the Empire Agreement had remained in force, but services improved to an extent which would have been impracticable so long as they were in the hands of a commercial company operating under a subsidy agreement. 3* It will be observed that the financial arrangements which are contemplated between His Majesty*s Government in the United Kingdom and the new Corporation will differ in form from those which have existed in the past between that Government and imperial Airways, Ltd. Payments from the United Kingdom Exchequer will no longer taKe the form of subsidies related to specified services, but of rants related to the excess of estimated expenditure over estimated revenue on an approved programme, normally covering three years, of all air transport services anc other activities to be undertaken by the Corporation. 4. In connection with the participation of India in the Bapire Air Mail scheme, the Government of India have agreed to maite contributions to subsidy in addition to payments for the carriage oi mail, have granted relieffrom landing charges and from taxation on fuel and oil, and huve arranged for the provision ana maintenance of certain ground organisation within India. nir Kingsley Wood w^uld be grateful ii the Marques® oi Zetland would invite theGorermient o£ India to indicate their willingness to continue subsidy payments on the agreed scale and to continue to provide facilities and benefits similar to those at present enjoyed by imj©rial Airways, Ltd* and its subsidiary ana asoociated companies* I am, &amp;o*, (id.)

Political Agent, Bahrain. tf Reference your Express Letter No.P.2. 1557/38, dated 22nd March 1938, on the subject of the Bahrain Civil Air Agreement. 2. As I have unofficial knowledge of the views of the Bahrain Government in regard to exemption from customs and other duties, it seems desirable to refer certain points for consideration before making an official approach to His Highness the Shaikh in regard to a new revised draft of Article 15 of the Civil Air Agreement. The references below are to paragraph 3 of the Air Ministry letter of 7th March 1938 enclosed with your Express Letter under reference. 3. Paragraph 3(b)(i) . The Bahrain Government do not themselves draw a distinction between ^accessories and equipment w and H spare parts” and no difficulty need be anticipated over this point. raragraph 3 (b)(ii)/ {signature) 11 S. 44 . {Designation)Paragraph 3(b)(ill # The Bahrain Government, not unreasonably, draw a clear distinction between duties and taxes. They have already ex empted from customs and other duties petrol and oil etc., but they hold that under the existing Agreement they are entitled to collect the usual taxes on all articles imported into Bah rain. The revised draft Agreement, as it stands at present, contains no reference to 'taxes*, and since it is a commercial agreement by which His Majesty’s Government or their agents obtain certain facilities in exchange for a certain payment. it may be difficult to induce the Bahrain Government to add to the facilities, though not to the payment, unless adequate reasons can be suggested for so doing. The actual taxes arei- (i) Khanchieh, i.e. ground rent for space occupied, (ii) Porterage and (iii) Pier Pees, which include a municipal tax. The rates applicable ares 4 gallon tins of petrol (i) Rs. 0 - 0 - 6 (ii) Rs. 0 - 0 - 9 (iii) Rs. 0 - 0 - 9 12 gallon casks of lubri cating oil . Rs. 0 - 4 - 0 Rs. 0-9-0 Rs. 0 - 1 - 6 respectively, though porterage is not at present charged on petrol and oil. A further point which causes seme concern to the Bahrain Government is that petrol and oil for Imperial Airways’ aircraft are not in fact imported by Imperial Airways or by His Majesty’s Government, but by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited through their local agent as a part of general con signments. Indeed some of the oil is imported frem Germany and extensive variations between the customs duties paid and sub sequent claims received from Imperial Airways appear to indicate that the contract price for the oil and the value declared Cor customs/Difficulties of this customs purposes are not the same nature are liable to impede negotiations for additional facilities. oil used in the launches is also likely to lead to diff iculty. There is undoubtedly a feeling in Bahrain that exmmptions become cumulative. They begin with fuel for aircraft, extend later to fuel for launches and may in due course go on to fuel for any land transport used by Imper ial Airways, materials for buildings, supplies for personnel and so on. There is moreover the feeling that since petrol is produced in Bahrain itself it might at least be used in the launches as soon as the expiry of existing contracts permits this. 4. I have made these observations in full, since the unofficial views of the Bahrain Government seem to me to be not entirely unreasonable and I request instructions if the ^approach is to be modified in any particular.

In reply, I am to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that Lord Swinton notes with satisfaction that the Sheikh of Bahrein has given his consent to the operation of the flying boat services via Bahrein, and has approved the amendments to the Bahrein Civil Air Navigation Regulations which were suggested in Air Ministry letter of the 24th July, 1937, No. S. 32956/III/A.

It is noted that the Bahrein Government have now withdrawn their request for the definition of the flying boat base at Manama. (b) Exemption from customs duty on marine equipment . It is suggested that the revised draft of Article 15 of the Civil Air Agreement should be amended in the following respects (i) The exemption of general accessories and equipment appertaining to motor launches and dinghys is provided for, but exemption should also extend to general accessories and equipment of the aircraft. (ii) The exemption in Article 15 should apply to ’’Customs and other duties and taxes”. As regards (ii) it is understood that Imperial Airways Limited are at present experiencing difficulty in the recovery at Bahrein of what is called a ’’yard' tax.

O' 3 7 — / November, 1937# I am replying to your letter of the 9th instant, No. P.Z.6972/37, regarding landing grounds at Muharraq. The rumour as to the proposed change-over from the civil landing ground to the R.A.P. landing ground by Imperial Airways T aircraft calling at Muharraq, would appear to be related to a recommendation, contained in a letter dated 13th August last - of which I enclose a copy for your information - from the Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in Iraq, that as a matter of distant policy both R.A.P. and civil aviation activities should be concentrated on the R.A.P. aerodrome. You will observe that the Air Officer Commanding in making this recommendation did not contemplate any disturbance of the new civil air agreement with the Bahrein Government which has now proceeded some considerable way towards conclusion, and which the Air Officer Commanding suggested should be allowed to run its course. Yours sincerely, ^ J.P. Gibson, Esq., Political Department, India Office, S.W.l.S«11030/5/Air* Q« Air Headquarters, British Poroes in Iraq, Hinaida, ’Iraq. 13th August. 1927 . MUHARRAQ LAITDING GROUNDS . Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter S.32956/III/0.1.(B) dated 21st June, 1937, and to say that I have considered the question of the landing grounds at Muharraq. 2. The Royal Air Force aerodrome is rectangular and approximately 1,200 yards by 1,000 yaras. There is therefore no difficulty in obtaining the runs mentioned in para. 2 of your letter. The civil landing ground, however, is too small to admit of the lengths required and it is doubtful whether it would be possible to obtain the necessary extensions without a considerable amount of cutting and filling. Further, in my opinion, it would be somewhat undesirable to have two aerodromes in such close proximity. The question of the control of such aerodromes would, to my mind, present a good deal of difficulty. 3 # l recommend, therefore, that our distant policy should be to concentrate both service and civil aviation activities on the Royal Air Force aerodrome. 4 . \ The agreement with the Bahrein Government in respect of the civil landing ground has been negotiated and as this involves a payment of £1,000 per annum it would be undesirable to go back on the agreement even though it has not yet been signed. 5 * x recommend, therefore, that this agreement should be allowed to run its course and on expiration that the civil aviation activities should be transferred to the Royal Air Force aerodrome. 5 # With reference to para. 6 of your letter I an including a map of Muharraq Island based on the recent survey, together with a plan of the R.A.F. landing ground.

(a) Area of the flying boat base at Manama, ' (b) exemption from customs duty on marine equipment. 3. As regards (a) the Bahrain Government have asked that it should be defined, as portions of the foreshore in the vicinity, as also certain areas below low water mark, are private property, and some near-by fish traps are public property.

I enclose copy of a letter No. 923/29, dated the 1st September 1937, from the Adviser, Bahrain Government, to the Political Agent, from which it will be seen that the Bahrain Government are willing to grant the required exemption, and have enclosed a draft clause 15 to replace the existing clause. 5. With his letter quoted above, the Adviser has also enclosed a draft clause 16 to cover the revised financial terms agreed on (cf. correspondence connected with my Sxpress Letter No .633- S, dated the 24th August 193 7). 6. When the area of the flying boat base has been defined, and draft clauses in substitution of 15, 16 and 17 oi' the Civil Air Agreement have been approved, the amendment of the existing clauses can be effected by an exchange of letters between the Political Agent, Bahrain, and the Government of Bahrain.

As a matter of interest, during the course of a conversation which I had with Hrskine and Cox who interviewed rae this morning in connection with the building of qurrters on the Muharraq Island, they mentioned that it was highly probable that the Air Ministry .yould abolish the Muharraq landing ground for civil aircraft and would insist on Imperial Airways making use of the Royal Air Rorce landing ground. I have heard this rumour before but in view of the correspondence that has been going on with regard to the completion of the Civil Air Agreement I did not credit it. i - ftink tnat it would be as well if it can be confirmed whether the aerodrome is to be abolished or not because it would seem unnecessary to continue our somewhat lengthy and difficult correspondence on this subject if it is not to be of any avail.

A map showing, in detail, the boundaries of the * aerodrome will be furnished as soon as it is available. . 3 * * n ‘tiie meantime, it seems desirable that the formal consent of the Sheikh of Bahrein should be obtained to the °?r^ 10n 0f ial . Airw ays ’ contemplated flying-boat services via Bahrein v/ith landings on the water near Manama. In this connection, I am to enclose a map indicating the location of the proposed flying-boat base and alighting area. tt 4 * The ? se of an alighting area on the water near Manama will entail a revision of the 'Air Navigation Regula- rv^?+f° r Glvl1 Aircraft for the Territory of Bahrein, and Conditions governing the use of the Aerodrome at Muharraa approved by His Excellency the Sheikh Hamad bin*Isa A1 Analifah C.3.I., Ruler of Bahrein,' which permit of landings by aircraft at Muharraq only. The amendments necessary would seem to be as follows:- Qn ^ “ The Air Naviga tion Regulations for Civil Aircraft. ——(ii). Paragraph 11 - Delete the words 'Liuharraq Aerodrome' and substitute the words 'the Aerodromes at Luharraq and Manama.' (b) .

Paragraph 2 (ii) — After the word 'Muharraq' insert the v/ords 'in the case of landplanes, or the aerodrome at Manama in the case of seaplanes. ' 5 . I am now to ask that, subject to the concurrence of the Marquess of Zetland,the Political Resident in the Persian 'ault may be instructed to approach the Sheikh with a view to obtaining his formal consent to the operation of Imperial Airv/ays 1 flying-boat services via Bahrein, and approval of the amendment of the local Air Navigation Regulations. 6 . Lord Swinton would suggest that the Marquess of wetland may also wish to consider whether any approach to the Sultan of Muscat and Oman is desirable with reference to the proposed opera tion of flying-boat services over his territories v/ith landings at Gwadar. No amendment of the local air navigation regulations seems to be required if the term 'Gwadar Aerodrome' can be interpreted as including flying boat bases as well as the land aerodrome. 7. Lord Sv/inton would propose that the detailed arrangements for facilities for the flying boat services at Manama and Gwadar should be left for settlement locally. He is given to understand that Imperial Airv/ays have already made the necessary arrangements there in respect of the preliminary survey flights.

I Air Ministry letter of 9th) now enclose a April with enclosures. ) copy of a letter from the Air Ministry upon which we shall be glad to receive your views. Ministry letter show clearly the value of the exemptions from petrol and oi^. duties, and we now at last have all the cards on the table. You will see that if the increased payments to the Rulers were strictly based on the estimated increase in consumption, they would probably be larger than those now pro posed. Cn the other hand we feel that there is considerable force in the argument (which the Air Ministry very strongly urged in inter-departmental discussion) that were the Rulers to observe the now recognised internation al practice of granting drawback, their claims to compensation would disappear. 21st April, 1936 2. The figures attached to the Air Lt .Col.T.C .Fowle ,C .B .E., Consul General, Bushire. We/V 2. We suggest, therefore, that the present proposals put forward by the Air Ministry, which constitute a substantial advance on their previous proposals, are worth sympathetic consideration and that it is probably not too much to expect the rulers to tie themselves down for 7 years in return for the financial advantages which they would derive. 3. The financial benefits which will accrue to the rulers under each of the ^ two alternatives suggested by the Air Ministry seem to be nicely balanced. It seems unlikely that the endurance of aeroplanes will increase to such an extent within the next 7 years that it will be possible to dispense with the present stopping places, so it appears that alter native (b) is almost as safe an arrangement as alternative (a). In either case it would be necessary to revise articles 16 and 17 of the Civil Air Agreements as well as article 15 in the case of Muscat, as it is clearly essential that the Sultan of Muscat should agree to non-payment of customs duty in the first instance. The choice between the two alternatives appears, therefore, primarily to depend upon which will be the easier to negotiate. (b) might from this point of view be preferable as it is based on a simple and logical principle; moreover the figure of £150 per weekly flight compares favourably with the present actual value of the exemption at Bahrein (£230 for 2 flights) and appears to be almost exactly the present value at Muscat if calculated on a 5^ basis (£597 at 10$). As/ * IQ3F 2. 4 # As you will see Treasury authority has to he obtained before the rulers can be approached, so we should be grateful for your comments as soon as possible, 5.

S r v.f rs 3#'32956 (Part II) F.*\ AIR MINISTRY, LONDON, u.C. 2. 9th Ax^ril 1936* / / Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for Air to refer to your letter of the 23rd December last, p.2.8744/35, regarding the question of the revision of the Bahrein, Koweit and Muscat Civil Air Agreements, to subsequent semi-official correspondence, and to the meeting between representatives of the Incia Office and Air Ministry on the 13th ultimo. While, as stated in this Department’s letter of the 31st August last, S 32956/llA.r.C.A., Lord Swlrton agrees that in view of the increased use of the landing grounds and the still further use which will be made uni er the Empire Air Mail Scheme| some, increase in th€; annual payments to the rulers of Bahrein and Muscat is Justified, he is very reluctant to agree that such increase should be directly related to the quantities of oil fuel imported into these States for the purpose of refuelling the machines. I am to enclose a copy of a statement furnished by Imperial Airways shewing the present annual imports of petrol and oil and the duty charged, together with estimates of the corresponding figures when the Empire Air Mail Scheme is in operation. The Company point out that the figures are given with some reserve as they understand that further debits are to be received for the 6 months ended 30th September 1935, suppliers having charged incorrect amounts. It is now a recognised international practice to grant exemption from Customs or other duties in r espect of fuel and oil taken on board for the purpose of operating machines to The Unaer-Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office, 3.W. 1. places/-IT?&gt; places outside the territory in which the stock is maintained and where duty has already been paid, a Customs drawback is granted in respect of any quantities of oil and petrol supplied to aircraft for use in such circumstances* II# therefore, the rulers of these two States conformed to international practice, the complaint as to the apparent loss of customs revenue owing to the operation of the exempticxi clause in the civil air agreements, would disappear* Lord Swinton also desires to point out that, apart from the advantages which will accrue to the territories by the establishment of the civil air routes, the continued maintenance oi such a route through these terrl tories facilitates the passage of military aircraft in emergency, which is an essential requirement if His Majesty’s Government are to be enabled to come to the assistance of these rulers in time of emergency* In these circumstances Lord Swinton would prefer to base the increased rentals at Bahrein and Gwadar on the general increase in use by Imperial Airways of the facilities provided and would be prepared to seek Treasury authority for either of the following alternatives: (a) Mew Agreements for 7 years at an increased rental of £1,0 iC a year with retrospective effect to thedate when the service was duplicated, viz: lat January 1935, covering the privileges enumerated under 'A' and 'B” of the Political Resident’s Express Letter 894/3 of 37th November last; continuance for a further period of 7 years with an increased .'.'.ayiaent of £150 a year in respect of each additional service undertaken by Imperial Airways over and above the first service covered by the payment of £500 a year under the original agreement* (b) to revise the existing agreements to provide for their or 1/I am accordingly to suggest that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should be informed of the foregoing views and be asked to consider the possibility of negotiating agreements with the rulers of Bahrein and Muscat on one or other of the bases suggestedf in substitution for the existing agreements which are not due to expire until the 6th June 1938 and 26th October 1938 f respectively. Colonel Fowle will no doubt point out to the rulers concerned that uni er the first alternative they would receive a guaranteed annual amount irrespective of the number of services in operation, whilst under the latter arrangement, there is a possibility of variation in the amounts payable, as in the event of an improvement in the endurance of machines employed on this route, landings at one of the intermediate stopping places might be rendered unnecessary. It is assumed that in view of the increased payments offered under either alternative, the Sultan of Muscat would agree to non-payment of Customs duty in the first instance, instead of the present unfortunate system of a quarterly refund. With regard to Koweit, I am to explain that this landing groun&gt; is not scheduled as a regular stopping place under the Empire Air Mail Scheme and it will only be used on special occasions or in emergency. Lord Swinton does not consider, therefore, that any reason exists for an increase in the annual payment of £500 to the ruler. A copy of a letter dated 6th March 1936, which has been received from Imperial Airways Ltd. with regard to the difficulty which is being experienced by the Company in obtaining refund of duty on petrol and oil uplifted at Gwadar from 26th October 1934 to 31st December 1936, is also attached, and I am to request that the Political Resident in the/ -■rv&gt;' -m-pf-(zts) the Persian Qulf may he asked to take such action as is possible with a view to obtaining the refund of duties in accordance with the Civil Air Agreement.

The Marquess of Zetland notes that Lord Swinton concurs in his view regarding the desira bility of revising the financial provisions of these Agreements; but as regards the 'form which this revision should take he would invite attention to the Political Resident’s Express Letter of 27th November, 1935, No.894-S/l935, a copy of which Was forwarded to the Air Ministry under India Office printed letter of 9th December, No. P.Z.8744/35. 3. Lord Zetland agrees generally with the views expressed by Colonel Fowle; in particular he feels that the compensatory payment should bear a clode relation to the amount of duty which the Rulers actually surrender, and should not be limited to an arbitrary figure such as £250 which can hardly fail to be regarded by the Rulers as quite inadequate when the Empire Air Mail service is instituted. He is therefore inclined to favour Colonel Fowle’s first suggestion, i.e. that the sum paid annually to the Rulers should be equal to a 5 per cent, customs duty paid on the actual amount of fuel imported in that year. 4. The Secretary, Air Ministry, W.C. 2. If, however this proposal is unacceptable to the/the Air•Council on account of the unfortunate . repercussions vfhich it might have n ®f ^ „ respect of other territories in the kiddle East, Hi^ Lordship would readily consider some arrangement whereby a lump sum would be paid annually to the Rulers, which would have no overt connection with the exemption from duty, though in fact based roughly on the amount o.l fu^-j. consumed. Existing figures for the importation of fuel for the use of Imperial Airways are no doubt available to the Air Council and would serve as‘a oasis for calculating tnis sum, which would increase in proportion to the amount of fuel actually imported. For instance, a sum representing roughly the value ;of the present exemption would he appropriate until the commencement of the Empire Air Hail, and a proportionately increased sum thereafter. 5 As Colonel Fowle foresees no difficulty in bringing the existing procedure in Muscat ‘into uniformity with the procedure proposed for Bahrein and Koweit, it J} a8 b ® en . assumed in this letter that his proposals would apply to all three States. 6 His Lordship does not propose at this stage to suggest the*actual alterations to Clauses 15 and 16 of the Koweit and Bahrein and Clauses 15 and 17 of the Muscat Heads of Agreement, which it would be necessary to make in order to give effect to his proposals. But there would be no difficulty in doing this once agreement has been reacned on the form and amount of the payment which is to be made. Q 'T • 7. I am therefore to enquire whether the Air Council are prepared to reconsider the matter with a view to achieving an early settlement on the general lines suggested above, the details of which can be arranged by inter-departmental discussion. 8. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Office. I am, Sir, Tour obedient Servant, (Sd.) J.C.Walton. |P.2.8744/(35 GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

To - Secretary of State for India, London. t • - # • Repeated Government of India, New Delhi, your Political Agent, -Kuwait. Political Agent, Bahrain. Political Agent, Muscat. Subject : Civil Air Agreement. Reference correspondence ending with India Office Express Letter No. P.Z.6228/35, dated the 13th September 1935. • 2. The present sum of £.500 per annum (loosely termed 'annual rental') paid by His Majesty’s Government to the Rulers of Kuwait, Bahrain, and Muscat under the Civil Air Agreements is in consideration of the following privileges accorded by them to His Majesty’s Government:- A. (1) The use of the ground occupied by the aerodromes, (2) the exclusive right to establish and maintain aerodromes and ancillary services ( including\Y/T) , (3) to charge fees for the use of such aerodromes and such services, (4) exemption from the payment of customs duty on Wireless D/F apparatus and spare parts and on air craft and spare parts, and -D Exemption from the payment of customs duty on petrol and oil imported for the use of Imperial Airways. 3. I had pointed out in paragraph 8 of my Express Letter No. 459-S, dated the 2nd July 1935, that at the time the Civil Air Agreements were concluded it was not appreciated that the monetary value of these privileges, both in respect of A (especially A (3)) and of B, would rise so rapidly in consequence of the duplication of the air mail service at the commencement of this year and its proposed further expansion, which it is now planned should extend to a service of 5 days a week in 1937. I had therefore suggested that it should be accepted as a principle/principle that the sum of £.500 paid at present to the Rulers should he regarded only as consideration for the privileges under A, and that the Civil Air Agreements should he amended so as to provide for the payment of customs duty on all petrol and oil imported for the use of Imperial Airways. 4. It is now generally agreed that the Rulers in question have a clear case in equity for a re-examination of the effect of the existing Civil Air Agreements (vide paragraph 2 of Air Ministry letter Ro.S.32956 II/D.D.C.A., dated the 31st August 1935). The Air Ministry, however, are averse from making a concession in the form suggested by me, i.e. payment of customs duty, as it would he difficult to avoid continuing it on the same basis in connection with the Empire Air Mail Scheme, and have suggested (vide paragraph 5 of their letter quoted above) that privilege B should be compensated for by an annual payment of £.250 to each Ruler in addition to the annual peyment of £.500 for the privileges accorded under A, it being made clear that the additional payment would cover the extended frequency of services visualised in 1937 and onwards. 5. I am still of opinion that the simplest and most satisfactory way to deal with B is for customs duty to be paid on the actual amount imported. If, however, the objections to this proposal on the part of the Air Ministry are very strong, the only alternative is to fix a lump sum to be paid annually in lieu of customs duty. But in equity to the Rulers this sum should have some relation to the actual amount of duty the Ruler surrenders. I do not know, for instance, on what basis the Air Ministry suggested the sum of £.250. When the lump sum of £.500 to cover both A and B was fixed the service had only recently been transferred to the Arab route, and it was difficult to arrive at any reliable data. The service has now been running on the Arab Coast for over three years and figures of the importation of fuel for aircraft on the basis of a weekly service can doubtless be supplied by Imperial Airways. If this consumption is multiplied by five this would give a rough approximation of the fuel consumption when the service is expanded to its maximum, i.e. at five services a week, in 1937. The customs duty on fuel at Kuwait and Bahrain is 5$, that at Muscat is 10^, but in order to bring the Sultan of Muscat into line with the Rulers of Kuwait and Bahrain the duty at Muscat may be regarded as being 5^ for the purposes of assessing the annual payment under B (vide paragraph 9 of my Express Letter quoted above.) With these factors as a basis it should be possible to arrive at a lump sum which would not only be fair to the Ruler, but would be based on a principle which would be readily understood by him. The/6. The present Civil Air Agreements are due to expire in 1938. I recommend that the system proposed in my preceding paragraph should he applied as follovvs. J '^ ie financial clause of the Civil Air Agreement should be modified so that the sum of £.500 paid at present for A ana B is allocated to A only from the date on which Imperial Airways service was duplicated, i.e. 1st January of this year. Similarly, the sum that is finally fixed for B should be allocated for that purpose from the same date, the actual sum paid to be on a sliding scale corresponding with the increases of services. 7. I have for the sake of clearness considered the allocation of these sums under the separate headings of A and B. If, however, it is not desired from the point of view ol the Air Ministry to draw attention to the fact that a separate sum is actually being paid on account of B, doubtless the revised financial clause could be so worded as to include payments under both heads in one figure. 8. With reference to paragraph 7 of the Air Ministry letter quoted above. If the proposal in my paragraphs 5 and 6 above is adopted I think it would be possible to induce the Sultan of Muscat to agree to non-payment of customs duty in the first instance instead of the present system of a refund. 9. It is, of course, not intended that the payment for B proposed in my paragraphs 5 and 6 above should cover customs duty on fuel and oil imported by Imperial Airways for the use of aircraft other than their own, the question of which is treated separately under the Agreement. 10. In conclusion I must point out that the presumption in paragraph 6 of the Air Ministry letter quoted above is not likely to be borne out by facts. The Rulers in question are already becoming concerned at the present increase of the Imperial Airways Services so far as it affects the financial terms of their Agreements, and will certainly prove difficult when it comes to an agreement covering a further increase m these services unless they receive what they consider to be adequate compensation. „ „ _ Sd.

Political Agent, Kuwait. ) Subject: CIVIL AIR AGREEMENT . I enclose copy of a letter from the Political Agent,^ No.C/l62 Muscat, with translation of a letter dated the 1st June 1935 d/2/6/35 from the Sultan of Muscat, regarding ther ebate of customs duty paid under the Agreement mentioned above by the Sultan to Imperial Airways in respect of petrol and oil used by the Company at Gwadur. 2. In view of the recent expansion of Imperial Airways services and the further expansion contemplated it is desirable that this question should be examined as affecting the various Arab States in the Persian Gulf. 3. In Kuwait and Bahrain the Rulers have agreed to exempt from customs or other duties petrol and oil imported by His Majesty’s Goveirment or their Agents for the purpose of refuelling all civil aircraft, and His Majesty’s Government have agreed to pay the Ruler a sum representing the customs duty on petrol and oil retailed in the State by His Majesty’s Government or their Agents for the refuelling of aircraft other than those of Imperial Airways. This payment is in addition of course to the £500 per annum which His Majesty's Govenriment pay the Ruler as annual rental. 4. In Muscat, where a similar rental of £500 is paid to the Sultan, while all oil and petrol for the use of all Civil aircraft are subject to import duty, the Ruler has agreed to refund quarterly the duty collected on petrol and oil actually issued/issued for the use of Imperial Airways, The reason for this difference in procedure in Muscat from that adopted in Bahrain and Kuwait was that the Sultan wished to preserve to himself the form of collecting customs duty, If, 5, In all these three States therefore the concession to Imperial Airways is the same in result. Owing to the difference in procedure, however, the extent, in terms of casn, represented. 0 by the concession of customs free fuel that Imperial Airways enjoy-^ is not apparent in Kuwait or Bahrain, whereas it stands out prominently at Muscat, 6. The rate of customs duty at present levied on petrol and oil at Bahrain and Kuwait is 5Jo ad valorem. In the negotiations preceding the conclusion of the Bahrain Civil Air Agreement the Bahrain Government estimated on the basis of a weekly service (vide my telegram No. T/bl, dated the 12th March 1934) the monetary value of the concession of exemption from duty on petrol and oil used by Imperial Airways at £125 per annum. Its value on the basis of the present bi-weekly service may therefore be estimated at £250. At Kuwait, owing to the smaller number of landings the figure is certainly less. At Muscat, however, duty is levied at the rate of 10f* and it is on this account that the refund of duty by the Sultan exceeds £500. 7. It may be noted that fuel imported for the use of the Royal Air Force is exempted from customs duty at Kuwait and Muscat but pays duty at Bahrain at the rate of 3fo . 8. While under the terms of the Civil Air Agreement the payment by His Majesty's Govemment of the annual rental of £500 was inclusive and intended to cover the concession of exemption from customs duty on petrol and fuel used by Imperial Airways I do not think it was quite appreciated at the time that the monetary value of this concession would rise so rapidly. I suggest therefore that in order to prevent the Rulers of these States from feeling that they have not received sufficient consideration for the privileges accorded by them to His Majesty's Government under the Civil Air Agreement (a feeling wnich will tend to intensify as Imperial Airways services are further expanded) it whould be accepted as a principle that the annual rental of £500 should be in the nature of a net gain to the State, and that the State should be compensated for the loss incurred in granting the concession of customs free fuel to Imperial Airways. It should be remembered in this connection that the annual rental of £500 secured other valuable/valuable privileges, e.g. exemption from payment of landing fees. I am not aware of the scale of landing fees charged by foreign countries, but on the analogy of the scale laid down in Schedule 1 to the Ciyil Air Agreement, Imperial Airways, on their present bi-weekly service, would appear to be saved landing fees alone (calculated at £2 per landing) of £400 per annum at each of the places concerned. The Company therefore can hardly object to paying customs duty on fuel used by it. 9. At the same time, in view of the fact that the acceptance of the principle referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph represents an ex gratia concession on the part of His Majesty’s Government, that the permission accorded by His Majesty’s Government tot he Huler of Muscat to levy import duty at a rate higher than is a concession of a similar nature, and that it is desirable^ that there should be uniformity in this matter, I recommend that the concession suggested in my immediately preceding paragraph should be calculated on a uniform basis of a 5^ duty ad valorem irrespective of the rate of customs duty actually charged, e.g. at Muscat. 10. The term of duration of the Civil Air Agreement is four years, but if the principles mentioned in paragraphs 8 and 9 are accepted I consider that steps should be taken to give effect to them forthwith by altering clauses 15 and 16 of the Kuwait and Bahrain, and clauses 15 and 17 of the Muscat ’’Heads of Agreement” so as to provide for a compensatory payment by His Majesty's Government to the Rulers of Kuwait and Bahrain at the rate of 5^ ad valorem on all petrol and oil used by Imperial Airways, and for the refund by the Sultan of Muscat of a half instead of the whole of the 10^ duty levied by him on such petrol and oil. Alternatively, at Bahrain and at Kuwait the Agreements may be altered merely to provide for payment by Imperial Airways of duty on all petrol and oil imported by them, whether it is for their own use or not. A convenient date from which to reckon the chai ge would be 1st January 1935 about when Airways services were duplicated. 11. I am of opinion that when it is pointed out to the Sultan of Muscat that the annual rental of £500 is exclusive of the concession of exemption from payment of customs duty on/on petrol and oil used by Imperial Airways-and that he is obtaining uniform treatment with the Rulers of Bahrain and If Kuwait he will not demur at the proposed refund of half the duty levied by him. t 12. I do not recommend a similar change in the case of the Sharjah Agreement, which is on a different basis. Sd. T. C. Fowle, Lieut. -Colonel. i olitical Resident in the Persian Gulf. Sd. J. Croning.

From - Major C.E.U.Bremner, M.C.,I.A., Political Agent &amp; H.B.k’s Consul, Muscat. To - The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subject:- Civil Air Agreement. Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith the copy of a letter dated 1st June 1935 received from His Highness the Sultan of Muscat concerning the rebate of Customs duty which, under the terms of the Civil Air Agreement, he is bound to make to MIessrs. the Imperial Airways, the constituted Agents of Government. 2 # His Highness unfortunately did not mention the matter to me at Gwadur, where the figures could have been checked in situ, but in the course of a recent conversation with me, he showed me his own Arabic notes culled from the Customs records. There appears no reason to doubt these records as they were personally inspected by His Highness. 3. Assuming therefore that His Highness^ figures are correct, it would appear that whereas he receives only Rs 6,750 (£ 500 &lt;a Rs 13/8) p.a. as consideration for the use of Gwadur aerodrome, he repays Rs 7,620 on Customs rebate and is actually out of pocket Rs 870/- on the whole transaction, apart from the major loss to his revenues. 4. It would certainly appear that when the clause dealing with customs rebate on fuel and oil was being evolved no one realised the amounts involved. Certainly His Highness did not and, as I am not sufficiently acquainted with requirements of large aircraft in such matters, I was not in a position to draw attention to the fact myself. 5. As His Highness points out the service lias been doubled since the Agreement was concluded, and a further increase is rumoured, to the great detriment of the State revenues. That/6 . That the Sultan should be at a loss over the Agreement, is obviously not the intention of His Majesty’s Government. A modification therefore of clause 15 of the Heads of the Civil Air Agreement would appear essential, whereby the rebate on fuel and oils Si ould either be cancelled, or so modified, that the Sultan is not called on virtually to pay Government for the privilege of having an aerodrome in his territories. 7. In forwarding the matter for your early consideration I would strongly recommend that action on the above lines may be taken. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, Sd/- C.E.U.Bremner, Major, Political Agent &amp; H.B.M’s Consul, Muscat.P .Z.3028/25 To I^uscat, 1.6.35. s«=» I 2^ Our Friend the Political Agent &amp; H.B.&amp;'s Consul, Muscat. As you are aware that recently we have been to Gwadur and in course of investigation during our stay there we discovered that the planes of Imperial Airways use petrol and oil of which the approximate monthly average comes as follows:- Petrol, 2000 tins, duty Rs 625/- @ annas 5 per tin. * Oil, 240 gallons, duty about Rs 10/-. Row according to the agreement was concluded in October last between ourselves and our friend H.M’s Government we have to refund tne Customs duty which has been collected on the petrol consumed by the planes of that Company during the year. Since the conclusion of the above agreement the Air service of Imperial Airways has doubled and it is said that it may be even still further increase. Even as things are, the amount that we refund on oil and petrol is greater than that which we receive for/for the aerodrome and landing ground at Gwadur and Shinas respectively. Any increase of the service will mean an even greater loss to us. The Government is well aware of the financial condition of our state and we feel confident that it was never their^-. intention that we should thus he put such great loss by the conclusion of the agreement.. On the contrary we think that our friend the Government desired that we should be benefited by the agreement. We request therefore that you will bring the matter to the attention of H.M ! s Government and this matter may be revised in the light of actual facts. Your sincere Friend, Sd/~ Said bin Taimur.

With reference to India Office letter dated 1st instant (P.Z.2161/35) on the subject of the Muscat Civil Air Agreement, the Air Ministry forwarded on the 12th instant to the London Office of the Imperial Bank of India a draft for the sum of £3,190. 8. 3d. in payment of the arrears due to the Sultan of Muscat for the period from 8th June, 1929, to 24th October, 1935, inclusive. An official letter to this effect will reach your Department within the next day or two. With regard to the Bahrein Civil Air Agreement, you will remember that in March 1934 payment of £1,000 was made to the account of the Bahrein G-overnment with the Eastern Bank in London, this amount being in respect of the period from 6th October, 1932, to 5th October, 1934, inclusive. As it has been decided that payments are to be made annually in advance, further payment becomes due on 6th June next, i.e. the first anniversary of the date of signature of the Agreement, in respect of the period from 6th October, 1934, to 5th June, 1936, inclusive. I shall be glad if you will let me know whether this should be arranged by a payable order from this Department to the India Office, as was done in the case of the first £1,000 payment, or whether the Air Ministry should arrange to forward the amount direct to the Eastern Bank in London, for credit to the Bahrein Government account.

It will also be seen that the Air Council have agreed that future payments due under the Koweit, Bahrein and Muscat Civil Air Agreements should be made annually in advance, and that steps will be taken accordingly. In this connexion the Secretary of State would be glad to receive confirmation of his assumption that future payments under the Bahrein Agreement should be credited to the account of the Bahrein Government at the Eastern Bank, London. The question of the precise method of making payments under the Muscat Agreement is already under reference to you (vide India Office demi-official letter No.P.Z.66/35 of 4th January 1935). 2. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Government dated 25th of State for India to forward a copy of a letter from the Air Ministry, from which it will be seen that a total sum of J anuary 1935. of India and to the Political Agents at Koweit and Bahrein I am, &amp;c., (Sd.)

Iv]y dear Fowle, I venture to bother you on one or two points which have arisen on the 'special authorisations' recently issued in favour of Imperial Airways, etc. by the sheikh of Bahrein, copies of whicn you sent us under cover of your printed despatch NO.1170-S of 10th December. 2 . in the first place the word 'British' appears to have been omitted before the word 'nationality' in paragraph 1 in all three cases. This is no aoubt merely a clerical error. 3. secondly, paragraph &lt;1 does not lay down a time limit for the validity of 'special authorisations'. It was originally intended that there should be such a time limit (as is, I think, clear from the form of the draft 'special authorisation' prepared here after consultation with you), but I am afraid that owing to an oversight we failed to suggest what the actual period of validity should/ The Hon'ble Lt.Col. T.C. Fowle, C.B,E., The Residency, Bushire. /X11 - 2 - • should he. After informal consultation with the Air Ministry we now suggest that the period in question should he one year. This will of course mean that companies operating air services will have to apply annually through the usual channels for a renewal of their “special autnorisations'. Paragrapn 2 should therefore read 'This authorisation is limited to the period from /Insert date of issue of authorisation/ to /T inclusive and is granted...' 4. while the points referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 above are of relatively minor importance, we think, in the light of discussion with the Air Ministry, that it would he desirable to obtain amended 'authorisations' from the sheikh of Bahrein and to ensure that any 'authorisations' issued by the sheikh of Koweit and the sultan of Muscat are in similar form. If you see no objection we should be grateful if the necessary steps might be taken. Meanwhile, the Air Ministry will postpone any communication to Imperial Airways. b. The Air Ministry have also raised a point in regard to paragraph 2(iii) of the 'authorisation', which/10 - 3 - which lays down that the 'authorisation’ 1 or a certified true copy of it shall he carried hy the aircraft. I am not sure that it has ever been made clear that it was desired that the original 'authorisations” issued under this paragraph in Bahrein (ana similarly in the case of Muscat and Koweit), should he sent to the India Office for transmission via the Air Ministry to imperial Airways and in the present instance copies only have been received. The Air Ministry feel difficulty in certifying 'true copies' in the absence of the originals and we should therefore be grateful, if no objection is seen, if we might have originals of the authorisations now under discussion (with the amendments referred to in paragraph 3 above); and if in future originals might be sent home of any 'authorisations' issued in respect of the Gulf states. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe, and to Loch at Bahrein. Yours sincerely, J.G. LAIIHWAITL.fytH 5 4 INDIA OFFICE WHITEHALL, S.W.l. P.Z.7728/34. 1st January, 1935. Sir With reference to Air Ministry letter No.S.32956/D .D.C.A. of 7th April 1934 on the subject of the Koweit Civil Air Agreement, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward herewith copies of the marginally noted correspondence received from the Political Prom Resident dated 23 Nov. 1934) Resident in the Persian Gulf with enclosure. ) Printed letter v/ith enclosure ) and the Political Agent, Koweit, Council see no objection, the amount owing to the Sheikh of Koweit in respect of civil air facilities for the period 7th January 1933 to 23rd May 1934 may now be credited to the account of His Excellency at Lloyd’s Bank (Cox &amp; King’s Branch) Pall Mall, London, and that the Secretary of State may be informed when this has been done. It will be observed that the Political Resident estimates the amount in question at £688:18:0, of which £188:18:0 is in respect of the period 7th Janary 1934 to 23rd May 1934. The Secretary of State is not clear on what basis this latter figure has been reached. On a yearly basis it would appear to be too high and on a monthly- basis too low: but the difference involved is in any event very small. The Air Council will no doubt consider whether 23rd May 1934 might not more appropriately be regarded as th$ first day of the period covered by the formal agreement v/hich has nov/ been concluded.

As a point of principle the Air Ministry attach great importance to securing this, and in Mr. Bertram*s letter below tney have suggested a possible compromise.

S.32956/D.D.C.A. 1 r\ 807 j / &lt; /’ Mar , 1934 Mari Dear Laithwaite, Since our telephone conversation yesterday and the receipt of your letter to-day (your reference P.Z.1750/ 34) with reference to the proposed Civil Aviation Agreement with the Sheikh of Bahrein, I have given the question further consideration and have discussed it with Shelmerdine. 4±34/33) of 11th August, 1933, to the Government of India forwarding copies of the Heads of Agreement and of Air Navigation Regulations to be made by the Arab Sheikhs of the Persian Gulf, you will find no reference to the fre quency of the Imperial Airways services. It was thought by the Air Ministry that an inclusive annual rental of £500 for a period of 4 years would be a sufficient recompense to the Sheikh for the lease of the aerodrome and for the privileges enumerated in Article 15 of the Heads of Agree- principle that Imperial Airways should not have to pay duty on petrol which they will employ on their services, as this would create an awkward precedent in the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, there is no reason why other companies such as the french and Dutch or private pilots when permission is given for either one or the other to operate on the Arabian side ol the Persian Gulf, should not pay the duty. Resident, Persian Gulf, should be instructed to press the Sheikh to accept the £500 per annum for a period of 4 years It is of considerable importance as a matter of I would suggest, therefore, that the Political J.G.

In the event of the Sheikh not being prepared 3 °. 1 ?'f ree a flat rate of £500 per annum for 4 years, the political Resident should be asked to find out the minimum annual payment that the Sheikh would be prepared to accept, •fry increase above the £500 would require Treasury approval ^ .

Dear Bertram, with reference to our telephone conversation / corning, I enclose a copy of a telegram from the political Resident, No.T.51, which is, I think, self- explanatory. It is very satisfactory that tne Sheikh of Bahrain should have accepted the proposed civil aviation agreement ana we should welcome your view on his suggestion tnat he should retain the right to levy customs duty at the present rate of 5% on petrol and oil imported for aeroplanes, a reauction representing the average return of this duty from Octooer 1952 being made in the annual payment of £500 a year proposed to be made to the sheikh under the air agreement. and oil, particularly in view of the possibility that the 1 understand from our conversation that on a point oj. principle you regard it^of great importance to secure the entry duty free under this agreement of petrol Imperial/ P.G.L. Bertram, Esq., ChB.E., Air Ministry, Gwydyr House, Whitehall, 3. W. 1 . Air Ministry COP ofImperial Airways service to tne East may be strengthened in the future. There is also, of course, the possibility tnat the Sheikh, if he retains a completely free hand, may wish to impose a higher duty on petrol. The position as regards this is that under his treaties with us the maximum import auty which he can impose is 5%, but sanction was recently given, as a temporary measure, to the withdrawal oi this limitation, subject, however, to the proviso that the Political Resident should be informed and given an opportunity to make any observations he might consider desirable before in fact any change in tariffs was made, and tnat concurrence in the temporary modification of this limitation was suoject to the understanding that notice of four months should oe given to the Resident of any change of the nature in question. 3. The simplest course might be to press the sheikh to agree to exemption, on the understanding that if for any reason there was any increase in the loss of revenue involved to him in allowing petrol and oil for civil air purposes to enter duty free, a corresponding increase would be made in his subsidy, e.g. that in the event of Imperial Airways doubling their service and the amount of petrol/- 3 - petrol and oil imported Peing in consequence douPled, the subsidy would he raised from £500 a year to £625 a year. The Resident will probably be in Bahrein about the 23rd March on his way back from India, and if it was at all possible to clear up this point in the next few ciays, so that instructions would be awaiting him on his arrival, it might be possible for him to take the opportunity to discuss the matter personally with the Sheikh. 1 ^ sending copies of this letter to itendel at the foreign Office, and to MeClaughry.

Sir, r ^ I am directed by the Secretary of State to refer to correspondence nn the subject of the future procedure in connection with the provision of civil aerodromes etc. on the Arab air route, ending with Air Ministry Letter of 24 th July, Lo. 246985 / 33 /DD.C.A., of which copies were sent to the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf by the air mail of the 29 th July. As will be seen from the correspondence in question, there is now general agreement, in the light of discussions with Lieutenant Colonel Favle, among the interested Departments of His Majesty T s Government as to the advantage of adopting a uniform piocedure in dealing with the provision §f air facilities in the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf. Agreement has also been reached as to the general basis of such a procedure. The broad features of the procedure proposed are that the Arab rulers concerned snould be advised to mak* air navigation regulations of their own in terms drafted by His Majesty's Government; to issue a special authorisation in respect The Foreign Secretary to the 0 ^ / Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla.4 -/ of aircraft permitted to fly over and land in their territories; to lay down in tomis to be approved by Government conditions to govern the use of their aerodromes; and finally to enter into agreements with His Majesty’s Government under which His Majesty’s Government shall have exclusive rights, subject to certain conditions, to establish and maintain, as the agents of the Sheikh concerned, and subject to the terms of the air navigation regulations, etc. referred to above, an aerodrome or aerodromes and ancillary cervices within the ruler’s territory, and to charge and retain fees in respect of the use of such aerodromes and such ancillary services* As will be seen, the broad, principle underlying the proposed new procedure is that, while full control should in fact rest in the hands of i.*.is Majesty’s Government, it should., so far as possible, appear to rest with the local ruler. » I am now to enclose copies of ^ ^ navigation regulations for civil aircraft — to be made by the local ruler concerned. ( 2 ) Draft heads of agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the SheiMh (Sultan) of the principality concerned; ( 3 ) Conditions to be laid down with the approval of the Ruler to govern the use of the aerodromes; 14) Draft special authorisation, for issue by the Ruler, for aircraft to fly over and land in the territory of the local ruler concerned. The second schedule to the Third Document referred to above is still under consideration by Imperial Airways. Every exfort will be made to obtain with the minimum of delay the information required, but it is thought undesirable any longer to postpone a communication on the general question for this reason.4- I am to request that, if no objeotion is seen, the Political He silent in the Persian Gulf may now be instructed to secure the consent of the Sheiich of Bahrein, the Sheikh of Koweit and (in respect of Gwadur) the Sultan of Muscat to the adoption of a procedure of the nature suggested and to the completion of agreements in the terms of the drafts which have been agreed. Shargah is already covered by a separate agreement which will not expire until 194 ^* Minor facilities such as emergency landing grounds in States other than those referred to above can best be dealt with separately on terms to be approved in the light of the special circumstances of each case. 5« A oopy of this letter is being sent direct to the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf.

The £500 was, of course, meant to cover the special circumstances of the Shaikh of Bahrain. Dickson, however, points out that once having given £500 there, we will fi.nd it difficult to get the other Shaikhs along the Arab coast to accept less, even though their circumstances may not call for as liberal a subsidy. I concur and suggest as an alternative for Bahrain that a lump sum might be paid for customs exemption, and that the Shaikh and His Majesty’s Government shall split up the landing fees on some equitable basis. This v/ill ceitainly make easier my negotiations with the other Shaikhs. If any particul r aerodrome, other than Bahrain, is of importance enough to merit a customs exemption subsidy, this subsidy can be paid on the basis of what the Company 1 s actual imports may be, plus the same division of the landing fees as for Bahrain. If, however, at an intermediate station, such as Kuwait, it is contemplated that the imports vri.ll be very little, if any, no subsidy will be paid, and only the landing fees will be shared. If the Company intend to treat any aerodrome merely as an emergency landing ground, and little or no expense is incurred in its upkeep or management, (i.e. Airways keep no Agent there), then the full landing fees can go to the Shaikh in whose territory it is. * *P.Z.2707/34. Extract of Minute by Mr. Laithwaite dated 10th May, 1933. 4. Once official agreement has been reached as to the content of the Civil Air Regulations etc. to be made by the Sheikhs and as to t,he form of the letter referred to in the preceding paragraph, it would be for us to send the correspondence officially to the Political Resident, asking him, if he sees no objection on any point, to take the necessary action in regard to the Arab governments concerned. The Shargah Agreement, which is for a term of 11 years, will not bejaffected. Nor will the agreement between the R.A.F. and the State of Bahrein in respect of the military aerodrome in Bahrein, which will remain in force until the expiry of its term. The State, during the currency of the Air Agreement will continue to receive an annual rent of £120 in addition to the rent of £500 which • will be admissible to them under the Civil Air Regulations.227 3/33. Under Secretary of State, Procedur e in connection with t he provis i on of ''Wk civil aer odrome s, etc. , ^on ~Arab~ Air Route.. You will remember that there has been considerable discussion of the terms of the draft agreement to be negotiated between Imperial Airways and the Sheikh of Bahrein to govern the conditions of employment by Airways of the civil aerodrome at Bahrein. While the terms of this agreement, which proved to raise a large number of general points of sane importance, were still under discussion and before any decision had been reached we received a report from the Resident that Imperial Airways, who, under our agreement with the Sheikh of Shargah, are allowed to maintain a wireless station for service purposes only, had opened a public wireless station at Shargah and that a formal protest on the subject had been received from the Sheikh. In the light of this incident and of the considerations to which attention had been drawn in connection with the draft Bahrein agreement, it seemed desirable to reconsider the whole question of procedure in regard to Gulf aerodromes. The fact that Imperial Airways had made a request to be allowed to negotiate an agreement for an aerodrome with the Sheikh of Koweit and that the Sultan of Muscat was raising the question of the terms under which facilities were granted to Airways at Gwadur was an additional reason for doing so. The general line that the Department thought the modification might take is indicated in the extract from a private letter to Colonel Fowle dated 31st March. 2. A.fter informal discussion with the Foreign Office the question was discussed generally at a conference at the Air Ministry on 3rd April, the provisional proceedings of which are attached and which are self-explanatory. It will be seen that, subject to closer examination of details, the general sense of the meeting was in favour of action on the broad// \ 4n broad lines suggested by the India Office - in other words, of the application (subject to consideration of special local circumstances) of the same principles in respect of all civil aerodromes in the Arab States of the Gulf and to the concent ration of control so far as possible in the hands of the local political authorities, it being provided that the activities of Imperial Airways should be confined to managerial functions and that they should have no dealings of any sort with the Arab rulers save through the political authorities; finally, that the financial interests of the Arab rulers should not be overlooked. The effect of these proposals would be to place the real control in the hands of H.M.G., although all regulations etc. would issue in the name of the rulers. There are obvious advantages in an arrangement of this nature from the point of view of dealing with complaints or requests from foreign powers. 3. Colonel Fowle on his way hone discussed the matter briefly with Air Vice Marshal Burnett, A.O.C., Iraq, who indicated that his views on the general question were as set out in his telegram of 4th April to the Air Ministry, of which a copy is below. The Resident had previously himself suggested in his telegram of 7th April to the Government of India, on P.Z. 2028/33 below, the desirability of establishing State aerodromes in the Arab Sheikhdoms, to be kept up by the States Governments under the advice of Airways, who would also have charge of wireless, and the Government of India indicated their general agreement with his view. 4. As will be seen, there is novery substantial difference in principle between the arrangements suggested by the Political Department and discussed at the meeting at the Air Ministry on 3rd April and those proposed by the Resident. The A.O.C.’s proposals on the other hand go rather farther. The question generally was discussed yesterday at/at an informal meeting with the Foreign Office, at which Colonel Fowle was present. The Foreign Office were on the whole disposed to think that from the point of view of international relations the balance of advantage lay with arrangements of the nature suggested by the Resident or by the India Office rather than with those suggested by Air Vice-Marshal Burnett, and it was generally agreed that this line should be taken on the resumption of discussion with the Air Ministry next week.

Mr.Hendel Mr .Warner • Foreign Office Colonel S helmerdine aaid that the meeting had originally been arranged to discuss a proposed draft agreement between Imperial Airways Ltd., and the Bahrein Government for the operation of air services to and from Bahrein; but he understood that the India Office wished now to bring forward a proposal which, if adopted, would entail extensive alteration in the draft agreement drawn up by the Company, or possibly a different form of agreement altogether. Ir.Laithwaite said that the India Office hadhad under consideration the whole of the civil aviation arraignments in the Persian Gulf area and were desirous of establishing them on a more satisfactory basis. The India Office were inclined to alter thqmethod of handling this question. Their proposal was to draw up standing regulations applicable in the case of all the sheikhs and the Sultan of Muscat. These regulations would actually be made by the rulers themselves on the advice an’d with the concurrence of His Majesty’s Government. The proposals as outlined by the India Offioe are in Appendices A, B and C. Thef// The idea is that after the issue of standing regulations (Appendix A) the ruler would lease a specified aerodrome to Imperial Airways Ltd, as Managers (Appendix B) and also enter into a financial agreement with the Company on the lines of Appendix C. The India Office looked to the Air Ministry for advice, in particular in regard to the charges which could he levied for services (Appendix B(b)). Mr. Laithwaite said that it would he possible to prescribe that other companies’ aircraft could not go outside Imperial Airways for the specified aerodrome services. Imperial Airways would retain service fees but not landing fees. Landing fees would be handed over to the ruler. The adoption of an arrangement whereby the rulers would make the regulations and all correspondence would be conducted through political channels would, Mr. Laithwaite said, strengthen the position of the India Office when dealing with any complaint from foreigners which might arise. The India Office were anxious that private flyers should be prohibited from flying the Arab Coast route; under the India Office proposals private flights would be prohibited under regulations issued by the rulers themselves. Hr. Rende 1 said that his first reaction to the proposal was to support it strongly. The Air Ministry representatives also gave it general support. Colonel shelmerdine, however, expressed doubt as to whether complete uniformity could be Attained and pointed out that private flyers at pfesent used the aerodrome at Gwadur. Group Captain Peirse raised the question of making an exception to the prohibition of private flying in favour of private aircraft owned by the/41 ^ the oil companies snd also in the case of pearling flights at Bahrein. It was agreed that a loophole should he left which would admit of special permission being given by the rulers in respect of oil companies’ and pearling flights, and also that private flyers should be allowed to continue to use the aerodrome at Gwadur, but that apart from this a tight hand should be kept on 'exceptions' 1 . L!r. Rend el said that it was quite likely that the French and the Butch would have to abandon the Persian route and this, together with the fact that Imperial Airways and the Royal Air Force fly down the Arab coast might tempt private flyers to do the same. It was recognised that while private flyers are not at present likely to want to fly along the Arab coast route to India in preference to the Persian route, the facilities on the latter route may deteriorate and the position became reversed; but it was decided to defer consideration of this point until it became of practical importance. o regards the I.C.a.N. aspect of the matter, the Foreign Office felt that the position wa s anomalous and they did not want the question raised. It was not desirable that the local rulers should adhere to the Convention- but neither was it desirable they should act so in conflict with its principles as to provoke a protest from the French and Dutch, and so place His Majesty’s Government in an invidious position in having to defend their action. The India Office shared this view. It/fn&gt; It waa agreed that the French and Dutch could use Bahrein subject to the approval of the sheikh and can continue to use Gwadar as at present, subject to the formal consent of the Sultan of unseat. bo far, tne use of Sharjah had been refused to the French on the pretext of the lack of operating experience there (the Dutch had not actually asked for permission although they no doubt will do so); but the Foreign Office felt that oermission could not be refused indefinitely and that by refusing permission we were merely trying to resist tin inevitable. The existing agreement only covered use by Imperial Airways. T r. Ttendel said that an answer to the Itatch application was already overdue. The Foreign Offi^G will draft a reply to the Dutch and refer it to the Depart, ents concerned for concurrence* (Veinot. Peirse agreed with the Foreign Office view in regard to Sharjah but pointed out that the policy of excluding foreigners from the Trucial coast had been adopted on defence grounds mainly at the instigation of the Admiralty. Mr. Rendel said that the route could only be thrown ooen to all if basic policy were altered and foreigners generally, therefore, J.iust in the meantime be excluded, though this exclusion need not extend to regular French and Dutch air services. group laptain Peirce also mentioned that the Arab Coast route was primarily a strategic route and he thought strategic considerations should receive precedence if such considerations clashed with civil aviation interests (for example the erection of civil buildings and W/T)» i r. Laithwaite agreed and said that nothing would be Resident in the Persian Gulf who would, when necessary, consult the A.O.C. installed without the knowledge and consent of the PoliticalMr. Laithwaite renorted that Imperial Airways were acceding public telegrams for transmission : rom the wireless station (supplied by the Air Ministry) at fnarjah# The sheikh had no objection to this, in orinciole, but wanted a formal agreement on the subject with His Majesty’s Croveranent. On the suggestion of Mr. -endel it was agreed to refer the whole question of W/T in the Persian Gfull to the Imperial Communications Committee. The Air inistry (Signals Branch) will prepare the reference. Mr.Laithwaite agreed that in the meantime the acceptance of private telegrams at Sharjah need not be discontinued. An endeavour should, however, be made to expedite the decis ion of the I.C.C. He suggested that official messages and the Sheikh’s private messages (as a matter of courtesy) should be accepted for transmission free of charge; but Flight Lieut. Duncan pointed out t at if Imperial and International Communications Ltd. were to operate these stations on this basis, they would get very little revenue and would in effect haveto be subsidized by the Air Ministry. It was agreed that the Air Ministry should give careful consideration to the framing of suitable standing regulations on the basis of the India Office proposals preparatory to further discussion with the India Office. Imperial Airways Ltd. will be communicated with in regard to the preparation of a schedule of service fees (Aopendix B (b)). Mr. Bertram emphasised the importance in his view of the regulations being to some extent provisional and not irrevocable. This was agreed. Mr. Bertram also thought that the general regulations should be drawn up in separate groups. Mr. Laithwaite saw no oVjection to this.10/ 9 m mm a- for Insert ion In Standing Hegmations . 1. 2 . 3. 4. 5. 6 . 7. 3, 9. Landing grounds to which applicable. No private flyers - Penalties.

Yours sincerely. J.G. LAITHWAITE.P.2. 2030/33. Note on conclusions of a meeting held in Colonel bhelmerdine T s room at the Air Ministry on 3rd April to consider questions in connection with the Banrai: Air Agreement and the organisation of the Civil Air Route on the Arab side of the Persian Culf. The general conclusions reached were as follows:- (a) General proce^iire in connection with the, organisation of the llivil .ur ..oute and the use of aerodromes, eti;.. by British ana foreign aircraft . That it was in principle desirable to standardise the arrangements for the use etc. of civil aerodromes in the Arab States of the Persian G-ulf and that this could probably best be done by drawing up a standard set of regulations, in practically identical terms, to be made by the Sheikh of Koweit, the Sheikh of Bahrain and the Sultan of Muscat. Such regulations, in addition to dealing with the question of unauthorised private flights, would cover so far as possible all political points and would deal with matters such as police, immigration, passports, quarantine, customs, compliance with air and other regulations, inspection by State authorities, etc. Subject to such general regulations it would be desirable that the actual management of such aerodromes should be in the hands of Imperial Airways, the general conditions subject to which they might be used, whether by Airways, or by foreign aircraft, being prescribed in a licence to be affixed publicly in the aerodromes and to specify the services in respect of which charges might be made to aircraft not belonging to Airways using the aerodromes, the conditions on which the aerodrome might be used by such aircraft, the scale of charges for aircraft other than those belonging to Airways (viz. a landing charge, which would be payable to the Ruler, and other charges which/which would be payable to Airways, in respect of facilities specially provided by the r !i and as a contribution to overhead expenses), and the use of wireless for air purposes. The financial, etc. arrangements between Imperial Airways and the local ruler would be set out in a third document, which would cover the rent to be paid for the aerodrome, the composition, if any, payable in respect of customs charges on spare parts, etc. imported for the use of Airways, the period of the lease, and would make it clear that correspondence with 'Che ruler was to be carried on exclusively through the political authorities and that the Political Resident would be accepted as arbitrator in the event of any dispute. It was agreed that the terms of the regulations, licence and agreement would need careful consideration and it was generally recognised that some minor variations might be necessary in the terms of the regulations to meet the special circumstances of the different States. The Air Ministry undertook to go into the matter further and to produce a preliminary statement of their views before Easter, with a view to further discussion on Wednesday, 19th April. (b) Bahrain -Agreement . It was agreed that if action on the lines provisionally accepted in (a) above proved possible, the draft Bahrain Air Agreement would have to be recast to conform with the new procedure and that it would not be profitable to consider it in detail at the'present stage. (c) Lowe d t A gr.s s rqe a t. The meeting agreed that it was undesirable in principle that Airways should negotiate an agreement direct with the Sheikh of Koweit. The question of a Koweit agreement and of its terms might be deferred until a decision had been reached on the procedure described in (a) above. (d)/&gt; (d) Shargah wireless . This incident was discussed. It was agreed: (i) that the desirability of concentrating all wireless in the Gulf in the hands of the Comraunications Company should be considered; (ii) that an immediate reference should be made to the Communications oub Committee of the C*I.D. on the subject of the Shargah wireless station; that pending such a reference, which would be prepared by the Air Ministry, no answer should be sent to the representations made by the Gheikh, and that despite the objections thereto the public station should be permitted to continue to function. (e) Eacilities for the .jutch at Bahrain and Gwadur . It was agreed that the Resident should be asked to approach the Rheikh of Bahrain and the Bultan of Muscat with a view to obtaining the requisite facilities and that the Foreign Office should simultaneously send a further interim reply to the uutch to this effect, warning them at the same time that the imposition of landing fees by the Arab rulers concerned was understood to be under consideration and that neither on this point nor on the question of the financial terms on which facilities could be provided at the aerodromes in question could a final statement yet be made. (f) Miscellaneous . (i) Private flyers. The desirability of a general prohibition by the local rulers of all save specially authorised private flights, and of imposing sanctions for failure to comply with such prohibition, was generally accepted. It was agreea that the matter could best be dealt with in the general regulations referred to in (a); (ii) it was agreed in principle that having regardto the strategic importance of the Arab air route, strategic must take priority over civil requirements in all cases where the same landing ground was common to the civil and the strategic air routes.Extract from Private and Personal Air Mail Letter from Mr* Laithroraite to Colonel Fowls, dated 31st March 1933* We have ju t had your despatch about the Shargah wireless station* I need not say that neither we nor the Foreign Office have ever been consulted by the Air Ministry about the proposal to establish a public wireless station there and we entirely share your view* about it* Arising out of the Bahrain Air Agreement and the renewed request for facilities at frmdur and Bahrain by the Dutch, etc*, we are now inclined, particularly in view of the wireless station incident at Shargah, to wonder whether we should not do better to adopt a rather different procedure as regards civil air arrangements in the Gulf generally* We are, of course, anxious to help Imperial Airways as much as we can and to eecure that the air route shall run without any hitch or disturbance* On the other hand, we have in the first place to look after the interests of our various sheikhlyfclients in the Gulf, and secondly to endeavour to secure that no complications arise with any foreign government consequent on any incident between their air lines and Imperial Airmys in respect of the use of aerodromes etc* Finally, our policy being to keep this area closed except to Airways and the one or two regular foreign lines who may bejgranted permission to use the same facilities and to exclude the private flyer so much as possible, we shall have to make provision to deal with that matter* For there is probably little doubt that the unauthorised private flyer will before very long try to fly down the Arab coast and jump facilities in the various places/places at which they exist and this we want to be in a position to deal with* In these circumstances what we are rather thinking of is the drawing up of sealed pattern regulations to ft)vem the landing of aircraft of any kind in Koweit, Bahrain and Muscat, these regulations to be made by the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrain and by the Sultan of Muscat, to be quite general in character and, so far as possible, to cover all the political aspects. they would include a prohibition against the landing in the States in question of private flyers and prescribe the penalty (shall we say confiscation of aircraft?) to be imposed on aircraft so landing. In addition, such regulations could cover such matters as customs, passports, quarantine, police, etc. Within the terms of such regulations it would be possible to to appoint Airways (subject, of course,/a fee to the Ruler in respect of the use of the aerodrome and a composition possibly of the nature suggested by you in respect of customs and other dues) as managers of the aerodrome on behalf of the Sheikh, the understanding being that Airways would have no freedom whatev -r to take any steps outside the strict terms ofjjtheir licence save with the approval of the local ruler, obtained through the Political Agent or the Political Resident as the case might be. If something on these lines (we propose to discuss it with the Air Ministry next Monday) should prove possible, it would in practice entirely alter the character of the agreement to be negotiated with Airways in respect of Bahrain etc. The agreement could be very much shorter and would, of course, be rather different in scope f Secondly, it would, we think, reduce the risk of incidents such as the/the Sh&amp;rgah wireless incident* Thirdly (and to this we in the India Office attach considerable importance) it would keep Airways out of politics and would ensure that the real responsibility lay between the political authorities in the Gulf and the local rulers* We should be much interested to hear what you think of action rather on these lines when you come heme. I ought perhaps to add that it would of course be open to Airways under such a procedure to make charges on the Dutch etc.for the use of facilities such as oil, petrol, water, air, mechanics 1 services, etc* The landing fees to be paid by foreign aircraft using the aerodromes and their disposal could, if necessary, be prescribed in the general regulations and I am not sure that this would not be the better course. In this connection I have been trying to find out what exactly the present arrangements are at Gwadur in respect of payment to the Sultan for the use of his aerodrome there. All the air arrangements in the Gulf grew up in rather a casual way and the present seems a good opportunity to try and get them straightened out and to apply the same principles in respect of all stations. If, as the Air Ministry understand is the case, Airways pay no rent in respect of Gwadur aerodrome to the Sultan, I am inclined to think that we might very well alter this and subject them to rather the same type of conditions as we contemplate in respect of the aerodrome at Bahrain.Tel.

With regard to the 3rd oaraprraoh of Secretary of State’s comment on Article 16* Clauae fi of Ihc Lease between the Bahrain Government and Imperial. Airways for the use by the latter of Manamah aerodrome, made in May 1930 (a copy of this document does not appear +o have been sent from here either to the Govern ment of India or to the India Office. I enclose a copy herewith.), reads as follows: *The Hoyal Air l^brce af*ree that the aerodrome will he available for use by Imperial Airways. The question of payment by Imperial Airways for use of the aerodrome, if any, shall be a matter of arrangement direct between the Air Ministry and Imperial Airwavs, end ahill be no concern of ♦be Sta*e of Bahrain. Permission fbr the use of the aerodrome by machines othorttmn those of Imperial Airways shall be a matter of mutual agreement between the Boyal Air b'orce and the f haikh'. This stipulation was put in the agreement (vide the following quotation from a letter Ho. 348 of 18th Aumist 1989 from the financial Adviser to the Government of Bahrain to ♦he °olitieal Apert, Bahrain) at the ^jod-kh’s own request: ’’Ghaikh H^tnad would like a clause included in the lease, if it is approved, stipulating that the aerodrome shall be used, freely, by the Imperial Airways and by any machines which he permits to come here, and also that the ground is leased merely an aerodrome and does not include any rights- 3 - c±!3/ building, to mine dr to cult Irate the ground*. 5 # It w&gt;uld appear, therefore, that if Imperial Airway© decide to uae KanamaJh aerodrome arri not Muharraq, the 'Bahrain rJovemment are debarred from de- mandinpr from them either rent or landing fees* By the ©ame clause control of the l*anamh ground is iraolied a© vested in the ^oyal Air ^orce. As far as 1 am aware Imperial Airways have not definitely made up 4 hr ir minds as to tfiich aerodrome to use, l*he Manamah one is somewhat more conveniently situated, since it is on Man amah island that the Bahrain Government has its headquarte rs, the °olitical Arent hi© a/rency, and the Agents of the Imperial Airways Limited —Messrs l‘he Mesopotamia-^brsia Corporation Limited— their offices. On the other hand the Muharraq aerodrome situated on the island of that name, some two miles ^rom Manamah, is a better ground for the 3 p rge type of aircraft used by Imrrr ia 1 Ai rways. It might clarify the situation if Imperial Airways would mate a definite decision as to which aerodrome —Manamah or Muharraq — they wish to use. I am sending a copy of this letter to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India.

The question of providing for keeping the landing ground for aeroplanes clear will be taken up when the time comes to discuss with the Bahrein Petroleum Company the terms of the mining lease which they will require before they can engage on active development of the oil resources of Bahrein, and in the meantime it does not appear immediately necessary to take any further steps to safeguard Muharraq Island. ^ c °py tkis letter is being sent to the India Office.

The Secretary Air Ministry.-f (E 506/11/91) 1 } FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 1 A 0\&gt; kith March, 1933. •• **? v / u. ;) IMPORTANT O P.Z. 231/33 of the 25th January, enclosing a cony of the draft agreement between Imperial Airways and the Sheikh of Bahrein, I send you, as arranged by telephone, a written statement of our views, in order that, as you have suggested, the matter may be discussed at an Interdepartmental meeting. We agree with you that it will be necessary as a first step to have such a meeting without a representative of Imperial Airways. 2. In the first place, there is one general point which interests us, namely that the agreement should, be in line with the International Air Navigation Convention of 1919 and should allow no undue discrimination against foreign aircraft. This raises the general question of the position of Bahrein in respect of international conventions. At the moment we are sitting on the fence J.G-. Laithwaite, Esq onon the one hand, Bahrein is not a British protected State, in the sense that the Malay States, for instance, are; so the Air Convention cannot he said to apply already to Bahrein under Article 40. On the other hand, it seems doubtful whether we should he prepared to regard Bahrein as sufficiently independent to accede to the Convention as a separate State under Article 41. (For convenience of reference, I attach copies of this and other texts referred to in this letter). I understand that the India Office consider that the present rather vague position of the Persian G-ulf Sheikhdoms in respect of international conventions should he maintained, if possible, and though I am personally very doubtful as to how long it will he possible to go on without defining the situation more clearly, we do not want - at any rate for the moment - to dissent from this view. But obviously it will only increase the risk of the Dutch or others raising the question of Bahrein’s being or becoming a party to the Air Convention if Bahrein makes an agreement with Imperial AirwaysAirways which is not in harmony with its provisions* 3* On the same general ground we feel strongly that it would he unwise to allow Bahrein to make any agreement with Imperial Airways which involved undue discrimination against foreign aircraft. In addition, we know that the Dutch contemplate using Bahrein for their air services, and we have already told the Netherlands Minister (in paragraph 8 of our note of the 31st August, 1932: copies to India Office and Air Ministry in Foreign Office letter E 4359/3307/65 of the 2nd September) that we anticipate that Bahrein will have no objection to Netherlands aircraft enjoying there facilities similar to those granted to Imperial Airways* We think therefore that it is necessary to consider whether the draft agreement with Imperial Airways - more particularly Article 15 and your suggestions regarding Article 16 - squares with the relevant provisions - e.g. Article 24 - of the International Air Convention, and, if not, what changes are necessary* We also think that both on general grounds and in view of what we have said to the Dutch, it would be a mistake to allow the Bahrein GovernmentGovernment to give Imperial Airways a specially privileged position, at&gt;out which the Dutch or other foreign companies could subsequently complain with some show of justification, even if it were possible for the Bahrein Government to do so without running directly counter to the Ain Convention. 4. There are also one or two points which we should like to raise on the draft itself. They are as follows: Preamble : We think that it would be unnecessary and unwise to insert, as you suggest, the words ,f with ’•the approval of His Majesty’s Government”. To do so might lay us open to the accusation of interference with the independence of Bahrein to an extent not warranted by the treaty position; and the addition of these words does not in itself confer on us any power of control, which none the less can in practice be satisfactorily exercised through the Political Resident. A rticle 3 : It is not clear whether the choice of aerodromes is to be left to the Company throughout the duration of the agreement or whether at some moment they are to take a definite decision between the two. The wordingwording of Article 3 seems to support the first theory, the opening words of Article 15 rather support the second. Article 4 and other s: ,f Aircraft’ f : it is not clear throughout whether reference is 'being made to aircraft of the Company or (in view of the Company being managers of the aerodrome) to all aircraft. A rticle 6: We concur in the amendment proposed in your covering letter. Articles 8 and 9: Certain provisions with regard to the exemption of aircraft in transit etc., from customs duties have been inserted in the bilateral air navigation conventions which we have concluded with other countries. At the same time, it is worth noting that the Government of the Sudan, in allowing Italian air transport companies to use their territories for air services at the recommendation of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom under the provisions of the Anglo-Italian Convention of May 16, 1931, respecting Air Transport Services, only did so with the reservation that Italian companiescompanies would not 'be entitled in the Sudan to customs exemption for spare parts, fuel and oil carried and used on their aircraft, even though this reservation was qualified hy a statement that Italian companies would not receive less favourable treatment as to customs duties than British or Egyptian companies. The Sudan Government objected, I believe, to customs exemptions on much the same ground as that now advanced by Bahrein, and we agree with the India Office that it would be reasonable that the customs concession should be limited to the petrol and oil imported for refuelling. Art icl es 12 an d 13 : We concur in the India Office views. Ar tic le 15: (a) line 2: f, the aerodromes that may 'be used by civil aircraft'. The general position with regard to aerodromes is not clear (see my remarks under Article 3 above) and, as the agreement is to last for eleven years, this phrase might with advantage be made more precise. At present it might apparently include the Royal Air Force aerodrome.The remainder of the Article and the various proposals regarding Article 16 require examination in the light of the views expressed in paragraphs 2 and 3 above• 5.

Dear Laithwaite You will no doubt remember my informing you. early in January, that we had had an informal conversation with Colonel Burchall, Assistant General Manager of Imperial Airways Limited, with reference to the proposed agreement between the Bahrein Government and Imperial Airways Limited. At that meeting I asked Colonel Burchall to send me in writing the observations of his Company on certain articles in the agreement. I enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which I have only just received. Since the meeting, Walton’s letter of £4th Jan., P.Z. 231/33 with enclosures/as reached us. to be taken, and I would suggest a meeting here or at the India Office, to which Colonel Burchall should be invited with the object of attempting to reach an agreement on the draft from our points of view. It now becomes a question as to the next step Will you please let me know what you feel about Yours sincerely J Laithwaite, Esq., India Office,4^ COPY. iMPi^xiIAL AIHWaYo LIMITED. HB/PS/19E1. 14th February, 1933 Dear Bertram, I very much regret that I have not been able to write to you earlier on the subject of our proposed Agreement with the Bahrein (Government, which was discussed at our meeting at Gwydyr House on the 2nd January. In regard to Article 3 of the draft agreement, there is no objection to the amendment as suggested, but since there appears to be some possibility of another aerodrome site proving better than the existing two, might we leave the article to read:- 'Every aircraft of the Company arriving in Bahrein from abroad shall land either at the Royal Air Force aerodrome at Manamah or on the aerodrome at Muharraq or elsewhere as agreed” The question of whether the aerodrome at Muharraq should be leased to Imperial Airways or not, can perhaps be entirely omitted from this article, as it does not, in fact, affect the agreement. In regard to Article 6 (c^ we have no objection whatever to employees of the Company who are not disembarking at Bahrein being required to produce to the passport control officer valid international passports. They will all be in possession of valid passports, which are needed for various foreign countries. At the same time, it would be very desirable from our point of view if this requirement were not specified in the agreement, as we are anxious that the crews of internationally operating air companies shall be treated just as the crews of the mercantile Marine, who, of course, are not required to produce passports when they are merely calling at a port. We believe that in time this practice will become universal and we are anxious to avoid making its adoption difficult by the inclusion of such paragraphs in agreements which are now being- entered into. I am wondering however if the suggested paragraph should not read : 'Employees of the Company disembarking at Bahrein' instead of not disembarking at Bahrein - 'Will also be required to carry valid international passportsV Articles 8 and 9 . These articles are, of course, the crux of the whole matter with the Bahrein Government, and I think, to get the matter clear, we ought to divide our claim for exemption from customs duty into the three classes of goods which come into the question:-2 - (a) fuel and. lubricant, which ia exactly equivalent to the bunker fuel of steamships. (b) ^pare parts sent to Bahrein for incorporation in a defective aeroplane, or parts held in stock at Bahrein for the same purpose. (c) Other material, vehicles, etc. imported into Bahrein for use by the service. I think it should be made clear, if it is not already clear to the Government of Bahrein, that it is practically a universal custom to treat aircraft in respect of its fuel and oil on the same footing as steamships for their coal or fuel oil; that is to say that the fuel consumed in coming from or going to a place abroad is exempt from customs import duty. Every journey by an aircraft to or from Bahrein will be a journey to or from a place abroad, and therefore under international custom should be exempt from fuel and oil duty. It is true that in some foreign countries, the fuel consumed in flight between two places in the same territory is assessable to duty, and there is something to be said on this score. But this cannot apply in any way to Bahrein, and we feel that exemption from duty on bunker fuel is the principle for which we must press to the last resort The second group of articles - parts for repair of our aircraft - comes very largely within the same general scope. It is common for foreign countries, that cannot be said to be in close treaty with Great Britain and that are not bound to Great Britain by any particular ties, to grant this exemption, subject, of course, uo suitable safeguards to meet the respective regimes, and we feel that if Bahrein, a country in such close association with Great Britain, should impose this duty, how could we argue against it being imposed by Prance, Italy, Greece, Egypt, Palestine, Trans-jordan, Iraq, Baluchistan and India? To Bahrein it will probably be a comparatively trivial amount that would be collected on this score, but it would involve an enormous amount of unnecessary accounting work. Might I cite as an example, an engine developing a defect during its flight between Bhargah and Bahrein, and it is thought desirable to send to Bahrein a new engine to take the place of the old one, which would be immediately shipped to Basra for repair. The value of the new engine we may assess at f1,800. 5^6 duty would be levied on this figure, i.e., we should have to pay £90. Within a few days the engine would be fitted and the Government of Bahrein on the production of satisfactory proof that it had been incorporated in an aircraft, would refund to us £54 of the £90, i.e., because we have! been so unfortunate as to require to change an engine at Bahrein, it will have cost us £36. plus all the bother through paying £90 in the first place, proving the incorporation of the engine in the aeroplane, and obtaining a refund of £54. With regard to the other group of articles, for example, motor cars, motor boats and fuel used for them, food, furniture, household require ments for our resthouse, etc., etc. While we do not think it in any way unreasonable that we should ask for exemption from duty on these goods, we appreciate that they do not come into the same category as the first two classes.c' 4--n We nevertheless feel that refusal to agree to freedom duty on these goods shows a very definite change 01 front on the part of the Government of Bahrein, who in 1929 offered us a subsidy of 2b0 icupees a trip if we could see our way to operate a service to Bahrein. At the time this subsidy was offered to us, it presumably ^was not offered with the object of the subsidy being recovered from us by way of import duties, etc., and it seems, there!ore, that a service that Bahrein valued at 250 Rupees a trip in 1929 has now not oniy become of no value to them, but is to be made to pay lees not then contemplated. 1 feel sure that the Government of Bahrein have not appreciated the difference between the three classes of goods for which we have applied for exemption from customs duty, and I would be grateful if you could represent this matter to them somewhat on the lines of the above. Article 15. 1 note that it is suggested that the simplest way to deal with this article is (a) for the Company to lease the ground from the Bahrein Government, and on principle we have no objection at all to this. 1 gather that the Royal Air Force pay £120 per annum for the lease of their aerodrome at Manamah and that the lease permits the aircraft of my Company to land on the ground that they have so leased. It would appear to me, therefore, thax&lt; no lurther lease can or need be granted for the Manamah Aerodrome, and that if the Company taka the lease of the Muharraq. Aerodrome, the noyal Air i^orce will terminate their lease of Manamah Aerodrome and will then save the rent now paid which can be transferred to pay for the Muharraq Aerodrome. (b; 'Landing fees of foreign air companies to be paid to the Bahrein Government through Imperial Airways' : This, I assume, means either that the Bahrein Government lease the aerodrome to us and then still continue to draw another rent for the same ground from any foreign air companies that use it, or that the Bahrein Government expect to draw landing fees irom the loreign air companies in addition to the landing fees that we, as lessees of the ground, would naturally charge anbody using anything for which we have paid. (c) 'The matter of fuel, oil, etc': I gather is a question the Bahrein Government are agreeable to leave to Imperial Airways if that Company takas the lease of an aerodrome., I gather, however, from the notes which were discussed at our meeting, that it was implied that if the Company had the sole to supply fuel, oil, food, transport/, etc., uhen the government of Bahrein would be giving into the hands of Imperial Airways the control of the use of the aerodrome. I would point out that in our latest proposal we undertook not to employ this right in an exorbitant way and only with a view to recouping ourselves in part for the expenditure we shall incur at the aerodrome. (d; I note with pleasure that the Government of Bahrein consider that, leadng the management of the aerodrome in the hands of Imperial Airways will be the most convenient arrangement. Article 16: It is noted that the Government of Bahrein are unable to offer us landing rights free of charge in Bahrein and that they propose to lease the aerodrome to us as already mentioned. Article 19: The question of dispute and arbitration has /alreadyalready been discussed between us verbally, and 1 do not think i need add anything to this matter at the present time. I understand that as soon as you have had time to consider these views you will be calling another meeting ol the inteiestea people, which 1 shall be happy to attend. I should like to add that I have heard from our Manager in Cairo, who has recently visited Bahrein, and 1 gather irom him that all the details of the payments the Government are making to the Sheikh of Shargah are known to the sheikh of Bahrein, and I have no doubt that the new attitude is a reflection of the Shargah affair. The Sheikh of Bahrein no doubt wonders why he, being friendly, should give for nothing something for which the Sheikh of Shargah, who is less friendly, should receive handsome payment. You will note that in 19S9 not only did the Sheikh plead with us to run an air service to Bahrein, but actually ofiered to pay us a subsidy of 250 Rupees a trip. 1 venture to suggest, therefore, that the whole difficulty arising in connection with the Agreement may be due to the determination of the Sheikh to obtain some financial benefit as has been obtained by the Sheikh of Shargah. It probably does not matter whether the amount is paid by way of customs import duty, landing fees or grant, lossibly all the difficulty would be solved by the payment by the Air ministry of a grant to the Sheikh, and our Cairo Manager seems to have gained the impression fhat an annual grant of £250 would secure the Muharraq aerodrome or other land and free us from fuel duty and duty on spare parts, etc. possibly it would be better for the Political Resident to approach the matter in this way rather than to leave the Company to haggle over fuel and oil and spare parts’ duty and rental of the aerodrome, and it would obviously leave the British Government in a much stronger position in regard to the use of the aerodrome by foreign air companies. In case you may suggest that this is passing the burden of expense from us to the Government, I would like to urge that, if owing to the payments that are being made to the Sheikh of Shargah or other cause, our service is put to unexpected expenditure, through having to use Bahrein, that charge would be recoverable from the Air ministry under the general arrangement in re &amp; ard to the transfer from the Persian to the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf.

She had four passengers, but was loaded to full capacity with cargo and spare parts. Her arrival caused but little excitement, out after she was safely berthed in the barbed wire enclosure, the Sheikh and a crowd of people from the town came to admire her. Captain Horsey, pilot of the machine, reported that he had had an excellent trip and had no diificulty at all in landing. The arrangements for berthing the machine and refuelling worked smoothly, and the station guards seem to know what is required of them. 14* The Sheikh of Sharjah has complained that he is losing money on account of the fact that work on the rest house is proceeding so slowly. Hsi complaint was referred to the Political Resident. Apparently work is held up because cement is not available. Certain temporary buildings have been completed or are nearing completion but the rest house itself has not been started. The foundations have oeen dug out and cemented and adequate defem e posts have oeen erected, besides barbed wire enclosures for aircraft and rest house. 15- The passengers are being housed for the present in tents, which are well furnished and are comfortable hr. white ol Shaioah aerodrome is in temporary charge of the company t s iri erests and no one could complain of the arrangements made by him under the circumstances. 16.

A text of the Agreement embodying alterations agreed to date by the local authorities with Imperial Airways (compiled from the various despatches on the subject) is attached. We have not yet had the comments of the Government of India. But as the Air Ministry are in close touch and in informal discussion on this subject with Imperial Airways, it seems desirable to reach an early decision, and we might at once communicate to the Air Ministry (subject to any further comments which may come in from India) our provisional views on the Contract as it stanas. 2. Broadly speaking, it is, I think, not unsatisfactory, but the following points seem to call for notice. Preamble . 3ome reference to tne approval of H.M.G. might be inserted here. It is true that we ! shall, in fact, exercise a decisive influence on the | terms of the Agreement, but on general grounds it may be well to metke It clear that H.M.G. regard their approval as necessary in any instrument of this | nature, and that we do not regard the Sheikh as an ! entirely free agent. article 3 . See on this paragraph 2 of Captain ! Prior’s letter of 13th October on P.Z.6906/32. The | alternative wording suggested by the State and ; supported by the Political Resident seems preferable. 4-0(10 3 32 Article 6 / /HArticle ,. 6 &lt;ej See on this paragraph 3 of Colonel Fowle’s despatch No. 788-3 of 18th October (P.2.6906/ 32) and paragraph 2 of his despatch 821-3 of 29th October, we may agree to the addition of the following sentence suggested by the Political Residen|b: 'Employees of the Company not disembarking at Bahrein 1 ^ (rch**/ r~K v -^ will also tie required to carry valid national passports and to produce them to the Passport Control h&gt; «X^vkX.

It will he seen that the State are not prepared to grant any concession in respect of customs duties save on goods in transit. The Resident supports their view and we may accept it. As Captain Prior remarks, ”the delicate financial condition of the State” is well-known to while any concession might make it more difficult to deal with demands of a similar nature from other interests affected, toreover, while some benefit may no doubt accrue to the Islands as the result of the operation of the air service, it is essehtial to the operation of that service that it should enjoy facilities at Bahrein, and the State cannot be blamed if it takes reasonable advantage of this. article IQ. The State are prepared to agree to the exemption of goods in transit through Bahrein In the Company’s aircraft and the Resident agrees, as he remarks, there is probably not much in the argument that the concession might weaken the position of the State with regard to dues charged on transit cargo brought by ships, and we might accept. The opening words of the draft may need alteration consequent on any revision, or the omission, of V;&lt;&gt; articles/Minute Paper. Articles 8 and 9 (see note on these Articles). Article 12 . Wireless* Prom paragraph 6 of Captain Prior's letter of 13th October it will he seen that the State have no objection so long as the wireless does not interfere with the existing service j by Imperial and International Communications. The Resident has no comment. It is for consideration whether some reference to tne proviso should not be made in the Agreement? such a proviso, if inserted, would presumably cover the stations referred to in Article 13. The Company will presumably finance their: own wireless and no question of payment for messages (or, presumably, for a licence) will arise. Article 15. (a) while, as Colonel Powle points out, the question does not directly arise on the present Agreement, we may agree with the itesident that it is most desirable that the right to permit ioreign air companies to use Bahrein should in practice (subject, of course, to the formal consent of the Sheikh) be in the hands of H.M.G. (b) It wili be necessary to ascertain whether it is proposed to give Airways any rights in respect of arrangements for civil aircraft landing, etc. on the R.A.F. aerodrome at Manama. If Muharraq only is in issue then the wording of the draft article will need alteration. (c) The present redraft perhaps adequately safeguards the position of the State, but I am inclined to think that it would be preferable |to tighten control over the Company still further * especially as the conditions under which foreign aircraft use the aerodrome are by no means unlikely | Department. 4000 3/32to give rise to trouble. This might he hone by specifying that the “authority to prescribe the conditions under which the aerodromes may be used by other aviators' which it is proposed to give to Imperial Airways shall be expressed to be “subject tc the approval of the Government of Bahrein and on their behalf.' Subject to an amendment of this nature we may agree with the procedure suggested by Colonel Powle in the last sub-paragraph of paragraph 7 of his letter of 18th October on P.Z.69Q6. Some of tdius* points have already been met by the revised draft connnunicated in his despatch of 29th October, i article 16 . Mr. Belgrave discussed with me when he was here in the summer the question of the i rent to be charged for the use of aerodromes in Bahrein by Imperial Airways and other craft. He attached great importance from the point of view of the State to d satisfactory financial arrangement and expressed much regret tnat under tne terms of the Agreement between the state ana the H.a.F. for the use of Manama aerodrome by service craft it would probably be impossible to make any additional charge in respect of/civil crafYr~TtT is, of course , 1 for us to look at this natter from the point of view ^ of the State and to safeguard its financial interests, and I am inclined to doubt whether from this aspect the arrangements suggested in the draft Agreement are entirely satisfactory. The State now apparently contemplate charging Imperial Airways £120 per annum for the use of Muharraq aerodrome, hut dispensing them from landing charges. Imperial Airways are securing a very valuable concession from the Bahrein state at a cost in no way comparable/ iJ f Minute Paper. Department, comparable to that involved in their operations at Shargah and it is clearly reasonable that they should pay rent if they use Luharraq* The Sheikh of Shargah is receiving a landing fee of Hs .5 for each aircraft that lands at the hest House. I suggest that while we need not perhaps raise the proposed rent of £120 per annum for the Muharraq aerodrome it should be a minimum, and that a charge of Hs .5 for each aeroplane of Imperial airways should be made, subject to a yearly minimum of £120. Secondly, it is for consideration ’whether the rent should not be open to revision at the end oi a fixed period. Conditions may so change and the route become so important as to make it disproportionately low. As regards foreign aircraft, it would be open to the State to charge the same or a higher fee (with the approval of the Political Resident) in respect of any ioreign aircraft which may use the aerodrome (c.f. on this point paragraph 7 of Captain Prior’s letter of 13th October on P.Z.6906/32). Article 18. As regards the term of the Agreement, we may perhaps accept 11 years, which is the same as in the case of Shargah. Article 19. There seems great advantage in definitely providing in the agreement that the Political Resident, who is the chief local authority, and for whom the State have asked (paragraph 9 of Captain Prior’s letter of 13th October), shall be the arbitrator in the event of any dispute, ana we might support this proposal to the Air Ministry. 3/— 3. Procedure. I have discussed informally with kr. Bertram of the Air Ministry the procedure in connection with the examination of the Agreement, tie tninks the best course will he that we should let the Air Ministry have our comments, after which, if •necessary, an interdepartmental meeting can he held before the matter is taken up fonnally with the Company. 4. I attach a draft to the Air Ministry. It was subsequently agreed that action on this case should await receipt of the Government of India’s views. These are contained in their air mail letter of 2nd January on P.Z.231/33 now added to the file. The redraft of Article 6 (c) suggested by the Government of India is an improvement and will incidentally cover the point raised by the Foreign Office in their letter of 2 nd January on P.Z.62/33 attached. We may also concur in their suggestion in respect of articles 8 and 9. As regards Articles 15 and 16, they share the view, which had already been formed here, that Imperial Airways must pay for facilities. Subject to the views of the Air Ministry one would have thought that despite the arguments in favour of the arrangement suggested by the government of India it would be preferable from the point of view of the Company to have a definite lease and we might therefore hold to the proposal in the minute above. ^ * /•'iV. ’ tKw | 7 *■ a - ) *0 A. 4S X * &lt; &gt;V. /?. \.

In the light of the views of the Resident and the G.of I. the 3/S aosires-t-o- auggaction consi riemtioa of - 4he p oint 5 noted below'. For convenience of reference a fair copy of the Agreement, amended to include the revised paragraphs 5, 6 (c), 11 and 15, and the additional Article ui /vfW^ ^ tin, f 19, reported in Bushire Despatch No. 821-S of 29th October 1932, Cis^ enclosed.

It seems desirable on general grounds that H.M.G. should retain a close control over any • arrangements for the grant of a ir facilities in Bahrein or the other Arab principalities of the Persian Gulf/Gulf, ana the 3/5 wauia suggest that the words “with the approval of H.M.G.” should he Inserted after the words “Govt, of Bahrein' in line 1 of the enclosed text. Article 3 . The S/S considers the redraft of this Article suggested by the State, as reported in para.2 of Captain Prior’s letter of 13th October enclosed in Bushire aespatch No.788-S of 18th October to the G/I., an improvement, and would accept it in preference to the original. ^A 1 , U Cfo.

The S/S agrees with the G/I. that if it is universal practice to exempt from customs duty petrol and oil imported solely for the purpose of refuelling aeroplanes for flight to other countries, the Bahrein Govt, should be asked to grant a customs concession to this limited extent. modified Subject to Ms he accepts the objections of the Bahrein State toflHj Draft Paper. n, Department* aue s on articles in transit in t aircrai't of Ifliperial Airways through -I Bahrein. The financial condition of | the State is far from satisfactory; its consent to the grant of facilities at Bahrein to Imperial Airways is essential to the operation of the service; the local embarrassments which may arise from the grant of any such exceptional concession may well he serious; and the objections seen by the State to the Company's proposal are, in his view, in these circumstances reasonable. article IQ . if Articles 8 and 9 are omitted, the remaining articles of the agreement will need renumbering, ana the opening words of article 10 revision. Article 12. The S/S sees no objection to this article, subject to the reservation made by the State that the wireless operated by the Company shall in no way interfere with the existing service cf Imperial and International Communications Ltd. It is however for consideration whether a proviso to this effect (which would incidentally cover the wireless installations referred to in Article 13) should not be added. 111(53 4000 7.32 Article 15/Iff T 6 »*~ mum article 15 . While, as the Re si dent points out, the question does not directly arise on the present Agreement, the S/S wishes to take this opportunity to indicate his entire agreement with the view of the Resident that it is most desirable that the right to permit foreign air companies to use Bahrein should in practice (subject, of course, to the fonml c oncurrence of the Sheikh) be in the hands of H.M.G# While he sees no objection to this Article in its present revised form, he is inclined to think it desirable, particularly having regard to the difficulties which are likely to arise in connection with the use of these aerodromes by foreign companies, to insert in the third line after the word '’prescribed' the words 'subject to the approval of the Govt, of Bahrein and on behalf of that Government.' Article 16 . It is important in « this matter to safeguard the financial interests of the Sheikh and the secretary of State agrees with the G/I. that it would not be possible to urge the Bahrein Govt, to agree to the proposal of Imperial Airways that they should pay neither landing fees nor rent.

The concession granted by |the State is a valuable one and it is possible that with the increased use of this route conditions may so changg as to render the financial arrangements suggested Agreement^unsatisfactory from the point of view of the State. As regards foreign aircraft, he would leave it open to the State to fix (subject to the approval of the Political Aesident) such landing fee, whether the same as or one higher tha that required from Imperial Airways, as/as they may think fit. On a minor point, the article as at present drafted does not make it clear whether it is proposed to give Imperial airways any rights in respect of arrangements for civil aircraft landing, etc. on the R.A.F. aerodrome at manama. If Muharraq only is in issue then certain verbal alterations will he necessary. Article 19 . The 3/3 notes that the 3tate have requested that the Political Resident should he appointed as arbitrator. Sir Samuel Hoare agrees with the G.of I. that the Resident would he the most convenient authority to arbitrate any dispute and he would suggest that specific provision for this should he made in tne agreement. 3.

Dated fLe 2nd January ; o^3 1 Reference correspondence ending with Political Resident’s Despatch No.821-3. of 1932, dated 29th Octr. 1932, on the subject of the Draft Agreement between Messrs. Imperial Airways and Bahrein Government for use of landing grounds at Bahrein. Govt, of India are in general agreement with Political Resident’s comments subject to following observations: ( 1 ) Article 6 (c). Re-draft suggested by Company may be accepted subject to following modifications, /ords s e 'other than employees of Company' should be omitted- and following addition made at end. 'All othertravellers Including employees of Company must be In possession of valid national passports which they must produce If so required to the Passport Control Officer.” (2) Articles 8 and 9. Ye understand that It is universal practice to exempt from customs duty petrol and oil imported solely for puroose of refuelling aeroolanes for flight to other countries. If this is the case we think that Bahrein Government should be asked to grant customs concession to this limited extent. (3) Articles 15 and 16. Bahrein Government are clearly unwilling to agree to Imperial Airways proposal that they should pay neither the landing fees nor rent and for reasons given in paragraph 8 of Political Resident’s despatch No.788-3., dated the 18th Octr. 1932, we do not consider that we are justified in pressing further for this concession. In our view the most convenient arrangement will be for the Company to take no lease of the aerodrome but to receive authority from Bahrein Government to act as managers of aerodrome in accordance with such general conditions as to its use by other airpcraft as Bahrein Government may decide to impose. These conditions will presumably include the payment of a landing fee by other aircraft which it will be the duty of Imperial Airways to collect on behalf of Hthe Bahrein Government as managers of the aerodrome. In order that too obvious discrimination in their favour \ may not be made Imperial Airways might pay in lieu of rent as lease-holders a consolidated landing fee of £120/- which compared with scale of landing fees charged by Govt, of India represents a considerable concession. If above proposal is agreed to the first half of Company f s re-draft of Article 15 will need amendment by omission of v/ords n and hereby grants them authority to prescribe the conditions under which the aerodromes may be used by other aviators’ 1 and substitution of some appropriate wording which will leave this authority with the Bahrein Government. Article 16 will also require amendment in order to provide for the payment of a consolidated landing fee arranged. Mention of a lease in Article 3 as suggested by the Political Resident must also be omitted. (4) Article 19. V/e agree that Political Resident should be designated as the arbitrator in case of dispute. Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.[ (S 6215/98/91) 4^&amp;4 7063 Dear Laithwaite, I imagine we shall be hearing further from you in letter No. f.Z.6906/32 of the 25th November about the proposed agreement between Imperial Airways and .Bahrein. But one point which has been taken here on what is rather specially our concern viz passports etc, may be worth passing on to you now. The correspondence mentions two proposed amendments of Article 6 (c), one in paragraph 3 of Fowle's despatch No. 788-S of the 18th October and the other in paragraph 2 of his despatch No. 821-8 of the 29th October and the enclosure. The sentences which are to be amended deal with the control of the passports of passengers and crews visiting or passing through Bahrein. We feel that the version suggested in the earlier despatch is definitely better than that in the later. due course on the correspondence enclosed in India Office 7063 /The J. 0. Laithwaite, Esq.The second version does not state clearly the requirement that all passengers, even those in transit, must carry passports (though these only need a visa if the passenger is going to visit Bahrein). In consequence, the addition to this version of the sentence from the earlier version beginning 'Employees of the Company....', which is the emendation Fowle suggests in his later despatch, is rather a son sequitur . It requires employees to carry passports without a visa 'also', without any previous mention of the fact that all transit passengers are equally obliged to do so. As however employees of the Company are to enjoy the same treatment as passengers (see India Office official letter P.Z. 7149/32 of the End ultimo), it would, we suggest, be sufficient to write\ in the formula in Powle's despatch No. 788-S 'All persons coming from abroad, whether 'passengers or employees of the Company, on arrival..'; and later, 'which in the case of those who are staying..' The second sentence: 'Employees of the Company not disembarking. ’Passport Control Officer', will then be unnecessary. fours s i nriorol y\V* &lt;5^0 JHL/MJ (17 words) r r \ — 15 DECO I) US OF TBL3SGRAM , Prom Gc^Srnment of Indian Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India.

I enclose a copy of the revised and additional Articles. 2# The alteration s do not affect the important points of difference between the State and the Company. My ccsaments on the revised Articles, after consultation with the italitical Agent, Bahrain, are as follows:- Article 5. The new article is briefer and simpler# Ho objection need be raised. Artl cle 6(c) . aee paragraph 3 of my letter quoted above. The new article is shorter and clearly limits to travellers disembarking at Bahrain the requirement of a visa# I recommend the addition of the last sentence of paragraph 3 of my letter quoted above. Article 11. The change merely corrects a clerical error as it is evidefctfcr Article 14 and not Article lb that was referred to in the original draft. Article 15 . aee paragraph 7 of my letter quoted.

The change, however, does not affect the views expressed by me on the original article. Article 19 . This is new, but see paragraph 9 of my letter quoted. The jpolitical Agent informs roe that the Bahrain State desires that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should be the arbitrator. I consider that the Political Resident, who is on the spot and knows local conditions, would probably be more suitable than an arbitrator in London. 3.* I am informing Messrs.

Sir, In continuation of my letter Ho*705-^ of 26th September 1932, I enclose a copy of a letter dated 13th October from Captain Prior, Political Agent, Bahrain, with whom I have further discussed the matter. 2. Article 3 of the proposed Agreement ^paragraph 2 of Captain Priori letterj . I see no objection to the suggested alteration in the wording of this Article. 3. Article 6 (o) lparagraph 3 of Captain PriorJjL letterV# It is correct that travellers in transit through Bahrain will not need to have their passports visaed for Bahrain, in which connection see correspondence ending with India Office letter No.P.ki.5048/32, dated 31st August 1932, from the India Office to the Government of India. The sentences in question might be altered so as to read as foilowst 'All travellers c cming from abroad on arrival at the aerodrome shall present to the Immigration Officer or other State Official their passports or other travel documents, which ....'which in the case of travellers who are staying in Bp.hr-- and not merely in transit shall be duly visaed by a British Consular or Passport Control Officer* linployees of the Company not disembarking at Bahrain will also be required to carry valid national passports, and produce them to the Passport Control Officer”. 4. Article 8 (paragraph 4 of Cap tain, prj oris letter;. X concur generally with the views oi the State on this point. Imperial Airways are halting at Bahrain to suit their own convenience. The State, as you are aware, depend largely on their customs income for their linancial existence, and exemptions given to Imperial Airways would make it difficult for the State to refuse similar concessions to other quarters. 5. ArtloX. 10 (paragraph 5 of Captain Priori. Goods in transit should, in my opinion, be free of customs dues. The only objection to the concession is that it might possibly weaken the State’s position with re gard to the dues they charge on transit cargo brought by ships. However, I do not think that this argument is of much avail. 6. Article 12 (paragraph 6 of Captain Prior’s XglL?Xl« Bo comments. Article lb (paragraph 7 of Captain Prior’s letter) . The right which the State desire to reserve to themselves, of granting permission for foreign air companies, or single machines, to land in Bahraifl. does not really ....-3. really arise under this Article and need not be referred this Agreement* It seems to me* however f most desirable on various grounds that the right to permit foreign air companies to use Bahrain ehould in practice be in the hands oi s Government* The recent correspondence t for instance, from the J&gt;utch and French Governments, on the subject of the Jutch and French air companies using the Arabian Coast, has been addressed to His Majesty's Government* What the State presumably mean is that once His Majesty's Government have given permission for foreign air companies to land at Bahrain, the State should have the right to permit these companies to land on the i-iuharraa, aerodrome* lt$ however, Imperial /irways have the sole right to supply fuel, oil, food, transport and facilities generally for the aircraft and passengers of foreign air companies, then the control of the aerodrome « from the point of view of the State — really passes into the hands of Imperial Airways, since the latter by raising their prices of commodities and transport facilities, could - at any rate theoretically - prevent foreign air companies from using the landing ground, while the foreign companies would hardly go to the expense of constructing another aerodrome, with installation, etc*, for themselves* This is I imagine what the State may be afraid of* There is no mention of fees in this Article, but if the State are going to lease the aerodrome to the Company - vide paragraph 3 below • then the Company may ask for the right to charge foreign aircraft landing fees, which the State - as will be • • • •be seen - wish to reserve for theuaelves# Thia point can be taken up when the French and Dutch air companies announce their intentions of using Bahrain# The actual fees charged whether by Imperial Airways or by the State can easily be arranged according to precedent in other countries. Probably the simplest way to deal with this Article and with the points raised above would be as foil owes (a) The Company to lease the ground from the State • vide paragraph 3s (b) Landing fees of foreign air companies to be paid to the State through the Companys (c) The matter of fuel, oil, etc., etc., to foreign air companies, which is a purely buiiness matter, to be arranged between Imperial Airways and the foreign companies concerned. It is a matter of indifference to the State which particular company supplies these requirements, since if the money is spent in Bahrain, Bahrain suppliers benefit, and if it is imported the State benefits by the customs dues* |lote# The Company may of course ask that the rent demanded for the ground, i,e. £ 120, should give them the right to * collect foreign aircraft fees for themselves. If they do so this point will have to be decided. (d) nth regard to-the management by Imperial Airways of the aerodrome on behalf of the State, this seems the most convenient arrangement. 8# Article 16 (paragraph 8 of Captain Priori xett er j » I agree with the views of the State on this point# Since the hoy&amp;l Air Force, for example, pay rent for5 the Manamah aerodrome there is no reason why the impel Airways should not pay for that at Uuharraq* arbitrating authority, and I presume that the Political Resident is the most convenient authority, though the present incumbent of that post has no desire to add to his burdens.

The State view is that since through passengers will not bs landing in Bahrain, they will not require visas and they suggest that 'all travellers com ing from abroad' should bo changed to 'all travellers from abroad who are disembarking in Bahrain”• The Btate do not A Gtt aiderconsider it necessary for crews of planes to obtain visas for Bahrain on the analogy of officers and crews of ships she are at present exempted* • I understand that some reference has been mde by the Foreign Off ice to the question of visas for through pas song era and a reference ai^ht be made to it* 4* The State are quite unable to accept Article 8 and consequently article 9 which arises out of it* They are quite unable to give any concession in the iw&amp;tter of customs dues othsr than the one which is indicated below* I unaerstand that the State view is that they depend entirely on their customs have been Ineorne for their existence* and they axs^oonstantly pressed to grant exemptions which they have hitherto invariably refused* The delicate financial condition of the State ie of course well-icnown to you* 5* .&gt; rtiole IQ * The State are prepared to give a con cession in this matter although it is contrary to thsir fundr- zaontal policy that all goods passing through Bahrain should pay 2 per cent* and they are willing to exempt goods in transit / through Bahrain -in the Cwnp^ny’s aircraft from customs dues. rticle 1^* The State hrve no objection to the introduction of wireless by the Company provided that it inter feres in no way with the existing service of the Imperial and X International Communications Limited* Article 15, 7* The S ate are prepared to give Imperial / irways the concession they desire in this Section but they insist on reser ving the right to allow foreign companies or single machines to \1 1 na in Bahr* n a*t *l.o th. r t^t to cargo ouch landtag feo. ^ ao they eonoldor doalrablo. This would a t .ply to tho Muharreq aorodroao oh*uld taperial Airways lease it. It lo their proposal to charge Imperial iUrways rent for this aerodrome and to allow them to use it and in return to charge them no landing fees but to levy such on foreign planes that use it as thtpass through. The Bahrein Govorniaant suggest that this ArtioXs should include some such additional statement as on behalf of the Government and to collect on behalf of the Government any fees or landing dues which have been imposed by the Government on any machines using the aerodrosie except those ef the Imperial Airways', »• / rtiole 16 , fhe Bahrain Govertament are unable to agree to free use of an aerodrome on Uuharraq Island and pro to pose to charge them a rental simil&amp;r/that charged for the aerodrome, &lt; ut are willing to grant an are; of gree ter\ extent. It should be remembered in this connection that water can be found anywhere beneath the eurface of this area by arttsian wells, and the Shaikh is constantly receiving applications from his relations for gifts of land in this locality. 9, There le no mention of arbitration in the agreement and the Bahrain Government desire that a clause should be Inserted in it empowering the Political Aesideut in the Persian Gulf to arbitrate should he be good enough to accept the effic q. 1 recommend this suggestion since many similar points are likely to arise from time to time which may require an authoritative interpretation.

Occasional reference is made to similar agreements with Kuwait, Muscat, and Sharjah. It also covers the preliminary negotiations in 1933 between Imperial Airways and the Government of Bahrain, and the file contains three draft versions of this agreement: see folios 489-495, 516-518, and 533-539. The latter negotiations are superseded by negotiations for the Civil Air Agreement, following a decision to standardise civil aviation procedures across the Arab Shaikhdoms.Issues related to Muharraq Aerodrome and the Manama Flying Boat base are also covered in the file, which includes the application of a legal definition of an aerodrome to Bahrain, and efforts to define the geographical extent of these air bases. This includes negotiations with the Government of Bahrain for the purchase of additional land round the Muharraq Airfield for the Royal Air Force (RAF), and the extension of facilities such as the pier at Manama. A sketch map produced by the Government of Bahrain in 1944 can be found on folio 133 in relation to a proposal from the British Government to acquire an area – referred to as area 'C' – adjacent to the Muharraq Aerodrome for the RAF.A map can be found on folio 245 showing the approaches to Bahrain harbour, which is included as a result of negotiations to establish a flying boat service through Bahrain in 1937.The Arabic language content is limited to a copy of the Bahrain Civil Air Agreement (1934), which contains both Arabic and English translations (see folios 332-348), and a few items of additional correspondence with the Shaikh of Bahrain, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifah [Shaikh, Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah].The main correspondents are as follows: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Trenchard Craven William Fowle, Hugh Weightman, and Charles Geoffrey Prior), the Political Agent at Bahrain, officials of the Air Ministry, and officials of the India Office. Occasional reference is made to the Government of Bahrain via Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bahrain.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
