PALESTINE In view of acceptance by both Jews and Arabs of Security Council’s Truce Resolution, we have suspended all supplies of war material to Arab States. 2. in meanv/hile difficulties arc arising over interpretation of paragraphs 3 and 4 of Resolution (which, as will be known, represent a French amendment to paragraph 3 of original United Kingdom draft and are somewhat imprecise). t Jewish acceptance included ”assumption” that,these paragraphs would not preclude admission of immigrants regardless of age during the four-week period, while Arab acceptance included an implied refusal to admit any such interpretation on grounds that Jews would thereby be enabled substantially.to increase their fighting manpower during Truce. 3. Our own interpretation is that ’’fighting personnel' means personnel capable of, and likely to be used for, fighting. Paragraph 4 of Resolution would then mean that if men of military age (who might therefore easily fall under prohibition in paragraph 3) should enter any of the territories, they would not be given military training so as not to bo brought into category of 'fighting personnel'. We base our interpretation on following considerations:- /(a) Had /BHBHP'. - 2 - . (a) Had intention of Resolution been to refer to ’ members of armed forces only, this would have been stated, 'Fighting personnel' is a general expression and covers something more than members of armed forces. (b) Phrase 'should men of military age be introduced' in paragraph 4 shows that this paragraph is consequential on previous one, and provides for case where, by error or otherwise, fighting personnel are introduced. In pursuance of our interpretation, v/e are retaining all Jews at present in camps at Cyprus who are between ages of ’ eighteen and forty-five, and’suffer from no physical disability. We know that these persons have undergone some military training in Cyprus. 5* We have been in consultation with United States and French Governments on subject of interpretation who have stated their positions as follows:- (l) United States Government do not wish to interpret terms of Resolution unilaterally, and when asked latter to President of Security Council. They are, however, informing ;,rab Governments that in their view, essence of Resolution is to secure cessation of hostilities during a four-week period, during which neither sid.o will be able to build up its military potential. In consequence, they consider that commonsenso moaning of paragraph 3 and 4 of Resolution is that (Q-) fro man of military age should enter countries concerned during period; (b) if, however, there were legitimate need to permit entry of men of military age for exclusively civilian pursuits, e.g, doctors, there should be adequate safeguards to sec that they did not . undertake military service. (2) French Government, while unwilling to commit themselves over interpretation, or to take any action with ..rab Governments, instructed their Delegate at United Nations to support anything on which we and the United States agreed, 6. Our general feeling is that questions of interpretation should be settled by Mediator on his own authority, unless after consideration of any particular point, he wished to refer back to Security Council for guidance. But these questions relating various questions on it by Jewish Agency, referred /to Paragraphs 3-3- to Paragraphs 3 s.nd 4 of Resolution arc clearly crucial for both sidesj oil ii left to Mediator niight prove too great a responsibility for him. 7# In these circumstances we have proposed following formula for consideration by Security Council as guidance for Mediator if required (1) essence of Resolution is to secure a cessation of hostilities during which neither side will be able to build up its military potential. (2) Owing to difficulty of ensuring that paragraph 4 of Resolution is effectively observed, no man of military age will be admitted into countries concerned (apart from those who may be already at sea on last stage of their journey to Palestine) until Mediator has reported to Security Council that he has made adequate arrangements to ensure that no man of military age who might thereafter be admitted would not be given military training. (3) Security Council would then consider Mediator’s report before authorising admission of men of military age. 8. So far Security Council seem inclined to leave interpretation to Mediator, to whom v/c arc therefore making known our view. However, should matter come up to Council in view of Mediator’s instructions to report weekly, we shall put forward proposal as outlined in paragraph 7 above v/hich we understand will have support of French and United States Delegations.hbb wmmmam m This is an unparaphrased version of a Secret cypher (typex) message and the text must first be paraphrased if it is essential to communicate it to persons outside British and United States Government Services.

IMMEDIATE No. 1651 .. S ECRET My telegram 27th May H.No. 205 Palestine. Please give following message urgently to Indian Government. Indian Government will have learned that U.K. representative in Security Council did in fact move a resolution on 27th May in sense of ten points in paragraph 4 of my telegratm under reference. 2. We think that a resolution on these lines would be fair to both Jews snd Arabs and offers best prospect of putting an early end to the fighting which is common aim of all of us. If by such a resolution a cease fire could be put into effect tbs Mediator and Truce Commission would have a chance to ascertain basis for a longer term settlement, and there would be time for tempers to cool off on both sides. As stated in point (1) of resolution, it would be without prejudice to rights, claims and positions of either party. While we still had mandatory responsibility for Palestine we felt precluded from taking an initiative, but, now that we have laid down the mandate, we have put forward this resolution as a constructive first step towards a solution. 5. It may well be that a resolution such as this offers the last prospect of the U.N. dealing with the matter under chapter six of Charter and thus obviating need to proceed under chapter /axrC'en- 2 - seven which might have incalculable consequences not only Tor individual Member States but even for continuance of U.ii, as ^•n organ oi international collaboration. 4 ' We * re ur Eing U.S. Government to use their influence with the Jews, and are ourselves trying to convince the Arabs of wisdom ol agreeing to this resolution. t&gt;. If, as we hope. Government of India share our conclusions on this delicate situation we hope that they will take any opportunity open to them of indicating this to other Governments with whom they are in touch.

I think we must make some representations to the Government of India on the lines suggested by the Foreign Office but paragraph 3 of their draft seems somewhat abrupt and I have therefore suggested a re-draft. I imagine there can be no doubt that Auster aircraft would be very useful to the Iraqi Government for military purposes. syvt 7 /.r VM vZ/W*- •“*3 h-j j- ?/l\v Sir G. Laithwaite Our telegram to U. K. H.C, New Delhi No* 1845 below. After discussion with you this morning, I have on Sir G.Laith- waite*s instructions sent a most immediate telegram asking Sir T. Shone to refrain from acting on the last sentence if he as not already done sbV since it may have slightly over-stated the position. 2. My understanding, which Mr. Costly-White confirms, is that a Dominion Government not separately represented in a foreign country is entitled to the services of a U.K. post for its diplomatic correspondence and that it would be a drastic and rather dangerous step to go so far as to withhold those services because ' we did not approve the policy of the Dominion Government in question. The Parliaments Question on this subject answered by Mr. Gordon-Walker on 17th June, which will no doubt attract some attention, lends force to the point. 3. I suggest that our further telegram to Sir T.Shone should be on the lines of the draft submitted. Perhaps Mr. Costley-White would indicate whether anyone else in Division 'A* should see. After we have cleared it among ourselves, Mr. Harrison will perhaps clear with the Foreign Office. 4. It would be desirable to get the telegram off as soon as possible. j jO UiA' /c J£\ (//** Mi 21st June,1948.
