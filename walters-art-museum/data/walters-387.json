This one has two inscriptional bands in relief and an animal frieze on an arabesque ground. The middle section was made from a mold, and this suggests that these types of jugs were made in multiples. Fustat was, in fact, acclaimed during the medieval period for ceramic mass production. It should be noted, however, that similar examples were also discovered at sites in Syria and Afghanistan.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1927", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/15763", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Excavated at Fostaat, Egypt (?).
