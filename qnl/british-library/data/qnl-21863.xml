The disposition of the Police Camel Section and Mounted Section patrols has been readjusted so that now the shore from Manama to Zellaq and from a point slightly south of the Refinery to Ras al Birr is being patrolled partly by day and partly by night. Last night the sea patrol intercepted a Qattar boat off Busatin containing ten Iranians coming without passports from Iran via Qattar. This is now the most popular route. The Nakhuda first pretended that his boat was a diving boat but on being asked why it con tained no diving apparatus he remarked that tt truth is better than falsehood' and admitted that he was running Iranians from Qattar into Bahrain. We rarely have the good fortune to catch one of these Nakhudas who bring Persians into Bahrain and in this instance when the case is heard I hope that a severe example may be made of the Nakhuda which will cu*- as a deterent against others engaged in this profitaole occupation. If his boat could be confis cated I am sure that others would be more chary of bringing Iranians to Bahrain.V- - 2 - His Higimess and the senior Shaikhs are seriously perturbed at the increasing number of Persians who are getting into Bahrain and it is the people who bring them who are really more to blame than the Iranians themselves.

Please refer to paragraph 5 of my confidential note of 27th August, 1941: travel documents for Iranians. 2. There is nothing on record to show who authorised this relaxation from the normal rule that all foreigners entering Bahrain must be in possession of a national pass port. It appears, however, from the rather sketchy orders on the various applications that it was a practice which crept in as a result of a broad interpretation of the intention underlying the proposal in paragraph 4 of Alban's D.O. No.285-29/7 of March 1st, 1941; that is to say, anyone who had eveir once been in Bahrain could return. 3. As I read it, the intention was solely to give travel facilities to respectable Iranians resident in Bahrain at the time of application and^/should be grateful to have this confirmed. 4. I am now informed that the figure of 176 travel permits given in my note under reference includes a number of ’’permissions to land” granted on payment of visa fees of Rs.lo/-. A&amp;ain there appears to be no written record but my passport clerk informs me that this practice also began in March of this year and anyone who had previously been in Bahrain and could pay the necessary fees, was allowed to land. 5. According to the last census, there are some 16,000 foreigners now in the island. A number of these are out of work and many of the others have only succeeded in not being a burden on the local Government by ousting Bahrain subjects from employment. It is not on record how many of these are Iranians but they must form a distinct majority. I therefore suggest that with the exception of those The Hon’tjle Lieut Col. ; ‘ r C.G.Prior,.-C.I&lt;F,., 'Political‘Resident in the Persian uulf*. cases/cases covered by paragraph 3 above, no Iranian is permitted to enter Bahrain unless he is in possession of a national passport valid and vised for Bahrain.

This causedmuch satisfaction among all the Iranians and also removed the misdoubts which some of them had in their mind owing to operations in Iran. They all expressed their gratitude to the British Government whom they daid was their guardian and were indebted to her for her help. 4. Early this morning a letter was found pasted on fcne of the market gates at Dubai by ' A number of sacrificing volunteers' which is intended to incite the Iranians. The Shaikh ordered its removal at once. The letter was pasted on the door with paint which made its removal impossible. In order to save the writing the door was cut and removed. I enclose herwith a copy with translation but as I am not sure of the correctness of the translation, I should be grateful if it could be checked in office. The Shaikh was very much annoyed at this action and declared openly that he was making enquirins and would severely punish the culprit. 5. The behaviour of the Iranians on the Trucial Coast have been very good so far and all of them condemned this action which they consider was by one who intends to create suspicion and unrest Iranian among the peaceful/inhabitants.t v' •) &lt;b~ U- + i &gt; TRANSLATION« Today the British Representative, on behalf of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf or on behalf of the Admiral, of the said wretched Government,^n his opinionT ^gav g assurance to the Iranians residing at Dubai to live here peacefully and added that anyone who speaks against the Government shall be punished From this statement it is understood how far the criminal policy of this Government have gdne, because on one hand the said Government have overrun the free and neutral country of Iran and on the other hand they give sweat assurances© If we were to judge this frpm a sound and just point of view, it £JL be seen that the friendship of the British(Government) is just like the friendship of a bear© They only aim at the abolishing of small Governments and the O-vT'-v^X A ( k demolishing &lt;saf the Islamic world© The Iranian* nation is not 2- satisfied with this fetched blood thirsty British Government and Jk-i-i&amp;j &lt;Lv would not allow herself to be deceived^ and^the responsible Iranians shall not refrain from their activities which they have in view and shall soon bring them into action© It is essential for all Iranians not to allow themselves to be cheated by the devilish play of those &lt;*v/ ‘K V wretched(British) but they should defend their lives and add theiir voice to th&amp;% of those who are resposnible for them(when the time comes).

From this statement it is understood to what extent the criminal policy of this accursed Government has reached, because, on the one hand the said Government has overrun the free and neutral country of Iran and, on the other, it shows its buttered tongue. If we were to judge this from a just point of view, it would be seen that the friendship of the British Government is just like the friendship of a bear. Their only and entire aim is to abolish small nations and to overthrow the Islamic world. The Iranian Nation is not satisfied with this ominousj blood thirsty, godless, dog worshipping, butter-tongued British Government and would not allow itself to be deceived; and the Iranian guarantors shall not refrain from their activities which they have in view and shall soon bring them into action. It is essential and Incumbent on all Iranians not to allow themselves to be hoodwinked by the devilish play of the accursed British but every body should come forward to defend his life and, when the opportunity occures, to join hands with those who have undertaken (the liberation of their country).

To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Bahrain. Memorandum A copy of a letter from the Director of Customs, Bahrain, is enclosed. 2. I have enquired from Haji Yusuf Fakhroo who says that dhows proceeding to and from India and other places out side the Persian Gulf sometimes stop at places in the Persian Coast to take on water etc•, and they are liable to be attacked by bands of robbers who come off in small b boats. He says that these men come from the mountains behind and are armed. 3. The places where dhows are accustomed to put in at are Chiru, Charak, Qais, Has Nabund, Kargun, etc. 4. He was not able to give any instance of a dhow having been attacked although he said that such cases had occurred. 5. Of course there is nothing to prevent persons on dhows carrying arms provided that they have been licensed by the State but they appear to want the Shaikh of Bahrain to issue a regular order. 6. There is of course a good deal of smuggling of tea, etc., into Persia and a possible explanation is that these smugglers get into conflict with the Customs authorities and hope to make the present situation an excuse to carry arms against them. 7. No action seems called for unless it is definitely substantiated that dhows are being attacked. In the meantime perhaps the Political Agent, Kuwait, might be requested to inform us of what is being done at Kuwait and the reasons therefor. Sd. R. G. Alban.

Copy of memrranduxn No. PA/HL/26/598 dated the 15th Novamher 1941 from the Director of Customs and Port Officer, Bahrain, to the Political Agent, Bahrain. It has been reportedto me by Mr. Ahmed bin Yusuf Fakroo of Maharaq that, in consequence of the position in Tehran, much lawlessness has broken out in Southern Persia, e.g. in Laristan, and particularly in the Persian Mekran. Native craft carrying imports and export* to and from Basra, Kuwait and Karachi and Bahrain proceed along closely to the Persian coast; and often on account of weather, and to obtain drinking water, put in a t the various smaller Persian ports as far as Chiru and Kalat, whence they sail across the Gulf to the Arabian side. At these small ports such craft are visited by armed local trivesmen who loot valuables from the crew and passengers, and steal much foodstuffs as are possible. The port of Chiroo is becoming notorious for these prac tices which, so far as I understand, do not appear to occur upon the high seas. In view of this situation I am told that the 'Ruler of Kuwait, with the concurrence of H.B.M's Political Agent there, has ordered his subjects whose traffic in deep water craft is both numerous and extensive, to defend themselves by carrying two rifles and a suitable quantity of ammunition in each craft. •r Ahmed Fakroo asks that similar orders may be given to Bahrain craft (of whom his family own a fair number) for their own protection while passing the Makran and Persian coasts. I would be glad if you would kindly advise me as to the suitable action to be taken in this position, as during the coming winter, it is possible that the local food situation will require the services of local craft rather more than previously, please.CONFIDENTIAL.
