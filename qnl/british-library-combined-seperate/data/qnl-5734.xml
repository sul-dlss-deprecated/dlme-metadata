Additional expenditure was required mainly to maintain an increased consular guard, as a result of local unrest and Afghan raids: this increase was allowed each financial year up to and including 1924-25. Other increases arose from requests from the consulate for furniture, medical supplies, and additional pension allowance for a member of staff.The principal correspondents are the Government of India Finance Department; the Foreign Office; and the Consul for Seistan and Kain.The file includes a divider which gives the subject number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consulate, Seistan and Kain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Seistan and Kain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Finance Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Expenditure</topic></subject><subject><topic>Embassies and consulates</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000a1#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
