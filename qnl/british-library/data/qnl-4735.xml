The following is a summary of his activities, as collated from official data received. Our agent was with the party to Iraq and he, on instructions of Pastori, v/ent down the Persian Gulf to establish connections for carrying out the project outlined in my above-quoted reference. Agents activities are disclosed in various reports from Iraq from which it appears that acting on instructions he got in touch with the political Agent, Bahrein, wno through the Resident, Persian Gulf, got into touch with the Secretary of State, India; the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf; Air Officer Commanding Iraq and the Political Agent at Muscat. In a telegram dated 1.3.38, the Resident Persian Gulf ruled that Agent was not to send a prearranged telegram to Pastori. This decision was confirmed to Agent in telegrams and by a note dated 3.3.38 from the Political Agent, Bahrein. Pastori’s movements became very elusive and he failed to embark on any vessel sailing down the Persian Gulf, but he did visit Muhammerah and certain Italian vessels (Naval and private) and did visit Abadan about this period, and it would appear that he had actually intended going down the Persian Gulf littoral as he had undertaken to clear certain arms, the property of Count de Prorok, from the Bahrein , i'.., Customs, and it seems possible that the failure to receive any telegram from Agent may have caused him to give up the ideaIn any case, it is known that Pastor! visited Basrah by rail on 31.3.38 and met the people enumerated below. Prom Basrah he adopted a rather extraordinary ruse, he proceeded by taxi to Siba (left bank Shatt el Arab, S. of Basrah) and there changed direction, and instead of proceeding to Muhammerah for which journey he had taken the taxi, slipped over the frontier into Persia. He did, however, ultimately reach Muhammerah where he posed as one seeking employment. His stay in this area was peculiarly brief as he reappeared in Baghdad on 5.4.38, having eluded surveillance, and it would appear intends leaving Iraq, so as to embark on s.s. Marriette Pacha which sailed from Beyrouth on 3.5.38, as Agent (now returned to Jerusalem) received a letter from Nejib Soussa (brother-in-law of Pastori) dated Baghdad 28.4.38, stating the ’’English firm had cabled him to return to Cairo for the various businesses I have proposed them”. People met in Baghdad by P as tori : Dr. Gerschow, German commercial, staying Tigris Palace Hotel David Hall, Abyssinian (ex-German) who is a friend of Daoud al Haidari. Dr. Weigener, who resides with above. Yusuf Assi, ex-clerk of Tigris Palace Hotel (many times a candidate for ” 1 ” employment). Commodore (?Commendatore) Seiman, Italian Aircraft Specialist for Breda Aeroplanes being supplied to Iraq Government. Staying Maude Hotel - a great friend. Others mentioned by Agent : Mr. P. Tilio. Dr. Pergolani, Mario. Letters were sent by Pastori to : Colonel Rozalio, Vis G. Passiani 10, Rome. Signor Garracia, Chief Justice High Court, Rome.

Incidentally, the Resident Persian Gulf states Agent was able to supply him with some useful information about Sharjah. It would appear from the foregoing that on this occasion, at least, Pastori has not been able to do any business on the lines he anticipated.Mr SILVER 'I 0 S 75 ‘',7 In continuation to my memorandum No. 1514 dated 7.6.38.? on the subject of TULLIO PASTORI?

IRAQ Purchase of War Material from Italy . 1* In connection with the purchase of war material from Italy alleged to he under consideration by the Iraq Government, it is stated that the firm of CREMONINI- BORTOLAZZI has offered to sell at greatly reduced rates six river-craft, each armed witn six machine-guns, Beretta rifles with barrels suitable for .303 ammunition, and automatic pistols. An offer is also made by the same firm of a large quantity of B.S.A. rifles with ammunition of the requisite calibre, which can be obtained from a certain Captain BALL of London. It is understood that the Iraq Government is considering placing a sample order , with this firm. yo Supply of Arms for Palestine 2. Prom certain remarks recently made by Lt. Colonel PERGALONI it seems that both he and PASTORI have been turning their attention to proposals made in certain quarters for the supply of small arms and ammunition to the Syro-Palestinian leaders for use in Palestine. According to POLLICI, of the Italian Legation, who was questioned on this matter, such action would be extremely foolish, since strict orders have been received from his Government to abstain from any activity likely to be interpreted by the British as being unfriendly to them. He added that only about six weeks ago the Italian Legation had been approached by certain Syro-Palestinian and Iraqi nationalists, including Dr. RUfAIHA and some2 (2090) of his associates, on the subject of the supply of arms and ammunition to the Arabs in Palestine; hut that as, at the time,the Anglo-Italian Agreement was in sight, they paid no attention to the suggestion. For the same reason, POLLIGI explained, he had advised PASTORI to discontinue his negotiations for the sale of arms to the Persian Gulf Shaikhs. Further activities of Tullio PASTORI Now that negotiations for the exploitation of bitumen are well under way and certain contracts have already been signed, PASTORI has turned his attention to the last of the four commercial interests (indicated in the marginally-noted report) for which he is said to have gone to Iraq. According to source an agreement has been concluded between PASTORI and a Kurd named Abdullah Kaikhrusrau ibn MAHMUD Pasha of Qizil Robat, for the lease of his estate over a period of 60 years for agricultural purposes. The estate, which includes an area of nearly 20,000 acres, is valued at £100,000. Under article 11 of the agreement PASTORI, on behalf of the group for which he is working, undertakes to pay £ 10,000 and to supply agricultural machinery from Italy to the value of £5,000. Large estates within the Guwair sector are said to be PASTORI’s next objective, and this is to be followed by similar transactions within the Kut and Muntafiq Divisions and other districts. 4. The activities of PASTORI are varied and appear erratic. At the same time he has had access to MUSSOLINI, whom he met on 28th December 1937, when he is alleged to have discussed the exploitation of gold ore in certain parts of Abyssinia. PASTORI has produced a3. (2090- photograph of* a telegram sent to him hy II Duce^ secretary 9 3EBASTIANI, to prove the authenticity of the meeting. 5 . After a short visit to Cairo, PA3T0RI expects to fly to Rome, where he will meet II Duce and when final arrangements will he made for his departure to Ahyssinia via Khartoum and the Blue Nile. He expects to return to Iraq after an absence of about six or seven months. 6 . The fact that PASTORI, who never appears to complete any work on which he is engaged, has access to MUSSOLINI indicates that the Italian Government has some motive for making use of his services. It has been claimed that he is little more than an adventurer, but at the same time he appears to be a man of energy, who is able to make useful inroads into countries on which Italy has a watchful eye, and in this way he can act as a pioneer for the peaceful penetration of Italy and Italian influence in foreign countries. In support of this theory, Prii^GALOhl recently put forward the criticism that PA3T0RI had a mania for obtaining concessions on paper without making workable arrangements for their exploitation. Moreover, ne added to this that such activities were only intended to camou flage his real business.COPY 2092 © Q 12th May 1938 &gt;&lt;&lt; 5^ IRAQ Italian Activities Lieut-Golonel Mario PBRGALONI . 1. The introduction hy PASTORI of PERGALONI and ZILIO into the complicated 'businesses, in which PASTORI is involved, seems to call for an account of what is known of PERGALONI's past history and present activities in order to reach any enlightenment as to the reasons for the forma tion of this curious combination and the policy adopted by them. 2. PSRGALONI, who with ZILIO appears to have been invited to Iraq, by PASTORI in connection witn the bitumen business, is alleged to be a man of high social rank and to be endowed with more than average ability. Once a senior officer in the Flying Corps, he is now an officer of the Reserve Force and claims to have been awarded the D.S.O. He is a doctor in chemistry, an expert road and fortress constructional engineer, and a painter. In this last capacity he has recently been engaged to paint portraits of King GHAZI and other Arab notables. 3. According to PASTORI, PERGALONI was for a time in the bad books of Signor MUSSOLINI for starting the rumour that Marshal BALBO was intriguing against II Duce with a view to usurping his position as Dictator. He was, therefore, discredited by Signor MUSSOLINI, but regained favour by volunteering to fight in the Abyssinian campaign. On conclusion of the campaign he obtained employment with certain constructional firms in that country. For a second time he found himself in trouble, and with ZILIO he was ordered to leave Abyssinia for having bribed e Works officer in connection with some tenders for the construction of the2 . (2092) Gimma aerodrome* The Works officer and a senior member of the Testa firm, 'by which PERGALONI was employed, committed suicide; but, in recognition of his valuable services to Italy and of his close liaison with people of note in both Italy and Abyssinia, no further action was taken against him. Proof of the high social position held by him may be found in a letter which he received from Marshal GRAZIANI* This letter, which was seen by source, was couched in intimate terms, and was sent to PERGALONI on the occasion of his daughter’s wedding last October. 4. Although PERGALONI was invited to Iraq, to assist in exploiting bitumen he has other interests and recently wrote to the firm of Ansaldo, manufacturers and dealers in war material, of Genova Cornigliano, asking them to grant him their Iraq agency. He has received a reply from this firm to the effect that they are already efficiently represented by Captain SIMEN, their travelling agent, and by one ZABUNI of Mosul, their resident agent, and that through them they had already received various commissions from'Iraq. At the same time the firm pointed out that all Italian producers and manufacturers of war material had now been regrouped into a company known as ’’Gita” - Gruppo Italiano Armamenti, of 89 Via Vittorio Vaneto, Rome - to which PERGALONI’s offer had been referred. 5. In a conversation on this subject PERGALONI stated that the head of this group was General MANI, who controlled the supply of war material to Spain and who was a personal friend of both his and of PASTORI. 6 . The situation created by these Italians in Baghdad is the more involved because, although PERGALONI AND ZILIO were undoubtedly invited to Iraq for some purpose or other by PASTORI, the latter appears to be discredited by the otherI) 3 ( 2092 ) two# In a recent conversation they asserted that he had heen fooled by Parah Hanna ZAKARIA, incorrectly reported as being an Indian, to whom he had paid £250 for the purpose of persuading the Shaikh of Oman’s son to lease land, which is believed to contain iron. ZAKARIA, who is reported to have left now for Syria or Palestine, appears to have failed in his mission, and according to PERGALONI and ZILIO he either fooled PASTORI or else he was employed by him on subversive activities. Moreover, in further conversation on this subject, PERGALONI expressed the hope that PASTORI would not be deceived in the bitumen business in the same way as he had been fooled by ZAKARIA, and added that they had always heard that PASTORI posed as a concession hunter to cover that sort of business, which he used to do secretly in Abyssinia and in the Sudan and which he had been trying to do recently through ZAKARIA. NOTE : Incidentally it is interesting to note that PASTORI produced receipts for sums alleged to have been paid by him to ZAKARIA amounting to £250. 7. In addition to PERGALONI and ZILIO, Signor POLLICI asserted that PASTORI had been engaged in subversive acti- vities for years. With the apparent split between the two ! parties comes the added interest that the Italian Minister mistrusts PASTORI. If, as it appears, PASTORI is engaged in subversive activities, it seems strange that the Minister should not be informed by his Government of the type of work on v/hich PASTORI, who appears to have access to Signor MUSSOLINI, is employed. It seems equally strange that two men, both seemingly well known in Italy, should by agree ment have met in Baghdad and as if by consent should, in conjunction with POLLICI, a Secretary of the Italian Legation, have created the curious situation in which all are employed in the same work, and yet in the presence of nationals4 (2092) of another country two of the group accuse their leader of carrying on subversive activities. They may be a set of commercial adventurers whose shady tactics are the result of mutual rivalry. Meanwhile, however, they are being viewed with particular suspicion.Palestine Report A/l S' &amp; ,&lt; 3^ 13.5.3S TUI.LIQ PAS TOR I V/ith further reference to my letter dated May 5th, 1938, it would appear that this man*s activities in Iraq and the Persian Gulf are definitely in connection with the sale of arms and ammunition. Together with one Lieut. Colonel MARIO PERG-ALONI, he has tried to sell to the Iraq Ministry of Defence, British pattern rifles, machine guns and other war material captured from the Abyssinians by the Italians during the Abyssinian campaign in 1935. As regards payment, it is said that the Italian^ Government would accept one-third in Iraq currency and the rest in goods such as cotton woool, cereals and,if possible, bitumen. V/ith regard to the latter, this is required for the manufacture of explosives or incendiary bombs ? of recent invention. It is also reported that both PASTORI and PERGALONI had thought of supplying arms to the Syrian and Palestinian rebefe, but were advised by the Italian official authorities that this would be considered unfriendly by the British Government and, in view of the friendly relations at present existing between the two countries, they were advised not to undertake the proposition. They were also advised to discontinue the nego tiations for the sale of arms to the Persian Gulf Sheikhs. While it is agreed that PASTORI’s activities are varied and erratic (he has also been termed an adventurer), he did nroduce a copy of a telegram purporting to have come from MUSSOLINI 1 s Secretary, one SEBASTIAN!, to meet the former on the 28th December 1937&gt; in order to prove the authenticity of the meeting. PASTORI, who is still in Iraq, will shortly return to Rome, via Cairo, and his next adventure will be in Abyssinia, to which place he will proceed via Khartoum and the Blue Nile. There is no doubt that PASTORI is a man of energy and he seems to have a mania for obtaining concessions on paper without making workable arrangements for their corapihetion. It is still suspected that these activities are only intended to camouflage his real business.fiS) ^ 1 a SILVER. 8.4.38 With reference to the case of TULLI3 PASTORI, (India Office papers P.Z. 1448/1938 apply), I enclose herewith as of interest a copy of a report dated 15.3*38., which has been received via the War Office, on the subject of this man.

One informant,who has had dealings with Pastori in the past, frankly admits that the latter 1 s real in tentions for the future have not been disclosed to him. felt as to whether the Italians trust P&amp;STORI very far. It must be remembered that his scheme for settling Assyrians in Abyssinia was disavowed by the Italian authorities and that claims which he made in connection with that scheme must have been based largely on falsehoods. 2 I also enclose a copy of a note dated 7*3.38. on Notwithstanding these reports, considerable doubt is Enclg.II DVW. 4^ : ^ ^ ^Report of interview with Mr J, on 15,3.^8 TULLIQ PASTORI « Mr J # is employed at present in the Air Ministry. He asked for an interview in order to impart certain information which had come into his possession. He said that he was a geologist and that prior to the Italo—Ethiopian war*he was prospecting in Western Ethiopia. He found there, in quantities which would he workable commercially, nickel, platinum, gold, mica, lignite and haematite. He worked in conjunction with an Italian named TULLIQ PASTORI, who had a licence from the Ethiopian Government to prospect in that area. He considered that some of PASTORI’s activities were most peculiar and outside the realm of ordinary prospecting, and he had since discovered that PASTORI was employed by the Italian Intelligence Department. PASTORI spoke very good Arabic. During 1937 he tried to get PASTORI to come to London in connection with mining concessions in Ethiopia, but PASTORI in formed him that the Italian Government would not provide him with the necessary documents to visit England. Last September, PASTORI came over to England on a day trip and Mr J. met him at Folkestone. PASTORI complained bitterly of the situation in Italy and said that he had had all his foreign securities confiscated. (NB. A law to this effect was passed in Italy some time ago and applies to all Italian subjects). PASTORI said that MUSSOLINI was | mad and imbued with a lust for power. He said that the Italians had plans worked out in the minutest detail to seize the Suez Canal by an expedition of mechanised forces from Libya. He said that the Italians were aware that the Germans intended to take over Austria and that the Italians intended shortly after this had taken place to carry out their plan for an attack on Egypt.- 2 - After the capture of the Suez Canal an additional Corps would go through and capture Palestine. At the same time the channel between Sicily and the North African coast would he blocked with mines and another Italian expedition would seize Cyprus. PASTORI said that the economic position of Italy was extremely bad, the Ethiopian War had made the country bankrupt and MUSSOLINI was, therefore, in the position of having to do something desperate. During 1934, Mr J. was in Khartoum and there he met an Italian named TRUCCO, who was agent for the Lloyd Triestino Co. in Khartoum. Mr J. was convinced that this man was the head of the Italian Intelligence Service there, and said that he had good reason to believe that meetings of various Italians took place at TRUCCO f s residence at night, and that in a shed at the back of the house, was, he believed, a short wave wireless transmitter. Mr J. was instructed to pass on any further information he might obtain from PASTORI, should he meet him again. 15.3.38IRAQ Italian Activities 7th March 1938 Tullio PASTORI . 1. According to a recent report, Tullio PASTORI came to Baghdad accompanied on this occasion by a person alleged to be his brother-in-law, named Najib SUSA, and by an Indian who travels under the pseudonym of Najib ZAKARIYAH. The latter has been sent to Basrah with orders to proceed to Kuwait, Bahrein and Muscat under other names. 2. Outwardly, Tullio PASTORI f s interests are commercial, such as:- (i) Concessions for the exploitation of oil in the Basrah Vilayet and in certain parts of Saudi- Arabia; (ii) Permission, somewhat on a concession basis, for the export of Iraqi bitumen, in respect of which he is in touch with Nuri as SAID, to whom he was introduced by a mutual friend; (iii) The sale of war material to the Iraq Government and to certain Persian Gulf Shaikhs; (iv) The purchase of lands, which the Italians hope to possess under Iraqi names. 3. In addition to his commercial interests Tullio PASTORI has claimed in private conversation a close connexion with the Italian Navy. It seems that he knows more about the movements of the Italian man-of-war at present paying courtesy visits to ports in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf than the Italian Minister himself. It is possible that Tullio PASTORI is an agent of the Italian Navy, since in a discussion as to the possibility of doing business withMuscat he gave the name of a certain Baqir Ahdul Latif FAZUL, of Muscat, alleged to he an Italian agent, and added that he had full confidence in this man not only in commercial deals hut also in other activities. Agents in direct touch with the warship have received instructions to disseminate pro-Italian and anti-British propaganda and to distribute funds amongst certain tribal chiefs in the Persian Gulf who are hostile to Great Britain. His connexion with the Italian Navy is further suspected owing to his alleged association with BUI, the Italian Naval Attache at Tehran, whose arrival is shortly expected at Baghdad. 4. It is also known that Tullio PASTORI has also close connexions with a certain G. KARASTOYANOPP, Hotel Slavianska Bessedo in Sofia. In a discussion as to the possibility of importing empty date-boxes from Bulgaria for the Date Board of Basrah, he has given the name of KARASTOYANOPP, to whom he suggested that a sample box should be sent.I enclose herewith as of interest, copies of two reports which have been received from Palestine, dated respectively i 29*12,37. and 3*3*3S*&gt; on the subject of TULLIO PASTORI. As will be seen, the first of these two reports seemed to indicate that the activities of PASTORI need not be taken very seriously, since he had the reputation of being a commer cial adventurer rather than a political agent. I am informed, how ever, that in view of the later report, it is considered that he may prove to be of some significance. The desire of the Italians to stake claims,- however ethereal - in any part of the Arabian terri tory which they might regard as free from a political commitment with Britain, can be readily understood. In this respect, PASTOR!^ urgent mission would not be out of keeping with the known Italian activities on the other side of the Arabian Peninsula. DVW.

TULLIO PASTORI returned from Rome to Cairo at the end of January and on 5-2.31. arrived in Jerusalem accompanied by a young man named S0US3A, who is believed to be his brother-in-law, and a resident of Cairo. He left with his companion on 6.2.38., for Damascus en route Iraq, the necessary visas for that country, he stated, were being obtained in Damascus. According to report, he was well-supplied with funds which he will be able to replen ish by means of a draft on the Ottoman Bank at Baghdad. PASTORI mentioned that the project of bringing machine guns to the Persian Gulf area was being carried out. He said that about six would be transported in an Italian ship, the details of which would be telegraphed to him in Iraq. He and his party would then embark on the vessel on its voyage down the Gulf and would be landed in a chosen spot. It is further stated that in the presence of SOUSSA, no mention was made of the foregoing matters and the talk was confined to the acquisition of conces sions from the 'free” sheikhs of the Persian Gulf littoral, i.e. sheikhs owing no present allegiance to the British. Pastori insisted that he 'must obtain concessions irrespective of their potential value for exploitation'and that he was strictly enjoinec to obtain such concessions so as to stake a claim. PASTORI also displayed curiosity as to the situation of any British Aerodrome or landing grounds in the Persian Gulf region and specifically inquired about a suitable site in the Ruba* el Khali (the S.W. portion), where it would be possible to establish a secret petrol dump and which would be easily accessible to air craft from Massawa. He made several allusions to TALAAT PASHA, (presumably Talaar Harb Pasha of Egypt), as interested in his schemes. Particulars of this interest were not, however, forth coming. Regarding the proposed place of landing in the Persian Gulf, it is suggested that Duba (not Dabai), on the Trucial Coast, will be chosen.Copy of Palestine Report : dated 29*12.57 . TULL10 PASTORI. 1. During the past month PASTORI has heen working on a scheme for the settlerruant of Assyrians in Abyssinia. He was in Baghdad from 28.10.37. to 12.11.37. He had interviews with Iraqi, Italian and German Ministers there on this subject but does not seem to have met with much success. On 13.11.37. he arrived at Haifa, Palestine and reached Jerusalem the following day, leaving for Egypt on 17.11.37. In Palestine, during the course of conversation, PASTORI appeared to be interested in obtaining Military and Air Force information but did not get anything of value. 2. The following report has been received from Cairo: About the middle of December next, PASTORI is to leave for Kermanshah ^Iran). From there he will proceed to a Persian port, probably Muhammerah, where he will embark on an Italian ship. According to PASTORI, the ship will carry ten machine guns, some ^ lfle3 &amp;ud ammunition and a supply 6'f Maria Therese dollars. PASTORI will be landed on a lonely stretch of the Trucial Coast, near DBBA (possibly DIBAI) with the money and arms and will then make his way into the interior. The object is said to be to raise a revolt or disturbance of an anti-British nature. The fanaticism of the local sheikhs, the unpopularity of the British, and par ticularly of the British Consul, (a Sheikh from Kuwait), will all be exploited. The general idea is to destroy British incluence and to establish Italian influence in Oman, which forms a bottle neck to the Persian Gulf. PASTORI was accompanied on several oc casions in Cairo by a certain Commandant VSCH (or VICH), who is described as being about 35 years of age, dark, thin, clean shaven, with hazel eyes and dark hair, and about 5 , 6' in height. He is said to have arrived recently by air from Rome via Damascus to Egypt and to belong to the Italian Secret Service. 3. TULL10 PASTORI is described as being aged about 50-55 years, dark, fat, nearly bald, clean shaven and about 5*7' in height: wears glasses for reading. He is a well-known commercial adventu rer and has been wandering round Abyssinia, Eritrea, Sudan, Egypt and the Persian Gulf for years. At one time he was viewed by the Italians with extreme suspicion and is thought to be willing to work for any power that will pay him. Last year he was connected with another shady character, 'Count' BYRON KUHN (or PROROK). As regards the scheme outlined above and taking into account PASTORI f s activities during the past few years, it is probable that this is another 'wildcat' scheme to get money from gun-running ox* to obtain oil or gold concessions in Oman. His services are, however, at present of undoubtedly greater value to Italy than to anyone else: it is nevertheless considered that PASTORI’s activitieg are more commercial ventures than espionage. He is not thought to be a member of any regular espionage system. He left for Rome on 28.11.37. in order to get final approval for his scheme and is due to return to Palestine about the middle of December, v/hen a further report on him will be made.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000237_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/228</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000237</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/228</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>PZ 2729/37(S) 'Pastori, an Italian subject: Activities in the Persian Gulf.
