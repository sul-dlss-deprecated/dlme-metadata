Political - /THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED Awali, No. CON-613. ahrein Island. Persian Gulf, 22nd August, 1940. His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrein. Dear sir, With reference to our conversation about wireless this morning, I present the following facts The Bahrein Petroleum Company had two transmitting sets in use during the operations of the Geophysical survey around Bahrein, but these sets were dismantled in May 1940 when the survey was completed. Recently these sets were re-assembled and tested as follows :- 27th July at 9 p.m. on 5050 Kcs. 6th Aug. at 1-30 p.m. on 4615 Kcs. 7th Aug. at 6-30 p.m. on 4615 Kcs. The tests in each case consisted of short random readings from periodicals. The transmitters are for 50 watt crystal controlled telephony. They are capable of transmitting Morse at 150 watts but have not been used on that strength. After the tests the sets were partially dis mantled and are still in that state and under lock and key. None of the Bapco launches nor the tugs hired from Gray MacKenzie are fitted with winiess transmitting apparatus. Mr. Trevor Brown had a private transmitting set but it is understood that an essential part of his machine is now in the keeping of the Political Agent. Thus it will be seen that none of the trans missions you mentioned can have emanated from this Company or its employees.Co*/ - J 2 22nd August, iy 4 U. In regard to the Casoc sets, I am informed as follows, but suggest you should substantiate from other sources W.T. The transmitters are of the 50 watt crystal controlled telephony type and are arranged so that they can only operate on 4615 Kcs. personal custody of the Captains so that unauthorised use is not possible. At A1 Khobar there are perhaps six transmitters, and in the field there are a number of low power stations. The call signals HAV and ACM that you mentioned do not belong to any of the Casoc stations: nor are these letters the initials of any Bapco or Casoc employees. any employee of Bapco or Casoc, but one - Twitchell - is known to be the name of an employee of the Saudi Arabian Gold Mining Syndicate. It is likely that the other four are also connected with that Company and I suggest that the signals of August 9th, 10th and 11th onanated from their headquarters. from Abadan to its outposts are frequently and easily received here, so the signals of July 10th may have come from there. relate to interference and to accidental transfer of information to the enemy, but this seems a suitable occasion to suggest that the regular transmission from Rhyad to Germany (at about 4-30 a.m. each morning) may be the channel whereby items of local news have so quickly appeared in German broadcasts.
