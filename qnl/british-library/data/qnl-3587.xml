Dated 27th c tober -934,(d) The tribal -Itaation and Ibn Jaud The prestige of Ibn Saud in l eninsula Oman is in direct proportion to his strength and ability to harm it* There is no foundation for believing that some of the tribes being so-called Wahabis, they desire the extension to themselves of the Imam’s full temporal authority. The Hanbali sect to which the Bhahirah tribes in a large measure belong, is not, as practised here, essentially different from the ..aliki or Shafi orthodoxy• Inherited from a time when it took a narrow and fanatical form and imposed at the point of the sword, it is now whittled down to a moderateness and toleration that make it unrecognisable as Wahabism* bo -called co-religionists of Ibn Saud, these tribes are inveterate smokers, though as a relic of past proscription, they do not as a rule grow 'the weed' 5 in their own territory# They would not gladly suffer the introduc tion of the rigid tenets of Riyadh. On the other hand Ibn Baud they cannot defy. hopelessly divined against themselves into the Kinawiyah and Jhafiriyah factions, unable or unwilling to unite or sacrifice separate tribal sovereignty which is the genius of their system, it is only Ibn Saud who in the past hundred years has been able to invade and dominate them under a single authority at baraimi. They know that it is only he who may desire and is able to do this again. But it is not invasion that they fear which prompts them to pay * zakat*. This spectacular method, which the first invader, Abdul A^iz the • ahabi, used at the beginning of the Nineteenth century is no longer necessary. To-day it is the power of letting loose a strong tribe to raid a weaker Dhahirah one and carry off its camels without hope of redress or retaliation that is Ibn/&gt;2 Ibn Saud’s strength. Thus lamsdiately before the arrival of Ibn oaud’s zakat collector, one of the Bani Yas tribes was raided by the Al Hurra and lost a hundred and fifty camels. Payment of sakat to Ibn Saud is therefore a kind of insurance against the raider. It is the wisdom and economy of the present Abdul A^i^ to bring his insidious pressure to bear on a wavering tribe through a stron&amp; and loyal neighbour whose interest it is to be ensured the iruits of victory, mindful of the lessons of the ruthless if intermittent *.&amp;habi occupations of the Dhahirah, trie people of * eninsula Cman do net belittle the man of Riyadh who to-day has repeated the exploits of his forerunners, uut they do not love him. In reality it is not Ibn Saud himself whom they desire to propitiate but his viceroy Ibn Jaluwi, Governor at Hofuf, whose activities extend to these ^astern marches. Under this lighter regime Ibn Gaud's inflttenco aoes not as it did in 1800 penetrate into the Oman Gultan&amp;te or even to wadi Jizzl, nor does it reach the Coast as it did at Sharjah in the eighteen Sixties. Its design seems to be to bring the Baduin Ciimel tribes of the Dhahirah - the Minasir, Mi^ariya', Bani Yas baduin, Na’im, Albu Ghaftis, dhuwahir, baru*, Awamir, Bani Ka'ao and Bani ^itab - to acknowledge a nominal degree of subordination and F ay sakat without trouble or expense, or military measures calculated to rouse their antagonism. Clearly the tribes in close proximity to hasa e.g. Minasir and li^ariya' are unable to, resist, those further resnoved, the Bani Yas Badu (who also j aerive sti*ength from their coastal coaneo cions), the Na'im, dhuwahir and Dam* are in a stronger position, while the Bani Ka'ab and Bani ^itab aresufficientl^ remote to say 'Ho*. It is the wisdom of Ibn baud to o- .and from the Jirst, request from the second, and leave it to the volit ion/-3- volition of the third. The mauakidl this year 9 one Eahamiaad bin Mansur ox' tlxe Lurra 1 tribe, collected ^akat on the following basis. One dollar on each camel from the ’huwar* i.e. one year camel upwarus. One dollar on each ten head of sheep ana goats. * oor caravaners were exempted and remissions were made to the moneyless Awamir. The .-aru’ paid very little and the Bani Ka'ah and Bani ^itab not at all. But behind the zakat collections, the power of Ibn Baud to turn one of these tribes within his influence on to another, its possibly hereditary enemy, and the fear felt within a uribe of its being left in isolation, give him an undeniable prestige. Then these facts are realised the volte face of Bhaikh Saqar after promising you support for the hoyal Air Force ^edition (Ibn daluwi is inwardly not on good terms with him) and the initial terror of Shaikh B&amp;lim of the Lani Ka*ab to harbour the hoy&amp;l Air Force party will appear to be acts of self-preservation and give the observer pause before ccndeiming. dhaHXHaT ) Thus the situation in Jau, or the Baduin northern AL BXH* ) —— — half of the Dhahirah. The southern half of Dhahirah starting at Dhank is called la. Its inhabitants are chiefly settled aiid mainly belong to the Ghaliriyah fe-ction arid the Ibadhi sect. Ibn Baud has made no overtures here and his agent would be unwelcome in any of its chief towns Ibri, dulaif, a! i\raqi, Ainan oi’ .isrio.* it will be remembered that in December 1925 the Imam of Interior Oman, and hhaikh Isa bin Salih invaded and overran Dahirat al Sir. Ostensibly their object was to resist Wahabi encroachments which were believed to tlireaten Oman i roper itself, a hen their/I • ® -4- thair move was seen however to involve worse implications, namely the subordination of Sir, predominantly Ghafiriyah, to a Hinawiyah hegemony, misunaerstaiidiiig© arose and the army melted away. Sulai an bin Hamyar, Ghafiriyah 9 defected at the instigation of his co-factionists on Uie opposition side, and the Imam ana Isa were obliged to abandon the edition* Biraimi arid Dhaldrat at Jau generally, Iianabi in sect and Ghafiriyah in politics, woulu never tolerate the extension of H&amp;nawiyah and Ib&amp;dhi influence into .hahirat al Sir. In the event of a aahabi invasion in atrangth 1 opine that i^hatiirat al Sir would follow the lead of Dhahirat al Jau, which must submit. but spasmodic zakat collections alone, which represents the present measure of Ibn Baud's interference in the ^nahirah, will not suffice to draw fhahirat al Sir to his allegiance, x.ach small settlement prefers its independence, inclining in times of trouble to some historical local alliance. Thus Ibri has an historical link with the Kiyam tribe of Suleiman bin Komyar. Sulaif looks to the Daru'. Al Araqi had in times t .ast a distarit unuerstanding with a! Hamriyah. Ainain and ; ariz, the only Hinawiyah elements, lean towards the Imam and Isa bin ^alih. -.inain is strategically the Southern gateway of bhahirat al Sir, but Ibri, surpassing even Biraimi, is the great commerci&lt;JL centre and bazaar of the Baduin. WADI Jim. ) There remains the tribal situation of Wadi uiozi. To the foreign invader the open settlements of tiie Dhahirah present an easier and richer reword than these poor and inaccessible mountain settlements. The tribes of the Wadi Ji^zi, kuqabil, ytmud, Viadadna, aushaidat and Jhuv/aiiiis are generally speaking small and relatively un* important, ohafi in religion and Ghafiriyah. Reference has/«K!I«MNUU*&gt;I ha© already been made to their villages (dee Fart !#£&gt;•): but the forwarding of the Air Route may given theai an ijaportance which they otherwise would not have. In the lower : | part of dadi Ji^zi below Khan they oome under Uie jurisdiction 1 of Muscat| above it their independence is rendered nosdLzial by the internecine strife which drives them to seek alliance eJ.U»wr with the IJa'iai or Ban!

(!T f'4 (f) It is understood that the Eo^al Air Force officers are recommending the route Auhi - liahadhah - Abu Ohaoi instead of Sahar - Biraiiai - Abu Dhabi which i© a loiiger distance and lies to the south (see map)* Tribal opposition to the air route falls into two categories (a) coastal (b) interior* The coastal tribes* opposition will in the face of our sea-power break down the moment that it is decided (1) that the Air Route must happen (ii) that co-operation to this end will materially benefit them and that obstruction will materially harm them. Their recent action, calculated to Induct us to despair of the obstacles and abandon the project, is the only card they iiave to play. If and when they see that they have to concede they will concede gracefully. Interior tribal opposition is not so easy* It is bound up with the Ibn Sa’ud question, ibn baud 9 * nebulous position in the Dhahirah will have to crystallise oefore the i aduin tribes can be expected to take a definite line. The question of whether Imperial Air Route interests will best oe served by U) Government recognition of ibn Baud*© position in peninsula Groan* or (b) Ibn Baud*© entire exclusion therefrom* does not come within ray purview. But it can be stated definitely that his present hall and half position there militates against any of the interior tribes co-operat- in&amp; with us. They do not know where they stand# In this connection it would seem that as Ibn Sana can already collect -akat by moral force the present indeterminate position suits him. His own interests do not require his risking tribal opposition by an attempt to obtain complete sovereignty over the area* This has an important bearing on wnat I presume to/to be tbs vital position along the air Houte, n anely the hali‘ way landing ground at Mahadhah in bani Ka*ab country. 2 tentatively sounded bhaiidi 3alii&amp; about the Eoyal Air Force using this place as a landing ground. He said he was friendly disposed but pointed out the difficulties. (i) the Xbn Saud question f and his own fear that he will fall between two stools. (ii) he could never agree to foreign troops being quartered there f or to building© t or any action which would discredit him in the eyes of the Arabs, (iii) he could never agree to Lahadhah being used in operations against Arab tribes. 1 pointed out that these views were based upon a misconception of the objects we sought. As regards the first point, Shaikh ^alim’s opinions deserve attention. His support of the Royal nir Force party when other Dhahirah tribes were rallying to Ibn S&amp;ud's Agent is not likely to have endeared him to Ibn Saud: his opposition to Ibn Saud’s claims in the Dhahirah are well known: to allow B&amp;ni ka'ab territory to be used by our aero- planes is calculated to estrange Ibn Saud still further and result in his being raided by Dhahirah tribes acting unaer instructions. In such circumstances he must walk warily, if, he asks, as a result of satisfying our Air demands he exposes himself to these risk© will Ire afford him assistance or protection in certain eventualities V Si.aikh Halim oexore he is able to agree to our proposal© will therefore want to &amp;now how he stands vis A vis Ibn Saud. If he is satisfied on this point he said he is disposed to agree. Should the Brans-Oman Air Route be decided upon 1 suggest the following monthly subsidies to tribal Shaikhs. Rs« 100 shaikh Salim bin Diyan (and iia'adhid) ior rant of landing/land. i% ground at Imha&amp;hah and protection throughout Band Ka * ab teiTitory # 30 Shaikh nhsi&amp;d bln Abdullah for rent of landing ground at Auhi. 30 i;haikh Salim bin Abdullah for protection in southern hall' of *adi Jl^zi* 30 Shaikh Haradan bin Khalfan for protection in northern half of Wadi Jizzi# Between ahadhah and Abu Jhabi it may be advisable to subsidise * in conjunction with Abu Shabi - one of the Bani Yas Baduin sections 30 Re, per mensem fur protection in case of forced, landings in that area. Over and above this an occasional douceur of Hs.60/ to the Awamir and other Baduin who wander into this area would appear to be advisable. The total cost of this would be aoout ts.3 t 0u0/- per annum%o%e by to lone 1 dated 21st September ,*.934. With rsrsrence to the C .1 *D.meeting ,.-f 13tli instant on the subject of the Blue bine at which it was agreed that, provided Xta S&amp;ud was rsad^' to grant His ajesty ‘s doven-a^ent their desiderata, His Majesty f s Goverment on their side were prepared to negotiate generously with him with regard to the Lin#, i.e. give him substantial concessions east of it* It vas also agreed that a corollary of this policy might be that the large area of indefinite no man's land which at present lias between the territories of our clients (the n.rab bhaikhs of the i ersian Gulf including the Sultan of f uscat) and the Saudi empire might have to disappear j th. t the frontiers of the Arab shaUcMoma mi^it have to be defined drawri on the map (it would be impossible to do so on the ground) | ,«nd that these frontier® and Uiose of the ^audi ifl|pirs would have to be co-teminous * 2. Since the meeting 1 have been giving this question ox frontiers some furthex* consideration, ana have c^e to the conclusion that though these frontier lines will look very nice and neat on the ma^, off the map said in actual working practice they may be a considerable nuisance, if riot a aanger* Frontiers, while necessary elsewhere, in Arabia are merely necessary evils o nly to be drawn wiien unavoidable • The population of the country is nomadic - the tribes wandsrixig considerable distances accoi’ding to the season in search of water and pasture, the average Arab bhtiiih has a very vague idea as to where his territory begins and ends, fcuiu often there ax*e no well -defined physical xeatures along: which a bouxxdar*y could conveniently be placed.

The advantages of the present situation, under which there are no fixed frontiers between the territories of our clients and Ibn Saud's empire, are obvious. -hare tliere are no frontiers there can be no encroachments. If, for iii©t noe, there is raiding and counter-r ? *iding in the ..ruoian hinterland of tlie Truclal Coast, neither our clients iior Ibn ; 3 aud can apply to us. The matter is settled some how or other between the two parties. Once however we draw definite frontiers - in itself a matter of gre ,.t difficulty and involving amongst other features the consent of our clients (including' the Sultan of Muscat, juridically an independent sovereign) * the question will assume quite a different aspect. A raid or an encroachment across a frontier (which however clear on a map will be totally' unintelligible to the tribes on the spot) by Ibn d&amp;uu’s bedouin will be followed by an appeal frm our injurea client 5 while a similar r id or encroachment by one of our clients will be followed by a note from Ibn ud. In these circumstances it seesis probable that we may be engulfed in a iitoraes of complaints and ccunter—cornel tints, the net result of which will be not an entente with Ibn Saud, which is our object, but the reverse. 4* Further ~ the drawing of fixed frontiers might well involve His Majesty’s Government in a measure of responsi bility for protecting Uieir cUonts by land as well as by sea,(except for Kuwait and the contingent assurance recently/recently given to Qatar our dafanaive conBaitments to tn® other Shaikha are limited to the sea only) ♦ Do Hi# M&amp;Jaaty*# Govamment want to ccomit themselves to maint ining the authority of the Trucial Coast Shai^chs up to a line drawn in the InteESor far away from the coast*’ lastly - Ifcn aaud f like the rest of us* must die some day* nobody f X think, knows exactly what will happen when he is gathered to his fathers. 10 meet this eventuality would not a more or less fluid situation be preferable to a static on© V £ # I certainly do not suggest that the difficulties noted above should in any way hold up whatever eteps can now be taken to negotiate an understanding with Xbn baud, but X think they should be borne in mind* 1 think also that it might 'be possible to overcome them. fhile fixed frontiers &amp;r© unavoidable between the Saudi ,*mpire and countries such as Iraq and Transj ordan, 1 doubt whether they are essential o«tween the Trueial Coast rmd the Saudi limpire* It might be possible once in a way to adopt the Arabian point o* view, and ciake the frontiei’S tribal instead of geographic ! t and to say to Xbn bauds not that we agree thut youi'- territory extends up to such slid such imaginary line, out. we agree tn t your authority extends over such ana such tribes* G.

J.O.No.lOOO-S of 1934 The Residency, Bushire, the 1st November ..934• Please refer to my Mote of 21st September ^.934 suggesting, in connection with the Blue Line, that Tribal Boundaries, instead of fixed frontiers on western standards, might be adopted between whatever territories Last of the Blue Line we concede to I bn Baud and those of our clients - the Persian Gulf Shaikhs. 2. In paragraph 6 of that Mote I said that quite possibly Xbn Baud himself might welcome the idea of Tribal Boundaries. I was therefore much interested to learn from Dickson, (when 1 stopped at Kuwait for a few days on my way out), that at the 0jair Conference in x922, when Cox met Ibn Baud for the purpose of settling the Mejd-*Iraq frontier, at which Dickson also was present, Ibn Baud fought very hard for a tribal boundary between the two States. It was not found, possible to arrange this, but conditions as between the territories of the Trueial Coast Shaikhs and Saudi-^rabia are very different to those existing between Saudi-Arabia and 1 1raq, and the fact that Ibn Baud was then in favour of a tribal boundary argues that he would welcome the idea now, provided that after further investigation we can put this proposal forward to him as suiting us. 3.

July 30, 1934. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [E 5064/2429/25] No. 1. Memorandum respecting Anglo-Saudi Relations, as seen by Sir A. Ryan in July 1934. IN my despatch No. 233 of the 20th June, 1931, I discussed Ibn Saud’s attitude in regard to his relations with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, in the light of long conversations which I had had with Fuad Bey Hamza and the King himself. At that time he sought a rapprochement with His Majesty’s Government. He was obsessed by suspicion of the Hashimite rulers and one of his objects was the impossible one of ousting them from the position of special favour accorded to them by His Majesty’s Government. 2. When I returned to England in February 1932 in the special circum stances of the Bakhit slavery case, I attempted to review generally, but systematically, the position as between Ibn Saud and His Majesty’s Government in a memorandum submitted at home on the 23rd February, 1932. Many of the statements and conclusions in that memorandum now call for revision, not so much, I think, because they were erroneous at the time (except in one particular, to which I will revert), as because of many changes in the situation in Arabia since it was written. In one respect, however, the position is similar to that of June 1931. Ibn Saud still sees in His Majesty’s Government the most important foreign factor in the world about him and he again seeks a rapprochement in a spirit of anxious misgiving. I again attempt a general review in the light of my recent conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza and then with the King at Taif, which I am recording separately. 3. I cannot do better than use the same structure as in my memorandum of the 23rd February, 1932, with which I hope that this paper may be compared. (A) Position as regards Various Questions of Interest to His Majesty's Government. 4. In my memorandum of the 23rd February, 1932, I enumerated these questions under twelve heads as follows :— (1) Transjordan frontier question. (2) Persian Gulf questions. (3) Arabian air route. (4) Shell benzine. (5) Other money matters. (6) Pilgrimage. (7) Slavery. (8) Deportation of British subjects and protected persons. (9) Aqaba and Maan. (10) Hejaz Railway. (11) Naval visits. (12) Treatment of foreign representatives in Jedda. 5. Subject to important modifications, the above list of headings still covers all outstanding matters of sufficient importance to affect, or to be capable of affecting, the general relations between His* Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud. The present position in regard to each may be briefly and roughly summed up as follows : — (1) Transjordan Frontier. This has ceased to create any serious difficulty since the conclusion of the Saudi Transjordan Treaty of July 1933. The attitude of the Saudi authorities still gives rise to some local complaint, but there has been no renewal of [156 gg—2] Bcontroversy with the Saudi Government and there is no reason to anticipate any recrudescence of serious trouble, so long as Ibn Saud adheres to his present policy and the Amir Abdullah refrains from embroiling himself in the internal affairs of Saudi Arabia. (2) Persian Gulf Questions. These, on the other hand, have assumed major importance and may now be classified under the following four heads, the last of which is of capital importance to our relations with Ibn Saud :— (a) Koweit Blockade. —No substantial progress has been made with the solution of this problem since February 1932. Now that the Transjordan frontier is out of the way, His Majesty’s Government would like to press for a removal of Ibn Saud’s embargo on trade between Koweit and Nejd. Their action has been hampered by the attitude of the Sheikh of Koweit, notably in regard to his old claims against Ibn Saud. (b) Bahrein Transit Dues. —This question, which is eminently one for a rational business settlement, has been singularly complicated by the Ahmedi incident of about October 1932 and the growth in Ibn Saud’s mind of a belief that His Majesty’s Government are determined, in the interests of Bahrein, to boycott direct trade with the Hasa Coast. The personal resentment shown by the King during my recent visit to Taif gives this aspect of the general question of transit a special importance. (c) Oil. —This has become an important factor in the whole situation in North-Eastern Arabia since the grant of the Hasa Oil Commission to the Standard Oil Company of California. The most immediate matter of common concern to His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud is the proposed concession for the Koweit neutral zone. It is firmly believed by the British authorities in the Persian Gulf that Ibn Saud is also taking a hand in the business of the proposed Qatar concession. (d) The Blue Line.—Th.e oil question was mainly instrumental in directing attention last year to uncertainty in regard to the' frontier of Qatar and by inference to the whole question of the eastern and south-eastern boundaries of Saudi Arabia. After much consideration His Majestv’s Government decided to take their stand on Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914, as establishing a legal position which must be the basis of any discussion with the Saudi Govern ment, to whom they would be prepared to make some concessions, but only minor concessions. Ibn Saud’s reaction has been not less violent than was to be expected He has begun by asserting, on legal and historical grounds, claims to territory tcir beyond tne blue line established by the Anglo-Xurkish Conventions (3) Arabian Air Route. Further efforts since February 1932 to obtain certain facilities from Ibn ^aud m respect of the Hasa Coast ended last year in a deadlock. Ibn Saud was prepared m principle to grant the facilities, but on exorbitant money terms. The amount which His Majesty s Government was prepared to pay was not such as could possibly attract a ruler so jealous of his sovereign rights We have been livmg from hand to mouth, reducing what are technically violations of his b 3 fp rc ed landings and flying over to a minimum and apologising for them before the baudi Government have time to protest. This has worked well stick^wiVHis^aieX^r ^ kSt aS { \^ S UOt Suited Ibn Saud to be sticky with His Majesty s Government over small matters.

My despatches set forth the pros and cons of a deal on those lines, eD r which, on the whole, I favour.

There has been no essential change since February 1932 in regard to this question. It looked last year as though Ibn Saud might seek to reopen it as soon as the Treaty of Jedda became denunciable in March 1934. More recent indications have shown that, while anxious to maintain the reservations he made from in 1927, he realises that it would be useless and impolitic to reopen the question Saud at present. On the other hand, the completion of new maps of the frontier area inns. ma y create an awkward situation for His Majesty’s Government, if it should lotsuc be found necessary to seek Ibn Saud’s consent to a modification of the de facto havet r frontier between Transjordan and the Hejaz.

His Majesty’s Government are considering the matter sympathetically in consultation with the French Government. ^ ffih (11) Naval Visits. !S havf There has been no change in the position since February 1932. The Bed Sea are sloops continue to visit Jedda four or five times a year, after the Legation has limstf'notified the Saudi Government, without, however, asking for permission for the it claU visits. They do not attempt to visit other ports, including-, by an elucidation of i diretl Arabia. This limits the b 24 freedom of action of the sloops, but is not attended by an^ Last year the Saudi Government spoke of enacting general regulations o visits: but they have not so far taken any definite action m this sense. (12) Treatment of Foreign Representatives. J The position described in my memorandum of the 23rd February, 1932, remains unaltered in essentials, but there has been some improvemen ^ ^ ^1 of detail The Saudi Ministry for Foreign Aftans has been somewhat strengthened and, though its remoteness from Jedda still causes inconvenience, opportunities for oral discussion are afforded more frequently and somewhat more regularly. There had been breaches in the practice of confining European foreign representatives to Jedda, the most important being my rec ^ n ^ vl ^ t H Taif°by invitation, and the King’s expression of hope that he would be able to receive me in Riadh also. There has been less inclination to head the Legation off representations on behalf of British Moslems. On the other hand, the Saudil Government are again playing with the idea of making distinctions between diplomatic and consular officers. I gathered this from a personal conversation with Fuad Bey some weeks ago, when he was inclined to insist that the distinctio^ must be made, though he inferred that non-diplomatic officers would not necessarily be deprived of certain privileges, e.g., customs immunity. I urged him to let' well alone, and his illness deprived me of any opportunity of exploring the matter further. We must be prepared, sooner or later, for attempts to curtail the verv extensive privileges at present enjoyed by all members of the Legation staff, attempts which it may be difficult to resist, but which, in the conditions of Jedda, would have extremely inconvenient consequences. I add one general heading in substitution for (8), viz. :— (13) Attitude of the Saudi Government towards Moslem British Subjects and Protected Persons. This problem has grown in importance since 1932, owing to the increasing indications of a drive on the part of the Saudi Government to reduce certain foreign elements in their country, especially such as tend to over-populate the towns, and, in particular, Mecca, with nondescripts. Broadly speaking, it may be said that their policy is less open to criticism than the methods employed in their spasmodic attempts to give effect to it. The growth of xenophobia, however, directs attention to the lack of any droit d’etablissement whatsoever. I have dealt with the whole subject at length in a recent despatch to the Foreign Office. 6. If any general settlement of outstanding questions with the Saudi Government was attempted, it would be necessary to ensure the completeness of the above list, but it certainly omits nothing of first-class importance bearing on their relations with His Majesty’s Government. So far as British interests are concerned, the most important at present are those under heads (2), (3) and (7); and, in a less degree, (6), as regards dispensaries, (12) as regards diplomatic and consular privileges, and (13). Ibn Saud, on his side, attaches supreme importance to (2) {d), and considerable importance to (2) (b) and (c), to (7) as regards manumission, and to (10). (B) Position of Ibn Saud. 7. In my memorandum of the 23rd February, 1932, I said that “ Ibn Saud is almost certainly on the down grade.” This estimate has been falsified by his good luck on various occasions since then, and still more by the good management which has enabled him to take advantage of his luck.’ Were his financial position more assured, he would now be in a very strong position thanks to his repression of the revolts in the Northern Hejaz and Asir in 1932, his success in avoiding serious trouble with elements which might be tempted to turn against him in Nejd, and by his conduct of his quarrel with the Imam Yahya, in the last stages of which he renounced any idea of conquering the Yemen, but established a legal title to the whole of Asir and Nejran and sterilised, probably for a long time to come, if not for ever, the influence of the Idrisis.5 1 1 ! 1 mati o%; veniti 0 %- -visit «alt Lea he Sat beti versa! istinct; ould; I uri exploit to cars Legati onditia jects i ncreas :e cerii ulate ; o' it i rv 1111 ployed howK .

It is worth while to run through the reasons I gave in my memorandum of the 231'd February, 1932, for the then apparent deterioration of Ibn Sand’s political position :— (a) The administration of the Hejaz has not become less efficient, and has perhaps somewhat improved. There are fewer internal signs of discontent with the Saudi regime than there were in 1931. It cannot be called popular, but some at least of the tribes are too broken to think of resistance, the townsmen seem more resigned, and some of them have an increasing interest in the stability of the present regime. ^ (fi) Such general indications as afford a criterion suggest that Ibn Sand has strengthened his position vis-a-vis the extreme Wahhabi opponents of modern ideas. It is impossible to form any exact estimate, but the King has shown more boldness in various directions, and less is heard of the Ulama of Nejd. In 1932 he was able to make good use of the Ikhwan, without letting them get out of hand. _ . (c) Ibn Sand’s isolation in the Arab world is less pronounced than it was. He has learnt to control his hatred, if not his suspicion, of the Hashimites. Care fully nurtured sympathy with him seems to abound in Palestine and in Syria, perhaps also in more independent Arab countries. The unexpected death of King Feisal last year has removed his most conspicuous rival in the Arab world. His^display of moderation in his final settlement with the Imam has advertised him as a man who is first and foremost a good Arab, all the more so as other good Arabs, like the would-be mediators, headed by the Grand Mufti of Palestine, have been enabled to claim an unearned share of the credit. He has, in fact, discreetly avoided any appearance of a desire to dominate the Arab world too exclusively and has beaten with all the more effect the Moslem Arab drum. (d) Remaining himself a good but not extreme Wahhabi, Ibn Saud has tended to show greater tolerance towards Moslems of other denominations, both Sunni and Shia. He divides the sympathies of non-Arab Moslems generally, hut he has probably more admirers in countries like India, and perhaps the Dutch East Indies, than he had some years ago. Even in Egypt, the third largest contributor to the pilgrimage, there is a strong tendency to criticise King Fuad s policy of holding him at arm’s length. '(e) Ibn Sand is still isolated from the general life of the family ot non- Moslem nations. Even here, however, there are signs of a readiness on his part to increase his intercourse with individual nations; and. though the signs a.i e small, they may foreshadow a process capable of considerable acceleration in the more favourable conditions which would result from a consolidation of his position in Arabia. He has realised that he must look west for any serious help in developing his resources, witness the grant of the Hasa Oil Concession to the Americans and his readiness to treat with Europeans for the grant of other concessions. (f) He is still poor in competent advisers on other than purely Arab affairs. There have been no notable additions to the list, but the men he has have giown somewhat in stature. His Minister of Finance has learnt the useful lesson that, while old debts may be put on the long finger, current liabilities must be met, if credit is to be maintained. Payments in respect of immediate transactions have been much more punctual of late. Fuad Bey Hamza is a doubtful factoi. He has advanced in the art of diplomacy, but he does not seem to enjo\ the full confidence of Ibn Sand, and his own heart-searchings in quest of a larger life may sweep him out of the King’s service. Should he remain in it and letain his health, he is capable of rendering much service as a liaison between Saudi Arabia and the modern world. Even Sheikh Yussuf Yasin has achieved more elasticity- Some other less well-known men have also come on, like Muhammad Tawil. a Hejazi, whom Ibn Saud has used successfully in Hasa, and perhaps the Ibn Muammai, a Nejdi, who represents him in Bagdad. 9. Ibn Saud has shown no further signs of physical decline. He has grown somewhat lethargic in his habits; but he looks fit, lives a health}' life, especially in Nejd, no longer overeats (if, indeed, there was truth in the Sheikh of Koweit s suggestion that he used to), and imposes his will on his adviseis in all major matters. Even the story current some time ago of his impotence seems to have been exaggerated, as he has had a son within the last few months. 10. It would be going far beyond the mark to suggest that the future ot the Saudi regime is assured, but Saudi Arabia offers at least as much prospect of fl56 gg—21 B ^ istability as it has done at any time in the recent past and there is no reason why Ibn Sand should not long hold his own, unless he should prefei to abdicate m favour of his heir, still an almost unknown quantity. , i i , 11. One of the most notable features of Ibn Baud S policy m the last two years has been his anxiety for settlements calculated to ensure the future of his regime. He has been at pains to seek compositions with his neighbours, to disarm the hostility of internal enemies, e.g., by tying to his service the son^ o ormer adversaries, and to secure, as far as he can do in his own lifetime, the succession| to the throne of his eldest son, with the consent of the rest^of the f ami y. e may still be attracted by the idea of an ultimate extension ol Saudi power m Aiabia, but for the moment he seems to be content with a position of pre-eminence among Arab rulers; to have eschewed further territorial ambitions, and to be wooing the elusive nymph, Security. And, as I have already indicated, he sees m good relations with His Majesty’s Government the primary external factor in his| security. Hence his present eagerness to induce them to guarantee in some way his position vis-a-vis Iraq and the position of both vis-a-vis neighbouring non- Arab States like Turkey and Persia. Hence, too, his extreme discomfiture at seeing His Majesty’s Government spring their blue-line policy on him shortly after they had come to terms with the Yemen, and while he himself was still engaged in a doubtful conflict with that country. He mistrusts and fears more than he loves them, and he would be more than human if he realised fully that that was a mere coincidence. (C) Position of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. 12. The list of outstanding questions in section (A) above is less formidable than its length would suggest. The general relations between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud have, in fact, improved materially in the last three years. They are now threatened more seriously by the ‘ ‘ blue line '' than by any other subject of difference. 13. I cannot personally believe in the undoubted legal validity of the “ blue line.” It appears to me that in 1915 and in 1927 His Majesty’s Government were content to treat Qatar, the Trucial Sheikhdoms and Muscat and Oman as conter minous with Ibn Sand’s dominions, whatever the boundaries. So far as Qatar is concerned, it seems to me that the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 itself proceeded on that assumption, and that the “ blue line ” was conceived as an arbitrary boundary between Qatar territory and Nejd. When it was recently decided not to assert the sovereignty of the Sheikh of Qatar so far west, I myself preferred the expression ” British sphere of influence ” to the expression cc Qatar sphere of influence ’ ’; but I do not think it can be seriously maintained that Great Britain has a sphere of influence in Eastern Arabia, except in the sense that her influence extends to the coastal principalities up to their territorial limits, what ever these may be. 14. It appears to me further that the Anglo-Saudi Treaty of December 1915 destroyed the validity of the “ blue line ” by substituting a new criterion for the determination of Ibn Saud s boundaries. He was to be recognised as independent within his ancestral limits. These limits may conceivably have lain west of the £( blue line.”. This appears to be Colonel Towle’s latest contention, but I have not seen his paper on the subject. The limits may have lain east of the “ blue line, as Ibn Saud contends, invoking in support of his claim the proceedings of the Belly mission, the records of which I have not seen either. My point is that the 191o fieaty imposed on His Majesty s Government an obligation to accept the ancestral limits in due course as determining the boundary and implied that the coastal principalities extended up to this boundary. I have toyed with the argument that the treaty of 1915 imposed limitations on Ibn Saud’s sovereignty and that the treaty of 1927, which removed those limitations, again altered the whole position and re-entitled His Majesty’s Government to rely on the “blue line on the ground that Ibn Saud was no longer negotiating as‘a rebel against Turkish authority, but as the ruler of a succession State. 15. This argument, however, carries no conviction in my own mind If it corresponds with what His Majesty’s Government believed to be the position in 192,, they might well have been expected to make it clear, instead of which they made no lefeience to the blue line, and again treated the coastal principalities7 )( licate 'lastt* oft to di S2c } t fori 'Uccesiir Hei- 1 Aral oo amo' o wool s in ffnjj Mint 5omeiri: 'ing n ifitnrej n shoni Mas sir nd fear, sed f# m. r: lajestr ast tk q by re “bln ent W: 3 contei Qatar: l 3 itsei id as i recent!; I mysf! “ Qatr at Gref that k is, what ber 1; i fortli st of tt 11 ba^ ie “bk idingse: it is tb ccept tb that tb ^itb tb •ereiga 1 : :ered tb agaitk rich tk dpali® as though they were Ibn Saud ! s neighbours. The argument would be stronger, if it could be shown that when the Nejd-Koweit frontier was redrawn in 1922, Ibn Baud explicitly admitted the validity of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as a starting-point, but I have no record in Jedda of the negotiations regarding the Nejd-Koweit boundary. 16. Whatever the legal position, the political considerations are of much greater moment. I am convinced that Ibn Baud will never admit that the Turks had any right to dispose of territories over which, he affirms, his Arab ancestors ruled, and which had, in his view, been simply usurped, partly by the Turks and partly by Ibn Rashid. Hatred of the Turks is in his blood, and he will accept no position, however sustained by legal argument, which rests on an eoc post facto recognition of their rights. One might as well expect Mr. de Valera to swallow Pope Adrian’s bull. 17. Nor will Ibn Baud waive his claim to jurisdiction over tribes like the Murra, who may or may not have submitted to his ancestors, but who have been within his sphere of influence and no other for many years. However great his desire for a rapprochement with His Majesty’s Government he will be at least as insistent on his claim to a great part of the hinterland of the Trucial coast as he has been on his claim to Najran, which, until the Imam admitted it, rested on similar foundations. He may accept a compromise, but not a compromise turning on a minor modification of the “blue line,” or a compromise involving the recognition of a British sphere in the interior of Arabia, distinct from their sphere as quasi-protectors of the coastal States. If he recognised the existence of such a distinct British sphere, he would go down to Arab history as one of the lost leaders. 18. I do not think I exaggerate when I say that the future relations of His Majesty’s Government with Ibn Baud will depend very largely on their attitude in regard to this question. If we take the possible course of shelving it on the basis that each side reserves its position, he will remain with a rankling sense of injury. In my opinion the issue must be faced, and His Majesty’s Government must choose between a more or less open breach with Ibn Baud or a generous settlement with him. 19. I have throughout regretted the unwillingness of His Majesty’s Govern ment to admit frankly to Ibn Baud that their interest in the area in dispute is due largely to its oil potentialities. He himself undoubtedly realises this, but has been too canny to raise the question of his own initiative. His interest is to assert territorial claims over an area which has been left indeterminate. That of His Majesty’s Government, as I see it, is to show cause why it has become important to define the position in that area, and the best way to do so would be to discuss frankly the economic reasons for doing so. 20. In Part (C) of my memorandum of the 23rd February, 1932, I reviewed three possible policies in regard to the questions then outstanding between His Majesty’s Government, and Ibn Baud. They were in a nutshell: {a) positive support; (b) friendly laissez-faire; and (c) stiffness all along the line. On the whole, I favoured laissez-faire, and, on the whole, that policy has been followed, except as regards the Transjordan frontier question. I am now inclined to favour a more constructive policy, the corner-stone of which would be a generous settlement of the “blue line” question. The expiration of the original period of the Treaty of Jedda and Ibn Baud’s recent expression of a desire for “conversations” provide an opportunity for seeking a fairly comprehensive understanding with him, if it should suit His Majesty’s Government to enter into one. 21. The form and scope of such an understanding would require careful consideration. As regards the form, we might contemplate a treaty and annexes to be substituted for the Treaty of Jedda, a supplementary treaty or a series of exchanges of notes. As regards the scope I suggest tentatively the following points for consideration :— (i) His Majesty’s Government very naturally ruled out any sort of an alliance, and would presumably find it equally impossible to guarantee the security of Ibn Baud. They have, however, fore shadowed, subject to a satisfactory settlement of certain questions, a formula giving expression to the special nature of their relations with him. It might achieve his object to some extent, if the suggestedunderstanding were made operative for a longisli period, say fifteen or twenty years, and affirmed the readiness of His Majesty's Govern ment to use their endeavours to preserve the status quo m Arabia, subject to their undertaking no military commitment and not inter vening, except by way of good offices, in any dispute betv een Arabian rulers, neither party to which was in special relations with them as regards its foreign relations. Whether they would go further and meet Ibn Baud to the extent of promoting a security pact of some sort between him and Iraq is a question beyond my competence. (ii) The understanding might define the boundaries within which His Majesty’s Government recognise the sovereign independence of Ibn' Baud, subject to any agreements which may be entered into between the Arab Governments concerned. These boundaries would be: The present frontier between Saudi Arabia and Iraq; the present boundary between Nejd and Transjordan, with, perhaps, some definition of the status of places close to it like, e.g., Hazim; a readjusted de facto or, if possible, de jure frontier between the Hejaz and Transjordan; the boundary recently established by treaty between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen; a line corresponding to the Anglo-Turkish violet and blue lines, but well to the south-east and east of them, so as to include in Ibn Baud’s territories the Diras of the Murra, Manasir and other named tribes, and to avoid the creation of a distinct British sphere behind the States on the Persian Gulf coast, whose authority would be held to extend up to the new line, subject to any arrangements arrived at between these States under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government; and the existing Nejd- Koweit boundary, modified, perhaps, by a division of the neutral zone. (iii) It might be agreed, though it would be difficult to obtain Ibn Saud s consent to this, that economic concessions between the blue and violet lines and the new line should be granted only to groups composed in equal parts of interests nominated by His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud respectively. (iv) Assurances might be given to Ibn Saud that His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Government of Bahrein will not attempt^ directly or indirectly to impede direct shipments of goods to the Hasa coast, subject to the unfettered right of the Bahrein Government to levy transit dues at such rates as they may decide on goods for Nejd landed in Bahrein or transhipped in Bahrein waters. (v) A settlement of the Koweit blockade question might be made an essential condition of the understanding. (vi) The understanding might bind Ibn Saud to give reasonable facilities for landing in and flying over the coastal strip of Hasa in case of need, subject to an undertaking not to fly inland without special sanction from Ibn baud and to payment of a reasonable annual rent, in recognition of Ibn Baud’s sovereign rights. If the understanding were for fifteen or twenty years, this rent might possibly be met in anticipation by a remission of the Saudi Government debts to His Majesty’s Government. (vii) His Majesty s Government might abandon the right of manumission as from the promulgation by Ibn Saud of a public act on lines to be communicated to His Majesty’s Government, unofficially but for their approval, in the course of the negotiations. (viii) The understanding might define the position in regard to the Hejaz Kailway m the light of any arrangements that may be contemplated, m consultation with the French Government, during the next four months. &amp; i 'p- suggestion would not, except as regards head (i), involve any real departure from the principle hitherto followed by His Majesty’s Government of dealing with each outstanding question on its merits. What it amounts to is a proposal that we should explore the possibility of effecting a simultaneous now^^tstanding ° nglSil number mdlv i (iua l questions of importance, which are) 9 %’sgJ 10 n dnoi t J SOBii, nee. 1 whid Pender entered' 23. Whether the understanding should cover any other points like Govern ment of India dispensaries, diplomatic and consular privileges, treatment of British subjects, most-favoured-nation treatment, &amp;c., would depend a good deal on whether it took the form of a new general treaty or some other form, which would leave the main text of the Treaty of Jedda intact, though not all of the annexed letters.

August 3, 1934. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 5063/2429/25] No. 1. Record of Conversations during^ Sir A. Ryan’s Visit to Taif, July 12-14, 1934.— (Received in Foreign Office, August 3.) WHEN Sheikh Yussuf Yasin met me outside the town on the 12th July, he spoke to me briefly about the King’s reasons for wishing to see me. In the first place, the King had received other foreign representatives in Taif, and he wished to see also the British representative. Indeed, he hoped for an opportunity of receiving me at Riadh as well, where he had seen no British representatives for a long time, although he had met them elsewhere. The King also wished to take this opportunity of explaining his views on certain matters, notably the position to the north of his country, with special reference to Iraq, and the question of his frontiers. I expressed my gratitude to His Majesty for having enabled me to see him at Taif, and said that I had taken the instructions of my Government immediately on receiving his invitation, and had been directed to ascertain the King s views on the matters that interested him, in order to be able to report on them at home. My Government had drawn my special attention to two matters, one of which Sheikh Yussuf had mentioned, viz., frontiers, the other that of Saudi relations with Koweit. 2. My audience with the King in the evening of the 12th July was almost entirely formal. On my thanking the King for his invitation and all the kindness I had been shown, he referred very pointedly to his hope of seeing me in Riadh also, perhaps after next Ramadan, if the rains were good. The only other matter of interest mentioned was the fact that the return of the heir apparent was delayed, as Seyfal Islam Ahmed had been prevented from completing the return of hostages by trouble with rebellious Yemeni tribes. I gathered from Mr. Philby later in the evening that the news of trouble inland in the Yemen had created some stir in high Saudi circles. Incidentally, Mr. Philby spoke as an unrepentant critic of the recent peace settlement and a non-believer in its permanence. He believed still that the King had got some money payment and an assurance that the administration of the Yemen Tihama would be left in the hands of Abdullah-al-Wazir for not less than a year. 3. Sheikh Yussuf Yasin called on me at 8 a.m. on the 13th July, in accordance with my suggestion that we should have a talk before I discussed serious affairs with the King. I gave him a general outline of my instructions, emphasising the readiness of His Majesty’s Government to cement their relations with Ibn Saud, their belief that a closer relationship could best be attained by the friendly settlement of outstanding questions, of which the most important were those mentioned above; their willingness to engage in conversations about these questions; and their wish to be informed as to the King’s desiderata. I tried to sound Sheikh Yussuf as to whether Fuad Bey could be empowered to hold conversations in London, saying that, if so, His Majesty’s Government had expressed readiness to hear him, or whether the Saudi Government would prefer that the questions should be discussed on my return, after preparation in the interval. Sheikh Yussuf thanked me for my statement and mv assurances of the friendly dispositions of His Majesty’s Government, but said that, as the King wished to see me early and could not keep me after 10 a.m., he preferred not to comment on what I had said. He delivered a message from the King, asking me to convey to His Majesty’s Government and the naval authorities an expression of his appreciation of the helpful attitude of the commanders of the Red Sea sloops during the occupation of Hodeida. I responded suitably, saying that the reports of the officers in question had contained constant references to the gracious kindness of the Amir Feisal and the excellence of their relations with Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, &amp;c. [181 c 1] B2 4. The King received me at 9 a.m. I was accompanied as before by Mr. Furlonge and Ismail Effendi, who interpreted, bheikh lussuf Yasm was I m attendance^ compliment ^ j gaid that my Government had wished me to take the first opportunity of expressing to the King m person the great pleasure with which they had heard of the Saudi-Yemen settlement and their sense of the wisdom which His Majesty had shown in dealing with that matter. I he King! observed that he desired peace with all his neighbours, firstly, because they were! Arabs, and secondly, because there was nothing to divide them. Kelymg, as ne always did, on the friendship of His Majesty’s Government, he had sought their advice. It accorded with his own views, and he had acted on it. I said tnatl His Majesty’s Government believed the settlement to be m the best interest ot Arabia and gave the credit for it to the King, who had shown himness, and hadi known how to show moderation as well in the last phase. ) 6. The King’s repeated affirmation of his friendship for His Majesty s Government gave me the opportunity of saying that it was a primary point in my instructions that I was to reaffirm their friendly dispositions, which were unchanged and unchangeable, towards him and his country. I referred to the importance of removing all possible obstacles to complete friendship by settling certain questions, and to the wish of His Majesty’s Government to be informed as to the desiderata of the King. 7. The King started with the subject of Iraq. His statements were long and involved, but his drift was clear. He thought that all the Arab States needed some outside Power to rely on, and, though there were other friends, that Power should be Great Britain, who was in close relations with all of the States concerned. He was worried lest Iraq, the strongest of the Arab States, should be attacked by Turkey and/or Persia, and lest he should be menaced through Iraq as a result. He observed that he was currently supposed to be hostile to the ruling family of Iraq, but the truth was that he had nothing against them. He desired their interest as well as his own. If the arrangements between His Majesty’s Government and Iraq were such as to secure Iraq against the attacks he feared, he would be easy in his mind. When Fuad Bey had spoken of an Arab alliance, he had had in mind some arrangement between Iraq and Saudi Arabia to ensure their mutual safety. The King intimated that he would like to see some such arrangement arrived at under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government, the friend of both. 8. 1 explained that my conversations with Fuad Bey, which had not been completed owing to his illness, had not carried us quite as far as the King suggested, e.g., he had not used the word “alliance” in connexion with Iraq. I was all the more anxious to ascertain the King’s exact meaning, in order that I might convey his ideas in a definite form to my Government. I gathered from his statement that he had in mind three possible things in connexion with the dangers he feared : (a) He had said that he would be easy in his mind, if assured that the arrangements between His Majesty’s Government and Iraq sufficed to safeguard the latter; (6) he had spoken of the possibility of some sort of alliance or defensive treaty between him and Iraq; (c) he had spoken as though he contemplated some sort of an alliance to which His Majesty’s Government could be a party. 9. The King did not demur to my analysis. After some further exchanges, I observed that point (c) was the only one on which I could speak. His Majesty’s Government were animated in regard to the Arab States by a desire to see them prosper and by the friendly sentiments of which we had spoken, but it was contrary to their general policy to enter into alliances except in very special cases. Their treaty with Iraq was defined as a “ Treaty of Alliance,” but that alliance was the resultant of a process by which Iraq had evolved from her Turkish provincial status, through British occupation and subsequent dependence on His Majesty s Government, to hei present position. This was a special case, and that of Saudi Arabia presented no analogy, for the simple reason that Ibn Sand had never been dependent on Great Britain. Great Britain had created Iraa. The King had created himself. at • &gt; r ^ le sa id that he was not insisting on an alliance with His Majesty s Government. Their firm friendship was as good as any alliance He redefined his ideas m terms which amounted to this : that he would like to come to an arrangement with Iraq, under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government,f &gt; w 1C f s ^ an( ^ t°g e ther, and which would be supported by an under- taking to be subscribed to by both the parties, that they would not stand against brreat Britain or support any Power who went against her. He considered that such an arrangement would achieve his own object and would serve the interests ot His Majesty s Government. 11 - 3 ' 3( ? I called on the Amir Khalid, as Acting President of the Council I his visit was purely formal. The Prince was shy but self-possessed, and made mild efforts at conversation. ./ r &gt; r r King received me again at 4 p.m. After compliments, I said that 1 hoped for a further expression of his views. He replied that he had nothing more o say. In view of what Sheikh Yussuf had told me, this was obviously merely a device for throwing on us the onus of initiating the discussion of the nontiei question I therefore said that one of the outstanding questions which His Majesty s Government desired to see settled was that of his eastern boundaries. I explained how convinced His Majesty’s Government were that i J nru kfb 8 . 18 was that resulting from the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 191d-14. ihe King, I said, now ruled what had been a part of the Ottoman hunpire, and had succeeded to the position of the former Turkish Government If this thesis, to which His Majesty’s Government held strongly, was admitted, they would be prepared to consider modifications of the legal frontier. I must however, make it clear that what they had in view was minor modifications, a qualification rendered necessary by the comprehensiveness of the claims put forward m the last Saudi note in regard to Qatar and the country towards Muscat and Oman. 13. This started the King in a most vehement statement. Catching on to the mention of Qatar, Muscat and Oman, he said that he might well claim all these places as realty his. He scouted the idea that the coastal principalities represented true sovereignties. They owed their existence to people who came from over the sea for trading purposes. He was not, however, he explained care- ruliy, claiming them now, as he had entered into an agreement with His Majesty’s Government regarding them. He was not going back on that agreement, even though his rule would be welcomed in the coastal areas themselves He merely cited the more extensive claims, which would be justified but for that agreement, m support of what he did claim, viz., authority over tribes like the Murra, an authority extending from Dhafra all the way, I gathered, to the hinterland of Oman. He denied the justice of the attitude of His Majestv’s Government even though they should insist on it, and he should be compelled to yield. 14. I cannot reproduce in an exact form what the King said, but the foregoing paragraph gives the main lines of his thesis, which, as regards his ancestral claims, he supported by the following arguments, interspersed in his discourse :— ty) His histoiical claim to Qatar, Muscat and Oman, which he had renounced, was borne out by what had passed between one of his predecessors and Colonel Pelly. He spoke of a treaty or agreement as having been reached at that time. He was obviously speaking from general recollection, and was not even certain of Colonel Felly’s exact name, but he was quite positive that Colonel Felly had recognised a very extensive Saudi authority. (b) When Jasim and Ahmed-bin-Thani of Qatar had quarrelled (perhaps some forty years ago, but no exact date was mentioned), one of them had appealed to the then Ibn Saud for assistance, and the then Ibn Sand had composed the quarrel. (c) He admitted that in his early days, Ibn Rashid had held Riadh and the Turks, Hasa. Even then Turkish authority did not extend further They had never ruled the Murra, &amp;c., and had at one moment requested him to use his authority over the tribes, whereupon he had sent persons, whom he named, to control them. He denied absolutely the right of the Turks to alienate his ancestral rights. 15. I observed that the King had himself come to an agreement with the Turks, by which he recognised their sovereignty. He did not deny this, but said that what he had done had been done under British advice ’oiven by Captain Shakespear, presumably under instructions. &amp; [181 c— 1] B 216. Towards the end the King expressed his surprise learmngthat the Turks had agreed to alienate rights, which were no m onvent j ons i sa i^ denied all knowledge until recently of the Anglo- v An^lo-Turkish Con- that surely the Saudi Government had been aware „ specifically in vention o/1913, which, if I remembered rightly, was referred ^spe^cally m Convention of 1922.

I promised to report all that he had said. audience ended at 5-30 p.m. , i ^ + i-n 18. Shortly after 6 Sheikh Yussuf called on me to break the news that the King wished to give us presents. I am dealing separately with this. 19. We dined with the King at 6 • 30. He was in the best of form before and during dinner; chaffed Mr. Philby over his unwillingness to adopt the Royal suggestion that he should take a wife; expounded his own views as to the excellence of matrimony up to the extreme limits allowed by the holy law; and spoke freely of the way in which he was served by the sons of his former enemies. He laughed at reports in the press that one of the Beni Rashid was raising the Shammer against him, when the person named and others of that family were with his sons at the front. All the sons of Dawish, he said, were also at the front. 20. He started on business again about 7-30. I broached the question of the King’s relations with Koweit, the adjustment of which was strongly desired by His Majesty’s Government with special reference to the desirability of ending the present restriction on trade between Koweit and Nejd. A proposal, I observed, had been made quite a long time ago to seek a basis of settlement, but it had been held up by the question of the claims of the Sheikh of Koweit, a matter which also required settlement. The King expressed eagerness for a settlement of the blockade question on a basis of reciprocity. I asked what he meant; whereupon he developed, not very clearly, various views as to the effect of different prices for commodities in Nejd and Koweit and of smuggling. He said that he could not agree to customs posts on the frontier, as they would cost more than they would produce in the way of revenue, and smuggling would still go on. I suggested that the control exercised by his blockade officer, A1 Bagawi, seemed to be pretty effective, and that A1 Bagawi might be better employed in collecting revenue than in stopping trade. The King was not impressed by this, but, finally, said that he would welcome a meeting of representatives of himself and the sheikh to devise a settlement. He did not revert to the question of the sheikh's claims. I preferred not to carry the discussion further in view of the sheikh’s attitude since the meeting of commissioners was first proposed. 21. I asked the King generally how he wished our discussion to be followed up. I was not very clear, I said, as to the plans of Fuad Bey Hamza. If Fuad Bey was coming to London and was authorised to express His Majesty’s views, he would have an opportunity of doing so, while I was at home. Alternatively, the ground might be prepared during my absence for the final handling of the questions on my return from leave. The King said that Fuad Bey was to spend a month in Paris and would be able to speak for him in London. He suggested that I should report our discussions at Taif and that any expression of His Majesty’s Government’s views should be conveyed to his Government, whereupon Fuad Bey would be instructed. I pointed out that this would take time and the King presently agreed to my counter-suggestion that Fuad Bey should be acquainted with what had passed at Taif, and should be instructed at once as to the line on which he should pursue the discussion in London. 22. At this point I said that, although there were other outstanding questions, I did not wish to trouble His Majesty personally with them, and Iproceeded to make a suitable little speech of farewell. After hearing it, the King said he had something further to speak about. His Majesty’s Government were worried about restrictions on trade with Koweit. What of restrictions on trade with Nejd ? I asked what he meant and found that he referred to the action taken at Bahrein in regard to direct shipments to the Hasa Coast, and was under the impression that “the Government” had prohibited such shipments. On my asking whether he meant His Majesty’s Government or the Bahrein Government he laughed scornfully at the mention of the latter. I said that I knew of only one incident, in which the Bahrein Government had taken action to prevent an abuse of the facilities afforded by Bahrein, by a ship which had tried to take advantage of these facilities to land cargo at Bahrein and so lighten herself sufficiently to be able to land cargo on the Hasa coast, where the ports were not equipped to receive cargoes in the ordinary way. I observed that the ship had proceeded before the matter could be referred to higher authority, but that His Majesty’s Government had subsequently proposed a discussion of the whole subject of transit, including that of direct shipments to the mainland. The Saudi Govern ment had rejected this proposal, and, on receipt of a further communication from the Legation, had transferred the negotiations to London, with the result that I had not been concerned in them for nearly two years. 23. The King was insistent that no obstacles should be placed in the way of direct shipment to his ports. If it was a question of port equipment, he said, he could complete the equipment in two months, but what would be the good, if ships were prevented from taking cargo to Has Tanura? And why should that port be treated differently from Debai, Basra or any other port ? He asked for an assurance that, if he did equip Ras Tanura, ships should not be prevented from going there. Indeed, at one moment he asked that they should be told to go there, to which I replied that His Majesty’s Government could not in normal times direct the movements of ships. I pressed him on the subject of the alleged prohibition and at last elicited the admission that he could not substantiate the allegation, though he still evidently thought that an adverse attitude was being taken up. I promised to report what he said, but adhered to my own view that the Saudi Government would have done better to fall in with the proposal of His Majesty’s Government for a general discussion with the object of reconciling the interest of Bahrein and the mainland by an agreement, which could, if necessary, be made operative for a fixed time. 24. The chief interest of this discussion was the revelation it afforded of the King’s bitter personal resentment. He threw out references which I did not understand, to other countries like Japan, &amp;c., and their attitude towards similar problems. He clung to his grievance long after the latest hour at which he told me he could say his prayers. It was well after 9 when I was able to leave him. 25. Shortly before 10, Sheikh Yussuf called again to deliver the Arab clothes, which I had consented to receive. At 4 a.m. next day he was on the spot once more to see me off. I delayed my departure a short time for a final word about the Bahrein question. I said I had been impressed by the King’s anxiety to treat the question of direct shipments as a separate issue. I did not wish LIis Majesty to think that I had been difficult the previous evening, and assured him that on my return to London I would go into the whole matter. 26. The foregoing account of my conversation at Taif is accurate on all main points, but is not an exact record of all that passed, s.cj-, as regards the sequence of the individual discussions. For one thing my interpreter was far from well, and the King tried him very high, by delivering long speeches, impossible to render in all their details after he had let himself go. I have omitted various non-essentials, e.g., the King, when foreshadowing future trouble in Northern Arabia, referred to conversations with Captain Shakespear, in which he had similarly foreshadowed the Great ^War; and, in piofessing his friendship for His Majesty’s Government, he described his confidence in them as being unaffected by the suggestion of Turks and otheis that His Majesty s Government were, in reality, hostile to him. . . 27. The general impression I derived was that the King is genuinely desirous of consolidating his position vis-a-vis of His Majesty's Government but is extremely bitter over certain recent aspects of their policy, notably their attempt to impose on him the “blue line.” He is almost equally bitter over the Bahrein question, because all that he has grasped of it is the appearance in his eyes of an attempt to boycott his endeavours to develop Ras Tanura and to keephim in a sort of dependence. I gathered from conversations with Mr. Philby on mv return iourney the next day that the King had sat up rather later than usua with his intimates after my departure, and had spoken at large m a tone of excited indignation, about those two questions. Mr. Philby, him ather excited, said that the King had expressed his firm determination not to give way on the “ blue line ” question. He emphasised the unfortunateness of the moment at which the “blue line ” doctrine had been propounded and begged me to avert a further war. ANDREW RYAN. Foreign Office, July 30 ; 1934.Note by Colonel T•C .Fowle,C.B.E., dated the 11th September 1934. With reference to the C.1.D.meeting on the 13th on the subject of relations with Ibn Saud and particularly the question of the Blue Line, the following are some comments of mine in so far as the Persian Gulf area is concerned. (I have already given my views in more detail in my letter No.594-S of 20th June last.). 2. The Persian Gulf coastal territory east of the Blue Line can be divided into five areas. (a) Jafurah - the area immediately south-west of Qatar. This contains two hamlets, Sakak and anbak. Bach consists of 8 or 9 reed huts with a few palm trees. The inhabitants of this area, chiefly the Al Morrah, pay tribute to Ibn Saud (Colonel Loch*s report, paragraph 2). (b) The territories of the Trucial Shaikhs. The Shaikhs pay no tribute to Ibn Saud, but now and then give him courtesy presents. (c) This consists of the hinterland of (b). The Monasir tribe of one section of this area, Dhafurah, for the last four of five years have paid tribute to Ibn Saud (paragraphs 5 and 6 of Colonel Loch's report). (d) Baraimi. For many years past the Wahabis do not appear to have kept a Resident Agent at Baraimi, and as long ago as 1904 (see my letter No.594-8), the Shaikh of Abu uhabi captured it from the Beni Naim: i.e. from the local tribes, not from the Wahabis. (e) Territory of the Shaikh of Oman. There is no question of any Wahabi claim in this territory. 3. Since Ibn Saud exercises no regular rule over the Persian Gulf territory easip of the Blue Line, (such as, for/■ 2 - for instance, he exercises up to that Line in the province of Hasa) : his claims to any part of that territory depend on the tribute which he extracts from it. On the subject of such tribute, please see paragraph 7 of my letter No.594-3. 4. There seems to be some doubt as to our exact legal position in regard to the Blue Line . I suggest that it might be worth while to get the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown on this question: not that I think we should necessarily adhere to the strict letter of the law in our dealings with Ibn Saud, but it might be as well|to know exactly what the letter of the law was. 5. With regard to Ibn Baud’s desire for a comprehensive understanding with His Majesty's Government 5 with a view to settling all outstanding questions. As far as the Persian Gulf is concerned I think such an understanding would be an excellent thing. One of the most important outstanding questions is the Kuwait Blockade, and Ibn Baud's treatment of this question would probably be an ’acid test' of his sincerity in seeking His Majesty's Government's friendship. 6. Any concessions given to Ibn Baud in the matter of the Blue Line should, as I have previously suggested, be post poned if possible until the A.P.O.C. have obtained the qatar oil concession.Note by Sir /mdrew rlyaruK .3 . «C .i-.G., His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda . 1. By the Treaty of 1915 we undertook to recognise Ibn Baud’s sovereignty over his ancestral dominions. This was part of our policy of using the n.rab desire for liberation from the Turkish yoke as an Allied weapon against the Turks. V/e endorsed by implication the thesis that the Turks had been holding the Arab countries in duress. 2. It ensues from 1. that Ibn Baud’s ancestral claims must be considered with reference to the period between the first period of Saudi expansion and the re-establishment of Turkish rule in arabia in and aoout the eighteen seventies. It is therefore material to know what was the position oi the house of Baud in the country east and south-east oi I\ejd during that period, which may perhaps be narrowed to the period from 1809, when we went for the Truciax Bhairms, and 1865, the year of the Pelly Mission. 3. European criteria of sovereignty cannot be applied to the Arabia of a hundred years ago. The limits of what we call sovereignty were the limits of effective authority at any given moment. Its basis was not the holding Ox specific territories, a word then without meaning in seas of desert, but religious and tribal influence. The Imamate of Muscat would appear to have maintained its religious and political independence during the material period. Ihe Trucial Shaikhs on the other hand had embraced ./ahhaoism before 1809 and seem to have been regarded by us in and after that year as the advanced posts oi a militant polioical power founded on Wahhabism. ± t is a matter lor further historical inquiry, whether they, and more especially their hinterland with which we are now concerned, were subject to or merely under the influence oi the ^eni Baud/Saud at crucial moments, e.g. at the moment of the Felly mission. 4. By the agreements of 1913 and 1914, we recognised Turkish sovereignty, without reference to the claims of any local Arabs, up to the blue and violet lines. The Turks renounced any claims to sovereignty east and south east of those lines apd recognised implicitly that the country beyond them consitituted a British sphere of influence. This influence was dependent on the position we had built up during the nineteenth century as quasi protectors of Muscat and the Trucial Shaikhdoms. 5. As regards the Trucial Bhaiidi doms, we reaffirmed our special position by our agreement with Ibn Saud in 1915 but we took no steps to determine boundaries and we allowed Ibn Saud to extend his influence well into thehinterland of the Shaikhdoms. We made no attempt between 1915 and 1933 to assert that he was limited by the blue and violet lines as such, though we maintained the principle that he must not encroach on the Trucial Shaikhdoms. 6. Whatever may be the boundaries, the Shaikhdoms must in my view be regarded as being conterminous with Ibn Saud's dominions. We cannot reasonably claim that any past transactions have created a British Sphere of influence independent of both. If we asserted such a claim on technical legal grounds unintelligible to the ^rab mind, we should be regarded by all ftrabs alike as imperialist invaders worse than the Turks and we should be undertaking commitments impossible of fulfilment, if the intervening area should become important, e*g. as a theatre of economic enterprise.3- 7. It would be merely absurd to claim that the disputed area is a sphere of influence of any of the coastal rulers. If we are determined to exclude Ibn Saud from it at all costs, we must go the whole hog and claim that it is the actual territory, as yet undivided and undelimited, of the Sultan of Muscat and/or the Trucial Shaikhs. 8. I conclude that our objective should be an entirely new settlement with Ibn Saud, taking into account (a) his invincible hostility to any recognition of past Turkish rights or pretensions; (b) the absolute necessity, in my view, of regarding the coastal states as being conterminous with Saudi Arabia; (c) the fact that, if we or the coastal rulers had valid claims to the disputed area in 1915, we have allowed them to go by default by our tolerance of Ibn Saud's extension of his influence in the hinterland of the Trucial Shaikhdorns; and (d) the desirability of using such technical legal rights as we can claim, less to confine Ibn Saud territorially than to ensure adequate British participation in future economic enterprises in the disputed area and a free run for our aircraft along the Persian Gulf coast. 9. As regards technical legal rights we may well bear in mind what the future Duke of Wellington said in 1804:- 'I would rather sacrifice Gwalior, or every frontier of India, ten times over, in order to preserve our credit for scrupulous good faith, and the advnatages and honour we gained by the late war and the peace; and we must not ffitter them away in arguments, drawn from over-strained principles of the law of nations, which are not understood in this country'*. There is no doubt that the attempt to impose on Ibn Saud the blue and violet lines after twenty years of silence/silence regarding them can only strike Ibn Baud as an attempt to trick him by legal subtleties today out of* what v/e led him to expect when we wished to enlist his support in downing the 'lurks, then our enemies and always the enemies ol his race. He is never likely to give us an unreserved friendship but our policy is to keep him our friend as far as we can do so by affording him moral but not material support. We must sometimes be firm with him but v/e should never do anything avoidable to inflame his suspicions or to drive him to seek the support of other powers. September 12,1934. (Intld.) A.R.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HlS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). September 19, 1934 CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 5874/2429/25] No. 1. Record of First Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs), held at the Foreign Office on September 19, 1934 FUAD BEY HAMZA called on Mr. Rendel this morning accompanied by the Saudi Arabian Minister in London, Sheikh Hafiz Wahba. Sir A. Ryan was also present, except at the beginning of the conversation. 2. Mr. Rendel drew Fuad Bey out on the subjects he wished to discuss, and elicited the fact that he regarded the question of the south-eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia as being of special importance. 3. Fuad Bey dealt first, however, with the question of the relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. He wished to know how His Majesty's Government would view a tightening up of those relations in the common interest of two Arab countries, both of which were on specially friendly terms with His Majesty's Government. His Government had not made any definite approach to the Iraqi Government, but they had the possibility in view, always provided that His Majesty's Government saw no objection. They did not^wish to do anything contrary to His Majesty's Government's policy. 4. Mr. Rendel said that he would like to -have a clearer view of what Fuad Bey had in mind. Speaking generally, and subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, he said that His Majesty’s Government would welcome any thing tending to promote concord and prosperity between the Arab States, and would therefore view with sympathy any rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iraq which had for its object the promotion of peace in Arabia. It would be necessary to consider carefully the nature of any proposed understanding, to ensure that it was consonant with the existing obligations of the parties, notably those of Iraq under her Treaty of Alliance with us and as a member of the League of Nations. He did not think, however, that such obligations would be a barrier to a closer understanding between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and considered that any points which might arise could be covered by suitable drafting^ 1 ) 5. Sir A. Ryan concurred, adding, however, that he thought King Abdul Aziz had rather more in view and sought some sort of a British guarantee of the proposed Saudi-Iraq understanding. 6. Fuad Bey said that this was a misconception. The King did not seek a guarantee, but wished merely to ascertain the attitude of His Majesty's Govern ment. He went on to ask what kind of understanding would be suitable, whether, for instance, His Majesty's Government would be a party to it or whether their position would be merely that of a third Power, which would be kept informed at intervals of what was passing and would take a sympathetic interest. 7. Mr. Rendel explained, on the one hand, the objections of His Majesty's Government to assuming any new obligations, and, on the other, the undesirability of the indefinite multiplication of instruments having no real meaning. He repeated, again reminding Fuad Bey that he was speaking subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, that His Majesty’s Government would view with sympathy a rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, subject to what he had said about the need for harmonising it with existing obligations, but that, while they would be glad to receive such information as the parties directly concerned might give them, they would prefer not to be themselves parties to the understanding arrived at. ( 1 ) This question has already been fully considered by the Foreign Office legal advisers in connexion with an earlier proposal for a Perso-lraqi non-aggression pact. [206 t—1]o s ,v A Rvan observed that it was all the more important to have a clear view as ioresf reference had been made in all the earlier discussions to two other Powers non-Arab, with whom His Majesty's Government were also on terms of friendship, and who were neighbours of Iraq though not of Saudi Arabia. 9 Fuad Bey said that he had nothing to conceal. The two Powers just mentioned were Turkey and Persia. His Government were at present on quite friendly terms with both, and there was no aggressive motive behind their wish for closer relations with Iraq. Nevertheless, the recent rapprochement be ween Turkey and Persia had inspired anxiety m all Arab countnes. L, was all the] greater as a secular racial animosity existed between Arabs and both Turks and Persians. However correct relations might now be nis Government feared the ulterior designs of Turkey and Persia, about which they had a good deal of jo Turkey favoured the maintenance of the French position in feyria, subiect to her wish for a readjustment in her favour in the Alexandretta legion Mustafa Kemal Pasha had stated to a reliable informant that Turkey preferred to have two separate Powers on her southern border.(') There was no secret about Persian aspirations in the Persian Gulf, witness the clauns she wh| asserting to Bahrein, &amp;c. Persia was growing more powerful, she now had six warships m the Gulf, where previously there had been none but British ships. Speaking as an Arab, Fuad Bey would like to see Bahiein develop into an independent Arab unit; in the meanwhile, he certainly did not wish to see Persia establish a claim, as against His Majesty’s Government. 11 . Mr. Rend el said he did not think Persian claims to Bahrein need worry Fuad Bey, but that he understood the general anxiety of which he had spoken. At the same time such' information as His Majesty’s Government possessed did not suggest that there was much danger in the rapprochement between Turkey and Persia, or that either Power had aggressive designs. Turkey had pursued a remarkably peaceful and non-aggressive policy for the last ten years. 12. Fuad Bey was impressed by the quick changes that came over the relations of States. In Europe he found a very different grouping from that of two years ago. He cited as one example the present closeness of the relations between France, Russia and Turkey. It had looked some months ago as though there were even more material for war than in 1914. Happily this danger had been averted, but there might again be quick changes; and similarly in the East, whatever the present position, Turkey and Persia might become hostile to the Arabs. Any blow aimed by them at Iraq would, as the King had told Sir A. Ryan, menace Saudi Arabia indirectly. 13. This digression was not further pursued. Fuad Bey said he under stood what Mr. Rendel had said regarding His Majesty’s Government’s attitude in regard to the proposed rapprochement between Saudi and Iraq. He went on to ask what view would be taken of similar rapprochements with other Arab States. 14. Mr. Rendel emphasised the importance which His Majesty’s Govern ment attach to a settlement between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. As regards the smaller States on the Persian Gulf, however, he said that it would be of great importance to know clearly what sort of arrangements Fuad Bey had in mind. Was not the situation already sufficiently provided for under article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda. His Majesty’s Government gave a very free hand to the rulers of those States in matters of local concern, but they were responsible for their foreign affairs. Saudi Arabia was a great and powerful State compared with these minor sheikhdoms. Might not closer relations with Ibn Saud end by making these States into something like satellites of the greater Power ? His Majesty's Government would certainly not be able to acquiesce in any such development. 15. It was agreed to resume this discussion later. Asked what other subjects he wished to raise, Fuad Bey again referred to the question of the south- ( 2 ) I took this to imply that he thought that Turkey would oppose any Arab combination in northern Arabia, e.y., between Syria and Iraq.—(Initialed) G.W.R. eastf faadeastern frontier and mentioned in a general way what had passed between him and Sir A. Ryan about the position in regard to the Treaty of Jedda. It was agreed to discuss the frontier question to-morrow morning, and Fuad Bey undertook to produce, after this had been done, a further list of subjects. 16. Sheikh Hafiz W ahba made no contribution to the discussion. A. R. Foreign Office, September 19, 1934.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). September 20, 1934. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 5908/2429/25] No. 1 Record of Second Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza, held at the Foreign Office on September 20, 1934. THE meeting was attended by-— Mr. Rendel. Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs). Sheikh Hafiz Wahba (Saudi Arabian Minister in London). Sir Andrew Ryan (His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda). Mr. Johnstone. Mr. Rendel recalled that, at Fuad Bey’s request, it had been agreed on the previous day to begin the present discussion by examining the problem of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. As the Saudi Government were aware, His Majesty’s Government were satisfied as to the continued legal validity of the position established by the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914. They saw nothing to be gained, however, by pursuing the discussion on purely legal lines if there were any other means of reaching a satisfactory settlement; they realised that King Ibn Saud felt strongly on the subject; and they considered that a friendly adjustment of the matter should be possible. They were anxious for a friendly settlement of all outstanding questions with King Ibn Baud, but, in the first place, they would like to know more about King Ibn Baud’s own views on the frontier problem. His Majesty’s Government had certain important responsibilities east of the C£ blue line,” which King Ibn Saud had recognised. It was desirable to establish some agreed boundary in the region in question; but, before going any further, it was necessary to have some idea of King Ibn Baud’s desiderata. Fuad Bey expressed his satisfaction at hearing that His Majesty’s Govern ment did not intend to take their stand rigidly on what they considered their legal rights. King Ibn Saud, he said, was not aiming at expansion, nor did he desire to hold anything which he had not held before. The appeal of His Majesty’s Government to the two Anglo-Turkish Conventions had, however, come as a great shock to him. Those conventions had not been referred to on past occasions, either at the time of the conclusion of the treaty of 1915, under which the question of King Ibn Baud’s eastern frontiers was left open to further discussion, or at the time of the negotiation of the Treaty of Jedda in 1927, when King Ibn Saud had enquired about the relations of His Majesty’s Government with the Arab chiefs of the Persian Gulf, and had been furnished with copies ¥ a number of agreements, but not of these. Meanwhile, Fuad Bey was awaiting details regarding the boundary line which King Ibn Saud wished to propose, and he expected to receive these by Monday, the 24th September. Speaking generally, he considered that King Ibn Saud would claim that those tribes who had long been considered his subjects should continue under his rule, and that their territories should be included in his dominions; he cited particularly the Murra and Manasir tribes. To the south, he suggested that the Qara Mountains beyond the Ruba-al-Khali might be a suitable boundary. Mr. Rendel pointed out to him that the latter claim was a very far-reaching one, as the Qara Mountains were close to the south coast of Arabia. It was clear from Mr. Bertram Thomas’s journeys and maps that there was an extensive area between these mountains and the Ruba-al-Khali, which appeared always to have been part of the territory of Muscat. Fuad Bey then mentioned another line of hills further north, and implied that Ibn Saud did not wish to claim any territory to the south beyond the Ruba-al- Khali; but the point was not pursued. [206 u—1] BMr. Rendel repeated that, if His Majesty’s Government f f uld ^ possible to reach a satisfactory friendly agreement. Wal aspect of the matter; but, m saying this, what the} had m mind was something more than an agreement on this one question ; they desired, m act, a general aireement which should cover a number of questions outstanding between the two Governments, for instance, the Koweit blockade. In regard to ome of these questions, His Majesty’s Government would have certain desiderata; King Ibn Saud would no doubt have his own desiderata m other directions. If the frontier question could be satisfactorily settled as part of such a geneia agree ment. the legal position of His Majesty’s Government could be left on one side. His Majesty’s Government must, however, reserve their right to return to their legal claims if for any reason a general settlement were not found possible. The legal position, even if left in abeyance, remained unchanged and His Majesty s Government were still prepared, if necessary, to uphold the legal validity ot the “ blue line.” Sir A. Ryan concurred in this view. He added that, in pressing for a general settlement, His Majesty’s Government were following the lead given by King Ibn Saud himself, when he had suggested conversations with a view to clearing up his whole position vis-d-vis of His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Rendel suggested that the further examination of the frontier problem might be allowed to wait until Fuad Bey received the instructions which he was shortlv expecting. Meanwhile, he felt bound to make it clear that there was, in fact, a good reason why copies of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913^and 1914 had not been given to Ibn Saud after the Treaty of Jedda. King Ibn Saud had at that time merely asked for copies of the agreements between His Majesty’s Government and other Arab rulers. There had, therefore, been no question of supplying him with copies of agreements between His Majesty s Government and the Ottoman Government. In any case, the “blue line ” was generally known and appeared on several published maps. Fuad Bey expressed himself as hopeful of reaching a settlement of out standing questions. He added, however, that, although King Ibn Saud might be willing to settle any present differences between himself and His Majesty’s Government, he was anxious that there should not be any suspicion of what Fuad Bey termed “ marchandage.” As regards the frontier problem, His Majesty’s Government’s reservation of their legal rights might perhaps raise difficulties. Would it not be better to leave the legal aspect out altogether, confine the discussion to the actual facts of the present position, and treat each question separately on its individual merits, as His Majesty’s Government had always insisted on doing in the past ? Mr. Rendel pointed out that in any general settlement, while problems were naturally considered on their merits, they also had to be considered as inter connected parts of a whole. So long as there was hope of a satisfactory general settlement it would be possible to leave the question of strict legal rights in abeyance, but it must always be understood that, if finally a general settlement proved unattainable, a return could be made to the separate examination of each particular case on its own merits. There was no question of what Fuad Bey had called “marchandage.' The position was simply that the merits of any particular question would have to be considered in the light of the overriding merits of the settlement as a whole. It was a case of give and take and of taking the long rather than the short view. Sir Andrew' Ryan emphasised his earlier remark that His Majesty’s Govern ment were following King Ibn Saud's lead. It was in accordance with King Ibn Saud’s own wishes that His Majesty’s Government were in this case departing from their more usual practice of considering each question in isolation, and were .agreeing to consider the various outstanding questions together. They realised that if an attempt were made to deal with the frontier difficulty by itself, the King's strong feelings would make a settlement on a strictly legal basis difficult .and contentious; he gave as an instance the known reluctance of King Ibn Saud to admit that he could be held to be bound by transactions with the former Turkish Government.3 't OB | afatt, ift il ffieij toti E le. 1 tajesti yofj ‘geaer, byE- clearit. pr# iheiri ere ? £ of i d ii»i [ajestj of vb ;m. I ps raii ogetk ?at eai entk ms w' ,s inte creDES igbts: ttletf, of^ Beyk of errii Mr. Rendel again urged that it would be much easier to merge the frontier question in a general settlement. He informed Fuad Bey that it was contem plated that bir Andrew Ryan should embark on general negotiations on his return to Jedda, provided that it was possible to agree in principle to such negotiations now. Fuad 'Bey finally expressed willingness in principle to deal with the various outstanding problems on general lines, but explained that King Ibn Sand, who had made so many sacrifices in the past for the sake of good relations with His Majesty s Government, could not be expected to make many further concessions now. Sir Andrew Ryan demurred to Fuad Bey’s suggestion that Ibn Saud had done nothing but make sacrifices to His Majesty’s Government. He had indeed accommodated his policy to theirs, but he had derived much benefit from their support. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the only sacrifices which both sides would be required to make in the projected general settlement would be such as might, on a long view, be expected to bring them compensating advantages in the end. It was not a case of altruism on either side. But in any general settlement between two Governments both sides usually had to give way over certain points. Meanwhile, he would be grateful if Fuad Bey could, on his part, outline the principal questions which King Ibn Saud might like to see included in a general settlement. So far as His Majesty’s Government were concerned, he had already mentioned their chief preoccupation, namely, the question of the Koweit blockade. It was their earnest wish to see relations between Saudi Arabia and Koweit put on a really satisfactory basis, as had been done successively in the case of Saudi relations with Iraq and later with Transjordan. Fuad Bey stated that King Ibn Saud fully realised the desire of His Majesty’s Government for a settlement of the blockade question, which had indeed formed the subject of intermittent discussion between the two Governments for the past four years. . His Majesty’s Government should, however, understand that King Ibn Saud’s measures against Koweit were taken not from hostility but purely in order to safeguard his interests. King Ibn Saud had made his position clear and it was for His Majesty’s Government to propose the lines of a settlement. Fuad Bey then raised the question of the future of the Treaty of Jedda, which was now subject to denunciation on short notice by either side—a position which Ibn Saud regarded as unsatisfactory. After some discussion it was agreed that there were three possible alternatives, namely, to denounce the treaty without replacing it by any new instrument, to give it a greater degree of permanence by a supplementary agreement, or to negotiate an entirely new treaty which could if necessary replace it. The first of these alternatives was mutually agreed to be undesirable. The choice between the other two would depend on the nature of the general settlement. It was possible that, if the new general settlement of outstanding questions between the two Governments grew in scope as the negotiations proceeded, it might eventually be found desirable to conclude an entirely new Anglo-Saudi treaty. In the meanwhile, no decision need be taken on this point ftalal Sir Andrew Ryan alluded to previous conversations with Fuad Hamza, in which Fuad Hamza had mentioned the following points in regard to which the Treaty of Jedda seemed to need amendment: Slavery, the Akaba-Maan question (though Fuad Hamza had then said that the King did not wish to go back on the - k; present arrangements) and the present form of article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda ?p ar ‘ regarding the relations between Ibn Saud and the Arab rulers of the Persian df Gulf. 1 real* self.' Fuad Bey said that he wished to add a fourth point, namely, that of the 0 prevailing language of the treaty text. As His Majesty’s Government were 3D v aware, it had been stipulated in the Treaty of J edda that the English text should fort prevail. In the recent Anglo-Yemeni Treaty, on the other hand, the Arabic text had been allowed to prevail. [206 u—1 ] b 2I Mr. Rendel drew attention to the fact that the first two points which had been mentioned, i.e., the question of slavery and that of the A a 1 a i aan ron ler, were not, in fact, dealt with in the text of the Treaty of Jedda^ but m exchanges of notes signed at the time of the conclusion of the treaty, but, in ac &gt; T 111 ^ independent of it. These two questions, whatever might be decided about them, need not therefore affect the future of the treaty. As regards the question of the relations between Ibn Saud and the Arab rulers of the Gulf, which was dealG with in a general way in article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, he considered that any more elaborate arrangements, which it might be necessary or desirable Ujm make to govern future relations between Ibn Saud and the rulers of South-Tastern Arabia, would normally fall to be discussed in connexion with^ an) arrangements that might be made regarding the south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. He thought he ought perhaps to mention at this point that the Sultan of Muscat was more completely independent than the Trucial sheikhs, and that it might therefore be necessary for him to be brought in as a separate party to any eventual settlement. He repeated, however, that the whole of this question seemed to him to fall to be dealt with together with that of the frontier. As regards the question of the prevailing language of any new agreement, he said that this seemed to him to be a point of form which should not be allowed to interfere with the political issues involved. In point of fact, the departure from precedent which had been agreed to in the case of the recent treaty with the Yemen was due to the unique circumstance that the Yemen was so out of touch with civilisation elsewhere that no one could be found in that country with any adequate knowledge of any European language. Unique conditions required unique treatment. Saudi Arabia was in a very different position. The point, however, involved rather complicated questions of precedent, &amp;c., and had better be dealt with quite independently of the political issues. Mr. Rendel then proceeded to deal with the question of slavery. He explained that this question was one of great importance, on which public sentiment in this country was extremely strong. England had played a very remarkable part in the abolition of the institution of slavery, and public opinion here would never tolerate any step which might be regarded as a step in the wrong direction. If any new arrangements were to be made on this point, therefore, it must be quite clear that their effect would be to hasten and not to retard the inevitable and ultimate abolition of slavery as an institution. He felt sure that Fuad Bey, and indeed King Ibn Saud himself, were sufficiently enlightened to realise that slavery an an institution was fundamentally wrong, and was doomed to extinction in any country that hoped to make true progress and to play a worthy part among the nations of the world. He could say categorically, therefore, that His Majesty’s Government would not be able to agree to any new arrangement which did not fit in with these principles. The question was of such importance that he could not in any case do more than hear and take note of any proposals which Fuad Bey might wish to make. If, however. King Ibn Saud should wish to propose some arrangement the effect of which would be not to retard but to accelerate the abolition or at any rate the reduction of slavery, he felt sure it would be examined with all possible consideration for the King’s position in the matter. Fuad Bey stated that in his view slavery would sooner or later cease when slaves ceased to be imported. King Ibn Saud* could, however, proceed no further than the social and economic state of his kingdom would allow. Further, he had to make allowances for the fact that Islamic law permitted slavery. Steps might, nevertheless, be taken to limit the number of slaves in such a wav that an annual decline in their number would eventually lead to the total extinction of slavery. He alluded once again to the recent Anglo-Temeni treaty settlement, under which the Imam had undertaken not to allow the importation of slaves into his territory. It might be possible for King Ibn Saud to give some under taking of that nature and simultaneously to take steps to alleviate the lot of those slaves who were already in Saudi Arabia. Mr. Rendel said that it would, of course, make a great difference if King Ibn feaud could take anv such steps within his own dominions Fuad Spy explained that there were great difficulties attending such action. Apart from King Ibn baud s difficulties with his own public opinion, it wasWin tiered | esira| A-Easf of Ml t it ^ v event led tot eemeit )e afe 'eatyr so out .t cot® londitir positi; , &amp;u explait timett. mark' jrewci directi t muat inevitii mad ft aliset: ixtiactt rt a®: that I ®t wli ance tt als wh i wish ■d but It sure isitioi! asew o furfs rtberd y. Sk; y that i action ’ essential that, if he were to maintain his prestige, his action should not be capable of being represented as dictated by external pressure. He suggested that it should be left to King Ibn Saud to take appropriate action as a matter of internal policy. Mr. Rendel replied that His Majesty’s Government fully realised these difficulties, but that they did not seem to him insuperable. A prohibition of the importation of slaves would, of course, be a great step forward. But this would not really affect the question of the institution of slavery, since the existing slave population was large enough, he understood, to maintain the supply of slaves for an indefinite period. If, therefore, Ibn Saud could take some steps with a view to the gradual reduction of the number of born slaves, it would be more useful still. Some concession, such as that which Fuad Bey had himself suggested, providing for the emancipation of slaves who were maltreated or discontented with their lot, would be an enormous step forward. Such a measure would, of course, for the reasons which had just been discussed, have to be taken by Ibn Saud on his own initiative. But if it were actually taken, it might make it much easier for His Majesty’s Government to make some concession in return. He suggested, as a personal and unofficial suggestion of his own, that by far the best solution would be for Ibn Saud spontaneously to take some action in the sense proposed, in advance of any concession by His Majesty’s Government. Any concession which His Majesty’s Government might agree to make could then be made subsequently, in specific recognition of the fact that Ibn Saud had taken the measures in question. This might create an excellent impression here, and might justify some modification of the present arrangements. Mr. Rendel repeated, however, that he could give no undertaking at this stage as to what the attitude of His Majesty’s Government would be. Fuad Bey thought that something on these lines might be possible, but that Ibn Saud would certainly require some guarantee from His Majesty’s Govern ment in advance that, if he took the action proposed, His Majesty’s Government would subsequently make the desired concession. Sir Andrew Ryan observed that His Majesty’s Government were being asked to abandon an existing right. It would be necessary to justify any such abandonment to opinion in this country, which, on this subject, was very strong, to a wider British opinion, including that of many Moslems, and to international opinion. It would not suffice for such justification to rely merely on an assurance of Ibn Baud’s good intentions. It would be necessary to know what definite action he contemplated to prevent the slave trade and to mitigate the lot of slaves actually suffering from hardship. Although the lot of slaves generally in Saudi Arabia might be fortunate, there were, in fact, instances of oppressive slavery. He cited as an example the facility with which slave husbands and wives could be separated. It was decided to pursue this matter at a later meeting. Before leaving, Fuad Bey Hamza mentioned four points which he would wish to pursue with His Majesty’s Government during the following discussions. These were :— (1) The Hejaz Railway. (2) The cable line between Jedda and Port Sudan. (3) The Koweit Neutral Zone oil concession. (4) Bahrein transit dues. Eastern Department. Foreign Office, September 20, 1934.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). September 21, 1934. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 5957/2429/25] No. 1. Record of Third Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza held at the Foreign Office on September 21, 1934. THE following were present:— Mr. Ren del. Fuad Bey Hamza, Deputy Saudi-Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, Saudi-Arabian Minister in London. Sir A. Ryan. Mr. Johnstone. Mr. Rendel suggested that the meeting should consider in order the various points to which Fuad Bey had referred at the end of the previous day’s meeting. The first of these was the question of Aqaba and Maan. Mr. Rendel was not altogether clear as to Fuad Bey’s object in raising this question. The present position between the two Governments rested on the first exchange of notes signed at the time of the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda, which provided for the maintenance of the de facto frontier. He understood that Fuad Bey had recently stated to Sir A. Ryan at Jedda that the Saudi Government were not seeking to disturb this arrangement. Sir A . Ryan added that he understood that the Saudi Government main tained their previous attitude of reserve towards this question, but that they did not consider the present time propitious for reopening it. Fuad Bey explained that for various reasons, both political and religious, his Government were unable to accept the separation of the Aqaba-Maan district from the Hejaz. They would always be ready to discuss this question on this basis, but if His Majesty’s Government did not consider the present moment opportune for reopening it, the Saudi Government had on their side no wish to raise it. Failing a further discussion and a new settlement, the Saudi Govern ment were prepared to preserve the existing arrangement. Mr. Rendel said that there would, of course, have been advantages—if there were to be any general clearing up of outstanding questions—in reaching a permanent settlement on this particular point also. It would have been desirable to establish a clear and definitive frontier in this area. But there could be no question of His Majesty’s Government modifying their attitude on the main issue of the future of Aqaba and Maan, and if the Saudi Government were not prepared to consider any suggestion for a permanent and definitive settlement on the basis of the present de facto situation, there would certainly be no advantage in reopening the question. On the other hand, there seemed to be some local uncertainty as to the precise definition of the frontier at various points on the frontier between Transjordan and Saudi Arabia. In view of what Fuad Hamza had said regarding the Aqaba- Maan sector of the frontier— i.e., the de facto frontier between Transjordan and the Hejaz—there would probably be no object in discussing that sector of the line. But these considerations need not apply in regard to the Transjordan-Nejd sector of the frontier, where there might well be certain advantages in clearing up any local uncertainties. Mr. Rendel could not make any official suggestions on this point pending consultation with the Transjordan authorities; but, speaking quite personally and unofficially, he thought it might be worth taking the opportunity of the proposed general settlement to try to dispose of any local uncertainties that might exist as to the precise definition of the frontier line. Sir A . Ryan gave as instances of the type of question which had created difficulty in this direction, the former dispute with the Saudi Government regarding the position of Haditha, which had since been acknowledged to be in r 206 x—1] B2 Saudi territory, and the present difference over Hazim, which the Transjordan authorities considered as indisputably m Tiansjor Mr. Rend el put forward personally and unofficially k a . ^ that some of these points might he disposed suggestion was natural irontier commission. Re explained, nowe^ei, rnax .1 -x f nnnr i subject to the views of the Transjordan authorities, and that it might be found to be open to unexpected difficulties. Fuad Bey received this suggestion with partial assent. He agreed thataj clarification of the position in regard to the Transjordan-Nejd frontiei e.g by the appointment of a frontier or delimitation commission-might well be deal with m the proposed general negotiations. On the other hand if the question of the future of Aqaba and Maan were to be left in abeyance, his Government would have difficulty in touching in any way whatsoever the subject of the Rentier between Transiordan and the Heiaz. Mr. Rend el agreed that King Ibn Saud was free to maintain the position which he had taken up in 1927 on this subject, and thought that His Majesty s Government would, in these circumstances, probably be content to continue on the present basis, and not to press for any more formal recognition of the existing frontier. It would, however, be necessary to consult the various departments of His Majesty’s Government concerned and the local authorities before saying any thing more definite. Meanwhile, two points appeared to have emerged from the present discussion : (1) King Ibn feaud was not yet prepared to crystallise the present de facto frontier between Transjordan and the Hejaz; (2) there might be certain advantages in including in the proposed negotiations for a general settle ment some arrangement for the clarification of any points connected with the Transjordan-Nejd frontier, regarding which there was any local uncertainty^ 1 ) The next subject which came up for discussion was the Hejaz Railway. Fuad Bey enquired the views of His Majesty’s Government on the proposal which he had made to Sir A. Ryan at Jedda for the calling of a technical conference to discuss the reconditioning of the railway. It was explained that at first sight His Majesty’s Government had no objection to the Saudi proposal, but that it had, of course, been necessary to consult the French Government, and that it was still necessary to consult the Transjordan authorities. There seemed likely to be no difficulty so far as the French Government were concerned, and although, pending the receipt of the views of the Transjordan authorities, it was still impossible for His Majesty’s Government to make a definite statement on this point, it did not seem likely that there would be any objection to the present limited proposals of the Saudi Government. It should be clearly understood, however, that His Majesty’s Government could not depart from the attitude they had always taken up on this subject, i.e., that such wider issues as that of the ownership of the railway could not be brought into the discussion. The proposed conference could, therefore, only be agreed to on the clear understanding that it should confine itself to technical and practical points. ( l ) Confidential Footnote. — The uncertainties regarding the Transjordan frontiers to which Mr. R end el referred are, in fact, due to the inaccuracy of the maps on which those frontiers were originally plotted. As a result of this inaccuracy there are places where the frontiers are in doubt, to an extent of as much as 20 miles. His Majesty’s Government appear to have good legal grounds for maintaining their own interpretation of the frontier, but the matter has never been cleared up with the Saudi Government. The suggestions made at this meeting were intended to lea\e the door open for a settlement of this question, which is becoming one of some importance, as part of any general settlement that might be reached. It had been recognised from the first that it was likely to prove impossible to obtain a more formal recognition of the de facto frontier between Transjordan and the Hejaz, and that any attempt to redefine this de facto frontier might be a very delicate matter. On the other hand, the alignment of the ■eastern part of the fiontiei (which is one of the main points in doubt) depends to a ^reat extent on the true position of the southern terminal point of the frontier between Transjordan and Nejd, 'Tlr L‘ TT'k ^ of ‘. h&lt; j °K ects of an y Tnmsjordan-Nejd Delimitation Commission to establish. The delimitation oi the Transjordan-Nejd frontier might thus in effect suffice to enable His Majesty s Government also to establish the correctness of their interpretation of the Transjordan-Hejaz de facto line. r3 5 Datiuj )e fomi aent%. ie froi ae post Majer antinif tie ex® rtmeiti ayingi d from stallisci e migi eral set: 1 wilt rtaintr, ailwai. e props , teci Qt Ml jcessart consult: so fai eipt oft Majesti ieem I the k ioveri® lis si# )uld dC ire. oi o tec# ers to 6 frontiffi' jutiers ® ive is never s^ere one oi , e n rec# miitio 11 redefine ■ nment e- i greet $ Jan fficet# tatior s Fuad Bey acquiesced, and explained that what was intended was a return to the situation as it existed before the abortive Haifa Conference of 1928. He suggested, however, that the Saudi Government might reserve their position in regard to the ownership of the railway in an official note. No objection was seen in principle to this procedure, though it was pointed out to Fuad Bey that something would depend on the actual wording of the Saudi reservation. Fuad Bey explained that the matter had hitherto only been dealt with unofficially. If His Majesty’s Government were prepared to accept the Saudi suggestion, his Government contemplated addressing an official note on the whole subject to both the British and French Governments, and proposing therein a technical conference on the lines he had indicated. It was agreed that the next step was for His Majesty’s Government to reply to the outstanding Saudi enquiry, which could not, however, be done until the views of the Transjordan authorities had been obtained. • The next subject on Fuad Bey’s list was the question of telegraphic and wireless communication between Saudi Arabia and the outer world, with particular reference to the provisions of the Jedda-Port Sudan Cable Agreement. Fuad Bey recalled the fact that the Saudi Government were debarred by article 6 of this agreement from using their wireless stations in the Hejaz for the purpose of communication with other countries. When the agreement had been signed there were two separate Governments, in the Hejaz and in Nejd, and the agreement had been interpreted as applying to the Hejaz only. The situation had now greatly changed in every respect; and the Saudi Government were finding it exceedingly inconvenient to be obliged to send all telegraphic communications from the Hejaz by the Port Sudan cable. A French company, the Radio Orient, and various Italian interests had also approached the Saudi Government in the matter. Sir A. Ryan recalled that the working agreement had been entered into by the Sudan and Hejaz Governments jointly as joint owners, and by the Eastern Telegraph Company as workers, of the cable. The agreement was terminable on two years’ notice, to be given either by both joint owners or by the company. Fuad Bey said that an exchange of notes had taken place between the Sudan and Saudi Governments arranging that if the Saudi Government should approach the Sudan Government with a view to the termination of the agreement, the Sudan Government would agree to join in giving the required notice. Sir A. stated that the interpretation of the agreement had in the past given rise to various legal difficulties which had not, however, been pursued, as the amalgamation of the Eastern Telegraph Company with Marconis seemed to have simplified the problem. On the Persian Gulf side, however, a somewhat similar problem had arisen over the question of communications between Hasa and Bahrein. Conversations had taken place between King Ibn Saud, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sir H. Biscoe in 1932. No advance had been made, and the matter had lain dormant for some time, but had lately been revived, and Elis Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda had been instructed to revert to it with the Saudi Government. Fuad Bey Hamza also raised the question of the charges on the cable. It was agreed, however, that the question of the interpretation of the Jedda-Port Sudan Cable Agreement and of Saudi wireless communications with other countries was a very technical one and one in which His Majesty’s Government in the P^nited Kingdom were not very directly interested, and that it would be preferable, therefore, that this question should not be dealt with in the proposed general settlement. It was agreed that the best course would be for a meeting to be arranged before Fuad Bey’s departure from London between himself and representatives of Cables and Wireless (Limited) (now incorporating inter alia both the Eastern Telegraph Company and Marconis) and, if possible, some representative of the Sudan Government, possibly Sir Stewart Symes, who was understood to be in England on leave. [206 x—1] B 2 .The next subject discussed was the Koweit Neutral Zone On Concession. Fuad Bey recapitulated the position of the Saudi Itieen Standard Oil Company of California in regard to th ^ °P U °f J h f „ }^ v ^ e . given them in connexion with this concession. Aftei a short discuss - er it was agreed to postpone further examination of this mattei until t ng week, when an India Office expert on this question would be available to join in the discussion. 16. Finally, the question of the Bahrein Transit Dues was raised. Fuad Bey explained that there were two difficulties confronting his this matter : firstly, the question of the transit dues themselves; and second y, the question of direct shipments to the Hasa coast. As legalds the hist of these, the Saudi Government feared that the Bahrein Government were about to raise the dues, if they had not already done so. I hey considered, moreover, that any , consignments addressed either to King Ibn Baud or to the Saudi Government! should be exempted from dues. 17. Sir Andrew Ryan stated that for some time past the negotiations on this subject had been transferred to London, and that, although he had been kept informed, he had not been directly concerned in this matter, until (luring his recent audience with King Ibn Saud at Faif the King had raised with him the question of direct shipments. He pointed out that it was scarcely fair ol the Saudi Government both to demand that the Bahrein Government should reduce the rates of the dues and at the same time endeavour to kill the Bahrein transit trade. Bahrein must live. 18. Mr. Rendel stated that Sheikh Hafiz Wahba had already represented fully at the Foreign Office the views of his Government on this subject. His Majesty’s Government, for their part, had suggested that a Saudi delegation should 'be sent to Bahrein, to examine whether the issue between the Saudi and Bahrein Governments could not be narrowed down if not removed altogether. He suggested that this was, in fact, the most practical means of settling this question, that the Saudi Government could not prejudice their case by sending such a delegation, and that if the discussions should fail they would still be free to pursue the matter with His Majesty’s Government direct. The question, particularly as regards the dues, was a complicated and technical one, where local data would be necessary, and which could be dealt with far more effectively on the spot than in London or in Jedda. He felt sure that such a local meeting would do much to clear the air, even if it did not lead to a final settlement, and he suggested that preliminary discussions of this nature might well take place at once. Sir A. Ryan would not be back in Jedda until December, so there was plenty of time to explore the ground locally meanwhile. If the proposed local discussions should lead to nothing, and the Saudi Government should have reasonable grounds for considering the attitude of the Bahrein Government to be unreasonable, it would still be possible to bring the matter into the scope of the general discussions with Sir A. Ryan after his return to Jedda. Sir Andrew Ryan stated that he had always considered Saudi Arabia and Bahrein to be jointly interested in this matter, subject to a proviso that with the passage of time this common interest might weaken or vanish. He had throughout been convinced, and was still convinced, that the best method of arriving at a solution would be that which His Majesty’s Government had proposed, namely, a discussion at Bahrein on a purely practical basis, with the object of arriving at an agreement which should be concluded for a limited period of, say, five years. Such a discussion, conducted by such local experts as, say, Mahomed at Tawil on the Saudi side, and the Financial Adviser, with the assistance of the British Political Agent, on the Bahreini side, would, in his opinion, offer every prospect of a settlement. He had again urged this solution at Taif, but King Ibn Saud appeared to be obsessed by the feeling that His Majesty’s Government were inclined to boycott the development of the Hasa ports. Mr. Rendel explained that His Majesty s Government had no wish to boycott or blockade Hasa or to interfere with its development. But, in any case, if the ^audi Go\ ei nment could not obtain reasonable satisfaction at the proposed local oonfeience, they would still be able to raise this question during the general-discussions at Jedda. Mr. Rendel saw nothing to be lost and much to be gained from the proposed local discussions. Fuad Fey explained^ that he could not depart from his instructions on this question. He undertook, however, to suggest once more to the King the possibility of local discussion at Bahrein and to put to His Majesty the arguments which had been used. He quite realised that Bahrein must find some means of economic existence, but such an existence should not be parasitic. If Bahrein wished to live by its transit dues, it must give reasonable facilities. This would not be the case if the transit dues were raised, and in any case King Ibn Saud felt strongly that goods consigned to himself and his Government should be exempted. Mr. Rendel said that so far as he was aware it was not in accordance with general practice to exempt from transit dues stores destined for a foreign Government. Sir Andrew Ryan stated that His Majesty’s Government had always been ready to give liberal treatment to stores destined for the actual use of King Ibn Saud. The economy of Nejd, however, was of a peculiar kind, and there seemed no good reason wdiy stores which were, for instance, imported for the use of tribes should be exempted from transit dues. Fuad Hamza then reverted to the question of direct shipments to Hasa. He emphasised the importance which King Ibn Saud attached to this, and added that local interests in Saudi Arabia, Basra, and even Persia were now considering the possibility of forming some independent navigation company, in view of the pressure which had been brought to bear on the British India Company not to make any shipments to the Hasa direct. Sir A. Ryan urged on the Saudi representatives the importance of dispelling from the King’s mind the idea that His Majesty’s Government were trying to force him into economic dependence on Bahrein, and Mr. Rendel repeated that His Majesty’s Government had no wish to bring about a boycott or blockade of the Hasa coast. In conclusion, Mr. Rendel mentioned that His Majesty’s Government might wish, in the course of any general negotiations, to revive the question of the passage of aircraft over Saudi Arabia. The question, which had often been discussed before, was, in one sense, one of diminishing importance, since the actual extent of the Saudi coastline on the Persian Gulf was small and the radius and reliability of aircraft were steadily increasing. It was, of course, against the policy of His Majesty’s Government to make the regular passage of aircraft over any particular country subject to financial payments. It was clear that, once such a principle were established, there would be no end to it, and that freedom of air communications all over the world would be greatly interfered with. But there would be certain advantages if some agreement could be come to with a view to facilitating the passage of aircraft over King Ibn Baud’s territory. The question of dealing with the matter in connexion with the proposed general settlement had not yet been fully considered, but Mr. Rendel thought it well to make it clear at once that His Majesty’s Government might eventually wish to raise it, lest, if it were left over and only mentioned later, they should be regarded as endeavouring at the last moment to include new subjects in the general settlement and thereby altering its scope. Sir Andrew Ryan observed that His Majesty’s Government might wish to add certain subjects to the list of those to be reviewed during Fuad Bey’s visit to London. He mentioned in particular the question of the Government of India’s dispensary in the Hejaz. It was agreed that Sir A. Ryan should pursue this question, and possibly certain other minor matters, with Fuad Bey and the Saudi Minister on the morning of the 24th September. It was agreed that the next general conversation should take place on the afternoon of the 24th September, after Fuad Bey had seen the Secretary of State.

[E 5996/2429/25] No. 1. Fourth Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza, held at the Foreign Office on the September 24, 1934. Note by Sir Andrew Ryan. FUAD BEY, accompanied by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, came to see me this morning in accordance with the arrangement made at the third conversation, that we should discuss separately the question of the Government of India’s dispensaries in the Hejaz and possibly other minor questions. 2 . I explained to Fuad Bey that the question of the dispensaries, though important, was non-political and concerned the Indian authorities. Mr. Rendel had therefore asked me to go into the matter with himself and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba. I reminded Fuad Bey that when he and I last discussed the question in Jedda we had seemed to be approaching a solution, but the discussion had been interrupted by his illness. The matter had now taken a new and less favourable turn, as the Saudi Government had addressed a circular to Mr Calvert, in which they had asked for separate statements of medical supplies imported for the use of members of the Legation and those imported for general dispensary use, in order that customs duty should be levied on the latter. I read to him the mam poitions ot the telegraphic correspondence, and said that there appeared to be two miscon ceptions viz., (a) the Saudi Government seemed to think that medical supplies not intended for the use of the Legation staff were sold to the public, whereas m fact the quantities of medicine supplied in return for payment were negligible, and’(6) they seemed to think that Fuad Bey and I had dealt only with the status of the Indian medical officers, whereas we had, m fact, dealt with the whole question of the dispensaries. 3. I urged that the Saudi Government should not try to force the issue by assuming that stores, other than those for the use of the members of the Legation were liable to duty. The Jedda dispensary had existed for some fifty years, and had always enjoyed immunity as part of the British mission. Moreover, the Turkish Government had exempted from duty supplies imported by foreign charitable institutions as such, not only those for diplomatic use. The b ^iic dispensary at Mecca had been opened with Ibn Saud s approval m 1925. 1 here was I admitted, no written record of this, as the arrangement had been made between the King and the Indian vice-consul, but the best indication of the King’s attitude at that time was that for the first year he had provided a house free°of rent for the dispensary at Mecca. I was prepared, I said, to pursue the question on the lines foreshadowed in my discussion with Fuad Bey at Jedda, but I could not admit, pending a settlement, that supplies for the dispensaries were liable to customs duty, and I deprecated the attempt of the Saudi Government to enforce their own view in this respect before the whole matter had been thrashed out. The case was a unique one, and while not claiming that the exemption could be claimed under general international usage, there were strong reasons for ““TXid Bey suggested that no reliance could be placed on earlier precedent, as the Treaty of‘Jedda had swept away all such precedents. I replied that the Treaty of Jedda had not done this, but had said that our re ations were to be based on principles of international law International law Question established custom. I was quite prepared to seek a t y h °! ln n?f es f 0 r but I suggested that customs immunity should be granted foi the supplies to next pilgrimage season, in order that the present situation should be preserved uitflot until we could work out the solution. # i • 5 ’ Fuad Bey said that he had had nothing on the subject from his Goverm ment, and was not in a position to discuss it. I said tha yfU f“m proposal, i.e., that the stores for next pilgrimage season should be exempted f 0 ^206 aa—4]duty and the general discussion pursued at leisure. This could, if necessary be pursued with Mr. Calvert, but I should prefer to leave it until h uad Bey and Ij could deal with the matter on our reurn to Jedda. Fuad Bey noted my proposal. 6 . I used various arguments, which need not be recorded in detail, to impress on Fuad Bey the importance of this question, urging inter alia that the Saudi Government should take account of the great services rendered by the dispensaries. They supplied wants which the Saudi Government were not as yet in a position to satisfy, and the Saudi Government should not make their position impossible by attempting to exercise excessive control or by adding customs duty to the expenditure entailed, the amount of which was already worrying the Government of India. 7. I told Fuad Bey that this was the most important of the small number of questions which I had suggested adding to the list of those already discussed with Mr. Rendel and myself. I need only advert to two others, viz., the pecuniary claims of His Majesty’s Government against the Saudi Government, and the position as regards British nationality in Saudi Arabia. The latter question seemed to be progressing on satisfactory lines and I would not pursue it. I did not wish at this moment to pursue definitely the question of the two debts of the Saudi Government to His Majesty’s Government, but I reminded Fuad Bey that we were very anxious to dispose of the matter, which was one on which we were faced with strong insistence on the part of the Treasury. I recalled our proposal that the trivial MacDonnell debt should be settled out of hand, and the liquidation of the larger debt placed on a business basis. I added that I had induced His Majesty’s Government to postpone the matter pending a clearing up of the situation between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. That situation had now been liquidated, and I had again reminded Sheikh Yussuf Yasin of the debts shortly before leaving Jedda. 8 . Fuad Bey threw out a personal suggestion that perhaps His Majesty’s Government might now see their way to promote the flotation of a small loan in this country, sufficient to enable the floating debt of his Government to be paid off. He outlined in very general terms a scheme for the issue of bonds. I received this suggestion very guardedly, but promised to report it. I explained that the matter was outside my sphere and that I could not judge of the possibilities, though I had no reason to think that the prospect of raising money for Saudi Arabia would be any better now than it had been in 1932. 9. In conclusion, I told Fuad Bey, with reference to what had passed at the third meeting about the Jedda—Port Sudan cable, that there was no hope of bringing any adequately equipped representative of the Sudan Government into a discussion of the matter before he left London. I had, however, just seen a representative of Cable and Wireless (Limited), and had suggested that he should meet Fuad Ley- This gentleman had agreed, subject to the reservation that any proposals which might emerge would have to be submitted to the board of the -company. The question of Saudi telegraphic communications had arisen in three aspects, viz., cable rates, the position in regard to the present working agreement between the joint owners of the cable {i.e., the Government of the Sudan and the Flejaz) and the Eastern Telegraph Company, and the wish of the Saudi Govern ment to establish wireless communication between Hasa and the outer world. I thought that an entirely non-committal discussion would serve to out those concerned in possession of each other’s views and desiderata. /t • . Be J agreed to meet a representative of Cable and Wireless (Limited), and it was arranged that they should meet to-morrow morning at the Foreign Office, I being present. September 24, 1934. A.

IT had originally been arranged to continue at this meeting the discussion begun at the second meeting (E 5908) regarding the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. I he instructions which Euad Bey had been expecting in regard to this question had not, however, arrived, and it was not possible to make any further progress with it. It was arranged that, if these instructions did not arrive before Fuad Bey’s departure from England, Sheikh Hafiz would, on their receipt, acquaint the Foreign Office with their tenor. 2. Mr. Rendel asked that the Foreign Office might be given as full an account as possible of King Ibn Sand’s views on the frontier problem well in advance of the opening of the proposed negotiations at Jedda. This would save a good deal of delay and reference home when the negotiations began. He added that he did not wish to begin by seeming over-optimistic with regard to the negotiations over this particular question. There were certain to be many points in regard to which the two sides would not see eye to eye. For instance, Fuad Bey had at the second meeting mentioned the Murra and Manasir as tribes which King Ibn Saud was likely to claim as his subjects. So far as the Murra were concerned, there was perhaps some reason to consider that they were closely connected with Saudi Arabia. The Manasir, on the other hand, seemed to be of more doubtful allegiance, and were stated to be largely dependent on the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. Again, Fuad Bey had mentioned a claim as far south as the Qara Mountains. His Majesty’s Government would certainly not be able to agree to anything so extensive. He mentioned these points to show that all would not necessarily be plain sailing. He was confident, however, that a friendly and reasonable settlement could be reached, and Sir A. Ryan would certainly make every effort to reach one, though he would necessarily be bound on many points by his instructions from home. Fuad Bey stated that Sheikh Hafiz Wahba would also be available to help in the negotiations in Jedda, since he was proceeding on leave to Saudi Arabia at the end of the year. 3. In the discussion which followed, an opportunity was taken to remind Fuad Bey that the chief desideratum on the side of His Majesty’s Government in any general settlement would be a satisfactory settlement as regards commercial relations between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. Fuad Bey suggested at one point that it might be better to balance this question against the problem of the oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone, rather than against that of the south-eastern frontier. He was, however, given no encouragement to pursue this line of thought. Sir Andrew Ryan observed that a general settlement should be of the greatest advantage to King Ibn Saud in pursuit of his policy of consolidating his regime in Arabia. 4. The question of slavery was again touched upon, but it was clear that Fuad Bey was not in a position to add anything more precise to what he had previously said regarding the possibility of such action by Ibn Saud as would justify His Majesty’s Government in renouncing their present right of manumission. 5 . At the close of the meeting Fuad Bey mentioned that his Government might perhaps feel inclined, during the forthcoming negotiations, to raise once more the question of the possible entry of Saudi Arabia into the League of Nations. The proposed general settlement would remove one of the factors which had in the past been considered a possible obstacle to the admission of Saudi Arabia to the League, namely, that country’s lack of fixed frontiers. Mr. Rendel reminded Fuad Bey that the existence of slavery in Saudi Arabia had also in the past been mentioned as a possible obstacle. Fuad Bey replied that this question also was to be discussed during the negotiations, and if, as [206 aa—1] X2 &lt; Ha with it it might be possible for was to be hoped, some progress were ma &gt; for a( i m i ss i on to Saudi Arabia to follow the precedent of Ethiopia ^ Pf' the League even in advance of the tota f the indebtedness of his 6 .

(S 6160/279/91) No.l Atiglo-Saudi lielations, South-Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia - (Record of conversation with Saudi Ministry on October 3rd 1934.) Following on the arrangement made at the second meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 20th September, the Saudi-Arabian Minister and Mr, Zada called on Mr.Rendel on the 3rd October ostensibly to inform him of King Ibn Sard’s views in regard to the possible revision of the •'blue line' frontier. Sir a. Ryan and Mr.Johnstone were also present, 2# Shaikh Hafik Wabha began by explaining that he had now heard from Ibn Sa'ud, and that the King consider- -ed that the frontier should follow existing de facto line which had been tacitly, though not formally, agreed upon between himself and the Shaikh of /atar as the southern limit of the latter's authority. This boundary though never actually defined, had long been tacitly accepted and had never given rise to any trouble, and the King would be prepared to reach an agreement either with the Shaikh of gatar direct or with His Majesty's Government on this basis. 3. Mr Rendel said that this was, of course, only a small portion of the frontier, but that it seemed to him that what the shaikh had just aaid was really begging the question. His Majesty's Government could not admit any line other than the'blue line' ox^ the ground that it had been tacitly agreed to or accepted and had not given rise to difficulty. It was precisely because no agree- -ment had been reached about the frontier and because2 because diiliculties had. arisen that the question was now under discussion* Moreover, His Majesty’s (j-overnment were responsible for the foreign relations of ^atarj there could, there!ore, be no question of a direct agreement between the bac-iii.... oi 4 a tar and Ibn Saud in regard to the frontier* ihe position was that His Majesty’s Government regarded the w blue Line” as the legal so uth-eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia* They were prepared as part of a general settlement not to take their stand on the strict letter of the law, but to agree to some modification of the line by mutual agreement* 4. What the Minister had said gave a fairly clear indication of what King Ibn Saud 1 s desiderata might be in regard to the ^.atar sector of the line* Btiit it was even more important to know Ibn Saud’s ideas in regard to the remainder of the ”blue line”* Faud Bey, at the meeting on the 20th September, had spoken of claims to the areas inhabited by the Murra and Manasir tribes, and extending as far south as the Q»ara mountains* The claim to the Manasir might give rise to Ax difficulties, and His Majesty’s Government would certainly not be prepared to consider any claims extending as far south as the Q,ara mountains* What His Majesty’s Government wanted to know was how far King Ibn Baud’s claims really did extend. It would, for instance, obviously be useless to pursue the discussion if King Ibn Baud were putting forward claims extendinj right into the territory of Muscat* Before negotiations could be embarked upon, it was really important to know what the King was asking for. 5. The Saudi Minister said that he had received no instructions in regard to anything but the ^.atar sector of the frontier. He understood that the King proposed to communicate 0 his- 3 - his views to Sir A Ryan on the latter’s return to Jedda in December, when negotiations would be opened. 6. Sir A Ryan pointed out that this carried us no further at all than the Saudi Government’s last note on the subject. 7. Mr. Rendel said that His Majesty’s Government consider ed it most important to have some indications of King Ibn Saud’s claims and desiderata before Sir A Ryan’s departure. He repeated that the present position was that His Majesty's Government took their stand on the rt blue line”, but that they would be prepared to make some concession in this area as part of a general settlement. But before deciding whether any such settlement were possible, it was essential that they should know what King Ibn Saud was asking for. If King Ibn Saud was claiming virtually the whole of South-Eastern Arabia, it might be useless to pursue the matter. In any case, it was necessary to issue detailed instructions to Sir A. Ryan for his guidance in carrying on any negotiations. I'hese instructions would have to be elaborated in consultation with several other Departments of His Majesty’s Government, and it would not be possible to consider them until His Majesty’s Government knew what King Ibn Sand wanted in this matter of the south-eastern frontier. He therefore suggested that the Saudi Minister should telegraph to his Government ana ask for telegraphic information on this question. 8. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba agreed to telegraph his Government forthwith, but said that the King would probably require time to make enquiries from the tribes, &amp;c., in the area in question. 9. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the King was apparently claiming an extension of his dominions to the east and south-east of the 'blue line” , on the ground that certain tribes inhabitirg certain areas in this part of Arabia had always owed his alleg iance. . Surley the King must know which tribes owed him allegiance and which did not, and must already have the necessary inf ormat i aQ4 information as to the areas which were inhabited by the former. King Ibn Baud could hardly claim the allegaince of tribes which he did not know or sovereignty over areas regarding the limits of which he was ignorant. 10. Sir A. ftyan added that K^ng Ibn Baud knew more about this part of Arabia than anyone elae, and must certainly already possess all the information required in order to enable him to f ormulate his claims. 11* It was agreed that the Saudi Minister should put these points to King Ibn Seud by telegraph, and communi cate with Mr. Rendel again as soon as he received a reply.

NOTE OF DISCUSSION WITH MP, BP R TP AM THQl^S ON I9t3a OCTOBER 1934 . Ivlr. Thomas was informed confidentially of the difficulties which have arisen in connection with the Blue Line ana the general position was discussed with him. It was agreed that steps should be taken to obtain a report written by him on the air route reconnaissance of 1927 from the Gulf ana he kindly consented to answer a questionnaire to be compiled after that report had been seen if we should so aesire. His views on the following points of general interest were as follows. 2. Desirability ana •practicability of fixed boundaries . Mr. Thomas, in the light of his experience of nrabia saw very strong objection to laying down fixed boundaries as represented by a line on the map in the hinterland of the Trucial sheikhdoms, Muscat, etc. Such a line was meaningless so far as tribes and local rulers were concerned. The tribal boundary was txie only real one. Moreover, the situation in the hinterland was essentially fluid ana a line which might represent the position at the moment would be unlikely to do so, say, in ten years' time, even if the general political situation remained the sane, ana certainly would not do so once any major political alteration (such as the death of Ibn Saud, the death of Ibn Jiluwi, or the reassertion of the influence of Abu Dhabi) had taken place. 3/3. possibility of settlement on a tribal basis . While a tribal basis was likely to be very much more satisfactory than a territorial basis, Mr. Thomas saw great cliff iculty. in a settlement of this nature. He admitted that it might be possible to ear mark settled elements of particular tribes such as the Manasir and to separate them from the nomad elements for the purpose of a tribal settlement. But he repeated that tribal allegiances were very iignt and varied very rapidly, tnat the area of the aira or circle within which a tribe operated might well be affected by failure of grass, etc., and that inaiviuual Sheikhs were not necessarily in a position to pledge their tribes to a certain allegiance. What had in practice in the past determined Tribal allegiances had been the wealth, the personality and the power to bring pressure of the more important rulers at any given time, whether in Nejd, in Muscat, or in Abu Dhabi, ana he thought we siioula be incurring great risks if at this stage we entered into any written settlement with Ibn Saud which attributed certain tribes to him. Incidentally the Manasir were historically an Abu 'khf' 06 ? although in the last five or six years they had paid Zakat to Ibn Saud. 4. Ibn Saud's influence to the east of the Blue Line and the payment of xakaf .'~ Mr. Thomas in the first place confirmed a suggestion already made from the Gulf that aakat represented no more than, a mila form of insurance carrying with it no suggestion of suzerainty or sovereignty end corresponding closely to the ancient aanegeld. It would be dangerous in his view to base any/any settlement merely on the fact that zakat had heen paid hy a particular trite at any given time, vfiat in practice happened was that a trite -which founa itself engaged in hostilities with another neightouring trite 5 which, like itself, had not paid zakat to 9 say, Ton Baud, seized the opportunity, ty sending a camel or some small similar tritute to Itn 3aua to secure his moral support in any raiding which it might undertake. Hie danger and the occasion over, the payment of zakat would lapse. Or again, nomad trites might tender an offering to Itn Sana, or to Itn Jiluwi, if they found themselves in the course of their wanderin b s near the torders of Nejd or close to some area in which Saudi influence was strong. They certainly would not regard themselves as committed to any permanent allegiance to Ibn 3aud ty such a payment. Or again, a memter of the sheikhly family, who had designs on the ruling sheikh, or who found himself threatened ty that sheikh, would send a present to Itn Jiluwi ty way of strengthening his hands against his own ruler. 5. Influence of Itn jiluwi . Mr. Thomas was of opinion that the influence of Itn Jiluwi was the most sutstantial feature of the Saudi regime in north-eastern nratia. Itn Jiluwi’s strongly marked personality, his strength, and his severity had acquired a great influence for him among the Bedouin. In Mr. Thomas’ opinion the influence of the Saudi Government in the hinterland of the area to tne east of the Blue Line was likely to te very sutstantially reduced with Itn Jiluwi’s death. Ion saua, unless he could find an equally dominating lieutenant, would not himself te in a position to carry anything like so much weight. The/6. The religious conilict . Mr* Thomas said that there was no question of the Toadhi tribes of Oman being ,willing to accept 3auai overlordship or enter into relations with Ibn 3aud. They were definitely arm positively hostile on religious grounds and would certainly be opposed to any Saudi attempt to absorb them. This was true to a less extent of the shafi tribes, which might or might not be prepared in certain circumstances to support or pay zakat to Ibn Saud. 1 9 Baraimi . The tribes of Baraimi, while one section of them, the El Shamis, had paid zakat to Ton saud, would certainly strongly resent any endeavour on his part to exercise effective control over them. In this connection Mir. 'Thomas referred to the great importance up to recently of Abu Dhabi, a sheikhdom which had for very many years been the most powerful in the Persian Gulf. 8. As regards the boundaries of Muscat , the position was that it was difficult, if not impossible, to set out their specific limit in the hinterland. The Imam and trie Ibadhi tribes were for practical purposes, though not formally, independent of the sultan. For religious reasons they would, however, be likely to be equally hostile to Ibn saud. In the south-east, in Dhofar, there had never been any question of Saudi influence. Ibn Saud had sent emissaries to the Saar, Manahil, etc. But these tribes, together with the El Kathiri and the Mahra tribes of the southern steppe, did not pay zakat to Ibn Sana and had rejected overtures made/- 5 - made to them hy emissaries sent to them 'by the King. The tribes which used the sands aid pay zakat to Ibn Baud In a loose sort of way, hut it would be dangerous to base too much on this. » J * Gr # L * 19.10.34o IN DIA OFF i CiC.€ 0 ut f he tmthml on the of the ^mli^e^en ear* ana saici del ini that I ha Saua 1 » prestige hah gone down on the . .rah Const of the Gulf «&amp; a result of that cmp^ign# I ancles# ror ready refaranaa an eatr: ei i&gt;aa a recent Kuwait Intelligen.## Buamai^ f which la to the aasia effect* The factor of /yrmb public opinion with regard to 11m asLud ie #X* ewe practical ia^ortance aa hie authority over his subjects* ea^ecially over the tribal «latt*nta 9 de^enua good deal on areat%e« X am sending a copy of this letter to .etcalio and to Calvert at #ad4a* ,&lt; erhu -a tii# taralgn CXTlee would be &amp; ood eiiough to give H/an a copy* Yours sincerely, ad* T.C*Fowls* fExtract paragraph 102 of Kuwait Intelligence Summary Uo.lO for the oeriod 1st to 31st October 1934. 102. 3IK SAUD ;,m YiLlVulJ CAl^AlG^ .

Sir, In continuation of correspondence ending with your telegram No.836 dated 4th October 1934, I have the honour to state that I have discreetly enquired from His Highness the Sultan concerning what he regards as the boundaries of his Sultanate. 2 . As the result of my enquiries the following information is available. U) 'imimi. WWilMY FROM NQHTH TO SOUTH . (i) From a point south of and including Bakhah (on the west of Mussandum Peninsula) to a point 36 miles south of Bakhah and approximately 10 miles west of Dibbah - ( Note. His Highness is not sure whether Tibat actually falls within the limits of the Hultanate or not). (ii) Thence to the south is interposed the Shamaliyeh which is not His Highness*s territory. Com mencing from the 3.W. borders of the Hhamaliyeh, i.e. \v including the whole southern bank of the Wadi el Qor the \ Muscat boundary passes along the western foot hills of the western Hajar Hills and at point East of Jabal Khadra swings south west to include Baraimi, the Sheikhs- 2 - of which oasis are in the Sultan’s pay and are responsible for the safeguarding of routes in this area. (iii) Thence, towards the extreme south of his territories which extend to das Dharbat Ali ( to the west of the Province of Dhofar) the Sultan regards his limits as being terminated by the sand® of the Great Desert ( Kuba’a Khali) - ( hote . Morth of the Province of Dhofar there exist three plateau® or ranges of hills which, taken in rededing order from the sea are the i&amp;L Qura fountains, el Qatn and el Kejd. The area known as el Jsiejd borders the sands of the Great Desert and is regarded as Muscat territory)* (b) &amp;APT&amp;RN BOUNDAKY FROM NORTH TQ..,^QUTg » (i) The whole of the Musandum Peninsula north and east of the line roughly given under (a) paragraph (i), and thence to Dibbah is Muscat territory* (ii) Thence, excluding the Dhamaliyeh coast (Dibbah to north bank of the Wadi el Qor), the sea board forms the Eastern and Southern border of His highness’s territory ries. 3. The foregoing are the limits of the Htate as iar as it has been possible to obtain. 4. I would add for your information that His highness volunteered the fact that some time age agents of bin Saud penetrated as far as Baraimi and took zakat irom the tribes of that area but that they have not done so for V four or five years* He regards Baraimi as wholly hits* own territory* I have the honour to be, Sir, Xour most obedient servant, Sd/- C.H.U.Bremner* Political Agent &amp; H.B.M’s Major, Consul, Muscat.Conf iaential.

Fowle, O * .D • E • , The Residency, Bushire.3/ F,2.6810/54. NOTE OF DISCUSSION WPIH 1 V 1 F. B^HTRAIvl THQIvjiS ON 19th OCTOBER 1954 . Mr. Thomas was inTormea confidentially of the difficulties which have arisen in connection with the Blue Line ana the general position was discussed with him. It was agreed that steps shoula be taken to obtain a report written by him on the air route reconnaissance of 1927 from the Gulf ana he kinaly consented to answer a questionnaire to oe compiled alter that report had been seen if we should so desire. His views on the following points of general interest were as follows. 2. Desirability ana practicability of fixed boundaries . Mr. Thomas, in the light of his experience of nrabia saw very strong objection to laying down fixed boundaries as represented by a line on the map in the hinterland of the Trucial Sheikhdoms, Muscat, etc. such a line was meaningless so far as tribes and local rulers were concerned. The tribal boundary was tne only real one. Moreover, the situation in the hinterland was essentially fluid ana a line which might represent the position at the moment would be unlikely to do so, say, in ten years' time, even if the general political situation remained the sane, ana certainly would not do so once any major political alteration (such as the death / . of Ibn Saud, the death of Ibn Jiluwi, or the reassertion of the influence of Abu Dhabi) had taken place.5. possiloility of settlement on a tribal “basis . T itiile a triloal tasis was likely to te very mucli more satisfactory than a territorial basis, Mr. Thomas saw great difficulty in a settlement of this nature. He admitted that if might he possible to earmark settled elements of particular tribes such as the Manasir and to separate them from the nomad elements for the purpose of a tribal settlement. But he repeated that tribal allegiances were very light and varied very rapidly, that the area of the dira or circle within which a tribe operated might well be affected by failure of grass, etc, ana that individual Sheikhs were not necessarily in a position to pledge tneir tribes to a certain allegiance. Political prestige in th^sa areas was largely a matter of wealth ana patronage, and Koweit, Abu Dhabi, Nejd and Muscat had in the past exercised an influence the extent of which had varied largely from time to time according to their economic position and their power to extend patronage.. He thought we should be incurring great risks if at this stags we entered into any written settlement with Ibn Baud which attributed certain tribes to him. Incidentally the Manasir were historically |an Abu Dhabi tribe, although in the last five or six years they had paid zakat to Ibn Baud. 4. Ibn Saud^ influence, to the east of the Blue Line and the payment of zaKat . Mr. Thomas in the first place confirmed a suggestion already made from the Gulf that zakat represented no more than a mild form of insurance carrying with it no suggestion of suzerainty or sovereignty and corresponding closely to the ancient danegeld. It would be dangerous in his view to base any/hhumbbHII^I - 3 - any settlement merely on the fact that zakat hah been paid hy a particular trihe at any ^iven time* What in practice happened was that a trihe which fauna itself engaged in hostilities with another neighbouring tribe, which, like itself, had not paid zakat to, say, Ibn Saud, seized the opportunity, by sending a camel or some small similar tribute to Ibn 3aua to secure his moral support in any raiding which it might undertake. Tne danger ana the occasion over, the payment of zakat would lapse. Or again, nomad tribes might tender an offering to Ibn Saua, or to Ibn Jiluwi, if they found themselves in tne course of their wanderings near the borders of Nejd or close to some area in which Saudi influence was strong. They certainly would not regard themselves as committed to any permanent allegiance to Ibn Saud by such a payment. Or again, a member of the sheikhly family, who had designs on the ruling sheikh, or who found himself threatened by that sheikh, would send a present to Ibn Jiluwi by way of strengthening his hands against his own ruler. 5. Influence of Ibn Jiluwi o Mr* Thomas was of opinion that the influence of Ion Jiluwi was the most substantial feature of the Saudi regime in north-eastern nrabia. Ibn Jiluwi's strongly marked personality, his strength, and his severity had acquired a great influence for him among the Bedouin. In Mr. Thomas' opinion the influence of the Saudi Government in the hinterland of tne area to tne east of the Blue Line was likely to be very substantially reduced with Ibn Jiluwi's death. Ion saua, unless he could fina an equally dominating lieutenant, would not himself be in a position to carry anything like so much weight. The/1 - 4 - 6. The religious conilict . Mr. Thomas said that there was no question the Toahhi tribes of Oman being willing to accept Sauai overlordship or enter into relations with Ibn Sauci. They were definitely and positively hostile on religious grounds and would certainly be opposed to any Sauai attempt to absorb them. This was true to a less extent of the shafi tribes, which might or might not be prepared in certain circumstances to support or pay zakat to Ibn saud. Qc 5araimi . The tribes of Baraimi, while one section of chon the Al bu Shamis, had paid zakat to Ibn Saud, would certainly strongly resent any endeavour on his part to exercise effective control over them. In this connection hr. Thomas referred to the great importance up to recently of Abu Dhabi, a sheikhdom which had for very many years been one of the most powerful in the Persian Gulf (compare his remarks in para.3 above). As regards the boundaries of Muscat , the Q position was that it was difficult, if not impossible, to set out their specific limit in the hinterland. The Imam ana tne Ibadhi tribes were for practical purposes, though not iormally, independent of the sultan. For religious reasons they would, however, be likely to be equally hostile to Ibn Saud. In the south-east, in 'Dhofar, there had never been any question of Saudi ^influence. Ibn Saud had sent emissaries to the Saar Manahil, etc. But these tribes, together with the El Kathiri and the Lahra tribes of the southern steppe, did not pay zakat to Ibn Sana and had rejected overtures made/ ' M 1■SBSMh* [ Thomas Art.lD ia, Felix, 281=, 1 / Phi^yx The Tmpty Quarter, I p.232-3. made to them hy emissaries sent to them hy the King^ The tribes which used the sands aid pay zahat to Ibn Baud in a loose sort of way, but it would be dangerous to base too much on this. J «G «L • 19.10.34o INDIA OPT 1 ICS. * An occasional section of the A1 Kathiri, e.g. the Rashid, living in the Sands and exposed to the depredations of the A1 Murra,will at intervals of years pay Zakat, particularly when pastures are to the Northward. The fact that Mr. Thomas, with a Rsishidi escort, was in the later stage ox his journey across the Ruha al Khali (from Bunaiyan Northwards) endeavouring 0 to avoid the 7/ah ah i elements in the North, while Mr. Philby, even with a Saudi escort provided by Ibn Jiluwi, could not move south of shanna&gt; helped to illuminate the position.happens at the time to be the most powerful of the nei gab curing i^rabian rulers, if Thomas is right In stro*sSj.ng uUis point t-o cho extent h.8 cloos, it is perhaps more important than ug at first thought that we should' - avoid tying our hands by any premature recognition of Saudi territorial sovereignty over a wide area over which it may no longer extend in practice when ibn Sand cij.es '.uo. nis personal prestige begins to be forgotten* indeed it seems possible, from Dome of Thomas’s remarks recorded in the note enaL oaod in y 0 ur letter, that Saudi influence over some of the northern tribes in the desert area may wane even before ibn Baud’s death* if Jbn Jilnwi„ Tflione personal prestige has apparently clam so much to being these tribes wi thin I bn 3 aud 1 s sphe re, ue r c to cl i e appe ar, Z+ yhe main object of my tentative suggestion would be to try to meet this difficulty by the creation of a special 'desert gone”, within which it would still be possible for Ton Baud to maintain Ms present .loose OQtsSDTiSahip . vcu the- tribes, but in respect of which#J&gt;t it5 %KI !»?! )8B f «ii ?r4 fcemrift nn olai.-ia ti tv» area to the weet of the Xiao 4eeoviV'3 in lira 1 \iraph 6 above. apeeiaX provision nl.-tht (H' } v t - ,r r,'T the tteotfe** of the line between Me jran smd %&gt;.c c vioXet line, where tt may mireh with the Wren. 0, fithln the n closert o^oa 1 ' non© of the. parties to the convention would pooecas &amp;n^ exclusive territorial mc.- id mmmtam ri^ita. on&amp; in particular the*; would undertake to refrain froca ^vmtlns mg conceosions and from eatabliahing afn$- pirRenrnt foxtif 1 cations* would also undertake not to raise objections to tlie paasap over this area of each other l o aircraft* But a system of loose over lord ship miiht perhaps be described ^Irloh would recognise ibn saud f s present aejfaoto rights.

I an seizing a oopy of this letter to Hind, Tours everP.2.66X9/1934 wmsiaii owxoe, s.w.x (E 6039/279/91/ 23rd. October, 1934. * My dear Gilbert, X haYe ahown Dalton’s letter Mo*P.3.6039/34 of the 26th September, about frontiers in Eastern and South-Eastern Arabia, to Kyan who has read it with great interest. He says that he too has been attracted in the past by the idea of a settlement based on the attribution of tribes rather than of precise areas, and he still sees great force in the arguments adduced by Fowls in support of it. It should, he agrees, certainly be borne in mind as a subject for further exploration but it appears to be open not only to the objection indicated by Fowl© himself in the second sentence of paragraph 7 of his note of the 21st September, a copy of which was enclosed in Walton*s letter to me, but also to the objection that, in the event of future economic developments, e.g* projects for exploiting oil, it would be very important to know to whom particular geographical areas belonged. As regards Fowle’s own objection, it will, in Hyan* s *iew, be of great importance to prevent Ibn Saud from establishing the position that he can extend his authority to the sea board between the coastal rulers. He recalls in this connexion a statement made not long ago by the Sheikh of ^atar that there was an area between him and the 1 Sheikh of Abu Dhabi which they regarded as a neutral zone, but « in which Ibn Saud exercised authority which they could not dispute. It is interesting to not© that the frontier settlement between Ir&amp;&lt;i and Bejd in 1922 was approached from the point of view of an attribution of tribes - see Article 1 of the Treaty of Mohommerah. Hyan suggests that it may perhaps be worth while to refresh our memories as to the evolution by which that Article was superseded some months later by the first irotoool of U^air. 2 . I do not myself think that there is any fundamental disagreement between Fowle and ourselves. We fully realise that '• Laithwaite, Esq., allegiance/allegiance in Arabia is tribal rather than territorial, and that it is not physically possible to draw olear-cut frontiers in the desei't* &lt;»e are indeed already approaching this question on a tribal basis, e*g* we have ashed Fuad Haiaza and the Saudi Minister to let us know aver what tribe a Ibn Saud claims to rule, nevertheless, the difficulty foreseen in paragraph 7 of Fowle’s note is a very real one. If we were to try to define Ibn baud 1 s dominions merely by tribal allegiance - and we are agreed that some definition has now become necessary - nothing would be easier than for Ibn 3au&amp; to claim rights over all members of his tribes wherever they were in Eastern or Southern Arabia, and to use tribal migrations for pegging out claims ^ich would eventually become claims to territorial sovereignty. 3. Th* fact is that the old days of personal, as opposed to territorial, nationality are coming to an end even in Arabia. Even there territory, like territorial waters, must bear some kind of national label - even if it is only an artificial one - because it is no longer politically practicable, with modern developments such as air coiamunieations, the discovery of oil and minerals, etc. to have a vacuum. 4. Our suggestion for a definition of a South Eastern frontier for Saudi Arabia, which should be theoretically co terminous with the frontiers of the territories of the Arab rulers under our protection, was intended to take all these factors as far as possible into account. My own idea was that the frontier should, wherever possible, be laid down - theoretically and geographically, and not, of course, on the ground ~ in the emptiest possible places and as far as possible from the areas effectively administered by either side. It would correspond to a line dividing national rights over certain wide gulfs or inland seas. It would then be possible to work on the basis of the existence of a wide geographical belt on the scavard side of the new frontier, which would be in effect a no-man 1 s- land which we should not regard outselves as bound to protect in any sort of way , but where Ibn Saud w omM ,.bewareeluded ,.fr^S MMk M f3. itoriL a„Q^l;:.ij;,:■ ^ or claiiaing any territorial rights. 5. You will remember that the Air Ministry have always taken the line that the Koyal Air Force must have a fairly large area of virtual no-man* s-land in which 'to turn round n . It seems to me that if the artificial frontier were pushed as for into the desert as possible, it would be possible for the Air Ministry to regard this wide belt on the seaward side of it as a sort of empty area which would enable them for example, to pursue retreating raiders without crossing Ibn Saud f s frontier. fhe artif icial frontier line thus laid down would, therefore, be more of an insurance for a remote future against unnoticed and dangerous expansion than an effective 'frontier” even in the sense of the desert frontier between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Ho doubt Ibn Baud’s tribes would migrate from aide to side of the frontier. !Phey would remain his subjects, but if they reached any places where there was a territorial administratiai on the non-Saudi side of the frontier, they would be subject, as foreigners, to the territorial administration, fhe position would be much the same, in fact, as it is in Barth-Eastern IronsJordan or Western Koweit, where tribes owing allegiance to the various territorial rulers concerned wander b.. clcwards and forwards but still maintain a main habitat or domicile in the country of their main allegiance and are subject to various local arrangements, so as to avoid duplication of taxation etc. I fear that I have set down our views on this subject at rather undue length, but I thought that you might care to Have a full statement of the position from our point of view, and might perhaps like to have them in a form in which they could be communicated bodily to Fowl©.

Mr. Millard of the American Embassy came to see me this morning on this subject, and said that a report had reached the State Department that H.M.Government had reached an agreement with Ibn Saud by which the latter formally recognised the validity of the frontiers in south-eastern Arabia established by the Anglo-Turkish Conveitions of 1913/14. The State Department would be glad of any information as to whether this were the case. 2. I explained to Mr.Millard that the position was still as it had been described to the United States Government last summer (see E 2481 and E 4327), and as I had myself explained it to Mr. Loomis on the 20th July (E 4784/2369/91) • The boundary line agreed upon with the Ottoman Government in 1913 and ’14 was still internationally legally valid, since Saudi Arabia was one of the Succession States of the Ottoman Empire, and was therefore bound by the same frontiers, where they bounded its territory, unless some new frontier were establish ed by a new and formal aagreement. We had made the position perfectly clear to Ibn Saud and to the United states Govern- j ment, and as this position was the legal position in inter national law it was unnecessary that Ibn Saud should formally recognise it. In point of fact Ibn Saud had raised certain objections to our attitude, as he maintained tnat he had authority over certain tribes extending to the east of the blue and violet lines. But this did not affect the legal position. 3. I asked Mr.Millard whether this enquiry was concerned with /- 2 - n &amp; i h wit»ii 'tli® Saudi Concession 'to t-he Standard Oil Company of* Caliiornia. He replied that it was, as it might affect the Company ii theie wej. e any Question of moving the eastern frontier of Ibn Saud’s dominions a few miles to the east or the west* I repeated that I had explained the position quite clearly to Mr.Loomis, and that, while Ibn Saud was perfectly free to grant any concession he liked within his dominions as bounded by the nnglo-Turkish Convention lines, he had no rights whatever to grant any concessions to the east of those lines. Mr.Millard said that this seemed clear and reasonable enough, and that he would report accordingly. He said that Mr.Loomis had left England immediately after seeing me on the 20th July and had not reported the result of his talk with me to the American Embassy. 4. As it is possible that we may yet reach some agreement with Ibn Saud providing for some modification of the blue and violet lines, I thought it well to tell Mr .Millard before he left that, while the legal position was as 1 had described it, the possibility was not excluded of some small modification in the line being made later on by mutual agreement, to provide better local tribal conditions etc. Nothing of the sort had, however, yet been done.

The valuable report contained in jj • Colonel Looh’e letter of 12th December, C.&amp;63-la/38, shows the present position, so far as can be ascertained, in the northern part of the area in question. Fran that report it appears: (a) that the Sheikh of Qatar regards a line running roughly fran Salwa to the head of the Khor al Odeid as his southern boundary. Such a line is practically identical with that which has been recognised in the past by His Majesty's Government as the southern boundary of the Sheikh's territories (can pare India Office memorandum P. Z. 614/34: B. 430) , oin^elv (save at SaEak) with the and it corresponds closely ^ limit/ ^ Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.2 limit which has been accepted by His Majesty’s Government for the guarantee of protection which they were prepared to give the Sheikh in the event of his granting an oil concession in his State to a company approved by them. The statements made by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and his uncle as to the Western limits of the territory of Abu Dhabi are also sufficiently consistent with the acceptance of this line; (b) that the coast between Q,atar and the tip of the Musandim feninsula definitely belongs to one or other of the Trucial Sheikhs; (c) that east of the Blue Line, Ibn Saud is j locally regarded as holding the territory west of a line running Sakak-Mabak-Jabrin and in particular as holding Sakak and Mabak, where the A1 Murra, 'who are generally regarded as under Ibn Saud', have had settlements for the last 12 years; (d) that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi is not prepared to commit himself as t o sovereignty in the area lying between the line Sakak-Mabak-Jabrin referred to in (c) and the western boundaries of Abu Dhabi described in (e) below. While Jabrin lies well to the west of the Blue Line, any negotiations with Ibn Saud in which His Majesty’s Government take their stand on the Blue Line must, of course, proceed on the basis that all territory lying to the west of that line is in the undoubted sovereignty of Ibn Saud; (e) that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi himself claims not only Aqal and the Sabhakhah al Matti with its hinterland as far as Al Rimal, but the whole of the hinterland to the east of the Sabhakhah al Matti as far as/3. as Baraimi. It may 'be noted that His Majesty’s Government have in the past formally recognised both the Sabhakhah al Matti and Aqal (with the Khor-al-Odeid) as forming part of the territories of Abu Dhabi (compare the Appendix to India Office memorandum P.Z. 614/34; B.430). Prom the note on page 262 of Mr.Thomas's 'Arabia Pelix' it appears that the northern boundary of Al Rimal in the region 51° East longitude may be fixed at Banaiyan. While to the east of that point the Sands continue northwards to the shores of the Persian Gulf, this area is not, according to Mr.Thomas, regarded as Al Rimal by those best acquainted with the Sands. The Sheikh admits that within the area between the Sabhakhah al Matti and Baraimi zakat has in recent years been from time to time collected from certain tribes on behalf of Ibn Saud. But it seems clear that in the case of the Bani Yas he has acquiesced in such payment only under protest and that there are special circumstances in the case of the Manasir. It seems unnecessary to attach any special importance to payments made to some extent in special circumstances by certain sub-sections of the seven tribes living in the neighbourhood of Baraimi, and the important point is that the vSheikh of Abu Dhabi not only claims, but appears effectively to exercise a degree of jurisdiction in the hinterland, particularly in the Dhafrah and Liwa areas and as far East as Baraimi. (f) that despite the activities of his zakat collectors, there is nothing to show that Itm Saud has/4. has ever established prescriptive rights of suzerainty, much less of sovereignty, over any part of the Trucial ooast between the Saohakhah al Matti and Baraimi. 3. The question of the boundary in the south western area is primarily one for the Colonial Office. Tne Secretary of State notes, however, from Sir Bernard Reilly’s despatches to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No.263 of 3rd October and No.296 of 14th November 1S34, that the resident is of opinion that, subject to the result of further enquiries which are being made locally, it would be desirable to claim the edge of the Sands as the northern boundary of the Hadramaut and to include in the Aden Protectorate on strategic as well as on political grounds all territory lying to the south of the Empty Quarter and to the west of the boundaries of the Sultan of Muscat. 4. The information which has been collected places His Majesty’s Government in a position to reach certain conclusions as to the maximum concessions in the area to the east of the Blue Line of the 1913/14 Conventions which could be made to Ibn Saud in return for a satisfactory settlement of the other points outstanding between the King and His Majesty's Government. The Secretary of State agrees with the Government of India that the main objectives of His Majesty’s Government are: (a) to prevent Ibn Saud from extending his authority to the coast south of 0 ; atar or acquiring further influence over the Sheihhs of Qatar and the Trucial Coast, who are in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government; (b)/' ^ /li 5. (Id) to prevent so far as possible the desert area adjoining the territory of those Sheikhs from being exploited under the aegis of Ibn Saud by foreign companies for oil or minerals. The geographical limits to be set to any concession to be made are examined in greater detail below. The first question for consideration is whether His Majesty’s Government should aim at a settlement on the ba.sis of: (a) a frontier based on tribal divisions; or (b) an arrangement providing for definite territorial limits to the dominions of Ibn Saud on the one hand and of the proteges of His Majesty’s Government on the other. 6 . The Secretary of State, like the Government o: India, is much attracted by the suggestion of a frontier based on tribal divisions such as is recommended by Colonel I 1 owle and supported both by Colonel Dickson, whose great experience of Arabia must carry weight in a connection such as the present, and by the observation recorded by Mr..Bertram Thomas. He agrees with the Resident that there is much to be said against a geographical frontier laid down in a desert, and in practice an arbitrary line in a desolate area, sparsely peopled by a nomadic and primitive population, is open to many objections. But on a review of the position as a whole and in the light of the information now available he agrees with the Government of India, that, for the reasons given in their telegram of 27th December, such solution would not appear best calculated to achieve the main/main objectives referred to in paragraph 4 above. He is apprehensive, too, that were His Majesty’s G-overnment in discussion with Ibn Saud to aim at a frontier based on tribal divisions, they might find it difficult, in the light of the information received from Colonel Loch as to the payment of zakat to Ibn Saud by individual tribes or sub-sections of tribes, to establish the position of their Arab clients as conclusively as they would wish, or to dispose effectively of Saudi claims which they might regard as devoid of any real foundation. 7. In these circumstances the Secretary of State feels that His Majesty’s Government have no option but to aim at a settlement on the basis of territorial boundaries. The main alternative solutions on this hypothesis are: (a) a relatively small territorial concession to Ibn Saud immediately to the east of the Blue Line. This concession might or might not be subject to the ’’servitude” that no mineral or other concessions would be granted within it by Ibn Saud, save after consultation with His Majesty’s Government and to a group approved both by His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Arabian Government; (b) in addition to (a) the establishment of a desert zone, (within which neither Ibn Saud nor His Majesty's Government would exercise any territorial sovereignty or grant any concessions) on the general lines put forward in Mr.Rendel’s letter to Mr .Laithwaite of 7th November 1934; (c) in addition to (a) the cession to Ibn Saud in full sovereignty, either personal or territorial, but subject to the servitude referred to in (a), of a further area, much more restricted in size than the deser^ zone referred t o in (b) . 8 . The Secretary of State has closely examined the alternatives/9 / T i alternatives discussed in the preceding paragraph. He is strongly of opinion that it is desirable from all points of view to reach a reasonable settlement of the matters now in issue and he agrees with the Government of India that, given the element of uncertainty as to the legal position of the Blue Line and the unquestioned, even though somewhat vague and precarious, influence exercised in certain areas to the east of it at the present time by Ibn Saud , it would be well worth making some concession to the King in return for an agreed limitation of his encroachments and a formal and Dinding agreement which would delimit the spheres of influence or control of the ruler of Saudi Arabia on the one hand and of His Majesty’s Government and their protege’s on the other. But he considers (and he trusts that Sir John Simon will agree with him) that His Majesty’s Government snould in the negotiations make the fullest play with the general strength of their position. He notes in particular the statement made by Sir A.Ryan in the Middle East Committee, which has carried much weight with him, that 'Ibn Saud was less impressed by legal considerations than by fear of His Majesty’s Government and anxiety lest they should use their power to compel him to accept the rlue uine', and in forming his conclusions he has not overlooked tne indications available to His Majesty’s Government that the Saudi Government, strongly as they may feel about tne Blue Line, do not feel entirely certain of their position in a dispute on this question with His Majesty’s Government.8 9. The Secretary of State suggests in these circumstances that His Majesty’s Minister might open his negotiations on the basis of a relatively small concession to Saudi Arabia immediately to the east of the Blue Line. The Government of India would be prepared to go as far as the line Sakak-Mabak, which corresponds to the area within which Ibn Saud exercises sovereignty, and possibly also (cf.their telegram of 3rd January) to cede a strip of territory running to the 20th parallel of latitude. Subject to the views of the Service Departments the Secretary of State would be prepared to recognise Saudi sovereignty within an area east of the Blue Line, bounded on the north by a line running from the head of the Dohat-as-Salwa to a point slightly to the south-east of Sakak, but leaving Sakak to Saudi Arabia; on the east by a line running from the extremity of the northern boundary just described by the north-western extremity of Aqal (Lorimer, II: 88/9) due south via, but west of Banaiyan, to the 20th parallel of latitude in the Rub’al Kali. Sir Samuel Hoare recognises that this would involve the abandonment of Sakak to Saudi Arabia, the acceptance of Saudi sovereignty up to the frontier of Qatar, and the attribution to Ibn Saud of the area between the line Sakak-Mabak-Blue Line and the western limits of Abu Dhabi to which his claim is at least doubtful. The latter area appears to be desert and of little real importance. The position is different as regards Sakak/0 \ 9. Sakak. The Air Council have in the past made it clear that they regard it as most important that this place should be regarded as falling within the dominions of Qatar, so that it should be open to His Majesty’s G-overnment to make use of it in connection with the protection which it is proposed to give to the Sheikh of Qatar in the event of his granting an oil concession to a company approved by His Majesty’s G-overnment, and that they should be at liberty if necessary to pursue raiders across the Qatar protection limit. The strategic considerations involved in any relinquishment of Sakak to the King of Saudi Arabia are primarily matters for the Service Departments, who will no doubt independently express their views upon them. Subject to those views the Secretary of State is at this moment content to say that, while he recognises the desirability of including Sakak in the territories of a ruler under our control or in special treaty relations with us, he feels that the confirmation now received from the Gulf that Sakak and Mabak are locally regarded as being under Saudi control and that the A1 Murra, who are in close relation with Ibn Saud, have been established at these points for at least 12 years, coupled with the information previously received as to the existence of Ikhwan colonies there, materially alters the position. He is in these circumstances disposed to think that the potential/10. potential inconvenience to which His Majesty’s Go'/ernment 'b® subjected in connection with the grant of protection to Qatar 7/ere Sakak to fall outside its limits would on the whole, from the political point of view, be a relatively small price to pay were it possible in return to secure the limitation of Ibn Baud’s encroachments elsewhere in the hinterland of the Trucial Coast. This is more particularly the case as it should be possible to demand retribution from Ibn Baud in the event of raids across the Qatar boundary from territory formally recognised as appertaining to him. Within any area so conceded the Secretary of State would on the whole be disposed to agree to the full exercise of sovereignty, including the right to grant concessions without prior consultation with His Majesty’s Government, by Ibn Baud. 10. If there seems no prospect of any settlement in return merely for the concessions discussed in the preceding paragraph His Majesty’s Minister might then be authorised to offer a settlement on the broad general lines suggested in g o Mr. Rendel ’ s letter, S. 67 69/279/91 of 7th November 1934, to Mr.Laithwaite. Under such a settlement, in addition to the territorial concessions to Ibn Baud/11. i tribes/ Saud in the country immediately to the east of the Blue Line referred to in paragraph 9, a special Desert Zone would be created, within which rights would be personal but not territorial. Within this zone neither Ibn Saud nor His Majesty’s Government (acting on Dehalf of their proteges) would possess any exclusive territorial rights and His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud alike would renounce certain rights or claims, particularly in regard to such acts of territorial sovereignty as the granting of concessions and the establishment of permanent fortifications. Both parties would further undertake not to raise objections to the passage of each other's aircra,ft. The Desert Zone would be subject to a special Desert regime to last in the first instance for a period of say, 10-20 years, subject to reconsideration at the end of that time at the instance of either of the High Contracting Parties. The re'gime would be so devised as to enable Ibn Saud to maintain any personal rights at present effectively exercised by him over the nomadictribes, such as the right to levy zakat. The Desert Zone would be established and the desert regime regulated by a formal agreement between the two High Contracting Parties. 11. The boundaries of any such Desert Zone might be defined by a line closely resembling that tentatively suggested in Mr.Hendel’s letter of 7th November 1934, referred to above. Such a line would run fran a point immediately south of the Wells of Banaiyan east-south-east to the intersection of Meridian 55 and Parallel 22; thence due south to the intersection of Meridian 55 and Parallel 20; thence (subject to the further observations of the Resident at Aden and the Secretary of State for the Colonies) along the edge of the Southern Sands to a point a given number of miles due north of Tarim in the Wadi Hadramaut; from which point it would rej oin the boundary of the territory to be recognised as belonging to Ibn Saud in full sovereignty. 12. Boundaries/13. [ I 12. Boundaries such as those suggested for the Desert Zone would represent a generous concession to Saudi aspirations. It will be remembered that Mr. Philby, despite his special relations with the King and the fact that he was travelling under the protection of Ibn Jiluwi and with guides provided by him, never penetrated east of the 52nd Meridian or south of the 19th parallel; and Mr. Bertram Thomas, in conversation, has not taken a serious view of Saudi claims or influence outside tnose limits. But on the assumption that the Desert regime would be merely one of renunciation of exclusive rights and that its establishment would therefore be without prejudice to the rights in it of the Sultan of Muscat dr the Trucial Sheikhs, the Secretary of State, m the interests of a friendly general settlement, and on tne understanding that the fullest play would be made with the concession represented, would be prepared to agree to the boundaries in question. A Desert Zone so defined, and to the east, north and south of which all claims of any description were relinquished by Ibn Saud (His Majesty’s Government for their part relinquishing claims on behalf of their prot4g6s to the area lying to the west of it), would have the effect of keeping Saudi pretensions well away from the coast. The belt of territory between the boundary of the Desert Zone and the sea coast would moreover be sufficiently deep to mase it possible for His Majesty’s Government, should any question arise in future of granting oil concessions m the Trucial Sheikhdoms or in Muscat, to fix a limit for * viq which v/ould leave between that limit such concessions whicn y/uu-l f the Desert Zone an area within which and the border of the uesex the/ • l!the Royal Air Force, in diecharge of any obligations for protection undertaken to the local ruler, would be at liberty, snould occasion arise, to pursue and punish raiders. 13. The Secretary of State recognises that the adoption oi this solution would involve sterilisation of mineral development in the wide area covered Toy the Desert Zone for a considerable time to come, and that sterilisation is not only likely to be unpalatable to Ibn Saud but may even in some ways be unsatisfactory from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government. So far, however, as His Majesty’s Government are concerned, the Secretary of State feels that they have more to gain than to lose by sterilisation. The political problems involved in any development of this area might be expected to be considerable; the difficulty, given the climatic and the local tribal conditions, of satisfactory #r successful exploitation of such mineral wealth as it may contain would in particular be very great. So far as Ibn Saud is concerned, the Secretary of State recognises t-hat some difficulty may be experienced but hopes that it would not be beyond the power of His Majesty’s Minister to persuade His Majesty to agree tt such a solution. 14. If the Saudi Government are not prepared to accept ;he Desert Zone solution, which, on a broad view, appears :o be much the most satisfactory from the point of view )f His Majesty’s Government, the Secretary of State, subject to the views of the interested Departments, would :hen beready, as a compromise, to concede m full territorial or personal sovereignty to Ibn baud not on y the area referred to in paragraph 9 above, but, addition, a further area, subject to the 'servitudewithin that area no concessions would be granted by Ibn Saud, save after consultation with His Majesty’s Government, and to a group approved both by His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Arabian Government. The further area in question might roughly be contained in a rectangle running from a point due south of Banaiyan to the 20th Parallel of Latitude; thence due east to the point marked as Gardam on Mr. Bertram Thomas’s map; thence due north to meet a line running due east from Banaiyan. Having regard to the uncertainty as to the Saudi position in the Central Desert and to the facts stated in paragraph 12 above, he does not consider that if there is to be any question of conceding territorial sovereignty to Ibn Saud any more extensive concession could be justified. The concessions suggested in this letter, and that now suggested in particular, are in fact substantially more generous than that recommended either by the Political Resident or the Government of India, and the Secretary of State feels justified in suggesting them only because of the great difficulties likely to be experienced in any exploitation of this area and the desirability of a general settlement. 15. in conclusion, I am to say that while the Secretary of State’s views as to the maximum concessions which could be made by His Majesty's Government and the order of priority in which they should be considered are as set out above, he, like the Government of India, entirely agrees with Colonel Fowls that 'before making any definite proposals to Ibn Saud', His Majesty Government should 'extract from him a detailed statement east of present Blue Line and thus get hi2£ to/ of his claim16 . to put his cards on the table before we do n . As Sir Jonn Simon is av/are, incidental information goes to suggest that the Saudi Government are in considerable doubt as to the limits within which they should claim jurisdiction to the east of the Blue Line. His Majesty's Government, in the Secretary of State’s view, are in a strong bargaining position and he thimes it desirable, given the importance of the issues under consideration, that the.fullest possible use should be made of this. 16. Sir Samuel Hoare recognises that detailed consideration of the matters now under examination may take some little time and he is aware that His Majesty’s Minister, in view of the possibility that he may in the near future have to interview I bn Saud personally, is pressing for instructions. He would suggest in these circumstances that if it is impossible in the course of the next few days to reach agreement as to the detailed instructions to be sent to the Minister, Sir A* hyan should be informed that instructions will be sent at the earliest possible date and advised for the moment to concentrate, in any discussions into which he may be obliged to enter, on obtaining a clearer indication tnan has hitherto been afforded of Ibn Baud’s desiderata. If the King repeats that he lays claim to the desert as distinct from the coastal tracts, it would, in on Samuel Hoare's view, be desirable, at any rate as a first move, to take the line that His Liajesty's Government could not consider anything so extensive or so vaguely expressed and that while they are prepared, in the interests of friendly relations, to make some concession to Ibn Saud, they must insist that it small be on reasonable lines. It would, in his vie-w, go far to prejudice/17. prejudice the position of His Majesty’s G-overmnent in any detailed negotiations that may follow if the Saudis, after the conversations which have passed, in which no hope has been held out to them of any extensive territorial concessions, were to conceive the idea that His Majesty’s Government were in fact prepared to make very extensive concessions, even though in an uninhabited desert, in the interests of meeting them. 17.

Slavery. Instructions sent you in my despatch No.1052 but further instructions will follow as soon as possible on point raised in your telegram No.4. 5. South Eastern Boundary of Saudi Arabia. After consideration of views of Political Authorities in the Persian Gulf and Government of India, His Majesty*s Govern- ment suggest following programme for negotiations with Sauai Government. Concessions in each case are intended to form part of the general settlement. 6 . First stage- Request for clearer indication of Ibn Saud's desiderata. If King merely repeats his claim to whole desert except for coastal belt he might be told that so vague and extensive a claim to so vast an area, to which His Majesty's Government do not recognise him as Dossessing /IwU tn • 2 - possessing any ?valid title can form no basis for discussion and that while His Majesty’s Government are prepared to make some friendly concession this can only be within reasonable limits • 7. In any preliminary conversations with Ibn Saud you may not wish to proceed beyond this stage* But I fully realise difficulties with which you may be faced and X do not desire to tie your hands unduly. Matter is mainly one of tactics as to which you are necessarily the best judge and you are therefore authorised if you consider that no settle ment is likely to be attainable otherwise to proceed either with King at Riyadh or subsequently with Fuad Hamza as and when you consider it necessary or desirable to ? enter further stages suggested in paragraphs 8 and 9 below. 8. Second stage. Offer Ibn Saud in full sovereignty a relatively small area or stip immediately East of Blue Line as far as a line running from head of DOHAT-ES-SALWA to a point slightly south east of SAKAK (but leaving that place to Saudi Arabia) thence (leaving to Qatar and Abu Dhabi a strip of territory extending inland for ho less than 25 miles to West of head of KHOR-EL-ODEID) to North Western extremity of AQAL thence due southwards via (but to west of) BANIYAN to parallel 20 degrees North whence it would gradually rejoin Violet Line. 9. If this offer proves insufficient, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to consider ?adding— to it as a third stage a settlement on the lines suggested in Rendel's letter of November 7th to Mr.Laithwaite (copy in my despatch No.436) involving creation of Desert Zone under a special regime for a period of ten or twenty years subject to re consideration at the request of either party at the end of that time. (See also Conclusion One of Middle Sast Sub committee meeting of November 8th). Ibn Saud would maintain in /x 1 &gt; -3- ( in this Zone any personal rights which he at present ©^tsctively exercises over nomadic tribes there e«g* right to levy zakat but would not posesess ?territorial sovereignty and would therefore not be able to grant a concession. Desert Zone mut ♦ special regime would be defined by a separate agreement. Boundaries of Desert Zone would be approximately those suggested in Rendel’s letter but would exclude BANTYAN. 10. If you are eventually convinced that no satis factory general settlement can be reached on basis even this concession, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared in the last resort and in order to secure their desiderata in other directions to offer Ibn Baud lastly full sovereignty of a part at least of Desert Area referred to in immediately preceding paragraph subject however to 7 undertaking that no concession would be granted therefor by Ibn Baud except after consultation with His Majesty’s Government and to concessionnaires apjmoved both by His Majesty’s Government and by Saudi Government. Precise limits to be suggested for this additional area are still under consideration and further instructions on this point will reach you as soon as possible . Idea at present being explored is that part of proposed Desert Zone lying to west of meridian 52 might possibly be thus conceded to Ibn Baud. South end of this line continue ?appear to join 'ring fence' line of Neutral Zone at northern end of boundary between Aden Protectorate and Sultanate of Muscat and Oman assuming latter to run inland from HAS MALIGAR mut^_ Ali at right angles to coast. ULt/.-'-'t : 11. In any case however it will be important to obtain from Ibn Saud a categorical renunciation of any rights /rights or claim to any kind of* sovereignty outside frontier line suggested in paragraphs 8 or 10 or mut« 'ring fence' of Desert Zone (see paragraph 5 of Rendel’s letter to Mr. Laithwaite). It would also he desirable for His Majesty’s Government to retain flying rights not only over Desert Zone but also over any area which might eventually be conceded to Ibn Saud under paragraph 10. 12. You will no doubt in any negotiations make such use as you can of fact that any of these concessions would involve acquisition by Ibn Saud of rights over very large areas to which he has at present no legal claim and would release him from obligations of existing 'Blue Line' frontier from which he could not otherwise escape without great difficulty. 13. If you see any objection to any part of above programme I shall be glad to consider any observations you wish to offer. I trust however that present telegram will at any rate give you sufficient idea generally of desiderata of His Majesty’s Government to enable you to conduct preliminary discussions with King Ibn Saud at Riyadh if you proceed ?there or with Fuad Hamza. 14. Instructions on such points as landing grounds and flying rights, Saudi Government Debts, etc. will follow by despatch as soon as possible. -Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs-XX From Telegram From H*M. f s Minister, Jedda. to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs London.

Many thanks for those instructions which will certainly enable me to conduct the first round with Fuad although I must study paragraphs 8 to 11 more closely before I can submit any report by telegraph on them. Meanwhile I submit the following points in anticipation of first conver sations with Fuad, who reached Mecca only yesterday and has not yet proposed a meeting. future even if Fuad brings an invitation which latest indications make me think doubtful. Apart irom reasons of practical inconvenience which have some weight but are not insurmountable, I see increasing political objections to an unofficial visit. I do not expect Fuad to ?renew his impossible suggestion that ?all the negotiations should take place at Hiadh but impression is widespread that such negotiations are impending especially in view of position as regards Treaty of Jedda. This being so, my return, without having come to any definite agreement, might be misinterpreted locally ?as tfaiOJire and ?due_to pressure. Moreover King feels so nervous over the Blue Line question that it would be better to confine myself to conversations with Fuad as long as possible. I am now disclined to go to Riadh in the near• 2 - I propose, therefore, unless you see strong objections, to side-track any invitation, if I can do so without risk of offence, but intimate that invitation next summer would be welcome* I shall, of course, see King here in the interval. b. What maps are you using and what maps should I use in discussion with Fuad ? Map Department of Foreign Office has, I think, list of maps available here. Further supply by bag of those to be used would be useful. c. I appreciate the effect of distinction drawn between personal and territorial sovereignty but I am not clear as to how distinction should be defined juridically if necessity arises. May I have information on this subject, not necessarily by telegraph, if explanation is lengthy. -RYAN-Telegram From xx Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London. To Minister, Jedda. No.9.

I do not altogether understand force of your first argument against visit to Riadh since presumably some means, e.g. suitably worded official communi que, could be found to indicate that visit was intended that we should begin and not end negotiations. On the other hand local considerations must clearly be decisive. If therefore you consider it more advantageous to bring King into negotia tions at the end rather than at the start and if you are satisfied that evasion or non-acceptance of his invitation will not give offence I do not wish to press you to go to Raidh now. 2.

I am commanded 3y the Air Council to refer to Mr. Johnstone* s letter No. E.274/77/91 dated the 15th January to Wing Commander pirie forwarding a copy of the draft instructions which it is proposed to send to sir andrew Ryan as to the conduct of his negotiations with Idn Laud in regard to the eastern boundary of Arabia, and to offer the following observations thereon. 2. secretary Sir John Simon will be aware that at the various meetings of the Middle East sub-coimittee held during the last six months to advise His Majesty* s Government as to the attitude to betaken in regard to concessions to Ibn Saua m the neighbourhood of the blue line, the Air Ministry view has consistently been represented that the nearer Ibn Baud’s eastern boundary t was allowed to come to the boundary of Qatar the greater 3 would be the difficulty of implementing the guarantee of protection which His Majesty’s Government authorised the Political Resident in the Gulf to offer to the Sheikh of Qatar in return for the grant of an oil concession to a company approved by His Majesty’s Government. The Council again desire to point out that from a military point of view an extensive desert area west of Qatar would enable the greatest possible measure of protection to be axfoitnd to QAtar. In such an area an intelligence organization could be set up to give warning of raids and over it aircraft could fly in pursuit oi raiders. Under secretary of state, Foreign office,6/ 2. 3 . In the draft instructions, however, the council note that Sir Andrew i^yan is directed, after first endeavouring to, obtain from Ibn saud a more concise statement as to his desiderata, to offer him in full sovereignty an area east of the blue line bounded by tne line laiwa, east of sakak, the north-western boundary of Aqal and thence to the south towards Banaiyan. This, as Sir John Simon is aware, has the effect of making the boundaries of Ibn Sand's territory for all practical purposes contiguous with those of the Sheikhs of Qatar and Abu Ehabi, and thus rulin 6 out any possibility of obtaining early intelligence of raiulng activities or of pursuing raiders across tne frontiers of Qatar, in effect, tending to make the probled of protection one of extreme difficulty. 4. The Council realise, however, that for the last ten years Ibn Saud has had virtual sovereignty over the area which it is proposed to concede, that the territory contains many settlements of his tribes, and that it would be out of the question to expect him to renounce, at this stage, nis sovereignty in the district. They understand also, from su± scanty information as is available, that the settlements are of a more permanent nature than many in saudi-Ai^-bia, and they gather that in the opinion of the Foreign Office, the likelihood of trouble arising from this direction is remote since Ibn Saud should be capable of controlling the activities of his tribes in this area. 5. It is also understood that the Foreign Office appreciate that in the event of emergency arising it would be necessary to allow aircraft to take action against raiders whilst in Saudi territory.6* should these assumptions he aorrect, therefore, the Air Council do not wish to raise any objections to the draft instructions to sir Andrew Hyan. 7# Copies of tnig letter are being sent to the India Office, Committee of Imperial Defence ana war Office.

In further conversation on February 7th, Faud conveyed in studiously disarming language King’s views that it would oe preferable not to make outstanding questions subject of general negotiations but to deal with each on its merits as in the past. When conversations from which present proposal had emerged were begun last June King that he could not coordinate general policy. His Majesty's Government had diverted course of discussion to settlement of outstanding questions. His Majesty feared that if such questions were dealt with by way of general negotiations and these failed their result would be danger- I ously misinterpreted. 2. After some discussion of this communication in which I took no strong line but was mildly critical, Faud turned to question of Eastern frontiers. He asked to what form settlement of it would take. Would local Arab Rulers be in any way parties to discussion oi it ? He assured me that Ibn Saud had no desire to interfere oetween His Majesty's Government and those Rulers but said that King must consider Moslem and Arab opinion and must avoid any appearance of disregarding their position as Arabs.8. I replied that His Majesty's Government had never approached matter otherwise than as a question ot determining boundaries between Saudi Arabia and an ! area with which they and local Rulers were alone concerned. 1 I stressed fact that latter had placed themselves in our hands as regards foreign relations. 4. Faud said tnat opinion which King had in mind was very ill-informed. He suggested that settle ment would be easier if Rulers could be represented in some way by experts or if they would affirm their desire to be represented by His Majesty’s Government. 5. In view of new turn given to whole matter by Faud’s ommunieations I refrained from pressing him for precise statement regarding Ibn Baud’s desiderata for which I had asked on January 21st. 6. I promised Faud a communication about Kuwait but deferred it until I could study your telegram No. 23 wit with previous correspondence. I said that I was awaiting instructions about agent for proposed local conference at Bahrain. We visualised on other questions including that of Trans-Jordanian frontier but only incidentally. 7. My own view is that proposal regarding negotiations cannot usefully be pursued any further• 1 do not consider now that any of the concessions contemplated in paragraphs 8 to 10 of your telegram No. 8 would attract Ibn Baud sufficiently to induce him to give us satisfaction on our cuestions for the sake oi such concessions. On tii.e other hand Faud was so profuse in assurances of King settl ing all questions as to suggest that His Majesty is nervous. This may independent settlement with tribes of Kuwait and possibly other matters. I- 3 - Conceosion con'teiapla'ted in your 'telegram No. 8 were intended t&gt;o lorm comprehensive settlement of* outstanding Questions. If these are to be dealt with separately question arises whether His Majesty’s Government are still prepared to offer theip. There can be no settlement if they simply fall back on ^nglo-Turkish Conventions. difficulty of settlement on any basis whatever is greatly increased by introduction of Arab nation factor. I have explained importance of this in my despatch No. 17 and No. 28 which should reach you about 11th and 18th February. Its is enhanced by moderation of Faud's language under King’s instructions on February 7th as compared with his private expression of his own sentiments on January 2uth. 9. You may prefer to shelve question. If so, I can play for stalemete but this presents disadvantage that Ibn Saud will be left with a sense of grievance and as to future attitude ol His Majesty's Government. Alternative is, in my opinion, to follow out in your telegram No. 8 and to work simultaneously but independently for termination of uwait Blockade which is next most important outstanding question, lu. We must however be prepared for rejection of all proposed concessions not merely oecause of gr eates t of Ibn Baud's pretensions but because of his acceptance of principle that he must base his action to some 3 xtent on Arab nationalist view. I have be^n specula ting very tentatively as to possibility of a scheme based - an that of i.e. that His majesty’s Government is a n agreement between Ibn Saud Sultan of Muscat and Oman and themselves representing all Rulers from ’oxalic to- 4 - to natar vvioh express consent of those Rulers on lines of general : a. All parties to recognise each others independence b. all parties to recognise for a period existence o± a positive zone in which none would exercise any rights of territorial sovereignty. 11. This solution may be completely impossible. I cannot say that it would ne acceptable to Ibn Saud. In any case it would obviously require long preparation and possibly some sort of a conference to define the desert zone and to elaborate other deteils. Nevertheless I think it is worth examining. 12. I am sending full record of conversation by bag.
