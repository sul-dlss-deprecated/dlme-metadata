German interest in Turkish economics has continued active during March. The Middle East Society, to which attention has already been called, has held several meetings. In addition new societies have been founded. A “ Diirer Society ” at Constanti nople is to familiarise the Turks with German kultur in all its branches. A “ German-Ottoman Society ” 0 has been founded at Damascus, to cultivate social relations, but especially to spread the use of the German language and to discourage Erench, for which purpose the Turkish members of the society will receive lessons in German free. A Rhenish branch of the “ German Turkish Union ”t has been formed at Frankfurt to study the scientific and economic aspects of Turco-German relations and to found an institute for that purpose in connexion with the Universities, High Schools, and Libraries of S.W. Germany. Finally, a “ German Levant Association ”t has been founded in Berlin as a central organ of German trade, industry, and finance. This association will have branches throughout Germany, and is to begin at once to send agents to the Levant to study conditions and establish relations. All this belongs to the nature of what the Germans call “ Propadeutik ”—the careful preliminary study and grounding on which most of their success is based. And this is the point of view from which nearly all the press articles last month were written. The over-sanguine view that the Turkish pear was ripe to fall into the German mouth has disappeared—the Turks them selves having contributed not a little thereto—and the necessity for study, caution, and tact is now emphasised. An important article by Reinhard Junge in the Deutsche Export Revue, 10th March, discusses thoroughly “ Germany’s economic tasks in Turkey.” Her immediate task is, for her own purposes, to stimulate those branches of industry which serve to put the raw material into the market more efficiently, and those which do not compete with German industries, especially Oriental arts and crafts* But apart from these, Germany has the most urgent economic and political interest in helping the Turks to strengthen their own economic life and especially in respect of industries that serve the army.§ He points out that Germany is not a natural competitor with Turkey in precisely those branches of industry which must be reserved for Turkey herself—as e.g., England and Italy are—while there are many German products for which a wider market can be found in Turkey. “ Thus Turkey and Germany complement one another in a very ideal manner.” What is required in the first instance is tariff reform (which is already in progress— below), and German co-operation in fur nishing instructors, organisation, and capital. But the Germans must go to work very discreetly. Nothing could be more distasteful to the Turks than the sudden flooding of Turkey with German entrepreneurs, however good their intentions. Unhappy experience with English, Russians, and French has made the Turk suspicious. “ We must first show by our attitude in particular cases, that, because our interests run parallel with those of Turkey, we do not stand for the economic exploitation of the country.” Schemes, too, must be carefully and silently worked out in Germany before hand, and not sprung upon the Turk till they are ripe. Then, when a moment that suits Turkish wishes has been found, German entrepreneurs must betake themselves to Turkey as managers of * Nordd. Allg. Z., 20th March. f Fraukf. Z., 20th March.

H. Becker, in an article which the Hamburger Nachrichten (16th March) commends to the particular attention of its readers. He points out the danger of over-rating Turkish resources and under-rating the work necessary for exploiting them. Language, religion, and the psychological characteristics of the people must all he studied—“Anyone who is going to concern himself with the East, merely from love of adventure, had better stay at home.” “ The only superiority which the European brings with him is not intellectual but moral.” Moreover, the German merchant must lay aside not only his western prejudices, hut apparently all his most characteristic qualities. “ Smartness, impudence, loud and crude behaviour, self-exaltation, and treatment of Orientals as though they were a kind of nigger ” ! Besides these warnings, the Constantinople correspondent of the Kolnische Zeitung* in the third of a series of “ Constantinople War Letters,” dated 21st Eebruary, quotes articles from the Turkish papers Tasvir and Sabach of a somewhat discouraging nature. The former had attacked the proceedings of the German purchasing commission which has been trying to restock Germany at Turkish expense. But the correspondent points out that the Tasvir's remarks apply equally to the future. The supply of raw materials which Turkey produces and Germany and Austria require is the reverse of unlimited, and after the war, when she is finan cially exhausted, they will he her only wealth. The drain must therefore be regulated, and it must he remembered that the time when lurkey can really benefit the Central Bovvers by purveying raw material on a large scale lies still in a remote future. From the same point of view the Sabach criticised the proposal made at the Dresden economic conference that Turkey should join a Zolh erein of Central Powers. For many years to come the absence of communications and of internal development will make it impossible for Turkey to distribute her surplus products. There is no point in exporting wheat, wool and silk only to import flour, biscuits, beer and textiles, which is w hat would happen if Turkey w ere to play the^ role of agricultural state in a Zollverein with highly-developed industrial states. This is a natural point of view, says the correspondent, and w^e must give Turkey time—time especially for the new tariff' to bear fruit. „ r —“.7 m me uruaeuiscne Jiuqe- meine Zeitung of 12th and 28th March, and explained (in the light of an article by Ahmed Nessimi Bey, the Turkish Minister oi onmiuce) )&gt; r.

The Fosskche Zeitung of 11th March reports «•', 11 ^ f ^' 0th 'i (P resl dent of the Middle East Society) on “The .M iddle East in the World Economy.” He says that there is an extraordinary increase in the inquiries received by the Society as to the possibilities for German capital in Turkey, hut “it is urgently necessary to warn Germany against exaggerated economic hopes of i urkey; the flooding of Turkey with indigestible goods can only do harm, economically and politically.” The immediate goal must be the exploitation of its natural resources, and the great losses in shipping which all the belligerents have sustained make it essential to keep open the land line of communications with the Middle East. The Oder-Danube canal and the connection between Rhine and Danube must be made; and there must be one commercial language from Berlin to Bagdad—German as far as Constantinople, and German beside Turkish and Arabic to the Persian Gulf. Pears had recently been expressed in Turkey (e.g., by Talaat Bey) of the flooding of the country with German capital. This is due to the suspicion which Turkey’s experiences with the Allies have engen dered. Germany’s task is to dispel it. As a tangible pledge of good faith she should guarantee Turkey the full control of the Dardanelles and the necessary influence in the Balkans. The speaker then went on to discuss the agricultural rehabilitation of Turkey and especially of Mesopotamia. [The evening closed with another lecture on the latter region by Dr. Grassmann.] Turkey needs capital, machinery and men if she is to be maintained in her political and economic integrity. The other leading apostle of the same school, Dr. Rohrbach, addressed the General Evangelical Protestant Missionary Society on “ Germany, East Asia, and the East ” {Hamburger Nachrichten, 5th March). He began by pointing out the natural affinity between the German and the Chinese conception of the State, which makes Germany much more suitable than England to bring Western kultur to China. He next showed by statistics of population that it would be a critical matter for German kultur if the 400 million Chinese and the 30-40 million* Oriental Moslems fell under British instead of German influence. For the world would then be pre dominantly Anglo-Saxon, the Slavs being the sole counterpoise, and Germany’s 70 millions only “ an enclave in the world of Anglo-Saxon kultur.” To defeat this, Germany’s policy must he to create what he calls a “ Kulturweltvolkstum,” i.e., the German- Austro-Hungarian-Bulgarian - Turkish combine. This combine, working on inner lines, would hold both Russia and England in check—the former by controlling the Dardanelles, the latter by threatening the Suez Canal from Southern Syria, which must be made a military base. Everything depends on securing the participation of the East in this combine. And the final result will be as follows : Russia is absolutely excluded from civilisation —the world owes her nothing. The French and other Romance kulturs are doomed to decay through failure of population. Onljr Anglo-Saxon and German remain, and only the latter is capable of taking the leading place in the East. “ For we may say without pride—and the war has proved it—that German kultur has the greater intrinsic value.” The true future of Germany is to be a “ world-people,” and for this end German influence in the East and in East Asia is a necessary condition. It was, perhaps, these two lectures that moved Count Reventlow in the Deutsche Tageszeitung of 18th March to renew the protest of the blue-water school against the Berlin-Bagdad idea, which he describes as mischievous and misleading. Its realisation could never be an equivalent for the freedom of the sea, and, on the * The Vienna Gemeinderat have passed a resolution urging this latter scheme on the attention of the Government {Frankfurter Zeitung, 30th March).contrary, would lie the death-sentence on Hamburg, Bremen, and the &gt;vhole future of Germany. . Dr. Grothe’s remarks about, German as the commercial language of Turkey refer to the new Turkish language law. This is made the subject of a respectful protest in the Hamburger NachHchten of 10th March. It would, of course, he much more agreeable to Germany to associate in the Turkish language with a strono- and purely Turkish Turkey than in French with a 1 renchihed Turkey. But the Turks must keep within the limits of the possible, and it is not possible to learn Turkish in one year ; nor is it possible to conduct correspondence exclusively in Turkish. If the Turks want German capital they must reconcile themselves to the idea of so arranging matters as not to drive it away. The Russian successes in Western Persia have caused the German press to seek consolation in the supposed English anxiety regarding Russia’s southward push and consequent claims in Persia. This line of thought is also reflected in articles on the subject of a separate peace with Turkey. Thus, G. Bernhard, in the Vossische Zeitung of 27th March, sees no objection to such a peace, if voluntarily sought by Turkey, because of the discord it will sow between Russia and England, since the latter cmi hardly be content that Russia should compensate herself in Persia and Turkey for the territory she has lost in the West. To the Deutsche Tageszeitung (26th March), on the other hand, a separate peace is unthinkable. Germany requires a strong and independent Turkey, and a separate peace would mean, to-morrow, if not to-day, its partition into spheres of interest, the separation of Arabia, and the loss of the Dardanelles. And in Bkeinisch- Westfdlische Zeitung (25th March) Halil Halid Bey (formerly Turkish consul-general in Bombay) in an article 0 explaining why the Oriental loves the German, rather cruelly pricks the bubble of Anglo-Russian discord. The idea, he says, is preposterous. “ Anglo-Russian rivalry in the East is a thing of the past. Both power's are exerting them selves to work hand - in - hand not only to hold the East in subjection, to destroy the possibility of an Islamic renaissance, and to throttle Turkey, but also to close the ring round Germany by blocking the East to her.” Dr. Rohrbach, too, in the Deutsche Tageszeitung (15th [March) insists that Russia must continue to fight for the Dardanelles, and that the idea that she can be satisfied with a harbour in the Persian Gulf is “ quite dilettante.” Other articles of interest during the month were : “ Petrol and the fighting in Persia,” by Dr. L. Sommermeier in the Kolnische Zeitung of 12th March. He gives a good account of the distri bution of the deposits (mentioning Kishm among other places), and of the Anglo-Persian Oil Co.’s concession. He dwells on the difficulty of getting the oil to the market, and points out that one of the advantages of the Mesopotamian deposits is their proximity to the Bagdad Railway—which makes it clear how important it is in German interests that British influence should not be allowed * to cover them also. The deposits in N.W. Persia are jealously kept by Russia in order to give her a hold over the country, but are not exploited by her because she prefers that Persia should be supplied from Baku. So long as there are no railways running N. and S. there can be no competition from Southern Persia. “ But if in the future an efficient petrol industry, not controlled by Russian influence, were to grow up in the north also, it would of course eliminate the Russian oil imports.” “ The Hejaz Railway,” reprinted from the Archiv fur Eisen- bahnwesen in the Berliner Aktiondr of 25th March.

They desire a strong master, who shall, without scruple or hesitation, make the rule of law an actuality, secure life and labour, and increase the opportunities for obtaining wealth.”* The N.F.P. claims for Austria-Hungary an important place after the war in furthering the economic progress of Arabia. In this connection may be mentioned an article in the Kolnische Volkszeitung exhorting Austria-Hungary to strengthen her Catholic missions in Turkey. The Deutsche Tageszeitung of 30th March reprints, under the heading “ The future of Persia,” long extracts from an article in No. 4 of the organ of the Persian Nationalists appearing in Berlin. It adds nothing of its own worth mentioning except that the Russian occupation of Kermanshah and Ispahan is already felt by the English as a threat to their interests in the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf. * I he attention of the Arab Bureau has been called to this sentiment.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000250_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B223a</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000250</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B223a</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Memorandum by the Political Secretary, India Office, on German press opinion regarding the Middle East'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1916/1916</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-03-31T10:08:28</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (3 folios)</extent><extent>This file consists of a single document</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at f 15, and terminates at f 17, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
