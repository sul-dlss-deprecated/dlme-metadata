' ' ri . . * i- ') 'Ll% Uelatioids with Bin Sand — 2D Xf (Note bv Political Department, India Office.) I. The recent heavy crop of telegrams on tins subject have somewhat obscured the mam issues, and it may make for convenience if a statement is placed befo/e the Eastern Committee at this stage dealing comprehensively with the whole question. i ) . It is the case as pointed out in Baghdad telegram of the loth September, that the lecent orders of His Majesty s Government involve some departure from the policv adopted in March last. In his telegram of the 9th March 1918 Sir P. Cox submitted the following recommendations, which were approved by His Maiestv's Government: — 1 ^ 4 j „ ^ ' We recognise he [i.e., Pin Sand] may not find it possible to undertake operations on such a large scale as to enable him to capture Hail, and our operations are proceeding so well m Syria that we feel that there is no necessity to press him unduly m this connection, but at any rate it is still most important that he should maintain more effective control in Qasim and stop smuggling and put ical pies.-uie on bhammai*. Jo this end we are prepared to assist him with 1,000 more rides, 100,000 rounds, which Mr. Philby will place at his disposal as necessity arises. He may also regard as a gift the advance of two months' subsidy made him by Mr. Philby. As regaids liail, I do not consider Ibn Saudis really keen on taking it except in circumstances which make it apparent that he is doing so at^our bidding and undei om direction. At the same time, should good opportunity arise loi ins doing so, cither by diplomacy or force, with above meagre assistance, 1 understand there would be no objection to it in principle, eitiier on the part ot 1 lis Majesty s Government or High Commissioner. If it should come m to pass, 1 think we should be prepared to double Ibn Sand's subsidy or i ;ive him good lump sum. 1 trust general approval will be telegraphed to^our proceeding on above lines, and that General Olficer Commanding mav be authorised to supply rifles.' 3. The recent orders, conveyed in the Secretary of State's telegram of loth September, laid it down that Inn Sand should be kept as quiet as possible and should be restrained if possible from military activity or aggressive action in any direction ; and that ilis Majesty s Government were 'against increasing his armed strength or encouraging him to attack Bin Hashid at the present juncture.' In other words, our attitude towards the Ilail expedition has changed from somewhat lukewarm support to actual discouragement. 4. It may \vell be doubted whether Bin Sand would, in any circumstances, have seriously pressed an olTensive against Bin Rashid. But the policy of encouraging him to pursue the project had at least the advantage of diverting his activities from channels, likely to bring him into collision with the King of the Hejaz. The enmity between these two Arab chieftains is deep-seated. It reflects many years of rivalry between Mecca and Uiadh, aggravated by the personal jealousy between the two men and by the sectarian feud between Sunni and Wahabi. King Husain, apart from personal animosity, appears to be genuinely apprehensive of the spread of the Wahabi movement, of which Bin Sand is the figurehead, in the direction of the Hejaz. 1 his feeling was probably at the back of his recent action at Khurma, which is the immediate subject of dispute with Bin Sand. For the moment the situation is eased. Bin Sand is reported to have found a temporary diversion in the Koweit direction, where the Ajman and other tribesmen ar^ engaging his attention; while the King, probably as a result of our representations, shows a disposition not to force the pace at Khurma. But we cannot count on more than a breathing space, and the trouble between the two chiefs is certain to revive unless some modus vivendi can be found between them. S 19 40 9/185. The statement printed as an appendix to tills Note shows the line that we have taken with Bin Sand in the matter, and his own attitude towards onr efforts to promote reconciliation. The first question that arises is that of the proposed meeting between the tiro Chief*. King Husain has offered to visit his rival. Bin Sand evidently regards the offer with suspicion, but is prepared to agree to a meeting on certain conditions. Mr. Philby fears that a meeting might lead to conflict rather than reconciliation, and 'would on the whole recommend that visit be not encouraged. 1 ' Sir R. Wingate is strongly of opinion that a meeting between the two principals could serve no useful purpose,' and emphasises the objection to withdrawing King Husain for any considerable period from the personal direction of Flejaz affairs. He is more favourably inclined, however,, to an alternative suggestion made by the Foreign Office that au interview should be arranged between one of the King's sons and a brother of Bin Sand, and he is taking steps to sound the King in the matter. The result of these steps may perhaps be awaited. 6. The second question is that of British representation irith Bin Sand. The Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, has warned us that the result of the refusal of I lis Majesty's Government to replace the 1,000 unserviceable Winchester rifles presented to Bin Sand may be that Mr. Philby will find his position an impossible one, and that he will be compelled to terminate his mission and leave for the coast. In a subsequent telegram Captain Wilson has suggested that Mr. Philby, whom he regards as having a reached the end of his tether,' so far as his mission to Xcjd is concerned, should be allowed to proceed on leave, and should be replaced by an officer from Egypt, whose deputation u would allay King Husain's suspicions and pnt an end to the belief that our Arabian policies are not co-ordinated.' In a still later telegram, dealing with future British policy in Arabia as a whole, Captain Wilson recommends that 'it should now be ruled that, though the affairs of Bin Sand will continue to be ' dealt with by His Majesty's Government through Baghdad, henceforward any officer ' sent to Bin Sand will normally be a selection of the High Commissioner, Cairo, who u will be kept for the present fully informed of all developments.' Without prejudice to the question oi a general ruling on the lines advocated by the Civil Commissioner, the Department ventures to think that there is much to be said for a change of representation with Bin baud at the present juncture. In the lirst place, as explained above, the policy which Mr. Philby was sent to Riadh to carry out has been modified, and theie seems advantage in making the new departure svnehronize with the appointment of a new agent, the latter will be more favourably placed than our present icpiesentatne, who is deeply committed to the old policy, for giving effect to the ie\ise(l instiuctions of His Majesty s Government. Secondly, much benefit might accrue win biinging .a new angle of vision to bear upon the affairs of Bin Tr n here has been too much ol a tendency in the past for the two rival chieftains Bin baud and king Husain—to find their respective champions in India and Egypt, and lor tho whole controversy between, them to be reflected in a conflict of view between the two great administrations concerned. It is scarcely to be supposed that f? 16 ? ase ' 0, r r ! 10 P^sd'ility of turning it to advantage, is lost upon the fnLr, lel r t t eS '. , of an Egyptian officer to Uiadh would do KW t W 56 T e, ;; WS ^ 1,ome ' bo,h t0 Bin Siuld aml t0 the King, that there is unity in the counsels of His Majesty's Government. most''re!netant' the I' 681 ' 011 , of tlie 1,000 rifles.

Bin Saud may have little reason to complain if his demands are rejected on their merits ; but we must expect him to feel aggrieved, and even to question our good faith, if, having undertaken to supply him with a certain quantity of arms, we palm off on him weapons of unserviceable quality, and then refuse to make good the deficiency. It is to be feared that the whole transaction will wear an appearance of sharp practice,' which, in dealing with Arabs, it is most desirable to avoid. It may here be remarked that the Civil Commissioner does not support Mr. Philby's proposals for supplying Bin Saud with arms and ammunition on a further considerable scale ; and in any case these proposals, which were framed on the assumption that Bin Saud was to be encouraged to operate against Hail, are ruled out by the recent pronounce ment of policy by ilis Majesty's Government. 8, A few general observations may, perhaps be added. As mentioned above, the indications are that an early collision between Bin Sand and King Husain on the Khurma question need not be anticipated. Probably both Chiefs have taken to heart the warnings of His Majesty's Government. General Allenby's recent victory in Palestine, the lull extent of which is uncertain at the time of writing, should have a steadying influence on the whole situation. It ought to remove from Bin Sand's mind anv lingering suspicion that he has ' put his money on the wrong horse.' At the same time,-the contribution of the Hejaz forces towards the British success—if it proves to be as considerable as the early reports seem to indicate—will serve to emphasise the view, already plainly enunciated by His Majesty's Government, that King Husain's services and commitments to the common cause are out of all comparison with those of Bin Saud. This does not, of course, mean that we are to disregard the latter's just interests or to fail to carry out the terms of the treaty of December 1915, under which we (1) recognised his sovereignty over certain specified areas, to be delimited 'hereafter'; and (2) guaranteed his territories against ' aggression by any Foreign Power.' But it does mean that we are on firm ground in restraining him' from extravagant claims against his rival, and in requiring him to abstain from action likely to create strife and disunion among the Arab peoples. 9. To sum up, the Department ventures to recommend— (i) that as regards the proposal to arrange a meeting between representatives of Bin Saud and King Husain, a further report from Cairo should be awaited ; . (ii ) that Sir R. Wingate should be invited to depute an officer of the Lgyptian service to succeed Mr. Philby as British representative with Bin Saud ; (111) that the question of supplying Bin Saud with 1,000 serviceable rifles in substitution for the inferior weapons already delivered to him should be considered.
