The Secretary to the Government of India in the Jxtemal Ait airs Department, hew Delhi. AWiWil, 11 4 i&gt; A. .h;^. i • ii. J —.iALljk Sir, I have the honour to state that the Political Ag^nt. Kuwait has represented that the Sumptuary Allowance of Rs.100/' per month attached tp his post is entirely inadequate ana he requests that it be increased to Rs. POO/- per month. 2. When it is recalled that this gllowance was first made in 1904 and has not been altered, since, it seems unnecessary to point out that it is obsolete, doth the . . increase in the cost of living and the amount Oi entertaining which the Political Agent is now obliged to do, more than justify his request. 3. It is unnecessary to conduct research into the cost or living since 1904 in order to establish its increase in Kuwait. This has been in the neighbourhood of oOd/o as compared only with the period before the war. for example, an unskilled labourer now expects Rs.o/-^to Rs.6/- per day plus/nis fgod^as compared tp'annas 12/beipre. the war. x jio cwance m x „ provide _.ieir ermDloyees with 7 full furniture, cutlery, crockery, servants'ana food and with other items such as alcoholic, ■sn?TY:mt liquor and cigarettes at reduced rates. 4. In addition to the rise in the cost of living, the social obligations of the political Agent have greatly increased in proportion to the expansion of xhe ^inropean community, his increasing business with Ir a q&gt; and the growth m Kuwait town itself of a section of soci£ty from the more advanced Arab co'Jintries. The Kuwait Oil Company now employ over 80 Ruroueans and will soon be employing' twice as many; they are, indeed, now able to entertain on a scale impossible for “the political Agent who has to imoort all his stares. The Rpval Air Force Detachm-nt will probably be doubled in size m the near future. Service visitors and business men ' n on the pretext ttixxnxxs: oh the Political Agent to the Shaikh has always hotel offer xmjdbmxxfecotft: man rin or Rest Hpuse, it is incumbent them hospitality. His Highness, , . , . _ ,. appreciated western meals nut this example is now being followed,by others of his family and the Political Agent must return this hospitality. In addition there lias recently grow [upa Political Agent should neglect socially. Finally, it lias long been the custom that he should entertain periodically junior members of the ruling family and the leading merchants to , . dinners ;n the Arab xx style, It is not now possible for him to do tins on his pay and allowances, as one such dinner at to-day’s prices costs upwards of Rs. 250/-. I have therefore the honour to recommend most strongly that in consideration of the strength oi his case the Government of India should accede forthwith to the request of the political Agent for the increased allowance, with effect iron the 1st January 1946. I have the honour to be. Sir. Your most obedient servant, Sd/“ Geoffrey Prior.

My dear Pelly, I have been drying over the last few months to obtain certain household eoods which are essential for me here, but efforts to procure them in London have been most disappointing. No linen or blankets can be bought without dockets and what crockery is obtainab e is very ’'utility” and unattractive. 2. Stewart tells me, however, that when Trott was faced by similar difficulties the Foreign Office sent him out a complete set ot cutlery and crockery for 18 and several sets of linen at a very reasonable price. I wonder if you would be so kind as to ask the Political Resident whether e would approach the India Office to do for me what the Foreign Office did for Trott ? I enclose a list in duplicate of the things which I need most urgently and which I have not yet been able to 6btain. I shall be most grateful for an^thin^ the Political Resident can do.

I am deeply rateful to the Government of India for their kind and encouraging message of appreciation for the little I was able to do when In charge of the Kuwait Agency recently. Their reference to the 'interesting reports' which 1 submitted was a particularly generous gesture, as no one realises better than myself how lacking in literary merit my reports have alwa3 r s been. Your own personal thanks are also deeoly appreciated and valued by me, as you know one f s local difficulties, hopes and anxieties even more perhaps than the Government of India does. In conclusion may I assure you that I am ready always to afford you any further assistance that may lie in my power in the Political field requiring a knowledge of Arabic and the Arabs. I mean this seriously, as my one desire is to help in the war effort. I trust that you will not forget that I am an expert (in a modest way) in matters connected with II.M.King Bin Baud and the tribes of Saudi Arabia, should Government ever require work to be done in their direction.

I might explain that de Gaury telephoned to me on receipt of my letter of the 21st March and was almost frenzied in his appeals that he should be allowed to give notice^since he said that this would make the whole difference to his prospects of future employment. was as the result of this that I sent the personal telegram to you of the 23rd March. When however, having received your concurrence, I informed him that the Government of India were prepared to agree to his request he had apparently changed his mind in the interval and said that he now thought that it didn*t matter and that he would prefer to leave things as they were. I gotthe impression that he was inclined to cherish his grievance and he made the remark that he was too proud to argue. I am only sorry that we troubled you in the matter at all. As you may imagine, my position in breaking the news to de Gaury has not been a very happy one. Fortunately no question of* our being asked to recommend de Gaury for further employment will arise for the moment as I understand from the Foreign Office that he already leaving for Tehran where he is to be attached in some not very clearly defined capacity to the Legation. I imagine that he v/ill probably be doing some kind of Intelligence work. For the time being therefore the matter may be regarded as disposed of to the satisfaction, let us hope, of all concerned.

We would therefore make it clear that, so far as de Gaury’s handling of the Kuwait case is concerned, he may conceivably to some extent be the victim of circumstances. Nevertheless the fact remains that we cannot in the outcome, the ^ Shaikh’s attitude being what it is, and de Gaury’s part in the i! incidents at Kuwait having been fastened on him by opinion up and ii down the Gulf, usefully employ him further in the region. More- over, as we suggested originally when his appointment to Riyadh was mooted, and as indeed you imply in the last sentence of your letter, misunderstandings arising out of de Gaury 1 s Gulf reputation were not likely to make him the best person to represent His j^Iajesty’s Government at Riyadh, and we are not surprised to learn from the latest telegram that Ibn oaud has decided against having a British Representative there. Bullard's despatch of the 19th September 1939 and his telegram No.134 of the 13th October to the Foreign Office also struck a note of warning. 3* On the other hand, there is no doubt that de Gaury is a first class Arabist and, his technical c^ualificationb being what they are at a time when Arabic qualifications are of importance/P.Z. 1746 L 1940 j 3 ; importance, we hope it may be possible for the India Office to assist in securing his transfer to or to some similar employment elsewhere in the Arab world, where circumstances i that operate against his continued service under the Government of India would be absent. 4. We propose, as Prior suggests, to make good to de Gaury the pay for the leave which he had earned but from which he was recalled and with this proviso to give him notice forthwith. 5.

The Government of India in their Express Letter of the 29th February announced their decision to terminate Mr, de Gaury^ employment with the Indian Political Service and request that we should immediately communicate with him and give him the six months* notice required under the terms of his contract. Since his duties as Liaison Officerto Ibn Saud came to an end in February Mr. de Gaury has been in London awaiting the Government of India’s orders as to his further employment. Mr. de Gaury, who is now about 42 years of age, was an officer in the British Army when appointed on a two years* contract as Political Agent, Koweit in 1936? He was, I think, a 'discovery' of Mr.Laithwaite*s and had special Arabic qualifications and experience. After two years* service his employment was extended on ten years* contract from the 15th January, 1938, terminable earlier on six months* notice on either side. We have not got a copy of his contract but the terms will be found in the Government of India’s Express Letter of the 2nd December, 1937, P.Z. 8045. Mr. de Gaury remained at Koweit as Political Agent until he came on leave last summer. It was then understood that when he returned from leave he would be posted to Muscat as Political Agent. The war broke out while he was on leave and t in accordance with a recommendation by the late Sir Trenchard Fowle ( Mr. de Gaury*s services were lent to the Foreign Office to act as Liaison Officer with Ibn Saud at Riyadh. In the meantime Colonel Prior had taken up his appointment as Political Resident in succession to Sir Trenchard Fowle and had found on visiting Koweit that the Shaikh was nursing a/ i (6610) Wt.25956/235 10,000 9/38 (8650) Wt.40880/22 10,000 1/39 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd. Gp.6851 „ _ — 2 . a very definite grievance against Mr. de Gaury whom he definitely regarded as largely responsible for the troubles which the Shaikh had had over his Council during last year. The Shaikh had gone so far as to say that no Ruler in the Persian Gulf would be prepared to accept Mr. de Gaury as the British Representative. Subsequently Colonel Prior saw Mr. de Gaury in Bahrein and his letter of the 5th January to Mr. Caroe was the result, see P.Z. 332/40. He then told Mr. de Gaury, who enquiredabout his future posting# that he now doubted whether he would be suitable to Muscat owing to his lack knowledge of judicial work*and he recommended to the Government of India that as there did not seem any opening for Mr. de Gaury in the Gulf the best course would be to give him his six months 1 notice under his contract as soon as possible, in order that he might benefit by the present war conditions and obtain some other post in the Arab-speaking world. When we informed the Government of India on the 17th February that Mr. h. ^ de Gaury^ services were now again available^as his work under the Foreign Office had finished and enquired what orders they had for him^Colonel Prior telegraphed {l. tJvvt. adhering to ttri-s recommendation saying that after touring Muscat he was more than ever convinced that Mr. de Gaury was quite unsuitable for the post as th io tijno) Political Agent there.^ The Government of India have now decided to accept Colonel Prior’s recommendation and we are asked to convey the decision to him.

After consulting the Legal Adviser, whose note will be found below, it seems best to pass on the Government of India’s decision to Mr. de G aury in the same way, i.e. without stating any reasons. It may be anticipated that he will not accept it without some question and he will no doubt want to know why he is being treated in this way. In that case he will probably have to be granted an interview and allowed to state his case. The only line that we can take would appear to be that his contract is with the Government of India and that if he has any r ons to make in the matter he must do so to them. At the same time the Government of India might have given us some advice as to the line we should take in dealing with any representations from Mr. de Gaury and it would be useful to know whether they are prepared to recommend him for any further employment elsewhere. It is proposed to ask for their views on this point by telegram and a draft is submitted accordingly, together with a draft to Mr. de Gaury giving him the six months’ notice.

He left Koweit early in April hut is due to get hack hy about the end of May (since, being a contract officer, he receives One month's leave a year, and has only been at Koweit for about fifteen months). The telegrams at P.Z.2040/37 and 2118/37 below deal with his leave arrangements. Mr. Rendel, head of the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office, has recently been on a tour of the Middifi East, which included visits to Koweit and Bushire. As a result of these visits, the Foreign Office are anxious to raise certain points for discussion with the India Office, and among them are questions affecting Koweit (including various intricate outstanding problems) It is understood that the Foreign Office wish to discuss these points at an early date, and it would clearly be of very great advantage to have the Political Agent present at them. On the other hand, it is obviously impossible to expert de Gaury to spend a portion of so very short a period of leave in official discussions here; and, moreover, these discussions, owing to the Coronation and Whitsun, can hardly take place until about the time when he would normally be leaving this country. In these circumstances it seems most desirable that Captain de Gaury should be put on deputation for say a fortnight, and that his return to Koweit should be delayed by this period. A draft telegram to the Government of India, repeated to the Political Resident, putting the proposal to them is accordingly submitted. ' ' - ^ j-L..

It is not clear to what extent the sanction conveyed in the second paragraph of that letter may be applied to the claim. Ordinarily, an officer entitled to a 1st class passage to India on appointment to a civil post is not entitled to any refund of baggage charges incurred by him, and his steamer ticket entitles him to the transport by sea of 40 cubic feet (1 ton measurement) of baggage. Captain de Gaury*s baggage as shipped to Basra comprised 39 cases, 6 packages, 2 crates and 1 trunk of a total tonnage of 227 cubic feet (5 tons - 27 cubic feet £29. 0. 11. A. measurement), and the actual charge for freight is £29.-s.lid. Will the Under oecretary therefore be so good as to say whether it is intended tha&amp; the cost of freight on this unusual amount of baggage is to be met from Indian Revenues. Charges for Customs Entry and Bills of Lading (£ 0.12s»6d.), Dock Dues and Port Rates (£2.11s.6d.) and A ;ency Commission( £1.15s. 6d.) are incidental to the shipment of unaccompanied baggage and are admissible. Charges for postages(£0.5s.Od), packing and marking ( £1.19.9d.), cartage( £2.7s.0d) and Insurance( £7.12s.6d.) of baggage are ordinarily not aumissible.

My dear Caroe» In ease it should he of any assistance when the next stage of de Gaury’s case comes up for consideration, I venture to add a word about his general standing ana qualification! in the hope that I am not merely duplicat ing something already received from home. Ky excuse for saying anything about him is that I was closely connected with the diecussione which led to his appointment, and that I feel a certain personal responsibility Iftsfck' accepting the Kowelt post and^Thie future prospects in the Gulf* 2. He is a very good Arabic scholar, and has in addi tion the advantage of some years as Special Service Oincer in Iraq (during one stage of which he was indeed for a short time employed in Kowelt), and of much experience of intelligence work in the Middle Hast, while he was, ae you know specially seconded to the Jeddah Legation to write up the Military Report on Arabia, and he not only made a journey across the desert from Jeddah to Koweit, but was selected to act as interpreter to the Minister at Jeddah during the recent conversations with Ibn 3aud at Riyadh. The Air Force thought very highly of his capabilities, and he had a good Amy record and good prospects there had he decided to continue soldiering, -hat this comes- 2 - to 1- that. 30 far as can ho Judged. Wh °’ so far as record and experience go, ie'Unusually well qualified to fill a place in an area in which experts are Tew and hard tio come 3. The question of his pay has I gather now been settled. I am not very clear how matters stand as regards pension, or any guarantee of prospects. I would however, if I am not going beyond what is proper, venture to suggest that in any decisions either now or at the end of his probation (if he proves a success and is fortunate enough to be confirmed) we should bear in mind first that we have got (so far as can be judged) a man exceptionally well qualified, and that we have got him without much preliminary trouble because of his interest in Arabia and the Kiddle East, secondly that he on his side has taken considerable risks and that he should not suffer because he has not bargained over terms. He has sacrificed a sure career and a definite pension, and it is I think reasonable that in fixing his emoluments and conditions oi service on the conclusion of his probationary period, we should, if two years* experience of his work in Koweit Justifies the expectations one might at this stage reasonably entertain on his record, treat him with some generosity. I appreciate that the fact that he will technically be a contract officer, and that the rules to govern contract officersJ*- ^ '••'■liu. -3- contemplate eomewhat different caeee, may te a difficulty which will require consideration. 4 . as for prospect*, I am not sure what if any resly has been given to de Gaury. We clearly can't commit our selves very far at this stage. And he is of course a special case, since he will resign from his regular service on confirmation at Koweit, and so will have nothing to f II hack on. U 7 own feeling for what it is worth is that we could reasonably give him to understand that if confirmed, and if his work remains satisfactory, he has no reason to fear that he will not he retained till the normal Gulf retiring age. Without eome such assurance he is exchanging the substance for something much less substantial, and nere too I feel that it would be unfair to take advantage beyond at any rate a certain point - of the fact taat ae Gaury is himself attracted by the idea of Koweit and ie ready to make certain sacrifices or take oertain risks to enter our service, 5 . I hope you will forgive me for intruding at all on this case. I have done so only for the reasons I have given above, and because, unless the India Office has since filled in the gaps, we gave you I fear so little back, r - na to start with that there might be room for misunderstandingmi rft ffifrm. * -4- as to da Gaury* a record and reasons ua. 0,K.Garoe» Ksq., CIK 9 Deputy Secretary to the Gort.of India# Foreign &amp; Political Dept* New Delhi* for wanting to come to J.G.Laithwaite*— Register No. P. 7.

Please see previous submission on P.Z.312/36 about the appointment of Captain de Gaury as Political Agent, Koweit. captain de Gaury will be in the same position as Colonel Dickson, namely, a non-Political Department officer temporarily holding an appointment on the strength of the political Department cadre. The difference is, however, that while Colonel Dickson is an Indian Army Officer, Captain de Gaury is a British Service Officer, and, if he is confirmed in the post of Political Agent, he will have to retire from the active list of the British Army. It has therefore been necessary to consider the terms on which he should serve as a special case, and as a result of demi-official correspondence with the Government of India it is now possible to submit these terms for sanction. The appointment will be for two years in the first instance with a probationary period of six months. The Government of India say that while it is not possible to enter into commitments regarding the future they see no reason why, other things being equal, Captain de Gaury* s service should not be extended if the appointment proves satisfactory. This is all right so far as it goes: one cannot perhaps expect the Government of India at this stage to commit themselves definitely until they have had experience of Captain de Gaury*s work. It seems important, however, to bear in mind that we are fortunate in securing the services of an off icer with such special Arabic qualifications and experience as Captain de Gaury, and that in order to satisfy his ambition for further service in Arabia he is facing the necessity of giving up his career in the British Army, while, therefore, it is impossible to 3939 5000 7/35 /’''S give/2 give the officer himself any definite assurances at this stage, we should hear in mind the desirability, if he settles down in Koweit, of keeping him permanently in the Gulf, not necessarily at Koweit. He might even conceivably be suitable at some stage for a temporary incumbent of the post of Political Resident. However, all this depends on how he gets on in the Gulf. The terms that have now been forwarded by the Government of India appear to be satisfactory. The general idea is to approve at this stage such terms as are necessary for a two-year appointment and to leave other matters for consideration in due course if the appointment is extended. The pay proposed by the Government ol India is based ia t-ho — instance on a five-year scale totalling in the first year (including Koweit allowances) Rs. 1300 per mensem plus £25 Overseas pay and rising in the fifth year to Rs.lfftO per mensem plus £30 Overseas pay. SlMFeto c 0 «® 53 *£?»a#iy less than Colonel Dickson is receiving as Political Agent, Koweit, at the present time, viz. a total of Rs.1800 per mensem. It has also to be borne in mind that, as stated above, Captain de Gaury is leaving a permanent career in the Army and has no pensionary or other rights in respect of his Gulf service. It is also understood that he has had to spend hundred pounds (apparently £600 including a car, etc. ) in fitting himself out at the a*bftuuJL v\ vmo dLw***u Agency. It accordingly cannot be said that he is being over generously treated in respect of pay. His passage has already been dealt with under a separate submission. As regards leave, it is proposed that he should be subject to the model leave terms for officers engaged on contract, a copy of which is attached. It appears that ght / f months* leave a yea him under the speical leave rules will be &lt;r&gt;u. . wuirnKw** he will have months* leave a year. The question of considered/ A ^—-Minute Paper.

As stated above, there is no provision for pension or Provident Fund in view of the fact that the appointment is at present for two years only. This is a matter which perhaps should be taken up at leisure^ /'oVW Ufa ah . It was arranged with the Government of India and with the »yar Office that Captain de Gaury should be transferred to the service of the Government of India with effect from 15th January, when his service with the Air Ministry ended. Since that date he has been engaged in fitting himself out for Koweit, in discussions with the interested Departments of H.M.G. and in reading papers at the India Office. He leaves for India on the 28th January and takes over from Colonel Dickson on February 4th.

Department. 3939 5000 7/35 The post of Political Agent, Koweit, will be vacated by Lieutenant-Colonel Dickson on February 4th, 1936, when he reaches retiring age. It has been arranged with the Government of India that this post, which has been specially staffed from outside the Political Department for some years, should be filled temporarily by the appointment of Captain G.S. de Gaury, M.C., a British Service officer with very special Arabic experience and qualifications. The precise terms on which Captain de Gaury should be appointed are still under demi-official discussion with the Government of India, whose final views have not yet been received. On receipt of them the matter will be formally submitted. In the meantime, one or two questions require immediate consideration. (1) Passage to Koweit . Captain de Gaury is at present in London having just completed a term of service under the Air Ministry. It is proposed that he should be transferred to the service of the Government of India with effect from the 15th January, the date on which the Air Ministry dispensed with his services, and it is necessary for him to take over from Colonel Dickson on February 4th. In the meantime desired &lt;j) Xhnt he Bgead a little time in this Office familiarising himself with the papers and discussing Koweit matters generally with the Departments concerned. It is accordingly necessary to send him by Air to Koweit and special sanction is roq^ooted to the provision of an entitled Air passage. Provisional arrangements have been made by the High Commissioner tdr s an official letter authorising them to book the passage as required.1 (£). Baggage . Owing to the small amount of baggage which an officer can take by Air, it has been necessary for captain de Gaury to send by sea a good deal of baggage, both personal belongings and equipment for his house. He has submitted his Agent*s bill in this connection (P.Z.312/36). Ordinarily speaking, the Steamship baggage allowance would no doubt cover all the t officer»s requirements, and as it.is necessary for official reasons to send him by Air, it seems only fair that his baggage should be sent at Government expense. It is accordingly proposed to request the High Commissioner to settle the bill either with captain de Gaury or with his Agent.

Final arrangements can therefore be made. As regards dates, we understand that de Gahry will be actually at work for the Air Ministry (i.e. writing up the Jedda military report) till about the 15th January, when his services will be placed at our disposal. We think it would be a good thing for him to have a little time on duty in London after that, in order that he may have an opportunity of discussing with us and the other departments concerned the various outstanding matters of importance connected with Koweit. As he will have to take over from Dickson on 4th February and as it will be desirable for him to have a few days in Koweit before doing so, it willclearly be necessary for him to proceed by air from London, and we accordingly propose he should be provided at Government expense with a passage by Imperial Airwaysi leaving London on 28th January, ***** in 1 own it im 1 st.-Fehnifiiry. His heavy luggage is being sent direct from Jedda. 3. We have been looking further into the proposed terms of appointment, and in particular the pay. Le Gaury has about twenty years service in the Army but is still a Captain. His total emoluments would therefore appear to work out at Bs. 1,110 per mensem on the basis of British service pay plus Koweit allowances This compares with Rs.1,800 which Dickson has been drawing and/J/^G© which dfe floX* lU 2-0 , &gt;A^\aAAA/VWW- In view of the special qualifications and experience which de Gaury has and of the increasing importance of the Agency, v/e do not feel that this is a fair wage as it stands, especially as it is only a limited tenure appointment and does not carry any pension.^ k^fhe relative slowness of promotion to Major in the British Service and the absence of Indian Allowance the 'Army Pay' to which de Gaury is entitled fg markedly inferior to that which an officer of similar service in the Indian Army would draw.

It would also have the advantage of continuing to be appropriate throughout de Gaury's tenure of the post, since as I explained in my telegram of the 4th November, No. 3550, the yar Office are unable to grant him any further secondment, so that at the expiry of the 6 months probation, he will, if he is confirmed in the post, have to retire from the Army, thus ceasing to have a scale of Army Pay. \5\ We hope that you will reconsiderthe matter in the light of what I have said above, and let us have the Government of India’s views.

Ijy^ \ /' * V 3938 5000 7.35 3 DEC1955 My dear Rendel, As you know, the G. of I. have agreed with the suggestion that they should appoint Capt. de Gaury to succeed Dickson as Political Agent, Koweit, on February 4th, 1936, and de Gaury has accepted. The question of Dickson's extension in the post had been under consideration, but it is now proposed that he should be appointed C.L.R. of the Koweit Oil Coy. He is still in correspondence with the Coy. about the conditions of that appointment. We do not expect that any hitch will occur, and though for the moment we do not f-eel able to take final steps for de Gaury's appointment as Political Agent, we hope to make progress with certain preliminary details which have to be settled. De Gaury's appointment would start with a probationary period of six months, and during this time we understand the W.O. would be prepared to put him on the unemployed list, so that in the improbable event of his failing to settle down m Koweit he would not be debarred from returning to the Army. There is, however, a slight difficulty H ‘ * about dates. J*fi_Jaaar-y- L s- employment under the Air Ministry ceases on January 15th, and the W.G. say they could not have a gap between the conclusion of this employment and/and the beginning of farther employment ander the G. -of • The G. of I. would have no objection to emnloying'dc Gaury N on special daty ,, from January 15th to February 4th in Koweit, and, as they point out, this will give him some time to familiarise himself with current local affairs. Indeed, it seems desirable m itself that there should _ be a short overlap of this kind, as ^r Avft. Gaory-will be coming fresh to the Service. I should be glad if you would kindly let me know whether the F.O. agree to the proposed arrangement, as the small cost involved would presumably be divided in the ordinary way between Imperial and Indian revenues. 7/e are not saying too much about the appointment of de Gaury at the moment, on account of the position in regard to Dickson’s appointment under the Koweit Oil Coy. as Chief Local Representative referred to above.

He said that the W.C. had had an official letter fhorn the Air Ministry, saying that they propose to dispense vd.th de Gaury 1 s services from about January 15th. Colonel Ismay explained that it would certainly not be possible, for various reasons (including the Treasury) to seco nd de Gaury from the Army service any longer, but that they would be able to put him on the Half Pay List (which means that he vrould not get any pay) for 6 months, so that the door would not be absolutely shut against his return to Army life if he should by any chance prove to be unsuitable for the Gulf. He explained, however, that if this was to be done it was really essential that there should be no gap between de Gaury*s employment under the A.M. and under the G.of I. I said that I thought we should feel no difficulty about sending a telegram to Mr. Metcalfe on the subject. Colonel Ismay said that if we felt any real difficulty about taking de Gaury over from the 15 th January, he might be able to persuade the A.M. to agree to a later date, thoughin view of the fact that they had already written an official letter to the W.O. that might be rather difficult, 2.

My dear Glauson, Thank you for your letter P.Z.6692/35 of 23rd September, 1935. I write to confirm my telegram in reply. I am desirous of accepting the offer of the Political Agency, Kuwait, on the terms offered, or in view of the doubt about the standing for me that will eventually be arranged, on any terms you decide are suitable. I have written to the Air Ministry (Wing Commander C.E.H. Medhurst, O.B.E., M.C.) asking for release from their service in order to be in Kuwait by 1st Pebruary, and asking them to forward to the War Office a formal application, which I enclosed, for further secondment from April 1st to the end of July, to cover the probationary period of six months. I also wrote privately to Colonel H.L. Ismay of the War Office to ask him to be kind enough to help the application when it reaches the War Office. I doubt, however, the Army Council accepting it, and I think it very likely that I may have to resign as from 1st February, 1936, in order to take up the appointment. I note that in your letter you contemplate this as a possibility, and am in no way deterred. At the moment, therefore, I wait a reply from the Air Ministry and the War Office, whose reactions will be known to Wing Commander Medhurst. Until they are known it appears unnecessary to resign from Army Service. I am most anxious to have the matter settled before leaving for Saoudi-Arabia (with Sir Andrew .Ryan, whose programme is to arrive Egypt November 8th; Baghdad (c/o Embassy) November 9th. Leave Baghdad 13th for Kuwait (Agency) until 16th; to Bahrein (Agency) which he leaves on November 22nd.). This address, unless I let you know otherwise, will find me until November 8th. I am quite prepared to fly to England and back in the interval in order to have this rather complipated matter settled as early as possible. ° y If you see any purpose to be served by such a visit, please send me a wire.

My dear Rendel, You may rememher that de G-aury is due to meet Sir Andrew Ryan in Egypt or Iraq early next month, and in the meantime he tells me that he is busy collecting information for the Military Report which he is compiling. He tells me that he has had an invitation from Lenahan, the local Manager of the Standard Oil Company, to stay at Jiibail, He would naturally like to accept this invitation since it may enable him to obtain useful information recently acquired by the Company during their extensive land and air reconnaissances. invitation? I do not of course want to suggest anything that might adversely affect Ryan’s visit to Riyadh but as the invitation is entirely a personal and private one I do not myself see any reason why he should not accept it on these grounds. Perhaps you would have an opportunity of sounding Ryan on the subject during the next few days, and if so I hope that he will fall in with the suggestion. I may add that Lenahan would send a launch to Bahrain for de Gaury and would return him there. Do you see any objection to his accepting the Yours sincerely, (Signed) C.L. Courtney G.W.

My dear Andrew, I have just heard from Courtney of the Air Ministry that de Gaury has received an invitation from Lenahan to stay at Jubail and that he would naturally like to accept it. I gather that the visit would be paid before you reach Bagdad where de Gaury would be back in good time to meet you. As the invitation is a personal and private one the Air Ministry are disposed to let de Gaury accept it but are anxious not to suggest anything which might adversely affect your visit to Riyadh. Personally I am inclined to fear that even if Lenahan is entitled to issue such an invitation the fact that de Gaury had accepted it might make the Saudis rather suspicious of him when he afterwards visits Riyadh with you. It may be, however, that, if de Gaury can satisfy himself that the Saudis have actually sanctioned the issue of this invitation, there is no harm in letting him accept it. I should be very grateful to have your viev/s as soon as possible. If you see no objection to the idea, perhaps you would telegraph. Yours ever, (Signed) George Rendel.

On the whole I should be inclined to let de Gaury go to Jubail and I do not think that such a visit would of itself react unfavourably on the subsequent position at Riyadh, when de Gaury will be in a subordinate capacity, always provided that, as you suggest, the visit to Jubail can be made with the clear approval of the Saudis and in such a manner as not to give umbrage to them. We have, however, to consider the following points:— (a) Lenahan is not a very discreet person and is sometimes tactless in his relations with the Saudi authorities. This imposes a good deal of caution, especially as Muhammed Tawil, also seems to have preserved his position, has been on bad terms with the Standard Oil people. (b) The Saudis may see a direct connexion between a visit to Jubail at this juncture and the question of landing grounds. De Gaury would have to avoid all appearance of prospecting for sites and his stay should be quite short, not more than two or three days at most. (c) It is all the more important that de Gaury should not compromise himself in the eyes of the Saudis in view of the prospect of his being made Political Agent at Kuwait next year. I do not know how far the India Office have consulted theJL m. S the Air l^inistry about this hut I understand that the project is far advanced and it would he a pity if a new Political Agent started with the reputation of being a thruster into Saudi concerns. hut should ask the Air Ministry to bring the adverse considerations to the notice of de Q-aury and others concerned in the Gulf and authorize the visit only on condition that he and they are satisfied that the visit can he made without awkward repercussions in any of the directions indicated. P.S. I do not feel that I can usefully telegraph hut you should have this early tomorrow. (Intld.) A.R.

I warned him in using so tnat we could express no opinion of any kina as to the probable outcome of the reference which is being made to India and that if tne Government of India for any reason wished to put in one of their own men or to make any other arrangement, it was practically certain that tne secretary of state would not wish to oppose them; and that in these circumstances he should entertain no false hopes.

Mr. Walton, I happened to see sir Andrew ftyan to-day and, he having mentioned that he was proposing to take Captain de Gaury with him as secretary and interpreter on his forthcoming visit to Riyadh, I told him confidentially, asking him to treat it as private and not to mention it to the Foreign Office, that we had had under consideration the possibility of employing Captain de Gaury as Political Agent, Koweit in succession to Colonel Dickson if the Government of Inuia saw no objection and the other difficulties concerned coula be surmounted. I added that we had as yet no idea of what attitude the Government of India would take and so we had not sounded Captain de Gaury; but that we had discussed the matter informally with Mr. Metcalfe and Colonel Fowle, wno seemed disposed to accept in principle, if the difficulties could be overcome. I said that I would be much interested to know what sir Andrew Ryan’s views were on Captain de Gaury, as he was at present serving under him. Captain de Gaury he would be strongly in favour of employing him as P.A. Koweit. 30 far as his knowledge of Arabic was concerned, Sir Andrew Ryan hardly felt in a position to express rximifol* opinion, but the opinion which he himself entertained of his capacity was shown by the fact that he was taking him to Riyadh as interpreter. Sir .unarew Ryan said ne had formed a nigh opinion of Captain de Gaury in the time he naa been with him ana that 2 Sir Andrew Ryan said that from what he had seen oi 3. So far as his otner qualities were concerned, he had given a good report o£ him in consequence to sir E. Ellington. He thought he had very good qualities i'or dealing/dealing with Arabs; he was tactful, handled them well, and appeared to have an understanding of them, sir A. Ryan understood that he had made friendly contact with Colonel Dickson, and from the Sheikh of Koweit's reaction to a remark which he had maue to him about Captain de Gaury during H.S.'s recent visit to London he gathered that no difficulty need be anticipated with tne sheikh, whom he seemed to have impressed favourably. / 4. Sir A. Ryan said tnat he wished to add that so far as Captain de Gaury himself was concerned he thought he would welcome employment of this type. As matters stood (he was, of course, a regular soldier) he was due to revert to the Army next torch. He was particularly interested in Arabia and in Arab questions and he was so reluctant to be severed from this type of work that he had in fact discussed with sir A. Ryan whether it would not be possible that he should be retained as Oriental secretary at Jeddah, sir A. Ryan for other reasons (I gather that the Foreign Office wish to keep the Jeddah post at this stage more or less themselves) saw difficulties about this; but I gathered (perhaps incorrectly) that he had had the impression that Captain ue Gaury, in the interests of securing further Arab employment of a suitable type, might be prepared to sacrifice his Anty career. 5. The general impression left by sir a. Ryan was that his opinion of Captain ue Gaury was definitely high and that he thought that he would be admirably suited for a political post such as that of P.a. Koweit. But he undertook to regard tne communication made to him as entirely personal and confidential, and it might be desirable/V jSfci 23, - 3 - aesiralDle, therefore, if you wish to make any use of trie record of his remarks above, not to ao so officially. ^Xii%Aif-c w ^ar' /£.

Since postings are now being arranged, please telegraph date on which Fowls proposes that Dickson should he relieved and whom he proposes sis successor5/ Colonel Dickson*s appointment as. Chief Local Heoresentative . You will have seen that Colonel Fowle is to come to lunch on Friday next. I am not sure whether you will, in fact, be here or not? 2. If you are not, I will explain to him that we have discussed this question with Mr. Metcalfe and that it has also been raised direct with the A.P.Q.C. by the Shaikh; that for the reasons already given the Secretary of State is now definitely of opinion (and Mr. Metcalfe agrees) that despite the arguments against, the force of which we fully recognise, we should agree to Colonel Dickson’s appointment as Chief Local Representative; that the Government of India are pressing for an early decision on this point; and that I have been asked to discuss it with him with a view to telegraphing to them. 3. If Colonel Fowle takes very strong exception, it may no doubt be necessary to discuss the matter further with him, though personally I think that we should hold to our view. If, on the other hand, however reluctantly, he gives way, I suggest that we might telegraph to Mr. Acheson in the terms of the telegram attached. 4. As regards Captain de Gaury, I have, of course, no idea whether he would be prepared to accept the appointment of P.A. Koweit, though from what I know of his keen interest in Arabia I have little, if any, doubt on the question. At an earlier stage he was quite prepared to sacrifice his Regular Army career here if any suitable post could be found for him in Arabia. He is an Arabic speaker of unusual fluency and has a distinguished record as an intelligence officer.2 5. Mr. Cl^uson might perhaps write to Mr. Acheson on the lines of the draft attached if the draft telegram issues? Mr. Walton, Mr- Clauson and I discussed this question with Colonel Fowle to-day. He agreed not to press his objection to Col. Dickson’s appointment as C.L.R. and to our approaching G/I regarding Capt. de Gaury on the lines of the draft. (Sd.) J.G. LAITHWaITE 31.7.35. (Intd.)

The 3/S regards the Koweit post as one of very great importance, our more serious political difficult^ s in thejCulf are with Ibn Saud and the Iraqis*; the sheikh's capacity is well above that of the level of the other Arab rulers and it is in our view quite essential, more particularly if Dickson, with his great local knowledge and his influence with the sheikh, is to remain in Koweit, that the p.A. should be a fluent Arabic speaker and well conversant witn the political problems involved. 3. as you know, the Koweit post has, ever since the end of the War, been staffed on a special.basis - not for any reasons of principle, but because the G. of 1. have found it more convenient to deal with it in this way. For practical purposes it has been he la since shortly after the War by two officers/2. officers - Colonel Mo^re and Cdonel Dickson - neither of whom belongs to the Political Department, hut both of whom have^very special Arabic qualifications. 4. A suggestion which we have discussed with Metcalfe and which, with his concurrence, ‘ we would now like to put to the G.of I., is that this practice should be continued and that Captain Gerald rde Gaury, fdi the Essex Regiment, who has for some years 1 past been employed on special intelligence work in Iraq should be taken into the political Dept, on the same basis as Mo/re and Dickson in the past. De Gaury, who is aged about 40, has an unusual record of service in the kiddle East; he is a really fluent t COu i ^VTiLj &lt;KSTj^ / I Arabic speaker; [has much experience of secret intelligence work in Iraq under the Air Ministry; is at the moment attached to the Minister at Jedda for the purpose of writing the military report of Arabia; and in the last few days has done a oofryoV tour from Jedda via Riyadh to Koweit across the aesert, with the informal assistance of the Saudi authorities. He has, we understand, a definite capacity for getting on with Arabs and he is at the same time a competent and reliable O, 7 ,Vvv ~ ; VFk. v * - — - — officer.^We feel here that it is of such/ V ( a. 6s u- ^ ^ ^Draft Paper. 14^ u+A/^ *•'£' J-irs*A&lt;ir *r (fr*,H&lt;&gt;OA A f *~^L « y ^¥VVv ^ A ^ C&lt;AAjL^A &lt;vj - £~' T^f* V*v 2^ ^ o-t-&lt;- *V~ c*.—/- %aa^J^ ^ ^ - 3761 5000 5.35 Department. such importance to the Department to have a first rate Arab scholar in the Gulf, particularly a man with political experience of this type, that if the difficulties involved could de overcome it woulu de very well worth our while to take him in,* and I am asked to suggest this for the consideration of the G.of I. ana to say that Metcalfe, with whom the matter has deen discussed, has authorised tne to say that he will himself, in the light of our discussions with him, de in favour of it if the technical difficulties can de overcome. 5.

Dickson, as Political ^gent, Koweit up to the 4th February 1936, when he is due to retire unaer the age limit. The Resident has consistently very strongly urged upon us the desirability of retaining Colonel Dickson up to the end of his time and his experience and local knowledge, which have been of the greatest value, would be very difficult to replace. The question was discussed informally with Colonel Fowle and Lr. Metcalfe last sunnier, when Mr. Metcalfe promised to do what he could to secure that the necessary extension was given. 2. It is very satisfactory that the Government of India should now be prepared to make a positive proposal of the nature oesirea. 3. Colonel Dickson*s stock is high with the other Departments concerned and the Foreign Office reacted favourably to soundings recently taken of Ci' them as to the possibility of allowing him to act as Resident for a brief period in the summer of next year in the event of both Colonel Loch and Colonel Fowle being absent on leave. It is unnecessary to consult the other Departments before approving the present proposal, vifoen approval has been given to it I will let tne Foreign Office know, as in the draft attached. f.

The appointment is not, I think, iaeal, for, though Major ’Watts is a competent ana reliable officer, he has no Arabic qualifications (though Mr. Metcalfe warned him of the importance of brushing up his knowledge of the language) and has only a field an officiating one of four months, and as Mr. Metcalfe confidently recommends Major Watts, we need not any comment. The Foreign office, however, on receiving my letter of .the 30th June, rang up to say that they were disturbed at his apparent ignorance of Arabic ana that they thought it particularly important that a post such as Koweit should be filled by someone with a fluent knowledge of that language, in view of the importance iirst of all oi keeping the Sheikh, who, as you know, has service test in Persian. However, the vacancy is only teen/- 2 - been rather restive lately, under the influence of the P.A.’s personality, and secondly of keeping pace with Iviajor Holmes (who knows no Arabic but knows Koweit very well).

Colonel Dickson’s name has figurea very prominently in the corresponaence about Ibn 3aud md Koweit curing the last three or four years. He has still three years to go before reaching the age limit He is an Arabic scholar of much distinction; is on admirable terns with and trusted by the Sheikh of Koweit, and has a very unusual record of service in Mesopotamia and Arabia. It will be most aifficult to find any satisfactory replacement for him at this stage, ana not only the Imperial Departments concernea with this area, but the Anglo-Persian Oil Company,are strongly in favour of his retention. 2. The Government of India uo not wish, however, to commit themselves Tor more than one year ahead. We may perhaps agree to this, giving the Government of Inula at the same time a leua in the airection of further extension. The case, however, raises a general question of rather more importance, viz. whether, having regard to the close and increasing interest of the Foreign Office and Air Ministry in this area, the Secretary of .State should not have an opportunity of commenting on any appointment of political Agent in Koweit and Bahrein, if not at Muscat. At the moment the Government of India are under no obligation to consult us in . respect of any of these postings, save where, as in the case of Colonel Dickson, some arises necessitating the Secretary special circumstanc of State's sanction, and/ 1212 5C00 9.322. n and the sanie holds good in the case of the Resident, though here, as a matter of courtesy, we have in the past been consulted. 1 suggest that we might well now take the opportunity to reach an understanding on the point with the Government of India.

As regards Dickson it is, in the Secretary of State's opinion, of the greatest importance that a post such as Kcweit, in close touch with Iraq and Arabian politics generally, should continue to he filled hy an officer with special qualifications such as Dickson onjoyig, and he trusts therefore* that no difficulty will arise (unless some quite special circumstance should make a change desirable) in retaining Dickson in this post up to the date when he is due for compulsory retirement. The Imperial Departments concerned, who were informally sounded in the matter before the Secretary of State's telegram issued, are strongly in favour/favour of his retention and are well satisfiea with his recent conduct of the affairs with which he has been associated, ana we also an understand ( possibly not/unimportant consideration if the A.P.O.C. succeed in obtaining the Koweit oil concession) that he is persona grata to the A.P.Q.C. 3, The second question is one more general in character.

Sir, * I am directed to inform you that owing to the shortage of officers in the Political Department, Lieutenant Colonel H.K.P. Dickson, C.I.E., an officer of the Indian Army on ’General duty* was appointed to officiate in the Political Department for a period of two years with effect from the 8th May 1928 on his Army pay plus allowances attached to the post to which he might he appointed from time to time. As His Majesty’s Government are aware, Colonel Dickson served with distinction under the Mesopotamian Political Department during the War, and also officiated as Political Agent, Bahrein^ for over 2 years in 1919-21. He knows the Arabs and Arabic well and was accordingly well fitted for employment in the Persian Gulf. During his present officiating tenure, he was first appointed as Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident » in the Persian Gulf and after that he became Political Agent^ Koweit^on Lieutenant Colonel More’s departure on leave, which post he still holds. The present term of Colonel Dickson’s appointment expires on the 7th May 1930 but the Government of India are anxious to retain his services for at least another 3 years. The shortage of officers which necessitated his temporary employment in the Department has been accentuated by an unusual number of casualties during the present year, and isis unlikely to be remedied until the reorganisation scheme now under consideration in the India Office is in full A working order. work done by Colonel Dickson in Kow r eit, the Government of India recommend that his term of appointment may be extended for a further period of 3 years on the existing terms, with effect from the 8th May 1930.

Proposed grant of an extension of the appointment of Major J*C.More, D.S.O., as Political Agent at Kuwait* Sir, I am directed to refer to the telegram from His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, Ho.1724, dated the 23rd June 1925, conveying sanction to the retention of Major&lt; More as Political Agent, Kuwait, for a further period of 1 year with effect from the 25th May 1925. 2. The Government of India still find it difficult to replace Major More at Kuwait and would he reluctant to dispense with his services there. But in view of the possibility of the Kuwait post being taken over by His Majesty’s Government, they were inclined to favour a further extension for one year only by which time, it is understood, a decision on the future status of Kuwait might be expected. The military authorities have however represented that, in view of Major More’s seniority, the time has come when the question of his return to military duty cannot be further shelved and that he must therefore either revert at once to military duty and qualify for regimental advancement or, if desirous to remain in Political employ, clear the way for subs tantive advancement of more junior officers by agreeing to be posted to general duty with effect from the 25th May 1926, a course which would involve forfeiture of all claim to further military employment and necessitate his immediate retirement on ceasing to be employed under the Political Department. 3. In view of the reasons for which it is desired to retaini. % T. —'•u* Major More’s services at Kuwait* and in consideration of his good services to the Political Department during the past 6 years, it is considered essential that he should he safeguarded against financial loss as the result of further retention in civil employ. It has already been explained in the letter from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, No* 37-B, dated the 26th June 1924, that it is not possible to admit him permanently into the Political Department. In the circums tances, the Government of India recommend that Major More be retained for a further period of 3 years and about 8 months i.e., up to 18th January 1930, (on which date he will complete his title to a pension of £710) during which he may be allowed to take 6 months leave and, if necessary, further leave of about 8 months pending retirement. Major More is prepared to accept these terms and to forego all claims to further military employ ment. It has been explained to him that the arrangement proposed must be subject to the Kuwait appointment still remaining under the Government of India but that if direct responsibility for Kuwait affairs is transferred to His Majesty’s Government on any date before May 1929 Iwhen Major More will be in a position to take leave preparatory to retirement on a pension of £710) the Government of India would bring his case to the special notice of His Majesty’s Government with a recommendation that he be retained at Kuwait for such period as may be necessary to enable him to complete his title to pension. 4. I am to request that His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India may be moved to sanction the above proposals of the Govern ment of India and that, in view of the fact that Major More’s employment subsequent to 24th May 1926 still remains to be regularized, the orders may kindly be communicated by telegram.

It was hoped that this latter question would have been definitely settled by the 24th May 1924 up to which date Major x lore’s retention at Kuwait was sanctioned by the Secretary of x Vide India Office letter to the Govern- ) State. It, appears ment of India, No.P.4362, dated the 28th ( December 1922. } however, from the India Office letter to the Colonial Office, No.P.1441, dated the 4th April 1924, that the final allocation of responsibility in respect of Arabian affairs has not yet been made. The Government of India have recently had under consideration Major More’s position and prospects.

Secretary to the 'Jovernnent of India. X e . . • f e(333 \ . — With reference to my letter of 28th October P* 4604 I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he has been in consultation with the Government of India by telegraph and is prepared, pending decision of the question of the transfer of the political control of the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf and of Aden to the Colonial Office, to agree that the control of the political affairs of Koweit should remain in the hands of Sir P. Cox, while he is the High Commissioner for Mesopotamia, on the understanding:- 1. that a moiety only of the expenditure involved is borne by Indian Revenues, the remaining moiety to be recovered from the Imperial Exchequer as heretofore: 2* that no fresh expenditure is sanctioned by Sir P#Cox or by your Department except with the prior concurrence of the Government of India or the Secretary of State in Council, 3, that this special temporary arrangement is not to be cited hereafter against the contention that financial liability must be wholly borne by the authority in which control is vested. A.s regards the first of these provisos Mr. Secretary Churchill will no doubt arrange with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (to whose Department a copy of this letter is being sent) which Department shall in future contribute the Imperial moiety of expenditure in Koweit. Pending receipt of a decision on this point the claims on behalf of the Government of India (which as a rule are presented about a year in arrear) will continue to be made on the Foreign Office. INDIA OFFICE, P. 5363/21. WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 21st December, 1921. Sir, On The Under Secretary of State Colonial Office.- 2 - 33^ A On the understanding indicated above 3£r# Secretary Montagu agrees that the necessary steps should be taken by Sir Percy Cox to obtain the co-operation of the Sheikh of Koweit in suppressing the illicit traffic in arms by establishing a system of registration of rifles and ammunition in his territories. As regards the other specific recommendations of the Committee held at Karachi to consider the arms traffic question I am to enclose copies of Telegrams exchanged with the Government of India. Mr. Secretary Montagu agrees with the Government of India that the present limited extent of the traffic would not justify the reinforcement of the existing Naval forces by a motor boat patrol, and, further, that to grant the local authorities a standing permission to institute so expensive a measure as he apprehends this patrol would be, would not be justified till more clear evidence is forthcoming of an impending growth of the traffic to serious proportions. Similarly the Secretary of State agrees that even the comparatively modest expenditure involved in the installation and maintenance of a wireless station at Koweit is not justifiable at the present time, if the installation is required only for purposes of checking gun-running. Should the installation be required for other purposes, (e.g. in the event of Koweit Bay being developed as an oil-loading port) but remain available as an instrument for anti-arms-traffic operations, the Secretary of State would be prepared to reconsider his opinion, but he would also wish to consider further the proportion, if any, in which Indian Revenues could fairly be called upon to contribute to the expense.
