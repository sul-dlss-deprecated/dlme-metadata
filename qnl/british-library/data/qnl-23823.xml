Dated, R/ihenv 11, 1352 Aug. 2, 1533. I acknowledge your memor dated 19th July 1933 with enclosure regarding visitations of locusts in Bahrain. Fortunately the ocurrence of locusts in Bahrain is very rare indeed. I can only rectpl- lect having seen them three or four times during the last seven years and it is therefore impos sible for me to supply the particulars required by the government of India m the case of orevious visitations as I have no records on the subject. May I suggest that instead of my sending to you a 'nil' report every month you should assume that no locusts have been reported unless I inform you that they have been seen here. I have only observed winged locusts in Bahrain, of a pinkish colour and I believe they never lay eggs here. They have usually arrived with a south wind before the date season, somewhere about May or June. The local method of combating them is,as in most other places where I have met them, by making smoke fires and by beating tins which has the effect of driving them off the ground. I regret that I am arable to provide such little information 0 ' an'h Adviser to the Government.5 ' • S : (sS) Political Agency, Bahrain* Bated the 10 th Auguat 1 U 33 # /n TO The Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, Simla* Sir, I have the honour to report that the report of locuata occurrencee in Bahrain and rruoial Coaot fcr the month of duly la NIL # I ham the honour to be, air, Your moat obedient servant* Sd* E* GASTRELL.

If possible it is important to investigate the interior within about 100 miles south of the Trucial coast. I am not clear where the boundary of Saudi Arabia lies in .these regions. I am granted facilities to visit certain parts of Saudi Arabia.

The Gaudi authorities state that ’’Practical dil t iculties' make it impossible to allow him to visit the Dawasir, though they raise no objection to his crossing Arabia to Jedda after finishing his work in the Qatar- Hofuf region. They may think that the permission to cross Arabia is worthless if the Dawasir is not to be visited. 2. w ha t the practical dif t iculties” may be I cannot say. If they were difficulties of transport, escort,&amp;c.one would expect the r eply to be more precise, since the vague expression ii uses is bound to invite speculation. There rnay 0e a general objection to allov.ing Europeans to vender about in the interior, out in fact the v.ork of the mining engineers of the baudi Arabian Mining Syndicate Ltd., hae taken them a long way into the interior and even within a ^nort distance of Medina and Mecca. No local disturbance or discontent has been heard of that might explain the desire to keep a European away from the Uav.asir, and the supposition which connects the refusal of Mr. Darling's application with tne intention Ibn baud is believed to have, to keep a close watch upon the Yemen for fear that internal troubles there may affect Saudi Arabia, is perhaps farfetched.■•hen I next bee i’u*d Boy, who after spending a few dsys m Jedda has vanished into the interior for several weeks, I will ask whether the difficulties are likely to disappear and it may be that their nature will be revealed in the course of conversation* 3.

Perhaps you will be kind enough to give your views on what facilities we should offer Mr.Darling. Our experience with Saleh has been discouraging and we do not want to be placed in the position that Saleh feels he has authority to ask for any facilities he requires if he uses Mr.Darling’s name. Also although we do not wish to appear inhospitable we also do not wish to establish any precedent that the Company House, which has two bedrooms only, is available as a Rest House for the Sheikh’s casual European guests. On the other hand we are sure Mr. O.S. Dickson, our driller there, will be only too pleased to help Mr.Darling to any reasonable extent to overcome the deficiencies of Qatar. In this connection we usually send our Company boat over to Khowair once a week on Tuesdays connecting with our oars from Dohah. Vi/e would point out thst the Sheikh is still on tour and has somewhat limited transport which is usually at his camp in this season.We would add that should Colonel Fowle or you or your Assistant he visiting Dohah we should of course he only too pleased if you would use our house k organization generally such as it is. in the cool season k up to 1st May probably (a) Weekly launch service to Khowair connecting with cars from Dohah - usually Tuesdays but dependent upon weather conditions.

No.1897 dated 9tn September 1937, I beg to state that no record has been kept here about locusts but I have been making enquiries on the subject, during this period from various places and $he result of these enquiries is given below:- 1. Locusts frequent Oman mostly from the western side and they follow the eastern direction in their flight but they always fly in the direction of strong winds. They make their appearances in tne spring seasons. The people of the Trucial Coast do not rememberhaving seen any migration of locusts from the southern Iranian coasts. Locusts always fly westward Tne local people, in some years past, noticed swarms of locusts coming from the south eastern airection. They do not recollect the date but they estimate it to be 10 years back. 2. The locusts alight on the Trucial Coast areas when the weather is calm w^ere they lay tneir eggs. When the eggs, whicn are half an inch in size, are hatched, they take a dark green colour. Three of four days after they have been hatched, they grow till they reach the size of one inch when they begin to creep and then jump. At this stage, they become dangerous to the plantations. 3. The people of Oman ao not remember exactly the year during whicn swarms of locusts last appeared but they think it was 6 years back,i.e., during the spring of 1932. After Compliments.

J *) &gt; - Memorandum: - Reference your memorandum No. 928-18/37 dated 18th May, 1941. From the last week in March until about 25th April locusts made their appearance at the south end of Bahrain island. They are said to have come from Qattar on a south wind and were seen at Matala, Amr, Rumatha and near law. There were small numbers of brown flying locusts and some hoppers. They did not reach the date gardens and no damage has been reported by cultivators. Twice, at a fortnight’s interval, during this period I saw two or three small bands of hoppers on the Sakhir - Rumaitha road, feeding on wild vegetation, which is abundant this year. Some locusts were sent into bazaar for sale but the people who I met, catching them, at Matala complained, selfishly, that there were very few. I have never seen hoppers before in Bahrain. When locusts visited Bahrain in the past they came in formidable quantities and destroyed date crops and vegetation. r s.z. Adviser to the Government.V A. 1 3. 4. 5.

INDIA OFFICE, V/ith reference to correspondence regarding locusts resting with pour letter of 16th January, reference NO.F.18-5/41-A, I am directed to inform you that an organisation is being established for the co-ordination of anti-locust activities in the Middle East and East Africa, under the name of the Middle East Anti-Locust Unit. It will be attached to the Middle East Supply Centre in Cairo for administrative purposes and under the technical supervision of the Anti-locust Research Centre at the Imperial Institute of Entomology, London. The cost of the Uiit will be borne by H.I .G. The Unit will probably be headed by Mr. Maxwell Darling (who at present holds a post under the Sudan Government) as Chief Locust Officer and will also include two other locust officers and the nedessary assistants. Its principal functions may be described as follows;- (a) to secure first hand Knowledge of the locust problem in all the territories involved and to help in organising anti-locust measure' with a view to securing a greater degree of efficiency than exists at the present time; (b) to explore the possioility of extending locust control to the territories not at present contributing to the common effort, particularly those in Arabia; (c) to develop a joint plan for a large scale control of locusts in the whole region. In addition, an anti-locust mission, uder the / general supervision of the Chief Locust Officer, iddle East, is being sent to Ethippia. It is hoped that by these means the two most important gaps in existing knowledge and arrangements will ee remedied. I am to express the hope that the Government of India and the authorities in the Persian Gulf will be prepared to give the officers of the Unit such assistance as may be ossible should the need arise. Middle East anti-Locust Unit The Secretary to 'yli Dept, ? 1 am,Sir, etc.,D.O.No ,? BRITISH CONSULATE GENERAL BUSHIRE. 21st August 1942. Please refer to your memorandum No.1423 dated 11th August 1942 about Locust Reports. 2. The present does not seem to be a particularly favourable time to discontinue sending in reports, as we have information that a locust plague is expected over the Middle East in the next few years. A NIL report is certainly a tedious business and superficially a waste of paper t Do you not, however, think that if it were discontinued, there might be some relaxation of the vigilance, which a periodical report stimulates? If you are not con vinced, you may like to approach the Resident; but my own opinion is against the discontinuance that you propose. 3. With reference to your third paragraph; the Institute is the Imperial Institute of Entomology. I am sorry that this office at the time did not send your office a copy of the telegram dated 24th October from the India Office. I now enclose a copy for your records. To Captain M.G.

It is said that they have come from Iran. No signs of large numbers — appeared or/seen near that locality please.p. The locusts that alighted at Qozaibiyeh of yellow**dC colour, and they v/ill be of little effect on the trees, but the colour of t lose alighted at Gitra is grey with long wings and wide mouths. 7/hen they alight on anything they eat some of it, and if they settle on the trees or their fruit, they eat all up. I am sending you a specimen of the latter kind please. sH P.S. It is stated that big srawms have alighted at Sitra.Last evening a bi^‘swarm of unmatured and small sized locusts (grey colour) settled down at Manna, mostly at Qozaibiyeh, and little of them at Muharraq. They alighted on the trees, but still it is not known whether they will destroy the trees or not. It is also not known from which direction they came, but yesterday the wind was blowing from south-westerly direction. O t £1 HCopy of a report by Mohannecl Khafaja Assistant to the Anti-Locust in compliance with your order at' 11th August 1943, I, m th two oupervisors of the Anti-Locust unit, visited the above villages, i passed through all the palmstrefls and gardens, but 1 found little number of the locusts. 1. The locust is known as the desert locust, but she is still unmatured of red colour. 2. Cf this kind of locusts, two small swarms arrived on the^ evening of Tuesday and Wednesday, 10th and 11th August 1943 from the southren direction. They alighted on the trees of the above three villages, but no damage was done. 3. They did not remain but flew away to the northern and western directions in the morning of Thursday 12th August 1943. 4. On examining the remaining small number, 1 found them very weak to an extent that they have no power to fly, from which it ^appears that they did not meet grass in the place from shich they flew, nor in the area they passed through them. 5. /hen 1 enquired from the inhabitants about the state of the swarm on arrival, they told me that they were scattered and flying was low.

There is nothing on record, therefore, from which the required information can be gathered. Perhaps R.A. Sharjah will be able to supply us with the information. I suggest that a copy of the enclo sures be sent to him with a request that he should get us the required information.
