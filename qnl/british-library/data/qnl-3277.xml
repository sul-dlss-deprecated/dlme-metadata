My Lord, Tehran, February 15, 1876. THE question of nationality of persons of Persian origin born and brought up in India has been repeatedly a subject of discussion between the Persian Government and this Legation, on their presenting themselves in this country as British subjects. Recently the case of a Persian named Agha Mehdee, born in India of Persian parents, has been under discussion with me, and although his case has been settled, and his right to trade in this country on payment of the 5 per cent, rate of duty established by Treaty for British merchants is acknowledged, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed that this case is not to be received as a precedent, and that in all similar cases which may present themselves hereafter, he will maintain the right of the Persian Government to consider such persons, while within the Persian territory, to be Persian subjects, and treat them accordingly. The opinion of Her Majesty’s Government on this subject, viewing it simply as a question of international law, has been recorded in Lord Palmerston’s despath No. 82, of the 14th of September, 1850, addressed to Lieutenant-Colonel Shell, and in Lord Russell’s despatch No. 64, of the 25th of August, 1860, to Mr. Alison, and in them it is stated that persons of Persian origin, born within Her Majesty’s dominions, are entitled to all the privileges of British subjects everywhere, with the exception of Persia. It is, however, also stated that, having in view the different and peculiar habits and practices in Asia, it is expedient to extend to such persons, born of Persian parents within the British dominions, the protection of Her Majesty’s Government, even in this country. Under these circumstances, I would therefore beg to submit, for your Lordship s decision, whether the exceptional circumstances referred to by Lord Palmerston are still considered in sufficient force to render it advisable to maintain the position which it was then thought expedient to take up with regard to such persons while resident in the Shah’s dominions. _ . Although the Persian Minister has announced his intention or disputing any tuture claims which may be advanced by us in favour of persons of Persian origin bom within British territory, there does not appear to be any intention on the part of the Persian Government to make its action retrospective, or to interfere with persons of that class hitherto enjoying British protection. . . I have the honour to transmit to your Lordship copies of communications wnicn have passed on this subject between the Resident at Bushire and the Governor ot Bombay, in which the opinion of the Bombay Law Officers on the question ot the principle involved in this matter is recorded. I also inclose in translation copy ot a telegram addressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the local authorities at Bushire, instructing them to concede Agha Mehdee’s claim to British pi otection, but to refuse to recognize in future any similar pretensions advanced on the ground that the claimant had been born in India. , , In Lord Russell’s despatch above referred to, he instructs Mr Alison to be guided (474) B2 the practice observed in such cases by the Russian and French Legations. In order to ascertain the course adopted by the Russian Legation in these cases, I addressed to M. Schimanovsky, the Russian Charge d’Affaires, the note of which inclosure No. 16 is a copy, and received from him the reply (inclosure No. 17.) As his note did not appear to be sufficiently explicit, I directed Mr. Larcom to obtain from him a fuller explanation, and inclosure No. 18 is that gentleman’s report on the subject. A si mil ar application was made by me to M. de Balloy, the French Chargd d’Affaires (inclosure No. 19), and to this I received the reply (Inclosure No. 20). It is probable that other cases of this nature will before long present themselves, and as it is certain that the Persian Government will dispute our right to claim British nationality for Indian-born Persians, I beg respectfully to request that your Lordship will favour me with instructions for my guidance in the matter.

RESPECTING the Customs duty on the merchandise of Mehdee, who has, according to the inquiries made, for the last six or seven years paid 5 per cent, at Bushire by mistake, and now that they demand the usual duty from him his Excellency the British Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary requests that the 5 per cent, duty should only be taken from the said merchant. This Department, bearing in mind the exertions it takes to respect the statements made by his Excellency, will have no objection in carrying out this exceptional friendly request of his Excellency. But it is most respectfully stated that granting the said Mehdee may have been born in British India, in the opinion of this Department he is not entitled to the protection of the Legation either in justice or by Treaty. Even should the mother of a person be an Indian, whilst he is in Persia this Department does not consider him entitled to the protection of the British Legation. For no other law has ever been, observed in this Department, and it is not practicable for this Department to accept any other law than this. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Memorandum, No. 920, of 1868.

IN obedience to the Government telegram dated 17 th June, J 8 72&gt; 1 have the honour to submit that the reference, in my letter of 27th January last, to Act 12 of 2 . The Act to which I wished to refer was 33 A ictona, c. 14, An Act to amend the Law relating to the legal conditions of Aliens and British Subjects, 12th May, 1870. This Act will be found inserted as an Appendix, at page 546 of Sir Robert Phillimore s “ Commentaries upon International Law,” vol. i, 2nd edition, 1871. 3 . The paragraph in the Act to which I wished particularly to allude is paragraph 4, the commencement of which runs as follows: — . , . ^ tt “ Any person who, by reason of his having been born within the dominions ol Her Majesty, is a natural born subject, but who also at the time of his birth became, under the law of any foreign State, a subject of such State, and is still such subject, may, it of full a oe, and not under any disability, make a declaration of alienage in manner aforesaid; and from and after the making of such declaration of alienage, such person shall cease to be a British subject.” 4 . The opinion of the Honourable the Advocate-General appears to be identical with the wording of the above Act, and reads as follows*^ ^ . . “ That a person born of Persian parentage within British territory is a British subject, and entitled as such to British protection in Persia.” ... 5. Tbe reference made by me was by no means intended to call into question the soundness of the opinion of the Honourable the Advocate-General, but was intended to ascertain whether I was to be guided by this opinion. 6 . It will be in the recollection of Government that on one occasion, when I made a reference somewhat similar to that now made, the Right Honourable the Governor in Council ruled in reply that the opinion of the Advocate-General at Calcutta “ is entitled to much weight, although it has not the force of a judicial decision. 1 VlHVP (Signed) ’ LEWIS PELLY, Her Majesty's Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.5 liiclosure 11 in No. 1.

IN acknowledging the receipt of your letter dated 25th June last, I am directed by his Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council to forward a copy of the opinion of the Officiating Advocate-General, dated 21st ultimo, on the question whether a person born in British territory of Persian parents, and residing in Persia, is entitled to British protection. 2. His Excellency in Council concurs in the Advocate-General’s view that such a person is not entitled to British protection unless other foreign Powers enjoy in Persia the right of granting protection under similar circumstances. If, on inquiry, you find that such privileges are not enjoyed by foreign Powers, you should revert to the practice which you describe in the 4th paragraph of your letter under acknowledgment as having been observed prior to 1872, that is to say, your interposition should be restricted to affording your good offices as-in the case of ordinary Persian subjects. T hflvr* foe (Signed) ’ C. U. AITCHISON, Secretary to the Government of India. Inclosure 14 in No. 1. Mr. Paul to Mr. Aitchison. Fort William, August 21, 1874. WITH reference to your memorandum, dated 6th August instant, inclosing certain papers and a letter of 1874, dated 25th June last, from Her Britannic Majesty’s Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, I have the honour to advise as follows (474] C6 It may be stated as a general rule that a person of Persian origin born in British territory is a British subject, “ M. Stephen’s Blackstone s Commentaries, sixth edition, vol. ii., p. 433, the law is thus stated. As to natural born subjects.—And first, all persons born within the United Kingdom or in the Colontes fell within this description , and this extends even to those born of aliens residing in this country, provided their parents were not at the time in enmity with our Sovereign (see also Phillimore s International Law,” p. 345). But the above proposition does not of itself, in my opinion, carry with it the consequence that a British subject of Persian origin is entit e to British protection in Persia. The question whether a British subject of Persian origin is or not so entitled to protection in Persia will depend upon a variety of considerations which I will presently notice. _ , By the common law of England, a person born of English parents m a country not parcel of the British dominions was an alien. This rule was subject to some exceptions not necessary to be stated. The restriction of the common law was subsequently relaxed by several statutes, and the present law of England on the subject ot children horn of English parents may be generally stated as follows : That persons born abroad, whose fathers or grandfathers by the father’s side were natural born subjects are deemed to be natural born subjects (“2 Stephen’s Commentaries,” sixth edition, pp. 433 and 424). By the “Code Napoleon,” Book I., Chapter I., Aiticle 10, it is provided that every child of a Frenchman in a foreign country is French. Vattel, in his “Law of Nations,” Book I, Chapter XIX, writes as follows: I say that in order to be of a country it is necessary that a person be born of a father who is a citizen, for if he is born of a foreigner it will be only the place of his birth and not of the country. Further on, in the same chapter, the following observations occur It is asked whether the children born of citizens in a foreign country are citizens ? The laws have decided this question in several countries, and these regula tions must be followed. By the law of nature alone children follow the condition of their father, and enter into all their rights, the place of birth produces no change m this particular, and cannot ol itself furnish any reason for taking away trom a child what nature has given him; I say of itself, for civil or political laws, may for particular reasons ordain otherwise. But I suppose the father has not entirely quitted his country in order to settle elsewhere. If he has fixed his abode in a foreign country, he has become a member of another society, at least as a perpetual inhabitant, and his children will be members also. These authorities show that it is a matter of difficulty and nicety to determine whether in any given case a person of foreign origin born in a country other than that of his father, is to be considered a subject of the country of origin. It appears to me that in the present case, having regard to the Treaty with Persia hereafter to be noticed, it is absolutely necessary to determine whether by the laws of Persia, a person of Persian origin born in British India is or is not a Persian subject. Owing to my possessing no knowledge of the laws of Persia, nor having the means of obtaining such knowledge, I am wholly unable to solve the above question and to determine whether such a person as above described is a Persian subject. Article IX of the Treaty with Persia is as follows:—“ The High Contracting Parties engage that in the establishment and recognition of Consuls-General, Consuls, Vice- Consuls, and Consular Agents, each shall be placed in the dominions of the other on the footing of the most favoured nation, and that the treatment of their respective subjects and their trade shall also in every respect be placed on the footing of the treatment of the subjects and commerce of the most favoured nation.” Article XII of the same Treaty is as follows :—“ Saving the provisions in the latter part of the preceding Article the British Grovernment will renounce the right of pro tecting hereafter any Persian subject not actually in the employment of the British Mission, or of British Consul-General, Consuls, Vice-Consuls, or Consular Agents, provided that no such right is accorded or exercised by any other foreign Power ; but in this, as in all other respects, the British Government requires, and the Persian Govern ment engages that the same privileges and immunities shall in Persia bn conferred upon and shall be enjoyed by the British Government, its servants and its subjects, and that the same consideration shall be shown for them and shall be enjoyed by them as are con ferred upon and enjoyed by and shown to the most favoured foreign Government, its servants and subjects.” If a person of Persian origin born in British India is a Persian subject, I think that such a person would not, according to the proper construction of the provisions of the Treaty above quoted, be entitled to British protection; unless such right of protection under similar circumstances is exercised by any other foreign Power. t&lt;*1 7 B will be noied a n exception is made in respect of Persian subjects in the service of the British Government. It may, however, be contended that although such a person as above described may be a Persian subject, he is also a British subject, and that therefore he is entitled to the immunities and privileges conferred by the latter portion of Article 12. To this the correct answer would be that the British Government has renounced the right of protecting Persian subjects with certain exceptions, which do not cover the ordinary case of a Persian subject who may also be a British subject, and that the engagement of the Persian Government, to the effect that privileges and immunities shailbe enjoyed by British subjects, must of necessity only apply to cases of persons who are British subjects, and not Persian subjects. A different rule of construction would be opposed to the history of British or other European protection in the East. One of the leading principles of international law laid down in 1 Phillimore’s International Law, page 355, is as follows:— . The right of jurisdiction, civil and criminal, over all persons and things within the territorial limits, which is incident to a state relatively to its own subjects, and their own property, extends also, as a general rule, to foreigners commovant in the land.” As to the exceptions to the territorial right of jurisdiction, Sir ft. Phillimore in page 361 of the above volume, writes as follows:— The first class of exceptions to this rule is founded upon local usages and the reason of the thing, and relates principally to the status of Christians in infidel countries. So early as the sixth century a derogation from the rule of European International Law began to develop itself. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Code of the Visigoths, not the least remarkable monument of the middle ages, conceded to foreign merchants the privilege of being tried by judges selected from among their own countrymen. But after the Ottoman power became established in Europe, Christian nations trading with the territories subject to that Power, obtained from it, at different periods, a concession of exclusive authority over their own subjects, nearly identical with that which the Christian f Jus Commune ’ had conceded to foreign ships of war in their ports. The vital and ineradicable differences which must always separate the Christian from the Mahommedan or infidel, the immiscible character Avhich their religion impresses upon their social habits, moral sentiments, and political institutions, necessitated a departure from the strict rule of territorial jurisdiction, in the case of Christians who founded commercial establishments in Ottoman or infidel dominions.” The same subject is stated by Lord Stowell, in the case of the Indian chief, 3 Rob. Adm. Reports, pages 23 and 24, as follows:— “ But taking it that such a permanent sovereignty on the part of the Mogul princes really and solidly exists, and that Great Britain cannot be deemed to possess a sovereign right there ; still it is to be remembered that wherever even a mere factory is founded in the eastern parts of the world, European persons trading under the shelter and protec tion of those establishments are conceived to take their national character from that association under w r hieh they live and carry on their commerce.” It is a rule of the law of nations applying peculiarly to those countries, and is different from what prevails ordinarily in Europe and the western parts of the world, in which men take their national character from the general character of the country in which they are resident, and this distinction arises from the nature and habit of the countries. In the western parts of the world alien merchants mix in the society of the natives; access and intermixture are permitted, and they become incorporated to almost the full extent. But in the east, from the oldest times, an immiscible character has been kept up. Foreigners are not admitted into the general body and mass of the society of the nation; they continue strangers and sojourners as all their fathers were. “ Doris amara suam non intermiscit tendam.” Not requiring any national character under the general sovereignty of the country, and not trading under any. recognized authority of their own original country, they have been held to derive their present character from that of the association or factory under whose protection they live and carry on their trade. These authorities establish the position that, in the absence of Treaty local usage in Mahommedan countries in the east, has engrafted an exception to the general territorial jurisdiction in favour of Christians, by giving them the protection of their own factories and consuls; but that this exception would not extend to Mahommedans, who might be living, for the time being, in Mahommedan countries. This being the state of the law and usage in the absence of Treaty, it seems most unlikely that the Persian Governmentintended to allow Persians, who may be Persian subjects as also British subjects, to be exempted from the operation of their territorial law.

Vpmll at: (Signe) ’ B. SCHIMANOVSKY. Inclosure 18 in No. 1. Memorandum of a Conversation betiveen Mr. Larcom and M. Schimanovsky, respecting the Laws regulating Nationality in Russia. IN explanation of his note of the 31st ultimo, M. Schimanovsky informed me that “ naturalization laws,” in the sense in which that term is understood in England and on the Continent generally, are unknown in Russia, for the thing itself does not exist. In Russia the State does not permit or recognize any change in the nationality any more than in the religion of its own subjects, hence such laws are unnecessary. While as regards aliens resident or domiciled in Russia, or their descendants in any degree, whether born in the country or not, can never become Russian subjects or lose their original nationality. This M. Shimanovsky exemplified by the case of numerous Englishto I 11 privileges a nd advantages which attach to that character within the British dominions and that it would only be fair and right to extend to such persons, even in Persia, the benehts ot bemg placed under British protection, and especially if they had resided in' Krmsii India tor any time, so as to have been practically domiciled therein. Ra T linS ,° n 1 186 °; in the same man ner as Mr. Thomson does now, that he apprehended difficulties might arise and requested instructions as to what constituted the right of a person to be considered a British subject and to claim British protection m Persia; but as the law of foreign countries (particularly France and Russia) was not known, Lord Russell stated that no definite instructions could then be given as regarded them ; that is, it was impracticable to follow out strictly in relation to Persia or to any other Mahommedan Power, the principles of international law prevailing between Christian Powers, so far as regarded nationality and the right of protection, but that no new rule on the subject should be made, unless it were common to other Powers especially hranee and Russia; nor should any such rule or practice be retrospective’ and that no person enjoying British protection should be deprived of it. Consideiing, however, the question apart from usage, policy, or expediency, but exclusive y and strictly with reference to the principles of international law prevailing among Christian nations, a child of a Persian father born in the Queen’s dominions and returning to Persia, would not, whilst in Persia, be entitled to British protection, if the law of Persia considered him a Persian subject by reason of his Persian descent. Although, however, this would be the strict rule of international law, yet as it had not hitherto been acted upon in Persia, it was inexpedient to be made a rule of Enoffigh procedure there, unless it was made common to other European countries, especially to France and Russia. In 1862 instructions were sent to Mr. Alison, under the usage then in practice, to direct the Consul-General at Bagdad to take under his protection the sons of Ali Agha who were born in India, but were of Persian descent, while they resided at Bagdad. ° As to the analogous cases that have occurred in Turkey, it is stated in a despatch of Lord Russell to Sir H. Rawlinson, that the children of persons born in the Queen’s dominions, enjoy British protection, unless they have acted in such a manner as to forfeit the right thereto, and have “elected” the Turkish nationality of their fathers. In 18bf, instructions were requested by Mr. P. Francis, as to the grant of British protection to one Bagio, a Jew, whose parents were Ottoman subjects of Aleppo, but who was alleged to have been born in British India. The question was referred to the Law Officers, who reported, that if Bagio was not born in India, he had no claim to British protection ; hut assuming that he was born there, his claim must depend on the usage and practice that had prevailed in Turkey; that it had been laid down in 1860, that the children born in Her Majesty’s dominions of Turkish parents, and afterwards going into Turkey, habitually enjoyed British protection, unless they had acted in such a manner as to forfeit the right thereto, and to “ elect” the Turkish nationality of their fathers; and Bagio, therefore, born in India, would, as they understood the practice that had prevailed, be entitled to claim British protection in Turkey, unless he had by his acts adopted his father’s nationality. They, however, further reported that it was probable that under the law of Turkey Bagio, even though born abroad, might, by reason of his parentage, be deemed to be a Turkish subject; it might, therefore, be a question of policy, desiring much consideration, whether it was expedient to keep up, in the case of Turkey, the dis tinction which had been observed in this country between persons born in Her Majesty’s dominions of foreign parents who were the subjects by parentage of another Christian country, and who, when in that country, did not enjoy British protection ; and persons similarly circumstanced in a country professing the Mahommedan religion, who according to practice were allowed such protection. With respect to another case, that of a person named Schlizzi, who was born in the Turkish dominions, but who resided for some time in England, where he was naturalized, and where four of his children were born, and who subsequently returned to the Ottoman dominions, where another child was born. Mr. Francis was informed, that neither Schlizzi nor his child born in Egypt, could claim British protection there; and also that the children born in England, while they formed part of their fathei’s family, should not be taken under British protection, unless some usage to the contrary had prevailed in Turkey; and not then, without further communication with Her Majesty’s Government, to whom the matter should be fully explained. A further case with regard to the protection of Indian subjects in Turkey may be mentioned.

Elliot, January 1, 1874, 12 bavins: informed him that the Turkish Government intended to treat m Damascus all Afghans, without exception, as Ottoman subjects; and that this intention mcl indian British subjects. And although the Governor-General that it was through a misapprehension he had done this, yet that Halet Pas sl was far from satisfactory, for he had used the words Afghans and Indians m such a man ner as if to evade the real question. The explanation that Halet Pasha offeied m his further letter was, that he had never contested the right that Indian subjects had to British protection; but that he had received orders to treat the Afghans as Ottoman SUb j e yf ce _c 0Ilsu l Green, however, informed him that it was his first duty to maintain the rights of British subjects without regard to their race or creed. m Previous to this, Sir H. Elliot reported that he had called on the Turkish Govern ment to direct the Governor-General of Syria to desist from these pretensions ; and that he would not permit the rights of British Consuls to protect all British subjects to be called in question. He also reported, that the Turkish Government had informed mm that orders had been sent to the Governor-General to abstain from interfering with Her Majesty’s Consulate with respect to Indian Mahomedan subjects of the Queen, or Afghans enjoying British protection. . Sir H. Elliot then-suggested that the misunderstanding probably arose in the first place from the uncertainty attached at Damascus to the meaning of the word Afghan, and from the habits of the Mahommedan British subjects making no profession of their nationality. Sir H. Elliot was informed that the steps he had taken with regard to the protection of British Indian subjects were approved. Sir H. Elliot then instructed Vice-Consul Green no longer to discuss the question as to the right of Her Majesty’s Vice-Consulate at Damascus to protect the Indian - British subjects, as the dispute was in all probability attributable to the general significance attached at Damascus to the term Afghan; that if the Governor-General had at first explained the distinction that was held between Afghans properly so called, and Indian British subjects, it was likely no question would have arisen; but he considered that Vice-Consul Green had acted very properly in refusing to admit the pretensions which the Governor-General had at first put fonvard. In October following, Vice-Consul Green forwarded a further correspondence he had had with the Governor-General on this subject; and he stated that the Governor-General had entirely withdrawn the assumption, hitherto put forward, to consider all Afghans as Ottoman subjects. The whole of this correspondence was forwarded to the Government of India, and that Government desired their feelings of satisfaction at the successful measures that had been taken by Her Majesty’s Ambassador, and Her Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Damascus, in the matter, to be made known to them.

The question arose from the fact that Persia did not recognise British nationality in persons of Persian descent. In particular, it references the case of Agha Mehdee; a person of Persian descent who has enjoyed British subject status for a number of years. His status as a British subject is accepted by the Government of Persia, but they do not consider this to be a precedent to be conferred on others. The attitudes of France and Russia towards their subjects are considered in order to inform the British position on the matter. The papers included are outlined below.A letter (No. 1, folios 96-100) from William Taylor Thomson, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Persia, to Edward Henry Stanley, Earl of Derby, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, dated Tehran 15 February 1876, with the following enclosures:1.
