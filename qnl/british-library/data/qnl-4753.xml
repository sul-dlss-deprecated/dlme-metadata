I have the honour to address Government regarding the Shaikhdom of Ras- al-Khaimah. 2. As the Government of India are aware, Shargah and Ras-al-Khaimah are the possessions of the formerly predominant Jowasim clan, now extinct, except for the members of the Ruling family. In 1900, when Shaikh Humaid bin 'Abdullah, Chief of Ras-al-Khaimah, died at an advanced age, the government of the place was re-incorporated in the principality of Shargah from which it had been separated since 1869, and the Shaikh of Shargah sent his son Khalid bin Sagar to rule as his deputy. Khalid bin Sagar having died of consumption in March 1908, Shaikh Sagar unwisely deputed his uncle and then Wazir, Salim bin Sultan, to replace his deceased son. - Salim bin Sultan, who it will be remembered had formerly been Shaikh of Shargah and who is one of the principal figures in the Abu Musa drama, soon set up pretensions as independent Shaikh, as was only to be expected. Shaikh Sagar of Shargah strongly resented this attitude on his uncle's part and expressed his firm intention of ousting his uncle, and I therefore considered it inexpedient to ask Government to accord their official recognition, the more so because it seemed to me conceivable that the Germans might make use of the fact that Salim was now an independent Jowasim Shaikh, to suggest to him to advance independent claims, as such, to a share in the income or voice in the administration of Abu Musa and Tanb islands, which he was unable to put for' ward as Wazir and henchman of the Shaikh of Shargah. Thus, like the Abu Musa dispute, the matter has dragged on for 4 years, during which period the Shaikh of Shargah has not yet felt strong enough to oust his aged uncle from Ras-aUKhaimah, while the latter has continued to remain de facto ruler. His age, however, cannot be less than 80, and perhaps his nephew hopes that he will soon solve the difficulty by making his exit from the stage in the ordinary course of nature. 3. My own view is that it is still convenient, for the purposes of the Abu Musa dispute, to let things remain as they are and to withhold specific official recognition of Shaikh Salim as an independent Shaikh. In the meanwhile, he is acting up to the spirit of treaty engagements and generally behaving in practice as one has the right to expect of a Trucial Shaikh, so that no local inconvenience arises from his non-recognition. As however the question has hung fire so long and I have been reminded of * Government of India No. i472'G., dated 4th it in another connection,* I have thought it July 1212. expedient to place Government in posses- . sion of the circumstances, in case their view should differ from mine. ujl ft- OujiuU' 1^1% uu _ G.

Cox, K.C.I.E.,C.S.I*, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Dated Simla, theJ?^ Sir, 1912. With reference to your letter No. 1672, dated the 4th August 1912, on the subject of the status of the present Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, I am directed to inform you'that the OoTemment of India agree that no official recognition of Shaikh Salim as an independent Chief is called for at present and that it is preferable to let things remain as they are. I have the honour to 'be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, m A. ^ Deputy Secretary to the Government of India.P.R.Basrah, In October last the Residency Agent at Shargto wrote saying that Shaikh Salim bin Sultan, Shaikh of. Ras-el-Khaimah, had never received copies of the treaties etc in force with the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast; he added that it was desirable that he should receive copies, in view of prohibition of import and /U export ox arms and ^reciprocal treaty regarding slaves, both of which require Shaikh's attention. The reason he has never received copies of Treaties is because he has never been recognized since his assump tion of office. In August 1912 you wrote to Government saying that a,#*- it would be inconvenient to recognize Salim as^independent Shaikh in view of his relations with his nephew Shaikh Sagar of Shargah, and of the possibility of the Germans r&lt; making use of the fact that Salim was now an independent XowajTmi Shaikh to suggest to him to advance claims, as such, to a share in the income, or voice in the adminis tration of Abu usa and Tanb Islands which he was urable to put forward as V/azir and Headman of the Shaikh of Shargah. v In 1910 when Salim assumed Shaikhdom of Ras-el-Khai mah Khan Bahadur Abdul L'atif put forward the same suggest- /c ion and you then said that it was inadvisable this claim /* of Shaikh Salim to independence and you would ignore K .B .Abdul Latif's letter. Since those days matters have changed a good deal. Shaikh Sagar has died and the present Shaikh of Shargah is more or less subservient to Shaikh Salim who seems the to be /kia dominating personality of the family. Further in view of the war the Abu Musa case has lost a good deal of its importance. Under the circumstances flo you think it would be advisable to suggest to the Government of India that Salim migh-t3W might nov/ be recognized aa Shaikh of Ras-el-Khaim.h and. given a copy of the Treaties, etc?. Or would be better to let things stay as they are till Shaikh Saiim departs injtho ordinary course of nature. You reported in 1912 that he was over 80, and might do tliis soon, but apparently he is going strong and nay last for years yet. The Residency Agent has never reminded and Shaikh Salira has made no sign, so matter is not pressing and perhaps we mirht let it stand?. A.?.Trevor. Bushire, 12-5-15. As the files are bulky I am not sending them up. I think the above note and your recollection of the matter will make it clear. . 73 . T. 12-5-15. 0. S. D. I remember the case. I think that when Residency A^ent remipdo , you might send R.A. copies of the Treaties for him and ask him to take his receipt, but we could do this without giving him his sanad of recognition. I would prefer to hold this over until the vvar is over and we know definitely that the Abu Musa case is finished. x x p 7 n 14-5-1*. &lt;ri.
