Sir, I have thi 3 honour to inforra you that t lie re is stored in the cellars of His Majesty’s Consulate-General a varied and muaeroua collection of araall artus and amunition which I consider shotad be disposed of ns soon as circumstances permit. 2 # j enclose a general list of these munitions which for present purposes have been divided into lour categories* 3 , In the first category are arms and arrmnitlon th« pro party of Hla i»jeaty»s (lorornnant or of th* aorornirient of ln&lt;U«. I do not con.Wor ti»t any useful purpose enn b. served by the further retention here oi these munitions&lt; At the time of the departure of the foriaer legation g-oard their retentlcm aay have given an added sense of security but In present circumstances and with an Italian guard at the gate It would, I laaglne, he Impolitic to use them .van In an aaorgancy. I anticipate that the local authorities would make no difficulty about the export of these munitions for shipment to whatever destination his liajeaby's uovemiaan- or the oove.-nment of India may decide. , .

In the early days of Hay, 1936, some two thousand persons took refuge in the grounds of His majesty’s Legation. As they entered the gates all arms were taken from them and in respect of each firearm the bearer was given a numbered label bearing the seal of His f^ajesty 1 * Legation, the duplicate of which was attached to the firearm. Host of the firearms so handed over wore subsequently recovered by the depositors* those Included In the third category represent th« unclaimed balance though I should perhaps explain that since my arrival here appllcation^hav© been made by several persons, holding labels, oi whose * Lrearms no trace could bo found. In any case X consider that in present circumstances the delivery of arms by the Consuls te«*Oeneral to private Individuals might lead to misunderstanding and I have therefore arranged that, / pendingponding the rocalpt of your Instructions* no firearms are to be hand ad ovor oven if tho applicants prosent ntinborad labels the duplicates of which ars attached to arms in the cellars* Actually the likelihood of such applications now boiiv made aoems small. In any case the question of the disposal of the firearms must I think be faced. It aeoias to me that the most practical solution* if and wt on his haj»sty*8 Ooweranont recognise the Italian annexation of Ethiopia * would be to band tham over to the Italian authorities with an explanation of how they were deposited here. 6. I would propose similarly to dispose of the sacks of ammunition figuring in cate^ry throe* Sorae ; Ive hundred rotmcls of this asrsunition Is however of the soft nosed or 'dum-dum* variety and the objections to handing it over to the Italian authorities are manifest. I could no doubt arrange to have this M duffl-dum , ammunition burled in the compound but this could not be done without the knowledge of tho native staff and the possibility of its being dug up again could not be ignored. on the other hand I have no ^eans of destroying it and as the best means of its disposal I fall back on the suggestion that it be included with* but separate from* the ammunition in the first category and destroyed by competent persons cm reaching the prescribed destination* 7* ThB misoellaneous collection of firearms in th© fourth category should I suggest be disposed of in the seme maimer as those in the third category* i.e. handed over to the Italian authorities after «e jugo recognition has been accorded. Indeed in view of our ignorance of how this collection came to be in the cellars at all atwi of / thetho difficulty la finding *n explanation to cover the deposit of so many firearm It la for consideration ahether the firearms and ordinary amrmltlon In the third and fourth catesorlea should not be lumped together. Tha flrat atep. If my proposals for their dlaposal met with your approval, would presumably be for me to inform the Ohef da Cabinet that I had received your instructions to hand over to the Italian authorities a quantity of arms anti ammunition which had been surrendered to Hlu Majesty's legation by refuses In Stay, 1936 and to enquire where they should be delivered or whether the competent authorities would prefer to collect them at Hla Majesty's Consulcte-Oeneral. Kobody need be any the wiser if in fact some of the firearms so handed over had come into the hands of tho legation and so of the Consulate-General In circumstances! now unknown. 8.

The Consul-General advises that the material falls into four categories: property of HMG or the Government of India; property belonging to Europeans who have left Ethiopia; property left behind by persons who took refuge in the Legation in May 1936; and miscellaneous. The possibility of handing the material over to the Italian authorities is discussed, as is the difficulty of disposing of 500 rounds of 'dum-dum' ammunition left by the refugees.
