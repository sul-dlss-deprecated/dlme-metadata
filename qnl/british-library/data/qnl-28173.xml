Colonel Fowle was informed that it is not possible to ex-yoet from the Finance Department the sum of Rs. 15,000/- required by you for the servants* quarters, but he was given to understand that if we put up a revised scheme for Rs. 3,000/- the Foreign and Political Department will do their best to put it through this year. *2 u Lieut-Colonel Gordon Loch, C.I.E., Political Agent, B A H R A I N.3, Will you, therefore, if you see fit, submit official proposals for a nev/ scheme costing not more than Rs, 3,000/-? The proposals should be put for ward de novo with reference to my official memorandum quoted above, and the scheme should be devised in such a way that it will be possible to continue the construc tion in another year and eventually rebuild the ser vants* quarters in toto in accordance with your orginal scheme. In other words, the work will have to be undertaken piecemeal and the present proposal to spend Rs. 3,000/- would be regarded as a first instalment to aV the work. 4. \V£&gt; v Y V r ' Colonel Fowle considers that the strongest argument woulj:! be the medical g^a-nts referred to In / your official letter No. 670/18-6 dated the 7th March 1936, and you might reincorporate the gist of this letter in submitting your new proposals with reference to my official memorandum quoted in the first paragraph above. 5.

In view of the fact that it has not been found possible to sanction the total amount required for the complete scheme in this financial year, I propose that the scheme be taken in hand in instalments and have put up a plan which can be continued from year to year until the original scheme has bean completed* During this financial year I request that funds amounting to Rs.3200/- be provided. With this amount it will be possible to provide two new quarters, after clearing the site, and also to provide a latrine for the Agency servants. At presentpresent the servants have to wrlfc fifty yards to a latrine operating into the sea* The latrine is a noisome affair as the times of use cannot be regulated by t he tides and twice in every twenty-four hours at low tide the natural flushing system does not act.

This scheme has the advantage in that no big initial outlay is involved* During the current year only a sum of Ss 3200/- will have to be provided by (Govern ment which amount it is hop^d will be readily forthcoming* 4. The present servants* quarters are situated to the south of the Agency* where they are shut off from the prevailing winds* The rooms are small* dark and ill- ventilated* and the salt damp oozing from the walls and creeping up through the floors make them nost unhealthy*Ibe stat« of tbo walls and floors la such that It is not considered that tfcey could be put into good order by any reasonable repairs* in the opinion of the Medi cal officer at Bahrain the quarters are not fit for ser vants to live in and this is the main cause of ill health prevalent among the Agency menial staff. 5* these quarters are so situated that everyone who comes to the Agency must pass thorn. Their condition is so bad that even the Arab of Bahrain comments adverse ly upon them. It is obvious that such a state of affairs should bo remedied forthwith and 1 accordingly support the proposal put forward by the officiating olitical &gt;gsnt f viz that during the current financial year a sum of Is 3200/- may be set apart for the purpose of erecting 2 new quarters, and also to provide a latrine for the Agency servants.

Bahrein dated the 14th December 1936. To The Political Agent, Bahrein. Sir, Subject- Hepsrt on front verandah of the Agency. I beg to report that the front verandah of the .Cency building which is facing the eea,is 12 feet 6 inches wide,and this width has been spanned by thin chan dais which are about Scinches diameter.These chtndals are too thin for such a big span. The floor of the verandah consists of these thin chandals as joists,resting cn stout chandals,which serve as ii^els,supported by thich masonry pillars 21 9 ' squire usual Basra mats ,handful of date sticks,mud ano gutcu plaster.Weight of all these mate tne wax* chandais defe iect.These ddfiections cause depression in the middle^ of the verandah.In to these depressions rain water collect and soak tnrough the verandah floor and wooden lintels, and thus damage gutch plaster of lintels,and damage the ehdj of chandals.The damage is due to swelling of eland'Is v.ith water r.,ncL swelling of gutch, a sort of movement takes place pushes the gutch out.This falls to ground.And the imprisonment of water in side the ch in dal s ca^use v/eij rot It cannot be said with certainty how many chandai-s have perished^ /V Ty the recent rains five bays cf gutch plaster from \ chonc els gi ve w©y end there is every possibiity of ethers coming down before the end of the rainy season.i 0 In para 2 I have said that rain water collects in the depression. This is solely due to driving in of rain water hy the SHIMAL wind,loth the covered and open verandah hecomes wet,and the flooa •f the verandah practically has no slope atall.'V the absence of slope the depressions in the centre of the verandah help to accumulate more water.this extra weight the chandals deflect more and at times reach their elastic limit.There are good many broken chandals in the verandah. Wooden sun shades and old pattern water spouts also contribute ih their share of water as well,during the rains.The rain that str: kes against the sun shades falls over the lintels, and the rain water coming down from the roof is carried into the verandah by wind. Year after year the floor of the front verandah is repaired by small portions,but it does net improve the situation in nc way.Because the deflected chandals are reused,they again go on deflecting,though they are turned before layingajwi further the renewed pertion of the verandah is to be kept levSl with the old,here the object is defeated.Yo proper slope is possible. 1 beg uo sug£ est that the f±ont verandah is to be relaid with better materials and workmanship.The fclloving are the suggesstions to improve the condition of the verandaft. Cement concrete lintels instead cf chandals .Faces, teak joists instead of thin chan dal b ,hoi lew tiles, a layer of bitumen,lime plaster,and on the top flooring tiles. Tilting the wooden sun shades and bringing them a bit out of the building so that the rain water that beat again t then may-fall out side the building instead of inside.-ste board is also recommended. d Removing the ©Id v/ooen water spouts and providing iron down take pipe*cA ect8d drip course is also suggested to the ver^nda^. 3 I am afraid that my suggestions no doubt good at the same time eostly f hut the costly work is always the duirable work, and once we do a good joh of it there is no necessity of further repairs for a number of years. The whole of the Agency buiirUng has very bai floor and roof X beg to suggest that some thing like the drawing room is to be done,so that the building may have the appearance of what Xe it should hrtve while it is in the hands of the Pubiick works department.No buildings are springing un every day at fAhAh to suit our convenience,we have to ask the 'Xoverment for special repair grants of atleast 2s5000/- for 4 years,during this period the building can be brought on modern lines, and our work may not be then far below the stander of Jabai* I beg to remain Sir, Your most obediet servant, SupervisorNo.74-1S/£».

I do not think that stones costing Es4/ per 100 eft. will be of any use for the flooring,because they are brought frtem the sea,so th«y contain sea water,this will soon evaporate leaving behind deposit of salt, which will attract damp from atmospher,and the state of the new floor will in no way be better thar the Agency floor.3 Therefore I heg to suggest that 6 inches thick layer of dry stone from Kafe, and 4 inches thick cement concrete 1*3*6 is to be laid below local made tiles i in order to make the best job of it•For this I require -extra. 4 Detail instructions regarding the above matter may please be sent to me at your earliest convenience• I will not be hel^ responsible Tor trie oa^ work,if I am asked to use broken stones brought from the sea, which are unfit for such purpose,as they have dissolved dalt in then and some vegetable matter in the 'rorm of moss adhearing to them.This will not allow cement mortar to stick to them.

Unfortunate!/- nothing came out of them,and the condition of the buildings in question have gone from bad to worst-. 2 so far I remember,Special repairs to servants quarters were carried out by me in 1926,and since that time no repair were done to them.It may be due to this fact that there was an idea of rebuilding these quarters on modern lines or repair them throughly.When these things will take place no body knows.Even the annual repairs to these neglected buildings were not satisfactorily carried out during the past sc many years. The result of all these is the shameful appearance of the building belonging to the Imperial Govern ment. 3 What man builds nature destroys,unless he takes pain to preserve it.^s s rule all Special repairs are carried out after 3 years,and it is a pity that no Special repairs were done to these sertf ants quarters for the last ten years or d©.

Subject:- Report on the front verandah and the Agency Building at Bahrain - remoranduru With reference to his report on &gt;the front verandah in particular and the Agency BuiMing at Bahrain in general, he is informed that the Undersigned does not agree with the proposal put forth* It would entail the demolition of roof-and floor and rebuild same on expensive lines. While redoing the Court Boom and the Drawing Boom the cost worked out to somewhat in the neighbourhood of Rs. 5/8/- per Sft* whereas a new double storied building can be put up something like F~ * *3/- to 10/- per Sft. At the same time the chandals used though sagged are' in no way danger to the safety of the building. What has been resorted to in the past should be done in the future and that would be ipore in keeping with the present building built in coral stones with mud mortar. All bad portions of roof and floor should be tackled in,order of urgency and replaced by stouter chandals. Treated this way no special grant will be necessary and the building could be improved bit by bit and year after year. 2. Coming to the question of Kitchen, a special repair estimate for which has been prepared and submitted, there is nothing wrong with the roof chandals they are strong enough and need not be changed. The roof leaked because because the rain water escaped through cracks. As a rule gutch plsstK invariably cracks and unless the gutch plaster is removed and mud plaster put on the trouble is not going to abate. On mud roofs if sufficient slope is given the rain water runs off and does not percolate through. This forms part ’of theI f L' -1 '.l-T- ^' Ordinary Repairs for which no funds are placed at the disposal of this office. 3. Stationery Room has already been .dealt o with* 4. This may please be noted for future y idance that all reports and estimates should first be referred to this office and this office when satisfied will take further action. The practice of takiny direct action should be stopx&gt;ed. r« * rReference your predecessors letter Fo. 665 18/6, dated the 20th. March, 1937, 2 .

M We have examined the materials received from you for use in the concrete construction of the new residency at Bahrain. The limestone is of good hard quality and if well graded should produce a concrete of good strength. The material described as sea sand is full of shell material and is too uniform in grain size to be used in good concrete work, unless used in conjunction with other suitably graded coarse material. For the above construction the best concrete would be obtained by using crushed limestone in place of sea sand, and for this purpose I suggest that the limestone be crushed into two portions as follows (a) Limestone crushed from 3/16 in. to dust. (b) ' * ' 3/4 in. or 1 in. to 3/16 in. Care should be taken in preparing the material for (a) not to obtain an excessive quantity of dust. Sample blocks (under separate cover) have been pre pared to give some idea of the grading obtained with the following mixes:- Cube marked (1) Composed of 1 part cement, 2 parts 3/16 in. down crushed limestone, and 4 parts 3/4 in. - 3/16 in. limestone. Cube marked (2) Composed of 1 part cement, 3 parts 3/16 in 4 down crushed limestone, and 4 parts 3/4 in. - 3/16 in. limestone. Cube marked (3) Composed of 1 part cement, 2 parts sea sand, and 4 parts 3/16 in. - 3/8 in. limestone.2- fro ^ v All the above concretes gave a good strength, butit will be seen that in the case of the sea sand mix (3) there is an excess of fine sand material* Mixes (1) and (2) are equally good but owing to the coarse nature of the sand material the mix (2) gave a more workable mix* Without knowing your local conditions with regard to available labour etc*, it is difficult to suggest any definite gradings apart from the above, but I think that if you could crush the material as described above, it will not be difficult to obtain a dense concrete of good strength. It may be possible for you to improve the workability of the concrete by suitably blending your sand with crushed limestone•1585/ 18/6 No. The Political Agent, Bahrain, presents his compliments to:— The Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. and has the honour to send him a copy of the undermentioned document (s). for favour of transmission to the Assistant Engineer, Independent Persian Gulf Subdivision, Bushire.

D.O. No. 338/8. May 16, 1937. Dear Hickinbotham, Before loch left we had several dis cussions about altering the corner foriaed by the iigency wall behind the new court. It was finally agreed that the south-west corner should be cut off and in return for this the Agency would receive a piece of ground from the south-west corner of the Post Office build- -ing. The enclosed plan shows the position. The intention of these improvements is to make a safe road without a blind corner to take the traffic which is increasing daily owing to the Manama-Muharraq Causeway. The tank between my house and the Post Office will have to be moved and a new one is to be made in the new wall. The lower branches of the banyan tree opposite Agency gate are to be cut and the tree is to be in an island with a road on each side so that cars coming and going will keep to their right side. It was also suggested that there should be a dividing line round the corner between my gate and the new court but I find this is difficult to arrange without entirely blocking my entrance. Will you some time have a look at the we ground and let me know when/can start rebuild ing your wall. Until we get the present wallwall down it is not possible to mark out the new line of the road.

T have gone through the estimates prepared hy the Suu^rvisor and comnared them with the work executed hy the P.A. T can’t say anything about the quality of the work carried out. As there has been no supervision over the labour employed, I very much doubt, if the works come to the P.^.D. standard. Leaving aside the question of quality, T give below reasons for the difference in the estimated amount and the actual expenditure. Item. 7. ^he supervisor had provided 60 chandals, while during construction only 30 were used. Since half the number of chandals was used, it means half the • quantity of the rope was consumed for fixing date sticks etc. to the chandals and consequently half the labour was employed, therefore allowing the rates given by P.A, the difference due to above item is as follows : - chandals ( 30 ) ^ope T abour r, 6al Tar fe. IS Ps. ^ Ps. 8 Rs. 2 (provided by super- Ifc. 32. Adding ft. 6 ^ spent by T.A, the total amount should be Pc. 64 plus P°. 32 » lh.96, against Ps.110 provided by the Supervisor, ^his difference is due to t r e fact that l^ss quantity o^ sticks and r»ds were used. Item. 3. ^he Supervisor had provided for cement and stone masonry straightened with chandals. The length of the wall was to be 140 feet and the cost Ps. 125. 1 m he P.A has got only 63 ft length constructed with gjijd against cement at a cost of Fs. 60/4. Therefore P.A* S expenditure is about Pc. 133 against Ps. 125 (for 140 ft length). m his is for a stone and mud wall without P.T.OFrom No. 4/ Bushire August 1937. The Assistant Engineer, Ind.

Weightman, Esquire, I • C• S., Political Agent, BahrainBAHRAIN GOVERNMENT ELECTRIC SUPPLY DEPT. Bahrain. 6 th December,1937 Dated • 3 rd Shavmal, 1356 Dear Weightman, Re air conditioning — one or two points have occurred to me, which I think, might be borne in mind when we think out the scheme. The only objection to the condensing type of unit is, that (it is supposed) the slight hardness of the water will coat the condensing arrangement. The answer to this is to instal a small n Permutit? softener to deal with the make up. This is inexpensive and gives z§XSi degrees of both temporary and permanent hardness, and also does away with expensive piping, drains and an extra (or one larger) pump. If, however, you still want the non-condensing type I would suggest as much storage as possible say, 160 gallons over each unit, i.e. 4 drums. The agency roof will quite easily carry the load if dis tributed. H.Weightman, Esquire, I.C.S. H.B.M’s Political Agent, BAHRAIN.

But 1 have just had tested an even better idea for those who cannot, or do not, feel disposed to instal an apparatus. LESS THAN A PENNY A DAY This is a water softener and purifier made in tablet form. All you have to do is to put one tablet in the cold water tank every week for the first four weeks. Then one every fortnight. This is sufficient for the consumption of 250 gallons of water a day (the average for a four or five- bedroom house). The water may run out very slightly brown — for the first few gallons —but it is almost un- noticeable and quite harmless. After that it is clear again. The cost works out at less than a penny a day. TaBIetT are sold in boxes of a dozen at 12s. a box. A LARGE HOTEL One of London’s largest and best known hotels is now using this method of softening the water supply and it is found highly satisfactory. My own tests leave nothing to be desired -except getting the tablet into the tank. No housewife who has been used to soft water realises the multiple irritations and the way the soap bills mount up when the water in a district is hard.

NO INSTALLATION EXPENSE OR APPARATUS REQUIRED DIRECTIONS FOR USE PLACE A CLENSOL Softener in a Clensol Container and suspend it in the cold water tank so that about half an inch of the container is immersed. There is a small hole at the bottom of the container which allows the water to percolate through and causes the gradual dissolution of the Clensol Softener. For a household of three to four persons we advise that 1 Softener should be placed in the container every week for the first 2 — 4 weeks, then 1 every 10 —14 days, depending upon the hardness of the water in the district. IN CASES of larger households, hotels and hospitals the number of Softeners used should be in proportion. CENTRAL HEATING SYSTEMS FOR A SYSTEM up to eight radiators one Clensol Softener placed in the supply tank every month for the first six months, afterwards one every other month, is sufficient to purify and soften the water. IN CASES where water is discoloured through corrosion or the iron element which is contained in some waters, Clensol Softeners can be used to great advantage. A Softener should be placed in a container and suspended in the tank, and by this method the discolouration can be immediately removed. SPRING AND WELL WATER IT IS SOMETIMES more economical to treat this water at the source, and as the hardness in different stricts varies considerably, a sample of the water snould be sent for free analysis. WHERE HOUSEHOLDERS FIND the circulating system is restricted — this occurs in old houses — we can supply a descaling solution known as Noricene (a product of Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., sold and serviced by us), and we advise if the system is sluggish that before Clensol Softeners are used, that the flow and return and boiler should be thoroughly descaled by the use of this solution. Noricene is sold in 1-gallon jars in concentrated form at 10/6 per jar, and the Plumber or your regular Stockist can arrange for the necessary labour. □ □ □ CLENSOL HOUSEHOLD WATER SOFTENERS are the simplest and most modern method of softening water. They are small bricks which are placed at regular intervals in the cold water supply tank. This is all that is necessary to obtain SOFT WATER suit able for drinking, cooking and washing. □ □ □ CLENSOL SOFTENERS remove the hard scale-forming salts from the water and precipitate them to the bottom of the tank in the form of a white film which does not injure the tank. In the ordinary way, if Clensol Softeners were not used, these hard scale-forming salts would be precipitated into the boiler and pipelines in the form of a heavy scale, thereby restricting the circulation, whereas by the use of Clensol Softeners this source of annoyance and trouble can be overcome at a cost of less than 1d. per day. (In hard water districts the system should be washed out thoroughly, annually, and a bucket full of water drawn off from the boiler each month to remove sludge).

BAHRAIN. 23rd December,1937 Dated: 20 th Shawwal, 1356 Dear Weightman, I have looked into the matter of your proposed water supply, and in my opinion it would be advisable to mstal two (600 gallons per hour) Gould pumps (it is always advisable to have duplicate pumps) and a storage tank on the roof of, say, 2 , 6'x5'x6’ to distribute the load. Suitable connections could be made to the tanks for sanitary purposes, and extra storage could be added later if requirements increase^. I do not think that there would be any advantage in increasing the pressure tank capacity, as this is designed according to the pump outjhut. I also do not think that if two/of a capacity of 600 gallons per hour each)pumps are installed, more roof storage than I mention/would be unnecessary, as the pumps would share the duty and be on the top of their work. Also the Agency roof is not of the stoutest, and will be also used, 1 presume, in the hot weather for 'At Homes etc' when it will have to carry a live load of say thirty persons (approximately 4500 lbs.) If, however, you contemplate, at some later date, increasing the air conditioning units, it might be advisable to consider installing a more robust type of pump, such as a direct coupled motor driven centrifugal,(rated for continious running) similar to those installed at Jufair. A pump of this description ( 2 i HP.motor) would lift approximately 3000 gallons per hour and would have easy duty, and, consequently, long life. I attach the approximate prices of the pumps,etc.BAHRAIN GOVERNMENT ELECTRIC SUPPLY DEPT. D.O.

Yours sincerely, H.Weightman, hsqr.I.C.S., H.B.M’s Political iigent, Bahrain.D.O. Dated the / 5^January 1938, Dear Mr. lurteza* I enclose herewith © rough estimate of the cost of installing Waterborne Sanitation etcetera in the Agency house here. I am sorry that it has been so much delayed but T have been making enquiries about pumps and so on and I have only .just completed them. 2. I ha.e the following remarks to make about the esti mate. The pump is the latest pattern k&gt;uld Pressure 3ystem pump, for which Khalil Kanoo is the agent in Bahrain, Seve ral of these pumps are already working in Bahrain and have been found most satisfactory. As you know I am proposing to instal an air conditioning unit from private funds in the Agency and there will be for that purpose a second tould Pres sure pump, so that there will t’us be duplicate pumps which can both be connected to the cistern on the roof, thereby reducing the x^ssihility of a breakdown to © minimum. Inci dentally, Khalil Kanoo has undertaken to maintain an adequate stock of spare parts, and the State Engine ring department know all about these pumps, so that we are in a good position to carry out. repairs at a short notice. Khalil Tanoo under takes to supply the pump at concession rates and I suggest taat you authorise me to negotiate the purchase of the Govern ment pump. You may perhaps think that a pump with a smaller delivery than 500 gallons per hour would be sufficient, but Lr. Steele strongly advises a bigger pump as it is more ro bust and will, as he puts it, be 'more on top of its work'. The/- S. G. lurteza, Esquire, D.Sc (bond)., Assistant engineer, Independent Persian Gulf Sub Division, BushireThe difYerence in co8t» between the 500 gallon ynd the gallon pump is very small, and I suggest it need not be re garded as an objection. The estimate for the piping and galvanised tank on the roof (which V.r. Steele tells me is really essential) has been made out by the P.W,D. Super iser here. You will see that it provides for a septic tank, and not for an outflow into the sea. I should have preferred outflow into the sea but that involves very heavy e xrenditure in outflow piping. In fact it would increase the estimate by over Ys. 1200 /- and T am afraid therefore that it cannot be considered. The septic tank system works very adequately in other houses in Bahrain and I think we shall have to instal it here. I have selected the fittings from the catalogues which you sent me, except for the baths which are not included in your catalogues. I have selected these from an old Boulton catalogue which I send herewith. As you will see I anticipate a rebate on the advertised nrice of about 20 per cent, this being the figure which the Superviser tells me we ore likely to get. 3. The total estimate is within the figure approved of Rs. 3000/-, and I hope you will accept it. I should be very glad to know if the Political Resident has approved of fittings being ordered at once (to be paid for next year) and I hope you will find it possible to place orders immediately.

KRallL Bin 'Sbrahim Kanfco. ■'mo mm /Captain Galloway agrees with me that the Agency Building at Bahrain needs thorough repairs* I do not believe in annual patching up haphazardly. The money thus spent is almost a waste. We might frame a regular programme say for 5 years, and spend 7 or 8 thousand rupees every year. The repairs carried out should be of permanent nature, that will not only strengthen the building, but make it more comfortable to live in. I would request you to please consider over it and let me have your views when I visit Bahrain soon after 10th April. 2. I am proposing the following works for this year, in addition to the sanitary installation:- (a) Two new garages in cement concrete 4 1 blocks, (to harmonize with the new servants quarters). (b) Renewing part of verandah roof, either with reinforced cement concrete beams and Arab pattern roof, or with reinforded cement concrete beams and f reinforced cement concrete slabs, which ever you approve. I have already asked the Supervisor to submit ' \ 'f comparative estimates. 3. I am earmarking another Rs. 7,000A for further/ H. Weightman, Esquire, X • C • iD ., Political Agent, Bahrain.2 1/ ! lr l further improvements* I would suggest the following works for your consideration* Of course you can propose any other, after consulting with Mrs* Weightman. (a) Dismantling part of the staircase and widening the bath room attached to No. 4 bed room. (b) Fixing larger windows in all the four bed rooms. (c) Converting portion of the verandah in front of the drawing room into a proper lounge. The existing katcha arrangement is not satisfactory. Instead of rickety wooden partitions, we might have pucca walls with proper doors and nice wide windows. 4. We have just received advance copy of our budget from Government of India. Final sanction will be received towards the end of this month, when the funds will be allocated. If you will let me know, when I come to Bahrain^ what works you want carried out this year, I will try to reserve the maximum amount for you. / Ir l With salams,o.
