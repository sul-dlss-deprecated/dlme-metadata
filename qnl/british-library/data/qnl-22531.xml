[ . / rf- 335- Dear Agency, We enclose herewith for your information an office order we are publishing on the sub ject of leave for our menial staff: we have long considered one month's paid leave per annum on the rather generous side and tending to certain abuses, and we have reached this decision after consulting other employers of labour in Bahrain. 2. We realise, of course, that the scale of leave proposed will not be sufficient for those of our menial staff who live at some distance from Bahrain (i.e. in Persia or Oman): but they will be permitted to take further unpaid leave without incurring any penalty.

With effect therefore from July 1st 1950 two weeks paid leave per annum only will be allowedi this may be accumulated up to the maximum of one month.
