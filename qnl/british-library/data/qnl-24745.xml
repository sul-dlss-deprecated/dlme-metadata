I i\ u , , I CORE FAR 'R, d.:u.ad 29 JAN1C14 2nd Weekly Letter. Dated Aden Residency, the 10th January 1914. From—The Political Resident, Aden, To—L. Robertson, Esq., I.C.S., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Special Department. The Amir of Dthala has reported that the Arabs under the Kataba District (Turkish) have tampered with five boundar y pillars .at Habil A1 Khadthr, Habil Bader, Habil Jardami (on theH^ataba-Dthala side), and also Omer Ismail, and Habil Batar (on the Ahmadi and Ad-dokan side). News from other sources confirms the destruction of two pillars only. Further confirmation is awaited from the Amir. A reprisal is reported to have been made by the Kataba (Turkish) subjects against the people of Lakamat A1 Ash’ub (Amiri). The Amir of Dthala tried to settle with the Kaim Makam of Kataba, locally, but his negotiations proved un successful. The matter is still pending, and this Residency is watching its development. Such reprisals are mutual. Some 40 or 60 of the Imam’s soldiers were taken by Mokbil Naji Az Zindani to Jabal Jihaf, and they were accommodated in his house. This was evidently done to gauge the feelings of the Jihafis, and, should it have proved successful, more would undoubtedly have followed ; but the inhabitants were exasperated at their advent, and stood at the forts and strongholds to resist them. Later reports indicate that the Imam’s men left (all of them) Jabal Jihaf, and returned to Kataba. I will report officially on this matter, after full confirmation of the facts. 2. The Assistant Resident, Perim, writes that an armed force of about 1,000 of all ranks—Africans and Turks {sic )—is reported to have arrived at Assab from Massowa, but whether in the ordinary course of refief or not is not known.

Hanotaux s attention to the fact that Sheikh Said was part of the Ottoman dominions. The last reference to this place in the correspondence now in the custody of the librarian appears to be the announcement made by Sir E. Monson m June 1899 tha* an offer had been made to the United States Ambassador at Paris on behalf of Messrs. Bazin and Rabaud, who claimed Sheikh Said, to sell it to the United States for This information was forwarded to the India Office and to His Majesty s Ambassadors at Constantinople, St. Petersburgh, and V' ashmgton. ^ ^ OAKES Foreign Office, January 31, 1901. To Sir F. Bertie. No. 28, January 11, 1905. [Continuation of Memorandum of January 31, 1901.] IN February 1903 the French Ambassador asked Lord Lansdowne for information as to our difficulties with the tribes in the neighbourhood of Aden, adding that France had no interest in the matter except to this extent—that there were French claims upon a spot called Sheikh Said opposite the Island of Perim. , Lord Lansdowne gave him a rough sketch of the circumstances which had created somewhat strained relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Turkish authorities in the Yemen, and told him that the territory of the tribes m which we had an interest did not extend so far to the west as Sheikh Said, but wished him, howe\er, to understand that, he expressed no opinion as to the validity of the French claims to Sheikh Said. IL ,1 On the 11th January, 1905, the French Ambassador told Lord Lansdowne that he had observed that we were engaged in a discussion with the Turkish Government as to the boundary of the Aden cantons, and that he wished to take this opportunity of reminding him that France had certain claims at Sheikh Said. The Irench Govern ment had no desire to raise the question, but it was desirable that we should he aware that it existed. . Lord Lansdowne replied that, without making any admissions as to the rights of France at Sheikh Said, he was able to say at once that the frontier line as we proposed to draw it would strike the coast at a point considerably farther south than that place. It was therefore not necessary that the question of Sheikh Said should be discussed between them. It was then suggested that the matter should be referred to the Defence Committee, as Sheikh Said if fortified would render Perim untenable and close the narrow strait, though it would not dominate the wide strait, but the suggestion does not appear to have been acted on. Sheikh Said is in the Subaihi territory, and, in connection with the boundary agreement of 1905, the Turkish Government has undertaken never to alienate to a third Power the Subaihi territory lying between Husn Murad and Kudam, in which Sheikh Said is situate. Two masonry pillars in cement were built by the British Commission, and the Turkish had a cairn of rough stone erected in the vicinity of Sheikh Said. Foreign Office, September 23, 1911. G. E. P.

We do not consider much is to he gained by formal ratification of Aden delimitation. In any case ratification could hardly be considered as concession for which we should give a quid pro quo. As regards prolonga tion of Aden frontier, we understand present position is that Turkish Government have recognised that frontier is a line running from Lakmat-es- Shub true north-eastwards to the desert. Unless line is delimited it does not seem a matter of much practical importance whether they agree that this line extend to join blue line of Anglo-Turkish Convention or not. Delimita tion Commission, however, would be a most costly and lengthy proceeding, and might result in our incurring resentment of tribes. Proposals therefore do not commend themselves to us, and compensation from Turkey could in our opinion more advantageously be sought after elsewhere, including, if this be thought necessary, some reassurances regarding non-alienation of the Subaihi littoral outside our boundary to a third Power.V ?v Indi and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

IN accordance with the instructions contained in your despatch No. 393 of the 23rd instant, I have the honour to inform you that I have consulted Mr. Fitzmaurice as to whether he considers that the protocols of 1903, 1904, 1905 regarding the delimitation of the Aden Boundary should all be ratified. Mr. Fitzmaurice is of the opinion that it would seem best to have all three protocols ratified. He further observes that there is also the question of the inhabitants of Shahr and Mukalla on the Hadramaut coast, whom the Turkish authorities, notably at Hodeidah, have in the past claimed as Ottoman subjects. It might, he suggests, be expedient to utilise the present occasion to induce the Ottoman Government to send instructions to the Yemen authorities not to insist in the future on the recognition of these people as Ottoman subjects.

Parkes respecting Shehr and Mokalla. SHLHR and Mokalla are the two principal ports on the Hadramaut coast They are under the chiefship of Sultan Awadth-bin-Omar of the Kayti tribe. Particulars of their history are contained in “ Aitchison’s Treaties,” vol. 13, pp. 66-69 (1909 edition). Hi® Majesty s Government decided in 1887 to enter into protectorate agreements To India with all the tribes on the Hadramaut coast north-eastward between Aden and the limit Office, of Oman influence at Ras Sail*. In pursuance of this decision a protectorate agreement Novem ' was concluded on the 1st May, 1888, with the chiefs of Shehr and Mokalla. This ber19 ’ 1887 - agreement was ratified on the 26th February, 1890. As regards earlier relations, it is to be noted that in 1863 and 1873 the chiefs of Shehr and Mokalla entered into engagements with the British Government for the abolition and suppression of slavery, and that m 1882 the then chief (Jemadar) concluded an agreement with the British Government by which he became a British stipendiary. In 1881 a dispute took place between the chiefs of Shehr and Mokalla m which Minute the Aden authorities intervened. The Mokalla chief appealed, on the ground that he with Sir N - was an Ottoman subject, to the Sultan of Turkey. Thereupon the Porte complained of ^ British mteiference, but were informed, in reply, that His Majesty’s Government saw Treaty^ no ground for such remonstrance. A further complaint made by the Porte in 1882 was July 20, not answered. 1903. In 1903 a question arose as to the right of Omar Basar and his brothers, natives of SirN. of Shehr and Mokalla, to be registered at Hodeida as British-protected persons. This ? T ,Con f r ’ right had been recognised by His Majesty’s Government earlier in the same year in the treaty’ case of such natives resident in Zanzibar, but Sir N. O’Conor thought the Porte would July 20, be strongly disinclined to recognise our right to protect Hadramis in the Ottoman 19 03. Empire. It was pointed out by the India Office that the claimants at Hodeida had ludia Office, settled there (about 1883) five years before the Shehr and Mokalla tribes came under :|V u &amp; ust 24 &gt; British protection, and instructions were given to Sir N. O’Conor that the claim in this 1 0 ^*. instance should be refused on that ground. O’Conor^ No. 266, Septem ber 28,1903. Subsequently it was ascertained that Omar Basar’s domicile at Hodeida dated India Office, from after the assumption of the British protectorate over Shehr and Mokalla, and it Marc l 1 was held by the Foreign Office and India Office, when considering an application made by him to the Aden authorities, that he was entitled to receive a British passport to j^ng 1 ^ 0 ’ Hodeida. 1905 . Mr. Barclay sent home in January 1907 despatches from the vice-consul at Hodeida Mr.Barclay, respecting the refusal of the local authorities there to recognise natives of Shehr and ^ T °- 9 &gt; Janu- Mokalla as being under British protection. Both the Foreign Office and India Office (ifoe/oV 9 ) 07 considered that the vice-consul was justified in according to these natives the same i n( j ia office* protection that he would afford to British subjects, and Sir N. O’Conor was instructed March 13, to inform the Porte that the vice-consul’s proceedings in the matter were correct. 1907 (8284, File 1406/07). To Sir N. ( O’Conor, No. 117, March 30, 1907 (8284/07.)

The Board would therefore suggest that hakki Paslia should be informed that Bis in jo sty’s Government will not object to the ertablishmont of monopolios or the impositioa -CT ofof consumption taxes in rospoct of matches, cigarette nr nor playing cards, and spirits; that as regards sugar, thejr \,ould ref-Tot the adoption of eith or course, but would rwgxuNl a as consunr.jtion duty as the loos objectionable; and that regards potroi.ou-i Um if : upo ... ( ju largely bo influenced by, the settlement reached in respect of akki Pasha's draft, I m to say that the Board concur in r. ferlii^; s suggestion that the British share of the future iiaporoa mto Turkey in respect of any monopoly should be baced on the average r;ro ^ortioji, of the imports from the United Kingdom to the total imports during the three years preceding t/w ostabiiohment of th© monopoly. ill© under taking formulated in llakki Pasha’s draft, viz: that the Eatiml quantity to be purchased snaU bo the average for the preceding torse years ?fouid deprive the initod Kingdom of any right to participate in any increase of trade, and would on the other hand compel the Turkish Govommemt or its nominees to purchase a constant quantity whatever the variations in their requirements.As regards paragraph 4, if any consent is given to the establishment of consumption duties, it ought in the opinion of the Board to be made clear that this should form no precedent for the Imposition of similar duties, under any name whatsoever, in regard to any other articlebj that the maximum limit of such duties must be fixed by arrangement with the Powers; and that, similar articles of local production shall be subjected to precisely the same amount of charge. The Board note Hakki Pasha* s reservation in paragraph 5, with regard to the question of light dues; they assume that His Majesty’s Government will Insist on the appointment in 1919 of a joint commis sion for the preparation of a revised scale of dues to come into effect in the year 1925, and that no agreement made by the Ottoman Government shall be re garded as restricting such revision in any way whatsoever. Section 2 of the Draft , The Board entirely concur In Mr. Marllng , 8 observations on this section. w and they also think there is much force in his con tention that His Majesty’s Government should reserve theirtheir right to discuss the contents of any new Stamp Law before it is applied to British subjects. His majesty's Government have already expressed their willingness to consider in conjunction with the other Powers the extent to which it may he possible to modify the regime of the capitulations, and they think it undesirable that the question should be dealt with in a piecemeal manner. On this ground alone the present proposal, involving a breach in the regime is open to criticism, but in addition the objection advanced by Mr. Marling to Ottoman authorities or sub ordinate officials of the Debt Administration being vested with power to interfere with British firms in their places of business and to have access to their confidential papers, deserves moat careful con- r sideratlon. V The Board share Section 3 of the Draft Mr. Marling's misgivings with respect to the proposed imposition of Octroi duties, but they recognise that it is difficult for His Majesty's Government to meet the Turkish request with a complete refusal and that it may be necessary to acquiesce in the imposition of municipalI municipal octroi on a limited range tit articles, which in their opinion should he restricted to articles of food (•Comestibles*). The:/ would suggest accordingly that in the first place Hakkl Pasha should be invited to indicate precisely what the Turkish Government include undei 4 the term •articles generaleipent soumis • « a 1 1 octroi n f and the maximum tariff which they contem plate* The Board assume that the octroi duties would be levied on articles of native origin as well as on those imported. With respect to the counter-concessions which* w as indicated in the second paragraph of this letter, the Board are of opinion might properly be sought from the Turkish Government, the Board are not in a position to offer any observations on proposals (l) to (4) put forward by Mr. darling. As regards the contracts for the Mesopotamian irrigation works, however, it appears from enquiries they have caused to be made that the British firms of Messrs. 3. Pearson and Bon, Limited and Sir John Jackson, Limited were the only firms that were willing to tender for the contracts offered by the Turkisl Government, and that although they ultimatelyultimately found themselveB unable to agi'ee to certain of the financial arrangements proposed and the matter is accordingly in abeyance at present, one firm (Messrs* S. Pearson and Bon) has spent large sums in tho preparation of estimates and surveys and the other (Bir John Jackson, Limited) has also incurred ; re- liminary expenditure of this kind and is, moreover, at present engaged on the Hindis barrage* In these circumstances the firms have, in the opinion of the Board, established a preferential claim to such con tracts as may be awarded for the irrigation works by the Ottoman Government, and might properly receive the active support of His Majesty*s Government. The board recognise that it might be inadvisable to stipulate for the immediate allocation to British firms of the contract for the whole undertaking, but as the work will no doubt be carried out in sections they think it might be stipulated that contracts for the earlier sections involving expenditure up to a certain amount should be given to one or both oi the British firms, and that ail subsequent contracts should be put up to open tender. Should Bir E. Grey concur in this view.the Board will he glad to consult with the firms in question with a view to fixing a reasonable propor** tion of the work to be assigned to them. Finally, as regards oil, the Board, as Indicated above, are of opinion that Hakki Basha should be inform ed that the decision of His Majesty's Government on the question of the proposed monopoly will depend largely upon the settlement of the matter of the Mesopotamian Oil Concession. Should a satisfactory solution of that problem be reached, it is possible that the Anglo-Persian Company, which would have the sole right of marketing in Asiatic Turkey would readily enter into arrangements with the holders of any concessions which might be obtained in Syria and the Parson Islands. A further letter on the subject of these latter concessions will be addressed to you shortly. I have &amp;c., (Signed) H.

It will he v/ithin the recollection of Sir Arthur Hirtzel that during the recent negotiations Halcki Pasha made a desultory remark to the effect that he supposed eventually the blue line, which is indicated on annex' No.5a of the convention signed on July 29th. last, would be extended to the Aden boundary. Sir E. Grey is anxious, if possible, to confine the counter-concessions, which His Majesty’s Government should request from the Ottoman Government in return for the further concessions which Turkey now desires, to commercial ones; but he is prepared, if the Secretary Oie Under Secretary of State India Office.Secretary of State for India so desires, to make an attempt to get the Ottoman Government to agree to the line from the Ruba-al-Khaila being prolonged to the Men boundary. There may be advantage in this, as possibly the Hadramaut and adjoining regions contain oil deposits, and, on the conclusion of an arrangement with Prance about Muscat, they might become places of refuge for the arms traffic; but before expressing any final opinion upon the question Sir E.

Following are my observations on draft declaration proposed by Hakki : Section 1, paragraph 1. Except in matches, we are at present but little interested in any of articles mentioned. Paragraphs 2-4. Method proposed is unsatisfactory, as it would not secure to British trade share in any future increase in import trade, lairer method would, perhaps, be to base British share on relative percentage—to be determined each year of the total annual imports of the articles in which we are or may be interested.

I request that you will state whether His Majesty s Government might suitably ask for a prolongation of the Smyrna-Aidin Railway concession in return for agreeing to these points or any of them.

Following are my observations on draft declaration proposed by Hakki : Section 1, paragraph 1. Except in matches, we are at present but little interested in any of articles mentioned. Paragraphs 2-4. Method proposed is unsatisfactory, as it would not secure to British trade share in any future increase in import trade. Fairer method would, perhaps, be to base British share on relative percentage—to be determined each year— of the total annual imports of the articles in which we are or may be interested. With development of Persian oilfields Anglo-Persian Oil Company will acquire considerable interests in export of petroleum to Basra and Bagdad (they have already applied for permission to erect tanks at Bagdad). Should this company eventually obtain concession of Mesopotamian oilfield they will also become oil producers in this country. Establishment of monopolies, especially petroleum monopoly, will have to be very carefully considered in view of the fact that Russian, American, and German- Dutch oil producers are already largely interested in petroleum trade with this country, whilst British interests in that article at present are [group omitted : ? not], but may become important. . Alternative proposed by Hakki Pasha for imposition of “ droit de consommation ” means practicallv imposition of customs surtax over and above increased customs duty of 4 per cent. Of the two this seems to be the least objectionable proposal, for it will allow complete freedom of importation, and it will, provided that surtax be reasonable, allow of natural expansion of trade. We should, however, reserve right to fix maximum limit if not actual rate of surtax m case of each aiticle. I would point out that “ droit de consommation/’ if not levied equally on articles of local oiigin, might be used to enhance protection already secured by import duties. } Section 1, paragraph 5. In this connection, I presume, His Majesty s Government would insist on clear statement that recent renewal of lighthouse concession will not prejudice agreement according to which tariff is to be revised in 1919 in older to establish dues from 1924 onwards. This might also be suitable occasion for putting on record principle that future dues shall not exceed amount necessary for maintenance of lighthouse service (see Sir G. Lowther’s despatches Nos. 7o and 110, Commercial). Section 2. Proposal to allow Public Debt Administration to exercise direct control over British business establishments is open to grave objection. Permit for any Ottoman authority to interfere directly with British firms m their places of business would involve serious departure from Capitulations, and would be [group undecyphei- able] with greatest repugnance by British subjects^ Apart from renunciation of treaty rights involved, it would also mean subordinate officials of Debt on whose discietion no reliance could be placed, would have access to confidential papers o a m s. Difficulties were felt so strongly in 1906 that we reserved the question of allowing inquisitional visits, even with consular assistance. Present proposal seems to exc uc e such assistance, ami, if it were accepted, attempts even might be made to exclude me sufficiently explicit for this purpose. . n o-rpntpqt Section 3.

In September and October 1905 the Shaxbi country up to Waal Bam was surveyed by British and Turkish / Commissioners, and a line apreed to and demarcated, ire protocol of settlement, with map, was sent home by Colonel Wahab, British Commissioner, in. his No. 537 October 80th 190.3 (Communicated to Foreign Office bv India Office November 3rd, 1903). This Protocol ^, VPg . of J-he toij.ndu^y by the ni,:rnbfc rs 1 to 16. Demarcation of the Amiri country v/as begun by the Joint Commissioners in October 1903, doubtful points as they arose being settle a by negotiations with Constantinople, and. was completed towards the end of December. In January and February of the following year (1904) the Haushabi territory was dealt with by the Joint Commission. Protocols anc mats as regards Amiri and part of Haushabi were furnished in Colonel Wahab’s Nos. IP and 19, March 15tn, 1904 (corriuu/ucuoea by India Office March list, 1904), and those relative to the settlement in respect of Haushabi and Subaihi to Has Iraf were sent home in his No. 45 June 11th,1904 (Corrnunicu^ed by India Office July 13th, 1904). fhe boundary settled by the protocols in the first despatch is describ ed by the numbers 16 to 44. and the boundary settled by the protocols enclosed in the latter despatch is described bv the numbers 45 to 64 . The worK of demarcation was continued and on April noth, 1905 a protocol was signed settling the boundary as far as Husn tfurad. This section is described by the nurnlers 65 to 73 . It will be seen from the foregoing that the boundary delimited by the Joint Commission extended from points described by the numbers i to 73 . that is to say from Wadi Lana to Husn 'urad, a distance of y- nearly 200 miles. As the protocol of April 20th, 1905, which deals with one section G-) to 73) of this frontier, is to be ratified, it certainly seems advisable to make a com plete job and to ratify at the same time the protocols of 1903 and 1904. Hakki Pasha m his note of the 5th instant (50450/13), refers only to the earlier protocol of 1903 (section 1 to 16 ) and seems to have overlooked the protocols of 1904 (sections 16 to 44Aa regards daicki Pushup request for copies of thu protocols a ad rnaps, I undersDaiid that the India Office have, no copies available, so they would probably have to bo obtained from India.

Included in this correspondence are observations made by the Viceroy of India, representing the views of the Government of India on the Aden frontier question; and discussions with the War Office, London, and the Ordnance Survey Office, Southampton, about the reproduction of the Aden boundary protocols and maps in connection with the ratification process. The volume includes two, mainly French versions of the Aden Boundary Protocols of 1903, 1904 and 1905, jointly signed by Colonel R A Wahab and Colonel Moustapha Remzi Bey, the respective British and Ottoman boundary commissioners, together with two War Office maps dated 1906 and 1914, showing the Aden Protectorate boundary line and on the earlier map, tribal names and boundaries. There are also printed copies in French of a draft version (signed and dated 13 February 1914) and final version (signed and dated 9 March 1914) of the Anglo-Ottoman convention on the Aden frontier, in which both governments agreed to exchange instruments of ratification in London within three months.The volume also contains less extensive correspondence about the commercial proposal (in French) dated 31 July 1913, drafted by Ibrahim Hakki Pasha, the chief Ottoman negotiator in London. This correspondence includes detailed observations made by the British Chargé d’Affaires at Constantinople [Istanbul] and the Board of Trade in London, about the further trade concessions in Persian Gulf countries sought by the Imperial Ottoman Government.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Robert Alexander Wahab</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Moustapha Remzi</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ordnance Survey Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Trade agreements</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>War Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Board of Trade</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to the Ottoman Empire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Ibrahim Hakki Pasha</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Tribes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00012e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
