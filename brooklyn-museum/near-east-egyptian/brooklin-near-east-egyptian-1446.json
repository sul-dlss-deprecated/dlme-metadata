The bed stands under a canopy supported by poles. The artist has had some difficulty in showing the servant behind the poles of the canopy: his body cuts over them and vice versa. Fragment d is decorated with a representation of a doorway (?) to the left of which are offerings consisting mainly of vases and furniture.\r\n\r\nCondition:  Surface worn; chips and scratches in various places.", "medium": "Limestone", "dimensions": "17 x 1 3/16 x 36 3/4 in.
