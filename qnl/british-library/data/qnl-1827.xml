The Chief of the General Staff. Debai. — 24th December 1910. No. 273—6. H. M. S. “Hyacinth” at Debai, Sir, 31st December 1910. I have the honour to make the following report regarding the fi^htin' which took place at Dehai on 24th December 1910. 2 . On arrival at Debai on the afternoon of Friday, 23rd December, to visit the 1st Pinnace stationed there, it was reported to me by the boat officer (Lieutenant Cyril John Laugham Noakes, R. N.) that, suspecting arms to be concealed in a certain house, he had on Tuesday, 20th instant, called on the Shaikh to search this house in his presence. The Shaikh demurred and put difficulties in the way, but after a delay of over an hour, went to the house with Lieutenant Noakes, After further delays, during which he was kept outside, Lieutenant Noakes was admitted by the Shaikh, a perfunctory search was made and nothing found. Subsequently, information reached Lieutenant Noakes that the arms had been removed elsewhere during the various delays, and the informer (a house hold slave named Sultan) stated that he knew their new place of concealment. Other information pointed to a second consignment being stowed in the house of one Ahmed. Information had also reached me from an Arab merchant, who had recently emigrated from Debai to Ajman, that arms are hidden in Debai. 3. It appeared evident that, notwithstanding recent warnings the Shaikh if not absolutely in collusion with arms smugglers, was, at any rate, taking no steps to carry out his treaty obligations. ' * ° For this reason, and having in mind your general instructions that contra band arms at Debai must be seized either with or without the Shaikh’s assist ance, and being in possession of categorical information of the existence of such arms, 1 decided that it was my duty to endeavour to find them and that the only prospect of success lay in immediate action. Being quite aware that the business was not free from risk, I decided to land with a strong armed party, and, if possible, to arrange for the Shaikh to accompany me, without, however, giving him previous notice of the objective. I, therefore, sent Lieutenant Noakes to his station in the Khor, directing him to take a message to the Shaikh that I desired to see him on urgent35 business and requested him to meet me at 6-15 the following morning (Saturday) at his house. 4 I left the ship at 5-30 a.m. on Saturday with a force of about 100 officers and men (details of force are given in Enclosure 1). I reached the Shaikh’s house shortly before 6-15, and was informed by Lieutenant ISoakes that he had personally been to the Shaikh’s house at 5 A M., had not seen the Shaikh, but had seen his father, who said that the Shaikh would not meet me as requested. 5 As it was necessary to act at once, if there were to be any chance of securing the arms, I marched immediately Sketch No. i. Not received. to tiie h 0Use indicated by the informer, (Thalyfa’s house), and proceeded to search it. Finding some arms buried in the floor of a room, I left Major Heriot, with the Marines^ Lieutenant Noakes and seamen, to continue the search, and proceeded myself, with Lieutenant Adam s party to Ahmed s house, airivin a there about 7-30 a.m. 6 . There were armed men on the roof of this house, who fired some shots at us as we approached. I returned the fire, forced an entrance, and found the owner in the court-yard. His men then discontinued firing. I placed guards on the roof and outside, and commenced searching the place, which comprised several separate houses, connected hy walls, with two court-yards. About 8 a.m., the Shaikh of Debai arrived, with about a dozen retainers. He acquiesced in the search, which continued for perhaps another 20 minutes and was then discontinued, owing to a threatening mob of Arabs assembling in our vicinity. Shortly before this and while things were still quiet, Lieutenant Adam had sent three men to ascertain whether Major Heriot had returned to the beach. 7. About 8-20, there was an organised outbreak of firing directed at Lieutenant Adam's party, also as subsequently ascertained, at the three men referred to above, and at the boats. At Ahmed’s house, the mob in the open was dispersed by a couple of volleys from Lieutenant Adam’s party, but a desultory fire was maintained at us from the adjoining houses and huts and from the fepit on the opposite side of the Creek. From this position there were also occasional volleys. When the firing slackened, I withdrew all Lieutenant Adam’s party into the court-yard of Ahmed’s house, where good protection was obtainable. 8 . I then (about 8-45) requested the Shaikh to cause the attack on our men to cease. He agreed to do this and despatched emissaries. Intermittent firing continued however till about 10 o’clock, when I heard the ship firing heavy guns. Thereafter, with the exception of some sniping and an occasional fusillade, maters quieted down v ery much. Whether this was due to the Shaikh’s pacificatory action or to the ship firing, is uncertain. I think, principally the latter, ^t ail events so far as concerns the people who were attackins Major Heriot. But, it the Shaikh had adopted a personally hostile attitude, we must have sustained very heavy cas ual tics. While at Ahmed’s house, I succeeded in exchanging messages with Major Heriot; and heard that he was in position on the beach. Though anxious to make a junction with him, it was certain that the effort would result in heavy casualties to whichever party moved. I therefore, decided to remain separated, to keep a tight hold on the Shaikh, and to use his influence for all it was worth in the extrication of both parties.36 In pursuance of this policy, I proposed to the Shaikh that he and I should march side by side to his house, followed by his retainers and Lieutenant Adam’s party. This seemed to promise the best security against attack, and was carried ^ out, leaving Ahmad’s house about 10'?0. After marching a couple of hundred yards, and while halting to pick up the body of Honeywood, able seaman, fire was opened on us but without doing any damage, and was soon discontinued. At about 10-40, we reached the Shaikh’s house and remained there till about 12-30. During this time, I got messages through to Major Heriot of the situation, and I told him either to come to Shaikh’s house or to embark, as he might find most easy. He succeeded in embarking without molestation. At 12-30 p.m., I embarked with Lieutenant Adam’s party, the Shaikh accompanying us to the boats, a large armed mob lining the beach. The populace was then under perfect control, not a shot being fired, and we returned to the ship without further incident. 9. Returning to the proceedings of Major Heriot— He had (about 8-30) quitted Thalyfa’s house on hearing the firing near Ahmed’s house. His intention was to join me, but being uncertain of the direction, he found himself on the beach, after haying to fight his way along streets. In traversing the streets, he became separated from Lieutenant Noakes and some of the party. Lieutenant IN oakes’s detachment, after a good deal of street fighting, reached the beach first. Finding a solitary seamen (able seaman Williams) under a heavy fire, trying to obtain cover behind a fishing boat, moored a little distance from the shore, Lieutenant Noakes took up a position on the beach in order to extricate this man. Major Heriot arrived shortly after, joined Lieutenant Noakes and re assumed command of the combination. In this way Major Heriot became committed to a very exposed position on sketch No. 2 . (Not receiTed.) the sands, which he maintained till firing had ceasec., some two hours later. He dug himself into the sand as far as possible, but was under a heavy fire at short range from behind dhows and from housetops and windows in his front and on both flanks, and sustained a good many casualties. He succeeded in rescuing able seaman Williams (previously mentioned). At about 9-30, having established signal communication with the ship, Major Heriot was able to indicate the direction in which she could safely fire. As a result, two 6-inch shells were fired about 10 o’clock, at a position on his left flank, whence he was much harrassed. This gave relief. Another two shells fired about 10-20, had a further beneficial effect and enabled the Whaler with Fleet Surgeon Munday and first aid to approach the beach, without being subjected to a heavy fire. About 11 o’clock, all was quiet. Major Heriot’s party and the wounded were taken off to the ship without molestation. With regard to the work on board the ship, I consider that the Command- sketch No. a. (Notreceived) ing Officer, Commander C. E. Leggett, showed very good judgment, both in opening and ceasing fire from the ship and in the sending in of medical assistance. Quite rightly he did not open fire till he knew the location of the shore parties, and equally rightly declined to permit Fleet Surgeon Munday (the only medical officer available) to land until the situation was moderately safe.37 10. After the party had landed, the boats (1st and 2nd Cutters, and skiff), made fast astern of the Pinnace, which had anchored overnight abreast the Shaikh’s house, about 40 yards from the beach. Mr. Georcre Griffin (Boatswain) with 18 petty officers and men, remained in charge of the boats. About 8--0, at the same time as other parties were attacked, a heavy fire from both sides of the Klior, was opened on the boats. They replied with the Pinnace’s 3-pounder and with rifle fire, but any man showing himself above the gunwale of the boats, was immediately made the target for a concentrated fire. Several men were killed and wounded in attempting to work the Pinnace’s 3 -pounder and Cutters’ maxims, and these guns were soon silenced. In this connection, I would draw attention to the absence of gun shields. They were abolished some years ago, but would certainly have been useful on this occasion. 11 I have pleasure in reporting the excellent conduct of all ranks and ratings throughout the affair. The general demeanour was cool and courageous. I neither saw, nor have since heard of, a single instance of shirking. On the other hand, many cases have come to my notice of individuals who were conspicuous above the ordinary— Major Granville Mnckay Ileri 't, R.M.L.I, was chiefly instrumental in rescuing able seamen David Charles Williams, O.N.J. 836, who was wounded and up to his neck in the sea. On being approached by Major Heriot and told to come ashore, Williams did so and then collapsed. Major lleriot then called for volunteers to carry Williams This was responded to by— Ch/15178 Private Archibald James Hallam, R.M.L.I. Po/14j180 Private Erederick James Sandham, R.M.L.I. Po/15174 Private Richard George Hall, R.M L.I. Po/13938 Private David George Davies, R.M.L.I. Major Heriot and this party succeeded in bringing Williams into moderate safety under fire, during which Williams received his 7th wound. Lieutenant Cyril John Lavgham ftoakes, L.N., after fighting his way to the beach, si owed prompt decision in taking up a position to cover and draw the fire off Williams, whom he found wounded and isolated in the sea. Lieuten ant Noakes showed an excellent example of courage to his men and was largely responsible for keeping down the enemy’s fire on the north flank, although to do so he had to place himself in a very exposed position. Lieutenant Herbert Reginald Brewery R.M.L.I.y did excellent work throughout. At great risk to himself, he rendered first aid to the wounded, entirely exposing himseif in so doing. Lieutenant Lionel Stewart Moncrieffe Adam, R.N.y who was with me throughout, showed up extremely well as a cool and courageous leader. When at the Shaikh’s house I told him that I wanted a volunteer to take a message to Major Heriot, who was then isolated on the beach, Lieuten ant Adam immediately offered to go himself. The fact that I did not select him, does not detract from his merit in volunteering for a dangerous service. Fleet Surgeon Richard Cleveland Mundayy R.N.y has shown himself to be most zealous and competent in emergency. He pressed to be allowed to land while the fire was heavy; eventually did so and assisted the wounded under fire, and has since been unremitting in his attention to them. Chief Yeoman of Signals, John Vincer, O. N. 148134, showed very cool courage in maintaining signal communication between Major Heriot and the ship. He was required to carry out this duty fairly continuously from 9-25 till 10-35, under fire and necessarily standing up absolutely exposed, while working the Morse flag. He was well assisted by Leading Signalman Thomas Charles Willcox, O. N. 232188 and by Po 7086 Corporal Erederick Aloysius Callaram, R. M. L. I., in this dangerous duty.33 Able Seamen William John Anderson^ O.N.J. 918, distinguished himself by his initiative, coolness, and courage. Being armed with a pistol only, he asked permission to take the rifle of a wounded man and for two hours maintained a steady fire on a window commanding our position. Durin' the rescue of able seaman Williams, Anderson was extremely plucky in dashing. into the open, clear of our position, in order to cover the rescuing party by rifle fire. In doing this, he exposed himself to great danger. Leading Signalman Alfred Thomas Woods, O. N. 236229, after being seriously wounded in the head and neck, was called upon to make a signal. He behaved very bravely in making several attempts to carry out this duty under a heavy fire. Petty Officer Herbert Stafford, O. N. 184057, after being seriously wouded while working the maxim in the cutter, came into the Pinnace and endeavoured to work the 3-pounder, but was compelled to desist by loss of blood. Able Seaman Edwin Hailstone, O N. S. S. 1692. After one man had been killed and another wounded in attempting to work a maxim in the cutter. Hailstone came into the cutter from the gig and made further attempts to work the gun. AbE Seaman John Skene, O. N. 132381, was conspicuous in working the 3-pounder in the Pinnace until it was damaged by the enemy’s fire. He was well backed up by Able Seaman Charles Monk, O. N. 204602 and by Able Seaman Frederick Robert Yellop. 0. N. 239686, the latter having succumbed to wounds received while carrying out this duty. Able Seaman Louis Bobert Trimmer, O. N. 238633. Petty Officer Charles Anderson Fowler, 0. N. 165323. Leading Seaman Arthur William Mehpham, 0. N. 214568. Volunteers were called for to take a message from the Shaikh’s house to Major Heriot’s position, a highly dangerous service. The above men volun teered in the order stated. Fowler was also conspicuous in the performance of his duties under fire as Section Leader. Able Seaman Robert Oliver Uoneywood, 0. N. 198481, lost his life in attempting to establish communication between two detached parties. Being attacked by Arabs, although there was a chance of retreat, he held his ground and returned their fire till killed. Able Seamen John Mardon, O. N. 191685 and William Henry Shepherd, O. N. 211107, volunteered to accompany Honeywood in getting ^ touch with the detached party. Moussa Mubrook, Head Tindal, volunteered to take a message under fire from Ahmed’s house to Major Heriot. He showed much courage throughout the affair. Sergeant Charles Ludivico Williams, Ch 6802 (the Senior Sergeant of the R. M. Detachment) carried out his work most satisfactorily. I wish to recommend him for the Colours. Private Ernest George Peakes, Po 9666, deserves recognition for the able assistance given to Lieutenant Noakes, while that officer was separated from Major Heriot. He was wounded, while exposing himself in an endeavour to dig a trench for his section. Chief Petty Officer Harry James Cox, O. N. 160117, showed great cool ness and was of much assistance to Lieutenant Adam. Able Seamen Norman Herbert Smith, O. N. 207575 ; John Flynn, O. N. 156573; William Arthur Goodman, J. 865; and Pt'ivate William Henry Geater, P M.L.I., Ch 14542; were conspicuous by their dash, coolness, and accuracy of fire. I have, &amp;c., J. D. Dick, Captain.

He arrived after some delay and was received by the Resident and myself in my cabin. His explanation and statements were quite at variance with the reports of our own officers, and were evidently fabricated to put the best appearance he could upon his acts The Shaikh is a weak man who has not any control over his people, and experience shows that, while apparently usually willing to comply with demands so long as the Resident or one of His Majesty’s ships remains present, he is always forced by his people to evade them when the pressure has been taken off. 3. After considerable discussion we came to the conclusion that reliance could not be placed upon the Shaikh’s statements, and we decided to issue an ultimatum to him (Enclosure No. 1) and to give him 48 hours from 9 A.M., on 29th December within which to comply. 4 . On the morning of the 30th December, hearing that the Shaikhs of Shargah and Um-el-Kawain were at Debai, the Resident sent a message, asking them to come off and see him. They were received by us in my cabin and the whole situation was explained to them. The Shaikh of Shargah was the spokesman and tried by every argument in his power to induce us to forego some of the demands put forward. The Shaikhs were afterwards taken round the ship and shown the men at their guns and the ammunition up, ready to begin a bombardment of the town on the following morning. This, more than anything else, impressed upon them the fact that it was not intended to abate our demands. B. Soon after the Shaikhs of Shargah and Um-el-Kawain had landed, the Residency Agent came off with a letter from the Shaikh of Debai (Enclo sure No. 2), acceeding to the terms. With regard to the statement therein that the men belonging to the “ Hyacinth’s ” boat used to bathe and walk about naked amongst the people on the shore, I may mention that I have enquired into the matter and find it to be quite untrue. A letter was accord ingly sent to the Shaikh (Enclosure No. 3), and he was directed to come on board at 9 A.M. on Saturday, 31st December. The “ Eox ” and Royal Indian Marine ship “ Minto ”, were already at Debai, and the “ Philomel ” and Royal Indian Marine ship “ Lawrence ” arrived during the night. 6 . On the morning of 31st December it was blowing a fresh “ Shamal ” (N.-W.) right on to the beach. So much surf was running on the bar that it was dangerous to come out, and the Shaikh sent a letter to the Resident, saying that it was not safe to send the money. Under the circumstances, it was agreed that he should take it to the “ Eox ‘* directly after the weather had moderated. I then proceeded to Bushire in the “ Hyacinth ” with the Resident on board, and left Captain A. T. Hunt of the “ Eox ” at Debai to finish up the affair. ,v ’ ,, . it j s stated in the Gazetteer that from 1,500 to 2,000 armed men are in Debai, but it appears as if the majority of the male population, which is in excess of this number, are armed with modern rifles. Only some 300 of. these men form the intractable section, and they mainly consist of the Shaikh’s rela tions and hangers-on. When an Arab possesses a small bore rifle, a soft-nosed expanding bullet is used, as he considers that the solid nickel-cased bullet is not of any use, because it will not stop a man. Nearly all the Hyacinth s wounded men were hit with soft-nosed bullets. 8 . Besides these, every Persian in the town appeared to possess a good rifle and plenty of ammunition. I understand that it is chiefly the Persians who import arms into Debai: they do so in small quantities as often as oppor tunity offers, trusting to getting them away again to the Persian coast in the same manner. These Persians, although armed, may be considered as a negli gible quantity where fighting is concerned. 9 The principal point to be considered, however, is that plenty of arms and ammunition are in Debai for the use of all who are capable of firing a rifle I am therefore, of opinion that, if these people are to be again coerced, it would be advisable tp have a military force at hand of at least 1,000 men, including artillery and sappers, with which to occupy the town. A simple bombardment42 without land operations afterwards has very rarely reduced a resolute enemy to submission, and it has almost invariably become necessary at some time or other afterwards to land in order to force him to submit. 10. The whole of the pearling fleet, consisting of some 335 dhows, comd C easily be destroyed, and given time the greater part of the town of Debai could be demolished by His Majesty’s ships, but the loss of life on shore would probably be very small, as the inhabitants could escape into the adjoining desert without difficulty. It is very doubtful, however, whether the Arab would be forced by these measures to give in, and if he did not submit, all that would have been accomplished would be the destruction of a town and industry which it is to our advantage to maintain. 11. After consideration of the whole incident, I must state my opinion that tlie conduct of both officers and men of the “ Hyacinth ” was extremely creditable, but that the operations were somew-hat hastily undertaken without paying sufficient consideration to the prejudices and ideas of an oriental people. I have now given orders which 1 hope will prevent a repetition of such action without reference being first made either to myself, to the Senior JSaval Officer in the Persian Gulf, or to the Political Kesident at Bushire. 12 . I consider that the whole course of events, since we have been obliged to pay attention to the Trucial coast on account of the arms traffic emphasises the necessity of stationing a British Political Officer on the coast. * I have, &amp;c., E.

I am unaware whether your telegram* No. 23 S. was despatched before or •serial No. 46. after perusal of my lettert No. 6 A, dated ^ tserial No. 44 . 2 nd January. The Shaikh of Debai has duly carried out accepted conditions so far as he can at present; that is to sa y» he has handed over rifles demanded and Rs. 50,000 and, in concert with Senior Naval Officer, has both re-erected tide pole in a more convenient place and selected site for telegraph installation and quarters in case Government should decide to proceed with it. The prospect of acceptance of telegraph was included in the ultimatum, as Shaikh’s refusal constituted a breach of treaty, but reservations were attached both to this demand and to references to Post Office* and British Agent which leave Government free to proceed with these measures or not, as or when they please. I considered all three items as administrative necessities just as much as political compensation. In spite of frequent visits and friendly efforts and advice on my part, the position has remained precisely as I described it on page 7 of printed administration report for 1906-07 ; while the need for advance has been much emphasised in the meantime by the entry of English, French and German merchants into trade of the coast, and now by the latest development of the arms traffic. Reports received by Admiral by wireless telegraph up to his departure on 10th January, show that the position at Behai and on the coast generally gave no cause for anxiety, and as there is no specific point needing immediate orders of Government : Serial No. J7. future action can be deliberately consider ed. My written reply to your telegram { S—3 will reach you on 16th January. The recent occurrence was of course unlucky, and we may have to face newspaper mispresentation, but I do not expect any hostile development on the coast itself, and my present opinion is that the administrative measures proposed are an urgent necessity, and that if we intend to maintain a firm hold on the coast and justify our position as protecting Power, we should carry them through in spite of any opposition that may be offered. The backward conditions which recent incident indicates seem to afford ample justification, and if we fail to undertake measures now we shall later on have a great deal of difficulty in doing so. 55 Telegram P., No. 35, dated (and received) the 12th January 1911. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To - The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. Admiral telegraphs as follows, dated 12th January :— Begins. The situa tion on the Trucial coast is quiet. The Shaikh of Debai is friendly, but is disturbed, because inhabitants are leaving Debai; by last mail 150 left for Bandar Abbas and more are said to intend leaving next week. I do not suppose this will mean more than a temporary abandonment of the town, as people will probably all return next pearl season. Ends. The inhabitants who are leaving for Bandar Abbas are doubtless members of Persian community in whose hands mainly lies the heavy smuggling trade to Persian coast in arms and highly taxed articles. Our supervision of outgoing dhows has probably hit them, and when ships leave their return may be expected.59 No. 222—1462 XIV N., dated Debai, the 28th December 1910.

In continuation of my letter * No. 207—1462 XIV N. of the 29th Nov- * Serial No 2 . ember 1910, forwarding a report of the destruction of two dhows engaged in the arms traffic, be pleased to lay before His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council the enclosed copy of a letter from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, reporting the burning of two more dhows.45 ( / ( Dhows engaged in the arms traffic. H. M. S. “ Fox ” at Jask, 29th November 1910. Sir, I have the honour to report that a dhow owned h 7 Chotak and Mugdis was burnt at Galeg on 26th November under the following circumstances. 2 . She was reported to have leftMaskat on 2nd November with arms for the neighbourhood of Galeg, she was searched at sea without result by “ Proserpine ” and, without being recognised, w T ent into Galeg in company with another dhow whose Nakhoda’s name was Gazook. 3. Shortly after their arrival, Gumbley reported that Gazook had thrown overboard 150 rifles and 20,000 rounds: as he was an old offender, I sent “ Proserpine ” in to get further evidence and detain Gazook. The sail and rudder of the dhow were also to be seized to prevent her leaving till the matter was cleared up. 4. On “ Proserpine’s ” arrival, the crew of the other dhow ran away and “ Proserpine ” burnt her without orders or proof of guilt. During the burning, however, a lot of cartridges exploded thus proving her guilt. 5. It has now been ascertained that she was reported as having left Maskat on 2nd November with arms, but the wrong name was given, owing to two Nakhodas being in partnership. 6 . “Proserpine” now has Nakhoda Gazook and his crew on board, endeavouring to get more evidence against him ; he has at least three previous offences. 7. With your approval, I propose to burn his dhow and detain him for the present, releasing the remainder of the crews. A. T. Hunt, To His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief. Captain. ii.

From—L iet tenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox. C.S.I., C.I.E., Polit cal Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to the question of the traffic in arms from the Trucinl x ^ j i. j 1.1 n k nQ1A Coast, I have the honour to forward, for Tto. C.—79, dated the 20th December 1910. xi • ^ ’ the information of the Government of India, a copy of a letter received from the Political Agent, Kuwait, iu which he communicates reports received by him on that subject. No. C.—79, dated Kuwait, the 20th December 1910 (Confidential). From Captain W. H. I. Shakespear. Politic d Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to submit the following information which I have obtained from various sources as to the present course of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf. 2. Since His Majesty’s Ships have practically closed the traffic by sea from Maskat to the ports on the Baluchistan and Persian coasts, it appears that enterprising dealers have evolved another means of exit. One method is to load up camels with arms and ammunition at Matrah and send them overland to the Pirate coast, where from ports, such as Abu Thabi, Shargah and Debai, &amp;c , the arms are shipped by native craft to the Persian littoral and to Katar. I am told that there is a continual stream of caravans between Hebai and the hinterland of Maskat conveying rice from the former place, that formerly these caravans had to make the journey one way without loads, but that now they profit by carrying arms to the Pirate Coast and return with rice. Another method and that employed from the Batineh Coast ports such as Sohar, Shinas, &amp;c., is for several boats to sail together, only one of which will be carrying contraband whilst the others reconnoitre for His Majesty’s Ships. As soon as a war-vessel is sighted the boat with arms at once takes shelter m one of the numerous deep bays, whilst the others begin fishing until the opportunity offers of proceeding further north. The same method is resorted to as often as a vessel is sighted until the boat with the arms has succeeded in working her way far enough round Musandim Peninsula to have a fairly clear run for a Persian port west of Lingah or the Katar coast. 3. Prom what I hear in Kuwait it seems that the Katar coast is now the principal distributing centre for arms, certainly for Arabia and largely for the Persian ports also. I am told that the firm of Goguyer efc Cie has a depot in Katar (presumably at Doha or Wakra) at which two large boat-loads of arms and ammunition were recently landed with an Arab Agent in charge.* These boats, secure from molestation by flying Prench colours, carried very heavy carriages of arms. That there is some truth in the report is evidenced by recent information that a caravan conveying 400 rifles with their usual proportion of ammunition from Katar to Riadh for Bin Sand was waylaid by the Al-Morrad Eedouin and looted of the entire consignment. 4. I cannot well check this information in Kuwait, but have heard substantially the same details from several persons and perhaps the Political Agents at Bahrain and Maskat maybe able to corroborate; i am therefore sending copies of this letter direct to those officers.&lt;“S • 47 62 No. 87, dated Bushire, the 8th (receiv?d 17th) January 1911, From— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Guld, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to reply, in amplification of my ad interim message* of • Serial No. 39 . 6th instant, to Foreign Department tele- t Se-iai No. 27 . gram+No. S.—3, dated 3rd January, on the subject of the action recently taken at Debai. I beg leave to discuss the several points touched upon in the latter com munication, in the order of allusion. 2. The search took place without the presence of the Shaikh. —This is the case ; hut it must he remembered that on the last occasion on which the Shaikh’s presence and co-operation were asked for, they were only forthcoming in a way calculated to defeat the object in view and to make any search abortive. In the present instance, Captain Dick believed that he had given the Shaikh every opportunity of being present; and even if it be true that, as the Shaikh asserts, no message reached him overnight regarding the contemplated landing, it cannot reasonably be supposed that the Shaikh received no message from, or news of, Captain Dick’s party in the morning, and knew nothing of the landing of 100 men within a stone’s throw and within sight of his dwelling, at the time, or until so long afterwards as to prevent his joining the party for nearly two hours. That the action of the Captain of H. M. S. “ Hyacinth ” was prudent, I | am not prepared to maintain. Captain Dick indeed realised that he was taking considerable risk, but thought it was one which the circumstances warranted him in taking. The chances of trouble were, however, undoubtedly great and to one more familiar, as I am, with Arab character and oriental prejudice generally, would have seemed to amount almost to a certainty. But, on the other hand, the Shaikh’s contributory negligence was patent, and to have overlooked the fact and to have admitted, in spite of the Shaikh’s supine attitude, that the action of the Commander of His Majesty’s ship was unjustified, would have had the effect of preventing us fr m taking any notice of the incident, a course which in my judgment would have been in the highest decree prejudicial to our interests in the Gulf, and would greatly have weakened the hands and damped the initiative of all the Commanders of His Majesty’s ships in these waters, engaged as they now are, on highly responsible and difficult duties in connection with the arms blockade. 3. Some of the conditions imposed. Such as the imposition of a fine of 50&gt;000 rupees seem to the Government of India onerous. The four conditions which we called upon the Shaikh to comply with within 48 hours were— (i) Replacement of tide pole. (ii) Acceptation of Telegraph installation as required by treaty, when ever desired by the Government of India. (iii) Delivery of 400 serviceable rifles. (iv) Delivery of 50,000 rupees pending reference to Government, with possibility of restoration in the event of compliance with two other conditions, or retention as a fine, as the Government might decide. I submit that (i) and (ii) could hardly be considered onerous under any circumstances. As regards the 400 rifles the position was this. The recent incident had demonstrated the fact that practically every adult in the town, except the British Indians, was possessed of a rifle and cartridges, including the large community (between 200 and 300) of Persian shopkeepers, who are supposed to be men of peace and not to need them and whom the Residency Agent was much surprised to find, for the first time, fully armed. It is undoubtedly these4 A* 48 petty shopkeeper hailing from Lingah, Lar, and Bastak, whom we are indebted Truciaf rm’T n Tf r 0 r^ 0 S T e traffi ° “ Sma11 consi ? nf ««ts of arms from the W, »fi C f' m ?' d n0t Seem an onerous condition to ask the Shaikh to ?, fi ° f a ' flK irora a ver y sma11 proportion of those who had so freely used them against our men. As a matter of fact, however, the Shaikh’s autl.o'- y u ,s not sufficient to enable him to confiscate more than 300 weapons and for the rest he substituted cash at the rate of 100 rupees per rifle. ., ^ , ' e s,,m of ,, 50 i 0 ?, 0 ' vas scgSested by me to the Admiral as a suit able figure with full knowledge of the Shaikh’s financial position and of the extent to ' Inch he would be able to levy contribution from his notables and subjects The Shaikh accepted this condition so promptly that I was rather inclined to think that he was prepared for a higher figure. . p u any oase , it wil1 b ® realised from the terms of my letters to the Shaikh that Government are not committed in regard to the disposal of this amount and I may add that it was my hope that Government would decide to authorise 111 tv 1 le that they felt it nece.ssary to press the installation of a British Agent and a Post Office and to ad.i that If he met thffir wthef whicn were for the good of his town and himself, in a tractable way, the money fine would be refunded to him. J ^ une .... 4 - fff Government of India should have been consulted as to the con- dihonsof the ultimatum —\have the honour to ex plain that His Exceilenc v the Commander-In-Chief and I left for Behai at very short notice, and tlfa t was only on the way thither that we learnt the details of what had taken place On arrival we found that the populace had all sent iheir women and children out of the town into the hinterland and that the Shaikh feared to came off as usual on seeing my flag, until he he had received a safe conduct in writing from me. It was clear in fact from the Residency Agent’s report that thev had anticipated immediate hostilities and were pleasantly surprised at not e ettin&lt;‘ them These people do not under tand deliberate methods of justice “and ft would have been difficult to prolong such a situation as existed while we attempted to exchange telegraphic communications with Government bv wire less, which was liable to interruption from atmospherics at any moment in the most uncertain weather which prevailed at the time. ’ As to whether the conditions we imposed were suitable or the reverse the Government of India must decide, but I cannot think that the situation was one ' Inch could have been delayed without prejudice while we made references to Calcutta and awaited replies. 5. The idea oJ- installing a British Agent by bombardment. This is not quite what His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief and I contem plated, and I think it is perhaps a cdse in which telegraphic brevity or faulty expression has conveyed a wrung impression. We had no primary wish to install an Agent by bombardment, indeed we were greatly averse to any bombaidment at all, as calculated to cripple the port from a trade point of 1 view tor some time to come W e had every hope that the action taken in the present connection would demonstrate to the Shaikh and his people that thev must make up their minds to fall in with the reasonable requirements of the protecting Power, and both the Residency Agent and the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Umm-el-Kawain were enjoined, and undertook, to endeavour, pending reply from Government, to influence the Shaikh and his notables in the riaht direction in tins connection. We hoped good counsels would prevail but “we thought it conceivable that the Shaikh might be put up by his reactionary adviser to oppose the British Agent and the Post Office and that in that even tuality, in order to bring him and the intractable section of his followers to their knees, it might be necessary to occupy the town for a short period after first dominating it by bombardment. As it was probable that most of the Arabs would bolt to the desert very shortly after the fire commenced from the ships, we had to consider the question of dealing with some 2000 well-armed men, and for that reason it was considered necessary to have sufficient force at hand in case the worst happened. It was thought probable that the majority o: them could be withdrawn after a very short occupation. J 3 c- r h iv. fK 49 Under any circumstances it was only intended to demolish the fort and then some of the outlying houses, sufficiently to demonstrate the power of modern gurs. Tire was only to be continued for about ten minutes and then to cease for a period in order to give them every chance of coming in, our whole object being to do as little damage as possible with the achievement of the object in view. After a short time we anticipated that the populace would get used to the presence of the British Agent, and he could then be le^t with a strong guard which could gradually he reduced ; the more quickly if a wireless station he created. 6 . The Government of India consider an occasional visit of Eis Majesty's Consul in one of ILis Majesty's Ships will he sufficient for the pr sent.^ I shall he discussing the question of the need for a British Agent at Debai on its general merits in a later paragraph, and beg to defer my remarks on this point until then. 7. A situation has been created on the Trucial Coast fraught with dangerous development) and the contingency of the other Shaikhs com bining has to be guarded against .—I do not think it is at all the case in fact that a dangerous situation has been created on the coast generally. I have close personal acquaintance with all the Shaikhs indi vidually. Shargah and Umm-el-Kawain displayed no more than a detached interest in what had happened, accompanied by the expression of a some friendly regret that the Shaikh of Debai had fallen out with Government. They both gave their effective co-operation. Bas-el-Khaima has been most friendly to Bis Majesty’s ships as also has Umm-el-Kawain. Among them selves the Shaikhs’ interests and tribes are quite distinct, and I do not at present see the least grounds to apprehend any combination. On the contrary, I hope that the action taken so far as the* Trucial Coast is concerned will have a salutary effect. In this connection 1 may add that wireless reports from the coast received up to date show that the position is quite satisfactory. 8 . The Shaikh's and their people should be made to understand that we have no intention of weakening their independence or preventing their possess ing arms for their own use —There is, I am confident, no misapprehension among them on this score. The above facts were specifically reiterated to the three Shaikhs above mentioned when present at Debai. They were well aware of them and gratefully acknowledged them. Up to quite recently I have been dealing with applications from them for p-rmits for the passage of a few arms for their own use, and they do not hesitate to make them or I to grant them in reason. 9 The object of our action on the Trucial coast is to stop the export of arms to Persia in which course the British Government^ are “ acting as Agents to the Persian Government and at their reguest .'—I venture with the highest respect to ask the Government of India to consider whether it is correct vi-a-vis the Trucial Shaikhs to say that we are acting as far as their coast is concerned as “ Agents for the Persian Government or at their request ? We have no delegation from the Persian Government to act for them in the territorial waters of the Trucial Shaikhs. I submit that in those waters we are acting as Agents of the Shaikhs themselves, in their interests and in our own, in order to prevent arms going through lema to arm the tribesmen on both sides of our Korth-West Front)er. As protecting Power we have decided to take their delegation of authority tor granted and they fully recognise the position. So far as they know we are acting in defence of our own vital interests and it is on that understanding that I have repeatedly impressed upon them their obligation to cooperate with us, and 1 consequently submit any communication to them in the sense of the concluding sentence of your telegram is in any case inexpedient and in fact unnecessary. What 1 have understood to be the position as above described was again impressed on the Shaikhs of Debai, Umm-el-Kawain and Shargah and at our recent interview with them at Debai, and I feel confident that they are under no misapprehension in regard thereto.10. Having given such explanations as I am able to afford in regard t*' the several points indicated by your telegram under reply, I venture to add th« following further remarks. at, .^character of the present 0 /Under his predecessor. Shaikh Makhtoom, Debai was the best ruled of the Trucial Coast ports. Writing or. the subject in the Administration Eeport for 1904-05, I recorded the following remarks on the subject:— The administration of this Chief is the most enlightened and promising of any of the Trucial Chiefs and is justifying the enterprise of the British India Steam Navigation Company in making Debai a fortnightly port of oaiL. ! ^ ’■ * Unfoitunately Shaikh Makhtoom did not last long after that report was written, and in recording his death in February 1906, I wrote that his cousin Shaikh Butti who had succeeded him was less enlightened and was not likely to prove so amenable to reason as Makhtoom had always been. That forecast has been fully borne out. Shaikh Butti has always been a difficulty. He is pleasant enough to meet personally, hut is a most unreliable and unsatisfactory ruler and during the five rears of his incumb ency has gradually allowed his community to get thoroughly out of hand. As the Shaikh of Umm-el-Kawain remarked to me;—“There are 100 Shaikhs in Behai. My difficulty in dealing with him has been that whereas when I interview him personally upon any matter of importance he invariably appears to have quite come round to one s view, yet as soon as one has left he generally writes to say he has discussed matters with his advisers and as they°are not in favour of the proposal, he trusts he will be excused from compliance. In these matters the influence of the Residency Agent counts for very littlej and it has thus been difficult to make any progress with Shaikh Butti. At my last visit to Debai, previous to the present occasion (in August last) Shaikh Butti discussed the question of the Post Office quite freely; admitted that the present makeshift arrangement was unsatisfactory and verbally agreed, if I thought it advisable, to have a more regular office. Similarly in discussing the pending retirement of Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif, owing to ill-health, Shaikh Butti himself expressed a wish for a succes sor of a dilferent type and heard without demur or comment some queries put to me by some of the British Indians residing in Debai as to who the new Agent would be and whether he could not be an European. I rather thought the Shaikh would now be glad of the appointment of an Englishman, if only to strengthen his own hands in dealing with his troublesome relatives; and his cousin and Vazier, Butti-bin-Rashid, even went so far, when visiting Major Knox a month or six weeks ago when the latter touched at Debai on his way to Bahrain, as to express the opinion that the best thing for Debai would be the presence of a British Agent. in From these indications. I anticipated that I should have little difficulty getting Mr. New satisfactorily installed if I took took him down myself and had the moral support of one of His Majesty’s Ships for the occasion. 11. The question of our relations and influence with the Trucial chiefs Vide correspondence ending with Residency letter generally. The need for Specific steps to No. 173 , dated the 12 th December 1902 . strengthen our influence on this coast was fully realised by the Government of India a decade ago. Again, five years later when the question of Mr. Gaskin’s future was under nde Residency letter No. 198, dated the soth consideration, the post of British A^ent Apn! lyes. j} e b a i was one 0 f ^j ie alternative means suggested for employing him. The difficulty of the position generally and the urgency for remedying it were also drawn attention to at pages 7 and 65 of the Residency Administra tion Reportifor 1906-07, and again in my despatch No. 1726^ 6th June 1908 (paragraph 15). I would then refer to the recommendation of Mr. Charles Akers and of the Board of Trade 1 'to which reference was made in my telegram No. 115^1741 61 f of 3rd March 1909. At that time after careful study of the position I deprecated the appointment being carried out for the present for the consider ation explained and suggested, as a compromise, that the officer to be appointed as Vice-Consul at Lingah should visit Debai occasionally as necessity required and opportunity offered. Since then nearly two years have elapsed during which the situation has developed in directions which have greatlv accentuated the need for the presence of a British Officer and a Telegraph Station on the coast. The interests of our own trade need it, and the attention which foreign merchants, such as Messrs. Wonckhaus and Messrs. Rosenthal, are now paying to Debai make the appointment politically important. Latterly again the indications that the coast in question is being used as a forwarding base for arms lend the question fresh urgency. It was because the .Arms Traffic question gave us specific grounds, and the presence of a large fleet of ships in the Gulf gave us means for safely installing our Agent, that 1 made the suggestion to send Mr. JNew to Debai lor this cold weather. When I asked sanction to that course ^ m “ tended to take Mr. New to Debai myself after the Admiral had left and then believed that with the support of one of His Majesty’s ships I should have been able to overcome the Shaikh’s objections in a friendly way and get Mr. New installed without any serious obstruction,. But the arms question began to get acute and Mr. New was on the point of leaving for Debai with the Senior Naval Officer when the recent incident occurred and upset our calculations. The Government of India now express the view that requirements will be sufficiently met by an occasional visit of the Vice-Consul in one of His Majesty’s Ships, until such time as friendly relations have been re-established sufficient to warrant his installation on shore. I trust, however, that in the absence of unfavourable developments, the Government of India will feel able to modify their view. I cannot but fear that, if the location of the British Agent is deferred, it will be deferred indefinitely and that when the time is forced upon us there is no criterion that we shall not have the same difficulty to face then as we have now. n ir * We have naturally incurred a great deal of odium all over to the Gulf in connection with the measures we are taking for the suppression o ^ 6 arms traffic and this recent incident will no doubt increase it; but it M me vita Die that we should incur this odium and I submit that we should not le i us from compensating ourselves, where possible, by using sue igi ^ opportunities as the course of events and the presence of our s ips y afford us for strengthening our influence and our hold in places where ey operative. . , I would not recommend this perseverence in the present location of toe British Officer, did I think that it would result in any permanent or wiae- spread combination or ebullition of hostility against us, but at presen grounds for fearing such a contingency. . I believe the idea of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chie leaving the Gulf now, would be to carry out the installation w k en __ with the necessary ships and men to carry out any naval action or tion that His Majesty’s Government may finally direct at the nor Gulf; meanwhile, I shall shortly be visiting the Trucial Coast ag am • nection with the Abu Musa case and shall have an opportunity o 0 g g the effect of the recent incident and action on the public mind.N v' 63 Telegram, No. 1, dated the 16th January 1911. From —His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, Maskat, To —The Marine Department. I have received from Captain Cranford the following telegram, dated Jask, the 14th January, and have replied to him on 15th January. Both telegrams are repeated for the consideration of the Government of India. The telegram from Captain Cranford is as follows :— Begins. Mr. Gumhley tele graphs that messengers have been sent by Islam Khan to Rapch reporting that 120 Afghans have arrived at Bampur. His brother Cutat (?) ordered (?) Afghans away, hut in the event of Afghans fighting, he enquires whether he can expect oar support. Telegram from Mr. Gumbley ends. Letter to me from Islam of similar import is on its way. The position of these Chiefs, if unsupported, is difficult. The letter is due to reach me in a few days. On what lines am I to answer it ? Ends. I have replied as follows:— Begins. Your telegram of 14th January. Please explain to Islam Khan that too prolonged an expedition would be involved by operations so far inland as Bampur, and might be regarded as indicating an intention of occupying country; which is opposed to our policy. In the event of Afghans occupying the low country we may be in a position to help to drive them from the coast. If Islam Khan has not a sufficient force to drive them out without our help, he should not proceed to extremities until Afghans have advanced to the coast; and even then he should not take action that will involve him without consulting us. He should order the Afghans away, warning them that, in the event of their endeavouring to reach the coast, they will run the risk of being struck by our troops. Islam Khan should also keep us informed fully of their movements. Ends. It will be observed that the attitude of Islam Khan is quite satisfactory, but it may involve him in trouble with the Afghans. Eurther troops will be required if it is considered advisable to support Islam Khan beyond the immediate coast districts.From Viceroy, 23rd January 1911. Foreign Secret.

Requirement of moment seems to be summary punishment and cash compensation, but not political compensation o a kind that would inevitably give rise to suspicions of our ulterior motives.

I have sent the following telegram to Colonel Cox : — “ No. 3. Government of India are not satisfied with situation that has arisen at Debai. They gather from your telegram of 30th December that the house-search took place without the presence of Sheikh. If this is so, action of Comirander was hardly prudent, and was likely to provoke reprisals. They think some of conditions imposed onerous, such as imposition of fine of Rs. 50,000, and that Government of India should have been first consulted. They do not approve idea of installing a British Agent at Debai by bom bardment, and the employment of a force of 1,000 men, since it might become impossible to remove them without danger to the Agent. They consider an occasional visit of A ice-Consul from Lingah in one of His Majesty’s ships would suffice until such cordial relations were re-established as would justify location of an Agent. Situation has been created on trucial coast that may be fraught with dangerous developments, and object originally in view was hardly worth the risk. In any case situation requires careful handling lest the other Chiefs should combine with the Sheikh of Debai, and it is very desirable that friendly relations should be restored with the least .possible delay. If it has not already been done, Government of India think that it should be clearly explained to the tribesmen at Debai, as elsewhere, that they have no intention of weakening their independence, or of preventing their own possession of arms, their only object being to stop export of arms to Persia, in which course they are acting as Agents of the Persian Government, and at their request.”[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] — ■- - [January 6.] Section 3.

His Majesty’s Government concur generally in views expressed in your telegram to Cox, and agree entirely with your disapproval of installation of British Agent by bombardment and armed force. Requirement of moment seems to be summary punishment and casli compensation, but not political compensation of a kind that would inevitably give rise to suspicions of our ulterior motives. It is further desirable that punishment should be such as to act as deterrent on other tribes. Difficulty remains as to action to be taken if Sheikh fails within reasonable time to fulfil conditions he has accepted. What action would you propose in this connection ? In view of loss of life, fine by way of pecuniary compensation should be as large as is consistent with Sheikh’s capacity for payment. As regards arms traffic on trucial coast reliance must be placed on vigilance of His Majesty’s ships to prevent Debai and other ports being used for purposes of illicit trade. NlIrmadiute. £i r.

(£&gt; ^From Commander-in-Oh.ief, East Indies, at Henjani, to the Secretary, Admiralty, ist January 1911. No. 234. With reference to my telegram No. 233, dated 29th December, regarding position at Dibai. Sheikh has complied with four demands included in ultimatum, and as regards items 5 and 0 informed he must fully under stand he will have to accept decision (of) Government without question. He is weak ruler, however, and experience gained by recent incident demonstrates that while not intractable or unfriendly himself, he is coerced by a faction of truculent relatives who are strongly opposed to any inconvenient increase of British influence or domination In our opinion it becomes all the more necessary to locate a British Agent heie in order to strengthen our hold not only upon Dibai but upon the coast generally. But under the present conditions it is possible that we may find difficulty in installing the Agent without the employment of force, and if that should become necessary it would (be) advisable to have a force of 1,000 men, including artillery and sappers, ready to be sent up if the Sheikh refuses to comply with the demand when it is made. A simple bombardment would have effect of considerably damaging town and pearling fleet and would, to a large extent, destroy value of Dibai as a trading port, but it would not necessarily bring about submission of the tribesmen unless followed up by the disembarkation of a sufficiently strong force to occupy town. We are both of the decided opinion execution of measure is urgently called for before the advent of hot weather and trust Government will see fit to authorise it. Copy of this telegram has been sent to the Government of India by the Political Resident.... Telegram No. Frt'in Place Day Time Oespatch ReceiptThe Present Situation. Of recent years Debai has grown into a of considerable importance, as the distribut ing centre for the whole Trucial Coast. For merly this trade was done at Lingah, but when the Belgian customs were established on the Persian shore and imposed the rigid col lection of customs dues on all the entrepot trade, practically the whole of it was moved over to Debai, which has since been a regular port of call for British-India steamers, which land thousands of tons there every year. Moreover, a certain amount of the distributing trade of the Trucial coast has moved from Muscat to Debai, where, although the harbour '-s only an open roadstead with no landing facilities, the low import duties and the faci lities given for trade have led to its increasing importance. How comes it, then, that the Trucial coast, which has undergone these sobering influences of trade, and has maintained these uniformly friendly relations with the British Power, should suddenly become the scene of fighting of the character Reuter has described in the last few days. Fortunately there is in Bombay at this moment a gentle man who knows more about Arabia and this part of the Gulf littoral than any other living authority. This is the Rev. fS- M. Zwemer, whose book, “Arabia : The Cradle of Islam,” is one of the classical authorities upon that . country. Mr. Zwemer is visiting Bombay to attend the World Conference of the Y.M.C.A. now being held here. In the course of a few minutes’ conversation with our representative, Mr. Zwemer said he had no doubt whatsoever that the Debar We have described was the scene of the fighting. Misunderstanding. When he passed down the Gulf in the British India mail steamer a few days ago the greater part of the mos quito fleet which under Rear-Admiral Slade is engaged in checking the contrabrand tra ffic in arms was concentrated in the neigh bourhood of the port. Mr. Zwemer is abso lutely convinced that the fighting occurred through a complete misunderstanding, on the part of the Arabs, of the reasons which have compelled the British Government to take action against the arms traffic. Of late the distinctly pro-British feeling on the Trucial coast has undergone a great change in the direction of decided hostility to foreigners. The Arabs have been led to believe that the operations of the British Government to check the contraband traffic in arms I are directed to the gradual disarma ment of the Arabs, with a view to the ultimate occupation and partition of Arabia. We need not say that to the Arab his rifle is by far his dearest and most treasur ed possession—dearer even than his wife, be cause it is to him the only security for his life and property. Touch the Arab on the question of his right to carry a rifle, and you touch him upon the most sensitive point you can find. The Need of the Moment, it is this belief, Mr. Zwemer is convinced, ! which has driven the Arabs of Debai to the I absolutely unprecedented course, for recent years, of opposing the authority of the British Government. He thinks it is most important that official action should at once be taken to convince the Arabs that we have no such in tentions in view, and that our ojterations are solely directed against the contraband traffic, which otherwise will lead to the still bitter arming of the tribes on our north-western frontier. This anti-foreign feeling on the Tru cial Coast has largely been fostered by the Egyptian newspapers Moayid and Lew a, which have been inculcating in the population of Arabia a belief that the partition of Persia is to be followed by the partition of Arabia. For the partition of Persia, even if such were contemplated, the Arabs care not at all, for they have no love for the Persians, either as a nation or on the ground of their heretical religion. But their own independence is' their most cherished possession, and any attack on this, or any general impression that an attack upon it is in contemplation, would be certain to rouse the most'bitter and determin ed resistance. Removal of Misunderstanding. Another point which is calculated to in tensify these misapprehensions in the minds of the Arab population of the Trucial Coast, is | the fact that this arms traffic has long been carried on, and they &lt;can- i not see why such drastic attempts I should now be made to suppress it- More over, they know that at Muscat the trade is openly prosecuted under the very eyes of the British Consular and Naval authorities. They can se« no reason why what is sauce 'iot the Muscat goose should not be sauce for the Debai gander. They know nothing of inter national treaties, which at the present time prevent Great Britain from taking steps to prevent this traffic at its great centre, Muscat. It is useless to talk to them of in ternational obligations because they cannot understand them. Incidentally, this differen tiation against Debai in favour of Muscat has been a considerable factor, both in promo ting anti-foreign feeling and in stimulating a sentiment hostile to the suppression of the arms traffic. Above all, it seems necessary that the earliest steps should be officially taken to make as clear as possible to the Arabs of the Trucial Coast the real significance of our action anti to give them the most sub stantial assurances that no attack upon their independence, or upon their individual right to carry arms, is contemplated. The Trucial Coast, it need scarcely be added, is Wahabi to the core, and therefore a centre of no little religious fanaticism./ / / / 1 an comnanded by My Lords Commissioners of tho Admiralty to transmit herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, decypher of a telegram i.No.233) dated the 30th instant, which has been received from the Commander-in-Chicf, East Indies, report- / ing the proceedings taken by himself and by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf with regard to the recent firing on a Naval landing party at Dihai. 2.- My Lords would be glad to be informed what reply it is desired should be sent to the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, respecting the joint request made by himself and by the Political Resident that they may bo authorised to utilise the present opportunity of insisting upon the Sheikh at Dibai undertaking to accept the measures propose With regard to the proposed installation of wireless tele graph apparatus, I am to state that the Admiralty could only lend Naval W/T operators to work the temporary instal lation for a short time, and that under their agreement with the Marconi Company, no other ope(tfators could be allowed to work an installation supplied by the Admiralty, o.- It will not be possible for the guard for the Britis[£&lt;a f\ ' i : &lt;S&gt; From Gommander-in-Chief, East Indies, t&amp; Admiralty, London, 30th December 1910. No. 233. . / n Political Resident and I have carefully gone into cause of fighting (at) Dibai, and we are of opinion it was the culmination of a growing feeling of hostility to the measures enforced for the suppression of arms traffic on t his coast. The immediate cause was resentment at the attempted search (of) two houses. On previous recent occasion, on which Sheikh had been asked to have a house searched he did in such a perfunctory way as to make the operation a farce. On the present occasion though called upon by the Com mander (of) landing party (to) meet him and search certain houses with support of our men, he failed (to) comply and did not appear until trouble had begun. . . The impression conveyed by several reports of British officers is that he allowed trouble to commence, either by apathy or intention, but that when he saw that it had gone too far he exerted himself to stop it and show that he was able to control it when he chose. The Sheikh came on board “ Hyacinth ” at Dibai on 28th December under a safe return to interview Political Resident and myself. He altogether repudiated complicity in the firing on our men and alleged that the latter had started the firing. His statements generally were altogether contrary to facts reported by our officers and could not be accepted. He, having further refused, in spite of explanations, to allow a tide pole to be replaced which had been erected by the officer commanding boat, and which Sheikh had caused to be removed, or agree (to) receive a British officer as Resident’s Agent, Dibai, we have, accondinglv made the following demand on him in writing, and have allowed him 48 hours for compliance, viz. —Immediate replacement of the tide pole and retention as long as needed by the officer commanding His Majesty’s ship stationed here. 2nd. Accept telegraph installation whenever considered necessary by the Government in accordance with provisions of additional article of the Treaty, 4th May, 3 rc p Delivery of 400 serviceable rifles, lo be collected from inhabitants. 4 th. Payment of Rs. 50,000 as a fine, to be considered at the disposal of Government, and the retention or restoration of wdiole or any portion to be affected by his acceptance following two further conditions which, however, are not part of present ultimatum, pending the concurrence of the Government. 5 th.—Acceptance British officer as an agent, with a small personal guard, and co-operation in finding himself suitable quarters, and according of protection and friendly treatment. 0 t h—Acquiescence exchange (of) existing primitive and unsatisfactory postal arrangements for a sub post-office of the India Postal Depart ment, as at other ports where steamers call in the Persian Gulf. Resident and I are convinced that both political, commercial, and arms traffic requirements on the trucial coast demand appointment of a British officer at Dibai. A proper post office is also needed by our traders, and a wireless telegraph installation is indispensable if a British officer is located there. We recommend that we be authorised to take present opportunity to insist Sheikh undertake (to) accept these measures. It will be under stood that installation (of) British officer will mean that a sufficient guard must be provided for his safety and wireless telegraphy installed. I have small installation available at once and would propose erect it pending Replacement by a more effective one.

The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, telegraphed on the 9th November the following details regarding the affair at Bris:—The Prosperpine at 1 P.M.,on 2nd November, landed seven miles west of Bris a force of 60 officers and men under Commander Marshall. The landing was carried out without opposition, and a position on the nearest hill was taken up, a maxim gun being mounted. As there were no indications of the enemy, the party divided to carry out a search: one under Lieutenant Gresson proceeding inland, the other under Commander Marshall moving to the left flank. When leaving the knoll to rejoin rest, the enemy who were invisible opened fire at a distance of about lOo'yards, two officers and one man, as already reported, being wounded. Lieutenant Gresson then assumed command; the enemy, to the number of about 40, retiring hurriedly, leaving behind some loaded rifles, and were not seen again. The party embarked about 8 P.M., and during the night search-lights were used and a few shells fired to prevent removal of arms. On daylight of 3rd November the Perseus arrived, landing 250 men including 50 sepoys from Charbar. After careful search arms were discovered in crevice of hills and the ammunition buried in the sand by the side of the dhow which had been beached and abandoned. On 4th November further search was made, dhow was burnt and ship left. Maskat had stated that carried 400 rifles ; 360 rifles and 30,000 rounds were actually taken. The wounded are progressing favourably.75 No. 2973, dated Bushire, the 6th (received 15th) November 1910 (Confidential). From— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z.

It seems desirable to come to usual understanding with Kheir Muhammad even at cost of compensating him for loss of land if he thereby severs connection with Persia and Arms traffic. I think authority should be given to Major McConaghey to discuss matter with Khair Muhammad with the view to settle ment. McConaghey can warn him of grave risk of future capture by us in Persia, and severe punishment for recent offences. We are unaware of exac nature of his proprietary rights in the land, and Sardar Sayyid Khan professes to have turned him out of his country (vide his telegram February 7th to Major Trevor), hut the chances are that Khair Muhammad’s religious status prevents any interference with him or his land. I would suggest that, if purchase is necessary in order to effect settlement, we should accept his written guarantee of title to land as sufficient proof. I am unable to suggest any way of disposing of the land, except by using i political advantage by presenting it to Sardar Sayyid Khan, for such peno he renders us due service.~» Tjjpp | (0 Telegram, No. 99, dated the 3rd November 1910. From—His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, Bombay, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department, The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, repeats, on the 1st November 1910, the following telegram from the Officer Commanding Charbar detach ment and asks for instructions :— Begins. A Baluchi who, on 1st November 1910, landed from Warora and who shows a pass signed by the French Consul at Maskat, had ammunition and a new rifle (Martini-Henry). Pending receipt of orders these have been confiscated temporarily. Ends. The Senior Naval Officer telegraphs again on the 2nd November 1910:— Begins. The following is the reading of the pass on which the French Consul, Maskat’s stamp is dated 11th October 1910, but the signature cannot be read:— “ The bearer of this pass is entitled to 200 rounds of ammunition and one rifle. He is going home and is a Charbar^. , ’— Ends. That a pass bearing the French Consul’s signature should he recognised as valid for passing arms into Persia is not con sidered at all desirable, and I would suggest the destruction of the ammunition and rifle which have been ordered to be detained for the present.Telegram P., No. S—673, dated the 8th November 1010. From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. You have probably been informed by Senior Naval Officer of temporary confiscation of rifle and ammunition in possession of a Charbari who landed at Charbar on 1st Novemer holding a pass, dated the 11th October from the British Consul at Maskat authorising him to possess rifle and 200 rounds. Naval Commander-in-Chief suggests destruction of arms, &amp;c. Do you see any objection ?Telegram P., No. 1065-0., dated (and received) tlia 9tli November 1910.

Cases, however, are not all fours and it is of highest importance that French experiment should be nipped in the bud. I think the destruction of the rifle would be most effective way of doing so, but as ride and pass only came to light after the individual had landed, destruction should, strictly speaking, be carried out by Persian Customs representative in our presence, or as altera tive, the rifle which is still in our possession, might be sent on board one of His Majesty’s ships and dropped overboard. This would have the effect of regard ing the matter as a blockade incident.17 Telegram P., No 942, dated (and received) the 9th October 1910.

Such seizures might cause questions to be raised of our right to seize arms in Persian territory, though they may be technically justifiable. Accordingly, instructions should be communicated to the Admiral to this effect. Ends.

It will be noted that reference is not made therein to the territorial waters of the tnicial chiefs, the reason being that we have no specific authority from those chiefs in respect of their waters. It is, therefore, a question for the consideration of Government whether or not we should ask the Shaikhs to give us a written delegation of the necessary authority. I personally incline to the view that the Shaikhs would expect us to take the authority for granted, and would be somewhat surprised at our asking granted— as was done to some extent at Debai on the occasion referred I shall be glad, however, to be favoured with the views of the Government of India and their instructions, if necessary, on the point in question. 26 No. 2129 E.-A., dated Simla, the 11th October 1910 (Confidential).
