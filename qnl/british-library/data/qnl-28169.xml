Kay, 1945. ! 'i (8 I Dear Ilarrisoni I 945 ^aniiTTf rr.nac -r You will recollect that I recently sent you the rough draft of a memorandum of mine on the subject of Persian frontiers and that you returned this without comment. I have since been checking up some of my data, and have discovered soeue 'snags'. One of these is the question of the frontier between Persia and British Baluchistan. It is s^ed/clearly by Ourzon and less clearly by Goldsmid that this frontier (TT / p '~~)l was defined from the coast as far as &lt;Talq£ Some official sources, however, make out that the definition stopped at Kuhak. V.hich account is right? I am inclined to follow Cur- zon. Also, v/as tSEk^the frontier between Gwatar bay and Kuhak demarcated by the later IlOldich Commission? I think that only the stretch from Kuhak to a point just west of the Kamun-i-Mashkel was demarcated then (pillar iTo. 10 was sit uated at 62: 28°16 ’35 1 ' IT., 62°50 , 11' E. and pillar No. 11 at 28°11 , 20' IT., 62°39 f 20' E, thus taking the deraarcatedn right up to the Hamun and same then some 12 miles to the west). Lastly, it does not appear that the frontier from Jalq to the Kuh-i-Malik-i-Siyah was ever properly^defined. I should be very grateful if you woiiLik indly help RSCo.PQt, t 2 MAY 1945 me to clear these matters up.
