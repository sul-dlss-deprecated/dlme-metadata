Sir: This Consulate is desirous to obtain certain information regarding local laws as to disinterring remains of deceased Americans on Bahrein Islands. The Government of Bahrein was approached on this matter and suggested our inquiries be made to you. Any help your good offices can render us in reply to the follow ing questions would be greatly appreciated: 1. How soon after death must a body be embalmed? 2. The Department of Health of the City of New York reports that a dead human body that has been packed in lime and hermetically sealed in a lead casket would be considered as pro perly embalmed for admission at the Port of New York. The Department of Health also reports that a dead human body not embalmed for interment would be admitted at the Port of New York if the remains were wrapped in a winding sheet saturated with a solution of commercial liquid formalin, five parts, water 95 parts, and then immediately placed in a hermetically sealed metal casket and the casket placed within a strong wooden coffin, of which all parts are joined together by screwnails. Opening of the sealed metal casket would not be permitted in the City of New York. Do these requirements of containers prescribed for dead bodies conform with the local laws? Is burial required within a prescribed period when a body is not embalmed as well as when a body is embalmed? If so what are the required periods? Bahrain Receipt 4. What1 »v •* © _ - 2 - 4.
