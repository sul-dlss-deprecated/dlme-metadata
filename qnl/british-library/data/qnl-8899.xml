It is diffi cult to see the use of it all, when the country is known to suffer from the want of hands to till the the conferences with no or mahomed at pesha wur. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,—I observe that notice has been given by Lord Elcho in the House of Commons that he will bring under the notice of that House the language which has recently been used with reference to Sir Lewis Felly's conduct in the conferences with Noor Mahomed at Peshawur. I assume that this notice refers to a part of the speech which I recently ad dressed to the House of Lords. If I had not been about to leave England 1 should have waited to see whether 1 am right in this assumption, and whether the matter would be brought before the House in which the language referred to was used ; but as I shall be absent from England for some months, I think it best to intimate at once to the friends of Sir Lewis Pelly that in the conferences at Peshawur I have always regarded him as the mere mouthpiece of the Government of India, and that, in particular, the whole communication made by him to Noor Mahomed on the 15th of March, 1877, seems to have been directly dictated by the Viceroy. It is in this communication that the worst offences were committed by the ' Englishman and the Christian against the Mahomedan and the Afghan and I have never held that Sir L. Pelly was personally responsible for any part of them. I take this opportunity of repeating that the language in which I have characterused these offences is founded on the narrative I have given of the language and the conduct of the Government of India : and that, although that narrative has been published now for more than three months, no attempt even has been made to answer or to reiute it.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. ^ Sir,—In The Timet of to-day there is a letter from the Duke of Argyll relating to a notice i have given in the House of Commons, which he rightly assumes to refer to language recently used by him in reference to Sir Lewis Pelly in connexion with che negotiations at Peshawur. This was as follows ;—' I never go back to those conferences between Sir Lewis Pelly and the late Noor Mahomed without a feeling of utter shame and humiliation. We have the fairness, the dignity, and the truth on the side of the Mahomedan and the Afghan ; and we hare every thing that is the opposite on the side of the Englishman and the Christian.' In the natural sense of ordinary language these words would appear to apply directly to Sir Lewis Pelly. ^ But the Duke nowjsays ;—' He thinks it best to intimate at once to the friends of Sir Lewis Pelly that in the oon' ference at Peshawur he has always regarded bim as the mere mouthpiece of the Government of mdia, and that he has never held that Sir Lewis Pelly was personally re sponsible lor any part of it.' We have here what the duke doubtless considers a proper retractation or denial of wliat appeared to be his personal charges against Sir L. Pelly. I am not surprised to find that th duke has come to the conclusion that he had made a mistake in speaking as he did of Sir L. Pelly, as a reference to ' Hansard' shows that in the debates on the Atghan question in December last, Mr. Gladatone, Lord Lawrence, and Lord .Northbrook carefully avoided all criticism of the personal action and language of Sir L. Pelly .in the eonferences at Peshawur, and bore approving testimony to the manner in which he had conducted the negotiation, as the follow ing quotations will show :— Mr. Gladstone.—' I have not a word to say against the accuracy oi Sir Lewis Pelljtv . . 1 placed no mark ot carelessness or inaccuracy against him. . . The language of Sir L. Pelly appears to be usually courteous and kindly.' Lord Northbrook.—' I have no fault to find with the manner in which Sir L. Pelly carried out the instruc tions he had received.' - n Lord Lav\reiice.—' The Afghan envoy was labouring under a severe lorm of disease, and came by slow stages Irom Cabul. On his arrival at Peshawar ho was cour teously received by Sir L. pelly.'V In the same debate the Lord Chancellor spoke as fol lows :— v ' It has been said that the object of Sir L. Pelly was to pick a quarrel at the conference with the Ameer and his envoy, i have read with some care the narrative of what took place at the couterence, and 1 am bound to say that anything more unlike an attempt to pick a quarrel | than Sir L. Pelly's conduct 1 never read. Anything more careful, more elaborate than his explanations, more patient than his attention to all the complaints of the envoy 1 never read. The couference went on from day to day and from week to week. The whims and the caprice of the envoy were indulged j he was allowed to speak day after day without interruption. Sir L. Pelly presented the advantages he had to offer in the most attractive form. . . Everything which patience, temper, and long experience could enable a man to do to make a conference successful was done by Sir Lewis Pelly.' After the apology ot the duke I shall not on this occa sion follow up my notice, although I am anxious to take some fitting opportunity to enter a protest against the un generous treatment which our public servants have of late received at the hands of political partisans, and of which the published language of the Duke of Argyll is only the most recent and flagrant instance. I remain your obedient servant, St. James's-place, May 24. ELCHO.Crown 8»o,, 7s. 6j. CiAkTHAGB aod the CARTHAGINIANS. By R. J BOS WORTH SMITH, M.A. Second fflttion, revlsefl and cn- larxeii.

' Dear Lord Eldio,—Yoar letU-r in TAt Times of to-dcy is open to tL»&lt; criticism that the person agaiut whom it i» directed is, and will bo for gome time, prevented from protesting against the construction wlicli you hare cbosen to place upon Li» letter which appeared in The Times of the 24th inst. Believing that that construction is a fair one, you speak of the letter iu which lie disclaims a certain interpretation which you appeared to put upon the language recently used by him when refer ring to the confereiices between Noor Mahomed and Sir Lewis Pelly at Peehawur as au ' apology ' for and a ' retractation or denial of what appeared to be his personal charges against Sir Lewis i eliy. Unnecessary though it teemed to him, he was willing, iu order to save you trouble, to give an explanation of that language J but aa nothing was further from his intention so nothing will aurprise him more than to learn that ho has either apologized or retracted. ' You have quoted and considered apart, I think, from the context the words to which you took exception ; and you say that ' in the natural sense of ordinary lan guage these words would appear to apply directly to Sir Lewis PeJiy.'' u Undoubtedly they apply, and were intended (when taken with what goei before) to apply directly to Sir Lewis Pelly ; but that this was a direct application to him, coiifciiiered as the ' mouthpiece' and representative of tbo Government of India, and not a direct aud personal application retioeting on his private character, no uge could have failed to infer who looked to the entire passage (part of which you have quoted), and who remem lered that Sir Lewis Pelly both received instructions before and while conducting the negotiations, and that he acted up to them in such a way as to earn the unqualified praise of Lord Lyttou aud af Lord Salisbury. • &gt; 11 ' Had there been anything done or said by Sir Lewis Pelly at Peshawur which bad uot, iu every particular, been adopted and approved by the Home Government, the words spoireu ou the 16th of this month in the House of Lords might have had the force aud effect which you errone ously attribute to them. ' When you say that you are 4 not surprised to bud that the duke has come to the conclusion that be bad made a mistake in speaking as he did of Sir L. leily, you somewhat adroitly attempt to excuse your own r^ treat by representing him as having changed his front, when, iu fact, his position remains, and will continue tu remain, unturned.

Ekins is accredited with five wickets in six overs, and Shaughnessy tour in 23 overs. The Kent bats men started indifferently. Three wickets three runs. Hearne resisted lies and Southerton bravely until 60 runs were recorded as a total, towards which he contributed more than half. The three wickets now to fall added 14, and'Bt 4 o'clock the innings terminated. When the day's play ceased five wickets of Surrey's second innings were lost for 82 runs. On the following morning the remaining six wickets fell so rapidly that five runs only resulted, thus making a total of 87. Kent required 93 runs to win.

Three wickets three runs, liearne resisted lies and Southerton bravely until 60 runs were recorded as a total, towards which he contributed more than half. The three wickets now to fall added 14, and^t 4 o'clock the innings terminated. When the day's play ceased five wickets of Surrey's second innings were lost lor 82 ruas. On the following morning the remaining six wickets fell so rapidly that five runs only reunited, thus making a total of 87. Kent required 93 runs to win Towards tins number two bats contributed nearly half but the rest averaged less than three runs each. The Surrey colts won the match by 19 runs.

The travelled Russian easily raoonciles hiui- stlf to the political order of tilings under which ho is regarded as being in statu pupillari. He may even warmly defend it ; but if ho has ever tasted of the freedom and privacy of Western life, he never fails to smart under the unsparing surveil lance which awaits him when he returns homo. It is not the military character of the Government which is most distasteful ; it is the fact that the mouchard is everywhere. The educated Russian is proud of the strength of the Government, but it annoys him to find that it employs petty espioniiaye to gain its ends. It is of little use to pass any severe sentence on the Russian Government for the high-handed man ner in which it is repressing the seditious move ment. We can scarcely expect that despotic foreign Governments which have to contend against secret onspiracies will be nice and scrupulous as to the eans of repression. They all act in such emer- encies in a rude, rough fashion ; and wo ed not be surprised that the Russian Govern- aent, which is in its essence military, sets no jsample of leniency and declines to follow the lisurely, orderly, and constitutional procedure ftbich suits English ideas. It is more profitable to 3ndeavour to understand the now movement, anH to jee what is its origin, and whither it tends. The :ircumstances of Russia furnish the explanation, it is a country in which the extremes of barbarism ind civilization meet. The upper classes are at least he equals in intelligence of the corrasponding classes n Western Europe. Many of the savants of Russia iro of world-wide reputation. Under the patron- b,go of the Court and the great nobles, every art is cultivated at St. Petersburg. The spread of edu cation in recent years has been considerabIe,and in directly it is responsible for some of the present dis content. The educated Russian who has added to book lore the experiences of travel and knowledge of the world resigns himself to the political situation of tho country as inevitable ; but the new-fangled lore inspires raw enthusiasts with restless longings and vague political desires which are for tho most part impracticable. Tho visionary student returns ^from the High School or tho University with ideas hioh make him dislike tho ways of his country, fter having drunk of Western learning ho is sure have littlo in common with tho ignorant, perstitious moujik. There can be no political aternity between them. Ho can scarcely admit liat ho is of the same flesh and blood as a asant who idolizes all that advanced thinkers spise. He cannot appeal to popular feelings ith which he is out of sympathy ; he has rallying cry which would gather the mul- tude. His discontont does not find vent, lereforo, in any large political movement of )e kind which Governmonta cannot resist. Ho Decomes of necessity a plotter, and dreams ot realizing impossible anarchical chimeras ; and his dissatisfaction breaks out in the sputter- ings of conflagration or occasional assassinations. The Nihilist is a conspirator, but scarcely a revolutionist. He is, indeed, a formidable con spirator, for Russian enthusiasm has no bounds ; but he is not the man who overturns thrones and changes Governments. The vehement speech which the Duke of Argyll lately delivered in the House of Loids on the foreign policy of the Government has very natu rally produced irritation among his opponents. There waa one passage in particular in which he seemed to reflect with undue severity on the per sonal conduct and character of a respected Indian official. He was speaking of the Peshawur Confer ence of 1877, which was conducted by Sir Lewis Felly on behalf of the Vioeroy , and by Noou Mahomeu on the part of tho late Ameer Shere Ali . 'I never go back,' said the Duke, 'to ' those conferences at Peehawur between Sir ' Lewis Pelly and the late Noor Mahomed with- ' out a feeling of utter shame and humiliation. '* We have the fairness, tho dignity, and the truth ' on the side of the Muhomedan and the Afghan, ' and we have everything that is tho opposite to ' these on the side of the Englishman and theChris- ' tian.' Taken apart from the context, the wordscer- tainly road like a very strong censure on Sir Lewis Pellv , and bo they were understood by Lord Elcho, who, shortly after they wero spoken, gave notice that he would call attention to them in the House of Commons. As tiie i^uke of Aruvll was on the point of sailing for America, he did not wait for the discussion of Lord Elcho's notice, but at once wrote to us to explain that his censure properly applied to the acts and language of the Government oi which Sir Lewis Pellv was the mouthpiece, and that ho never held that that officer was personally responsible for the offences wiiich he condemned. Hero we might have thought that tlie mat ter should have ended, at least as far as Lord jilcuo and Sir Lewis Pelly wore concerned. It is true that the Duke of Arovll in exonerating Sir Lewis Felly of conduct and language unworthy of an Englishman and a Christian had only more emphatically brought the accusation to bear on Lord Lvttow himself, as,iudeed, it is clear from the context that he intended to do in his original speech. In the sentence immediately preceding tiio one we have quoted, the Duke said, 'I 'am sorry to eay that one consequence of these transactions is that in personal conlerences with ' t ho 1 rinces of India thoy can no longer trust that a V iceroy will treat theui with common fairness or u will quote their arguments with a decent regard ' 4 to accuracy.' With the taste or justice of this sweeping censure wo aro not concerned at present ; but it is evident that the words, as well as others in the same context, are directed against the Vice roy himself, and not against Sir Lewis Pelly , who was only his agent. Lord Eloho , however, was not content to accept the Duko's explanation in silence, and wrote to us a few days ago exulting in the fact that the Duke had made a mistake, and had followed it up by a retractation or denial. Lord Colin Ca-mflell now sends us a letter which he has written to Lord Elcho , explaining that his father has neither apologized nor retracted, and that nothing was further from his intention than to do either. So stands this unprofitable contro versy, and we can only hope that it will now end where it stands. The Duke of Aruvll is thought to have spoken unjustly of a parti cular p«rson ; he explains that he did nothing of the kind, and that his language, to which he still adheres, applies, and was meant to apply, to some ono elso. Uhus there is an end of tho matter as far as Sir Lkwis Pelly is concerned, and the only question remaining which is really worth a moment's consideration is whether such language as the Duke thought fit to uso is becoming his posi tion as an experienced and responsible statesman. Tho Duke of Argyll is by no means the only person of high station and responsible position who has imported an unwonted acrimony into recent political controversy, and especially into the dis cussions concerning tho policy of the Government in regard to Afghanistan. Tho Afghan question has brought to light even in this country all the deepest antagonisms of Indian official life. The Anglo-Indian community, if we may bo call it, lias been torn in two by a feud which strained the closest tics and threatened tho oldest friendships. As the question at issue happened to give rise to a great political controversy at home, we have had the spectacle of sedate and experienced officials, re spected fortheirprudonco,6agacity,and reticonce,and remarkable alike for their disregard of domestic poli tics and their indifference to English opinion on In dian affairs, vehemently taking sides and making the whole country ring with the clamour of their ap peals. Those who opposed the policy of tho Government seemed for the moment to have turned their backs on all the traditions of their official life, and never in recent times has a grave political question been debated with less reserve or with greater bitterness. If we are forced to blame chiefly those who declaimed against the war, it is because thoy wero loudest in their outcry and because, as experience has shown, thoy were very greatly in tho wrong. Not only were the intentions of the Government mistrusted and misrepresented and its good faith impugned, but wo were as sured that its policy was certain to end in swift and irreparable disaster. Afghanistan was unappeasably hostile and invincibly warlike, the passes were impenetrable, and Shere Ali would hurl tho hill tribes in a tempest of firo at our heads. Those who spoke thus doubtless spoke in all good faith, but they must now admit that the result has shown them to have been in the wrong. That thoy shouId make such an admission pub licly is hardly, perhaps, to bo expected, but the sharp lesson they have learned should teach them a littlo more caution and reticence and, perhaps, a littlo more charity for the future. After all, men who have spent their lives in the conduct of groat affairs should know and acknowledge that theiroppononts, however misguided thoy may think them, aro at least as upright as tliemselves. Even those who have most vehemently opposed tho Government and most openly impugned its motives may again be called to serve it in their several capacities, and some of them are certain sooner or later to take its place and to have to carry out the issues of its policy. Such a prospective responsibility cannot be divested of its correlative duties, and demands a reasonable reticence and moderation, and at least a charitable forbearance in the imputation of motive. Tbeso decent and necessary proprieties of political controversy have certainly been somewhat neglected of late by tho Duke of Argyll and his Anglo-Indian followers. But the time has come when a new departure can with advantage be made. We will not ask the opponents of the Govern ment on the Afghan question to admit that they havo been in the wrong, though it is certain that time has failed to justify them, but we may fairly ask them to let bygones be bygones, and to look on the future with hope and on the past with charity. \on the finances of Ind'« vwM' bufip forti sum i part} Fawi sion the d quart be no was li of K p ' do and 1 an ag twoei gang\ ceedt cett wor' nigl pare nell impi Sup] was ■ of t speei plain the the n mine abou the I whicl rest, new 1 brou^ realil propc of li subje recog think and t In a aator he s hoar* his a repb whei that aga the Bri A aut of it ci BtUi Coi Lov gest mea this then comi Mr. ] cal ox ' in thinl chanj curre this t vert 1 and i legal limit limit card' Low of th some is to in w peai cone was nece be tl Govt expe gold ciate&lt; one v less t notes Lowe conve to pre notes notioi value Tho i excee roallj rency Indh not a natur the r dimii Land in sil when 60 ru oblig notef inch of crea* the fror the con sist- too vag ten V Ind Wh devi bo c may dow tosti first in E asset 12 the the so ciaU said com or st arist chea this Two gold whih of In ciate chanj modi itself dence moreag oil any is bound j subsist. 4 it ia not ^osed.
