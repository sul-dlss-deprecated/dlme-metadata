I had been hoping for copy of the draft but learn from Dickson that none was left here by Jameson when he departed on 27th March . I understand he intends to endeavour obtain agreement other directors both British and American to proposal and then to return here to obtain Shaikh's formal acceptance. 2. Shaikh did not consult me during negotiations. I gather he treated Jameson, Dickson and Holmes to discourse on generosity of Americans as contrasted with the stinginess of British while reaffirming his loyalty to latter. He seemed pleased with result of negotiations. 3. Jameson indicated to me that 'if he had anything to do with it' Kuwait Oil Company would operate shortly. CQ LffgNT .

HOLMES 2. Dickson informs me that Holmes may repeat may have in mind an attempt to approach Sheikh in T.P.G. interest and to obtain for them permission to run a pipe-line through Kuwait territory issuing at KADHAMA from wells supposedely to be opened at JUBAL S. AN A’AM. In part return for this I.P.C. would, Dickson conjectures, supply Kuwait with fresh water from pipe which in any case they would lead to KADHAMA for ther own operations. 3. A second conjecture of Dickson’s is that Holmes is considering DOUBLE CROSSING A.P.O.C. by offering himself to A.A.O.C. in the ROLE of negotiator in their behalf for a concession in the Kuwait share of the Neutral Zone. 4. I have heard nothing else to support these con jectures but I share Dickson’s impression that Holme’s visit here has some specific object or objects other than the d developments described in my telegram No.254 April 1st. He has obtained a e-ae-e from (lunderstand)SKLIROS of I.P.C. and seems to spend time in making calls on local people. = Political =i CON FI DENTIAL. D.O.HO.C/295 Political Agency, Kuwait. 19th April, 1944. r l Dear Sir G-eoffrey, you will recall our conyersations during your stay Here fro^i the 13th to the 13th instant on the subject ox the ne^- series of payments 'by tn© Kuwait Oil Company of advances cf Boyalty to the Sha.Mch; and that you as iced me to send you copies of the correspondence between Jameson and the Gnaikh concerning them* I now enclose copies of 'Certified True Copies' of the lette^No. 150. lettei lated relevant letters sc noted in the margin. I am filing the 7th A 11 l*5 T?y art Hied True Copies” with my records. Tou will also remember that T expressed some doubt on the question as to whether the Company should have conducted their negotiations with ’one Shaikh in this matter through my self as Political Agent; andtaat you asked me to let you have a considered opinion on who question. The clause relative to it in the Political Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company; wnich I nad in mind; is !^q. 4 and reads as follows; 'One of the superior local anrployees of the Company shall be designated chief local representative of the Company in Kuwait. The approval of His Majesty*s Government shall be required for the person so designated. He will be ordinarily resident at Kuwait and will be responsible for the Company # 3 local relations with the Kuwait authorities* These local relations shall always be conducted through, the Political Agent at Kuwait, except as regards routine commercial business, which may be transacted through the official representative (if any) whom the lhaikh may appoint under the agreement between the Company and the Shaikh. It seems to me, on consideration, Quite fair to argue that this clause only concerns the 'local relations' of the I Company; that the arrangements regarding advances of Boyalty are not part of 'local relations*; and (as is in fact the case) that/that there is no other provision in the Political Agreement (or in the Commercial Agreement between the Company and the Shailch) making it incumbent on the Company to negotiate such arrangements through the Political authorities. We would not, therefore, have a strong case for insisting that, according to the letter of the agreements, the Company should negotiate through us. Hor, again after consideration, do I think that it is at all expedient or necessary that we should do so on general grounds. Ordinarily even we cannot touch oil and not be defiled. The fact that the Shaikh did not refer to me during these recent negotations may, I think, be taken to imply not that he distrusts the Political authorities, but that he trusts the Company in the person of Jameson well enough to be able to dispense with our advice; this is to the good. Further, this fact precludes the Shaikh from having any complaint against us if (which Cod forbid*) the new agreement should not turn out to his liking. The Company, as you know, informed me (withal very informally) of the result of the negotations thus admitting our ultimate directive right in their activities and their desire to have us on their side. This is also to the good. Finally, in this as in other similar cases, I believe that the parties concerned will come to us if they have ;iny trouble; and that, provided Government’s interests are not threatened, it is better to leave them alone if they do not do so. The other course - direct interference - is likely to saddle us with undesirable and unnecessary responsibilities for (occassion- ally) murky commercial transactions and, in the case of a man like the Shaikh, to cheapen our help in his eyes when it is preferred unasked. If you generally agree, then the only action now required is to send copies of the enclosures to His Majesty’s Government and to the Government of India for information.

The K.O.C. only requires to occupy the said buildings for a brief period (say six months in the first instance), in order to see them through the very real housing problem which they are now faced with in Kuwait, as a result of the recent influx of technical experts from Abadan in connection with the Company's oil development scheme, and the possible arrival of several more engineering and building experts in the future. Should you agree to the'K.O.C. taking over the buildings and outhouses in question, the Company readily undertakes to reserve the existing quarters of Captain Henderson of the I.W.T.

Vy dear Colonel Galloway, I enclose a brief note on the plans of the Kuwait Oil Company for oil production with special reference to their probably effect on local conditions. Yours sincerely, Lieutenant Colonel k. C. Galloway, O.B.S., The Hon # ble the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.C0N?ID5MTI'IL — (3&amp; KU .'.MT OIL CO ii J ANY ■ ^ DBYELQj’MgNT ?IAN . '' Part I. The Plea * &lt;^S^J 1. The Company was instructed in *pril last to take the necessary measures to produce 30»000 'barrels* of crude oil daily 'by ^ril 1946# For various reasons it is considered that this will not 'be possible am that crude oil cannot he produced until June. The plans which the Company have prepared involve : (a) The following increases in personnel : September 1945 January 1946 (Peak figure) Senior staff (British and American) 56 85 Junior Staff (mostly Indians) 54 64 Artisans (Indians, Iraqis or Persians) 80 120 Labour (local if possible) 500 630 Local contract labour 500 760 Total 1190 1659 The final figures when construction is completed will he somewhere between the two sets given above. (b) The unloading between now and the target date of 14,000 tons of equipment from the United Kingdom and the United States and 3,000 from Abadan, besides bringing 4,000 tons of sningle from subiya, and (c) The production of sufficient drinking water for employees. To do this two wells have been sunk at Dhulai and at al Awazim, 28 miles south west of Kuwait, and fairly sweet water has been found at a depth of 500 feet. Bach well produces 140 gallons per minute by air lift and more can be sunk if necessary. Unfortunately the doctors will not pass for drinking water with more than 800 parts of dissolved salts per million while that found has 3,732 parts salts of which 50 % is calcium sulphate. An evaporator is therefore essential and is required to arrive in September, m fact it cannot be shipped until January 1946 (see paragraph 11). 2. As the matter is being treated as a war project the production of Oil will be tackled first and the housing of staff and employees afterwards. In the meantime the present camp at Magwa will be expanded. 3. The method of production to be followed is that the oil from the Burgan field is to be pumped into tanks on the Dhahra ridge inland of Bahahil, in the neighbourhood of which an export loading terminal ’will be constructed. This camp will eventually be laid out in the same area on high ground over looking the sea, and a refinery, if one is built, will be / constructed * Thirtyfive Imperial gallons per barrel, seven barrels per ton.2 constructed near'by. 4. The pipelines (including 10i miles 10 inch, miles 22 inch and 1 mile 12 inch submarine, as well as nearly 80 miles of water pipelines mostly of small calibre) will be constructed by a unit of the Anglo Iranian Oil Company. Although upwards of 100 of the personnel will be Persians they will be self- contained and are expected to give no trouble. 5. The same may not be the case with the personnel of the Motherwell Bridge and Engineering Company who will construct the tanks. The most important tanks will be the four containing a total of 4.7 million gallons to be built at Bhahra. The men will be British rivetters and welders straight fro a the United Kingdom. PAST II. Local Repercussions . 6 . (See paragraph 1). His Highness will draw in the first year approximately £ 200,000 in royalties out of which he will have to pay back advance royalties drawn, so that the total paid to him may not actually be more than a million rupees. m the second year he ’will probably draw £ 390,000*. If this goes into his own pocket as at present and no attempt is made to share it with the State and to modernise the administration, I foresee serious constitutional troubles, rarticularly will this be the case as the receipt of royalties will probably coincide with the removal of British forces from Iraq and the cessation of the trade boom which has kept the town prosperous and the merchants busy and out of mischief in the last few years. 7. See paragraph 1 (a). The increased employment would, before the war, have been very welcome for its beneficial effect on local conditions. Now the position is reversed. All available labour is busy buildii g houses for profiteers and the rates being paid are fantastically high (unskilled labour annas twelve per day pre-war against Rs 5/- per day now). The demands of the Oil Company may well aggravate this as the amount of labour available is very small. I am in favour of the company importing labour if local labour is not forthcoming at a competitive rate and I anticipate that the State authorities can be persuaded to agree to this in their own interests. 8 . At present the State allows the Kuwait Oil Company labour . to draw two ration oards per man and the company are working on the assumption that this concession will be continued. The ration is thus brought up to. but not beyond, the Abadan ration in cereals and tea. I have informed the Company that I will, if necessary, press the State to continue the concession provided Kuwait secures additional supplies of tea and provided there is no reduction in the wheat quota. The company will then only have to import sufficient foods to bring the ration up to a balanced diet. 9. The number of Americans employed will probably not exceed twenty at a very generous estimate. 10. See paragraph 1 (b). It is doubtful if London can or will provide adequate unloading equipment and they are pressing the ' Kuwait Oil Company to utilise the services of the Kuwait Landing and Transportation Company. This Company has recently doubled its rates, bringing them up to the very high figure of Ps 20/- per ton (actual oost of unloading cargo ms 4/- per ton). Of the / profits These figures and those of the probable quantities of oil to t,e produce! have not yet been disclosed to Hie Highness.3 •profits 70 % are devoted to the State Hevanue, Public Health and education Departments in a similar manner to the division of the customs takings* A large proportion of the landing company’s charges are therefore nothing less than a camouflaged customs duty and the Kuwait Oil Company are exempt from paying customs. They are therefore at present trying to get the Landing Company to quote an economic rate for unloading and propose to make an ex-gratia payment of, say, £ 1,500 to the State Departments. Even if a satisfactory arrangement is made it is my opinion that it will he entirely beyond the Landing company to unload with reasonable dispatch the tonnage expected. 11. See paragraph 1 (c). The Kuwait Oil company will have to ask the Kuwait Water Company to tide them over with slightly more than one boom-load of water per day from September to March. This will require seven booms and should be possible at a price. 12. See paragraph 3. The company will use part of the area extending inland six miles from Abu Hulaifa in the north to Shiaiha in the south, but it has not yet been decided whether the final area to be selected (which will have a sea frontage of two miles and a depth of six miles) is to be north or south of Kahahil. The latter alternative will cause much less interference with houses and gardens but the sea conditions are possibly not quite so good. Kis Highness has agreed verbally not to permit the construction of new houses or the bringing into cultivation of new gardens in the whole of the area until the coa&amp;any have decided what land they want. He proposes that the limits of land at present occupied should not be surveyed now, preferring to present the occupiers with a fait accompli when the company have made their decision. It remains to be seen how he will arrange for the company tib buy out the occupiers at a reasonable figure. Kuwait, the 15th June, 194551 4 Telegram Code.

The Persian Government have recently prohibited the export of provisions from Abadan to the Kuwait Oil Company who are now working on the production of oil as an emergency war measure. Since the company’s stocks here will he exhausted by mid - August and supplies on order from the Nnited States of America cannot possibly arrive before November it will be necessary to disperse staff and suspend operations unless provisions are released from India. Supplies cannot be obtained from elsewhere in the Kiddle Past in tiie. 3. Requirements are as follows : 51- half 11 tons of imported provisions. 2 half 4 tons of Indian - made provisions. If necessary the Company is prepared to repay in kind the provisions of non - Indian origin when their stores arrive from the United States of \merica. Complete lists follow by air mail. 1 strongly recommend that a permit for immediate export be granted to the Aiglo Iranian Oil Company Agent, Rost Box 919, Bombay 1, as a special case in view of the importance of trie company’s work to the war effort.

(7^ Subject : dear Colonel, Right of the Kuwait Oil to unload cargo . Company ?lay I remind you of your verbal query in Khorramshahr on the 18th June on the subject matter of paragraph 10 of the enclosure to my demi official letter No. C/553 dated the 15th June, 1945 ? 2. I have discussed the question with Scott who maintains : (a) that the phrase 'the right to do all things necessary for the purposes of those operations' occurring in Article 1 of the Commercial Agreement covers the case in point and, further (b) that the words 'the right without hindrance to construct and to operate •••• ports, harbours, harbour works, wharves and jetties, .... and any other facilities or works which the company may consider necessary ....' (the underlining is mine) occurring in Article 5 (a) of the Commercial Agreement covers implicitly the unloading of ships. 3. Scott suggested that you might have in mind the penultimate sentence of Article 5 (A) of the Eastern Gulf Oil Company^ agreement with the Shaikh, which runs : - ♦ 'But the Company shall make the fullest use of the Kuwait Landing Company for its transport work that is possible and practicable, but the Company - having regard for the special nature of the mater ials to be handled - shall be sole judge of the transport work that must be carried out by the Company # s own equipment and personnel.' The Kuwait Oil Company, he assures me, would never have bound themselves to use the Landing Company except subject to some such saving clause as that which concludes the sentence quoted above. The landing Company was not in fact incorporated until late in 1938 after the agreement with the Kuwait Oil Company had been entered into. / 4. Lieutenant Colonel A. C.

Oil Compary requirements for the whole of 1945 will be forwarded to Government of India with other M.E. 3 .0. territorial program ty December, 1944. (d) 0 1 Companies vail _^lace orders against this programme as required. Ho territorial import licences need be demanded by Government of iii.aia oexore export licences are granted but export licences so granted will be set against the Oil Company’s procurement programmes as agreed by department of Commerce, Hew Delhi. Eor th s purpose it appearspreferable that applications for export licences should be made direct to lev/ 'Delhi. (e) In order to provide for unforseen emergencies it is suggested that ad hoc demands for. commodities not included in the forward ^rogramme or for quantities in excess of those programmed be made on certification by the petroleum Division representative, Cairo, or Baghdad, as specified in part II paragraph 2 of Government of India’s telegram : 0.32 Government of India io allow exports against these demands to the extent to which the supply position in India permits, ^gain it would seem preferable if such ad hoc demands were made to Department of Commerce, raw Delhi, direct but that is a matter for Government of India to decide. 4. In connection with the operation of the procedure detailed above the follov/ing points should be noted. (a) The Lesc. procurement programmes for 1S44 have not taken into consideration Oil Company r equi remen ts except in specific cases such as tea cfond cotton piece goods for n. I.C.C. native labour where Persian Government has agreed to an a location from Persian quota direct to I.C.C. for distribution to Persian native labour, this allocation doe snot however, cover tentage and tarpaulins v/hi ch were previously considered a technical requirement. It must be emphasized therefore that i.D.i.C. cannot accept responsibility for oil Company requirements for 19^4 from existing allocations for Middle East territories and that every endeavour will have to be made to meet the requirements scheduled in the additional programme for 2nd half of 1944 which is to be submitted to Government of India before Tune 1944 over and above present ].:.D. allocations. (b) procurement programme from Companies will be passed to M.C.3.C. through petroleum Divis on Representative, Baghdad or Cairo who will certify the essentiality of the demands. K.E.b.C. will co-ordinate the programmes and scrutinise them with a view to removing any items vhich appear on Government of India’s prohibit ied list or are known to be in very short shpply. (c) Cnee the procurement programme has been forwarded to Government of India, who will notify the Centre of any comments, it is not considered necessary that individual indents from the Oil Companies against these rogra mes should pass through M.3.S.C. These individual indents could if Government of India consider desirable be certified by Petroleum Division Representative but as the programmes as a whole will have been certified we think this further certification unnecdssary. Indents for emergency requirements not covered by the forward programme would of course be certified by Petroleum Division Representative a^d treated as ad hoc demands. ( (d&gt; The Companies at present affected by this proposal are xnglo-Iran fan Oil Company. Iraq petroleum Company, Arabian-, user lean Oil Company (former ly C.A.S.O.C.' xnglo-Egyptian Oilfields, Bahrain petroleum Coma nay (at request of Government of India). V/e are investigating whether there are arc,' other Oil Companies who have in tfie past been drawing requirements direct from India but petroleum Division Representatives do not consider this likely.i 5. It i&amp; felt that this tubject has in the past been treated in a piecemeal fashion in order to cope with difficulties as th Qj arose. It is considered that tne sche^.e detailed above would provide a stacle bo.si&amp; foi handling all requirements of Oil Companies on India ana provide Government of India with a consolidated forward^ programme which can be used for purposes of and allocation of materials in short supply. 6. ,/ould London and Government of India please let us have their comments on this proposal urgently so that we can advise oil Companies to submit programmes for 2nd half of 1944 to us through ietroleum division Representatives in order that we may pass them to Government of India before the beginning of June 1944. 7. This procedure has been drawn upto provide the Government of India v/ith a consolidated programmes of Oil Company re^u rements frojm India. It should, however, be emphasised t^hat indents for all sup £ lie s „ t o be drawn from other loading areas whether technical requirements or non-technica 1 r equireme nts of European staff will continue to be forwarded by the Companies direct to Head Office in London or America for recommeidat ion by petroleum Division loiidon or United 3totes petroleum Administration which ever is appropriate.OFFICLS C'? .*1^. 0_-l To i o. 9-7.t.

In Peel’s letter No.PZ.2333/40 of the 18th May, 1940 to Kemp of the Kuwait Oil Company it was stated that the Sheikh cannot grant any exclusive or non-exclusive rights over any area lying outside his territorial waters. In this connection we understand from Kemp that the United States Government have recently claimed oil exploitation rights on the continental shelf cf America up to a depth of 100 fathoms and that the Bahamas (Government have granted an oil concession covering non-territorial waters up to a depth of 10 fathoms. The Kuwait Oil Company would, I understand, like to know what effect these apparent precedents will have on the Sheikh of Kov/eit’ s right to grant exclusive or non-exclusive rights over areas lying outside the three-mile limit of territorial waters. The Company are naturally anxious to safeguard their own position against the possibility of a concession covering the Sheikh* s ex-territorial waters being granted to any other company, but are not, I understand, themselves particularly anxious to drill in such waters at present. K.L. Stock, Esq., Petroleum Division, Ministry of Fuel and Power Millbank, S.W. 1, A14^’ 2 . should be glad to have your observations on the statements regarding recent action by the United States and Bahamas Government s mentioned in paragraph 2 above and for your opinion whether this is likely to have any effect on the Sheikh of Koweit’s right to grant concessions outside the three-mile limit. 4.

We do not consider that either the recent United States proclamation with regard to the subsoil and sea bed of the continental shelf or the case of the Bahamas have altered the legal position and for the present our views are still as stated in paragraphs 3(a) and (b) of .Baggallay’s letter to Peel No.E.405/19/91 of 2nd ^arch, 194 0. 3. The position remains therefore as stated in Peel's letter to Kecqp, No. P.2.2333/40 of 18th May. At the same time, we feel that the question of Kuwait might well oe considered in relation to the general question of His Majesty's Government's future policy in regard to the subsoil under the sea outside territorial waters, with special reference to the united Btates proclamation of policy. un this general question we are thinking of asking for an interdepartmental meeting early in the New Year at which we hope, of course, that the india Office would be representad.

Dear Donaldson, l would refer you to your letter of the 17th .November raising the question of the huwait Oil Company’s earlier interest in an oil concession in waters outside the territorial limits of huwait in view of recent developments in America and in the Bahamas affecting oil development in extra-territorial waters. i have deferred replying to this until now as Freese-Pennefather agreed that this issue raised matters of general policy in vfoich the Foreign office were directly concerned, both as regards oil and other activities, and you will now have received his letter of the 4th January. From the point of view of this Ministry, we are in sane difficulty in replying to your question, since we are not fully aware of h.M.G.’s considered view on the action taken by the United States Government in their re cent declaration which concerned not only oil but fisheries and mineral development on their continental shelf. i should mention, however, that the u.S#G. have not claimed oil exploitation rights, but rather tVie right to control oil exploitation in these extra - territorial waters. until the interdepartmental meeting suggested by Freese-Pennefather has been held, l do not think we can be more precise in reply to your question. Apart from the clarification of our attitude towards the American action, there are, of course, also political issues associated with any extension of oil activities beyond Kuwait’s territorial waters. underwater development m the Persian Gulf should be arranged on a basis mutually agreed between the various littoral states, but it seems likely that this will be difficult to achieve in practice. i i am sending copies of this letter to Freeae- Pennefather and Mossop.

H.W.A.Freese-Pennefather Foreign office Mr. Beckett opened the meeting by explaining the position under the agreement which we had contemplated making between ourselves and the united States with regard to tne bahamas, whereoy each of the two parties would refrain from endeavouring to acquire by occupation the sub soil beneath the sea immediately adjacent to the territorial waters of the other leaving the latter free to do so. The Americans had been thinking along the same lines with regard to the subsoil adjacent to United States territorial waters and on 28th September President Truman had issued a Proclam ation ( copy at ta che d) extending American jurisdiction over the sub-soil adjacent to the whole length of their coast. The Americans, in fact, had done unilaterally what we were proposing to do by agreement, and their action had already had repercussions in Mexico and other countries, which regarded the proclamation as a useful precedent and, in the case of Mexico, had already used 1 1 as such. we should therefore consider what our line should be. Should we: (i) Complain of the American action, putting in reservations etc. (ii) Bo nothing, or (iii) Take positive action ourselves with a view to establishing our position not only in the Bahamas but else where as well, following the American example? As regards (i), we would not be likely to alter what has now become the declared policy of the united States and indeed our policy with regard to the Bahamas was designed to achieve a similar result in the m limited area to which it related. As Kuwait and other countries, for whose interests we were responsible, would require a lead from us as to whether they should use the American action as a precedent, we clearly could not adopt the alternative of doing nothing, whatever other merits, if any, this course might have. it remained, theref ore, to see whether it would not suit our book to follow the American lead ourselves and make some public pronouncement indicating that we approved its general principles in international law. / AA discussion followed on the precise implications of President Truman’s proclamation and Mr. Beckett pointed out that it amounted in effect to a claim by the Americans of no tiling less than full sovereignty over the sub-soil in the area in question-, although the word “sovereignty*’ did not appear in the document itself. The proclamation referred to the Continental ohelf as being “an extension of the land mass of a coastal national and thus naturally appertinent to it'. This, and the argumentation of tae p&gt;rocTarnation as a whole, indicated quite clearly that it was not intended merely as a claim to ownership of the natural resources of tiie sub-soil, but that the united otates Government regarded themselves as thereby entitled to exercise full severe ign rights, as a result of which they could e.g. issue the licenses for exploitation, make arrangements for policing etc. in whatever way they chose, precisely as on land. While this policy might be simple to carry out in the western hemisphere, where the geographical and political questions were reasonably straight forward, it was evident that if we adopted this policy ourselves there would be areas (notably the Persian GulfJ in which its implementation would be likely to give rise to certain com plications. in the Persian Gulf, for instance, there was no limit to the “Continental Shelf' at all and the boundaries between the areas over which the various states would exer cise sovereignty of this kind would have to be agreed between the states concerned in accordance with “equitable principles'*, and the present conflict of interests and territorial claims in that area was such that agreement in many cases would be difficult to reach. The American proclamation, however, specifically made provision for such cases being dealt with in this manner (in the penultimate sentence of the document] and we could only hope for the best as regards the success of its application as and when each case came up for con sideration. Except in the important Persian Gulf area, the lifte of delimitation should not be difficult to define in most cases, and on balance, we should stand to gam much more than we should lose by expressing our agreement with the American policy and .by adopting its principles ourselves as it might* suit us best in each area cone erne d. The meeting therefore agreed in the following: (1) That it appears that the oest policy for His Majesty's Government to adopt would be publicly to recognise that the principles contained in the United States proclamation with respect to natural resources of the sub-soil and sea bed of the Continental Shelf are sound and of general application, it would be preferable to issue a public statement recognising these principles than for Bis Majesty's Government immediately to issue a similar proclamation applying these principles legislatively to all “British' territory since the drafting of such a general proclamation would at once involve questions as to whether it should be extended to protected states and other dep/andencies whose position is somewhat complicated. (2) That if (1) is approved and acted upon, the Governor of the Bahamas and the Governor of Jamaica might make proclama tions applying these principles to the sea bed adjoining the Bahamas and Jamaica respectively. These two cases seem to be clear since the geographical situation is exactly similar to tfeiat off the coast of the United states and they are moreover in the same general geographical area. / (3]/vs [ 3 / That an investigation should be begun immediately ^ as the application of these principles in other parts of th~ world. in particular the case of the Persian Gulf seems to Persian Gulf is so shallow that the whole of it might he considered to beacont inental shelf within the meaning of the united States proclamatlonand therefore as an area where the sharing of the shelf between the Adjacent states should he determined on equitable principles. in this connection the claims to jurisdiction over the bed of the sea over pearl fisheries might be taken into consideration. [ 4) Particular attention is directed to the last sentence of the united States proclamation that the character as high seas of the water above the continental shelf and tVieii ,w right to free and unimpeded navigation are in no way affected. in Hus connection possibly submarine cables which merely touch the bottom might be considered rather to be in the water than on the surface. ^5) Supposing that the conclusions above are adopted, it would seem desirable that before any action is taken the Governments of India and the Dominions should be informed or consulted and no doubt the Poreign office would also consult the iiinbassy at Washington and indeed any other of its missions which it is thought desirable*. Purther, it may be argued that since the free and unimpeded right of navigation is recognised and is already in existence, any constructions made above the sea bed for the purposes of exploitation of minerals below, it must be such as not to impede navigation. The application of have been obtained, the answer to the application of the huwait Oil Company can be considered and agreed. this point in the Persian Gulf may^somewhat^be important.

Sir, I have the honour 'to refer to the correspondence resting with my memorandum No.C/22'4 of the 13th April. 1943 and to say that Major.Holmes informed me in conversation the other day that General Pyron had, during his recent visit to Kuwait, broached the question to His Highness of a concession in the Neutral zone and also of one to cover the subsoil adjacent to the coast of Kuwait territory. 2. I asked His Highness later whether General Pyron had made any proposals with regard to the Neutral Zone and the Ruler told me that he had refused to discuss the question. I also mentioned to His Highness that I had heard that General Pyron had some experience of oil production from sea areas (in the Los Angeles - Catalina island area I believe) and asked him wl^etnei he had mentioned the possibility of boring in the subsoil beneath the sea. I did not distinguish between territorial waters or those outside territorial limits. His Highness replied, intention ally I thinks vaguely that there had been some talk of the sea areas and waived it aside as of no consequence. 3. General Pyron will, I believe, be returning in the autumn and I think we should be correct in assuming that the Gulf Oil Corporation is definitely interested in the possibility of operations in the subsoil area adjacent to Kuwait territory. His Highness was, quite clearly, not anxious to discuss details of General Fyron’s conversations and I regret I was unable to obtain more detailed information of what did transpire at his meetings with the Ruler. Major Holmes informed me, for what it is worth, that he was not working for General Pyron or Mr. Hamilton but volunteered the information that they had asked him to meet them en route to Kuwait.

SubjectFuture constitution and activit ies of th e Kuwait Qi-i Co « The following emerged from a confidential discussion with Mr. C.A.P. Southwell, Director of the Kuwait Oil Company, on the 27th June, 1946. 2. The Kuwait Oil Company, staff, offices, etc., in London are to be separated from those of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and Southwell is to be Managing Director on the new board, which consists, apart from him, of three British and throe Americans. 3. Whereas originally It was intended to consolidate the developments at present under way before expanding further.it has ^ now been decided to push on at a maximum speed with a greatly enlarged drilling programme. He was unable to say what^the increase in personnel would be but instead of the n 2 rig * drilling programme originally planned there was to be a rt 6 rig ” one. It is not possible yet to give any idea of the increase in production expected. (The scheme just completed is for 30,000 barrels a day or 2,000,000 odd tons a year.) 4. The biggest bottle-neck at present is housing. The build ing capacity of Kuwait is being utilised to its utmost and is sti]/ incapable of constructing more than a fraction of the houses required by the Company. It is understood that it is proposed to bring in some Indian firm of contractors to erect buildings using Indian masons, carpenters, fitters, etc., and Indian labour to such an extent as may be necessary. 5. Although the decision has not yet been formally taken a refinery will be built. It will not refine all the crude pro duced but enough for local demands and those of shipping etc. 6. All this will mean a large increase in personnel, of which the drillers will be largely American, and in the local activity of the Company. \ Political Agent, Kuwait M.B.■•UIJI nil —r*- D&gt;0.

Clause 3 of the Political Agreement should also be seen. 2. Would you kindly let me have your views on the proposal to import Indian contractors and labour. i do not imagine any of the neighbouring Arab countries could produce labour except possibly Iraq and 1 have no idea to what extent labour would be available from that country. i see no objection to your consulting the bh&amp;ikh very tentatively if you think it desirable to do so.D.0,No.g/501 I !

The question of labour for the Kuwait Oil Company has more then once come up in conversation v/ith TTis Highness and Abdulla Mulla, and I here tried, without giving emiy the Company’s plans^to prepare them for the proposal to import foreign labour. 3. At present they do not realise the magnitude of the problem and are convinced that there is ample labour in Kuwait - Abdulla !-uiia says he turns nway everyday 30 or 40 applicants for unskilled employment with the Kuwait Oil company - but they real ise that if foreigners must come in the best would be the subjects of other (lulf States, and after them Indians. 4. The import of Persian labour would be eminently un desirable and of ’Iraqis hardly less so; whereas the high cost of living in the Middle East makes the employment of labourers from other Arab countries (except the Persian 0-ulf) prohibitively expensive. 5. I have suggested to the Oil Company that their best plan would be to try and engage the artisans, local or Indian, paid off after the completion of the construction work in Bahrain and at Has Tanurn. They would gain by getting men who were used to the conditions, who had experience of similar work, and who had already been tried and proved by other companies. I think that they are adopting this suggestion and Chase leaves shortly for Bombay to carry it out. 6. In general I see no objection to the employment of Indian contractors and artisans, and of Indian labour provided the Shaikh is c mvinced tha* the local labour narmat has been given the first opportunity to supply the Comoany’s demands.

Bear Gage* Would you please refer to your letter No.AN. 1739/307/45 of 9th July on the subject of the Continental Shelf* 2* Our doubts as to the desirability of taking immediate action* whether by some general declaration of H.M.G.'s approval of the principle of the U.S .prol/camation or by the limited action of the issue of an Order in Council applying the principle to the Bahamas and Jamaica, have arisen from a desire not so much to postpone any action in regard to the Persian Gulf as to avoid queering our pitch there by committing ourselves to the principles of the U.S. proclamation before all the implications have been worked out. The issue is a far bigger one in the Persian Gulf than in the West Indies. It seems to us that the prospects of the riparian States of the Gulf coming to any agreement as to the division of the sea bed in accordance with 'equitable principles” as laid down by President Truman are very remote, and the Persian claim to Bahrain ^not to mention her more shadowy claims to the other Shaikhdoms) will impose serious obstacles in the way of reaching agreement with Persia even on a dividing line down the middle of the Gulf between Persia on the eastern or northern side and Saudi Araoia and H.M.G. (on behalf of the Arab Shaikhdoms) on the western or southern side* in the absence of any agreement as to the division of the sea bed it will be difficult, if we commit ourselves to accepting that the application of equitable principles shall be deter mined in agreement with the State or States concerned, to take any unilateral action in the Persian Gulf by my, for example, of approving the grant of an oil concession by one of the Arab rulers over an area outside territorial waters which in our opinion clearly ought to fall to him, or of taking steps by physical occupation to strengthen the claims of one or other of the Shai.&lt;hs to islands outside the three- mile limit whose status is at present undetermined (please see in this connection my letter to ffarrell of the Ministry offuel and Power dated 25th June enclosing memoranda on the status of certain island s in the Persian Gulf). It would at the same time make it difficult for us to contest any claims by the Persians for complete soveBignty over the sea bed and islands in their half of the Gulf. x t appears from your letter that the Foreign Office are inclined to discount the suggestion that H.M.G. would be committing themselves to the world-wide application of President Truman’s proclamation by the issue of an Order-in- Council proclaiming sovereignty over the submarine shelves around the Bahamas and Jamaica. To do so, however, would be a departure from the view expressed in the first sentence of paragraph 9 of the Draft Cabinet Paper with which this Department wishes to associate itself. The issue of the proposed Order-in-Council would in our opinion almost certainly precipitate Persian claims backed no doubt by strong Russian support to considerable areas of the bed of the Gulf, including Bahrain. The problem is the Gulf would thus be B.E.ff.Gage, Esq.* Foreign Office* S.W.l.** 2 — immediately projected into the Political arena before we had time to obtain the full technical information that will be needed in order to determine our policy in the matter. Moreover, we see no practical advantage in the foreign Office proposal from the point of view of the licences already granted by the Jamaican and Bahaman Governments. As we understand it the Shelves on which these two colonies stand consist of separate submarine islands. If this is so, it seems inconceivable to us that any oil company could drill for oil in these areas without having first been granted a base on one of the islands themselves from which to operate. Consequently, the likei-ihood that any foreign interest v*ould challenge the right of the colonial government concerned to issue prospecting licences in these areas seems to us to be remote in the extreme. But should the improbable occur, it will surely be time enough then for us to consider whether to meet the challenge by the issue of an Order-iu-Council* Until that time arises our strong recommendation is that the position should be left on a be facto basis. 4. I should add that the^e views are exp res ed after consultation with the Political Resident and the Government of ind i£. and 1 enclose for your information a copy of the telegrams exchanged with them. 5* I am sending copies of this letter to the recipients of yours.

You will recall that at the meeting held in this Department on the 17th Mayt to discuss a draft Cabinet paper proposed by the foreign Office, the general opinion of the meeting appeared to be that a decision on what action should be taken should be postponed pending the clarification of the position { i) with regard to the Bahamas and Turks and Ce-icos Islands and (ii) the Persian liulf • A copy of an amended version of the minutes of this meeting is enclosed. 2. Before making up our minds ag to what the next step should be we are anxious to be ciuite clear about the views of tne Departments most closely concerned in this matter m the light of the further considerations set out below. 3. The draft Cabinet paper proposed by the Foreign Office recommended {a.) the annexation of the Continental Shelf round the Bahamas and Jamaica by Order-in-Council and (b) the leaving over until later of the exact applic ation of the principle involved to other areas such as the Persian Gulf where in fact, the Continental ^ielf stretches across the bed of the entire sea. From the record of the meeting of the 17th Way, it seems that the meeting was hesitant and adopted the course referred to in paragraph 1 above on two grounds? namely ii) the issue of an Order-in-Council might precipitate the question in the Persian Gulf before we were quite ready to deal with it and (ii) there wan no urgency to secure the position round Jamaica and the BahamaB. 4. On further consideration we are doubtful whether either of these two reasons is, in fact, valid. As regards the Persian Gulf, it v^ts admitted at the meeting of the 17th May that this question would boil up soon anyway and we doubt whether the time when this happens will be affected in one way or another by the • issue of an Order-in-Co unci 1 as regards the Bahamas and Jamaica* #'e feel that by issuing an Order-in-Council His Majesty’s Government would be simply adopting in the Western Hemisphere the United States principle of the Contiaental Shelf and doing so in a case where the geo graphical implications of the principle are perfectly clear. The action proposed in the draft Cabinet paper would not add anything to the United States’ action already taken so far as the Persian Gulf is concerned. 5. in regard to the Bahamas and Jamaica, we have consulted Beckett who does not feel able to indicate whether the position will be endangered by delay, but triinks that legally the position is at present not safe. If licences have been issued by the Bahamas or Jamaica Governments for the exploitation of oil outside terri torial waters but on the Continental Shelf, these licences can, so far as we can see, have no legal force since they are given in respect of territory which is not at present under the jurisdiction of the Crown at all. The territory would only come under the jurisdiction of the Crown by virtue of the issue of an Order-in- Council. F.A#K. Harrison Esq., India Off ice.- 2 - ( !&amp; 6, The argumen tsrnadvanced above seem to us to dispose of the two grounds on which, in our opinion, the meeting of the 17th May hesitated to recommend approval of the draft Cabinet paper, Subject to the views of the other Departments concerned, therefore, we should now be prepared to recommend that the draft Cabinet paper should go forward to the Cabinet, We should also be quite ready simultaneously and at once (a) to find out what the Resident in the Persian Gulf thinks as to tactics in that area, and [b) to start trying to work out a joint policy in that area with the United States, 7, I shall be grateful to receive the opinion of your Department on the views expressed in this letter. 8, I am sending a similar letter to Stock, Ministry of tfuel and Power, and Monson Colonial Office and a copy to Dodds, Admiralty, Chisholm, Burma Office, and Macleod, Dominions Office, for their information.

India Office. Burma Office. Dominions Office. Economics Relations Dept., Foreign 0ifi&lt; M.E• Secretariat, Foreign Office. Eastern Dept., Foreign Office. Foreign Office. North American Dept. The Chairman briefly explained that the reason for summoning a meeting was to discuss the draft paper for the Cabinet. He explained that for the reasons given in para graph 7 of the draft paper, the Secretary of State had thought it better to suggest the limited action proposed in the Paper rather than the issue of a general declaration approving and adopting the principles of the United States’ declaration• Mr. Dodds said that tne Admiralty were content with the action proposed. Mr. Greenhi 11 had no comments to offer. Mr. Baker referred to the last sentence of paragraph 10 where it was suggested that action in the case of the Persian Gulf should be deferred, and pointed out that the real prob lem here was to get the sea bed satisfactorily divided. There would probably be difficulties with Persia regarding the sovereignty of Bahrain, which presumably would be one of the main areas of interest, and perhaps we ought now to push ahead with our consideration of the problem in the Gulf, on the basis of equitable principles. ihe Chairman replied that it was difficult to say what the effect in the Persian Gulf of determining the boundary of the sea bed in accordance with equitable principles would be, but that it would in any event be necessary to know first the relevant facts applicable in regard to the area under dispute. Mr. Monson said that the Colonial Office welcomed the form of the paper because of the special problems which would be created by an examination of the sovereignty over the sea bed adjacent to mandated territories and protected States. The problems involved in such territories were complicated and the Colon ia 1 off ice would prefer not to raise them unless there was any direct and concrete necessity to doso. Mr. Macleod agreed with the form of the paper.lir. Gandy said that he could see no particular purpose oeing served by hurrying on hie action proposed. Mr. Stock said that he felt that the proposed limited action was one of halfway house which might immediately raise the question of the general principle in other parts of the world, including the Persian Gulf. if on account of political complications it appeared inadvisable to go ahedd and declare our policy in the matter all over the world might it not be better to hold our nand altogether for the time? The _de fac to position in rhe Bananas seemed satis factory; licences had been granted to British and American oil companies uhi ch cover areas extending beyond the three- mile limit and the legality of their rights bad not been questioned so far nor did it seem likely that it would be. Presumably similar administrative arrangements could be made in the Turks and Caicos Islands. The Ministry of Puel were particularly interested in the issues which might very likely be raised in other parts of the world if v.e showed our hand either by a general declaration or by an Order-in- Cooncil limited in its application to the sea bed round the Bahamas. There was a good deal to be said for dealing with the continental shelf question area by area as occasion aorse, but if we proceeded on these lines we should be prepared in advance for enquiries as to toe attitude of His Majesty 1 s Government on submarine development in, for instance, the Persian Gulf* The Kuwait Oil Company and the Anglo-^ran ian Oil Company had already evinced interest in the oil poss ibilities in the sea bed of the Persian Gulf. Mr* Chisno Im had no comments to make. Mr. Harrison was inclined to agree with Mr. Stock and thought tnat the disadvantages involved in taking action by Order-in-Council out-weighed the advantages. If the prin ciples were raised with regard to the Persian Gulf the Persian claim to Bahrain would doubtless cause a great deal oi trouole, especially-i as the present Persian Government might receive Russian support. It was desirable that we should avoid trouble at the moment and he wondered whether trie limited action proposed was really essential or whether we could not more successfully make an ad hoc arrangement with the United States. Mr. Stock agreed that it would be valuable to b is cuss informally with the U.S. Government how their continental shelf principle could be applied to the Persian Gulf 'on an equitable basis'. as regards the immediate problem in the West Indies he enquired whether the de facto position could be formalised by any other means than an Orcfeer-in-Counc il under a 'United Kingdom Act. Mr. ironson pointed out that an Order-in-Counci 1 was the only obvious method of legislating in this matter since the authority of local legislatures was confined to the territorial limits of any particular Colony and carried with it no jurisdiction in respect of the sea oed.outside the generally accepted limits of territorial waters. The Chairman then put forward the suggestion in another way and asked whether there wag anything to lose by waiting. Mr. Stock said that he thought things would move quickly during the next ten years* Methods had be^n developed of prospecting for oil in the sea bed with geophysical equipment in aircraft and in submarines while production was already feasible by drilling in 10 fathoms of water. The Cnairman pointed out the possibility of other governments or companies attempting by occupation to establish a claim to areas of the sea bed in which His Majesty’s Government was vitally interested, and, in this connection,that it would be necessary to establish what should be the 'evidence of occupation' which might be considered sufficient to support a claim to sovereignty, What would nuppen if someone started 'occupying 11 the sea bed outside the limit of territorial waters off Jamaica and the Bahamas? Mr, Stock thought it improbable that offshore occupation could be effected by an oil company in defiance of the wishes of the mainland authority. The United States Governments f declaration would make it difficult for American com anies to gatecrash and in general other countries were unlikely to have the necessary technical resources for submarine oil exploitation In the case of the Persian Gulf he drev. attention to the fact that most if not all. the oil conces ions on the Arabian coast were granted in respect oi the whole territory of the local Ruler? if the Ruler’s dominions were to be extended as a result, for instance, of the partitioning of the sea bed of the Persian Gulf the present concessionaire could probably assert his right to a corresponding extension ? f his concession area. In the ab£.ence of a partition scheme there would be equal opportunity for anyone to start oil operations in the sea oed of the Persian Gulf though he would, of course, need facilities for a shore base from one of the mainland Rulers. It was not possible to say how sojii under-water oil develop ment might become a live issue in the Persian Gulf, but the difficulties that would arise if tilings wore left +o run their course needed to be weighed against the difficulties of securing amicable internationu. 1 settlement in advance. Mr, Harrison suggested that it might be possible to come to an ad hoc agreement with the United Sta tes and avoid becoming involved with the lersians. In other words, our interests were really against our talcing the action. At this point Mr. Gage made reference to the minutes of the meeting in January and pointed out that if it was decided to do no tiling we snould be reversing the decision then taken to recognise the validity of the principles contained in the United States declaration and take positive action in regard to jfcuKL&amp;si. Jamaica and the Bahamas. The Chaiman thereupon said that it seemed that the political advantages of doing nothing might outweigh those of making a formal claim. Mr. Gage thought that the criterion seemed to be, aa Mr. Stock had out it, whether we were likely to be better off (l) by taking the limited action proposed with regard to the Bahamas and Jamaica, and thereby approving the general principle implici ly, (2) by openly approving the general principle or (3) by postponing the whole iseue pending further enquiries. If (2) was agreed upon the proposal would be put up to the Secretary of State again with supporting reasons. The Chairman summed up the position by putting the question in the fonn: should we be prejudicing our position in the »Vest Indies, at the moment regulated by the granting of licences to the oil companies, by doing nothing? If the answer to this question was no, then in view of the present situation in Persia was it advisable now to take the action proposed in the draft paper for the Cabinet? It was agreed ( i) that the Ministry of Puel and Power would consider ascertaining from the British Oil Companies con cerned with submarine oil development in the West Indies whether in fact they were uneasy about their present legal position; (ii) that the Colonial Office would consider whether there would be serious disadvantages in taking no further action to formalise the de facto position in respect of oil development beyond the three-mile limit in the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands; (iii) that the Poreign Office would meantime give cobs id era t ion to consulting with the United States with a view to securing some fora of joint approach to the difficulties in the area of the Persian Gulf.Telegram Fr®m To Repeated No.16453.

Dear Harrison, With further reference to my letter of the 50th July about the oil reserves of Kuwait, I have at last heard from the Coospary in reply to my query. The Managing Director is extremely guarded in the information he gives and merely states that the Burghan field appears to be one of the largest so far discovered in the world and therefore the Sheikh's income from oil royalties is likely to continue for a very long time. As regards the actual payments made to the Sheikh, these should amount in 1947 to about £600,000. If production builds up in this area in future years the Company state that royalties Bight reach even 6 times this figure but at this early stage in the producing life of the field they are unable to indicate when this will be. I hope this will be of use to you although so indefinite; I do not think it would be possible at this stage to obtain from ary source more definite information. As a matter of interest, I might say that the generally accepted estimate of reserves for Kuwait is 600 million tons. Tours &lt;&amp;c. , (Sd) J.W.Farrell.

Copies forwarded with compliments to The Political Agent, Kuwait. ME 1C.AP. SOUTHWELL 1 Great Cumberland Place, London, W.l ( Dear Sir Rupert 4th Febs&amp;alT 1948 Febmia i v/y^ You will probably have heard from Donaldson of the Commonwealth Relations Office that we have been considering the question of the appointment of a Manager at Kuwait in succession to the late Mr.T.E. Patrick and that we have provisionally selected for this post Mr.L.T. Jordan of the Gulf Oil Corporation of America. I thought, however, that you might like to know something about Mr.Jordan and, in particu lar, to be informed of his qualifications and experience in the oil industry. Mr. Jordan was born in 1906 in Texas and was educated at the Lufkin Grammar and High Schools. Later he attended the Texas College where he took a degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1929. In June of the same year he was employed by the Venezuela Gulf Oil Company (a subsidiary of the Gulf Oil Corporation) as a Petroleum Engineer. From 1931 to 1935 he served as a production engineer in this company and gained experience in drilling and other production operations. In 1937 he was made Assistant Field Superintendent in charge of drill ing, construction and production in the Taparito field, and shortly afterwards was promoted to Chief Production Engineer in charge of the company's Lake Maracaibo operations. Mr.Jordan became Assistant District Manager of the Venezuela Gulf Oil Company in 1939 and in 1945 was made District Manager of the company's Western Venezuelan operat ions . Mr. Jordan has no experience of conditions in the Middle East but, in view of the nagnitude of our development programme at Kuwait, you will, I am sure, appreciate the emphasis which we must place at this stage on technical qualifications and experience. It is of particular importance that our Manager should possess the specialised knowledge of the peculiar problems connected with oil production from large sand structures such as those which exist at Kuwait. Mr.Jordan has this knowledge and his qualifications both in the technical sphere and in general management are exceptional. 'Political Agreement' but that it has not been possible at this time for us to find a Manager from British sources whose qualifications and experience for the problems ahead could be considered as adequate. I would add that I have mentioned to Donaldson that in making the selection we had in mind our obligations under Article 3 of the Yours sincerely, Sd/- C.A.P. Southwell The Hon. Lt.Col.

We 'have taken this matter up with the Ministry, t who have now informed us that it so happens that they have been able to allocate to the Company a consignment of thirty tons of frozen meat which has come to hand at Basrah. This will represent a net addition to the present allocation for the January - June period - which as you point out, provides for a ration of 8 oz a day - and should, therefore, they think amply cover the Company's full requirements. The question of the allocation for the July - December period is now under consideration by the Ministry in consultation’with the Ministry of Fuel and Power end in the light of the points made in your letter. Yours sincerely, R.G. Dundas. Middle East Secretariat.

Dear Burrows, I have been informed by the lecal management of the Kuwait Oil Company that Messrs. Spinneys have recently been refused a permit for the export of beef by the Ministry of Food on the grounds that the consumption of meat by members of the Company in Kuwait must be cut down to 8 oz. a day. 2. The Company point out that under the terms of their contracts they cannot reduce the meat ration of their American employees In this manner and that it would create an impossible situation if they were to reduce the rations of their British employees only. 3. An allowance of 8 oz. of meat a day must seem lavish to those in the United Kingdom but the argument produced by the Company above carries great weight. Further it must be remembered that the employees of the Oil Companies in taese parts are engaged in a most important industry and that, in Kuwait especially, where the construction of their camp has only Just started, they have to work for the greater part of the year in the most appalling conditions of dust and heat with few, if any, amenities. In these circumstances they should at least be well-fed. 4. I have suggested to the management in Kuwait that their head office in London should take up the matter through the Ministry of Fuel and Power but I should be grateful for any support you can give them.

Yours faithfully. Political A gent, Kuwait.SECRET SECRET I discussed with Colonel Underwood at Kuwait security arrangements for the Kuwait Oil Company. He said that there was much pilfering going on and that he hoped to arrange for a wire fence round the Company ! s camps* Apart from pilfering he stated that he was perfectly satisfied with regard to the local situation and did not consider there was any danger to be apprehended from the population of Kuwait over whom the Shaikh maintained excellent control. He agreed, however, that if there was any breakdown of authority in Saudi Arabia some danger might be apprehended from tribal incursions. I discussed the whole question later with the Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf and suggested the desirability of preparing some scheme for the protection of the Kuwait Oil Company*s camps and installations similar to that which has recently been prepared for Bahrain. The Senior Naval Officer agreed to do this and emphasised the desirability of the Kuwait Oil Company*s making some arrangements for their own protection. I told him that I was thinking of suggesting to them that they should keep a small reserve of rifles and pistoiis and have a party detailed and trained to use them in case of necessity.

Tanks 7 and $ in the Ahmadi tank farm are etill empty as we have been able to handle production through.the 6 older tanks and using tanka 7 and £ would only have increased the unavailable oil* Active progress is under way cn tanks 9 to 14 inclusive. Immediately after the close of the month the work of cutting a rather large ditch through the Ahmadi tank farm for the installation of the main pipeline system was begun. This ditch is necessary to permit the laying of the main loading lines along the proper grade. Spoils from the ditch are to be used for laying the bas$s of permanent roads in the v industrial and heusihg areas. Likewise, so&amp;e of this material is being used for fire walls„ It is of parcicutbar interest to note that thring the month of September the 500th tanker was loaded at Fahaheel, During the month under review the 5th water tanker, for service between the ShattArab and Kuwait,was received and placed in service. She is a rather old vessel but being steam driven Should not give excessive trouble during the period that she will be required 0 During the month of September we continued with our scheme of doing the preliminary work on houses that are to be constructed by the Winter Gang# The first cf the Winter Gang has now arrived and the preliminary indications are that this scheme should proceed satisfactorily for the winter of 1948/1949.

Good progress continued to be made in movix ; .g the stores from Magwa to Ahmadi, and thiri move Is now nearing completion. The most important event in thi' action of our epe ration a during the month wag the destruction by fire ax. mgwa of almost all- of the small Motor Transport speres that were^ in stock.

Though much yet remains to be done in regard to food the large shipment 8 of canned foods and frozen'meat frcm • the U.S.A. have certainly resulted in a boosting .of moral among the staff, V/ork i* already in progress and a otiicerted attempt is being meSe to supply playing grounds and other sports facilities early in the season.

Though semi^permanent quarters will not be available for many of the staff until late next spring* Just as soon, ae the restaurant accommodation has been completed we expect to bring forward a great number of staff frcaa the U.K. and house them in tents until ss^i-per^anent quarters becQme available. . . With ,the completion of the new restaurant in Ahaadi and the near conpletion of oallows and precinct s, the recruitment of.staff from India is being speeded up greatly during the month of October.

The E.C.C. staff, offices, etc., in London are to be separated from those of the A.I.O.C. and Southwell is to be Managing Director on the new board, which consists, apart from him, of three British and three Americans. 2. Whereas originally it was intended to consolidate the development at present under before expanding further it has now been decided to push on at a maximum speed with a greatly enlarged drilling programme. He was unable to say what the increase in personnel would be but instead of the '2 ^ rig rt drilling programme originally planned there was to be a ”6 rig' one. It is not possible yet to give any idea of the increase in production expected. (The scheme just completed is for 30,000 barrels a day or 2,000,000 odd tons a year.) 3. The bottle-neck is housing and every effort was to be made to construct buildings at maximum speed to enable development to continue. 4. Although the decision has not yet been formally taken a refinery will be built. It will r^ot refine all the crude produced but enough for local demands and those of shipping etc. 5. All this will mean a large increase in personnel, of which the drillers will be largely American, and in the local activity of the company. Sd/- M.P.O.C.
