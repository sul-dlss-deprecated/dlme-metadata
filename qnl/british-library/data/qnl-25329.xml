They are arced in Q&amp;nseQuenoo ef the Zn- otdent which tek place on the Island. I. that reason had you to take such steps as to drive the ctnerc ana other workcen out of the Island ? Sager.Because »hen Baft Masson bin Seceyye made the contract wit} the German firc 9 he did not tell us that he intended to do so.L I. This is no proper reason^ because they can sell their goods to any one without giving you any notice* They have sold a large quantity of the red oxide of iron from the Island of Abu Musa during the past 10 years that they had the mines in lease-hold and never consul* ted. you nor informed you before hand tha$ they intended to make a contract or sale, still you never objected to thetr sales* Sow is it that you object to this special sale * Sager. Another reason is because Isa bin Abdul Latif^ a partner in the lease—hold y complained that the contract with tht German form was made without his knowledge or consent* I* Isa bin Abdul Latif being under British protection,Baji Hassan bin Ali and Abdullah bin Bassan Semeyye British Indian subjects^ any dispute arising between them is to be referred to the British authorities for settlement and not to you* Sager. I quite agree with you on this point, but if you inquin from the inhabitants of this place, you will come to know how this matter has been brought about. Sven AbJul* lah the present can tell you the details of the case* X. I have already inquired into the case from other people and have learnt the particulars ffom them, but as the steps in driving suit the miners out of the Island were taken by you and as it was your men who fired at the employees of the German firm, I must hear from you thj reason of your so doing* Sager* It is stated in the letter from the Imperial German Consul ate,which you just handed over to me, that it ^as Shaikh Salem who has given the lease-h Id and not I; better you first inquire from him the reason then I j will give you my reply also. I. He doutt ingutriee will be made from Sheikh ScLle;n, bui in order to lose no time I intend to leave by to day's moil, I should like to hear now what you have tc26 eaj/ &amp; then ac Salem. Sager. S you better ece him first and then eime to me. While diaouseing ^t thie point S. Sclem entered the room. Soon after he took hie seat I delivered him the official letter which I had for him. Me handed it over to S.Saftem who opened and. gave it hack to him. Saving gone through it he offered it to Sager to read it. When Sager did so , he gave the official letter to his own address to Salem. The latter having read this as well began to question Abdullah about the weather and rain. # socner this was over then I commence conversation with Salem: X# Sheikh Sager tells me to inquire frem you the reason cf his having sent troops to drive the miners from the Is land of Abu Musa. I shall be pleased te hear all what you can tell me on this subject. Salem. I am fully satisfied with Maji Milt n bin Alii and Ab dullah bin Bassan Semey^e, if any damages have ever been done on the Island they were caused by their workmen with- cit their knowledge^ they were also trifles r t nd not worth while to speak about. This trouble which was brought about is due to the dispute of Isa bin Abdul latif, their own par net, n account ef their having made a contract with the German firm. I. that harm is there in their having made a contract with the German firm ? Sag r. We have made treaties with the English which prevent us from leasing ony part of our territory te foreigners other than the British subjects and also prevent us from carrying tritten cammunicmtdons with foreign powers I cannot give even written re -ly to the letter you handed over to me n w. I. Does this treaty bind you in any other way ?Sayer. I. Sag or. 1. Sager I. Sag e r . I. Sager I. Sager It hinds us in three ways (1) not to sell any part of our territory to foreigners (8) not to give any j.art in lease to foreign subjects other than the English (3) not to carry any written c oninuntocit ion with any foreign po — were. As you say this has been concluded some 16 years ago 9 it may he that you do not remember the contents properly; would it not he better if you produce it now to see ever thing clearly ? Ifo t it is not necessary I remember all; the English on the other hand promise us protection and help against al Do you believe this treaty is good for you? after a. pause*- No* Then what induced you to make it ? It was simply a matter of force. They wrote that treaty themselves end shed me to sign it. I was not inclined do to comply with their demand and at first refused to so* They returned a ter a few days and showed me similar treaties which they had made with Sheikh Zayed of Abu- Zobi, either Sheikh Bashed cr Mashtoom of Dobai and Ah- i fLec : 0 f Qm-ul-XowQin and insisted upon my signing the other* I was still untncltnod to do it* They got angry. In order that they may not do me any harm I was obliged to do what they wanted f me. Do you mean now that you cannot give me a written reply to the official letter. . No, I cannot Don't you think that it is not good for you that you should not give a writteh reply to this official letter I know that it is net good , but I regret I cannot do it on account of that treaty. Some time g 0 I wrote a letter to Darya Beigi in Bushire concerning my property in Lingah. The British Consul at Bushire learnt aboutI. Sager I. Sager I. Sager Z. If the I. Sager . it. Be oaxie here and spike very eerlcuslg to ne and told xe that by my so doing I have broken the treaty and if I repeat it again the oonsequenoes will b? very b d for me. They threaten me of punishment, Suoh being the case hem oould I give you a written reply. They are strong and I am weak. If I do not aet as they want I will surely be put into trouble. Under any oiroumetanoes you must reply to this letter. I sill give you a verbal rely which is all I a aid. Well, as yu say yau cannot give me a written reply, let me hear what is year verbal cne. I will give y u my reply in a few days time. The steamer , as I told you^ is leaving Dobat to-day at 5 p.m. nd I wish if possible to leave with her.In order that I should not unnecessarily be delayed here I wish to hear your reply if possible new. Be, I oannot give you my reply now, as I must consult some people before I could do &amp; . I aann&amp;tt you know that at 8 o'clock Ar bie time (hbout 1 p.m.) Very well I will call on y u again at 8 o'clock. Any how I mty tell you that the compulsion of miners from the Island in such u manner ana the sh cting at the em ployes# of the German firm by your men are doubtless serious quest tons. Imagine what the consequences vculd be. Germans try to do any thing a gainst us, the English ill prevent and stop them. I could n t possibly uncierstana how could the English interfere in a matter which omoerns you and the Imperial German Government. The English are the aaeters of all the seas and uerj powerful. They have undertaken to interfere a foreign.■otter i.&amp;rs to tc..kd step agii/i&amp;t us* I. Are ueu ear* that they ui interfere in thie off tr ?

The 2 first named persons who are British subjects made again a contract titlt the German firm. Mow the case stands thus that the German firm have to complain against the said British subjects and they again, in case they believe I have dene them any wrong, have t&amp; complain against mo to their Consulate.

Having united a quarter vf an hour at his gate I despatched some ens to tell him that I oas awaiting him at his pi-o„. My messenger crossed his on the iay and returned both together and informed me that S. Sager y sas at S. Salens and wished me to go over and see him there, which T did, again ogoonpmniad by Abauilah ana HaJ Al i. Hanker. While a q entered t tie re were besides S» Sager and S. Sal ^m a few ether Arabs in the room. When coffee mas served S Sager ordered the Arabs to leave the room U and icon addressed himself to me saying:— Hager. My reply is this that Baji Hassan and Abdullah bin Hassan Semeyye together with lea bin Abdul Lattf made a contract with us for the Red Oxide of Iron of the Icl ana j/ Abu Musa and net the German firm. The 3 first named persons who are British subjects made again a contract with the* German firm. Now the case stands thus that the German firm have to complain against the said British- subjects ana they again, in case they believe I h&lt;*ve done them any wrong, have to complain against me to their Consulate. Therefore it is the best the Germans should ccmmgnioate to the British Consulate- General on the subject. * * What have you tc say to question of your men's shooting at the employees of the German firm from the Island of Abu Musa ? Sager. Our men did not recognise them1 I. Thei, mere flying a German Flag* Sager. We Arabs here have never seen the German flag and da not know it. I. They &amp;oald at least see that it uas n foreign flag and not an Arab one. Sager after a pause. Tes^ but the people In the baat were try ing to fares their May to the Island and the guards sta tioned there did not mant them to land and therefore sh t at them in ord r to deep them away. I. I have made full inquiries and knew $very thing there is na need of oonoealing any thing frem me . Would you there fore tell me plainly os t© hew many of the beats which^ conveyed troops tv the Island a-ent sailing and how many of then were towed ? Sager after a long pause. I believe 4 of their, were towed. I. Tcu certainly mean towed by the English gun beat. Sager after a pause. Yes. I. Were all these bouts the property rf y ' ir own subjects ? Sager. only 3 of them belonged to Sharga and the other 3 were from B. Abbas simply chartered by me for that pur pose. J. How many boats went sailing, leaving aside those which were towed by the BnglicK w an boot ? Sager. I believe only one. I. Then, you mean that there were 5 boats altogether. Sager. Yes, there were only 5 bouto. I. Hew many armed persons did sent by them, all ? Sager. T did not count them and do not know the exact number. I. But you can tell me there ab&lt;ut. Sager. I oannet tell you that eue-'i, but I oafe say so m.uoti that each heat wae fit Leu by people of a different quarter of the town of Sharga. j. The English had told the miners that they had appeared on the scene only to see that they are neither molestet n&lt; r ill-treated by the armed men you sen$.61 Sager, The English said that ? Salem, Then what was the reason that they oame here sc often daring the pact month end repeatedly asked uc to send men to the Island and drive the miners oat by the force of orms, fe repeatedly refused that and told them that thrO ooncecuenees f ec doing w aid be great.. They told uc we should net fear any thing^ stating there woe no body to make difficulties and premised that in ouse any trouble should arise they would interfere and arrange every thing themselves, Besides they told us to erect &amp; flag-staff u r on the Oxide on tho Island, Seeing that j)s are obliged tc meet them at this point as it ell, they said they have a ready made fl g-etaff and will send it thither for that purpose, We said that we had one of cur own and did not *mt theirs, Nevertheless we hear they have taken Li to the Island and tola cur man ta heeot it. Our hum having no instructions from us did n t d@ it. They propose we should fly the flag given to us by Lo m ■Carson and which we ore not inclined to fly. Vh&amp;t does all this ohoa ? I. What di yea so S.Sxger to this at xtement of S. Salem ? Sager after a pa a 3. Thin is tlright. The whole tom knows that as were not willing t take those ste s but we couli n t ielp it as the English insistee upon item. I. Were the r ers tc artvz out the workmen from the Island 4c. given t you by the Indian Government cr by the Bri tish Consul ti-G&amp;nenl ct Bashirs. Sager. They were given by the Indin G vernment but through the Ccns&amp;lote at Bashire. I. Were these -rderc written rr verbal ? Smger. Partly written cnc artly verbgl. I. Can you prove thereby that the steps which yea took were simply due tc the orders f the English ?* Sager. I think I oan and the mhele touin of Sharga knows about J + w (* • I. Is it a fast that the oar of the German firm uhtoh ^as lying in the Island, is broken into pieces ? Sager. No, at least I do not know an^ thing about it. If such a thing has at all taken place it must have been donee during the second voyage of the English Gun boat, when the Assistant Consul was cn board. I. If such a violation has been done do you mean to say It that,has been neither by your knowledge nor consent Sager. Surely not. I do not know any thing about it. Tou may inquire tbout that fr w. Gulcm, the man f S Salem to whom the Island is entrusted and :i&gt;h' has lately corns f from the Island. I, Hell, Sheikh Salem what do you say about the contract which you have made with Haji Ssissan 9 Abdul lan unu Is&amp; bin Abdul Latif ? Salem. It is as y ru see it in black and white. j. By this reply you surely mean that it is quite g &gt;Gd and. that nobody could dispute its validity. Salem. Yes, it is quite good and alright. I, Then why do y u net see that it is carried out. Salem. It is n.t my fault. Sheikh Sager has done that owing to the orders of the English and we are helpless. I, You surely have not bound yourself to any treaty with the English &amp; therefore are quite free to give me a wri\ ten reply to the official letter I delivered you. SaU-®.

After receipt of the copy of the contract which we demanded frequently, on the 5 Dhul Kada 1324 and which was written in English and of which we acknowledged receipt on the 6 Dhul Kader 1324 and after we found, somebody to translate it, we found that you had en tered engagements against which we had warned you and tno.t you had bound yourself to a lease-hold, for which reason my son Isa does not agree to the contract which takes the working and management of the mines from our hands, le in formed you Of this before on the 8 Dhul Hadj when Isa saw the conditions of the contract and when you see the enclos ed translation of the contract you will understand that the question is not as you have understood it, only a sale, but a lease hold against which we warned you. Sheikh Seger ben Khalet does not agree to your giving a lease-hold of oxyde to strangers of foreign powers and asserts that the arrange mentmerit is that the partners themselves only work as they have done for the last few years.

I have received your letter and noted contents. Recording the. contract with the Germans, which you say is net as I hove explained before sale of oxyde only, my friend,! am convinced that it is a sale of oxyde only for a certain period and a certain quantity eve ry year until the contract expires. It Is not a lease-hold for the island. The agreement and conditions are as follows: He agrees to take every year a fixed quantity and we agree to dig it from the mines and deliver it as long as there is oxyde, just as it has been customary before. From every- ‘ body who sells something a sale contract is taken, this is not a lease-hold once for ever and you know that neither the Germans nor anybody else have any power over me. But perhaps you have been forced to this correspondence. The Germans bought oxyde only, nothing else, from the owners of the lease-hold of the oxyde mines in Abu IMssa Hage ben Alt Semey it Co. We have arranged that if we deliver the oxyde in Lingoh and pay the transport expenses he has no objections and is quite agreeable and will not insist on going to the island and possess himself of it. Also you wrote me saying that perhaps I muld cancel the contract, I spoke to him about it, he answered: 'if you say that we have intentions with the island, we shall give you a letter that we have nothing whatever to do with it, we have only bought oxyde from the lease-holders of the oxyde-mines in Abu Mussa for aa fixed period, just os other people buy from you. We do a laroe business with oil the merchants on the Persian and Arabian coast and have never hod trouble with the people. If you do net accept this letter and you wont to be releas ed from the contract allright -pay us for every ton 15/-- os per contract and also the advances which we have paid to joiif when you 'hove paid us that we do not require the con tract and shall return it. We insist upon our rights,we arc not here to play at doing business and we work and go in accorda.nce with law. If you think it advisable please write to them and explain to them, rerhaps they will meet you. I cannot see mu way to do anything contrary to the sale conditions until the contract expires. You are the lord of the learned you know that I did this knowing that you were agreeable to it, the thing being done it is better to stop this dispute. When the Germans agree to give you a letter according to your own wish, saying that they have bought oxyde only from Hasson ben Ali Semey% Co. and have nothing to do with the lease-hold or the island, that settles everything. You know that such a sale in one item is not obtainable every day and we have a large amount in vested since the date of the concession; until now, who of the partners gave a single penny and if we don’t Sell who will give us our money. You know that a sale is debarrass- inn, when it is made it decreases the liabilities of the partners, when there is no sale the vartners must pay what' ever the expenses are. After his arrival from Calcutta Ab dulla will close the books and chow you everything, please inform Iso of this. (sd•) Hasson ben Ali Semey &lt;a,co.91 Anlane 12.

Regarding the letter in rhich *bdul Lap if agrees to the contract with the Germans and at the same time warns us against giving a leasehold or some thing similar; yes I have not acted contrary to that letter and the Germans have nothing to do with the leasehold of that island. I have only sold oxyde of iron. Yhen Abdul La- tif received answer to his letter it rroved to him that I had not acted wrongly. I had only sold oxyde of iron. V’e are responsible for nothing else but the sale of oxyde of iron to the Germans. You say that I had stated that I am the owner of the island; how could I make such an assertion as I have taken in lease only the mine of oxyde of iron which is in the island of Abu Musa from Sheikh Salem ben Sultan and pay a certain sum as rent to Sheikh Salem every year according to the leasehold. But your statement that I had written that I am. the leaseholder it is right and sale and management are in my hands. The partners know well, that from the beginning of the concession the sale, expen diture* management and requirements have been duly looked after by me and from the date of the contract the entire ma nagement has been in my hands and none of the partners have interferred nor had they any right to do so unless I had acted contrary to la&amp;, I quite admit that I am a British subject and Abiding and do not deserve this unjustifiable interference one yiau know that Germans hove no other claim, butbut the purchase of oxyde for a certain period, and you are well aware that larpe amounts of our money have been invest ed in the oxyde mines.

Ye beg to submit that on the 18th hSuharrem 132b xoe received a letter from Jheikh Seger ben Khalet chief of Sharp eh 7 saying that Isa ten Abdul Latif has lodged a complaint with him to the effect that he does not agree to the contract which we have made with R. Wonck- hauSy the German, asserting that it was made without his knowledge. Sheikh Seger also dr-ops a hint that he wishes to withdraw the lease-hold for the oxyde of iron mines in Abu Muss a which we leased from Sheikh Salem ben Sultan. We, being British, subjects and seeing that the letter of Sheikh Seger has no meaning, we thought it n.ecessary to in form you of this before they mispresent the matter to you. We hold the original lease-hold from Sheikh Salem ben Sul*- tan of 131b to be continued for any period we desire; at tested by your agent Abdul Latif we accepted Sheikh oeger as a partner vith the knowledge and evidence of Abdul Latif We made known our contract with the Germans and its co^ ditions in Arabic and English to Abdul Latif . Then we re ceived a letter from your agent dated 21 Retie el Thani 1324 regaling the contract with the Germans, in that let ter he expresses his acceptance and gladness. l T /e beg to enclose the copy of that letter. Also Jsa was informed and agreed9 aor^zd in the question the letter of Sheikh shows that he intends to stop the work and make us suffer a loss, for which reason we enclose copy of his letter before a dis pute arises .You are our protectors and it was necessary for us to inform you because all our transactures and contracts were made with the Knowledge and approval of Jsa and Abdul Latif and the original lease hold with their signatures are in our possession. Jf Abdul Latif had not approved he would have stopped me in the letter of HI Rebic el fhani and J have only treated with the Gervnans with his approval and in our contract with the Germans we have sold oxyde only a merchandise is for every body the Germans and others. 22 Muharrum 1325. signed Nissan ben Ali Jemsy u.

J have received your letter -S noted contents. Regarding the complaint lodged with us by Jsa ben Abdul Latif concerning the oxyde in Abu Musa, you mention that your contract with the Germans ukis made by his and his fathers knowledge, as per letter dated 21 Rebi ul Thani 1324. Jn the seme letter he also warns you against entere- ing engagements resembling a lease or binding yourself in such way as to occasion a row, he further mentions that you should go a sure way because his officials would not agree to it.The existing contract between you 4 the Ger mans and the conditions which you have bound yourself to are altogether contrary to the letter of Jsa 9 s father vM&amp;i you mention. The reason that we are frightened of your work is that it is not remote that the mines go out of our sphere. We entered into this with you knowing that you are British subjects, lie did not tell you to make contracts with stran gers from foreign pouters without informing us to bind yourself. You have no right to make use of it and write on the head of the contract that you are the owners -4 posses sors of the lease held in Abu Musa. To this we nuver agree ^ you are not allowed to take oxyde of iron from Abu Musa island on the condition which you have made, unless the business is put -on a footing of which we need not fear the consequences.

Jn the name of Qod Lingo. 27 th Rabia-awal 1325. From Hasson bin Alt Semey ye To Sheikh Salem bin Sultan, After compliments. The reason of writing this i-: that 9 in these days our man came from the island and informed its that a man on behalf of Sheikh Saker with a note bearing no seal and pretending that it was from you stopped the coo lies from digging oxide from the mines, stating further that this prohibition is ordered by 3, Saker, :Je do not un derstand the interference of S, Saner. Should this really be a fact, the action of S. Saker is contrary to law. He has no right to raise any objections and interfere with us. He should remember that he, as you know, has been one of the partners who sold his share to us and for this reason we assert that he has no right to interfere with us no to stop the coolies from digging in the oxyde mines. He must know and recognize that the stoppage of work means a great loss to us as we even during the delay have to pay the coo lies their duly wages. I7e conjucture that this proceeding of 3. Saker is without your knowledge and that you do not agree to these unjust interference and objections of his. As you know all beginning till the contracts A correspondence from the this day have teen done by knowledge and approvalapproval of the British Political Agent, Abdul Latif and all of you.Jt is astonishing that 3, Saher goes beyond his limits and interfere in a matter which has been concluded with the consent and approval of the British Agent. Vie have this moment vTitten a letter to Khan Behadur 9 Political Agent Abdul Latif, because from the beginning of our lease-hold vjith you and others, have done all by his knowledge and approval and because we consider him one of our partners and we wish to know his final reply. Really we do not want all these troubles and disputes but as you know, when necessity arises one is obliged to stand up and defend his rights which naturally entails a noisy dispute. We are compelled to address ourselves to our Government and claim whatsoever losses we sustain from him who inter feres. This action of 3. Saker is due to his jealousy of you and us, but we hope that so long as you are in exi stence we have every confidence and strangers have no rights over us. Jn these days my son Abdullah arrived from Jndia and intended to see you and pay his respects and now await* an opportunity.

He replies that the n Jsland of Abu Musa ,f is his property and so long as he cannot make suitable arrangements he con siders himself a loser. Jf he did not formerly interfere it was due to the good understanding existing between you but now he cannot leave the case alone as before because a stranger has entered therein and he is afraid that by and by the island will get out of his possession.

The con tract does not contain a clause authorising you to give the whole out put of oxyde of iron to one stranger vnth- out our consent. Because Hage Hassan ben ali Semey made a contract with out our consent with Robert Wonckhaus in Lingah on the 1 st June 1906 f and gave him right of purchase of all this out put of the mines in Abu Mussa;we informed the said Hage Has* san ben ali Semey in ou?' letter dated 9.

Grey has the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the note from the German Charg$ d'Affaires, dated December 31 st 1907, on the subject of the contract between Messrs ITonckhavs and a native British suject for the purchase of red oxide from the island of Abu tifusa. His Majesty's Government fully appreciate the courtesy of the German Government in communicating without reserve the documents in their possession, and the examination of the German case is being actively pursued* The facts set out in these papers differ materially from.'- those which had been reported to Sir E. Grey and it will fe necessary for His Majesty's Gov element to apply to the par ties concerned for further information* Sir E* Grey observes that Messrs Wonckhaus claim that they are now partners in the concession onginalxy granted in 1898, but inasmuch as this Concession had been cancelled by the Sheikh of Shargah some months before any share there-* in was transferred to Messrs Vfonckhavs, he cannot admit that they are entitle! to assume any such position. Ad the present juncture His Majesty's Government do not think that it would be desirable that the Sheikh of Shargah should permit the „ Company ” to resume work at the mines: any attempt to do so might not improbably re sult in further confusion. His Majesty's Govermient, how ever, see no objection to Mr, Robert Wonckhaus removing the red oxide which has already been mined and is now rear dy for shipment from the island. If this proposal as to the removal of the red oxide in question meets with the concurrence of the German Gcverrvnent, His Majesty's Govern ment would advise the Sheikh accordingly and would arrange for 3580for the Indian Government to take whatever step seemed de sirable to ensure that all proper facilities are placed at the disposal of Mr. Wonckhavs for the removal of the oxide and to prevent any local friction or conflict between Mr. Y/onckhaus and the men of the Sheikh of Sharp ah. Foreign Office, January 10° 1908.—I154 Translation. Be it known that J, Sheikh Salem bin Sultan, have given all &amp; entire oxytic mines which are in the Island of Abu Mussa in lease to 2 persons, Haji Hassan bin ali bin Semeyye and his son Abdullah bin Hassan Semeyye, at the rate of 250 French Dollars per annum, I have agreed with the 2 lease holdrs that the contract for the oxyde mines will hold good for the time that they get oxyde out of the mines and it will remain in their hands in lease, I have permitted them to work all arround the Island on 4 sides and from me is due to them benevolence and kindness in their requirements of favour at the time of working. And also I have agreed with the said persons that if they qant to carry commercial business in the Island, discharge small and large mother~o-pearl shells, they are permitted to do so; there will be no hinderance for them in dis charging and shipping same in sailing and steam vessels; there will be no customs duty, no warfage and no charge of any kind on them but the fixed amount of rent for the oxyde mines. If they wish to reside or dig up wells for water, I have permitted them to do so for the sake of work and residence only, they can have possession. And the lease-hold which is for the lease of the oxyde mines can remain in their hands for a period of 20 years and so long I,my family and brothers, nobody else can have the right of raising any objections. And so long as they get oxyde in this Island the mines remain in their lease-hold for the fixed rent till they do not get any thing out of the mines. They have to pay the rent of the year in which they had worked and. they have the option, in case they want, to keep the mines in their possession for the fixed period and fot the said period.

On arrival Abdullah bin Baji Hasson who had the manage ment of the work on the Island came on board and stated that oaing to a hare wind blowing no cargo oould be put into light ers . At ab u.t 8 a.m. Agha Beder who was on beard for the pre vious IS hours, without paying any visit to any one of us on board, wished to land by a beat brought for him by his brother Ibrahim, who was recently stationed on the Island by the Eng lish. I was standing with the Captain at the Gangway when he was going tc land. Having per chance f unci us th re, he made out' acquaintance and landed immediately. I landed too. He took his lodgings in his brother/s t nt which was ab ut idfTme tors a*au from the /.ter, I too sued to * ahe an inspeetl n the mines. At the first mine, whichwae about 7 minutes walk from the pier I found a heap of mined ox.de ab it SO Tons. I went on and oaoie to a second nine which is supposed to be the largest and about 17 minutes walk from the pier. There I found a quantity 'f mined o#yde which oould approximately amount tc 25GQ Tons. After these inspections I returned to the pier and with great difficulty oould manage to man a. boat to take me on board, as the sea was very tempestuous at the time. This stormy weather continued for three days. On the * third day in the aftern on it quietened down a bit and the w Louise » get about 35 Tons of cargo in the afternoon. Capt.

He then inquired from Hassaa ab at the quantity which each of those bags and baskets oould contain and about their total number. Be was again referred to Abdullati which he did net like and said in an excited tone that it was surprising that he was not in a poslti n t give him reply to his questions. Thereupon hassan told him that a bag could contain about 1 cwt., but he oould not give h'l&lt; an idea abrtt the weight of baskets as they varied in sine a great deal.

I believe it was then about 7*30 p*m* They said they must go cn board the Lawrence and Seder would return to took into that case* I reminded Beder that I was a- w&amp;iting him to dinner of which the time was over* Be said itdid not matter he vculd rsturn* It »ac after 9 r*&amp;. it hen Beder oame back' Abdullah arrived at the earne time in another laat • I t^ck Bcdcr to table. When the dinner was served &amp;e sj'ke about the vrctcoll. I so ld in /* order tc state every thing clearly it would he necessary to put down in the protocol that the quantity shipped was frost the heap on the beach and that the quantities of cxyde ained and stored at the mined remain untouched. He said it zae abso lutely impossible for him tc make a mention of the latter quan tities and proposed that we should state it was from the only quantity ready for shipment. I said I could not mention such a thing as these quatiiies 'Dhtch are mined and stored at the mines are als ready for shipment. A long dioussion took place between us, none of us agreed to each others proposals. Then he said in order to state xk&amp;rsxx the spot here from the oxyde was shipped &amp;&lt;? must nenti n that it zas cut f the quantity stored, ox the flag-staff* To this I c uld not give ay consent. This flag-^taff, as I lecrnty was erected cnly about S months ape co the rder of the English while o man- of- war was at ihe Island and ordered. Sheikh Sager's flag tc be hoisted thereupon. Sheihk Salem's man , Gulam by nane y had refused tc dc so and informed his master thereof. Salem had sent him a reply that he was net at all in favour cf erecting a staff cn that spot hut as they had already dene it he could not say any thing a- painst it and had sent a flag of his own to he hoist d there upon. On the day 'f ur arrival s&gt;e found 8 flags flying , one new and the other old which were put side by side. I learnt from Gulam. that the old one^ which had a red soustre in the cen ter and a wh te herder about one-third of the frea&amp;^L of ihe said red, was ihe one sent by Salem and the other which f the same pattern but its center red was cf equal breadth as the border white, was the one sent by Sager. The latter had the following inscriptions on the center n la - ellahe -ellallah. »tn Arabic charaotern. oj The 3 days of st rmy weather tore both t. piec s. On the fourth day ue saw only one flag flying which was similar to the latter but without the Arab sic inscription* Gulaft told me that he had already given informati n to hittxK&amp;sxar Salem to send another flog* a iny reason f refusing tiJvumtion of that flag-‘Stuff in the protocol was that I fancied Bed^r could have been instruc ted to engage me in officially acknowledging tfiS. existence Gj that flag-staff, which the English probably wonted to say was erected by Sager's ord r and maintain thereby that we have re- cognised Sayerfs right f flying his flag ahioh hs oould not d ° if the Island was not his.Bed r greatly insisted upon this p int and I always declined to make a m.enticn oj it in the pro tocol, stating that it being a very small and light pace mhioh only could be very easily removed bygone men to another sy v t cn the Island if Salem, the owner of the Island wished it, so it would be quite useless to mention the position of this easily trnonportable thing for showing the spot wherefrom the oxyde was shipped* Be said in the first place there was no likel$h od cf its veiny rente ved by the Sheikh, avoiding to mention the name, se condly in case it was removed there were lot of people on zhe Island and on board the ^Louise ♦&gt; who had seen it then and would give their evidence to $ts position* In the end I told him it would be quite useless to discuss upon that point as the flag -staff was net the only thing ay which we oould ascertain the position of the heap of oxyde from which the shipment had taken place, and that it would be enough if we were to say at a point in the eastern beach or near the pier constructed by Abdullah. Ee refused both and said we may mention the name of the spot end said a word which wasunknown to vie and therefore I could not ocept it.

There I ftn&lt;nd Mr. Rc senfeld and Abdullah standing. The former told me that the latter entirely denied having either requested Bede r or Capt. Trevor that Beder should be present at the tine of weighing the quantity of the 4 tubs end that it vas the desire of the English to know the exo.ct quantity shipped per the Louise^ and that it was impossible for him to make such c request, as the firm of Robert fSnckhaue 6: 6c. was the attorney of the firm of H.Baco n bin Alt Semeyye &amp; Co. I odd to Mr R r senfeld that Abdullah must speak to Beder cn the subject Abdullah addressed Beeler repeating the same thing which Mr. Be senfeld had told me. A discussion took place between them.. From their oenversatt n I mads out that Beaer had told: Abdullah that he wonted to know the exact quantity shipped cer the Louise. Be had given him to undrsiand that it Quid not be done unless the quantity of the 4 tubs Jsers weighed, which they intended to &amp;* at Linga$and that for the protocol it vas enough to mention the estimated quantity, bat if he had instruct ims from his Consul to find out with great aoGuraoy then ho had th present himself at the weighing. This reply was a used by Beder as pretext t , ay that Abdullah hod specially made a request for his presence at that time. Abdullah zold him in ur presence that he did net want him to be present. 1 then said to Beder that that point :t&gt;as also selzlec. and the 2 repr sentattves of the 2 firms would in a minute Gene to conclusion about the quantity shipped aoc rding to the ship's draught. He left with the promise to come back shortly.In Bed r'ss absence Abdullah and Mr. Rceenfeld told me that they dia net want Beder tp knew with aoourcoy about the Quan tity shipped per the ” Louise ” and that it should be enough, according tc the instructions of Consul hr.

Be was informed by me that the representatives of both the firms have already agreed about the appprrxinato quantity chipped and the remaining quantity on the beach and chat we must i ih'ut delay proceed tv write ui the protocol. he doe sired to know ol t the arrangement, which I told h u in pre sence of both Mr. Rocenfeld end ha„ Mae sen and. his eon who adu it ted the fact. Be said he had nc objection tc uienti n the quantity remaining on the beach ly estimation but the amount already shipped he ought to knew with accuracy. I replied tact while f^r .want ' f a decent scale it was impose it e tc ascer* tain the exact quant it. shipped and while the 2 repr. sentativei cf the firms tola us their agreecbility about the quantities it was surprising that he still insisted to know a thing which o'uld not be told then. Me said he was uninolined to toign a taper which he did net l Lie, and there fr.re wild leave the natter to be settled in Bushire between our respective C nsuls. This was contrary tc the instructions given t me by Dr. Liste- nann. I was told tho.t notwithstanding the difficulties which I might experience from the British Official, I should bii^i try m: best to bring the matter to an end and should not re* turn without a protocol.

ITIS Majesty’s Government have had under careful consideration the situation which has arisen in connection with the export of red oxide from the Island of Abu Musa, and which formed the subject of a communication made by the German Charge d Affaires on the 31st December, 1907. r ihe subject is so intricate in nature that it proved necessary to transmit all the documents forwarded by the German Embassy to the Government of India and to the Eritish Resident in the Persian Gulf. This officer lost no time in instituting fhe requisite inquiries, but, owing to the absence of telegraphic communication with Shargah, and the necessity of subjecting the several documents bearing on the case to detailed examination, it has not been found possible to reply to the communica tion in question at an earlier date. Ihe result of this examination tends clearly to establish that the statements of fact upon which the complaint of Messrs. Wonckhaus is based are inaccurate. lor convenience of exposition the substance of each particular count of this complaint is set forth under a separate heading and printed in italics ; the observations of His Majesty’s Government are subjoined in ordinary type. Copies of the documents referred to are annexed in the Appendix. 1. The mines on Abu Musa are owned by Salim-bin-Sultan, the uncle of the ruling Sheikh of Shargah. They were leased by Salim in 1898 to a Company for a fixed yearly The Island of Abu Musa, with the mining and all other rights, is, and can he proved to he, the property of the ruling Sheikh of Shargah, Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khaled. This is established by a letter dated the 21st February, 1908, in which Salim-bin-Sultan categorically disclaims all right of ownership, and declares that, in granting the lease of 1898, he merely acted as proxy for the ruling Sheikh, then absent on a pilgrimage to Mecca (see Appendix, No. 1). The two men were at one time at enmity, Salim , 1 having been the ruling Sheikh till April 1883, when he was deposed by his nephew, ' Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khaled, who has ever since been the ruling Sheikh. Relations between them now depend on an Agreement concluded in 1889 (see Appendix, No. 2). The ruling Sheikh has, ever since his uncle was deposed in April 1883, made the latter an allowance, in w hich, solely in virtue of oral and personal arrange ments, the revenue of the islanct ,Together with that of the mines, has been included/ / / (see Appendix, No 5). ' f ft A When Salim has resided on the island, he has done so only on sufferance, a circumstance which is corroborated by two letters addressed in 1884 by the ruling / Sheikh to the Eritish Resident in the Eersian Gulf (see Appendix, Nos. 3 and 4). The Island of Abu Musa is shown by its history, as recorded in the accompanying Memorandum (see Appendix, No. 6), to be an integral part of the dominions of' the Sheikh of Shargah, who in recent years has regularly sent his own live stock there for purposes of grazing. It thus appears that Salim did not conclude the lease of 1898 in the capacity of owner, but in that of Regent, a contention which is further supported by a letter, dated the 11th October, 1902, from the ruling Sheikh to the Eritish Resident (see Ai^pendix, No. 7). 2. The lease of the Company appears to be legally constituted; this was recognized by the iuling Sheikh of Shargah, since he himself was, for a time, a partner in the Company. The use of the word “ lease ” rather obscures the true nature of the rights granted rent. to the partners by the document of 1898 (see Appendix, No. 9). [728] The document was B2 w fa pjfrk 1 not nn. absolute grant to tbe partners of the right to mine oxide on the island for an undetermined period. It was a mere permit to the partneis terminable o n either side at any time. -'That the partners were entitled to terminate the Concession is shown by the words, “ for such a period as they may wish to hold them, but the only effect of these words is to give the partners the right to surrender the mines and escape from the liability to 'pay 250 dollars a-year when they please. They do not imply that the . right to terminate the contract is with the partners alone, and that the owner is bound for ever, and can under no circumstances escape from the contract, however valuable the mines may become. That the lessor retained the right to determine contracts of this character is shown by the penultimate paragraph of the document: “ I have perhaps made out certain Agreements previous to' this. They do not hold good, and this Agreement is to be / ricted on.” In these circumstances the lease appears to have been no more than a permit to work these mines, determinable by notice on either side, the owners receiving 250 dollars a-year so long as it was in force. The action of the ruling Sheikh in becoming a partner in the concern for a few months in 1899 cannot affect his right to cancel the lease granted in his behalf, no matter what complexion the Company might in future assume. Were there any question at issue as to the genuineness of the lease granted in 1898 by Salim, the lact that the Sheikh had subsequently become a partner would be of importance, but as he approved the lease no such question arises, and his temporary partnership is an incident having no direct bearing upon the points at issue. 3. In October 3 907 Hassan-bin-Ali Sawaiyeh, one of the original lessors, sold his share in the Company to the British subject Thomas Brown, of Lingnh, who, a few days later, transferred the share to the German firm R. \\ onekhaus and Co., of Lingah. The Company of lessors non) apparently consists of three British subjects and the German firm R. Wonckhaus and Co It appeals that an absolutely legitimate commercial business is concerned. In a letter dated the 21st February, 1907 (see Appendix, No. 8), the ruling Sheikh of Shargah addressed a communication tollassan Samaiyeh withdrawing the document of Concession and informing him that, the contract of 1898 being terminated, he had no longer any right of enjoyment in regard to the mines on Abu Musa. In these circumstances, Messrs. Wonckhaus, if they purchased without notice of the fact that the Concession had been terminated, have been misled either by llassan Samaiyeh oi‘ by the intermediate vendor, Mr. Brown; in either case, their appropriate remedy would appear to he an action at law against the vendor for damages. If, when they purchased the share in the Concession, they were already aware that it had come to an end, they have no cause for complaint at the action of the Sheikh either in terminating the Concession or in enforcing his action by the removal of the workmen from the island, for they bought with lull knowledge of the position. In either event, Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. do not appear to have any locus standi in their capacity as partners to question the Sheikh’s action. 4. In October 1907 the Sheikh sent armed men to the island, who expelled the miners and prevented the mines being worked. The boats with the Sheikh’s armed men were towed to Abu Musa by the British man-of-war 11 Lapwing,'’ on board of which is said to have be.n Lieutenant Gabriel, British Vice-Consul at Bunder Abbas. The Sheikh had recourse to forcible measures within his own jurisdiction in consequence of the persistent refusal of llassan Samaiyeh to desist, in accordance with the Sheikh’s repeated injunctions, from working the mines. As the expulsion of British subjects was in contemplation, and the British Besident in the Persian Gulf had been duly notified of the Sheikh’s intention, it was considered I prudent that one of llis Majesty’s ships, with a British Consular officer on board, 1 should accompany the armed force to the island, in order to prevent the use of unnecessary violence. It was pr obably owing to ibis precaution that all b loodshe d and loss of life were prevented. Ttve'Sneikh’s boats were towed to the island'm order to insure their simultaneous arrival with His Majesty’s ship “ Lapwing,” and to enable the British officers to control the action of the Sheikh’s retainers more effectively.3 5. By the forcible measures and illegal conduct of the Sheikh of S'mrgah the Company have been prevented from enjoying the lease granted to them by the proprietor of the mines. The rights of the Sheikh of Shargah in regard to the disposal of his own property are absolute, since, apart from such general control as, in virtue of Treaty relations, is exercised by the Government of India, he is subject to no external control, and is bound only by such laws as he himself may decree. In the case of the particular lease or permit in question, it has already been shown that the Sheikh was entitled to determine it at his discretion. In no sense of the word does the conduct of the Sheikh appear to have been illegal. 6. The Company is thereby suffering losses, since they have entered into contracts to deliver fixed quantdies of iron oxide at a fixed price. In particular, the managing partner has entered into a contract dated the 1.9^ June, 1 ( J00, with the German merchant Herr Robert Wonckhaus, of Lingah (partner in the above-mentioned firm 11. !J dnc.'chaus and Co.), to deliver certain fixed quantities for four years. There is nothing in the documents in the possession of His Majesty’s Government to indicate that Hassan Samaiyeh occupied the post of managing partner, and for reasons which will appear more fully below there seems every reason to believe that Hassan Samaiyeh had no right as against his partners to enter into any such e nt ract without their knowledge, anrlthnb, had they been mware nf its-^ef'msvthey Trrrtttd have refused theil' eunsi’ItTr It is clear that when the document was disclosed and the terms of the contract became known to the other partners they d('clii;rqw^ it. The abrogation of the lease or permit has certainly rendered it impossible for either the Company in whose name Hassan contracted, or lor Hassan himself, to carry out the contract. His Majesty’s Government are not fully aware of the relations between Hassan and the firm of li. M onckhaus and Co., but they recognize that it is possible that Hassan’s action in making a contract which he was unable to fulfil may have rendered him liable to Messrs. !\ onckhaus in substantial damages. This, however, is a matter between Messrs. AVonckhaus and Hassan. 7. The information in the possession of the German Government leads them to ceitain conclusions in regard to the motives of the Sheikh of Shargah. These motives may conveniently be discussed under two headings, (a) the objections of IIsabin-Abdul Hatif, one of the partners in the Company formed to work the Concession granted in 1898, and (b) the objections of the Sheikh himself, to the terms of a certain contract entered into by the aforesaid Hassan Samaiyeh with Herr Robert Wonckhaus on the 1st June, 1906. # By this contract (see Appendix, No. 10) Ilassan Samaiyeh, who is t.esciibed as ^ “owner and holder of Bu Musa Concession, gives * the entile monopoly^ of — Bu Musa oxide to Robert Wonckhaus during the terms of the contract ” (saving certain small amounts duly specified), and, on the expiry of the contract, reserves to Robert Wonckhaus the preferential right of renewal. With regard to point (a), the German Government state: It does not appear to be the case that the contract was concluded without the agreement of Esa-bin-Abdul Latif, as the managing partner, Hassan Samaiyeh, immediately on the conclusion of the contract informed Esus father, Abdul Latif, who represented his son in all matters pertaining to the Company, and Abdul Latif approved the^ conti act in his reply. According to a later letter of the father, the son appears to recognize the contract as legally valid, although he would have liked to have seen it before its conclusion, as he describes its abrogation simply as “preferable,” and in a subsequent letter the fathei says definitely that he had originally approved the contract on behalf of his son. The documents referred to in the foregoing statement form Inclosures 6, 8, and 10 in the note from the German Embassy, but the translations of these documents in the possession of His Majesty’s Government (see Appendices, Nos. 12, 16, and H) differ materially from those forwarded by the German Embassy, and further letters of considerable importance are omitted from the German case. . The 1st June 1906, was the date of execution of the deed of contract between Hassan Samaiyeh and Mr. Robert Wonckhaus. When, on the lltli June I90d (see Appendix', No. 11), Ilassan Samaiyeh reported the Agreement to Esa s lather,4 'd * ' (M 1 I 1ftv^’K&amp;IL otvv* . K \ Abdul Latif, be concealed the existence of what was virtually a monopoly and of tbe preferential right of renewal. In bis reply, dated the 14th June (see Appendix, No. 12), Abdul Latif comments upon the transaction in guarded language, and expressly requests Hassan Samaiyeh to “refrain from entering upon any arrange ments whatever in the nature of leases or deeds of con tract, from which there will arise difficulties and quarrels.” ' “ On the 26th. Aune, 1906, Mr. T. Malcolm, a British-pr otected subject, with whom the concessionnaires had engagements, requested llassan Samaiyeh to furnish him with a copy of the Agreement, inquiring whether other European firms could enter into similar contracts. Both points were evaded by Hassan Samaiyeh in his reply of tbe 13th July (see Appendix, No. 13), in which he alleged that the original contract had been drawn up in German ; and in a further letter of the 14th October (see Appendix, No. 11) to Mr. Malcolm he refused to send a copy of the Agreement, and said that secrecy of the transaction had been enjoined by Herr Bobert IV onckhaus. It was not untii tbe 16th December, 19'6 (see Appendix, No. 15),^ that he sent a copy of it to A+rdTrLLatif, who, on receipt of the document, wrote on the 23rd January, 1907 (see Appendix, No. 16), to llassan Samaiyeh stating that his son Esa did not agree to the execution of such an Agreement, which had been concluded without any consultation among the partners, such as should undoubtedly have taken place. 1 he phrase which, in Inclosure ,,8 of the German case, is translated “ the cessation of this contract would be preferable to its continuance ” is more accurately rendered by “ the nullification of this contract is better than its acceptance.” This employment of the comparative is, in Arabic epistolary form, a customary euphemistic manner of expressing a definite resolution. In the present case this interpretation is confirmed by the whole tenor of the letter in question. It does not appear, as contended in the German case, that Abdul Latif definitely says in his letter of the 27th March, 1907 (see Appendix, No. 17), that he had originally approved the contract on behalf of his son Esa. It is clear that the main ground of Esa-bin-Abdul Latif’s objection to the contract was that llassan Samaiyeh, improperly describing himself in inaccurate terms as “ owner and holder of Bu Musa Concession,” had, without consulting his partners, formed a contract with Herr Wonckhaus which tied the hands of the Company, not improbably for an indefinite period, in regard to practically the whole amount of red oxide excavated at the island, and bound them to sell it at a fixed price, so that they would derive no advantage from any increase in the price of oxide. It is obvious that a contract of such far-reaching import should, before being concluded, have been submitted to all the parties interested. Esa-bin-Abdul Latif has expressly denied that he gave any power of attorney to Hassan Samaiyeh, and maintains thal it was incumbent upon the latter to act in regard to every trans action in communication with him, according as was agreed in the deed drawn up on the admission of Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh to partnership in the Company (see Inclosure 2 in the note from the German Embassy). tv A '&lt; A / * ' f * 4 \ 1 If the contract had in reality been submitted to and approved by Abdul Latif on behalf of his son Esa, it is difficult to see the reason for which Herr Wonckhaus .enjoined secrecy on Hassan Samaiyeh (see Appendix, No. 14). As will be seen from the accompanying Petition (see Appendix, No. 18) from Nejef, the son and heir of Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh, now deceased, Esa-bin-Abdul Latif is not the only partner in the Company who takes exception to the proceedings of Hassan Samaiyeh. His Majesty’s GovernmgpJ understand that the dragoman of the German Consulate, Bnshire, hay bu^fTm communication with Nejef-bin-Nakhoda in regard to Lis attitude towards the~e©ntract of the 1st June, 1906. With regard to (6) (the objections of the Sheikh of Shargah himself to the contract of the 1st June, 1906), the German Government are of opinion that— The Sheikh's fear that he might lose possession of the mines and island is senseless^ while the fact that there was no provision in the lease of 1898 allowing the whole export of the mines to be transferred to a foreigner without the Sheikh's approval is no more con clusive than the omission of a prohibition against such a transfer, and, in vieiv of the recognized liberty of trade in the Persian Gulf, it is to be inferred that the conclusion of contracts with foreigners ivas within the powers of the Company. The principal motive of the Sheikh of Shargah in cancelling, in accordance with the exercise of his sovereign rights of jurisdiction, the lease granted in his behalf by25£ the Regent in 1898 was evidently a proper and natural desire to administer justice between the partners of the Company, and to render nugatory the unauthorized /fi^ of Hassan Samaiyeh. Moreover, on learning how far the terms of the contract withv^^* Herr It. Wonckhaus went, conferring as they did a preferential right of renewal for an indefinite period, the Sheikh may well have felt that his own pecuniary interest in the y . mines would not, in view r of the increasing market value of red oxide, he properly safeguarded by a payment limited indefinitely to a sum of 250 dolla rs a-year. In these circumstances the Sheikh would not unnaturally have deemed it advisable to/if protest against the contract with Herr Wonckhaus so soon as he became aware of its purport, rather than to allow this gentleman to acquire, with the lapse of time, a vested interest in the output of the mines. The position at the present time appears to His Majesty’s Government to be that Herr Robert Wonckhaus has entered into a contract with Hassan Samaiyeh, who, having acted without authority from his partners, is unable to carry out his contract, and is consequently liable to Herr Wonckhaus in damages. If, therefore, further steps are taken they should be of a legal character, and it will be at the discretion of Herr Wonckhaus whether they are taken or not. His Majesty’s Government appreciate the friendly manner in which the German Government have dealt with the case, and, pending a final decision of the whole question, they are prepared to use their good offices in order that temporary arrange ments may be made whereby Messrs. Wonckhaus will be enabled to procure a limited amount of red oxide to place them in a position toTulfil''sueh eoTrtrfll’iT'flTTfr^rnilly have entered into before the cancellation of the lease. Instructions have accordingly been issued to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf to ask the local representative of Messrs. Wonckhaus to give due notice when the firm intend to resume operations in order that the necessary arrangements may be made. His Majesty’s Government are, however, informed that, for climatic reasons, no serious operations are possible during the next three or four months for transporting the accumulated minerals from inland to the beach. Foreign Office, July 10, 1908,APPENDIX. No. 1. Sheikh Salim-bin-Sultan to Sheikh Sagar-hin-Khalid. (After compliments.) Moharrum, 1326 [February 21, 1908). I WHITE to inform your honour that whereas I have come 1o know that Ilaji ITassan-hin-Ali Samayieh and the friends who advise him assert -that the oxide mines which are in the Island of Abu Musa are my personal property, and that the lease which was issued hy me to Haji Hassan and his partners was given by me in my own right, and not hy proxy, in your behalf. I fear that this statement may become a cause of ill-feeling between us ; I have therefore thought it necessary to apprise your honour of it, and to acquaint you with what is in my mind, namely, that I absolutely made no such claim as that which interested parties allege; and I hereby admit that when I came before you in the presence of the British Agent on the 4th Shaaban, 1301, I had no pension or means of subsistence, and you were kind enough to place the Island of Abu Musa under my supervision, so that I might cultivate therein and reap from it the means of subsistence, and you did so conditionally that 1 showed loyalty and concord and obedience to you in all respects; and I am w'ell aware that the island in question and the mines which are in it belong to your honour, and that you might at any time decide to take the island from my charge —it is at your disposition to do so, and I have no status or powder to gainsay you ; and when I leased the mines of Abu Musa I was officiating on your behalf, and the Concession was given by proxy for you ; and I w r as w r ell aware that on your return from the pilgrimage to Mecca, if you considered that my action in the matter of the Concession w r as good, you would confirm what I had agreed to, and if in your opinion it was objectionable, you could annul it either at the time or at any other time ; and I altogether disapprove of the proceedings of Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Samayieh in regard to this lease, and in respect of whatever action you took in this connection, that is, in cancelling the document, I w T as acting in accord with you, seeing that your action was taken in consultation with me and for the interests of us all, and in no respect have I any view contrary to yours; and it is in order to dispel doubt from your mind and as an evidence of my singleness of view with you that I have written this, so that you may have cognizance. (Signature and seal of Salim-bin-Sultan.) No. 2. Agreement of 1889. Sagar-bin-Khalid to Abdul Latif. (After compliments.) 2 Shaaban, 1306 [April 3, 1889 b With reference to the matters in reference to which you acted as intermediary between me and Salim-bin-Sultan with a view to his being reconciled to me, and the meeting which we had, I hereby take upon myself the oath of God and of sincerity, so that he who fears may feel secure. There shall be no deceit and no duplicity in the fulfilment of the conditions which I gave to Sheikh Salim in regard to the display of honour and liberality towards him and in my exchanging views with him in matters aflecting our interests, and in the payment to him of the amount of his fixed pension, namely 400 French dollars, and I will not give any one’s opinion preference to his, and he can live where he pleases from a mong the following part icular places: Shargar, or Khan, or Hijra. And I hope that God will prosper relations between us and will make the result auspicious both lor him and me. This is what had to be written. (Seal of Sagar-bin-Khalid.)7 Agreement o/1889, dated 5 Shaaban, 1306 [April 6, 1889). This is what wc have assembled to arrange. We have come to an agreement in the name of God and in all sincerity, without trickery and deceit, we the Sheikhs Salim-bin-Sultan and Sagar-bin-Khalid through the mediation of Abdul Latif-bin- Abdurrahman, the Agent of Government. What I, Sheikh Sagar, have bound myself to do in regard to Sheikh Salim is that I will continue the payment of the pension fixed at 400 dollars per annum, and will show him honour and complete magnanimity, and will exchange views with him in regard to matters needing consultation and expression of opinion ; and in these which are needful in our own interests, and I will not put any one’s opinion before his, and he can live where he likes—from Khan toEGhja*^ - _ And what I, Sheikh Salam, have bound myself to do in regard to Sheikh Sagar is to fulfil the obligations of docility and obedience and the display of energy in advising him in matters affecting our interests inwardly and outwardly. And if we came to know of anything in the way of misunderstanding that might tend to cause soreness in our minds one against the other, then we will explain it to one another with a view to the removal of misunderstanding and the suppression of the efforts of the mischief makers and intriguers to make misunderstanding between us. And of our own wish and pleasure wc have bound ourselves to the British Government to the effect that in the event of any violation on the part of either of us of what is outlined in this deed in the way of conditions, he will be worthy of being held responsible, and will accept what results to him in the way of punishment and revenge from the aforesaid Government as a recompense for his breach. This is what was arranged and settled peaceably. Wc hope that God will prosper the results of it between us in the direction of prosperity and happiness. Executed and written 5th Shaaban, 1306.

Previous to this I wrote to you a letter, but received no reply. I hope nothing untoward has prevented you from doing so. You are acquainted with the arrange ments which were effected between me and Sheikh Salem, through the medium of Sheikh Hamid-bin-Abdullah and Hashar-bin-Maktoom. At present the above Sheikhs met at Shargah, and desired Salem to stand by the agreement and arrangement effected by them between me and him. But he did not wish to do so, consequently they have absolved themselves of all responsibility, and revoked their guarantee which they had tended on our behalf, and the arrangements effected between us have been dissolved. At present you are aware that Salem resides at Abu Musa, which is a n island dependent on Shargah, and we cannot spare it to others. Perhaps Shlem may creator some which may break the maritime peace. I beg therefore to request that you will kindly warn Salem, and inform him that if he is desirous of living at Abu Musa, he must do so with peace, giving you as a guarantee that nothing wrong will be done by him which will disturb the maritime j jcace. But should he not choose to do so, it will be your choice either to removeTum from the island or leave us to settle the matter between us ; and we should not be called to answer in the event of our attacking each other. I leave the matter to your disposal.3 No. 4. Sheikh Sagar-hin-Khalid to Resident, Persian Gulf. (After compliments.) February 14, 1884. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 2nd February, 18&amp;4, per Mirza Abdul Kasim, and I understand its contents to the effect that anyone attempting to break the maritime peace, whether lie he Salem or any other people, shall be duly repressed. There is no doubt about this. But according to what 1 have already said, I beg to tell you that Bu Musa is our island and a dependency of Shargah. If Salem wants to live in it and guarantees that he will not commit anything which would interfere with my affairs or disturb the maritime peace, it matters not, because I cannot dispense with the Island of Bu Musa, as it is of great use to me. I beg therefore you will plainly write to me on the subject, and inform your agent of the same. No. 5. Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khalid’s Explanation of the Position in regard to Abu Musa, dated February 22, 1908. In reference to the Island of Abu Musa, it is well known to everybody that it is the jwoperty of the Sheikhs of the Jowasim of Oman, and on that point there is no doubt. As to the residence of my uncle in it, the facts of the matter are as explained below:— From olden days, from the time of my ancestors Sheikh Sultan and others, it was their habit in the days of spring, after a fall of rain and the sprouting of vegetation, to send their live-stock to the Island of Abu Musa for grazing, and also a number of our subjects from Shargah and Khan habitually sojourned on the island during the winter for fishing purposes, and had houses and huts there. In the year 1300 Hijri Sheikh Salim, who was then ruling Chief of Shargah, after sending his live-stock there as usual, went over to the island, and by the fate ordained by God the populace called upon me to become their Buler in place of Sheikh Salim, and I accepted their call and occupied the post of the Sheikhdom. It was then open to me to expel Sheikh Salim from Abu Musa Island, and I addressed the Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject in letters which must be available on your records; the first was dated the 22nd Babi-ul-Awal, 1301, and the second the 14th Babi II, 1301, but the Resident pressed me to make a peaceable settlement so that there might be no cause for a breach of the maritime peace. Accordingly we agreed that I would set apart for Sheikh Salim a pension for his subsistence—every year 600 dollars. That settlement afterwards became void by my not being able to pay the amount fixed, and subse quently a second agreement was come to between us under which I was to pay him yearly 400 dollars and also the income derived from the Island of Sir Abu Nuair, which was expected to approach 200 dollars. This agreement also became void, and in the year 1306 we made a third agreement with Sheikh Salim by the mediation of the Government Agent, and in view of the fact that up to this agreement no income had been obtainable from Sir Abu Nuair for Sheikh Salim, mention of the island was omitted and his pension remained at the previous figure of 400 dollars, but I now agreed to the return of Sheikh Salim to Shargah, and I took him into my service. Then, later on in the year 1315, I went on the Mecca pilgrimage and appointed Sheikh Salim to act for me in the Shargah Government, and on my return BTieikh Salim informed me that he had been afforded an opportunity, and had seen it to our interest, to lease the mines of Abu Musa to three persons subject to the British Government. I did not repudiate it, and saw nothing objectionable in it, and so I acquiesced in it; and seeing that Sheikh Salim had ceased not to complain that the sum of 400 dollars was not sufficient for his subsistence, I voluntarily set aside the amount of this rent for him, that it might make up his subsistence, so that the total of what came in to him yearly might be 600 dollars as before, and over, and that no cause of soreness might be left to him on account of the paucity of his allowance. I have absolutely not given him any deed in connection with the island nor in regard to the mines therein; all I did was to relinquish the income to him, in the way of financial assistance from me to him, and it was done voluntarily and at my own discretion. And I have not ceased in the days of spring in years when there has been254 9 rain and herbage to send my live-stock to the island for grazing purposes, as has been our custom from of old ; and my flag ceases not to fly there. Such are the facts of the matter, and I have recorded them for your information. (Signature and seal of Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khalid-bin-Sultan.) No. 6. Memorandum, showing the connection of the Jowasim Clan, the Ruling Chief of Shargah, and Sheikh Salim-hin-Sultan, respectively, ivith Abu Musa Island, as indicated by the Archives of the Bushire Residency, More than a century and a-half ago the Chiefs of the Jowasim Clan of Arabs, at that time paramount in authority on what was known as the “ pirate coast ” of Oman, with head-quarters at llas-el-Khaima and Shargah, crossed over to the Persian Coast with their war craft and captured the port of Lingah and other places on the coast. There they remained in occupation for upwards of a century, one of the ruling family from Itas-el-Khairna, acting as Chief of the branch of the tribe which remained on the Persian Coast; having its seat of Government at Lingah, but remaining subject to the overlordship of the ruling Chief of the head-quarters of the tribe, then at Itas-el-Khaima. At that time as now practically all the islands in the Gulf were permanently or at certain seasons tenanted by Arabs tribes ; and several of them, including Abu Musa, by the Jowasim. In the pearling season the tribal fishing-boats would have recourse to these islands for water or for refuge from stress of weather; in the spring, after rain, the various Sheikhs would send their horses and flocks for grazing, and in the winter parties of their subjects habitually sojourned in the islands for fishing purposes. Time went on and the sections of the Jowasim on the Persian Coast after some generations became as it were permanent settlers there and quarrels began to arise between parties of them and their kinsmen from Oman sojourning on the islands, when their grazing interests clashed. In order to put an end to this recurrent friction the Chiefs of the Clan came to a friendly understanding under which particular islands were henceforth to be used exclusively by different portions of the tribe. Under this understanding Abu Musa fell to the Shargah branch, and the arrangement then made has never been disturbed. While not ordinarily intervening in the internal politics of the Jowasim or other Arab tribes in Treaty relations with them, the British authorities have in practice recognized this position, and, in pursuance of their time honoured policy of maintaining the “ maritime truce,” the principles of which, as we have specifically notified to the tribes, are held to apply to the islands of the Gulf as well as its waters, we have interfered in the present instance in so far as that when alien tribesmen from Debai and elsewhere have attempted to send their flocks for grazing, or otherwise to meddle with Abu Musa Sir Bu Nuair Islands, they have been directed either to desist or first obtain the acquiescence of the ruling Sheikh of Shargah in their proceedings. It is true that on one or two occasions the Persian Government, apparently from ignorance or misconception of the history of these islands generally, have attempted to insinuate a claim to Abu Musa, but in 1888, when this claim was first asserted, in conjunction with a similar one in connection with Sirri, Colonel E. C. Boss, for eighteen years Besident in the Persian Gulf, writing to Sir Henry Drummond A\ olff. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, on the 28th April, 1888, observed: ‘‘ The claim now put forward to the Island of Abu Musi has no justification whatever and any attempt to assert Persian authority there in a practical form would lead to disturbance.” Again in April 1904 when an over zealous Belgian Customs official proceeded to the island and incontinently hauled down the Shargah flag and hoisted the Persian emblem in its place, the Persian Government ivas called upon to repair the unwarranted affront, and a British man-of-war was sent to see that it had been done and that the Arab flag was replaced with due ceremony. Thus, as far as the Jowasim are concerned the position which existed from time immemorial has been maintained up to the present moment, and every year in the spring, when and after rain has fallen and vegetation made its appearance, the ruling Sheikh of Shargah and his immediate relations have been in the habit of sending their live-stock to graze on the island. [728'; D10 So much for the abstract history of Abu Musa as an appanage^ of Shargah. We may now turn to the aspects brought into relief by the present misunderstanding in connection with the grant of a Concession for mining oxide on the island. In the year 1883, the ruling Chief of Shargah was Sheikh Salim-bin-Sultan. He had held the reins of tribal Government for about eighteen years, but his leg'.me vas a w^eak and unpopular one. • • *-. nr This Sheikh had taken a particular and enterprising interest in Abu Musa and had planted some date groves and built himself a rough residence thcic. In the spring of 1883 he was according to his habit spending a few weeks there with the tribal horses and flocks and had left his nephew, Sagar-bin-Khalid, a young man of about 25 years of age, in charge of his head-quarters at Shargah. Among these Arab Chieftains the principle of “might is right” prevails, and Sagar-bin-Khalid, finding that the majority of the tribesmen of the principality were tired of his uncle’s rule, and ready to support himself in a coup d'etat, seized the government and proclaimed himself Sheikh on the 4th April, 1883, informing the Resident of his action. The British authorities leave these questions of personnel to the wall of the tribes concerned, and usually do no more than recognize the individual whom the support and choice of the tribe puts in a position to handle the reins of government; and in this case Sheikh Sagar received recognition in due course. .As soon as he had made sure of his position he addressed the Resident (on the 17th May, 1883) saying that he now proposed to expel Sheikh Salim from Abu Musa. In reply he was reminded that the Residency had in former years specifically notified to the Trucial Chiefs that the principles of the maritime truce must be held to apply to the islands as well as the seas of the Persian Gulf, and that he should consequently endeavour to arrange a peaceable settlement with his uncle. Simultaneously Sheikh Salim left Abu Musa for Lingah, and thence wrote to the Resident asking his good offices. He in turn was advised to remain in Lingah (it being more convenient for purposes of communication) until he could come to an understanding wdtli Sheikh Sagar. Being in the weaker position Salim soon came to terms and a settlement guaranteed by the Sheikhs of Ras-el-Khaima and Debai was arrived at in July 1883, under which Sheikh Salim was to receive a pension of GOO dollars per annum for his maintenance. A copy of the settlement is attached. Sheikh Salim, however, found it difficult to refrain from intriguing against his nephew, in the hope, no doubt, of getting back the Sheikhdom. Thus, on the 21st January, 1884, Sheikh Sagar complained to the Resident of his uncle’s conduct, and in the course of his letter he wrote:— “ At present you are aw T are that Salim resides on Bu Musa, which is an island dependent on Shargah, and 1 cannot spare it to others, and perhaps Salim may create some disturbance which may break the maritime peace. I beg, therefore, that you will kindly warn Salim and inform him that if he is desirous of living at Abu Musa he must do so peaceably, you being his guarantee that nothing wrong will be done by him of a nature to disturb the maritime peace. But should he not choose to obey it will be your choice either to remove him from the island or to leave us to settle the matter between us, and in that case we should not be called to account in the event of our attacking one another. I leave the matter to your disposition.” In reply the Sheikh was informed that if cither party broke the maritime peace he would be promptly repressed. About this time the Sheikhs of Ras-el-Khaima and Debai also complained to the Resident against Sheikh Salim’s violation of the Agreement, guaranteed as it had been by themselves. On the 14th February following Sheikh Sagar again wrote to the Resident, politely urging that it was all very well for him to say that whoever broke the maritime peace, w r ould be repressed, but reminding him that Abu Musa was his— Sheikh Sagar’s property—a hereditary appanage of Shargah. He added:— If Salim wants to live there and guarantees that he will not commit anything which would interfere with my affairs, or disturb the maritime peace, so be it; but I cannot dispense with tins island, which is of the greatest use to me. I beg, there fore, that you will plainly write to me on the subject, and likewise instruct your agent.”255 n On tliis letter was recorded an office note to the following effect: — “Sheikh Sagar seems to insist that if Salim continues to live on Bu Musa he should give a guarantee through the Resident that he will not do anything to disturb him, Sheikh Sagar, or the maritime peace.” On the 5th April Sheikh Sagar wrote the Resident another letter pressing for a reply to the above. He added that he had communicated his precise object in writing to the Residency Agent, who would explain it. This was that now that spring had arrived he wished to send his horses as usual for grazing, and was not sure whether Sheikh Salim would leave them and their caretakers in peace. If the Resident would not allow him to make his own arrangements for ensuring safety of life and property on the island he wanted an assurance from the Residency that his stud would not he molested by Sheikh Salim. Sheikh Salim, however, who was now getting into financial straits, solved the difficulty himself. He made an appeal to the Residency alleging that Sheikh Sagar and the guarantors of the Agreement of 1883 had not stood by the terms of it; that they had taken away the State horses which as Sheikh of Shargah he had with him on the island when his nephew ousted him from the Sheikhdom, that he. Sheikh Salim, had had to sell all he possessed to maintain himself and now had nothing left, and that he had now come to beg his nephew to provide him with the^ wherewithal for a bare living. He declared that if he got this he w T ould remain in peace and quietude. Finally he begged our Agent to intercede for him, and to induce Sheikh Sagar to act up to the Agreement. By the advice of the Residency Agent, Sheikh Sagar, who had found the 600 dollars somewhat too much for his purse, consented to pay his uncle a reduced allowance of 400 dollars annually, half ot which only was to be paid in cash and the other half in grain and other articles. He also promised to assign to Sheikh Salim the revenue of the Island of Sir Abu Nuai'r, which contained some salt deposits and was expected to bring in about 200 dollars more. A document in the above sense was drawn up at a meeting at Ajman and there ratified. M hen reporting the conclusion of this Agreement the Residency Agent mentioned that Sheikh Salim was at present going on a visit to Ras-el-Khaima and that his family would spend the hot weather there and the winter on Abu Musa. Things went on smoothly after this tor a time, but the two Sheikhs eventually got at loggerheads again and in April 1889 our Agent reported that Salim had endeavoured to raise an attack on Shargah. On getting wind of his uncle’s intentions Sheikh Sagar, as usual, asked the advice of the British Agent and the latter soon succeeded in bringing about a friendly meeting between the tw r o resulting in the framing of a third Agreement in supercession of the preceding ones. This was to the following effect; Sheikh Sagar bound himself to pay his now aged uncle the 400 dollar pension regularly and to permit him to return to the mainland of Oman and to live where he pleased within certain limits. He also offered to take Sheikh Salim into his service as Vizier or chief adviser and to consult him in all matters affecting the interests of the State. Sheikh Salim in turn under took to serve his nephew in obedience and loyalty. A’o mention was made of Sir Bu Nuair in this Agreement because it had hitherto disappointed previous expectations and had not brought in anything. The above has held good and no further documentary agreement has since been necessary. On the conclusion of it Sheikh Salim came to live in Shargah as his nephew’s adviser and for some years past the two have been the best of friends, so much so that when Sheikh Sagar leaves his head-quarters, which he not infrequently does, he always leaves his uncle to officiate in the Government of Shargah, as he did, for instance, on his departure for the Mecca pilgrimage in 1897-8. It was on return from the said pilgrimage in 1898 that his uncle informed him of the grant of the Abu Musa Oxide Concession; when, in view of the fact that since the reduction of his pension from 600 to 400 dollars, Sheikh Salim had always been complaining of the paucity of his income. Sheikh Sagar as an act of generosity decided to let his uncle enjoy the 250 dollars annual rent fixed for the Concession and thereby cease to have cause for further discontent. Prom first to last, however, Sheikh Sugar’s acquiescence in his uncle’s enjoyment of the produce and income of the island in question, has been purely a personal and verbal arrangement which Sheikh Sagar might, at any time, ha'so terminated had he chosen to do so. JN'o deed whatever, according to the statements of the two Sheikhs themselves, has ever been given by Sheikh Sagar to his uncle in icgard to this islam.,12 although, the Island of Sir Abu Nuair did find mention in the second Agreement as above mentioned, dropping out again in the third and last because it had never brought in any income. Stronger proof of the status of the island could hardly be wanted than the declarations fu rnisher} by the two gfceiklis th emselves. 11 ^Signed) P. Z. COX. February 28, 1908. Xo. 7.

I have the honour to state that I have received your letters of the 10th March and 30th June, 1902, regarding the mines of salt and red oxide in the island of Sir Bu Nuair. No Agreement between us and Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh took place, and no document in writing was executed upon that subject. With regard to Abu Musa, my uncle Sheikh Salira-bin-Sultan cultivates in that island, and in the year in which I went on the Haj j, my aforesaid uncle was acting as my regent / (“kaim muqam”) in Shargah, and he saw fit to lease the mines of Abu Musa to ; Hassan-bin-Samayieh, a British subject , and Abdallah-bin-Hassan and Esa-bin- Abdul Latif, and the lease has remained up to now. I think your agent Abdul Latif must have informed you about it. This is what had to be written. No. 8. Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khalid to Hassan Samayieh. [Inclosure 12 of German Case.] (Translation.) (After compliments.) 9th Moharrum, 1325 (February 21, 1907). I have to inform you that Esa-bin-Abdul Latif has preferred a complaint to me in connection with the red oxide mines on Abu Musa, which for some years have been leased in the names of yourself and Esa-bin-Abdul Latif and your son Abdullah, according to the deed executed on the 18th Zilkaideh, 1315 (21st April, 1899). lie has sent me a copy of the deed of contract in operation between you and M. Wonckhaus, and complains that you executed this contract without consulting him, and that he does not agree to the conditions written in the contract now that he has come to know them. I, too, do not agree to this contract at all, and as for you, you had no right to give a contract in this fashion and bind yourself to give away possession of the whole output of red oxide to others for a long period and without consulting us or making the slightest reference to us. And, according to our view, harm will accrue to us from the continuance of this Concession in your hands in connection with Abu Musa; and your conduct in the present case is a violation of your duty towards us. Accordingly it appears to us advisable to withdraw the document of Concession from you, and we now inform you accordingly by this letter, so that you may realize that the contract between us has terminated. You have no longer any right of enjoyment in regard to the mines of Abu Musa. (Seal of Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khalid.) No. 9. Translation of the original Agreement. Be it known to all who may see this that I, Salem-bin-Sultan-bin-Sugger-el- Kasemi, let on lease all the red oxide mines situated on the Bu Musa Island to Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Samaiyeh, Abdulla-bin-Hasan, and Esa-bin-Abdul Latif, from the present date for such a period as they may wish to hold the mines, provided that they should pay me 250 Erench dollars per annum. I have likewise arranged with them that if they wished to land “ Muhar ” and “ Zenni ” oysters in the island for commercial purposes, they should pay me landing fee at the rate of 100 dollars per13 mensem. I have also given them permission to dig wells to supply water to their men who are working on the red oxide mines, and I will pay considerations and respects to their men who arc working on the mines. I have perhaps made out certain Agreements previous to this. They do not hold good, and this Agreement is to be acted upon. Written in duplicate on the 18th Zilkedah, 1315 = 10th April, 1898.

As to your remarks on the subject of the red oxide in regard to which God decreed that you sold it to the German Wonckhaus at 155. per ton, and whereas it n as arranged' that you should excavate 2,000 tons per annum, all the charges to he defrayed by you, and he to receive the oxide nett. \ ery good; I hope it is nnspieion Sr If vGll htigpo d^optune aft er t rouble. In any case, our brother Abdullah must reach there to supervise the wmrlcHo^smse I think the operations cannot be regulated without him. Please, however, refrain from entering upon any arrange ments Avhatever in the nature of leases or deeds of contract from uiiich there udll arise difficulties and quarrels which null lead to complaints and claims, because this null be difficult for our over - lord s and they will not consent to it; and you are by God’s grace u r ise and null not commit any negligence or hesitation likely to entangle you, because in these days everyone is making a trap with which to entangle people. I hope you null not be neglectful in this regard. At any rate 1 am glad to hear this news, if avc are safe from this u r orld’s tricks more than before. No. 13. Hassan Samayieh to Mr. T. Malcolm. (After compliments.) Lingah, July 13, 1906. I have received your esteemed letter dated the 26th June and perused it gladly and understood what you had stated. You had acknowledged receipt of my letter the contents of which you had understood. As regards the sale to the German, it is satisfactory, and I hope it null be fortunate. You had understood the details regarding the sale, shipment, and boat- hire, but you did not let me know about the commission; is it to be charged by us from them or by them from us ? You had written that I should send you a copy of the agreement. Very well, but the agreement has been written in German, and there is no one with us who can write such a hand. The purport ot the agreement is accurately the same as I have written to you. YAn had written to me whether we had contracted with the German for 2,000 tons per annum. Yes, we have contracted with him that the quantity should be 2,000 tons at least, and he can, according to the agreement take any more quantities which u'e may he able to obtain from the mines. You had written whether we can obtain more than this quantity, and if so, whether avc can contract with other Europeans, so that you may negotiate Avith them. I have understood this, but I cannot give the accurate quantity unless the mine is Avorked for two or three months wdien I aaTH be able to form an idea. I dispatched forty-five Avorkmen to the island in the beginning of June, but little Avork is done, it being summer and the days being hot. If more than 2,000 tons are obtained, the German is bound to take it from us. We can therefore make no other contract.257 15 1 be' also to inform you that my son Abdulla lias sold about 400 tons more or less at Calcutta. Only the freight is to be paid by us, every maund will be 1 r. 9 a delivery at Calcutta. I have been trying to procure a vessel since a long time. I have now-a-days chartered “ Alimghir,” the vessel belonging to the sons of Khoja (to ship red oxide) at 10 rupees per ton. It is now several days that she has gone to the island to ship (the oxide). ^ . TT Thank God my son Abdulla has freed himself from the dispute at Calcutta, lie has compromised with them. He has come to Bombay, and I will receive his letter from Bombay by this mail, if God pleases. I hope he wall not be detained there, and that he will settle his case with Jeita Bania and come to our parts soon. No. 14. Hassan Samayieh to Mr. T. Malcolm. (Translation.) Lingah, 2»rd Shaban, 1324 (October 14, 1906). I have received your letter dated the 20th December, 1906, and was glad to hear of your well-being. 1 have understood what you stated. Begarding my son Abdulla, I beg to say that after settling the case at Calcutta he has arrived at Bombay, where be has some easy matters to settle with the Bania. He will settle his account and will leave for our parts in two or one and aTialf months. Aou had remarked that \ ou had asked some one in the post-office to take from me a copy of the document, w Inch is in German. Let it not be hidden from you that the German, when the baigain was concluded with him, said to me that this transaction should be kept secret ( Yekoon Mastoor ”), and so I did not wish that any outsider should come to know of it, and I tear that if news of the copying of the document reaches his ears he will be annoyed. In truth, it is not my intention that anyone should come to know about it except mysell and you. What you wanted, namely, the details of the sale which had taken place, 1 have already communicated to you in a previous letter. Procedure vyill be according to that letter, neither more nor less, in pursuance of what is written in the document. No. 15. Hassan Samayieh to Abdul Latif. (After compliments.) Linguh, 2.7th Shawwal, 1324 (Deccmba 16, 1906). I wrote to vou previously. I hope the letter reached you, and that you au well. Now I forward, inclosed in this letter, a copy of the Agreement regarding the sale of oxide to Wonckhaus, a copy made according to the original. Please acknow ledge receipt. . Our news is quiet. I have nothing deserving of mention except to say all well. . _ , . . , . Inshallah, in these days w T e expect Abdullah to arrive Bombay m satet\, and on his arrival I will apprise you. No. 16. Abdul Latif to Hassan Samayieh. [Inclosure 8 of German Case.] (After compliments.) 8t/i Zilhijjah, 1324 (January 26, 1907). I have received your esteemed letter and understood what you stated. I have understood the copy of the Agreement concluded by you with the German for the sale of the Abu Musa red oxide. My son Esa does not agree to the execution of an Agreement to this effect, and you had neither consulted with, nor referred to him, nor did you send him a copy of the Agreement before the settlement with the German of the affair concerning the red oxide, so that views might be exchanged between you both, and that vou might adopt a recognized, obvious, and evident course, because it is obligatory for the partners not to undertake a matter except after a general consensus of liens, [728] F1G so that no difficulties may occur, and you have undertaken this affair without any consultation. Therefore, my son Esa does not agree to the Agreement concluded between you and the German, because he fears difficulty will result from foreigners concerning themselves in the matter. The nullification of this Agreement is better than its acceptance. —mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm You had previously received a letter (from me) saying that you should not involve yourself into difficulties with the German in regard to the red oxide, because he (Esa) fears an untoward result. I communicate to you what my son Esa says. No. 17. Abdul Latif to Hassan Samayieh. [Inclosure 10 of German Case.] (After compliments.) 12th Safar, 1325 (March 27, 1907). Your esteemed letter has reached me in due course, and I have noted its contents. II lien your communication reached me saying that you had sold to the German before mentioned oxide from Abu Musa, every year 2,000 tons of oxide at 155. per ton, I sent you back^ an answer, dated the 21 st itahi II, 1324, which purported to convev acquiescence, but in the course of the same letter I cautioned ^ou against eiitCTlT!^ into any agreement in the nature of a leasehold or intqyany rel ation l i kely to result in f ^ s Tiit£r On the grounds that the overlords ot our affairs would not agree to it. ElTSked you to give us immunity against the complications of the world (time). My letter in question is no doubt with you. Since writing it I have never received from you the copy of the deed of agreement existing between you and the German until the 5th Zilkaadeh, 1324, when it came in English after I had asked you for it time after ~£me_ I mentioned its arrival to you in my letter of the Gth Zilkaadeh, 1324. 'Abel wffen ^vegot a translator and translated the English document, it became plain to us that you had launched yourself into the very thing against which w r e had cautioned you and had tied yourself up by giving a lease. Consequently, my son Esa does not agree to this document which does not leave you any power of control or modification in regard to the oxide mines of Abu Musa. And previous to this present communication I communicated to you in my letter dated 8th Zilhijjeh a translation of the deed for your information and said that you would perceive that the question w r as not one of mere sale as stated^ by you, but one of leasehold, against which I had warned you. Moicover, Sheikh Sagar does not agree to the lease of the oxide to outsiders from foreign Towers and claims that the agreement (with him) was that you should do the work yourselves and not farm it out. This is what had to be explained. / No. 18. hough purport of a Petition from Nejef-bin-Ali, Persian subject, of Bunder Abbas, to Lieutenant Gabriel, dated February 16, 1908. (After compliments.) My father for some years performed service for the British, and as Haji Ilassan- bm-Ali Samayieh, of Lingah, is a British subiect, I therefore petition to you as follows :— Concerning the Abu Musa oxide, for which there were four concessionnaires, among whom I hold the deed of partnership of my father. My father had no other heir but myself, and therefore after his death Ilaj i Ha ssan-bin-Ali acknowledged mv rigid (ff partnersTiip as' i tC^qdirytr'TIir5Trgh ihy iatlier! 'AT^ThS'^fftt^'^hbn ifassan entered irrtn tltfra gree nTent: 'wl L1 1 'Me Wmi c k h a us he gave me no information what- e\er on the subject. Subsequently I made an arrangement with Haji Amin-ut-Tujjar to sell him oxide and sent w r ord to Hassan to this effect. Hassan then wrote me that he had made a contract elsewhere, and would inform me regarding it later. As proof that I did not in any way agree to this contract made by llassan, I point to the fact that it did not bear my signature, and when, some months later, Abdullah-bin-Hassan t 1258 17 7 and tlm Gmnai^jl iinslii.r.a.m^and asked me to sign it in token of assent, I refused to do so as 1 had not been consulted luTRTRrst idfree.—^^tftTier pFob! of my ri-ht in the Concession I may mention that in 1901 Abdullah-bin-Hassan had a case in Calcutta against ]\lessrs. Sassoon concerning the Abu Musa oxide, but seeing that the oxide had been sold in the name of my father, the case could not be proceeded with until I had furnished a power of attorney for the Calcutta Court—a copy of this is doubtless on your Consulate records. (Note by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul: The Consulate fee-book shows that Nejef paid 5s. fees for the execution of a power of attorney on the 29th October, 1901.) Now I complain that from the time that Hassan has been actively engaged in the oxide work of Bu Musa, I have not received 1 dinar or the proceeds, although all the work on the island formerly devolved upon my at icr, who himself found the implements, &amp;c., for working the oxide, which implements are even now at the island. Besides all this, there were 250 carpets which belonged to my father, and which verc sent to Calcutta for sale.^ Abdullah-bin-Hassan wanted to settle up the account ior them in Calcutta, but until I gave a power of attorney they would not settle with bun. liassan subsequently collected all the money, but I have never been able to recover any of it from him. . I pray you of your goodness to look after my rights and to obtain me iustice against Hassan. ■h O</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000d8_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/321</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000d8</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/321</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 4949/1912 Pt 4 ‘Abu Musa – Angelegenheit. 1907.’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1907/1908</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-01-31T22:30:55</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ger</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">per</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (263 folios)</extent><extent>The file’s contents are arranged in approximate chronological order, from the earliest item at the front to the latest at the end.The subject 4949 (Abu Musa oxide) consists of six volumes, IOR/L/PS/10/318-323.

The dispute was sparked by the Ruler of Sharjah, Shaikh Ṣaqr bin Khālid Āl Qāsimī’s cancellation of the concession in 1907, and subsequent claims by Wönckhaus and Company and the German Government, over financial losses arising from the cancellation of the concession.Amongst the papers are copies of correspondence, agreements and other papers dating between 1892 and 1907, relating to the original contract to mine red oxide at Abū Mūsá.
