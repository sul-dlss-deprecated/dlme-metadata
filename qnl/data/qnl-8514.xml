The file is a chronological continuation of papers found in Coll 28/26 ‘Relations with H.M.G Importation of Stores for I.E.T.D. Staff’ (IOR/L/PS/12/3423). The correspondence focuses on the payment of customs duty on materials imported by I&amp;ICL, and efforts to negotiate an exemption of the payment of duty with the Persian Government. The file’s principal correspondents are: various representatives of I&amp;ICL; HM’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Tehran; the Foreign Office.The file includes a printed copy of the 1932 agreement (in English and French) between the British and Persian Governments, for the withdrawal of the Indo-European Telegraph Department from Persia (ff 116-119).The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Telecommunications equipment</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Cable and Wireless Ltd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Henjam</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Jask</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bushire</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Charbar</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Customs duty</topic></subject><subject><topic>Indo-European Telegraph Line</topic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral agreements</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00001f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00001f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
