General agreement has been reached that Germans must be expelled from Iran as soon as possible. It may be possible to effect this by Anglo-Russian diplomatic pressure (perhaps including inposition of economic sanctions). TAdditiona l show of force. Failing this force must be used so that phase one of plan involves as sembly o j. certain air forces in Irao ?for the present that will be striking force on Persian frontier in Basra area and assembly of small mixed expedition at head of the Persian Gulf. Phase two, which would follow Iranian rejection of our demands would consist of aerial bombardment of military objectives in Tehran direction, advance striking force from Basra to occupy Abadan and Oil Fields and seizure by mixed force of Bandar Shahpur and shipping there. Russian co-operation in Northern Iran is expected. 4 * We are Pressing forinclusion of occupation of Bushire in phase two on grounds that (a) it is head quarters of Persian Gulf Residency and seat of British prestige/ Telegram S.

Should Bushire operations not be feasible you and at least some of your staff and records must be evacuated before other operations begin though we recognize ; that such a course is inconsistent with general scheme to inplement ultimatum by offensive action. 5. For reasons which will be apparent to you we have had to advise that no attempt be made to evacuate British and Indian subjects in remainder of Iran. 6 .

I feel that the results that will flow from this have not been fully appreciated. 3. Feeling in Persia is at present if anything pro- German especially in the arny. If we move troops into Persia and above all bring in Russians this feel ing will instantly turn to bitter hatred of us. Even if there were no serious opposition to our occupation of the oil areas this would throw the Persian Government and people into the arms of the Germans who would pose as their deliverers and by technical advice to the army and bribes to the Tribes would soon force us to commit ourselves more deeply than we wish, in fact I doubt if less than five well equipped British Divisions would make any headway at all. I feel therefore (though I appreciate you are better informed) that by far our best policy is to continue our pressure and secure the ejec tion of the Germans by degrees unless a rapid deterior ation in the Russian situation dictates othervd.se. tit4. Hughes (who has not yet arrived in Persia and whose tour will take some time) has come round to the view that Bushire should be held as a hostile air force there can contain equal forces at Basra and Bah rain. If I left Bushire I should have to take the families of my staff as it would be inpracticable to take them and leave their families in the lurch* 5. So far as I know it is unprecedented for us to attack a country without giving British subjects a chance to withdraw, and since we are to make a show of force, an evacuation even if only partial would show greater determination to implement the threat* I would therefore strongly urge that the Minister be ad vised to repeat his earlier evacuation instructions and that a reasonable time be allowed for British subjects to act upon them before military action is taken. Reference your paragraph 6 . Unless I hecxr to the contrary I will go down to Bushire on August 10th. I would be most grateful for any intima tion whether this date can be extended as X now have the minimum stafx necessary and an early move will cause avoidable casualties through sickness.

His Majesty's Government have decided to present ultimatum to Iranian Government within the next fortnight. 2. Military authorities regard proposed Bushire operations as undesirable commitment and it will not take place. It follows that you, with indispensible staff and essential secret records must leave Bushire os tensibly on tour before ultimatum. Ship will call at Bushire on August 10 th apparently on ordinary ,T down slow' run for this purpose. We leave it to you to select essen tial staff to acconpany you but would enphasise that even if hostilities break out those who remain ( who must in clude British Officer to remain in charge of Consulate General) will be in no danger since they will be covered by immunity accorded in all countries to Consular staff You will from this realise that His Majesty's Government have decided against evacuation even of non-official British subjects from Iran. 3.

At present Persian public are almost unaware that question of expelling Germans exists and are quite unprepared for our demands. Decision will rest with Shah who if not given lead by public or army (who have no desire to fight England still less Russia) may possibly reject our demands without more ado. 3. Unless therefore you anticipate immediate coup by Germans I feel campaign of nerves woulc be very effective in reducing any possibility of Persian opposition. If it were brought home to them by radio 'neutral observers ' etc. that they ran risk of attack by keeping Germans they would soon swing round to view that they could well do without them. 4.

Appointment of Military Commander for Persian Gulf. FOR USE BY DEPARTMENT ONLY. MUTUTE . On June the 5th the War Office telegraphed to the C.in C. India, their agreement that India should nov/ assume responsibility for the control of all land defence measures in the Persian Gulf less Kov/eit, the responsibility for air operations remaining under the A.O.C. Iraq. (Previously the vdiole of this responsibility had rested v/±th the latter). The telegram below from the C.in C. India to the War Office shows that the Chiefs of Staff in India have lost no time in examining the question of the defence of the Persian Gulf area. Moreover, they have already appointed a military commander for the Persian Gulf and have sent him on reconnaissance with rer)resentatives of the C.in C. East Indies and the A.O.C. Iraq. This mission Yn.ll consult the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. As regards the Arab Coast, the telegram mentions particularly Bahrein and Sharjah. The A. A. defence of Bahrein is discussed in the notes at Ext.2868/41, flagged in the attached collection No. 30/192, v/hich also contains information about other defence measures at Bahrein. We do not seem to have heard anything about the defence of Sharjah since we received the appreciation dated January, 1939, in collection No. 30/194, attached.2 . As for the Persiar Coast, the telegram suggests that a small t orce may have to be sent to Bushire (? to evacuate British nationals) from Iran or, if circumstances v/ere favourable, to support tribal activity in conjunction with action from the A, I.O.c/area. Although this does not necessarily mean that Bushire would be held against enemy attac':, it will involve a review, in consultation with the olitical Resident, of the decision reached last August by the r.in 0. Middle East, and endorsed by (see telegram to the G-ovemraent of India Ho.5505 of September the 18th, flagged). This decision ms that, notwithstanding the recommendations of the Government of India and the Political Resident, unless circumstances altered materially, Bushire should be evacuated and not defended, only a small naval force being sent there to cover* the evacuation. The telegram mentions that it is essential to ensure the security of the Straits of Hormuz. It is fortunate that the Government of India have recently secured, in competition with the Japanese, a contract for the purchase of a large quantity of salt from one island of tha 1 name. This removes a potential menace and will give them an opportunity to extend their influence there. Par Staff for any observations. ... . . ) ) Yes, * L.S.A. ^ / E.Y/.R. LUMBY, 25.vi.Al.

It has, however, been accepted that it is unnecessary and undesirable to send a battalion to Bushire. One of the conclusions at the 1st Meeting of the Ccmmittee under the Chairmanship of the Lord President of the Council (l(p)(41 ) 1) was that the Admiralty would arrange to have a warship lying off Bushire to secure the safety of the Resident and of the British Indian corranunity there. While the reasons for the absence of the Resident from Bushire at a time of emergency are clear, in the absence of any authoritative statement that this would be desirable, I would personally prefer to see him at Bushire. This would fall in line with the opinion expressed in I(P)(41) 1, that evacuation of the British personnel from Persia would not be possible before the presentation of an ultimatum, and would add strength to our argument that all we wished was the expulsion of Germans and the safety of the oilfields. In present circumstances it looks as if the Resident’s stay at Bahrein may be somewhat prolonged, but you are no doubt aware that the question of evacuation from Persia is still under consideration (W.M. (41 )82). I therefore suggest that the telegram to the Government of India be amended to convey the sense of paragraph 2 above, while omitting reference to the preference of Service representatives for the absence of the Resident at a time of emergency.

I agree as to wisdom of your decision to send Resident to Bahrein. In discussions on action to he taken in Persia it was made clear hy the Service representatives,that they were definitely averse from having to send a Battalion to Bushire since the Battalion would have to be borrowed from Iraq and this would entail further shipping. They therefore expresst/oreference that the Resident should not be at Bushire at the time when it might be necessary to issue an ultimatum to the Persian Government,though the Admiralty were prepared if that could not be arranged to instruct a sloop to lie off Bushire to take off the Resident and his staff in case of need.No. 276-S (Text FILE COPY afriOFTmmwYML Se cret ** VX T, 1 31 27 .Kf' V &lt;\v . 1 ian ( The Hon’ble the Political Residiml ,in the PpbjanjGulf presents his compliments to R#T# Peel, Esquire, G#B#E#, M#C* The India Office, London. and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned document (s). 2- Copy of Residency letter No.lOl-S, dated the 29th January 1941, has not been sent to the India Office. 1st May 1941.

At the beginning of the war it was decided, for the reasons on which Peel touches in his letter P.

It would in any case have been difficult, for reasons on which I need not enlarge here, to maite this raO' r © the occasion of any concession from the Iranian Government, all the more since it would not have made any difference to the official situation, the fact that the Consul-Generalis also the Resident being officially ignored by the Iranian Government.

T 5 z. ^ Dear Gibson, You are no doubt considering the implications of the Government of India’s t elegram No&gt; 6280, of July 26th, about defending Bushire. The following comments represent my personal views only. 2. The arguments which the Government of India and the Political Resident put forward for the defence of this port seem to be: ( 1 ) the general loss of prestige which would be involved in evacuation; ( 2 ) the desirability of not letting the port and aerodrome (and, for that matter, the northern coast of the Persian Gulf as a whole) fall into enemy hands; (3) interference with the cables; (4) the administrative inconvenience which the lack of suitable alternative accommodation would cause to the work of the Persian Gulf Residency; (5) the loss of the Residency buildings, which could not be replaced under 25 lakhs of rupees; ( 6 ) the possible loss of the records. 3. To take the last point first, I feel that our policy should not depend upon possible danger to the records. If there are any original documents which are of value in the Residency archives, now, I suggest, is the time to move them to some safer place. / k*-. &gt;y i. V z. H-tr-**. J. P. Gibson, Esq. RECo. POL. DCPt. -7 AUG 940 INDIA OFFICE 4./4. As regards the Residency buildings, which I have myself seen and stayed in, I should have thought that it would have been possible to replace them, either at Bushire or elsewhere, for less than 25 lakhs; but, even assuming that this would be the cost, I suppose that the cost^f sending and maintaining an occupying force might be even greater. 5. As regards the administrative inconvenience, everyone would naturally regret this. But I should not have thought that it would have been utterly impossible for the Political Resident to carry on under war conditions from some place such as Bahrein, even though the accommodation for himself and his staff, both for offices and residences, might be far below the standards they would have a right to expect in normal times. 6 . This leaves us with what may be regarded as the three main reasons, i.e. prestige, the strategic value of the Persian coast and the cables. 7. To take, again, the last point first, I was under the impression that when the cable system was reorganised about four years ago, the intention was to put in a direct link between Bahrein and Pao, so that a cable would run from Karachi to the Shatt-el-Arab without ever touching the Persian coast. Assuming, however, that this was never done, or never intended, and that all the cables still pass through Bushire, I quite agree with what the Government of India and Prior say about the difficulty of doing away with the Bushire connexion without the consent of the Iranian Government and without considerable disturbance to our communications with Iran. 8 . But this view only holds good for normal conditions. If we were engaged in hostilities either with the Iranian Government or with some other Power which had invaded Iranian territory (and, leaving aside the question of the transfer to Bahrein, which is a different thing altogether, nobody has ever, so far as I know, contemplated the evacuation of Bushire except in some such circumstances) matters would be very different. It is probable tnat by the time things had reached the stage where we could no longer keep the Residency at Bushire without sending a military/'T^jLo dim koo X|&gt;p y - Km iifi, fyrnt C/»rtJ. ft*** ^ica-e*^* CtxItUj a**- m WuJ • cV) Iff 43S i ; 1940 J military force to protect it, we should have no interest in maintaining this particular line of communication with the interior of Iran and no need or no possibility of taking into account the wishes of the Iranian Govern ment. 9. Whether in these circumstances we could cut out the Bushire connexion by running a new length of cable direct from one of the Pao-Bushire cables to the Bushire- Bahrein or Bushire-Karachi cables, and then cutting these latter cables, would presumably depend upon our having a cable-ship and the requisite length of cable ready (I seem to remember being told at the time of the cable reorganisation that all the existing cables are too brittle to allow of their being moved from one position to another). Similarly, the question whether we could even now make a direct connexion between Bahrein and Pao, without disturbing the existing cables to Bushire, presumably depends upon our possessing the necessary resources, as to which I have no information. 10. The question of the strategic value of the Persian coast is one about which the Foreign Office has nothing to say, although it seems obvious that if one had the troops to defend it, one would want to deny it to one’s enemy. 11# . ?inally » there is the very important question of prestige. I quite agree that the evacuation of Bushire might have an adverse effect throughout the Persian Gulf region. But I think the evacuation of the oilfields would have a far stronger effect. In saying this, I quite realise that things often happen differ ently irom what one expects and that circumstances might arise which required a decision about the evacuation of Bushire to be taken, altnough no question of our occupy ing the oilfields might have arisen. But generally speaKing, I think it holds true that we are only likely to be faced with a threat to Bushire if we have already been faced with a general threat to our position in Iran as a whole, and in that case what we could do at Bushire would depend on what we could do in Iran as a whole.12 . I have left to the last the point made by Bullard about using Bushire as a place of assembly for British subjects from the interior. If trouble does come in Iran, we must of course do our best to get British subjects safely away. But the British subjects woi&gt;^I have to reach Bushire, if they were to do so at all, in advance of the enemy, whoever he might be, and it might be possible to get them away elsewhere before any military threat to the port developed. If not, we should have to do what the circumstances of the moment allowed us to do, but I should doubt its being possible to decide in advance that one would send a force to Bushire, if other con siderations were not conclusive one way or the other, merely on account of this possibility. 13. I am sending a similar letter to Mallaby, at the War Office.indexed 3xK. » (j, )uJLc*+- 2713.. Addressed to Secretary of State for India, XXX repeated to Buahire, Tehran telernrain .'^, ^0 2.

We have received since, a copy of (print ecu lette r of June 13 ih addressed to Middle Bast, which we have fbrwarded by Air Mail. Our conclusions on political aspect after considering printed views ere as folIov;s. 3. Minister at Tehran and Political Resident are in agreement that Bushire should be defended and used as a base for evacuation of British subjects in Iran in case of necessity but that no such move should be made except to s.ynchr mise with occupation of oil areas and in lad: resor t. Our interests at Bushire are as follows: (a.) Headquarters of Political Resident, evacuation of which after a period of some 200 years would lead to great loss of prestige. Property, moreover, is worth some Ps.25 laldis,. end there is no alternative headquarter for Resident. (b) Cable from Karaclii to Bushir©, two cables from Pao te Bushire and one from Bahrain to Bushire are brought to land at Bushire. It has been , t| suggested that these should be lifted and rejoined at sea but this -would be * | difficult except as last resort without the consent of Iranian Government. Moreover main traffic not only l)etween India and'Iraq but between Jlndia and Iran now passes through these cables. direless alternative, in opinion fci P.T.O.(J » ^ - 2 - of Political Resident, would not be'able to carry traffic, which is heavy. , (c) Eushire is terminus of trans-Iranian (? main) road and best port on Persian shore of Gulf. (d) There is an aerodrome and a flying boat anchorage, possession of vdiich might be of importance to Gulf communications. 5. Generally, we feel division of responsibility for control of civil administration and defence is one reason for difficulty in arriving at conclusions in this matter. General Staff in India for instance, though responsible for Intelligence in Eastern Iran have no operational control, while naval matters in Gulf are under the control of Commander-in-Chief, East Indies. Similar problems may well arise, e.g. in respect of Bahrain or Koweit. 6, We are clear that from -purely poli ticnl print nf view, it is necessary that Bus hire should be defended if threatened, especially by Soviet, and indeed that Persian littoral of Gulf should be denied to enemy as part of India’s defence and to secure comnixnications in this area. We agree that operation would probably be linked with defence of Iraq and Persian oilfields if latter materialises. As whole question of* operations in this area is now under consideration of His Majesty’s Government, we are (? anxious) that this particular problem should not be omitted from the picture.Telegram b.

Activities of large and growing German colony here suggest Germans might attempt a coup of some kind on trie lines familiar in Europe. Whatever form move took it would doubtless involve hostility to British interests. A.P.O.C. are alive to danger but Consuls should consider possibility in its widest aspects and report by telegraph giving approximate number of Hermans and whether obviously organised or not. Although possibility is perhaps remote it would be wise to burn unostentatiously secret papers that are not required and to be prepared to burn at a moment’s notice cyphers and current confidential papers. it is not suggested Iranian j-overnment woulci approve illegal German activities but they seem supine probably because of fear of Russia. bullard.Telegrara ^ • ij'rom Political Resident, Bushire.

As stated in paragraph 3 of your letter, the policy of the Soviet Government appears to he causing the Persian Government much anxiety, while the interruption of Persian trade with Germany has led them to desire an extension of their trade with the United Kingdom and India. It would, therefore, hardly seem a suitable occasion for the Persian Government to enter into a dispute on any subject with His Majesty’s Government and with the Government of India. 4. Lord Halifax also agrees that the practical difficulties which the presence of the Political Resident on Persian soil present to the Persian Government, from the point of view of the maintenance by them of an attitude of strict neutrality, are lessened by the fact that Italy has so far remained neutral in the present war. 5. In His Lordship’s view, however, the statements in paragraph 1 of the Political Resident’s telegram/telegram of the 10th November regarding Italian belligerency and in paragraph 2 of the same telegram to the effect that, since the Arab States are taking no active part in the war, it follows that there is nothing unusual about the Resident to which the Persian Government could take exception, are founded on a misunderstanding of what was meant by views expressed upon these subjects in the past* The arguments in favour of the removal of the Residency to the Arab side of the Persian Gulf were dependent upon Italian belligerency. The whole position of the Resident in Persia is anomalous, in peace as in war, and Tehran t despatch No.305 of the 31st August, 1938, to which reference is made in the Resident’s telegram, was only intended, in His Lordship's view, to convey the meaning that the outbreak of war between His Majesty’s Government and Italy would make it essential to put into immediate execution the plan, which would in any case sooner or later be inevitable, for the transfer of the Residency from Persia, at any rate to the extent of requiring the Resident himself to live outside Persia while the war lasted. Nor is the fact that the Arab States are not taking an active part in the war, in any case conclusive in itself, since His Majesty’s Government are using their territory as if it were their own, and His Majesty’s Government are unquestionably at war themselves.6* However, as stated in paragraph 4, Lord Halifax agrees that, from the point of view of the Persian Government, the practical objections to the retention of the Residency at Bushire are less pressing so long as the area of military operations is not extended to the Middle East. Moreover, he strongly shares the view, expressed in paragraph 3 of the Government of Indie, telegram of the 26th October, that every effort should be made to increase the political and economic influence of His Majesty’s Government and of the Government of India in Persia. While for the reasons given in paragraphs 9 and 10 bellow he does not consider that the presence of the Resident at Bushire is in fact a very efficacious means of furthering the aims of the two governments in this respect, it seems to him desirable on general grounds to avoid any action which could be interpreted as showing a decrease of their interest anywhere in Persia; and for all these reasons he is prepared to agree that no initiative should be taken in the direction of moving the Residency from Bushire until the international situation is clearer. 7. I am, however, to point out that it is only a surmise that the fear of the Soviet Union felt by the Persian Government and their wish to increase their trade with the United Kingdom and India, will prevent them from raising the question of the retention of the Residency in Persia throughout the present war* The immediate menace from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and also, perhaps, the desire of Persia not to alienate the goodwill of the German Government, have ded/led. them. In common with other countries, to seek to preserve the strictest neutrality, and Lord HaliTax would not think it right to exclude the possibility that, if any question connected with the Residency arose which appeared to threaten this policy, the Persian Government might feel themselves compelled to ask for the immediate removal of the Residency, even at the risk of thus forfeiting the goodwill of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. 8* It will be remembered that Lord Halifax and his predecessors have throughout urged that the Residency should be moved to the Arab side of the Gulf while this could be done at a moment convenient to all concerned and without any appearance of a surrender on the part of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India to pressure from the Persian Government# As already stated, His Lordship agrees that the Residency may be left at Bushire, but this is on the understanding that he can accept no responsibility for the consequences (e#g# as regards prestige on the Arab coast) if, subsequently, it has to be removed at short notice at the request of the Persian Government. Nor can he regard himself as committed to the view that any such request would have to be resisted, even to the point of risking a serious dispute with the Persian Government. He would not wish to attempt to define now what policy he would recommend in such circumstances, but I am to make it clear that, if the transfer is postponed/postponed, it is at least possible that it may become necessary to move the Residency outside Persia, or at least for the Resident personally to leave Persia, in circumstances which would involve inconvenience to those concerned, and some damage to the prestige both of His Majesty^ Government and of the Government of India on the Arab coasto 9* In conclusion, I am to offer certain observations on paragraphs 2-5 of Government of India telegram of the 26th October, and paragraph 3 of the Political Resident’s telegram of the 10th November, in which reference was made to various additional considerations which were hold to make the retention of the Residency in Persia desirable. Without feeling able to accept much that is said in these paragraphs, Lord Halifax agrees, as has been said in paragraph 6 above, that it is very desirable to increase the political and economic influence in Persia of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. He also agrees that it is very desirable to increase the supply of intelligence from Persia, and that, in the event of it becoming necessary in certain circumstances to send an expeditionary force from India which might enter a part of Persia, it would be essential that such a force should be accompanied by an experienced Political Officer from the Indian service, with knowledge of conditions in Persia. 10. Lord Halifax shares, however, the view expressed/expressed by Sir Horace Seymour in his telegram of the 7th November, that, as Bushire is outside the stream of development in Persia, the presence of the Political Resident there cannot, under existing conditions, increase the political or economic influence of the two governments. It is, in his opinion, equally unlikely that Bushire could usefully be made a centre for an improved Intelligence system, or that, so far as British and Indian interests in Persia are concerned, there is anj vork to be done there that could not adequately be carried out by a Consulate-General, or even a Consulate, staffed, if might be, from the Indian service, but having no connexion with the Residency for the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. This latter view holds good even if the possibility of a decrease in the power of the Central Government is assured. 11« Finally, Lord Halifax fully agrees, as has been said in paragraph 9, that any Indian expeditionary force to Persia should be accompanied by an experienced Political Officer from India. But he suggests that there is no particular reason why this official should be the same person as the Political Resident. The first aim of any such force would presumably be to ensure the security of the oilfields in Khuzistan which can be reached as easily, perhaps more easily, from Bahrein or Koweit than from Bushire; and in any case any/any Political Officer accompanying an expeditionary force of the kind indicated above would presumably be required to devote his whole time to the problems arising from the expedition, and could not carry out other functions elsewhere in the Gulfo 12.

Had this occurred there was danger of Arab States becoming actively involved, a position which has happily not arisen and which becomes (? remoter) daily. 2. Since (?

There is, therefore, nothing to prevent his return especially since experience shows that unduly prolonged absence makes working extremely difficult. It is highly improbable that Persians will raise difficulties (Y while) they themselves are seeking assistance from the Government of India. I agree with the views expressed in paragraph No.6 ICd.

I have no information on how things have actually developed in the Arab states, but it would be a serious mistake to risk drawing upon the Iranian Government, German complaints that the Consul-General residing in Iran was being allowed to go beyond permissible functions. In my opinion, the presence of Political Resident at Bushire , which is quite outside the stream of modern develop ment of Iran, cannot under existing conditions, increase the political or economic influence either of India or of the United Kingdom. As I have already reported, the transfer to the United Kingdom and India of trade formerly done with Germany would be the most effective step in this direction if we can supply the goods which Iran reouires. Trade questions can, for practical purposes be dealt with in Tehran. In general I'think that while Iranian susceptibilities are upset at the doubling of the posts of Political Resident and Consul-General, the present officials of the Ministry of foreign Affairs are not much interested, but as the staff changes very rapidly we cannot count on the continuance of this attitude.

Sir, / I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that the Government of India have had under consideration, in consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the bearing of the circumstances of the present war upon the proposals for the erection of a new Residency at Bahrein and upon the question of the location of the Resident’s headquarters during the period of hostilities. Their views have been / communicated in a telegram of the 26th October, a copy of / which is enclosed herewith. The Government of India have subsequently stated that this telegram has been repeated uo His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran and also to the Middle East Intelligence Centre, Cairo. 2. V/ith regard to the proposals for the construction of the Residency at Bahrein, the present position is that detailed estimates and plans have been communicated to the Treasury for consideration in consultation with the Office of Works. The latest estimate of the cost of the Residency was stated by the Government of India in July to be approximately Rs.20^: lakhs, though the possibility of some small reduction in this sum was not excluded. Hitherto the Government oi India have declined in any circumstances to/ The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S . v : y • 1 *4 2 . to pay more than Rs.6 lakhs of the total cost of the new building; but, even though on this basis they would not be affected by any increase in building charges, they suggest nevertheless that a scheme which has never commanded their full support should be reconsidered m the light of present circumstances. On financial grounds alone Lord Zetland feels that it would be inexpedient to proceed with building proposals which are not urgently necessary at a time when costs are presumably rising, an it may be difficult to foresee what relation the final cost would bear to the present estimates. He would propose therefore that further action should be suspended ±or the present on the proposal for the construction of the Residency at Bahrein. 3. As regards the retention during the war of the Resident’s personal connection with Bushire, it will be recalled that the question of his continued presence at Bushire was under consideration some time before the outbreak of war when it was generally assumed that when war occurred it would be necessary for the Resident to withdraw from Bushire in order to avoid giving the Persian Government any cause for complaint that he was carrying out on Persian soil functions that might be considered incompatible with his residence in a neutral country. There have however been indications recently that there may be less risk of Persian objections to the presence of the Resident on Persian soil in time of war uhcux was supposed* The Persian Government raised no objection when asked to agree to Major Prior’s appointment, and it is reported that the attitude of the Persian authorities at/5 . at Bushire at the end of August was more friendly than for years past. So far as Lord Zetland is aware uhere has 'been no sign since the war started of any desire on the part of the Persian Government to demand the withdrawal of the Resident from Bushire and it would perhaps seem improbable that at a time when their anxieties about Soviet policy are acute they would wish to invite a dispute with His Majesty’s Government over a Question of this kind. 4. Major Prior s who left Bushire early in Septemoer and has fixed his headquarters temporarily at Koveit, has informed the Government of India that he will be obliged to return to Bushire from time to time, and the Government of India for their part think it very desiraole that he should maintain contact with Bushire. It certainly seems inadvisable to sever, unless this should oecome necessary, any link which might facilitate the obtaining of information and the exertion of British influence in Persia including South Persia, at the present time. A further reason for the Resident’s maintaining contact with conditions in South Persia, is the importance, as pointed out by the Government of India, of having a senior political officer with Persian and Indian experience available in South Persia in the event of a serious threat to the security of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s property, particularly as the measures that might have to be taken in that event in defence of the oil fields might include the despatch of Indian troops. Lord Zetland, therefore, feels that there is force in the considerations advanced by the/the Government of' India ana ne hopes that Lord Halifc-x will agree that the Resident should maintain personal contact with Bushire, as proposed hy them. It also seems desirable that any steps that may he necessary should he taken to ensure adequate liaison between the Resident and His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz. 5.

Persian Gulf .Residency. As you are aware we have again been considering the question of incidence of Persian Gulf expenditure and expenditure in Iran together with linked question of transfer of Residency from Bushire to Bahrain. Government of India have always regarded transfer of Residency as of doubtful advantage. Since our liability is in any case limited to six lakhs of rupees we are not affected by any increase in building costs due to war; but we are naturally anxious not to incur any avoidable expenditure. We have seen no signs as war develops of a desire on part of Iranian Government to make demand that Resident should, leave Bushire and both Fowls and Prior have reported that local attitude of Persian authorities which is now always dictated from Tehran has been more friendly recently than for many years. We suggest therefore that this question now be reconsidered. . 2. Apart from finanoial considerations there are other grounds for postponing move. We think that war developments RECd. POL. DEPt. 27 OCT1939 INDIA OFFICE will/6745 1939 will force on His Majesty v s G-overnment a re-orientation of their plans in this quarter. For some time partly as legacy of last war nut pnir^i ^ Iran, alone of the four MB* SaadLahad powers has 'been inclined to withdraw further from His Majesty's Government and she has also offered scope to German penetration on considerable scale. Our reports show that Iran equally with Afghanistan is intensely nervous of new Soviet attitude and expects, if she has not already experienced, strong pressure from Russia hoth political and economic to amend her tendency to comparative autarky. It must at present remain a matter of speculation whether Russian and German pressure will he extended to endeavour to control exports from Persian oilfields hut we suppose possibility of such development must, he faced. 3. For these reasons ^sic ’) v/e think it important that every effort should be made to increase political and economic influence of His Majesty-’s Government and Government of India in Iran. Supply of intelligence from Iran is at present lamentably deficient and cannot he improved until British status in that country has acquired added prestige. Iranian Government have already asked for India’s assistance in obtaining railway materials and sugar in large quantities and for markets for wool. We shall shortly he addressing you on possibilities of assistance by India in the development of trade with Iran as means of increasing political influence. If His Majesty 9 s Government agree that political and economic influence of hoth countries should he increased then adequate representation of India's Prospective/? 6745 prospective trade and political interests also requires presence of the Resident on Persian soil. This is an added argument fja favour of cancellation of the plans for move of the Residency for duration of the war. In any case during the war we anticipate that the Resident will spend much of his time on tour and to this end we have recently agreed to the provision of special asa transport. Tn the event of development of serious threat to Persian oil fields we need not stress importance of having available senior Political Officer with Persian and Indian experience in South Persia.\V' FJj-E COPY VT 1 ■ XT, 6302 Allotted Political Deijartment, v (l £ groups) ^ 7 ^ martment.

Your telegram 1829^ dated October 15th. I can see no I justification whatever for proceeding with construction of Residency at (? Bahrain) during the war. Prices of building material, e.g. cement, are rising rapidly and there is already difficulty and delay in obtaining shipments. Since detailed plans do not exist, work cannot be commenced for at least six months by which time cost may be astronomical. 2. It is only (? London) Foreign Office and Minister who desire Resident to leave. Iranian Government granted my exequat ur without comment and,so far as I know, they have never raised any objection to continuance of headquarters at Bushire. Their sole reference to the subject was the polite request in 1932 that, in the event of our giving up Sabzabad, they might be given first refusal of buildings. I found them more agreeable than at any time in last thirteen years and Fowie confirmed this. It is not necessary to locate headquarters at Bahrain, but in view of present importance of Arab coast and to facilitate communication I propose to make Koweit (where some accommodation exists) temporary base on this side. 3. I shall be obliged to return to Bushire from time to time and any objection raised by Minister will have to be faced and overcome. Apart from other cogent reasons, to accept exile for duration of war would be to play into Minister’s' hand. ^ !

(I am assuming that, whatever the theory, there will in practice be neutrals in a future war)# In fact I think tnat in such a case the Resident should at once remove his headquarters to some place where he can be sure of functioning without interference.* 1 In paragraph 4 of Foreign Office letter of 15th / R. T. Peel Esquire, MG* , The India Office, London# 2 &gt; NOV 1938- 2 - 15th October 1933, Baxter writes: * AS regards the removal of the Residency in the event of a war in which we are engaged and Persia is neutral, this point was mentioned at the recent Middle East (official) meeting to consider ways of influencing Minor Powers and Arab States, but was not discussed. It seems to us inevitable, however, that the Resident would have to move at once and I suggest that plans for his removal and establishment elsewhere should be kept ready.* 1 agree j with both Seymours and Baxter’s views. Indeed when .ve tfere on the verge of war at the end of last September what I had in mind was to remain on the Arab Coast with headquarters at Bahrain with ray Confidential staff, leaving Bushire to be carried on by the consul (Galloway) and the remainder of the staff. 5. This would have been quite practicable and was in fact the method adopted during my leave Home from 2nd August to 22nd September of this year. Weightman, Political Agent, Bahrain, acted as Resident for me, and Gallcway remained as Consul, Eushire. It would act equally well I think, in time of war. If war had actually come last September the Persians could have made no objection to the above arrangements as the Resident would have been out of Persian territory, while Galloway, who would have remained in Bushire, is an accredited Consul. From our point of view I could have still kept in touch with Galloway by post and telegraph, which would have continued functioning more or less as in time of peace. I 1 suggest therefore that in the event of war in the future this procedure be adopted. If the war were prolonged probably the /-3- the staff at Bahrain would become larger and that at Bushire smaller e.g. the officer finally left in Bushire might be the Vice consul* 6. With regard to (b). The circumstances under which this eventuality might arise were dealt with in paragraphs 4 and 8 of the STote accompanying my letter No*c/l4, dated the ^ 18th January last. In this connection* the 'provisional** conclusion arrived at by the Informal Interdepartmental Meeting held at the India Office on the 14th April was that in case of a threat to Bushire it should not be reinforced by troops, but if necessary should be evacuated. This conclusion still remains 'provisional*. 7. We might have to evacuate Bushire because* (1) Persia had actually declared war on us, or (2) following on the death of the present Shah a state of anarchy existed which coincided with the outbreak of war, and which gave elements hostile to us opportunity of showing this hostility. It was situation (2) which existed during the last War when, notwithstanding that the Persian Government w a s officially neutral, our Consuls at Kerman, Shiraz and Ispahan were taken prisoners by the Nationalists - urged on thereto by Wassmuss the well-known German Agent. The Consuls at Kerman and Ispahan, together with members of the local British communities, were marched down to the co a st (from Kerman to Bandar Abb a s, fron Ispahan to near Khorramshahr) and then released. The Consul at Shiraz, together with the local Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia (now the Imperial Bank of Iran) were kept /-4- kept prisoners by Wassmuss and his Tangiatani tribesmen for several months and finally sent in to Bushire in exchange for Tang1stani prisoners which our Bushire force had captured. Q' in a future war situation (l) existed (*hich covered by part IV of Foreign Office Secret Circular Ho.7. 9555/3822/G, dated the 6th September 1937) then I suppose the ident and his staff would not be difficult. evacuation of the Res 9. If, however, situation (2) had come about it would be a different matter. In either case the following comments occur to me. (a) The British interests at Bushire are given in para graph 8 (l) of the enclosure to my letter of 18th January. (b) Transport for evacuation# Either a sloop from the Persian Gulf Division or one of the British India steamers which ply in the Gulf. It is doubtful if a sloop would be available (see paragraph 2 (2) of enclosures to my letter of 18th January}. In this case the Resident should have authority to authorise a British India steamer to make a special call at Bushire. (c) Government property in Bushire consists of the Residency itself, the houses of the Secretary and the Assistant Engineer as well as the Residency offices in the town, and a water condensing and electricity plant. This property in the event of situation (l) would be handed over to the local Persian authorities. In the case of situation (2) there would presumably be /-5 be no authority to whom this property could be handed over, and it would have to be abandoned. (d) The commercial British interests here are vable a Wireless Limited, the Imperial Bank of Iran and Messrs.Gray Mackenzie &amp; the British India Steam Navigation Company Agents. In situation (l)» be-ore war was actually declared, I would doubtless receive instructions from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to issue these interests with the appropriate warn ing. in situation (2) I would doubtless also receive instructions frcm His Majesty’s Minister as to what advice I should give them or what action I should taice, e.g. arranging their evacuation. In writing this letter I have not forgotten tnat it is His Majesty’s Minister who is the final British authority in this country, and my suggestions are subject of course to any views which Seymour may wish to express. The evacuation of Bushire for instance would naturally only be made by the Resident on definite instructions to that effect from His Majesty’s Minister. 11. I have, as you will have seen, dealt not only with my own removal in the case of war with Persia neutral (which was the problem envisaged in your letter), but also with the complete evacuation of Bushire under situations (l) and (2) envisaged in paragraph 7 above. I daresay that it is unlikely that either situation will arise but we had a lesson last September that while we may hope for the best it is absolutely 10 * essential /essential to prepare in advance plans for the worst 12. The consulates of Kerman, Bandar Afcfcas and Khorra^ishahr* though under me for accounts and establishment, are of course for all other purposes directly under His Majesty’s Minister. I have not therefore dealt in any way with plans for possible evacuation for these posts, ♦ 13. I am sending copies of this letter to Seymour, Metcalfet Tyssen and Poland* Much of the detail I have gone into may not concern the two latter officers, but doubtless both are interested in the plans as t o my headquarters dealt with in the first half of my letter, and Poland, as Senior Haval Officer, is interested in the possibility of supplying a sloop for the evacuation (vide paragraph 9 (b) above). ♦ sent under Printed Letter N0.567-S of the 7th November, 1938.INDIA OFPICB, P.2.7074/1938.

P. Z.5^^-/3o of the 2yth July, I send you herewith a copy of a letter from Seymour to Baggallay about the possibility that Persian Gulf questions may be raised before long by the Persian Government. 2. As you will see, Seymour thinks that with Soheily out of the picture and the Shatt-el-Arab negotiations pending, the subject of treaty negotiations with us is likely to be dropped for a time. In the event of the Persians raising it, however, we agree with the line which Seymour suggests he should adopt, and subject to your concurrence, we propose to approve the reply suggested in paragraph 3 of his letter. 3» As regards the Residency, you will see that in present circumstances Seymour sees no alternative to adopting your proposal that if the Persian Government raise the question, he should merely say that he will at once refer the matter home. 4* As regards the removal of the Residency in the event of a war in which we are engaged and Persia is neutral, this point was mentioned at the recent lliddle East (Official) meeting to consider ways of influencing Minor Powers and Arab States, but was not discussed. It seems to us inevitable, however, that the Resident would have to move at once and I suggest that plans for his removal and establishment elsewhere should be kept ready. Yours sincerely, (Sd. ) G. V. Baxter^ R. T. Peel, Esq* , M. 0.(B 5838/461/34) No. 539/3/38. BRITISH TBH 8 th September, 1938. My dear Lacy, Your letter of the 17th August, (S 4552/461/34), deals with two allied questions, the possibility of the Persians proposing negotiations on Gulf questions, and the Residency. 2. As regards the treaty question. It is fairly clear that Soheily was the man who was personally anxious to try to get some new treaty with us. Before he went to London he spoke to me about it and said that Samiy meant to raise the matter - which he never did. During my interviews since my return with the Uinister for Foreign Affairs and Under-Secretary of State, neither of them has given any hint of a wish for treaty negotiations. It seems quite on the cards therefore that, with the disappearance of Soheily, the subject will be dropped for a time. The Shatt negotiations will presumably be taken up in Bagdad quite shortly, and I should think it unlikely that the Ministry would want to tackle the two questions at once. 3. If, in spite of all this, the Ministry do say anything to me about negotiations, I think the best course would be for me to speak on the following general lines:- His Majesty’s Government are always anxious to improve their relations with friendly countries, but they are not convinced that this object is served by concluding agree ments which ignore existing difficulties. In the present case/ Baggallay, Esq., The Foreign Office, London, S.V.l#A, m case they would not consider a general agreement worth / V while unless the Iranians were disposed to include in it a recognition of the relatione of His Majesty* s Government with the Arah rulers and a renunciation of their claims to Bahrein and the islands in the Gulf* If the Iranian Government are not so disposed - and His Majesty’s Govern ment are not prepared to offer a quid pro quo for the surrender of claims which they believe to be unfounded - it would be better not to engage in negotiations which would be bound to break down on this point # and to continue the system, which has worked well for some years, of removing possible causes of dispute and friction as they arise. Do you think this is a suitable line? 4* As regards the Residency, it is always very difficult to forecast Persian action, but on the whole I remain of the opinion that the Persians, unless some incident occurs or some new personality is Injected into the scene on the Persian side, will probably not bring up the question during Powle’s tenure of office. The request for an agr&amp;nent for a successor would give a natural opportunity for them to object to the indefinite continuance of the post on Persian soil, and I should expect them to take this opportunity* If they do, I don’t see what I can say except that I will at once refer the matter to London* This is perhaps not a very brilliant repartee, but I have no other. ^ 5. There is one further point: I think it most « unlikely that the Persians would allow the Resident, in case of a war in which the Arab Coast was in any way affected and/and Persia was neutral* to carry on from Persian soil functions which they would profcahly consider incompatible with their neutrality. (I am assuming that* whatever the theory* there will in practice be neutrals in a future war)* In fact I think that in such a case the Resident should at once remove his headquarters to some place where he can be sure of functioning without interference. x# Yours ever* (Signed) H.
