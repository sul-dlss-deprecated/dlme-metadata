Jan. 15. | What everybody expected has come to pass, tho Gaekwar-has been arrested, and is at this moment a prisoner under a strong European guard in the Barodn cantonments. The whole business has been most excellently managed by Sir Lewis Pelly and the Fiist'Assistant Re sident, Mr. J. B. Richey. Mr, Sou ter, the Bom bay Commissioner of Police, arrived in Calcutta on Monday night and was received late that evening or early next morning'by the Viceroy, who after a perusal of his report and the legal piginions upon it determinedjto act without delay. As a preliminary the troops were'telegraphed to at Bombay and ordered to start without delay rforBaroda.

He did not even goibr his usual evening- -drive—q cjr^umstancp which is significant enough when contrasted with sub- sequont oronts. Yet.ho had- not rocoived tho nmrlta.t Iutinmtlon-thltt^h'0 ll illl 1ft ^bb*'(lepriYCd of his liberty on tho tollowmg day. • doming evquts jiro said to^qasfcjfthcir shadows boforo ft was so in tho Gaokrwnr'a .caso.

Sir Lewis was attended by almost all the officers in: Camp, including 1 Colonels Jacob and Herbert - and the Assistant Residents. The Gaekwar was accompanied by Bapoobai and Govindroo Mama, two of his Kharbaries. -When all were seated the Governor General’s.Agcnt, after a short con- veraatioh with the Gaekwaf; read bat the Vice roy’s proclamation ''in' 1 'English, and it was translated .sentence! by sentence into Maratlii Jhe Gaekydr listened attentively while the proclamation! was being read. He did not. ap pear to be surprised. Sir Lewis had, I fancy prepared himibr it Mythe short introductory aWe'rgafcjjJn .witich preceded the reading of the document.' At ;the conclusion of the reading Sir' Lewis repeated' -the substance to:him. and told n 'htrn that it was necessary that he [should - give himself up to be placed Iindcc restraint until the' investigation which is to be held, according to the terms of the prbil clamation has decided his gnilt or inno cence. IiuI®Ely to Sir Lewis’s demand tol surrender Mulnarao expressed his willingness to obey the order of the Sircar. He spoke for -a short time to Colonel Pelly in the vernacular. The substance of what he said was that he was innocent, that Sir Lewis was his best menu, as the.very ground that he walked upon cried put against him. A few minutes; afterwards the party rose and proceeded tif thc carriages in waiting. Mnlharao, 'accompanied by the twp Khprbaries above-named, got into ' is own carriage. ■ Next came Dr. Seward, the] Residency Surgeon and Csntoment Magistrate, and then,Sir Lewis Pelly in Political uniform, wearing life Star'pf India, with the two-'senior military officers. The party .prooeeded at a rapid Space along the-xoad leading from the canton ments to the city, hntil a small bvidjgb'which is anderstood tq mark the : cantonment limits was eoclied. Here the party drew up, tliet carriages were turned round, and the Gaekwar'desconding from his own got into the one occupied by Dr. Seward, who U a 'personal friend^ of; His High- ness. BT^wo JvnArbivnes'lfeo8spanIed turn. iTIiey sat bn the front seat facing the Gaekwar [and Dr. Seward. Colonel Polly’s carriage came jn'cxt, and one or two others. The whole were surrounded by an escort of troopers from the IResident’s bodyguard. Two or three minutes' drive in the direction of cantonments brought | [the party to Dr. Seward’s bungalow, where it had I been arranged that for the present Malhareo I should be, confined. Tho carriages tnrned into | jthe compound, and at the entrance to tho bun- alow the crest-fallen Gaekwar was received by » guard of fifty European troops, under com mand of a Captain. After remaining kero for a short time Sir Lewis left the Gaokwar, having assured him that his wants would be' carefully | attended to and that he should not suffer the slightest personal inconvenience bejond that of confinement. Dr. Seward remained with the prisoner, who is as mooli at tached to the Doctor as one of his peculiar nature can be. The Doctor is to live in the same bungalow. ■As soon . as .-it was known that the arrest nod been determined on*, a large body .of) sepoys were moved from the camp to within '□short distance of; the bridge Where the scenel was to be played out. Here also the Gaokwar had. left some of his escort when on his way to the. Residency. They did not at all understand tho- turn matters had taken,.and were plainly cry much astonished when the Gapkwor, fol lowed by his two Kharbaries; alighted from his own earriage and .went into Dr, Seward’s, jiml that. instead of' driving towards the ci ty the cantonment road was taken. They attempted to take up their position as usual in the rear of their master's carriage, bnt the blue sowars of the -Residency quietly out them out, and they had to be . content with riding at the sides and in the rear. Soma of them at oncp turned back, and after consulting together for a short time rode off to the city, doubtless to Iproad the tidings of their master being a pri soner in tho British, camp. A few of them rode as far as tho bungalow gates, a»d fewer still went [nside. The whole thing could qot possibly DESIGNATION Odfc/ MR. GLADSTONE. . .

After breakfast Birl ! Lewis directed the priacijnj Sirdars, amongst whom was a good sprinkling of Nawabs, to assemble in the Residency Dhrbnr-room. Mr. Richey had first of all to go out amongst them and settle questions of precedence. When that somewhat difficult task had been accomplished they filed in : a most motley | looki ig crew ; many of than are very intelli gent looking men, especially the Mahomcdans, of whom there were eight &gt;r nine.

This, morrijhg he was most plainly dressed.

A list of the hdinber allowed was made ont and given to him. Scverol “ tajilc com panions” have been allqjvccy him, and a modest household establishment of somc,twcnty ; or thirty [servants.

Colonel Felly we to work so coolly and cautiously that there was no cl)ance of a failure. On coining oat of the Residency the Gaokwar seemed. rather nervous, and all the way along the road he talked ear nestly to his companions the ICliarburics, gestir dilating vehemently—perhaps explaining to ibham what they were to do about the affairs of the city and his own personal matters. Nothing I was wanting to render Mnlharao’a reception as courteous as it always has been. The troops I who afterwards marohed up near the bridge on | which the arrest was made bad just before (done duty as a gnard of honour for his reception [at the Residency. After the arrest had been completed they were marched into the city and posted! in J [different-streets to prevent any breach of the! jpeace, Sir Lewis also had tho GaokwarV Oommandev-in-Glricf, General Devine, up to tjlio] [Residoiiey and told him to take precautions! to] prevent the budmashes-, of th°, city/ gratifying [their thirst for . loot. In fact Sir Lewis tola mim that he would bold him responsible for 1111/'disturbance's' that might occur. Tho city people, however j, seem to have taken the matter very quietly, and os they see that they are not likely to gain much by rising they will probably keep quiet. I hear that some of the State jewels and money have been made away with, bat as soon as tho arrest had been made Sir- Lewis sent an officer’s gnard to the palace with orders to seal op the State Treasury and to admit no one within the precincts of the palace. In accordance with their ex prose desire five of the Sirdars have been allowed to go there for the purpose of mounting guan' over the Qaddct. This is a curious custom of] the State, and at first Sir Lewis could not comprehend why the Sirdars were so anxious to guard the GodoM, bnt he subsequently grant ed their request, and St this moment five of them are faithfully watching over tho throne vacated by Mulharao Gaekwar, ft has always go the Sirdars say, boon the custom to place some of them on guard over the Qddao when the Gaekwar went away from the city for a few day The fallen 'Prince has accepted 1 hie fate with a quiet dignity, which—however bod the they are for the most part indifferently armed Sonio' hayb-' antiquated matchlocks, ji\ ' many ascs without the match, spears, bludgeons, bows and arrows, &amp;c. Sothe^oPtlre'superior class' have 1 few Brown Besses amongst tlicin, but not much ammunition. Altogether they-are a -very • raga muffin lot. The only weapons tvhicli s'ccm plentiful ’ ere are swords. Everybody one 1 meets ' isiprd- lided with one or more of these useful - weapop.*. Some carry them as civilized jjeople dangle their walking-sticks, others shoulder them, : but the lajority tuck rthcpi under 'their arms with -a.&gt; bundle ’or dirty ciotfi, which' ‘when wrapped round them as a. cuuunerband constitutes;/full- dress. These weapons ore of all sorts, sizes, and shapes^ fronf tITb velvet sheathed sword of'the Sirdar to tho leather-cased seody-lookuig, wea pons of the poorqr.classcs. I saw several Httlo boys staggering. along under, tlie, ( weight, .pf huge straight sWoras and-the-aforesivid- bundle of cloth, trying to pat on a swash-bucklor look. ~ am certain they would aiotliavfe been'able to lift their swords had' they found it neecssnry/to pink an adversary. Of the Gaekwar’s. cavalry. .1 did not sec much, bat it is I believe (he 1 best of troops. Some of the men had very fine Kattywar horses, which were very inucli afraid of the European-rtroop».—£—bcljerc ’fKo'wfrt step that will be taken will bo to disarm his troops—that will not bo a very .difficult task, and Colonel Herbert’s Fusiliers will probably | have to do'it. I As will be seen the proclamation gives SirLowis [elly the most absolute control over the State— i fact he is Virtually Gaekwnr pro lent. Matters ill continue to go oil just as they did in the Gaek- war’s time, except of course that from the date of Sir Lewis Polly’s administration all oppres-1 sion ceases, and many improvements too will havo been effected before; he hands over the reins of government either to Mnllumio again or' the native administration which is guaranteed under | the proclamation. Immediately ,after: .arresting the , Gnckwar Sir Lewis communicated the intelligence to the Viceroy at Calcutta, and by the time this letter is published it-will be known all over the world. It is without doubt the most important political coup iVctat that the Government have effected for a very long time. It owes its success to the really masterly manner in which-it was carried' out. 'Sir Lewis Felly’s personal influence oyer the Gaekwar has a large share in the success. Certainly the Gnokwar,‘ as -soon —as he saw the game was :up, became very docile: had he chosen Vto do so he might have given us.aj deal of trouble. /Happily matters have assumed a satisfactory aspect, and Mulharao Gack- war is safely lodged in a place from Whence he will only be led forth to take his .trial, on thq fiharge of attempting to poison Colonel PHayrc. It yet rentali)e Jo be seen how tho Mahrattns qf tho Presidency will view the matter, but the 'Gaekwar had so few friends and snob a number of enemies, that no one is likely to regret very] much, that • he has been temporarily deposed. The -Sirdars in. fact are rather pleased then qlhewiso. ;A'Eurbpetmgnard is on duty at the Residency, and every, precaution has boon taken to render any attempt at resening the de posed Prince useless. His trial will probably commence abont- this day week, if by that time the Commission has been able to as semble nnd the Gaekwar is ready with his defonpe.. .. Amongst (he hangers-on at the Court aro numbers of Aighaijs, Pathans and Mnbomodan. b urfraai/jAs—,i,lajpaS c 4 charac ters” n.s they aro styled in police reports. Those gen tic men will, I believe, bo to|d to make thorn solves moareo ss soon os convenient. They ere always ready tor a row and might soon if they were loft to themselves do &amp; grant deal of tho superiority of their, respective masters. The leading Sirdars were decked out—some in blue, some in green silk jackets and short red silk’ incxprcssiblesT^fcw; of them wore jewels of much value. They were accommodated with e naira, 1 and when all wen seated in tho Durbar room, 1 Sir Lewis Pelly, Mr.. Richey end the two senior military officers entered the room. Birl safe. I shall suggest also that the jewels be deposited in a safe place till this crisis is over. The Sirdars again pressed their-request about the protection of the Gadee, and Sir Lewis con sented to allow five of them to go to the palace th a pass from him for the purpose of pro* 1 tooting the Gadee from insult. Sir Lewis—I shall expect fall assistance and j support from all of yon in the collection of the ' State revenue. I hope all the Sirdars and Bankers will freely and frankly give all the information they can of cases of exaction or purloining State reveane. It concerns them end the honour of the State. I shall always be happy to see the chief Sirdars at any time, I shall also be glad when we meet to morrow if they will suggest something in regard to the Durbar easterns of the State. I wish to hare Durbars where we can meet, so that there may be no change in any of the cos • toms of the State until I hand it over again to a native administration. I request all of yon to write to your friends and acquaintances in tho mofussil of the Baroda State informing them of what has been done, reassuring them that there is no intention of annexation, and calling upon them to forward their rerenne as usual and to use their influence in preserving the peace. I' shall be glad if yon will 'all go home now and intimate what has passed. In regard to the Gaekwar, 'under instructions from the Viceroy I have been obliged to detain him, bat it is my intention to treat him with the greatest consideration and . to make him as comfortable as possible. In foot no insult to H. U. will be tolerated. His Highness will have a personal establishment round him a(the bun galow. where he is at present. My own Doctor, who is a personal mend of the Gaekwar, will reside with him ; at the same time it is necessary for Hin Purls ofjnstica that proonutions shonltl ba taken as to who visits Hi* Highness. A.ny counsel or professional man going to assist him m his defence will have free access to him, but in regard to others it will be necessary for any oho to obtain a pass from the Resident. This concluded the Durbar, and it was agreed! that tho Sirdars should meet Sir Lcwig^B at 11 n.m. on Saturday. Sir Lewis then went] outside with the Assistant Resident and surf rounded by the minor Sirdars read andH Iplaincd the 7 proclamation to them.

It is 'imM possible to pounce upon every single man who may have been tyrannizing or exacting, but if I can possibly ascertain few instances of men who hare been doing so, I will give them the utmost punishment pos-ible, I have reason to suppose that some of the State property has jbepn .malversatcd or purloined, and that State money and jewellery is cvra being taken a way at the present time. I look to the Sirdars to| give me every assistance, aid information to the police to put a stop to these practices. It concerns them especially fiat tho State propee- ty should not be made any with to Bombay and Surat.” ' Sir Lewis here Asked tkm if they had any questions to ask, and the Sirdars replied that they understo od everything a nd we re per- fectly satisfied. Addressing one of the Sirdars named Radclia, Sir Lewis said—“ I understood the family of which you are tho representative) have been faithful supporters of the Gackwaroe raj, I consider it of grot utility, and that it 'concerns the dignity of i native State, to bo I supported by men of family round the miisnud.l It‘is my 1 intention to take an early op-| porlunity of restoring yon to your rights and of doing as. much for you ts I can consistently With the present condition of the finances of) the state. Several oftholoadingSiidars hero said through tho interpreter “ the words used by your Honour are very good, and we are satisfied with them. Oar prayer has reference to tho protection of the State, and We arc confident Government will deal out justice to Mnlhaiao.” Sir Lewis Pelly—What am I to anderstand by your reference to Mnlharao ? Do you mean to say you consider His Highness gnilty of crimes or mismanagement? The Sirdars—We cannot say : it is for Go vernment to decide. After a little desultory conversation the Sjrdqrs asked Sir Lewis to allow them to pro tect (ho Gadee: they said it was the eastern as- r —p 0 \iy—Th*i government of the mischief; The military force which is hero all State is now vested in tW Government of India, present, : and which will not be increased in who ha ve delegated it toy, and I intend to exor* strength, will not be removed for three or four ■■ weeks; until it is quite certain that there is no chance of their services being required either at Baroda city or in the inofussil. Detach ments of nativa troops will continno to patrol the streets of the native town, until the afore mentioned budmashes havo been sent about their business. immediately- it- was known in the city) that Mulharao was a [prisoner, several- heavy' bags containing State property were sent off to tho railway station «« rou(e to Bom bay. They wore, however, brought to Sir Lewis Pelly, i who has kindly undertakon to taka care of them ibr.thc present. There is no doubt that the .whole of the palace would have been looted had hot the Resident taken the pro can tioiv to send troops there and so forestall ‘I-.—» who had made up their minds to help themselves out of the Gaekwar’s ill-gotten hoards. 1 11,1 For the present Colonel Pelly will con duct the business of the State nt the Resi dency, but he willmost likely visit tho city to morrow—at all events he will do so tho next day, as ho has arranged with the Sirdars to in spect and place tho State jewels in safe custo dy. The native town here .by , all aooonnls is very interesting. I 'wished to inspect it this afternoon, bat as there was just a chance of not coming back again safely, and as tho killing or wounding, of a “ Special” would consider ably complicate matters, I acted on the Resident’s afirioo and did not-go.- In a day or two I may do so just to give you an idea of what Barodn is like—^fov there is but little to write about now that the Gaekwar is a prisoner and nobody allowed ciso all the power and authority formerly used by the Gaekwar, and l®°k to all Sirdars and bankers to give me full support and aid, so that revenue, judicial, and other matters may go on properiy. It is not the intention of the Go vernment of Lidia or Her Majesty’s Govern ment to annex the territory. The intention is to have a fail and public enquiry into the al leged attempt of the Gaekwar to poison the representative of the Paramount Power, and that will be most carefully done by high officers of Government. I shall have nothing to do with the enquiry. The Court will assomblel hero and report to B. E, &gt;u Council such mat-, tor as they choose, and on receipt of their re port H. E. the Viceroy in Connell will restore this State to a native administration in such a manner as may be determined on after the conclusion of the enquiry and after consi deration of the results. The Sirdars—All our prayer is that our native State may be preserved. Sir Lewis Pelly—There is no intention of annexing it. , The Sirdars again renewed their rapresonta- tions about tho care of tee Gadee. Sir Lewis—I have made arrangements to take care of the Gadee. If mey take care of it, they will have to take care of me, ns I am tho Gadee at present. I should like to meet the head Sir dars to-morrow and rcccivctheir advice as to the way in which they would p r0 p 0SC to p ro t cc t, the palace and what arrangeiu en t s t] lC y j invo (o sug- 1 gest. In the meantime J have sent down an officer with a large pariy to p n t seals on the 1 State Treasury,so that iiothing can bo abstracted. I shall hold the Jemadar Khana responsible for THE OCCUPATION OF THE CITY. DISARMING THE GAEKWAR’S TROOPS. Immediately after the Gaekwar’s arrest a large dctachmeut of the 9th N. I. Regiment was ordered to proceed to the palace. It consisted of three companies, six native officers, Captain Coles, was ander the command of Colonel Anson, accompanied by Captain Jackson, Assistant Political Agent, and followed by tho. principal officers of the Gaekwaree’s household. The 2nd N. I. with a detachment of Cavalry moved up in support, but did not enter the city. The 9tn marched through the bazaars surrounding the city, which they entered by the Larccpola Gate. Some of the people opened the gate from within at the command of the sepoy officers. The troops then marched through the principal streets to the Engadee gate. This is a large quadrangular shaped structure surrounded by a pagoda dock tower. From here the troops marched direct to the palace. Arrived there the commanding officer, Colonel Anson, placed guards over each of the palace gates and the approaches to it from _the city. While tho commanding officer, accompanied by Captain Jackson, was engaged iii placing a guard in one of the interior chambers, an Arab match lock man was observed standing on one of the staircase landings, matchlock in hand, aiming at Captain Jackson. The sepoys at once rnshed up and seized him, and after some trouble he was disarmed. The man was found to be under the inllucnco of bhang at the time, and his struggles to break away from hU captors were inosb vlolout. Several other Arabs who were discovered _ -wiifltfty ttiB itutwuig——- - - HI ■ I-Tlfy sabmictod process quietly enough. The British troops were joined at the palace by Captain Lynn of the 5th corpe Gaekwar’s troops. The latter was accompani ed by a number of his ' men. He offered his services to Colonel Anson, who accepted them, and the sepoys under th’eir officers! followed by Captain Lynn’s men, proceeded to make a detour round tho town. Guards were posted at the different city gates, after which Captain Lynn’s regiment was maroh ed onteide the Clioropanee Gate, where the men piled arms under the walls of the oity. They wore then dismissed and a guard of sepoys from the 9th Regiment placed over their arms. Re entering the city the troops marched past the beautiful, bat unfinished marble palace which Mulharao was building for Laxmoebaec. A short distance beyond this tho Gaekwar’s Ar tillery depot was entered.

The Ceylon, Observer suggests the cultivation of [oysters as a'profitable investment nM* any enterprising speculator in that island. Good oysters, which might I easily be improved with proper treatment, are already found at Bentola, and forwarded to Colombo; and our contemporary sees no reason why a large business lahould not be done in oysters. There arc many places on the coast of Orison nnd Chittagong where the col- tore of oysters might also be profitably undertaken. The Chittagong boatmen even now occasionally bring cargoes of the targe rook oysters to Calcutta, from which, according to the EmjlUhinan, they realise a handsome profit at the rate of two rupees per hundred. i-y-Ii-J quartw. yi csnBBjLaUx,at_M^ -sJ' this- g-&gt;o -Amour Juts directed Lite i® : join him, and to trunc them id i» The correspondent of the Pioneer states that the Ameer of Cabul is ia constant receipt of letters from jthe principal officers of the expedition sent against Herat, and has replied repeating his former instruo- tioup, and also directing that on the troops approach ing Herat, proclamations should be issued offering pardon to ail who may now join the Ameer, but threatening recusants with severe punishment ns soon ns the place shell have been taken.

The commanders appear to think the force much too large for the mere reduction of Herat, but there appears lo be a suspicion [at Cabul that the Ameer has purposely detailed a strong foroe in order to provide against aoy interfe rence on the part of 1’eraia.

In reply to his enquiry as to their title—they replied “ we are the silver gnu men.” From the Artillery Depot the troops marched to the palace of the first Gaokwar. This ia in many respects a ourions structure. It has subterranean passages which lead under neath the city walls to the bazaars outside : each of these passages was found to be strongly guard ed by Arab mercenaries- When asked if they were willing to assist in keeping guard they agreed, aod so were not disarmed. They were addressed by Captain Lynn and at once accept ed tho sitnatiou without a murmur. From here the sepoys, now considerably reduced in num bers on account of the numerous small parties which had to be (old off for guard duty at different points, marched to the barracks, outside of which ho found the Gackwar’s High lander’s drawn up in a large square, their band with them, but none of tneir commanding officers, who were nil out in cantonments.

The latter told Colonel Anson that he was without orders and willing to submit with his troops and proceed to any appointed place. Colonel Anson in reply said all he wanted the men to do was to give up their arms and proceed ontaide the city walls. The regiment was then marched to the quadrangular gate where the main guard of the 9th N. I. was stationed ander the command of Captain Coles. Here they piled arms and marohed to the exterior of the city. To Captain Jackson had been entrusted the duty of taking possession of tho city banks. These are fire in number, and situated in the main street of the oity. The bullion, and coin which the banks contained were removed and conveyed to tho State Treasury, which was then sealed up and a strong guard placed there.

The Rev. Uraz Fernanda* waa called to the chair, and, in opening the proceeding*, said—I have been requested by scvcr.il_fa- lendare, and particularly by Mr. Anlooio Luis, one of the principal proprietors, to convene a meeting of the Innd- boldert of cocoannt plantation at .Mahim, which wae ad journed on the 6th December 1874. The object of that iinccting &lt;raa to take into consideration the sabjeet of the additional tax to be levied by Government on cocoanut land brab trees, and while the discussion was going on up wards of 200 Bhundaries made their appearance without being invited. On Mr. Uovind Babul, one of th* proprie tor*. asking them whether they were prepared to pay the additional lax demanded by Government on coeeanut trees, Ac* they replied they were not; that the present payment of taxes had already redneed them to a stale of alter starvation, end that they were unable to carry on their pro fession with farther taxations. However, after a few days, they, the Bbandaries, held their own meetings, end resolved open giving up their business, and consequently the juice _□ in cocoanut nnd brab trees were remevid without I being in any tray compelled or inatigated by th* proprie- tors. Scarcely four days bad elapsed when thee* very Bbnn- defies commenced, resuming their profession, and stated, on nty enquiring of the reason, that they were requested by [their shettias or shopkeepers to do so, who gua-aoteed to K hjt the additional tax for them, being afraid of losing their juor shops, which bring them targe profit*. They further stated that the shopkeepers pay them #7 for a pdt of 'double distilled liquor and sell it for #12(, for single distilled they receive #3}, nnd Is sold by retail for #64. The shopkeepers, who bold licences arc, therefore, much profited. Under these circumstances, it appears to me it would be more equitable that Government should tax [the additional impost on the licence-holders than the poor Uhundaries. Besides t he Abkorcc taxes, the proprietor* have to pay enonnons taxes lo the Municipality on their cocuanut plantations, ns also the police nnd lighting rate* withont deriving any privilege, the only benefit we are likely to derive is the supply of Vchar water, which ia at tributable to the exertions of Dr. BUney.

A Hindoo merchant named Jndbowjcc Paermj yesterday appeared at the Fort Police Court, before Mr. C. P. Cooper, Senior Magistrate, with hie solicitor, Mr. Horc, and Lid an information against one Veerjco Jnirnin, whom ho charg ed with cheating by false personation, ander the folio ring circumstances:—The informant arid : I am a merchant and general commission agent in Bombay, and have my E lace of business at Mandveo Dander. 1 know FoUois llontciro, of Assonn,. in Snlsettc, near Goa, who is a Portu guese merchant, and my agent there. On th* 18th December last, the said Felicia consigned to me from As tons in a pattimar, Mote Aapharaa. tindnl Jack! Antnuo Kooias, 44,405 cocoanuts for sale in Bombay on his account. The pnttimnr arrived in Bomb*y on or about tho Nth instant, and the Undal brought with him for me the letter of consignment addressed to me, and enquired for my place of business, and, ns I am informed, as he was making enquiries for my place of beeioton, he • was met by Voeriee Jniram, a patty merchant, whose shop is at Sat Tail, and he, as 1 am informed and believe, took tho said letter from the tindel, nnd informed him that he won the persbn to whom the letter waa addressed, nnd then caused th* pittimar to be entered ia the Custom House at Dwnbny in the name of Jniram Pragjtc, his firm As I mil informed and believe the pattim.-ir had not any manifest with her, as she was coming from the port of Goa; nor, as I am informed and believn, waa there any bill of lading for tho said goods Th* said Vcorjcc Jniram then sold the goods to a third party, and ordered the tindnl to give delivery ot the same to the purchaser thereof. On the 12th instant I received a letter from my agent, advising me that the pnttimnr had sailed, and would probably by that time have reached Bombay, aod directing me to dispoee of the goods at the best ruling rate* in Bombay, whereupon I went to th* Borcc Bender to enquire about the pattimar, aod then learnt Iho tacts above stated. Tho said goods have been transhipped by order of Vccijco Jairam into another begalow, or native vessel, now lying in Bombay harbour, with a view of removing the same from Bombay. Under these circumstances I charge Veerie* Jairam with cheating by false personation, under section* 415,419 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code, and pray that a warrant may be issued for hi* apprehension, end that a warrant may also be issued for the seizure of th* said goods, and I pray that he may be dealt with according to law.
