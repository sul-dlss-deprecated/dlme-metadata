FOR USE BY DEPARTMENT ONLY. fhaft express letter to the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf, ffS JUL 164 SPlease see notes flagged X on file below. The R.A.F. have constructed certain buildings on land allowed to them,rent free for the duration of the war, by the Sheikh of Sharjah. In February last the Political Agent, Bahrein, reported that the Sheikh was under the in^pression that these buildings would revert to him on being vacated by the R.A.F. Transport Comraand or their tenants the U.S. Ariny Transport Corps. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in his memorandum at EXT.119VV&gt; requested confirmation that they would, in fact, become the property of the Sheikh. The Air Ministry .on being consulted, have replied that they assume that the agreement with the Sheikh of Sharjah is valid until the end of the war with Japan, and that, while it is inevitable that the actual buildings will become the property of the Sheikh on being declared surplus to the needs of the R.A.F., the R.A.F. will wish to continue to use the station and landing grounds. They suggest that, should the Sheikh raise the question, he might be informed that the R.A.F. would like to discuss with him conditions under which they could be allowed continued use,on a reduced scale, of the areas at Sharjah which they now occupy. A draft express letter to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf forwarding a copy of the Air Ministry letter and conveying agreement with the reply to the Sheikh proposed in the third paragraph of that letter is submitted.quoted Ao y 731 31 ^5 / 3# and the following number Telephone: Extn Any communications on the subject of this letter should be addressed to :— Your Ref. : Abbey 3411 I aft command 1 to refer to India Office lette r Ext.1194/45 of the 26th I r arch.1 %-5 . enclosing a copy Of a memorandum iTom tiie Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf about the ultimate disposal of‘buildings constr-'cted at Sharjah by the Royal Air Force for tne use of the Royal Air ^orce Transport Command and the United States Army Transport Corns. 2. The Council assume that the agreement made with the Shaikh of Sharjah in 19V+ for the utilisation by the Royal Air Force of certain areas free of rent for the duration of the war is valid until the end of the war with Japan. In regard to the buildings erected on them, it is no doubt inevitable that, so far as immovables are concerned, they willjwhen declared surplus to Ro' r al Air Force needs, become the property of the Shaikh, but it has to be borne in mind that even after the Japanese war the Royal Air Force will wish to continue using the station, probably as a refuelling stop for single and twin-engine aircraft, and as an alternative airfield to Bahrein. General reconnaissance aircraft may also wish to make emergency landings there. 3.

In his letter below to Mr. Kitts (F.5«) Sir James Ross suggests that the Sheikh might be told that,while any buildings jut up by the R.A.F. would revert to him on being vacated, it is unlikely that they -will be given up*, and that sane time negotiations should be opened for an agreement giving the R.A.F. extended or indefinite tenure of the station. No action seems to be required here until we get the considered views of the Air Ministry as a whole.PILE COPY r ~~ ~ , ~ vV&lt;\* 1 1 57 VLn_ .

Disposal of buildings constructed at Sharjah by the R.A.F. for the R.A.F.Transport Command and the U.S. Amy Transport Corps. (Ext .4211.8/44) (Colin.5/81 ) -a (PZ.1687/37) (Colin.5/28) (PZ.641/35) (Colin.5/34). Last year the Sheikh of Sharjah agreed to the occupation of additional land by the R.A.F. for the duration of the war, (a cop/}/ of his letter is flagged 'X” below). The^^A.F. constructed buildings for the use of Air Transport Command And the U.S. Amy Transport Corps. We do not appear to have any exact information here as to what these buildings comprise. They are usually referred to as housing (accommodation for 10 officers and 200 men) a wireless transmitting station and 'meteorological observations and operations'. The Political Agent, Bahrein has reported that the Sheikh expects that when these buildings are vacated, they will revert to him. • The assurances given to the Sheikh in 1937 (referred to in paragraph 3 )&gt; referred to additional wireless facilities for the R.A.F. which were constructed at Sharjah that year and consisted of 4 mosques and a small concrete junction box. The Political Resident considers that the present structures fall into the same category as these erections and #as the addition which was made in 1935 to the B.O.A.C. Rest House, to house the Indian Meteorological Staff, who moved from Muscat to/■ Sharjah that year. (Under the Sharjah Civil Air Agreement the Rest House is the property of the Sheikh). The Political Resident now asks whether, should the Sheikh raise the point, he may be assured that the buildings will become his property when no longer required for the use of the R.A.P. A draft letter to Sir James Ross at the Air Ministzy asking for their views, is below. CO ®dq~*- (PZ.46&amp;/32)OU'O'w ^ ( «?

The position was regularised by the Shaikh agreeing to the occupation of the areas by the Royal Air Force free of rent for the period of t he war, and signing a map on which the areas were outlined. A copy of the Shaikh*s letter dated 13th April 1944 is enclosed. % 2. In the agreement with the Shaikh referred to above no mention was made of the ultimate disposal of the buildings erected on the areas occupied. I enclose a copy of a letter No. C/242 dated 14th February 1945 from the Political Agent, Bahrain, and of its enclosures, reporting the Shaikh’s expectation that the buildings will revert to him on their being vacated. 3. The decision to give the Shaikh the assurance in Bahrain Agency letter No. C/141-7/2 dated 13th February 1937 'was reported to the India Office in Residency -ixprep^s Letter No. 192-3, dated 12th February 1937.The present additions fall in the same category as the meteorological building (vide India Office Express letter Jo.

All construction work for the RAF and Boac at Bahrein and Sharjah has practically ceased in order to concentrate on the work for ATC ARRANGEMENTS have been made to send by AIR DRAUGHTSMAN PLANT AND TIMBER THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED MONTHS AGO IF THEY HAD BEEN REQUESTED. MOTOR TRANSPORT IS ALSO BEING BORROWED FROM THE ARMY AT SHARJAH. Some civilian tradesmen are being borrowed from the Navy to EXPEDITE CONSTRUCTION. 4. From discussions and inspections of the work at both Bahrein and Sharjah it is clearly evident that the chief ENGINEER IRAQ UNDERTOOK THIS URGENT WORK FOR TAG WITHOUT ADEQUATE RESOURCES OR PROPER PROVISIONS OF LABOUR PLANT AND MATERIALS. FURTHERMORE WHEN THE ATC COMPLAINED OF POOR PROGRESS THE CHIEF ENGINEER GAVE HIS AOC AND. MY HEADQUARTERS WRITTEN AND VERBAL ASSURANCES IN FEBRUARY AND IN MARCH THAT THE WORK REQUIRED WOULD BE COMPLETED ACCORDING TO PROGRAMME. In SPITE OF DRASTIC MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN DURING I/my visits to Bahrein and Sharjah the work at both will be I SEVERAL WEEKS BEHIND ORIGINAL TARGET DATES.

J 944 Dear Peel, Dean has had your letter of 2nd March suggesting that the United States Air Force on the spot should be asked to notify any local requirements they might have to the R.A.F. Station Commander at Bahrain or Shargah. I an writing on his behalf after discussion with him. Your suggestion is entirely right in itself, but the difficulty is that if we make a. formal request of this kind from high quarters they will at once feel that we are making he; vy weather of it and entrenching ourselves very carefully. Can we secure the same end less obtrusively? The view taken here is that the Political Resident and the Station Comnanders should be instructed to put it informally to the Americans, at the first suitable opportunity, that it would be convenient to everyone if they would deal in the first instance with the Station Commanders on any point arising in their use of these air ^ stations. It is difficult at this distance to indicate precisely how this can most easily be put acros we don't even know the kind of “requests to the local authorities 11 that are being made^ ^^«a.on at a distance is always very difficult in any matter involving personal relationships and local details. »«e there!ore think it would be wiser, if you agree, to .. telegraph to our local authorities in the general sense of {this letter, leaving its application to them. *• i India Office /±t.»* 2 Is it quite clear tliat nothing directly political is involved? Even if anything with a definite political flavour arises, we think that it would still he best for the Americans to discuss the matter with the Commanding Officer, who might quite properly tell them he'will be glad to refer the matter to the Political Resident if they wish this done. He would in any case keep the Political Resident fully au fait with current events of importance, quite apart from any arrangements with the Americans to do so in any particular case* Sincerely yours ^.

Air facilities in Bahrain for United States A*T*C«(Received under Bahrain Printed Letter No.C/12 dated the 3rd January 1944). Air Vice M&amp;rahall R.P. Willock, C.B., aid Air Vice Marshall A.C. Collier, C.B., C.B.E., called to see me on the evening of Decernoer 29th. 2. Air Vice Marshal A.C. Collier was described as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Air Force Transport Command and he is at the moment on his w% to India in con nection with the vast increase in the flow of aircraft from the Middle East to India which it is anticipated will very shortly commence. Air Vice Marshall A.C. Collier thought th^t Bahrain would be a most important link in the chain and said that his survey party would be arriving in 4 or 5 days time. He anticipated that more building would have to take place and the re-fueling arrangements would have to be vastly improved. With regard to the American A.T.C. he said that the policy was for the Royal Air Force to retain control of the landing ground but the American aircraft would be under the control of their own operational staff until they came with in short range of the landing ground. He said that Air Chief Marshal a.*.T edder, G.C. B., considered that the fear that was present in certain peoples* minds that the Americans would lay claim to air ports after the war which they had been using during the war on the grounds that they had either made them or erected and maintained buildings in their proximity was ridiculous. The Air Chief Marshal considered that the closesl cooperation should be our object and that no thought of after the war competition should disturb our present relations with the United States Air Force. The Air Vice Marshal predicted that after the war by international agreement airfields will be made available in all countries with the possible exception of Russia for inter national use, that is to say, that every countiy would be en titled to use certain specified landing fields or airports in foreign countries but would only be permitted to take up passengers on condition that they were not set down in the same countiy • I asked the Air Vice Marshal what he considered Bahrain’s position would be after the war and lie said that the best possible solution as far as we and the Shaikh were concerned would be for the Maharraii aerodrome to be under the control of the Air Ministry who would be responsible for all persons of whatever nationality making use of the ground. He con sidered that Bahrain would be one of the most important post war alighting areas, 3« I told Air Vice Marshal Collier that I considered and I knew that the Hon*ble-the-Political Resident and -air Vice Marshal Willock were in agreement with me, that s.ny land required for American operations in Bahrain must be leased to the Royal Air Force and that it was desirable that ary build ings &amp;c., to be erected for American personnel should be built t by the Royal Air Force. I understock that the Royal Air Force couid undertake the construction work for the United States Air Force although the provision of the radio installa tions might be at the moment beyond their power. The Air Vice Marshal agreed and suggested that Air Vice Marshal Willock should te Is graph to Air Chief Marshal A.W. Tedder, and make it clear that, whatever his general policy might be, in Bahrain the building could be done by the Royal Air Force- 2 - rs and that it was desirable that it should be done by the Royal Air Force. 4. Air Vice Marshal Collier informed me that the peak of their re-inf or cement plan should see at least 2,000 air craft passing tnrough Bahrain every month, that this peak would be reached upon the collapse of Germany which he antici pated would take place next year, but that these figures should not be used by me in any official correspondence as the Air Ministry was still somevtiat hazy about their plans and he did not want to be quoted as having mis represented them. 5. The two Air Vice Marshals approached me with regard to the B.O.a.C. W/T set as already indicated to you in my telegram No. 893 dated the 30th December 1943. ltd. T.H.

The Adviter tc the Bahrain Government, Bahr ai n • Sir, I have the honour to enclo&amp;e a copy of a letter iftiich I have received from the Air Liaieon Officer, Bahrain, dated the 6th of January 1&amp;44. 2. 1 have alrea&lt;fy di acua&amp;ed the aabject matter of the encloaure to tliia letter with you and you will recollect that we have rou^ly aurveyed the aitea mentioned in paragraphs 3. You will note from paragraph 3 of the Air Liaison Officer*a letter under reference that the Royal Air Force deaire that negotiations for the leaae of certain areaa of land to thou ahcull be commenced aa early aa poaaible and that in addition they deaire to lay a pipe-line across tie Maharraq- - Karima cauee'csy • I shall be grateful if the Land Department of the Bahrain Government will survey the sites at the earliest possible moment with a view to discovering whether they are Bahrain Government property or in private ownership. Fcr this purpose I recommend the suggestion made in paragraph 5 of the Air Liaison Officer’s letter under reference be carried out. 4. The ownership of the sites will of course determine the procedure to be followed when considering the lease. I shall therefore be glad if, should they be found to be Bahrain Government property, the provisional approval of the Bahrain Government could be given to the lease on terms to be decided by negotiations between us on the basis suggested in paragraph 6 of the Air Liaison Officer’s letter. If any of the sites are privately owned do you consider that the Bahrain Government would be prepared to acquire them by purchase immediately or obtain an option to purchase so that there would be no difficulty in the lease negotiations if the Royal Air Force finally decide to proceed with the present plans. I understand that it has been (he custom in the past for the Bahrain Government to acquire private property for the purpose of leasing it to the Service Department s. 5. Since the Air Liaison Officer’s letter has been received I have had a conversation with Group Captain Alexander who tells rue that it has now been decided to take the pipe line right along the causew£y and along the Maharraq sea road instead of as described in paragraph 3 of the Air Liaison Officer’s letter. The pipe will be buried to a depth of twelve inches below the road surface and would I understand be most unlikely to cause any inconvenience to the users of the causeway •3• Plots Required • a. A piece of ground 500 ft x 500 ft adjacent to the garden directly south of ^alali and on the foreshore on the east side of Muh&amp;rravi Island and in a direct line mth the main HW-SB Runway on the airfield approx^ iroately 1-2/10 miles from the S*3* end of the Runway# This is to he used for the installation known as the '•Regional Oontrol** • b. A plot 500 ft x 500 ft on the S.S. corner of the Date Garden at Muharra^ owned by Shaikh Khalifah bin Salman 9 South of the water drain and the southern end of the garden. This is to be utilised to house the Main W/T Transmitters. c. Referring to Part 2 of the above signal, it has been confirmed that the bridge on the causeway will not carry the 18 ton Road Tanker. It will be necessary therefore to construot a pier on the north aide of the causeway approximately 100 yards S.W. of the bridge opposite the present traffic turn-round on which to dis charge and turn the Road Tankers conceraed. The size of the pier will need to be in the region of 50 yards square in order to effect a reasonable tarn-around. A snail pump-house and pump etc. will have to be constructed on one of the outside oorners of the pier to effect a connection between the tank lorry and the necessary pipe-line and the whole to be enclosed in a fence as a safety precaution. a S'* pipe-line will need to be laid from the pump-house on the pier diagonally across the bay to the north, and on the sea bed to a convenient point at the road turning leading from the foreshore past the Muharravi School to the airfield and from that point to the proposed site for the storage tanks, (running past the school the line will be buried). A plot of ground 300 ft x 300 ft adjacent to and north of the road between the Muharraq School and the Cemetery Mosque will need to be acquired for the install ation of the airfield bulk storage. 4. negotiations be started with the Bahrain Govern ment for the acquisition of these lands etc. in the terms of the signal quoted above. 5. In this connection the suggestion is put forward tot our A.M.W.D. Clerk of Works would be available to the Bahrain Governments Surveyor to show him the exact positions of the plots in question in order that a correct survey may be made. 6. It is suggested that these lands be leased to the Royal Air Force for the peri od_of hostilities only, with a sufficient time allowance on the cessation of hostilities to allow for the necessary evacuation.

Reference my note dated 20th November 1S43. 2. I enclose a note of certain conversations between representatives of the United States Forces and. myself at which the Air Liaison Officer and Mr. R.LI.Fadow the Assistant Political -»gent, were present. 3. I consider that all leases of land must be to the Royal Air Force and even then should be of a temporary nature that is for the duration of the war and a reasonable period afterwards, say six months. It is also desirable that build ings required to house Allied troops should be the property of the Royal Air Force and erected by our Services. 4. The question of whether or not the W/T installations here and at Sharjah and the meteorological station at the latter place are necessary is a matter for the Royal Air Force experts to decide. Again I would prefer to see them installed by us for obvious reasons. 5. .The Air Liaison Officer has kept me fully informed and has faced a difficult situation with considerable skill. 3d. T. Hickinbotham. Political Agent, Bahrain.f ir? JLl* V n- tfc. x A &gt;31 Kota on an intar view with C&lt;ilonal Lewis, and Pa^cr Van Kostrund of the United States Ar# and Snuaaron-Leaaer j.A. Chase Royal Air Force Air Liaison Officer Bahrain at the Agency on t*lie oi* i&gt;QC6niDor 1^4:3% S3 tojor Van Noetrund stated that he was on the staff of Lajor General halloy commanding the North African -'ing of the American Transport Corps and that Colonel Lewis represented Kajor General Connolly of the Iraq-Persia Command. 1 understood that these two gentlemen had arrived here on the 18th of Beeember and proposed to leave on the 21st December and that they were accompanied by a staff of experts in engineering and signalling. They had had consultations with Squadron Leader Chase and examined the present Royal Air Force installations and had very right and properly been brought round to see me by him to ixplaln their plans and intentions. 2. Bfigor Van Kostrund sketched the general outline of the ’eini'oresment programme, touched on the allotment to them of certain air-fields in North Africa, and dwelt on the magnitude of their programme. He is I believe a laver with political lean ings in civil life. He then traced the history of the project and laid his cards on the table as he termed it or at any rate as many of them as he thought fit to disclose. It seems that their reinforcement plan necessitates their having a permanent landing ground here which would be operated should Abadan become unserviceable and in addition to Abadan *hen their flew of aircraft render it necessary, and an emergency landing ground at Sharjah. 3. Permission has been applied for by General Kalloy to make use of the Royal Air Force landing ground at Bahrain and to con struct certain buildings but by the time Major Van Nostrund left Cairo no answer had been received from the Air Ministry. He trusted that by the time he returned to Cairo, which he hoped would be about the 24th of this month,, sanction would hatte been received and they would be able to proceed with their plans. They expected to commence work here by January 15th, J.944 ana aimed to have Jaebave the work completed hy haren ls th ^l94 4 inajupla time to commence operations by April 1st* 4* In Bahrain they proposed having a permanent establishment of twenty officers and eighty enlisted men and accommodation for a transit popolation of hundred officers and hundred enlisted men. The permanent establishment would deal with the refuelling of air craft, operational matters, and man a u adio Beacon and a ^adio Transmitting and B a cli.o K^ceiving station. 5. At Shariah thmy proposed to install signalling and meteo rological personnel numbering ten officers and forty enlisted men with a transit camp to house twentyfive officers and twentyfiva enlisted men. It appeared that they would install a Kadio Beacon of sorts and certain weather instruments. 6. Major Van Nostrund considered that in Bahrain the present air-field would be ample for their needs and that their housing, recreational, and store buildings could be sited on land already leased to the Iioyal Air Force but the wireless installations would have to be erected on land not yet leased to the Royal Air Force. The buildings would be constructed of local coral and though American engineers would supervise the work they would require approximately a thousand coolies and seventyfive masons and carpenters if they were to complete their construction according to programme. Major Van k'ostrund made it clear that they proposed to under take the construction work themselves simply because British Construct ion Unite were already working to more than capacity and it was essen tial to complete the v/ork in the shortest possible time. The work would be done by the Persia-Iraq Command. . The question of labour arose and I said that I felt sure that the number of semi-skilled men required by them could not be found locally though in my opinion ample coolies would be forthcoming. I did not anticipate any opposition to semi-skilled labour being imported for the -work provided (a) v/e were unable to produce the men locally. (b) The Bahrain Petroleum Company could not make men available temporarily, and (c) That they took them away again when their work was completed. I deprecated the importation of labour on principle and because the /high ^ —‘'•■V -3- high v. f age rates that these men v;ould expect and receive v.ould disturb the local labour market* 7 * Fuel storage installations would he required on laharrac Island and they proposed to carry fuel by tank lorry from 3itra the west side of the cause-way bridge and then pump the fuel via submarine pipe direct to the fuel storage tanks. I said I did no’c like the idea from a security point of view and would prefer to see the fuel brought by barge from 3itra direct to the south- wg;uU corner of Iaharraq Island and thence by pipe—line to the storage plant. V °• given to understand that tne American Air Force detachment would be provisioned from outside and would either arinm the -i-ocdi water or that they would erect a small distil lation plant similar to that now in use at L'asira. They would also arrange their own medical facilities. major an I.ostrund asked me whether there would be an^ delay in tiieix 1 com.iencin^ opei'ations from a political stand point. j- replied what I should make an immediate report to Sir Geoffrey Prior the I cliaical Resident in the Persian Gulf and that v.hen the J ‘^ 1 liaison Gxiicer gave the details of the areas on I.aharraq Island which the -.oyal Air Force might desire to lease in connection with the scheme I would make a further report. I should then await instructions and could not foretell how long it would be before they reached me but provided the India Office and the Air I. inis try uad approved the project I did not anticipate any protracted delay. »hen ^ was instructed to proceed I should negotiate with the 3ahrair Government foi the sites required as additional areas to be leased to tne irco^ al i crce c&gt;nd v/as improbabre that any very consider able delay was to be anticipated. lo. Later the same evening I spoke to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government who agreed with my views about.the actual negotiations for sites unless the sites required were on property not owned by the Bahrain Government in which event some difficulty might be anti cipated with owners. ~ also had an opportunity of a few private words with the Aii /LiaisonLiaison Officer v.ho 'told me 'oiiat. or /an Kost»runcL had suggested tnat the United States Air Force should be in Oj/erecftional control of the landing ground. The Air Liaison Officer objected most strongly and said that for a variety of reasons of a Service nature the Loyal Air Force would undoubtedly retain operational control of the Air Port. 20th december 1943.

(ii) In line 11 on page 2 we suggest the substitution of 'probably give rise to' for the words 'provide them with some moral'. We do not think we should admit that U.S. expenditure 'provides them with a moral claim,' (iii) We would, like the last sentence cm page 2 to be omitted, i.e,, from the words 'Americans might' down to 'long term monopoly'. We think it ought not to be transmitted unless thsre is every assurance of confidential treatment. Yours sincerely.

Suggestion for diversion of Americans to Persian rout© is presumably on the basis that in the event of its proving impossible to accommodate them on (?Arab) littoral by means of British construction Americans would instal independent organisation oa the Persian side* Argument is not clear to us for even if Americans themselres improve the airfields at Bahrain and Shargah these would at feast remaia under British control# 3„ ivioreover present information available here suggests it is probable that Arab coast duly improved will carry traffic. if not we Could hardly regard with equanimity position in which independent American interests would operate in important sone of Influence along the Persian Gulf. Negotiations would presumably be direct between Americans and the Persian Government and, even should R.A*P. and British airway interests obtain the right of user during the war, there would be no certainty of &gt; continuance cf this right. Americans would no doubt seek to obtain loAg-term control on monopoly basis. If in the event of double reinforcement route down the Gulf becomes operational necessity, we think aim should be oonstruction and operation as joint concern following joint negotiations with the Persian Government. 4- On long view some of the air interests in Persia should not be overlooked. 5.

I submit a draft which is, I think,self-explanatory. It has been shown to Mr. Dean of the Air I,Unis try, who has concurred, though he wishes also to make sure that the Civil Aviation Department agree: he willlet us know this as soon as possible. The Government of India in their telegram No.43 of the 3rd January suggest that a visit to Cairo by Sir Geoffrey Prior would be useful to promote better coordination between R.A.F. H.Q. and the Political authorities in the Gulf. (They have already suggested such a visit for the purpose of discussing food supply difficulties with M.E.

As we are discussing food difficulties with Mr. Murray of M.E.S.C. on Friday we might wait till then to get his agreement also to the proposal of a visit by the Resident before we send any instructions to Sir Geoffrey Prior.

As we see this case main objective as in other large questions arising in the Persian Gulf should be maintenance in British hands of major part in direction and (?Control of) air installations in that region. Position arising on Prior’s reference therefore requires careful analysis, with reference also to possible effects on (?post)~war air organisation of any arrangements made in this region. i 3. principle that U. 3. A. may establish their own radio and meteorological stations on British established airfields, e. g. trans-Africa and trans^Tndia, has been accepted both by H.M.G. and Government of India. Question therefore arises whether any reason exists for application of different principle in the Persian Gulf. 4. In every case of American user it has been made clear that above arrangement in war tame is made without prejudice to post-war position and the President has withheld his support from theory that American war installations create post-war vested interest. On this point general principle we have put forward in recent conferences was that every State has the right to control ground organisations in its territory. In case of Sheikhdoms we can take position that this right vested in Sheikhs would be exercised on their behalf by H.M.G. position which could hardly be challenged at any rate before establishment of international organisation. 5. (VOur) provisional views on Prior's proposals to divert American interest to Persian side of the Gulf are as follows side is r egard s (a) His assessment of dependency of air fields on Persian im* 1 i juI. and ou t of date on present standards both as *1 d/ »4 v j [NOiA OFFICE (b)/Vb) Ifc is true that the opening of Persian route would certainly benefit India in the war period if under British control and would afford sitralar advantage in the post-war period under, the principles of freedom of air already proposed; but (c) Danger of this route growing up under* American control would lie in affording U. S. A. bases in .important section of (?world) ring enabling her to develop on her own lines and so prejudicing the chances of her entering international agreement. 6. . On these arguments our conclusion is that it is wiser to work to bring in Americans under our wing and ourselves to provide them with what they require for their reinforcement plans rather than to encourage them to establish independent organisation. • . 7.

We also despatched our explanatory telegram to the Political Resident at Ext. 6845 on the same date, though we understand from the Telegraph Branch that there has been some technical breakdown which has delayed it.

Department and their views are set out in Mr. Rumbold's note of the 30th December. Till we get the reply from H.Q., R.A.P., M.E. to the Air Ministry's telegram of the 28th December, it is perhaps premature to take the matter further with the Air Ministry and the Foreign Office, who are also interested, but it might be convenient to set out our views in a letter to the Air Ministry as in the attached draft. 3if( ^ ^ £l ' K. &gt; C^ 'Lc^ vtc^-V^ j^ww Mt. (c. ^ f ^ u , ^wvc^w *1 tz M Ct rc-«^7 JbIRAFT LETTER, Kf\\ M.J. Dean Esq., U.S.A. Department, Air Ministry, Whitehall, ■ S.W.L Dear Dean, We have been considering further the question of the Americans* request for facilities at Bahrein and Sharjah and, inter alia , the Political Resident*s suggestion that they should be diverted to the Persian side of the Gulf. Pending the receipt of the reply from H.Q., R.A.P., Middle East, to your telegram of the 28th December, it is perhaps premature to take the Political Resident's suggestion further, but you may find it useful to have a general statement of our views on the whole question, which has been drafted in consultation with the Department here interested in questions of post-war civil aviation. There are really two aspects of the matter to be borne in mind when considering the American requests. The first is our position in relation to the Sheikhs of Bahrein/2 . Bahrein and Sharjah in particular and in the Persian Gulf as a whole, and the second is the e.ffect of any facilities given to the Americans in these States on • * o the whole question of post-war civil aviation in this part of the world* The first question is perhaps the Political Residents main interest. As you know the Americans already have a strong interest in Bahrein hy reason of the oil concession granted to the Bahrein Petroleum Oil Company, an American Company, and we have recently with some difficulty warded off American requests to be allowed to establish an American Consul in Bahrein. An American Oil Mission has recently been visiting the Gulf, while American interest in the air route to India along the Gulf is, of course, well known. With all these facts in mind, the Political Resident has every reason to regard any proposal to allow the Americans to construct their own buildings and wireless installations in Bahrein with the greatest apprehension. It is indeed essential that nothing should be done which might result in the Americans securing a permanent/3 As 'j js&lt;. C^r&lt;- Lw-v-^iT ) permanent footing in Bahrein as an air base, if our whole position and influence with the Sheikh is not to he completely under-mined* Wbr would the mischief stop there, for the other States in the G-ulf would he quick to note developments in Bahrein and we should find before long that our influence in the Persian Gulf as a whole had been fatally weakened, The second aspect of the matter is principally the concern of the Air Ministry, though obviously there is a considerable Indian interest in the maintenance of our position along this important line of Imperial air conraunication; The policy of H.M.G. in these matters is laid down in Air Ministry memorandum CS,198o4 of the 2nd September, paragraph 3(v) of which states that permission given to the Americans in such circum stances will be for official purposes and for the duration of the war only and that any facilities created will carry with them no post-war rights or ownership or \aser* T^ e view is, hosve.vevy being put forward by / powerful sections of opinion in the U.S.A, that . + • 4 aviation instsGLlations built by American labour or paid/paid for by the United States Government or equipped with lease-lend material, should be made available without restriction after the war to American civil aircraft, « or, indeed, to the aircraft of all nations, and our Ambassador in Washington has expressed the view that we shall certainly be faced with this demand at the end of the war. It is therefore very important that we should avoid in these Persian Gulf states any risk of the Americans establishing a moral claim to post-war facilities in the air bases. Accordingly we agree fully with the statement in your telegram of the 28th December that the ideal solution would be for the erection of buildings and installation of technical facilities in Bahrein to be undertaken by the R.A.F. and we hope that this will prove practicable. This would make it impossible for the Americans to claim that their financial contribution - and this is likely to he the vital criterion - represents- more than a fraction of the total cost. The alternative solution that the work should he executed hy .American • - * personnel on the understanding that it is done on an agency basis for the E.A.P. , while regularising the position/5 position insofar as our relations with the Sheikh are concerned, would not be so satisfactory from the 7 point of view of pv^v^nt-i a moral claim to- the use P’C- of the base after the war* We feel, therefore, that if the reply from H.Q., R.A.F., M.E, shows that execution of the necessary constructional work by the R.A.F. is not practicable, full consideration should be given to the Political Residents recommendation that the Americans should be urged to develop the route along the Persian coast. The fact that they are already in Abadan would appear to make the suggestion not unreasonable. There are, no doubt, objections to this proposal; we should for instance have to make sure that the net result of making it would not be that the Americans eventually establish themselves on - both routes; and if the Americans developed the northern route, they would be able to claim post-war rights there which, if they were conceded by the Persians, might be nearly as prejudicial to a fair post-war settlement as would similar rights at Bahrein. Neverthe le ss/Nevertheless, we are inclined to think that £rom our point of view this solution would be preferable to allowing the Americans to create facilities at Bahrein at their own cost if this would in fact be the result of an arrangement under which they were acting on • 4 V • • • an agency basis for the R.A.P, I am ending a copy of this letter to Hankey at the Foreign Office, c . . . • \ 1 [IT.um#ol Ur. Rura^bld I attach our file on the Americans revest for air facilities at Bahrein and Sharjah and other points on the air route between 2 The Air Ministry's reply tp R#A*F, Middle Cairo and Karachi, Kast is flagged.. You will see that they ask for the A.O.C.-in-C s detailed proposals for the work to be entrusted to the Americans and emphasize that a final decision must be given in London. Meanwhile the Political Resident 1 s telegram 2477, in which- he ; suggests diverting the Americans to the Persian coastal, air route instead of the Arabian coast route, has been received and must now be considered urgently^ It may be desirable to hAve'a meeting, with Foreign Office and Air Ministry representatives. I understand that the Air Ministry's first reaction to the r •&gt; • 0 suggestion is not favourable and that they think, it may only result in the Americans getting a footing on both sides of the Persian CJ-ulf. As regards the Political Resident's remarks it^is, of,course, for the experts to say but I^should doubt whether it would now be- considered tliat the Persian route had many advantages over the Arabian route. The chief_hihadv&amp;ntages.of the patter used to be, considered to be the sea crossing of 226 miles from .Muscat to Cwadar but this may not ; be thought much of ncr.vadays. The direct line, across: the- sea between Bahrein and 3ha(Cah is ^uite sus long as this.. Moreover t^e.question of petrol; supplies: is greatly simplified at Baiirein, which has a refinery on the spot. But there is, of course, a great deal in what 'the Political c Resident says in keeping the Americans as far as possible out of the Gulf States. We should be glad to have your views on the subject as soon as possible. ‘ M/m. ^ t La. p ' ^ •X. iV ^ CvX. vM USfcTC t&lt; tz p t &gt; t, U t fc. Pe^v~ wt . ^ ^ ^ Ic ^ zA-UlCvUi. . ^ ^ ^ t, P .-dx L L-dh ^ fc cW ^ 4 . ^ ^The policy of H.M.G. in these matters is laid down in the Air Ministry Memorandum of 2nd September of which a copy has been sent to the Government of India, This laid it down that the requests by the U.S. authorities for new facilities must be referred to L 0 nion, that this is also the position as regards major additions to existing facilities, that the Ajnsricans must be given no exclusive rights, that even if the Americans•are given operational control we must decide questions of policy and to assume control in the event of military necessity. It is also laid down that 'so far as possible any agreed facilities up to the standard we regard as necessary should be provided by us, The Americans may instal facilities in excess of these standards if they so desire.that the permission given to the Americans should be for official purposes only and for the duration of the war, it being clearly understood that no post-war rights of ownership or user are implied. We are awaiting the views of the Government of India regarding the machinery for the application of these principles in India, 2, We must remember in dealing with this question that powerful sections of U.S, opinion are putting forward the view that aviation installations built by American labour or paid for by the U, S, Government or equipped with Lend/Lease material should be made available without restriction after the war to American civil aircraft or indeed to the aircraft of all nations. The issue is becoming a very important one in American domestic politics and it is the view of H.M. Embassy, Washington that we shall certainly be faced with this demand at the end of the-war. The extent to which we can resist it will be largely influenced 'by the number of air ports to the construction of which 1116 Americans can claim to have contributed substantially. Our main bargaining counter with the Americans in negotiations for a world wide settlement about post-war civil air transport is the fact that we shall posses more bases than they do. In order to attain a reasonable settlement in other directions we snail have to allow American (and other) aircraft to land at Bahrein (and other air ports in British territory) for fuel and repairs. We shall also have to permit American aircraft to pick up and put down passengers, frei^at, and mails carried between Bahrein and U.S. territory. If our general bargaining position is weak we may be forced to permit the U.S. aircraft to carry passengers,freight and mails between Bahrein and third countries , such as Egypt, Italy and Java or even between Bahrein and British territory such as India or the United Kingdom, The result of this would be likely to be that the Americans would be able to drive British aircraft off the skies, we would be dependant for our comiaunications with Bahrein upon American air lines and practically no aircraft except American ones would land at Bahrein, Ye would I think at the worst be able to insist that the control of the air port at Bahrein including the radio and meteorological facilities should remain with us. The moral of this is that it is important to avoid any increase in the number of air bases in which the Americans establish a moral claim to post-war facilities. 3. I should like to emphasise that the vital criterion is the amount of American money spent on the creation of the facilities in question. The exaction frcm the Americans of written safeguards, e,g. specific provision that the war time grant of facilities carries no post-war implications. are not worth much. Nor is the description of the of facilities by American personnel on an ' Agency basis‘'for the R.A.F. much better, if I am right in interpreting it as simply a form of words without much reality. If it means that the Americans would be paid by us for their services, that we provide the equipment needed or pay the Americans for it in dollars, that would be all right, but it would be quite contrary to the principles of mutual aid which govern our financial relations wi+*» +**«» safeguard, but not mud Id be only a small part of the total cost of the facilities, A. A place like Bahrein^which is not British territory is more vulnerable to American post-war claims to facilities for civil aircraft than air ports situated in British territory, because it is easier to suggest an ^ invasion of the sovereign rights of a small place of ^ indeterminea status than those of H.M. Government. A. Consequently these American attempts to intrude their ^ influence at Bahrein suggest that it may be desirable to consider again whether the Sheikhdom should now be declared a British Protectorate. that the Sheikh would 5./r 4 , 5, It is clear that adequate facilities for the passage of aircraft to the East must be provided and it is for the R.A.F* to advise how far what the Americans ask for at Bahrein is necessary. The ideal solution would be for whatever facilities are necessary^to be stablished at Bahrein in a manner which would make it impossible for the Americans to cl^im that their financial contribution was more than an of the total cost. We would then have any territory under our control facilities with a post-war value without any moral obligations to share them with Americans after th£ w^r. If the Americans were diverted to the Coast they would be able to claim post-war fights ttspeugh which, if they were conceded by t the would be nearly as prejudicial to ga» gacft post-war settlement as would similar rights at Bahrein. Moreover this would result in post-war traffic being drawn away from Bahrein and the growing position of the Island asMetropolis of the Gulf would be weakened. But I agree with you that this would be preferable to allowing the Americans to create facilities at Bahrein at their own cost. It may, therefore, be premature to consider the Political Resident’s telegram No. 2477 until the R.A.F., Middle East reply to the Air Ministry telegram No. AX. 320 and we see how far the former can provide what is wanted at Bahrein at the expense of H.

I therefore make following pror»osal. 5 , Persian Coastal Air route has many advantages over Arabic side e.r., absence of Ions sea crossings- (V We) only left it with great reluctance and KLM and Air Prance operated it successfully until last moment. Americans are already in Abadan. Buchire has fine modern airfields. Asalu 1,200 yards strip which stood up well after rain- (?Lingah) aivi Jask ha^e fine airfields (v regularjly used by KLM) and ( excellent airfields has just been found at Bandar Abbas. An air route along this coast would moreover be of benefit to us in war time by supplying a swift means of communication which is now lacking- I therefore strongly recommend that they should be urged to develop this new route where they will not clash with ours- Any further American expansion on Arabic side can only create a series of problems and further weaken our position in an area where we have vital interests. *S«3 rn, . •? p dec i g45 j l ^DlA Qpp^v &gt;•?: vv . juet i-eaeived from Political Agent Bahrein says ■'■ t ' s - ns have p-lso enquired about possibilities a: DhsHnan. by express 0 ^ Agent'a report is being forwarded, , ■ —————— C£V -&amp; fki telegram from H.Q., R.A.P., Middle East X.7158&gt; was discussed with representatives of the Air Ministry on December 24th and the draft reply below in so far as the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms were concerned, was agreed u/xa* with, though subject to approval by higher authority in the Air Ministry.

It will be seen that in connection with a programme for transport of aircraft from North Africa to India via the Persian G-ulf, the Americans have asked permission to construct installations at various points on the route including Bahrein and Sharjah where they wish to undertake work in connection with housing for personnel, meteorological observation^* coranunications* and ^operations. They have asked that the constructional work should be performed by the U.S. Army with their own personnel, equipment and material. The exact amount of work which is contemplated is not yet clear but it seems that they are aiming at the flow of about k 1*000 aircraft a month which will presumably mean something fairly considerable. f Ox 4v» 1 We had already received some indication that the Americans were contemplating additional facilities at Bahrein and the correspondence on the file below is concerned with an approach by the R.A.P. Liaison Officer to the Bahrein Government on behalf of the U.S. Air Force to which objection was taken by the Political Resident, t The upshot of this was that after discussion at Bahrein the A.O.C. Iraq sent a telegram (at Ext.6599/43) to the Political Resident saying that all requests from the U.S. Air Force for facilities at Bahrein would be referred to Air Force Headquarters in Iraq before approval© It is suggested that we should at once write to the Air Ministry giving our comments on R.A.F.

We hope that it may also be possible/possible to place the U.S.A.A.F.'s activities at Bahrein under the general control of the R.A.F.

You will nave received my telegram on this topic to the Air Officer Com;,uncling.

On learning the facte set out by Kloklnboth&amp;m I sent for him and told him that if he ^ ^uve trouble again in this way the results would be very serious for him. 3. Be said thot he thought he ought to be kept informed of such intentions on the part of outsiders in Bahrain anc I was able to say quite truthfully that 1 knew nothing myself. in fact i uncerstfjnd that hillock, the Air Officer Commanding, \ himself knew nothing about this influx of American A.T.C. generals who of course are simply air line executives ^n uni form. ftfirc Anderson told me that Smith was Vice rresicent of United Air Lines in private life l 4. 1 am sending a copy oi this letter to leel together k &gt; with its enclosures. Kours sincerely, ghtm&amp;n, Asquire, C.I.L., X.C .S., sc. Geoffrey Prior.oqu&amp;dron Leader W.A. Chase, Air Liaison Officer, Banrain, informed me on the 16th Bovember that lajor-General Smith of the United States Army, who i understand is concerned with the American Transport Corps, was arriving that afternoon. Sq./Ldr. Chase had no idea of the purpose of the General’s visit but thought it would have something to do with C il Coiapany matters. This is the fourth General Olficer ol United Ltates Aruy wno has visited Banrain during the last two or three weejcs; the others being La^or-General Somerville, Major- General Connolly, and Major General Royce. tla, or-General Smith duly arrived and stayed the night with the Bahrain Petroleum Company and 1 lev/ to fchahran the following day vhere he was the guest of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. Re returned to Bahrain on the evening of the 17th and left for Abadan (?) on the morning of the 18th. 2. At about 7 p.m. on the 17th, the Air Liaison Officer telephoned to me ana sale that he would like to come and see me for a f ew minutes. He duly came and gave me the gist of conversations which it transpired that he hac had with a Major Rice who had accompanied Ma 0 or-General Smith. The talks with this American Ara^ oificer were of a semi-official nature ana were designed to discover what would be needed to carry out the American Re-i nf or cement Plan ana to what extent the Royal Air Force could meet the American requirements. The Air Liaison Officer told me that the three most important points were x- (a) A pipe line from the twiddle ol the causeway linking Marmraah with Kah&amp;rr&amp;q to the fuel tank on the latter i sland. (b) The erection ol accommodation lor permanent and transit American personnel* (c)The erection of an American wireless installation, purely lor use with aircraft* I unaerstood that (a) was necessitated by the fact that the swing briage on the causeway could only carry a load of five tons and that the petrol tank lorries whicn were to be used to bring the petrol from the bulk storage at Sitr&amp;h to i aharr&amp;q weighed, when full, something in the neighbourhood of RO tons, (b) - accommodation would not be available in the Royal Air Force Lines ana thd t it would be essential to con struct huts for the Americans, probably of pre-fabricated materials, ana (c) - that the Americans would h&amp;ve their own wireless installation owing to the Ro&gt;al Air i’orce ireless already having as much work as it could se expected to deal w&amp; th. 3. in reply to a question from me the Air Liaison Officer informed me that he h&amp;a alreaay spoken to the Acviser and obtainec what he cescribec as his un-official approval on behalf ol the Bahrain Government. He saw the Adviser on his- ii - wety to kltth£».rra.q aeroGroiufc a-bout 3 p«Bi# on the 17 th and agtin met him the same evening. i underetano that neither meeting was by appointment but Doth appear to have been completely accicental. The Air Liaison Officer mentioned that he had telephoned to ^a w or Rice alter his conversations with &amp;r. Bel grave and that he had told him that he had sounded the Bahrain Government unofficially and die not expect that they would have any objection to the proposals. 4 . l iniormea the Air Liaison Officer that it ?^s clearly wrong oi him to have had any cirect coniTsunication whatsoever with the Bahrain Govemrr.ent on an important matter like this, and that he most uncoubtecly should have approaches me in the first instance. i pointec out to him that by going direct to the Aoviser anc then ini ormeng JLa^or Rice of the result ol his conversation, however un-oiiicinl it might have been, he may have ver&gt; seriously hanaicappec us in our future dealings with the United States authorities in reg&amp;rc to the present proposal• The Air liaison Officer said that he was extremely sorry for what had occurred and that it had been bis inten tion to see me first but the purely chance meetings with the Aoviser had seemed to offer a good opportunity of ment/ the subject there sne then. y b. in regard to our attitude towards this propoe can •invasion* I told the Air Liaison Officer that# to confirmation by Sir Geoffrey Prior the n or. ’ bib the a a* ticai Resident in the Persian Gulf, it was my opinion tnat there should be no cirect dealin 0 between the Bahrain Government ana the American Ari^y authorities or if possible between them and the Politico! Agent. 1 wo Id prefer to see them essentially a part of the Royal Air Force organiza^rl tion in much the same position as the present 'Staging i'Oat’ 5 on Kaharraq Island, for they will merely be a staging post for American aircraXt. i also saic that i would prefer that b their dealings with the Political Authorities should be through the Senior Royal Air iorce Officer on the station who would presumably be the Station Commbnder anc that there should nd&gt;t be any question of lane being leased to the American Arty authorities but that they should be^scev Ja-— dated on lane already leased or to be leasee tx? th» voyai Air iorce. The Air Liaison Officer said that he *4ulc convey my views to Air-Vice-karsha 11 R.P. Willock, C.B#po was expected to arrive on the lai th Poveiiiber, en-youte to - dtn where he was to conier with the A ii Officer Jomcaiic ing Ceylon anc the Air Off icer Commanding Aden./ 6 6. On his arrival A ir-Vice-f arshall i?l° c k who vas accompanied by Group Captain Alexander, Grdiijp.^^hipta^in Brown, Colonel Clements anc v ing Comraander Kirk, asked me tgp^gh't. the Air Liaison Officer to go round in the evening anc him. Ttiere was no mention of any official meeting $ i was somewhat surprised on my arrival at the Air L^ Officer’s house to line what amounted to a serion in progress anc Kr. Lloyd Taylor tne Regional British Overseas Airways Corporation in attend;/• • ?• it aeocied that the Air Vice-Marshall had taken strong exception to the Air Liaison Cificer’s action in having ’agreed* to so mbxiy arrangements *ith the American Transport Corps* representative. in this connection please see the attached “private' copy ol the Air Liaison Officer’s r^ort to his superiors. The Air Vice-Marshall statec that it ras necessary to be most careful ^hen dealing v.ith the American transport Corps and always to bear in mind that the senior oil leers of that Corps %ere in peace time the most brilliant executives©! the American Civil Aviation campa niftft* Th u - ir / ice-k arrtnal} ^en t on to point out that the *holu scheme voulu have to be considered very careiuliy ana that any attempt to hustle the Royal Air i'orce into granting facilities, which might be unnecessary and which they might later regret must be gueraed against. He then turned to me anc said that he felt that if the Americans c ic 1 come here* he thought that all dealing-s with the Politic^ 1 authorities st.ould be through the Royal Air force anc that there should be no direct coiununi- cution with the Bahrain Government. 1 told him th&amp;t 1 was in entire agreement anc 1 vent on to say that I thought the American Transport Corps should oe considered as nothing ..ore than temporary ter.ants' o! the Royal Air force and tnat there should be no question of their acquiring leases of lane or carrying out any work o! their own. Such con struction as would have to be carriea out to provide accommodation i or them should be done by or through the Royal Air force, such re-fuelling arrangements as were necessary should be cone by the Royal Air force, ano notniir, onoulc be cone wnich would give the African Government even the most imaginary right to any permanent facilities in Bahrain. The Air Vice-Marshall said that he was in agreement. 8. TLere was some discussion regarding the pipe line which the Air Liaison 01 fleer and iajor Rice proposed should be run across the causeway. 1 saic that i d id not like the idea at all becuaee 1 felt that there *as serious banger oi fire anc that traffic on a busy highway would undoubtedly be obstructed by large tank lorries carrying fuel to the pumping station wnich v&amp;s to be sited tv.o- third ol the way across the cause-way. 1 did not approve of the idea oi the line being in close proximity to the town and suggested that the possibility of moving the petrol by barge from Sitra to the South of Maharraq town and from there by pipe-line to the aerodrome should be con sidered. Colonel Clements, who is the Chief Engineer at Air Headquarters, Kabbaniya, said that he agreed and would much prefer to see the line moved, both for the reasofas 1 haa stated and also because damage to the causeway would disorganize the petrol supplies both to our own anc to American aircraft. he said that he would prefer to have a small jetty exteiiaing into the sea somewhere to the south oi aharrnq town possibly supporting an above-water pipe and that the petrol should ie pumped from the barge direct to the re-fuelling tank on the landing (round. 9 . /9» There was no further conversation on the mtin topic but i learnt from Kr. Lloya Taylor that the British Over seas Airways OorpoBation were suspenaing Iheir services along the South Arabian route anc that this was being cone against hi u advice. The Air Vice-iarshftll saic that it was a great pity they were to suspend the ervices especi ally in view of the fact that the Americans were flying twelve aircraft in each direction each day. 1 also heard that it was proposed to re-ar* io. 244 Squadron at Sharjah anc that tne Squacron Headquarters would probably be uovin t&gt; to tasira leaving a flijht only at Sharjah. 1 further learnt that it was just possible that our American friencs woulc be utilising Sharjah as a re-fuelling station. ltd.

The above is vague but gives an indication of the possibilities to be catered for in the very near future, i t is emphasised that all inlormation e- iven here will be passed by the A.T.C. Authorities to Rc^RAFEB for sanction prior to any direct action being taken In so far as Bahrain is concerned. 3. The above programme will entail the installation of the loll owing facilities Transmitting anc Receiving Point to Point V&lt;/T facili ties, and Region Control; all of which have been discussed, sited and orov isionally agreed by me. 4. ACCOKLOh/T IUK . The A.T.C* Authorities require accommocation for Permanent Staff for something like 20 Officers and 80 other ranks, they also envisage Transit Accommodation lor 30 Officers and 60 Cther Ranks. 1 have informed them that 1 cannot las i see it at the moment J see us being capable oi providing any such accommodation. They have therefore agreed provisionally to site their accor j iOdat ion on the Southern enc of the R*A.* .

The present R.A.P . establishment of 100 octane ^ uel is 200,000 gallons. The off-take oi r uel by tne / mericans in 'phage 1' is estimated to be 120,000 gallons per monta, 'Phase 2' is estimated to be at some tiling in the region of 300,000 gallons per month. The above figures obviously cannot be htaiclea by tinned or barrelled Fuel. The proposals to cope v. ith this and consequent probabl e Air Force expansion are as follows :- Tank No. 921 (the Tank at Sitra already holding Bulk 100 octane Fuel) to be retained. The Americans will supply 4,000 gallon^ tank lorries (Two) to convey this Fuel to a point just est of the Bridgeon the Causeway. A pipe line will be constructed from this point to a Bulk Storage installation, to be situated within a fe\ hundred yards ot the airfield et Juharraq, from which the refuelling units will refill as required, thus eliminating all minor storage and containers• it has be^n agreec, pending a^prov^lf that the Ho^al Air x orce will retain full responsibility for all refuell ing until ouch time as the Bulk Installation is complete and in full operation. it has been further agreed that the Ro; ai Air j. orce will retain responsibility for the maintenance oi aaequate stocks of fuel in the Main Supply Tanx Ho. 921 at Sitra* Un Uie coiipletion of the Bulk installation, the J*S.A.T. C. Authorities Lave &lt;^reed to assume full respon sibility for the complete refuelling of all aircraft, of any service. i was informed that the U.S»A.T.C« Autnoritiee are sending, almost immediately, three 1350 gallon ref uelling units to Bahrain* These comprise a motive unit and trailer each of wi.ich is entirely sell-conta inec, and i have agreed, that, with the assistance of their personnel, to operate these units until i have over complete control of refuell ing lacilities to them. it appears that the U.S.A.T.C. are prepared to look after themselves from the Administrative point of view entirely* They v. ill house anc feec themselves and v.ill be independent as a unit. i have discussed these projects with totn the Political Agent ana the /dviser to the Bahrain Ooverniaent (treading, at times, on somewhat delicate ground); neverthe less, providing all concerned are consul tec and kept in formed of the developments 1 feel that there should be no serious hitch. 1 think that the Bahrain Government, providing that no objection is raised or the Political side, will agree toi a* The use oi the Gausevay. b. The laying oi. the Pipe-line. c* TL installation of the requisite Storage Tanas* (All oi which sites have been discussed with the lolitical Agent &amp; the Adviser)* The only material required by the U.S.A.T.C. Authori ties is the provision oi the necessary pipe lor the Bulk Refuelling Scheme. This is in stock in Bahrain and held by the Royal Air force, and means about to 1% miles of pipe. 1 have offered, pending approval, to supply this quantity of 3' line-pipe (ex Tatar stock). 1 resent stock being something like a thousand lengths by 20 feet of 3* line-pipe, say 3^ miles of pipe. The whole of the rest of the Materials, U.S.A*T*G* Authorities have agreed to supply namely Camp Hutting \irmg. Lights Cable for remote controls Tankage, Ref uelling Units. M.T* Tanker haulage Lnits. In adaition they are sending their individual expertson efa-ch branch to discuss &amp;nc. arrange siting anc construc tion detail and they have been ini armed the. t they must pro vide fully for their ovm Works Services as personnel of tlie Royal Air frorce are not available to unuertake any ’orks services for them. h' 1KAL it is suggested that the ultimate control ol every phase of U.B.j .t*C. Operations is vested in the Station CoM&amp;oncer, Royal Air iorce, Bahrain. it is in no way suggested or intended that local operational or Acministmtive coi^rol be eilected, but mat ters concerning the running oi the fioyal Air i?orce Station* ano Political Dn.tters in this area including Liaidon vith the Bi hrain Goverrimtm)t itseli , should be placed through the station Ccraraunder, R.A.R. Station, Bahrain. Consequent upon certain suggestions made above it v;il 1 be necessary to approach the Bahrain Government officially, through H.B.M’s iolitical Agent for the leasing of small portions oi grounc, and to obtain permission for certain constructions. it is essential, in the interests of both parties, that such concessions shall be vested sole ly in the name oi the Royal Air xorce for Political reasons.MHHHHHHMBBHiHHMMHHBHi FILE COPY . b H- IE ARP TKL.BQRAM j S 3 C R 94^4855 (if in any case the communication of the contents of this document to any person outside Government 4 *%rvice is authorised# it must he paraphrased} • Allotted to External Department* Copies circulated.

This includes policy and strategy discussions over how best to maintain British control of the Arabian Coast Air Route; British planners feared that the United States might use facilities, built using American personnel and finance, as a lever for post-war concessions in civil aviation. It therefore includes correspondence related to the leasing of land, and the construction of buildings, by the Royal Air Force (RAF) for the use of the United States.A map showing Bahrain Oil Company (BAPCO) establishments in Bahrain can be found on folio 127, and a table showing the facilities required by the United States can be found on folio 102.The main correspondents are as follows: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Charles Geoffrey Prior), the Political Agent at Bahrain (Tom Hickinbotham), officials of the Air Ministry, officials of the India Office (Roland Tennyson Peel, Francis Anthony Kitchener Harrison, and Dennis Mackrow Cleary), officers of Air Headquarters in Iraq, and representatives of the External Affairs Department of the Government of India.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
