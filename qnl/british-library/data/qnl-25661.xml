Bughire 12/12/15 Contents: Situation in Muscat. After I haci sent off my despatch A.22 dated 25/9 on the situation in Muscat the instructive news contained in the Governor of German East Africa's despatch to the Imperial Colonial Office (forwarded On account of the close relations which still exist between Muscat and East Africa — since several thousands of Arabs from Oman and adjoining districts live in German East Africa — much more copious news of those parts reaches there than here in Eushire where no such relations exist^. In Eushire we rely main ly for reports on Muscat upon the newspaper artici.es which appear fairly often in the 'Times of India' and the 'Near East' the latter being a weekly ^ublirhod apparently. Direct news from Muscat only comes through Persian merchants who do business there. The Consulate Mirza^hom I had instructed to open up relations with these peoplejdeclares with reference to this source of information that it is remarkably difficult to get the Persians who live in Muscat to supply any reports whatsoever. They say their correspondence is supervised by the Sultan*^ entourage and that the Arabs are very suspicious. with your A.17707? of 20/8) reached me. in London and very well run v The Arab population o r 1500 soulsp (3) souls is exclusively composed of persons of the lowest classes principally Hammuls (porters),who have lost all touch with the Arab coast and know nothing of events there. Reuters telegrams announced that Sultan Seyyid Faisal bin Turki died suddenly on October 7. It was of course supposed that he had been poisoned by his enemies and people saw a con firmation of this rumour in the fact that the British Consul Gen eral in Bushirfi,5ir Percy Cox,who took ship for Muscat immediately on hearing the news of the death,was accompanied by the English Government doctor. I could however learn nothing further about this on my return from Shiraz to Bushire. The English have ap - pointed his son Timur bin Faisal as his successor ; he is j about 30 or 40 years of age. In the seal with vrhich he im - 1 presses his letters he 'proudly dssignates hinself us 'CCLTAN of Muscat &amp; OMAh',although his power does not extend beyond the outposts established by the English around the town of Muscat, and those places on the coast which are garrisoned by English war ships. When the new Sultan sent this Consulate an answer (to a letter) about some case or other re which correspondence had passed with the late Sultan,I quietly gave him the same title (Sultan of Muscat &amp; Oman) when writing to him again. But that his power does not extend over Oman even the English Officers of the 2nd Rajputs here have confirmed to me,they having been sent H iM to Muscat for several months at the outbreak of unrest there. They also told me what a terri ble time the English sailors had of it in the infernal heat of Muscat guarding the round bare rocks. - As for the Sultan himself the( 4 ) the Major of the Indian 'Intelligence Department stationed here,who also was in Muscat,toli ne frankly 'He is an absolute fool'. He understood nothin, sf rrf.at ran sal?, to hia.- So as occupant of the Sultan's throne he suits the requirements of English policy in the Gulf to perfection - especially those of Sir Percy Cox who has hitherto interpreted (lit.7 'guided') them and who just now has been compelled to cease from his restless activity for the suppression of any independence m the Gulf. He has gone on leave never to return,and has been replaced by Mr.J.G.Lorimer hitherto Consul General in Baghdad. In the last number of the 'Times of India' there app- . portrait of the »..

As the products of Kurope and India such as clo thing,rice etc.are necessaries of life for the population,taere is no doubt this prohibition will have a very oppressive effect in the interior. But it remains to be seen whether they will not find means of getting needful supplies through the small ports. The Sultan has also endeavoured to win over to his side a Shaikh called BU SOBIR.of whom I know nothing,and asked him to come to Muscat. He is said to have written to Shaikh Salim bin Rashid himself asking him to come to Muscat and offering to come to terms with him. Salim is inter alia to give him back two har - hours in his possession and in return to rule the interior region independently. But Balia r — cto' thsss sro.osels and rallied that ha would not come to Muscat. It is to be assumed that the inlaa d tribes will not alwa remain united. Then it will be easy for the Sultan with the help of the English to gain influence with this or that Shaikh amd gradually to extend his power. Mo doubt England is not so very anxious for this to happen immediately. The trade of Muscat which depends chiefly or. the inland market is not sufficiently im - portant for England to feel herself moved on that score to swift ! measures and costly expeditions. What is important for England, j naBe iy the control of the port of Muscat and the coast,can be attained at less expense by maintaining a garrison am. som -nail warships in Oman waters (both of course at India's expense) than by definitive suppression of the insurgent/movement.- The Arabs are cowards when confronted by modern firearms. The English of ficers in Muscat say they have often proved the truth of this observation(6) \ n observation,which has been Bade before/by others. An attack on Muscat is therefore hardly to be appre bended fron the inland tribes,and so it is iapossible to fore see how long the state of/ war will last. W'dSftWIUSS* (Wassmuss to Berlin)* No.A*26. Contents : Departure of Sir P.Cox and —arrival of Mr.Lorimer. Bushire 19/12/13. As Y.E.has been informed by the despatch of the Imper- ial Consul Baghdad No.A.6 of the Vth October,the erstwhile Brit ish Consul General and Political Resident in Bushire,Sir Percy Cox,has been given a successor in the person of Mr.J-G.Lor_ner who has hitherto been employed in Baghdad. The new gentleman arrived here on the 6th instant and Sir P.Cox left Bushire on the 8th. In the announcement of his handing over he said he had furlough for 3* months and that during his absence Mr.Bonmer Resident &amp; Consul General in Baghdad would act. the latter signed as ' Consul General de S a Majesty Britannique,G^rant du Consulat General de Bouchir. ' This formula,as though it were a case of temporary holding-charge merely,was obviously chosen out of ecnsidsratiou for -ir ^ ^ will not return here. He has sold all his is certain that he household furniture and told me himself that out of consideration for his wife he would not come back to Eushire. But this is only a pretext circumstances rather point to this sudden relief having taker, place against his inclination. It is assumed,perhaps not without reasoniq (7) reason , tnat his political views and personal behaviour have recall. moved the ForM.^n Office i:: - He wished to eo on leave next spring and ( as one concludes from utterances of hady Cox) during his stay in Muscat received direct,at the beginning of October^,an intimation by telegram that he should take his furlough now. He tried to keep this a secret and also I hear endeavoured to arrange that the present Consul m Bahrein, Major Trevor,who represented him four years ago should act for him again, oir P.Cox will perhaps be called to administer one of the newly established Presidencies in India,which would mean pro motion for him. These posts carry very high salaries. Otherwise he will,he has hinted,resign. In any case when his furlough is up ae will proceed in the.first instance to Simla. He has no doubt regarded it as his lifework to bring | thS Wh0le ° f the Persian Gulf un &lt;Jer English rule &amp; governance. In this effort he has spent himself and his extraordinary capacity for work and^tenacity and experience gathered during 15 years j of activity in the Gulf havo on-led iia to ochiovo many a victory | 9D r ° Ute ‘ HiS COBpatrl0tS here thin * *he activities which await him j in India will afford him little satisfaction. Prom the German point of view his departure is to be hailed with joy. As shown by certain e^e which (some of them) are not settled yet, and as has often been ^ Peen expressed in despatches from tnis Consulate , his eyes^were riveted -m J * e riveted on the suppression of German( 8 ). German enterprises in the Gulf* It was not hostility to 'German spirit &amp; manners' (Deutschtum) jgg vrhich led him to this ; his personal bearing towards Germans resident in afforded Bushire no cause for complaint. But he feared every eco** nomical influence which Germany might obtain in the Gulf and he considered any means justified to prevent it. For he knevr that in the countries round about the Gulf,where there is no where a settled administration,economic interests cannot be maintained without political support and he sar his ambition of making the Gulf an exclusively English Sea endangered by every ship's load of barley and every ton of oxide exported by Germans. It is to be hoped that Mr-Lorimer will put an end to the anti-German activities of the British Consulate General as anticipated in the despatch of the Imperial Consul m Baghdad. But if so he would huVO to zz'ti those official:: of the Consulate General who have been trained by Cox change their whole attitude. The Consulate Mirza reports that a feeling of relief pervades the inhabitants of Bushire at the departure of Sir P.Cox. The people tell themselves ( with truth I believe ) that a great deal of trouble and annoyance,e.g.the presence of Indian troops in Bushire,the ruthless annihilation of Tang- ^ ntiWAR pre to be ascribed istani shipping and the destruction of DIBWAR to the retiring Consul General. Cox actually tried to stick 113 ,o.. into everythint - »» — such as Lingah &amp; Bunder over officials at the larger ports such ■, Cnmmercia’ 1 Consul Chick to j 16 Abbas, but also used to send Commerc - Khars(?) Khans of the Bushire hinterland and to the smaller ports to win over the more important persons there* I do not think this was done for purely commercial reasons* Mr.Lorimer has also taken over from Sir P.Cox charce of the Netherlands Consulate and the French Vice Consulate. A French Vice Consul who held these two posts formerly is said to have been reappointed and has been expected for a year and a day. But nobody here v novrs anythin; ^ ^ ^ i *» ■f' ^ ^ V* W U w arrival . Copy of this despatch is being sent to Minister Tehran and to Consul General Calcutta. Wassmuss. (Despatch from Baghdad Consul to Imperial Chancellor, copy to German Consul Bushire). No.J.GBl. ^ A. 6. Imperial Consulate, Baghdad,7/10/1?). I have the honour to report for the information of Y.E. that the British Consul General in this town,Mr.J.Gordon Lori - mer,has informed me that he has been chosen to succeed Sir P. Cox in Bushire and that he will proceed to his new post at the end of nexi^ month* You are aware Sir that the English Consul General in Bushire is at the same time Resident of the Anglo- Indian Government for the entire Persian Gulf. As this whole region is nowadays regarded by the English as de fa_ cto their protectorate,Sir Percy who had an experience of many years be hind him played such a decisive role there that he was known as ' the uncrowned king of the Gulf M • It is therefore a mark of extraordinary confidence in Mr.Lorimer*s capacity that this post which( 10 ) which really must be one of the most difficult under the Indian administration should have been entrusted to him. Unlike his military predecessors he comes from the I.C.S. and in addition to Hindustani understand:: Arabic,he zlzz s^aahs French and German well. In his political views he inclines to the Liberal party and in the domain of external politics holds views both moderate and free from Chauvinism. He may indeed be i termed a Germanophii. During his term of office here Lorimer maintained the most friendly relations both with myself and with the Chief Engineer of the Baghdad Railway,Meissner Pasha. In this connection I may draw attention to the fact that in March 1911 at the time of the most acute Morocco crisis I had the honour to lay before Y.E.and the Minister Lorimer*s invitation to discuss the Baghdad Railway and its junction with the Persian line to be built bv the English. At the present time Mr.Lorimer would probably not be a partisan of the great central line to be built by Russia through Persia but would rather favour a continuation of the railway in Luristan,for which ( as you are aware Sir) preliminary works have been taken in hand by Englisu engineers through South Porsds tc India rith nertham ;n - f nection with the Baghdad Railway. In any case it is to be ex- 1 pected that Lorimer will once for all put an end to the olo. 1 oolicy of the Anglo-Indian officials in the Guj„- * which I r^nerated into oetty intrigues against private German interests. At the same time as this transfer,that of the Russian Consul General Herr Orlow from Baghdad to Tabriz the capital of Azerbaijan was announced,where of course the Russians pla^ as great a part as the English in the Gulf. Mr Orlow,who formerlyformerly in Abyssinia and Macedonia,knows Turkish remarkably well and also speaks good German. He was even a member of the German club here. Being more intelligent and for that very reason less suspicious than the average Russian official he ought to adopt a perfectly imprtial attitude towards German interests in Azerbaijan,which is most important in view of the proposed establishment of a German Consulat de carrier© in Tabriz and of the Russo-German entente over the Baghdad Railway. If one may be permitted to draw a 'conclusion a posteriori' from the choice of individuals to Policy,it may be assumed that both English and Russians intend for the immediate future to pursue a very moderate and pacific policy in Persia,a thing which would at anyrate result 4&gt;n a strengthening of the so deeply prostrate lying Persian Government. Sd/- Hesse. NO.A.27. (Wassrmss to Berlin). Bushire 29/12/13. CONTENTS : March of the Gendarmerie to Bushire. Soldiers for local Governor. Collection of taxes in Dashti,Tangistan fee. Progress in Bushire* Change of English garrison. Turco—Persian Frontier Commission. Since the date of my last despatch on the situation in Pars (A*24 of the Shiraz Gendarmerie regiment has complete* the march to Bushire foreshadowed therein. On the road itself it encountered no opposition ; the Khans of Daliki and Borazjun ha* accepted the Governor General’s proposals re the number of riflemen for whom they are to draw pay monthly. NurNur Muhammad of Daliki maintained a threatening attitude to the very last ; and it goes without saying that all the Khans will throw off the obligation forced upon them of not collecting road tolls,the minute the position of the Gendarmerie becomes so weak that they can do so without fear of the consequences. For the loss they incur by cessation of the tolls is very great in spite of compensation paid for the riflemen.- On the other hand the rebellion of the Kalantar (burgomaster) of Kazerun present ed an unexpected difficulty ; he joined with a rebel called Ali Muhammad Kumariji,drove out the Gendarmerie post in Kazerun and plundered their barracks as soon as the force had continued its march to Bushire. The main fores ms therefore corbelled to return from Borazjun to Kazerun before reaching Bushire. Nev ertheless posts were established as far as Bushire and that part of the force not dispersed along the road (about 300 men) were successful in recapturing Kazerun even before the arrival of re inforcements of 300 men which the Governor General had sent from Shiraz under Daria Begi. The reason of the insurrection in Kaz - ©run has no^ yet been sufficiently explained for me to be able to report anything definite about it. The upshot of it was that a number of lesser rogues were hanged whilst the chief ringleaders went unpunished,and secondly that the Governor of Kazerun was deposed and replaced by Daria Begi. That will not profit the Persian Government much I fancy.- X have reported further on these events to Tehran. On the occasion of their first stay in Kazerun the Gendarmerie also captured a village in the Shapur district, about 11 miles from the town and occupied by Ali Muhammad Ku mariji. They did not horsvsr succcod in ca^turini himself, which would have been very desirable because he is said to have r personally3 -S ( 13 ) personally taken part in the attack on Consul Smart in December 1911 and by his capture the English Government would at length have had the satisfaction for which they long so ardently and which English papers of a certain tendency never weary of de - manding* The 200 foot and 100 horse which the Governor General sent to Kazerun under Daria Begi had been selected for the march before the above incidents occurred* They were destined for the Governor of Bushire who requires a force for tax-collecting pur poses in Dashti &amp; Dashtistan (see despatch A*24,page 6). Meanwhile the men have arrived here from Kazerun t the infantry by the way without arras* For in Shiraz they only had rifles lent them by the Gendarmerie and had to give them up again in Kazerun* Their uniform too was so defective that first of mmI h ad to be re clothed and armed with rifles which were lying forgotten in the Customs* The Governor has now entrusted a local chief named Jemal Khan with the collection of taxes in Dashti and placed at his dis - posal the force sent him from Shiraz. He would like to have a Swedish officer to train this force and has taken steps with that object : but I fear his wishes (which are entirely reasonable and deserving of recognition) will not be met. The remark in Despatch A.24 page 6,that the Governor had entrusted the collection of taxes in Dashti as well to Sair Khidhar Ahremi was a mistake on the part of the Consulate Mirza. The authorisation only referred to Tangistan itself and now Zair Khidhar as well as Jemal Khan will have tofangchis (rifle men) frora the Governor,because otherwise he would not be able to compel the small village^ headmen to pay their taxes. the taxes and for this In Geladar the Vice Governor of Bunder Abbas collects and for this purpose lac racsived a number of tofangc&amp;is froia here* For in that district also several places have refused to pay taxes of their own accord. In Laristan (vide Despatch No.A.Sd^p.p^Sjd) the Qawaic—ui— Mulk is said to have vanquished the Baharlu t but not yet to have taken possession of the town of Lar itself. One sees from the efforts which the Governor has to make in order to get in the taxes how far we are fron the attainment of law and order. But yet an attempt is being made to attain it. The Bushire Governor # Muwaqqar-ud-Douleh,who strikes one as being a sound and active man*is even planning actual improvements. He has taken in hand the building of rsafc J hac persuaded the sore well- to-do inhabitants of Bushire to order an electric lighting plant from Bombay which is also to be used for lighting the streets and he even intends to bore for water. The present water supply in the peninsula of Bushire is all more or less brackish so that Europ eans for example get their drinking water from the steamers which call here/. There is also some talk of motor transport between /— Bushire and Daliki at the foot of the mountains on the road to V Shiraz. I had the honour in my Ho.A.26 of the 19th instant to re - port on the change of the British Consul General. The English garrison of Bushire too has been changed*the 2nd Rajputs having recently been relieved by a detachment of 300 men of the 102nd r Grenadiers under fou^ English officers. This regiment has also furnished reliefs for other places*54 men for B/AbbaSjlO for Lingah 30 for Bahrein who are going as H consular guards***others for Mohammerah Basra and Baghdad. In Jask where formerly a larger de tachment was stationed san fron another repinent aro said to have been landed about which I have no definite information. The staffstaff with the larger half of the regiraent here is in Muscat. On the 12th instant the Russian S.S.'Queen Olga' came through herewith the Russian members of the lurco-Persian Frontier Commission on board. They were received in Mohammerah by the former Gerant of the Russian Consulate General at Bu - shire,who is associated with the Commission : they were also expecting to meet the English delegates there.

Hews only filtered through here very gra*ually an* the real causes underlying the trouble are not yet quite clear. It is an intrigue of such a complicated nature that one is always disappointed in the endeavour to get at the truth# At first it appeared that the Gendarmerie would accomplish their task of occupying the road this side of Kumarij as far as Bushire,without any fighting worth mention ing. The Khans along the road nowhere ventured to show open oppositioni i ( 16 ) oppositio®. And yet when I trawelled that way Nur Muhamnad Khan of Daliki,surrounded by his riflemen,was boasting that he would not allow the Gendarmerie to pass,and in Konartakhteh his bro - ther Hussein and in Jafarjin Uullah Ali Wais held the castles Konartekhteh I espied a regular watch set* The warlike encounter arrival in Kazerun had however caused these people to think bet ter of it and to fall in with the proposals of the Governor General who acted as mediator* topsy turvy.had possessed himself of the fruitful region of Sha- pur (near Kazerun) which belonged to Gorernraent he gave Ali Mu' ister and kept the rest for himself. Then came the attack on the English Consul Smart (December 1911) in which Ali Muhammad is said to have personally taken part. Meanwhile he acquired a following of some 100 tofangchis and his friendship with Mu - hammad Ali was gradually severed. The Kas|guli leader was even before the arrival of the Gendarmerie inclined to restore Shapur to Government,but stipulated that Ali Muhammad should be com - pellei to evacuate the villages which he himself had given him formerly. When X passed through Kazerun in the beginning of November the Kalantar of that town.Naser-ud-Divan.of whom more anon.was busy carrying out the wishes of the Government in Shiraz and heights,and even on the roof of the Telegraph rest house in which the Gendarmerie had with Ali Muhammad Kumariji after their hammad nj^ne of the 20 villages of which it is composed to admin'an* Baking 'war' on Ali MuhaKina*. The position is obscure , war should really hare been waged against Muhammad Ali Qash- quli,for after all the latter had not yet abandoned the dis trict belonging to Covsrnnent* She possession of the district consisted in collecting taxes from the villages in it and spending them on oneself. As Government wanted to exercise this right in the case of Shapur through their own representative,they commissioned the Kalantar of Kazerun to make himself master of the district. For the accomplishment of this task the Finance Administration had to give him the daily pay of 150 soldiers. Such forcibly raised troops amused his sowars. The worthy Naser-u*-Divan however took the fieli valiantly but only went some six miles from Kazerun where the village of Diriz offered him a pleasant halting place. There he encamped his tofangchis (riflemen). UUU reality rather than frightened the Qashquli leader surrounded by there were only 50 of them instead of 150,as he pocketed the odd hundred. He also levied a special contribution well. Then about the middle of November the Genthe English Consul who was rery keen on the attack on Consul Snart being avenged* A Swedish Officer who himself took part in the investment of the place told me that he thought it not impossible that certain tofangchis who were fighting on the side of the gendarmes had purposely facilitated Aii Mu hammad* s escape* ®he attack on the village was led by Major Lundberg the intendant officer who chanced to be in command of the cavalry advancing gainst _ . the village. The gendarmes are said to have fought and advanced (to the attack) quite well although they were fired on from behind cover. The artil lery too was active and seems to have made a great impression on the Khans* In consideration of the Kalantar*s additional force in KazeruS.the Gendarmerie only left some 30 men in Kaa- erun whilst the rest continued their march to capture of Tul-i-Kuhoi sufficient eclat to Ba * e the above mentioned Khans in Konartakhteh etc. abstain from opposine their further march.

But it is easy to understand that the Khans only gave up the idea of opposition under compulsion; for the loss of revenue which they suffered by the Gendarmerie taking over the road and by cessation of tolls,is very considerable* Nur Muhammad alone often made 200 Tomans in one day. The com - pensation which the Khans received in the form of pay for a given number of tofangchis (eight for each farsakh of the road in each raan ffi &gt; territory) is insignificant in comparison with these losses. n ntt a: ma/futauuuifnuitui/ In this way Major Uggla reached Borazjun without ob stacle an* was there receive* politely by Ghazanfer.

He thus found hinself in a dangerous trap between two passes ; moreover the force had no the right thing and retraced his footsteps to Daliki,strength ened the posts,threatened Nur Muhammad,and made him understand that the Gendarmerie trould inaeliatel^ return if he undertook anything against them. Then the gendarmes had to ascend the toilsome passes once more which extraordinary rains had made impracticable for a whole day,and as the men thought this march ing and counter-marching was flight before the enemy their war like spirit was much depressed. After the posts had been rein- forced, only about 200 men remained to return to Kazerun. As Pousette on his return to Daliki had 6 one on to Bushire for money and supplies,Major Bundbere bad only Killander (who commanded the artillery) with him. Later when he came to Bu - ahire after the capture of Bushire to straighten out his de - layed intendant business he gave me an exact and very interest ing description of events , to repeat which in detail would take me too far afield. X beg leave to select the following points supplies with it but was expecting same from Bushire. He did only. of the enemy The Tang-i-Turkan had apparently fallen into the hands enemy in consequence of treachery on the part of the at the exit from the pass on the Kaaerun side. He had there to go round the pass over pathless heights. During this man oeuvre the two machine guns were pulled up on the rocks and the Kazerun side. He had therefore oeuvre the b, their aid the enemy was driven out of his protected positi on,Major Lundberg overwhelming him with a hail of bullets at driven out of his protected positi- 2500 yards. ®be coup de grace was administered by a gendarme, aa 2urk from the north,who pressed forward into the enemy's f position with a sackful of bombs under cower of the machine guns. So the pass was taken and the next day they hurried on to the neighbourhood of Kazerun* Here the artillery did good service by taking a tower. It is to be noted that it consisted of two old fashioned Austrian guns which according to Major Lundberg could only get off one shot every half hour. The two modern Schneiders in Shirs.5 had boon delightfully loft behind as only 30 shells were ready for them l The capture of the tower took place after five shots had been fired,and nine dead were found. In the Tang-i-Turkan seven dead were found. One of these had no less than 9 machine gun shots in his breast According to Major Lundberg*s account the situation on the morning of the third day was very critical. The 200 gendarmes had to take Kazerun and in order to do this had to make themselves masters of the palm and orange groves in front of the town,surrounded by walls and in the hands of the enemy. The ground in front is open and the gendarmes showed not the slightest desire to take the place by storm. There was almost a mutiny and I do not doubt for a moment the truth of what Major Lundberg told me without the least boasting,namely that he alone saved the situation by charging first to the attack with a cheer. At first only a few joined in,but the cheering gave the others courage and so Kazerunis got alarmed uni they reached the gardens. Then the nant out five Ssyyids '.of rhich they hare a treat nuaber in Kazerun) to discuss terns of surrender Internediary between the two parties was the l.E.E.D.sifnaller an Armenian named Uackertieh who has extraordinary political influence in Kazerun and has played am important part in all thatthat has happened there* The five Seyyids had to sign a written doeuraent promising that whatever had been plundered should be restored in return for which the town was to remain unmolested. h There were several thousand tomans worth of stores in the town, ammunition,wheat etc* Apparently the whole population including women and children had taken part in the plundering of the barracks* It is difficult to see why the Gendarmerie did not now capture the fortified house of Naser-ud-Divan in which Ali Muhammad is said to have been. But evidently Mackertich,who was very friendly with the Kalantar,helped him out of the scrape and besides,the day after the storming of the town Major Uggla ^ entered Kazerun in consequence of a telegram received in Bu - shire from Mukhber-tts-SulUnsh iskin; hin to uniertahs nothing against Kazerun until the arrival of Daria Begi whom he had sent with 300 men to support the Gendarmerie* No doubt at the request of the Governor General,no steps were taken aeainst Kaser-ud- Divan and at the sane time All Muhammad was saved and took the opportunity some days later to flee into the hills from whence he now perpetrates all manner of wickedness. For safety sake 1 Naser-ud-Divan took sanctuary in the telfeeraph office. Daria Beei le* a most wretched existence durine the summer in Shiraz. His salary as commander of the Shiraz troops of which there are practically none,was I believe 90 toman.*. Out of this he had to maintain his family in *«*ran and pay his servants. X met him only once,at the house of the En £ lish Consul whom he had obviously been be«in 6 to do somethins for him. From former despatches you know Sir what sort of man the Daria Begi3b (Z*) Daria Begi is* Ihe Gorernor who sueeee^ed him in Bushire de clared plainly that Daria Begi often got the Persian Govt, into difficulties on purpose t so as to be entrusted with their removal and thereby fish in troubled waters. He,the Governor, had therefore declined to accept Daria Begi as Officer Com - manding the force sent to collect the taxes in Dashti and Dashtistan. These are the people referred to as the 300 men brought by Daria Beji to Tc-scrun T*^c 23/13/13). Major Lundberg told me that Daria Begi arrived in the vicinity of Kazerun a few days before he himself,but of course had no idea of attaekine the town but was already ar- ranjine thinea quite nicely when Lundbefe upset his calculat ions by capturine the town. Thanks however to the intrieues which ensued he has recovered his expenses : he is now Gov - ernor of Kaserun and the former Governor,Maaher-ud-Dowleh,has been deposed.

One thing however deserves to be emphasised : those who derive profit from insecurity on the caravan road are naturally eager to hamper the work of the Gendarmerie. The Kalantar was one of those persons for he had for weeks waged war against Ali Muhammad to the great advantage of his own pocket. Another to a certain extent was Mackertich. This man owns a caravan of 30 mules for which thanks to his influ - ence with the Khans (unnecessary here to go into reasons) he never needs pay tolls on the road. He therefore used to charge the usual rates of hire which were very much enhanced by reason of road tolls,without having himself to pay the latter. Un fortunately this interest in the unsafety of the road appar - ently extended to at least one Persian Gendarmerie officer. The head of the post in Diriz f a Kurd,undoubtedly went over to one Jaafar Khan,adopted a very dubious attitude. At the time of my passing through Kazerun I heard that he only allowed caravans from a given district to pass after paying ransom, on account of his partisanship aeainst a certain Khan. In be disarmed and his hcuss disfortified. The Governor opposition to the enemy men are for the most pa the Swedish officers - we wanted, to fieht but the Khan would not let us' •3^ (25) I must also neatioR the opinion which reaches me from Shi raz that the Gendarmerie roused the Kalantar and people of Kazerun to rebellion by all manner of insubordination and des potism. Yet I hare heard nothing to prove this 2 it merely shows that unfortunately people still hate having a Gendarmerie under European officers* I do not doubt that small excesses have taken place and still do take place* Therefore it is ad visable that a Swedish officer should travel up and down H the road as often as possible and himself see justice done* The result of the march of the Gendarmerie is therefore as follows :- The road from Shiraz to Bushire has been taken over by the Gendarmerie in its western portion and that with - out it having been necessary to fight the Khans by the way. As a concession to the latter — for the present it seems to be a permanent one — the Government has to pay Nur Muhammad Khan of Daliki 270 Tomane monthly for 40 tofangchis,Ghazanfer 600 Iss (partly for collecting the taxes),Hussein Khan of Ahmedi 270 Ts* for 40 tofangchis,and a tl)U Hi corresponding sum to the Kedkhuda of Chogadak for 11 tofangchis* Ho one therefore can say that the Persian Govt*is doing the restoration of se curity on the caravan road on the cheap 2 on the contrary it may be asked whether security could not be restored without such a heavy cost to the State* On the other hand the expedition did HOI result in the capture of Ali Muhammad. It may be assumed however that the villages held by him have reverted to Government,unless fresh disturbances upset things again. Finally another result of the expedition has been that Muhammad Ali Qashquli has given back unconditionally the villages in Shapur which he himself had taken possession of*(26) 3? Proa here it nvist be retarded as a mistake that the in - surreetion of Naser“Ud~Diran went unpunishdd. I learnt a few days h / ago that Daria Begi visited him in the telegrap/ office and gave him back his house on condition that the towers were demolished.

Only on my return from Shiraz was I able to ascertain that this is one of the islands which the natives call Salaraah but which the English have on account of their shape named The Quoins ('cuneiform') by which name th*y are often mark ed on the map. The 'Times of India' described the light house in N 0 .53 dated 31/12/13 and added :- ' The lack of lights and buoys in the Persian Gulf has long been a source of complaint,but a few years ago the British Admiralty mad# a start towards repairing these omissions.

He received no reply fro» lehran and Sir P.Cox told him the Persian Govt. tl vould only borrow the noney from England so he need no/ trouble about it s England would build the lighthouse herself. The lighthouse was then erected on I.Tanb. In this connection I heard from the Governor that $he island of Tanb,which in his opinion is certainly a Persian island,is not recognised as such by the English. Sobo years ago a Belgian Customs director in Lingah for some reason or other hoisted the Persian flag on the island,whereupon orders came from Tehran (at the request of the English) to take the flag away again. The English claim - if I mistake not - that the island belongs to the Shaikh of Shargah • The Governor also told Be that when the two buoys in the roadstead of Eushirs ?sr3 baih; rsplaced by bsacon buoys he suggested to the British Consul General that the Persian Govt.should bear the cost of the establishment and maintenance of the buoys. Sir P.Cox however declined the offer . In this connection I may aention that with regard to Bahrein there is a iUUUU difference of procedure be - tween two different Persian departments. The Custons is cbm- oelled by the force of facts to treat Bahrein as a foreign country,as Persia cannot think of sending her own Customs of ficials to the island. The passport administration.which is run by the Karguaar‘3 office,follows the Persian Govt, in re garding Bahrein as still belonging to Persia. Persians trav elling to Bahrein need no foreign passport but receive a 'tezkerah' like those given for travel in the interior or from one port to another. Until a short time ago a Persian mer - chant domiciled in Bahrein used to issue passes to his com- patriots(29) ¥ patriots travelling tc ? really came from Bahrein* But Sir Percy Cox when visiting Bahrein shortly before his departure summoned this merchant before him and for bade him to affix his visa in future to travelling papers.Since then Persian subjects in Bahrein have had to apply to the English asked the Governor the reason for this change but was only able to learn that he had no information on the subject. It had therefore not been arranged with the knowledge of the Persian Government. But the Governor stated that as far as he knew no Persian merchant in Bahrein had been authorised to visa travel ling papers issued by Persian authorities. A short time ago the French armoured cruiser Jeanne d*Arc which is used as cadet training ship visited Muscat,Bunder Abbas and Lingah. She did not penetrate further into the Gulf , pre - sumably out of consideration for English wishes. The English Commission for surveying the Mohammerah - Khorremabad Railway,with which are associated two Belgians as representatives of the Persian Govt.,has had to break off its labours in Dizful owing to the hostile attitude of the Sagwand Lurs. An attack is said to have been made in which one Persian servant was wounded. According to another version the expedition never left Dizful,anticipating opposition.

Jemal Khan only left Bushire a few days ago with 100 so - wars,one gun and servants. (A.27,20/12/13,p.3). A Swedish Doctor for the Gendarmerie in Shiraz left Eur ope a short time ago. The English doctor who has hitherto looked after the Gendarmerie is said to believe that he will keep his c position and that the new-Vomer will be subordinate to him. In view of the formation of an independent regiment under the American Col.Merrill the need of another doctor in Shiraz win probably arise. A Belgian is said to have been thought of in this connection (ef.A.24 pp 12-13 and C.38 of 30/9/13). The losses sustained by the Gendarmerie in Kazerun through the plundering of the barracks etc: amount to 28,000 Tomans Cover £ 5 f 000). But Naser-ud-Divan remains unpunished.

Two gendarmes are said to But(32) But probably the Officer eomraanding the regiment at that time abstained at the request of the Gorernor General of Pars from talcing any action against him* Daria Begi let the Kalantar come into the town again - they name the sura which he received for this - and the other rebel Ali Muhararaad Kuraariji from his hiding places in the hills did all manner of wickedness* Last month a Swedish Officer Major Ohlsen was sent openly from Shiraz to Kazerun with 200 gendarmes with instructions to take the rebels pris - oner. Unfortunately this brave Officer lost his life at the very beginning of the battle,receiving a bullet in the head while try ing to blow up the gate of Naser-ud-Dican*s fortified house. His wife who was the only European in Kazerun thereupon conducted the defence of the Gendarmerie barracks with great spirit. The gen - r- darraea had fled when ??ajcr Chlsen ; the rabelc succsoisd in l possessing themselves of his body which they threw into a well. The exact number of gendarmes who were in Kazerun at the time is unknown to me - anyhow over 200. But Naser-ud-Divan had the whole town on his side* So that it is not surprising that the force had to defend itself in the barracks and in a garden outside the town which they also occupied* A Swedish officer came from Shiraz to relieve the garrison with BOO men and two machine guns and also the American Colonel Merrill, with 200 of the men under his command. The Swedish Officer here who is in charge of the Bushire-Shiraz road also hurried to the spot with some 90 sowars which he took off the road* But for 5 days and especially for 5 long nights (during which attacks continued) the troops there had to hold out against Naser-ud-Diwan's tofangchis. Then the relieving force succeeded after strenuous fighting in making themselves masters of the town and (most important) of Naser-ud-Divan*s fortified house(33) house. But he himself an* also Ali Muhammad (who was in the town) again found means to escape to the neighbouring hills. The number of gendarmerie casualties is giren as 50 or 60. On the other side 150 tofangchis are said to hare fallen. Also many in habitants of Kazerun were killed in the fighting. The Governor Daria Begi,the merchants and Seyyids of Kazerun were all immediately taken prisoner because they were all suspected of having assisted Wite Naser-ud-Divan. Daria Begi was conveyed to Shiraz under gendarmerio escort, 'ho serchants oni Sayylds have meantime been released from confinement. The merchants of Bushire had interceded for them telegraphically. The gendarmes were permitted to plunder the town for two whole days. The Swedish Officers and the Gendarmerie generally will probably be reproached bitterly for this by their enemies. Possibly serious complications will arise out of it. But I doubt whether the Swedish Officers had their men sufficiently in hand to prevent their plundering. 1 leart from the Officer who returned to Bushire from Kazerun that his men had fought very well. He was obviously not so pleased with the others but he would not tell me any more. He defended the plundering of the town by point ing out that the whole town had taken part in the fight. In the same way the inhabitants are said to have plundered the Gendarmerie barracks in November last year. These circumstances and the custom of the country will perhaps not be sufficiently taken into con sideration when the sack of Kazerun is being judged outside Per Col.Merrill has been appointed Military Governor of Kazer un. He is said to be a very energetic man* Naser-ud-Divan was a great enemy of the Qashquli.

BUSHIRE 16/3/14 * CONTENTS : Conflicts between administrative departments in Shiraz * News has reached Bushire from Shiraz pointing to much strife between the various administrative departments there. As I have myself received no reports on the subject from Shiraz I can say nothing definite* About a fortnight ago the rumour was spread abroad here that the Belgian Finance Agent in Shiraz,l4r Stas,had been fired on,but not wounded* As I have maintained good relations with Stas who often gave me news I congratulated him by telegraph on his escape. He replied as follows by telegram through the Customs Director here 2- He could only assume that an attack on him was intended. One evening ho wos 2 , gusct zt Col.Merrill* s house. By chance one of the latter*S servants was sent to Stas* house* A shot(35) shot was then fire* at this servant whilst Stas hieself was in Merrill*s house* The servant even maintains that he saw men lying in wait on the road whiah Mr.Stas ha* to take to return to his house. All this was connected (in men’s minds) withrf a meas ure taken by the financial authorities by which a new tax on landed proprietors was introduced. Whether this really was the case I do not know^o far no one has boon ablo to toll me the nature of this tax. Th e landed proprietors objected to the tax,being instigated thereto by a respected grandee of the name of Nasir ui Mulk. Thereupon Stas apparently obtained from Tehran direct (against the wish of the Governor General|Mukhbir-us- Sultaneh) an order for Nasir’s banishment from Shiraz. The commandant of the Shiraz Gendarmerie Regiment even instructed a Swedish officer to capture Nasir-ul-Mulk who was then brought to Bushire under Gendarmerie escort,whence he took ship the day before yesterday for Basra &amp; Kerbela. The younger Swedish Officers are discontented at receiving an order of this nature. The Governor General violently opposed the banishment of Rasir ul Muik and apparently demanded Stas’s dismissal,saying that otherwise he himself would resign. Thereupon he is said to have received ^ from Tehran a reply to the effect that M.Stas had acted entirely in accordance with his instructions and that he would not be dismissed. Neither was the Governor General’s resig nation accepted, ’'he** s— tio lattsr has already left the town. The position of the Controller of Finances in Shiraz is a very difficult one. He displeases either the English Consul or the Governor General or the Gendarmerie. Against the latter Mr Stas last summer showed considerable asperity,because in his opin ion their accounts arrangements were not in order and he had a lot of bother in that connection. M.Stas is not a strong man. It isis affirmed that he is led by the nose by one of his sub - ordinates,one Mustafa Khan,and that the latter is a bad in triguer, This is the rerdiet of the Governor of Bushire and a „ even of Stas* own countryman the local Director of Customs, Stas on the other hand maintains that Mustafa Khan is attack ed on every side merely because of his energetic proceedings. He is said to be the only incorruptible Persian in Shiraz, To me personally Mustafa Khan has often done little favours but I can give no proper opinion of him* But I think I may safely state that he tries to eive an unfavourable opinion of the Gendarmerie, Wassmuss, (Wassmuss to Berlin), Ho,A,&amp;, COHTEHTS : Survey of the Mohamroerah- Khorremabad Railway, RHSHTFiF. 20/3/191 A.

But oaly two days later the Kazerun merchants instructed their business friends here by telegraph to cease forwarding as the road was unsafe. It is now said that Na - ser-ud-Divan collected 800 tofangchis,mostly people from Kazerun itself,and came from the hills to near the town»£here upon the Gendarmerie attacked and drove him back to the hills but they themselves had to retire into the town. Yesterday or the day before c bittls Is sail to have toon fought in the Tang-t-Turkan this side of Kazerun. Prom the commencement of disturbances the chief com mand of the Gendarmerie in Kaaerun was handed over by the £ Officer COBRanding to Col.Merrill,as I now learn from Shi - raz. He himself evidently abides by the axiom that he came to Persia not to fight but to train the Gendarmerie. When the Governor General addressed him on the subject of setting free the Daria Begi,he is said to have answered that events in Kazerun did not concern him as the task of the Gendarmerie was only to protect the road. It is to be foreseen that with out European leadership the gendarmes will gain no decisive victories itlii&amp;i over their countrymen. What Col.Merrill will accomplish in Kazerun under th«se circumstances remains to be seen. Insecurity seems to have spread so far that a •araranserai near Kaaerun i» vrhick were £bois beloneing to Europea* firns.and part of a post coiaing from Shiraz have beer, looted, t thersfcrs fiaS ayself obliged as before to send my 3C e hran post via Berlin. The plundering of Kazerun by the Gendarmerie has given rise to many telegrams from the merchants of Bushire, the Clergy and the Governor to the Governor General and pristhood of Shiraz and Col.Merrill. She Governor General passed on the complaint to the Minister of the Interior.(39) The Kazerun Mullahs who were taken prisoner even aAdresset the Regent and are said to have received an ambiguous reply. Col.Merrill in replying to the Bushire Governor declared that most of the looting was over before his arrival. - English firms have reported to the British Consul General that goods to the value of £ 30,000 were in Kazerun or on the road. Also Russian and German goods are said to be in Kazerun. I learn subsequently that the 300 Indian troops which are here in Bushire have been held in readiness to march in case it was necessary to send them to Kazerun. Very wisely,they were not despatched : they could not have done much there and in ease of failure the British Govt.would have been compelled to take measures not foreseen in their present policy. The new Acting British Consul General Major Knox whose appointment I ha* the honour to report in my A.3 of 23/2/1* then made a round tour in the cruiser 'Fox' to the various Gulf ports. The reason for this journey was no doubt an inci dent which occurred in Um-el-Gowein a small port on the pirate coast nearly opposite Lingah,about which the following is known to me. Many months ago a quarrel arose between the Shaikh of that place and his nephew over the watering of gar dens, in the course of which the Shaikh had his nephew basti nadoed. The latter revenged himself by shooting the Shaikh f s steward whereupon the Shaikh,after the murderer had fled, banished his whole family from Um-el-Gobwein and seized their Copy to Tehran No.A.7.

There - upon the Agent went on the 'Odin' (which happened to be on the Pirate Coast) to the island of Farur where he reported to Major -nox on the 'To::' the failure of the noiotiations. Thereupon both gunboats proceeded to Um-el-Gobwein and as the Shaikh still refused to take action as required by the English the 'Fox' witha few shots knocked down the Shaikh*s mud castle I killing MM nine persons. Then the Shaikh submitted and had, it is said,to pay Rs.25 t 000* - The modern cruiser 'Dartmouth' which recently made her appearance in the Gulf,also visited Um-el-Gobwein a few days later,after the matter had been set tled. Originally England only claimed,in her treaties with the Trucial Chiefs,to settle disputes at sea between them. The above ease shows that she also claims the office of Empire on dry land* It does not appear that she had any moral right to interfere in the above case* Ob the contrary Abdul Latif is reproached with wanting to pocket the half of the Rs* 10,000 originally claimed. This is the same consular agent of whom Wfinckhaus Lingah complain that he has interfered to their prejudice ^ e in several debt affairs of their Oman &amp; pir— ate coast broker. (See my despatch A.31 of 9/9/13). In this case nothing can be done without an investigation on the spot and it has been shown that even so a satisfactory result could not be expected owine to the difficulty of provineS 4- (41) proving anything against the Agent. In the above ease it is noteworthy how energetically the English support their Agent. I an surprised that this man,representing as he does the English,does not meet with any special hostility on the part of the Arabs. It is obvi ous that the English cannot make many friends among the Arabs by knocking down their mud castles.

According to a statement of the Government the cost of suppress ing arms trade is not exclusively borne by India. the checking of arms traffic in Muscat not everything has been done f Jibuti being the great central point for arras traffic in the whole of East Africa and Muscat also having been provided from thence. Prom that place arms were put into the hands of the natives from the Sudan to German East Africa. How far this is true in the case of East Africa I cannot say i as for this con - sular district it has been reliably reported that weapons from Jibuti were brought to places in the Gulf across Arabia. The English papers therefore demand that the Anglo-Prench entente re arms traffic whereby binds herself to suppress im port of arms from Gibraltar to Morocco shall also include Jibuti. vans which formerly trafficked between the Indian N.W.Frontier and the Mekran coast opposite Muscat for purposes of gun running have ceased. This success we may grant to English efforts ; the delivery of firearms to Oriental or African uneducated peoples should re« ive universal condemnation. But when in the English press (even before the import was allowed at all) one continu - ally read a propos of the arms traffic in Muscat of 'illicit trade','contraband','offenders' and other strong expressions of moral indignation that/was great hypocrisy. In other places Eng land is not so zealous about the suppression of the arms traffic. A few days ago Rs.9,000 worth of pistols were snuggled from Ko - welt to Rudhilleh northwards of Bushire. But these arms are principally for the Shaikh himself and the tribes in the hinter land.

Here conflicts between the various village headmen have not yet ceased* The force despatchedby the governor nnder Jemal Khan cost more than it brought in and it w&amp;b at length found necessary to send back a^hin the sold~ iers and sowars sent hither from Shiraz, who are said to have oppressed the people in every possible way. Hitherjf© some 50.000 krans have come in from B&amp;shti. But the Customs Director here to whom financial matters were entirely handed ever some time ago hopes to get in even the Dashti taxes after the date harvest* These come to 103.000 krans. The Persian Govt f s entire lack of money is felt even here. After much fruitless telegraphing the Controller of Finances re cently got 100.000 krans sanctioned for the Gendarmerie. The commandant of the Shiraz regiment had threatened that he would withdraw his men from the caravan road unless the food end fodder most urgently required 7/ere provided within 48 hours. But t as mentioned above,the Government # ie many months in arrears wlth^ payment of sums promised to the Khans along the road. S© far this has not been followed by a revival of road tolls. On the con - trary,with the exception of the robbery of a caravan of 46 moles near Kazerun,the work of Kazerun rebels in May,traffic has con tinued without interruption. But it depends entirely on the lo * e&amp;l powers whether this state of things continues. An attempt is being made to supply the lack of money for municipal needs by instituting new taxes. For example in Bushire sailing boats and other means of transport both wheeled and pack coming from outside into Bushire are to be taxed. Negotiations are in progress aboi^t this,to which the Governor has invited both the Controller of Finances and the British Consul General.

To under - stand this requires a more thorough knowledge of local conditions and events than is attainable here. It struck me that even judici ous Persians in Bushire always defended fi^oer ud Bivan whom discussing present state of unrest,so perhaps he really has been ^ the victim of circumstances* On the other hand I am convinced that the Gendarmerie,at anyrate as far as the Swedish Officers are concerned,have acted extremely prudently in the matter and have in no way provoked hostilities as the English papers would have us believe* As for the plundering (of Kazerun) Major Lundberg,who now oommands the Gendarmerie there,wrete me that the Bnglish Con sul in Shiraz himself consented to it in conversation with Col. Merrill,only (he said) the plunderers must bo kept in hand* } His letter makes it clear that the Swedish Officers were not at all in a position to check the looting,in which not only gendarmes but also soldiers from Shiraz of Merrill # s and the 'auxiliary* 'troops* of the Gendarmerie from the Khans of the neighbourhood, had taken part* - Characteristic is the attitude of the Qashqai Chiefs who at the request of the Government sent sowars to Kamerun to assist the ^Gendarmerie but secretly gave Kaser-ud-Div&amp;n the means of escaping pursuit* CertainCertain English papers cannot refrain from maliciously criticising the activities of the Gendarmerie frem time to time and that the Swedish Officers he replaced by Knglish Officers with Indian experience.

SAZEROi 13/4/14 • Ze The Qeraan Consulate at Bushire, B»ar Mr» 1 »ii in if Here is the story ef recent events at Kaaerun j After the first revolt at Kazerun peace reigned for a season after we had conquered the town (1/12/1913). This time we acted very leniently. Three of the ringleaders,but not the most important,were hanged. The real chief,though probably not the prime,author of the rebellion,Baser ud Divan,'Kalantar' of the town,was even allowed to resume his former rights that is to say to reoccupy his fortress with his army of 'tefangchis* , this was mistaken kindness especially as Dggla perceiving the necessity of ridding himself of Baser ud Divan ordered Major Ohlson to ar rest him. Baser ud Divan was in entire ignorance of this decis ion, which of course superseded the assurances of safety formerly given him by Uggla,but like a prudent man he always stood on his iof—tw&gt;» Maj.Ohlson,understanding that a man in his fortress does not willingly suffer himself to be captured.made a plan for demolishing a wall of the fortress first of all and then rushing to the assault with some ef his gendarmes. This plan,discovered MAng the papers Ohlson left behind him,was elaborated with great care. A held plan hut well calculated te succeed, Ohlson was a brass soldier a»d at the same time a wise sms. On the night of the 25/26 February ho surrounded the fortress and with 20 gendarmes Mitered the girdle of forts and approachedwarn well nigh oghtturML whan at length on Oar ammunition approached the main building. At sunrise as he was about to place the mine against the wall a sentinel discovered and fired on him. The Chief haring fallen,the gendarmes fled in panic. This at tach,well thought out in advance but so unsuccessful,resulted ia A fresh revolt against the Gendarmerie in Kaserun. Nearly everybody in the town was armed,and within a few fcours after Ohlson's death the inhabitants had mounted their roofs and from there commenced firing on the Gendarmerie in tne barracks and in the garden of Bagb-i-Masar. The native officers then caw* to Madame Ohlson in great disorder to ask for instructions. It is a matter of experience, confirmed again and again,that our native officers absolutely require a European leader. Madame Ohlaon,equal to the situation, gave the first orders nsoessary fsr ths defence. But it is doubtful whether she could have kept up her own courage and that of the gendarmes if on the second day the brave Frenchman Mens. Bimbaud (instructor of the 'army* in Shiras) had net come to her assistance. Rimbaud had come to Kazorun on his way to Bushire, but on hearing that the Gendarmerie were in a tight plane he hastened to the barracks and like a true Frenchman offered Madame Ofolhi* servioee 'to the aesth** The enemy had surrounded the barracks and ths Bsgh-i- Nazar. The Gendarmerie,thus besieged,were hard pressed. When previsions began to run short timbaud.with the gendarmes,made a sortie,swept the surrounding country and brought in victual. It was high time. The enemy had dug a subterranean ehannel reaching nearly to the wall of eur barracks. Ths attempt,now discovered,was averted by a counter mine.the fifth day help arrived* Captain Lundberg, collecting the cavalry along the read, had •flown 11 fro® Bn ah ire to Kazeran where he arrived on the evening of the End March* Another relief oorpa under the command of Killander which left Shiraz, with two mac - bine guns and much Ammunition, had alreads? arrived at Pul-i-Abgineh only 8 miles from the town,but remained there inactive* Captain Lundberg behaved like a brave soldier* His squad ron was in action the moment it arrived* On the morning of the “TV B«xt flay Lundberg attacked,directing his squadro* on the hill* t 0 the north so as to oat off the eeoay's retreat. Perhaps he weuld have succeeded in this if the corps at Abgineh • f.d come to his assistance,but the latter continued to hang fire, lev Lund - berg was repuleed by the enemy,who was far wperior te him in numbers. Later en in the same day,3/3,the above mentioned oops slunk into the tewn from Pul-i-Abgineh. The rebels,probably frightened by Captain Lundberg's determined attack,fled the next night. On 4/5 the Ameriea* Merrill arrived in Kaaerun with a contingent ef 'the army i* Pars*, At this point a fatal mistake was made. The enemy had left the team with their families and furniture. That waa pre - cisely the moment,when tfeey were encumbered with their heavy baggage,for the Government troops te have puraued them. laatead ef which,the treopa stayed in the town te loot. Also our friends the Xalantara ef the neighbouring villages of Kaloni,Ptl—i— We may suppose that there were great riches in the basar and in the houeee of the larger merchants. Everything waa taken. Abgineh,Debris Ac.,who fail us enough in^trouble.but ne ver ea am —aealin like the present , flocked to the pillage.Ml (59) The town had certainly deserved severe punishment* Bet there was no reason far this loot. Compensation should have been OBMted in the shape of a fine extraordinary,taken by force if necessary, but only after due taxation. O'Connor cannot pretest against the looting itself be cause in the presence of Morrill who is his obedient general (?'led captain'??) he had consented to it in advance. But now he MHMtah that we did not control the looting. Vhat Ones he assn by that 1 He must understand that a pillage carried out by heterogeneous crowds like gendarmes with some discipline,army soldiers with less discipline,and tofangohie with no discipline at all, cannot he interfered with. Perhaps he mans to conceal hie own fault in having incited this deplorable looting t My role in this ploy only commenced after the above mentioned events. I was on my way to Tehran when,at Abadeh,! got the news on the 28th Feb.of Ohlson's death. After obtaining per mission to return I wont at full speed to Kazerun where I arrived 5/3. During that same day the body of Ohlson was found in a well. The head was pierced a little above the ears by a bullet. The body «se entire. It is evident then that this brave man fell dead at the first shot. On 6/3 X escorted Madame Ohlson from Kanerun to Shiran. Merrill A Killander remained in the town. After seme days Cggla recalled Kill ander,and Morrill also returned to Shiraz. I was seat hare to replace them. My task has been twofold,to reassure the terrified in - habitants and to protect the town and the road from rebels. This isis not yet accomplished* In the mountains where the rebels are they lie in wait for caravans which pass along the road beneath then and for flocks in the field© to steal them,always by force of arms* They have spies everywhere who spy out my motions and my plans* In this way they have escapd all my attempts to cap - /%. tar* the*. My f»r*e not being strong enough te surround and search huge Hiountains,we asked Solat f4 t ^ r * hundreds of hi* tofangohis. The sly fellow immediately granted eur request and |A*Ni the tribes ef the Qaohquli and asrsimeidan at my disposal, tut at the same time he gare indications to Basar-ud- whan Bivan and *li Muhammad ho* to escape. Shorn tflM I tried to surround a chain of mountains the nomads associated with me sent word to tho brigands and tbs latter,warned in this way of the danger,naturally escaped. After a few vain attempts X dis - missed the nomads. Their want of goodwill is sasy te understand. It is to tho interest ef Solat and of all tho other ehiefa that Maser~ud~Divan sad his brigands should stay in the mount - ains. So long as they stay there tho Gendarmerie are obliged to occupy thornstives with them and leave the nomads in peace. For this reason the nomad chiefs hindered Maaor-ud-Divan's acceptance of our UMAM to him that he might emigrate freely to Kerb el a. In tho same interest are united the Kalaatars ef the villagas - L ' * _ along the road, Hussein B*g,Hur Muhammad BUM and Shasanfar-es- * Sultaneh,whe secretly furnish Baser-ud-Difkn with eartridges and ether stores. At present Maser-ud-Bivan,surrounded by some 50 tofangchis,is probably to ha found alternatively in tho mount of Agai near Kumarij and Gisakhun near Daliki. All Muhammad has |sd recourse to tho Qoohqwll tribe (with Muhammad All Khan)*The ether tofangafcia of Haaer-ud-DiraB are ssat-bured ia pursuit of their livelihood,but can easily he collected togther in case ef seed. Xt is obvious to ee,although Uggla sill not reoegniae it, that in order to deprive the brigands ef support we shall haws to bloeh the Qaahqulia* seoess to Shahpur and denolish the fertreases ef Me—In Beg, »ur Muhamad Khan aad the root.

The chief Shaikh of the Uentefik tribes,Ajaci A1 Sadmn t wko mas defeated near Basra, is again encamped vitha detachment of several hundred men between Zobeir and Basra, Some ten days ago the Consul© of Great Britain,Russia and Persia received letters signed apparently by Ajami,in which | he imfermed them that he intended to attack Basra in a few days* time and begged them therefore to take steps for conveying all Buropeans to a plaee of safety when the fighting began,otherwise he could not accept respons5.bility for their lives and property. Our own representative,Herr Gloye,and other well informed persons are however of the opinion that these litters *r# fsrgeries get up by Seyyid Talib* His idea probably is to bring up English men~ofi - war on which he can take refuge in ease ef need. It the same time it is reported that Ajaai has set in motion the Shaikh of the southern Beni Lam,the well known robber Ganban # who is also at enmity with the Turkish Govt*,against the Shaikh of Mohammerah in order to prevent the latter from coming to the assistance of Seyyid Talib with his men in case of need. In the Persian town of Ahwe* great^/ SMftiWnt is said to have been stirred up by this and the whole tom is seething with armed Arabs emouiimg war dances. Similar reports of disturbances come from Gurma and the Gharaf, Meanwhile the Government has made a treaty with •tfr Abdul date ibn 8mi through Ssyyid Talib as intsvmsdiary, the snly advantage to the Bfcir being that he assumes the title of(«3) a Wall and C~in~C af Najd, otherwise renaining in undisturbed possession ef the Oulf provinces which he has stolen. It is well known that the Minister for War,Bnver,has congratulated Ibn Sand on his MW honour in a telegram in which he exhorts the Etair to serve religion and the State. In connection with these proceedings a paper recently founded by Seyyid Talib in Baghdad called Bn Haiwadir ('anecdotes') writes a fulsose article in which Seyyid Talib is continually referred to as HUB KL IRBQ.the Protector of Iraq. ftfWfM - te g these sweats with those of Te^n,Assyria (?) and Bejan,we see that Turkish rule in Arabia is rapidly falling to pieces and being replaced by a leose confederation ef Arab wasaal states all more er less under English influence. As for the im portant harbour of Basra and for Iraq.Soyyid Talib is quite openly working for tho suzerainty of thaw. Whil st those important events are happening it is a witter ef very great regret that the Imperial German Government eaanet decide aa the establishment ef a regular Consulate in Basra, the future terminus ef the Baghdad Railway,especially as the (non-commissioned) Consul there,Woonckhaus,has not boon in Basra Mice since his appeintpont. The speedy despatch of a Commissioned Consul (H.M.Consul) and the display af the (Jarman flag in Basra by moans of a email cruiser,are in ■ ? Hpinion ab - aelutely necessary if the development of German interests in that place is contemplated. Unless urgent circumstances already call for earlier measures,next November would bo the boat time for the despatch of a man-of-war,so as not to endanger the health of the crew needlessly.

BUSHIBB 22/8/14. The news of the outbreak of war between Turkey and England was brought the day before yesterday by several English merchant steamers who had fled from Basra to es cape internment. It is said that after the departure of those steamers the narrow mouth of the Shatt el Arab near Fao was closed by the Turks whereby Mohammerah (situated above Fao) will be inaccessible for large ships. Postal communication to Mohammerah and Basra stopped.

The( 80 ) U ' sV / •' /,/ / • O The English Consulate General recently published here the Proclamation of King George which is printed in the copy of the 'Times of India' sent to you,forbidding all English to trade with Germans. The proclamation was sent in Persian trans lation to those merchants who are agents of British firms or British shipping companies. They all signed the proclamation except one who said he had important consignments lying in Ham burg and was also expecting goods from Germany for which docu ments are lying with the Imperial Bank of Persia ; he could only ©bey the proclamation when the aforementioned consignments were paid for and his documents released : I hear that }f00 negoti ations are in progress between him and the British Consulate General ea these points. Mreewer it tees net eeem that the English themselves take the proclamation very seriously ; the Menager of the Im - perlal Bank of Persia here told the Manager of ff Mnckhaus in eenfidence — after the publication of the Proclamation — that he would always be happy to do business with the firm and meet them in every way. The patriotism of the English com - meroial world has from time immemorial halted when their money begs were seriously tonebod. The sentiments of the (Persian)inhabitants are mere than ever Germanephil $ the continuous news of victory in Renters have for a long time not been believed : reliable news ef German successes which got through last week via Basra were received with jubilation.

Even though t apparently,war has not broken out between Turkey and England yet, nevertheless everything points to its doing so soon ; the English mail and mercantile steamers are still not going on to Basra where many troops are said to be Mlleetlng* that in Kar achi a »«■&amp;•*■ *£ Arab boatmen who had gone there in sailing boats to make purchases were driven away because they could not prove their statement that they belonged to Koweit and were regurd** as Tarkish subjects.

As for inland telegrams in Persia,these as you know are accepted by the Indo European Telegraph Department,including cypher messages. In my despatch B.2? of 23/7/10 I had the hon our to report that the Telegraph Department look upon the des patch of these as a favour. But it seems strange that the Eng lish should forward cypher telegrams of representatives of hostile Governments B as a favour” and I therefore have the honour to request you kindly to ascertain in Tehran how the matter really stands,that is whether what the local director told me once is correct,or whether anything has been changed by a fresh agreement with the Persian Government,i.e.whether the I.E.T.D.is bound under all circumstances to send on cy - pher and other messages in Persia.. Major Knox,with whom I discussed the matter on the occasion of my already reported conversation about the case ©f the 'Christian X. n ,showed himself imperfectly informed ; he merely observed 'However the matter may be,! do not think any BritishBritish official can be compelled to do anything which he thinks incompatible with the interests of his own country”• I thought that in this I detected the concealed threat that one day perhaps the refusal of cypher telegrams and the English censorship would be extended to telegrams within Per sia, For this reason and in order not to be cut off from free communication with you,Sir,I have hitherto only passed on and that in strict confidence,however much I should have liked to oppose the mutilated English reports with authentic news,and that publicly.

People still however seem to consider war between Eng land &amp; Turkey quite possible. Turks have prohibited traffic on the Shatt at night and have umm also made preparat &gt; ions to close it altogether by means of sunken boats. Although in this way a sort of postal connection is restored with Basra,it is most irregular and unsatisfactory : not all mail steamers from Bombay go on to Mohammerah and in the case of the last two leaving here their destination was ahnounced so late that I for example could not get my mail A. ready in time. News from India rarer and rarer owing to strict cen sorship. It is stated that several English (not native) xsgk regiments have arrived at Karachi,but it is not known there whether they ere to remain in Karachi or be sent away,and if so whither. fferman successes and victories are naturally not mentioned in Reuter and the Times of India. Latter re - joices in tedious boasting of the excellence of Engish troopsand in omissions of facts in our favour,making a beautiful 4 L, mixture of dsgusting hypocrisy and dissimulation,enormous historical lies and inordinate vulgar insults,particularly against H.M.the Kaiser. One can,it is true,hardly reproach the Yellow Press for such expressions when even highly placed and aristocratic lords like Curzon use expressions such as 'this pinchbeck Napoleon who,with his accursed system,must be for ever hurled to the ground'* Mr.Churchilli boast,joyfully quoted by Reuter, 'if the German fleet doesn^ come out we’ll dig ’em out like rats' immediately received its answer near the Hook of Holland ! The French Consulate,abandoned for three years and gere by the British Consul General., has found in the newly ar rived Monsieur R.Vadala a new incumbent* If it was formerly difficult to understand why France maintained a Consulate in Bushire,where there are neither French business houses nor subjects,universal astonishment has now been caused by the sending of a consul just at the present juncture when all trade is at a standstill. Monsieur Vadala is said to have stated that after the war a large French firm would settle in the Gulf and £, that a regular steamship service of the Messagries Maritiraes would be established. The new French Consul evidently extends the breaking off of diplomatic to Consular relations,for he has only notified his assumption of charge to the consuls of friendly and neutral powers,not to me. Rumour says that Muwaqqar-ud-Dowleh Governor of the Gulgff Ports is dismissed and will be replaced by Mushir-us- Sultaneh brother of Nizam-us-Sultaneh Governor of Arabistan. Nizam-u s-SuItan eh when Governor General of Fars keenly opposed the Qawam party which was supported by the English,of which partyparty Muwaqqar-ud-Dowleh,then Karguzar in Shiraz,was also an adherent. Whether the Nizam is still hostile to the English or not is not known here,so cannot judge whether the appoint - ment of his brother instead of the very submissive-to-the- English Miwaqqar-ud-Dowleh ,means a change of policy on the part of the Persian Government or not. 0 If the rumour be con firmed, Muwaqqar's recall would be no loss to German interests in the Gulf,for these have only been furthered by him in the most unimportant details and only then when no harm was done thereby to British interests and behests. If both Muwaqqar-ud- Dowleh and his brother Karguzar Masud-us-Sultan have to clear out,that would be for us Germans a consummation devoutly to be wished J Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh Governor General of Pars,who was to have been called to Tehr a n as Minister of Justice,will re - main at his post in Shiraz. It is said that when asked to no minate his successor,he suggested Qawam as the only possible man,but that Qawam telegraphed to Tehran for Heaven’s sake leave Mukhbir in Pars as he was the only man who could keep the province in order. Whether the affection and mutual admiration of these two gentlemen are fraught with good for the province and for the Government revenues I cannot say. Listemann. A.13.

Motor ship 'Christian X.' was from Jibuti (1st inst.) to have arrived B/Abbas,but no news of her. Whether the S.S. has been j^ftfdetained by a violent monsoon or what her fate has been is not known here. My telegraphic warning of Aug.2nd (p.m.) was apparently not received by the ship.

HewsV s / (89) News re war reach here per Reuters telegrams which the British Consulate General continues to send to foreign Consulates and some other Europeans,but naturally only such reports as seem to the British authorities harmless are allowed to become pub - lie in this way* Public opinion in Bushire is excited and decidedly pro German or rather anti English and Russian. Whereas England and Russia are hated for their action in Persia,Germany is regarded as the Protecting Power of Islam races. Hatred of Russia is particularly strong and apparently embittered by the Clergy , who are incensed at the bombardment of the sacred mosque at Me shed and the execution of a number of spiritual dignitaries at Tabriz. Victory of the German arms is prayed for in the reli gious services now being held nightly during the fasting month of Ramazan: some isolated anti English and anti Russian small demonstrations have taken place and it is not impossible that i with such services religious fanaticism may arouse still greater excitement and result in still more serious excesses. But as an Indxan infantry regiment is in garrison here, any such excesses might have serious consequences. Copy to Tehran. Listemann . Cypher telegram Kardorff to Listemann. No.20 dated 5/10/14.

B.65. CONTENTS : Telegraphic communication. Towards the end of October the fear which I expressed in my despatch B.47 of 6/8 began to be confirmed,viz. that the English telegraphs would one day put difficulties in the way of or altogether refuse cypher telegrams between the Legation and the Consulate. Your telegram 23 of 15/10 took three whole days to come : to several telegrams in which I asked questions I received no answer. I therefore on the 3l/l0 tried using the Persian telegraphs and in my telegram I asked for an ac|~ knowledgment of receipt with time of receipt. This I never got. But on the 8 th November I received your telegram en clair ask - ing whether I had received the four telegrams of the 2 nd,3rd, 4th November. I immediately replied in the negative and re - ported the last telegram was No.23 of 15/10 and I myself had since then sent off telegrams 33/37. Your telegram was numbered 20 but as the next was 31 that was obviously a mistake of the telegraph people,easily explicable by the similarity of the Persian 2 (\) and 3 (O* On 14/11 I received telegram No.31 which informed me in Persian en clair that Y.E.had complained and had received a promise of strict investigation and severe punishment of the guilty party and asking me for a repetition ofof the telegrams not received. As you did not give the numbers of the telegrams not received by you,I thought I had better repeat all those for which I had had no acknowledgment and no reply. On the ... I received your No.33 and immediately ac - knowledged its receipt,on the 20th I got your No.^jf 37 which I answered the same day (my 41). Some days afterwards the local Persian telegraph office sent me a request from the telegraph office in Shiraz to repeat this telegram as Legation couldn’t understand it,and at the same time to wire it to Legation,as the mistakes had occurred in cyphering i I went over the original carefully and found only one small error,so I asked the telegraphs to send it on and if it were still incomprehens ible to Legation I would await a communication from Legation itself on the subject. I now have not received your telegrams 24-29,32,34-36,i.e. out of 14 telegrams I have received 4. My Nos.36—41 were sent by the Persian,previous ones by the English,wire. When using the Persian telegraphs I have always waited till evening as according to the statement of the com petent official the inland Persian wire is given to the Persians for their exclusive use from just before sunset till 9 o’clock in the morning,whilst at other times it is used by the English. Direct communication with Tehran only takes place occasionally, generally speaking the message is despatched from here to Shi raz and from there is re-transmitted direct to Tehran. Who is to blame for the non arrival of so many telegrams I could not say. It is noteworthy that some of Y.E’s cypher telegrams reach me,others not. It is perhaps possible that English officials in some illicit way at some intermediate station have joined on to the Persian wire during the off-hours. Or it may be dis honesty5 honesty on the part of some Persian official who ha^/ been bribed,which I should be inclined to think took place in Teh ran , fpr here all the work is done by one official and it is difficult to see how he would let one telegram go through and stop another* To my repeated enquiries and complaints I re - ceived from the Bushire Telegraph Office the categorical assu - ranee that my telegrams were sent off correctly and punctually to Tehran and that all telegrams from Tehran had been delivered to me correctly and punctually* Finally one must face the possibility that cypher telegrams are uu no longer safe — however unlikely that may appear to me* With the way in which I keep my cyphers here this is hot possible in Bushire,I only mention it therefore because apparently Y.E’s more important telegrams have not ar rived here. However little X believe in this possibility I have nevertheless thought it Hitum advisable in my telegram of yesterday to use the second figure. I can only describe as intolerable the position created by this insecurity of commu nication by cypher telegram. Since the middle of last month 10 telegrams out of 14 from Y.E.have not reached me,how many of mine haven’t reached Y.E.I cannot say. One telegram arrives, the next doesn’t. And now since the beginning of the Anglo- Turkish war I am completely cut off from communication with Basra. This has been particularly painful for me these last few weeks,as in consequence of my illness (despatch B*..*) I have been unable to maintain regular correspondence by des patch. But in Bushire I can do nothing to remedy this state of affairs* As I have stated already,! am unaware which of my telegrams sent off during the past 6 weeks have reached you \but I would remark that the English telegraph office has ac - cepted all my messages against payment of the fees and given receipts,and that no explanation has been received of non - delivery of cypher telegrams to Tehran* The cost of repeating several telegrams has already come to about 200 krans in round numbers.

Activity of Swedish Gendarmerie Officers. towards the end of December last two Swedish Gendarmerie officers » Major (Noren) Brandel and Captain Nystr$m t arrived with from Shiraz with about 40 gendarmes to clear from the Cus toms and convey to Shiraz 1500 rifles destined for the Gendar merie together with ammunition and a number of machine guns - all ordered from Germany. Ehey also wanted to enlist recrmits here. Shortly afterwards these Officers received instructions from Tehran not to leave Bushire for the present but to streng then their force here and drill their recruits. It was, feared f and TTith rsason^ that the force was not strong enough to cope with an attack by Qashgais,Qash - qnii qulis etc.,which attack might with some probability be expected from the great temptation/which so great a quantity of arms and ammunition as the gendarmes were to convoy must ■xpssn naturally expose the nomads. 160 nan from the warlike tribes of langistan, Argali,Dashtistan, etc..which in themselves make excellent material but are par ticularly averse to any discipline. This diffcuxty cropped up full soon and when Major Brandel at the beginning of the mo to The Officers succeeded gradually in recruiting about hadhad one of the men punished for open insubordination this so excited the others that the whole of the recruits left the i service ; after some dispute as to the amount of pay still due to the lien they left the service but succeeded in carrying off the rifles furnished them by the Gendarmerie. A few days later some of them made a night attack on the house occupied by the liie. OuA'ax wi'- ^ Swedish officers outside the town whowofry a number of shots were exchanged without result and shortly afterwards these people left the town at the urgent request of the Governor and returned to their villages. which they brought with them from Shiraz. She result of their deputation therefore se very small. It is true that from the Governor and other Persian authorities not only tney hc*ve re passive resistance. Eo a certain extent this may have been due to the fact that Major Brandel from the outset enphasised his independence of the Governor in a way which was perhaps some - times too pronounced. thm they noticed that their living in the Consulate General was interpreted by the inhabitants (as showing) that Since then the Swedes have only been able to add some twenty ex-Persian soldiers to the 40 fj e n (more or less) ceived no sort su but (have experienced) a not always The English 1 received these gentlemen in the English Consulate Gen' with the greatest courtesy ; rooms eral in town were placed at their disposal and in Sir Percy s eral in town were alnost like old a at first delighted at English friendliness. Kien Then when and were theythey were in reality in English rather than in Persian ser - vice they rented a house outside the town* And gradually it seeiss to have dawned upon them that English courtesies were not to be taken quite seriously or else were not meant quite honestly. At least one of these gentlemen said to me the other day in strict confidence ' The English in their conduct to - wards us obey the principle that the right hand shall not know what the left hand doeth ; with the right hand they support us openly,with the left they work secretly against us ; at the present moment the left hand seems to be more powerfully de - veloped than the right s at anyrate if we were to reverse our point of view that we are in the service of the Persian not the English Governaost,then there would seer, be - change ! These gentlemen have therefore to cope with great diff culties ; their knowledge of the country is very slight owing to the shortness of their stay in Persia and they understand so little of the language that they are entirely dependent on their Persian and Armenian interpreters who are for the most part nost unreliable 5 . In these two directions a change for the better will take place in time. And Lord Lanington ' 13 propo sal to replace the Swedes,ignorant as they are of intercourse with Orientals,by officers of the Indian Army appears absurd to all who know the situation here.fpr the dislike not to say Hatred of the En e lish,as has been previously shown,is so strone that Enclish officers would be absolute,;’ unable to re cruit a force* Colonel Hjalmarson,0.0.

Svredish Constant,Director of Customs,and on the house of the/offleers of the Gendarmerie,reported in my No. and after several threatening letters had reached the Governor,it was decided to bring to Bushire the rest of the regiment quartered at flask together with Staff,leaving behind a guard for the Telegraph Office at Jask. About 80 men arrived by last mail,the remain der being expected within the next for tnight ; the total re - inforcament cannot exceed 300 . Whether the English really be lieve in the possibility of serious disturbances , or whether the strengthening of the garrison is meant as a demonstration I cannot say. It is possible that to guard against the re - newal of such incidents a part of the reinforcement will be utilised to guard the country houses of British subjects. When however the ’” T 'i=S£ 0- 111 oae ° f ^ ~ iteSt numbers asserted that the houses of 'all Europeans' have since the murder of Madame Constant been guarded by sepoys this is no wise the truth : the only private residence which has since then been provided with a sepoy guard is Mono. Constant* s. TheyIhey say that the Central India Horse which was sent to Shiraz towards the end of 1011 will soon return to India. What a fatal mistake the despatch of the regiment to Shiraz was,has been demonstrated more and more clearly as time goes on. The force was too small really to re-establish order and tranquillity and yet *uzt strong enough to annoy the people and especially the nomad tribes. Shis was shown as early as December 1011 when Consul Smart was attacked. And since then / ■ the regiment in Shiraz has been as in a beleaguered fortress: the officers cannot leave the town without a strong escort, and in the town itself are often exposed to insults which they are powerless to resent as their instructions run to do nothing which might be constructed as a provocation ', such instructions being almost humourous in view of the fact that the despatch of the regiment was in itself a provocation She death of Captain Eckford has nothing to do with this,as it is clear nothing but the loot of a large goods caravan was intended,to which caravan Eckford had attached himself for the purpose of a shooting expedition,and that he,riding at the head of the caravan,was the victim of one of the f^rst shots fired,was a regrettable accident but not an attek Z - ' directf It is fairly p v probable that the Regiment will have even arlv the whole time of its sition in stay in Shiraz 'nave na harmn Rumour has it that the Regiment will commence its march to Bushire accompanied by the Gendarmerie detachment of some 500 men with which the Swedish Colonel Hjalmarson isj^expected to arrive shortly. In itsel* this vrould an sscsllsnt id3a,but it would still further lower the already sorely damaged British prestige, for the whole of the Gulf and the whole of South Persia would say M The Indian Cavalry Regiment Mi had itself escorted by the Gendarmerie so as to reach the coast in safety ' * For the mistake involved in the despatch of the regi - ment and the resultant damage to British prestige and increased hatred of the English Sir P.Cox seems solely responsible. There can be no doubt that the idea of sending a cavakry regiment to Shiraz emanated from him and was urged by him. From a usually well informed source I learn confidentially that the regiment had already reached Muscat at the end of 1911 when telegraphic in - structions for its immediate return to India arrived from For - eign Office London : Sir Percy retained the transports in Muscat on his own responsibility,telegraphed again strongly recommending despatch of the regiment to Pars and finally got his views ac cepted* Copy of this goes to ^shran.

The excitement caused by the murder of Madame Constant ^Oi&gt; ft;:;..' hi * • amongst the Europeans here and which in the case of a portion of the colony led to exaggerated anxiety,is beginning to sub - side.

AsAs I hajtfe remarked before I am convinced that as a general rule there is no danger for Europeans ; this does not however preclude the possibility of some incident or other driving the easily excited populace into excesses,or of some one whose interest it is to disturb the peace or get the Governor for instance into trouble killing off a European# Here in the midst of a semi-savage population who attach little value to human life,one has had to reckon for some years past on such incidents,ever since European prestige and greatness sunk comparatively so low under the influ ence of the Revolution,the so called 'progressive 1 and 'freedom* movement*and especially Russia’s severe and England's slack mode of procedure# On the road to Shiraz conditions are constantly changing* Row a European will arrivo an* relate how h3 pet through vrithout trouble of any kind,next day another traveller will come in who has ha d to pay large gratuities to road 'guards' to avoid ill treatment ; today a large caravan comes through unmolested and to’ morrow a second arrives whioh ha.n bewa completely looted* 3hie gnglish doctor Shiraz,who had come to Borazjur. to meet his sister-in-law from Europe,telegraphed from Eorazjun that the road was perfectly safe, and on the way back he is reported to have been attacked and only escaped a mauling (with his sis^-ei ln law) by some lucky chance. Ho details to hand yet about this incident. The Swedish Officer Col.Hjalmarson with about 500 gendarmes has left Shiraz and is expected here about the 23rd of this montn. 0 In the neighbourhood of Bunder Abbas some time ago cer tain villages were looted again by the nomads : an attack on the town itself was feared and an English man-of-war landed a de - tachnent with machine guns to protect the British Consulate in whichof Indie. leave which according to the m inc ta^en refuge* As the Belgian Director of Customs had come here to relieve M.Constant and so was not in the Consulate,the only other Europeans were the Quarantine Doctor and one English mer chant. Such marauding expeditions are by the/£way repeated regu larly every W.1 year between the months of November and April* when certain robber tribes of the nomads like the Baharlus and others leave their high summer quarters on account of the cold and wander round in the warm coastal belt near Bunder Abbas* on the 16th safe and sound and without having been in any way molested on the road,together with 60 Indian infantry who also belonged to the “increased consular guard” in Shiraz.

Also for the last year or so the post of two officers of the Intelligence Department has been created and one military and one naval officer are almost always on InteliA gence journeys through the whole Gulf to make maps and ^urve^ o and collect news of every kind. ^ A' As regards the future development of English policy in ^ South Persia I had a long and interesting conversation a short time ago with Sir P.Cox in the course of which he suddenly de dared himself averse to a policy of intervention or occupation; he remarked that for a real occupation of S.Persia such a large force would be required that the cost involved would swallow up for several years the whole amount of British trade with Persia, apart from the difficulty of terminating an occupation once start ed. Whether these Tiers z- ths Consul general , ..-.ic- diametrically opposed to his former attitude,spring from corr esponding instructions from his Government,or whether the exper ience gained by the despatch of a cavalry regiment to Shiraz (at his suggestion) has modified his views,I cannot say. For the present,Cox said,the only thing Great Britain could do was to strengthen Persia financially,and that (as has already haooened to a certain extent) with large sums and not by smallm advances to individual governors of profoinfes like last year to the Qavraro in Shiraz, as such small sums were in themselves in - sufficient and besides mostly disappear in the pockets of the governor in question* And after that (he said) we should have to wait for a time and see whether this financial assistance led to the desired object and was well spent - on a proper orga- / ■ nisation and strengthening of the Gendarmerie before everything - and reserve further action* In other words the tire-honouted policy of 'rubbing alon~ sonehow' rhich has bean consistently followed for years with the solitary exception of the despatch to Shiraz of the cavalry regiment,which has turned out a mistake* Copy to Tehran* Sd/- Listemann* &amp; No.A 15„ (Wassmuss Shiaz to Berlin).

Faisal bin Turki al Busaidi has reigned since 1888.

Anyhow,until last year Faisal is said to have paid According to Reuter serious disturbances have part (409 meiO the r.ajputs quartered in Tushl According The cause of the trouble is sa.id to be Sultan Seyid tributetribute regularly. The reason for his novf refusing is said to be a new arrangement with England whereby he is exempt from this obligation* Perhaps the tribes in the interior find a sufficient c^sus bglli in the fact of the English and the Sultan having made treaties (with each other) especially the agreement for tlie/?regulation of the arms traffic* The number of tbs attackers is given as 30,000 * They have obtained possession of the villages in the neighbourhood of Muscat and according to another report from Bushire they even penetrated into the town and hauled down the English flag* The Sultan has sent his son to the friendly tribal chiefs in the interior inviting them to come to his assistance* The English Consul General left Bushire on the 4th instant and went via Koweit to Muscat Copy to Tehran* WassmussA 9 . (Capture of Turkish Gulf-Coast by Arabs frorc Nejd)* Wassmuss to Berlin, The Wahaby family of the Beni Sa^id which rules in Bejd has profited by the difficult position of Turkey to possess itself of Turkish territory in the Persian Gulf. The district of El Hasa and El Katif,situated N.W.of the peninsula El Katr and officially designated together with the hinterland as the Sanjak of Nejd has for a very long tip»e (with the exception of places actually on the coast) been subordinate to the Turkish Government on*y in name ; but Turkey kept a force in El Hasa and El Katif of several thousand men and levied Customs dut - ies there. Now about a fortnight ago the chief of the Ben6 Sa*ud,Abd el Aziz bin Abdur Rahim,who rules in Nejd in actual independence,appeared vrith^an army of 13,000 m the oases of El Hasa and summoned the Turkish Vali/res^ident in Hofuf to evacuate with his troops. Latter resisted although he had only 500 men at his disposition and the town was then captured by force of arras whereby ISO Turkish soldiers are said to have been killed. Abd ul Aziz permitted the Vali to go to Basra ial in Hofuf fled to Bushire via Bahrein and telegraphed from in Hofuf,said here to number about 350 men,got away in sail ine scats to Bahrein and thence v-ere forwarded on the 15th with his son in a sailing boat.

The inhabitants of r atif are three-fcurths ^hies. This is probably the reason why the town did not surrender at once. The Turkish garrison is said to be only 200 men. Before the Turks had to fight with Italy and the Balkan States,there were in El Hasa and El Katif together 8000 Turkish soldiers ; during these wars the garrison was reduced more and more so that now only 500 men remain in El Hasa and 200 in El- Katif. Abdul Aziz has already possessed himself himself of the harbour of Ojair and is said to have changed the Turkish cus - toms tariff so that imports have to pay only 5$ whilst exports are free. The inhabitants ascribe Abdul Aziz*s action to hints from English quarters. Fugitives from El Hasa have related here that about a month ago an Englishman disguised as an Arab with one Arab companion from Baghdad came from the interior to El Hasa and stayed there three days. The rumour spread among the inhabitants that the had csns to infoct tho town with plague whereupon hejfwa&amp;B driven away and had gone to Bahrein, The English Consul in Koweit has during the past year been no fwwer than three times in-to the interior to Nejd,being accom panied on the journey thither by horsemen of the Sheikh of Koweit and on the return journey by Abdul Assist people. It is also said that 5,000 Bedouins of the Sheikh of Koreits sphere ofi&lt;!&gt; of influence fought on the side of Abdul Asia* It is also related in Pahrein that Abdul A^sln naintain^-a good relations with the English. Whether the English are really trying to make diffi culties for Turkey in the Gulf by these means I cannot say. Of the whole coast belt down to Koweit only the stretch from Ojair to El Katif is habitable owing to the subterranean v/ater courses which are found there. El Katr as far as I know is not recognised by the English as Turkish territory,Turkey has never had any influence there,and as the Sheikh of Koweit is already under English influence to a certain extent and has £ all events made a treaty with England,there remains after the cap ture of El Hasa &amp; El Katif no Turkish place in the Gulf and England has onlty to deal with Arabs and helpless Persia. With the (help of the) prestige of her ever-ready ships she wjll easily conclude a treaty with Abd el Asis simi lar to that made with the Sheikh of Koweit or that of Bahrein making it impossible for other States to obtain any influence over him or ask ^or coucossions from him without England m reserving a formal right of veto. Three weeks ago an officer of the so-called Intelligence Department of the Indian Army arrived in Bushiee at the same time as myself. He knows Arabic,was a long tine in Damascus and apparently in places still deeper in the rian desert. The story went that he came here to Iwarn Persian. But after a few days he vanished,ostensibly for Mu- hammerah,and I have been unable to learn anything more about his sojoarning. Without doubt England is pursuing an exceedingly active policy in the Gulf. C 0 py Tehran and Baghdad.

Wassmuss Shiraz to Imperial Chancellor. Shiraz July 7th 1013 . With reference to my telegram of yesterday*s date to the Minister asking that Your Excellence should be informed, I have the honour to report as follows on the activities of the English against the Tangistanis. The reason for my telegraphing thro* Tehran was,that on account of my journey from Bushire to Shiraz I only heard of the events in question a fortnight after they had happened,and I assumed that Legation had perhaps later news which would enable them to complete or correct my report. My knowledge of events rests on despatches from the Consulate Munshi Mirza Hussein Ali in Bushire* Here in Shiraz I have beenbeen unable to learn rauch about occurrences on the coast, as people obviously take little interest in them* ^n;lan&lt;! ha? „i70n her Ships in the Ssrsias Gulf, and the 2nd Rajputs in Bushireia chance of showing a little military activity. After the inglorious retirement of the C.I.H from Shiraa the English certainly had need to display their power in some other fashion in the eyes of the Persians,and found a convenient object in the Sangistanis,those insubordi nate dwellers in the hills of the Bushire hinterland* The Tamgistanis,who are le^d by local tribal chiefs,pay no taxes to the Persian Government,but on the contrary do grave injury to the Treasury by smuggling on a large scale through the ports of DILVAR and other landing places South of Bushire, which are under their control,and by conveying to Persia tea sugar dyes and other wares in their sailing boats from the pposite shores of Arabia and Bahrein. But they nafce themsel- es especially obnoxious to the Enjlish by induleing in Arl ' lti Iraffic and in spite of all measures taken to prevent them ;hey find ways and means of smu eC lin E in arms and ammunition. Ihe number o' their aalos bearin; ar=3 i= sevor-l thousand. The following incident is said to have given ri^e o the intervention of the English. Some two years ago the lh0 w of a Tangistani named Zair Hussein foundered near DEBAI &gt;n the Arab coast. In the boat were 100 guns which their ovr- ier had brought overland from Muscat to Defcai. He was o ' S ed to bring them back to land again to get the dhow mended. As soon as the Arabs heard of it,they looted the rlfles under the pretext that they had become flotsam and divided them among themselves. On the return journey Zair Hussein1^0 met a dhow belonging to inhabitants of DEBAI coning from the pearl fishing* To compensate themselves for the lossof the rifles he and his companions overpowered the vessel,killed its crew of ten (all save one) and seized the pearls in the boat which were worth about Rs*^0,000 (£ 2000) . The one survivor fled from Tangistan to Lingah and thence returned to Debai where the deceased of what had occurred* Then also the English Con sular authorities heard of it and at once proceeded ( asked or unasked,I don f t know which ) to avenge this act of piracy in accordance with the obligation undertaken by England in the treaty with the Arab Chiefs of the Pirate Coast ( crucial Chiefs* 1 )• They arrested Zair Hussein’s father t who had perhaps taken part in the misdeed,in Bahrein and brought him on board ner found an opportunity of throwing himself into the vmter and swimming to land and escaped to Eangistan.

In order to ensure against a sudden attack by Tangi- stanis he induced the Governor to build a number of forts on the edge of the sandy waste which unites Bushire with the nainlan* and is flooded at hifh tide. As a natter of fact, these forts are only insienificant stone buildings surrounded by a low wall,and the Governor wilfully informed ne their ob ject was to prevent smuggling. Also the Kalantar of R«shire the official responsible for the safety of the island ex - elusive of the town itself,was given for his dismisca-. a— deposed. Although the reason his participation t ~ e arms traffic,1 believe the true cause was that the British Consul General mistrusted him. Also the Tangistani tufang- chis (riflemen) of whom the Governor had some 30 as a personal escort were dismissed at the end of May. and rep_aced by armed men from Shabanfcareh a large village of Bashtxstan.

A few days later the deputation, which consisted of some 25 Eangistanis,were driven out of Eu- shire by the Governor*s men. On the 12th June Captain Birdwood First Assistant of the British Consul General went on the 'PELORUS' to Dilvar the principal Tangistani port,and there published a proclamation of the British Government*s intent - ions : the Tangistani tribal chiefs had promised to capture and hand over the murderers in question but had not fulfilled their promise : therefore the English men-of-war would continue to capture Tangistani dhows. But if they would hand over the murderers and pay Ra.30 t 000 within a fortnight expect very stern measures.-Meantime the boats were convened to the little island of Kharak: North of Bushire,and 100 men of the Rajput Resiment in Bushire were detailed to cuard then. The cruiser 'PHILOMEL' on June 12th sent a steamboat to the roadstead of MADU MARI,a small anchor ine place near Dilvar,to take away several boats lyi«e at anchor there. Suddenly a number of lan E istanis appeared,fired on the steam boat and prevented the capture . Two officers or petty offi - cers and three sailors were tilled and three wounded. She w cruisercruiser then began to fire on the village and destroyed the 70 reed huts of which it was composed* The Tangistanis had two killed and three severely wounded. , ||^ The same thing happened next day at Dilvar,where the 'PELORUS' wanted to tow away several dhows per steamboat. Tangistanis appeared and compelled the boats to withdraw. Capt ain Birdwood thereupon demanded from Reis Muhammad the princi pal chief of Dilvar that the attackers be handed over within ten hours,otherwise the village would be fired upon. On receipt of this news the inhabitants of Dilvar immediately sent their women and children and their property into the neighbouring hills and held themselves ready for defence behind their sea walls, without returning any answer to Captain Birdwood 9 s demands. At the end of the ten hours the cruiser fired 56 shots into the village,apparently without doing nuch lanugo , ao the houses had been protected by a chain of mounds thrown up in front. On June 20 the three cruisers took 500 men of the Indian regiment in Bushire on board,to land them in Tangistaru bombarded Dilvar in concert from the 21st to the morning of the 23rd,so that the inhabitants could no longer hold out Tut were conpellei to se«k refuge in the mountains. When the English «ere quite sure that there wouli be no more resistance the 300 men were landed and within si* hours completely destroyed the whole village,set fire to the houses and laid waste the fields. Be - fore sunset however the force was brought back to the ships. Dilvar consisted of about 200 houses and over A 1000 inhabi - tants. HADU MARI had already been destroyed and 1? boats which were still there,burnt. A great number of dhows which vrerevr«re returning from Bahrein or other places and v/ere in ig - norance of what had happened were in like manner seized and burned. When threatened with bombardment the inhabitants of Dilvar turned to all sides for help. Prom Dashti^the coast plain south of Bushire,400 Tangistanis marched out but appar ently reached Dilvar too late ; in any case they returned to their villages without accomplishing anything. Vain were the letter? which Rais Muhammad and other Eangistanis addressed to the merchants,the Karguzar,the Court of Justice (‘adlieh*) and a Mullah in Bushire. Ihe last named did indeed interview the Governor and try to induce him to take measures to defend (their friends) but of course without avail. For the Governor has no will (of his dwn) vis-a-vis the English and was I be lieve aware of their plans against the ^angistanis. How far the whole transaction took place with the knowledge of the Pers ian authorities ! czzzzi tell. £he Governor sent a message in reply to the Tangistanis that the matter did not concern him as Eangistan was included in Pars and not under his jurisdict ion, moreover the English had authority to act from the Persian Government. — It is true that at the beginning of the fight the English cruisers are said to have hoisted the Persian flag. It is also true that Eangistan and the neighbouring Dashti do not belong to the district of the Governor of the Gulf Ports*.but to ths .rcrinee of 3 The reason for this remarkable partition which the Bushire Governor with justice complains of,is unknown to me.

It is dated June 16 and is signed by five men whose names are unknown to me,they sign M for the whole population belonging to Tangistan M * £ In the absence of Mirza Hussein Ali of Bushire the letter was taken to his house. As no place is specified in the letter it is not certain where it was written. Context is in favour of Dilvar. The writers beg that the bombardment by the English may be stopped out of pity for the innocent women and children.They add they were unable to hand over Zair Hussein and his father, were guiltless themselves and did not know why such a judgment should be suspended CY2r their heats* To avenge the two years old case of piracy suen thorough measures were not necessary s the seizine of a few dhows would have been more to the point. In addition to the reason already mentioned that the English needed to revise respect for their power,the Tangistanis* arms trafficking was probably the cause of the action taken. Another reason (in view of England's manifest attempts at present to strengthen the hands of the Persian Government) may have been the wish to curb smuggling (which is very rife) and so increase the customs revenues. H is certainly out of the question for the Persian Government themselves to think at ththe present tine of taking any steps against the Tangistanis. The Governor General here,whose subjects they are,was appar - ently no better informed than myself about these matters. He made the very pertinent remark that nothing ever came out of 4 such punitive expeditions ; they only hit the innocent,while the real culprits always managed to escape punishment, but otherwise he attached no importance to the business. His own force is totally insufficiont for him to undertake an ex - pedition into those parts of his province on the other side of the mountains and so evidently he cares very little for what happens there. I can see no particular reason for England want ing to embrace a forward policy at the present juncture i it would appear as though certain circles in India and England were always dinning in to the ears of the Liberal Government that w something must to dono 'jtill the latter at length resolved on martial measures. They say that about the same time as the Tangistan ports were bombarded an English man-of-war destroyed the little port of KALAT near Lingah wherein about ten Persians lost their lives. Here too the reason alleged was an incident already ancient history. A year or two ago an English man-of-war’s boat vanished when serving along that coast on the repression of arms traffic. No one knew if it had met with an accident or had had to fight smugglers. Now the evidence of a sheikh has suddenly shown that the crew of the boat were murdered by the KALAT people. Naturally tne Persians say that this Sheikh had a grudge against the Kalat sheikh and they doubt his testimony. By the events described above fresh nutriment has beenbeen given to the Hate which the people of South Persia che- rish against the English* Yet so far as I know this hatred ■ s ' - - v ■ ,: '''' ■ has never broken out openly. In view of the lack of cohesion of the various tribes no far reaching consequences are to be feared. Here in Shiraz hardfcy anyone mentions the destruction of Dilvar* In connection with their action against the £ang~ istanis the English seem to be striving after systematic sup - ervision of all sailing boat traffic in the Gulf and in order to accomplish this they avail themselves of the services of the customs authorities. For example in Bushire they have or dained that every Shiliai ^oat Isaving that ^ort must get a pass to show the English ships. The passes were originally signed by the British Consul General or his representatives though they bore the Persian coat of arms* Then the Persian custons authorities Bade an order that passes would be issued by their department aeainst afee of 20 krans (about 8/-). I do not know whether the passes continued after that o signed by the Consulate General. Copy of this despatch goes to Tehran.

They have been transacting business there through and in the name of th«irtheir Persian broker so that the firr^s name is not mentioned ; in reality however it is their coods which they give the broker for sale* £he broker now owes them more than 100,000 Rs.

In the Abu Musa case the Sheikh of Shargah roundly de-^ dined (on the suggestion of the British) tBEESKBipp&amp;xgixsBlx to accept direct correspondence with the German Consulate. Experience teaches that even the Sultan of Muscat often does not deal with letters from the Imperial Consulate when it does not suit his book to answer them. Finally it might he ^ossibls for the In^sriel Consul to travel in person to the Pirate Coast and institute prelimi 1 ” nary enquiry and investigation on the spot. But apart from the cost of such expeditions success could not be guaranteed. In the districts in question legal claims are seldom susceptible of settlement without a show of force. For this reason the merchants established there work with Anglo-Indian houses,and the German firm who have without doubt been much more energetic hitherto and whose activity has in certain directions been the first to develop European trade have to withdraw from the business. With these explanations as to the fasts of the case, I have the honour to request X.E's instructions to the Imperial Consulate on the general question whether claims of German firms on the Oman and Pirate Coast are to be pressed through the intermedia-ry of the English Political Resident.

LISTEMANN.A 20 (Wasswuss Shiraz to Imperial August Chancellor Berlin). Shiraz 8th itai;.. 1913 . The province of Pars has for a long time enjoyed unwonted peace* At the beginning of June two disturbers of the peace named Muhammad Guli Khan and Askar Khan were rendered harmless mainly through the energetic action of Qawam l the former being shot by Qawamjthe other hanged by order of the Governor General shortly before ray arrival in Shiraz* As the result of an announcement in Beuter the news ran through the papers that the Gendarmerie had scofced a great vie - tory ; but from all we hear here the Gendarmerie played a far from brilliant part in the expedition and certainly took no share in the seizure of the miscreants. Tt nevertheless very difficult to glean the truth from the many assertions and rumours which are current and I would merely point out that the Swedish Major who commanded the Gendarmerie instead of arresting Muhammad Guli Khan gave him a letter of protection,and that the Gendarmerie are reproached with plunderine a villaee and lootint many carets c“ns etc. The Governor General,Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh,who has governed the province for iH ten months,claims the merit for the present Improvcnont of affairs in ^ars* The ^ur^poana here say he merely had luck,because all parties were weary of fignt ing,but they also call him the best Governor Pars has had dor a long time.

Still worse is the outlook of the separate districts. For the district governors are not paid at all, but are free to extract as much from their Government as they like,provided they pay a certain fixed sum as taxes to the Financial Administration. As the same system applies more or less to the subordinate government departments,especially to the riflemen allotted to each Governor,despotism becomes universal f and no wonder that the pmpkHilatioH population withdraws itself when it can from oppression or gives itself up to acts of lawlessness. ion only be A permanent soundness of conditions can in ny opin be induced when this sort of government' is aban- doned.

When mules destined for carrying the post are too fevr a portion of the d overseas mail simply stays behind in Bushire. Ehus for ex ample I have had no European mail for a fortnight though the postal caravan has arrived according to schedule twice in the week* The Governor General’s policy is that which of old aj hs been adopted by the Persian Government,namely in the ab - sence of a sufficiently large Govcrnnent forco to play off one rival against the other,or to win them over by enabling them to oppress those weaker than themselves. The whole government is based on injustice and oppression. As the Governor General is without doubt a wise and skilful man he has succeeded in building up a strong position for himself and has hitherto managed to maintain order and tranquillity. Whether this is not mainly due to extraneous circumstances such as war-weariness of the tribes etc. let posterity judge. Especially is the above the case in re - spect of his relations with the two great parties or groups of inhabitants which have fron olden tines opposed each other in Pars and in Shiraz itself,nanely the Qawan's party or Arab section of the community and the Solat’s party or Turk' ish nonad tribes. He has hitherto succeeded as none of his predecessors has for long in remaining on satisfactory terms wl th both parties. Perhaps he has less his own cleverness to thank for this than ths iif'teulties which havs besot the tvro1$ two party leaders. He bound the Qawam to himself by chains of gratitude by affording himan opportunity of marching against certain leaders and Arab tribes who had refused to follow him &gt; and by placing at his disposal a force which had originally been mustered against the Baharlu to punish the murderers of the English Major Eckford. I assume that his relations with the Kashgai leader Solat ud Dowleh rest on similar support given and received. Solat is at present in the neighbourhood of Isfahan and is engaged in obtaining racognition of his dignity as Ilkhani from all the Qashgai tribes. Certain administrative reforms which the financial authorities have initiated with a view to a new partition of the districts for taxation purposes have not yet been completed. The HHii object of the new partition is to separate by a space the Turk and Arab nomad tribes. An opium tax which is to hit the use of opium for smoking purposes was successfully intro duced in the town of Shiras last June,and realized 11,?30 fcrs., (nearly £250) in the first month. This very tax is a proof that things have improved,for former attempts to introduce it al - ways collapsed in the face of the opposition of the inhabi ~ tants. The wretched state of the Government during the past year is illustrated by the following sttistics : *otal revenue from rates &amp; taxes in Pars Province 1^3-X^3 Krans 800,435 (abodt £ 18,000) , contributions from Tehran 1,3 1, (about £ 37,'?*'''! . ^ (Belgian) Director of Customs told outlook for a. proseot j,.r 1, -otter of to -uch brlt-ter ; ».

At tbe same time there creased in comparison with last year. isis ffluch heavier outlay on the Gendarmerie which is now an entire regiment* Monthly expenditure on the Gendarmerie in Pars is about Krs 440,000 (mistake for JEfijnsES 440,000) or £ 100,000 a year, this must b3 aided the czzt of fodder which comes to about 060,000 krans (almost £ 20,000) a year. I hear there is a difference of opinion between the Finance Minister and the British Minister,the former saying it ought to be paid out of the English loan,whilst the latter maintains it ought to be borne by local revenues. On account of the paucity of the rainfall the corn harvest in Pars this year is not good. As in many dis - tricts the locusts have/&lt;devoured everything prices of corn?£ are fairly high. In spite of certain rumours current in Bushire however a famine is not anticipated. The Pars regiment of Gendarmerie under Swedish off! cers has not so far been able £o reveal any special efficiency. On account of the great heat during the sumiaer months on those parts of the Shiraz-Bushire road which are not high above sea-, level they have not been able to occupy the road further than Kumarij,about half way. It has been shown that the men,hailing for the Host mart from North Persia,cannot stand the heat Moreover the 0 . 0 .Gendarmerie,Col.Hjalmarson,made an arrange - ment with the road chiefs as he travelled down whereby sa J on the road has till now been guaranteed. It is not quite correct (to say) that by this arrangement the chiefs are per mitted to tafce road tolls. The concession made to them lies rather in their receiving monthly payment for a certain num - b er of riflemen. Obviously this does not guarantee the caravansLf D umiiinnnmi'Tnwiw. not having to pay,but under existing circumstances it was certainly a wise and - as the hitherto undisturbed security of the road testifies - a successful measure. Now is the time for the Gendarmerie to show what it can do. Such is the universal opinion here and people are not convinced that they would come-off victors in any serious collision with the warlike tribes. Ehe Swedish Officers do their best but are compelled of necessity to leave a great deal to their native officers,they cannot learn the language and conditions of the country in so short a space of time,and fi- c nally they are dealing with mere mercenaries • For instance a week ago 13 men deserted taking with them 13 horses,their rifles and much ammunition and so far CCCC only two of the men have been recaptured. - In this case they were Mujahids, about whose enlistment froz the very first doubts wsro ox - pressed. The Governor General has,presumably from lack of Eoney.had to abandon his plan of creating a force for hin self. He has about 350 men as nucleus of the regiment which he proposes to form.

Ahmedi is about 25 miles from here. Yesterday morning the detachment of gendarmes which has been here since the end of December,left for Ahmedi en route for Shiraz picking up the detachment which had remained behind there. A large muie caravan which is taking 100,000 Tomans in cash for the Imperial Bank in Shiraz,in addition to the arms &amp; ammunition for the gendarmerie,accompanies the troops. I hear that Colonel Hjalmarson has made an arrangement with the chiefs of the villages between Shiraz and Bushire where by the latter will be allowed to make certain exactions in the future from caravans passing through their district. These exactions which are a heavy burden on trade are in themselves entirely illegal and it seems at first sight remarkable that the Officer Commanding the Gendarmerie should recognise them in an Agreement. It seems likely however that the Colonel will only maintain this A-roomcnt until the Gsndarnerie are strong enoughenough and sufficiently organised to undertake in reality the policing of the road,and that at the outset his only object was to make the village chiefs &gt; who are afraid of losing one of their chief sources of revenue on account of the Gendarmerie , friendl^ disoosed towards the new order of things* I have re ~ marked before that the conveying^a large quantity of arms, ammunition and iHf cash must be a great temptation to the nomad tribes and may induce them to attack the gendarmes.

Suppression of Arms Traffic in Muscat. The above quoted despatch from Consul General Calcutta already jives the ^in points.

A Royal Proclanation of the Sultan pub - lished in May or June last year.which Dr ListeBann Beant to nake the subject of a despatch (but was prevented fron so doing by illness) reads as follows 2- M IN VIEW OF the danger of disturbance theft fire vri.icL accrues to the real® throujh the fact that large quantities of arms are stored in various shops in the town,WE h,*ve de oided that front the First of SepteBber of the present year dspecial warehouse shall be established in the Customs and shall be in the hands of a special officer and governed by the foll owing regulations 2- 1.

It is worthy of note that these “draft rules' as is shown by the footnote on the last page were printed at the printing press of the English Foreign Office. Their contents I think bear in many details the imprint of the Bushire C6nsul General Sir P.Cox,and the conversion of the Sultan (as shown in his willingness to issue the order) may be regarded as Sir Percy s ,ork — Cox was in Muscat for a long tine in May and June last rear.

Further the Rules contain BO re detailed provisions regardingregarding the formalities to be observed when importing arms. According to these the Captain of the steamer in which arms are to be imported is bound to furnish full particulars as to the number and nature of the weapons*their value,country of origin,shipper and consignee. (Rule 5). If this regulation is not observed,the arms are liable to seizure on leaving the shio. For the release of arms from the warehouse Rules 10-12 fix the greatest limitations. If these are observed strictly Arms Traffic in Muscat becomes absolutely impossible,for per mission to remove arms will not be granted to any person who is suspected of intending to re-sell the same. (Rule ll) • Ostensibly the Regulations do not contain a prohib ition of the Arms Traffic,althoueh the strict application of the rules is practically equivalent to a prohibition. I I therefore regard the introduction of the Regulations as a asteroiece of their author. Prance is Rnown to have protested ^ _ 4 . * •~ -sr, Tr»aat T? ’Tith Muccc.t France gainst the ?.n -iw*. - + s only guaranteed freedom of trade,which does not preclude ;he issue of detailed rules to regulate the manner of arms traffic. The Sultan,too,has masked the true object of : ‘i- regulations in a most admirable way by his solicitude Tor the safety of the town from disturbance,theft and fire. In reality the French have gained nothing by .xieir protest. The French arms dealers in Muscat have been comnelle to deliver their stores of arms into the Sultan 1 s arms ware- hiuse. and in spite of'/Se French Consul 1 s efforts they have not yet been returned to them. Meanwhile the agent of the Paris firm of De Dieu has left for France. The issue of the Decree is undoubtedly to be regardedregarded as a triumph English policy. In tho Indian press •Uioy anticipates a considerable (Hwainufri'eTi in the cost of the blockade of the Persian Coast,for which in the past few years very large sums have had to be set aside from Indian revenues. In any case it is certain that the arms traffic has immediately diminished in volume. For example the steamers of the Hamburg America Line have taken back to Europe the arms they brought to Muscat on account of Germans and no inconsiderable loss has been sustained thereby. It may of course appear doubtful whether this effect of the Decree will last. As manipulation in retail takes place in Muscat it is beyond ny ken what people cooperate at it. I had only two hours at Muscat on my journey to Bushire, but I was able to go ashore and talk to the agent of Messrs Mauser,El Baa by nana,himself a Freneh Algerian. In accordance with the terms pf the Regulations he , is recognised as an arms trader and has his storeroom in the arms warehouse. I heard from him that business in arms was still carried on secretly. This is confirmed by events in the Gulf. It was recently reported that 200,000 cartridges for the Tangistanis had been landed in a small yor- ..outh shire and that a French dhow (i.e.a native anew fillip the French flag) had brought 600,000 cartridges to Koweit . A merchant from Debai tried to convey 400 guns and five cases of cartridges to a Sangistani port but was pursued by English boats and consequently threw all his cargo into the se.. In ^turn for the Decree the English Government is °uitan 200,000 Rupees for the fir. 1 ^ year said to be paying tne *ni-.tan , and l~, o- * s . each succeed ^ r be idle’talE.

But even if such did exist we could still not immedjfiately deduce a grie*- vance,as we possess neither a most-favoured-nation-clause nor any commercial treaty with Muscat* Whether it be desi - rable to conclude one and whether it would be possible to do so in view of England^ attitude in the Gulf lies outside the scope of this despatch* The proposal of the Waffenfabrik Hauser (your despatch dated 31st July) to oppose the limitation of the arms traffic all with/thw means at their disposal is in the circumstances doomed to failure. What the twt firm states is true* It x« a well-known fact here that it is precisely Mauser guns and pistols which used to enjoy a great sale in Muscat,so id precisely Messrs*Mauser who were hardest hit by the tan*s measure. Copy to Tehran. Wassmuss*A 19 (Wassrauss Shiraz to Berlin). Shiraz 4/8/1913. EXTRACT (In the first part of this despatch Herr Wassmuss describes his journey fron Bushire to Shiraz : when he reaches the place where Mr.Swart was attacked in 1911 he comments as follows 2“*) The detachment of Indian troops which accompanied Consul Swart consisted of 100 mounted men. A Persian Gendarmerie officer told me that their assailants numbers! sis cnly. oj ifvz J^a. Judging from the topographyshould think this quite poss - ible ; for the rocky heights which hedge the road about make sniping from behind cover a matter of apparent ease and also enable people who know the ground well to escape by paths un suited for cavalry.- I cannot say how far this other state ment is true which I heard on the spot and again in Shiraz, that the Indian cavalry sprang from their horses after the first few shots and exclaimed , Don , t shoot,Don*t shoot. We too are Muslims ! * (After describing his journey as far as Shiraz Wassmuss continues J-) In the neighbourhood of the capital of Bars,the seat of government,where a certain number of troops have al ways been sisiiBflRed stationed , the local Khans have been unable to develop the same degree of independence as further down the road as far ac tho innoiiate neighbourhood of Bushire the Governor of which having no fighting force is condemned to impotence vis-a-vis the inhabitants of the hinterland. This also accounts for the absence of the numerous nor^ 4nomad tribes who claim the district around Shiras as their 'k:ingdom H . I am unable to enumerate all the nomad tribes of the province of Pars. For conditions on the Bushire-Shiraz road the Turk Qashqais deserve special mention ; they are composed of a whole series of sub-tribes one of which,the Qashquli, under its loader ”nHamr:ad All Khan , was especially active last year in disturbing the road. They are said to number 5,000 armed men. The total number of an Qashqai warr - iors is estimated at twenty to thirty thousand. But relations between the various septs are not so close as formerly. The paramount Chie^» Soltfat-ud-Dowleh 1 s two brothers are his rivals and although he bears the title of Ilkhani of all the Qashqais it is open to doubt whether the whole fighting force of his people would follow him to battle. At present they say he could only raise some 600 men-at-arms from among his immediate tribal companions. The nomads of Lur and Arab descent also migrate as far as the trade route and especially advance nearly up to Shiraz. The Arab and Bur tribes classed together under the name of Khamseh might be able to collect five or ten (Qawam says twenty) thousand fighting men. This fact is of importance for the position of the Gendarmerie in Shiraz itself. Accor ding to information by the O.C.Gendarmerie here the regiment is at present composed of 1451 officers and men. Of the Swedish officers at present only one Major and tv;o captains and one paymaster ( a major) are in Shiraz as one major and a captain returned to Tehran a short while ago. Their reliefs are however expected shortly. Only about one-third of the force has so far been utilised for the guarding of the ShirazShiraK-Bushire road and nearly 1,000 men remain in Shiraz. The great heat vrhich reigns during the summer months especi ally in the lower parts of the Bushire road makes it advisa - ble apparently to defer policing the road beyond Kumarij. Therefore only the following detachments and posts are on ' road 2— Persian N.C. Os &amp; men. Horses Officers 1.

According to the terms of the agreement to which the latter have subscribed they arc justified in and bound tc participate in the protection of the road with a specified number armed men,in return for which service the Gendarmerie pay their people monthly salaries. The rate of pay for a ’’chef is 15 Tomans (£3) for a sowar 12 Tomans (£2-8-0) lor a^ mar onVI ' '/ on foot 6 Towans (£1-4-0). As far as I could discover 9/chefs 10 mounted and 106 unmounted men are paid in this way at present along the Shiraz-Kumarij section* This system is also in force in other parts of the province ; e*g*in the neighbourhood of Shiraz there are 7 mounted and 07 unmounted men of this kind,on similarly the way to Isfahan 20 horse &amp; 86 foot and/in other parts of the province,but independent of the Gendarmerie,3 chefs 05 mounted and 271 unmounted men-at-arms are maintained. For the village chiefs at Daliki &amp; BorazjunjNur Muhammad Khan &amp; Ghazanfer-us-Sultaneh respectively,with whom no such agree ment has yet been made,2 M chefs M 15 horse &amp; 72 foot are suggested. T’he cost cf these auxiliaries paid by the Gendarmerie has so far burdened the Finance Department with Krans 23,130 a month (about £462j)a With the extra men proposed the figure will be nearer 30,000 krans (£600). As stated above,so far the road has only been controlled as far as KumarThe most difficult portion, embracing the dis- triots of KonartakhteU Daliki &amp; Borasjun.ia still left to the local rulers. But these too have guaranteed the safety of the road and taken tolls so far on the strength of (the arrangement). e Just now the Governor General has succeeded,he tyflls ine.in persuading Nur Muhammad Khan &amp; Ghazanfer-us Sultaneu to cease levying road tolls. I have also news from Bushire confirm ing this. Whether compensation consists only in paying two chiefs 15 mounted &amp; 72 unmounted men I have not been able to ascertain. In this way the next warlike operation which (according to common rumour) the Gendarmerie were planning for the autumn becomes superfluous. The idea was to attack Bur Muhammad Kuan when the cold weather cese en ani if nscascery to occupy honar - takhteli &amp; Daliki by force of arms. When I travelled through thatthat region the Khans had almost made up their minds ~~ so their people said —- not to allow the Gendarmerie to advance, but to try the issue of a fight* Nor am I at all convinced ik that all would pass off well and that never again would any * muleteer on the whole road have to pay toll. I trust the Gendarmerie will advance victoriously to Bushire in the au - tumn. Another task: for the Gendarmerie is the chastisement of Muhammad Ali Khan,head of the Qashqulis,who is held re - sponsible for many a road robbery. Before a month is over the Qashqvni will Isavo their sunner habitat to the *-.W- of Shiraa and make for the plain westvrards and the lower valleys near Behbehan* It is then expected that the usyal deeds of violence common on such occasions will be committed. / especially Qa^am-ul-Mulk The adversaries of the Turk tribes Jjrrriiiqn i now wish the Gendarmerie to attack them before they reach winter quarters. If the idea is to advance against the Qashquli then undoubtedly the best plan would be to attack them whilst on the march. For in the country w hich they inhabit during the winter they have fastnesses at their disposal,and in view of their numbers it would be a very difficult matter to at tack them there. If such action be contemplated,it will naturally be kept a strict secret and I know nothine about it Finally I ought to say a word on the manner in which the Gendarmerie have fulfilled their task of keeping order on the caravan road. If on the one hand it iu to be noticed that there have been no robberies since their apparition (and this is also true for that part of the road which is not in their immediate protection) on the other hand one mustmust not onit to mention that certain reproaches are levelled at the®, instance the rmleteers complain that they are beaten and often compelled to stay in the caravanserais longer then necessary or only allowed to start at an inconvenient hour because such is the wish of the Gendarmes escorting it. It is also said to have happened that Gendarmes have 'bought 11 fitK sugar,tea and other necessaries from travellers at prices fixed by themselves. A Persian officer is even said to have given a village chief permission to levy road tolls on con - dition that he paid him 600 krans (£12) a month. As I heard this rumour in Kazerun myself I did not hesitate to inform the O.C.the regiment here in Shiraz. As a matter of fact the Persian officer in question has been recalled.- It must not be forgotten that Persia is the land of unlimited lying so that complaints of mufceteers and travellers are not to be taken too literally* But quite responsible persons have confirmed cases of arbitrary conduct on the part of the gendarnes. It is only natural that such cases should occur and least of all are ths Swedish officer:; to be tlaESi for thsE. -boy are obliged to leave too much to native officers,and however care fully the latter are selected it is unavoidable tlu.t than should slide back into their inborn norality and the customs of the country. I myself saw a harmless example. I was riding in Dashtarjin with* a smart young officer who made a very good impression on me,to a nomads 1 camp. On the way we met a man to whom the officer culled out as he rode past 'Tomorrow you bring me a lamb!'^ - '°n - be replied the father, folding his arms on his breast,'may your c kindness■ / ' ■ ' ■ '* a kindness be increased”. The officer explained to me th^t this roan had brought hiro false information and was being punished thus for his lie. The men I caroe in contact with on the/^road made an excellent impression on roe. Only in the neighbourhood of Shi raz there wesome people in the service who had been f#/- enlisted in the South. Their appearance and bearing left much to be desired,and I was glad to learn later that they had been withdrawn. When it becomes possible to get men from the mountain eers and independent tribes to join the service one will have c in the South also very fine material as regards physi/al capacity in a hot clin^to. Put for the present it is only safe to use men from the north. Copy to Tehran. Sd/- Wassrouse.tfir (Prom Governor German E.Africa to Colonial Office Berlin). No.1223. Revolution in Oman. Dar-es-Salam,10/7/1913. I send Y.E.translation of certain articles in the Arab paper H E1 Najah' published in Zanzibar,on the subject of the revolution which has broken out in Oman. Some weeks ago rumours of the same reached this place,but now we have fuller details. Ihe ex-Sultan Khalid bin Barghash,who lives here,also has news,including a personal letter from Sultan Faisal bin Turki of Muscat,which confirm generally the newspaper announce ment alluded to above. I assume that the Foreign Office is kept informed by the Imperial Consulates in the Persian Gulf 7 Basra and Zanzibar,but would suggest that this material also be placed at the disposal of the Foreign OffIceland the Press. For the proper understanding of the situation in Oman I would add the fcllOTTing * Sultan Said bin Sultan of Muscat and Zanzibar (1804—1856) concluded commercial treaties and treaties of amity with France in the years 1807 &amp; 1817 and these were expanded in a fresh treaty dated lv 44. ».»ince that time France has been the only purveyor of Arms and ammunition for Oman,whence they went partly into the interior of Arabia, partly to India, ^his latter smuggling business the English have never been able entirely to suppress* In 1912 the English Government made a treaty vrith Francs whsrety French ships should import no more arms into Muscat. Sultan Faisal was at that time compelled by the presence of three Enclish men-of-war to agree to this franco-english agreement. The Arabs in the interior of Oman,who had maintained a degree of independence I Vi£&gt; ~ VkS j _ . 4 -■s it ^ ItaNfvis a vis oultdii Faisai| fearftd 'they would lose tlie sarae aud openly gave ■the ^ullian £0 understand their discontent* Now they have set up an Imam in the person of Salim bin Rashid el j^harnsl, the ncTsasat hein; led by tho blicd but very learned Abdullah bin Hanid es Salimi. The last Irian (or head of the Islamic community as such,formerly always the same wit a the Sultan in Oman) was Said bin Ahmad who died somewhere between 1811 and 1821. His successors in Muscat and Zanzibar did not get themselves elected Imam by the Oman community but contented themselves with the title of Seyyid (’’Lord'). Now if an Imam is again set up who seems to wish to dethrone the Sultan as such,that proves that the Ibadis (all the Oman Arabs belong to this Sect) have awakened out of their late religious indifference (they have become the most tolerant of all Muhammadans) and again become conscious of their democratic puritanism. As soon as the first news got abroad England &amp; France offered Sultan Faisal their assistance (Muscat is now in telegraphic communication) but the latter declined,knowing the consequences of any European intervention (prophesied by the above-mentioned paper) namely lods of political independenco'* Fighting in Oman began with the capture of the fort of Nizwa,which was held by a governor of Sultan Faisal called Saif bin Ahmad who belongs to the royal family of the El Abu Saidi. 2he wounded Saif bin Ahmad cut his throat when the place fell. The fort of Nizwa,the former capital of the country,was according to the old chronicles built by Imam Sultan bin S a if who died in 1668,at a cost of many hundred thousand pieces of gold and tooj^lS years to build. It vras reckoned the strongest Arab fort in the whole of °outh Arabia. The'I Iff*; V ’ 'H !'■, ,f ’^!i lV v.t o / 1 ., ;¥■ P 8 ) The towns which fell away from Sultan Faisal are not situated in the interior highlands but partly on the coast,e.g. es-Sur: this is serious in so far as Indian merchants are established in the larger coast towns,but not in the interior. So that if the bazars were looted England would have a sufficient excuse for intervening to protect her Indian subjects. The prospects of Sultan Faisal,who has already sent several of his grown-up sons against the rebels in order to suppress the movement,are for the most part not thought here to be very bright. More follows. Sd/- Schnee. (From the ?(same to the same). No.1299. Dar-es-Salara,18/7/13. In continuation of my 1233 of the 10th instant on the subject the revolution i- Oman,I have the honour to report to Y.E. that according to later news Sultan Faisal of Muscat has sent out his sons Hamud,Hamad,Nadir and Timur and also &amp; relation of his Hamud bin Azzan against Nizwa in different columns to fight the new Imam. These columns,vrhich are marching from various directions,are to join hands eventually , the first battle will probably take place near Azka,close to Nizwa. Simultaneously the Egyptian paper El Ikbal gives the following interesting news : M The English Consul (whether from Muscat,Koweit or elsewhere,it doesn’t say) proceeded to the iand of Nejd to see the Wahaby Emir (Ibn Saud family) arm after long negotiation received from him permission to enter the town ( Er-Rfcad,the capital,is meant) . The Consul is al leged to have proposed to the Emirf that he should sell Oman to the English and asserting that Oman formerly belonged to the Ibn Saud. The Emir is reported to have declined the^suggestll'v; i r «: ' f r:- 1G'- ion'. On this I would remark that Oman never belonged to the Wahaby Emirs but only paid them tribute from time to time. Should this news be confirmed it would be a new and clever move on the part of the English to mix themselves up in the internal affairs of Oman in opposition to the wishes of Sultan Faisal,in order in the long run to get possession of the country itself and therewith the key to the Persian Gulf. Sd/~ Schnee. Extract from*El-Najah’ , Nos.72-74* “Disturbances in Oman'. No.72. The report is spread in Zanzibar that Oman is dis - turbed. She Sultan of Muscat,Faisal bin Turki,has telegraphed to the Sultan of Zanzibar,Khalif bin Harb,that Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamid es Salimi has captured the fort of Nizwa,the strong est in Oman,and that Saif bin Ahmad ei-Abu-Saidi the Wali of Nizwa has committed suicide. The telegram however contained no explanation of how Shaikh es Salimi was able to take/^the fort. We cannot thinking the ^nrrison on his side and surrendered to him without resistance. When the Wall,who was outside the town,heard the news he committed suicide to avoid disgrace. That is our supposition. Several reports have reached us of the Oman tribes having come together and made common cause. But it is Shaikh es Salimi who worked most conspicuously for this. A year ago,when he heard of Italy's invasion of Tripoli and the subsequent Balkan war,and when the agreement of the w Sultan of Muscat and the English,whereby arms traffic r^as pro hibited, stirred up bitter feeling all/ round in Oman,he seized the opportunity,travelled through most places in Oman,visited thethe Chiefs of the tribes and inspired them with the spirit of independence and organisation ; for he dreaded the con - sequences of the arms prohibition. W e have often mentioned this in 'Al-^ajah' and advined the Sultan cf Muscat to be of one mind with his people. But this is the first re - suit of the Oman movement. It is also rumoured that all the will tribes karts gather**# together in Nizwa tp sake au ImaiD th^ir jSuprgEig who shall with them enter the path of organi sation and defence. This Imam is to be a man from the tribe of Beni Kharus. Our dread of the harm in this affair out - weighs the prospect of advantage which it might bring. For we fear certain persons representing low interests will so in fluence Seyyid Faisal that he will place himself under the protection of a foreign power which would mean the end of the independence of Oman. We also fear that the unity of the tribes will not last for long,for they know nothing of events abroad or of the intrigues which surround them but would be / h fooled by the presents they receive* ^e pray Alla^ to ir prove the situation. We also expect from the keen intelli gence and practical knowledge of Seyyid Faisal that he should quickly come to an undsratanding with the trihas cf Cnan and grant them all their demands for reform,that is to say large that he should establish a s*a** school in every town and a small one in every village , appoint just judges who she..— judge in accordance with the law and God^ justice and open an advisory assembly without whose consent he should under take nothing. It is also necessary that he should entrust the Oman chiefs with the higher offices. In this way his kingdom(si) kingdom would progress without disturbances and he would be laying the foundations of a happy future for his children and subjects. Sultan Seyyid Faisal should not forget that a Prince has to deal with his subjects,for when the nation ri ses against its prince life becomes unbearable and the state ceases to exist. W© trust H.H.will not neglect these things and beware of placing himself under the protection of a foreign Power but let him tails an erar^ils free the r aat. But we have every confidence that he will be reconciled with Shaikh es Salimi and the Oman tribes shortly and hand in hand with them advance to reform his country. No.73. In the beginning of the month Jaraadi II* Abdul Aziz it bin Saud fell upon the town of 'el Ihsa' and captured^without much opposition. The casualties were 25 soldiers. H© then sent a force to El Kuteif and took it. No.74. The revolution in Oman has made thinking men dumb and confounded the wise. Every true believer is struck by this fate. Is it not the greatest of evils when a state is divided against itself ? It goes to destruction more swiftly than runnine water. Such conditions have spread thenselves in Onan. Therefore divisions reicn anonc tribes of Oman and increase robbery,violence and the shedding of blood. The MOYCi j Wit i “ deeds is no longer in a position so to do because revolution is rife in the land. Thus Oman totters to her ruin. Zealous counsellors have not yet ceased to help Government with writtenwritten and verbal counsels ; but their words were unheeded However small a country may be or however rude its inhabitants,it never ceases to azKXi£zER call into existence people who sacrifice themselves for their country. Thus the blind but learned Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamid es Salimi has come forward to deliver his fatherland. This man lost his sight in his second year,but this was no disadvantage to him,the his writings witness to the keenness of his spiritual sight and understanding. In the middle of last year he formed a litin at the head of which he appointed Shaikhs Ali bin Saleh and Muhsin bin Amir. This ail144ft visited the tribes one by one gave them good advice and warned them against the deadly European plague. They also advised them to unite to ^ gether,advised them to avoid dissensions and obtained from them a promise so to act until he had realised his ideas. Shaikh es Salimi with some of his faithful companions visited the int erior of Oman,the towns of Kabhat-et-Tenuf,Manah,Azka,Alhamra, the towns of Beni Hana and Bend&gt; Shukeil and ceased not to warn and laboujf until all the dwellers in town and dessert the Hanawites and Ghafrites joined hi*. What helped him,was the prohibition of the arms traffic,through which the hatred of thetribes was brought to a flane. Then Shaikh es ^aliwi I rose up as before menltioned last Jemadi H. and travelled through the country at the head of neru He canr, to and made a truce between Himyar and Abs. Thence he went to Tenuf whose chief is Shaikh Himyar bin Naser en Nabhani. This nan received him with joy, obeyed his words and made Shaikh6 k (§3) S' SaliP)_bin Rashid el Kharu^i In)an. This nan was selected by Shaikh es Salirai ; for he had instructed hin for years and educated hin to be the protector of the Muslins and of the country* The elected Inan bound hiraseif to nake strong and weak equal,to act according to God's law and that of His prophet and to strive after piety. Then he was recognised by Hirayar and his adherents Shaikh et Attabi,the chief of Bahia and many tribal chiefs. Thereupon he summoned the Vali o#* Rizwa to join him and surrender his fortress. The Vali asked for l/V% days' grace dttrwg which Ii» uuiA'fl inform the Sultan thj^t the (b mr inhabitants tMj* bad jsihoi the and Utitt ask for help. Put he himself fled into the mosque. When the fmltan's messensers returned,the Imam seized them in el-Birka and kept them prisoner. In this way none of them was able to brine news into Nizwa and so the town surrendered to the Imam and the W a li committed suicide as mentioned above. But those persons whom the Imam had summoned to recognisehira .were the dwellers in er-Rastak,Wadi'1 Maawil.Hakhl.Barka^amma and Shaikh Khalil Bismail. But the inhabitants of Nakhl chose 15 persons to do homage to the Imam. In the same way the people of Janma select ed 10 persons as their representatives. The rest sent the writ ten summons of the Imam to the Sultan and asked him for instructions. But Shaikh Isa and his adherents kept quite quiet. If the action taken by Shaikh esS/falimi be good P there is a tine ^ or But God tically, nevertheless/ everything.x» x / knows his exculpation better. T be Sultan met this fate with a high heart and - *. - • ■Pnr* thG yQ—Gf was not confounaeci » his reign he has learnt to know the times. Besides which he has(}f \U has an unshakeable courage. So he sent his son Seyyid Nadir to 'nan well provided with Ken and arrs. He ordered him to attack the enemy at the head of the tribes who had remained faithful as ^soon as he had reached a suitable place for an attack. He also furnished Hnad f Hsnud with war material de and orjMred them to take the^road to San*a and El Awabi, to hasten to the assistance of Seyyid Ahmed bin Ibrahim, who had refused to recognise the Imam,but who was too fast asleep to know that his fortress had fallen into the hands of the Beni Hana and that of El Hazm into those of the Ibrites who were the first to join the Imam. But what is very note - worthy and leaves a bright spot in the Sultan’s history,is that when the revolution broke out the Great Pflwsrs offered the Sultan their kelp against the Europeans ostensibly to uphold his rule in the interior of the country,but ±hfi Sylias declined and excused himself &gt; for he realised that this interference would have brought about the downfa11 of the administration, ^he whole ifruharamadan world thanks the sultan for this,for that he acted in such a difficult situation with H courajp and understanding. [Wassmuss Shiraz to Chancellor Berlin). Ko.A 22 m Shiraz,25/0/9/13. I have the honour to forward for Y.E’s information a cutting from the weekly edition of the 'Times of India , 20 August,which contains a description of the origin and causes of the rising in Muscat. The agreement which the English Government has forced upon Sultan Seyyid Faisal,inorder to suppress the arras traffic in Muscat,has proved a fatal thing for him. According to the latest news from Bushire the tribes in the interior have deposed him and raised Seyyid Salim bin Rashid El Khurusi to the rank of Sul tan and the latter appears to have selected for the nonce Kasba Tanuf for his seat of government. Except for Muscat and Mattrah the whole country is in the hands of the rebels and even these two towns are only prevented by the presence of English troops from taking sides against the Sultan. Of the English troops,in addition to the 2nd Rajputs transferred from Bushire to Muscat,1000 indian soldiers are now to be sent from Bombay to relieve the 2nd Rajputs in Muscat when the latter are withdraw n. Also the S00 European troops which I mentioned in my despatch No.18 of the 7th ult. (and which would appear to be marines) are to be withdrawn. I have not been able to gather any more details owing to my distance ^rom Muscat. 1 zznnot even check the statements in the newspaper cutting. According to this last,Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamid Es Salirai is the head of the Ibadite tribes and declared a holy war against the Sultan in May because the latter vras favouring the government and institutions of the Christians. The uprising started in the village of Eanuf near Nizvra and embraces the districts of Hinavriya and Beni Ghafi. The article aloO _&lt;.yo emphasis on the fact that the inhabitants of Muscat and Matrah themselves are by no means faithful to the Sultan. The hemm ing in of the Sultan*3 son,which 1 reported in my despatch of the 7th August,is said to have taken place in the village of Saraail (Ismail) . It isj;36) It is significant in connection with the causes of this uprising that the first deraand of the rebels in reply to the Sultan was the abolition of the Arms Traffic decree,and that according to their wish the Sultan must make no agree- ment of any kind whatever with ^hristian states* Now will England officially declare a protectorate over Muscat and will Prance,to whom England has guaranteed the Sultan's independency,approve ? latterly the Tn^srial Consulate has had much correspondence with the Sultan. One case is the claim of the merchant Adolf Frank of Hamburg presented by the Foreign Office,there are also enquiries after and disposal of the inheritance of heirs of Arabs who have died in German East Africa* The settlement of all these cases will presumable be impossible for some time owing to present war conditions. Copy to Tehran WASSMUSSNo.A 23 * prn Visit to Solat ud Dovrleh and a note on the Qlfashqai. (Fro** ^assmtisc -hiras to EcrlirJ# Shiraz 27/9/13. On my return from an expedition to the ruins of Persepolis (some 40 miles N.E.of Shiraz) last week I met some wandering Qashqais returning from their summer pastures to winter quarters. As it so happened that the Ilkhani of the Qashqai (Solat ud D.) had pitched his tents in the immediate neighbourhood I thought I ought not to miss the opportunity of paying him a visit and raking his acvaaintancs. I there - fore rode in the afternoon,accompanied by a Mirza ; a servant and two gendarmeatWhon the Officer Commanding had placed at my disposition,to Solat's camp. As I only meant to stay half an hour with him,I sent on my caravan to a neighbouring vill age wherji I proposed to pass the night. Solat received me very roomy with the utmost coirtesy in a/tent beautifully furnisher wi carpets. X informed that X had found myself quite by accident in his neighbourhood in the course of my journey,and die not wish to neglect the opportunity of paying him a visit. Bjere-upon he said hejfwaSB delighted but that it was quite im possible for me to return that same day. I must according to nomad custom be his guest for the night. He ** aside all ny excuses and when I was convinced that he would think it im polite if I rode away again after a brief visit I agreed to remain until the next morning. Prom the very beginning X made it clear that I bad come not as German Consul,but as a private individual. TUs Howctsr ^ ** ^showing ne honours which were undoubtedly intended for my capacity as German Consul* At the evening banquet,at which in usual nomad fashion we sat on the ground and were brought mountains of rice cooked in various ways and numerous other dishes,several of his officials and many Persian grandees who were in camp /were present , and although a Seyyid from Shiraz was one of the guests Solat drank to the health of H.M.the Kaiser in excellent Shiraz wine -- which for him as a Muhammadan is a forbidden beverage. Next morning a young stallion,a carpet and \ tvfo small rugs were brought me as presents (see separate desp. C39). In spite of the early morning hour and although I had taken ray leave of him overnight,Solat appeared in person and thanked rae again for my visit. More than 30 horsemen and his Vizier accompanied me to the village where my caravan awaited me* Not only was it a sight worth seeing to behold the thou sands &amp; thousands of Qashqai^ tents with innumerable nerd.^ of sheep cattle donkeys and camels which enlivened the plain as far as the eye could see,but also ray visit to Solat (or Persian Sardar-i-Ashair,or Commander of the Tribes,as his new/tit^e is) was most instructive from many points of view* He had pitched his camp on an elevation which allowed the eye to rove freely over the plain. Here the tents stood so thickly on a large site that they gave one the impression of a town. Instead of the usual black nomad tents of goat's hair , which are very simply and mostly entirely open on one side,here I saw white tents and several of majestic appearance and great size. The tent to which I was conducted and which is only usedused for guests,had a room in the centre which could be connected by roll-up curtains with the surrounding rooms. The floor was covered with fine-woven carpets;camp chairs and a table were concessions to European visitors. Solat is a man of very tall and stately figure, with moustache,of fresh appearance and might be 35 to 40 years of age. His clothes and headgear are the usual Persian ones, but I noticed black patent leather shoes of European make lax which Persian men &amp; women seem to be particularly fond. His attitude was one sf natural coujtssy, which in the course of our conversation repeated expressions of friendship. He willingly gave me information about the various Qashqai tribes,their numbers etc. But when I turned the conversation on the approaching elections he declared that he took no in - terest in politics. It was evident that he attached little importance to the Elections. In the former Parliament the Qashqais were represented by one deputy,thou C b I believe the tribes are entitled to several. u on The talk also turned naturally a?® the arms question and he asked why Germany allowed the English to tak , ^Wc.y the arms in the Persian Gulf when a larfce ^ proportion of them came from Germany. X answered that the Persian Government itself had prohibited the import of arm;,. By the way amon C st the Qashqais I only saw marine rifles, some Mausers and others of English make. Solat told me with a certain emphasis that each Qashqai had “only' one rifle. . 4 . ^o of convcrwativ- Ssvftra! ticoo i- the col.~. - ^ tn reirn in Southern Persia, remarked that he desired peace to reig v 4 . 4 -hou^ht of the Gendarmerie he On my asking him what he « mnrh to be welcomed. He assured me said their presence was much to . ofof his loyalty to the Shah. An interesting remark of his was picked up by my Mirza, vrho understands Turkish. In the course of the banquet the Serdar said to his Vizier in Turkish (which he thought nobody un4erstood but his Qashqais) ' I only greet the German in this cordial fashion because Germany does not interfere in Persian affairs like Russia and England and does not threaten the coun try”. I gained the impression that Solat is conscious of his responsibility towards the Persian state. He expressed this li years ago to Dr Listemann when in BushireC see Ho.4 dated 21/1/1D11). I am convinced that he would only attach himself to England if compelled thereto by smashing defeats. At the present I fancy he has no desire to attack his Persian foes, Qawara-ul-^ulk on the contrary zzzzz to to intriguing against him with the Governor General. This brings me to the question of the power possessed by Solat over the Qashqais and of the force he could dispose of in the case of warlike complications. I was told by his English- speaking Mirza,who is in his service and teaches English to his nine-year old son,that the movement in favour of Zeigham- ud-Douleh last year was solely initiated and rendered possible h by Qawam. ^eigham had absolutely no adherents whatever among the Qashqai ; the Qawam had prepared a regiment with two cannon against Solat. But although the latter disarmed the small de - tachment of Gendarmerie which had foolishly been despatched against hin in Siyakh (my No.8 dated 8/8/19X2) and although hi&gt;s road to the summer pastures was open, he yet returned to Firuzafcad with half his Qashqaia so as to avoid a fight between Qashqai and Qashqai,as Keigham had in the meantime been ap pointed from Tehran Ilkhani at the instigation of Qawam-ul-Mulk who50 '•’’ii! Jilfiljr 3, I f. ■: ;• pi) who at that t5.^a wcs in charge cf the ^cvcrnment in Shi - raz. When Qawam saw that he could not attain his object,being himself hard pressed by other enemies he hastened to make peace with Solat* ^hereupon Mukhbir-us-Sul-tanehjWho had meanwhile been appointed Governor General for Pars,thought that in the circumstances of the case the obvious thing to do vms to move Tehran to re-appoint Solat Ilkhani. In the spring Qawam de- the feated his Arab adversaries with/help of the Governor General and slew their leaders,his hands are therefore now free to deal with Solat. (see despatch 20 of the 8th ult.). Already therefore his half brother and rival Solat-es-Sultaneh arri ved in town some days ago with 200 horsemen and has opened ne gotiations with the Governor General. It would in my opinion be much to be regretted if the Governor General gave way to Qawam’s influence anc. his plausible reasons and adopted a hostile attitude towards Solat. For the latter has honestly shown his desire to live at peace with the Government. According to hio !'irsa ho has al ready this year paid 72,000 tomans taxes. ®he Finance Agent told me that actually 30,000 Ts (about £ 6000) had been re - ceived from him and more was expected. 1 savr in his camp two tents full of prisoners with beautiful shining chain., round their necks or ankles,and I was told that besides thieves etc. some of them were Chiefs and Elders who were behindhand in the payment of their taxes. Doubtless also Solat endeavours to prevent the migrating QashqaiS from committing excesses , and it is acknowledged on all siOes that this year the mi - gration passed off exceptionally quietly. 1I learned yesterday that Solat has already Written to the mer chants of Shiraz drawing attention to his own exertions and warning them not to join his enemies. The decision of the English Consul will perhaps be the turning point. Tt iz Trail kncrn^ that con^laintc are being raised again and again in the English Parliament and Press because the attic!?: on Consul Smart in December 1911 has not yet been avenged. It is also a matter of common knowledge that the authors of the attack were Qashquli. As these are guilty of other robberies there would be good reason for taking action against them and their leader Muhammad Ali Khan. Obviously Solat will be compelled to deliver up Muhammad Ali Khan or at least cause his tribe to be punish»€W&amp;U But it is easy to un - derstand that he is not keen on doing this and refuses to so long as others are endeavouring to undermine his position. Also he is related to Muhammad Ali inasmuch as he and his bro ther married two sisters, the/?daughters of the respected Qash quii grandee Haji Abdullah.- If the English Consul presses for the punishment of the Qashquli then the Gendarmerie,who are Q under English influence,must take the field,and ^awam will probably think the moment a good one for falling upon Solat. In view of the good ba^ T' If &lt;3 ^ ^ paacaable^ development signs of which have been seen this year such a course of things would be highly regrettable. So tha-t if England regards the 1 restoration of order in Persia as the most important matter she will not seek compensation (for the Smart affair) from So- good lat and will mate /her claims against the Qashquli in some less dangerous fashion. In my opinion England would do well,if she is in earnest/ ¥ * earnest about the maintenance of Persian independence , to and her.perverted policy lay upon herself/the blame of the various incidents which have occurred and renounce the idea of compensation. Details which I heard here in connection with the attack on Smart make it clear that it was only a step taken against the mili- — — ^ tary occupation of Shiraz. It is astounding,but was confirmed to me with all details by the English employees of the Imper - ial Bank of Persia,that the sum of 500,000 krans was allowed to pass by the Qashqulis Although only one muleteer was in / l*'*'v&gt; is yi ^ charge,whilot the Indian sowars ted been put to flight. They even fixed the proper number of the mules and declared they would not seize upon the property of the Shah (because the bank is called M imperial M ). Neither was the attack directed against Consul Smart. After he had received his wound he was brought to Muhammad Ali Khan's camp and tended by him. Indeed Mr Smart was so touched by the hospitable kindness shown him that ha save tti his hsst his sus as a present. Tot apparently the attack was got up by Muhammad Ali Khan and that when drunk. He is said to have asked whether the Qashqulis were such cow ards as to allow the country to be garrisoned withodt opposit ion. Then without his knowledge a number of warriors rose up and made the attek,whereby - by the way - the whole winter equipment of the Shiraa squadron fell into their hands. My statement in despatch No.19 of the 4th ulto., which I got from the Governor General,that Solat could only raise some 600 armed men from his immediate followers,I would now wish to alter insofar as to say that this small number would be at his disposal if he were compelled to defend himself against the Governor General or the Government. SoSo Ions as his rank of Ilkhani is confirmed by the Govern ment the number of his fightins men is much gteater.In the plain of Beiza where he was I saw thousands of tents,and these all belonged to the M amaleh M literally 'labourers” that is to say Qashqais personally subordinate to the Ilkhani,who pay no taxes* According to Solat's Mirza the number of Sol^t's 'amaleh' is over 10,000 tents : an impartial person put them at 7 to 8,000 . Every tent represents at least one armed man, at least every tenth tent a mounted man. As the whole Qashqai people must count rather more than less than 50,000 tents flCLv^ in case of war with an outside enemy one vrould frhv+r to reckon with a Oashqai army sf fivs or tan thousand ncunted and 50,000 unmounted men* Copy to Tehran.

Opening of the Artillery Barracks*— of the new barracks of the 3rd Gendarmerie Regiment a fete was held,including a parade of the companies quartered in the town. The following took part : 375 infantry 350 cavalry and 100 artillery i.e. a battery of machine guns (4) t d two 8 cm Scnei|fers and two 7 cm Austrian mountain guns, all officers and men reported by me in my A 19 of the 4th August, there are at present other 200 men of the 2nd company, who about a month ago at the time of the tribal migration were sent to Kazerun^and T umarij by ray of rsinforcenest . cipal merchants and clergy, as well as the European colony,vrere invited to the/parade and the fete. The leader of the Regt, Major Uggla,made a speech in which he conjured the gendarmes in view of their great expense to Government to do their duty and accept with cheerfulness the fatigues that lay before tnen The march to Bushire would take place so soon as they were fully equipped with clothing.** The 10th November has been selected for the departure from Shiraz to Bushire.- The march past of the troops was well carried out, they inspire confidence,the horses are good ; the mules caused Shiraz 25/10/13 On the 22nd October on the occasion of the opening On the road to Bushire,in addition to the 472 The Persian authorities,notables of Shiraz,prin - somesome confusion by nearly bolting when the guns were fired and were with difficulty kept in order. After the parade came inspection of the stables,barracks &amp;c. These are mainly buildings dating from the time of Kerim Khan Zend , they are very suitable for the ^ur^osa and nuch stronger than modern erections. Major Hggla showed the Governor General round &amp;c* This was done very smartly,and one had the impression e that the Swedish officers had succeeded in instilling good dis cipline into the men. After the inspection tea, sweets and fruits vrere handed round. It should be mentioned that the higher clergy , the Imam - Juma and the Shaikh ul Islam,were present at the function and even allowed the band of the Persian troops to pa* play in their presence. This,the Governor General told me,was the first time the clergy in Shiraz had shown such toleration. At the same time I must mention the behaviour of another Mullah , who tpre in pieces the invitation of a Gendarmerie officered by 'unbelievers? As the Governor General informed me,many of the clergy on re ceipt of the invitation had asked him what to do. Qawam-ui f ulk has made was also present at this fete which/B*«*ii*e*jte treat impression on the people and (it is to be hoped) inclined them favourably towards the Gendarmerie* Capt.Pousette arrifced here a few days aeo.also a former Swedish Sereeant Major who is to look after the shoeing and doctoring of the horses in the HHMU cavalry.No*A 24 # (Wassmuss Shirar. to Berlin)* SITUATION IN PARS Shiraa 26/10/13* The last few weeks have been of decisive importance for the political situation in Pars inasmuch as the migrations of the nomad tribes,Qashqai especially,to their winter quarters passed off without any incidents* Por a time it seemed probable that the tranquillity of the province would be disturbed by measures taken against Solat ud Dowleh* Men spoke of the II ~ khaniship being taken away from him and given to his brother Solat us Sultaneh* Fortunately this,which would have had evil consequences for Fars,){2M was not done* As I pointed out in my despatch A 23 dated 27th ult. on the subject of my visit to Solat, intrigues on the ^rt of were net wanting. But So lat had the Finance Agent to intercede wtfith the Governor G e nl. for him,having already paid him 50,000 Tomans of taxes and pro— m raised a similar amount later on . As the Gendarmerie too is on good terras with Solat AM and Col Hjalmarson is very friendly with him,the Governor General has perhaps decided to oppose the atteks directed against him because he saw that open hos tility aeainst him would in all the circumstances be a politi cal mistake. Ho doubt Maj. O'Connor the English Consul thought the same and wisely exercised no pressure upon the Governor- General. X have never been able to understand personally ex - actly what Solat is accused of. They say he has seized C i.e. appropriated the revenues of) certain villages which belonged to the Government. But in S.Persia the ownership of vast tracts isis highly doubtful and exactly the same complaint is made against Qawam as against Solat. Che latter's worst crime seems to be that in spite of the Governor General's summons he has not entered the town. Prom Beiza (where I visited him) he came some 3 weeks ago quite close to Shiraz on his way to Firuzabad and encamped for a whole week only one day's journey from the town. According to general opinion he could safely have obeyed the Governor's mandate and entered the town for the settlement of questions. But/ Bolat vrculd not take the risk,he feared treachery and like a thorough nomad he distrusts every place surrounded by 4 walls. In vain did the Finance Agent ride out to his camp and go bail for his safety if he entered the town : in vain also did certain respectable merchants and the Karguaar visit him (with the same object). Major Uggla of the Gendarmerie also visited him outside. But all they got from him was that he sent in a few thousand tomans taxes. Chey say that 5000 tomans of the amount was for the Governor General himself. But on the other hand Sola t is very avaricious and it is therefore doubtful whether he would have incurred such expense. When I visited the Gov ernor some time ago and asked him about his meeting with So lat he remarked : ' Chat man will yet give us headaches ' • But lately he told me Solat had not acted very foolishly in refusing to come into town : but then he himself did not insist on it. Of deposing him (from the Ilkhaniship) he never thought for one monsut. Che Qawam too has not achieved his goal in the above matter. Also it is much feared that the Governor General has gonegone too far already in his dependence on him : it is difficult here to bo above all parties as the Governor General announced he intended to be,especially when one accepts douceurs from them* But in comparison with his predecessors the present Gov ernor General finds hincslf in a nuch coro favourable position because the parties now have to reckon with a new fact or in the Gendarmerie* Although the Governor cannot straight away use this military fprce for his own purposes (as he very much wishes to do) yet when the parties attack him he can in his official capacity as representative of his Government brand one of the parties as insurgents and move Tehran to send the Gendarmerie against them. So there is no doubt that the mere presence of the Gendarmerie strengthens the position of the Governor and constitutes a certain guarantee,however feeble, for peace in the land* Before it was settled that Solat would come to Shiras the Governor General and Qawani had cone to an agreenent together about the collection of the taxes in bar and the southern pro vinces of Pars for this and next year,according to which Qawan undertook to collect annually 309,000 Tomans (about £ 41,600) from the inhabitants of this territory and the Khanseh tribes d rho jSwell there. The conditions laid down by hin ore a :ommentary on the pitiful condition of the Persian Government ind the tremendous power which the latter gives to the. loco.1 ie ads of parties. Of the 209,000 Tonans. Qawan was to keep not less than VS,000 T s : (£ 14,600) the first year and Ts 53,000 (£ 14,600) the second year. In addition the Government was to furnish him with 200 foot soldiers,150 sowars and 25 artillery men with one gun and a machine gun and also pay the men. All otlierother expenses to be at his own charge. When it is renembered that governors have to the amount of the tunes without delay and live on what they they squeeze out of the people in addition it is seen what a good thing Qawam makes out of the commission. But he was not content with it. When he saw that he could not compass the downfall of Solat,he declared that he would not go to Lar if Solat pursued his way to Firuzabad unpunished, and in the end he only agreed when new conditions were made in his favour. Firstly the Governor General was to give him a writing that he was justified in proceeding against Seyyid Abdul Hussein Lari the leader of the insurgents during the revaluation four years ago in any way that seemed good to him if the Seyyid did not leave the town of Lar of his own accord,in other words permission to undertake a punitive expedition during which as usual in such cases numerous villages would be burned down and plundered and all the property of the inhabitants seized by the conqueror. He asserted further that the Government's taxation lists were incorrect and that according to his lists the total came to some 26,000 tomans less, and hs obtains! the reduction of the sum to be paid by him by one half o« the difference i.a.13,000 tomans (about £ 2600). Mow he is making arrangements to march to LAR next week* That the Government sends Qawam south instead of another person who would not make such claims as these,xs bound up with the great influence and following possessed bp the Q^wam family for centuries amongst the inhabitants of those districts and the Khamseh tribes. An attempt was made to get Qawam to agree to his son (who since his brother* s murder was known as Maser ul M u lk) being sent to Lar,as he was inclined to more favourable conditions ; but Qawam opposed this curi.l&gt;.a I profited by the despatch of Qawam to Lar to reciini the Lar &amp; Bastak Governor General of the/clairas of Messrs.WSnckhaus Lingah which come to about £ 1250 and were presented by the Legation to the Persian Government four years ago,and to request H.E. to entrust with their collection* I propose during the next few days to mention the matter to Qawam himself. Meanwhile the Governor General has promised me verbally to do what he can. Sen days ago General Amir ul Mulk was sent with sev - eral hundred soldiers and specially engaged riflemen and a gun to Mamasennija district north of the Shiraz-Bushire road between the Kazerun district and Bakhtiari land,to collect the taxes. The amount to be paid in this district totals 13,747 tomans (£ 2750). I hear that at the same time the General was commiss ioned by the well-known Moin ut Tujjar who owns nearly the whole of Mamasenni (there is a dispute on this point between him and the Persian Government) with thetf collection of his re venues from the villages. As for other districts of the province of Pars , viz. Dashtistan D as hti Gelladar,which embrace the plain along the coast of the Persian Gulf from the border of Arabiptan in the north to near Lingah in the south,the collection of the taxes as this represents tis only fora of Goverrent acti vity, practically the administration^) has very * MX wisely been entrusted to the Governor of Bushire. In the inter ests of the administration of the districts in question this is to be welcomed with joy and it confirms the regulation of the Governor General of Pars who had handed over Tangistan af - fairs to the Bushire Governor. The taxes due from these districtsQ are 31,954 Ts for Dashti Dashtistan,6,955 for Gelladar,about 7,750 £ in all.Another 5,012 T s is as before paid in Shiraz direct by the district concerned. To all appearance this change has had excellent re - suits. The consulate Mirza in Bushire reports that Seyyid Mur- teza the notorious revolutionary leader has congratulated Muwaqqar-ud-Dowleh (Bushire Governor) on the transfer,and Shaikh Hussein Khan of Ahmedi has himself come to Bushire with his taxes and received a costly shawl from the Governor as a present. It is surprising that the Governor should now have entrusted the administration,i.e.collection of taxes,of Tancistan and T)ashti tc 'z\r Miliar of AHRA” , ofter failing to «ndow wit'n real power the Haidar Khan nerttioned in my^'lV . To ne the Measure seems in order,for thereby the Governor is saved much strife, t Gn the other hand one sees once more from this example how quickly in Persia a rebel fighter can be called to rank and honour.- I believe Muwaqqar-ud-Dowleh to be an official from whose administrat ion of the coast districts and especially of unruly Tangistan much good is to be hoped. The Governor General has taken the first step tow the parliamentary elections by issuing two proclamations on the subject of the town elections. But he seems to be act - ing on the principle of 'festina lente' and told me he was modelling himself on Tehran ; until he heard that elections were proceeding in Tehran he would undertake nothing m Shi raz TheThe state of affairs on the Bushire-Shiraz road has re - mained unchanged during the last fevf months. Security has pre vailed on the part not guarded by Bendarmerie. My prognosticat ion (vide my Ho.10 dated 4/8/13,page 12) that tolls would be paid still has swiftly bien justified . -ur Muhammad Khan of Daliki only refrained from collecting these tolls for 21 days,after which he resumed their collection because the money promised for payment of his men did not arrive from Shiraz. A A fortnight since Ghazanfer us Sultaneh also began to levy T-mli-nirir- — I in, L I II I road tolls at the high rate of 7 krans per mule. The reason for this is that he was unable to come to an agreement with the Shiraz Government about the number of his men-at-arms to be paid for. It may however be assumed that this question of oayment will soon be adjusted and that then tolls in Daliki Borazjun will disappear. According to the present arrangement Government has to pay these two Khans 690 tomans a month (about £ 138). Otherwise the Gendarmerie will have to interpose its authority. They intend to start off on the 10th November for Bushire to take over the part of the road not yet guarded by them. It is quite likely that then the action of the Khans may lead to a collision. Ths Meginont will tic following strength on the march to Bushire : 450 foot,250 mounted, 75 artillery with two 8 c.m.guns and 4 machine guns,whUst 480 men including 134 mounted remain on the road between here and Kumarij. Arising out of the murder (or homicide through negli*' £ ence) of a Seyyid by a negro in the service of the Gendarmerie an incident very nearly occurred several weeks ago between thethe Gendarmerie and the Governor General whereby the latter (presumably on account of the threatening attitude of the towns people) had the negro illegally slain,in fact had his throat cut in prison,and the younger Swedish officers succeeded in the most energetic manner in having the corpse handed over to them. A few days cn the occasion of tho opening of a barracks built for the Gendarmerie a fete was held which may perhaps contribute towards tke making the Gendarmerie more beloved of the people. A parade was held &amp;c.,&amp;c.,. I have reported the parade &amp;c. to the Imperial Minister in Tehran. The financial position of the province is distinctly improved from last year although in some districts taxes had to be partially remitted on account of the poor harvest. The revenue for the first five months of the new year (starting March 21) was about 175,000 Ts (35,000 £) in rates and taxes, whereas last year only 89,000 Ts (about £ 18.000) came in. The income and the expenditure of the Administration (exclu sive of the cost of the Gendarmerie) are about equal so that large subventions from Tehran (like last year over half a million marks) were not necessary. The estimated total revenue for the year from rates &amp; taxes will be according to the Pi nance Agent 400 to 600,000 toymans and some 500,000 batmans of corn. (One Patman r -- s *) according to t^c List of Taxes the 53 districts &amp; 10 independent nomad tribes pay ought to pay more than 751,787 tomans and 858,366 batmans corn. That makes about three millions of marks in money and from four to twelve hundred thousand marks (according to prices) in corn. Unfortunately this year the Government cannot sell the corn paid as taxes but has to hand it over to the Gendar- merie.t raerie* In Shiraz in addition to direct taxes there are the excise on opiuin and the abattoir tax. The former brings in about 1000 tomans a year,whilst the latter is levied in kind,the Administration retaining the guts of slaughtered animals. Their sale realises some five to six thousand tomans yearly. On ac - count of the difficulty of inspecting this service,an attempt was recently made to replace it by a tax of 1 kran per animal. But this collapsed in fact of the opposition of the slaughterers who tried to raise the prices exorbitantly on the strength of it. As the Finance Administrationtfdid not receive proper sup - port from the local authorities thenew arrangement had to be dropped. The cost of the provincial administration,not counting the Gendarmerie,is 30 or 22,000 Romans monthly (about £4000 to £4400). This includ-es army,police and tufangchis (riflemen) on the roads and the Ccvernor's celery 6c. tut does not include expense of the Finance administration,salary 6c. The Governor jets 2000 Tomans monthly . The remark I ® de in ray despatch No.20,that *kK* he got nothing for the administration of the province of Pars I must correct. I have now learned that in addition (to the 3000 tomans) he receives a monthly credit of 400 tomans and 500 for his cabinet. As he takes good care tfnot to incur expenditure on behalf of government without haviig received the necessary from the finance department,my remark in the above mentioned despatch that illegal exactions on the part of governors was onjy to be looked for,does not hold good. The cost of the Gendarmerie during the first months care to 160,008 tomans Oabout £ 55,750). As is known, thethe Gendarmerie budget 5.s £ 100,000 The accounts of the Gendarmerie are in the hands of a Swedish Intendant-officer,who has evidently not alvrays been as v officials careful as he ought vis-a-vis m Persian mmmm% Ma »y losses are to be ascribed to the latters* embezzlement : also unfortunately it has been proved that the Gendarmerie have been badly deceived by some of their own employees,notably a certain Jew interpreter* To assist the France Agent in matters of accounts concerning the Gendarmerie,a Netherlander has arrived from Tehran The dearnssc cf corn f nany people tlinl: , is not due solely to lack of same* It is asserted rather that the 1 great landowners have stored up $arge quantities so as to sell at enormous prices in winter* With a view to bringing prices down,the Governor General recently sent men (escorted naturally by men-at-arms) to the northern districts of Dehbid &amp; G0HG0EI to buy 150,000 batmans of wheat there. But the inhabitants of those places,although they possessed supplies,refused to part because they hoped to get better prices in YKZD and took bast (sanctuary) in the house of the I.E.S.D.in Dehbid. Go far as I have been able to learn the English Consul (to whom natu' rally they telegraphed) did not support them and the Governor succeeded by granting certain concessions in gaining his point. High prices ruled also in Kazerun although this town is only a few days* journey from the coast where prices are normal. Bushire reports that the Governor there ordained that until further notice caravans going to Kazerun should take othingnothing but wheat &amp; barley. But on account of hi£h prices of fodder raany muleteers have left the Bushire-Shiraz road and go from here to Yezd or Isfahan. The rates of freight are therefore double^ and treble what they used to be. i For public works such as the building of roads,appar ently in Tehran funds are now provided. In the rest of Persia Belgian engineers have been engaged with the same purpose and on the suggestion of the English an Anglo-®ndian road # constructor is to be sent out for the Bushire-Sharaz road, and already the Government of India has been entrusted with the selection of an officer. , An American called MIRHYL is expected here shortly,to reoreanise the army. The Governor General tells me the idea originated with him,but naturally he previously assured himself of British approval. The English Consul has also alfceady moved the construction of a Budget,for which hitherto the material has been too slight. At prosnt the su^oction is to create an army of 1500 men. I do not know what arrifere- pensee lies hidden behind this new English policy. It seems not inproballe that *M* England will regard the services of the Swedish officers (which have not been sufficiently sul missive to her) as not indispensable after their present contracts have run out. The Governor General hinted that th«t the British Legation had favoured MIRRYL's appointment. It appears a remarkable article in English Policy in South Persia has been published in the TIMES of 34th September,but it has not yet reached the Imperial ConsulateConsulate through the newspaper news agency which is held of mid-August here. When reading the White Book/published in the 'Near East' on the subject of the English and Indian Governments* loans I saw clearly that England is making a very good business out of these loans. In return for three quarters of a million sterling,which is nothing for England,she gains distinct in - fluence over the fortunes of the country,assures her nationals lucrative positions,and gives her merchants much prestige and the possibility of disposing of their goods in the interior. And when the goods are robbed the Persian Government is UH held responsible and if the claims (which according to the English Consul amount to more than 100,000 tomans for South Persia alone) are pressed,then in the long run England will know how to obtain satisfaction. In other cases the fear of their consular authorities iMH&amp;t results in the Persian officials not giving the rein to their arbitrariness. For many a one has already found out that thejfPersian Govern - raeit in Tehran dances to the English pipe. Then again, wh^-t i sums English concerns like the Imperial Bank of Persia,the Indo European Telegraph Company (sic) and Lynch Bros.get out of the country ! Compared with these,the £ 750.000 for which c in any circumstances security can be found in Persia and which in the meantime earn their 5 or even 7 per cent.,is as nothing •However much England for political reasons may desire the strengthening of Persia,she has on the other hand good reason to be satisfied with what she makes out of her weakness. Copy Tehran. Sd/— WASSMUSS •pwT (From the Gerra&amp;n Minister Tehran Mo*A 44. To Imperial Chancellor Berlin)* Tehran , 7/9/1913. Preparations for the Persian parliamentary elections have commenced. A proclamation of the Shah,the Regent and the Minister of the Interior has been printed and is being published in every town of the Empire. Printed instructions from the Minister of the Interior have also been issued to provincial governors. A committee of electioneering control was formed in Tehran on the 4th instant. The Senate is to be elected simultaneously with the Parliament. The summons of the Minister of the Interior and his instructions to provincial governors state clearly that the new Parliament will have the task of altering the Constitution. For a long time past the leading Persian statesmen have perceived that the Persian Constitution is far more demo cratic than the actual condition of the country can tolerate. In especial,the Parliament had from its exceptional powers in relation to finance become almost an executive authority, and a salutary development of administrative activity has thereby been retarded. The Government has often thought of changing this state of affairs summarily. The Regent made a start in the spring of 1912 , when he suddenly dissolved the old Parlia - I* ment,which was composed of restless M storm‘“&amp;-stres M ers. For this purpose he summoned the deputies to the Palace and whilst he there informed them of the dissolution Parliament House was occupied by the Military. The Constitution was not however abrogated thereby ] on the contrary the Regent declared onon every possible occasion that he stood by it. It may be said that precisely during the past 18 months when there has been no Parliament the Persian Govern - / raent has taken the wisest measures for the good of the country, namely the development of the treasury and Gendarmerie. The constitutional necessity of summoning parliament once again,and thereby leaving the fairway of peaceful development to affront the stormy seas of politics,weighed like a mountain on the Government. And yet the summonihg of Parliament could not be evaded without upsetting the Constitution. A whole series of administrative measures absolutely require,by the terms of the Constitution,the consent of Parliament. At first ? the Sovsrnnsst sndcavcursd to alter the Constitution without summoning Parliament. A Commission sat for some time to deliberate on a change of the Electoral Law. Finally however Government came to the conclusion that a change of such constitutional laws could only be effected by a parliament elected on the basis of these very same laws. Any other procedure would have constituted a coup d # etat,and the Government had all the greater horror of a coup d*etat which might have opened the way to coups d*etat from another quarter as the very idea of a coup d'etat invariably evokes the memory of the ex-Shah Muhammad Ali,the bogey of each succeeding Pers - ian government of the past few years. So then in order to act quite legally the government has decided to hold the elections in accordance with law in this connection established. The electoral law in question is that of September 1P06,which received from Parliament a new form in October 1911. This new form must have been conceived in a delirium of democratic enthusiaen . Cnc '.Till hardly believe thatM 1 ') 1 or that in it — to take only one example the age the right to vote Cactiveiuniversal,direct,secret) has been lowered from 25 to 20,and this in a country where the majority of the population as far as education goes are hardly disting uishable from savages* Tt ir cot rlthcut o csrtoic comic element that Persians, particularly youths and men,cannot eive their correct age. The usual answer to the question 'How old are you?' is '20 to 28' or 'I don't know, perhaps ray father does, God certainly knows”. The Government seens to be making a virtue of this shortcoming in the law. The solemn instructions torfthe provincial governors,which make a volurae of 30 page?,make it quite plain (especially as every Persian frora his youth up is accustomed to read batween thejflines or hear between the wprds) that tae Minister o-f the Interior only wishes such people to be elected as appear likely to carry out the proposed change in the Constitution as desired by Government,and that he (the Minister) expects a corresponding influence to be exercised by Ms Governors on the elections,which indeed according to what I Have written above is fairly easy to arrange.

Parliamentary Elections. Ho.B 29. Shiraz,29/10/1913. I have the honour to report to Your Transparency in reply to Your despatch No.114 of the 7th ultimo on the subject of the Parliamentary Elect ions,that so far no elect - ions have taken place in the province of Pars. The Governor General received two months ago the instructions mentioned in Y.T*s letter to the Chancellor. Tut all he has 3 'et done towards making preparations for the elections — apart perhaps from influencing the minds of important persons is to issue two publications on the formation of a muni cipal Anjuman. The first of these merely announces the inten tion of forming the Anjuman and contains some excuse for the present hard times. It takes the wind out of the sails of those who might say it was the fault of Government or the Governor General. On the contrary (says the Notice) the latter has ever since his arrival been concerned for the wellbeing and peace of the inhabitants. And although the revolutions and Hpxisxsgs rebellions of the last few years have been partly responsible for present circumstances,yet everybody knewthat the dearness of the necessaries of life,particularly wheat &amp; barley,was due to lack of rainfall last winter and to the ravages of locusts. The second publication contains the announcement that by order of the Oovsrnor federal i nunici^cZ Anjuman isto be formed,consisting of 20 members,two from each quarter of the town. The conditions of election are appended, as also an intimation from the tellers (Anjuisan-i-Nuzaar) that they will be ready to distribute voting-cards on the 10th &amp; 23rd Zi Qaadeh. Both of these dates have however passe by without any distribution of voting-cards having taken la cs * The inhabitants are quite indifferent in the natter of he elections.

In wy despatch N 0 .C 228 dated 6th ulto.I reported to Y.E. the proposals which the Persian Government had wade to the British Legafc ion in this town with reference to the lighting of Persian waters and had the honour to promise a future despatch on the subject of buoys. tty further enquiries elicit the information that no agreement has been come to between Persia and England on the buoying of Persian waters. I learn from a reliable source that m the spring of this year Sir Walter Townley utilized the ne gotiations for an advance of £ 100,000 for the Gendarmerie in Soutn Persia *** order* to attempt to obtain from Persia the recog nition of England's rights in the matter of the lighting and buoying and policing of the Persian Gulf. He pointed to the historical position of England in the Persian Gulf and emphasised the fact that Persia had derived great advantage from English activity hitherto. Security of shipping and suppression of piracy were entirely the work: of England. Por the further development of these useful institutions a formal recognition by Persia was very desirable. He also asked for formal recognition of England's protectorate of Bahrain. This request was couched in the form that Persia should recognise 'England's treaties with the Shaikhs of the Gulf and should permit inhabitants of Bahrain in Persia to be protected by consuls. The Persian Cabinet , who just then had before them the drafts of the Russian bank con - cession,the English railway and the English mining concession, requested(55) requested the Minister for Foreign Affairs to draw the at - tention of the British Minister to the fact that the Cabinet was not in a position to examine iM applications which con cerned the independence of without endangering the fate of the other f more weighty,concessions. Sir Walter Townley ♦ then ceased to make the advance of £100,000 conditional upon the recognition of the afpresaid rights. Instead,he handed the Persian Government two notes. The former announced simply the granting of the advance. The second stated that after the English Government had just shown its complaisance by making an advance of £ 100,000 they might expect that Persia would meet England's wishes in a similar spirit. It was therefore to be assumed that Persia would respect the rights which England had acquired in the Persian Gulf with reference to buoying lighting and police through many years of exercising those rights (droits prescriptifs) . England would not fail to ex ercise these rights at the proper time.- The Persian Govern ment immediately protested in writing against this conception but then,to show their friendship,sent the British Legation the proposals for the lighting of Persian waters copy of which I sent Y.^.with my da^atch 3 00 ? dated 6th lilt.

The reason for the small export from Persia to Russia by sea is to be found in the great difference in the customs dues levied on the Russo-Persian land frontier Hi Cor Caspian and those in Odessa. Therefore the Ministry for Commerce are considering the question of reducing the customs tariff for Persian goods entering by sea* In addition to cargo the ships also carry passengers,mainly Muhammadan pilgrims for Jedda# The economic situation would not justify the re newal of the contract,but both the Gommerce and Foreign Min - isters regard the displaying the Russian commercial flag in the Persian Gul* as of impcrtancs politically,and indeed they lay stress on the voyages being more frequent than in the past.

The Italian Minister has informed me in strict confi - denee that Sir Walter Townley let fall #£fWj$/in his presence the remark that from 1/1/19x4 onwards En e iand would no longer be prepared to afford British consular protection to foreigners in Persia other than British* Such a decision on the part of the British Govt would be only too easy to understand : En e l a „&lt; ln her political conduct in Persia has to take into consideration not only Russ ia's wishes but also these of the C-ovt of Telia, 'creover attention has to be paid to the interests represented by the Resident in Bushire on account of his traditional historical position in the Persian Gulf.

The result for us of the proposed measure would therefore be that Germans in Kerman Meshed &amp; Isfahan would lack consular protection and would have to apply direct to the Bushire consulate or the Legation in Tehran* But the com plaints they bring forward are mostly of a kind which can only be satisfactorily be settled by a consular official on the spot* So in eases of urgent necessity it would be a question of deputing Mttti officers from Tehran or Bushire • This would be very expensive by reason of the costly &amp; lengthy journey involved and the procrastinating habits of the Pers ian authorities which would usually necessitate a lengthy stay on the part of the officer in question in the town visited. I would venture to submit the above remarks, with reference to my No*219 of 25/8/191? &amp; ho*230 of 8/9/13, as further material for a consideration of the question of the possiH* creation cf fresh consular *:Q3ts i- Persic.* The300 (7) The best way would be to appoint German consuls in the three towns mentioned. German interests in Meshed are not sufficiently important (for us) to think as yet of creat ing a consulate and at the same tiae a suitable candidate is not forthcoming. It would suffice if later we appointed the Meshed representative of Messrs.K.Hoffmann as Consular Agent. In Kerman the representative of the Persian Carpet Co. is the obvious candidate for the post of Consul,always pro vided that the present Manager,the young Swiss Bruggmann, o£ whom I have often reported,be replaced by an unobject - ionable quiet &amp; sound man. It is in Isfahan that the matter is most complicated because the only possible person there,Dr Pugin the Agent of the Hoechster Farbwerke,is himself involved in a tedious lawsuit with the Persian authorities. He can hardly be both litigant and consul. It would suit our interests best if the highly respectable firm of WSnckhaus who are active in the South of Persia,were to open a branch in Isfahan,a thing which is greatly desired by all German importers here* The consulate could then be entrusted to their representative, which would be serrin^ the interests both of the firm and of the Empire.

(Prow Prince Henry XXXI.of Reuss To - presumably - Mess.R^Wfinckhaus,Hamburg) . In your letter of tlie 30th October you requested my assistance to obtain for your Firm the right of running steamers not ohly on the Lcnrer which is open to the shipping of oil nations,but also on the Upper Karun. I put myself in com - munication with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in this connection some time ago and although I do not believe that I can obtain the rights you desire yet I will endeavour to establish your claims vis-a-vis those of other European firms so that,should occasion arise,you would not have to fear competition from them. I shall return to this point probably in the course of this month and inform you in detail of the result* Meanwhile I have learned with pleasure that you have created a regular steamship service between Ahwaz &amp; Mohammerah. This encourages me to recommend to you personally another matter which I have already endeavoured to put through to you through the Foreign Office. I do not know vrhether the Foeeign Office for their part have taken action on my sug gestion. The question is the following * Several German firns here have represented tc .~e j that it is highly desirable that Messrs. Robt.W&amp;nckhaus £ Co. should not confine their activities to the ports of South*A/ru Persiats i / r / w 4 tM) V fj] ^0 0, 1 ilfl fiOiaiia Oflflltoo flfO I H?ni] Jvioo Sil; Hi flji881 ? li not Si^ 0 J0 Persia but on the contrary establish Agencies in the In - terior. In especial they all mentioned Isfahan as the most important place for such settlement. As you kncvr^irzls has recently recztzi acre and more from the former Bushire-Shiraz-Isfahan road in favour of the Mohammerah-Isfahan route. Messrs Ziegler who formerly identi fied themselves closely with the transport business have of late years withdrawn more &amp; more from this branch. As they have also abandoned their former international English-SY^iss- German character and advertise themselves increasingly as an English concern,they are less in the foreground from our German commercial standpoint. Messrs Lynch Bros.pay attention more to the road itself as a road and leave much to be de ~ sired as a transport company proper. Just now when you with your well-known name are endeavouring to penetrate as far as Ahwaz,i.e.further into the interior^of Persia,! consider it a matter of necessity to make known your role outwardly and visibly up-country,i.e.in Isfahan • The present moment seems to me the more favourable for your firm to take this step as there would be a reasonable prospect of the German Consulate, which wm probably bs oy^ned there sooner or latsr,being entrusted to your representative in Isfahan. Mr Krumpeter, who is said to enjoy a certain esteem and is already acquain ted with business in Isfahan,has been mentioned to me as being eminently suited to represent you there. In case you realise these far reaching plans I would even consider it desirable that you should push out a branch agency from Isf ahan ^ I r*A- 0^3&gt; 7 c . ahan to Shiraz* I now cone to rath—er a delicate point* You must not take it ill if I express myself frankly on the subject* So far as is known to me you have only young officials in Southern Persia whilst the older gentlemen and the part ners in the business are all said to reside in Germany. This state of affairs would certainly require readjustment in the event of further development by you in Southern Persia. I should be grateful if you would give me in writing your views on my suggestion,which I would like to be treat ed as idgniigl. I have asked Mr Gnfiffky,the fonde de pouvoirs of the Dutch firm of Magasin Hollandais C.F.Prins of this town,who is leaving to-morrow for Germany,to discuss this matter personally', as occasion offers,with one of your directors during his stay in Germany. I would remark at the same time that Mfc.Gnuffky has not been given details of the matter of the Consulate,which is still very much in the air.

Yesterday I received a visit from the Shah f s Cham - berlain General Hussein Sadiq-us-Sultaneh who told me the following s- The Imperial Bank of Persia here representing a syn dicate of English concerns had been negotiatin g with the Persian Government for a considerable time for the con - struction of four railways. Ala—us—Sultaneh,Minister for Foreign Affairs,had at the request of the Cabinet appointed a Commission consisting of seven members to examine the draft Agreement already laid before it. The Commission was composed of (1) Sadiq-us-Sultaneh himself ( He is the son of Miraa Keaa Khan Muayyid-us-Sultaneh a former Persian Minister in Ber lin ; educated in Germany ; was an officer in the 52 n d 12th infantry reeiments ; easy-eoine anfl borne ) .

We may assume that each of these seven members of the Commission has informed the Legation in which he is interest ed. Perhaps also they are commissioned to sound ( such Le - gation ) . Sadiq-us-Sultaneh did this in the following way : He said that he himself as an officer could at the outside only express an opinion on strategical questions J otherwise he understood next to nothing about railways. He therefore begged me to help him out by suggesting a few ideas which he could bring out at the meetings of the Commission as his own. He would of course keep silence re the source of his info^r - nation.

Mon cher ami, As for the coal Mustapha told you about,I Muscat,1V/1/1900. fancy(4) fancy it only exists in the imaginations of the Arabs. Here is the yarn : it reads like a tale from the Arabian Nights. Some two years ago the discovery was announced of two coal mines on the coast,not far from SUR they said. TWO mines at once i! Too many in my opinion. Not in that of the Sultan,who immediately sent native engineers (?) to SUR. This scientific mission began by being shipwrecked,just like Ae - neas and his companions. They then repaired to the two places which had been pointed out to them with the greatest accuracy. Nothing there. Nothing in the neighbourhood. In the meantime the coal had gone elsewhere. 0 It was no longer by the sea-side but inland. ' for nicss on the coast,' the envoys of His Highness were told,' they may or may not be. But there is a mine inland,so much is certain. It is at the top of a mount ain at such and such a place,&amp;c. ' But as the mountain was a long way off and they would have to cross Hinawis territory, then Ghaferia an* then Hinawis again - all equally inhospitable n this part of Oman where not a step can be taken without :hafir “ the engineers of H.H. had no alternative but to return ;o Muscat an* report that they hat sssn no coal but that it ixisted doubtless at such «• such a place according to So md So etc. Xdu understand that after that there was no nore talk of coal mines. V.sincerely yours.(s) Dr Reinhardt Eushire To Imperial Chancellor Berlin Bushire f 27/1/1900* Reference my 174.

Dear Doctor, On my return after a lengthy journey to the * Pirate Coast* I received through the French Consul your friendly note of the 4th June and was delighted at your once more giving a sign of life. That you were in Cairo I learned from Michaelis whom I visited in Berlin in December 18961896 • What a pity I was not there when you passed through|we could hare chatted so pleasantly about old tines for a few hours. It is terrible here in Muscat,especially when the West wind blows ; I an trying to arrange a little contract with the Sultan,if I succeed I shall stay here,otherwise I donH quite know yet what I shall do and whither I shall turn ny pilgrin*s staff, lou heard perhaps at the tine that I was established in Borabay,during ny five months* absence ray locum tenens specu — lated away the whole of the capital which had already grown to nearly a half lakh : 'To ny old trade I have come back, I an the gay soap-boiler Jack'. i My business here is to start a postal service in col - laboration with the Sultan,as you probably heard when you were here. The English Consul has interfered most unfairly in this little private speculation,which by the way,quite entre nous, tiuiuimwmmnmiiwmttmunmu! is regarded with a friendly eye by the Foreign Office,and is trying to influence the Sultan in favour of one of his friends. Thereupon I wrote him a .... letter and he withdrew nobly but so jesuitically that for »e nothing is gained. I now hear that the English Consul General is coraing here fron Bushire. The old buffer here behaves like a Turkish Pasha and has made an ass of himself so many tiraes during the brief period of ray res idence here that I an sure the Chief will suspend him from his functions. I assume that you with your well-known suavity are A, on the besx terms with the Consul General in your town. If so, if he is really coining here and if you can arrange tosee him before(?) before he leaves you would be doing me a great service if quite privately you would influence him in favour of my scheme. The idea is that the Multan shouli far a certain sun lease to me for a term of years the postal service vrhich I am to start working. Everything was already fixed up f the Sultan himself had drawn up the contract for 6 years 6 5^,7,8,9 &amp; 10,000 Rs.per annum .. Nothing remained but to fair the contract,I had his firm promise,when up came the English Consul with a tender of Rs.15,000 with the sole object of M chicane**ing me,for when the r Sultan accepted his offer he promply withdrew it. The Sultan,al ways in terror of the English,doesn*t know what to do. He would be very glad to give me the contract but fears it would dis - please the English ( probably also in hi-s childlike simplicity he counts on their gratitude ! — England &amp; Gratitude ! — ) If you,dear Doctor,can do anything for me in a private way,please do ; if you consider inadvisable so to do,draw a sponge over it. If I get the post here and 66 therewith a future for myself I would willingly take a holiday and come to see you ; if the thing falls through perhaps I shall stay here after all. Busi ness gess better hero thus anywhere olse,though unfortunately since my bad luck when in Bombay I lack the necessary capital . But with patience and ... virtue and courage will conquer in the end. In any case I should dearly like to have the running of the Post,I have built many a project on it. N.R.The Sultan must not know that you are interesting yourself on my behalf or he would at one think I was ' mtu ya sirkali (?) and had only come here to annex his country - a sort of nightmare with hin# (?) Otherwise things go well with me. I have brought ray wife here with me - not the one you knoif, I talaq 1 dtalaq*d (divorced) her two years ago. No children.

Dear Doctor f My letter of the 4th has by an oversight remained all this time unposted : no harm done,because I no longer think it would do much good your speaking to the Consul General about my postal business.

No doubt it has long since sailed away on M faithlesa waves I have not yet seen any Oman gazelle but will bear your request in mind should I come across any. It is very boring here in Muscat and most probably I shall not stay much longer. The new Eng lish Consul is “one heart and one mind** with the Sultan and the latter is unlikely to pay any more attention to my schemes. At present I think of hanging on for a month or 6 vreekSjthen back to East Africa via Bombay. Where else can I go to ? I fear I am no longer any good for Europe,especially with an 4rab wife* If I had a little caoital I would have gone there once more just to see how things were getting on,but I don't quite share your views about Muscat now — heigho The English would be only too glad to get a firm footing here but the Sultan is unwilling to let them MM farm the Customs, although he has been offered the double of what his present farmer gives him.

UDCopy of a letter No*309 fron Petersburg to Berlin (by bag)* Petersburg,11/4/1902* She Novoe Vramya learns from Muscat that the French cruiser 'Catinat” on her return from Koweit at the end of February last came to Muscat and thence proceeded to SUE vrhere French &amp; British interests have come into somewhat sharp con - flict. When the English Consul heard of the French commander’s intention of going to SUE he is reported to have demanded that Sultan Seid should accos^asy himself to that sane placo in an English gunboat. The Sultan is said to have declined the invitation and also to have refused to lease the Muscat customs to the Indian Government or at least to appoint an Englishman as Director of Customs* This independent attitude of the Sul tan of Muscat towards the English Consul is to be ascribed to the appearance of a French battle-ship. Sultan Seid is dec! - dedly opposed to playing the role of an obedient servant of Lord Curaon,but wishes to maintain the independence of his country,which was guaranteed to him by the treaty of Onan 1862. Moreover if the Sultanate of Onan fell wxcluaively under the influence of Great Britain this would lower (lit.'annihilate') France's prestige in the Indian Ocean,but this prestige is (the Hovoe Vrenya? concludes) ' of ereat value to Russia in view of the possibility of connon action by both the Allied Powers in those waters ' • Sd/“ ALVENSLEBEN.«s**~ U3&gt; (13) (Prom German Consul General Simla to Imperial Chancellor) Simla 14/8/190S* Some two weeks ago Major Cox,British Resident in Muscat, arrived here,nominally to enjoy short leave but in reality to get final instructions re the Sultan of Muscat^ participation in the Delhi Coronation and also to post himself generally in events in the Gulf* With the latter object in view he has been working more than a week at the Foreign Department here* As Major Cox is Lord Curaon*s right hand nan in the Gulf and is Here ins of the zest cspahls anl snoreetic officers of the Political Department,several long conversations which I had with him - although they called forth little that was new - should be so far of interest that they come from an authentic source,a circumstance which is always worth in V i e w of the many exaggerations to which all events in the Gulf are subject. Major Cox told me the following : Whatever one may think of the justification of Russian efforts in the Persian Gulf,there can be no doubt that if the Russian Government persevere in their attempts .which entail great pecuniary sacrifice and,destined to be unprof^a- bie for some time) to capture a share in the trade and prestige of the Gulf she will succeed in the long run.

In any case if one looked at the sea-borne trade of the Arabian Sea from Aden,Muscat^,Koweit*Bushire 1 Bunder Abbas,Bombay as a whole ( the trade being all more or less interdependent ) Russia's share was H a drop in the ocean M . One reason why the Russian battleship H VARYAG M had produced a certain impression on the natives in the Gulf od Oman and the Persian Gulf was that ths reltgioiu^.: inclined Orientals were struck by the splendour of the service celebrated by the priest carried on board. Much trouble was caused Major Cox in Muscat by the slave trade carried on under the French flag. Ever^ £ year some 1,000 to 1,500 slaves were imported from Portu - guese East Africa,who found ready purchasers in the Sultans and well-to-do Arabs of the coast,and were nearly always well treated by their owners. Ehe price of a slave was fror. 50 to 100 iollarajthat of a f eBa ie slave up to 150 dollars ; every year he freed regularly VO or 80 of the , but a great difficulty was that those who were liberated, partly from ignorance of where their hones were, partly because they had grown accustoned to their new country, could not in the najority of cases be returned to their The French flag was practically for sale and was hcistsd homes.hoisted by slaving and snuggling dhovrs as soon as an English warship hove in sight* Although he was on good terns with the present French Consul in Muscat,an amiable and very clever nan,yet he had on several occasions had 'straight talks* with him over this rery question of slave trading under the French flag. The whole French trade in Muscat was only 3$,the Eng lish 95$ of the total. France imported practically nothing but arms,the greater part of which were snuggled over to the opposite coast* In addition to the French Consul &amp; himself the only white men in Muscat were the U.S.A.Consul and one French mer chant. The trade of the place was almost entirely in the hands of native merchants who were generally speaking honest but worked without much capital. They got their goods on better terms r.cro oaclly * a c „ from the Hindu traders in Bombay than through European firms. In trade matters everything de pended on Bombay. Prices of pearls and horses - the two principal articles of export - were entirely reflated on Bombay prices and no Muscat trader sold before ascertaining prices ruling in Bombay. Any important increase of direct trade with Kurope would only be possible if European (Major Cox sajd 'English') firms established themselves in Muscat ft Bahrain. The chief obstacle to this was the deadly climate of Muscat|which on account of its extraordinary heat - B uch worse than Aden - and the impossibility of recruiting in a hill station usually made a stay of more than a year' - ,, M, Cis) at a tine out of the question for Europeans* Curiously enough,he himself in spite of a three years' stay had en - joyed good health with the exception of a little fever. The S^tan of Muscat would send his son to represent him at the Delhi Coronation and he - Major Cox - would ac company him. The Sultan himself would not be present as he feared his relations would create difficulties for him in his absence - the usual preoccupation of Arab Sultans and the chief reason for their just treatment of their subjects. Other Sultans of the Gulf would probably not be rep resented at Delhi,although it would be a most fitting oppor tunity of giving foLfy QQZQ of then Cthe Shaihh of Tctreit for instance) a good idea of England's power. — The Anglo-Indian papers,notably the 'Times of India',have recently given sundry news of events in the Gulf,which I think I ought to report because although they are often somewhat exaggerated they usually contain some element of truth. They all originate more or less in stories of Cap tains of English merchantmen touching at Gulf ports,from whoa they find their way into the Bombay press,but as Major Cox remarks they are almost the only source of news from those parts of the Gulf where there are no consuls or rest dents.

The position as ascertained by him was as follows The British Government through the then British Consul General in Bushire concluded a treaty for the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf with the prsdSSSSSai: of Mubarak-es-Sabah in the Sheikhdom of Koweit,the latter*s brother Muhammad Pasha—es— Sabah murdered by him (Mubarak) in May 1896* This treaty is merely one link in the chain of agreements which the English have made during the last 50 years with the Arab chiefs of the Persian Gulf and the result of which is the so-called Trucial League* Like other agreements with the Trucial Chiefs the sole object of this treaty with Muharamad-es-Sabah was the security of trade and travel 5 the Sheikh of Koweit bound himself to allow all vessels moving in the Persian Gulf near and far from his Koweit residence to pass unhurt and unimpeded , in return for which the British Government on its part formally promised to respect and protect all vessels of the Sheikh and inhabi ~ tants of Koweit* At the same time on the other hand the Brit — ish Government concluded a much more circumstantial treatyt? with the Sheikh of Bahrein Island the upshot of which was to renderrender it impossible for the Imperial Ottoman Government to institute a Turkish Civil and Military Government in Bahrein* That a similarly close agreement does not exist in the case of Koweit is best shewn by the fact that Turkey,though for certain political reasons unvillin- for the present tc send military to Koweit,definitely included the harbour of Koweit in the sixil government of the Ottoman Empire by appointing Sheikh Mubarak Civil Governor (kaimakam) of Koweit and by his voluntarily hoist ed ing the Turkish flag • Thus the agreements concluded before 1806 between Sheikh Muharamad-es-Sabah and the English are limited to this one treaty,which in no wise involves independent sovereign rights of the Sheikh of Koweit. But the English have since 18^6 been con - stantly pressing Sheikh Mubarak to conclude a new and closer treaty. But always the Sheikh has refused either to take this step or to renew the old treaty. To all requests of the English he invariably replied that ' the former treaty made by his brother Muhammad was sufficient ' • Again during the visit of the Eushire British Consul-General to Koweit during the spring and autumn of last year English efforts to obtain a renewal of the treaty failed.

The quarrels between the Prince of Central Arabia (Nejd) Abdul Aziz ibn Rashid on the one hand,and the Arab Sheikhs of the lower Euphrates (Sadun Pasha and his Mun-tafiktfs) and Koweit (Mubarak-es-Sabah) on the other,hare become more acute during the past few weeks. The son of Mu - hammad-es-Sabah ( who was murdered by his brother ^Mubarak in 1896 ) and his partisans and supporters,the wealthy Koweit merchant Yusuf Ibrahim established in Bombay,are entirely on Emir Ibn Rashid's side in this quarrel as on former occasions ; at the present mcrsnt they are out with him in his tents near Samara on the lower Euphrates.\Abdul Aziz ibn Rashid,after being attcked by night at a place two days' march from Koweit by the Sheikh of Koweit Mubarak Pasha-es-Sabah who had adwanced to meet him ( an attack by the way which passed off without important casualties ) has now taken the field against the Muntafik Arabs ( and their leader Sadun Pasha ) who are encamped by Samara and are leagued with Mubarak. As the Turkish Corernment is ur^ntly interested in the speediest possible remoral of these troubles which mainly rest upon M KHOYE M and the therewith connected claims in money or its equiralent in camels or horses and which greatly diminish the rerenues of the state,Maj.-General Kasim Pasha,the brother-in- law of Sultan Abdul Hamid who has been for some time in ban - ishment here,was sent to Samara a week ago with special full powers by direct Imperial Decree ('irade-i-Senye”). Reliable reports state that h^d an interriew yesterday with Ibn Ra shid in the latter's camp in the desert,and it may safely be prophesied that his gfceat influence will soon bring abouta settlement* Undoubtedly it is with reference to the above reported events that Reuter's Agency publishes the follow ing sensational telegram,which is dated Bombay,is reproduced in all the larger German dailies,and is presumably worth correcting in view of the fact that it deals with Koweit, the provisionally selected terminus of the proposed Baghdad railway ' It is reported from Bombay that news has been received there of a bloody battle near Koweit in the Persian Gulf* Ben Rashid proclaimed himsel-f King of Arabia and ad vanced on Koweit with 20,000 men* ^he Sheikhs of Koweit marched out with 10,000 men. The fight lasted from sunset to sunrise* The troops of Ben Rashid advanced several times but were finally dispersed* The Sheik-s took much booty • The 'bloody battle** from sunset to sunrise' can only mean the above mentioned night skirmish between Ifcn Rashid's people and of the -heikh of Koweit* The Commandant of the Vlth Imperial Ottoman Army Corps here,F.M. Ahmad Feizi Pasha,with whom I had occasion to discuss the Reuter's sensational telegram,formally and energetically confirmed my view as expressed above and derived by me from independent sources. Ahmad Feizi Pasha believes that the telegraphic news forwarded by certain English circles in Basra to Bombay was certainly given to the world by the Sheikh of Koweit Mubarak-es-Sabah's friends and partisans settled in Basra. The idea would seem to be that Mubarak would now like to play the part of the beloved son in Con stantinople, i.e. re present himself as a faithful vassal of the Sultan and his adversary Ibn Rashid as an arch-adversary of(10) of the Turkish Government lusting after dangerous indepen - dence. Hence the dissemination of the report that Ibn Rashid had declared himself 'King of Arabia',which of course if true would inevitably have aroused the greatest indignation and alarm in Yildia Kiosk,as it would have at once brought up the Arabian question in Arabia itself before the Turkish Empire. When X read to Mushir Ahmad Feisi Pasha the passage in question out of Reuter's telegram and asked him if there was a word of truth in the statement that Ibn Rashid had declared or meant to declare himself 'King of Arabia',Ahmad Feizi Pasha with the greatest serenity answered me with the genuinely Turkish exclamation of 'Yok janum',i.e.'Ah no, my soul!'

Nevertheless on the 12th instant direct reports reached Bombay from Bushire to the following effect:- The successes of Mubarak Sheikh of Koweit were only of brief duration. Some four weeks ago it seemed as though he had completely put to flight his adversary Bin Rashid. Mubarak entered Hail without opposition and it was universally be - lieved that fighting was over. Bin Rashid*s tactics seem however to have had the sole object of deceiving Mubarak. After the first engagement in which Mubarak’s rifle-men armed with modern rifles inflicted heavy losses (on the enemy),he recognised clearly the importance of modern weapons*sarj^s fire and peudently avoided a big engagement. By allowing hostile detachments to reach his rear guard from time to time,he caused them to expend as much ammunition as possible* But after the Koweit army had entered Hail in - toxicated with success and neglecting all precautionary measures!Bin Rashid sent spies into the enemy*s camp and convinced himself that there was lack of annunitioru Bin Rashid then collected his forces and took the offensive. This caused Mubarak to abandon Hail and retire on Koweit. A few miles from Hail there is a narrow defile, which Mubarak*s forces had to traverse. Here Bin Rashid posted a few camel sowars,but the main body of his force hid themselves in ambush on the slopes of the ravine where they found excellent cover. On the approach of the Koweit people Bin Rashid's camel sowars retired according to previous instructions deeper into the defile. The enemy pursued them with great zeal up to a point where the ravine narrows considerably. At this spot the main body of Bin Rashid’s rifle m er, had hidden themselves and opened a devastatine fire on Mubarak's detachments trhS in conse^ueaee of their position were wellnigh defenceless. Even if the latter had been well supplied with cartridgescartridges they could not hare accomplished much against the well-hidden foe. -fr In a short time the hitheryo victorious for - ces of Mubarak became disorderly groups which scattered in all directions in wild flight* The whole of their equipment fell into Bin Rashid 9 s hands* This fight according to reports received here took place at the beginning of March. In a few days 9 time fu - gitives from Mubarak 9 s army reached Basra,Fao &amp; Koweit,where they spread the news of their severe defeat. These reports contradict each other in detail, but it seems highly probable that Mubarak lost at least about 5,000 men. Bin Rashid 9 s losses are said to have been very slight. As for Mubarak himself,it is believed that he escaped with his Ilfs and reached r.owsit. Mubarak 9 s fate is generally pitied here. They say it is true he penetrated into Arabia with an army,but that he intended neither to make conquests nor to take booty ; that he merely had in his mind a punitive expedition. C The official press says : H He was simply engaged in what Simla would de - scribe as a punitive expedition ) • Of Bin Rashid they say that he is an ambitious breeder of unrest who has taken to himself the title of 'King of Arabia**. He is said to have left his capital Hail and to have marched on Koweit to turn out Mubarak and replace ^ . him by the two sons of a former Sheikh of Koweit. So Mubarak advanced to meet him. They maintain howeverhowerer that shortly after the outbreak of hostilities Sultan Abdul Hamid expressed a desire that these should cease* Mu barak is sa!&lt;! to at once responded to the Sultan*s wish* Bin Rashid howerer again advanced on Koweit and was completely vanquished in two large engagements last Becember* They also affirm here that Mubarak had no intention of keeping Nejd for himself ; but rather that he hoped to re- one place Bin Rashid by a direct descendant of/of the old Wahabi Emirs* For the (publi*) peace in Arabia it is fortunate that this project failed,for a revival of the Wahabi question could only have had an unfavourable effect upon all Muhammad ans* It is especially regretted here that a small ruler who is supposed to cherish friendly sentiments towards Eng - land should have fallen on such evil days.

According to my informant the attack on Koweit by pi - rates towards the end of the summer was stage-managed by Sheikh Mubarak himself with a view to causing the English to et-' send men—of-war with arms to Koweit*whieh he percteved to be the most practical means (1) of preventing the Turks from undertaking an advance on Koweit*(S) of protecting himself against dangers threatening him from Nejd. Ibn Sabah appears to have attained his object for I am assured(23) assured that the English have recently landed large quan tities of arms including Martini rifles in Koweit and the Turks who intended to bring this place into their military sphere are remaining inactive to the great disappointment of Ibn Rashid who is gradually coming to see that no reliance can be placed in Turkish promises : indeed he has been entirely left in the lurch by the Sublime Porte in his struggle with ibn Sabah and his adherents,and left to himselt he will in the long run hardly bo able to withstand Sheikh Mubarak who is bent on destroying his empire and who is most powerfully backed with arms and money by the English,the authors of this policy* A telegram arrived here a short time ago from Medina for Abiallah Sumaya the representative of Ibn Rashid report- in e a treat victory of Ibn Rashid — over whon the nessace does not say,but it is assumed that the Ruler of Neja has retaken Er Riad and overthrown Ibn Saud.

(to Herr von Mutius, Bushire) ^° nSU ' For your information I have the honour to inform you that in the course of conversation the Russian Charge d Affaireo Mr von Somow told me that accordinf to a report from the Russian Consul General Bushire the British Consul General at that port had notified the Governor that he took under his protection all subjects of the Sheikh of Koweit reside in his l 'I'p? SIbis district. Upon Mr von Somov asking Petersburg whether the Russian Government recognised England 0 s protectorate of Koweit he received a negative answer. I have not learned what instruct - ions were given to the (Russian) Consul General in Bushire. To complete my report to Berlin in this connection it would be interesting to me to learn further about the matter. I therefore request you to keep it in view and to report should occasion arise. Sd/- (Illegible). IMPERIAL GERMAN VICE CONSULATE. Bushire,April 6th 1006. No.A 5 . (Addressed Imperial Chancellor,copy to Tehran). In the Persian port of Dayyer the Customs authorities a short time ago seized a dhow the owner of which had attempted to smuggle away corn and to bribe the Customs director to issue a Jewaz (pass). The man w*s sent to Bushire for punishment but was immediately released by the Customs Director as he was a subject of the Sheikh of Koweit and the British Consul General demanded his release on the grounds of the British protectorate. As one can hardly suppose that the Director of Customs would have taken such a step without instructions from Tehran it would seem as though the Persian Government now recognised Eng - land f s protectorate which hitherto they have several times cal led in question. On the other hand it is rumoured here that Sheikh Mu - barak hiwsel* has f cr CQ33 timp fslt En^ish friendship to be a right burdensome tutelage and that he is trying for a rapproche- ment with the Turkish Governnent. The circunstance that Mubarak is(25) is said to have again hoisted the red flag along with the Cres cent is not H of great importance in itself,as this flag which is also flown by entirely independent Arab princes is admittedly regarded as a symbol of adherence not to the Ottoman Empire but to Sunni Islam. On the other hand Shei&amp;h Mubarak is said to have asked the Tall v. 4 -+^ of Basra some time ago for an interview,but the latter replied he must first have instructions from Constantinople Evidently the instructions received were negative,at any rate it has not been learned here that a risit of Mubarak to the Vali has taken place. At the sane tine the Sultan seens not to have entirely repulsed Mubarak's overtures,for he has sent hin a robe of honour and other costly presents and bestowed on hin the title and rank of a Pasha. This report was cor&gt;firi&gt;.ed by a Reuter ’ ® tei err** ttat «*** proofs of friendship by Mubarak took place with the knowledge and consent of the English Governnent . Whether this is so or whether their consent was given subsequently when it was too late to alter the fact of acceptance,! cannot say. In case all these not easily checked reports of Hu baralj's dissatisfaction with the English protectorate should be founded on fact,then the visit of Vice Adniral Sir E.Poe who yesterday proceeded to Koweit had perhaps the object of bringing to the Sheikh's notice the value of English friendship and the power of English guns. Copy of this despatch is being sent to Tehran. Sd/~ LISTEMAHH . &gt;IMPERIAL WTMW VTC? CONSULATE,BUSHIRE. September 10th 1908. No.28. Sheikh Mubarak of Kovreit seems to be getting more and more weary of the English friendship. For some time past more or less reliable reports have been arriving from Koweit of friction between him and the British Political Agent Major Knox* now one hears of Mubarak protesting against the erection of a flagstaff in front of the British Agent’s house,now of the latter otjeetisg to the Ottoman coot of arms being affixed to the Sheikh’s house,to which the Sheikh retorted by adding the Persian shield and declaring that it was not a question of politics but merely of decorating his front door,for which purpose the arms of the two greatest Islamic states appeared most fitting* Of late however more serious differences seem to have arisen ; the very scanty and not easily obtained news which filters through to Bushire about events in Koweit amount to the following X- Some months ago a scuffle occurred at Koweit on board a Steamer of the B.I.S*N.Co*between Persian soldiers who were travelling from Bushire to Lingah,and sundry nat ives of Koweit , in which two of the latter were killed &lt;br severely wounded. The Sheikh asked Major Knox for his assis - tance in obtaining punishment of the culprits and com - pensation from the Persian authorities,but his request was *i either refused cr treated in a dilatory fashion ' reports differ on this point ) so that the affair eventuality died a natural death. This naturally annoyed the Sheikh,who soon found an opportunity of getting even with the English.7 ■ v.;- -w m.- I I 3 (27) A short tiise after the above incident sundry native pass engers arrived at Koweit fron India on a nail steamer of the B.I.S.K.Co.; as the vessel u was in quarantine Major Knox re quested Mubarak to cause both the travellers and the crews of the liters visttin- the steamer to go into quarantine,al - though Koweit possesses no quarantine station and there has never been any talk of establishing one. Ihe Sheikh refused and when the British Agent threatened that the British India would cease their calls at Koweit Mubarak is said to have replied that he never invited the Company to xisxt touch at Koweit and that if they stayed away it was all one to him. He immediately show ed that this was no empty form of words by forbidding all boatmen to lighter the Tritish Tntic/s steanors and in general vetoing the use by his subjects of the said steamers ; some individuals who through ignorance or neglect of the order took tickets for Bushire are said to have been severely punished by him and compelled to give back their tickets to the B.I.Agent. Since then several B.I.Steamers have had to leave Koweit with — out being able to land a *±«* single package of their Koweit cargo. Since then several English gunboats have cruised al - most incessantly in the vicinity of Koweit,without these dem - onstrations appearing to have caused the Sheikh to give way. He certainly may assume with good reason that the English will not undertake anything of a violent nature in ofcder to gain their point. England has on various occasions in the past few months shown that she is disinclined to go beyond demonstrations with the Arab princes of the Gulf littoral,as for example in Debai(28) to accede to the Resident®s request Debai tfhere the refuel for the establishment it by the Sheikh of an Indian Post Of - fice had no other result than that Major Cox did not refer to the matter again. She English may quite well have comejfto see that their protectorate is in the highest degree burdensome to the Arabs and that it might lead to serious consequences if they strung the bow too tight. Ihis is perhaps one of the reas ons why they recently allowed the return to Bahrein of a cert ain Ali bin Ahmad nephew of the Sheikh of Bahrein whom they deported to Bombay in 1905 and whose treatment had made a very bad impression on the Arabs. On the other hand it is obvious that the present system of putting in claims of every de - scription and letting them drop again whenever serious oppo sition is encountered,must if persisted in for long deal a heavy blow to British prestige and greatly shake the Arabs® conviction of the omnipotence of Great Britain,without making their sentiments any the more friendly as this policy would be regarded nn weakness*not magnanimity# An unconfirmed report now reaches me that Mubarak and Major Knox have come to a kind of compromise whereby the English drop their demand for a quarantine and the Sheikh declares himself willing to lighter the British India steamers in future on condition that they confine themselves to the carrying of mails,so that goods transport falls to the Bombay-Persia Steam Navigation Co.,whose steamers touch at Koweit regularly once a fortnight. Confirmation of this news is awaited ; per se I think it hardly probable that the English Agent should have agreed to an arrangement so disadvantageous to the B.I. Copy to Tehran. ( Listernann ) •(To Imperial Chancellor Berlin,copy Tehran). The information reported by me in my No.28 to the effect that the Kovreit incident had been settled by a sort of compro - mise between Sheikh Mubarak and Major Knox is confirmed. As however was to be foreseen,no arrangement was made binding the British India to carry mails only,not cargo. The English hare dropped their demand for a quarantine station,neither had they any success with their rinultanecur request that ths Sheikh should prohibit the arras traffic. In other respects as well l as in the matter of the British freight question mentioned above the English failed % after long negotiations and repeated at ~ terapts at intimidation they dropped their demands and only suc ceeded in getting a return to the previous condition of affairs viz. that the British India (like other companies) should have L lighters. On the 20th or 21st inst. the 'Sphinx* and 'lapwing' arrived at Koweit,Major Knox and the two Commanders went to see the Sheikh,apparently to make a last effort to get their demands accepted. This attempt seems to have failed and the result was as stated,namely English claims were dropped and the Sheikh agreed to lighter B.I.steamers. I learnt the above from a private letter of the native agent of the B.I.in Koweit. Generally speaking it is extraor - dinarily difficult to find out anything about what happens in Koweit,as not only do the English exert themselves to maintain the utmost secresy abput these,but also the ^sikh has forbiddema C30) / -&lt; forbidden his subjects to say anything and he supervises their correspondence. And there are no Europeans in Koweit except the British Agent. Although theoretically the B.I.obtain freedom for their goods they will not derive much advantage from the con cession as the merchants of Koweit Cbyrfperinission if -ot actu ally at the instigation of the Sheikh) have caused the Bom- bay-Persia to send their steamers regularly every fortnight to Koweit,and the Bombay-Persia will soon knock out the B.I.as regards cargo,just as has happened in Lingah and Debai,and to a certain extent in Bahrein and Basra. 1-'wU'IBSSi ■HHi ~ 'IMMIll- Wm. As for the Arms Traffic,I notice that in 1P00 an Ind ian paper announced an agreement between the uovernrient of In dia and the Sheikh to prevent arms traffic (vide report by Consul RSssler No.236 dated 16/8/1900). This is hardly true, at least it is known here that since that time various coirsien &gt; nents of arms hare tone to Koweit.with the fcnowledce of the H - -f British Representatives in Bushire.
