Enclosure No. 1. Telegram P., No. 304—1503, dated the 29th December 1912. From—The Political Resident, Bushire, To—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, and the Secretary to the Government of India m the Foreign Department. (P). It is submitted that the Persian Government and other interested parties are deliberately taking advantage of our liberal usages and that our interests aie being prejudiced at a difficult juncture by the use of the Anglo-Indian and British Press and the Reuter’s telegrams for the publication of damaging and falsified accounts of current events, specifically designed to mislead the public or with the object of “ allaying excitement in London and Calcutta.” We know for example that the Persian Consul-General in India is supplied regularly by his own Foreign Office with rubbish for press purposes, and the Anglo-Indian press solemnly publish (generally without comment) his fanciful communiques; whilst in connection with the murder of Captain Eckford, garbled and inaccurate messages have been telegraphed home by Reuters, which have been derived from Persian or Swedish sources, and the effect of which, in military eyes, is to cast an unnecessary and wholly undeserved shir on a British Indian cavalry regiment. I venture to express the earnest hope that the matter may be taken into lively consideration and that it will be considered possible to ask Reuters and the Editors of respectable Anglo-Indian newspapers not to give currency to news received from obviously tainted Persian sources, without first taking steps to check their accuracy by communication with responsible British officials with whom as a rule they are in touch. I may mention the following recent instances :— (1) Entry in pioneer dated 30th November, quoting a statement made on official authority by the Persian Consul-General to the effect that Shiraz road was safe, transport hire greatly decreased and “ Rahdari ” abolished. (2) Up to December 21st none of Reuter’s communications referred in any way to the behaviour of Indian troops, whilst it was specific ally stated in a message of December 18th that “ gendarmes escorting Captain Eckford ^ * * * eventually saved the situation,” a statement directly contrary to ascertainable fact as recorded in Major O’Connor’s telegrams from December 11th to December 14th. Enclosure No. 2. Telegram P., No. 312, dated and received 31st December 1912. From—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To— The Political Resident, Bushire. (Repeated to Foreign as No. 11, dated 4th January 1913.) (P). I have the honour to refer to your telegram No. 304. It was unfortunately the case that Reuter’s agent was, at the moment of the EckfordV incident, in quarantine, and I had no chance of exercising control over hi S communications, and no time to send the true tacts. , It would have been difficult for him to have refused to make known the ctens in contemplation by the Persian Government. A report from Shiraz misled P the Swedes who jumped at the opportunity of retrieving the unfavour able impression which Sir E. Grey’s statement has caused. It is to he regretted that Reuter’s agent inserted the Swedish message, which was plainly inaccurate. He requests me to point out to you that a punitive^expe'ditlon is considered ^ ^ t0 befrau^t ^--equences such importance to Great Britain and to Persia that in common taimess ne could not suppress the Persian Government’s proposals and views. r Enclosure No. 3. Telegram P. ? No. 4—12, dated the 4th January 1P13. J From—The Political Resident, Bushire, To—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. (Repeated to India.) With reference to your telegram No. 312, dated December 31st, it seems to me that the admission which Reuter’s correspondent invited you to com municate to me gives him away altogether. _ On September 27th, 1911, another instance of the same kind occurred when, animated by similar personal bias he referred to dangerous disorders at Shiraz as “ insignificant ” for which I believe he was severely taken to task by vour predecessor. Reuters, as I understand the position, are in a different position to a news paper, and as a company, profess that they have no P a J^y or ax grind, hut merely undertake to distribute reliable items of the world s news. In the cases to which reference has been made, their Tehran representa tive has admittedly made use of his public position m order to further his personal political bent by reporting, without check or comment, inaccurate reports and statements regarding the intentions of e / e ^ ia ^? 0V ^ m ^ which he knew to be merely specious, just as well as (lid, with tbe knowledge or the intention‘that the public should be misled thereby The former, moreover, were calculated incidentally to damage British interests and the reputation of our arms. I venture with great respect to enquire whether we have not got sufficient grounds to ask Reuters to change their Tehran correspondent. Addressed Minister, repeated India. P&lt;nW (to Minister only .

I much regret that I am unable to agree wdth you in your appreciation of his action, but I am prepared to submit the case to His Majesty’s Foreign Office. I could not, even had I been able to see the correspondent, have told him that he was not to publish the action announced by the Persian Government as being their intention to take, though, as my telegrams showed, I attached no sort of importance to their assurances, as I know them to be impotent to give effect to them. Your statement that facts only should be reported by Reuter’s agent is correct. If he had made any comment on the announcement of the Persian Government, it might have been held that he had shown bias. The tact that he listened to the story of the Swedes wns unfortunate, but he found himsell in peculiar circumstances, and he did his best, at the earliest possible date, to remedy the mischief done.Enclosure No. 5.

Sardar-i-Jang had on the 29th instant received no instructions from the Persian Government regarding the supply of Bakhtiari forces for the punishment of those responsible for Captain Eckford’s murder. He said he would disregard such orders, if received, unless the necessary funds were at the same time placed at his disposal. Eive thousand men would he neces sary, he said, and many hundred thousand tomans would he required to keep such a force in the field. Enclosure No. 2.

I am informed by the Sardar Assad that a report has been received by the Sardar Assad that the Kuhgilu are submissive to him, a statement m which he is disposed to place some credence, in view of the fact that the Amir Mujahid is related by marriage to many of the most important chiefs and that they are well disposed to him. The Sardar Issad is by no means confident that the Sardar-i-Jang would be victorious over the Kuhgilu, were he to initiate military operations against them, because they are the strongest and most warlike tribe m Persia, but he expressed himself as confident that Sardar-i-Jang will be able to keep them off the road and prevent further acts of brigandage. Vith a view to overawing the Kuhgilu he has a large force with him. I am of opinion that the Bakhtiari have no intention of moving against the Buwair Ahmad.■' Aj, Enclosure No. 3. Telegram No. 6, dated and received the 7th January 1913. From—Hie Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To—The Political Kesident, Bushire. (Repetition of telegram No. 8 to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran.) In continuation of my telegram No. 4 I have the honour to report that on January 6th I induced Major Seifvert to come with me to breakfast and go on to see the Mukhbir-es-Saltaneh, and the question of arms, etc., Avas threshed out. The Governor-General began by explaining what was his plan of operations. He states that the following arrangements had been made by the Darya Begi for the safe conduct of the arms and ammunition (now at Eushiie). I he Darya Begi is himself at Borasjun, where he is collecting riflemen to the number of at least 200, whilst there are 200 at Kamarij and Kazerun respec tively under trustworthy leaders. This force, together with the men already with Major Brandel, and those whom he is now recruiting, and the two maxim guns should, he calculates, suffice to ensure the safe passage up the road of the arms and ammunition, and Major Seifvert can proceed from Shiraz himself with all the men he and the Mukhbir-es-Saltaneh can muster between them, together with two guns, and meet the caravan at Kamarij or at Kazerun. Major Seifvert stated in reply that orders had just reached him from Colonel Hjalmarson that unless in Major Seif vert’s opinion the arms caiavan could perform the journey in safety it was not to start. After some discussion regarding the details of the disposition made by the Governor-General, it was agreed by Major Siefvert that if 200 suitable men could be enlisted at Bushire, and if he himself, on arrival at Kazerun found that the riflemen there would support him, the above dispositions would be sufficient to warrant him in permitting the arms to be despatched. He is considering, however, the expediency of taking only half the total of arms and ammunition by the first caravan, the remainder being despatched later on under similar arrangements when the fiist half has reached Kazerun in safety. With regard to the distribution of the arms, Major Siefvert stated that he had received a telegram from the Commandant stating that the arms were for the gendarmerie, and should not be handed over to any one else. The Governor- General replied that he would refer this point, which would not be settled locally, to Tehran. In this connection, reference is invited to my telegram No. 218 and your telegram 181: please endeavour to arrange matter with the Commandant. I concur with the Governor-General in thinking that under the circum stances the arrangements proposed aie the best that can be made and that the arms caravan may start with a good p: ospect of reaching Kazerun and eventually Shiraz in safety when the preparations of Major Brandel and of the Darya Begi are complete. Would you kindly also speak to the Commandant on this subject. The question of these arms is an important one, as the possibility of forming a neAv force here, and eventually of conducting punitive measures against Muham mad Ali Khan and other troublesome persons and tribes depends on their safe and speedy arrival.

IVEajor Siefvert are very doubtful regard ing the good faith of the Governor of Bushire in the matter of obtaining recruits for the gendarmerie. It is pointed out by the Governor-General that the Governor is hand in glove with the Kawam, and it is more than likely that the Kawam’s views regarding the gendarmerie are shared by the Governor: and that recruits, even if he produces them, are not likely to be reliable. It is proposed by him therefore, that if any further difficulty is en countered by Major Brandel in finding men at Bushire, he should proceed to Borasjun, and with the Darya Begi’s assistance, enlist suitable men there. This proposal has Major Siefvert’s concurrence and he is telegraphing to Major Brandel accordingly. The question of these recruits is of importance to the Pars authorities, as on it depends the possibility of bringing arms to Shiraz and, consequently, of enabling the Governor-General to execute his various projects. If I can inform Major Siefvert and the Mukhhir-es-Saltaneh from time to time of Sir P. Z. Cox’s views regarding BrandePs prospects of success and of the progress he is making with the recruits, it will be a great help to them. Enclosure No. 5. Telegram P. No. 8, dated and received the 9th January 1913. From—Bis Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To—The Political Resident. Bushire. (Repetition of telegram to His Majesty’s Minister). Finances of Governor-General. I am asked by the Governor-General to beg you to sanction the prompt disbursement of £5,000, representing one month’s proportion of £15,000. He points out that of the present Persian year less than 2J months remain, and that in consequence, the disbursements which are provided for the last three months of the financial year are already a fortnight in arrear. He has already incurred considerable liabilities in anticipation on the lines of his budget estimates; in addition, he is urging on me and on Major Siefvert the necessity of starting off the arms caravan from Bushire. Expenditure in this connection will he met in part from the £15,000 under regular headings of his budget such as salaries, munitions of war, Darya Begi’s expenses, etc. With the exception of actual mule hire (which he estimates at 4,000 Tomans, he can meet other extraordinary expenditure him self. The last named item, will, it is presumed by the Governor-General, eventually be met from gendarmerie funds, but in view of the urgency of the matter and as cash down must be paid to the muleteers, he begs that permis sion may be accorded to him to pay this sum out of the funds now to be placed at his disposal, and that it may subsequently he repaid by the Central Gov ernment. The Governor-General being entirely unprovided with funds of any kind, either to make arrangements for the carriage of the arms, or to conduct his ordinary administration, I beg to support his request, and to ask that I may be permitted to place the sum of 20,000 Tomans at the disposal of the Treasurer-General’s agent at Shiraz by whom it should be disbursed to the Governor-General in consultation with me, on the lines of the budget proposals, notwithstanding that Monsieur Mornard has as yet not had time to examine the estimates thoroughly, as in view of the circumstances of the case, I con sider it essential that sanction should be accorded to expenditure of the sum proposed.

As far as I can judge Major Brandel and the Governor have established a satisfactory working understanding and former’s work is proceeding well. Out of the 80 men co lected for him on approval by the Governor he has approved 56 and is on the whole pleased with the material. The Governor says he is prepared to get 24 more to make up the 80. There are also 50 said to be ready waiting at Borasjun and Governor will assist to make this number up to 150 if necessary. Major Brandel is anxious to get these into Bushire for training and expects to have his 200 new men complete in two or three weeks and desires to remain here until they are ready for the road. He points out that in case he meets with any trouble on the road it is essential that he should have sufficient time to give his maxim detachment sufficient training before they start.

He has satisfied me that his only reason for interesting himself in the case of the local celebrity Abdul Rasool was because he was led by his subordinates to believe that the reasons for that individual’s detention by the Governor were directly connected with the gendarmerie’s affairs and that since it was demonstrated to him by myselt and others that this story was an invention of local intriguers he has disassocia ted himself entirely from all interest in the man’s case.

Eckford DELHI SUPERINTENDENT GOVERNMENT PRINTING, INDIA 18130 From A/o. qjji. Lieutenant-Colonel J. A. DOUGLAS, Commanding 39th King George’s Own Central India Horse, To The CHIEF of the GENERAL STAFF, SIMLA. Dated 19th December 1912. Shiraz. S. Persia. I have the honour to forward a detailed report by Major A. M. Kettlewell of the attack on a party of the regiment of which he was in charge, and which resulted in the death of Captain A. B. Eckford and the loss of 9 mules and their loads. 1. Major Kettlewell and Captain Eckford had obtained permission from me to go to Dasht Arjin partly with the object of shooting and partly to carry out some survey work in that neighbourhood under the superintendence of the latter officer, who was himself a trained surveyor. The larger portion of the regiment have now been in Shiraz for more than a year, and owing to the disturbed state of the country and my desire to assist the political authorities by avoiding incidents which must necessarily prove embarrassing to them, the movements of officers and men have until quite recently been strictly confined to within a few miles of the city. 2. In the middle of October a new Governor General of the province reached here from Teheran and his arrival was immediately followed by a great improvement in the security of the neighbourhood. The tribesmen had mostly moved down to their winter quarters in the plains and the more lawless elements were, temporarily at least, quiet. The particular portion of the road on which the party were moving had moreover been taken over by the gendarmerie more than a month ago ; since then Swedish officers accompanied only by a small escort had been moving freely over it, and travellers and caravans had been unmolested. Under these circumstances I thought I was justified in allowing officers somewhat greater latitude in their movements and consequently sanc tioned the expedition which ended so disastrously for the regiment, subject only to the approval of His Majesty’s Consul and the Governor General of the province. 3. Since the arrival of the regiment in Persia little more than a year ago, officers and men have been fired at on twelve different occasions, and six of these incidents have occurred within 5 miles of Shiraz itself. It is therefore purely a matter of chance that there have been no casualties among officers before. In August last Lieutenant W. Fraser, while returning home after dark, accompanied by a single orderly, was attacked by 5 armed men within a few hundred yards of the Consulate and escaped only by galloping at and through his assailants; his orderly had a button shot off his coat, the bullet afterwards passing through his sleeve. For none of these outrages has any satisfaction been obtained. 4. I cannot sufficiently express my regret that myhostion in sanctioning this expedition has resulted in Captain Eckford’s death. He was a most able and valuable officer, who had justly earned the respect and admiration of all ranks. I look upon his death as a serious loss not only to the regiment hut to the whole Indian Army. I am forwarding a copy of this despatch with enclosure to His Majesty’s Minister at Teheran. I have the honour to he, Sir, Your obedient Servant, J. A. DOUGLAS, Lieut.-Colonel^ Commanding 39th King George's Otcn Central India Dorse.Report by Major Kettle well on the movements of a Sur vey Party of the 39th Central India Horse marching from Khan-i-Zinian to Dasht-i-Arj an on 11th December 1912. (The party consisted of Major Kettlewell, Captain Eckford, Jemadar Soraiyan Singh, 12 men (including a surveyor) of A squadron, 12 men of B squadron, 2 officers’ orderlies, 17 followers and 17 baggage mules). I started from Khan-i-Zinian at 7 a.m., half an hour after a party of Sarbazes (Persian Infantry), who were marching down the road. I told off the 12 men of A squadron to act as baggage-guard and td remain with the mules, and used the men of B squadron as an advanced guard and for scouting purposes. Moving from the Caravanserai down to the Kara-Agach Biver I had scouts out on the low hills on the right of the road. These scouts had orders to rejoin the party at the bridge. This they did. Until near the river I was accompanied by the Persian officer of gendar merie with two sowars from Khan-i-Zinian. These then galloped on ahead to visit their post at the tower on the crest of the Sineh Safid Pass. Almost immediately after the Gendarmes had left me I sent Jemadar Soraiyan Singh and 2 sowars, with orders to trot on to Dasht-i-Arjan, in order to arrive there before the Sarbazes, and secure accommodation for my men, about which I knew there would be some difficulty. I then crossed the river, sending 2 scouts on to a small isolated hill (about 300 feet high), about 700 yards S.-W. of the bridge. I halted on the far bank for ten to fifteen minutes to close up my party before entering the strip of thorn and tamarisk jungle, through which the road passes for about 1J miles. I started on again at about 8 a m., sending a scout to ride along the ridge (about 200 feet above the road), which rises some 400 yards beyond the isolated hill mentioned above. I sent forward 2 scouts to get up on to the next hill beyond this ridge, and 2 scouts to ride ahead on the road. The 2 scouts who had been on the first hill then rejoined me, and my advanced party then consisted of Captain Eckford, myself, our 2 orderlies and 5 men of B squadron. At 8-20 a.m. this advanced party had got about 200 yards clear of the strip of jungle and the leading baggage mules were just appearing out of it when a hot fire was opened on us from the hills 300 yards to our left. The advanced party galloped to get under the shelter of a hill about 350 yards to the left front, and the 4 leading mules and 4 followers joined it here. This hill is of convex section, so that on reaching it we were under cover. All the hills near are thickly covered with scrub jungle, so that so far we had seen nothing of our attackers. On reaching the foot of the hill we dismounted and leaving two men with our horses began to climb the hill which was frozen hard and very slippery. We had climbed about 40 yards up the hill and I personally could still see nothing of the enemy, but some of the men must have done so, as they were firing a few shots in return to the fire which was falling all round us. At this moment Captain Eckford was in the act of taking aim with his revolver when he suddenly gave a lurch and fell. He was a yard away from me on my left. I went to him and he gasped out “ they have hit me” and after that became quite unconscious. I left two men with him, and his servant who was down below came up to him. I then with the three remaining men moved a little higher up and towards the E. edge of the spur on which we then were. I could then (across a wooded ravine which ran up into the hills) see some of the enemy on the opposite side (this was the end of the ridge along which I had sent my scout), and as I reached the edge, I saw from 150 to 200 of the enemy rush out from the bottom of the ravine and cross about 30 yards of open ground and disappear into the jungle beyond. The first 50 or so of these men had rifles, the remainder appeared to be unarmed.Ls l low I and the men with me hi ed at them, hut I could not see whether any of them were hit. Up to this time I had no knowledge of what had happened to the men of A squadron and the rest of the baggage mules, hut had seen several of the fol lowers run off into the jungle directly the first shots were fired. From where I now was I could see some of the mules emerging from the jungle into the open bed of the river. They were quickly surrounded by Persians and taken away out of my sight. 1 1 could also see one or twm men of A squadron, wTio had got on to the hills N. of the river. Shots were still being fired at us from the top of the hills on our side. My object now was to try and collect the whole of my men and to remove Captain Eckford. I went back to him and found that he was quite unconscious but he seemed to be still breathing. I had him carried down the hill and put on to a horse in front of one of the men and then leaving three men to cover my retirement, with orders to rejoin me at a gallop as soon as I was 400 yards clear. I pro ceeded with the followers and mules, as fast as I could to the right bank of the river. On the way I Teas joined by Jemadar Soraiyan Singh and the tw r o men who had gone with him. He reported to me that he had overtaken the Sarbazes about half w r ay up the road to the tower on the top of the Sineh Safid Pass (some three miles ahead), he had then heard the firing. He asked the Persian officer of the Sar bazes to return, which he refused to do, and he himself then came back at a gallop, along the bed of the river. As I approached the right bank of the river one of the men of A squadron galloped up to me and reported that his party with some followers and mules was on a hill just ahead. I joined them and found that one syce and several mules were missing ; Sowar Pooran Singh (the scout I had sent on to the ridge when I left the river after halting) was also reported to be missing, but was shortly after reported to be present. Having collected my party I placed the followers, led horses and mules in charge of Jemadar Soraiyan Singh with orders to keep well under the left bank of the river and level with me, here they were absolutely under cover from the N. and had a certain amount of concealment from view on the S. afforded by a line of tamarisk bushes in the bed of the river. The country to the N. consists of low rolling hills for several miles with a few bushes here and there on them, but the watercourses which run into the river are fairly thickly covered with scrub. I moved along these hills with my men in two sections, sending these sections forward alternately and thus reached the road just beyond the bridge at 11-30 a m. On the way I saw about 15 to 20 mounted men on a ridge about 1.500 yards to the N. and several men on foot in the ravines nearer to me with whom I exchanged shots and saw at least one of them hit. I also saw 50 or 60 men with rifles on the bridge, but could not ascertain who they were. They eventually disappeared. Desultory shots were being fired most of the time from the hills S. of the river and I saw 3 horsemen moving along these hills from the direction of the Sineh Safid Pass. These after a time I recognized to be Persian gendarmes. On nearing the bridge I saw 80 or 40 men, some with rifles on a small hill 400 yards in front of me and was preparing to fire on them when they disappeared. Shortly afterwards about 20 men appeared without arms and I went up to them. They were men from Khan-i-Zinian, and the telegraph ghulam was with them. Directly after my horses and mules had crossed the bridge I was joined by the Persian officer of gendarmerie. He told me that he had 3 or 4 men wounded and asked me for help to bring them in, but some of the villagers and riflemen from the village (offered ?) to do this. He then went off and I did not see him again till about 4-30 p.m. I now mounted my men and moved, with scouts out on the hill to the N. back to the sarai at Khan-i-Zinian.On reaching the sarai I found that one of my horses had been shot through the chest, one man had been slightly wounded in the heel and one syce was still missing. . The missing syce turned up at 2 p.m. He said that he had run on into the jungle and remained hidden. ' Nine mules with their loads had been carried off, and several followers had been stripped of their hoots and some of their clothing. When I was leaving the sarai in the morning there was a small party of Persians (consisting of 3 women, 2 children with 2 attendants, 2 pairs of kajawas on mules and 3 other baggage mules) getting ready to start. These must have followed close behind me or caught me up when I halted (though I did not see them), as they were robbed and their mules carried off by the tribesmen who attacked me. „ , ^ On reaching the river I saw a few of the Sarbazes who had started m iront of me, resting on the far hank. They had disappeared before I got across. I saw no one else on the road either going or coming back. ^ The only other people in the sarai the night before were a few charvardars with a small caravan going to Shiraz. On reaching the sarai I connected my telephone to the telegraph line and tried to get into communication with Shiraz, hut without success, so I waited until 2 p.m. which I knew was the hour for testing the line, and I then succeeded in reporting what had occurred. During the afternoon 4 wounded gendarmes were brought into the sarai. As far as I could ascertain these had been shot on the hills to the S. They had been stripped of their arms and ammunition. When I was working back along the left bank of the river I saw tracks of the party who had attacked me ; they had then cleared away to the N. . . „ ,, Duffadar Mahomed Zaman, the non-commissioned officer m charge ot the baggage guard, states:— „ . T , As soon as the firing started, the syces having fled, I collected my men and tried to drive the mules into shelter, but I was almost immediately surrounded by about 100 tribesmen who came rushing down the hill and seized hold ot the mules. 15 to 20 horsemen also came up from behind. I then with what mules I could get hold of, took my men across the river. As I was moving across about 30 to 40 horsemen came out from the opposite baUk [ o-ot my men on to a small hill on the other side of the river and opened fire on the enemy, some of whom tried to make an attack on me, viti t t object of carrying off the mules I had with me, hut they were driven back by mv fire. They then went off up a ravine towards the N. and were quickly followed by the others, who had first seized the mules. I saw them carry off 4 men who had been hit. , j k .i They carried off about 14 mules altogether, i e , about 5 more than they had oet from me. I saw no other mules anywhere in the neighbourhood. A short time after they had gone off I was joined by you. Shiraz, 16th December 1912. A. M.

Foreign Minister visited British Minister yesterday and said that Government was sincerely anxious to improve trade route of South Persia, but that embarrassments of finances paralysed its efforts; murder of Eckford had furnished Government with fresh incentive to finish once and for all question of policing routes and he submitted to Minister scheme drawn up by Colonel Hjalmarson, head of gendarmerie, to organise besides fixed posts for gendarmes flying columns to be stationed at Bushire, Borasjoon, Kazeroon, Shiraz, Denbid and Yczdikhast. - f V2 Scheme suggested organisation and maintenance for three years of force of 1,796 men at estimated cost of £350,000, only half of which would be needed immediately: he asked British Minister to obtain advance from British of money which would he placed entirely at disposal of Colonel Hjalmarson; gendarmery would thus encounter no financial difficulties in execution of task. Premier Samsam es Sultaneh has definitely resigned and new Cabinet of Ala es Sultaneh not containing Bakhtiari element will assume office as soon as Regent’s authorisation arrives. Enclosure No. 2.

Finances of Governor- General of Fars. In reply to your telegram No. 3, I have the honour to state that I am assured by the Inspector that on January 5th he telegraphed the budget figures to the Treasurer-General. It seems impossible that it should not have been received by him. Without M. Mornard’s sanction, M. Stas cannot pay out the money, so matters are at a deadlock. I have already reported that there is urgent need for the money. Could you he so good as to ask the Treasurer-General to telegraph at once authorizing the Treasury Agent to make payments on the lines of the budget estimates, in regard to which M. Stas holds the same views as I do, i.e., that though they may require modifications in matters of detail later on, their provisions are gene rally speaking suitable in character, whilst all expenditure provided for therein is legitimate and necessary for the proper conduct of the administration of the province.

(Repetition of telegram No. 13 to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran.) On January 8th Monsieur Stas arrived here and I have had several conr versations with him on the subject of affairs in Pars. I have given him a general review of the situation here and of the necessity of co-operating cordially with the Governor-General and of so directing the expenditure of £15,000 as to place the administration on a stable basis and to provide a suitable mobile force for the Governor-General. I have also warned him how delicate his position here is, and how strong local prejudices are, and have pointed out to him the impossibility of conducting financial administration upon hard and fast lines. Stas quite agrees to this and I arranged a meeting with the Governor-General at which he and I and the Inspector were present. The whole situation was passed under review in a frank and amicable spirit. I hope to inform you later on of the chief points which were raised. Enclosure No. 4.

The cost of doing so is reckoned by him at Tomans 5,700. No funds are available to him out of which this charge can he met and if the Persian Government or the gendarmerie have to meet it I would ask you to he so good as to sanction its advance by Monsieur Stas out of the £15,000, and to recover it as soon as he can out of the money allotted for the expenses of the gendarmerie by the Persian Government. t I am 'figures 'e been ney, so Could hoiking nates, in they may ire gene* ir therein n of tie Enclosure No. 5. Telegram P., No. 12, dated and received the 14th January 1913. Prom—His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To'—The Political Resident, Bushire. (Repetition of telegram No. 15 to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran.) Your telegram No. 184. I am informed by M. Stas that no answer has as yet been vouchsafed from Tehran to questions which are daily be coming more pressing and he gives me to understand that he is addressing M. Mornard himself on the subject. It is understood that it is proposed to make payments (of arrears to troops) by assignments of the current year’s revenue, that it is expected that it will he possible to compromise the arrears for a small proportion of the whole. It is also proposed to meet some other urgent expenses, such as the repair of barracks for the accommodation of the new force, by similar means. Both Monsieur Stas, and Mirza Mustafa Khan, the Inspector, and all other subordinates of the Treasurer-General with whom I have talked in confidence, complain of the extreme difficulty they experience in obtaining an answer to their most urgent communications from Mornard, who seems to have an inconvenient habit of leaving unanswered difficult questions, a course which involves his local agents in much difficulty and inconvenience. It is, I think, especially necessary that questions arising in Pars should be disposed of promptly by him, as the financial position is a desperate one, and it is His Majesty’s Government who is providing a proportion of the funds which {vide my telegram No. 12) he is now withholding, and we are in con sequence interested in their prompt disbursement. an.) iieralcok &gt; necessity icting tk sis anitfl io warned are, and inistration a meeting e present spirit' ed. m.) Enclosure No. 6. Telegram P., No. 13, dated and received the 14th January 1913. From—His Majesty's Consul Shiraz. To—The Resident, Bushire. / (Repetition of telegram No. 16, to His Majesty's Minister Tehran.) At the meeting with the Mukhbir es Saltaneh on the 12th it was pointed out by M. Stas that although the Governor-General would be enabled to carry on his administration until the end of the current financial year and lay the foundation for a small mobile force and of a system of road guards, by the judicious expenditure of £15,000 he would nevertheless find himself once more penniless at the beginning of next financial year, at least four months before the time when it would be possible to collect any considerable ^ surn in the form of revenue. He also laid emphasis on the fact that the situation would in some respects be even worse than before, since the Governor-General would have assumed responsibility for a large body of armed men, who would inevitably cause trouble when they found their pay, which they had been accustomed to receive regularly, for three months, suddenly stopped. H was estimated by the Monsieur Stas that the normal monthly expenditure oi the province (gendarmerie excluded) amounts to seme Tomans 40,000 and it is believed by the Inspector that under favourable circumstances Tomans 450,000 could be raised as revenue during next financial year. Revenue and expenditure could thus be made to balance, but in order to keep the machinery at work at all, it is essential that funds should be assured for the first 4 or preferably 6 months of the year, that is to say, a sum of from160,000 to 240,000 Tomans should be placed at the disposal of the Government of this province. The truth and justice of Monsieur Stas’s observations is undeniable. Unless the Governor-General has funds wherewith to conduct the admi nistration of Tars for the first months of the Persian year commencing on March 22nd, it is certain that the whole machine will stop work, and the money now to he spent will have been wasted. Having once begun to finance the administration of Tars, it would seem impossible for us to withdraw from the task until the Governor-General finds himself in a position to collect his own taxes and to maintain public security. When he is strong enough to do this, his revenue should suffice to meet his normal requirements. In the meantime, however, we should, I venture to think, be prepared to continue to provide the sinews of war if we wish the province not to lapse into a state even worse than that in which it now is. The actual sum which it would be necessary to advance in the near future would be, say, £40,000, to £50,000, which might be lent on the security of the revenues of Tars and might be left under the same conditions of security and control as were imposed in the case of the £15,000. I propose to address you a further communication regarding the gen darmerie, which is a separate question. Enclosure No. 7. Telegram P., No. 26-90, dated the 14th January 1913. Prom —The Political Resident, Bushire, To—His Majesty^s Minister, Tehran. Deposits of money amounting from 12,000 to 15,000 tomans, the property, it appears, of certain Buwair Ahmad Chiefs, are in Bushire, partly with the Imperial Bank of Persia and partly with an Armenian merchant, who is British Naval Contractor. Negotiations for the withdrawal of these deposits are now in progress. M^ould you consider, in consultation with Wood, the expediency of asking the Persian Government to make a request to us to hold up this money. I am not prepared to say that the deposits are the property of parties actually concerned in recent incidents, but it is conceivable that they may be. The Bank may disburse shortly, so the matter needs early settlement. Enclosure No. 8. Telegram P., No. IP, dated and received the 15th Januaryl913. From—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Political Resident, Bnshire. (Repitition of telegram No. 9 to Shiraz.) I have the honour to inform you with reference to your telegram No. 14, that Colonel Hjalmarson states that he cannot permit the new rifles to be handed over to the Governor-General for the use of his new force, because in the hands of Persians not under European Officers they Avould be speedily spoiled. More over, as the gendarmerie in the south of Persia develops the whole 1,500 will be required. He is loth to make an arrangement under which the arms would be replaced by others ordered from Europe, because it points out that the arms in question were ordered 18 months ago and have not even yet reached Shiraz. As a proof however of his readiness to assist the Governor-General he has offered to hand over to the latter the rifles that the gendarmerie at Shiraz now have, together with adequate ammunition. They number about 500. As to the cost of transporting the arms and ammunition from Bushire, he says that he was not prepared for their coming so soon v and that he has not got the necessary financial provision under this head ; he says however that if we will provide for the balance, he can find 3,000 tomans.I think we may justifiably sanction this expenditure if you agree, as our doing so will mean that the Governor-General will get the old rifles for himself. Colonel Hjalmarson states that at the beginning of March about 320 men of the new gendarmes will leave for Pars with Swedish officers, and that he him self will probably accompany them. A further detachment of 600 men will leave at the end of April, bringing as I understand, artillery with them. Enclosure No. 9. Telegram P., No. 20, dated and received the 15th January 1913. .From—His Majesty ; s Minister, Tehran, To—The Political Resident, Bushire. (Repetition of telegram No. 10 to Shiraz.) Your telegram No. 16 reached me just as I had drafted a telegram to you calling your attention to the situation with which we should be confronted after Nau Euz. The reasons you mention convince me also that unless some remedy can be found between now and then, the situation will be even more disappointing than at present. Moreover, we must not lose sight of the fact that it is in April and May that Maliat has to be collected by the migratory tribes, and that if it is realized that Governor-General is not in possession of any funds at that moment, his position will be a most onerous one. I am very pleased that you and Stas should have looked forward to the future, and I will do what I can to make His Majesty’s Government realize that it is essential that the Governor-General should not be left unprovided with funds even for a short time, as to do so would render abortive the good work which has been begun. At the same time every effort should be made to cut down expenditure. Stas’s estimates seem to me to be very highly pitched and I trust that it may be possible to reduce them somewhat. If any revenues are to be recovered next year, some portion must surely come in during April and May, so that I should think £ 30,000 or provision for four months should suffice. It will be possible, as soon as money begins to come in and order is restored to make some arrangement as suggested by Governor-General to Smart, for financing the administration by the Imperial Bank of Persia. Enclosure No. 10. Telegram P., No. 21, dated and [received the 15th January 1913. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Political Resident, Bushire. (Repetition of telegram No. 11 to Shiraz.) Your telegram No. 15. Mornard is being urged to issue the necessary sanction for enabling the proposed arrangement for meeting arrears of pay to be given effect to. On January 13th he promised me that telegraphic sanction would at once be accorded to Stas to make use of the 20,000 tomans, in the manner you sug gested in your telegram No. 12. The Treasurer-General tries to do too much, and cannot possibly dispose, personally and alone, of all the confusing questions which are brought before him. This, I believe, is the real reason of these unfortunate delays at critical moments which are of too frequent occurrence. Enclosure No. 11. Telegram P., No. 14, dated and received the 15th January 1913. From—His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To—The Political Resident, Bushire. (Repetition of telegram No. 17 to His Majesty's Minister Tehran.) With reference to my telegram No. 12, I have the honour to state that I am now informed by the [Agent to the Treasurer-General here that sanctionlias reached him from M. Mornard enabling him to disburse the 20,000 tomans in conformity with the figures of the budget. I am accordingly transferring tbe amount to his credit to ’ay. Will you he so good as to make a similar arrangement with the Bank for the credit of another 7,000 tomans, which represents approximately the sum needed to make up the disbursements of one month, on budget lints. Enclosure Xo. 12. Telegram P., No. 15, dated and received the 15th January 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To—The Political Resident, Bushire. (Repetition of telegram No. 18 to Tehran.) Revenue prospects.—In reference to your telegram No 10. Neither Mukhbir-es-Saltaneh nor M. Stas seem to think that much chance exists or their being in a position to get any revenue in before July. The fact is that the tribesmen, and indeed the hulk of the tax-paying popu lation, have got out of the way of paying any taxes, and it is not a habit they are likely to resume until the Governor-General is strong enough to coerce them. In any case, however, I am- sure that every effort will be made by Monsieur Stas both to reduce expenditure and to induce the Governor-General to collect as much revenue as he possibly can. His chief anxiety is that no financial hiatus should occur between the end of this financial year and the beginning of the next. I will consult him as to [what is the smallest sum which in his opinion it will he necessary to obtain on loan. Enclosure No. 13. Extract from Renters, January 16th. London, IGth. Replying to Mr. Hoare in House of Commons Sir E. Grey said he was well aware' of difficulties of Persian Gendarmerie owing to irregularity and insufficiency of its pay. Imperial Government had advanced a further sum of £15,000 in December for the requirements of the Government of Ears. Grey said he was now con sidering what more could be done to assist gendarmerie, report of whose efficiency had favourably impressed Government. Enclosure No. 11. Telegram P., No. 16, dated and received the 16th January 1913. From—His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To—The Political Resident, Bushire. (Repetition of telegram No. 19 t) Minister.) Arms and ammunition at Bushire. In reference to your telegram No. 9, I have the honour to report that I am informed by Major Siefvert that Colonel Hjalinarson has telegraphed to him that if in present circumstances he considers the carriage of these arms to he too risky an operation, he should not attempt it. Major Siefvert says that he has never much relished the idea of bringing up the arms under the arrangements which are now proposed, and that he does not consider in view of the instructions just received from Colonel Hjalmarson, that he would be justified in making any attempt to perform tire operation. He therefore intends to tell Major Braudel, who is at Bushire, to leave the bulk of the arms there, and to bring with him merely such quantities as are actually necessary for the new recruits or possibly a few more, deferring the transportation of the remainder until the gendarmerie is strong enough to bring them up in perfect safety. I am not desirous of criticizing the decision arrived at by Colonel IIjalmarson and Major Siefvert. I think that they a e quite right in not rif i®running what they consider to be undue risk in an undertaking of such importance, failure in whicii would be their responsibility. At the same time, however, I should like to indicate how the decision seems likely to aifect the general situation in the province. Since mv arrival here the Governor-General has kept on impressing upon me the importance of consolidating his position with the least possible delay, lie has pointed out that under existing circumstances he is not strong enough to enforce his orders or to take any of the numerous measures which the restoration of order in this province demands. Every day that passes he says, leaving him in such anomalous position, weakens his prestige and that of the Persian Government generally and acts as an incentive to the insubordinate and lawless elements of the province. Ih ery kind of intrigue surrounds him, and can be put an end to only by force. ^ \\ ith the early arrival of these arms he had hoped to be able to proceed to a pacifica tion of^the country noth the newly organized force, and to be ready before Nan Kuz to assert himself in the direction desired. In view of the Commandant’s decision regarding the arms it is to be feared that the Governor-General is unlikely to be any better oh m the Spring tnan he is at present, and that in consequence until the gendarmerie arrive from Tehran, punitive measures must be postponed as also the restoration ox order. No doubt this wall occasion some inconvenience and it may be expected that the local situation in the Spring will be unpleasant, but so long as event lui retribution may be anticipated eventually, we can be prepared to accept such troubles philosophically. The only matter which the delay is likely to picjimicc seriouly is the question of the cavalry regiment here. His Maiesty’s Government would, I presume desire that the regiment should leave Shiraz as soon as possible, and it had been hoped by me that return of the Kegiment to Bushire might have been arranged for if the Governor- General had succeeded in strengthening his position by f« I that as matters seem to be trending at present they will be unable to leave before the Autumn. On this Question however, I will take the liberty of addressing you again. I fear the Mukhbir will be much disappointed when Colonel Idqalmarson s decision comes to his ears. Enclosuie No. 15.

Your telegram No. 19. Having regard to the decision of Major Siefvert not to bring them up from Bushire for the present, would it not he possible for the Governor-General to order suitable arms and sufficient ammunition from India, as has been done at Kerman ? Of course you and Sir P. Cox would have to be satisfied that adequate measures were being taken for the protection of the arms caravan. A much more imposing force, it seems to me, would be necessary for the protection of the gendarmerie’s arms in Spring than would now be required, as the roads are presumably comparatively clear at present, but we cannot take the responsibility of influencing the decision arrived at by Major Siefvert under instructions from here as to the necessity for caution. The serious inconvenience this development may cause to _ His Excellency the Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh, and the effect it may have on his position is much to be regretted. Enclosure No. 17.

Unless good reasons exist for thinking that the Buwair Ahmad Chiefs are withdrawing their money with a view to tire purchase of arms which may be used against us or against a force of the Persian Government, I do not think that I can take the step which you suggest. The Bank would naturally take exception to being called on to take action which their clients might regard as a breach of confidence, and it would seem as things are now shaping that it is the Kuhgilu* rather than the Buwair Ahmad who are responsible for the outrage of December 11th.

I am not disposed to find funds for Major Brandel’s journey, as it seems clear now that the Governor-General will not get these arms, as the bulk of arms and ammunition is to come up to Shiraz later on.

Telegram P., No. 37-115, dated the 19th January 1918. rf ‘' From—The Political Resident, Bushire, To—His Majesty's Foreign Office, London. (Repeated to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department and His Majesty's Minister, Tehran.) The possibility seems to be adumbrated by recent Reuters’ telegrams from Tehran and London that His Majesty’s Government may have under lively consideration the arguments for and against granting a further respite to the Persian Government for restoring order on the Bushire-Ispahan road and generally in this province. If such is the case it can only be in conjunction with an extensive scheme for the financing of the Governor-General by the Imperial Government. Without reference to the prospects of any such scheme, I venture to urge, in case any such project is in contemplation, the importance of our securing, in return for such forbearance, the preliminary settlement by the Persian Govern ment of various desiderata, the regulation of which would help to consolidate our position and our legitimate interests. So considerable a loss is involved both to our trade and to our good name by any further exhibition of patience that it would appear gratuitously quixotic for us to refrain from requiring the Persian Government, as a condition thereof, to recompense us as far as lies in their power for the damage which their impotence has wrought. No difficulty or loss of authority is involved to the Persian Government by the satisfaction of our requirements in these matters, and it is moreover not our position vis-a-vis Persia that we seek to better thereby, but our position vis-a- vis Foreign Powers. Persia should be interested little less than ourselves in the strengthening of this latter position if, as she has every reason to do, she now regards Great Britain as a friend whose policy it is to keep her on on her feet. The following are the desiderata which suggested themselves to me. Firstly. —Documentary recognition of our prescriptive rights to control the lighting, buoying and policing of the Gulf in the same way that our posi tion has been recognized in respect of quarantine, in regard to which the posi tion might with advantage be incidentally re-affirmed. Secondly .—Documentary recognition, as a permanency, of the old pres criptive postal rights and privileges which we still enjoy and an expression of readiness to see the same rights applied to other Persian Ports of the Gulf as occasion may require. Thirdly .—Hndertaking to refrain from giving to any foreign subject, or foreign Government, any lease or commercial or other concession in Southern or South-Western Persia (i.#., in the area comprising the British and central zones under the Anglo-Russian Convention) or in the Persian Islands of the Gulf. Marling’s telegram August 27th, 1909, to Foreign Office (repeated to Foreign, August 28th), affords a precedent for such a request in the undertaking given by the Shah to the Russian Minister. Possibly this undertaking couldbe secured in the course of the negotiations for a mining concession now Fourthly -Extension of rights of navigation to Tipper Karun.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copy of a telegram which I have deemed it expedient to address to His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz, explaining what would appear to me to be the most desirable attitude to adopt under present circumstances, both on the general situation and towards the Governor-General’s military and financial schemes. Under the peculiar circumstances of the moment it was desirable, I thought, to give Major O’Connor some definite line of action to adopt. Had the question not been of a pressing nature I should, of course, have submitted all the correspondence to you, sir, and awaited your instructions, but our hands having been forced by the unfortunate incident of the 11th instant, I trust that you will not consider that I have exceeded my functions in submitting my views to Major O’Connor for his guidance at a particularly difficult moment, when the permanent schemes being elaborated by Mukhber-es-Sultaneh have unavoidably somewhat clashed with the special punitive measures in course of preparation. I have dealt with the military scheme in my immediately preceding despatch, and propose to devote a subsequent despatch to the financial question. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Sir W. Townley to Acting Consul Smart. (No. 178.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 20, 1912. I HAVE had your telegrams Nos. 204, 205, and 208 under most careful consideration. I have forwarded the first two on to the Foreign Office by post, submitting such portions of them as it seemed essential to bring to the early notice of the Government by telegraph, as you will have seen by the telegrams repeated to you. I am not yet in possession of Sir E. Grey’s views. I concur up to a certain point in your opinion that the unfortunate incident resulting in Captain Eckford’s death does not alter the fact that since the Governor-General’s arrival there has been marked improvement in the state of the province. Still I cannot but consider it, taken in con junction with the many petty incidents of the past year, another very serious link in the chain of evidence that goes to show that the Persian Government are unable to protect the life and property of foreigners, and that unless some real step in this direction is taken by them immediately it will be extremely difficult for His Majesty’s Government to refrain from coming in and doing the necessary to re-establish order, despite the expense that such measures would entail, and the possible consequences that might ensue. It appears to me that our good name and fame must suffer irretrievably if we consent to sit down and allow such incidents to be repeated at our expense. I am fully alive to the excellent qualities of the Governor-General, and his evident determination to re-establish order, and for his sake I am more than sorry to have to advocate a forward policy to he undertaken before he has time, I am afraid, to mature his schemes and put his machinery into motion. In accordance with your views I am advocating a deky of four months to give him a chance, but in doing so I am more than sceptical as to his being able to do anything decisive in the time. It seems to me, however, that to accord a longer delay would mean to risk incurring the contempt of the tribesmen. W^ithout a considerable sum of money the Governor-General cannot do much, and where is he to get more ? I do not think that our Government will be disposed to go beyond the 15,000Z., and such a small sum will not suffice, m my opinion, for the purpose in hand, and for other necessary expenditure. [2763 /—7] C f~ r \ f O r i O 1 7 FEB 1913 i SECRETARY’S N2 sI quite understand and fully approve the Governor-Generafs idea of forming a, force of some 1,000 picked men, and no doubt it would be ideal if such a force could be put under some British officer having the gift of inspiring Persians with confidence. Here again there is a hateful “ but.” I cannot think that it would be possible to have two military forces in one place commanded by foreign officers of different nationalities. ^ The situation thus created would, I think, lead to endless jealousy and trouble. The ^ Governor-General would naturally seek to enrol the best men, and the Swedes would cry out that he was favouring the corps under British officers at their expense. It would hardly be fair on the Swedes to declare them a failure at Shiraz. Such a deck- ration would affect their position vitally throughout Peisia, and if they are to lemam at Shiraz, the idea of British officers for a separate corps must, X think, be abandoned until their failure has been proved. I v/ould prefer a scheme which would mean a force of from 3,000 to 4,000 men, under Swedish officers, to do general as well as gendarmerie work. Such a force would require a large sum of money for its maintenance, but should suffice to entirely restore order. Were His Majesty’s Government to put up 200,0001. or 300,0001. as a debt on the Persian Government to maintain such a force effectively for three years it would cost much less than an expedition. I am quite aware that the presence of the Anglo-Indian troops at Shiraz may be held responsible, in a way, for the situation, but they are there, whether or no it was a mistake to send them there, and it is our duty, I think, to see that they are treated with courtesy and honour. They at least cannot be held responsible for the repeated outrages on caravans and for the persistent blackmailing that prevails. As to the financial agent, I doubt very much if the Governor-General would be more ready in his heart to accept the assistance and advice of an Englishman rather than that of a Belgian. When Lecoffre was appointed he said that he would not go to Shiraz unless his appointment was cancelled. He is a Persian of the old school, who can with difficulty brook interference in what he considers to be the governor’s functions. He is an intelligent and pleasant man, but he is not a good man of business, nor is he an easy man to deal with when he considers his own prerogative at stake. Being an honest man himself, he knows that he would administer the finances of the province as well as he could, but he has dishonest men round him, and the two Govern ments have undertaken to support a financial administration conducted by Belgians, in the hope that such a scheme may produce permanent good. The fact that we have advanced 15,000L to the Persian Government for the expenses of the administration of the province would not justify us in asking for a separate financial control which would have far-reaching results. To succeed in his task Mornard must have his own men that he knows and trusts, and who are trained in his methods. I much hope that you will find Stas better than you expect. Your telegram No. 213 just received. You will have gathered from the above that I approve the idea of a special force, but in my opinion, subject to the approval of of the home Government, such a force, if officered by foreigners, should be organised by the Swedes.Enclosis' A'o. 4 ? r fr &gt;? /-■ 1 , ' ' 0 *^rv, ^3 JAN » d 13 Put away with.

In continuation of my letter dated December 29th, I enclose a copy of a letter from Major Kettlewell to^ Major Hewlett, which the latter has communicated unofficially to me, enclosing a copy of his official report of what happened when Captain Eckford was killed. Dated 18th December 1912. From—M ajor Kettlewell, Shiraz, To—M ajor Hew'lett, Bushire. I enclose a copy of my official report of what happened when Eckford was killed. Will you please send it and this letter on to Daunt, 'when you have read them. It is cruel to think that the only material damage was done by that one unfortunate shot. Eckford was quite unconscious from the first and the Doctor tells me that hit as he was through the heart death must have been nearly instantaneous. Had it not been for having to look after him I am sure we should have given our assail ants w r ho numbered at least 400 (not all armed) a severe lesson and recovered our mules. As it was I had to get my party back to Khan-i-Zinian and expected to have to fight my way back, as the Persian Officer of Gendarmes who turned up at the bridge three hours after the show started, then told me that the Khan-i-Zinian people were in it. He contradicted this in the evening. The statements in Reuters are absolutely false and we have wired to the Minister to con tradict them. The truth is that 6 Gendarmes with Tufangchis from Zinian came out long after most of the show was over. The Gendarmes unfortunately for them came across some of the mounted men who attacked us. Four Gendarmes were wounded and stripped of their arms and ammunition and the rest fled. These wounded Gendarmes say they saw 7 badly wounded men carried off 4 by the enemy and 2 wounded horses were caught so they djdnT get off free. I brought EckfonPs body in here and he was buried on Friday, the whole regiment and every European in Shiraz being present. No time for more. Report by Major Kettlewell on the movements of a survey party of the 39th Central India Horse marching from Khan-i-Zinian to Rashit-i-Arjan on 11th December. (The party consisted of Major Kettlewell, Captain Eckford, Jemadar Soraiyan Singh, 12 men including 1 surveyor of A squadron, 12 men of B squadron, 2 officers orderlies, 17 followers and 17 baggage mules.) I started from Khan-i-Zinian at 7 a.m. half an hour after a party of about 150 Persian Sarbazes (infantry), who were marching down the road. I told off the 12 men of A squadron to act as baggage guard and to remain with the mules, and used the men of B squadron as an advanced-guard and for scouting purposes. Moving from the Caravanserai down to the Kara Agach River I had scouts out on the low hills to the right of the road. These scouts had orders to rejoin the party at the bridge. This they did. Until near the river I was accompanied by the Persian Officer of Gendarmerie with 2 sowars from Khan-i-Zinian. These then galloped on ahead to visit their post at the tower- on the crest of the Sineh Safid Pass. Almost immediately after the Gendarmes had left me I sent Jemadar Soraiyan Singh and 2 sowars, with orders to trot on to Dasht-i-Arjan in order to arrive there before the Sarbazes, and secure accommodation for my men, about which I knew there would be some difficulty. I then crossed the river, sending 2 scouts on to a small isolated hill (about 300 feet high), about 700 yards south-west of the bridge. I then halted on the far bank for ten to fifteen minutes to close up my party before entering the strip of thorn and tamarisk jungle, through which the road passes for about Ij miles. I started on again at about 8 a.m. sending a scout to ride along the ridge (about 200 feet above the road), which rises some 400 yards beyond the isolated hill mentioned above. I sent forward 2 scouts to get up on to the next hill beyond this ridge and 2 scouts to ride ahead on the road. The two scouts who had been on the first hill then rejoined me, and my advanced party then consisted of Captain Eckford, myself, our 4 orderlies and 5 men of B squadron. At 8-20 a.m. this advanced party had got about 200 yards clear of the strip of jungle and the ^ 8 FEB 1913tom leading baggage mules were just appearing out of it when a hot fire was opened on us from the hiHs 300 yards to our left. The advanced party galloped to get under the shelter of a hill about 350 yards to the left front, and the four leading mules and four followers joined it here This hill is of convex section so that on reaching it we were under cover. All the hills near are thicklv covered with scrub jungle so that so far we had seen nothing of our attackers. On reaching the foot of this hill we dismounted and leaving two men with our horses began to climb the hill, which was frozen hard and very slippery. TV e had climbed about 40 yards un the hill and I personally could still see nothing of the enemy, but some of the men must have done so as they had fired a few shots in return to the fire which was falling all round us. At this moment Captain Eckford was in the act of taking aim with Ins revolver when he suddenly gave a lurch and fell. He was a yard away from me on my left. 1 went to him and he gasped out “ they have hit me ” and after that became quite unconscious. 1 le t tv o men with him and his servant who was down below came up to him. I then with three remaining men moved a little higher up and towards the east edge of the spur on which we then were. I could then (across a wooded ravine, which ran up into hills) see some of the enemy on the hill on the opposite side (this was the end of the ridge along which I had sent my scout), and as I reached the edge I saw from loO to 200 of the enemy rush out from the bottom of the ravine and cross about 30 yards of open ground and disappear into the jungle beyond. The first 50 or so of these men had rifles, the remaining appeared to be unarmed. I and the men with me fired at them, but I could not see whether any of them were hit. Up to this time I had no knowledge of what had happened to the men of A_ squadron and the rest of the baggage mules, but had seen several of the followers run off into the jungle directly the first shots were fired. From where I now was I could see some of the mules •emerging from the jungle into the open bed of the river. They were quickly surrounded by Persians and taken out of my sight. I could also see one or two of the men of A squadron, who had got on the low hills north of the river. Shots were still being fired at us from the top of the hills on our side. My object now was to try and collect the whole of my men a n d to remove Captain Eckford. I went back to him and found that he was quite uncon scious but he seemed to still be breathing. I had him carried down the hill and put on a horse in front of one of the men and then leaving three men to cover my retirement, with orders to rejoin me at a gallop as soon as I was about 400 yards clear, I proceeded with the mules and followers as fast as I could to the right (north) bank of the river. _ On the way I was joined by Jemadar Soraiyan Singh and the two men who had gone on with him. He reported to me that he had overtaken the Persian Sarbazes about half way up to the tower on the top of the Sineh-Safid Pass (some two miles ahead), he had then heard the firing. He asked the Persian officer of the Sarbazes to return, which he refused to do, and he himself then came back at a gallop along the bed of the river. As I approached the right bank of the river one of the men of A squadron galloped up to me ‘and reported that his party with some followers and mules was on a hill just ahead. I joined them and found that one syce and several mules were missing : sowar Pooran Singh (the scout I had sent on to the ridge when I left the river after haulting) was also reported to be missing, but was shortly afterwards reported to be present. Having collected my party I placed the followers, led horse and mule in charge of Jemadar Soraiyan Singh with orders to keep well under the left bank of the river and level with me, here they were absolutely under cover from the north and had a certain amount of conceal ment from view on the south afforded by a line of tamarisk bushes in the bed of the river. The country to the north consists of low rolling hills for several miles with a few bushes here and there on them, but the watercourses which run into the river are fairly thickly covered with scrub. I moved along these hills with my men in two sections, sending these sections forward alternately, and thus reached the road just beyond the bridge at 11-20 a.m. On the way, I saw about 15 to 20 mounted men on a ridge about 1,500 yards to the north and several men on foot in the ravines nearer to me with whom I exchanged shots and saw at least one of them hit. I also saw 50 or 60 men with rifles on the bridge, but could not ascertain who they were. They eventually disappeared. Desultory shots were being fired most of the time from the hills south of the river and I saw 3 horsemen moving along the hills from the direc tion of the Sineh-Safid Pass. These after a time I recognized to be Persian Gendarmes. On nearing the bridge I saw 30 or 40 men, some of them with rifles, on a small hill 400 yards in front of me and was preparing to fire on them when they disappeared. Shortly afterwards about 20 men appeared without arms and I went up to them. They were men from Khan-i-Zinian, and the telegraph ghulam was with them. Directly after my horses had crossed the bridge I was joined by the Persian officer of Gendarmerie. He told me that he had had 3 or 4 men wounded and asked me for help to bring them in, but took some of the villagers and riflemen from the village to do this. He then went off and I did not see him again till about 5 r.M. I now mounted my men and moved, with scouts out on the hills to the north, back to the caravanserai at Khan-i-Zinian. On reaching the serai I found that one of my horses had been shot through the chest, one man had been slightly wounded in the heel and one syce was still missing. The missing s yce turned up at 2 r.M. He said that he had run off into the jungle and remained hidden fNine mules with their loads had been carried off, and several followers had been stripped of their boots and some of their clothing. As I left the serai in the morning there was a small party of Persians (consisting of 3 women, 2- children, with one or two attendants, two pairs of Kajavvas on mules and 3 other baggage mules) getting ready to start. These must have followed close behind me or caught me up when I halted (though I did not see them), as they were robbed and their mules carried off by the tribesmen who attacked me. On reaching the river I saw a few of the Sarbazes who had started in front of me, resting on the far bank. They had disappeared before I got across. I saw no one else on the road either going out or coming back. The only other people in the serai the night before were a few charvardars with a small caravan going to Shiraz. On reaching the serai I connected my telephone to the telegraph line and tried to°get into communication with Shiraz, but without success, so I waited until 2 p.m. which I knew was the hour for testing the line, and I then succeeded in reporting what had occurred. During the afternoon 4 wounded Gendarmes were brought in the serai. As far as I could ascertain these had been shot on the hills on the right bank (south) of the river. They had been stripped of their arms and ammunition. When I was working back along the left bank of the river I saw the tracks of the party who had attacked me. They had then cleared away to the north. Dafedar Mahomed Zaman, the non-commissioned officer in charge of the baggage guard, states :— As soon as firing started, the syces having fled, I collected my men and tried to drive the mules into shelter, but I was almost immediately surrounded by about 100 tribesmen who came rushing down the hill and seized some of the mules. Fifteen to 20 horsemen al&amp;o came up from behind. I then with what mules I could get hold of, took my men across the river. As I was moving across about 30 to 40 horsemen came out from the opposite bank. I got my men on to a small hill on the other side of the river and opened fire on the enemy some of whom tried to make an attack on me, with the object of carrying off the mules I had with me, but they were driven back by my fire. They then went off up a ravine towards the north and were quickly followed by the others who had first seized the mules. I saw them carry off 4 men who had been hit. They carried off about 14 mules altogether, i.e., about 5 more than they had got from me. I saw no other mules anywhere in the neighbourhood. A short time after they had gone off I was joined by you.V No. 31^ dated Bushire, the 5th (received 13th) January 1913.

In continuation of my telegram No. 63, I have the honour to state that one of the Governor-General’s Secretaries came on the 29th to see me on this subject. Secretary read me a long telegram which the Governor-General had sent to the cabinet some days ago. In this he explained that (as far as I can gather) some 36,000 tomans are due to the troops here in respect of arrears of pay, and he appeals in strong terms to the cabinet to give him assistance in clearing off tliis obligation. He points out how impossible it is for him to inaugurate the new financial arrangements whilst these arrears remain unpaid, and are daily growing. He asks me to beg you to do what is possible to assist him in this matter. His proposal is that an assignment should be granted to him on the revenues of the province for the ensuing financial year for total of requirements from which he will be able to satisfy the men’s claims. Of course it is not desirable that any such charge should be imposed on next year’s revenues, but failing some such arrangement, I do not see how the men are to be paid, and neither the new army nor the new system of finance can be properly organized as long as these arrears remain unpaid, and some hundreds of discontented soldiers, with daily growing grievances, remain here to embarrass the administration. If you could see your way to ascertain the views of the Persian Govern ment and the Treasurer-General on the matter, or to devise some other means of settling the difficulty, I should be grateful. I understand there are other arrears due to the police, etc., but as the Governor-General has not referred to them, I suppose they are not so pressing.Telegram P., No. 73, dated and received the 30th December 1912.

Unfortunately, however, sum of £20,000 is estimated for the total expen diture for thiee months, and as the borrowed £15,000 is the only money at the disposal of the Ears administration, I have suggested to the Inspector that the necessary reduction in his estimate should he effected before we telegraph details to you and to the Treasurer-General. This he has promised to do, but it seems that he has already been engaged in a determined struggle with Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh over every single item, and is rather dismayed by the prospect of a renewed struggle. We talked it over, however, and I made a few suggestions as to how' some deductions might he effected without hurting the feelings of the Governor-General or interfering with the petty schemes of administration. Mukhbir’s intentions are of the best, but as regards financial administra tion he does not seem to possess the most elementary ideas. He will have to he handled very gently in the matter, and at any rate at first it wall not do to insist too rigidly on theoretical perfection of system. I have impressed this on the new Inspector, who promises to comply. When financial figures are to hand I will wire details. Telegram P., No. 313, dated and received 31st December 1912. From—Minister, Tehran, To—Resident, Bushire. (Repetition of telegram No. 184 to His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz.) With reference to your telegram No. 222, I have the honour to reply that I will do all I can to induce the Persian Government and the Treasurer- General to make some arrangement for the payment to the troops of the arrears due to them. I quite realise hov r important it is that before the new financial system comes into force this matter should he disposed of, and I quite understand that a highly disturbing element is added to a distracted situation by the presence of these unpaid men. There is, unfortunately, not a penny in the Treasury. No money can be raised by the Treasurer-General and unless a considerable advance is made by the two Governments, he has no hope of any coming in. Such an advance is conditional upon the granting of a Railway concession, a pill to swallow' which the Persian Government continues to show great reluctance. Telegram P., No. 314, dated and received 31st December 1912. From—Minister, Tehran, To—Resident, Bushire. (Repetition of telegram No. 181 to Shiraz.) Your telegram No. 223. I trust that it may he found practicable to cut down the budget estimates in such a way as to make the £15,000 last for three months, as I see hut little chance of further funds being available, and the Governor-General himself estimates the cost of administration at tomans 30,000 per mensem, and stated that towards this sum there w'ould be some revenue recoverable. If His Majesty’s Government sanction the expenditure of 20,000 tomans for the punitive expedition, the £15,000 will be still furtherreduced. If a considerable advance is to be made, more money could of course be earmarked. There is some talk of this, but owing to a prolonged cabinet crisis all is at a standstill. At Aauruz, there will, I suppose, be some revenue recoverable, and I understand that taxes had been collected by the Qawam. Treasurer-General will show me the text, so it will be sufficient if you will send me your appreciations of the Budget. Telegram P, No. 1, dated and received the 2-nd January 1913. From—Consul, Shiraz, To—Resident. (Repetition of telegram No. 3 to Tehran.) In reply to your telegram No. 185, I have the honour to state that the Governor-General hopes that he may be able to include in his budget estimates for the expenditure of the £15,000 the cost of the proposed punitive meaures without interfering seriously with other administrative measures of his. I have talked over the matter at length with the Governor-General and the Inspector, and hope shortly to have the former’s financial proposals. I shall address you again later regarding the Qawam when the varying reports have been thoroughly sifted by me. The Mukhbir-es-Saltaneh denies that he has received any money up to the present from him and is not himself aware whether or not any revenue was recovered during the recent tour by the Qawam. l _J Telegram P., No. 2, dated and received the 2nd January 1913. From —O'Connor, Shiraz, To—Resident. (Repetition of telegram No. 4 to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran.) My telegrams No. 210 and 216. Darya BegV s expedition. I had a long conversation yesterday with the Governor-General on this subject. His first aim is to arrange for the safe conduct of arms and ammuni tion up the road from Bushire. He is proceeding to Borasjun with this object, arranging as he goes for riflemen (?) and it is hoped by the Governor-General that these arrangements will safeguard the arms. ( 2 ) It is hoped by the Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh that he will be strong enough after the arrival of the arms to attack Muhammad Ali Khan Kashkuli with the aid of such gendarmes as are available here, and possibly, nith the assistance of Saulet-ed-Dowleh, whose attitude in this respect is unknown as yet, and support ed by two maxim guns now at Bushire. Siefvert who has hitherto not been consulted by the Governor-General, has grave doubts as to the immediate success of either of these undertakings. He proposes at present to let Major Noren Braudel stay at Bushire till the latter has collected his recruits and drilled them sufficiently to make them of some use after which it may be possible for the party to undertake the return journey without undue risk. It is to be regretted that the Governor-General does not care to consult Siefvert who is an excellent fellow, but who is quite unsuited to have personal dealings with Persian authorities. His opinion is of course valuable in matters of this kind. During the next few days I shall try to bring the two together and to make a more definite arrangement. As things now stand, progress cannot be made, and no good result can be produced by the Darya Begi’s expedition. Telegram P., No. 3—9, dated the 3rd Jar,uary 1913. From—Resident, Bushire, To—His Majesty’s Minister, repeated Shiraz. On arrival at Bushire the two Swedish officers made it clear to my First Assistant, and later to me on return, that they were fiankly and pronouncedly prejudiced against the Governor of the Gulf Ports. They expressed their firm conviction that it was to the machinations of the Qawam-ul-Mulk that they owed all their difficulties, and that Muwaqar-ud-Dowleh was incollusion with him to devise obstacles for them. I told Major Noren Brandel that I had not seen anything to justify such an assumption, and urged him strongly to talk over matters frankly with the Governor, who speaks English perfectly, and to take the latter as he found him, assuring Major Brandel that he would have my whole hearted co-operation in securing the good will and assistance of the Governor. Notwithstanding this though Major Brandel has been here over a fortnight he has not yet found an opportunity of making the Governor’s acquaintance. In the meanwhile strings in local politics are being pulled by two or three of the Darya Begi’s old cronies, who are in attendance on the Swedes, and the Swedes are being identified with them. I may mention that the Swedes ever since they arrived have been staying at the Eirst Assistant’s house and have received every sort of private hospita lity from us, but as regards their work, they seem to be suspicious and disin clined to accept friendly counsel, and now, with the Darya Begi arriving at Borasjun, I foresee a difficult situation, as his adherents will become much more active. I will continue in my endeavours to promote a modus vivendi between the Swedish Officers and the Muwaqar-ud-Dowleh and for the present do not desire that any special action should be taken but it seems desirable that Your Excellency should be aware of the trend of events.

He is therefore obliged to remain there until he can get together some 200 suitable men, and lick them into shape, after which it may he in a position to try to escort his caravan of arms and ammunition to Shiraz. So far as I can gather from Major Siefvert Major Brandel is plunging into local politics at Bushire. I have tried to show Major Siefvert, the folly and uselessness of so doing, and have suggested to him that he should impress on Brandel the expediency of consulting Sir P. Cox and of asking for his assistance in all problems which may arise so long as he is there. Telegram P., No. 5—13, dated the 4th January 1913. Prom—Resident, Bushire, To—Minister, Tehran, repeated Shiraz. My telegram No. 3 and Major O’Connor’s telegram 5 to you crossed. Major Brandel came to-day to see me and I induced him to call on the Governor along with me. We had a full and frank exchange of views and I hope that the outcome may be beneficial. Statement made by Major Brandel that no men had been enlisted for him by the Governor-General is not true. He had the men ready for Major Brandel as desired, but had been instructed that until the Swedish officer arrived to make the selection, enlistments were not to be effected.

It is now reported by the Khan of Hayet Daud that the Amir Mujahid incensed at the opposition offered to his ambitions by the Customs, the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and the British Legation, has sent for the Sardar-i-Jang to come to his assistance in asserting himself over the districts in question. The above circumstances all tend to corroborate the apprehension expressed in my telegram No. 301, December 26th, that the proclaimed intention of the Bakhtiaris to punish the Buwair Ahmadis would be used by the former as a means for collecting a force under the name of Government which would be employed merely for other blackmailing schemes such as those to which refer ence is made above.

(February 4, 9 p.m.) BRITISH consul at Shiraz telegraphs that the Kavam has expressed to him that, as the Governor-General appears to experience some difficulty in enrolling recruits for his personal force, he (the Kavam) should be entrusted with the duty of raising the force to punish at least the Baharlus, as unless an example is made of this tribe or the Kashkulis, there will be very serious trouble in the spring. Kavam naturally added that he would require about 30,000 tomans and 100,000 cartridges to carry out the punitive measures. . British consul returned an evasive answer, and subsequently discussed the matter with the Governor-General. It would, in my opinion, be the height of folly to entrust the Kavam with money, and to allow him to collect a force such as he suggests would make it patent to all that he is a stronger factor than the Governor-General. Such is probably the case as it is, but it would inevitably lead to grave disorders if the fact were emphasised. British consul adds that the Kavam is clearly intriguing, and that he and the Governor- General are agreed, though the latter hesitates to declare himself clearly, that it is desirable that the Kavam should leave Fars. . &gt; • t i T * •* ^ ^ ^ H 4-^ /-a-*-*/-'I/- vo'rr/'\n r» t find a governorship that he should go a that he snouia go auroau. iui ^ ^ r- . . the British consul’s advice, but care would have to he taken not to convey the Minister for Foreign Affairs shares this opinion, and has promised to endeavour to a o-overnorship for him.

Secretary Sir Edward Grey .—His Majesty’s Government are not able to say what measures may ultimately be necessary in consequence of the murder of Captain Eckford. They would, however, be reluctant to take any action which might hamper the efforts of the new Persian Cabinet in the restoration of order, and they are considering in what manner they can best afford them assistance and encouragement in their task.

In addition, under your pressure, Russian Government have instructed their representative here to assure the new Cabinet of Russian good-will and support, provided that they show themselves conciliatory towards Russian aspirations, and he has further authorised encouragement of a belief that a loan will be floated. I am convinced that the present Cabinet has no wish to accept advance even for a large sum unless there is real hope that such temporary assistance will be followed at an early date by a loan of such dimensions as will give Persia a chance of recovering herself. Neither Cabinet nor treasurer-general will accept a Russian advance on the same terms as the last one unless they have good ground to believe that loan will follow shortly. As to financing the gendarmerie in Fars or the provincial administrations, I am convinced that money as expended would be wasted unless a strong Central Govern- meut is established which can back up such organisations and make itself felt and respected in provinces. Without much more stable funds than are offered by advances it will be quite impossible to create such a Government. There are already signs of impatience on the part of certain members of the new Cabinet because funds upon which they counted on taking office are not yet forthcoming. As I have reported before, these men accepted office from patriotic motives, and they are not prepared to endeavour to carry through the hopeless task of administration with an empty exchequer.

(January 30, 9 p.m.) SOUTHERNS PERSIA. Following from the consul at Bushire, addressed to the Government of India :— “ Please refer to Minister’s telegram No. 31 of 26th January to Foreign Office, repeated under my No. 168 of 27th January. “ The deduction he makes regarding my views and anticipations is correct np to a certain point, but I beg to offer following observations in explanation or amplification :— “ As I understand it, the present position is this: of the two courses, consisting respectively in action by ourselves ou the Bushire-Shiraz road and the grant of a further respite to the Persian Government after the spring, in the forlorn hope of their being able to achieve within a reasonable period of time sufficient !} 7 effective measures to afford ns reparation for outrages and satisfy requirements of our commerce, His Majesty’s Government incline to the view that the latter alternative is the less far-reaching evil, and propose to adopt it. “ From the Minister’s recent telegrams its adoption appears for the present to mean that we shall assist in financing both gendarmerie and tlie administration of bars simultaneously. For the former purpose we are asked to provide 350,000^. for three years’ maintenance, and Minister recommends that 100,0001. be now provided to finance them for the next ten months. For the Governor the consul-general at Shiraz estimates that the actual sum which will be needed now in order to enable him to collect more revenue and maintain security is from 40,0001. to 50,0001. for the next three or four months, whilst Minister thinks 30,0001. should suffice. “ It is not, however, clear that either of these sums includes specific provision for the cost of punitive expeditions against tribes concerned in the attacks on Smart and Eckford, yet gendarmerie officers here express decided conviction that it is a sine qua non for the success of their scheme, and in this view I concur. “ In any case, when the above contribution comes to an end the machineiy will stop, for the consul at Shiraz’s recent telegrams appear to indicate that the revenue provided, even if fully recovered, will not meet the cost of the gendarmerie as well as the cost of civil administration. It is, moreover, still problematical whether the present Governor-General will be able to rise to the situation at all either from a financial point of view or any other. The last Governor-General w 7 as capable, but dishonest ; the present one seems to be honest, but very capable [sic]. “ Above is the prospect which I regard with little or no confidence. “ On the other hand, if His Majesty’s Government are prepared to undertake on a definite basis and for a prolonged period, say, ten years, the onus of financing t e province and the gendarmerie, and in the meanwdiile to promote railway en erpnse actively in the same sphere, I am not prepared to say that intervention ^ nj 8 ' e staved off for a considerable time, so far as this province is concerne . u ey G 1 i then I fear that any Governor-General whom the Persian Government can supp y wi be liable to let us in badly at any moment, so that money advanced wifi be a precarious investment, and I believe that when w r e cease nance anc con ro over the administration it would quickly relapse into chaos owing o ic ac peasantry are now well armed and know their power, and t a |T s ! a f c ^ nT1 „ C!+ „ produce, and will be unable to produce in this generation, men o su cien purpose and capability to take up the reins efficiently when we ay lem °wn. “ 1 may mention here that it is a matter of conviction with the mercantile class and the headmen of the hinterland wit i w om we I hi—654] Qpny -- A 7 FEB 1913 GRETARY‘8 N2 62 here that Persia, Baluchistan, and Luristan have passed permanently out of the hands of the Central Government, and that in bars also the disease has advanced past the point of recovery, and that the Persian Government is never likely to regain effective control^ ^ a kove attitude of mind that I expressed the view that our com mercial interests and position could be sufficiently vindicated by our assuming control over Bushire-Shiraz road, and that we could then leave the administration of province and the general restoration of order to its fate, hoping, once divested of responsibility for the road, the Governor-General might find his hands strengthened for other problems. By financing the administration indefinite!} as well as gendarmerie, without full control over either, the British exchecpiei seem to be assuming a more risky liability than would be involved in the holding of the road and on promising less advantage to our commerce. . , “If, however, owing to its probable effect on Russia s attitude His Majestys Government finally decide against taking any military action themselves, I venture most respectfully, but earnestly, to urge that a searching diagnosis should be made of financial position and outlook, and of complete decrepitude of the administrative machinery of the country in spite of factitious journalistic statements to the contrary; and that, having made it, we should take upon ourselves deliberately and constructively, at whatever cost and for whatever period may be necessary, such measures of finance as the diagnosis may show to be essential for the cure of the patient, if that is possible, and for the preservation of our larger and ultimate interests. “I venture, further, to urge that, as soon as our final decision has been arrived at, or at any rate as the spring approaches, the policy on which we have deliberately decided should be stated in Parliament, or published in the press, and that we should then form our local dispositions accordingly, whatever temporary loss of credit it may involve. “ (Addressed to Foreign [?] Department, India; repeated to Minister.)” Cox states that the gendarmerie officers at Bushire are of opinion that a punitive expedition against the tribes is a sine qua non of the success of the gendarmerie scheme for Fars. I do not think colonel commanding shares this view. He attaches some importance to the co-operation of such local forces as the Governor-General may be able to collect, but neither he nor I anticipate that a force capable of undertaking a punitive expedition alone against the powerful tribes concerned can be formed. All that is hoped is that the gendarmerie may be able gradually to reduce the province to order, and exact punishment of men of tribes who may be proved guilty. My latest advices are to the effect that the decision not to endeavour to bring up the gendarmerie arms and ammunition from Shiraz for the present has seriously affected the Governor-General’s plans, has caused the Dariabegi to abandon contem plated expedition against Mohammed Ali Khan Kashkuli, reported in my telegram No. 648 , and has obliged him to return to Shiraz without effecting anything. The British consul at Shiraz reports that this has greatly damaged the prestige of the Governor-General, and that Kawam has commenced to intrigne against him with a view to prevent recruits offering themselves or arrears of taxes to be collected. I do not share the views expressed that, when the three years have elapsed within which it is hoped that the gendarmerie will have restored order, the revenues of the province will not suffice to meet the expenses of administration and of the gendarmerie. Possibility of re-establishing order is perhaps very doubtful, but the richest province in Persia should be self-supporting if this can be achieved.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.! r PERSIA. i • J 1 [January 13.J CONFIDENTIAL.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 265 of yesterdays date I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a further telegram, as marked in the margin, which I have i eceived from his Majesty s consul at Shiraz, putting forward further reasons why he considers it desirable that the force which the Governor-General proposes to create should be under British officers. Major O’Connor points out that it would now seem almost certain that his Majesty’s Government will find themselves constrained to send a military expedition into Southern Persia in the course of the next few months, adding that it will be too late to do this spring if a delay of four months, as 1 have suggested, be accorded to Mukhber-es- Sultaneh. This would mean that an expedition could not be sent until the autumn and would only be dispatched in the event of a troublous state of affairs continuing and not as a punitive expedition resulting from the many outrages, culminating in the murder of Captain Eckford that have occurred during the past twelve months. This argument would seem to anticipate that the Governor-General will be unable to restore order, and in my humble opinion ignores somewhat too much the nature of the affronts suffered by the British uniform. I would personally welcome any scheme that would obviate the despatch of a British expeditionary force, provided that satisfactory measures are taken to protect British honour and that it had a fair chance of success. I must own that I am some what more optimistic in this respect than Major O’Connor, granted that time, and more especially money, be given for the purpose. It is more than probable that British officers would be more successful than Swedes, but I am still of opinion that endless friction would ensue were two military forces to be created in Ears under officers of the two nationalities. I do not think that the analogy of the north is acceptable. The Cossack brigade was in existence long before the gendarmerie under Swedish officers was created and their functions do not in any way clash, whereas in the south the two forces would be called upon to perform practically similar duties and the one would certainly suffer in the material recruitable to the advantage of the other. I am further of opinion that the Governor-General, when once the question was put to him, would be in his heart averse to any foreigners. In spite of his having enjoyed an European education he is a Persion of the old school and a well-known advocate of the theory that foreign advisers are undesirable because they do not understand the Persians.

It seems to me that His Majesty’s Government are now definitely confronted with ffie practical certainty of having to send a large expedition into Southern Pei sia during ;he course of the next few months. Delay of four months, to give Governoi-General ffiance of doing something, will make it too late for operations to take place in the spring ; so, in the event which we all anticipate, that the Persian Goveinment an dovernor-General will prove unequal to the task of restoring order m Southern Persia, ve shall be forced into dispatch of expedition next autumn.

But the only way they can escape from it is, I think, by adopting some definite con structive line of policy in Ears which, whilst maintaining the present form of Government, will so support and reinforce it as to enable, or, indeed, to compel it, to assume some of the efficiency which it at present lacks. Our present policy here is, I venture to think, too indefinite to be capable of producing such effects. It was m view of such general considerations as this that I have ventured, in my recent telegram, to indicate what I regarded as the minimum of the measures which might be taken to secure stable government for Ears. The proposal, as you know, was [word here omitted in telegram] enough, and was confined to the suggestion of employing a few Englishmen in administration, and I may add that I also had in mind possibility of further loan later on. As you are aware question of employing British military officers in Southern Persia is not a new one. It has been definitely proposed on one occasion by His Majesty’s Government, and was discussed at Balmoral. I realise that difficulties might arise by employing British and Swedish officers side by side, but if the respective duties of the gendarmerie and military were carefully differentiated and defined, I scarcely think these difficulties would prove insuperable. And may I remind you that two forces officered respectively by Bussian and Swedish officers exist in Northern Persia and appear to work without undue friction. Nor could the organisation of* a military force by British officers be regarded as any reflection whatever upon the Swedes. Their gendarmerie might remain here, and might continue to carry out the duties of gendarmerie such as policing roads, &amp;c. ; whilst the military force would have its head-quarters at Shiraz and would be available for more purely military measures such as coercion and punishment of troublesome tribes or of such armed bands as might be too strong for the gendarmerie to tackle. My reasons for thinking Swedish officers are not altogether suitable for the task are, firstly, that their experience in dealing with eastern peoples is too limited to enable them in a short time to accommodate themselves to the peculiar conditions prevailing in Persia. Ihis we have all seen already. And, secondly, I may mention that the Governor-General has already spoken to me with some bitterness of his dislike of their methods ; their high-handedness, their lack of tact and elasticity, &amp;c. And in my opinion he is justified in these strictures. Whereas, I think it will be generally admitted that the Indian army could supply not one but many officers of precisely the light type for such a task, and with the additional qualifications of knowledge of the Persian language and practical experience of hill warfare. But granted the many difficulties and anomalies in the situation, question i evolves itself into a choice of evils ; is it better to continue our present indefinite poicy. m Southern Persia which in the opinion of yourself and other competent judges must inevitably end m dispatching an expedition ; or to make at any rate an attempt at a more constructive policy which may eventually place administration of Ears on a stable basis, whether by methods which I have suggested or by any others which may occur to you or to your other advisers.

Begins. Concerning situation in Southern Persia I beo- to raform Your Excellency that Vice-Consul at Ahwaz recently handed me a memorandum m connection with proposed Bakhtiari expeditions into Ears against the Boir Ahmadi Kuhgilus or other tribesmen on 4om resnonsibmtv rests for attack on Eckford’s party. These expeditions, hrtheTri first heard of as a proposition on the part of His Majesty’s Government They have since been more definitely referred to by Reuter from Tehran. In above LZ&gt;- y’ u , n discussing mam question of restoration of security through Eckford incident on the Hpahan-Ahwaz roads the Vice-Consul expressed the § view that ardar Jang is neither disposed to undertake those military operations for the subjection of Kuhgilus_which were an essential factor of his mission nor capable omg so. In his opinion neither Amir Mujavena nor any other Eakhtiari Khan is likely to succeed where Sardar has failed. So far as we know as I would likewise remind Your Excellency, the Sardar has taken no steps yeteven pumsn m an exemplary manner the insignificant section of the Kuhmlus who are responsible for the attack on Lieutenant Bullock. This attack &amp; was announced in your telegram to Eoreign Office No. 576 of 1st Noyember, and might easily haye had same result as in case of Captain Eckford. Lieutenant u lock s orderly, as you are doubtless aware, has since died of the injuries he received. 1 have, it is true, no grounds whatever for assumption that Beuter’s announcements from Tehran to which I have referred were previously approved or subsequently endorsed by His Majesty’s Legation, yet in view of the wide spread impression of such announcements both here at Mohammerah and else- where, I would respectfully urge advisability of giving definite discouragement to idea or the Bakhtiari entering on ill-organised and untimely excursions into ± ars or elsewhere, much less until they have proved their ability and intention to set in order their own house. Even if complete loria'jides on part of 'fians is assumed I am sceptical of their ability to achieve object in view at all effectively. I am also doubtful whether in existing circumstances apprehension can safely be rejected that such excursions might merely be used for providing misleading journalistic copy and for extension of rapacious Bakhtiari tentacles un J ^ ra :, ^ an anc F 3?ars. I would in conclusion observe that the British goods robbed on the Ispahan-Ahwaz road during the past two years exceed in value those lost in the same period on all other southern roads collectively. Since the above was cyphered I have received copy of your telegram No. 178 of Decem ber 22 nd to Shiraz, but it still leaves me uncertain whether above mentioned Bakhtiari expeditions may not be seriously contemplated. Lor this reason I am letting my views go on. I would in conclusion observe that I cannot admit that the state of province generally has been in any way ameliorated though condition of Shiraz and its immediate vicinity may have improved since Mukhbir’s arrival. I am unaware on what grounds such amelioration has been assumed to exist. End of telegram. s'&lt;y'Telegram R v No. 1488, dated the 26th (received 27th) December 1912. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. Poliowing sent by Minister to Shiraz 178, December 22 nd. Begins “ I have had your telegrams 204, 205, and 206 under most careful consideration I have forwarded first two on to Foreign Office by post submitting such portions of them as it seemed essential to bring to early notice of Government by telegraph as you will have seen by telegrams repeated to you. I am not yet in possession of Sir E. Grey’s views. I concur up to certain point in your opinion Unfortu nately incident resulting in Captain Eckford’s death does not alter fact that since the Governor-General’s arrival there has been marked improvement in state of Province. ^ Principally I cannot but consider it, taken in conjunction with many petty incidents of the last year, I suppose very serious link in chain of evidence that goes to show that Persian Government are unable to protect life and property of foreigners and that unless some real step in this direction is taken by them immediately it will be extremely difficult for His Majesty s Government to refrain from coming in and doing the necessary estab lishment of ordei, despite expense that such measures would entail and possible consequences that might ensue. It appears to me that our good name and fame must suffer irretrievably if we consent to sit down and allow such incidents to be repeated at our expense. I am fully alive to excellent qualities of Governor- General and to his evident determination to re-establish order and for his sake I am more than sorry to have to advocate forward policy to be undertaken before he has time, I am afraid, to mature his schemes and put his machinery into motion. In accordance with your views I am advocating a delay of four months to give him a chance but in doing so I am more than sceptical as to his being able to do anything decisive in time. It seems to me however that to accord longer delay would mean risk of incurring the contempt of the tribesmen. Without a considerable sum of money Governor- General cannot do much and where is he to get more? I do not think our Government will be disposed to go beyond the £15,000 and such a small sum will not suffice in my opinion for the purpose in hand and for other necessary expenditure. I quite understand and fully approve Governor- } General’s idea of forming a force of some 1,000 picked men and no doubt it would be ideal if such a force could be put under some British Officer having the gift of inspiring Persians with confidence. Here again there is a hateful “but” I cannot think that it would be possible to have two military forces in one place commanded by foreign officers of different nationalities. Situation thus created would, I think, lead to endless jealousy and. trouble. Governor- General would, naturally seek to enrol best men and Swedes would cry out that he was favouring the corps under British officers at their expense. It would hardly be fair on Swedes to declare them a failure at Shiraz. Such a declara tion would affect their position vitally throughout Persia and if they are to remain at Shiraz idea of British officers for a separate corps must I think be abandoned until their failure has been proved. I would prefer scheme which would mean a force of from three to four thousand men under Swedish officers to do general as well as gendarmerie work. Such a force would require large sum of money for its maintenance but should suffice to entirely restore order. Were His Majesty’s Government to put up two to three hundred thousand pounds as a debt on Persian Government to maintain such a force effectively for three years it would cost much less than an expedition. I am quite aware that presence of Anglo-Indian troops at Shiraz may be held responsible in a way for situation but they are there whether or not it was mistake to send them there and it is our duty I think to see that they are treated with courtesy and honour. They at least cannot be held responsible for repeated outrages on caravans and for persistent blackmailing that prevails. As to the financial agent I doubt very much if the Governor-General would be more ready in his heart to accept assistance and advice of an Englishman rather than that of a Belgian. When Lecroffre was appointed he said that he would not go toShiraz unless his appointment was cancelled. He is Persian of the old school who can with difficulty brook interference in what he considers to be the Gover nor’s functions. He is intelligent and pleasant man but he is not good man of business nor is he easy man to deal with when he considers his own prerogative at stake. Being honest man himself he knows that he would administer finances of nrovince as well as he could but he has dishonest men round him. Two (?)

Pact that we have advanced £15,000 to Persian Government for expenses of adminis tration of province would not justify us in asking for a separate financial con trol which would have far-reaching results. To succeed in his task M. Mornard must have his own men whom he knows and trusts and who are trained in his methods. I much hope that gendarmerie find Stas better than you expect.

As regards the general situation with which we are confronted, or may expect to be confronted in the spring, and the best means of dealing therewith, definite views have been severally expressed by His Majesty’s Minister, Major O’Connor and myself, and are doubtless engaging the deliberate consideration of higher authority. Some indication of the direction which the policy of His Majesty’s Govern ment is to take, may be expected in due course ; meanwhile I do not think I can usefully offer any detailed comment on the correspondence.

From—His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To—The Political Resident, Bushire, (Addressed Minister, No. 204). Question of Retribution. I bave tbe honour to address you with regard to the retribution to be exacted for the attack on Major Kettlewell and his party, vide yom te egram No. 172. As will be seen from my telegram 202, it does not appear that this attack was aimed deliberately at our officers and sowars, but seems to have been made with the object of plunder by an ordinary marauding band.The general political situation in South Persia seems to me, therefore, in no way altered by this last attack and no change of policy on the part of His Majes ty’s Government is necessarily called for. If the exaction by themselves of retribution was not considered necessary by His Majesty’s Government in the case of the deliberate and sustained attack on one of their Consuls and his escort, which resulted in some loss of life, nor for any of the subsequent attacks made on their officers, then no feature of special atrocity is presented by this last attack which would necessitate a change of policy now. Of course the death of Captain Eckford gives this last outrage a special significance which, fortunately, does not attach to previous incidents, but it was merely a fortunate chance which might just as well have occurred in the case of other officers who have been assaulted at various times. I consider there fore that there is no reason why this last assault should necessitate His Majes ty’s Government sending an expedition into the country to restore order, unless it is now considered desirable in view of repeated outrages and of the generally disturbed condition of Southern Persia. The policy of His Majesty’s Government, as I understand it, is to maintain the existing form of Government, as long as possible, and it is with this object in view that you have secured the appointment as Governor-General of Pars of the best Persian official obtainable, who is being financed, and otherwise sup ported in the difficult task of trying to restore order in his province, by His Majesty’s Government. The experiment is in the nature of a forlorn hope, but if His Majesty’s Government desire to persevere in their policy I am aware of no special reason why they should now depart therefrom. The question having been raised, however, I venture with great respect to invite your attention to the broad facts of the case, as they present themselves to me. It is notorious that the whole of this part of Persia is virtually closed and for some time has been a state of anarchy, which tends to increase rather than diminish as time goes on. His Majesty’s Government are actually financing the Government of Ears with a view to restoring order and protecting their interests, and are retaining a more or less effective control of the money which has been lent in this connection. This being so, it seems clear that His Majesty’s Government have undertaken very definite responsibilities in Southern Persia, and that, should they desire to make their present policy successful, to restore order under a Persian Governor, and eventually withdraw their cavalry regiment, without being obliged to send a large expedition into the country, they must be prepared to face the necessity of adopting a more definite and more decided line of policy than they are now pursuing. I refer to the military force, which the Governor-General proposes to raise, as I have already reported. As indicated in my telegram No. 198, I regard the method proposed in your telegram No. 171 for the control of the £15,000 lent for use in Ears to the Persian Government as unlikely to prove effective. The Consul can only retain a nominal control of the expenditure once the money has actually passed into the hands of the Ears administration. We have no security that funds will not be maladministered, whatever budgets or projects the Governor-General may produce. The Einance Agent is the only person who can really control expenditure, and what I hear of the character and past record of Monsieur Stas, he does not inspire me with much confidence. The Mukhbir’s dislike and dis trust of all Belgians has already been reported to you. Secondly.—Possibility of Governor-General being able to raise adequate military force. I consider the -whole problem depends on this, for without force the Gover nor-General is helpless. Given the money, I believe a force, and a good force, ■could be raised, but that this could be done by Persians alone I do not believe. The Governor-General himself has doubts on this point, I think, for in reply to my question as to the qualifications of his Persian officers he hinted that he might find it necessary to ask for the services of one of the Swedish or British officers here to supervise the new organization.My opinion, tlieiefore, is as follows :— We must utilise the services of at least tw r o Englishmen in order to prevent £15,000 from being v r asted, and in order to organise a suitable native force to restore order in Ears. One should act as Treasury Agent, and the other as inspecting officer of local forces. I regard it as essential that sufficient Englishmen should be employed, for, in the peculiar circumstances of the case, I do not think that the task could suitably be undertaken by the subjects of any other Pow r er. I believe that the employment of Englishmen as suggested might conceivably enable the Gover nor-General to restore order in his province. If this last expedient fails, it will then be time to consider what other measures are necessitated by the exigencies of the situation. Telegram P., No. -296, dated (and received) the 10th December 1912. From—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Political Eesident, Bushire. Following telegram has been sent to Foreign Office No. 639, and repeated to Shiraz No 173 for favour of information regarding points therein quoted from the report of the Governor-General:— Begins. My immediately preceding telegrams have given all details received from British sources at Shiraz. I have also received from the Persian Govern ment the report of the attack on Major Kettlewell’s party which was furnished to them by the Governor-General. In all essential particulars it agrees with the British reports, but makes it clear that there was a caravan present, of the existence of which Major Jxettle- well was unaware. It would appear clear from the Governor-General’s account that a force of about 100 Persian soldiers, 30 gendarmes, 10 artillery men with one Swedish and several Persian officers, wns allowed to who attacked the British party in the belief that they caravan, to plunder which they had come out. It is added by the Governor-General that there is pass by the robbers, were escorting the no doubt that the robbers were Buwair Ahmadi, and that 12 were killed, whilst all but three of the mules laden with goods were recovered. He also states that the fight lasted for four or five hours, until fatigue and failing light obliged the gendarmes to desist from fighting. Information on these points, and as to the number of gendarmes and the nature of the cavalry engagement is being asked for by telegraph from Major O’Connor. It is now' clear that the only person killed was Captain Eckford, thou-h it is reported that one rifleman and four gendarmes were wounded. A force is being despatched by the Governor-General, but operations of anv kind will be rendered difficult by snow on the passes ; urgent orders have also been sent to the Bakhtiari Governor of Behbehan and to Sardar-i-Jang to collect a large force of Bakhtiaris, for the severe punishment of the Buwair Ahmadi who will in this way be taken between two fires. There is I fear not much satisfaction to be hoped for from these measures. Ends. Telegram P., No. 55, dated (and received) the 17th December 1912. From—His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, _ To— The Political Resident, Bushire (Addresed Minister, No. 205). Please refer to my telegram No. 204-54 and other correspondence regard- •ing the Eckford incident. I have lust seen the Governor-General. He tells me that pressure .s l nave just rr p i iraT1 to take immediate steps of some being brought to bear on him from lehran to taK^ ^ take3 kind “ m order to allay exeitom ^ deplores the tragic death of Captain EcS aTdAletnsfa l nf robberies on the Bushire-Shiraz road, but points out4 that the general state of law and order in the province is distinctly better than before he took over charge, and that the general political situation as it existed, say, a fortnight ago, is in no way altered by occasional instances of robbery. Of course, he says, it is easy to get together the usual rabble Persian army and send it off into the hills, but, as he very reasonably points out, the result is a foregone conclusion. Such ill-considered and unorganised efforts cannot possibly be attended with success, and if they fail the situation will be worse than it already is, and will render a foreign occupation necessary. Unless therefore he is forced by the insistence of his own Government into unwilling action, he proposes to continue methodical preparation for organisation of a small but competent force on the lines indicated in my previous telegrams ; that is to say, enlist about 1,000 men, all carefully picked, whom he hopes to have armed and ready within two months for active operations. The above is his general scheme, and I venture with the greatest possible respect to urge that before His Majesty’s Government decide to adopt more strenuous measures, it may at least be given a trial. I may be unacquainted with the various arguments in favour of despatching an expedition to Southern Persia, which may be brought forward but at the same time I venture with great respect to counsel still a little more patience, and that Governor-General should be given the chance of executing the task which we ourselves have set him, and in which he has hitherto been supported and liberally assisted by His Majesty’s Government. I have already urged that the Eckford incident cannot in any way be regarded as altering the fundamental situation as it previously existed, and I trust I may be pardoned if I remind Your Excellency that this series of out rages, commencing with the attack last December on Mr. Acting Consul Smart, and culminating in the death of Captain Eckford, can be directly ascribed to the presence in Southern Persia of an Indian Cavalry Regiment. This is a very important consideration, and should I think be borne in mind when reviewing the general situation. Eurther consideration will, I am confident, lead to the conclusion that there is no immediate necessity for the incalculable consequences and heavy expense which must be involved by such a step. Beyond all question, more over, it would be a grave error were the Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh to be forced at this juncture into taking some premature action of which his own judgment disapproved, and which would almost certainly have disastrous consequences. With regard to the details of the Governor-General’s scheme, I propose should this aspect of the matter have any further interest at all for you, to tele- giaph fmther details All I would add at present is that I think his general project is sound and feasible, but that in my opinion it will require the assist ance of one or more British officers to make it a success. Telegram No. 56, dated (and received) the 17th December 1912. Prom—His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To—The Political Resident, Bushire. (Addressed Tehran, No. 206.) Governor-General’s report is inaccurate in several particulars. As report ed m my telegram 201 only three mounted gendarmes preceded Major Kettle- well s party. There was no Swedish officer and no artillery. Question of rden i y of robbers still uncertain. Other sources of information do not hear out Governor-General s contention that they were Boir Ahmadis, see my pre vious te egram on subject. Number of their killed unknown but reports vary from 1 to 12 the fact being that no one knows for certain. None of the stolen mules were recovered but some loads dropped by robbers were picked up. Regarding part taken by gendarmes in fight I have now received the following paiticulars from Captain Lunberg who has himself been out to scene of action flddiHm? G con ^ riris -^ a 3 0r Kettle well’s report but says that in addition to the three gendarmes who went on ahead in morning and those who a tenvaids came out of Burj on the Sineh Safid there were some others who onTilloek^u 7 r °+b P if tr ?3 fl ?^ IOlaneh Zillia n. These latter took up position on hillock on north bank of river, whence they fired at robbers and four offormer were wounded. Some of them apparently followed robbers for some distance and returned in evening but there was nothing in nature of cavalry engagements Major Siefvert estimates number of gendarmes engaged at about 20 altogether. I may add that gendarmes appear to have behaved very well and to have done all they possibly could to assist Major Kettlewell’s party to drive off robbers. Addressed Tehran,, No. 206; repeated Bushire No. 56. Note. —Intimation was received from Shiraz that this was in. reply to His Majesty’s Minister’s No. 173. Telegram P., No. 58, dated (and received) the 18tli December 1912. From—His Majesty ; s Consul, Shiraz, To—The Political Resident, Bushire. (Addressed Minister, No. 208.) With reference to my telegram No. 54, I beg to explain that in again suggesting that an Englishman be substituted for a Belgian as financial agent in Eai?, I do not wish to press particularly for M^r. Haycock’s nomination. The force of the arguments contained in your telegram of the 22nd Novem ber* are fully appreciated by me and I do * Not received. n ot suppose that he is an ideal person. I suggested that he be employed simply because he was readily available, and possessed certain useful qualifications, but I do not doubt that the Govern ment of India, for instance, could provide a far superior type of man. I venture to think that, having regard to British interests involved in Southern Persia, not merely owing to fact that we are actually financing the administration of the province, and have to safeguard our considerable commer cial interests, but because we may be compelled to adopt military measures and possibly proceed to an occupation of the country, neither the Persian Govern ment nor the Treasurer-General could very well object to the reasonable pre caution of appointing an Englishman as finance agent in Ears. I am led to think by further conversation with the Governor-General and with the staff of the finance office here that the Governor-General will certainly resent any attempt to exercise control if made by a Belgian or a Persian. Such friction would be most regrettable, and might lead to the failure of his plans, whereas in my opinion he would accept the advice and guidance of an Englishman much more readily, whilst the latter would of course co-operate closely with His Majesty’s Consul. , I trust that I may be excused for reverting to this question, which seems to be of importance. , . , £ .

He tells me that he has prepared a budget for £15,000, and promises to let me see it shortly, but until the new finance agent arrives, I do not suppose that any serious progress can be made in any financial question. Telegram P., No. 60, dated (and received) the 18th December 1912. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To—The Political Resident, Bushire. (Addressed Minister, No. 211.) Identity of robbers. Reference is invited to my telegrams Nos. 172 and 206. Information on this point has reached me from a number of different sources during the last few days. All reports agree that a number of Mamasani tribesmen were included in the band and a list of the principal persons said to have been involved is in my possession. It is also possible, as is averred by the Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh, that Buwair Ahmadis took part, but there is no doubt that they were well supported by Mamasani and some Kashgai tribesmen. I had a talk with the Governor-General on the subject last night. He concurs that it is quite possible and even probable that the band contained members of Mamasani and other tribes in addition to Buwair Ahmadis. He is anxious in any case to chastise Muhammad Ali Khan, and the first item in his programme is the surrender of the persons implicated in the attack on Smart. Inis done, it will be easy to deal with other offenders. Reliable information has reached me that two robbers were killed and three wounded.

Telegram P., No. 63, dated (and received) the 20th December 1912. ^ Lj From—His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, y To—-The Political Eesident, Bushire. (Addressed Minister, No. 215.) I beg to invite a reference to my telegram No. 59, with regard to the financial question. I was visited last night by Mirza Mustafa Khan, Inspector of Finance in this Province. He brought me a telegram from Monsieur Mornard in which he was directed to examine the budget scheme, for the expenditure during the next three months of borrowed money, drawn up by Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh, and show it to me before telegraphing it to the Treasurer-General. It was also stated in the telegram that a sum of 20,000 Tomans would be remitted. Of this latter sum the Inspector knows nothing, but supposes that it must be destined to meet extraordinary expenses in connection with the measures to be taken by the Governor-General to inflict punishment on the perpetrators of the recent outrage. I was also shown a summary which the Governor-General had drawn up. It merely consisted of a list of lump sums under a number of headings, totalling 99,000 Tomans in all. The Inspector was unaware how the total was reached and whether any attempt had been made by His Excellency to work out the details of the scheme. He proposes, therefore, during the next few days to prepare a detailed budget. He informed me that troops here have considerable arrears due to them, as also the police, and enquired whether the inclusion of these in the new budget would be legitimate. I replied that I did not think it would be, as the loan of £15,000 was intended primarily to enable the Governor-General during the next three months or so to organise the province that the administration would be started in the ensuing financial year, in such strength that he would be able to collect his revenue and maintain order throughout Ears. I consequently advised the Inspector to frame his budget in such a way that its headings would only include such items of recurring and capital expendi ture as might be regarded as included within the compass of the normal needs of the administration of the province, and so that it might constitute a model for the coming year also, and that he should further prepare a supplementary budget for such extraordinary expenses as arrears and special punitive expedi tions. Funds to meet these latter estimates would be forthcoming partly from the 20,000 Tomans which M. Mornard promises, and partly from the current financial year’s provincial reAnnues. If these resources did not suffice, applica tion shouhl be made to Tehran for a further grant.8 The Inspector entirely agreed and has promised to prepare a budget on these lines. He seems to he a sensible person, and has made a yeyy favourable impression on me. I shall of course telegraph full details for your approval as soon as they reach me officially. In the meanwhile, I trust that my advice to the Inspector is approved of generally. It appears to me that if w r e let this £15,000 or any large portion of it, be frittered away on objects which cannot be of permanent utility to the province, the money will be dissipated and Ears will be no better off than it was before ; whereas if the expenditure of this sum is so arranged as to place the forces and finances of Ears on a firm basis, and to constitute a model for future guidance, we shall have laid the foundations of a real constructive policy upon which it will be possible in future years to build. Telegram P., No. 302, dated the 20th (received 21st) December 1912. From—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Political Resident, Bushire. (Addressed Shiraz, No. 109.) I entirely approve of the language held by you to Mirza Mustafa Khan, as reported in your telegram No. 214. I am emphatically of the opinion that no part of the £15,000 should be devoted to extraordinary expenditure except in case of extreme urgency, as the sum will soon be frittered away, as you say, if we tolerate such a use of the money. I am glad that the Inspector seems to you to be a capable person. The Treasurer-General speaks highly of him, but of course (as it is clear you fully realize) all expenditure will require careful supervision.Telegram P., No. 1503, dated (and received) the 30th December 1912. Prom—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Delhi. I have addressed following to Tehran Legation, dated 29th:— Begins. The Persian Government and other interested parties are, I submit, deliberately taking advantage of our liberal principles and at difficult juncture our interests are prejudiced by the use of Reuter and the English and Anglo-Indian Press for the publication of false and damaging accounts of the passing events with the specific intention of misleading public or “to allay excitement in London and Calcutta.” We know, for example, that the Persian Consul-General at Calcutta receives regularly from his Foreign Office rubbish for Press purposes and his fantastic communiques are published solely by the Anglo-Indian Press, j generally without comment; while in connection with recent Eckford incident garbled and inaccurate messages have been telegraphed by Reuter’s Agency | derived from or supplied by Swedish or Persian sources, the effect of which, in military eyes, is to cast a wholly undeserved and unnecessary slur on a regiment of Indian cavalry. The subject should, in my opinion, he taken up. I venture to express the hope that it will he deemed possible to ask the editors of the respectable Anglo-Indian papers and Reuter Company not to publish without taking steps to check its accuracy from responsible British officials with whom they are ordinarily in touch news from obviously tainted Persian sources. I may mention as recent instances first the entry in Bioneer of November 30th quoting a statement of the Consul-General for Persia, an official authority, that rahdari had been abolished, transport hire greatly decreased and security established on Shiraz road. Secondly, up to 21st December none of Reuter’s communications referred in any way to behaviour of the Indian troops, whilst in message of December 18th, the definite statement was made that “gendarmes escorting Captain Eckford eventually saved the situation ’ a statement | directly contrary to ascertainable facts of the case as recounted in telegrams from Decem ber 11th to December 14th from Consul, Shiraz.

I beg to send you, for your information, a copy of tbe translation of the telegram received from the Foreign Office, Tehran, stating the measures taken by my Government and the action of the Governor-General for Ears in this connection. “ On the 6 th of Mohurrum the Governor-General of Ears made the state ment by direct telegraphic communication to the Foreign Minister and the Minister of Interior which runs thus:—When I arrived at Shiraz the town and suburb were infested with robbers and the roads were closed. On my tak ing proper measures roads were opened, order restored in town and the cara vans began to move safely. Mr. Smart, the British Consul is also aware of this. The British officers who were confident of the safety of the roads desired to go on a shooting excursion. Although I wanted to give them an escort but they were so confident of the safety of the roads that they did not consider it neces sary. The British Consul and the Colonel look upon the incident of the murder as not due to the insecurity of the roads but as an accident. I am at present arranging to get the fresh consignment of arms arrived at Bushire and orders have been issued to the road guards and others who will start tomorrow. I had a conversation with the Consul who appreciated the proposed measures. It will require a month to fully carry out the scheme and to deal with the matters arising out of the attack on Mr. Smart and the recent incident. Three hun dred road-guards have already been sent in pursuit of the offenders and adequate steps are being taken from Gazroon * side. I am earnestly engaged in deal- remove the anxiety of Government. The British Consul admits that every possible effort was made to restore order and told me in an interview that so complete safety of roads during such a short time was unexpected.” Orders have been sent to the Governor of Bahbahan to move a force from there and an adequate force will also proceed from Shiraz, as the Governor- General has promised the offenders and culprits of both the occurrences in a month’s time will be punished. The summary of the report of the Commander of the gendarmes is as fol lows :—“It is a short time that gendarmes have been posted at Bushire road and so there has not been sufficient time to complete the arrangement in connection therewith. Major Morrel has gone to Bushire to bring the fresh consignment of arms. ” The officer in charge of the force sent in pursuit from Shiraz has returned and reported thus :—“ During the attack the gendarmes kept their post in good order and as stated by Englishmen they acted splendidly. Five gendarmes were wounded, of whom two are in a serious condition. The gendarmes and the soldiers were in safe position but the Indian Sowars mistakingly fired at them. * Kazerun ? ing with the situation and willTelegram P., No. 5 C., dated the 3rd January 1913.

No. 312, 31st ultimo. It seems to me that the admission which Reuter’s corres pondent invited you to communicate to me gives him away altogether. On September 27th, 1911, another instance of the same kind occurred, when animated by similar personal Mas he made a reference to dangerous dis orders at SMraz as “ insignificant ” and was, I believe, severely taken to task for so doing by the then British Minister, Tehran. Reuters, as I understand position, are of a different standing to a news paper, and as a company, profess to have no political or party axe to grind, but merely to distribute news to public. Their correspondent at Tehran has admittedly used his public position, in the cases referred to, for furthering his personal political bent by reporting with the knowledge or intention that they would mislead public, inaccurate reports without check or comment and statements regarding intentions of Persian Government which he was aware as well as ourselves to he merely spacious, and the former calculated incident ally to damage the reputation of British arms and British interests in Persia.

With reference to your telegram No. 5-C., I did not contemplate the occupation of Shiraz by military. It appeared to me that we could with strong posts and pickets hold road on both sides and could also take effective action against the Kashkuli and other villages in the Shahpur and Kazerun valleys which had been concerned in the attack on Smart if we occupied the Kazerun valley in strength. We should he a great source of strength with our troops in force in the Kazerun plain to a friendly Governor of Shiraz and with our advice and assistance he would be in a position to organise a Persian expedi tion against Boir Ahmadis and other distant tribes which may prove to have had a hand in Eckford incident ; we should also he able to assist Governor in keeping his communications open with Kazerun or Dastarjin. As regards Shiraz, for local purposes I considered cavalry already there would be quite sufficient, hut seeing that from Shiraz we are favourably situated for # r ^ a&gt; ? threatening flank of Kashkuli and * Kashgai Kashqlega* migrations and even, if neces sary for altogether blocking them. I think it would probably be advisable and easy for us to reinforce as opportunity offered the Central India Horse at Shiraz with another 500 men from the force at Kazerun. I should like to have the opinions of Consul at Shiraz and Colonel Douglas privately in regard to fore going but in the meantime these are my personal views as asked for.No. 3534, dated Bushire, the 29th December 1912 (received 6th January 1913).

He argued that as the men to compose the permanent force cannot be brought together before one month, it was not necessary to incur any expendi ture for that period, and that the sum so saved out of the budget requirements for the next three months would in consequence be available for the purposes of the expedition. I replied that it would not be possible to say whether any such savings could be effected or not until details of a budget had been prepared, and that^I was under the impression that any such small surplus as he was calculating on would be swallowed up by the organization of the corps. Apart from this however, which was only a matter of figures, I deprecated the use of any portion of the ;£ 15,000 for any purpose of a special character, and told him in so many words that in so doing 1 was acting under your orders. I am told by the Deputy Governor that there are no provided funds from which expenses of the expedition can be met, and that Tehran had made no special grant for the purpose. If no other funds are available for the purpose, it will I fear be necessary to break into the £15,000. There is no saying what expenditure such punitive measures may involve or how long they might last. I do not yet know what the Governor-General's estimate of the cost may be, but as soon as Hearn it I will telegraph again. In the meanwhile, 1 beg to suggest that the Persian Government should be asked themselves to arrange funds for such special disbursements as may be necessitated by the Governor-General’s proposed operations. Addressed Tehran, repeated Bushire as No. 67. Enclosure No. Telegram P., No. 219, dated (and received) 26th December 1912. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, -His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. I have the honour to address you in continuation of my telegram No. 213 in regard to the question of arms for the proposed military force. Some time ago 1,500 carbines and 500,000 rounds of ammunition arrived at Bushire for the use of the men of the gendarmerie, and a small force of gendarmes under Major Noren Brandel with another officer has gone to Bushire to bring up such portion of them as the gendarmerie here require, and also recruits amounting to about 100 men whom the Governor of the Gulf Ports has enlisted. Major Brandel arrived at Bushire some days ago with his party. Major Siefvert tells me that the gendarmes will only require 600 of these 1,500 carbines, and his plan at present is to leave the rest (900) at Bushire. Mukhber-es-Sultaneh however wishes to get hold of these 900 carbines for his new force, but as far as I can gather, has made no proposal to this effect to Siefvert and only knows from me what Siefvert's plans are. The latter on the other hand, has told me that as the arms are destined for the gendarmerie he cannot hand them over to anyone else. There is thus a prospect of a deadlock in the matter, and I have suggested to the Governor-General that he should discuss the matter frankly with Siefvert, in the first place, and that then, if the latter does not agree with his proposal, he should address the Persian Govern ment by telegraph on the subject, asking them to arrange the question with the Commandant of the gendarmerie. I trust that matter will be arranged in this way, and I only mention it in case reference should be made to you on the subject at the capital. J tll , t ;/; k 'd reqU '^ d lmmedlate| y b y ‘he gendarmerie, it is clear that it is best that the Persian Government should hand them over to the Gover- nor-General, who ,s m urgent need °f them, and should obtain others for the gendarmes, should such a course be indicated.In the meanwhile, however, thanks to the disturbed state of the road, it seems probable (Siefvert tells me) that Major Noren Brandel and his party will be delayed at Bushire indefinitely. No doubt Sir P. Z. Cox will communicate with you in regard to the former’s plans and future movements. Addressed Tehran, repeated Bushire as No. 69. Enclosure No. 4.

I have the honour to refer to the proposal for Bakhtiari expeditions into Ears against the Buwair Ahmadi Kuhgelus, or other tribesmen responsible for the Eckford incident, which was first intimated to me as a suggestion on the part of His Majesty’s Foreign Office, and has since been adverted to in more definite language by Reuters at Tehran. In the above connection I beg to inform Your Excellency that I was recently handed a Memorandum by His Majesty’s Vice Consul, Ahwaz, in which the view is incidentally expressed in connection with the main question of_ the restoration of security on the Bakhtiari road, that the Sardar-i*Jang is neither able nor disposed to undertake those military operations against the Kuhgelus which were the primary factor of his mission, and further that neither the _ Amir Mujahid nor any other Bakhtiari Khan is likely to succeed where he has failed. I would like also to remind Your Excellency that no steps have yet been taken, as far as we know, by the Sardar to ensure that exemplary punishment of the small section of the Kuhgelu who were responsible for the attack on Lieute nant Bullock (vide announcement in your telegram No. 576 to Foreign Office dated 1st November). The result of the incident might easily have been the same as in the Eckford case, and as you are aware the Indian orderly of Lieute nant Bullock has since died of his wound. Whilst I have no reason to suppose that the announcements in Reuters from Tehran mentioned above have had the previous approval or the subsequent endorsement of His Majesty’s Legation, yet in view of the widespread impression created both here and at Mohammerah and elsewhere by sucn announcements 1 venture to urge the expediency of our offering definite discouragement to the idea of the Bakhtiari entering on any untimely and ill-organized expeditions into Pars or elsewhere untff such time as they have shown their intention and ability to set their own house in order. I am sceptical of the ability of the Bakhtiari (even assuming their complete bond Mes) to achieve the object in view in any effective manner, and it seems doubtful whether it would be safe to reject the apprehension that such expeditions would be simply used for providing misleading journalistic copy and as a mean for extending the rapacious tentacles of the Bakhtiari into Pars and Arabistan. I would mention in conclusion that the value of British on the Ahwaz-lspahan road during the past two years exceeds that of goods on all the other southern routes collectively during the same penod. Since the above was cyphered, 1 have received a repetition of your tele gram No 178 December 22nd, to Shiraz, but as it still leaves me in some doubt a g s to whether or not the Balditiari expeditions referred to above are in serious contemplation, I think it best to let my views go on. _ . In conclusion I would observe that whilst the state of Shiraz and its immediate vicinitv mav have improved since Mukhber arrived I am unable to admit th there^has’beenTny 'amelioration of the state of the province generally, nor do I know what grounds there may be for such an assertion.

Reuter’s telegrams were based on information which was supplied by the’ Persian Government, and did not of course imply that British officers were to be used. At the time of the Eckford incident, Reuter’s agent was in quarantine with measles and I did not in any way control what he sent. To infer from the Bullock incident that Sardar*i-Jang has failed to restore order on the Bakhtiari road is perhaps hardly fair. It is unfortunate that Captain Grey represented the work done by the Sardar-i-Jang i^ such a different light to you to the picture he drew to me of the Sardar’s ability and energy. It helps materially to a true appreciation of a situation if reports are consistent, and had I been in possession of the views of Captain Grey, as expressed to you, I should have opposed both Lieutenant Bullock’s journey and that of Major Cox. Reports from Ispahan, unprejudiced by the Khans here, say that a severe defeat has been inflicted on the expedition sent to punish the assailants of Lieute nant Bullock : it is stated that Sardar-i-Jang is now preparing a more extensive movement against the Kuhgelu. I have had no time to have the (records ?) carefully examined, but I think that, if the value of goods previously robbed on the Bakhtiari road during the last two years exceeds the value of robberies on the other southern roads it must have been due to one special raid when a large accumulation of goods was carried off. I have no brief for the Ahwaz-Ispahan road, but surely robberies on the Shiraz road must have been far more frequent and illegal tolls more extortionate ? Otherwise the unsavoury reputation of the latter has been most unjustly earned.' Addressed Bushire. repeated to Shiraz as No. 309. Enclosure No 7.

M94, da.ed 37 «h December. cUtTence in the views which Sir P. Z. CoX has expiessed in regard to the Bakhtiari. I did not understand that their usewas contemplated except as a means of preventing the Boir Ahmedis from escaping. I scarcely fancy that the Central Government ever thought that Bakhtiari would be induced to move, but they wished to make some show of taking action, and therefore from force of habit started the story regarding the Bakhtiaris, whom it has been the custom for the past year or two to use as the sole punitive force at the disposal of the Central Government: they were also the nearest tribe to the scene of action, were the Boir Ahmedi to break west wards. Had I opposed the idea, the Persian Government would have had some ground for arguing that we had not permitted the use by them of the only force at their disposal, as the Governor General of Pars himself said, and rightly in my view, that Kashgais should not be employed. The Sardar Assad told me on the 26th that he had received a telegram from Mukhber-es-Saltaneh to the effect that he was despatching armies (szc) to Kazerun and Ardekan, and that he was now disposed to believe that the robbers were Kashgais and that until he had satisfied himself as to the identity of the robbers, he did not want any Bakhtiaris to move.

I have addressed you by telegraph separately regarding announcements by Reuters and in the Press. I regret that my quotation of Captain Grey should have conveyed the impression that he was inconsistent: this is not really the case. His observa tions were dated December 8th, 6 weeks after the Bullock incident, and subsequent to the arrival at Ispahan of Major Cox, and were based on the develop ments, or rather the discouraging absence of them, since his despatch of the 23rd September No. 22, in which his hopes were clearly based primarily on Amir Mujahid’s success in obtaining control of the Kuhgelu. Since then, the Sardar-i-Jang had passed into the low country without having made any attempt to inflict punishment on the Kugelu, whilst the Amir Mujahid had also signally failed up to date to coerce them, or even to induce their chiefs to come in for discussion. It was not my intention to suggest that the missions of the above mentioned Khans had already failed. It was premised by Captain Grey, and I concur, that to pass a verdict at this stage would be premature, and that it is still conceivable that they may succeed; but he concluded his remarks as follows Begins .— “ If the Kuhgelu continue out of control, I do not think that Jang can or will keep the road safe. Without the use of force, I do not think the Kuhgelu can be got in hand, and I do not think it likely that force will be used against them. If I am right in my suppositions, we may, I think, abandon hope of any other Khan or Khans succeed ing where Jang has failed.”— Ends. I concur that, on the whole, the condition of the Bakhtiari road is by no means so unsatisfactory as that of the Bushire-Shiraz road; what I wished to demonstrate was that for the Bakhtiari to keep their own road in order and thereby fulfil their obligations to the Persian Government was a task of quite sufficient urgency and difficulty, without their intervening in questions connected with the Bushire road, and thereby introducing into the political situation of Ears fresh complications.

(February 15, 1 p.m.) YOUR telegram No. 76 of the 12 th February. I have sketched roughly to Minister for Foreign Affairs conditions under which His Majesty’s Government are disposed to advance i00,000L to Persian Government for special services connected with Fars. His Excellency expressed himself as quite ready to come to an arrangement on line suggested. Before proceeding further I would venture to submit certain observations on the proposals. 1 . I am strongly of opinion that any financial assistance rendered ^ to the gendarmerie scheme should be kept quite apart from any help that may be given for administration of promise, in spite of the fact that two schemes dovetail into each other and the one stands a poor chance of success without the other. 2 . I have expressed myself badly if I have caused you to understand that I do not agree that Governor-General should have force of his own. I am of opinion that such a force is most necessary. Where O’Connor and I disagree is on question as to foreio-n officers for that force. He is in favour of British officers. I consider Swedish officers or officers affiliated to gendarmerie are more desirable. I have suggested Colonel Merrill, an American, who stayed on after Shuster left. O’Connor concurs m this suggestion, but wants him to be seconded from gendarmerie. This seems to me undesirable, though his work would be obviously of an independent nature. 3 . Gendarmerie budget in Fars is estimated at close upon 8 , 000 L a-month, and administration budget at rather more than the same figure, so that it is evident that sum would not suffice for all purposes. I think budget should be prepared here, but amended bv officer commanding, Shiraz, in concert with financial agent and British consul, and that money should be paid under my sanction through the treasurer-general to colonel commanding here for transmission to Shiraz. This would ensure suitable and effective control. I am of opinion that the 100 , 000 £. should be set aside for gendarmerie, to be paid in monthly instalments and, say, 30,0001. be advanced separately for Fars administration to enable Governor-General to carry on till end of June, or earmarked out of the advance of 200 , 000 Z. Minister of the Interior is of opinion that all efforts ot Persian Government should be turned to the restoration of order in the south 4 Question as to proper security and interest is receiving^ attention, but I fail to see why the Russian Government should object to advance being secured on loan as the increase to nearly double its present strength of the Cossack brigade is to be mad as soon as the loan is issued. . n. ^-i .i ^ 5 I consider money devoted to the formation of a strong force under the Governor-General’s orders can justifiably be held to have been expended for the purpose of securing order on trade routes, because, as stated above, gendarmer e local force must co operate in suppressing disturbances and bn g anda «®; forwarded 6 Governor-General is most anxious to receive your answer to request forwarded in mytelegram Na 34 . . for 2,000 rifles and ammunition, as he cannot proceed with training of his recruits without the arms.

While agreeing that present opportunity should be used to obtain certain definite concessions from Persian Government, we submit following remarks on desiderata enumeiated by Cox:— (1.) Recognition of our prescriptive right to buoying, lighting, and policing of Gulf is most desirable and should be pressed, but no reaffirmation regarding quarantine seems necessary. (2.) This might stand over as not urgent. (3.) Such undertaking would be impossible without previous agreement of Russian Government, which it is doubtless inconvenient to seek at piesent juncture, as this would probably involve counter demands from Russia. (4.) Navigation riglits on Karun are not pressing, but might be mentioned. . n . . , . , (5.) Our de facto position at Bahrein and on 1 racial coast is assured vis-a-vis Persia, but we might demand recognition of British Consular protection in Persia for Bahrein and Trucial subjects. ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) might stand over and be dealt with when occasion arises. As regards last paragraph of Cox’s telegram, we think that if general subject of British interests in Persia is to be broached, we should ceitamly press for an undertaking from Persia not to lease or alienate any island or part of island, in Gulf to other Powers without our concurrence—and further undertake to lease to us, should occasion arise such portions ol Kishm, Henjam, Hormuz, Larak, and Sheikh-Shuaib Island as may be required in connection with lighting, buoying, and policing of Gull, and for convenience of His Majesty s ships so employed.CONFIDENTIAL. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to Sir Edward Grey. -{Received January 19, 8*30 p.m.) -»* Bushire, January 19, 1913. ^vo. 115.) {January 19, 4 p.m.) RECENT Reuter telegrams emanating from Tehran and London seem to adumbrate that His Majesty’s Government may be giving lively consideration to the pros and cons of the grant of a further respite to the Persian Government for restoring order on the Bushire-Ispahan road and in Ears generally, and, if this is the case, it can only be in conjunction with an extensive scheme for the financing of the Governor- General by Imperial Government. Without touching on prospects of such a scheme, I venture to urge, in case anything of tha sort is on the tapis, the importance of our securing from the Persian Government, in return for such forbearance, the preliminary settlement of various desiderata, regulation of which would assist towards the consolidation of our position and legitimate interests. Immediate loss both in trade and prestige which will be involved to us by further long-suffering is so considerable that it would appear gratuitously quixotic for us to refrain from requiring the Persian Government, as a condition of it, to recompense us as far as they can for the damage their impotence brings on us. Satisfaction of our requirements in these matters involves no difficulty or loss of authority or dignity for the Persian Government, and moreover, it is not our position vis-a-vis of Persia which we seek to better thereby, but our position vis-a-vis of foreign Powers. To the strengthening of this latter position Persia should be interested little less than ourselves, for she must surely now see in Great Britain a friendly Power whose [? aim] it is to uphold her. Desiderata which occurred to me are as follows :— 1. Documentary recognition of our prescriptive rights to control lighting, buoying, and policing of Gulf in the same way that our position has been recognised in respect of quarantine, in regard to which the position might with advantage be reaffirmed incidentally. . . 2. Documentary recognition as a permanency of the old prescriptive postal rights and privileges which wel still enjoy, and an expression of readiness to see those extended to other Persian ports of the Persian Gulf as occasion may require. 3. Undertaking to refrain from giving any lease or concession, commercial or otherwise, in Southern and South-Western Persia (i.e., in the area comprising the British and central zones under the Anglo-Russian convention), or in Persian islands of the Gulf, to any foreign subjects or Government, without the knowledge and consent of His Majesty’s Government. We have precedent for such a request in the under taking given by the Shah to the Russian Minister referred to in Mr. Marling s telegram of 27th August, 1908, to the Foreign Office, repeated by me to India on the following day. This perhaps might be secured in the course of current negotiations for mining concessions. 4. Extension of rights of navigation to the Upper Karun. _ . . . 5. Abandonment of empty claims to sovereignty over Bahrein and recognition ot our protective rights over those islands and Trucial Coast and our title to protect their subjects in Persia. . , • • p 6 . Undertaking to grant option to British company when the time is ripe tor formation of lighterage company in Gulf ports. 7. Acceptance of consular officer at Bampur when needed.

J (January 9, 7‘30 p.m.) YOUR telegram No. 40 His Majesty’s resident at Bushire has been for so long closely associated with march of affairs in Southern Persia that he is specially well qualified to judge of the effect upon British trade and prestige which has resulted from policy of forbearance adopted by His Majesty’s Government, and what is likely to issue from a continuance of this policy. Cox would entertain small hope of any improvement of the situation from the gendarmerie and other measures which the Persian Government propose to take to restore order if the financial assistance of His Majesty’s Government can be secured. After the many previous failures it is but natural that this should be the case. Perhaps because I have not been a close witness of destruction of former hopes I am disposed to believe much good may result from the occupation in force of the road by the gendarmerie. Should this happen there should be gain and not loss to British trade. Loss of prestige in the eyes of Orientals is more difficult to gauge, but T scarcely imagine that petty attacks by brigands on British contingents who were practically in a position of not being able to hit back, even if such insults remain unavenged on the spot, will foot count for much as long as British interests are represented by men who inspire general respect and confidence. You are doubtless in possession of telegram addressed to Secretary of State for India by Government of India in answer to telegram from Bushire upon which my views are asked. They and Cox are so much better able than I am to judge of requirements of our position in the Gulf, that I would beg to confine myself to a statement of opinion that the present occasion might fairly be utilised to pi ess Persian Government to recognise formally our prescriptive rights in matters connected with navigation in the Gulf.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey .—■ (No. 264.) Sir, Tehran, December 23, 1912. THE recent unfortunate incident on the Bushire-Shiraz road occurred at a moment when the Governor-General had commenced the elaboration of schemes which are somewhat different in nature although ultimately intended to serve the same objects, namely, the restoration of order and the better collection of the revenues of the province. The one scheme involves the creation of a military force, the other the elaboration of a budget. Since the military force would be employed to assist in the collection of revenue, the two schemes are closely allied, but I think it will simplify an understanding of Mukhber-es-Sultaneh’s aims if I deal with the two subjects in separate despatches, endeavouring at the same time to disassociate, as far as may be possible, what are intended to be permanent measures of administration from the special steps that are being taken to punish the authors of the assault on British troops that occurred on the 11 th instant. Almost immediately upon his arrival at Shiraz, Mukhber-es-Sultaneh realised that it would be impossible to establish his personal authority in the province and secure the collection of the revenues, unless he could create a military force that would be capable of operating wherever troubles might be found, and which would also he sufficiently numerous and efficient to administer a salutary lesson to any one of the more or less insubordinate tribes as occasion might require. His Excellency estimated that he would want a force of from 1,500 to 2,000 men, picked from the best material at his disposal, which would be independent of the gendarmerie, but, of course, ready to come to the assistance of the latter force if required. For the sake of his own personal position, the Governor-General would, not unnaturally, prefer that such a force should be attached to himself and be under his direct orders. The accompanying copy of a telegram from His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz shows that Mukhter-es-Sultaneh is now busily engaged in the. preparation of his military scheme, which would appear to have the cordial support of the principal landowners, who would naturally prefer to see order preserved by a Government force rather than j j be dependent upon the more powerful of the tribes for the time being. It will be seen ■ that the Governor-General now proposes to create a force of only 1,000 picked men, in order to keep within the bounds of his financial resources, reserving to himself the right to increase the numerical strength of the force in proportion as the means at his disposal may allow. It will be seen from Major O’Connor’s above-quoted telegram, that he considers Mukhber-es-Sultaneh to be a man possessed of sound ideas and theories, but to stand in need of the guiding hand of an experienced adviser in matters of practical detail. . . It would, in my opinion, be most satisfactory if such a force as that under consideration could be purely Persian in all its elements, but experience has shown that the Persian military officer of the day is not competent to carry out the organisation, equipment, and training necessary to create a really effective force without the assistance of European advice. It would appear from the telegraphic reports received from Major O’Connor that the Governor-General would be_ glad to secure the services of one or more British officers for the proposed force. Whilst there are good arguments to be adduced 1 m “favour of such a course, there are, I think, even more cogent reasons against its adoption. The most important objection to the enrolment of British officers in the Governor-General’s force lies m tne fact that there is alieady a military organisation, the gendarmerie, at Shiraz under Swedish officers. Were a new force to be created under British officers it would lead to all sorts of troubles and complications. The Swedish officers aljeady complain very bitterly that innumerable obstacles have been put in their way by the Shiraz authorities before the arrival of Mukhber-es-Sultaneh. Were his Excellency to now enlist a force of his own, he would naturally endeavour to secure the best material for himself, and the Swedes would have an additional grievance were these picked men to be put under British officers. These are, I think, good reasons why the Governor-General shopld wish to have an independent body of men that he could use as occasion required without having to [2763/—5] StlivTo ll 4 !refer to the commanding officer of the gendarmerie, but it would appear to me desirable that he should endeavour to obtain the services of Swedish officers if it is considered that Europeans are essential for the. creation of an effective force. Mukhber-es- Sultaneh has had German training, speaks that language fluently, and had excellent - relations with the Swedish officers who escorted him to Shiraz from Tehran. He could, therefore, probably work quite well with men of that nationality provided that he could secure their services. I have discussed the question of the Ears gendarmerie with Colonel Hjalmarson, who informs me that he has now a very considerable staff* of Persian officers and non commissioned officers at his disposal in a very efficient state of preparation. He says that he has always calculated upon having a force of 3,000 or 4,000 men in Ears, and that if the necessary funds were forthcoming he has plently of material of the instructor class at hand to create a force of that magnitude in a relatively short space of time, more especially if Mukhber-es-Sultaneh would co-operate loyally with him in the recruiting of better men than those that have been obtainable in the Shiraz district hitherto. *• Under such conditions it would perhaps be possible to organise the creation of a sufficiently large force under Swedish direction to allow of a part being devoted exclusively to the requirements of the Governor-General, whilst the remainder would perform the regular duties of the gendarmerie. An organised and well-drilled force of 4,000 men should suffice to restore complete order in the province, more especially if it was recruited from the excellent fighting material that the local tribes could supply. Unfortunately, want of money will make it extremely difficult to carry out such a scheme. At the present moment 70,000 tomans (£13,000) are due to the gendarmerie for the current Persian month. The treasury is entirely empty and M. Mornard is making vain endeavours to borrow the money where he can. The manager of the Imperial Bank is considering lending M. Mornard the money, although he has no security to offer but the surplus of the southern customs which the treasurer-general ought to be putting aside to meet the heavy payments due next March. Even should the money be forthcoming this time, it is not clear that there will be any chance of finding it next month as the treasurer-general has no source of settled income upon which he can rely. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1 . Consul O’Connor to Sir W. Townleu. (No. 213.) U (Telegraphic.) SUraz, December 19, 1912. GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S scheme for preparing small regular force.

Eorce may be used as nucleus for laiger body which can be raised at any time and in co-operation with gendarmerie, old serbases and such local support should be amply sufficient by the spring under proper leadeiship to punish any particular tribe or section selected for the purpose. He is now active y engaged in preliminaries to his plan. His first object is to make certain of securing suitable type , of man.

Since date of telegrams repeated to you by post under my despatch dated 15th December, No. 3448, O’Connor has sent long telegrams to Minister and self to following effect;—As regards Eckford incident, he maintains that, although it is possible that Boir Abmadi tribesmen may have taken part, it is certain in any case that they were well supported by Mamaseni and Kashgai tribesmen and that Governor-General is anxious in the first instance to chastise Muhammad Ali Khan Kashkuli whose suppression is essential. O’Connor urges that incident does not in any way alter general situation which existed previously. He therefore deprecates forcing Governor-General to take immediate or premature punitive measures which are certain to (P) be unsuccessful and suggests that he be allowed some months in which to organize small regular force which, apart from punitive expedition, will be of permanent use to Governor-General and will, he hopes, enable him to secure reparation for attacks on Eckford and Smart.

I quite appreciate full force of your argu ment against employment of Englishmen in financial and military capacities here, but before dropping matter altogether may I try and put before you my general view of situation. It seems to me that His Majesty’s Government are now definitely confronted with practical certainty of having to send a large ex pedition into Southern Persia during the course of next few months. Delay of four months to give Governor-General chance of doing something will make it too late for operations to take place in the spring, so, in the event which we all anticipate that Persian Government and Governor-General will prove unequal to task of restoring order in Southern Persia, we shall be forced into despatch of expedition probably next autumn. I do not know of course how His Majesty’s Government regard prospect of such an expedition, but I imagine they would be glad to escape necessity. But the only way they can escape it is, I think, by adoption of some definite constructive line of policy in Pars which, whilst maintaining the present form of Government, will so support and reinforce it as to enable or indeed to compel it to assume some of the efficiency^ which it at present lacks. Our present policy here is, I venture to think, too indefinite to be capable of producing such effects. It was in view of such general con siderations as this that I have ventured in my recent telegram to indicate what I regarded as the minimum of the measures which might be taken to secure stable Government for Pars. The proposal as you know was enough and was confined to the suggestion of employment of a few Englishmen in administra tion, and I may add that I also had in mind possibility of further loan later on. As you are aware question of employment of British military officers in South ern Persia is not a new one. It has been definitely proposed on one occasion by His Majesty’s Government and was discussed at Balmoral. I realise that diffi culties might arise by employment of British and Swedish officers side by side, but if the°respective duties of the gendarmerie and military were carefully differentiated and defined I scarcely think these difficulties would insuperable. And may I remind you that two forces officered respective y by Russian and Swedish officers exist in Northern Persia and appear to work without undue friction. Nor could the organisation 0 a mi r ary force by British officers be regarded as any reflection whatever upon Swedes. Their gendarmerie might continue to carry-on duties ol gendar merie such as policing roads, etc., whilst military force would have its head-quarters at Shiraz and would be available for more pure y nrr r ary measures such as coercion and punishment of troublesome tir esmen or o sia r armed bands as might be too strong for gendarmerie to tackffi My reasons im thinking Swedish officers are not altogether suitable for task are that their experience in dealing with Eastern peoples is too limited to ena e em m a ® 1 time to accommodate themselves to peculiar conditions prevailing in or a. This we have all seen already, and secondly, I may mention that Gmemor-G - ral has already spoken to me with some bitterness o ns Anrl^m mv methods, their high handedness, their lack of tact and daring etc And in my opinion he is justified in these strictures. M hereas I think ^ wrU b e admitted that Indian Army could supply not one bu many i wledne f right type for such a task and with additional qualifications of Persian language and practical experience in hiU warfare But g ^ y difficulties and anomalies in situation question reso ^ g xj iern p ers i a evils, is it better to continue our present indefinite p y , i nev itablv end which in opinion of yourself and other competent ju g ^ inaugurate in despatch of expedition ; or to make at any ra e an . . ^ p ars on more constructive policy which may eyentu^al y p ace adm ^ any otliers a stable basis whether by methods which I l iaA T nuestion or Finan- which may occur to you or to your other advisers.

Under such scheme, it would seem possib 1 e for the Customs to eliminate the present bone of contention by abandoning the collection of revenue and permit ting the Governor to exercise this function again. The latter would, in this case, be obliged to pay into the account of the Treasurer-General, and submit his accounts, and a regular budget, in return for which he would receive re gular monthly payments (on the basis of the budget estimates) guaranteed by us, or with our cognizance on certain conditions. The local representative of the Treasurer-General wou 1 d have my cordial support in keeping the Governor up to such an arrangement, which the latter has repeated’y expressed his readiness to accept in principle.

I communicated the substance of your telegram No. 171,* toMukhbir- *FTiriosiire s es-Sultaneh to-day. With regard to the Enclosures. . finance j had already ' heard His Excellency speak very plainly of his distrust of Mornard and of Belgian Treasury officials. As regards Monsieur Mornard’s local agent, he says that he has no objec tion to supervisory control by a European of his finances, but he apprehends that a European will attempt to exercise executive functions in connection with the collection of revenue, which will inevitably lead to friction. He emphasized the need for elasticity in system and the necessity of allow ing for local susceptibilities and prejudices, more particularly having regard to the present weakness of Government and of the lack of material force to support the executive. He is apprehensive that a European will try to insist on too rigid a system, and will prove hut little amenable to the advice of the Governor-General in delicate and difficult situations. He is prepared, neverthless, to do his best to work in harmony with the new agent and declares in reply to your telegram No. 171 that he has already done what he could to place his relations with the Treasurer-General on an amicable basis, and asks me to assure you that if it can possibly be avoided, no friction will arise locally between him and Einance Agent. I can see however that the idea of a Belgian Agent on whose tact and personality so much will now depend, is profoundly distasteful to him. Much the same sentiments seem to prevail locally, and an agitation by local land-holders and tax-payers against the appointment of Monsieur Stas is threatened. More follows. O’CONNOR. Enclosure 14.

Mukbbir-es-Sultaneh feels most actuely his present impotent position, and his inability either to cope with armed brigands or marauding tribesmen, or the even more serious peril of intriguers and “ agents provocateurs.” He therefore wishes to organize as soon as he can a small regular mobile force with a nucleus of about TOGO men whose headquarters will be at Shiraz, which will be directly controlled by him, and which he hopes will be available to enforce payment of revenue in the spring, and to make an example, should it be neces sary, of at least one section of a troublesome tribe. Want of munitions is the main difficulty in organizing such a force, but he hopes shortly to obtain a supply of arms and ammunition from Bushire. I have already discussed details with the Governor-General, with whom I am in complete agreement. He has promised to let me have detailed proposal6 'T' i in a few days, and these will be telegraphed to you on receipt for your infor mation and approval. I may add that my private opinion is that without the assistance of at least one ‘European officer, it will be impossible for the Governor-General to organise an effective force ; I propose, however, to address you again on this point.

Colonel Douglas has handed me detailed report of incident drawn up by Major Kettlewell from which I extract following details. Begins :—Party consisted of Major Kettlewell, Captain Eckford, 1 non-commis sioned officer, 26 sowars, 17 followers and 17 baggage mules. They started from Khaneh Zinian 7 a.m. 11th December, half an hour after party of about 150 Persian sarbazes who were marching down road independently. 12 men Avere told off as baggage guard remainder with officers as advance guard. At bridge over Kara Agach river Persian officer of gendarmerie with 2 mounted gendarmes who had accompanied Major Kettlewell to river, galloped on ahead to inspect gendarmerie post at Burji Timuri on tops of Sinah Safid Pass. Major KettleAAell also sent on ahead native officer and 2 sowars to prepare quarters at Dasht Arjan. Scouts were also posted on wooded hills on left flank. After short halt party proceeded. Hoad here runs through tamarisk and thorn jungle for about 1^ miles. The 2 officers accompanied by 6 or 7 sowars had passed beyond jungle, and just as leading mules were appearing from jungle hot fire was opened on party from hills on left. Advanced party galloped ahead, got under cover, dismounted and started to climb hill. It was difficult to discern enemy through thick jungle but shots were exchanged and it was now that Captain Eckford was shot through heart. Eew minutes later Major Kettlewell saw from crest of ridge 150 to 200 men rush out from bottom of ravine below towards river bank. His men fired at them but they quickly disap peared into jungle. Meanwhile sowars of baggage guard had crossed to N. bank of river and taken up position in low hills. They report that smaller body of robbers joined attack also from N. Major Kettlewell now collected men Arith him, descended hill and crossed river bed taking Captain Eckford’s body mth him. They joined other party and N. O. and two sowars who had gone ahead also rejoined party here. Meanwhile robbers appear to have made off oyer hills to N. with their booty. Whole party then returned to Khaneh Zinian moving by N. bank of river. During this movement some 15 to 20 horsemen Avere seen on hills to N. and shots exchanged. Major Kettlewell states that he saw no caravan either at Serai at Khaneh Zinian or on road. Small party of Persians with 3 or 4 mules who left Serai alter sowars had started were robbed and their mules taken. They returned to Serai on foot rwhee Major Kettlewell saw them but he had not seen them on road. Ends. Major Kettlewell also states that beyond the firing no attempt was made to attack his small party. Kobbers were apparently only out for plunder and cleared off at once when they had seized mules. As to gendarmes, it would appear that Persian officer when he reached the Burj brought his men back along crest of hills and it was there that they were wounded. Major Kettlewell only saAv them in the distance moving along hills to south when he was return ing towards Khaneh Zinian. Copy of Major Kettlewell’s detailed report will be posted to you by Colonel Douglas. I am replying in a separate telegram to other points raised in vour telegram under reply.

(Addressed Minister, No. 202.) (P). I beg to state, with reference to Tehran telegram No. 172 that all details which can he furnished by Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas and Major Kettle- well in regard to the actual circumstances of the attack on the latter’s party have # Enclosure 14 . been furnished in my telegram * en clair Nos. 51—201. It will be seen that not only was there no intention of escorting a caravan, but that the fact that there was a caravan m the vicinity of his party was not known to Major Kettlewell. The only instructions which I can find, after searching the records of this office, which at all resemble those referred to in Poreign Ofliee telegram, namely that— t£ Troops^ were not to go out of Shiraz except for exercise in close vicinity ” are those contained in Teheran telegram No. 60, dated Marcli 3rd, to the effect that— “ Some understanding should be come to with the Deputy Governor as to the direction and limits within which troops can be safely exercised. ” J The expedition in question having been planned with the cognizance and consent of the Governor-General, I venture to think that the spirit of these instructions has been observed, even if not the exact letter. It is scarcely necessary for me to add that neither Colonel Douglas or my self are likely to disregard wilfully the instructions of Your Excellency or of Government. I beg to report as follows in respect of the other points raised in your telegram No. 172 which are not fully answered by my preceding telegram. (1) Name of responsible tribe. —Not yet known for certain. I was told yesterday by the Governor-General’s Secretary that they were Buwair Ahmadis, but other mformation points to their having been Dushmanziari and other Mamaseni tribesmen, who (as my predecessor will inform you) are under the influence of Muhammad Ah Khan Kashkuli, together with other of the latter’s followers. As soon as more definite information is available it will be telegraphed to (2) Casualties among gendai'mes. —The Swedish Commandant here now tells me that four were wounded and one killed. (3) Regarding the caravan. —There is a discrepancy between the different reports but the latest available information gives the total number of mules at 140 of which only about 30 (with their loads) were carried off. Major Kettlewell, however, saw nothing of them, and cannot say where exactly they were attacked. (4) The attack. —It is clear from Major Kettlewell’s narrative that this was aimed not against the officers and men, but was actuated purely by motives of robbery, the case differing in this respect from previous attacks which have been made during the last year upon British officers and men.

While agreeing that present opportunity should be used to obtain certain definite concessions from Persian Government, we submit following remarks on desiderata enumerated by Cox :— (1.)/Recognition of our prescriptive right to buoying, lighting, and policing of Gulf is most desirable and should be pressed, but no reaffirmation regarding quarantine seems necessary. (2.) This might stand over as not urgent. (3.) Such undertaking would be impossible without previous agreement of Russian Government, which it is doubtless inconvenient to seek at present juncture, as this would probably involve counter demands from Russia. (4.) Navigation rights on Karun are not pressing, but might be mentioned. . (5.) Our de facto position at Bahrein and on r lracial coast is assured vis-a-vis Persia, but we might demand recognition of British Consular protection in Persia for Bahrein and Trucial subjects. (6) and (7) might stand over and be dealt with when occasion arises. As regards last paragraph of Cox’s telegram, we think that if general subject of British interests in Persia is to be broached, we should ceitaml} press for an undertaking from Persia not to lease or alienate any island or part of island, in Gulf to other Powers without our concurrence—and further undertake to lease to us, should occasion arise such portions ol Kishm, Henjam, Hormuz, Larak, and Sheikh-Shuaib Island as may be required in connection with lighting, buoying, and policing of Gull, and for convenience of His Majesty s ships so employed.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.! r PERSIA.

I VERY much regret to Rave to report that the situation in Ears would appear to have taken a turn for the worse, and that there is grave reason to fear a return to the old state of disorder, if not a still worse condition of things, next spring. As I had the honour to inform you, Sir, in my telegram No. 609 of to-day’s date, the officer in command of the gendarmerie at Shiraz has reported that he has been obliged to withdraw the force stationed at Zergoun on the Ispahan-Shiraz road, because the Governor-General has not been able to fulfil his promise to build forts on the road between Zergoun and Shiraz. I am not at all surprised that this retrograde step should have been found necessary, because when the forward movement was carried out, almost immediately after Mukhber-es-Sultaneh’s arrival at Shiraz, I opined that it was premature, and that the gendarmerie force at Shiraz was not in sufficient strength to take over the road. It would appear that it has also not been found possible to carry out the entire programme between Shiraz and Kazerun to the south, in consequence of tribal opposition, and of the inability of the Governor-General to supply local tufangchis as arranged. There would also appear to have been difficulty in recruiting, due to the opposition of Kavam-ul-Mulk, who has proved himself an inveterate antagonist of the gendarmerie scheme, and the Governor of the Gulf ports, at the instigation of the former. I have sent both these personages a warning, the one through the Minister of War, and the other through Sir Percy Cox. It is by no means improbable that the gendarmes on the road south of Shiraz may have to be called in, and it is perhaps unfortunate that the forward movement was taken in hand until the force had been strengthened. Should such a withdrawal have to be made, it must necessarily influence the position of the Governor-General as well as that of the gendarmerie, which would be much to be regretted. Mukhber-es-Sultaneh on his first arrival appeared to be most successful in recon ciling divergent interests, and it seemed at one moment as if he might succeed in establishing a better order of things, though Mr. Smart expressed himself as sceptical from the first of much real improvement resulting ultimately. I believe that the Governor-General has been untiring in his efforts to restore peace, but he has unfortunately been handicapped from the first by the usual want of money, which has cramped his efforts, and made it impossible to carry out his promises. The penury of his treasury has been quickly appreciated by the rival chieftains, who have little by little grown colder in their friendship and more apathetic in their offers of assistance, offers which were probably only made in the hope that there might be money forthcoming foi It is to be hoped that the pecuniary assistance now given by His Majesty s Government may not come too late to enable Mukhber-es-Sultaneh to re-establish himse and create a force without which it would be hopeless for him to attempt to collect the revenues or make himself respected. His Excellency has already sent me a message o the effect that he must resign his appointment as no funds were forthcoming. ^ e officer commanding the gendarmerie has also advised the colonel in comman a e ia T that he and his brother Swedish officers are seriously contemplating sen mg in en resignations on account of the hopelessness of their task. Major le ver , e o cer m question, is rather impulsive by nature, and he will doubtless is en o is co one adV1 T gather P from t the Treasurer-General that Mukhber-es-Sultaneh has stated that he will not recognise any financial agent at Shiraz who is not presene dp f Minister of Finance.

While urging the necessity of exacting reparation for attacks on our officers, we are oi opinion that a further period of grace should be given to the Governor- Generai of bars, and that he be put in funds, and that question of sending an expedition be postponed till the autumn.CONFIDENTLY Lieutenant-Colonel &amp;ir P. Cox to Sit lt/dwctrd Grey. -(Received Januavy 19, 8*30 p.m.) RECENT Reuter telegrams emanating from Tehran and London’ seem to adumbrate that His Majesty’s Government may be giving lively consideration to the pros and cons of the grant of a further respite to the Persian Government for restoring order on the Bushire-Ispahan road and in Ears generally, and, if this is the case, it can only be in conjunction with an extensive scheme for the financing of the Governor- breneral by imperial Government. Without touching on prospects of such a scheme, I venture to urge, in case anything of the sort is on the tapis, the importance of our securing from the Persian Government, in return for such forbearance, the preliminary settlement of various desiderata, regulation of which would assist towards the consolidation of our position and legitimate interests. Immediate loss both in trade and prestige which will be involved to us by further long-suffering is so considerable that it would appear gratuitously quixotic for us to refrain from requiring the Persian Government, as a condition of it, to recompense us as far as they can for the damage their impotence brings on us. Satisfaction of our requirements in these matters involves no difficulty or loss of authority or dignity for the Persian Government, and moreover, it is not our position vis-d-vis of Persia which we seek to better thereby, but qur position vis-a-vis of foreign Powers. To the strengthening of this latter position Persia should be interested little less than ourselves, for she must surely now see in Great Britain a friendly Power whose [? aim] it is to uphold her. Desiderata which occurred to me are as follows :— 1. Documentary recognition of our prescriptive rights to control lighting, buoying, and policing of Gulf in the same way that our position has been recognised in respect of quarantine, in regard to which the position might with advantage be reaffirmed incidentally. 2. Documentary recognition as a permanency of the old prescriptive postal rights and privileges which [? wel still enjoy, and an expression of readiness to see those extended to other Persian ports of the Persian Gulf as occasion may require. 3. Undertaking to refrain from giving any lease or concession, commercial or otherwise, in Southern and South-Western Persia (i.e., in the area comprising the British and central zones under the Anglo-Russian convention), or in Persian islands of the Gulf, to any foreign subjects or Government, without the knowledge and consent of 27th August, 1908, to the Foreign Office, repeated by me to India on the following day. This perhaps might be secured in the course of current negotiations for mining concessions. 4. Extension of rights of navigation to the Upper Karun. 5. Abandonment of empty claims to sovereignty over Bahrein and recognition of our protective rights over those islands and Trucial Coast and our title to protect their subjects in Persia. 6. Undertaking to grant option to British company when the time is ripe for formation of lighterage company in Gulf ports. 7. Acceptance of consular officer at Bampur when needed. I make no suggestion here in connection with Kishm-Henjam position, as we appear to be effectively consolidating ourselves in an unobtrusive way, and further openings are likely to offer themselves. I have expressed views on the strategical question in my telegram No. 10, dated 3rd January, to India and Tehran. 7~ * (Communicated direct to Foreign Office ; repeated to India and Tehran.)

The Einancial Adviser to the Persian Government has been consulted by the Minister of Pinance as to the possibility of raising funds by cancelling, and selling for a term of years, the Concession held by Moin-ut-Tujjar. The purchase money, which would he divided among the Shah’s entourage, was mentioned by the Minister as being 200,000/. In the opinion of M. Bizot the German Legation originated the suggestion. He wished to know how he should answer the Minister of Einance, and what our interests were. After describing the position to him in outline, I proposed that his answer to the Minister of Einance should he that the Persian Government were debarred from obtaining advances except on the conditions stipulated in Sir C. Spring-Rice’s note of the 31st August, 1907 (see his despatch No. 196 of 1907), and that the transaction is merely an advance in disguise. It is possible that we might succeed in getting the Concession for a British Company, but it would involve the hostility of Moin-ut-Tujjar and the Assembly might call in question later the arbitrary cancellation of his Concession. It would also seem that we had made use of the present political situation for our own advantage. The best solution possibly would be to urge the formation of the Company suggested by Ellinger upon Moin-ut-Tujjar. He would thus be secured from further blackmail and his Concession would be insured to him. [ 29574 ] No. 2. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received August 25.) (No. 279.) (Telegraphic.) P.

I would venture to submit that since you have decided that it is inexpedient to take drastic step of sending a British military expedition to Southern Persia, it is essential for His Majesty’s Government to adopt the only alternative policy in a whole hearted manner. This policy I take to be support of the central and local administrations specially connected with British interests and encouragement to the gendarmerie. I am personally convinced that much can be done to restore order in Pars in a comparatively short space of time, provided that it is realised that without liberal financial support, both of the Governor-General and of the gendarmerie, no progress is possible. The present situation of the country is deplorable, but nowhere more so than in Pars. The tribesmen have got out of the habit of paying taxes, and no one but a^ Governor-General with ample means to meet the requirements of his administration and to maintain strong military force can impose respect for himself and obedience to the laws upon these turbulent peoples. In addition, the knowledge that the Governor-General has the moral and financial support of the British Govern ment will, I feel sure, suffice to cause powerful and jealous tribal chiefs, who complicate the situation so seriously, to rally round him. It is not enough under the present circumstances to put the Governor-General on his feet; he must be maintained by money until he can stand and walk alone, wdien the provincial revenues should be soon sufficient for the repayment of outlays made on his behalf. In regard to the gendarmerie: Colonel-commandant’s engagement expires on 18th August, 1914. Two of his officers’ appointments expire the same day, and seven in December of the same year ; dates of the expiry of the remaining eleven fall due in January and August of the following year. Some of the officers would doubtless like to renew their engagements, but that will depend largely upon the measure of success they meet with during the next eighteen months. It would appear to me premature to institute enquiries as yet as to which officers show a special capacity for the work. As Avas inevitable, mistakes were made at first, but I feel sure that success Avill come. Physique and bearing of the men has Ausibly improved in the last nine months, and the officers will become gradually more versed in handling the Orientals. They are all keen, smart soldiers, determined to make a success of their mission, a spirit Avhieh should eventually ensure the attainment of their object. Force at present numbers about 2,800 men, and its maintenance is a I heavier charge than the impoverished finances of the country can properly bear. | Thanks to the assistance rendered by the Imperial Bank of Persia, all payments due have been made up to date, though there have been unavoidable delays. If the scheme for increasing the gendarmerie force in Pars can be executed, it may not be necessary ' The British consul at Shiraz is of opinion that no good purpose would be served fiy such a formal ceremony of apology as is suggested. He says that the Governor- General at once paid a formal call of condolence, and has frequently expressed himself in terms of unqualified regret, whilst he is anxiously awaiting the moment when^ he can punish the offenders. Meanwhile, he adds that all are co-operating with the object of settling the administrative machinery on a firm basis. I concur in Major O’Connor’s vieAv. I fear that expiatory act w T ould merely serve ! to lower the Governor-General’s prestige, while it might also be accepted as an indication that His Majesty’s Government have decided not to press for further reparation. The British consul at Bushire prefers to reserve his views, since I intimated to him, under your instructions, that it was considered desirable that he should not repeat them to the Government of India for the present. for the Governor-Generals troops to have foreign officers. He would probably prefer Persians. COPV TO INDPVCONFIDENTIAL. 4 ■■ n t W i. , Sir Edward Grey to Sir W. Townley (Tehran). (No. 22.) R.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received January 15, 415 p.m.) . ^ e tei an '1 reasury agent has now reached Shiraz, and has had long and satisfactory conversation with the British consul. He pointed out that, although judicious expenditure of 15,000h advanced by His Majesty’s Government may enable the Governor-General to carry on his administration till the end of the current Persian year, his Excellency will find himself at the commencement' of the new year, namely, towards the end of March, in an even worse position than at present, for this reason’ that he will have created a military force, and will have no funds from which to defray their salaries. The revenues in Persia are collected at the new year, but in Ears they are recovered during the month of April, May, and sometimes June, when the migrating tiibes cross certain points, where they come more or less easily under the influence of the tax-gatherers If he is unable to pay his troops, the Governor-General will have to contend with their complaints which may easily degenerate into disorders, and will have no force upon which he can rely to coerce tribesmen into paying the taxes. The treasury agent estimates the cost of monthly administration at 40,000 tomans (rather less than8,000ZJ, and the British consul is of the opinion that funds to carry on for from four to six months are necessary, although it is calculated that if all goes well it will be possible to recover about 90,000i. in revenue during the coming year. I am urging that cost of the administration must be cut down where possible. Expected improvement in security and prosperity of the province, will not be sufficiently marked in short time at the Governor-General’s disposal for it to be possible to make an arrangement with the imperial bank of Persia, such as is suggested in your telegram No. 704 of last year. I would, however, venture to suggest that it is most essential that the scheme of practical administration now being elaborated should be continued, whilst irreparable injury may be done if the march of progress is checked, if even for a short space of time, by want of funds. I am of opinion that 30,000Z. should suffice to enable the Governor- General to place his administration on a thoroughly sound basis, as he would thus be provided with funds until nearly the end of June. I would beg to submit, for your most favourable consideration, that the above-mentioned sum should be advanced to the Persian Government, on the same conditions as the previous 15,000Z., or that it should be especially set aside for the above purpose out of the next advance.

(Repeated His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, and Consul, Shiraz). , i I tave the honour to offer the following remarks in regard to the present outlook m South Persia. r On the altitudes of the southern roads heavy snow has now fallen and severe weather may as usual he expected to provide period of negative security from organised violence which may last perhaps till end of Pebruary. This period enables us to consider prospects and requirements but I would (?) We have in the south five trade routes for consideration: the Kerman road in the British zone , in the neutial zone, the Bushire, Shiraz, Abwaz, Ispahan and Dizful-Khoramahad routes \ and the Baghdad Kermanshah road outside the neutral zone. Condition of the last among these appears from the latest repoits to be as unsatisfactory as it can be and prospect of any improvement is most unlikely. Por greater part of present year Kerman road has been unsafe for trade caravans which has resulted in great outcry from Indian traders and replacement by merchandise form the North of a considerable proportion of the customary trade with Bunder Abbas. Present conditions offer in| ( the coming year (s)|no prospect of any material improvement and we must expect a further stimulus to trade from North. As regards neutral zone of these routes mentioned the Luristan road offers comparatively new ground and might be developed perhaps if we actively pressed for a scheme and liberally financed it but it w ould be of no material use this year to our trade, and w 7 e could not hope deal successfully with this or any other route or keep it open permanently until we have taken overt measures to secure reparation for the outstanding outrages on the Bushire Shiraz road, such as will act as a deterrent to the tribes on other roads. Recently Mr. Baird has visited ' scene of serious attack on a British officer, and Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, with whom I have discussed question personally is not hopeful as to the prospect next year of this road being kept open, inasmuch as no attempt has yet been made to punish the Kuhgilus who have refused so far to obey Amir Mujahid. As regards Bushire, Shiraz, Ispahan road it is unnecessary for me to dilate on its present condition, as recent events and detailed reports give sufficient evidence on subject. I only need record my conviction that neither the present Governor-General, nor any probable successor, nor the gendarmerie conducted as at present by Swedish Officer is at all likely without armed assistance from us to be able to suppress Rahdari and maintain security on the road even though funds be supplied. At same time we cannot now look to any other Agency hut our own arms ) to secure reparation for attacks on our troops. The omission to obtain this has, if we may accept the reports of local officers and others, served to 1 encourage Kuhgilus and other tribes to believe that they can without fear of reprisals commit outrages on British officers and British subjects. A headman ■—one of the most troublesome but influential on the Shiraz road—remarked recently to a traveller that for eight years he had seen no effective authority and that until he did see it he and his fellows w r ould continue to behave as at present. It may on the other hand be confidently expected that any action winch we may take on one road to secure reparation would react very favour ably on the other routes. I respectfully urge Government, under these cir cumstances, to consider urgently the expediency of preparing for effective action on the Bushire Shiraz road as soon as the fair season is near. These measures should include occupation of Kazerun valley, on the lines which were suggested last spring. If the murder of Eckford is allowed to pass without vigorous overt local action on our part, effect of this(?) added to the effect of previous unavenged outrages will .only he reparable at much greater cost later on, pending which we must he definitely prepared to accept the practically closing of all the trade routes in the south, the withdrawal of British firms from unequal struggle, and the gradual replacement by Russian goods from the north of British merchandise from the south, not to mention grave prejudice to our good name and influence throughout the Gulf and Southern Persia.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To -The Secretary to the Government of India in the foreign Department, Delhi. (Repeated to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran and Consul, Shiraz.) * Please refer to your telegram 59-C. Owing to prevalence of winter conditions and altitude of tract of country involved in any case immediate punitive measures are impossible, either by ourselves or Persian Government. It is quite uncertain according to telegram communicated by Consul, Shiraz, this morning that the raiding party was composed of Boir Ahmadi. Indeed’ our information rather indicates that they were Dushmanziaii or Mamasani tribesmen and as such under influence of Mohamed Ali Khan Kashkulis. He was responsible for the attack on Smart. There are, in my opinion, strong objections to suggested Bakhtiari expedition into Pars. Even if we assume for moment that the Bakhtiari were likely to effect anything, such action on their part would excite the hostility of the Kaskais both against them and ouiselyes. Moreover the remaining sections of the Kuhgulus would certainly join Boir Ahmadi and the last state of the province would he worse probably than the first. The scene of attack I would point out was a spot regarded as within the sphere covered by movements of the Kaskai, whose new Illkhani, Sowdet-ed-Dowleh, would greatly resent intrusion. If any action such as that suggested is to be taken it would certainly be preferable I think that it should be done with assistance of Illkhani and his tribesmen ; he has of late repeatedly protested his desire to rehabilitate himself and earn merit with the Persian Government and ourselves. I am extremely doubtful, however, of the utility to us of any action such as that proposed especially if it involves advance of a considerable sum destined to become later an incubus on the southern revenues. Of a similar situation we have already had experience vis a vis tribes of Luristan following on the attack on Douglas and Lorimer in 1904. In this instance our active associa tion with abortive Persian measures had a worse effect with the tribesmen than if we had held altogether aloof. In this case it would be the same. My opinion is that we should make our preparations to do what is necessary on the road in the spring and should not contemplate participation in any operations at a distance from it. When once we were installed effectively at Kazerun, the Governor General’s hands would be greatly strengthened for organising a Persian expedition to punish the offending tribe, whichever tribe it may eventually prove to be. Moreover when once it was known that is was our definite intention to occupy the road in strength, I am confident we could command the co-operation of the leaders of the Kaskai, passive perhaps at first but as soon as we were installed active. I would venture to submit that I regard the outrage in which Eckford was killed as merely another serious item in our road account and deprecate its being allowed to obscure main question of road. The solution of this question will in itself be by far the best vindication of our good name and the only one worth the candle politically.Telegram No. 14)16, dated the 9th December 1912.

Townlcy to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received January 12, 6‘30 p.m.) Tehran, January 12, 1913. (No. 17.) R. {January 12, 4 p.m.) MY immediately preceding telegram Minister for Foreign Affairs called on me yesterday morning to lay before me a scheme for policing of road from Yezdikhast to Bashire, which has been drawn up by Swedish colonel of the gendarmerie. Plan also provides for creation of flying columns, as it is realised that without the addition of such a mobile force it will be impossible to restore order in Fars. Ala-es-Sultaneh pointed out that season of the year made it impossible to take any effective measures at present against the perpetrators of the Dastarjin outrage, but that such preparations as he is in a position to make are being made by Governor- General to punish offenders, if possible, as soon as weather allows. His Highness added, however, that Persian Government are of opinion that the only manner in which order can be permanently re-established is by scheme formulated by Swedish colonel, which provides for employment of a force of about 1,800 men on road. Of these men he said that a considerable number have already been enlisted, and are undergoing a course of training which should allow of the dispatch of about 1,000 men to the south this spring. It is calculated that the first detachment will be able to start in about a month’s time.^ _ . Want of money, his Highness said, is the great difficulty which besets the Persian Government in the creation of this force which it is estimated will cost about 350,0001. for three years. This period of time has been fixed because it is confidently helieved that, should it be found possible to maintain force in Fars for that time, complete order would be restored in province, which would then be able more than to meet its financial requirements. _ -rr- His Highness, with some natural hesitation, then asked me to approacfi 1 is Majesty’s Government with a view to ascertaining whether they would once more come to Persia’s assistance by advancing this sum of money to be reimbursed out ot the loan which it is hoped will be made shortly. Minister for Foreign Affairs added that not more than hall of sum named would be required immediately, but that scheme could not be carried out unless Persia knew that expenses for three years were guaranteed. He gave me to understand that any conditions that mig t e consi ere necessary to ensure expenditure of money for the purpose intended \rould be accepted, and suggested that it should be placed at the complete disposal of officer commanding gendarmerie through the treasurer-general and entirely allocated to requirements ot P b Am™! opinion that gendarmerie under Swedish officers is the sole force to which we can look for a restoration of order and security on Persian highways. As is not unnatural, thev have not always been successful, but this was to be expected at the outset. On roads where they are already exercising their authority order has been entirely re-established, or a very marked improvement is noticeable. Appeal of Persian Government speaks for itself, and is a confession o eir own ' help themselves.

YOUR telegram No. 1 As was anticipated, a month has elapsed since the attack on British shooting party near Dastarjin, which resulted in the death of Captain Eckford, without the Governor- General of F ars being able to punish offenders as he rashly promised. His Excellency should not, I think, be held to blame for his failure to do so, because task was impossible one within time limit which he set himself at this season of the year. From telegraphic information received from Bushire and Shiraz, it is clear that measures are being undertaken by Governor-General with co-operation of the gendarmerie to prepare such a force as may be able to operate against the suspected offenders in due course. Commander of Governor-General’s military forces has gone with a small force to Kazerun, whence he has proceeded to Borasjun in search of more recruits, having assured himself of the assistance of 200 men at Kazerun and Kamarij respectively under trustworthy leaders. One of the objects of the movement is to secure safety of Bushire road for passage of a consignment of arms and ammunition which two Swedish officers have gone to fetch from Bushire. These arms have been imported from Europe for gendarmerie, and it is only proposed to bring up a half of them at a time. Swedish officers cannot start from Bushire with caravan until a certain number of recruits have been enrolled, and sufficiently drilled to make them a force on which some reliance can be placed in time of an attack on the convoy, and they are also to be trained in handling of Maxims, of which there are two. It would appear probable that it will be a month before the recruits will be ready to take the road. There was some difficulty at first at Bushire about the recruits, but it would seem that good offices of Sir P. Cox have succeeded in smoothing matters over, and that all is going well now. Governor-General is very anxious to obtain possession of arms for the use of force which he is forming, but officer commanding gendarmerie at Shiraz objects, under instructions from here, that they are the property of the gendarmerie and cannot be handed over to anyone outside that force. This contention would appear correct, and yet Governor-General’s efforts will be paralysed if he cannot obtain a portion of the arms, as he has no other source from which to arm his men. It may be possible to effect a compromise. (Addressed to Foreign Office; repeated to Bushire and Shiraz.)0 WIDENTIAL. Sir Edward Grey to Sir W. Townley {Tehran). (No 10.) ^ r0 _ Foreign Office, January 11, .1912, 4 p m. YOuR telegram Y o. ^ ery Confidential, of 3rd 'fanimr}^. . . 1 ^ve been considering what line to adopt in the event of the Persian Government failing to effect the punishment of the tribesmen guilty of Captain Eckford’s murder, with special reference to your recommendation that, in that event, preparation should be made for the despatch of a British punitive expedition to the south of Persia. in my own view, there are objections to this course which outweigh the advantages —though it is important that the Persian Government should not, at this stage, suspect that His Majesty s Government are not contemplating some drastic action. The expedition would have to be sufficiently important to ensure its success. Even in this case it could not fail to suffer considerable losses, and it would entail a very heavy expenditure. With that, however, I am not so much concerned as with the probable result that it would lead to the prolonged or permanent occupation of a large part of the neutral sphere. The pretence of Persian independence would disappear, and partition be directly due to our action. This is a contingency which His Majesty’s Government might one day have to face, but I should strongly oppose such a policy, and it is, in my view, altogether premature to abandon all hope of maintaining, in some form or another, the independence of Persia. A policy more in harmony with our undertakings and interests would be to make renewed endeavour to strengthen the Persian administra tion and to give support and encouragement to the gendarmerie. It is true that it may be some time before the Government authority is strong enough to chastise and keep in order the tribes ; but if we keep this object in view, whether the reckoning come to-day or to-morrow cannot seriously affect our position and prestige. The Governor-General should not be urged to dispatch an expedition until he has had time to prepare it properly, and is himself confident of success. In regard to the gendarmerie, I should be glad to know when the contracts of the Swedish officers expire ; which of them w r e should endeavour to retain ; what chances there are of succeeding, and by what means ; in what ways the gendarmerie’s service could be improved ; whether the opinions given in your despatch No: 261 as to the increase in its numbers is final, and how the increase should be effected. It would seem natural that the Governor-General should wish to have a small force, say, of 1,000 men at his disposal. Would he consent to Swedish officers, and, if so, how many would be required ? I gather also that the gendarmerie are in want of money. Has M. Mornard since supplied the deficiency ? The sum seems comparatively small, and I should have thought that, in view of the great importance of strengthening this body, a special effort would have been made. It would be more satisfactory than to waste money in an ill-equipped expedition. I should also be glad to know your view as to insisting at once on some formal ceremonial act by the Persian Government or by the Governor-General of Shiraz byway of public apology for the outrage. A solemn visit by the Governor-General to the British consul and the officer commanding the British troops, and the salute of the flag might possibly have a good effect in Shiraz and the neighbourhood. I should like to have Major O’Connor’s opinion as to this. To insist upon anything of this kind at Tehran at this moment might be injudicious in view of the political situation, as nothing should be done to make things more difficult for Ala-es-Sultaneh. If a measure of this kind were not considered sufficient, and if the new Persian Government, when formed, does not seem capable of gov erning', and is unworthy of TETmaght' bq ^k^B.' &lt;w|l^ch might be more useful 17 JAM 1913 j SECRETARY'S N2 support, there are other measures wl I 151 203and less enxWaB.ing t, a t an^pedWon THsCeBt^n ha S P often been mooted, and was last discussed by an inter-departmental^ ibis question nas o j in conn ection with the deposit of coal on Henjan. committee in 1907 an Efficiently near to the scene of the outrage troops might Should Bunder Abbas not be ^imcie^ j the firgt matanc&amp; ThSaee h s tl been o^upfed troops and is said to be healthy.

[556091 Sir W. Townlev to Sir Edward Grey.-—(Received December 30.) (No. 263.) Sir, Tehran, December 18, 1912. IN continuation of my despatch No. 259 of the 16th instant upon the subject of the attack on a British shooting party near- Khaneh Zinian on the Shiraz-Bushire road, which unfortunately resulted in the death of Captain Eckford, I have the honour to transmit herewith copies of further correspondence. Late last night I received the note from the Persian Government, of which a translation is enclosed, together with a summary in English, copy also enclosed, of a telegraphic conversation which had taken place between the Governor-General of Ears and the Minister of Foreign Alfairs and of the Interior. It will be seen from the translation of the note that it contains nothing more than a summary of the telegraphic conversation which relates to the steps which are to be taken to endeavour to obtain reparation for the outrage. The proposed measures are very thorough, and would have every chance of success, but for the fact that the season is most unfavourable for military movements in the mountains, and for the even more serious fact that it is extremely doubtful if the loyal co-operation of the parties whose assistance has been invoked can be relied upon. It is, I think, greatly to Mukhber-es- Sultaneh’s credit that he should have lost no time in preparing a punitive expedition, and in urging the Central Government to move the Bakhtiaris to come to his assistance by operating against the suspected tribe from the side of Behbehan. His Excellency would appear to me over sanguine in hazarding a belief that he can obtain reparation for the last outrage, as also for the attack on Mr. Smart nearly a year ago, within one month. I am very sceptical as to the capability of the Persian authorities to punish the guilty parties within any period of time, and certainly not under from three to four months. _ . . ‘ . Since Mukhber-es-Sultaneh shows such a praiseworthy determination to obtain reparation, it would appear to me but fair to give him a chance to do so within a reasonable space of time—say, four months. Should his Excellency succeed, it will be known that the punitive measures were taken to satisfy British requirements, and oui honour would be saved, whilst a successful expedition of the sort would establish Mukhber-es-Sultaneh as a powerful governor, and would go far to re-establish peace and order in the province. His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz is strongly in favour o givmg Mukhber-es-Sultaneh a fair chance. In this contention I agree with him, although o not share his opinion that the recent incident has not changed the situation, or that we can afford to give the Governor-General time to form a force that it won ta e a year or so to make competent to assume the duties it is intended that it should perform, i do not think that the British good name in Southern Persian can atlord to wait lor an indefinite period for reparation for this fresh outrage. . ^ ^ r j-r I concur with the view expressed by Sir Percy Cox m his telegram of the 15th December to the Government of India, that the unfortunate murder of Captain Eckford should not be allowed to obscure our vision of the general question of the solution of the trade-routes problem. What has occurred, is but one more m ^ m a ong chain of evidence which proves the incapacity of the Persian aut on les to pro ec le lives and property of foreigners. Since our trade is more m eres e m e is nc concerned than that of any other country, so, it would seem to me, i is oui specia u y not only to seek reparation for the outrage perpetrated on Bntisi so lers, u o secur the establishment of law and order on the road. -in + Major O’Connor, in his arguments in favour of according another chance to t ( Persian provincial authorities, calls attention to the fact that u er ’f S U ^ ^ ’ before this unfortunate incident occurred, elaborated a eme OT military force. He advocates that to ensure the efficiency of such a force one foreign officer at least would be required, and he lets it be un eis oo ^ i opinion such an officer should be British. S r ^ ve m rn -^ ^i a scheme would be that it would entail two semi-military orces a on ’ under Swedish officers, the other under one or more Britis o ceis. ie e General would naturally favour his own corps, and endeavour to secure or i [2729 gg-1] COPY TO 10 JAN 19132 desirable recruits. The result would inevitably be great friction and jealousy between the foreign officers, whilst the Governor-General would be accused of obstructing the one in favour of the other. I am of opinion that it would be extremely difficult to make the two schemes work smoothly together as long as the gendarmerie is maintained. I should add that the recent incident would appear to have given some reason lor hop&lt;£ that the gendarmerie with a little more time and a little more experience may prove a force of no small value. _ ..... Major O’Connor has also expressed an opinion that the financial administration of the province would work more satisfactorily were the financial agent an Englishman instead of a Belgian, since he entertains the belief that the Governor-General would be more ready to co-operate with and take the advice of a man of the former rather than of the latter nationality. Here again I regret to be unable to agree with Major O’Connor. It appears to me that as long as the Belgian financial administration established with the approval of the British and Bussian Governments is maintained, it is essential that the treasurer-general should be able to employ his own officials, in whom he has confidence. I am very doubtful as to whether Mukhber-es-Sultaneh would accept with a very good grace the interference of anyone, Persian or foreign, in the financial administration of the province, and when M. Lecoffre was proposed lor the post, his Excellency declared that he would sooner never proceed to Shiraz than have him as financial agent. Ala-es-Sultaneh called upon me this morning to ask me whether 1 was yet in possession of your views, Sir, as to the attitude His Majesty’s Government should adopt in consequence of the recent regrettable incident. I gathered that the Persian Government are very nervous lest His Majesty’s Government may decide on taking immediate steps to obtain the reparation they may doubt the capacity of the Persian Government to accord. The Minister detailed all the measures the Governor-General was preparing to take, as set forth above, and expressed an earnest hope that His Majesty’s Government would grant a reasonable delay, in order to allow Mukhber-es- Sultaneh to carry out his punitive sel l erne, in the success of which his Highness expressed his fullest confidence. He added that the Persian Minister in London would be instructed to express the readiness of the Persian Government to make a suitable monetary compensation, and that he would consult you as to what would be considered a fitting sum. The Minister had also been instructed to express to Captain Eckford’s family the deep regret of the Persian Government for what had happened. I replied that I felt sure that you would much appreciate this spontaneous suggestion on the part of the Persian Government to make a monetary compensation. Turning to the previous question, I s;dd that I was not yet in possession of your views beyond those expressed in the note I had addressed to him under your instructions. Speaking quite personally, I thought it probable, I continued, that His Majesty’s Government might find themselves obliged to take the question of punishment into their own hands unless the local authorities could ofier full reparation within a reasonable limit of time. I added that it was in my opinion most unlikely that Mukhber-es-Sultaneh would be able to do this in a month, as he appeared to anticipate, and I added that I thought the Government would be ill-advised if they urged him to take too precipitate action, as this would merely mean courting disaster. The Minister for Foreign Affairs at once replied that should the punitive measures about to be undertaken fail, and the Persian Government find themselves unable to accord reparation within a reasonable space of time, he would be the first to welcome independent British action. I said that, if such were the feeling of the Persian Government, and if, should the necessity for British action arise, such action could be taken in accord with the Persian Government, it would in my personal opinion greatly simplify the question. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Ala-es-Sultaneh to Sir W. Townleu. (Translation.) Your Excellency, December 17, 1912. IN continuation of my letter of the 4th instant (14th December, 1912), regarding the regrettable incident of Captain Eckford, I have the honour to inform your Excellency that on the 6th instant (16th December) I and the Minister of theInterior had a telegraphic conversation with the Governor-General of Fars with a view to urging the execution of the orders which had been issued for the appre hension and punishment of the culprits. The Governor-General of Fars states that ^^for the piesent 300 men of the Government riflemen of the .town (Shiraz) and of those along the load ha\e been sent m pursuit of the miscreants. Orders have also been issued to all the Government servants of those districts, and the Governor-General has drawn up a comprehensive plan for raising an army and surrounding the robbers, which plan the British consul has approved. From here (Tehran) ^ also urgent telegraphic instructions have been sent to the Governors of Behbehan and Ispahan to dispatch cavalry and forces from both these places with a view to surrounding and thoroughly punishing the bandits. According to the hope expressed by the Governor- - General of Fars, within a month the punishment of the culprits, both of the incident of Mr. Smart and also of this last incident, will be effected. The Governor-General is waiting for the arrival at Shiraz of the guns and rifles which have reached Bus hire. Captain Noren Brandel has left Shiraz to bring these up from Rushire. When his armaments have been thus completed the Governor-General will be able to set this expediiion in motion. With these preparations, which have been devised and which will be quickly effected, I have the greatest hope that full reparation for this deplorable incident will be obtained. I avail, &amp;c. ALA-ES-SULTANEH. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Precis of Mukhber-es-Sultaneh’s Replies in Telegraphic Conversation with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and of the Interior, December 16, 1912. MB. SMABT can bear testimony to the fact that on my arrival at Shiraz the town was practically besieged and the roads closed ; now they are open to traffic, and caravans pass daily to anf from Bushire. After a spell of forty days’ complete calm, and the establishment of a gendarmerie post at Kazeroon, some British officers expressed the intention of starting on a shooting expedition ; owing to the prevailing security I had no reason to offer any objection. I, however, suggested that a force should accompany them, but they refused on the ground of their own escort being sufficient. What happened afterwards was a pure accident due to the officer detaching himself from the main body and advancing too far; no harm came to the officer who remained behind with the sowars. The consul and the colonel themselves do not attribute this incident to any lack of security on the road, but merely to an unfortunate and unforeseen accident. I have not neglected any of my duties as Governor-General, and am taking the most stringent measures, but these steps can only be productive of a satisfactory result if carried out according to a well-concerted plan of action. It is not yet clearly established that we have had io deal with Boir Ahmedis exclusively ; the base of operations must be at Kazeroon. I am devoting all my attention to the immediate transport of arms and ammunition lying at Bushire ; I have sent instructions to all the local authorities, and am busy collecting riflemen that can be depended upon. I am holding a council to-day to study the situation. This is not a matter that can be rushed through. I have spoken with the consul, and he is in perfect agreement with j my plan of campaign. We shall require a month to collect the^ necessary force here and at Behbehan, and to put them in the field in accordance with a definite scheme of operations. I hope that within that period of time adequate reparation for the Smart affair and this last accident will be forthcoming. This last incident is one of fiequent i occurrence in other parts of the world. Immediately upon receiving news of it tiom the consul, who has the telephone, I sent horsemen to pursue the brigands. I expressed my regrets in writing, and called the next morning to do so in peison. I he consul admitted that in the present state of the country it was impossible to expect that the unrest of forty days ago should suddenly yield place to a new order of things wherein no plundering and attacks could take place. In a province in which ^ ie inhabitants are wild and lawless tribesmen no one can deny that wonders have a rea y been achieved, and at tbe present rate we shall soon reach a period of complete calm and tranquillity. According to a report just received it is now certain that the robbeis ^ eie Boir Ahmedis, and that they have gone towards Dushmanziari. One of them has 3een killed there, but I have not yet received the report of the local kalantar.

He proposes, therefore, unless forced into unwilling action by insistence of his own Government, to continue methodical preparations for organisation of small but competent force on lines ahea«ly indicated in my previous telegrams-that is to say, enlistment of about 10W picked men, whom he hopes to have armed and ready for active operations in a » ''° Thisls his general scheme, and if it at all meets with your approval I ventuie with the greatest possible respect to urge that it may at least be given a t His Maiesty’s Government decide to resort to more strenuous methods.

Regarding part taken by gendarmes in the fight, I ^ have now received the following particulars from Captain Lundberg, who has himself been out to the scene of action to make enquiries. He confirms Major Kettlewell s report, but says that, m addition to the three gendarmes who went on ahead in the morning and those who afterwards came out of Rurj on the Sineh Safid, there were some others who form the daily road patrol from Khaneh Zinian. These latter took up a position on hillock on north bank of river, whence they fired at robbers, and four of the former were wounded. Some of them apparently followed the robbers for some distance, and returned in the evening; but there was nothing in the nature of cavalry engagement. Major Siefvert estimates number of gendarmes engaged at about twenty altogether. I may add that gendarmes appear to have behaved very well, and to have done all they possibly could to assist Major Kettlewell’s party and to drive off robbers. o[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.!

WITH reference to my immediately preceding despatch of to-day’s date upon the subject of the recent occurrence in the neighbourhood of Shiraz, I have the honour to transmit herewith paraphrases of two telegrams which I have received from His Majesty’s resident and consul-general at Bushire, and of one from His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz, dealing more especially with the general situation than the special incident, and expressing their views as to the nature of the action that should be taken. Sir P. Cox in his first telegram reviews the present state of the southern trade routes in no very glowing colours, but I must own that but slight justification exists for depicting them in less sombre hues. The only route about which he finds something relatively good to say is that from Mohammerah to Khoremabad, and that would probably prove the worst of all were the traffic on it of sufficient value and importance to excite the cupidity of the Lur tribes who are accepted in Tehran as being more out of control than any of the many lawless peoples in Persia. There had been some reason to hope for real improvement on the Ispahan—Ahwaz road until the recent attack upon Lieutenant Bullock gave the lie to our expectations. This might have been classed as an untoward accident had not Sir P. Cox ascertained from Captain Grey, His Majesty s vice-consul at Ahwaz, that he has small hope of the arrangement recently made with the Bakhtiari khans bearing good fruit. This expression of opinion, I should add, does not tally with the eulogistic report of the able manner in which Sardar Jang had set about the administration of the road which the same officer supplied to me, and which I had the honour to communicate to you in my despatch No. 156 of the 6th August. _ . . It is just possible that 'with time and money, it available, Amir Mufakham n ^ a y do something to restore a measure of order on the Bunder Abbas—Kerman road, but the recent unfortunate incident that is occupying our immediate attention has seived to emphasise the fact that there is not much chance of safety for goods and travellers being established on the most important road of all—the Bushire-Shiraz road-—unless more determined and energetic measures can be taken than can be expecte 10 m tie Persian Government in its present enfeebled condition. The tone o in ^ i er es Sultan eh in his official report of the Dashtarjin incident which accompanies my despatch under reference is almost despairing where he speaks of a country infested by brigands, robbers, and cannibals. The colonel of the gendarmerie expresses conti ence tia • e force being formed here to operate later on at Shiraz will be a e o res ore ok er, but that force is only half formed at the present moment, and already the financial demands on the Treasury on behalf of the gendarmerie are so great that M. Mornatd is quite unable to meet them from a chest that is practically empty. _ Sir P. Cox’s second telegram is one that he has sent to India m answer to a request for an expression of his opinion upon a suggestion made to t e ecre,ary o a e or India by you, Sir, that an expedition of Bakhtiaris should be fitted out, if necessary under British officers, to punish the guilty tribe. I agree wi every wor a Sir P. Cox says. I am sure that the Bakhtiari, who have proved themselves equal to defeating wretched material in the north, would not be capa e o compe mg \m u a powerful tribe as the Kashgai, which would almost certain y e oun 011 16 e . the Boir Ahmadi, or whoever the guilty people may be, were an effort made to use the Bakhtiari for punitive purposes in a part of the country w ere rey lave no g &gt; against tribes who are already bitterly jealous of the po i ica supiema y T acquired at Tehran. Such a movement would set tribe against tribe with, m my op ^^ajor^aConnor’s review of the situation is an able and carefuliy thought out document, but I think he somewhat misses the points at issue m a laudable atte p show that the situation affords some hopes of improvemen , i an e manner. I concur with Sir P. Cox's admonition that no effort must be spared to dispel [2729 dd -2] B COPY TO [' !A 10 JAN 1913 22 a belief that any measures which His Majesty’s Government may judge fit to take are due to the special incident that resulted in the death of Captain Eckford. Major Cf Connor shows that since the attack on Mr. Smart numerous incidents have occurred, each one of which would have been as serious as the recent one had death unfortunately resulted His remedy is a still closer control of the finances of the province by an English'financial agent, and the creation of a military force under foreign officers, and he himself looks upon such arrangements in the nature of forlorn hopes. I think he somewhat misunderstands Mukhber-es-Sultaneh m thinking that he would submit to closer financial control under an English financial agent His Excellency now nrofesses distrust of the Belgians, because the financial agent happens to be of that Stnal ty but when M. LecSfre was proposed Mukhber-es-Sultaneh declared that he would not ake up the appointment as Governor-General if he were sent. Moreover to introduce an Englishman ignorant of Belgian methods into M Mornard s administration would be tantamount to taking over the financial administration of Ears, which would not be compatible with the existing arrangement, which has received the sanction of the British and Russian Governments. . u n + + -i • To establish a military force under foreign officers would be to set up something that would be at variance with the gendarmerie. If the officers were Swedes there would be no difference from the existing gendarmerie force, but it would still mean two military organisations in one place. If the officers were British there would be undesirable emulation between the officers of different nationalities, and much professional iealousy would inevitably be engendered. For the reasons that I have endeavoured to explain above, I am decided y of opinion that the moment has now come when some expedition which would entail the military occupation of the valley of Kazerun and the control of the road, such as has been sketched bv Sir P. Cox, should be seriously taken into consideration. I am con vinced that such a step, however distasteful it might appear at first sight to the Persian Government, would serve to strengthen the Governor-General’s hand m such a manner as would enable him to cope with the situation eventually, with the assistance oi the gendarmerie. The British occupationwould have to be of some duration, but there is no reason, I think, why the country should not be handed back to the Persian administration when it is clear that order has been re-established, and that there is a sufficient military force present to ensure against a relapse. . . ., Finally, I am of opinion that the moment has come when any hesitation to uphold British dignity will seriously endanger Our good name throughout Persia. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to Sir W . Townley. (Telegraphic.) P. Bushire, December 14, 1912. DASTARJIN incident. I venture to submit following observations on situation now created :— A spell of negative security from organised violence may be expected to ensue on the heavy snowfalls that have now occurred on the higher altitudes of the southern roads and the severity of the winter in these parts. We have this period, which will last probably until the end of February, in which to consider the action that it may be necessary to take in the spring. . n • • v. There are five trade routes to consider in the south : Kerman road (in British sphere), Bushire-Shiraz, Ahwaz-Ispahan, Dizful-Khoremabad routes 'in the neutral sphere), and Kermanshah-Bagdad road. The condition on this latter road appears from latest reports to be as unsatisfactory as possible, and no improvement seems likely to take place on it. ( Throughout the greater part of the current year the Kerman road has been unsate for trade caravans. Indian traders have been loud in their complaints, and merchandise from the north has replaced a considerable proportion of the usual trade with -^ un l* e lj Abbas. No prospect of any material improvement in the coming year can be looke for out of the present conditions, and we must expect a further stimulus to trade from the north.ion, 1 1 ® fctotWis the k With regard to the three roads in the neutral zone, comparatively new ground is opened by the Luiistan route. Ihis route might perhaps be developed if a scheme were actively pressed and liberally financed by us, but our trade would not benefit materially by it this year, and there is little hope that we could exploit this or any other route ^iccessfully, or keep it open permanently, unless such overt measures are taken to avenge outstanding outrages on the Bushire-Shiraz road as will act as a deterrent to tribes on other routes. A serious attack on a British officer has recently taken place on the Bakhtiari road, and the vice-consul at Ahwaz, with whom I have discussed the question, does not think that the prospects of the road being kept open for traffic next spring are at all hopeful. Kuhgilui have up till now refused to obey Amir Mujahid, and no attempt has been made to punish them. I need not comment on present state of Bushire—Shiraz—Ispahan road ; recent events and detailed reports speak for themselves. I would only state my conviction that neither Mukhber-es-Sultaneh nor any probable Governor-General, nor the gendarmerie as the Swedish officers conduct it at, present, has any hope, without armed assistance from us, of abolishing the levy of “rahdari” or of restoring securitv on the road, even tnough the funds are forthcoming. 1 do not think, either, that we can look now to any other agency but our own arms to avenge the attacks on our troops. Reports of local officers and others show that our omission to secure reparation has served to foster the belief among the Kuhgilui and other tribes that they can perpetrate outrages on British officers and British subjects without fearing any retribution. A short while ago one of the most troublesome and influential chiefs on the Bushire-Shiraz road stated to a traveller that for eight years he had seen no effective authority, and that until he did he and his tribesmen would not mend their ways. On the other hand, we may confidently expect, were we to take action to secure reparation on one road, a change for the better on other routes. In view of these considerations I would respectfully urge Government to consider the pressing need of preparing to. take effective measures on the Bushire-Shiraz road at the beginning of the spi ing—such measures to include the occupation of the Kazerun valley, as proposed last spring. To allow the death of Captain Eckford to pass without overt and vigorous local action on our part will be to make the situation, aggravated by previous unavenged outrages, reparable only at a much greater cost later on ; while in the meanwhile we must resign ourselves to seeing all southern trade routes practically closed, British firms withdrawing from the unequal struggle, and British merchandise from the south being gradually replaced by Russian goods from the north, to say nothing of the serious prejudice which will ensue to our influence and good name throughout Southern Persia and the Gulf region.

PREVAILING winter conditions and altitude of tract of country in question render it impossible either for the Persian Government or for ourselves to take any immediate punitive measures. Telegram of the 15th December from His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz shows that it is by no means sure that the robber band was composed of Boir Ahmac is. Reports rather tend to show that they were Mamaseni or Dashmanziari tribesmen. These latter are subject to the influence of Mahomed Ali Khan Kashkuh, who was responsible for the attack on Mr. Smart and his escort. . . I would submit that there are strong objections to a Bakhtiari expedition in ^° a j^ s as suggested. Such action, even supposing for a moment that the Bakhtiari would be likely to do anything, would arouse the enmity of the Kashgai both agams t e Bakhtiari and ourselves. Furthermore, remaining subdivisions of the Ku gi ui ' vvou certainly throw in their lot with the Boir Ahmadi, and the state of the province wou only be rendered worse than before. The scene of the outrage is, moreover, a spo considered as within the region covered by the movements of the Kashgai. y? ou e ' e Dowleh, the new ilkhaui, would greatly resent the presence of Bakhtian m t is region. [2729 dd—2'] B 2T think that, if action on the lines suggested is to be taken it would be more politic that'it should be done in concert with Soulet-ed-Dowleh and the Kashgai. Soulet has fre raently of late expressed his desire to rehabilitate himself and regain our favour and that of the Persian Government. The utility to us of any action of this sort, especial^ if it entails advance of a considerable sum of money which later on w, 1 go to burdeT the southern revenues, appears to me to be extremely doubtful. &gt; the case of the tribes of Luristan, following on the attack of Douglas and Lonmer in 1904, our action coupled with abortive Persian measures, had a worse effect locally than if we had held aloof entirely. The same would be the case here. . In these circumstances I would urge that we should be prepared to take action on the road in the spring, and not contemplate participation m any operations in the present season. Effective occupation of Kazerun by our troops would greatly facilitate Mukhber-es-Sultaneh’s task of organising a Pers.an expedition to punish the offending tribe whichever it may turn out to be. I am also confident that when once it became known that we had resolved to occupy the road in strength, we could command the co-operation, passive at first, perhaps, but active as soon as we were installed at Kazerun of the Kashgai headmen. i? rt i a In conclusion, I would state that I consider the murder of Captain Eckford as merely another item in our road account. It should not I think, be allowed to over shadow the main consideration of the road problem, the solution of which w, I by itself, be by far the best vindication of our prestige, and the only one of political utility.

YOUR telegram No. 172. Question of retribution to be exacted from tribe responsible for attack on Mai or Kettlewell and party. # , As mentioned in my telegram No. 202, this attack was not apparently deliberately aimed at our officers and sowars, but was made by ordinary marauding band with object ^ It appears to me. therefore, that this last attack in no way alters the general political situation in Southern Persia, and does not necessarily call for any change of policy on the part of His Majesty’s Government. If His Majesty’s Government did not consider it necessary themselves to exact retribution for deliberate and sustained attack on one of their consular officers and his escort, resulting in some loss of life and wounding of consul, or for any of the subsequent attacks made on their officers, this last attack presents no features of special atrocity wiiich would necessitate a change of policy now. Death of Captain Eckford, of course, gives this last outrage a tragic significance which, fortunately, does not attach to previous assaults. But this was merely an unfortunate chance which might just as well have happened in the case of other officers who were attacked from time to time. I am therefore of opinion, unless His Majesty’s Government think it desirable now, in view of repeated outrages and of the' generally disturbed condition ol Southern Persia, to send an expedition into the country to restore order, there is no reason why this last assault should per se necessitate their doing so. As I understand their policy it is to maintain the existing form of Government as long as possible, and with this object in view you have secured appointment to Ears of the best Persian governor obtainable, and His Majesty’s Government are financing and otherwise supporting him in his difficult task of trying to restore order in his province. Experiment is m nature of forlorn hope, but if His Majesty’s Government wish to persevere in their policy I know no special reason why they should now depart from it. But, .as the question has been raised, I venture very respectfully to invite your attention to the broad facts of the case as they present themselves to me. it 18 notorious that the whole of this part of Persia is virtually closed, and has for some time been in a state of anarchy, which tends to increase rather than to diminish as time goes on. In order to restore order and to protect their interests and subjects, * 1 Majesty’s Government are actually financing the Governor of Ears, and are retaining a•s (audios more or less effective control of the money which they have lent him. In view of these circumstances it seems to me clear that His Majesty’s Government have undertaken very definite responsibilities in Southern Persia, and that if they now desire to make ^ their present policy a success, to restore order under a Persian governor, and eventually to withdraw their cavalry regiment, without being obliged to send a large expedition into the countrythey must be prepared to face the necessity of adopting an even more definite and decided line of policy than that which they are now pursuing. I refer to more effective control of finances and of the military force which, as I have already reported, the Governor-General proposes to raise. As indicated in my telegram No. 198, I am of opinion method proposed by you in your telegram No. 171 for control of the 15,000Z. lent to the Persian Government for use in Pars is not likely to prove effective. Consul’s control over expenditure once the money has actually passed into the hands of Pars administration can only be nominal. Whatever budgets or projects the Governor-General may produce we have no security that funds will not be maladministered. The only person who can really control expenditure is the financial agent, and what I hear of Stas’ character and past record does not inspire me with much confidence; and I have already reported to you Governor-General’s dislike and distrust of all Belgians. Secondly, as to the possibility of Governor-General raising an adequate military force. Upon this I think the whole problem depends, for without force he is helpless. I believe, given the money, a force, and a good force, can be raised, but I do not believe this can be done by Persians alone. Governor-General himself, I think, has doubts on the subject, for in replying to my question as to qualities of his Persian officers, he hinted that he might find it necessary to ask for one of the Swedish or British officers here to supervise the new organisation. My opinion therefore is this, that in order to prevent 15,000L and other revenues from being wasted, and in order to organise suitable native force to restore order in Pars, we must utilise the services of at least two Englishmen, one as treasury agent, to act as superintendent and controller of provincial finances, and the other as inspecting officer of local forces. It is, I think, essential that Englishmen should be employed, for I do not think that, in the peculiar circumstances of the case, subjects of any other Power are suitable for these tasks. I believe question of Englishmen, as suggested, might conceivably enable the Governor-General to restore order in his province. If this last expedient fails, it will be time to consider what other measures are necessitated by the exigencies of the situation.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] M PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [December 27.j Section 1. [55262] Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey—(Received December 27.) (No. 258.) Sir, Tehran, December 16, 1912. WITH reference to the recent telegraphic correspondence that has passed upon the subject of the deplorable incident which occurred near Dashtarjin, on the Shiraz-Bushire road, on the 11th instant, I have the honour to transmit copies of certain correspondence to which allusion has been made in the above-mentioned exchange of telegrams, but which it seemed to me unnecessary to submit to you telegraphically. 1 received the news of the disastrous encounter which resulted in the death of Captain Eckford. about 7 o’clock in the evening of the 11th instant, when I had just returned from calling upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his usual reception day. I at once sent Mr. Smart to the private residence of Ala-es-Sultaneh to communicate to His Highness the news. The Minister was greatly distressed, and requested Mr. Smart to ask me to convey to you his profound regret at what occurred. He expressed grave concern about the impression that the news might create in London, coming as it did so soon on the report of the murder of the Belgian customs official on the Turco-Persian frontier, but he expressed confidence in the tried forbearance and proved friendship of His Majesty’s Government not to resolve upon any action until all the facts of the case had been ascertained and the matter fully considered. The following morning Ala-es-Sultaneh called upon me in person and expressed, in his own name and that of the Persian Government, the deep regret at the unfortunate incident which had resulted in the loss of life of a British officer at a moment when the Government had commenced to entertain genuine hopes that a new era of improvement was about to dawn in the province of Fars. His Highness assured me that no effort would be spared to trace and punish the criminals guilty of this fresh outrage, and again repeated his earnest hope that His Majesty’s Government would once more be patient and give the Persian Government time to carry out the punitive measures called for by the occasion. I thanked the Minister for his expression of regret that he had made in the name of the Persian Government, and said that I would not fail to convey to you, bir, what he had said as to His Majesty’s Government giving the Persian Government time to carry out the necessary punitive measures. I pointed out to His Highness that the incident was such a serious one that it was impossible for me to foretell what action His Majesty’s Government would consider it necessary to take, and I reminded him that this fresh incident v 7 as only one more in a long chain of incidents, some of which had not been reported to the P*ersian Government, which served to show that the authorities in Fars are unable to protect the lives and property of foreigners. I added that I was convinced that, even though His Majesty’s Government might feel themselves constrained to take energetic action on the spot, no effort would be spared to maintain the traditional friendly attitude of the British Government towards that of^ Persia. I subsequently addressed a note, of which a copy is enclosed, to the Persian Government reporting on the affair. . , Upon the receipt of your telegram No. 726 of the 12th instant I addressed a further note (copy enclosed) to the Persian Government, and the following day- received a reply from Ala-es-Sultaneh (of which I have the honour to encode translation). The note merely summarises the telegraphic report of the inci ent received from the Governor-General, which forms a subsequent enclosure in is despatch, and states that a further communication will be sent me giving the nature o the reparation that the Persian Government are prepared to make. ± a An examination of the report made by Mukhber-es-Sultaneh will show r t a i oes not differ in any material respect from the reports furnished by His Majesty s consul at Shiraz (which I have had the honour to submit telegraphically). It is not yet quite clear from the Governor-General’s report about the presence of a caravan, or w e er by the use of the word “ earavane” the baggage train of the shooting party is 1U # U 1 ® • Mukhber-es-Sultaneh speaks of a small caravan, as if it were at one momen wi e advanced party of Persian soldiers and gendarmes that had no connec ion wi [2729 da—1] Bthe British party, at another mixed up with the latter Major Kettle well reports that he had no knowledge of any caravan on the road at the time, and yet it is clear from Maior O’Connor’s telegram No. 202 of the 14th instant that there was a caravan on the snot although reports differ as to its size. It would in an&gt;. case appear clear that the British part; was not acting as an escort to a caravan, and that if it was being escorted*. ■ at all it was more likely to have been accompanying the considerable Persian force that appears to have been only quite a short distance ahead of the British party. The robbers would seem to have allowed this force to pass unmolested, and to have attacked the British party as soon as their mules emerged into the open from the scrub. It does not transpire from Major O’Connor’s report of what occurred that Captain Eckford was killed by the first volley fired by the bandits, although it is so stated in the Governor-General’s report, which Is also inaccurate as to the casualties among the gendarmes. Latest information shows that none were killed but that fimr were wounded. Presumably the gendarmes, who were a short distance m front of the British party with the hundred Persian soldiers, returned to their assistance when they heard the firing, since Mukhber-es-Sultaneh asserts that the combat lasted for five hoars and was only stopped by nightfall, and that all the mules that had been carried off, but three were recovered and twelve Boir Ahmedis killed. The colonel of the gendarmerie has also received information from the commanding o ccr at 3 rfiZ w would seem to show that the gendarmes took part in the encounter since he reports that the Persian foot soldiers ran away immediately they heard the bring. Copies ol two letters received from Colonel Hialmarson, forwarding abstracts of telegrams from Maior Siefvert at Shiraz, are also enclosed. ,, It will be seen that the Governor-General states decidedly that the robbers were Boir Ahmedis, and that he has sent an expedition in pursuit. He also suggests t at the Governor of Behbehan, a Bakhtiari, should be instructed to operate against the tribe on the western side of the mountains. The Assistant Foreign Minister who handed me Mukhber-es-Saltaneh’s report on the loth instant, informed me that orders had been sent to the Governor of Behbehan and to the Bakntiari leadei s, Sardar Jang and Morteza Kuli Khan, who are now at Malanir, to co-operate against the guilty tribe, and the Persian Government are confident that the punitive measures that are being taken will result in the practical annihilation of the Boir Ahmedis, who are constant source of trouble on the trade routes between Ispahan, Yezd, and Kazerun. I expressed great satisfaction that such energetic measures were being taken, but pointed out that the season of the year made it extremely difficult for such operations as those described to be taken, and added that, in my opinion, hwrk only the actual culprits must be punished, but also the village headmen on-the road, who were almost equally guilty in that they must have been aware of the presence of such a large marauding force in the immediate neighbourhood, and had not given notice to the local authorities. I am reserving my appreciations upon the general situation for a subsequent despatch, and need only add that, although I am firmly convinced that the Persian Government are sincerely desirous of according the British Government full and adequate reparation for the outrage, they are quite unable to do so. Theoretically a combined movement of Bakhtiaris on the west with the Government forces of of Shiraz on the east should suffice, but such a movement will never be made. The Bakhtiaris will at once demand a large sum of money to enable them to undertake military operations. This money will not be forthcoming, and even if it were it is most improbable that the Bakhtiaris would dare undertake a movement which might bring them into collision with the more powerful Kashgai tribe, members of which were almost certainly implicated with the Boir Ahmedis or other tribes that formed the robber band.

Deputy governor has asked British consul whether expenses incurred on account of punitive measures being prepared cannot be defrayed out of the 15,000h advanced bv Hit. Majesty s Government. Consul has replied that money was especially advanced io! administration, and that he deprecated its use for special purposes, and suggests that 1 ersian Government be pressed to provide necessary funds from'which money could be drawn. J As the Treasury is completely empty, it would be very hard to get any money for the purpose from Central Government. Suggestion to do so would certainly call forth a reply that part of the 15,000h could well be employed for the purpose, and a refusal to agree to such a course would lead to a delay in the carrying out of the operations. As some show of an attempt to punish robbers is in my opinion most desirable, I wouki beg to suggest that some money should be given as soon as we know estimated cost of expedition, although it is probable that money will be wasted.

In my [group undecypherable : ? opinion], there are strong objections to suggested Bakhtiari expedition into Pars. Even supposing for a moment that the Bakhtiari were likely to effect anything, such action would° excite hostility o± the Kaskeis both against Bakhtiari and ourselves, and, moreover, remaining sections of the Kuhgeluis would certainly join Boir Ahmedi, and the last state of the province would probably be worse than the first. I would point out that the scene of the attack was a spot regarded [ ? ] as within the sphere covered by movements of the [name undecypherable], whose new ilkhani, boulet-ed-Dowleh, would greatly resent intrusion of Bakhtiari. If any action of the und suggested is to be taken it would be greatly preferable, in my opinion, that it should be done with assistance of ilkhani and his tribesmen. He has made repeated piotestations of late of his desire to rehabilitate himself and earn merit with ourselves and the Persian Government. I am extremely sceptical, however, of the utility to us of any action of the nature proposed, especially if it involves advance of a considerable dole of money, destined later to become incubus on the southern revenues. We have already had experience of a similar situation vis-d-vis of tribes of Luristan following on attack on Douglas and Lorimer in 1904, in which instance our action, associated with abortive Persian measures, had a worse effect amongst tribesmen than if we had held aloof altogether. It would be the same in this case. My view would be that we should make our preparations to do what is necessary on the road in the spring, and not contemplate participation in any operations at a distance from it. Once [? we] were effectively installed at Kazerun the hands of the Governor-General would be greatly strengthened for organising a Persian expedition to punish offending tribe, whichever it may be proved to be. Moreover, once it was known that we definitely intended to occupy road in strength, I am confident that we could command co-operation of the Kaskei leaders—passive, perhaps, at first, but active as soon as we were installed. “ I would venture to say that I regard the Eckford outrage as merely another serious item in our road account, and deprecate its being allowed to obscure [?] main question of road, solution of which will be in itself by far the best vindication of our goxl name, and the only one politically worth the candle. “ (Addressed to Foreign ; repeated to Minister and Shiraz.) ” [1297— 510]'1 Lf Y ^11 f This Document is the property 0 / the Secretary of^ State f or India in Council.

It should perhaps be explained that the term “ British prestige ” throughout this note is not used in any chauvinistic sense, but is intended to describe only the conditions in_which British and British Indian subjects can cany on their lawful avocations with reasonable security of life and property. (1.) It is necessary first of all to define the problem with which His Majesty’s Government have to deal in Southern Persia. That problem is, it is assumed, simply the maintenance of order. Not, however, for its own sake that is the concern of the Persian Government; but because the maintenance of order is essential to the maintenance of British trade, which is essential to the maintenance of British influence. And the maintenance of British influence inland is essential to the maintenance of the British position in the Persian Gulf, which for a century has been the keystone of our policy in the Middle East, as being essential (it has always been assumed) to the safety of India. (2.) I his statement of the problem, if it be accepted, seems to meet the suggestion—otherwise plausible—that because Captain Eckford was on a shooting expedition and not on duty, the incident introduces no new factor, lor, from the practical point of view, what His Majesty’s Government have to deal with, is not the murder as such, but the murder in its bearing on the maintenance of order and ulterior consequences ; and the cardinal question is not what Captain Eckford was doing, but what his assailants thought he was doing. On this point the evidence is conclusive that they attacked him because they thought he was convoying a caravan, i.e. } precisely because they thought he was on duty. The incident, therefore, following on the still unpunished attack on the detachment with Mr. Smart a year ago (which in its turn had followed on a similar attack on Mr. Bill and his escort in 1 DICE'), represents another definite step on the downward grade of British influence ; and the question is whether the point has not been reached at which either measures must be taken which were not thought necessary a year ago, or our whole policy in Southern Persia and the Gulf must be recast. (3.) The Persian Government, at all events, appear to think that a turning point has been reached. It is clear that at last they are really frightened, and are making a serious attempt to do their duty. But they have many difficulties—lack of a force ; lack of loyal co-operation among those who ought to be leaders; lack of funds, unless His Majesty’s Government go on lending ; and can we reasonably go on lending money for operations which every one expects will prove abortive, and which we may then have to attempt over again ourselves at further expense ? (4.) It is impossible, therefore, to be optimistic as to the chances that the Persian Government will succeed. But most people will wish to give them the chance, even if the necessity of doing so were not forced upon us by the weather. But then one or two considerations suggest themselves : (i) How long are we to give them ? They themselves say one month. Sir W. Townley, with a judicious warning against forcing Mukhber to court disaster by precipitate action, says three or four. M e have seen in the Smart case the evil of allowing a thing of this kind to drag on interminably : it is now over a year since the attack, and the Persian Government are no nearer the punishment of the offenders. Every day that they remain unpunished, British S. 199. * These are mentioned only as cases of murderous attacks on His Majesty’s troops while on duty. The list of attacks on British officers and subjects in other circumstances is too long to be given here.2 (ii) prestige is a little lower among the people who really matter, he., the people in the south in whose midst British trade is carried on ; while the merit, if any, which we acquire with the Persian Govern ment by inaction is not a liquid asset. If His Majesty’s Government are eventually going to do anything, there must be a reasonably short time-limit. Nature has fixed a limit of about three months before action can, and five months after which it cannot, most advantageously be taken, the middle of March to the middle of May being the best times formarching up the Bushire-Shiraz road. On all grounds it would seem desirable to choose the earlier date, for if a force is to go, it should have plenty of time before the approach of hot weather makes operations difficult. If then it is to arrive at Bushire by 15th March, the Government of India must be instructed not later than the end of January, which would thus be the time-limit to give the Persian Government. Although we have not much choice as to giving the Persian Government a chance, it must be borne in mind that, if they fail, the situation is pro tanto worse, and it will be the more difficult for Plis Majesty’s Government to do nothing. Not onty because of the loss of prestige, but because the actual ferment that there will be in Pars if the tribes succeed in frustrating this stupendous effort of the Central Government will force action upon us in defence of British life and property. Much more, therefore, than the mere question of reparation hangs upon this venture. (5.) If, however, the Persian expedition is successful, it is probable, as Sir W. Townley observes, that the Governor-General’s prestige will be established, and order generally restored, not only on that road but else where. In such circumstances it might be practicable as a military operation, and possible without too great loss of prestige, for the 39th Central India Horse—though with somewhat bedraggled plumage—to find its way unaided to the Coast; and our troubles would be ended, so far as it is concerned. (6.) But if it fails, what courses will be open to His Majesty’s Government ? — (A.) To wait for the situation to develop—a course the disastrousness of which has been shown (as observed above) in connexion with the Smart incident, and which is from every point of view to be deprecated. (B.) To accept blood-money, a handsome apology, and such efforts as the Persian Government may have made, and to wipe the slate clean. There is much to be said for this course on its own merits, and if the only question at issue were reparation. But wiping the slate clean unfortunately provides no solution for the other difficulties of the situation. Even supposing it were practicable—and reason has been given above for thinking that a Persian defeat would force action on His Majesty’s Government—we should still be left with the problem of getting the regiment away, and of the ultimate restoration of order, which the Persian defeat would indefinitely postpone. There would appear to remain only the three courses which were discussed a year ago :— (а) A British punitive expedition, such as the Consul at Shiraz has all along urged, the Government of India and the India Office have always opposed, and Sir W. Townley now regards as inevitable. It would be superfluous to repeat the objections to this ; they have been stated more than once by this Office and by the Government cf India. The objection on the score of expense is perhaps the least of them—for it may well be argued that it is less unjustifiable to spend the Indian taxpayer’s money on measures which we know will be effective than to fritter it away in loans which so far have served no purpose. (б) The course first proposed by the Government of India, and accepted by Sir Edward Grey and then abandoaed by both, of sending up two brigades *“Hit ' ‘Got#,! ^naily e ®ontli5 | cannon e Biidl re 'Shiraz ^muieat Janiiary ) Persiaa 1 Persian they fail, * difficult f because hat there upeadons ’ore, than ibahle, as will he but else- military the lh -to find ) far as it Majesty's asiiess of with the ew to he rts as the ,te clean, ts, and if the slate ifficulties id reason &gt;at would ill he left i of the it would ich were o to effect the complete evacuation of Shiraz, civil and military. Before thev abandoned this proposal the Government of India realised fwhnt In,) t. ' pointed out by this Office and by the Director of Military Operitions) hat what we evacuated someone else would occupy ; and it is iAdeed obvious that tht policy means the final withdrawal of Great Britain from Southern Persia for it is certain that having thus retired we could never go back Here te oXVT'1\ W1 f ^ 0t 4 her ,^ 1 | 8ti ? n no '’ ™der discussion with the Foreign S a tinfont of Company’s concession, and tS issues arising out of it. If Southern Persia could be isolated there would undoubtedly be much to be said for cutting our losses and concentrating upon the only part of the country that is reallv vita politically and strategically, to India-the British sphere. But Southern Persia cannot he separated from the Persian Gulf. The control of the Gulf means the control of the coast, and the influence that is supreme in the hinterland is mat which, will ultimately be supreme on the coast. Personally I am not convinced that-quite apart from the future of Southern Persia—the trend ot events is not in the direction of the complete extinction of British 13ov er m the Persian Gulf m the course of the next 20 years We shall have to face the inevitable consolidation of Turkey as an Asiatic power at the head of the Gulf, more and more jealous of her rights and capable of asserting them. Behind turkey Germany pushing forward her economic and therefore, political interests-, along the Bagdad Railway to the sea. In Arabia the possible development of forces which may easily absorb our thm line of allies and squeeze us off the coast. The growth of inter national commerce in the Gulf itself which, if the Bagdad Railway ever reaches it, will become an international highway where the prescriptive rights of one nation will in practice receive scant recognition. And in Persia the growth of Russian power pressing down towards the warm water. Against all this (if it has any real existence) we have very little to set, and I venture to think that there will be a growing disinclination to stake anything very important upon the maintenance of our interests there. For example^ Lord Lansdowne’s famous declaration of 1902, which in effect made the establishment by a foreign power of a naval base in the Persian Gulf a casus belli ,—what is the probability that Canada and the other, dominions (if admitted to the control of foreign policy) would allow us to go to war, even if we wanted to, now, on that question if limited to the Gulf properly so called ?,f or even to redeem our pledges to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Moham- mera, if by any chance Germany should appear in shining armour beside 'Turkey in opposition to those two potentates ? At a meeting of the Defence Committee last year—of the proceedings of which there is no full record—Lord Nicholson, if I remember rightly, threw out the opinion that it did not matter very much what happened in the Gulf. And in fact it does not matter, vitally, on two conditions, (i) that we have a strong naval base at the mouth of the Gulf, or a sufficiently strong naval force within reach, and can seal it when w r e will; (ii) that we allow no Power to come down lo the coast of Persia at Chahbar (in the British sphere) or anywhere outside the Gulf. These considerations may have seemed to stray rather far from the immediate issue, but they are not irrelevant to my point, which is twofold, viz. (i) that we cannot deal even with the immediate issue without raising the whole question of the British policy in those regions; (ii) that if we are to confine ourselves to the vital necessities, political and strategical, of India and the far East, it is possible to sacrifice the Gulf as well as Southern Persia, on certain indispensable conditions. Whether the advantages far outweigh the many disadvantages as to make it expedient is t Lord Lansdowne’s declaration was in fact loosely worded. He had in mind more especially Chahbar, which is outside the Gulf, and is so near to India that we should have no alternative at any time but to resist its occupation. SO another matter. * Since the above was written a consular report has been received which shows that the Hamburg-Amerika Line (whose relations with the German Government are well known) increased its imports via the Gulf to Bagdad and Basra by 100 per cent, last year; while the German firm of Wonckhaus (trading by what the Board of Trade call “ unsound methods ”) exported more wheat than all the British firms put together, and made a profit of 30,000Z.6th January 1913. 4 (r) The course suggested by the Government of India at a later stage-- the despatch of the necessary force to withdraw the regiment only, to which Ais Office attached the condition that the force should be strong enough, and its commanding officer free, to follow up and punish his assailants if he were attacked • but it was common to both that there should be no general punithe operations. This proposal is no doubt rather speculative lie Wea would be that the force in fact won d be opposed, tha it would do a oood deal of damage on the way up, that it would demonstrate to the tri bes men (what we know from our officers, who have travelled among them since he a tack on Mr. Smart, needs demonstrating) that they have not yet defeated the whole Indian Army, and that British prestige would m this way so far be restored that, when the force reached Shiraz, it would be possible for i to bring away the cavalry with something like edat, leaving the Consul behind with a slightly enlarged escort In the meantime part of the force would have stopped at and occupied the Kazerun plain from which point it would maintain order up and down the road. It would then be for he Persian Government to step into the void that would be created when the force slowly withdrew. This would of course be a half measure. \\ e could not be certain that the same conditions would not be set up again at the next tribal migration—though, by the retention of a sufficient force at Bushire for some time, the risk of this might be minimised (see also paragraph 7 below) It is a half measure: but the only whole measures aie a punitive expedition and, or, complete evacuation. &lt; . . The force which the Director of Military Operations thought necessary in January last to safeguard Shiraz, make good the lines of communications, and carry out such punitive operations as might be found necessai}, \\as Two mixed brigades of infantry, each to include a pioneer regiment. _ Two Indian Cavalry regiments, including the regiment already at Shiraz. Two or more batteries of mountain artillery. . . One field company of Sappers and Miners, with the necessary admini strative services. . .

It should he added that either (a), (b), or (c), being military operations, the consent of both Houses of Parliament would have to be obtained before any part of the cost could be charged to Indian revenues. (7.) But nothing that His Majesty’s Government or the Persian Govern ment can do will permanently restore order in Southern Persia unless the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf is destroyed. This point has not hitherto received the attention it deserves, and has been treated mainly as a domestic trouble of the Government of India. The Government of India have now (for the time being, at all events) destroyed the trade with the north-west frontier (which is all that directly concerns them) by maintaining a naval blockade in the Gulf at their own expense (amounting to over half a million sterling) ; and this expense has been forced upon them, by the exigencies of Imperial policy, because, on the one hand, the entente makes it difficult to take a very strong line against France, and, on the other hand, the refusal of the Colonial Office to cede Gambia deprives us of the price which will buy France completely out of Muscat. Indorum iniuriae Indis curae. But the Persian aspect of the question is one for His Majesty’s Government, and it is quite certain that so long as the tribesmen can draw practically inexhaustible stores of ammunition from the Gulf, so long will disorder reign. It is essential, therefore, that—whether by bargaining or by other means — a settlement with France should be pressed through to a conclusion as a matter of real urgency. A.

And the maintenance of British influence inland is essential to the maintenance of the British position in the Persian Gulf, which for a century has been the keystone of our policy in the Middle East, as being essential (it has always been assumed) to the safety of India.

'xltr i * xt n (December 18, 11'20 a.m.) MY telegram No. G40 of 15th November. I received further note from the Persian Government late last night detailing the measures taken by the Government here and by the Governor-General at Shiraz to punish the tribe guilty of the outrage which resulted in the death of Captain Eckford. These measures include a punitive expedition, with its base at Kazerun, as well as encircling movements entrusted to the Governor of Behbehan, Bakhtiari chiefs, and the Governor of Ispahan. Hope is expressed that with in one month the persons implicated in the attack on Smart, as also authors of the recent outrage, will be captured and brought to justice. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, whom I shall see later in the day, has especially requested me to inform you at once of the steps that are being taken to punish the robbers,^ who are actually now being pursued by o00 horsemen. ' It is clear that a serious attempt is being made to punish the offenders, but the season of the year is very unpropitious, and it can hardly be expected that one month will suffice for the purpose. I am afraid that there is small hope that the various authorities called upon to take action will combine together sufficiently loyally to ensure success. The Governor-General evidently intends to do his utmost to make reparation, and j the British consul at Shiraz urges that he should be granted time to develop his plans, j Considering all the circumstances of the case, it would perhaps be faiff to give the governor a chance of proving his worth. For this purpose delay of three or four months would have to be accorded, but added zeal will be given to the Persian efforts if it is felt that failure to exact punishment will necessitate His Majesty’s Government taking the necessary steps to obtain reparation. For this reason, if His Majesty’s Government decide to allow the Persian Government a limited measure of time in which to secure reparation, I am of the opinion that steps should all the same be taken to prepare expedition to accomplish what it is more than probable Persia, unaided, will be unable to perform. A successful Persian punitive operation would serve to establish the Governor- General’s prestige, and to restore order generally. (Addressed to Foreign Office; repeated to Bushire and Shiraz.)

Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received December 20, 2T5 p.m.) Tehran, December 20, 1912. (No.-648.) R. (December 20, 1'30 p.m.) FOLLOWING from His Majesty’s representative at Shiraz, No. 210 of 19th December :— “ I had another long conversation with the Governor-General last night, during which he again assured me that all possible steps were being taken to identify and punish the robbers. He says that he has dispatched a trustworthy agent with a small party of horsemen to Ardaka and other places, who is busily engaged in securing evidence regarding the identity of the robbers and in trying to trace the stolen goods. In addition to this, Daria Begi starts at once for Kazerun, where he will raise a small local force of some 600 men. Men will also be recruited at Kamarij. These two forces will have dual duty—firstly, of guarding the road for passenger caravans, and more especially of the party of gendarmes who will be returning shortly from Bushire with arms and ammunition, and, secondly, of taking active measures against Mohammed Ali Khan of the Kashkulis, whenever the Governor-General considers that all preparations are sufficiently far advanced. The Governor-General is also in communication with Soulet-ed-Dowleh, from whom he expects assistance in the matter. It is not likely that these measures will produce any very definite result, but, at any rate, the general idea is sound, and if in the meantime the Governor-General continues his preparations here for the organisation of a regular force, it may be hoped that by the spring he will be strong enough to take decisive measures against Mohammed Ali Khan (whom he regards as by far the most serious offender), and also against the perpetrators of the last outrage. “He tells me that he has prepared budget for expenditure of 15,000/., which he promises to let me see shortly, but I do not suppose that much progress can be made in any question of finance until after the arrival of the new financial agent.” The following from His Majesty’s representative at Shiraz, No. 211 of 19th December:— “ The identity of the robbers. “ I have been receiving information on this point during the last few days from a number of different sources. All informants agree that the band included a number of men of Mamaseni tribe, and I have lists of the names of the principal persons said to have been involved. It is also possible that, as the Governor-General avers, Boir Ahmedis also took part in the raid, but they were certainly well supported by the Mamaseni,^ and by some Kashgars. I conversed on this matter with the Governor-General last night. He agrees that it is quite possible, and, indeed, probable, that, besides the Boir Ahmedis, the band contained members of the Mamaseni and other tribes. In any case, he is anxious to make the punishment of Mohammed Ali Khan and the surrender of persons concerned in guilt of the attack on Smart the first plan in his programme. When that has been accomplished, it will be easy to deal with the other offenders. “ I have received reliable information to the effect that robbers lost two killed and three wounded.” [1297- 461] r 21 DEC 19^ yAoPV TO INDIA ) Keg ue rARVS nkjOt- |ITMb Document ia the Pfcniariy of His Rrfeaank Maaestys PERSIA. CONPIDKNTIAL. [40874] No. 1. [October 17.] Section 2. India Office to Foreign Office.—(Received October 17.) Sir, India Office, October 16, 1911. IN continuation of Mr. Abrahams’ letter of the 9th instant, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to address you on the subject of the scheme for the protection of caravans on the roads of Southern Persia, suggested by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran in his telegram No. 401 of the 14th September. The views of the Government of India on this proposal were expressed in their telegram of the 30th September, copy of which was enclosed in my letter above quoted, and have the entire concurrence of the Marquess of Crewe. Hfliis Lordship’s opinion, it would be quite impossible in practice to differentiate attacks upon travelling- escorts of cavalry from attacks upon any other of His Majesty’s forces on foreign soil. That is to say,_ in the event of such attacks being made, it would be essential, for the purpose of maintaining the prestige in virtue of which alone such small bodies of men can safely move about the country at all, to undertake punitive measures against the tribes to which the assailants belong ; and when once that process began, the consequences foreseen by the Government of India would surely follow. Those consequences Lord Crewe naturally regards mainly from the Indian point of view ; and I am to say that alike on political, military, and financial grounds he is in the highest degree averse from taking any step that is likely to precipitate them. The present commotion in the Moslem world is reflected in the numerous appeals for the good offices of His Majesty’s Government in behalf of Turkey that have been received from Indian-Moslems. And a military occupation of Southern Persia—or anything that could be misrepresented as such—following on recent events in Morocco and Tripoli would, in his Lordship’s opinion, have a deplorable political effect in India. Nor would the political effect of adopting the proposals be confined to the Moslems. As Sir E. Grey is perhaps aware, the military expenditure of the Indian Government is already an object of unfavourable criticism by important sections of Indian public opinion. The difficulty of rebutting such criticism will be greatly increased if it is seen that the Government of India are able to maintain even two regiments of cavalry for an indefinite time on foreign service, while it seems improbable that so small a force will long prove sufficient. But apart altogether from this political aspect of the question, I am to say that neither the military nor the financial resources of India are such as to justify any material extension of Indian responsibilities at so great a distance from her frontier. The developments of Chinese policy on the north-east and east are already necessitating increased expenditure, and may not improbably involve some redistribution of the Indian army upon those frontiers ; while a widespread disturbance on the north western frontier—for which the existing acute antagonism between Moslem and Christian Powers is a predisposing condition—might at any moment call into action the full strength of the field army. And in this connection it should be mentioned that by 21 &amp; 22 Viet., cap. 106, sec. 55 the consent of both Houses of Parliament is required before the revenues of India can be applied to the conduct of military operations beyond its external frontier. These are the domestic considerations which lead Lord Crewe to view with apprehension the dispatch of troops even for the protection of life, and which make it impossible for him (as at present advised) to recommend the Council of India to sanction the expenditure, or any part of it, involved in the adoption of Sir G. Barclay’s scheme. But there are two further considerations, arising from the state of Persia itself, which his Lordship wishes to submit to Sir E. Grey. It is not to be supposed that the occasional passage of an escorted caravan along the roads will of itself suffice to restore order in the country, nor is it proposed to use the troops directly for that purpose. But it is the now chronic disorder which, by destroying the purchasing power of the people and the credit of the merchants, and by [2219 r—2]. p -I i^i-.r.'hitoritq into predatory habits, is far more damaging to Biitish. driving peaceful mha F| ie roac [ s • and until it is removed, by measures trade Ooternment alone can take, his Lordship fears that any beneficial Teslh thatBhe introdnction of Indian troops might have would be wholly incom- mensruate with ^f^^feXsteongly that the dispatch of large bodies of in concnibiu , pvnress wishes of the Government, except for the actuS protection rf life! cannot be justified on any grounds that would satisfy reasonable public opinion in this country. ^ ^ ^*(C jM. cLUydi U6 L / V-. \ From Viceroy, 2&gt;Qth September 1911. Foreign Secret. Your telegrams of 25th and 27th September. We have carefully considered Cox’s scheme for protection of trade caravans, as defined by Sir G. Barclay’s telegram, No. 401, to the Foreign Office. Our Military advisers consider that it would be preferable to send two regiments of Native Cavalry distributed as followsShiraz area, 1 squadron at Bushire, 2 squadrons and headquarters at Shiraz, 1 squadron at Isfahan ; Kerman area, 1 squadron at Bunder Abbas, 1 squadron at Kerman, 2 squadrons and headquarters at Bam with new Vice-Consulate. This only entails small addition to Cox’s proposal and we are issuing orders for men to be held in readiness. It seems likely that troops will be required for one or two years, possibly longer, and cost will be heavy. Existing accommodation at the places indicated is non-existent, and barracks or shelters and stabling must be provided. Regiments must take their full complement of mules from India. In view of predominance of British trade and of inevitable necessity of protecting foreign as well as British and Indian trade, once that protective measures are undertaken, we trust that the Imperial Exchequer will agree to bear not less than two-thirds of entire cost. We do not anticipate great difficulty in regard to supply and transport for squadrons proceeding from Bushire to Shiraz and Isfahan, but extensive arrangements will probably be necessary for squadrons proceeding from Bunder Abbas to Kerman and Bam, and Cox should receive earliest possible instructions immediately decision to send troops is arrived at. Military authorities point out that addition of travelling escorts of cavalry will add to our politionTresponsibilities unless it is held that attacks on these escorts will not be considered as furnishing cause for punitive expeditions, but will be punished by reprisals of another kind, such as fine, &lt;kc. Although a decision in this sense may be accepted in principle, it is useless to close our eyes to the fact that a successful attack upon and destiuction of a convoy by a powerful tribe would entail punitive measuies, if only to keep roads open. These are risks which cannot be overlooked, and each case must be dealt with on its merits. . . The proposal entails military measures, costly in themselves, m the interior of Persia for a period of which it is impossible to foresee the duiation. These are not unlikely to involve our officers and men in conflict with local administration. It has hitherto been our policy to confine our efforts to maintaining order in Gulf ports by the action of our ships and an occasional temporary disembarkation of sailors or troops for protection of lntisi interests and residents in those ports. The policy now advocated may, as pointed out by His Majesty’s Minister, precipitate events m Shiraz, will undoubtedly extend our responsibilities in the interior and might under certain circumstances lead to a military occupation of Southern 1 ersia, a ^Sure thatTwe believe His Majesty’s Government have every desire to avoid. We presume such contingencies cannot have escaped notice ot His Majesty’s Government, who are pressing on this preliminary step, but m any case we have considered it our duty to point out clearly the risks mvo vec. -—Cv -CONFIDENTIAL. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey—(Received December 16, 11 a.m.) Tehran, December 15, 1912. (No. 640.) R. (December 15, U\58 p.m.) MY immediately preceding telegram . I addressed note couched in terms of your telegram No. 726 to the Persian Government on 13th December. I have to-day received a reply [?] explaining the circumstances of the incident as reported by the Governor-General, and promising to submit the nature of adequate reparation that the Persian Government are prepared to make at an early date. Note expresses the deep regret of the Persian Government at the deplorable incident. Similar expressions have been made by the Prime Minister and Minister of War, who called specially for the purpose of doing so. The British consul-general at Bushire has repeated me a telegram addressed by him to the Government of India, in which he reviews the present unsatisfactory condition of southern trade routes, and expresses a firm conviction that no other agency but the force of our own arms can be now counted on to re-establish and maintain order. Sir P. Cox is of opinion that if we restored order on one road the fact would result in the re-establishment of order on other roads, and urges that effective action, including occupation of the valley of Kazerun, should be prepared for the spring. In your telegram No. 727 you did me the honour to ask my views as to the punishment which should be infiicted on guilty tribe. In view of the situation which has prevailed at Shiraz for some time past, which has resulted in occurrence of frequent minor outrages at expense of British officers and subjects and of recent incident, I am decidedly of opinion that nothing short of most exemplary punishment would suffice. The Persian Government express their firm intention to infiict such punishment on tribe which they believe to be guilty, and have ordered the necessary steps to be taken to practically exterminate them. I have pointed out that not only should the tribe be punished, but that also the headmen of the villages where the incident occurred have earned condign punishment, because it is clear that they must have known of the presence of such a large robber force in their vicinity. Climatic circumstances oblige us to give the Persian Government delay of two to three months in which they can execute their punitive measures. There is not the smallest doubt that they will prove incapable of carrying out such measures, although I believe them to be sincerely desirous of doing so. In these circumstances l am most decidedly of opinion that steps should be taken to prepare an expedition that will be able to restore order and, if necessary, punish offenders on Shiraz-Bushire road. The Governor-General had commenced so well that it is with the greatest regret that I feel constrained to express this opinion, but, urdess some action is taken, the British name will become laughing-stock in south, and I fear there is small chance of the gendarmerie being able to restore the safety of the trade routes for a long time to come, although they are themselves confident in their ability to do so. I am sending all documents not telegraphed in full, with further appreciations, by post to-day. (Addressed to Foreign Office ; sent to India.) 12J97—381]CONFIDENTIAL. 4000 L Sir W.

(December 15, 11*58 p.m.) SHIRAZ incident. ; My immediately preceding telegrams have contained all details received from British sources at Shiraz. The Persian Government have com municated to me the report of the incident furnished by the Governor-General. It tallies in all essential particulars with British reports, but makes it evident that there was a caravan, of the presence of which Major Kettlewell was ignorant. From the Governor-General’s report it would appear clear that robbers allowed the force of about 100 Persian soldiers, 30 gendarmes, and 10 artillerymen, with 1 Swede and several Persian officers, to pass, and attacked the British jparty in the belief that they were escorting the caravan they had come out to plunder. The Governor-General adds that the robbers were undoubtedly Boerahmedis, and that twelve of them were killed, and all the mules laden with goods recovered but three. He also states that fighting lasted for five hours, until the failing light and fatigue obliged the gendarmes and horsemen to cease fighting. I am telegraphing to Shiraz for information on these points, and as to the number of gendarmes and the nature of the cavalry engaged. It is now evident that Captain Eckford was the only man killed, though four gendarmes and one rifleman are reported wounded. The Governor-General is dispatching a force in pursuit of the brigands, but snow in the passes will render all operations difficult, and urgent orders have been sent to the Bakhtiari Governor of Behbehan and to the Sardar Jang to collect a large force of Bakhtiaris and severely punish the Boerahmedis, who will thus be taken between { two fires. I fear that there is not much satisfaction to be hoped for from these measures. 1297—379]CONFIDENTIAL. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey—(Received December 15, lO'BO p.m.) Tehran, December 15, 1912.

During last year I have had to choose between keeping officers and men closely confined to the immediate neighbourhood of Shiraz or allowing them such latitude as after consultation with His Majesty’s consul and the local Persian authorities, I thought I might reasonably do. Until quite recently I have thought it advisable to adopt the former alternative, and, although moral effect of such action is exceedingly injurious to regiment, I have, in view of political considerations involved, raised no protest. With the increased security following temporarily on the arrival of Governor- General and the policing by gendarmerie of the roads in neighbourhood, I have allowed somewhat greater latitude, and accordingly sanctioned trips toj Dashtarjin and availed myself of the opportunity to send with them small surveying party under the superin tendence of Captain Eckford, who was himself trained surveyor. In view of result I deeply regret having done so, but submit that the risk was not greater than that incurred by shooting expeditions within a few miles of Shiraz, where small parties of officers and men have frequently been fired at, and there was always chance of encountering a large raiding party.’ ” It has been clear for some time that the situation at Shiraz was well-nigh intolerable for both officers and men, but I had not realised that it was quite so bad as is shown from the telegram just repeated to you. I understand from Mr. Smart that the firing on shooting parties generally was due to the action of villagers, who in the present disturbed state of the province are prone to fire on any armed party on the chance of their being robbers. When there has been any doubt on this point, punish ment has been inflicted.CONFIDENTIAL. /* Q 1 Q I 4 o c u ! ! 2 Sit* IF. Townley to Sir Ttidioard Grey.—(Received December 15, 9 p.m.) Tehran, December 15, 191A {No. 636.) Decode. (December 15, 9 p.m.) FOLLOWING from Shiraz, No. 201, 14th December :— “ Colonel Douglas has handed me detailed report on incident, drawn up by Major Kettlewell, from which I extract following details:— “ Party consisted of Kettlewell, Eckford, 1 native officer, 26 sowars, 17 followers, and 17 baggage mules. They started from Khanehzinian at 7 A.M., llth December, half an hour after a party of about 150 Persian soldiers, who were marching down road independently. Twelve men were told off as baggage guards, remainder with officers as advance guard. At the bridge over Kazaagach River, Persian officer of the gendarmerie with two mounted gendarmes who had accompanied Kettlewell to the river galloped on ahead to inspect gendarmerie post at Burjitinuri, on the top of the Sinihsafid Pass. Kettlewell also sent on ahead native officer and two sowars to prepare quarters at Dastarjin. Scouts were also posted on wooded hills on the left flank. After short halt, party proceeded. Road here runs through jungle for about 1^ miles. Two officers, accompanied by six or seven sowars, had passed beyond jungle, and, just as leading mules were appearing from jungle, hot fire was opened by a party from hills on left. Advanced galloped ahead, got under cover, dismounted, and started to climb hill. It was difficult to discover enemy through thick jungle, but shots were exchanged, and it is now that Eckford was shot through heart. A few minutes after, Kettlewell saw from crest of ridge 150 to 200 men rush out from bottom of ravine below, towards river-bank. His men fired on them, but they quickly disappeared into jungle. Mean while sowars of baggage guard had crossed to north bank of river and taken up position in low hills. They report that smaller body of robbers joined attack also from the north. Kettlewell now’ collected men with him, descended hills and crossed river-bed, taking Eckford’s body with him. They joined other party, and native officer and tw r o sowars who had gone ahead also rejoined party here. Meanwhile robbers appear to have made off over hills northwards with the booty. Whole party then returq.to Khanehzinian, moving by north bank of river. During this movement some fifteen to tw r enty horsemen were seen on hills to north and shots exchanged. Kettlewell states he saw no caravan litter at caravanserai at Khanehzinian or on road. Small party of Persians with three or four mules, who left Serai after sowars had started, were robbed and their mules taken. They returned to Serai on foot, where Kettlewell saw them, but he had not seen them on road. “ Kettlewell also states that, beyond the firing, no attempt was made to attack his small party. Robbers were apparently only out for plunder, and cleared off at once when they had seized mules. As to the gendarmerie, it would appear that Persian officer when he reached the burj brought his men back along crest of hills, and it was there that they were wounded. Kettlewell only saw them in the distance moving along hills to south when he was returning towards Khanehzinian. Copy of Kettlewell’s detailed report will be posted to you by Douglas.”CONFIDENTIAL. r O 1 O /S J 4o , | 9 i 2 Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 15.) Tehran, December 15, 19i2.

FOLLOWING from Shiraz, No. 202 of 14th December:— “ My telegram No. 201 contains all details which can be furnished by Colonel Douglas and Major Kettlewell regarding actual circumstances of attack on the latter’s party. It will be seen that not only was there no intention of escorting caravan, but J that Major Kettlewell was not even aware that there was any caravan in his vicinity. “I have searched carefully through the records of this office, and the only instructions which I can find at all resembling those referred to by Foreign Office, namely, that ‘ troops were not to go out of Shiraz except for exercise in close * * vicinity,’ are those contained in Sir G. Barclay’s telegrarn No. 60 of 3rd March (in connection with Sultanabad incident reported in legation telegram No. 153 ), in which he says that ‘some understanding should be come to with deputy governor as to in what direction and within what limits troops can safely exercise.’ As the expedition upon which two officers had started on this occasion was planned with the knowledge and consent of the Governor-General, I venture to think that spirit, if not exact letter, of these instructions had been observed. “I need scarcely add that neither Colonel Douglas nor myself are likely wilfully to disregard instructions of yourself and Government. “ As regards other queries contained in your telegram under reply and not fully answered by my immediately preceding telegram &gt; I beg to report as follows :— “ 1. Responsibility of tribesmen is not yet known for certain. Governor-General’s secretary informed me yesterday that there were Boerahmadi, but other information points to their having been Dushmanziaris, and other Mamaserris, who are^ under the influence of Mohammed Ali Khan Kashkuli, together with others of the latter s followers. More definite information will be telegraphed to you as soon as it is available. “2. Casualties amongst gendarmes.

Officers and men occupied two positions and returned fire, but owing to difficult nature of country and fact that robbers came in opposite directions were unable to prevent them carrying off some mules.

The difficulty of rebutting such criticism will be greatly increased if it is seen that the Government of India are able to maintain even two regiments of cavalry for an indefinite time on foreign service, while it seems improbable that so small a force will long prove sufficient.

Tehran, October 19, 1911. ’ I REGRET to see from the telegram of Sir A ; Nicolson of yesterday that the telegrams you have received from me recently have failed to make my view sufficiently clear as to whether the dispatch of reinforcements of the consular escorts should he suspended or not. From the moment that Nizam-es-Sultaneh and Soulet-ed-Dowleh with the Kashgais left Shiraz I have never wavered in my view that no reinforcement was needed if the situation actually in the town was alone to he considered. Even when things had looked blackest at Shiraz (see my telegram No. 460 of the 2nd October), when I felt compelled to deliver my warning to Soulet-ed-Dowleh that unless he left the neigh bourhood of Shiraz forthwith I should recommend His Majesty s Government to take the necessary steps to protect British interests, it was only under the impression that His Majesty’s Government were considering favourably the scheme for increasing the consular guards for the purpose of escorting caravans, and that quite independently of the actual situation in Shiraz the escort at that consulate was shortly to be increased, that I recommended in my telegram No. 462 of the 3rd. October, that the dispatch of troops destined, if the Government of India concurred in our scheme for escorting caravans for Ispahan and Shiraz, should be accelerated. I was still under the same impression when in my telegram No. 474 of the 7th October I deprecated delaying the departure of the troops meiely because the situation in the town of Shiraz had improved, and suggested a form of announcement to the Persian Government, basing our action on the general disorder m the south and showing that it was our intention to use the troops for the piotection o caravans. . .

Barclay tele graphed that an English lady, Miss Ross, while travelling with a caravan from Ispahan to Shiraz had been beaten by Kushgeluis near Abadeh. On the 30th October he reported that she had again been attacked after leaving Abadeh, her money and some clothes being taken. In the middle of December- supplies were obtainable for the Indian troops at Shiraz only when recourse to force had been threatened, and this was followed by a more serious incident, when, on the 2 ^- 1 th December, a party going from Shiraz to meet Mr. Smart, about to take up consular duty at that place, were fired on by road-guards from the hills above Kotar Dakhtar near Kazerun, with the result that one sowar was killed and one wounded. On the 26th December a second attack was made while Major Birdwood was bringing Mr. Smart into Kazerun, resulting in the death of two followers, besides one missing, and the wounding of Mr. Smart himself, seven sowars, one hospital assistant, and one follower. In consequence of the serious situation thus created preparation was made to land at Bushire, if necessary, 200 bluejackets and marines and 250 Indian infantry, in addition to the 50 men already at that place. In the result some 269 men of the 79th Carnatic Infantry were put on shore, on the understanding that they were not to advance inland. Proposed despatch of infantry battalion and battery to Shiraz. Suggestion as to a punitive expe dition. Sir G. Barclay’s telegram, No. 757, 28th December 1911. 18. On the 28th December Sir G. Barclay tele graphed his concurrence in the view of Mr. Knox, who was Acting Consul at Shiraz, that one battalion of infantry and one battery of mountain guns should reach Shiraz via Bunder Abbas and Lingah before the tribes moved on to the roads in March, when there would be 1.5,000 armed tribesmen in the Shiraz valley. Otherwise, Sir G. Barclay thought no course would be safe but to close the Consulate and let the British residents in Shiraz know that we could not protect them, and that they would remain at Shiraz at their own risk. Sir G. Barclay added that for a punitive expe dition and the effective opening up of the Bushire- Shiraz road a properly organised force of four12 battalions of infantry and mountain guns would be required. . ^ 1 , On the 30th December Sir (h Barclay repeated a telegram from the Consular Officer at Shiraz (Mr. Knox) expressing the view that unless an adequate punitive expedition were shortly des patched Fars would have to be evacuated altogether, and that even evacuation could not be carried out without strong reinforcements by which British subjects might be escorted to the coast. Mr. Knox added that Mr. Smart also agreed in the necessity of a punitive expedition. 19. The Government of India, on being asked their views by the Secretary of State on the pro posal to send a battalion and battery to Shiraz, were averse from that course on the ground of the risks involved. Instead, they recommended the landing at Bushire of a battalion of infantry to hold the town in pledge, the retention of the customs, and a blockade of the coast, which would prevent the tribesmen from obtaining ammunition. They at the same time pointed out that, apart from the question of a punitive expedition, it might become necessary to eftect the relief of the detachment of cavalry at Shiraz, for which a force would be required of at least 5.U00 men, viz. : — Infantry - - 4 regiments. Cavalry - - - 1 9 regiment. 1 st the Mountain batteries They considered that, if such a force had to be sent, it should bring away with the least possible delay thp cavalry detachments at Shiraz and Ispahan, the members of the Consulate, and any British subjects who might be willing to leave. In a letter to the Foreign Office, dated the January 1913, the India Office agreed as to inadvisability of sending only a battalion and battery to Shiraz, but, regarding the urgency of relieving Shiraz as the keynote of the situation, commented adversely on the proposals of the Government of India which would entail its postponement, involve the holding of Bushire for a considerable time, and leave open the neutral sphere to the intervention of Russia. The letter put forward the alternative course of immediate occupation in force of Shiraz, with effective control oi the road to Bushire, suggesting at the same time that the whole of the cost should be borne by the British Fxchequer. zone.

Mention may here be made of a Memo- randum of the Director of Military Operations, dated loth January 1912, in which he pointed out the results of abandoning our position in the west of bouthem Persia, and stated that to safeguard irniraz, make good the lines of communications, and carry out such punitive operations as might be found necessary, we should require — Two mixed brigades of infantry, each to include a pioneer regiment. /I wo Indian cavalry regiments, including the regiment in Persia. 1 wo or more batteries of mountain artillery. One lielo company of sappers and miners. if military action were to be taken for such tempo laiy occupation it should be taken promptly. On the 11 th January the Government of India again addressed the Secretary of State. They now thought it possible that the situation might be met oy sending a regiment of Native infantry to Bushire and subsidising the tribal chiefs, who would in return keep up guards on a regular roster and on regular pay, while a special Assistant to the Resident, on the analogy of the Political Officer in the Khyber, would be employed to supervise the arrangements. 23. On the same day, SirG. Barclay addressed two telegrams to the Foreign Office. In one he communicated the opinions of Colonel Douglas (commanding the cavalry regiment) and of Mr. Smart, both pointing to stringent measures. In the other he expressed his conviction that no course was open beyond the two alternatives of ( 1 ) the occupation of Shiraz and the road, and (2) evacuation. On the whole he would have favoured the latter, if so large a force had not been necessary for the purpose: On the 16th January Sir E. Grey instructed Sir G. Barclay, in a telegram repeated to India the same day, that such force as would be necessary should be sent to carry out evacuation from Shiraz. He enquired whether the evacuation of Ispahan and Vezd would also be required, and how Kerman would be affected. On the 17th January Sir E. Grey further explained that we could not hold permanently by force Shiraz and the roads, since a very large force would be required, and we might be committed in effect to the occupation of Southern Persia. Bushire or Bunder Abbas, or both, could be occupied after the withdrawal from Shiraz, till satisfaction had been obtained and a return to Shiraz were possible. In subsequent telegrams Sir G. Barclay ex plained that, had it not been for the opinion of the Officer Commanding on the military situation, he S. 186 . d14 would have preferred maintaining things at Shiraz as they were: as it was, he had based his report on the expert opinion of Colonel Douglas that the position at Shiraz was untenable. He also expressed doubt as to the policy of occupying Bushire and Bunder Abbas. On the 22nd January he expressed the view that the evacuation of Yezd or Ispahan would not be necessary, and that Kerman would not be greatly affected by the evacuation of Shiraz. On the 22nd January 1912 Sir G. Barclay further telegraphed that he considered, after consultation with Colonel Douglas, that a force would be re quired of four battalions of infantry (one of pioneers), and one or two mountain batteries, besides at least two battalions of troops for com munications. The troops had best arrive towards the end of March. The squadron at Ispahan might, he thought, be withdrawn by the Bakhtiari road, if their withdrawal was intended. 24. On the 23rd January a long telegram was received from the Government of India in which they strongly urged a reconsideration of the deci sion to withdraw. They remarked that the situation appeared to have eased considerably ; they doubted whether British and foreign firms or institutions at the different centres would be willing to retire, and they were inclined to think that the local officers had over-estimated the seriousness of the position. They thought that hopes might be entertained of some action on the part of the Persian Government, and were increasingly doubtful of leaving in Central Persia a vacuum which might be taken advantage of by others. The force required to effect withdrawal from Shiraz alone would be a war division less one brigade. The alternative course they suggested was negotiations with the tribes for exaction of satis faction and the opening of the road by levies of subsidised tribesmen, to be supervised by the four Swedish officers said to be leaving for Shiraz, in association with British officers ; the elimination or punishment of the Khan of Borasjun ; restriction of import of arms and ammunition for the tribes men ; and the location at Basidu of a regiment of infantry and a battery of mountain artillery. 25. In a letter to the Foreign Office, dated the 25th January, the India Office raised doubt as to the efficacy in present circumstances of a system of subsidies, and drew attention to certain considera tions which, taken together, suggested very great risk of a disaster at Shiraz, if withdrawal were not effected, viz., the irritation of the tribesmen at any retaliatory measures of the Persian Government; the difficulty of holding the subsidised chiefs to their obligations without a backing of force; the possibility that these chiefs would be unable to con trol their own men ; the delay which must take place before the Swedish officers could organise any force.

On the 5th February the Government of India acknowledged receipt of this telegram, and, while awaiting instructions regarding the despatch of the troops to be located in the Gulf, proposed that an explanation of British policy should be given to the Press in England and Calcutta, and that the Ulemas of Mesopotamia and the Persian authorities should be moved to use their influence in a friendly sense. After referring next to the treatment to be given to the Khan of Borasjun, they described generally the manner in which the headmen might be made responsible for the road from Bushire, with a regular subsidy and the monthly pay of the guards, as well as assurances against interference by the Persian authorities. The cost, in which it was presumed His Majesty’s Government would share, was placed at 10,0001. a year, to be recovered ultimately from Persian sources. In a later telegram they also recurred to the question of the blockade of the Persian coast (see paragraph 25), and, placing its cost at the rate of about 33 , 333 L a year for each vessel employed, presumed that a moiety of this charge also would be borne by His Majesty’s Government.

The main object of the British portion of this joint advance is to be to enable the Persian Government to maintain a gendarmerie in the south. It has recently been reported that the Swedish colonel now at Tehran hopes tb organise a’ gendarmerie by the end of--P 2 months at a cost (exclusive of arms and ammunition) of about 140,000k, and that he contemplates a force of 1,450 men for the Bushire-lspahan road, to cost about 50,800k during the same period. A;mobile column is also to be organised later on, anil it is further proposed to engage four more Swedish officers. / I J. E. F. Sir E. Grey’s Telegram No. 109, 9th February 1912. Sir G.

Foieign Secret. Shiraz incident, The telegrams that have reached the Government of India from Shiraz and Bushire shew that what was foreseen as not unlikely has now happened, and that the detachments of Indian cavalry sent to Shiraz and Ispahan have been attacked by tribesmen with some loss (.) and that a force of 100 cavalry are in a precarious position at Kazerun. It is satisfactory to note that Consul Smart has only been wounded, and appeals to be in safety in a caravanserai. Question now arises as to what action is to be taken. First, obvious suggestion is to land a battalion of infantry at Bushire to hold town in pledge until the Persian Government have taken effective measures to inflict condign punishment upon the tribesmen who attacked the British cavalry. The Customs should be seized and retained, and surplus over what is due for the service loans should be kept as a contribution towards claim to be made upon the Persian Government. Disembarkation of infantry would free ship now guarding the port, and would permit a blockade of coast which would create an uncomfortable situation for the tribesmen, and prevent their renewing their supplies of ammunition. This is very essential if/measures are to be taken, and we consider that the despatch of a battalion of infantry should be proceeded with at once- Question then arises as to whether any punitive measures should be undertaken against the offending tribes. Government of India consider that measures would be ewsntunify, difficult and hazardous owing to elusive nature of tribes and to precipitous character of country. Moreover, they could only be undertaken by a large field force with a considerable amount of transport. There is, however, a further contingency which must be foreseen, viz., that even when the detachment at Kazerun has succeeded in returning to Shiraz, it is possible that main force at Shiraz will find itself in an entirely isolated position involving a certain amount of danger. It would then become necessary to relieve the detachment, and to effect this without running new risks a force of at least 5,000 men would be required consisting of four regiments of infantry, one regiment of cavalry, and two mountain batteries. Should the Government of India be reluctantly compelled by force of circumstances, and in pursuit of a policy to which they have from the outset been opposed, to send a force of this size to relieve detachment of cavalry aQShiraz, they are strongly of opinion that force should return to the coast from Shiraz with the least possible delay, and should bring away with them the cavalry detachments from Ispahan and Shiraz, members of Consulate, and any British subjects who might desire to avail themselves of British troops as escort to leave Shiraz. Main body of troops could then return to India, and Bushire could be held by a battalion of infantry until satisfactory redress has been received from Persian Government. We are not in favour of sending a regiment of infantry and battery of artillery to Shiraz, since the despatch of this inadequate force would present risks that should be avoided. If, as we have proposed, a battalion of infantry is to be despatched to Bushire, we should be glad of early orders. ^ vJLUVuyr' cL[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [52053/11] No. 1 . Foreign Office to India Office Sir, Foreign Office, January 1 , 1912. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, copy of a telegram from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, relative to the situation in Southern Persia.* It will be seen that in the opinion of His Majesty’s acting consul, in which Sir G. Barclay concurs, it will be necessary for the protection of His Majesty’s consulate at Shiraz that at least one battalion of infantry and a battery of mountain guns should be despatched to that place before the migration of the tribes in March, when some 15,000 armed men may be ready to engage in hostilities, while to undertake any punitive expedition and to keep open the Bushire Shiraz road, a force of four battalions of infantry and mountain guns would be required. It thus appears that a choice must be made between the policy of holding Shiraz in force, and keeping open the means of communication with the sea-coast, which would involve the employment of a very considerable force, and that of evacuating Shiraz and withdrawing His Majesty’s consul and British subjects from Ears. In view of the necessity of arriving at a decision on the subject as soon as possible, I am to request that Sir E. Grey may be furnished with an early expression of Lord Crewe’s views on the subject. A similar letter has been addressed to the director of military operations. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET. * Sir G. Barclay, telegraphic No. 757, December 28, 1911 [2329 a—11]Immediate. India Office, 1st January 1912. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for b oreign Affairs, copy of a telegram that has been received from the Government of India regarding the situation created in Southern Persia by the attack on Mr. Vice-Consul Smart, and the measures necessitated thereby. It would seem that matters have now reached a point at which it is impossible to take action in any direction without raising the whole question of British policy in Persia. This is a question primarily for His Majesty’s Government, and it is subject to this consideration that the following remarks are offered. I am first to observe that what appears to be of pressing importance is the situation at Shiraz. Whatever may be done at Bushire in the way of landing troops and seizing the customs, what has to be faced is the probability that before the end of March Shiraz will be surrounded by 15,000 tribesmen in a fighting temper. The immediate objective of our policy must, therefore, be to prevent a contingency that might threaten Shiraz, Ispahan, and Aezd with a common disaster. The Government of India are rightly opposed to the despatch to Shiraz of a battalion of infantry and a mountain battery. The policy of sending small bodies of men through highly disturbed country—to the danger of which attention has more than once been called by this Office—has already been shown to be futile, and is largely responsible for the present situation. The alternative proposed by the Government of India is to hold Bushire with a battalion until redress has been received from the Persian Govern ment ; to send 5,000 men to Shiraz, in the event of its isolation; and to bring away the detachments already there, the British Consul, and any British subjects who may wish to come. Assuming that the policy of His Majesty’s Government is still to maintain a strong and independent Persia, this proposal has much that at first sight is attractive and that might seem to counterbalance the grave disadvantages that must necessarily attend any withdrawal. But on examination it appears itself to be attended by disadvantages no less grave. In the first place it involves postponing until Shiraz is actually in danger a measure which it will probably take two months to carry out. In the second place, it involves the occupation and partial administration of Bushire for an indefinite time. It would be impossible to send the British Consul back to Shiraz and to evacuate Bushire until the Persian Government had inflicted upon the tribesmen that condign punishment which the Government of India regard as a difficult and dangerous operation for 5,000 men of the Indian Army. The Persian Government, even if they had a free hand, The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.2 have not the means of carrying this out within any reasonable time; it is impossible to foresee what complications in the north might hinder them even m well-meant attempts to do so, and it is moie than possible that they might, as on previous occasions, make the presence of foreign troops on Persian soil an excuse for not attempting the task while the presence of a single battalion at a town on the coast, even coupled with control of the customs, would afford us a minimum of leverage for moving them to efficient action. Moreover the eventual evacuation of Bushire on any terms short of complete satisfaction from the Persian Govern ment would itself bear the appearance of a defeat. Finally, it must be borne in mind that the question is not between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government alone. There are at Shiraz, Ispahan, and Yezd consular representatives and subjects of other Powers, including Russia; it is improbable that all of these would elect to withdraw with the British force ; and it is inconceivable that, if Great Britain showed herself unwilling or unable to protect them, Russia would fail to do so ; His Majesty’s Govern ment would be in no position to protest; and with the appearance of Russian troops m a region which though nominally neutral, has, m fact, been accustomed only to British troops in the past, the whole policy of the Under standing would be very gravely affected. The alternative would appear to be the immediate occupation in force of Shiraz, and the effective control of the road to Bushire. How strongly the Secretary of State for India feels the objections to any such course is sufficiently indicated in this Office letter of 16th October last. But the situation has entirely changed since that date. It is no longer a question of escorting caravans along the roads, but of ensuring the safety of British troops and subjects in Shiraz against overwhelming numbers, and of maintaining the prestige of this country in a sphere in which its influence has hitherto been predominant. With a brigade of infantry and a battery of mountain artillery at Shiraz, together with other troops sufficient to keep open their communications with Bushire, we should presumably be in a position to dictate both to the Persian Government and to the tribes the terms on which we would withdraw, and it would be worth their while not only to secure our withdrawal with the least possible delay, but to take such measures as would ensure that no similar occupation would ever be necessary again. It is not suggested that this course is free from disadvantages. It would not be popular in this country or in India ; it would be very expensive, though the cost of sending 5,000 men to Shiraz must in any case be great; there is the risk that so large a force at Shiraz might find itself drawn into punitive operations which should lie altogether outside its programme ; and it is always possible that, as indicated above in connection with the occupation of Bushire, the Persian Government might profess to regard its presence as a reason for not negotiating at all. As regards the question of cost, I am to say that whichever course is adopted the consent of both Houses of Parliament will be necessary (under 21 &amp; 22 Viet., c. 106, s. 55) before any part of the cost of “Military operations,” whether at Bushire or Shiraz, can be charged to Indian revenues ; and I am to suggest that in view of the obvious unpopularity of such a charge, and of the consideration that the maintenance of the Understandingwith Russia has become a matter of European rather than of purely Asiatic importance, the whole of the cost should be borne by the Imperial exchequer. I am to add for Sir E. Grey s information that the substance of the above observations have been telegraphed to the Viceroy and to the Marquess of Crewe. The further views they may express will be communicated to yon in due course. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Sgd.) R.

Grey the situation as depicted by Mr. Knox completely justifies the conclusion arrived at by His Majesty’s Government from the telegrams received in the autumn that some increase of the consular guards was necessary for the safety of His Majesty s consulate and Eritish subjects in the town of Shiraz itself. It shows, moreover, that the trouble which has now arisen is in no wav due to the increase in the escort recently dispatched to Shiraz, and that, even if a rescue of the British colony there has now to be effected, it would certainly have had to be effected, possibly even before now and under greater difficulties, if the increase of guards had not been sent three months ago. As regards Mr. Knox’s appreciation of the services of Mr. Smith, of the Indo- European Telegraph Department, of the sepoys and sowars attached to His Majesty’s consulate, and of the consulate munshi, I am to express Sir E. Grey’s earnest hope that their excellent conduct may be brought to the notice of the proper authorities m India, and to enquire whether, in Lord Crewe’s opinion, the case is not one in which some! mg more substantial than a mere commendation may fittingly be bestowed on the gentlemen and troops in question.

THE Director of Military Operations presents ms compliments to the Under secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and, in reply to his memorandum of tlm 2nd instant, begs to forward the enclosed paper embodying an expression of the opinion asked for. Whitehall, January 15, 1912. and Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum respecting Military Action m Southern Persia. (Secret.) . , . , • r- 1. THE Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs desires an early expression o± military opinion as to — ( 1 .) The policy to be pursued in view of the present situation in Southern Persia ; (2.) The military action required to give effect to the policy advocated. 2. It is presumed that the general policy of the British Government under the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1907 is to respect the integrity ^ and independence o Persia with due regard to the maintenance of peace and order m certain provinces oi that country in which Great Britain and Russia respectively have special interests. It is further understood that, owing to the internal condition of Persia, it was lately loun necessarv to dispatch a native cavalry regiment from India to protect the British consulate at Shiraz; and that, owing to a recent attack on Mr. Smart and the detachment escorting him to Shiraz, and also having regard to the attitude of the tribesmen in Southern Persia and the weakness of the Persian Government, militaiy action on our part may now be called for. . , ,, . - i + -l Bearing in mind that, though Shiraz lies m the neutral zone outside the British sphere of influence, British interests have always predominated theie, and that the Persian Government are-and for some time to come may be-incapable of controlling the country or of exacting reparation for the attac i. on i r. escort, the following alternatives appear to be open to us . (a.) To maintain our position in Southern Persia by dispatching a force'capable of occupying Shiraz, and of keeping our communications open between Shiraz a BUSh ( 6 e ) Temporarily to abandon our position in the western part of f^ern Persia, by closing the consulates at Shiraz and elsewhere, an wi raw g ’ , escorts, and British subjects (including the officers of the Indo-Euiopean Telegr p Department) to the coast. 3. While the maintenance of our position in the west “l^f^mfXantegel involve military difficulties and expenditure m addition to sue i p nntweio-hed as are inseparable from military intervention, these disa van ^? es ™ y abandonment by the political, commercial, and military disadvantages attendant on an abandonmei , —even of a temporary nature—of our position in that legion. . ^ The abandonment of our position in the west of Southern Persia [2329 g—4 ]2 T ( 1 .) Might mean a serious loss of prestige, both in Persia itself and the East generally^^d ^ losg ^ trade and trade connection, possibly permanently; (3 ) Would o-ive Russia an opportunity and a pretext for the military occupath^ of the neutral zoSe of Southern Persia to “ protect ” threatened interests and consulati She would thus gain in prestige, and to a great extent m trade, what we should lose. She has considerable military forces already in Northern Persia, and could quickly seize her opportunity; . „ . , x . (4.) MiMit also give other Powers a similar opening, to our detriment; (5 ) Might give Russia an opportunity of obtaining an outlet on the Persian Gulf, which it has hitherto been our policy to deny her. The attainment of an outlet on the seaboard of South-west Persia might be of great political and military advantage to Russia hereafter; x -r, -r • . (6 ) Would result in its being very difficult, if not impossible, for Great Britain to regain her former commercial position in South-west Persia, if that part of the country were once dominated by another Power. There is understood to be little likelihood of the Russian Government withdrawing its troops from Northern Persia till the country is settled and the Persian Government is itself able to maintain order. Even then it is not impossible that a variety of circumstances, fortuitous or otherwise, might indefinitely prolong the time deemed necessary by Russia for the retention of her troops in Persia. If, in existing circumstances, Great Britain temporarily abandons her^ interests m the neutral zone, she would have but little, if any, voice subsequently in putting a limit to the period of the occupation of that region by the troops of other Powers. Nor could she well protest against any measures adopted by such Powers to protect their own interests in Southern Persia, however disadvantageous such action might be to her hereafter. Having once withdrawn, it would be difficult for the British consulates to he re-established till reparation had been exacted for the late attacks, and order restored in the neutral zone; but it is possible that the Persian Government may not be in a position, or may refuse, to take the necessary action. 4. To maintain our position in South-western Persia it would seem necessary— (a.) To ensure the immediate safety of the British consulates and their escorts, as well as British subjects at Shiraz and elsewhere in the neutral zone ; (b.) To take such action as may safeguard our interests and prestige in the disturbed area till such time as the Persian Government can itself maintain order. It is stated on the authority of Mr .Acting Consul G. G. Ivnox, that in March there will be some 15,000 armed tribesmen in the neighbourhood of Shiraz, while in a later telegram the same officer estimates the number of tribesmen in Ears at from 50,000 to 60,000. 5. Recent events have shown the risks attendant upon the employment of small detachments of troops in the present disturbed state of the country. Local Persians are themselves of opinion that serious disorders amongst the Kashgais, and possibly other tribes, are practically inevitable in the spring, whilst the reports received from our own representatives in Shiraz point to the necessity of our being prepared for a serious outbreak of hostile feeling amongst the tribesmen, which, even if it does not vent itself in an actual attack upon our troops, might render their position at Shiraz extremely precarious owing to the ease with which communication with the coast could be interrupted and supplies cut off. Bearing in mind the nature and strength of the opposition that may possibly have to be encountered, the length of communications to be maintained (182 miles) in a mountainous country, and the question of supply and transport, it is estimated that a considerable force would be required in the event of its being decided to take military action. It is not yet known how many of the local tribes were concerned in the attack on Mr. Smart’s escort, but from the fact that Major Birdwood has been able to join hands with Colonel Douglas without any further fighting taking place, it may be inferred that there is not as yet any organised tribal revolt. It is not possible to forecast with any accuracy the force that may ultimately be required, but it would seem imprudent to attempt the task of safeguarding Shiraz, making good the lines of communication, and carrying out such punitive operations as may be found necessary with a smaller force than—er interests e yinpiii|i| other Poir osuhtetolf order restd ■ jnol’ ' Two mixed brigades of infantry, each to include a pioneer battalion; Two Indian cavalry regiments, including the one already in Southern Persia ; Two or more batteries of mountain artillery ; One field company of sappers and miners, with the necessary administrative services. 6 . It would also seem advisable to prevent the import of arms and ammunition into Persia by the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea. 7. Owing to the time necessary for preliminary arrangements, and for the dispatch and concentration of troops, transport, and supplies, and the likelihood of the country becoming increasingly disturbed in the spring, and in order to prevent the possibility of another Power forestalling us on the plea that their interests were not being- safeguarded, it seems important that if military action is to be taken at all, it should be taken promptly. 8 . Opportunity might perhaps be taken to improve the trade routes by military and hired labour, and even to train a local gendarmerie force. This would involve considerable expenditure. It might also be possible to carry out investigations in connection with railway routes. 9. Finally, it must be understood that from a military standpoint the permanent occupation by British or Indian troops of any part of the neutral zone is not recommended. The action now suggested would be of a purely temporary nature.. . [This Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Goymin^f i PERSIA. [January 22.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 7. [3072] No L India Office to Foreign Office.—(Received January 22.) g* r India Office, January 20, 1912. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant forwarding a despatch from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, dated 11th December last, regarding the recent disorders at Shiraz, and to say that he concurs in the views expressed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Mr. Knox’s despatch of the 20th October, read with Mr. Chick’s report of the Uth November (copy of which was included in the correspondence sent to your depart ment on the 1st instant), indicates, on the part of the Persian authorities and tribesmen, a degree of contempt for the representatives and subjects of Great Britain which is unexampled in a region where British influence has until recently been paiamount, and which, it is to be feared, will make the maintenance of British interests in the future a very difficult matter. . , v For the succession of outrages recorded in the correspondence mentioned above (which culminated in the organised attacks on Mr. Smart’s escort m December) His Maiestv’s Government, in their desire not to increase the difficulties of the -\ ers H n Government, have, so far as is known to this Office, not yet formulated to the Persian Government any statement of the reparation to be demanded ; and it has been decided that in present circumstances the evacuation of Shiraz is the best course to be pursued. It is suggested, with a view to maintain British interests m the regions concerned and to prevent the evacuation being interpreted as a permanent vmtoiy for the forces of disorder, that the nature of the reparation to be demanded of the Persi a Government should be considered and communicated to them at the same time as intention of His Majesty’s Government to evacuate Shiraz. Q -f-QT-xr With regard to the last paragraph of your letter I am to say that the Secret y of State for India has read with much pleasure of the good services rendered by Mr Smith and by the Indian troops, and he will not fad to bring them to no ice in proper quarter. But though he recognises that the circumstances were of ex^ptional difficulty he thinks that the grant of any tangible reward is not called for and would create an undesirable precedent. 1 am, &amp;c. LIONEL ABRAHAMS. [2329 y—7]From Viceroy, 23rd January 1912. {Repeated to His Majesty s Altfitster, Tehran.) ■ f P Tl' accordance with directions contained your telegram dated instant, H is Majesty s Minister at Teheran is being consulted. We consider lowever, to state our opinion before any specific action is takent appears to have become considerably easier since the alternative &lt; . wa f adumbrated. Arrival of party at Shiraz unmolested, and safe passage and treatment accorded along a parallel route to Mr. Chick have greatly mitigated the serious aspect which was then presented by reports of attack on Mr. Smart, hi auy oaocThe urgency, on which the above alternative / ff'-was based, ^ relief 0 f our military column at Shiraz does not appear to exist any longer. I he detachment could, with little risk, return via Ahwaz or (? and) Ispahan, should need arise. No impression of 'imminent necessity, moreover / w °/ Withdrawing our Consulate even from Shiraz, still less of need for evacua- / tion of other centres of rnkmior-fd) mentioned, is conveyed to us by recent information and expressions of view as to gravity of situation at Shiraz existing and prospective, which we have received from that place. We do not believe eithei, as at pi esent advised, that the several local situations in those places woidd be regarded by British and foreign firms or institutions represented there as justifying them in any way in leaving their posts and valuable properties and vested interests. We are inclined to think in fact that seriousness of present situation at Shiraz, and al—frdyJabb-dangor Ff developments next spring, have been over-estimated by our local officers; and it is our belief that by timely negotiation with tribes concerned, 'and by other means which should m owi opinion first be attempted, the danger can very probably be averted. Further, a serious endeavour to effect improvement in Shiraz and Shiraz road is being made by the Persian ‘Government, and the arrest of a large number of the persons concerned in the recent attack on our troops has in some way been effected by them, if a telegram received from them by Persian Consul-General here can be credited. Information also reaches us of actual departure for Shiraz of four Swedes. It woidd appear from these developments, if they are confirmed, that situation is less hopeless than anticipated, and that more effective action may be hoped for from Persian Government under Regent, than formerly when the Majlis hampered them. In the second place, wisdom of withdrawing Consulates, and thereby leaiHug in Central Persia a vacuum likely to be taken advantage of to our detriment by others, is becoming increasingly doubtful to our minds j and the aspect of the case might verge on the ludicrous, in the event of a force being despatched by us to withdraw Consulates without other British or foreign subjects. A war division less one brigade is considered by our military advisers to be the minimum force required to effect withdrawal ivdh di-gnfty from Shiraz alone ; and no one will believe, we are afraid, mere withdrawal of a Consulate to be our object in despatching a force of such strength. Our good faith will be further impugned if untoward and not improbable incidents leadlto f urther hostilities causaxg. with drawal to be delayed or impeded; and, in either case, Russia, will He affordedffJ-f &gt; a? v age omit/etl-j in the north, and f? passage -omiUetPfeffect unUfi be produced on Muhammadan opinion in India and elsewhere. We are strongly of opinion, in these circumstances, that His Majesty's Government should reconsider the question of withdrawal. As alternative, we recommend that negotiations with a view to satisfaction being exacted from those responsible for past incident, and to opening the road by levies of subsidised headmen, should be opened, with the tribes as suggested in our telegram dated the 11th instant. As a means of associating Persian Government with the scheme, the Swedish officers now reported to be starting for Shiraz might be employed to supervise such levies with assistance of British officer f. It is necessary, however, that present Khan of Borasjun should be punished or eliminated before there can be a commencement of negotiations. Persian Government should, we suggest, be at once called upon to depose him formally from Borasjun Governorship; if they fail to do this, it will be necessary for us to deal with him ourselves, a course of action in which, owing to Khan's accessibility from the coast, no serious difficulty is involved. it ne cessary, i /situation of evacuationu Sir, P. 232. (Immediate). India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W., 25th January 1912. reference to thls 0ffice ktter of the 1 st January last I a directed to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of further telegrams (dated 11th and 23rd instant) regarding the situation m Southern Persia. ' It will be seen that the Government of India do not consider the necessity for relieving Shiraz to be so urgent as to justify the despatch of a large force with a view to carrying out the policy of evacuation which has been approved by ills Majesty’s Government with the same data before them. It will further be seen that the Government of India deprecate the policy of withdrawal which they advocated in certain contingencies in their telegram o 31st December. On this head I am to refer to the views expressed in this Office letter of the 1 st January. As regards the alternative recommended by the Government of India, it is for consideration whether a scheme of subsidies—which might possibly have been successful when Sir G, Barclay suggested it in 1909—is now possible, when British troops have been defeated on the road and are viitually prisoners in Shiraz, unless it is preceded by the exaction of leparation so signal as to make clear to all concerned that it is something more than the payment of blackmail. This seems to be also the view of the Government of India, who further distinguish between reparation from the Persian Government and reparation from the tribes, a distinction important, not only because measures that will impress the one will not nececsarily impress the other; but also because (as pointed out by Sir G. Barclay in his telegram No. 55, of the 19th instant) while the Persian Government are generally responsible for the condition of affairs in Southern Persia, and cannot be allowed to evade their responsibility, the particular responsibility foi the outrages culminating in the attack on Mr. Smart, rests with the tribes. It seems to follow that the reparation to be exacted from the tribes—as a condition precedent to subsidising them—must be the most signal. But it seems doubtful whether the measure proposed by the Government of India is adequate for this purpose, since it seems doubtful whether the deposition of the Khan, whose headquarters are in the plains 28 miles from Bushire, wdl have a chastening effect on the tribesmen in the hills. There are four other considerations which the Government of India do not mention : — (1.) Ihe danger of undertaking, or forcing the Persian Government to undertake, retaliatory measures which will certainly irritate the tribesmen, when a small force is locked up in the heart of their territory ex hypolhesi beyond reach of relief. ( 2 .) The difficulty of carrying out such measures, or of holding the chiefs, if subsidized, to their obligations without an adequate backing of force. This backing is expressly excluded from the The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.Government o£ India’s proposals as regards Bushire, while as regards Kishm it is for consideration whether the location there of”a force too small to operate on the mainland is likely to afford sufficient leverage. ( 3 .) The possibility that the subsidised chiefs may not be able to control their own men, in view of the “ widespread anti-foreign feeling ” to which the Persian Government referred in their memorandum (see Sir G. Barclay’s telegram No. 2, of the 1st instant), and the inflammatory telegrams from the Muhammadan clergy urging the tribes and inhabitants to rise against foreign invasion which Muhammad Ali pleaded as his excuse (Sir G. Barclay’s telegram No. 39, of 13th January). ( 4 .) The high improbability that the four Swedish officers, however efficient, and however well supplied with funds by the Persian Government (a very doubtful point), will be able to organise a sufficient force before the movement of the tribes in March, which is the moment when danger is most to be feared. These considerations, taken together, seem to .suggest that the Govern ment of India’s proposals involve very great risk of a disaster at Shiraz if they are regarded as an alternative to the policy of withdrawal. There remains the question of blockading the coast in order to prevent the import of arms and ammunition. Sir E. Grey will doubtless agree with the Government of India and the Naval Commander-in-Chief that this is a measure which must sooner or later be undertaken. But it is to be feared that if it is put in force now the stoppage of supplies may cause the same irritation among the tribesmen there as it did among the Afghans on the Mekran coast and the tribes on the North-West Frontier of India, and may therefore seriously endanger the safety of Shiraz. It is a question, therefore, whether it should not be postponed unless a sufficient force to effect relief, if necessary, is within reach. In this connection it will be remembered that the Viceroy was instructed on the 23rd Copy of telegram enclosed. . 01 . ^ ^ , mstant, at Sir E. Grey s request, to proceed with the least possible delay to frame proposals for despatch of troops and as to number and composition of a relieving force. As regards the question of the cost of the blockade, I am directed by the Secretary of State in Council to say it is assumed that half the expenditure will be borne by Imperial revenues. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, R. Ritchie.(3.) From Viceroy, 5th February 1912. (Repeated to His AUjoutyo MinRtev niplushTre. Foreign Secret. Shiraz. Reference to your telegram of 31st Januarv generally approving our proposals While awaiting instructions regarding despatch of troops, location of which in the Gulf is an essential prelhninary to the inception of the proposed negotiations, we submit for general approval further _ details of the subsequent steps which we should contemplate taking m order to give effect to the scheme. We aim at achieving three objects :— (1.) To get the individual or individuals whom it is decided to hold responsible foi the attack upon Smart to settle accounts with us. (In this settlement it may or may not prove possible to include payment of cash indemnity, but presumably no specific amount will be claimed from Persian Government until the result of negotiations is known.) (2.) To induce persons above-mentioned and other headmen exercising control on the road to come to an agreement with us for the maintenance of order on it. To discount probability apprehended by His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz of dangerous tribal fighting in the spring in the neighbour hood of Shiraz. 6 As soon as troops embark from India we would propose to prepare the ground for negotiations by influencing English and vernacular Press and the Ulemas of Mesopotamia. To the former we recommend issuing of a full Press communique both in London and Calcutta briefly summarising outrages and robberies to which British subjects and merchandise have been subjected recently, and then going on to explain lines of fresh attempt we are about to make to find a solution short of intervention. As regards Ulemas of Mesopotamia, we would ask permission to instruct our Resident at Bagdad to make a full communication to them on same lines as the Press communique, and to endeavour to induce them to recant their recent incitations to the priests and headmen of Ears, and to telegraph to same individuals expressing their belief in desire of Great Britain not to intervene in Southern Persia, and urging them to placate her and promote the interest of their own country by friendly attitude to British subjects and commerce, and by co-operation for the maintenance of security on the caravan roads. It is a matter for consideration whether Regent or Persian Government should be pressed to telegraph in similar sense. In this connection we agree with Minister that we need say nothing at present regarding proposal to subsidise headmen, but it will be pointless to withhold from them the general exposition of our intentions which we communicate to the Press; and, therefore, subject to learning Sir G. Barclay’s views, we should recom mend his inducing them to make communication both to clergy of Nejef and Mullahs and extremists of Tehran as well as to the headmen on the road and the tribal chiefs, whom we are anxious to deter from fighting in the spring, urging them in the same sense as that set forth above. Simultaneously we would propose that His Majesty’s Consul-General should issue from Bush ire to all the headmen in Pars known to and in touch with the Consulate-General a brief exposition of British intentions and policy in Persia above his signature. The ground being prepared as above, Consul-General would then address headmen concerned in attacks on Smart and those interested in road explaining our intentions and inviting them, if they wish for a peaceful[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] PERSIA.

The sum named ( 4 , 734 Z.) seems to be generally suitable, and should be a first charge on the proposed loan. _ _ ^ It does not appear when His Majesty’s Minister proposes to present this demand, but I am to suggest, for Secretary Sir E. Grey’s consideration, that the situation, of which this incident was one feature only, should be treated as a whole, and that if it is intended to require of the Persian Government any other reparation or remedial action, a comprehensive demand should be made upon them. This course, it is thought, will better serve to impress them with the serious character of recent events m the view of His Majesty’s Government, as to which, after the long time that has elapsed without decisive action, they may be in some doubt; while if reasonable satisfaction is given by them, and such action as may be required of them is taken, the situation will be great y cleared. T 0 1 am, &lt;xc. R. RITCHIE. [2358 r—3J[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Governmmyfc] [13268] No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office,—(Received March 28.) Sir, India Office, March 27, 1912. WITH reference to your letter dated tlie 18tli instant, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward copy of a telegram received from the Government of India regarding the situation in Fars. There have from the beginning been two difficulties in dealing with that situation— (1) the difficulty of gauging the extent of the danger at Shiraz ; (2) the fact adverted to in my letter of the 25th January that measures, taken by His Majesty's Government to impress the Persian Government do not necessarily impress the tribes. As regards the first difficulty, the fear of a general attack on Shiraz which was entertained by Colonel Douglas on the authority of His Majesty’s consul, may now apparently be put aside, since His Majesty’s consul himself no longer entertains it. But the fact remains that, as pointed out by Colonel Douglas in his letter dated the 12th January, it would be very difficult to withdraw the cavalry regiment from Shiraz in the present state of feeling, and yet the regiment cannot be retained there indefinitely ; while Sir P. Cox has observed in his telegram of the 13th March that its withdrawal “ would involve an enormous loss of prestige in Southern Persia.” Here, however, the second difficulty arises, since the various pronouncements devised by Sir P. Cox to cover the regiment’s retreat would not, in Mr. Smart’s opinion, be taken seriously by the tribesmen. It seems essential, therefore, that some action should be taken locally that will, as far as possible, restore the prestige which has been lost during the last three months. Accordingly, while the Marquess of Crewe concurs with Sir E. Grey generally in the proposals made in your letter under reply, he desires to lay great stress on the necessity of requiring from the Persian Government—since His Majesty’s Government cannot undertake it themselves—the summary punishment of those who are well known locally to have been responsible for the attack on Mr. Smart’s escort. The evidence of a friendly attitude to be required on the part of the tribal chiefs should, in his opinion, necessarily include the surrender of these persons, and their punishment should be a necessary preliminary to the withdrawal of the cavalry regiment. His Lordship would also suggest that a condition of ultimate withdrawal should be an undertaking by the Persian Government to support the Swedish officeis by all means in their power in organising the force of gendarmerie. _ . . As regards the extension of the blockade, Lord Crewe is unwilling, m view of the opinion expressed by the Government of India, to press the objection suggested in my letter of the 25th January; but he would point to the recent threatened attack by tribesmen on Lingah in consequence of the capture of a cargo of arms as an example of the sort of danger to which Shiraz may be exposed. . . , Subject to these remarks, his Lordship agrees that negotiations should be begun with the least possible delay, and he will be glad to know if Sir E Grey wishes any statement to be made by the Governor-General of India as suggested by Sir P. Cox. I am, &amp;c. R. RITCHIE. March 23, 1912. Enclosure in No. 1. Government of India to the Marquess of Crewe. (Telegraphic.) P. PLEASE refer to your telegram dated the 8th instant. ...... It is not the case, according to our information, that there is deterioration in situation near Shiraz ; situation is, on the contrary, improving m Sir P. Cox s opinion We consider that Sir P. Cox, although he reports season to be too far advanced, shou d be authorised at any rate to negotiate without further delay, m conjunction wi consu , Shiraz, with resident headmen of tribes on road. It is not, m our opinion, still essential to preliminaries that troops should be sent to Basidu. Despatch of troops is [2397 ee—8] 1 ' COPY :O 1 28 APR 1912 I 7 C’2 rendered inopportune at present by improved attitude of Persian Government. Curtailment of supplies of ammunition will contribute to security, and there is no reason to think that extension of blockade will cause more irritation than in the past among tribesmen. _ . ^ ^ We consider that we should continue to press Persian Government to inflict ^ punishment on those responsible for attacks, and that payment of compensation by them should not relieve them of duty of doing so. We agree with Sir G. Barclay, in regard to question of retaining Shiraz and Ispahan consular escorts, that practical proof in near future of friendly attitude on part of tribal headmen along road should be the condition of reductions of consular guards. Presence of our cavalry escorts at Shiraz and Ispahan, who will be unable under present conditions to reach coast without danger of attack, is the one weak spot in our position. Until greater security prevails on roads they will clearly have to stay where they are.[This Doeument is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government] -t A spot nil s t a y4itf j [April 2.] Section 1, [13268] Xo -- 1 ' Sir Edward Grey to Sir G.

WITH reference to your telegram No. 232 of the 2nd instant, I have the honour to transmit copy of a note which I addressed yesterday to the Persian Government. You will notice that this note contains no mention of the scheme for direct negotiations with the tribal chiefs. No mention of this scheme had been made by me officially to the Persian Government, and I therefore thought it better to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs merely privately in the sense of the ante-penultimate paragraph of your telegram, and I wrote on the 3rd instant to the “ Chef de Cabinet,” who, as I reported in my telegram No. 218 of the 28th ultimo, had written to me on the subject, asking him to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the scheme of subsidising the local chiefs would not have been executed without the concurrence and approval of the Persian Government, and that the prestige of the Central Government would have been carefully safeguarded. You will notice also that in my note I merely, as regards the extremists, requested the Persian Government to restrain those persons in Tehran and elsewhere in Persia whose inflammatory telegrams had been largely responsible for the attacks on our troops, and that I did not insist on these persons recanting their telegrams. It seemed to me that to insist on the recantation of these inflammatory telegrams would have had the effect of giving the extremists an exaggerated idea of their importance, and I have said nothing about the removal of the Kawam from Fars. If later, on the arrival at Shiraz of the new Governor-General, it is still thought desirable that Kawam should leave Fars, the legation could endeavour to induce the Persian Government to give him a good post elsewhere.

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency’s note of the 10th ultimo, and to take act of the assurances that the sum of 4,744b will be paid out of the next loan. I am now instructed to make the following communication to the Persian Government:— His Majesty’s Government have carefully considered the whole situation in the south of Persia, with special reference to the recent attacks on the Indian troops dispatched from Shiraz and Bushire to escort Mr. Smart, His Majesty’s acting consul at Shiraz, who was returning from leave to his post. His Majesty’s Government consider it essential that the men who are well known locally to have been guilty of these outrages should be handed over to the Persian Government for punishment. If this is done, His Majesty’s Government will at once withdraw the detachment recently sent to Bushire ; and if the tribal chiefs and head men show a friendly feeling and peaceful attitude for at least two months, and no more outrages occur during that period, the withdrawal of the Indian cavalry reinforcements from Shiraz and Ispahan will follow. I am, however, to make the Persian Government understand that the continuance of this benevolent attitude on the part of His Majesty’s Government must depend on the proper establishment of a gendarmerie under Swedish officers, and the Persian [2440 5—1]2 Government must therefore undertake before the final withdrawal of the troops above mentioned to support the Swedish officers by all means in their power. I am also to request the Persian Government, as an initial and essential ^ep towards securing the peaceful and friendly attitude of the local chiefs, on which withdrawal of the above-mentioned troops depends, to restrain those mischievou. persons in Tehran and in other places in Persia whose inflammatory telegrams were so largely responsible for the attacks on our troops. It is also essential that the Persian Government should induce the clergy of Nejef and Kerbela to recant their recent incitations to the priests and headmen of Pars, and to telegraph to these persons expressing their belief in the desire of Great Britain not to intervene in southern Persia. The clergy should also urge upon the tribal chiefs and headmen the necessity of placating Great Britain by promoting British interests by a friendly attitude to British subjects and commerce. In conclusion, I am to emphasise strongly the necessity of sending the new Governor-General to Shiraz as soon as possible, and of giving him the full support of the Persian Government and supplying him with the necessary money. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY.Immediate. R 2716. India Office, 22nd July 1912. Sir, With reference to your letter No. 26,801 of the 25th June I am .directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a telegram dated 12th July 1912, that has been received from the Government of India regarding the retention of the Indian cavalry regiment at Shiraz. That regiment was sent to Shiraz for no other purpose than the protection of the life and property of British subjects which were believed to be in danger, and now that the danger has ceased to exist it would naturally be withdrawn but for the complications arising out of the attack on it while escorting Mr. Smart in December last. It appears from Sir W. Townley’s Despatch No. 123 of 18th June, and his telegrams Nos. 397 and 403 of 2nd and 7th July, that there is no ground to expect that our demands for reparation will be met within any reasonable time. In these circumstances Lord Crewe, having regard to the situation as a whole, would propose for Sir E. Grey’s consideration that our demands should not be pressed now in a manner that would increase in any way the difficulty of withdrawing the regiment in October, and is inclined to think that, in spite of the embarrassment that will be created at Shiraz, the regiment should then be withdrawn provided that there is then no real danger to life and property. But though His Lordship would no longer insist on the surrender and punishment of the culprits as the necessary condition of withdrawal, it is obviously desirable that the Persian Government should be encouraged to take measures such as those indicated in Sir W. Townley’s telegram, No. 415, of the 18th instant, and from this point of view His Lordship is inclined to regret that Sir E. Grey does not see his way to press for the appointment of the Zil- es-Sultan as Governor-General of Ears, as suggestedby Sir W. Townley in his telegram No. 402 of 7th July. It is true that he has an unenviable reputation for cruelty, but so long as the Persian Government are successful in purging the province, Lord Crewe does not think it possible to apply British standards to the methods employed by their officials. According to the information contained in Sir W. Townley’s Despatch, No. 116, of 17th June, and its enclosures, the state of insecurity on the Shiraz-Bushire road is worse, and the rates of blackmail levied are higher, than ever before. Lord Crewe would suggest that the necessity of airiving at an understanding with the tribes regarding the levy of blackmail should continually be pressed upon the attention of the Persian Government as a condition of the effective working of the gendarmerie.lv-\l [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Govemmonf ] PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [August 6.] Section 5. [31216] No. 1. Foreign Office to India Office. gj r Foreign Office, August 6, 1912. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo regarding the retention of the Indian cavalry regiment at Shiraz. . . I am to state, in reply, for the information of the Marquess of Crewe, that, m Sir E. Grey’s opinion, the retention of an inactive and useless force at Shiraz cannot, in the long run, help to preserve British prestige in Southern Persia. He is accordingly prepared to concur in the view of the Government of India that the regiment _ should be withdrawn in October, provided that there is then no real danger to life and property. ... . , As regards the possibility of re-establishing British prestige in the province ot Ears, he is prepared to take any measures that the Government of India or the_ local British officials can suggest which will not entail an expedition into the interior of the country. ^ . . .... It appears, therefore, to Sir E. Grey that at present the best course will be perpetually to keep before the Persian Government the urgent necessity of improving the situation in the south to the utmost of their power, and to support the Governor- General in any way that will really help him, subject to the above mentioned reserve regarding the dispatch of an expedition. In this connection, I am to state that Sir E. Grey would be glad to receive the views of Lord Crewe and of the Government of India on. the proposal contained m Mr. Smart’s despatch No. 9, Confidential, of the 23rd May (which forms an enclosure in Sir W.

Sir, In continnation of my letter No. 3,083, dated the 10th instant, I am directed by the Secretary of State for ludia to forward, for the information * Dated 21st August 1912. f tte Secretar y of State ^ foreign Affairs, copy of a telegram* that has been received from the Government of India regarding the situation in Pars. As was anticipated in that letter the Government of India consider it impossible to effect the withdrawal of the cavalry regiment from Shiraz without despatching a force into the interior, and it is noted that the Governor-General of Pars has himself stated that he could not guarantee the safe conduct of the regiment to the sea. The questions to be decided therefore, are :— (1.) Should the regiment be withdrawn by the despatch of a force in the manner proposed; (2.) If so, what should be the functions and strength of that force. In the Marquess of Crewe’s opinion the answer to the first question must depend on that given to the second. He observes that the Governor- General of Pars is apparently unwilling that the regiment should be withdrawn until reparation has been obtained, and though His Lordship is himself prepared to forego that condition, he is strongly of opinion that withdrawal should only be effected in such a manner as to reduce the inevitable loss of prestige to a minimum. This purpose will to some extent be served by the proposal of the Government of India to strengthen the consular guard at Shiraz, which Lord Crewe therefore recommends. But it can only be completely served if the relieving force is of sufficient force not only to overcome all opposition, but also to inflict serious punishment on the opponents. His Lordship is advised that it is inadvisable, alike on military and political grounds, to limit the relieving force to purely defensive tactics, as suggested by the Government of India, and that the force is indeed small —even dangerously small—even under such a limitation. It is, in his opinion, essential that if it is attacked, the commanding officer should be free to dispose it as he pleases and to take the offensive, to the extent, that is to say, of pressing home at his discretion any defeat he may inflict on the enemy after being attacked by them. Only by this means can the dangerous illusion of the tribesmen as to the inferiority of British arms be dispelled, and the withdrawal of the regiment saved from degenerating into a retreat. But for this purpose—which falls far short of the “ campaign in Southern Persia ” which the Government of India rightly deprecate—Lord Crewe is advised that the force proposed by them is quite inadequate, and in this connection he would invite attention to the Memorandum by the Director of Military Operations dated 15th January last. The Under Secretary of State Foreign Office.Holding, therefore, the view that withdrawal without reparation should only he effected on the condition described above, His Lordship would suggest that Colonel Douglas should at once be asked to telegraph to Sir E. Grey, and to the Government of India, a report on the situation, and to state his opinion as to the force required. I am to enclose draft of a telegram which, with Sir E. Grey’s concurrence, he would address to the Government of India in this sense. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, R. Ritchie.Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 30, 11'15 a.m.) (No. 487.) Tehran, August 30, 1912, 1’15 a.m. 1 HAVE just received, and am repeating to Shiraz for Colonel Douglas’s views, telegram from Government of India referred to in your telegram No. 538 of 26th August. I would venture to submit that there are, in my opinion, serious objections to of the tribesmen and excite fanatical resentment, as its object would be misunderstood and misrepresented. Under present conditions I doubt whether consul and British subjects at Shiraz are in any danger, but after the withdrawal situation of the force rendered vastly more difficult. 1 am firmly convinced that ultimate result would be an expedition on a larger scale and of more permanent nature. I share opinion expressed in your telegram that the force should be large enough to undertake punitive measures if necessary, but I would go further and respectfully suggest would entail disruption of Persia, but I am doubtful if a half-measure of the nature proposed would be less disastrous. Should it be decided to take military action, I would beg to support the views expressed by British consul-general at Bushire (see my telegram No. 403 of 7th July) that the Kazerun Valley should be held until such time as the gendarmerie can take over the road and the abuses of rahdari have been regulated. I am well aware that hopes venture to call attention to my telegram No. 463 of 19th August, which crossed your telegram No. 495 of 19th August. New Governor-General is now nearing Ispahan, and should reach Shiraz in ten or twelve days. I have some faith in him if he feels himself strongly supported by His Majesty’s Government. Kawam-ul-Mulk should leave Ears, and no bast should be given on any consideration to a political refugee. In your telegram last quoted you ask my opinion as to financing the Governor- General direct. I have considered this question carefully, and think that such action might have excellent results. Of the 10,000L recently advanced, 10,000 tomans were paid to the Governor-General to enable him to start and about 20,000 tomans remain in hand for his use on arrival. Were he given from 2,000L to 3,000Z. a-month. for a year he could make sure of a valuable military force which would enable him to maintain order. At the end of a year he should have established himself firmly in the province and be in a position to collect all the revenue necessary for the wants of his administration. I would suggest that the money might be paid through the treasurer- general to his agent in Shiraz and handed to the governor in concert with British consul. By this means Persian susceptibilities might be safeguarded in a measure, while none of the money would find its way into the pockets of certain pilfering Ministers. I would suggest that no steps be taken in this sense until we have had time to realise the effects of the military operations if it is decided to undertake them. (iVddressed to Foreign Office; sent to India, Bushire, and Shiraz.) scheme suggested by the Viceroy of India. It would rouse, I think, all the worst passions left there might well be a critical one. Existing difficulty of passing reliefs down ^ road would largely be increased, and the new Governor-General’s task would be that an expedition, if sent at all, should be punitive. I fear that such a step founded upon a new Governor-General have proved fallacious in the past, but I would [767 —1075]m [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] ,u&gt; PERSIA.

There could be only one result, m our opinion of military measures of above nature, viz., guerilla warfare for prolonged period, with occupation of Southern Persia as a very probable conclusion. We deprecate strongly any action likely to precipitate occupation, though it is a matter for conjecture whether it may be forced upon us in future. To have regiment for the present m Shiraz, and to do all m our power to facilitate new Governor-General’s task, appear to be the on y alternative. This course of action will give no cause for effervescence among Indian Mahommedans, while it will have the obvious advantage of being consistent with our avowed policy ot abstaining from military occupation and with our demand that perpetrators ot outrages on our troops should be punished. This course is therefore recommenoed by us in the hope that order may have so far been restored by new Governor-General in the space of a few months as to make it possible for our cavalry to proceed without incident to the coast. In the circumstances we deem it prudent that new Governor-General should be given a fair trial, though we cannot be sanguine of his success. Comfortable and adequate quarters should be provided for the cavalry if it is decided to retain them at Ispahan and Shiraz. xYssistance of Persian Government in obtaining such quarters on lease should be insisted upon ; construction of barracks at that Government’s expense will otherwise be necessary.

SAMSAM-US-SULTANEH, the Prime Minister, called upon me yesterday. It was evident that his Highness is suffering from the prevalent Russophobia epidemic, because, after discussing various other matters, he suddenly announced that the Bakhtiaris had realised that the Russians did not want them in Tehran any more, and that the time would soon come when he and his kinsmen would have to leave the Capital and retire to their own country. In saying this the Prime Minister suddenly became very bellicose, and declared that the Khans would have to recall all their young men who are studying military tactics abroad, and set to work to prepare an armed and disciplined force in their own country. He asked if His Majesty’s Government would give them British officers to organise such a force, and laid stress upon the depth of the friendly feelings that the Bakhtiari have felt for ages for the British people. He urged that a very respectable force of about 10,000 men could easily be recruited, which, under British officers, would form a stout bulwark in the Bakhtiari mountains against Russian aggression towards the south. He said that the moment had not yet come, but that the danger is sufficiently great to make it necessary to be prepared. . . , 11 i I assured his Highness that I felt sure that His Majesty s Go’veminent would much appreciate the feelings of sincere affection that he had expiessed foi Gieat Britain and its people, feelings that were warmly reciprocated by all who knew the gallant and warm-hearted tribesmen. I represented, however, that the situation did not appear to me to present any of the dangers he foresaw. England and Russia working m perfect union in an endeavour to improve the position of Persia in such a manner as would enable Russia to withdraw her troops from the northern sphere. Any such scheme as that he had suggested would necessarily have an opposite effect, although it might be just possible that His Majesty’s Government might accept his offer to provide a force to be organised by British officers for the purpose of restoring order and protecting the trade routes, should the present arrangements fail. I asked the Prime Minister if the idea he had expressed represented merely his own personal views or was he speaking in the name of his kinsmen. It seemed to me difficult and impolitic to entirely put aside this strange offer of an old friend in a manner that might hurt his feelings, hut I endeavoured to make it quite dear that Russia and Engla are co-operating cordially and loyally in an effort to res ore ersia , position of prosperity, and that I saw no reason as yet to think that our endeavo Samsam-us-Sultaneh replied that all the Bakhtiaris would like to fight under British officers, and that he realised the genuineness of British are based not only on sentimental grounds but also on conditions of self-interest, s . it is clear that an independent Persia is necessary for India conditions would have to maintain a largely increased army. He recognised tiiat t moment had not ^t come, but he felt that its possibility was sufficiently near to make “s^-stltreh Spoken to Mr. Churchill the previous evening in still more vehement language, saying that he felt spe the Bakhtiaris wou scm a leave Tehran, but that they would ^tire to their own mountains and die thge to tffe Eng The Prime Minister is as warm-hearted and hot-headed as an Mshman ^ easily swayed and led by persons and circumstances.

Foreign Office, December 12, 1912, 6T0 p.m. YOUR telegram No. 629 You should inform Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Government have received with the gravest concern the news of the deplorable event which occurred on 11th December. The murder of a British officer in the circumstances stated constitutes a situation which His Majesty’s Government cannot pass over. They must request the Persian Government to state without delay what reparation they are in a position to accord, and the reparation must include, among other conditions, the severe punishment of the tribesmen. If the Persian Government are not in a position to afford themselves the needful reparation, His Majesty’s Government will have to consider what steps they themselves should take for that purpose.CONFIDENTIAL.

I have no fuither details from the British consul, but I learn from the colonel commanding the gendarmerie that the major in command at Shiraz reports the inci dent, adding that two gendarmes were killed and one local rifleman wounded. It would appear from this that the gendarmes guarding the road were present, and it is possible that casualties occurred in endeavouring to protect the caravan, but all accounts say that the British party was attacked.
