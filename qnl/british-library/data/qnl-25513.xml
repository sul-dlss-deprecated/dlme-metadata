Persian Gulf lighting and buoying. | Political Secretary, For your remarks please. (SD.) W.RCBINSON. 11. 6. 1917. I have not been able to trace any particulars concerning Commander Finnis* deputation to England, beyond what is stated in the Director General of Store T s note of 1st February, 1915 (flagged). It would appear from that note that he was'to have returned to India on board the , ’ljearchus tt . I am not aware what led to his change of plan. The Treasury, after a great deal of correspondence, finally accepted a revised estimate of £37, 000 for the initial cost of the 'Nearehus', and I do not think/we could'^popose any increase, however small, to them at this time of day. I am not disposed to support the Auditor 1 s proposal. (SD.)

Colonel N.G.

As it appeared in the interests of thePublic service to do so and I myself have to go to Kubber Island to inspect the beacon end the whole trip could be done within 24 hours, I agreed to take him since his own launch has been taken from him tor use of the Expeditionary 'orce in the 3hatt-el-Arab. The weather however prevented my carrying out this trip, so having completed rr.y work at Kuweit and the weather showing no signs of improving I proceeded. I have the honour to request that when passing Kuweit with a few days in hand I may go in the harbour (Kuweit) and carry out the trip, to Has al Arz and Rubber Island as re quested by Colonel Grey. i lleseived on 9 OQ'{' 19 J 6 with INDIA FOBEIGN SECRETARY'S Letter.

Employment of ricaichut', Piret trip mentioned by Director, Royal Indian Marine, was on the face of it expressly connected v.in. lighting and buoying of the Persian Gulf and there seems to be no ground for debiting cost to any other head. Police work referred to in paragraph £ was conveyance Ql ^smaxi agitators from Bunder Rig and Eushire and was urgent war measure. I may mention that when addressing Government of India £ years ago regarding duties of piojectto ■-■uip I included in my original draft recommends** tion that she should be available on urgent requisition of Political Resident in Persian Gulf for short political missions as in case of His Majesty's Ship provided that it bo without Uiudue prejudice to buoying work. I omitted paragraph from final draft thinking that matter could be left to local arrangement. On such occasions there is no reason why cost of coal shoulu not be charged to Political Department but I earnestly deprecate application of water tight compartment principle adumbrated in concluding sentence of Director Royal Indian Marine's letter dated 4th August and especially its advocacy at present time. I would submit that at this juncture all miner departmental considerations should be merged in combined efforts to achieve utmost advantage to British arms and interests.

Copy of a letter from the Deputy Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the foreign and Politifal Department, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No.566-E.A., dated Simla, the 17th November 1915# I am directed to refer to your telegram No.l987-B., dated the 16th September 1915, regarding the employment of the R.I.M.S. 'Nearchus' on work unconnected with the Lighting and nuoying of t the Persian Gulf. 2. Ihe views of the director. Royal Indian Marine, who has been consulted, are briefly to the effect that the extracts given below from the diary of the officer commanding the Nearchus” show that the ship has not been able to keep the lights in an efficient condition:- Locality of Buoys. Outer Bar Gas Buoy Shat-el-Arab. Inner Anchorage Bahrain Gas Buoy. Kishm L.G-.B. l/iftien examined.

The lighted buoys are by no means satisfactory and require constant attention as may be seen from the enclosed synopsis of the work of the ,, Nearchus M since her arrival, and if they are to be maintained in an efficient condition the services of a whole time ship are necessary. The Birector, Royal Indian Marine, however, says that an urgent call on the vessel during a crisis would be a different matter and would naturally be met with willing promptitude.— V * 3. ns regards the proposed transfer of the control of the Nearchus” to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, the director. Royal Indian Marine, points out that the responsi bility for the efficient lighting, and buoyage of the Persian Gulf lies with him. To transfer the only means of maintaining efficiency to an officer who is on war service and is uncon cerned with lights and buoys, personnel, material or provisions, or anything to do with the lighting system may in practice prove unsatisfactory. Moreover, the officer commanding the ff Nearchus ,f is responsible to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, for the lights and buoys hut under the arrangement proposed he would be under the orders of fhe Senior Naval Officer. In these ' circumstances a difficult situation would arise, 4. As to the cost of coal only being debited to the Department concerned when the ,f Nearchus ,r is employed on work other than tkac that of lighting and hggyxyg buoyage of the Persian Gulf, it has been ascertained that the only chance the vessel has of undertaking small repairs, adjustments and care of boilers and machinery is during the short intervals that can be spared from her rounds of visits. Should these opportunities have to be given up to meet political necessities, the life of the ship and machinery will be very much curtailed and her repairs bill when she visits a dockyard will be largely in excess of the estimated amount for yearly upkeep. If the 'Nearchus' is to give a satisfactory return of services and be administered aricikia within the budget sanction, she should be kept to her legitimate duties as far as possible. 5.

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN AND POLITICAL DEPARTMENT SECRET. External? To THE RIGHT HONOURABLE AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Delhi, the 21st January 1916. Sir, We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your predecessor’s despatch No. 34», Political, dated the 2 nd April 1915, on the subject of the ex penditure involved in the provision and maintenance of the lighthouse tender “ Nearchus ” in connection with the lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf. 2. The correspondence received with the despatch referred to above shows that the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury have accepted a revised estimate of £37,000 for the total initial cost of the lighthouse tender, but as regards the estimated recurring cost of the vessel the Lords Commissioners desire to be furnished with some explanation of the causes of the increase of Es. 9,962 (£664) per annum over Mr. Hood's estimate, and we are asked to furnish any observations we may have to offer on the subject to supple ment those contained in our telegram of the 13th November 1914. Your predecessor mentioned that a point calling for an explanation was the discrepancy between the cost of the proposed establishment of the tender as esti mated in our telegram of the 13th November 1914, viz., Rs. 43,956, and the origin al estimate of Es. 40,000 given in our telegram of the 2nd November 1912. Lord Crewe added that it was presumed that the increase in the final estimate (£2,930-8; over that furnished by the Director, Eoyal Indian Marine, in his letter No 400, dated 18th January 1913, was due to the difference in the strength of the complements on which the two estimates were respectively based, and we were asked to state more fully the reasons which led us in November 1914 to discard the cheaper proposals favoured by Captain Lumsden in January 1913 and to revert to a scale of establishment practically equivalent toAhat^o^; templated in 1912. : FEBtSiGMarine, who represented that the establishment then proposed was essential for the efficient performance of the various duties to be carried out by the tender.

With regard to recurring expenditure in connection with the Nearchus. it will he seen that the Lords Commissioners have asked for further explanations of the increase of Rs. 9,962 (6645) per annum over Mr. Hood’s estimates, which was sanctioned by my telegram of the 12th January 1915. I shall 1 je glad to receive by mail, for communication to their Lordships, any observations you may have to offer on this subject in supplement to those contained in 4 our Excellency’s telegram of the 13th November last. 3. One point calling for explanation appears to be the discrepancy between the cost of the proposed establishment of the tender as estimated in your telegram of the 13th November, viz., Rs. 43,956 (2,9305 8 s.), and the original estimate of Rs. 40,000 (2,6665 13s. 4(5) given in your telegram of the 2nd November 1912, which provided for a complement of equal strength, viz., that recommended by the Director, Royal Indian Maxine, m paia- graph 4 (12) of his letter to this Office No. 5968 of the 31st August 1912. 4. The increase in the present estimate (2,9305 8 s.) over that given by the Director, Royal Indian Marine, in his letter No. 400 of the 18th January 1913, viz., 2,3685, is presumably to be accounted for by the difference m the strength of the complements on which the two estimates are respectively based. But I should be glad to be informed more fully of the reasons which led you, m November last, to discard the cheaper proposals favoured by Captain Lumsden in January 1913, and to revert to .a scale of establishment practically equivalent to that contemplated in 1912. 5 Copy is enclosed of two Minutest by the Naval Architect to this Office t-ioi n/r i ioi“ discussing the above points, t Dated 4th and 12th March 191i&gt;. &amp; I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Crewe.

Sd.) on the sanctioned estimate (5,000?. -- Us. 75,000 per annum ) for total recurring expenditure in connection with the vessel. The Secretary of Statehn Council is satisfied that the complement proposed by the Government of India is reasonable and could not be reduced without loss of efficiency ; and, as the Government of India have since pressed lor early orders on the subject, he has sanctioned their recommendations in anticipation of Sir E. Grey’s concurrence. His Lordship trusts that in the circumstances the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury will agree to bear halt the additional recurring cost involved, viz. 532?. Is. 4c?. per annum. I am to add that the Secretary of State in Council recently sanctioned, without previous reference to your Department, further additional expenditure to the estimated amount of 1 , 200 ?. initial and 100 ?. per annum, recurring, lor the installation of wireless telegraphy on the lighthouse tender. A iurtoer outlay, probably not exceeding 100 ?. in all, will also be incurred on account of the wages, return passage, &amp;c. of a wireless operator who is accompanying the Nearelms on her outward journey as far as Bombay. 1 he importance of equipping the vessel with wireless was strongly impressed upon the Secretary of State both by the Government of India and by his own technical advisers; and the advantages of such an arrrngement scarcely admit ol dispute. _ But His Lordship greatly regrets that the item was not included in the original estimate, and was not brought to his notice until the construction of the vessel was on the point of completion, when it was impossible, without serious delay and inconvenience, to postpone a decision pending a reference to the Treasury In the circumstances the Secretary of State m Council saw i alternative but to sanction the proposed expenditure on his own responsibility. Further items of additional initial expenditure which it has been found necessary to incur include ISO?, for improved arrangements lor the storage of acetylene gas buoys, and 5027. 13s. bd. for insuring the vesse! agamst war risks as well as certain smaller charges amounting in all to about 140?. Vs a nett result, after allowing for the various increases enumerated above, the total initial cost of the Nearchns may now be estimated at approximate y o 7 oo ()7 or an excess of not quite 2,5007, over the estimates L&gt;4,0007. plus 532? = 31,532?.), to which the approval of the Lords Commissioners o le TvooVnrv was conveyed in your letters of the 22nd September 191 o No. 11,odd, fd I I th Anril 1914 No 15,829.

The present estimate of 5,6647. 2 s. 8 c/. appears to exceed the 5,000/. because the estimate for the complement is 562/. more than the largest previous estimate for complements The history of the estimates is as follows - f- f r, 1 u ect0r ’ Indian Marine, in his letter of 18th January 1913 estimated the annual cost of upkeep at 6,450/., as follows : 3 ’ £ - 2,368 Pay of establishment Provisions Coal Stores Repairs Miscellaneous 682 ) 2,000 | 700 / 4,082/. 600 j 100 J 6,450 The officers apparently comprised Commander, two sub-lieutenants ounner one engineer, two assistant engineers or drivers, and 48 crew allthat are mentioned, one engineer, one 54 crew. J lie oiiginal proposals were Commander, three lieutenants, assistant engineer, two warrant officers, three drivers, and By his telegram of 1st April 1913, he reduced the annual cost of upkeep to 5,000/. using coal, or 4,740/,. using oil. The letter* confirming the telegram * Not received. * s not anion g the papers, so that it does . . • 110 t appear how the 5,000Z. is made up, but the reduction is said to lie due to the reduced number of lighthouses, and therefore largely to reduced fuel expenditure. In my minute of 14th July 1913 it was said that the annual cost of upkeep (of vessels to design decided upon) would be less that 5 , 000 /, as stated by the Director, Royal Indian Marine. I he Viceroy s telegram of 13th November 1914, which forms the basis of the present minute, gives complement of Commander, one lieutenant, two sub-lieutenants, two engineers, one assistant surgeon, one gunner, one clerk, and 58 crew. The cost is given as :— £ s. d. Establishment - - 2,930 8 0 Coal (oil), stores, &amp;c. - - 2,733 14 8 5,664 The increase appears to he mainly due to pay of establishment, Avhich is 562/. 8 s. more than proposed in the estimate of 6,450/, in the Director, Royal Indian Marine’s, letter of 18th January 1913. The complement was presumably not increased in the estimate of 5,000/. in the telegram of 1st April 1913. The complement now recommended by the Director, Royal Indian Marine, appears to have reverted to that originally proposed in his first letter on the subject dated 31st August 1912, so that the present increase of 562/. 8 s. requires explanation from India. ENCLOSURE No. 4: -Minute by the Naval Architect and Engineer \ 2 th March 1915. dated. The original estimate of cost of upkeep given in the Government of India telegram of 2nd November 1912 was superseded by the later estimates contained in the Director, Royal Indian Marines, letter oi 18th January 1913, and telegram of 1st April 1913. There is no reason why the discrepancy between the estimate for pay of complement given in the telegiam of 13th November 1914, amounting to 2,930/. 8 s., and the original estimate of 1 , 666 /, 13s. 4 d for practically the same complement, should not be referred to the authorities in India, who alone are in a position to explain it.

The telegram of 1st April 1913 giving a total cost of upkeep of o,0001 also presumably contemplated the same complement as m the letter o] ; ^ l h January, the savings being due to reduction in the vessel s services.

In paragraph 15 of onr Army despatch No. 50, dated theh 26th May— 1915, we stated that a sum of Es. 78 on account of overtime allowance for the first operator on board the E. I. M. S. “Nearchus” should he added to the estimate of cost of the provision of a wireless telegraph installa tion on that vessel. It appears from Sir A. Hirtzel’s letter, dated the 17th July 1915, to the Foreign Office, that a moiety of this additional charge will he borne hy the Imperial Exchequer only for the period of the war. We would, however, point out that wireless ^operators, employed on hoard Eoyal Indian Marine vessels are entitled to an overtime allowance whenever they work beyond two hours on a Sunday. The grant of this allowance to the first ^ operator on the “ Nearchus” is not, therefore, a war emergency measure as it will have to be continued after the termination of the war.

The Director, Royal Indian Marine, now reports that this sum did not include an allowance of Rs. 78 per annum on account of overtime allowance for the operator for Sundays. Our estimate of Rs. 1,500 should there fore be increased to Rs. 1,578 per annum which includes Rs. 1,808 on account of extra duty pay and allowances, of the operator, the balance being the cost of upkeep of the installation. The services of a second wireless operator are now required to admit of day and night watch in connection with the Light ing and Buoying Administration in the Persian Gulf. We have sanctioned his appointment during the period of the war only, at an additional cost of Rs. 1,128 per annum. The reduced estimate on account of the second operator is due to the fact that he is not entitled to a charge allowance of Rs.

I. K. S. 'iiearchus' took over her duties. I regret that, owing first to the absence of records ana then to other urgent pre-occupations since receipt of them, the Government of India's reference has remained unanswered until now. I beg to submit the lollowing ooseiVcitions .— 2. The work of the 'Hearchus' will be very responsible and experience will count for a great deal; I venture to hope that the Commander will always be an officer of some senxont and not liable to be so frequently changed as has been the case as a rule with the Commanders of R.I.L.S. 'Lawrence”. Perhaps a fixed period could be attached to the post; if net 5 years then at any rate three. It is possible m view oi current developments that at no distant date it may be desirable to place the administration of the lighting and buoyage scheme in the Persian Gulf in the hands of a special Officer with head-quarters at Basrah, who might perhaps combine these functions with those of Chief Port authority at Basrah, Tlnst however is a matter for future discussI merely mention it in case it should he necessary at some future date to take up this aspect of the question. 3. As regards the question of the position of the Resident in the Persian G-ulf in relation to the scheme in working, I would ask that it he definitely laid down that whilst the Commander of R.I.L.S. 'Nearchus' is under the administrative control of the Director Royal Indian Marin* and takes his orders from that officer, he should act in consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and other Political Officers concerned, in all matters having a direct or indirect political hearing, such as arrangements for guards for lighthouses, employment of contractors etc. on shore, altering position etco of huoys and work of any sort on beacons etc. on shore; all such changes should he notified beforehand when practicable to the Resident and Political Officers concerned so as to enable them to communicate the proposed alterations to Foreign Consuls and Shipping Agents before they are actually effected.

The Secretary of State in Council is satisfied that the complement proposed by the Government of India is reasonable and could not be reduced without loss of efficiency ' and, as the Government of India have since piessed loi early orders on the subject, he has sanctioned their recommendations in anticipation of Sir E.

IIis Lordship trusts that in the circumstances the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury will agree to bear half the additional recurring cost involved, viz. 332/. \s. 4cZ. per annum. I am to add that the Secretary of State in Council recently sanctioned, without previous reference to your Department, further additional expenditure to the estimated amount of 1,200/. initial and 100/. per annum, recumng for the installation of wireless telegraphy on the lighthouse tender. A Lu rtfiei outlay, probably not exceeding 100/. in all, will also be incurred on account of the wages, return passage, &amp;c. of a wireless operator who is accompanying the Nearchus on her outward journey as far as Bombay.

The present estimate of 5,664/. 2s. 8 d. appears to exceed the 5,000/. because the estimate for the complement is 562/. more than the largest previous estimate for complements. The history of the estimates is as follows :— Ihe Director, Royal Indian Marine, in his letter of 18th Januarv 1913, estimated the annual cost of upkeep at 6,450/., as follows : £ Pay of establishment - _ _ *&gt; quo Provisions - - _ _ . c °al - - - - '-o 000 ! « tores ' - - - 700 4,082*.

These are allthat are mentioned. J he original proposals were Commander, three lieutenants, engineei, one assistant engineer, two warrant officers, three drivers, and 54 crew.

The Viceroy’s telegram of 13th November 1914, which forms the basis of the present minute, gives complement of Commander, one lieutenant, two sub-lieutenants, two engineers, one assistant surgeon, one gunner, one clerk, and 58 crew.

The complement was presumably not increased in the estimate of 5,000/. in the telegram of 1 st April 1913. The complement now recommended by the Director, Royal Indian Marine, appears to have reverted to that originally proposed in his first letter on the subject dated 31st August 1912, so that the present increase of 562/, 8 , 9 . requires explanation from India. ENCLOSURE No. 4 Minute by the Naval Architect and Engineer dated 1 2th March 1915.

DATED 4th MARCH 1916. The present estimate of £5664: 2: 8. appears to exceed the £5,000 because the estimate for the complement is £562, more than the largest previous estimate for complements. The history of the estimates is as follows:- The D.R.I.M. in his letter of January 18th, 1913, estimated the annual cost of upkeep at. £6450, as follows:- Pay of establishment £2368. i ii - s Provisions 682* u!;! ; Jl f Coal 2000 1 *11 Stores 700 f £4082. 'ji | Repairs 600 j-ju i ! Wm Miscellaneous 100^ £6450. The Officers apparently comprised Commander, 2 sub lieutenants, gunner, 1 engineer 2 assistant engineers or drivers and 48 crew. These are all that are mentioned. The original proposals were Commander, 3 lieutenants, 1 engineer, 1 assistant engineer, 2 warrant officers, 3 drivers and 54 crew. By f'V/y, Jr/ / V. By his telegram of April 1st, 1913, he reduced the annual cost of upkeep to £5000 using coal, or £4740 using oil. The letter confirming the telegram is not among the papers, so that it does not appear how the £5000 is made up, but the reduction is said to be due to the reduced number of lighthouses and therefore largely to reduced fuel expenditure. In my minute of July 14th, 1913, it was said that the annual cost of upkeep (of vessel to design decided upon) would be less than £5000 as stated by the D.R. I.M. The Viceroy^ telegram of 13th November, 1914, which forms the basis of the present minute gives complement of Commander, 1 lieutenant, two sub- lieutenants 2 engineers, 1 assistant surgeon, 1 gunner, 1 clerk and 58 crew. The cost is given as:- Establishment Coal, (oil), stores &amp;c. £2930: 8: 0. 2733: 14: 8. £5664: 2: 8 The increase appears to be mainly due to pay of establishment which is £562: 8: 0. more than proposed in the estimate of £6450 in the D.R. I.M's letter of JanuaryJanuary 18th, 1913. The complement was presumably not increased in the estimate of £5000 in the telegram of April 1st, 1913. The complement now recommended by the D.R.I.M. appears to have reverted to that originally proposed in his first letter on the subject dated August 31st, 1912, so that the present increase of £562: 8: 0. requires explanation from India.%■J ^' •''OPY fflNUTE BY THE NAVAL ARCHITECT AND ENGINEER DATED 12th I.!ARCH 1915. The original estimate of cost of upkeep given in the Government of India telegram of November 2nd 1912 was superseded by the later estimates contained in the Director, Royal Indian Marine's letter of January 18th, 1913 and telegram of April 1st, 1913. There is no reason why the discrepancy between the estimate for pay of complement given in the telegram of 13th November 1914, amounting to £2930:8:0 and the original estimate of £2666:13:4 for practically the same complement, should not be referred to the authorities in India, who alone are in a position to explain it. The real point, however, which appears to require explanation is the increase in the present estimate of £2930:8:0 for pay of complement over the estimate of £2368 given in the Director, Royal Indian Marine's letter of January 18th, 1913. The telegram of April 1st, 1913 giving a total cost of upkeep of £5000 also presumably%contemplated the same complement as in the letter of January 18th, the savings being due to reduction in the vessel*s services. This point also the authorities in India alone are in a position to explain.r * » * Oorjy • m. 7683 • TUI.M.T&gt;*okyfUvt, From Ta Bombay B3rd T)a 'ember 191^ The Director of the Hoyal Inhian Marina The Baeratary to the Oovarnmant of India, Marina Dapartmant.

Coi’ee., 6 JAN1915 \ on. e- 1 , O | ^ J CAyy\AAe^\jj With reference to correspond ence ending with your letter of 11th April 1914, No. 15829, as to the provision of a lighthouse tender (the 'Nearchus') for ser vice in the Persian Gulf, I am directed by the S.of S.for I in C. to enclose herewith, to be laid before the S. of S. for P.A., copy of a telegram from the Viceroy submitting recommendations in regard to the complement of the tender which entail an increase of Rs. 9962 (£664. 2. 8) on the sanctioned estimate (£5,000 = PvS. 75,000 per annum) for total recurring expenditure in connexion with the vessel. The S. of S. in C. is satis fied that the complement proposed by the G. of I. is reasonable and could not be reduced without loss of efficiency; and, as the G. of I presstag for early orders on the subject, he has sanctioned their recommendations in anticipa tion of Sir E. Grey’s concurrence. P.L. trusts that^the LTcTof the T. will agree to bear half the addit ional recurring cost involved, viz s X £332. 1. 4 per annum. I am to add that the S. of S. in C. recently sanctioned, without previous reference to your Dept., furtherfurther additional expenditure to the estimated amount of £1,200 initial and £100 per annum t recurring for the installation of wireless telegraphy on the lighthouse tender. A further outlay, probably not exceeding £100 in all, will also be incurred on account of the wages, return passage, &amp;c. of a wireless operator who is accomf*^^ the 'Nearchus' on her outward * journey as far as Bombay. The importance of equipping the vessel with wireless was strongly impressed upon the S.of S. both by the G. of I. and by his own technical advisers; and the advantages of such an arrangement scarcely admit of dispute. But R.L. greatly regrets that the item was not included in the original estimate and was not brought to his i notice until the construction of the vessel was on the point of completion, when it was impossible, without serious delay and inconvenience, to postpone a decision pending a reference to the Treasury. In the circumstances the S.of S. in C. saw no alternative but to sanction the proposed expenditure on his own responsibility. t j Further items of additional initial expenditure which it has been found necessary to incur include £180 for improved arrangements for the storage of acetylene gas buoys and £502. 15. 5 for insuring the vessel against war risks, as well as certain smaller charges amounting in all to about £140. As a nett result, after allowing for ^the various increases enumerated above,the total initial cost of the 'Nearchus* may now be estimated at approximately £37,000, or an excess of not quite £2,500 over the estimates (£34,000 plus £532 ' £34,532) to which the approval of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury was conveyed in your letters of the 22nd September 1913 No. 41533, and the 11th April 1914 No. 15829. The S. of S. in C. trusts that, in view of the explanations given in this letter, the L.C.of the Treasury will accept a moiety of the excess cost, viz: ^ tzfo a sum of as a charge upon - the British Exchequer.%%- C*Jky ^ U' / Jr i4^' ,. tt ^ jo*** left \ -% COPY OF TELEGRAM.

One thing that both Sir Percy Cox and Admiral Slade were very strong on was an auxiliary boiler for- use when steam is not on the main boiler. This can easily be put in the new design, but on asking them whether they thought an auxiliary boiler was necessary in the lighthouse tender, they both were very strongly insistent on the necessity of it. They say that be boat will be in the aggregate lying without stream for about one-fourth of her tine, and as she has only one boiler, which must occasionally be under repair or cleaned, I am having the matter looked into very closely to see what it would cost to fit an auxiliary boiler. The auxiliary boiler can be fitted to use oil. It would save great wear and tearjof the main boiler, which could be much better looked after by being more often cleaned and overhauled, and would probably decrease the cost of upkeep of the ship. In this very hot climate they would want to keep the fans running as much as they could, and if there is no auxiliary v Niauxiliary boiler the main boiler would have to be under steam all the time. In addition to that the refrigerator must be kept for at least six hours during the day so as to get the brine doum to the required temperature. The cost will be £532. I shall be glad if you will advise me what to do in this matter.wsmmm hr In any furtli^-commuiiication on this pleash- ciuole 41533 / 13 . and address— The Urider-Seeratary of State, Foreifeh Office, London.

In the thiid paragraph of that letter their Lordships indicated their willingness 3 accept as a charge on the British Exchequer a moiety of the cost of purchase (not xceeding 30,000Z.) of a lighthouse tender. In accordance with that sanction designs ave been prepared with the strictest regard to economy, indeed (as the Marquess of Jrewe is satisfied), with a tendency to sacrifice efficiency to economy. Quotations were ailed for, but as will be seen from the enclosed memorandum by the Director- leneral of Stores—the lowest tender for a suitable vessel is for 32,250Z., which, after revision is made for the alterations considered necessary by the Director of the Royal ndian Marine and the Consulting .\ aval Architect to this Cffice, will bring the total ost up to approximately 34,000Z., to which sum it is now desired to obtain the sanction f the Treasury. His Lordship regrets that the original estimate should be exceeded, but it was aade by Mr. D. W. Hood (as the Lords Commissioners will remember) as long ago as 909, and, as their Lordships will be aw r aie, during the last few years there has been very marked rise in prices in the shipbuilding trade in this country. In three recent ases that have come before Lord Crewe for sanction the increase in the estimates due olely to this cause has ranged, between 1909 and 1913, from 13 per cent, to !5 per cent. In these circumstances he trusts that the Lords Commissioners will gree to the expenditure of the additional sum proposed. I am to ask for an early reply. I am, &amp;c. T. W. HOLDERNESS. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Memorandum by the Director-General of Stores, dated July 23, 1913. QUOTATIONS for the supply of the lighthouse tender for the Persian Gulf have low been received and are attached. The lowest suitable offer is from Messrs. Beardmore and Co., design No. 2, price 30,400Z. for delivery in this country, with a further charge of 1,850Z. G°! a l 32,250Z.) for navigation to Bombay. A proposal has been made by the Director of the Royal Indian Marine to send home a navigating party to take the vessel to Bombay, but after discussion with that officer it has been agreed that the proposal is hardly practicable, and that the navigation should be undertaken by the builders of the vessel. In designing the vessel every endeavour has been made to keep the cost within e limit of 3O,000Z. It is impossible, however, to obtain a satisfactory boat for this Imi, and, in fact, the vessel now offered, although not unsuitable, is not in complete accordance with the requirements asked for by the Director of the Royal Indian arine. On one particular point both the naval architect and the Director of the yal Indian Marine lay great stress. They consider that the length of the vessel ould be increased by 10 feet, at an extra cost of 995Z. The cost of the vessel would len be 33,245Z., to which must be added Sir J. H. Biles’s fee. This fee would be at je rate of 2^ per cent of the cost, or 750Z. if the increased length is approved. r lhe Stal cost would thus be about 34,OOOZ., or 4,000Z. in excess of the limit originally ed. [1825 y—5]matter.

Si r, I am directed by the S. of S. for India to advert to the letter from the L. 0. of the Treasury dated 13th Feb. 1912 which formed the enclosure in your letter No. 6521 of 20th Feb. 1912 regarding expenditure on lighting and buoyage in the Persian Gulf. In the third para, of that letter their lordships indicated their willingness to accept as a charge on the British exchequer a moiety of the cost of purchase (not exceeding 6630,000) of a lighthouse tender. In accordance with that sanction designs have been prepared with the strictest regard to economy, indeed (as the Marquess of Or ewe is satis fied) with a tendency to sacrifice efficiency to economy. Quotations were called for, but - as will be seen from the enclosed memo, by the D.G. of Stores - the lowest tender for a suitable vessel is for *632,250, which, after provis ion is made for the alterations considered necessary by the Director of the R.I.M. and the Consulting Naval Architect to this k m 1this Office, will bring the total cost up to approximately *£34,000, to which sum it is now desired to obtain the sanction of the Ereasury. His Lordship regrets that the original estimate should be exceeded, but it was made by Mr. D.W.Hood (as the Lords Commissioners will remefnber) as long ago as 1909 and,as their lordships will be aware ? during the last few years there has been a very marked rise in prices m the shipbuilding trade in this country, .In three recent cases that have, come before Lord Crewe for sanction the increase in the esti\ mates due solely to this cause has ranged, between 1909 and 1913, from 13% to 23%. In these circumstances trusts that the Lords Commissioners will agree to the expenditure of the additional sum prvjosed. I am to ask for an early reply. (sd) T. LcMviiczs.

India Office, a . 2nd March 1912. bir, In continuation of the lettej from this Office, dated the 27th r ebruary 1912, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to state, for the confidential information of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House, that as a result of correspondence with the Foreign Office, the Admiralty! and the Treasury, it has now been decided, subject only to the assent of the last-named Department in respect of the light-vessel for the Shatt-al- Arab, to provide and maintain in the Persian Gulf the lights and buoys set out in the list enclosed. / 2. In reply to an inquiry by the Secretary of State as to the plant to be oi cl ere d from this country, the Government of India have suggested in a telegram, dated the 9th February, that Mr. D. W. Hood should be asked to advise, since no definite information is m their own possession as to the designs and requirements of the several lights and buoys beyond what is contained in Mr. Hood s Report. The Marquess of Crewe would be greatly obliged if this suggestion could be acted on, and a statement be prepared for transmission to the Government of India showing in the case of each item of the list, whether lighthouse, light-vessel, or lighted or unlit buoy, what plant it would seem best to procure and send out from England. n. In addition to the lights and buoys, the questions of a lighthouse tender and of a depot, have also been considered. It has been found impracticable to adapt as a tender any existing vessel, and, subject to further consideration when an accurate estimate has been framed, the Government of India have recommended the construction of a separate tender, for which, it is under stood, the Director of the Royal Indian Marine is now preparing an estimate. The estimate of Mr. Hood was, it will be remembered, 30,000k for initial, and 5,000k for annual recurring expenditure, but Lord Crewe proposes to draw attention to the desirability of effecting a reduction in these figures, and meanwhile he would be glad to learn, for the assistance of the Govern ment of India in preparing their estimate, on what data Mr. Hood’s estimate was prepared, and whether, in view of the more moderate scheme that has now been decided on, the Elder Brethren are of opinion that a smaller and less expensive tender might be sufficient. 4. With regard to the lighthouse depot, I am to enquire whether the sum of 22,000k allowed for in Mr. Hood’s estimate cannot also now be substantially reduced. Both the Secretary of State and the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury are desirous of confining the scheme to the barest requirements of the policy of His Majesty’s Government, and they hope that some The Secretary to the Elder Brethren, Trinity House, E.C.economy may be practicable as regards the depot. It would be convenient if a list of the plant to be stored in the depot, with estimates could also be supplied. 5. As regards the location of the depot, it has recently been suggested by the Government of India that this should be on land acquired by the Angio- Persian Oil Company at Abadan Island, instead of at Koweit, as proposed by the Committee. A further communication will be made to you upon this subject, but it would be convenient if meanwhile particulars could be prepared, to be discussed if necessary at an informal conference, of the extent of land that would be required for the purpose, and the works to be installed. 6. I he favour is requested of an early reply, since it is proposed now to pioceed with the lighting and buoyage scheme with the least possible delay. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, R.

(In continuation of the Memorandum, dated the 28th December 1911. B. 187.) Charts :— (1.) “ Chart to accompany the Report of a Committee on Lighthouses for the Persian Gulf, dated 29th April 1909.” (Pol. 3620/1909 ; copy sent to Foreign Office and Admiralty 1st September 1909.)

(Pol. 4013/1911 ; copy sent to Foreign Office and Admiralty, li)th August 1911.) Scope of the Memorandum. 1. It may be useful to explain, in continuation of the printed departmental Memorandum of the 28th December 1911, the present position of the scheme for the Lighting and Buoyage of the Persian Gulf, adopted as the result of the local enquiry held in 1909. A convenient starting point is the “ summary of maximum possible expenditure,” described in paragraph 12 of that Memorandum in the following words : “ Assuming, for the sake of “ completeness, that the lights and buoys recom- “ mended in the letters of the India Office of the “ U'th September and 18th November 1911 (see “ paragraph 10 above) were all provided (without “ the adoption of the Treasury suggestions), that a “ lighthouse tender were procured at a cost of “ 30,0000 initial, and 5,0000 annual recurring, “ and that a depot were equipped at the full “ capital cost of 22,0000, the resulting expenditure “ would amount to :—initial 102,4000, annual “ recurring 7,7000” Modifications in India Office scheme.

The “ Treasury suggestions ” above referred to were that a light vessel proposed for the Shatt- el-Arab should be dispensed with, and that a lighted buoy should be substituted at Bushire for a light- vessel. After some correspondence the Treasury withdrew their objection to the Shatt-al-Arab light- vessel, but, as regards Bushire, it was decided that a lighted buoy (at the outer anchorage in addition to that for the inner anchorage) would be sufficient. In another important respect the scheme described in paragraph 1 was modified, viz., in the elimination of the spare light-vessel (cost 9,500L) that had been included as part of the equipment of the depot (cost 22,000k) S. 186, A ; : At 3. The items of the scheme as ultimately sanctioned were, therefore, as follows Scheme as ultimately sanctioned. Light, &amp;c., and Locality. Approximate Cost as stated in Mr. D. W.

These are in addition to the lighted buoy provided for the outer bar of the Shatt-al-Arab in 1911 and the unlit buoys taken over from the British India Company.! It _ was subsequently decided that the cost of two dioptric lanterns for Bushire (see paragraph 11 below) should be met from savings out of the total figures here given. * * In abeyance, see paragraph 6. It is in addition to the British lighted buoy already laid in the Shatt-al-Arab (outer bar). See paragraph 6 of earlier Memorandum. t Paragraphs 5 and 6 of Memorandum dated the 28th December 1911. Letters of India Office to Foreign Office, 28th May and 27th September P. 1803 and 3095/12. By good fortune it was found possible to obtain for the Tanb Island lighthouse the plant that had been ordered for a lighthouse for the Colonial Office. The construction of this light house is consequently well in hand. The plant for the lighthouse at Musandam has been ordered, but will not be ready for several months. As regards the Shaikh Shuaib lighthouse, there has been a hitch, owing to the fact that the conditions attached by the Persian Government to the erection of a lighthouse on their territory are unacceptable. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran is being consulted as to approaching the Persian The Lighthouses. Sir E. Grey’s Despatcb to Six’ Town ley, No. 201. 19th October 1912. P. 4100/12. W.Government once more with a view to the grant of a concession say, a lease for 99 years—which would allow a lighthouse to be built and worked by His Majesty’s Government. If it were not for the expense, a good way out M him difficulty would be the substitution of a light-vessel for the proposed lighthouse. The cost of the lighthouse, as stated above, is 8,000Z. initial, and 400h annual recurring. The corresponding ngures for the cost of a light-vessel, according to frimty House estimates, are 9,500Z. initial, and 650Z. annual recurring. (The Indian authorities have, however, stated that they could themselves build a light-vessel for 1,080Z. less, i.e., 8,420Z., see paragraph 5 below.) The Light-vessel. 5.

A matter in which no progress has yet been made is that of the lighthouse tender. The Committee that reported after local inquiry in 1909 on the lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf regarded it as imperative that a specially constructed steamer should be provided to act as a lighthouse tender, and Mr. I). W. Hood, the expert member of the Committee, wrote in his Supplementary Report:—“I estimate her cost, “ delivered in the Persian Gulf, after construction “ in England, at 30,000Z. The Indian Government “ from their own experience will be able to estimate “ what her annual maintenance would be in the “ East, but it would probably amount to about “ 5,000Z. per annum, inclusive of wages, repairs, “ coal, stores, and all charges.” These figures—initial expenditure 30,000Z., and annual recurring 5,000Z.—represent the maximum estimate sanctioned by the Secretary of State in Council and the Treasury, but the plans received from India are for a larger vessel than that contem plated, and one that would cost very much more to maintain. The matter is still under consideration.9. It was first proposed to locate the lighthouse depot at Koweit, but this plan was abandoned in favour of a site on the land leased by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company on the island of Abadan, near Mohammerah. Details are about to be investigated locally, but the conditions contemplated are, briefly, that land up to a total of two acres should be rented at ll. an acre for 49 years from the 29th May 1912, the period of the Company’s own lease, and that the Company should carry out certain works recommended by the Trinity House,' :i: ' supply oil (if in accordance with specification), and erect the necessary oil tanks. It is hoped that the result of the local investi gation will enable work at the depot to proceed without delay. An appreciable saving should apparently be effected on the cost of the depot, as originally estimated, through the employment of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s agency. The Lighthouse Depot. 10. In accordance with the recommendation of Trinity House, certain stores for the depot are being- sent out from England, viz — 2 spare lighted buoys. 2 spare lanterns. 3 sets of spare buoy moorings. It is also in contemplation to send out a crane. 11. Mention may here be made of the supply of t^ o dioptnc lanterns for the Residency at Bushire at an estimated cost of approximately 124P initial expenditure, ylus 2|- per cent, for Trinity House charges, and 24L annual recurring. The Treasury took exception to the supply of these lanterns outside the sanctioned programme, and explanations were furnished by this Office. a ? * ett A er t0 the foreign Department, dated the 11th August 1912, Sir P. Cox has called attention to “the regrettable consequences, both (( Political and economic, that might result from the ianure of any light, even temporarily,” and, with a view to placing future administrative arranoe- ments on a satisfactory footing, has suggested that for the present the Political Resident should be the chief lighting authority in (he Gulf and ex otlieio Inspector of Lights,” and that pending the provision of the lighthouse tender the officer commanding the R.I.M.S. “Lawrence” should be gazetted “Assistant Inspector of Lights.” He has also suggested a scale of allowances for officers and men of the “Lawrence” employed in lighting and buoyage work. The views of the Government of India on these proposals have not yet been received. Any extra expenditure on this head may perhaps be met out of savings effected on other parts of the scheme.

UbC 111 L,ie rer Sian UUII. 2. On receipt of this document I consulted local expert opinion with a view to ascertaining how far, in the view of those qualified to judge, the specification was adapted to the very exceptional climatic conditions of the Gulf, and the following observations, which, as a layman, I submit with all diffidence, are based upon thp views of those whom I have consulted and an examination of the records in this office bearing upon the subject. L 3. Position of officers ' 1 and passengers' cabins, which it is proposed to place amidships. It is represented that in a small ship, such as that contem plated, this will be, owing to the heat of the boilers and funnels the hottest part of the ship and that it is preferable that first class cabins, saloons etc., should be aft. I may mention parenthetically that this hot weather when the R. I. M. S. “ Investigator ” was kindly placed at my disposal by the Director, Royal Indian Marine, in temporary place of the “ Lawrence ”, which had broken her shaft, it was greatly borne in upon the officers of the ship and myself that the accommo dation amidships was intolerably hot for the Gulf hot weather. It is further represented that if the saloons and cabins are so placed, it will be impossible to escape the dirt and noise inseparable from the cleaning of buoys etc., which will be done over the bows ; that deck space will be very limited amidships and that the coolies, crew etc., will be constantly moving to and fro over the officers’ deck. In this connection I may mention that the latest British India Steam Navigation steamers, such as the Baroda ”, which have their first class accommodation amidships, appear to have proved most uncomfortable for first class passengers, who complain of precisely the points referred to above, particularly heat, and lack of privacy resulting from the first class decks being the thoroughfare for the ship’s company and deck passengers. 4. In the exceptionally trying climate of the Gulf, it is of the greatest importance that the living accommodation on the tender, which will be a fixture in the Gulf, should be as light and airy as possible; square ports being fitted, for instance, to officers Cabin; ; electric fans provided, and ample deck space allowed both as living space and for working cargo. I attach great importance to this consideration, as, unless the accommoda tion is as good as can reasonably be expected, it will be difficult to obtain the services of, or keep for a term of 5 years, an experienced Commander or Chief Engineer, upon whom, as Inspector of Lights, direct responsibility for the efficient working of the system will presumably devolve In this connection I would invite reference to my letter No. 1805, dated 1 ith August, to the Govern ment of India, and to the last paragraph of Mr. Hood’s Report of 28th June 1909 under the heading ” Lighthouse Tender 5. Coal capacity.—Co&amp;\ will be obtainable at only a few ports in the Gulf, i e., Maskat, Henjam, Kuwait and Abadan, and it is considered that the bunker capacity of the tender should not be less than 250 tons in order to give it a wider radius of action. This increase in capacity will also be economical, as with a small coal carrying accommodation the tender will be more frequently under the necessity of making otherwise unnecessary journeys merely to obtain coal.6. Derricks .—The provision of a winch and derrick capable of dealing with weights up to 8 tons and the necessary facilities for stowing 8-ton buoys on deck without risk, are mentioned in the note by the Director-in-Chief of the Indo- * Received with Foreign Department No. 2389-E.A., European Telegraph Department, dated dated27th December 1911. 16th October* 191 1, and in Mr. Hood’s Report of 28th June 1909, but do not appear in the specification, which only provides for a derrick capable of dealing with two tons. 7. Compressed air plant ,—I understand that this is necessary for testing the float chamber of gas buoys ; Mr. Hood appears to contemplate some such provision in his Report above quoted. 8. Deck accommodation for buoys .—It is understood that all work on buoys will be done on the forecastle deck, which should be made sufficiently spacious for the purpose, with facilities for stowing buoys in transport from depot to stations and vice versd. 9. There remains one point which I mention with great diffidence, it being one on which I am in no w’ay qualified to express an opinion. It has been pointed out to me that the Royal Indian Marine Steamer “ Lawrence ” is undoubtedly the most suitable vessel in the Gulf as regards accommodation for officers, passengers and crew, and I would suggest for consideration the advisa bility of constructing the new tender on the same lines as far as is possible, though fitted, as suggested, with twin screws and all the latest modern improve ments. Should this be found feasible, all the officers’ and passengers’ cabins and the saloon would be aft, whilst warrant officers, 2nd and 3rd class passengers and crew would be berthed forward. Amidships, that is to say, in the erection forming the bridge, would be crews’ and coolies’ galleys, latrines, wash places, lamp locker, boatswain’s locker, and armoury, on the port side ;-and on the starboard side officers’ galley, bathrooms, water closets for officers and warrant officers, and locker for buoyage gear. On the main deck forward and aft would be accommodated coolies, lighth&lt;*use crews etc. I am further advised that it is probable that telemotor steering gear, on account of the exceptional climatic conditions ruling in the Gulf, would prove unreliable, and I venture to suggest that the usual hand controlled steam steering gear be supplied, the engine being situated on deck if possible. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Director, Royal Indian Marine. G. C. B. R, Simla.,— No. C. 53 F- D.—31.8.12.44.-C. G. SExtract From Lieut, Colonel Sir P,Z.

C.E., SUPPLEMENTARY TO THAT OF ON THE LIGHTING AND BUOYAGE OF THE PERSIAN GULF. In considering the establishment of lighthouses, light vessels, buoys, and other sea marks in the Persian Gulf, I propose to approach the subject mainly from the point of view of construction and maintenance ; and, while fully in agreement with the order of importance attributed to the proposed lights in the Report of the Committee of Enquiry, I have, for the time being, set aside all claims to priority m navigational importance m favour of those offering the greatest facilities, and consequent economy, from an engineering standpoint. Finally, I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to reconcile the navigational and constructional requirements. In some cases alternative proposals to those recommended by the Committee are put forward, as the result of fuither personal investigation since I left the Persian Gulf, or are suggested by the probable expenditure after the preparation of the estimates. T In regard to tire scheme generally as prepared and advocated by the Committee of Enquiry, I would draw attention to the abstract statement of lights proposed by the British India officers at the beginning of the Report, and would state that, since the Committee dispersed, I have had numerous opportunities of confidentially discussing the lighting of the Persian Gulf with masters of vessels engaged in navigating these waters, including some of those whose opinions had previously been submitted to us and discovered, without divulging the recommendations of the Committee, that the scheme proposed would meet with, practically, universal favour. In submitting estimates for each of the proposed lighthouses it has been assumed that all materials which require to be imported into the Gulf will be carried by regular trading steamers to the nearest port and be taken thence landed, and delivered on the site by the proposed lighthouse tender and her crew as the services of an attendant steamship are considered essential in the interests of works on sites of such isolation and inaccessi bility Ho allowance has, therefore, been made m the estimates for freight on material after it leaves the trading steamer, except the hire of native craft for barge work where necessary. W here portions of _ any woiks demand fresh water for building construction or other purposes, it has been assumed that such water will be delivered on the site by the steamer if it cannot be procured locally. Nor has allowance been made for the purchase of land for lighthouses or othei works. _ n jy- • i In Paper No. 189, dated 5th November 1908, embodying the official correspondence in regard to the construction of a lighthouse at Ras al Arz, S. 11.—2. A2 it is recommended (page 11) that the work be executed by experienced lighthouse constructors from England. I have, therefore, assumed that all lighthouses &amp;c in the Persian Gulf will be erected by a Superintendent of Works of the’’ Constructive Staff of Trinity House, and by lighthouse mechanics where necessary, all skilled labour being procured from India, and unskilled labour from the locality in which the work is being executed, and that none of the lighthouses will be erected by contract. Lighthouse Tender. The necessity for the provision of a steamship to serve exclusively in the capacity of lighthouse tender has been pointed out by the Committee of Enquiry. The cost of construction and maintenance of this steamer would form very considerable items in any scheme for establishing lights in the Persian Gulf. Possibly, however, the Royal India Marine have at their disposal an existing vessel which, if possible to release from other duties, could at comparatively small cost be fitted and adapted for use as a lighthouse tender for the district. She should have a good hold and good deck accommodation for the conveyance of stores and buoys, be fitted with storage gas receivers and compressor for charging buoys or light vessels, and have a powerful winch and derrick for dealing easily with weights up to 8 tons at sea. Her capacity for water storage or distilling, as recommended by the Committee of Enquiry, should not be overlooked. Should a suitable vessel of the Royal India Marine not be available, and it becomes necessary to build a new ship, with proper appliances and permanent living accommodation for officers and crew, she would in all probability require a displacement of approximately 800 tons. I estimate her cost, delivered in the Persian Gulf after construction in England, at 30,000L The Indian Government, from their own experience, will be able to estimate what her annual maintenance would be in the East, but it would probably amount to about 5,000b per annum, inclusive of wages, repairs, coal, stores, and all charges. The Committee of Enquiry recommend that one of the officers of the ship should be a qualified surveyor, and I would further suggest that her Com mander hold the appointment of Superintendent of Lighthouses, and be responsible for the proper maintenance of all lighthouses, light vessels, and buoys. The engineer of the ship should be fully trained to overhaul and adjust all working parts of all lights, including clocks, rollers, buoy flashers, &amp;c., and be thoroughly grounded in the management and adjustment of modern lighthouse burners. Lighthouses. As already stated, the order of navigational importance as tabulated in the report of the Committee of Enquiry should, for constructional expediency, be departed from to a slight degree. In the opinion of the Committee of Enquiry, the first lighthouse in the Gulf should be established at Little Quoin, Musandam. The establishment of a lighthouse on Little Quoin, however, would be dependent on the attendance of the lighthouse steamer ; and, if it is the intention of the Government of India to proceed forthwith with a lighting scheme, I would point out that, as the services of the steam tender are not required for the construction and maintenance of the proposed works at Muscat, Linga, and Debai, the establishment of these lights could be undertaken during the period in which the proposed lighthouse tender is under construction or adaptation. Then, on the arrival of the steam tender in the Gulf, the construction of the Little Quoin lighthouse could be proceeded with ; and considerable economy would be effected if Little Quoin and Tanb Island lighthouses were built simultaneously, as they are close together, and could both be attended to easily and conveniently by the ship, while allowing her ample time to attend periodically to the requirements of any floating or other lights that may meantime have been established in the Gulf.3 The construction of lighthouses at Shaikh Shuaib, Bushire, Kubbar, Ras al Aiz, and Ivishm, from the different nature of the structures, could he undertaken separately and in any required sequence, as m these cases continual attention by the ship would not be so essential. In all cases 1 would recommend that the illuminant adopted for light houses m the Persian Gulf be ordinary lighthouse paraffin. As incandescent oil burners of the “ Chance ” type are already installed on the coast of India, I would suggest that the same system be adopted for the lights now under discussion, as the lighthouse officials appointed to the Gulf will in all probability have had some experience of these burners in Burma, Madras, and other portions of the Indian coast. In regard to machinery and the working parts of each lighthouse, only mechanism of the simplest nature is recommended, in view of its maintenance by local keepers. Depot. While the earliest works are in progress in the Gulf, the establishment of the gasworks should be completed. The site for the depot and gasworks which appeared to me to offer the greatest advantages in the Persian Gulf was the shore of the Sweikh Channel at Koweit, when it transpired that a portion of the adjoining land had already been secured by the British Government. I subsequently inferred, and have assumed, that the con struction of a pier or jetty at this point is in contemplation, and that part of this British land will be placed at the disposal of the lighthouse authorities for the establishment of a buoy yard, gas works, &amp;c., and that the pier or jetty will he available for the use of the lighthouse service. The cost of establishing gasworks, erecting a small workshop, oil storage tanks, store houses, offices, forming buoy yard, and boundary walls, would probably entail an expenditure of about 22,000b, complete with spare light vessel, gas buoys, unlit buoys, moorings, and general equipment, but nothing has been allowed in this estimate for the purchase of land, or any proportion of the cost of the proposed pier. On the assumption that the work already contemplated by the Govern ment at Koweit will be commenced immediately, matters would be considerably simplified if the establishment of the lighthouse depot formed a part of the Admiralty scheme, and if the work could be carried out by their constructive staff. It is assumed that Koweit will shortly be placed in telegraphic communication with Bushire. The cost of maintaining the depot is covered by the corresponding amounts given for each of the proposed lights. Light Vessels. Simultaneously with the building or adaptation of the steam tender the construction of one or more light vessels could be undertaken. They should be modelled, both as regards hull and lighting apparatus, on the most recent Trinity House practice; and I would suggest that they be copper-sheathed composite ships, about 85 feet in length. Each ship should be_ fitted with storage gas holders for the maintenance of a dioptric light, similar to those on this principle established successfully in France and England. The dioptric apparatus should consist of large fourth order panels of 375 m/m. focal distance, and each ship should be arranged to show a single flashing white light, so that she could be removed from, or placed on, any station without alteration. This can be done without any possible confusion of lights. They should be fitted with 2-wick capillary stand-by lamps. In England the crew of such a vessel consists of six men, i.e., four on board antTtwo on relief; but in the Persian Gulf I would suggest that the crew consist of six men on board and two on relief. I estimate the cost of such a vessel, complete, with moorings on her station in the Gulf, at approximately 9,500L, and the maintenance at about 650L per annum, inclusive of w^ages, stores, penodical oveihaul, and all sums chargeable against the ship for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit.4 I am of opinion that the construction of these ships should not be undertaken in India. A dioptric ship is of special form, and should be trimmed for proper riding, have her lenses balanced, the swing of the vessel determined, and the period of the pendulum finally adjusted to it under the supervision of experts at home. 1P , i t i The first ship completed might be towed to the CjuJf by the new light house tender, and the others could be sailed to Port Said, and towed from there to the Gulf by the tender sent round specially for that purpose. All proposals as to lightships and lighted buoys are put forward provisionally, as the illumination of all descriptions of floating lights is on the eve of* very important, and, I confidentally anticipate, successful development. The estimates of first cost and maintenance may, however, be accepted as covering figures in any case. Muscat (see Appendix L). The summit of Pas Muscat is at present practically inaccessible, and a zig-zag path with occasional steps would require to be made to the top. The flat reef below the headland, and on which a landing can easily be effected, requires making up with concrete, and considerable excavation would be necessary on the summit of the headland to form a shelf or plateau on which the necessary buildings could be erected. The tower and dwellings should be constructed of masonry, the former being only about 12 feet b inches high, floor to floor. This would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 250 feet above high water, or sufficient for a geographical range of about 22 miles. The necessary living and storage accommodation should consist of living room, sleeping room, oil store, fuel store, general store-room, and water storage tanks. The provision of a low retaining wall around the plateau might be found necessary, as the surface rock on the summit is very loose. The light should, I consider, be of the Third Order, and show one flash of about ' 34 second duration every 5 seconds. The intensity would be about 100,000 candles with an incandescent oil burner having a mantle of 55 m/m in the focus of the lens. I estimate approximately, from the information at my disposal, that the cost of establishing such a lighthouse, complete with lantern, lighting apparatus, dwelling and stores, and inclusive of forming a landing place, approaches to the summit, temporary stores, and living quarters for superin tendents and workmen, would be about 8,0000, and the annual maintenance, inclusive of oil, stores, wages and repairs, at about 3500, an amount that would cover the sum annually chargeable against Muscat for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. I consider that the establishment necessary for maintaining this light should consist of six men (natives of Muscat), who should be chosen by the Superintendent of W orks and the erecting mechanic, in consultation with the British Political Resident at Muscat, from amongst the labourers employed on the works, and who will have been under observation for a considerable time by these officers. It would then be the duty of the erecting mechanic to instruct them in the management of the burners, and everything in. their charge. It would be necessary for Muscat lighthouse to be maintained as a “ rock station,” i.e., the men only residing at the lighthouse and their families in the town. Four men would, therefore, always be on duty at the lighthouse, with two on relief. * Little Quoin (see Appendices II. and III.). On the completion of Muscat lighthouse, the workmen’s living quarters, cement store and plant should be conve} 7 ed to the Little Quoin by the lighthouse tender, and the construction of the lighthouse on the island begun. I he most convenient landing place is at the north-west point; but to face up the rock so as to render the landing of men and stores easy, and execute the necessary protective work to the cliff over the landing place.5 would, though presenting little constructional difficulty, entail considerable expenditure. riie edge of the cliff at the south end is 154 feet high, and the proposed site 154 feet above high water. The towei should be of masonry, 30 feet high from base to gallery, which would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 175 feet above high water, or sufficient for a geographical range of 20 miles. This light—one of the most important in the Gulf—should, I consider, be of the Second Order, and show two flashes in quick succession every 10 seconds as follows :— Flash - - _ _ . Eclipse - - _ . Flash - - - _ . Eclipse - - - . Total period The intensity, with an incandescent oil burner having a mantle of 55 m/m* in the focus of the lens, would be about 200,000 candles. I estimate the cost of establishing the light, inclusive of landing place, cliff protective work, tower, dwellings, stores, lantern and lighting apparatus complete at 12,500k, and the annual maintenance at 400k, inclusive of all stores, wages, structural repairs, and charges against the Little Quoin lighthouse for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. The lighthouse should be maintained as a rock station, the keepers only living on the island. The establishment should consist of six men, four on duty and two on relief. Probably a very frequent relief of the Little Quoin lighthouse would be necessary in the summer months, as it is characterised climatically as the worst place in the Gulf. '23 second. 1*54 „ *23 „ 8'00 seconds 10'00 Bunder Abbas (see Appendix IV.). Alternative proposals for lighting the approaches to Bunder Abbas are suggested by the Committee of Enquiry, viz. :— 1. A lighthouse near Kishm Town, in conjunction with a lighted buoy at the seaward extreme of the shoals off Kishm Point, or— 2. A small light vessel or gas boat alone in the latter position. A site for a lighthouse was selected near a small gully just beyond the extreme water tank to the southward of Kishm Town, the site being about 100 yards from the sea. Good building materials, except for concrete work, are not available locally, and I would suggest that the tower be a braced cast-iron structure about 65 feet high from ground to gallery. This would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 86 feet above high water, or sufficient for a geographical range of 15 miles as recommended by the Admiralty and the Committee of Enquiry. The light should, I consider, be Third Order occulting, and show red between the bearings of about S. 14° E. and S. 66° E. over Larak Island. Its character should be one occultation every 20 seconds. With an incan descent oil burner, having a mantle of 55 m/m diameter m the focus of the lens, the intensity would be about 9,000 candles. I estimate the cost of establishing the lighthouse, inclusive of tower, lantern, lighting apparatus, stores, dwellings, &amp;c., complete at 7,500k, and its annual maintenance, inclusive of wages, stores, repairs, and painting, at 400k, which sum would cover all amounts chargeable against Kishm for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. _ Kishm lighthouse would rank as a shore station, the establishment con sisting of four men, who should live with their families in dwellings erected near the tower. ^ tx* i -n * . r x- ^ n With regard to the proposed lighted buoy off Kishm 1 omt, 1 estimate its cost with lantern and moorings complete on its station, at 600k, and its annual maintenance at 40k, inclusive of gas, cleaning, periodical overhaul, and depot charges. s. 11 .— 2 . B )6 In regard to the alternative proposal to establish a small type of light vessel off Kishm point, I estimate the cost of placing an unattended gas boat with an occulting light of about 500 candle power, at 6,000Z. complete on her station, with moorings, &amp;c. The maintenance of such a vessel would probably amount to about 250Z. per annum, inclusive of gas, stores, £ periodical overhaul, and all sums chargeable against her by the depot at Koweit and periodical and frequent attention by a local man. Either of these schemes for lighting the approaches to Bunder Abbas involves considerable expense both in first cost and annual maintenance, to obviate which a third and possible alternative suggests itself, viz., to establish a small outer light on the east end of Larak Island, and a lighted buoy at the Euphrates Patch west of Hormuz. As already stated, the first cost and annual maintenance of the buoy would be 6001. and 40L respectively, inclusive of all depot charges. A navigator could ascertain his position in approaching the port from any direction by the Little Quoin light, and all that would be necessary to guide him safely past Larak is a small light of short range to mark the end of the island. If this were a standard semi-watched port light, it could be attended to by a native of the adjoining village. No provision would be necessary for living quarters, as would probably be the case if the light were established on the west end of the island. A light of only 5 miles range on the east end of Larak would, it appears to me, be as efficient as a 15-mile light on Kishm Point, if the lighting of the approaches to Bunder Abbas be restricted to one channel only. In addition to the cost of the proposed buoy at the Euphrates Patch, the establishment of a port light on Larak Island would involve an expenditure of 4501., inclusive of a small corrugated iron oil store, &amp;c., and would, I consider, be maintained at an annual cost of about 35L, inclusive of all depot charges. The estimate of first cost of this port light provides for an erecting mechanic being already employed in the Gulf, as no provision has been made for sending a man specially from India or England to erect the light. Jezirat Tanb (see Appendix V.). The best sight for a lighthouse on Tanb is the summit of the island, a flat tableland near the N.W. side. Good building stone is available, and I would suggest that the premises be constructed of masonry. The site is about 165 feet above high water; but, as there are several points on the island nearly as high as the proposed site, I would suggest that, in order to reduce the shadows cast seaward by them, the tower be 30 feet high. This would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 200 feet above high water, or sufficient for a geographical range of 20 miles. The light should, I consider, be of the Third Order, and show one flash of ‘ 34 second duration every 5 seconds, the intensity being about 100,000 candles. I estimate the cost of establishing this light complete with tower, dwellings, stores, lantern and lighting apparatus, at about 7,500Z., and its maintenance at 350L per annum, which would cover all sums chargeable against the station for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. Tanb lighthouse should rank as a shore station, the establishment con sisting of four keepers, who should live with their families in dwellings erected beside the tower. These men should, if possible, be natives of the island. Debai. The site selected for the proposed light at Debai is on the sea front. The structure should be a column 20 feet high, and the light (fixed red, as recom mended by the Committee of Enquiry) should be shown from a Fourth Order port light. It would be of about 200 candle power, which would probably give an effective range of 5 miles, and often more in very clear weather.The liglit could, I estimate, be maintained for about 35L per annum, and I estimate the first cost, inclusive of column, lantern, stores, and corrugated iron oil store at approximately 450L if carried out a time when other work was in hand in the locality and an expert erector was available. Lingah. The site selected for a light at Lingah is the centre of the courtyard of the new offices of the British India Company, in which position f would suggest that a high column with four stays be erected. The light, fixed red, as recommended by the Committee of Enquiry, should be so arranged that the lantern is hoisted nightly on the mast or column. It should be a Fourth Order port light, the establishment of which would not, I estimate, exceed 600Z. if carried out at a time when other work was in hand in the locality. Such a light would probably be maintained at an annual cost of 35L inclusive of all depot charges. Its maintenance would only require the partial time of one man for extinguishing and cleaning purposes in the morning and for lighting up and hoisting into position at night. Shaikh Shuaib (see Appendix VI.). The best position for a lighthouse is, as indicated by the Committee of Enquiry, near the S.W. point of the island. The tower should, I consider, be a braced cast-iron structure about 85 feet in height from base to gallery, which would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 120 feet above high water. The resultant geographical range would be about 17 miles, or rather more than is recom mended by the Committee; but the slight additional height allowed for in the tower is to obtain a satisfactory bearing of the light over the higher land to the eastward. From this elevation the light would, in all probability, show from N. through W. and S. to E. The light should, I consider, be of the Third Order, and show two flashes in quick succession every 10 seconds as follows: Flash Eclipse Flash Eclipse '34 second. L5 ' 34 ,, 7'82 seconds Total period lO'OO The intensity would be about 100,000 candles. I estimate the cost of establishing such a light, inclusive of tower, lantern, lighting apparatus, dwellings, stores, &amp;c., complete at 8,0001., and its maintenance at 400Z. per annum, inclusive of all sums chargeable against the station for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. four keepers should I consider, be natives of the island, and reside with their families m quarters erected near the tower. Shaikh Shuaib would, therefore, be a shore station, and require no regular relief. Has al Mutaf. The type of floating light proposed for establishment at Ras al Mutaf is described provisionally under light vessels where it is also estimated that her first cost would be about 9,500Z. and her annual maintenance about 650L The light should show one flash every 10 seconds, and the intensity would be approximately 40,000 candles. Bushire. As suo-o-ested by the Committee of Enquiry, the most efficient means of linhtin^the approach to Bushire is by means of a light vessel placed near the outer anchorage. The cost of establishing a suitable sh,p would be ■stated ^for^Ras dMutaf. '\ight “Se single° fla'S every 10 seconds!

The light vessel proposed to be established outside the Shat al Arab Bar should be in all respects similar to that described for Ras al Mutai. * I he first cost would also he about 9,500fi, and the estimated annual maintenance 650L The light should he single flashing every 10 seconds, and the intensity about 40,000 candles. . . . . i a + The crew is estimated to consist of eight men, viz., six on board and two The advantages to he derived from this ship as a day mark cannot he over estimated. . , ' Each of the lighted buoys proposed by the Conimittee of Enquiry lor the bar would, I estimate, cost about 600L complete m place, and involve an annual expenditure of 40Z. for maintenance, or a total first cost of 2,401E and an aggregate maintenance of 160Z, inclusive of depot chaigos. The characters of the lights could he: Outer Buoy No. 1 - One occultation every 10 seconds. No. 2 - Two flashes every 10 seconds. ’’ No. 3 - One flash every 10 seconds. Inner Buoy No. 4 - One occultation every 10 seconds. Thp, colour of all these lights should be white. Kubbar Island (see Appendix VII.). All ships approaching Koweit from any direction make this island the landfall, and as it is very low and flat, it is most difficult to pick up even in very clear weather, so that a lighthouse on Knbbar Island would be found almost as great a benefit as a daymark as the light by night. The proposed site is only about 6 feet above high water. A cast-iron braced tower similar to that recommended for Shaikh Shuaib would placethe focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 100 feet above high water, 01 sufficient for the geographical range of 15 miles recommended by the Committee of Enquiry. It would, I consider, be necessary to maintain this lighthouse as a rock station, thn reliefs being effected from Koweit, living quarters for men only being provided on the island. 1 estimate the cost of the establishment of the light, inclusive of tower, lantern, lighting apparatus, dwellings, stores, &amp;c., complete, at 8,500Z., and its maintenance at 400L per annum, inclusive of all sums chargeable against the station for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. The light should be of the Third Order, and show four flashes in quick succession every 15 seconds as follows :— Flash - _ ‘26 second Eclipse - _ _ _ - 2 ‘ 00 seconds Flash - - ‘26 second Eclipse - _ _ _ - 2; 00 seconds Flash - - ‘26 second Eclipse - . - 2‘00 seconds Flash - - ■ 26 second Eclipse - - - 7 ‘ 96 seconds Total period - 15*00 seconds The intensity, with an incandescent oil burner having a mantle of 55 m/m. diameter in the focus of the lens, would be about 85,000 candles. Has al Arz {see Appendix VIII.). The most convenient and best site for a lighthouse at Has al Arz is immediately in rear of the existing beacon, and nothing is to be gained by placing the structure on the higher ground inland of this position, as suggested in paragraph 4 of a letter from Major Knox, dated 21st May 1907, and printed on page 2 of Paper No. 189, dated 5th November 1908. The site there is of blown sand; and, though a lower tower would suffice, the foundations would be a very expensive item. The tower should be a braced cast-iron structure about 40 feet high, which would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 45 feet above high water, or sufficient for a geographical range of 12 miles as recommended by the Committee of Enquiry. It should, I considei, be of the Fourth Order, and show one white flash every 5 seconds. This light could be of a semi-watched nature, the luminary being a 2-wick capillary lamp. . . . A watchman is already maintained to guard the beacon, and tue provision of another keeper would complete the establishment necessary for the requirements of such a light. . , With the proposed semi-watched system, the driving clock is arranged to maintain the light in action all night without re-winding, and the lamp to burn without attention. _ .... I estimate the cost of such a light, with tower, lantern, and hgh mg apparatus, oil store, lighthouse* store,_ &amp;c., complete, at 5,000/,, and its maintenance at 100L per annum, inclusive of all depot charges. It is noteworthy that the present watchman, a Bedouin, although provided with a house of two rooms of the usual native construction, does not occupy it ^referring to live with his family in a tent of native matting. Local opinion is against the provision of further permanent living quarters, as Bedouin prefer the tents. An oil store and lighthouse store room have, however, been provided for in the above estimate. . a The type of light provided for in the estimates embodied m pages 9 and 10 of Paper No. 189 of 1908 is, I consider, unsuitable for the position, and would not fulfil the conditions laid down by the Committee of Enquiry. The estimate for its establishment on the lines proposed is also inadequate. In estimating the cost of erecting the iron tower, &amp;c it has been assumed that a foreman of works to supervise the construction of the foundations, and S. 11—2. C10 an erecting mechanic, are already engaged in the Persian Gnlf, as no allowance has been made for the sea passages of skilled workmen from England, the employment of whom is recommended on page li of Papei lb&gt;9, dated 5th November 1908. Bahrein (see Appendix IX.). For the efficient lighting of the approaches to Bahrein, the Committee of Enquiry propose a 20-mile light on the reef at Fasht^ ad Ilibal, a floating light near the present outer buoy, and gas buoys at Kaseifa and the West Sl&gt;1 To erect a lighthouse at Fasht ad Dibal would involve an expenditure which I estimate at 35,0001. The reef is practically awash at low water, and the structure would be subjected to assault by the sea. The estimate provides for a massive concrete base on tlm coral reef, surmounted by a braced cast-iron structure about 150 feet high, in the design of which the necessary living accommodation would be embodied. ' The light should be of the Third Order, single flashing every 5 seconds, and the intensity about 100,000 candles. I estimate the cost of maintaining such a lighthouse at 500L per annum, inclusive of wages, ration allowances, stores, oil, structural repairs and painting, and all sums chargeable against the station loi the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. In view of the heavy cost anticipated by the Committee of Enquiry entailed in erecting a lighthouse on Fasht ad Dibal, they suggest^the alternative of placing a light vessel about 5 miles north of the reef. The cost of a suitable vessel complete on her station would be about 9,500b, and her annual maintenance about 650b The light from the light vessel should be single flashing every 10 seconds, and the intensity about 40,000 candles. Whatever form of outer light for marking the approaches to Bahrein be adopted, the Committee of Enquiry propose that a floating light be established near the present outer buoy to mark the entrance to the channel. This light might be a gas boat, with an occulting Fourth Order light of about 500 candle power. Such a vessel would require to be about 65 feet long, and would, I estimate, cost about 6,000b complete on her station, involving an expenditure of about 250b for maintenance, inclusive of gas and periodical overhaul. She would have an unattended light and carry no crew. Each of the gas buoys proposed for Kaseifa and West Spit would, I estimate, cost about 600b complete on its station, and involve an annual outlay of about 40b Summarised, these two schemes for the lighting of Bahrein are as follows:— — First Cost. Annual Maintenance. NTo. 1. £ £ Lighthouse ... 35,000 500 Gras boat ... . 6,000 250 Two g’as buoys - - - 1,200 80 Total - - 42,200 830 No. 2. Light vessel ... 9,500 650 Gas boat ... 6,000 250 Two gas buoys 1,200 80 Total - - - 16,700 980 Either of these schemes, with its attendant heavy first cost and maintenance, would, in the opinion of the Committee of Enquiry, be necessary to render ingress and egress of Bahrein harbour practicable and safe by night.11 1 would point out, however, that, since I left the Persian Gulf, I have had it put before me that leaving Bahrein by night is of much more importance t an entering the port, as a vessel, on completing her loading bv night could leave at any time instead of waiting for daylight. If this'argument be admitted, all that is necessary to render egress from the harbour safe is a gas buoy at Kaseifa, and another gas buoy with a high and conspicuous superstructure for a day-mark near the present outer buoy. It is a matter for very serious consideration, however, whether the establishment of these two lights would not tend to induce men to use them for entering Bahrein, as it might involve considerable risk. I estimate the aggregate cost of these two gas buoys at 1,350L complete on their stations, and their combined maintenance at 85Z. per annum, inclusive of all depot charges. Beacon. To erect a suitable structure in place of the present beacon at Bahrein would probabl} 7 entail an expenditure of about 500b, and 5b for annual maintenance. Buoys. With regard to the question of placing the unlit buoys recommended by the Committee of Enquiry, I estimate the cost as follows Jask. —A fifth class conical buoy at Jask, about 100b complete with moorings. A sum of about 15b per annum would probably cover its repairs, cleaning, &amp;c. Bunder Abbas.—-A second class can buoy at the anchorage at Bunder Abbas, about 200b complete with moorings, &amp;c. A sum of 20b per annum would probably cover its repairs, cleaning, &amp;c. Koweit .—To replace the three existing buoys at Koweit belonging to the British India Company with two fifth class buoys and one second class can buoy, would probabiy involve an outlay of about 400b, and an annual expenditure of about 50b for maintenance. Jadum .—To replace the existing Jadum buoy with a fifth class conical buoy would cost about 100b, and about 15b for annual maintenance. The unlit buoys required are, therefore, as follows: Four fifth class buoys, plus two spare Two second class buoys, plus one spare All of the unlit buoys could be constructed in BombayI ' 1 12 r SUMMARY.
