(R) or (L) means right or left bank of a stream or watercourse, it being assumed that the reader is facing down-stream. (B) refers to both banks. Populations are calculated at 5 persons per house. Tribal fighting strengths are calculated at |-ths of total tribal strengths. A mile is to be regarded as a Statute mile (1,760 yards), unless otherwise expressly stated. A caravan day means the distance covered by a caravan in a day, and may be taken as averaging 26 to ^0 miles. A dhalul day, on the other hand, may be reckoned at anything from 30 to 60 miles. The system of transliteration adopted in this Route Book is that recommended by the General Staff; well- known names, however, retain their conventional spelling. The system has therefore not been followed witn regard to certain names which occur frequently in international correspondence. In those cases the spelling is such an orthographical compromise between the various national systems as will render these names everywhere readily identifiable. Thus, Irak Hodeida, Kaimakam, will appear instead of Iraq, Hudaidah,CONFIDENTIAL. ROUTES IN ARABIA- ROUTE No. 1. F rom BAGHDAD to KERBELA. 61 miles. 3 stages.

Tlie capital of Irak, built on both sides defended, but almost surrounded by a raised rofd;' manyE oute N o. 1 — contd. 3-storeyed houses of brick; 4,000 shops, over 200 khans, and many mosques ; population, about 140,000. Water for drink ing purposes is obtained either by means of pipes from the Tigris, or, as is generally the case, from carriers. A large number of houses possess wells, but the water in them is not drinkable. Fuel is abundant, and fodder (for cattle, don keys, mules, camels, etc.), is fairly so, that for horses being in- difierent. Supplies consist of rice, wheat, barley, and other cereals; also fruit and vegetables. Livestock plentiful; domes tic birds in considerable numbers. 1 m ahmudiyah. . 21 m. South by west. about 600 yards 2i m . outside Baghdad a brick bridge, with a ramp leading up to it, is crossed. Water sometimes collects on either side of this bridge in pools 1 i feet deep, which might possibly be an obstacle to guns but not to cavalry or infantry. From a short distance beyond this bridge to the Kharr bridge at mile 3, the road runs along the top of an embankment revetted with brushwood and pierced at intervals by brick culverts giving passage to floods that cross the line of the road here in wet weather. The top of the embankment is about 15 feet above the surrounding country, and where it leads on to the Kharr bridge it attains its maximum breadth of 45 feet. The ends of the bridge are 2 stone piers, 16 feet broad and 6 feet long, projecting from either bank ; the central portion consists of a single iron girder 171 feet long, carrying a metalled roadway 0 feet wide. In April, when the water in the Khan- stream is 10 feet deep, the height of the roadway above the water is 12 feet. At the south end of the bridge, on the east side of the road, is a 2-8toreyed brick house, behind which are about 20 mud huts. After crossing the Kharr bridge the road trends to the south, separating from the bridge embankment which continues west ward for about 2 miles and ends in the desert. Near mile 6 the road strikes a bend of the Tigris, but again immediately leaves it. . . At mile 6, Khan-al-Kharabah, a ruined caravansarai, is passed on the cast of the road.Route No. \~ contd About mile 10 there is marshy ground, sometimes dry, on both sides of the road. Beyond this as far as Mahmudiyah the country traversed is dry desert. At mile 13 there is another deserted caravansarai, Khan Azad, on the west side of the road. As Mahmudiyah is entered, the canal of the same name from the Euphrates is crossed; the canal is here 27 feet broad and 4 feet deep and the bridge over it is 18 feet wide and has a small arch of 6 feet span in the middle. A little higher up the canal is only 10 feet broad. Mahmudiyah, an increasing town on the south bank of the canal of the same name, with 150 houses, a dozen shops, 11 khans, and about 1,000 souls. These khans are mostly defen sible, one of them being partly loopholed and provided with circular towers at the four corners ; in the aggregate they would provide accommodation for about 1,000 men and the same number of animals. The canal flows for 8 or 9 months in the year, and irrigates fields of wheat, barley, and millet. At Mahmudiyah there are some mounted Zaptiehs and a few regular soldiers. 2 MUSEYIE .. 20 m. South-south-west: At mile 5, Khan-al- 41 m. Bir, a caravansarai, now deserted, stands on the west side of the road. At mile 12, Sikandariyah village, 50 mud houses with a khan and several brick enclosures, on left bank of canal of same name. Cultivation being developed; grazing for considerable flocks and herds. Just beyond here, a canal from the Euphrates is crossed by a brick bridge. Between here and end of stage there is some times an extensive slough, known as Abu Luqah. The road strikes the left bank of the Euphrates immediate ly above Museyib town ; about 50 yards before reaching the bank it crosses a deep canal by a high brick bridge of which the roadway is 10 feet wide. The approach to the town is along a broad embankment carefully revetted which contains the river at this point. In the middle of Museyib town the Euphrates is crossed by a boat bridge of 24 pontoons, a rickety and ill-maintained structureR oute N o, l—cantd. . Museyib, situated on both sides of the Euphrates, and shut in by palm trees ; main part of town on left bank, but some of the best buildings are on the right bank. Houses mostly of masonry ; there are 12 khans, 25 granaries, and about 100 shops. On the left bank immediately above the town a strong embank- ment carefully revetted extends for about 600 yards, on the top of which runs the Baghdad-Kerbela road. Population about 3,500 souls ; there are 40,000 date palms ; transport is not readily obtainable in any amount; forage and provisions limited; boats include about 12 saflnahs and a score of sajas. 3 KERBELA .. 20 m. West-south-west. ' The road for wheeled 61 m - _ transport from here to Kerbela skirts the northern edge of the cultivation dependent on the Husainiyah canal, at a distance of 2 or 3 miles from the canal; passes the tomb of 'Aim at mile 12 or 13 ; and finally enters Kerbela by the Bab Baghdad bridge. An alternative route, for horsemen and foot passengers, follows more closely the north bank of the Husainiyah. At about mile 7, it crosses a medium sized distributary from the Husainiyah, empty and ruined; and immediately beyond this it runs over the Wall distributary by a brick bridge, 18 feet wide, with no parapet nor handrail. The banks of the Wall are 45 feet apart, 25 feet high, and precipitous ; and the stream at the bottom flows 6 feet wide and 3 feet deep. A short dis tance beyond the Wall the road crosses the Hamudiyah distri butary, which has banks 25 feet apart and 16 feet high. The bridge here is of brick, with an 8-foot roadway. At about mile 11, another distributary, known as the Abu Sulaiman, narrower than the preceding ones, and spanned by a bridge of wood and earth. About mile 12, Khan-al-'Ataishi. To mile 17, route runs along right bank of the Husainiyah, and a number of small canals are passed, the bridges over which are bad and unfit for wheels. The road now crosses to the left bank of the Husainiyah by the Pul-i-Safid. For these last several miles the way has lain through dense date plantations. From mile 17 to end of stage there are continuous walled enclosures adjoining the road on both sides.Route No. 1— concld. Kerbela is a town of about 50,000 permanent inhabitants and has in addition a large floating population. The old town is surrounded on three sides by a wall from 20 to 30 feet high, with towers at intervals, but the work is in bad repair. There are two tiers of loopholes ; perimeter of wall, about 2 miles ; 5 gates. Large agricultural and garden produce, considerable quantities of dates. Large and well-stocked hazdr, and some 20 shops dealing in European wares. Kerbela not a good centre for collection of supplies or transport. No mules ; and camels only procurable in the autumn when the Bedouins come in. There is a flour-mill driven by an oil-engine ; 2 ice-making plants. Water from Husainlyah canal, or when it is dry, from 20 to 25 wells sunk mostly in the canal bed. Garrison consists of about 2-40 Turkish soldiers, and there are about 100 Zaptiehs generally present as well. Telegraph Office and Post Office. Kerbela is also known as Mashhad Husain.

The road separates 35 m. from the Kerbela road at about mile 8, and gradually diverges from it till at Khan-al- Haswah it is 2 miles south-east of Sikandariyah village on the Baghdad-Kerbela road. From mile 8 the country is featureless, but Khan-al-Haswah itself stands upon a slight eminence. This khan is a one-storeyed building ; it has a courtyard surrounded by 38 arched recesses intended as lodging places for travellers. Behind these recesses are rows of vaulted stables. A parapet wall about 4 feet high runs all round the roof. The courtyard would accommodate 100 men, and the stables 150 animals. Attached to the khan is a village of some 60 domed brick dwellings ; 2 coffee shops, and a small Zaptieh post. The village owns a few animals, but supplies, except firewood, are practically nil. Some cultivation on the north-west side. 3 KHAN-AL-MAHA- 14 m. South. WIL. Route passes through 49 m. desert which, however, is cultivated ta some extent on the eastern side of the road. Between mile 5 and mile 9 three canals from the Euphrates cross the road ; the 2nd and 3rd are traversed by brick bridges, and the Srd is apparently the Nasriyah canal from the Euph rates.K oute N o. Z—concld. At mile 8 is Khan-an-Nasriyah, a deserted lodging on the eastern side of the road. About mile 134 a small water chan nel is crossed. Khan-al-Mahawil has walls 18 feet high outside, and is similar to last khan but in worse repair. Attached is a vil lage of about 600 inhabitants ; it is surrounded by mud walls 10 feet high and topped with thorns. One coflfee shop and a snjall Zaptieh station. A few animals and plenty of fuel • grain scarce. On the south side of the village flows the Maha- wil canal from the Euphrates with a stream in April about 20 feet wide and 12 feet deep. About 50 date palms. 4 HILL A .. 13 m. South. After crossing the 62 m. Mahawil canal by a high brick bridge in bad repair, with a roadway 10 feet wide and 12 feet above the level of the water, the route traverses a plain strewn with debris of old buildings. At mile 4 the Khatunlyah canal is crossed by a brick bridge ; and at mile 7 the Nil canal with similar bridge. To mile 10, more debris, being the remains of the city of Babylon, now represented only by the mud-walled village of Kuwairish with about 300 inhabitants. Between here and Hilla the principal canal crossed is the Wardiyah from the Euphrates. Hilla, an important town standing on both banks of the Euphrates, the two parts being connected by a bridge of 15 boats. Town largely built of ancient bricks ; population, about 30,000 souls; well-built brick barracks, large public buildings, 2,000 shops; water supply from holes, about 3 feet deep, dug in the (now dry) river bed. Estimated supplies (1908): 400 tons of wheat, 600 tons of barley, 100 tons of rice, 1,000 oxen and cows, 600 buffaloes, 300 horses, 1,000 donkeys, 60 mules, 700 camels, and 6,000 sheep. Garrison consists nominally of 1 regiment of cavalry, 3 guns and a battalion of infantry. Telegraph Office and Post OfficeROUTE No. 3. From KEKBELA to HILLA. 27 miles. 2 stages.

No supplies are obtainable except a little chopped straw. 2 KHAN HAMAD 14 m. South-east by south. About midway be- 24 m. tween Nukhailah and Khan Hamad a stream 50 yards wide and 4 feet deep, said to be a branch of the Shatt-al-Hindiyah, is twice struck on the left of the road; this appears to be part of the Si'adah, mentioned again under Route No. 6. Near Khan Hamad the country is fiat and featureless; in the direction of the Hindiyah it is culti vated to a considerable extent with low-growing crops. Khan Hamad consists of a large walled enclosure, 250 yards long by 100 yards wide, with 5 caravansarais inside it opening one into the other. In these are the usual arched cubi cles with stables behind them. The outer walls of the enclosure are 18 feet high, and as there are parapets above the roofs of the stables, the whole could be easily defended against rifle fire. There is accommodation for 500 horses and 1,000 men. Be sides the large enclosure there are 2 or 3 small khans and about 50 ordinary mud houses. Water is from wells and is said to be always sufficient, but food and fodder are scanty. To the south of the place is sandy desert, and to the north and east of it are about 400 date trees. 3 KHAN MUSALLA 12 m. South-south-east. (or Khan Mirza ) The road is sandy for 36 m. some distance after leaving Khan Hamad; it runs between the pure desert on the right and low-lying lands, connected with the HindTyah, on the left; these last are liable to inundation, but have good grazing during the cold season. About 3 miles short of Khan Musalla the going becomes better. Here is a large walled enclosure, containing two caravansarais which lead one into the other. Outside are 2 small khans and a few coffee shops; and about 200 yards to the eastward are some 30 Arab huts. The place would hold 800 horses and 600 men, but there are practically no supplies. Water is obtained from wells and from a canal which comes from the Shatt-al- Hindiyah.12 R oute N o. 4 — concld. 4 NEJEF .. 11 in. South-south-west. From Khan Musalla 47 m . to Nejef the road lies over fine sand and the going is heavy. At mile 11 Nejef, a town of some 30,000 inhabitants, situ ated on a ridge of a reddish sandstone and gravel. It has walls about 30 feet high with circular bastions every 100 yards some 50 feet in diameter. They are gradually falling to ruin. The water-supply of the place is from the Hamidiyah canal, which runs along the base of the ridge. Water for washing is obtained from the Bahr-an-Nejef, but is brackish. There are a few date plantations in the dry part of the Bahr-an-Nejef, near the town. Tha place is, however, otherwise quite destitute of natural re sources, being in the desert.

There are acacia trees and pasturage. The route then runs along the edge of the Bahr-i-Shinafiyah. At mile 16 Shinafiyah, a town of about 3,500 inhabitants, situated chiefly on the north bank of the 'Atshan continuation of the Shatt-al-Hindiyah just below its exit from the Bahr-i- Shinafiyah. The dwellings are principally huts, and there is a hdzar of $0 shops. Detail?,14 Route No. 5 {a)—contd. 7 SAMAWAH .. 36 m. East-south-east.

At mile 36, Samawah, a town of about 10,000 inhabitants. It is divided into two parts by the river, the chief part, including the Government buildings, is on the south bank, but the barracks are on the north bank. There are brick houses in both quar ters. The river is crossed by a boat bridge. There is a bazar of some 250 shops, and the place is a much frequented Bedouin market. The neighbourhood is well cultivated, a surplus of cereals, vegetables, and fruit being exported. There are 20,000 date palms, mostly on the south bank, but these are not sufficient for local requirements. Livestock and transport animals, except camels, are owned by the surrounding tribes, but it is impossible to estimate the numbers that might be forthcoming if required. 8 QASR IBN 30 m. South-east.

Zubair, a market town, with houses of sun-dried or of burnt brick, and containing a large covered bazar, mostly of masonry, and a population of about 6,000 souls. The dwelling houses are fitted with bddgirs, and possess sarddbs. The town is walled; country round is desert except to the south-east, where lies the fertile tract of Dirhamlyah, in which are the wells supplying drinking water to Zubair. It produces melons and lucerne. At Zubair Route No. 15, Basrah-Buraidah, is joined. 14 BASRAH (City) 9 m.

(a)— Routes from Baghdad to the Persian Frontier There is no concern with the details of these routes in the present book, but it may be noted that the principal are :— (1) To Khaniqin, 95 miles, via Ba'qubah, Shahraban and Qizil Rubat. . . (2) To Mandali, 79 miles, via Khan Bani Sa'ad, Buh' riz, and Baladruz. (Jb)—Routes from Baghdad to Armenia and Syria. These do not come properly within the scope of the present Route Book. The chief route from Baghdad to the north is by Dujail, Harbah, and Samarra to Tikrit, 104 miles ; while the main route to the north-west passes by Abu Ghuraib, Fallujah, Rumadiyah, and Hit, and reaches 'Anah at 216 miles. The Tikrit route follows ihe Tigris, and the 'Anah route the Euphrates li ' e ' D* '■H iih20 Route No. 7— contd. Baghdad to Damascus*. —The old postal route to Damascus lies in a fairly direct line across the shol, or desert, the general direction being west. The camel post now travels via Aleppo. Forty days is about the time taken by a laden caravan to reach the Mediterranean from Baghdad. The route here described can be traversed in ten days. There is no scarcity of water after the winter rains, and in the spring there is sufficient fodder to allow a flock of sheep to be driven across. As regards fuel, there is always enough camel- thorn at hand to start fires with, and they can be kept going with camel-dung.

After heavy rain the Wadi-al-Khar* (stage 5) would probably contain water. Water is obtainable at most stages, but it is doubtful whether it would be available ordinarily between stages 5 and 9 (111 miles), and 9 and 13 (95 miles). Up to stage 9 where there are wells, there was sufficient water for at least 800 men in January, February, and March 1910. Fuel can be obtained in small quantities in most places. Coarse grazing is to be had in plenty during the spring, and though it dries up in the summer, is always fairly abun dant for camels.

Geiierctl Dfscviption. — T hi s route, by which \\ allin travelled from Hail to Xejef in 1848, lies to the west of the Darh Zubaidah (see Route No. 10), and is probably identical with the Darb Ghazal, mentioned by Huber as being one of the subsidiary routes between Hail and the Euphrates valley. In Wallin's time this route was considered safer, but more difficult than the ordinary one, viz., the Darb Zubaidah. Wallin's hours may be reckoned of about 3 miles each, allowance being made for deviations. The general direction is to the north-north-east, but the northing apparently increases in the last 4 or 5 stages. According to Leachman, the name Darb Ghazal is at present (1910) unknown to the Arab. The following are the principal points on Wallin's route, taken in the direction in which he traversed it.30 ROUTE NO. 10. From NEJEF to HAIL. 1101 lours. 14 stages. Authorities.—J. C.

Above Basrah the banks are low and fringed with date plant ations. A few villages, clusters of mud huts, are scattered among the trees, and herds of cattle, sheep, and buffaloes graze along the banks. Much rice is grown between Basrah and Kuma. The Shatt-al-'Arab has an average width of 600 yards, a depth of 21 feet, with a current of 2| knots during the flow and 3 knots during the ebb. The bar at the mouth of the Shatt-al-'Arab is passable for ocean steamers only at high water. Th« depth and position of the best chann I over the bar ism Route No. U~contd. : always changing. At low water only about 13 feet would be found. At high water spring tides, vessels drawing 21 feefc 6 inches have scraped through the soft mud. There is usually a ten-foot tide at the bar and an f eight-foot tide as far up as Basrah. Sloops, such as the Espiegle, can ascend to 7 miles above Ezra's Tomb when the Tigris is in flood. KURNA 43f 43|m. Kuma is a place of 700 houses on the . west bank of the ligris, on the actual promontory at the junction with the old bed of the Euphrates. There are a few two-storeyed brick houses on the bank, with gardens and date plantations. It was formerly the seat of a Kaimakam under Basrah. There is a telegraph office; the two lines from Baghdad, one by the Euphrates, and the other by the Tigris, join here. From Basrah to Kuma are two wires on iron poles. The date plantations extend some 4 miles above Kurna, but after that only a few solitary clusters are to be seen until near Baghdad. Above Kurna enter the great marshes of the Tigris and Euphrates which extend between the rivers, and as far as Hawlzeh to the east. In spring and early summer the country is under water, with little visible but tall reeds and sedges. The marshes to the east are formed by the overflow of the Karkheh, Tib, and Dawairij rivers from the Pusht-i-Kuh moun tains. One outlet called by the Europeans the Hadd, but known locally as the Jahalah (always pronounced Chahalah), runs out of the Tigris just above 'Amarah. Another the Swaib, the main outlet of the Karkheh, enters the Shatt-al-'Arab about 4 miles below Kurna. AL- AZAIR 28|m. 72^ m.

There is a bridge of boats, of 23 light wooden pontoons, covered with bitumen, each 25 feet long and 10 feet broad, with a freeboard of 6 feet. The waterway is 12 feet, and the roadway 20 feet wide, of wood, with fascines covered with clay, 'Amarah is a thriving place, exporting wheat and barley from the country along the Chahalah (Hadd) channel. Be tween 'Amai -ah and Dizful, in Persia, there is a certain caravan traffic. Along the east bank there are a few date plantations and gardens. At mile 15 above 'Amarah cultivation ceases. At 'AmSrah the river is 250 yards wide, and up stream becomes wider, less water losing itself in the marshes. 'ALI-ASH-SHARQI 42 m. I 172| m. of trees.

The river is 300 to 350 yards wide and the banks slightly increase in height. At 'Ali-al-Gharbi the river makes a wide eastern bend, and approaches to within 30 miles of the Pusht- i-Kuh range, on the Persian Frontier,48 Route No. 14— contd, KUT-AL-AMARAH 73 m. | 283 m. Kut-al-Amarali is 285 miles from Basrah following the winding of the river, and 220 miles from Baghdad, It is on the east bank, contains about 500 houses of settled Arabs and Lurs, emigrated from Persia, with a row of better houses along the river front. The barracks are a square building at the west end. There is a telegraph office, connected by a short branch line (2 wires) with the main line, which crosses a loop of the river 6 miles to the east. Occasionally there were Turkish soldiers quartered here, used chiefly for overawing the Bani Lam Arabs, who roam over the desert towards the Pusht-i-Kuh. There were, however, no troops there in January, 1914.* A small fringe of gardens, irrigated by lifts, or chard.?, from the river, with a belt of country under barley and wheat, extends on both banks. Kut is a thriving place, and a regular stopping- place of steamers. The district and country along the Gharaf stream produce fair quantities of grain. A caravan route leads from here through Jassan and Badrah to Mandali, and forms the outlet for the trade of those districts. A difficult hill track leads by Zurbatieh and DehBala to Kir- manshah. A caravan route lies across the desert to Baghdad following the general direction of the Tigris, and crossing the Diyalah at the boat bridge, at its junction with the Tigris. Occasional caravans come from Shushtar and Diz.ful along the foot of the Pusht-i-Kuh ; but the Bani Lam Arabs have made this route insecure. The northern entrance of the Gharaf stream is opposite Kut. It can be navigated by river steamers when the water is high in spring. The Tigris at Kut is 400 yards wide, and above it the banks become higher. BAGHAILAH .. 47 m. J 330 m.

The town is undefended and is a disjointed collection of places the houses of which are built of brick or timber. The total population is about 58,000 inhabitants. The drinking water is fetched from the open stream of the Shatt-al-'Arab. Supplies consist of dates, wheat, barely, sugar, rice, and other foodstuffs in sufficient quantity to provision a force of 5,000 men for a month. There are a good many transport and slaughter animals in the town, and boats of various capacities are available in largo numbers. 2 HALAIBAH 50 m.

The wells at Riqa'i are situated in the south-eastern bank and are relatively high up above the general bottom of the Batin depression. It is necessary to climb up the bank to reach them. They do not always yield a supply of water, but should a flood occur in the spring water may be obtained here through out the following summer. The wells are interconnected by burrows, and the percolation is very slow, so that only a small quantity is ever available at a time.

At mile 20 two groups of mounds called Adh-Dharabain arc passed near the north-west bank. At Qasr-al-Ballfil there are the ruins of an old fort and well. The watercourse is broader here and bears some vegetation. There is no permanent water-supply throughout the last two stages, but in some of the half dozen watercourses of the 'Adhaiiy.lt water may sometimes be obtained by digging.

From Fao telegraph office to Ma amarah, at mile 6, there are difficulties, though not serious, for wheeled transport, and a rough road would have to be made to give it access to the desert. But for this the road is fit for wheels the whole way, except after wet weather, when for as much as a month at a time it becomes too soft to move carts over it. It may be said to follow the telegraph line closely and to keep within two miles of the river, and within a few hundred yards of the date groves, all fhe way. It is excellent going in dry weather throughout its whole length. From near the fort at Fao, to Ma'amarah, a new dam has been made to keep out the salt water. Horses can go along the top of this embankment, but wheeled transport would have to keep to the west side of it on desert soil, and this is generally bad going for wheels, as it is at this point a salt mud flat which never dries, and is flooded at high tides. This condition, however, ceases above Shaikh Naghaimish's village in Ma'amarah, 7 miles up stream from Fao telegraph office.

General Description. —An unmade track, ordinarily practic able for wheeled transport all the way to Basrah ; but consider able spadework would be necessary at the Mutla' Pass 3 miles north of Jahrah, as well as the' spreading of brushwood, or simi lar material to render passable the soft sand just before the pass is reached. The shortest of the land routes running between Kuwait and Basrah does not follow the one here described but leads from the Mutla' pass direct to Safwan and thereby saves about 5 miles. When the Euphrates rises to any great extent that portion of the route lying between Rafidhiyah, stage 6, and Basrah is impassable, being sometimes flooded to a depth of 2 or 3 feet. The highest flood season of the Euphrates is during the month of April. Water. —Limited and only passably good at Kuwait; plenti ful at stage 1 ; none at stages 2 and 3 ; limited at 4 ; plentiful at 5 ; good and abundant at 6 and 7. It will be noted that there is no water at all between Jahrah, stage 1, and Qash 'amyah, Stage 4, a distance of 47 miles. Water would therefore have to be stored at the two intermediate halting places, which are optional. Fuel.—Scarce throughout, except at Jahrah, stage 1, and near Rafidhiyah, stage 6. Fodder. —Fair camel grazing throughout, except perhaps at stags 3. Some lucerne is generally to be had at stages 1 and 5. i'k62 Route No. 18— contd. Supplies. \ ery limited. Certain commodities are obtain able at stage 1, but at Zubair, about 4 miles north-north-west from stage 6, all supplies are plentiful. There is also some cultivation of lucerne and melons in the Dirhamiyah tract stage 7. * KUWAK .. An open, undefend ed town, with a large . hdzar, and houses mostly built of stone. The inhabitants number about 45,000 souls. Ihere are no agricultural resources. The drinking water is lajrly good, and is from wells about 4 miles to the south of the town. Better water is, however, procurable from the wells of Qasr-as-Sirrah, 8 miles to the south-south-east of Kuwait, or from those of Mishrif, 2 miles east, of Qasr-as-Sirrah. Practicallv all foodstuffs are obtainable. There are important sea and pearl fisheries and considerable fleets of boats. Camels are procurable in fair numbers. 1 JAHRAH 20 m.

The hill on the west side is called Mutaili'ah. Through this gap a small valley discharges its drainage into the Jahrah plain ; it is called Jauf -al-Mutla' and has its head near mile o. A few miles to the west of the Jauf are some hills forming a landmark known as Khashm -al-'Ifri. After traversing the pass, and reaching the plateau, the remainder of the route is passable to all vehicles. The route now turns north by east, and runs in a straight line through the tracts of Zaqlah' Qira'al-Marru and Yah; the ^oing is level but stony. At mile 23, the route enters the Batih district, an undulat ing, perfectly waterless desert, lying somewhat high, its eleva tion varying from 130 to 210 feet. At mile 26, pass 2 mounds known as Hissu -adhrDhabi. At mile 29, the low-lying tract called Rcdhatain falls away to the east. The route then crosses over numerous slight ridges, the southerly being known as A1 Abatah, and the northerly being known as Hamar, and then passes through the locality of Batih a'-'Aul. About mile 42, the broad, shallow depression of Sil Jirfan is traversed. The Qash'anTyah welks are 6 in number, and contain good water at 18 feet.

Thence it emerges into the bazar. route for wheeled traffic goes through the city and bazar to reach the landing places on the river Shatt-al-'Arab. Animals can make their way through by various paths, as the irrigation channels are bridged for foot-passengers only. Between Zubair and Basrah there is a good, open road, but it is unmetalled. At mile 16, Basrah, a town scattered about in vast date groves with a population of about 58,000. The water-supply is from the river Shatt-al-'Arab. There is a large bazlr and some shops dealing in European goods There are large numbers of cattle and sheep, which graze along the river bank. Dates and rice are extensively cultivated. There is plenty of garden produce. Arrangements can easily be made for river transport. .There are the river companies' steamers, and large numbers of native boats of 30 tons and under. Considerable supplies of coal are stored in Basrah, for the river steamers, the average stock of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Co. being about 800 tons.

As soon as the Shaqq valley is crossed a six-fold track is struck which constitutes the main route into Qaslm. It is, however, easily lost sight of amongst the hamdh bushes, and should therefore be carefully watched as there are no landmarks along this portion of the Dibdibah steppe.

At mile 9 the general route to Qaslm is struck. It consists of six parallel tracks. During the first few miles of this stage the hill of Umm-al-'Amarah forms an indistinct landmark to the south-west. Water is said to collect there after heavy rain. The route then traverses poorer country without landmarks. At mile 53 is the khabrah of Umm-al-Hamir, whence the route ascends a series of terraces. The ground then si pes sharply down towards some wells in the Rijm-ar-Riq'ai and situated on, the south-east bank. Just above these wells the route crosses a mountain torrent which, in January 1906, made a waterfall 10 feet high and between 40 and 50 feet wide. The wells of Riq'ai are dotted about in the torrent bed. This is a treble stage. The intermediate halting places are optional, water as a rule not being obtainable.

After a slight ascent the track descends into the Shaqq at mile 25. Thence to mile 65 the route crosses a bare, gravelly desert known as A1 Qarra a, devoid of vegetation and rising slightly towards the north-west. At mile 70, where the tract of Mujdair is entered, a track from Kuwait via the wells of Jadadiyah joins this route on the right. About mile 90 several dry watercourses are crossed. At As-Safah there are some 20 wells averaging 150 feet deep. They are situated in a basin which has steep gravelly, clay cUiis of about 100 feet high on its northern edge, down which come rain torrents from the tableland further to the north. The well water is sweet, but becomes yellow and fouled after heavy rain. As-Safah is about half-way between Kuwait and Zilfi. From As-Safah a track leads north-west to Hafar wells, 73 miles distant, the last 22 miles being along the Falaij Jamibiyah. Another track leads from As-Safah almost due south to A - Qarra'a wells, 25 miles. Thus the three routes from Kuwait to Najd via Hafar, As-Safah, and Al-Qarra'a, are inter- connected. 12 ZILFI 140 m.

General Description. —A somewhat troublesome desert route the general direction of which is a little to the south of west by south. After emerging from the Wadi Faruq at the beginning of stage 3, the route crosses the desolate Summan tract during the remainder of that stage ; and for the next two days it undulates over the sandy ridges of the even more inhospitable Dahanah desert. The country then becomes _ a barren plain which continues until the milder district of 'Aridh is entered. Pilgrims from Qatar and the Hasa Oasis when going to Mecca generally follow this route as ffir as Riyadh. They start from Hofuf about the 8th of Dhil Qa'dah, and take 2.1 days to reach Mecca, some of the shorter stages being com bined and occasional halts made elsewhere. Water. —There is no water between Hofuf and stage 7, and sufficient must therefore be taken from Hofuf to last till Abu Jifan is reached, a distance of 137 miles. From here to Riyadh water is plentiful. Fuel. —Very scarce to stage 7, except perhaps in the Wadi Faruq, where desert bushes are obtained. Fairly abundant at stages 8 and 9, and at Riyadh.

Water.—The water-supply on this route is not very abund ant, and is generally rather bitter except at stage 6, and in the Wadi Hanifah (stages 10 and 11) after good rains when a running stream is formed there. It seems doubtful whether water would be obtainable at all at stages 3—5 except after rain.

F rom 'ANAIZAH to MECCA. 477 miles. 1% stages. • Authorities. —C. M. Doughty. 1878. Persian Gulf Gazetteer. 1908. Epiton-'e. General Description. —This route is parallel to the Kuwait- Mecca route through Buraidah and is distant from it onh a few miles south-eastwards. It was traversed by Doughty in 1878 and by Huber in 1S84 ; an analysis of Doughty'? stages to the point where they become identical with those of Route No. 40 is given below. Disputes with Bedouins as to the use of the wells give less trouble on this route, but the watering places are further apart and are not so good as on the Buraidah- Mecca line. The journey is not to bo undertaken, in summer at least, without considerable hardship from scarcity of water. The large samn caravans which go from Anaizah to147 R oute N o . 39— contd. Mecca every summer travel this way; otherwise, apparently, this track is not much used, for wood is still abundant near some of the halting-places. The Qaslm caravans are protected on the way by 'Ataibah Rafiqs, most of the journey being through 'Ataibah territory. Huber's route, which is the usual one, diverged from Doughty's at Shablblyah, rejoining it at Umm-al-Masha'ib : between these points it lies further to the east, by the wells of Dukhnah and Shibirmah. The caravans which Doughty and Huber accompanied each halted for two nights at 'Afif. There is another route between 'Anaizah and Mecca further to the eastward: it is called Darb Wadi Sabai,'* has few and small watering places, and is used only by well- mounted men travelling rapidly. The following is chiefly abstracted from Doughty :— Water. —There is'no water at stages 2 and 5. Fuel. —A small quantity of desert bushes is probably ob tainable along all the stages, but the supply would be scarce on the stages where there is no water. Fodder. —Coarse grazing may possibly be had all along this route, at any rate in small quantities, but it would be burnt up in the hot weather. Supplies. —Obtainable at 'Anaizah and Mecca. No. of stage and total Details, dis tance. ANAIZAH .. A large walled town of 10,000 to 15,000 inhabitants. The houses are clay-built, many having upper storey. There is a hdzdr of 120 shops.

An important town enclosed by .a thin wall about 12 feet high and built of sun-dried bricks, and said to contain 5,000 houses mostly constructed of stone and mud, and plastered. The po pulation is estimated at 25,000 inhabitants. The town is divided into three wards, one of which is called Kut, a fortified enclosure with sides about 600 yards long and completely surrounded by a ditch. The Turkish garrison was formerly quartered in this enclosure, which was also the resi dence of the Turkish official community. It contains a fine mosque, a well-built hospital, and two forts. The town possesses innumerable wells with fair water at about 24 feet,' but the sup plies, consisting of ghi, sugar, rice, and cloth, are very limited,167 Route No. 44— conid.

Epitome. t General Description. —A camel track across stretches of sandy desert, mostly dunes and undulating downs. No villages en route nor settled inhabitants. No physical obstacles are met with except the tidal salt water creek crossed at Al-Maqta' * at stage 1. The creek is only fordable at low tide and at a particular point, where the water reaches to a horse's girths when crossing under favourable conditions. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi maintains a watch tower at the fort, together with a small guard whose business it is to warn travellers when and where it is safe to cross. The re 'is a village named Baraimi In the oasis, but ordinarily when the term is used outside the oasis it refers to the settlement as a whole and not to the particular village. Travellers entering from the Trucial coast would probably go under the auspices of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, and would camp in one of the villages of his adherents on the west of the oasis The guides employed by Major Cox came from Jimi village Water.

F ROM RAS-AL-KHAIMAH TO EARAIMI. 125 miles. 7 stages. Authorities and dates. —Major P. Z, Cox, December, 1905. Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908. Epitome. General Description. —-This route is the main artery of traffic through the ' Oman promontory. There can hardly be said to be any recognisable or well-worn track between Ras-al-Khaimah and the Baraimi Oasis ; in fact no two caravans follow exactly tin same course, for where the route crosses sand dunes, a track is obliterated as soon as made. The route under report is usually traversed by caravans in from 6 to 8 days. Camel transport is the only kind used in travelling by this line ; for donkeys, the only other beast of burden available, cannot, when laden, negotiate the sandy tracts that have to be crossed on the way. There is reason to think that, by following a line somewhat further to eastwards and more closely adjoining the foot of the main hills, a route might be found which couid without much labour be adapted for wheeled traffic. During the great heat between May and Septem ber caravans would have to travel by night. Wafer. —Plentiful throughout during the winter months except at Ras -al-Khaimah, where it is scarce and indifferent; and at Qallah Mahafidh (stage 3-), where there is none. The halting place at stage 6 is 4 miles short of the Misakin v ell, and water skins should therefore be replenished, if necessary, at Safwan. There would probably be a general scarcity of water during the summer months. The wells are usually from 40 to 60 feet deep, and revetted from 8 to 10 feet near the surface either with timber or stones. The water is invariably drawn with a rope and bucket. Fuel. —Plentiful everywhere except here and there for short distances. Fodder. —^Plentiful throughout for camels, in the winter months at any rate, except for some miles at the beginning of stage 4.

The ground is generally sandy and sound, but in places where there is more earthy soil than usual and where watei stands after rain, the surface becomes greasy at first and subsequently dries up and cracks. At mile 14, the two wells of Bu-Ya'ilan. At mib 16, the two wells of Hamranlyah, on the east of the track situated in the plain in a green oasis with good shade from 4 or 5 acacia trees. , At Hadaithah the wells are situated in an open plain, and are surrounded by trees. There are two wells, each 60 feet deep. 2 FARAIKH .. 18 m, The general direc tion is a little west of 36 m. south. The route continues to follow the western margin of Jiri plain and passes the wells of Saadi at mile 5. Meanwhile the fine stretch of date-palms belonging to village of Khatt can ba seen nestling under the conspicuous peak of that name. At mile 9J-, the village of Ahdan lies about 4 .1- miles to the east, through which a route leads by way of the Wadi Ham to Fujairah. See Route No. 51. At mile 11 A, a high undulating tract of sand is entered through which a winding course is pursed to mile 15J.

Half a mile down the wadi to the west is a cluster of white mounds of chalky clav, thrown up during the excavations made in order to start the underground aqueduct by which the water is directed from this spot to Falaj Al 'Ali, a small date plantation and oasis. The faJaj at its commencement is called Thiqbat-as-Sanabil. Soon after crossing the wadi the towers of Dhaid come into eiaht, and at mile 5^ that village is reached. Here routes from Sharjah (No. 48) and Al-Hamriyah (No. 49), both leading to Mu- rair, are crossed. This important settlement is watered by means of an aqueduct which enters it from the east through the precincts of a walled en losure, with towers at the corners, where the Gover nor lives. Where the water enters the settlement it is 2 feet deep and 3 feet broad. From Dhaid tracks ; lead ma the Wadis Ham and Qor to the eastern ' Oman coast. To mile 7J, across the level Dhaid plain. The route then drops into the Wadi Kathairah, which it follows to the wells of Wushah at mile 9J.

From here the track serpentines southward across a well-wooded, sandy plain, and keeps parallel to, and near the eastern slopes of, Jabal Faiyah. At miie 12, the well of Yahfar-al-Faiyah. This well is on the' route usually followed from Dibai to the Batinah coast, via the Hatta valley. See Route No. 47, Dibai-Shinas, which is crossed. At mile 18, the well of Musaifi, also a single boring. The tract within which it lies is called the Madam plain, and contains several wells. From the Musaifi well the fine, isolated, bluff peak of Jabal Rodhah lies about 2 miles to the eastward. To the «outh of and almost contiguous with it193 Route No. 53— conld. is the long hogaback hill of Jabal Samaini. Both of these are westward of, and separated from, the main spinal range of 'Oman.

From Musaifi southwards there is no special track, and caravans can go either by Aiyyuh, or by Yidaiyah. From the latter, the track runs south-south-east for about 5 miles to avoid sandhills, and keeps in the Madam plain. Between 10 and 12 miles the route crosses a projecting tongue of the western sand desert. At mile 14, it crosses the Wadi Samaini, in which it con tinues almost until the halting place is reached. The later is also sometimes .called Khasaib. 6 MISAKIN .. 16 m. The average iirec- , tion of the track, 105 m. which is crooked, is a little west of south. At mile 1, Wadi Samaini is crossed, and one of its tributaries is ascended to mile 3. The rolling sand hills of Ramlat 'Anaij are then crossed to mile 6, after which the hat-lid Sanaibil is intersected. Herein is the well of Zakar, about half a mile off the track to the west. Beyond this nd'd or wash-out, another stretch of sand dunes has to be negotiated, but these are more gently undu lating and less barren. At mile 9, the peculiar well of Safwan. It is situated in the centre of a circular knoll of the shape of an inverted pudding bowl. » At mile 11, the track crosses the dry Wadi Nawaii, and then ascends to the sandy Shibhat-al-Khadim tract, em brae- ing a depression in which lies the Wadi Misakin.

The track next runs south over the gentle sandv undulation of Batin-al-'UyantomileS. Then, to mile 15, it winds over the difficult desert of Ram- lat Kahal. This inhospitable tract is a maze of hills and valleys of loose drifting sand in which tracks are obliterated as soon as made. There are, moreover, no landmarks visible for guidance ; and caravans should therefore keep in close order whilst passing over it.

From Dihah in Matrah it is a good broad camel track. Rain i s inclined to make the going difficult, as numerous small streams overflow about the country, but where the route is near the sea caravans can move a ong the beach. Some of the streams are deep and swift enough, when m flood, to wash away a donkey. All the coast villages engage in fishing. There are no springs in this district, but water is obtained from wells about 15 20 feet deep Fever is prevalent during the date harvest. From Matrah to Masqat is a bad bit of going, and the iournev is generally done by boat. From Masqat it - is not certain whether any true coast route exists, but there are so manv villages along the coast fairly close to one another that it is not unlikely that they should be connected by direct paths At the same time the practicability of such paths for transport of any sort is entirely problematical.

The route now ascends gradually towards the head of the valley, where it rises suddenly over the col on the low hill knoAvn as Jabal Falaij, and drops down into the village of Mazum on the southern side of it. A cluster of hamlets, known as Mamur (Falaij Bani Qitab, or Aflaj Bani Qitab), is seen and left about a couple of miles to the south-east. The pas sage over the col is difficult for camels on account of the boul ders with which it is strewn, and the steepness of the descent on the southern side. All difficulties and obstructions could, however, be removed with very little trouble. At mile 14 Mazum, a strongly walled village with a guarded entrance, which is somewhat imposing. It is tenanted by a colony of Baluchis. 5 'IBRI . • .10 m. The route traverses an undulating waste, 9Q m&gt; sometimes stony, some times sandy, and Avith sparse vegetation.

From the crest a good view is obtained of the ex tensive basin below, containing the villages of Ghubbi, Araqi, Bait-al-'Ainain, and Dariz, and stretching away for a good many miles to the Jabal Misht and Jabal Kur. At mile 19 Tbri, a town of 5,000 inhabitants, situated under a low white hill called Harbarah. The houses of the poorer classes and the hazdr, which is large and well supplied, form a compact block of buildings round the fort; the houses of the rich are scattered about in the date groves.

It crosses the bed of the wadi and a small tract of higher ground, and then drops into a dry watercourse, Wadi Salaif, which trends southwards, effecting a junction with Wadi Sanaisal lower down at Dibaishi. At the point where the route meets Wadi Salaif, the ivddi has just emerged from a natural gateway, which it has formed in forcing its way through an isolated chain of narrow hills about 300 feet high. At mile 2, Salaif, a small fort and village lying astride the wadi. From here the route follows a wadi in the direction of Jabal-al- Kur, but at mile 10, after passing round the spur, it turns to the south, crossing and recrossing the toadi. Finally it leaves the wadi bed altogether, and the rest of the way to Kubarah is over fairly level and easy ground. The route throughout this stage offers n o difficulties whatever as the wddi bed is shingly and free from boulders, and once it is left the soil is sandy.

A little beyond the cleft, and on the same side as it, lie the villages of Dan and Nadan ; date groves, and water from streams. At mile 18 the route crosses a pass called Najd-al-Makharim, at about 2,500 feet, between Jabal-al-Kur and Jabal Hamra, which is easier on the whole than the Najd-al-Barak pass at the northern end of the Jabal-al-Kur.

This ascent is very difficult for camels as there is practically no path. From here a small valley, Wadi Saifam (VVadi 'Ali), can be seen running south. The descent is easier than the ascent; about half-way down the slope is a stretch of sand and pebbles, on which are located two shepherd hamlets, Sint and Sunt. The route now falls into the Wadi 'Ain, at this elevation a rugged ravine, but further down the valley there is a large and seemingly impor tant stream of running water. At about mile 15 the village of Hail Bani Hina (R) situated at the foot of a hill, notched along its ridge like a comb, with an elevation of about 2,000 feet; 100 houses, 25 camels. 50 donkeys, 600 sheep and goats, scanty cul tivation.^ The going is much better along the Wadi ' Ain.

The path sometimes zigzags up a very steep gradient, and sometimes passes along easier places. When the watercourse is left, the gradient becomes more formidable, and the mountain presents sheer perpendicular cliffs and bold buttresses. Here the path would be quite impassable for animals had it not been artificially improved by the construction of a series of rough steps, formed of huge slabs of stone, and the revetting up of the road in places where it overhangs the precipice.

Fuel and fodder are obtainable at, or along, all stages. Supplies, in fairly large quantities, could be collected on all the stages. Cereal cultivation diminishes towards the lower end of the valley, giving place almost exclusively to that of dates. Donkey transport could be arranged for on a large scale. Dstails. SIB .. .. A very scattered village con sisting of groups of mat huts, and containing per haps 2,000 inhabitants. There is one masonry house about a mile from the shore, occupied by the Wall.

It is at present only suitable for donkey transport, but according to Major P. Z. Cox it might be made passable for camels to stage 1. Water, fuel, and fodder can be got in the villages, but except for the cultivation in the vicinity of the villages the country is barren. Supplies are absolutely unobtainable, with the possible ex ception of a few goats in the villages.255 Route No. 68— concld. 2 MUTI .. 12 m. East-south-east. The route ascends 31 m. the other side of the glen by steps, and passes over much rugged and uneven ground. It then crosses a level tract of country overgrown with brambles. At mile 1, Hfidin, a village on the open plain with cereal and fruit cultivation. * At mile 1|, the route descends a pass for about 700 feet, and Sharaijah is reached. It is situated on very rough and uneven ground, and lies in terraces on the side of the cliff. There are about 200 houses, small and square, and solidly built of stone. The water-supply is from a stream which is collected in a deep and capacious reservoir, whence it irrigates the cultivation in the valley, consisting of orchards and cornfields. Here starts a track to Birkat-al-M5z. See Route No. 76 (w). After crossing the Wadi Makal, in which lies the village of Hail, the route rises gradually to the eastern crest of the Jabal Akhdhar, the general elevation of which is about 7,000 feet. The route then runs for some distance at the same level, and skirts a conspicuous peak named Khazr, the summit of which must approach 8,000 feet. On reaching the southern face of the Jabal Khazr the route zigzags for some distance down a salient, until it reaches a col where there is a small masjid, and resting-place for travellers, with a well. From this point there is a very steep staircase descending abruptly into the Wadi Halfain some 3,000 feet below and only passable for men, and for donkeys accus tomed to it.

MASQAT A town, consisting of a wallecl qxiarter of ;28 houses and 300 shops, outside which arc suburbs with 855 houses ; the town is surrounded by hills through which there are only difficult passes, defended by a system of blockhouses. The population in winter, when it is at its greatest, is about 10,000. There is a boat-building yard, where small cargo boats can be made and larger ones repaired. The shipping consists of 9 baghlahs, 32 large hurls for loading and unloading cargo, 130 small hiiris for the passenger traffic between Matrah and Masqat, and a large num ber of fishing boats. There are 30 cattle, and 200 sheep and goats, mostly fed on fish. Supplies, etc., all have to be imported. Masqat has a good harbour, though landing is difficult when the sha mdl is blowing, and with the exception of Dibai, and is the only port of call for steamers in 'Oman. As the town lies at the end of a cove surrounded by huge rocky hills it has only difficult means of communication with the interior. Matrah supplies this want, and is the local centre for trade with the interior of 'Oman. 1 AL-BIRAIN .. 14 m. General direction, a large town consisting mostly of hovels and huts, with a few good houses, and containing altogether about 14,000 souls. Thi !re is a large block of buildings occupied by Khojahs, and known as the Khojah Fort. Water fairly plentiful from wells, some of those lying to the south-west of the Jabru maidan containing very good water. Matrah is the loading and unload- ing place for caravans for and from the interior. It has a large bazar containing supplies of rice, dates, sugar, ghi, fish and vegetables. Considerable numbers of camels and donkeys are available at short notice. There are generally a dozen horses or so at Wataiyah 3| miles out of the town, Matrah owns 2C bnghlahs, 25 badans and many Tiiiris, 14 m. about south-west. At mile 2i, Matrah, \259 Route No. 70— contd. At mile 4, pass Bait-al-Falaj, a residence of the Sultan of Masqat.

The route asrends the wddi with a gentle gradient along a good gravelly bed cut through coarse conglomerate. Near here the outlet to the Wadi 'Amdah is passed on the eafet of the route. There is a path through this wadi to the Wadi Tayin, which is shorter and morq direct than by the Qahza Pass, but it is very difficult, and at one place is no more than a foot broad with a wall of rock on one side and a precipice on the other. The route continues up the ravine, the gradient gradually increasing. Above the route towers a lofty peak on each side, that on the west being known as the Jabal Sail. At about mile 8 the most troublesome part of the ascent commences by a zig-zag path so steep and insecure that camels can only be got along it with the greatest difficulty. The top of the pass is reached at about mile 13. Altitude 3,900 feet. At the southern side of the watershed the route enters the Wadi Mughairah; the descent 2L2260 Route No. 70— concld. is steeper and the path more rugged and formidable than the Wadi Qahza. Vegetation (acacias, tamarisks, etc.), is fairly abundant. The route would be a torrent after heavy rains. Camels have to be led over this pass.

There are three principa} routes which conduct from the coast to the interior of the 'Oman Sultanate, namely one from Matrah or Sib, by Wadi Samail to 'Oman Proper, which is central and the most important of all; one on the east from Sur to Ja'alan by Wadi Falaij; and one on the west from Sohar to Baraimi by Wadi-al-Jizi. The chief lateral communi cations in the interior are a line from Ja'alan which traverses Sharqiyah to 'Oman Proper, connecting the Wadi Falaij and Wadi Samail route, and two from Baraimi across Dhahirah into 'Oman Proper, one via Najd-al-Makharim, the other vid Najd-al-Barak, joining the route from the coast by Wadi-al- Jizi with that by Wadi Samail. These are all easily passable for loaded camels and present no difficulties as to water, while other supplies also are abundant on the Samail route. Subsidiary routes in Western. Hajar are that xrom Batinah to Dhahirah by Wadi-al-Hawasinah, and that from Batinah by Wadi Bani Kharus and over Jabal Akhdhar into Oman Proper ; the first is passable by camels, the second only by donkeys. Parallel routes to the interior are said to lie between these up Wadi Bani Ghafir and Wadi iara , and to bo practicable for camels, but neither of them has been used in its entirety by a European traveller. Minor routes in Eastern Hajar lead from Wadi Samail, or from Saih Hatat by the Qahza pass, into Wadi Mansah and thence into Wadi Tayin ; these can be used by camels. ^ Two other routes, over the 'Amdah and Manqal passes, respectively, give access from Saih Hatat to Wadi Tayin, but they are more difficult than those already described. There is also a camel route down Wadi Tayin from its head to the sea at Daghmar ; and one or two routes exist between Tayin and bharqlyah, the best known being that which runs up Wadi Khabbah from Ghubrat-at-Tam, but their character is not well ascertained. There is also a route, in favour with natives of the country, which connects Wadi Samail with Sharqiyah by way of Wadi- Ja'alan is easily accessible from Khor Jaramah by a route that crosses Jabal Khamis into Wadi J- alaij. 2m277 R oute N o . 76— cmtd. The following additional facts about routes in 'Oman were supplied by Lieutenant C. H. Gabriel and others from native information in 1905 :— (w) Routes from Barkah and Masna'ah to Rustaq converge at Jammah in Wadi Fara' and thence ascend Wadi Fara' to Rustaq. Tho distances from Barkah and Masna'ah, respectively, are 10 and 6 hours by caravan, (n) A route from Suwaiq to Rustaq reaches Wushail in Wadi Fara' and thence follows Wadi Fara' to Rustaq. Distance 8 hours by caravan. (o) A route from Masna'ah to Dhank lies up Wadi Banl Ghafir from Dihas to Khafdi; it then reaches Miskin, in Wadi-al-KabTr. From Miskin, there are alterna tive ways to Dhank, one via 'Aridh in Wadi-al-KabTr and Yanqul in Wadi Dhank, the other via Khadal in Wadi-al-Jailah and Fida in Wadi Dhank. Distance to Miskin 10 hours by caravan (apparently under estimated), and thence by the alternative ways 12 and 24 hours, respectively. (p) A route from Suwaiq to Dhank follows Wadi Bani Ghafir from Hoqain to Khafdi and beyond that point is identical with the last route. Total distance 30 hours by caravan. (q) A route from Khaburah to 'Ibri follows Wadi-al-Hawasi- nah from Ghaizain to Mijzi, whence Miskin in Wadi-al- KabTr is reached; from Miskin it continues down Wadi-al-Kabir toDariz and so to'Ibri. Total distance 24 hours by caravan. (r) A route from Khaburah joins the ordinary Wadi-al-Jizi route from Sohar to Baraimi at Sahailah in Wadi-al- Jizi. Distance from Khaburah to Sahailah 12 hours by caravan. (s) There is a route from Saham to Yanqul which goes by Falaj-ash-Shakhariyin and Wuqbah in Wadi 'Ahin. Distance 18 hours by caravan. (i) The way from Yanqul to 'Ibri is vid 'Aridh in Wadi-al- KabTr, down that wddi to Dariz, and so to 'Ibri. Distance 9 hours by caravan.

After a short distance the village of Musairah (200 houses) is reached where there is a small date plantation at an unusual elevation. Further on is the village of Mi aiclin (30 houses) watered from 2 falajt, giving a plentiful supply of water ; there are date, lime and other fruit trees. 1 hree miles further on is Misfah (40 houses), a small hamlet. Up to this point the breadth of the undi is nowhere more than 100 yards, and in places it is overhung by cliffs 2,000 3,000 feet high, but after passing Misfah the banks begin to recede and to decrease in height.

A few towers in vicinity. Rounding the east slopes of Haid Minuwa, track bears south-cast, ascending a gradual slope on to the plateau of Mahfid, crosses Wadis Shab and Laba- kha near their confluence, and curves cast towards Jidhaba. Jidhaba is a small fortified hamlet close to the similar hamlets of Kubth and Mahfuz, all of which are inhabited by chiefs and families of the ruling clan of the district. The track descends gradually from the plateau in a north west direction among stony debris, crosses Wadi Faki and rising slightly passes between two long barrows to BTr-ba-Likam a well close to Wadi Maria. Several villages west of the track about here. {There are no indicalionn as to where camp should be. Mr. Bury himself stopped at Jidhaba. fro itmhich place Blr-ba-L/ikarn cannot he any distance.

Crossing Wadi Maria, track leads north- 87 m. west through a broad tract of arable land into Wadi Rnfal at about mile 1, a narrow wooded gorge, between two peaks of Haid Sahaba, soon bearing north-east and then curving to north-west. Here track leaves it and passes north-east on stony plateau on left bank, called Jol-al'Irqah; frontier village of 'Irqah between Upper and Lower Aulaki (2,197 feet) is passed at about mile 5. Here track rejoins the wddi ; a small tract of arable land. The wddi passes close to the tower of Hisn-al-Golb and curves north round a strong post with stone zariba, Hisn Kanab, and bears east past Husn-al-Makrosa, where the path rejoins it, having cut across a low spur from just below Hisn Kanab at about mile 6. Half a mile further to the north is the confluence of wddis Ratal and Edth, The ravine is thickly wooded ; a small tower close to which are Bedouin encampments with a spring reported near by is pasisecj.318 TIoute No, 89-~contd. At mile 7, Wadi Ernima joins Wadi Edth, which has been followed north. Track proceeds up Wadi Ernima north-east, with high and precipitous mountains on both sides. A mile up the Ernima, is a stony plateau at north-west edge of which track leaves the wadi and winds up the east side of a ravine f01 med by 2 bold peaks called Al-Bikar. Reaching the summit of this pass, track descends 50 feet and curves east up a gentle rise between 2 precipitous ranges, then turning north zigzags up the Thebt pass, which is very steep and, in places, consists of mere steps cut in the rock (4,901 feet). The summit is reached between mile 8 and mile 9. Descent north -north-east easy after first bit; path enters Wadi Thebt, narrow sandv bed with low hills on both sides and wooded.

Much cultivation here and irrigation wells, which work all dav, at average intervals of i mile. Yashbum stands on a low isolated hill on the right bank of the wadi which sweeps boldly above and below the town in opposite curves forming a huge letter S. The town is a walled mercantile settlement. It is the market town and nu cleus of an extensive vaUey settlement. There is a small dye- mg industry, and cotton, imported raw from Nisab, is spun. 1 y far the most important and characteristic product of Yash- ) nm valley is its honey, which it exports all over Arabia, to Zanzibar and even to India. The ' dom ' or fruit of the ' elb * (jujube tree) is the staple fruit of the valley, where it ripens in March and is dried and pounded, stone and all, for food. A day s caravan journey down the Yashbum valley is the merchant town of Habban, beyond which again is the walled town of Izzan, the headquarters of the Abdul Wahid Sultan. ^ SAJNA 14 m.

Just before mile 2 it leaves it bearing east, pass Medal and up the Furda pass on the approach to which are tall jujube trees. The track runs along the crest of the ridge above the village of Al-Kawlah of the Ahl-ba-Ras. Descending it re enters Wadi Yashbum and keeps along its shingly bed through rich cultivation, which is park-like and well-wooded with large jujube trees. Said, a town with towers, is passed on the right at mile 5, and Wasitah on the left. Track continues east and enters a gorge, the wddi, here called Marbun, turning south. At mile 8 track follows centre of 3 ravines, Wadi Hebra, west- north-west, for a mile, then turns south-west up a narrow pass, descends into another ravine, ascends a long gentle slope at the summit of which is the large cairn of Shaikh 'Obaid, and descends to a level plain thinly wooded with mimosa and ' ushr. ' Crossing a small tributary of Wadi Mukbila, the path passes the two small settlements of Serra and Ad-Dakhol and curves er.st to As-Saina. Saina consists of two distinct vil lages standing on a hill from north of the road. It is princi pally inhabited by weavers and dyers. There is a small tract of cultivation, and also several wells, which form the last ade quate water-supply until Nisab is reached. 7 NISAB .. 28 m. Path crosses Midab and Khumar, bearing 129 m. west-north-west across the level but sterile and sandy plain of Jol-ad-Dabra; good going. Through a gap in the foothills to the east may be seen the towers of the Ahl-Hamam settlement of As Surr. Past this village runs a track leading, according to native reports, to the Hadhramaut valley in 5 days' march for a caravan. The intervening district is said to be drifting sand and waterless. Some miles beyond this point an isolated rock, Qarn-adh- Dhib, lies to the left of, and about a mile from, the path, and contains water after rain for some months. Beyond the Qarn-adh-Dhib (the Wolfs Pock) the foothills bounding the plain close in and form a defile. On passing the defile the Jol-al- Mutti plain is entered, the track turns north, crosses and re- crosses Wadi Hanak, which it follows till the hills draw in again on either side and the path rounding a mountain spur leaver the wddi a::d turns east apross a sandy plain tp Nisab.320 'Route No. 89— concld. Nisab is an unwalled mercantile town of some 4,000 inhabit ants. It is built of stone and mud and contains a fine mosque and several good houses. It lies in the midst of broad tracks of cultivation, chiefly indigo, cotton and millet, in the fork formed by the junction of the Wad is Dhura and Abdan. The former wadi comes down from behind Medak, the ' dar ' of the I pper Aulaki .Sultan, which is situated 4 miles from the town on a prominent hill. Towards the west and south-west of the town the fortified towers of Labas, Khandul and Herashat, each on a commanding knoll, cover the approaches to the lown from these directions. Nisab grows cotton and indigo to a considerable extent though the crops are much affected b\ occasional dfoughts. Cultivation depends largely on the alluvial resources of the wadis that water the plain. The district often runs short of grain in a droughty season, and the Sultan has a standing arrange ment for its supply from the neighbouring settlement of Markhah. E nd of P art I.PART fl. ROUTES IN SOUTH-WESTERN, WESTERN AND NORTH-WESTERN ARABIA.323 ROUTE No. 90. m (a) From SHUQRAH to NISAB (via MIS-HlL). 122 miles. 9 stages. Authorities and Dates. —Mr. J, T. Bent, March, April, 1897 ; Mr. G. W. Bury, Feb ruary, 1899; Lieutenant Kensington, January 1904. Epitome. N. B. —Beyond Ad-Dakhlah this route has been condensed and arranged in route form from Mr. Bury's account of his journey and from his book The Land of Uz, and the distances have been measured on the map made by him. Details as to water are very scanty. It is therefore impossible to give any estimate of amount procurable or say whether the route is correctly staged. Mr. Bury's and Lieutenant Kensington's estimates of the distances from Shuqrah to Rahwat-al-Makana and thence to Mis-hal differ somewhat. Lieutenant Kensington's estimate has been followed ; Mr. Bury's being 13 miles for •stage 1 and 14 for stage 2. General Description. —General direction is east-north-ervst. This is a slightly shorter route to Nisab than Route No. 89 as it is more direct from the coast but it is more difficult on account of the bad water-supply in the first three stages, and the bad nature of the pass across the Kaur range between Dathinah and Dhahir, which is only fit for donkeys. For the first stage the track is bad, leading as it does through rough country into the hills of the coast range and thence by a steep and narrow pass, the Rahwat-al-Makana, on to the plain of Jahain at 17 miles. Once this upland is reached the track is firm and good, fra- versing the plains of Mis-hal and of the Ahl-as-Si di as far a4 Al-Mijdaat 55 miles, except for about 2| miles of bad going over loose stones after mile 23 where the Wadi-an-Nakh'ain is reached. The 18 miles of stages 5 and 6 across the Kaur are very difficult, and must only be attempted with donkeys. Crossing the Dhahir plateau from Sauma'ah the track in stage 7 again becomes difficult for anything but donkeys or lightly laden hill camels for some 5 miles along an 'aqabah until the Wadi Khaura is entered 2p2324 Koute No. % -contd. at 81 milos. The track follows this wadi for a stage and a ha f as far as Hauta, mile 104, whence it turns east through low lulls and stony plateau to the valley of Nisab. WcUer.—WMev has to be carried for stage 1, and should bo earned for stage 2, as the water at Mis-hal is impotable. Stages 3 and 9 are practically waterless.

It is divided into two parts about 2 mile apart, the palace and other chief buildings bein* in tne easterly portion nearest the sea, the other portion bcino- the commercial and fishing quarter. This town lies in Fadhli terri- tory and is the chief port between Aden and Mukalla. It con- st'tutes the focus of trade between Aden and the Upper Yafa and Aulaki districts. There is a large I shing industry. There is a small harbour for boats with a depth of 1—2A fathoms formed by a break in the reef which fronts the shore. thorns Ca 0ute]de the reef is g ood anchorage in 7 to 9 The Wadi Mathwan finds an outlet just to the east of the p-ace.

The'chief one, a large well with plenty of good water, is 400 yards north of the palace and close to the Wadi Mathwan. Most supplies are procurable here, but any large quantity would have to be brought from a distance. There is no fuel on the spot but it can be obtained in a few hours. Ihe country in the immediate neighbourhood of the town is absolutely des titute of trees or cultivation except for a small garden where a few vegetables can be obtained. The best place for a camp is the open ground near the tovvu between the Wadis Udeba and Mathwan, the rest of the country being sandhills. 1 RAHWAT-AL- •• 16 m. Leaving Shuqrah MAKANA. the track s 0 ^ P ar ; ! to the coast for about U miles and then turns inland. At mile 3 it crosses a dry river bed and 400 yards further on it begins to ascend with an average slope of 3° and not more than 4° m any place. The road itself is only a camel track and is very stony, making the going decidedlv bad ; it consists of volcanic debns, of which there aie quantities on both sides of the road. At mile 10 the road crosses the Wadi-ath-Themalul. Somewhere below this point water is generally to be found. The water in the Wadi Themalul consists of rain pools which have generally been so fouled by camels that even horses will not drink it, but there is a spring whteh changes fts position frequently and there fairly good water may be obtain ed. Information should be obtained of the water here not moie than a dav before it is required and by a party of one 8 Own men, not from Arata. Arabs like to halt for the eight a Wadt-ath- Themalul, but it is a bad place and it is advisable to reach t head of the pass. After crossing the wadi the road commenc • its only steep ascent, which is from 2S0 to o00 yards long, with a slope of 7°. At the top of this the road turns a good deal more t the east with a rise of 3° for J mile, where it turns again to the north with an average rise of 1° for rather over a mile. Jor tho next Vi miles the road, except for one small place, ^ uuls a o the bed; of small wadis with a very s ight use but owm to tl^ gravelly nature of the soil it is very heavy. One of these' I 326 Route No. OO—contd. is called the Wadi Samluf. Plenty of trees and fuel and grazing for camels may be obtained all along here. There is plenty of ground in the vicinity where a camp could be pitched but the south side of the pass is eo much colder than the north' it is better not to halt here. ' On leaving these wadis the last ascent to Rahwat-al-Makana begins and is about 1^ miles long with an average slope of 4° This last rise is over hard rock but a good deal better than before, until it is within 150 yards of the top ; from there it goes along the side of a hill with one or two bad places where an animal could easily slip over the edge. The defile at the top of the pass is about 30 yards long and very narrow with steep sides so that a camel with at all a wide load would find it very difficult to get through. There is a second path rather higher up the hillside on the east of the road and this avoids the above defile, but it is a much more difficult path and should only be used if the defile is blocked, which can easily be done in a few minutes. The camels being too tired lo go further except at a pace which would have brought us to our proposed camp long after dark, we had to halt there, about 200 yards to the north of the pass. General direction north. Time taken from the foot of the ascent to the top, less halts, Sj hours. Return journey, 6 hours. Time taken from Shuqrah to the top of the pass, 10 hours. Return journey, 8 hours. Rahwat-al-.Makana is the name given to the top of the pas^ There are i.o people living anywheie near this. Water should always be carried from Shuqrah, as it is a tiring march and a party would probably be unable to reach the next water, which at the best is hard to reach and doubtful in quality and quantity. \ 12 m. There is a bit of bad road for the first i mile, but after 2 MIS-HAL (2,700') 28 m. that it enters the plain of Jahain, where it is good and level for a out miles. There is a small amount of cultivation on the plam of Jahain,»more especially towards the north end, but it floes not look very good. ttei I327 Route No. 90— contd. Then it turns slightly to the west leaving Haid Lamas on the right, and | mile further on at mile 7 the road branches to the'right hand, one going to Bir Lamas and the other to BIT Mis-hal. The latter continues level for another J mile and descends about 300 feet in IJ miles to the Wadi-an -Nakh'ain. This descent is spread over nearly the whole of the 1| miles and is nowhere very steep, but it is a bad road owing to the numbers of loose stones about. By following the wadi down, i.e., to the west, for half a mile one comes to the best place for a camping ground, from which a track mns joining the mam xoad i mile short of Mis-hul. Wadi-an-Nakh'ain is a dry river bed running from east to west along the south edge of the Isakh am plain. There are a few crops along the south bank and more to wards BTr Lamas, but being a badly watered district they are not good. There is a line of trees along both banks, ihe best place for camping is about 4 a mite to the west of the road, that being as near as possible to the water. To the west of this the ground is hard rock and limestone. There are small patches of cultivation scattered about the plain to the north of the wadi. Supplies nil, except a few g ats._ There is good grazing for camels along the banks oi the wadi. The water at Bir Nahk'ain consists of 2 or 3 rain pools and one spring in the bed of the wadi, about 2 miles to the west of the road. The way to it along the bed of the wadi has been block ed by a landslip, so that access to it is very difficult and a guide is necessary. The path is along the north bank of the river and then descends by a steep and stony track to the bed. 1 he water in the rain pools is very bad, being con tun ally fouled by camels, so that horses will not drink it. The spring is suffi ciently high up to prevent animals getting at its, and is * air y good but inclined to give Europeans dysentery; however, Arabs prefer it to Bir Mis-hal and Bir Lamr s. There is a ram pool at Suq- an-Nakh'ain 3- miles north-east of the point where the road crosses the wadi, but the water Is probably indifferent. Time Uken to Bir NakVaio 4^ hours.

The path runs along the ridge of this eminence, the which is the watershed between the wddis Surum and Khalla Little cultivation after leaving Sauma'ah, but large tracts of dry grass occur, affording excellent fodder and sprouting fresh after rain. The track to the ' Aqabah is good, but the Aqabah is impassable for heavily laden camels and many caravans su - stitute donkeys for the journey to Nisab. At mile 7 the track turns east for a mile and leads by a most abrupt descent into Wadi Khalla with rough and stony bed, the banks wooded with mimosa and nlub trees and steep hills rising on either hand. A short distance further on Wadi Khalla falls into Wadi Surum by a precipitous gorge on the right bank. From mile 8, the track follows Wadi Khalla, here called Wadi Khaura, in a north-north-east direction. A chain of pools of good water is reached at 16 miles.

At about 4 miles 105 m. from the pools, the Wadi Tirimid flows down a precipitous gorge on the left bank of the Khaura, and contains an inexhaustible supply of water in a series of broad deep pools, some of which are 10 feet deep. Near this spot, thick clumps of tamarisk pccur. At 2 miles below the junction, the wadi opens out to a width of f mile, between two mountain ranges. A mountain spur abuts on the wadi called Al-Mukriba which saves foot pas sengers a detour. Thick jungle is encountered which does not obstruct the path, here running over light sand. Half a mile from Mukriba, shallow pools occur which require care to avoid fouling. It might be necessary to break the stage here. Fur ther on the valley gradually broadens out from a gorge and the black, weathered heights of granite on either side give place to wall-like banks of loam. On the right bank mimosa is replaced by tamarisk, and the left bank is formed by a high earth cliff. Here the path leaves the wddi through an awkward, narrow cleft between jpw rocks, and passing some Himyaritic ruins on a hillslope to the left, the path swings away from the wadi on to the plain of Khaura, a name applied to the village of 'Ali-bin-Alwai. the 'Aqil, and to the strip of country extending to Hauta.

This latter emerges from the hills ^ of a mile beyond the branch ; the other winds along a small valley for f of a mile before leaving the hills. The whole distance through these hills is about 2^ miles or 2 miles by the shorter road to Laudar. Following the former after leaving the hills the road crosses the Ardh Ahl Said in a north- north-west direction towards the isolated ridge, Haid Mahrab, 5 miles distant and just before reaching which it turns north-east and keeps in this direction all the way to Al-Jauf. The road across this plain is over hard sand an J is perfectly level until within a mile of Al-Jauf, when it descends slightly to the village. The whole plain is covered with scrub, thick' in most places but only enough to stop one's view. The other road to Laudar is the same kind and good, but goes straight toward.', Al-Jauf with a bearing of 16°.

Epitome, General Description. —This is the central route to Nisab across the Kaur. It is difficult and is only used by caravans whern the tribes on the eastern and western routes are restless. Hdl camels lightly loaded or donkeys should be taken. Along this route there are only small hill tribes. Mr. Bury traversed it in the opposite direction with a small party and only 3 hill bag gage camels, a riding camel and pony, and a small merchant donkev train.

Stage 3 might perhaps be shortened by increasing the length of stage 2 by push ing on further up the Hagnun gorge, and probably it would be advisable to make 4 stages of stages 4 and 5.

The village of Al-Husn can be seen to the west soon after leaving Dirjaj. From the bend in the Wadi Hasan water is brought off by water channels branching in every direction. The sources belong to the Yafai and their management is in the h '.nds of the Satyids of Al-MMna. Instead of going to the corner near Al-Mmna where the wadi turns south after running through the hills from the north-east, the track crosses a narrow pass called Tanq-al- Kaha, going round J. Oherash. The pass is a steep one, especially near the top ; the path turns east and zig-zags up over slabs of shale. The head of the pass is commanded on the north side by a spur about 50 feet high. The approaches to the top of the pass are quite open and there is no cover. The pass then leads through Wadi Goddam to Wadi Hasan. The Tanq -al-Kaaa is used by the Fadhli to avoid trouble with the Yafai. The best route would seem to be along the river bank.

At mile 4, the track bends sharply north following the direction to the wddi. At this point the Wadi Riah comes in on the left bank just below Jabal Riah. At mile 6, the valley opens out into a wide amphi theatre surrounded by hills 500—5,000 feet high. Here the Wadi Reban is joined on its left bank by the Wadi Ghiuda and on its right bank by the Wadi Silib. Above the junction with the Wadi Silib is the commanding peak of Jabal Shaas. This large amphitheatre was once well populated and there are no less than 4 old villages called Shariah.

The track leads north across cultivation for 2 miles, then across waste ground for another 2 miles, after which it passes through low hills until at mile 6| it reaches Al Husn. This village is in Yafai territory and is situated in a level grazing plain at the foot of these low hills. The Wadi Bana is 2 miles distant to the west. The country is very fertile ; 4 pakha and 50 kacha houses. There are two wells which yield a fairly good supply of water. Forage is plentiful and ordinary provi sions of the country are obtainable. Thence it is 4 miles due •north over open ground to Misana. {See Route No. 99, stage 4.) Misana is a Saiyid village on the right bank of the Wadi I?ana situated immediately under a range of hills called Jabal- adh-Dhala. It is surrounded by cultivation and consists of 15 pakkct and 25 kacha houses. The Sayids of this village control the Nazia canal. Water. —'From the Bana Wadi close by.

The road runs north • over a sandy plain 26 m. to BIr Jabir, a collec tion of huts where four roads meet. There are two wells with a good and plentiful supply of water ; a little milk and a few fowls and sheep are procurable. The road now turns towards the north-east as far as BIr Awadain. The road so far is fairly good, mostly over hard ground through thick clumps of furze bushes, but here and there sand hills have to be crossed. At Bir Awadain there is one well of indifferent water. No supplies. 3 HARUR 10 m. The road now runs — north across the desert, 36 m. the going not being good owing to heavy sand drifts. Near the bank of the Wadi Suhaibiyah firm soil is reached. Several branches of this wddi are crossed before reaching Harur, a village of about 50 houses situated at the base of the hills where there is a good deal of cultivation and plenty of flood water from the wddis around. There are three wells of good and plentiful water. Rice, jowdri, dates and karbi can be had in plenty. 4 MIS AN A .. 10 m. The road runs north- east; very good going 46 m. over a gravel soil with acacia trees scattered along the track. It crosses several wddis, tributaries of the Wadi Bana. The road now approaches the hills and runs for a couple of miles along the foot of the low range at the e st end of which lies Misana, on the right bank of the Wadi Bana. There is a good alternative route which leaves this track at about m. 3, from Harur towards the north-east, and after cross ing the Wadi Bana reaches Al-Husn, m. 8, whence it turns north to Misana m. 3; total 11 miles. Misana is situated on a level grassy plain at the fcot of the hills, surrounded by very fertile country which presents the appearance of being periodically flooded.

About h mile further on. several towers are met with crowninsr the lower features of the hills on both sides of the stream up which the road leads, the locality being known as Am-Misdara. A few hundred yards farther the ascent of the Maskabah Pass commences. A road leads in easy gradients zigzaginc up to the crest, and at one time must have been in good order being held up by a retaining wall and paved with large slabs of stone. It is in utter disrepair now. The paving stones are tilted up at all angles and it is very trying even for unladen transport ani mals. Horses must be led up or down, and their legs suffer from the edges of the stones that stand up at all angles through out its length. The crest of the pass is about 2,000 feet above* the towers at the bottom at Am-Misdara. On the northern side the slopes is gentle and the road comparatively good for about J mile, when it becomes very easy all the way into Sarar, about m. 8. Here there is scanty room for a large camp in some fields and a river bed ; water from the well is not good. The camping ground is commanded by towers perched on the hill side. Sheep can be obtained and a few fowls, with a little Icarbi only ; but no supplies on a large scale. From Sarar a road leads westwards into the Wadi Bana and' another eastwards into the Yeramis valley, following the course of the Wadi Sarar. The road follows the Wadi Sarar and at m. turns up the Wadi Am-Haddara, a stream that joins the Wadi Sarar at this point. The road is- good throughout. It now follows the Wadi Am-Haddara, crossing it frequently the crossings are bad, the ground being boggy as the limit of permanent satura tion is reached. Strips of wheat cultivation fringe the track, on both banks of the stream. Occasionally the track crosses- low spurs of the hills, but no difficulty is met with, the road, b-ing practicable for laden camels. As the Wadi Am Hadda- ra is ascended, towers are seen perched on the hillsides, and Al- Qarah itself is visible long before it is reached. Just before- reaching this place the road passes over a low spur, and about a mile farther the head of one of the branches of the Wadi Am- Haddara is reached. The ground and the hillside are terraced for cultivation, and there is ample space at the foot of the hill on which Al-Qarah is situated and which rises about 800' above the valley below. There are several trees in this part of the-368 Route No. 99— concld. Country. The height of Al-Qarah hill la 6,631 feet above-sea level and that of the valley at its foot about 5,800 feet.

It now enters cultivation and leaving Dar-ad-Daulah on the west, proceeds to Mijbah. Here supplies of jowari and karbi are obtainable, and also in the neighbouring villages of As-Suq, An-Nimara, and Dar-ad-Daulah. There are wells here and also in these villages. There is a good deal of cultivated land irrigated by flood water of the wddis around. There is tamarisk jungle in the river bed, and acacia trees on the waste ground between the cultivation and the foot of the hills to the north and north-west. The road branches here and either of the following ways may be taken;— (i) up the Milah stream, which makes an indifferent road to Jimil, or (ii), leaving the Milah stream at mile 3, from Mijbah and passing Dar Shaiban (Sihban) (one well of sweet and abundant water; also abundant forage and supplies) and Saifar, goes across an open plain and at Al-Hajah joins the Wadi Am Suhaibiyah again.

Path continues near- ly due north through 20 m cultivated ground, On this and the 3rd stage effortswere made to improve the heavy sandy parts by laying down karbi and reeds from the river bed. The latter were best, as the karhi breaks up very easily. At m. U the stony bed of the Wadi-as -Saghir is crossed; the banks have been well ramped and the crossing is easy.

Camp on the opposite (left) bank in a clear space among mimosa jungle. There is an old well in the bed of tho wddi a short way below the village and a little above the old well is the large new well dug in 1903, which affords good and ample water-supply. The site of the post established in 1903 is a low rocky hill, 500 yards north-east of the camp, and above the right bank of the Wadi-al-Juma which drains to the Wadi Am Suhaibiyah. Water holes dug in the bed of the Wadi-al- Juma afford plentiful water, only about 8 feet below the surface.

To the east is the village of As-Sulek, and the site of the post established in 1903. The path runs good and level across the stony Habilain plateau till at m. 10 it descends rather steeply into the bed of the Wadi Hardaba. Then winds easily up the stony bed until the springs of Ghail Hardaba are reached at m. 12. Camping space a good deal restricted, as the water course is enclosed between rocky hills.

At m. 4 is Al-Kafla, or Tafwa, and a custom post (Mijba) of the Amir of Ad-Dhali' (Dhala) and at m. 4| up a valley to the left is the village of Al-Hamra. Two wells, but scanty supply of water. Continuing up the Hardaba water course, which is here more open and less winding, the village Ar-Radu a (Ar-Rado) is reached at m. 7J (half a mile above it on a rocky hill on the left bank is the site of the post established in 1903). Here is a small camping ground and 2 wells to the north of the village. Route No. 108 crosses here. From here a track runs north-north-west, a good road to the foot of the Ar-Rabadh (Rabad) pass, which is about 800'high, the going in the pass, being bad in places. If camels are lightly loaded and working parties left in the bad places here is no diffi culty. Thence through Zubaid (Zubed) to Dhali '(Dhala). From Ar-Radu'a (Ar-Rado), the path which leads to the Naqil- al-Khuraibah (Khureba) continues up the main wadi Hardaba passing the site of the military post. The path is quite good up the broad shingly bed between rocky hills. At m. 9| AI- Markula is passed, east of the route. At m. 10} Ad-Dimma on a hill to the west. Above this the valley narrows to a gorge between high rocky precipices. At m. 12, is Al-Khuraibah (Khureba), the tower of the Shaikh of the Al-Beshi clan of the Nhairi, on a rocky spur commanding the route. The path is still quite easy. There is a small spring in a ravine to the right a little above Al-Khuraibah ; foragfe and a few goats and cows are obtainable. (A very steep footpath here branches west up to Al-Jarba.)

The ascent in the first | mile is about 600' and is rather severe. After that it is much easier, and there are traces of an old paved road. In 1905 the road was improved. The track is in fair condition the whole way and is passable for camel transport. A camel takes about | hour to get from the bottom to the top. At the head of the pass the road emerges into a cultivated plain in view of Jabal Shahad, about 1 mile distant, the town of Dhali' being 2| miles to the S. W. There is a well of excellent water here. There are also several wells on the way up from Al-Khuraibah with water sufficient ior 1 battalion with transport. There are two paths from Al- Khuraibah by which the pass may be turned ; one is a steep winding footpath ascending the west side of the gorge to Al-Jarba, whence easy footpaths branch to all parts of the plateau. The other, also a steep winding footpath, ascends the cast side and at the top joins a good easy path which, coming from Dakar on the south leads north to Al-'llshari and Al-Kuram (Al-Kuren). _ ^ ■ a About m. 2 from the top of the pass Route ^o. 106 is crossed and about m. 2-|, Route No. 107. The track passes through Al- .[alila, about m. 3, from the top of the pass, where there are 5 wells with a plentiful supply of good water. Here forage and ordinary provisions are fairly abundant. Thence the path runs between hills and through cultivation past the Sham villages of Lakmat Al-Hajifar, Jalas and Al-Wabeh. (An alternative path almost equally good goes from Al-Jahla, passes west of Jabal-as- Sauda, and cuts in again near Jalas.) Between Jalas (on west of road) and Al-Wabeh (on east) the road descends into an open cultivated valley about H miles wide opening cut towards the east. Thence it ascends slightly over a low ridge, passing under the steep rocky spurs of Jabal Jihaf on the west, and descends again into a wide cultivated valley, through the middle of which it runs for about 2 miles through crops, and then for one mile over a rockv undulating plain past Sanah (on west) m 11.

Twenty-two wells of good water, the yield beifig unlimited. Grain and fodder in large : quantities. Alternative to stage 2 ; 21 miles. From Dar-al-Amir, the road leads north-west through open sandy country. The going is good, with here and there a few heavy places. At m. 9 Bir Mahait is passed. At m. 13 is Ad-Darb, a small but thriving village near the Wadi Kabir, with a mud fort and 2 wells. The water is good but limited unless the river is down, or irrigation by means of canals going on. Forage and the commoner sorts of provision are plentiful. Thence the aspect of the country changes, the desert giving place to cultivation. At first the track runs across open country, passing As-Sharj at m. 13J (2 wells, water good but not abundant). At m. 14| isWaht, a large village on the Wadi Kabir.

At m. 5} another track joins on the east from the Babub pass. At m. 6| is Kaflat Zabaid (Zobed) on the far side of an open cultivated' valley. Three wells, of which the best one is west of the village. Here tracks join from 'the east; one from the Ath-Thauba pass, the other from the Ar-Rabadh pass. There is a good well, Bir Shabanu, near the village. Hence two paths lead to Dhali'. The one to the west of Kaflat Zubaid passes between that village and Al-Marsaba, up a narrow cultivated valley, Wadi Diak, well wooded with ulub trees. At m. 7| is a steep rocky ascent of 200 feet, after which the path is nearly level, past the village of Habil Di Ishar to Dhali. The other path from Zubaid passes east of Kaflat Zubaid, and w'-'st of Laghwal, winds among rocky hills, quite good and easy. At m. 7 ascends, rather steeply, to cross a col, whence it descends easily skirting the foot of the steep hill east of Dhali town, till it enters Dhali' from the east. The latter path is the more direct for troops camped north of Dhali town. The stage is practicable for laden camels, mules and horses, but the roughness of the first half makes progress slow. The path is commanded by hills on each side throughout. The shrine of Wali Hasan is visible throughout, and would be useful for sig nalling communications. At Dhali is the residence of the Amir V on the top of a rocky hill. The town clusters at the northern foot of this hill and partly up its slopes. On the western side of the town is an open space where the weekly market is held on Thursdays. The ground right up to the town is terraced for cultivation. Population about 2,400. Six wells of good water; supply unlimited. Forage and ordinary provisions and supplies of every kind plentiful. 7 QA 'TABAH .. 1 l|m.

Thence skirting the foot of Jabal Jihaf passes Sh'ab-al-As'ud, and Bajaha and goes down the Wadi Haza. Here the track bifurcates, the northern branch going through Sanah at m. 8|, and the western to the Tiban valley. Sanah is the boundary village before crossing into Turkish territory.

The path leaves the main watercourses, here known as the Wadi-ar- Rahaba, and goes north-west up the Wadi Hirat, commencing the ascent of the Naqil Mashwara, the gradient is easy at first though the going is rough, and it gradually becomes steeper. At m. 41 the path turns to the right and ascends about 500 feet by a steep rough zigzag to the top of a spur, then turns west to round the head of a ravine (Sh'ab Shahag), and ascends gradually skirting the side of Jabal Mashwara for a mile and a half. The top of the pass is reached at m. 1\ ;_the total ascent from Al-Ghail being about 1,200 feet. The descent north into the Azraki valley is rocky and in parts steep, but the height is considerably less than on the south side of the pass.

The residence of the Sultan of the Haushabi. One well of indifferent water. Forage pro curable. From Mus'aimir (Musemir) the path winds up the cultivated valley of the Wadi Tiban. The valley is 200 to 300 yards wide between steep banks, 100 to 200 feet high. The stream is insi .nificant in the dry season, parts of the river bed are quite dry at times, the water being led off for irrigation. At m. 10^, just above the village of Bashiriya the valley narrows to a rocky gorge, and the stream was dammed, so that one had to wade for a short distance through 2 feet of water. Above the gorge the dry Wadi Makhran joins the Tiban valley from the east. A route fit for camels branches up it and over a difficult pass, to Masnah on the Mashwara route. Continuing up the Tiban, Lijmah is reached at m. 12 in a wide cultivated part of the valley. Good camping ground on the fields ; forage, fuel, and grain procurable with due notice.

From Zubaid two passes lead down to Ar-Rado:— ii) Ar-Rabadh (Rabad) pass. A pood path from Zubaid r'sfes easily through cultivation to the head of the pass at mile 3. The descent is 780 feet in about a mile, the path winding down steep rocky slopes. The gradient is generally easy, but there are one or two steep zigzags for a short distance. Practicable for laden camels. At mile 4J the path enters the bed of the Wadi Rabodh and then winds up over a spur and down again into a nullah. Here is a caravan halting place in a narrow gorge and a spring. At mile 8 Ar-Rado is reached in the Hardaba valley. See Route No. 102, stage 6. This was the pass used for the regular passage of troops and convoys between Aden and Dhali in 1902 and 1901, and the path was considerably improved. An'alternative path leads from Dhali' to the Ar-Rr.badh pass through Laghwal, a village -J mile east of Zubaid, and near the Hakl ravine.

Leaving the Tiban nearly opposite the village of Tawarasa and proceeding west up the dry bed of the Tusan, at mile 3|- what appears to be a large wddi comes in from the, north, but it resolves itself into a flat cultivated area with several short ravines running into it. A good deal of cultivation is then passed. The track is good, and well worn by the traffic, which is considerable. At mile 4J the Wadi Mukhailan comes in from the north. The junction de fines the border netween the Ahmadi and Amara tribes, the latter being under the Turks. The small village of Amara lies in the junction between the wddis. The locality is called Tusan. Crossing the Turkish boundary here, the path follows the wddi westward, passing the Humar villages of Hudan and Shan'ab on the south bank, and Salul and Ad-Dhar on the north bank. About mile 8 the track leaves the wudi, which here turns north-west, and continues west over open fertile country along the northern slopes of Jabal Am Amma (7,300 feet). The 'villages of Al-Mirad and Al-Mojah are passed about mile 11, and Ad-Dira about mile 14. Here the path turns south-west and rises to the village of Mnwiyah, which consists of some 30 Arab houses and occupies a position commanding the surround ing country.

Warazan is ascended to mile when track turns up dry Wadi Nashim on the left bank to about mile 8, where it leaves the left bank of this ravine. Hence on, track continues west-north-west crossing some ten ravines. None of these are difficult, but the continual ascent from, and descent into, ravines renders this a very trying march for baggage camels. Some shallow water-holes are passed in the Wadi Juah at mile 9. The Wadi N'aman is crossed about mile lOf before reaching hamlet of Daraijah (Addareja). Daraijah (Addereja), two groups of small towers and huts on low hills on either side of the track is reached at about mile 111. From the village, the track descends north-west, past a graveyard, to the Wadi-al-Milah— perennial stream flowing at intervals—at mile 12. Some culti vation on the banks. The bed is ascended to mile 14, passing a small hamlet (Al- Mizada) on the left, and two others (As Sarwa and Ar-Rafad) on the right, till at mile 14J the wddi bifurcates, the branch to the right being called the Wadi Karkahan and that to the left the Sh'ab Lasb. A small stream in the Karkaham is the usual halt ing place for caravans. The noticeable needle-like point of J. Jalisa serves as a general direction point for most of the way. Camping ground, either on the plateau between the Wadi Ziyak to the south-west and the Karkahan, near the site of the ruined tower of Muhammad-Xasir Mukbil (Commission Camp, 1904) or on upland between Karkahan and Rada ravine (a further bifurcation to the north-east). Ample space. Good perennial streams in the Zij^ak and Rada and a smaller one in the Karkahan, giving abundant water except in dry season (March to May), when the supply is less, but reported never to fail.

The wddi passes through cultivation and jungle to mile 1. Thence both banks are lined with a narrow belt of thick jungle about 20 high. At mile 4 is the Village of Waradiyah and at mile 5| Dar Maharam (1 well), at428 Eoute No. 113— contd. both of which places the jungle gives place to cultivation. At mile 6Jis Kuhlan, or Dar-ud-Daiman. Camping ground north east of the village, and south of Jabal Kuhlan on a saddle between that hill and Jabal Sahabah. An abundant supply of good water is obtained from the Wadi Ma'din (called here Ghail Akashi), the stream being 4' wide, 6'deep and flowing at 3 miles per hour! Both banks are covered with cultivation and palm groves. Jowzri, millet and livestock are procurable. Karbi and wood plentiful. Tamarisk wood in profusion. The village of Khasaja is on the left bank. 5 MAFALIS .. 7 m. From here onwards the country is very m * fertile, with all kinds of grain and fruit in their seasons. There are cattle, sheep and goats in plenty. ^Numerous rills and. rivulets, some of them perennial, flow along artificial channels and down the rocks. The track is commanded from the mountains on either side. From J. Kuhlan, the Wadi Ma'din takes a westward bend to about mile f. The track follows the river bed. Head of Ghail Akashi reached about here, the nullah being somewhat marshy at this point and much overgr wn with tamarisk. Right bank 20 feet high and abrupt. Cultivation and date-palms on both banks. Several small Jurabi (Subaihi) villages passed on left bank. Sh ab Moharrak, a small nullah, joins on right bank and the wldi turns north, passing the Dubaini village of Tafih (30 houses) at mile 1^ on left bank. A little farther, the low h II Gharaka is passed on left bank with a group of Masfari and Atawi 'v illages. At mile 2, Wadi Ma 'bak, a broad sandy wadi with high banks, and much tamarisk, joins from the west. There is a shal low well in the wadi at this point. Right bank continues high and much v ooded. Small village of Hajairi | mile distant on spur of J. Raishash. A little farther up, the ravine Gharaka joins left bank and another small village is passed. At mile 2J Ghorik, a \ illage in two parts, of some 30 houses ancT towers, is passed oil right bank. Well in nullah. A weekly market is held here. Half mile to the west is the shrine of Sanawi with village and well. Almost opposite, the small Wadi Hajur joins and another shallow Avell is passed. At mile 3 j a group of small Jurabi villages of one 0 r two towers apiece on small conical hills is passed on either bank among groves of date-palms and irrigated fields. The right bank429 Route No. 113— could. becomes less abrupt. The cultivated Wiidi Sh'ab branchea at right angles to the left bank behind a palm grove. At mile 4, high hills close in on either side, still, however, leaving a strip of cultivation, and at mile 4 J, the stream Ghail Maula again ap pears in the wddi, being led off to the fields below this. A small hamlet—Hajat Ma'fa—is on the right bank. Up to this point general direction north-west, hence on, north. For another | mile, to mile 5, there is a defile narrowing to 80 yards between high steep hills ; a strip of high reeds and tamarisk on either «de. The small villages of Humara and Sharj Atai are passed on the right and left banks respectively. At about mile 5| the ravine, Sh'ab Tashiya, joins the right bank almost opposite a watch-tower formerly built by the Sultan of Lahaj. At mile 6 Maula, a village of 20 houses, inhabited by Sayids, is passed on the right bank and opposite is the small village of Auja. Here the Turkish boundary is crossed. From this point the valley opens out, containing cultivation and palm-groves. Several fair-sized Athwari and Shajaifi villages (Turkish), notably Anashi, are passed on the left bank below the high hill of Husn Mafalis. Mafalis itself is reached at about mile 7 on the right bank. A village of same 20 houses with the white ddr of the Athwari Shaikh conspicuous above it. The customs post is a small ddr in the vicinity. There are no regular troops normally. Ghail Dabab, which rises above, furnishes Mafalis with a plentiful supply of good water. The surrounding country is cultivated and the fertile hills to the north must provide abun dant supplies. Some 600 transport camels were stationed for nearly two months in the Wadi Ma'din; no difficulty was experienced in supplying them with karbi, while the camel-men and others dependent on native supplies were able to obtain all they required at very reasonable rates. Baggage camels are owned by the Jurabi as also by the Wahasha tribes, lower down the wddi, but they are not numerous. 6 HIRWA .. 13 m. The track runs north- west up the Wadi 73|m. Ma'din, passing As- Sarifi about mile 3 where the wadi turns west. At about mile 5 the wadi bifurcates, one branch turning north to the Naqil431 Route No. 113— cone W. J. Kubati, is crossed. A narrower cultivated valley is then entered, several small villages lying on either hand, and a well, Biraa, reported good, is passed in a palm grove to south of tho track at mile 4. The cultivated valley of Wadi Majusha with low wills on either side is traversed. At some points, cactus and scrub grow fairly thickly. The village of Salim is passed on the left, on a hill of that name, soon after mile 5, and another village Salim inhabited by Saiyids, with the shrine 'Umar Ibrahim on the right at mile 5J. J. Shokan lies about a mile to the notrh. At mile 6, Wadi Nifakha, a sandy nullah thickly wooded with tamarisk jungle, is crossed. The tamarisk con tinues thick into the next small valley from v hioh a shallow defile leads gradually up a stony, cactus-covered upland slop es down to the Wadi Ma'din, which is reached at mile 7. The small hill J. Kuhlan closes this upland, which is an excellent site for a camp, to the north. A track from D.ir Farshah branches northwards from near the widi of 'Umar Ibrahim before Kuhlan is reached. It passes just to the east of the village of Tafih, mostly over un dulating, uncultivated ground between the hills of Turra and Furi to Wadi Sh ab, which it crosses. Thence an ascent of f mile over a somewhat stony pass between the high hills of Kawa on left and Nabat on right, and a descent of the same distance. It joins the Wadi Ma'din in Turkish territory near the village of Anashi. This track is used by caravans to avoid passing the Humaidi tower Dar 'Abd Muhammad. The path is stony and in need of improvement, but offers no serious difficulty to trans port. It is far more direct as a road from Dar Farshah to Mafalis than the winding bed of the Wadi Ma'din, but there is no suitable halting place with water or supplies on the road. The road can be joined from Kuhlan itself near Tafih. The pass between Kawa and Nabat is called the Najd Rifad and the track takes its name from this. In case of hostilities this would be a better route than the Wadi Ma'din. There vould be no difficulty were the two hills Kawa and Nabat held. These heights are commanded, though not at close range, by the mountains on the opposite (right) bank of the Mi'din.432 ROUTE No. 114.

From the well, an easy ascent, up a fair but stony track, leads after J mile to the top of the Madraja pass at mile 3. The track at summit is in a cutting with hills rising steeply on either hand. Just after descent com mences, a good paved road is met, which winds rather steeply down south slope on side of spur in re-entrant ravine. The road-way made some years ago by the Sultan of Lahaj, is in good repair, from 3 to 6 yards broad and solidly banked mud with stones.

At present only pack animals such as hill camels and mules could be used. It was in this way that the Turks brought up their field artillery, remounting it in Sana'a. The road is not metalled and the surface varies according to the country. The sandy parts would be very heavy in wet weather. It is generally about 18 feet wide. The whole road between Hajailah and Sana'a is carefully guarded. At 10-mile intervals there are posts of 50-—200 men under an officer in strongly situated guard-houses. These are usually old Arab towers, repaired and adapted, the larger ones being connected by telegraph with each other and with Hodeida and Sana'a. Between the guard-houses there are sentry posts of 2 or 3 men; with each post is a trumpeter and they signal to each other with a code of calls. There does not seem to be any system of flag signalling. The country between Hajailah and Jabal Assir, which bounds the Sana'a plateau on the west, is extremly mountainous, wild and difficult. There are many strong points where a force advancing from Hodedia on Sana'a could be opposed. Any numbers of Arab irregulars could probably bs recruited at small pay by an invading power for employment against the Turks, and would prove valuable as they are tine mountaineers, often good fighters, and thoroughly detest the Turks. Water is plentiful all along the route, but is slightly salt in the first two stages. Fuel is obtainable except in Sana'a, where it is very scarce. Fodder is probably obtainable everywhere. Supplies of kinds usually met in villages seem to be plen tiful but the only large places en route are Hodeida, Manakhah, (stage 7), and Sana'a. No. of stage and total distance. ' ' HODEIDA . .

During stages 3 and 4 the road becomes very winding, with steep zigzags and often a bad surface. The descent from Manakhah ridge is very difficult; the road has been neglected, and wash-outs have made it dangerous. Between Bo'an and Sana'a the road is fit for a motor car. Water. —The water at Hodeida, which is brought in from Hali, stage 1, is brackish but drinkable, and not injurious, A less brackish'supply comes from Mahassin, 11 miles south-south east of the town. En route it is good and abundant throughout, except at Tannan (nearly half -way along stage 1), where it is impregnated with nitrates but is harmless. In winter the supply is often inadequate at Hajailah. Fuel and Fodder. —-Good and abundant, the former being especially plentiful in the Kharifi valley. Stalks of wheat, barley and dhurrah are obtainable almost everywhere. Good grazing for horses in the vicinity of mile 10, stage 3, and on the uplands at Sana'a.

At mile 5 the road passes through a belt of asala ; and after passing the wells of Zuwiyah (no village) at mile 7, enters a second belt of asala, which it leaves at mile 10 through a thin timber belt of mimosa. At mile 12 the road winds through a belt of tall, thornless bush, following a watercourse, and through short scrub and sparse planta genista up a gentli riss to Taiinan at mile 15.477 Route No. 128 (b)—contd. The route leaves Beha amidst crops and, emerging from thin bush, passes a low range of hills which culminate in a peak known as Kubbah, an old shrine 1,000 yards to the left of the road at mile 3. From here the route, bearing generally east, enters a 'broad, level plain (good going) skirted by the Dam and Bura ranges on the right, between which flows the Siham, a big wddi that drains the far-distant hills of Bani Matar, and holds perennial water in its upper reaches. Along its valley is an alternative route to Sana'a for camels that cannot tackle the gradients of the Manakhah road. At mile 14, there are several villages and some crops wide of the road to the left. At mile 17, the route approaches within a mile of Sihan gorge, and then turns due east towards 'Obal, crossing at mile 19 the broad, steep, stony valley known as WaiiMadkhal (or Hadal); and at mile 21, Wadi 'Obal, a similar v&amp;lley. Both thess valleys have stony banks 200 feet high, up and down which zigzags a difficult route. In each case there is an alternative route for guns, which leads off to the left of the caravan track just before reaching each valley, and rejoins it on the other side. The road passes at mile 22, through 'Obal, a town of 1,000 inhabitants, with telegraph and post offices which are to be removed to Ha jail. After leaving r Obal the route turns north-e ast across two small ravines that drain down from the western slopes of Safan into the Sihan. Good going, through thin bush, the road being skirted close on the left by the foothills of Safan.

At mile 26 the route crosses deep, well-wooded ravine running down from Safan and passing through well cultivated land dotted with park-like timber. Ascends at mile 274- a low, stony, plateau on which stands Hajailah at mile 28. Hajailah is a town of 1,500 inhabitants. There is a small market for general supplies held once a week. Water-supply limited ; there is one well in a small ravine east of the town; supply often inadequate in the winter.

The brook is crossed at mile 18, and from here the track rises rapidly in steep zigzags (very bad surface) up on to the plateau of Hajrah at mile 21. Here the path debouches on to bare rock Commanded at extreme range from a position on Jabal Shibam to the right front, and still dominated by the heights of Masar on the left. Hajrah pass is surmounted at mile 21, with Hajrah village 600 yards to the left of the road on a commanding knoll. From this point Masar no longer dominates the route which descends uteeply south-east for 500 feet to mile 25, then curves round suc cessive spurs of Jabal Shibam ; the slopes of that system are close on the right, and its deep ravines and spans drop steeply away from the left of the road to join the mTain valley of Shabt. These ravines are spanned by well-made arches of dressed stone. At mile 26 the road comes under command of Forts Hadar and Baih, which show just above Manakhah to the front. At mile 27, occur troughs and springs for watering animals just to the left of, and below, the road. At mile 27^, a white-domed spring for human needs is passed on the left, while up the slopes to the right may be seen the ravine of Ma'agl whence the track of the subterranean water- supply to the hospital, arsenal, and mosque, may be traced round a contour of Manakhah spur by the line of green vege tation. On this spur, 200 feet above and to the right of the road, is a windmill tor grinding Government corn. Here too are the outskirts of the town, and the slaughter-ground, while im mediately to the left of the road are the Turkish cemetery and parade ground, the latter overlooked by the Staff Office and Hukumah. At mile 28, enter Manakhah up a slight ascent. The post and telegraph office are on the left, opposite the Hukumah, where the road curves round the northern edge of the town to top Manakhah spur. Manakhah stands on a spur of the Shibam system running down north-north-eash to the town, and rising again towards the two forts of Hadar and Bai. On the rise towards the glacis of Fort Baih stands the suburb of^Little Manakhah. The arsenal and barracks adjoin each other on the crest of the ridge surrounded by the town. The population of Manakhah is (about 5,000, of whom about 1,000 are Jews, Water is plentifu480 Eoute No. 128 {h)—contd. and good from springs in the vicinity. Supplies consist of barley, bearded wheat, and durrah, fresh vegetables grown locally, and fruit from Sana'a. Grain chaff and durrah stalks are used as fodder. An important market is held on Sundays. The Hulcumah is also headquarters for a company of Arab Gendarmerie. 4 SUQ-AL-KHAMIS 30 m. East of Manakhah ~ ridge the ground falls } 18m - away rapidly into a sea of kopjes and foothills beyond which rises the wall-like scarp of the main range ; over this passes the road to Sana'a. On the higher slope of this range, within sight of Manakhah on a clear day, stands Suq-al-Khamls. From Manakhah ridge the road, after circling round the town in a horse-shoe curve, winds down the east face of a spur of Shib- am which runs down from the main heights in a south-east direction. On the right are the well-nigh precipitous slopes of the spur and on the left an almost sheer descent to the ravine of Hegr into which the road descends 3,000 feet below Manakhah. The difficulty of this descent is much enhanced by the rough surface of the road, well traced, bridged and buttressed, but so neglected that torrents and wash-outs have rendered it dangerous to negotiate without dismounting. The descent takes 2 hours and the ascent 3 to 3|. .. r mi | e 4 i3 the steep zigzag down the face of Dhira salient Dluit of the above mentioned spur. • w 11 , ni l e 5 ' a s P rm g g ood water emerges from the rock to the right of the road, at mile 7 is a small coffee house, also to the right, and at mile 8 the road descends into the valley of Hegr. io track quarters the shingly bed of that wddi, which swings off s larply northwards and, still maintaining an easterly direction, crosses a tentacle of the main spur down into another widi. Ira versing this amid arable land the route crosses another low spur and down a long stony descent amid timber and good graz ing into a third wadi at mile 10. At this point, 800 yards off the road to the right is the Ottoman post of Bait-al-Mahdi on a small eminence, and just before reaching here there is a pool, or stone-lined tank, of questionable water close to the left of the road (the sides of the tank are too steep for animals to water and there is no trough). A noon-day bivouac may be formed in this locality; shade, good grazing and firewood.481 Route' No. 128 (6)— contd. At m. 11, he road passes through well-wooded country and up a stony, difficult rise on top of which is a shelter for travellers close to the right of the track. From here a descent is made into a hollow encircled by low hills, on one of which stands Idz post (upper and lower positions) to the left of the road and 300 fcet above it. At the foot of this hill to the right of the road is the coffee house and hamlet of Idz at m. 12, 5,000 above sea level. Idz hill is difficult of access save by a footpath that zigzags up from the direction of the settlement where there is a moderate supply of grain and fodder. Water is supplied from a white concrete-covered spring fitted with troughs for animals. Leaving Idz hollow up the rise of Xajd-ar-Rahi, the road enters more hilly country at m. 13, still running east, and at m. 14 passes the small post of Bait-ar-Rabh to the right of the track which half circles round the small hill on which the post stands. At m. 17 another of these white-domed springs is passed but this is dry. Past this point the road enters a narrow well-bushed gorge winding between 50 feet rock walls and emer ges at m. 17i. The road now turns north-east and ascends a long rise drop ping down to the caravanserai of Mafhaqa at m. 20 close on the left. High on the right, on the summit of a steep 500-fect kopje, stands the important fortress of Mafhaoa dominating a hill- enclosed amphitheatre round which the road winds, being com manded for some 2 miles at ranges varying between 500 and 1,000 yards. The position is enclosed within a perimeter wall with flanking towers. There are said to be ancient rock-hewn tanks for storing water, relics of Himyarite times and still effective. East of and below this position on an isolated col is the Hukumah and Telegraph Office. A small observation post (Gendarmerie) is perched on a hill 1,000 yards south of the fort. From here the road turns north-north-east, steeply winding up ever-increasing gradients among the foothills of the main range. ^ At m. 25 the route circles round a tall pinnacle on which stands a rough stone observation post 150 feet above and to the right of the road. This is manned by Gendarmerie, who shout down questions to passers-by and five if the replies are not prompt or satisfactory.482 Route No. VIS {h)~contd. After m. 25 the ascent becomes still steeper, past a small mosque and hamlet at the head of a precipitous coffee- clad goree on the right at m. 27. After m. 27 the^ gradients become easier up to Suq-al-Khamis at m. 30. Suq-al-Khamis is a small settlement surrounded by a peri- m ® ter ] w t 11 ' and 13 composed of a village of about 300 inhabitants a iurkish post, a Hukumah, and Post and Telegraph Offices A few small shops, no regular market.

At m. 5 is another slight descent, still winding round Jabal Minar, and then up a rise to the Salami pass at m. 7, the highest point of the Sana'a-Hodeida road, 9,350 feet above sea level. On the left, 100 feet above the road, is the watch tower of Bait- as- Salami ; south-south-west of this point, two miles oil on a salient ridge is the block-house of Minar which commands Suq- al-Khamis. Five miles away to the north rise the tall flat-topped scarps of Nabi Shaib [J. Hadkur, marked at 10,300 feet on Hunter's map (''),] said by local folk to be the highest mountain in Yemen. I estimate it at 11,000 foot from comparison with known heights within sight. Oa top is a Turkish post and signalling station which can communicate direct with Sana 1 a or Manakhah in clear weather. From the Salami pass the road descends, still in a general north-east direction over a surface that gets worse and worse until Bo'an is reached at m. 11 (8,900 feet). Bo'an is a collection of small, empty, stone huts used as shops )!t market day (Thursday) ; there is also a coffee house and a caravanserai for travellers. It lies in a valley of the same name on the right bank of a running brook known as Asfarah, flow ing down in a general easterly direction from the hills just traversed. Bo'an bridge, of well-pointed masonry, spans this brook, and from this point vehicular traffic is possible to Sana'a. High on tho right of the road on a hill south of the village and about 500 feet above it stands Bo'an caracol, a defensible sarai commanding the road in both directions. Leaving Bo'an the route runs north-east over an excellent road, a continuation of which has already been traced west wards up the Bo'an valley. It yet lacks a surface and is pre. sumably the work of French engineers as an alternative route over the main ridge to Suq-al-Khamis. Further work on it has been abandoned. The road from Bo'an to Sana'a might be traversed by an automobile and shows care and attention, being well drained and its surface kept in good repair. It winds considerably as it has to traverse the far-flung spurs that run down from Nabi Shaib and here form steep and broken ground on the left, and on the right lies a very uneven plateau of barren stony ground through which various ravines from Nabi Shaib have cut their way; in such valleys thert is a certain amount of cultivation.485 Route No. 128 (h)—contd. From this point there is a descent of about 1,000 feet in a series of curves and zigzags (fairly easy gradients and good surface on to the Sana 'a plain at m. 30). At m. 31 is a ruined summer villa, gardens and tank (fresh water supply) to the left of the road, often used as a rendezvous for caravans entering and leaving Sana'a. From here the road runs east straight across the plain and enters Sanaa at m. 33 through the Bab-al-Ka'a, sometimes called the Bab-al-Yahud (Gate of the Jews). Sana a is a town of some 20,000 inhabitants, of whom about 8,000 are Jews. There is a small Levantine community of Christian Ottoman subjects and one Italian-born subject, a merchant of long-standing, who has just left for Europe (Nov ember 1913) and may not be returning. The Arab population is of the Zaidi sect. Sana'a is situated afc an altitude of 7,200 feet on a broad open plain lying north and south and bouilded by hills east and west. The ground is perfectly level and there is not sufficient surface drainage to justify the term ' valley ' but there must be much subterranean water percolating southwards beneath this place to judge by the numerous and widely scattered wells. The city's greatest length is 2 miles from east to west. Its breadth from north to south does not exceed a mile (I know that my estimate of the population and extent of this city is considerably less than is usually supposed). There are three distinct quarters com mencing from the west. First the Ka'a or Jewish quarter, with fairly wide main streets and houses of moderate height (average two storeys); next, Bir-al-Azab, the official quarter largely com posed of Turkish private houses in their own walled gardens. Here are the Government schools, the Wali's residence, the Staff Office and the quarters of most officers of rank. This quarter narrows to a mere neck towards the town of Sana 'a, which former Arab rule has enclosed within a 4:0-feet mud and stone wall flanked by frequent towers. (The Turks have thrown an inadequate mud wall round the other two quarters.) At this point a fine gateway of well-dressed masonry gives entrance to the town and there is also a gate on each side of the ' neck ' facing north and south. All three are known as Bab- al-Saba. The centre gate is surmounted and flanked by sub stantial quarters for Ottoman infantry, of whom there is a body here on permanent guard, as well as city police. From here486 Route No. 128 {h)~-contd. routine and executive bugle calls are sounded. The gateway bears the mark of cannon shot fired from Bir-al-Azab when the city was re- taken by the Turks under Ahmad Faizi Pasha in 1905 Within this gateway 100 yards to the north is the entrance'to the Military Hospital, a fine building fronting a large enclosed squat ■. A permanent guard prevents unauthorized entrance Much closer to the central gate, in the same direction,' stands tno vlunioipal Pharmacy, recognisable by its small front garden of shady trees. Here is a good store of druss dressings and requisites, but the pharmacist in charge— as is also the case at Hodeida Municipal Pharmacy—is only half trained and should be checked while dispensing. Prescriptions must be in French (metric system). Latin is unknown. Following the main artery of traffic further eastward into the town the road is cut by a broad dry nullah. Vehicular traffic must here turn to the left down the nullah and thence circle round the northern outskirts of the town, for the centrai portion is not practicable to wheeled traffic, being a congested area of narrow winding ways amid tall stone houses of mediae val Arab architecture (6—8 storeys). There is also a feasible road for wheels up the nullah to the right as far as Bab-ar-Rumi. Opposite a well-built mosque, a substantial bridge for foot pas sengers spans this road, indicating that the nullah is impassable after heavy rams. Just inside Bab-ar-Rumi is the Moslem meat market and urther m northwards from the gate are the bazars for fruit, vegetables, fabric, provisions and hardware. There are a few well stocked hurope ' shops. In this quarter is a street of casinos, alleged cafes much patronized by Turkish officers where arrack, mastic and occasional cognac may be procured by habitues. r The Hukumah is towards the east end of the city, facing a broad square where ceremonial parades are held. The Post and Telegraph Office is also in this locality. Still further east is a fine mosque dome and minaret) well attended by Turks, and imme la &lt; \ jej ond this is the citadel in a salient angle of the perimeter wall on a spur of Mount Nukum. Sana a is the centre of the Civil Government of Yemen and headquarters of the 14th Army Corps; a city of historic memo- nes an re\ere( by its Arab population while detested by the Turks as a house ot bondage.487 R oute N o . 128 {h)~nonclcL Supplies. —Plentiful. Fruit and vegetables of varied kinds in abundance. The market gardens of Bir-al-Azab supply the bulk of the vegetables which are consumed mostly by the Turks. Raudhah district supplies large consignments of purple and white grapes daily from June to November. Walnuts and peaches from J. Haddah. Meat plentiful but badly butchered ; the Jew butchers are far more expert than the Moslems, and cleaner, as are also their bakers. European bread not obtainable except from Military bakeries. Fodder. —Wheat and barley (chaff and bran); lucerne is grown in abundance outside the city; grass is obtainable from the uplands. Horses do well. Stabling scanty and bad ■ Water. Excellent. There a?e wells innumerable throughout the town, and every house and garden in Bir-al-Azab has its well for irrigation and drinking purposes. These wells are worked by bullock, camel or both, at a single or double wheel. Depth to surface of water about GO feet. North of Sana'a from under the walls of Bir-al-Azab flows a perennial brook used exhaustive ly for irrigation——it is known as the Alaf. South of Sana a across the broad level flats towards the city flows another small er brook, a mere ditch which is exhausted among the suburban gardens east of Bab-al-Balakah before entering the city. The dry nullah that crosses Sana'a town becomes a broad stony wddi north of the city and is known as the Ska '6; along it passes on- of the northern roads from Sana'a. This wddi swings north east many miles past Raudhah and drains eventually into the Wddi Kharid. , . , , , Climate.—Dvy and bracing. Sana a city is not healthy owing to defective sanitation ; mosquitoes occur in Bir-al-Azab. Rain fall from June to September usually adequate, but this year (1913) rains have been short at Sana'a and in the immediate neighbourhood. . m i .i The health of the inhabitants is not good. They dress m sheepskin poshteens for the chill of the morning and keep these on during the heat of the day. Coughs, colds and bronchial troubles result, and there is a tendency to phthisis among the poorer classes. There were 200 Turkish soldiers in hospital in September out of a stated total garrison of 5,000. Tins is considered an abnormally small proportion. Cases were chiefly fever (ague and malarial), many of which were imported and not contracted locally. The mortality among troops is said to be high. _488 ROUTE No. 129.

The first station from Mecca on this road is Zaimah, about 10 miles short of which are several steep ascents. Zaimah is a half-ruined castle, at the eastern extremity of Wadi Laimun, with copious springs of running water. From Zaimah the road to Taif leads on the second day to Sail, a rivulet so called flow ing across a plain, which is without trees but has an abundance of good pasture. Here the road enters a mountainous tract, through which is a narrow and diffi cult passage of about 6 liours. The station of this day is Aqrab, situated in the p'ain at about three hours' distance from Taif to the northward and on the same level with it ; thus a traveller reaches T5if on the fourth day from Mecca. —(J.

(ALTERNATIVE.) Huber's route from Khaibar to Hail in December, 1879, lay to the south of Doughty's and passed Al-Hayat, Ghazalah and Mustajiddah. According to his map* the distance from Hadiyah to Hail by this route is 281 miles. He left Khaibar by a track known as Sardab-al-Yahud (or al-Kuffar) which, at the end of about 3 miles, passes a score of heaps of stones, from 25 to 30 yards apart, called Krgoumal-Yahojd {sic). At a distance of rather more than 50 miles from Khaibar, he crossed a ridge with six peaks, of which the highest, Jabal-al-Abyadh, lay 10 of 12 miles to the south of his track. At Al-Hayat he found wheat, barley, and millet being cultivated, and three peren nial springs of drinking water ; but no cattle nor transport animals. He states that two hours after leaving Al-Hayat the hnrrah proper ceases, but that it continues sporadically for 10 miles. After crossing the Wadi Makhid in which he found water, the soil becomes clayey covered with gravel.

The half-way is reached at Sha'ib Thamail alongside which is the hill known as Qarat-al-Ashar, with 3 wells about 500 yards to the north-east of it in the bed of the watercourse. The route passes amongst sandstone hills of fantastic shapes, and crosses occasional small watercourses.

It then passes through a small valley called Waiwi about m. 18, and enters i larger one, Wadi Sadr, which formed by the accession of various ravines and smaller valleys running down from between the peaks of the main chain, gradually expands into an open plain along its foot. ^ The ravines in the mountains are steep and rugged, but afford plenty of water and contain some date trees562 R oute N o . 167— contd. Tho soil of the plain is soft sand, but not entirely barren. The Wadi Sadr is one of the most fertile spots on the coastal plain. The route crosses it in a north-north-easterly direction towards Jabal Harab at about m. 27, and skirts along the foot of the hill which runs east-north-east and gives rise to a wide opening through the main chain. At m. 31 the route begins to pene trate the rugged defiles of the interior of the chain. The first valley is called Al-KahoJah. At m. 35 the direction changes to north-east, and the valley takes the name of Al-Halaiqah. At m. 44 a defile, Naqb-al-Halaiqah, is entered. At m. 4 the summit of the defile is passed, and the route descends into ct.i open circular plain called As-Suwaiqah, about 3 miles in diameter. The route crosses this plain to the hills on the south- south-east border. At m. 51 a valley, Al-Muraihah, is en tered. At m. 57 the route enters a pass, Dhaiqat-as-Sa'lul, and at m. 61 enters Wadi Sawawln, a regularly defined valley sloping rapidly to the west-south-west. The route here turns north-east, and follows a difficult track along the bottom of the valley, which is much encumbered with huge stones, to mile 69, where it ascends a very steep defile, Naqb-as-Sawiwm, to the watershed between the valleys running to the Red Sea and the interior at m. 71. All along the route there have been scat tered acacia trees, and some herbage, and in certain places date and almond trees. On the east side of the watershed the tejcent is very gentle. The route descends into the Wadi Rawiyin and follows it in an east-south-easterly direction to m. 74. It then turns east-north-east, and enters Al-Hisma, a vast plain of soft, but not entirely barren, sand, with occasional patches of rocks and a few isolated hills. At m. 98 Wadi 'Unainid crossed ; it is a ravine resembling the dry bed of a torrent, descending from tho Jabal Harrah in a north-north-westerly direc- tion between hillocks and ridges of loose sand. There is a well of good water (probably near the mountains ?) and much her bage ^nd brushwood.

General Description. —This route for the first two stages runs along a cart-road, but after that there are only caravan tracks. The country is at first volcanic, and covered with black, basaltic rocks; but it gradually changes until, at stage 11, it becomes a big, rolling steppe with sandhills and patches of gravel, • and no longer volcanic. Soon after leaving stage 7, the route enters a broad and shallow depression called the Wadi Sirhan, up which it winds for 140 miles. The bottom of this valley is sandy and level, different caravans following different' series of wells. It is not probable that any single caravan would touch at all the -wells mentioned below as too much zigzagging would be thereby entailed.

Sakakah is a small Arab town, of about 350 houses subs tantially built, and occasionally of two storeys. It is on the edge of the Nafud desert, and is about 3 miles long by 1 broad, run ning roughly north-east and south-west. The population is about 1,700 souls. Many thousands of date palms, and the dates are excellent. Many wells, both sweet and brackish. They number perhaps 300. The brackish wells are used for irrigating the date palms and the patches of barley and grass. Livestock, practically nil, except a few camels. Meat is almost unknown. A few merchants from Xejef and Kerbala, but scarcely anything can be had from them. Overlooking the town, and perched on a rock at the north end of it, is a castle belonging to ibn Rashid by whom the town is administered. 21 JAUF-AL-UMR .. 27 m.

(a) Via Blr-ath-Thamad. —The road to 'Aqabah via BIr-ath Thamad is about two miles longer. It leaves the main track five miles short of Bir Abu Muhammad and goes on to Ath-Thamad, where there is a well 12 feet deep, which never runs dry. Track turns north from here and joins main route north of Jabal Risha about six miles beyond Bir Abu Muhammad. (b) Via Ar-Ralui Pass.—A fair road runs from Shatt to Bir Mu- baiyuk, where there is a large quantity of water. It then zigzags for 17 miles up the Wadi-ar-Raha and south up the Wadi Khahail for 2J miles to the edge of the escarpment. Steep incline into Wadi Sudr impassable for wheels. Unlimited supply of water at 'Ain Sudr ; after that no more water till Nakhl is reached. Route joins the Hajj road and the telephone line 10 miles from Nakhl. (c) Via Wddi Siuir. —Another route follows the Sinai caravan track to ' Ayun Musa, where there is a very good supply of water. It then enters the Wadi Sudr, which is very steep and rocky ; the remainder of the route is fit for all arms.fffiffslflrf j .«f # .1 Distance. Station. ' | Inter- | mediate. Total. km. km.

At mile 21, arrive Maqdam (pronounced Mijdam). There is no permanent habita tion here; only some tents of Zoba' Arabs. There is a small wood on the left bank of the Euphrates 800 yards long by 150 yards wide, consisting of medium sized poplar trees, surrounded by tamarisk. Goods from Hit, such as lime, gypsum, and bitumen, are often deposited here for transport to Baghdad on camel-ba?k. The most important Arab tribe hereabouts is the Sabbagh. The bank of the river is sandy, which is bad in a wind. The left bank is shelving, the right, steep. Breadth of water, 200 yards.

There is at mile 1 a large dyke on the right-hand side ; on the left, cavalry barracks. In the first 2 miles the track crosses several irrigation channels, some of which are impassable for artillery, being about 6 feet deep and 10 feet wide; the only bridges bsing light ones of palm-tree wood about 3 feet wide. On the left are walled date gardens for about 2 miles. Cultivation on both sides of the road for about 4 miles. Opposite Kadhimain, the track is boggy for about a | of a mile. After 6 miles, low mounds occur on both sides of the road, but chiefly on the right. About mile 10 there is a ruined fort about 400 yards to the left. Two miles from Jadidah cultivation again begins on both sides, with several irrigation channels, just as on leaving Baghdad.' The river nearJadTdah has high dykes on the left bank to protect the cultivation from floods. These dykes are about 20 feet high, 12 feet on top, and base 30 feet wide. They afford complete cover from the river. About ^ a mile and 1 mile outside Jadidah are 2 mud and wattle villages of about 50 inhabitants each. Tn tTadidah are 2 khans, one near entrance to the village, about 80 yards square, stabling for 200 horses well in centre, water about 20 feet from surface. This khan has on the roof a low parapet of mud about 2 feet high and 15 inches thick. Two staircases on the roof in north-west and south -east corners. Another khan about 300 yards further on and about 150 yards from river bank, with nothing between it and the river. This khan is about 60 yards square, stabling for about 100 horses. In the centre of each khan is a circular hole about 15 yards in diameter and 4 feet deep in centre ; abundant water from Tigris. Jadidah (1) has about 300 houses of mud walls, and many date gardens enclosed by walls. Most of the walls are topped with thorny brushwood, which answers the purposes of broken glass.

Map of country near ttwainah is misleading : the hills begin about 2 miles on the Deli Abbas side of Swainah and continue on both sides of the road as far as the eye can see until the bottom of the pass is reached.

This is really only a broad mountain torrent. At 15 miles enter low hills (downs) again, road again pebbly: at 17 miles reach summit and continue nearly level for ]| miles, when gradual descent towards Kifri begins: at 19 miles descent ends, and then flat pebbly plain till Kifri is reached.

The country through- out this march was 133 m. grassy, undulating, with several ravines and nullahs of gently sloping sides: for about 6 miles the road is sunken (hollow) about 10 feet below the level of the surrounding country (except in the ravines themselves); the going is good for horses, but difficult for wheels and trouble some for artillery: at 7 miles cross a mountain stream, a few pools of water just running; this stream is about 200 yards wide, pebbly bottom, left bank gently sloping and low; right bank, higher and steeper, rises about 30 feet in 60 yards ; village of about 100 mud-walled houses about 3 miles to the left and on the left bank of this stream. The hills are about £ of a mile from the road on the right all the way except at this stream, where they come to within 200 yards, shortly after again receding to | mile : the hilla are throughout about 400 feet above the level of the track : at 8 miles the road is nearly level, but at 10 miles it again becomes undulating, though less than before, and the undulation gets less as Tuz Khurmatu is approached; at about U miles from Tuz Khurmatu cross large mountain stream bed, about 450 yards wide, and pebbly; about 20 yards by 2 feet of water in two separate portions of the bed, one on left bank, one near right bank ; banks easy, but general height above bed about 15 feet: higher on the left bank than onhight bank : stream easily fordable now, but dangerous when swollen by rain, for there are several varying depressions in the bed ; after reaching right bank cross 3 water-cuts contiguous to each other, each about 10 feet deep and 6 feet wide: small brick bridge about 4 feet over each; smaller water-cuts (easily crossed) without bridges as town is neared. Town is mainly built of mud walls, but there are several stone houses and 2 khans in the heart of the bazar : about 300 houses. Water abundant and perennial, good from stream: there is a Mudir here, about 120 infantry, 50 mule-men and 20 Zaptiehs. 1 he tele graph line is on left of road and distant about 3 miles, after that it approaches and crosses road, keeping alongside of it for the rest659 !

Water at Tank good and plentiful from river; the road is nearly level the whole way and excellent going ; cultivation on both sides almost throughout; country quite open except on right, where there are hills. Tank has about 200 houses and a population of 600 ; there is a Mudir here and a few officers and reserve troops, but no soldiers of the active army : the revenue of the Mudirate is about £ T.3,000 and the expenditure a little over £ T. 2,000 ; more Shiahs than Sunnis. The Daoudiyeh tribe of Kurds levy a sort of blackmail on this road from passing caravans, nominally as a protection against robbery by Arabs ' or others.' I saw two cases of this on the day I passed ; they stoppd a camel caravan and would not let it proceed until it had paid 6 Medjidies and given them some dates ; 4 donkeys had to pay 6 annas. Ismail Beg is the head of this tribe and lives in a village a few miles behind the hills on the right. 9 KIRKUK ,, 25 m.

Arbil has 3,000 houses and about 15,000 inhabitants: the main town and public buildings are on a high mound in the centre about 300 feet high and about 400 yards in diameter : the rest of the town, consisting of the poorer houses, clusters round the base of this hill; the mound appears to consist of mud, the sides are precipitous: it is visible from about 7 miles and forms a sort of citadel with one gate in the direction of Altun Kupri. The houses here are mostly of brick. Water-supply is sufficient, but it is collected from a karez into a tank, the surroundings of which are filthy. The best water is from the karez outside of the town on the Altun Kupri side. The khan is indifferent, a two-storeyed building with a lot of little rooms all pound, very dark ; stabling665 Route No. 184— contd. along a pebbly mountain torrent, and finally at 21 miles emerges on to a broad cultivated plain. The bed of the Zab is about 800 yards across and sandy and pebbly, but in flood the river must be 1 mile or more in breadth. When I passed the stream was about 150 yards wide with a current of about 4 miles an hour. Animals have to swim across with men to guide them ; goods are ferried across in a punt-shaped boat about 20 feet long and 8 feet wide, lightly built. The crossing is troublesome. There is a village on each bank: the one on the left bank is IJ miles from the actual water and contains about 50 mud houses with a walled enclosure on a mound 50 feet high.

On leaving Mosul pass through cemetery; for m. 5 miles country is open, low hills on right about 60 to 100 feet high : on left, river from 1,000 to 100 yards off : road, hills* and river gradually con verge and meet at 5 miles : much cultivation : for fifth mile there is a stream on the left about 100 to 200 yards frOm road, from 10 to 20 feet wide and 3 feet deep. After 5 miles road turns half-right and ascends hills by a very stony and rocky road, leaving the river on the left. For about 11 miles road continues rocky and stony. At 5J miles pass village on left 200 yards from road, with a mud and brick fort about 100 yards north of village. This fort commands the road where it enters the hills and is about 60 by 50 yards, with two towers, walls about 20 feet high. On the right of the road and 160 yards from it is a deep rocky ra\inc, 100 feet deep, but passable for all arms. At 6h miles reach top of downs and begin to descend ; road a little better, but soon gets rocky and stony again, cultivation on right. At ' m ^ es descent ends ; the road improves and goes along bottom of open valley, 500 yards wide and 100 feet deep.

After leaving Ham- mam Ali follow the 39 m. bank of the river for about 1 mile, then turn half-right for about | of a mile to skirt a stream which flows into the Tigris. This stream is 30 yards wide and 12 feet deep; then cross this stream and return to river bank. On reaching river bank, again leave it and keep nearly parallel to low hills on right at 200 yards distance. At 3 miles enter the hills on the right diagonally, at the site of a ruined town, through which the road passes. Up to this the road is good, but on entering hills it is rocky and stony for about 2 miles, gradually ascending. Leave the ruins of Nimrud (half-left) on the far bank of the river, distant about 4 miles. At about 5 miles the road is very rocky and stony for about 100 yards and impassable for guns, which, however, might make a slight detour up a rocky ravine on the right. Shortly after this the top of the hills (about 300 feet high) is reached, and after that the road is practically level and very good, the country gently undulating and easy with excellent grazing. At 7 miles pass a ruined village on the right at 2 miles distance. This good grazing ground is Saniyah* land. At 11 miles pass a small winding nullah on right and a small mound about 30 feet high and 800 yards to the right. At 11^ miles the said nullah approaches the road and the road runs along the edge of it at a precipitous place about 30 feet deep, the road it self is sloping here into the nullah and a little difficult for wheels. *i.e., the private property of thp. Sult »n of Turkey, who leems to appropriate most of the good land to hinwelf.670 'Route No. 185— contd. At 12 miles the nullah on the right continues at about 200 yards from, (and nearly parallel to), the road. It is about 30 feet deep; but has sloping banks in many places and is easily crossable. The nullah was dry in most places, but probably holds water after rain. At 13 miles pass the village of Shoora, on the right at 1J miles. There is drinking water here, but it is a little brackish; also an enclosed khan of fortifiable kind with some Saniyah soldiers; this khan has a balakhana on the north side and is about 60 by 40 yards. The nullah on the right continues and a little later the road passes through the ruins of an old village. At 14 miles the nullah on the right seems to disappear. At 16 miles, road skirts edge of circular nullah with steep bank on road side ; water in nullah clear, but slightly brackish. At 21 miles cross small nullah, dry and easy. At 22| miles enter large open valley on the bank of I igris. At 23 miles cross a stream 30 yards wide and 10 feet deep, water about 20 feet wide and 3 feet deep, brackish but clear, not good for drinking. At 24 miles reach bank of 1 igris at Rumanah ; camp on edge of river, which is here in two streams, the near one about 150 yards wide, the other invisible; island in middle; village on opposite bank about 2 miles distant.

Small mound about one mile to the left and enter stinking valley of bitumen and nap it ha, Avhich are both on the surface here, the naphtha ground joing like a marsh into which horses sink.

On leaving the valley the road is very671 R oute N o. 1%5—contd. rocky and bad, impassable for guns, Avhich would have to make a detour. After getting out of this valley, enter large alluvial plain on the right, low hills (150 feet) 300 yards away, on the left, river 1 mile off, road good ; hills on far bank of river are about 2C0 feet high and 2 miles distant. At 3 J miles pass small village oti the far bank of river and 2 miles to the left; 200 yards to the left is more naphtha and bitumen. Hills on the right end here and the country is flat and open for miles in all directions ; the river on the left is about 800 yards to I mile distant. At 7 miles ascend some high ground, 60 feet high ; road stony, river 1| miles on left. At miles after the rise the road is still stony and the ground raviney on both sides. At 8 miles descend again 00 feet; road pebbly, into small valley like the bed of the river, with some cultivation on left. On ascending again (40 feet) from this valley, the road improves and the country is a large alluvial plain with low hills 150 feet high on right and 200 yards off, and to the left the ground is flat and open to the river 2£ miles off. At 10 miles the country is still the same, but the hills on the right are broken by some small valleys like the mouths of dry rivers. At 10^ miles small village on far bank of river 3 miles off. At 11 miles cross small nullah and broken ground : nullah 20 feet and 40 yards wide, easy to cross, gap in hills on right; cultivation on left 1,000 yards oft. At 1,2 miles descend 50 feet into lower plain, also cultivated ; road turns quarter-left and is pebbly. At 13 miles pass small winding grassy nullah on left. Hills on right 150 feet high, 300 tO 400 yards off ; road good. At 15 miles hills on right much lower for about 1 mile, almost amounting to a g a P in the chain. At 18 miles pass a camping ground known as Jarnaf ; stream and pools of rain water, which is good to drink. The road here meets the hills on the right. Rounding the corner of the hills cross nullah 20 yards wide and 20 feet deep, water 25 feet, good and plentiful. 300 yards further on enter hills, road stony and ascending up the bed of a dry stream, through narrow pass between hills 100 feet high on both sides. Reach the top at 18|- miles, stony downs to right and left. Road then becomes good and flat. At 19| miles, descent begins very similar to ascent, but road good.

At 2 miles meet hills on right: on left river 1 mile off. At 4 miles up to the point skirt low hills on right but without crossing them, but now cross a very low spur and enter open plain 1 mile long by i mile wide, at end of this plain cross a small nullah 20 feet wide by 5 feet deep (a little rain water) and then turn half-right into hills. Rain water here in pools : soil sandy, camp good, water fair, but limited, enough for 12 horses and 50 men, 100 sheep grazing. 5 SHAR AMIYAH 38 m. Shergut fort (so- called) is on the 103 m. i e f^ f ron ^ 0 f cam p . it is a ruined fort about miles from 'Ain Shababit and com- mands the river at this point. It is on the site of a large mound, which is apparently the remains of a ruined city. Leaving 'Ain Shababit the road goes nearly south with a little west in it, and immediately enters low hills 60 to 100 feet high: the road is good and sandy; it winds through these low hills for 2 miles, when the summit is reached : near the top it is difficult for guns and apparently no detour possible. When the summit is reached the road is flat and good ; sandy; it passes along the reverse slope of these lulls (Jebel Chanuka in Kiepert's map) ; the slope is gentle, gradually descending diagonally till the valley at the bottom is reached : it then crosses this valley almost at right ang os. The further half of the valley contains several deep and steep nullahs, average about 50 feet deep and 100 feet wide. As the road ascends the opposite slope the ground is raviney. road wind8 'P and down these ravines till 11 miles, when the summit is reached ; during the ascent the road is rocky for about i mile8 P assm g over outcrops of marble. The 'road keeps filong the top of these hills, the country being raviney and broken on bqtb sides. This range (which is called Jabal Hamrinm R oute N o . 186 contd. on Kiepert's map) is about a mile wide and about 200 feet high On the far right is a vast desert, extending as far as the horizon. At 13 miles descent begins : it is gradual and easy. At 14 miles reach the spring of Balalij at the bottom (or nearly the bottom) of the hill. It is on the right side of, and adjoining, the road. The water is said to be brackish : it was very scanty and the ground round was so much befouled that it was impossible to test the water : unfit for drinking. At 14J miles the descent ends, the road bends slightly to the left and skirts the reverse slope of the Jabal Hamrin, which is like a glacis with many wide and easy nullahs. The road goes up and down these nullahs. There is said to be a spring on the road 2 or 3 hours beyond Balalij, but my guide could not find it: 12 hours after, one of my mule teers said it was on the hills and that we had passed it a long way back. I think there is probably such a spring, but that it was now dry ; its water is said to be brackish, and on the whole I recommend that no reliance be placed on it. At 17 miles there is rather a difficult nullah for guns or wheels. After this the road turns slightly to the right, leaving the hills (there 300 feet high) further away on the left. We are now in the middle of a vast plain, a true desert, along which the road continues for many weary miles. The want of water was much felt by men and animals. At 35 miles, this plain is ended by a sandy river, with a few pools of very salt and dirty water (quite undrinkable): after crossing the river, the road winds through some low sandy mounds with a very brackish stream of water on the left: this water is in pools and is also undrinkable. At 38 miles the road emerges on to the Tigris, which is here in 2 streams, the near one about 150 yards across, sloping banks, island in the middle about 1 mile long and 1 mile wide. Total width of Tigris about 2 miles. Camping ground good, flat, hard and sandy, We are now in a large semicircular plain, radius about 1 mile, bounded on the left by the Tigris, on the right by a range of low hillocks about 50 feet high 6 SHARIAT-AL- 15 m.

At 5 miles the sandy mounds on the right rise into low hills with abrupt and indented cliffs about 70 to 100 feet high, pass through tamarisk scrub for about a mile ; hills 1 mile on right; river 1 mile on left. At this point pass a sandy bluff jutting out into the plain from the hills Behind this bluff are the ruins of Kala Mekrum At 7 miles touch the river | mile wide: hills on right | mile • the other stream of the river is out of sight, about 2 miles away At 9 miles the hills are about 400 yards to the right and there is a stream of good water from the Tigris 100 yards to the left.

At 14 miles, the road meets the hills and there is a branch of the Tigris touch- mg the same place : the road is broken away and would be diffi- cult for guns or wheels; the water is good, 30 feet wide and 5 feet deep, the banks 25 yards across and 20 feet deep. After this the road hugs the hills and is very pebbly : at 15 miles cross a stream (Mahzm by name) (no water), pebbly bed of a mountain torrent.

Tikrit contains about 2,000 houses, mostly of mud and stone, and the population are poor. Supplies obtainable in moderate quantities. I went on a mile beyond Tikrit and camped in the bed and at the foot of a nullah on the left which meets the river. This camping ground is sandy and stony and about 100 yards by 50. There is cultivation about 100 yards wide between the river and the adjoining cliff 50 foot high. . This appears to be the only camping ground near Tikrit, the immediate neighbour hood of which is a tangled mass of ruins and broken ground. There is a Mudlr here and a few Zaptiehs.

At If miles road approaches river, which is 200 yards dis tant on left, up and down, stony, broken ground on both sides ; at 2 miles descend into and cross bed of dry mountain torrent 200 yards wide and very pebbly. At 3 miles descend steep ravine 200 yards wide and 150 feet deep, very stony, running into river 300 yards on left. At 3J miles country is still raviney on left, more open and flat on the right.

The road then leaves the river and skirts the hills on the right, which gradually dwindle in height: road good. At 6| miles there is a ditch on the right of the road which runs roughly parallel to the hills for about 4 miles : this ditch is dry, 35 feet wide and 5 feet deep, easy banks.

The town of Samarra with the Shiah mosques are on the other side of the river and about \ of a mile higher up. The bridge consists of 52 boats, each boat being 32 feet long, feet wide with a gunwale of 4 feet, flat-bottomed. The road- way of the bridge is 12 feet wide and made of planks and baulks of timber plastered with bitumen : there is a hand-rail on each I I v ? 6 . are made of a framework of wood, matting a retched over it and the whole plastered with bitumen. There are several Gufas of various sizes here.677 R oute N o . 185— contd. The town or village ^of Samarra contains about 600 houses, and about 2,000 people ; many houses are empty audit appears to be a declining town. Its raison d'etre is that it is the burial place of two of the Imams and it is therefore peculiarly sacred to the Shiahs, who make pilgrimages to it in large numbers, especially from Persia. It is surrounded by a polygonal (about 16 sides) wall, 20 feet high and 4 feet thick up to about 15 feet, after which it is only about 2 feet thick. This wall is crenelat ed and has two rows of loop-holes, one at a height of about 6 feet and the other near the top. It has four gates, north, south, east and west, and the wall has a semicircular bastion at each end, which is intended to flank the curtains. It has ruins and broken ground all round it which would afford excellent cover for an attack. It is about 400 yards from the Tigris on the river side and is on the left bank, on a salient. The houses are mostly of brick with a covered bazar. Supplies limited. The garrison consists of 100 Redifs and about 15 Zaptiehs and there is a Kaim- makam here.^TheJdome of one mosque is covered with gold plat© or leaf and is situate in the centre of the town. Th^ right bank of the river is low, sandy, the left bank consists of a few preci pitous bluffs of conglomerate interspersed with 3 or 4 Shariahs or landing places. The soil round the town is old bricks and pebbles (raised beaoh). 10 harba (jisr 22 m. Prom Samarra the ______ jiarba). road goes south-west jgj m over a level and partly cultivated plain of sandy clay. At If miles the Tigris approaches the road on the left at 800 yards distance, and on the right there is some high ground (50 feet) about 1 mile from the road. At 3f m iies pass a ditch on the left 20 yards wide with good water 2 feet deep ; this is rain water ; the banks of this ditch are easy but muddy. At 5 miles on the right the high ground continues roughlv parallel to the road and from 1 to 3 miles off : on the left there is a branch of the Tigris 300 yards off, 80 yards wide, easy banks, good camping ground for 5,000 troops. At 5^ miles the high ground on the right curves round and goes to the river on the left; the road crosses this high ground and the country is slightly undulating. From this point to Harba the road is al most continuously pebbly and the country a desert without any cultivation. There is, however, a little scrub acacia in the679 Route No. 185— contd. yards distance there is a depression in the ground 50 feet deep which looks like the bed of an old river or canal: this depression continues parallel to the road for about 4 miles. I think it is an old bed of the Tigris. There is a good deal of cultivation on both sides throughout this march. At 5 miles small water channel 150 yards on left, bank 10 feet wide by 5 feet deep, water 3 feet by 2 feet, good. At 8 miles the road passes over a series of canals, some with water and some without, until Dujail is reached. There are about 20 of these canals varying in width from 40 feet to 10 feet and in depth from 20 feet to 6 feet. They were nearly all crossed by palm-tree bridges 10 feet wide. They are less frequent as Dujail is reached, and instead of crossing the roads they tend to go more parallel to it. Dujail has 2,000 inhabitants and 1 khan in the centre of the town, with a bala- khana of seven rooms. Supplies fairly plentiful, i.e., for 1 ,000 men and 500 horses for 1 day; water good and abundant. Sheep .. .. .. 1,500^ Kine .. .. .. 150 ( grazing en rotde.

For about 4 miles after leaving Dujail there are several canal-beds (most ly dry and out of use), with banks on both sides of the road at about 2,800 yards distance on the left and about a mile on the right. At 2 miles 2 small canals (with water in them) are crossed by palm-tree bridges : about 15 feet between banks and 10 feet deep ; water 4 feet wide by 2 feet deep. There are some mounds here on the left at 500 yards about 10 feet high, which continue roughly parallel to the road for about 3 miles or more. For the first half of the journey the country is interspersed with these mounds and banks, but they lessen in size and number as Khan Mushahidah is approached. At 7 miles pass a tomb with dome, 100 yards to the left, and then pass through lumpy mounds for about J a mile, which are evidently the ruins of some town. After this the country is flat and featureless. At 141 miles there is a low and boggy piece of road for about 200 yards and again at 15| miles for about 100 yards. There is a good deal of681 R oute N o. 185— concld. difficult for guns. Soon after another similar water-cut with a palm-tree bridge only 3 feet wide. At 6^ miles reach the river Tigris, here 150 yards wide : and follow bank of river on dyke. This route is in my opinion impossible for guns or carts, but ?«(( possible for infantry or cavalry in file. The cart road or track, which should in my opinion be followed by any large body or by any party of men with much transport, goes roughly ^ parallel to the river at a distance of about 3 miles from it, thus as? avoiding all water-cuts and such obstacles, and presenting no i* difficulties. At 11 miles the road I followed leaves the raised dyke on the bank of the river and crosses an open level plain to Kadhimain (to cut off a bend of the river). At 13 miles and again at 14£ miles the road and country are very boggy and would be altogether impassable in wet weather. Several small and easy water-cuts are passed on nearing Kadhimain, which is in the telegraphic communication with Baghdad by a double wire and by a badly-laid and badly-maintained horse tram- • line. ROUTE No. 186. F rom BAGHDAD to KHANlQlN. 95 miles. 7 marches. This is the main caravan route from Baghdad into Persia. Much of the Indian trade goes by it, and it is also an important pilgrim route. The track goes nearly parallel with, and crosses, the Diyalah river level with the Diyalah river which it crosses, at Ba'qubah at mile 33, by a ferry. The track then keeps north-east by Shahraban and Qizil Rubat to Khanaqin which is reached at mile 95. The Persian Frontier is about a mile east of the town.

From here at 260°—over same kind of ground—up to mile 97, and from there at 270° up to mile 119, where the Wadi Hail is reached. (This is its name according to the Bedouins). This is a valley about 1 mile broad, which holds running water accord ing to native reports at times of excessive rain. Its bed is about 50 feet below surface of the plain : its sides slope at about 1 in 60. Its course is from north-east to south-west. Accord ing to native reports it begins at hills to the north-east and runs for a day's march (say 40 miles) to the south-east beyond the point where I crossed it. Also according to native reports (a) water can bo obtained at 4 feet, below the surface but is very brackish, (6) there is a well of bad water in the wddi about i m. south-east of my point of crossing. From the wddi at 300° over rolling stony downs, the grazing improving up to mile 139, where there are eight wells, 10 feet below plain surface, with good water—slightly salt. From the wells at 270° up a long broad valley, running east and west bordered on south by edge of the downs, on north by salt hills, up to mile 167. From here at 250° to mile 183 follow the course of the valley, and thence at 220° to south border of valley at mile 196 where the downs bend away to south and consequently the valley ceases. From here at 240° until the road from Dair-az-Zor to Tadmur was reached at mile 212. The point where it was met was about 20 miles north-east of Tadmur. Total distance 232 miles.

The track the whole way lies over sandy desert, destitute of grazing: suitable for guns and wheeled transport. At Rotha there is no village, it merely constituting an occa sional camping ground for Bedouins. Its water supply, however, is good, from two large springs, sufficient for any number of men and animals; and round the springs there is good grazing for horses. The natives report that these springs do not dry up during the summer. 4 RUMADIYAH . . 32 m. General direction of march north. Track 109 m north over desert, no grazing of any kind.

Between Qumah and MadTnah (14 miles) the banks consist of date groves alternating with reed swamps. Msdinah is a town of some 2,500 inhabitants, situated on the right bank. Under the Turk ish administration it was the seat of a Harbour Master and the headquarters of the Nahiyah of the same name in the Qadha of Qumah. Near Madlnah on the south side of the river are great marshes known as the Hor-al-Jazair which communicate with the Shatt-al-' Arab, and from which also, in flood time, Eu phrates water finds its way down to the track between Basrah and Zubair, For the next 15 miles up to the eastern end of Chah- baish village, both banks consist of reed swamps. During the entire length innumerable small streams run into the marshes on either bank. Chahbaish is a straggling village, some 6 miles in length, inhabited by Bani Asad Arabs. It is situated-in a long belt of date palms on the left bank of the river. During the low water season, Chahbaish forms a convenient place to tranship from river steamers into shallow draught boats. 2 CHAHBAISH 4|m.

The entrance to the Mezlik Channel from the lake is difficult to locate in flood season.

It becomes passable for these craft again about November. This year being abnormal, a minimum of 2' was reported about 20th August, and a medium-sized bellum could still pass. Normally at this time it would be dry with pools and stretches of water at intervals. The only really reliable through route from the south is by the Nahr-al-Beda'ah which carries away much of the water of the Shatt-al-Gharaf and flows into the Hammar Lake. This route is practicable for large bellums from December to July, and this year in the flood season three motor boats were brought down it, but with considerable difficulty and much local assistance. There is a broad shallow bar in the Hammar which seldom has more than two feet of water over it. The Nahr Hamsa admits of passage of small bellums only'dur- ing similar periods. Throughout the greater part of its length the Nahr-al-Beda'ah in the flood season expands into a wide ' khor, ' and its overflow fills numerous parallel side channels. Transport. —Moving northwards from Nasiriyah, land trans port would be necessary throughout. There are not very many boats at Shatrail normally (say some 30 small bellums and 10 large) and they would very probably be removed before any troops reached the town. If an advance were made from Kut, boats could be brought up the Tigris and so down. ROUTE No. 194. F rom RAHALIYAH to HIT. 78 miles. 4 stages. Authorily. —Lieutenant T. C.

The country through which the uuuugll mad runs is flat but interepersud with mounds, which are sel dom more than IS feet above the snrronnding country, and have gently sloping sides. They form no real obstacle to the move ment of men! horses or even carts, but they afted cover from view or fire to a considerable distance in real of them. he first mounds of this kind are met with at a distance of 3 to 4 miles from Baghdad in a north-easterly direction. Three or four miles further on a different sort of mound is encountered, the silted up remains of old canals ninning generally north-by- west to south -by-east. There are two or three such embank, mints running parallel to each other, and varying in height from fifteen to five feet, and in breadth from forty to ten feet. For the first 8 miles the soil is light clay, hut as the river is approach ed the soil becomes more sandy. In dry weather carts and animals can move over this country in almost any direction with ease but even a little rain proves a serious obstacle, for then the i .il becomes first slippery and then sticky and quaggy. Alter an inch of rain this country is difficult, even for footmen, to traverse, and after a heavy fall it would generally to impass able for at least 24 hours after the ground began to dry.

These lakes are merely collections of rain water in depressions of the ground, and do not generally exceed three feet m clept i. There are no reeds or grass in these lakes and no cover of any kind on or near them. During the winter, grass is very a mn- dant but verv short, and in the hot season the water and grass disappear, and the place becomes a burning desert of dust. There is a certain amount of fertile land at Sanniyah which is the property of the Sultan. This place is not marked on the map and there is no mention of what the water-supply, etc., is. I he distance of the march also is not given,_and so the total distance, as measured on the map, between Abu Aru] and Baladruz, namely, 32 miles, has been divided between the two stages. 3 BALADRUZ .. 16 m. General direction north-easterly. lor the 46 m first 12 miles of this march the country is exactly the same as before, but on nearing Balad ruz it becomes lower and marshy. During or soon after ram this country must be quite impassable. At two or three miles from Baladruz a few irrigation channels are met with, but they are not a serious obstacle even to carts. The mam canal from the north, however, known as the Baladruz canal is about 8 feet deep and about 20 feet wide, and when full is a complete obstacle to all progress except at very few places where it is b'dged- There are only three such places in the neighbourhood of Balad ruz and one' bridge (about 4 miles north of Baladruz) only consists of .two palm trees thrown across, with some dust and mud spread over them. The other bridges are one of brick and one of wood in the village of Baladruz itself. The brick bridge leads into and is part of a farm belonging to a Constantinople Greek, named Zarifi. This brick bridge is about ten feet wide and strong enough for field artillery or ordinary carts. It leads into the farmyard, from which there is a road with an exit to right and left, on the opposite side of the bridge, the farm houses and buildings are of brick and consist of four c ourtyard, leading by narrow passages into one another.

This station is on a neck of low hills. Just beyond it is a ruined village on the left side of the road. After 15 minutes we reached Tazashan village, 30 houses of Zangabad Kurds. After 12 minutes more we halted. 3rd Station 1 hr. 7 mts. From the place reached Zangabad lies a little east of south-east. A little to the west of south-south-west, at 1 mile, is Hajilar village, 70 houses of Zangabad Kurds. This village is a free hold property of Majid Pasha, Baban Kurd, who lives at Salahi- yah. Tazashan now bears about south-east. After 5 minutesVe passed Kokaz village, 30 houses of Zan - gabad Kurds, on the left side of the road. After 15 minutes more we reached another station. 4 th Station 1 hr. 27 mts. From this point the last (3rd) station lies a little to the south of east-south-east. To the south-west by south, at 1J miles, is Tappah Charmi hamlet, 7 houses of Zangabad Kurds. We proceeded for 23 minutes. All the way here from B5n Sanduq village there have been low hills immediately on right of the road.723 R oute N o 201— contd. coming more from the eastwards. Each stream, at this time, was clear and a few feet broad, but quite shallow. The Zardao is said to run westwards from here for an hour or two, and to be expended in irrigation. So far as we have come from Khanaqin we have met with no real obstacle to artillery except the Diyalah river, which it would be difficult or impossible to get guns over, when in flood, without rafts or other means brought from a distance. This day a number of little ravines from the hills have intersected the road, few if any of them more than 12 feet deep or 20 feet broad, and probably all of them capable of being easily made passable fo,r ?.rtillery. After 8 minutes we passed the mill of 'Abdul 'Aziz Agha of QSrah Tappah, who was at the time acting spmewhere as a civil Mudir. From this mill the village of Tall Ishan lies south by west. After 12 minutes more we ascended a mound at the side of the road. The ground is hilly after leaving Tall Ishan. 9 th S tation 3 hrs. 52 mts. From this mound Tall Ishan lies a little to the west of south, and Salahiyah due north. To the north-east, at 2J miles is Taina- shimah village, 60 or 70 houses of Zanganah Kurds. To the east by north, at 3J miles, is Rahammarkah village, 10 houses of Zanganah Kurds. 10 SARCHAM . . 4 hrs. 29 mts. After 37 minutes through low hills, and never far from the bed of the stream from Salahiyah, we reached Sarcham, a temporary harvesters' village on the road. The Qaim-maqam of Salahiyah, Muhammad 'Ali, who is a brother of Mahmud Pasha, chief of the Jaf Kurds, met us here with about 20 mounted men. After 40 minutes riding we reached Salahiyah (or Kifri) After leaving Sarcham the way was chiefly over flat land, the hilly belt being left behind. Some cultivation, both irrigated and unirrigated, was noticed. Salahiyah consists, it is said, of about 800 houses; and it has a good bazar of about 80 shops. Hills arise immediately to?25 R oute N o . 201— contd. this point (Gharrah) the Biyat encampments to the left are more distant than before. 3 bd S tatiok (4 hrs. 40mts.) At about 14 miles Salahiyah we separated from our baggage caravan. So far as we had come on the way from Salahiyah there had been rocky hills accompanying the road on the right hand; these rose from 100 to 150 feet above the plain, and the fall of the strata of which they wore composed seemed to be from the side next the road back wards. On the left, all the way, had been meadows sloping down into the valley between us and Jabal Hamrin ; and a line of telegraph had followed the road closely on that side. At the point now reached there was a large village of Bij^at due south some miles off, and another south-south-west not quite so far away. The baggage continued along the road outside the hills and reached Tuz Khurmatu in 8 hours 20 minutes from Salahiyah, making the distance about 25 miles. About 5 miles before reaching its destination the baggage passed a Biyat village of 100 households, 2 miles to the left of the road, which was called Khasradalah. ABUSARKAL We ourselves turned into the hills on the right in search of some well -known oil springs, and found them at least after much wandering in a maze of rugged ridges and valleys. 1 here are about 7 borings altogether, situated on the two sides of a small ravine at a place called Abu Sarkal. By them stands a small tower for defence. At no great distance, in an open plain in the hills, were encamped two households of Xa aim Saiyids, whose head is Saiyid Muhammad-bin-Jasim. These people, who had been settled here for about 13 years, received us hospitably and guided us to the oil springs : without their help we should never have found them. While searching for the springs, before this, we came on some interesting rock dwellings, neatly cut in the faces of low cliffs. The springs are said to yield about 10 don key loads of oil daily, and the load sells for 2 shillings to 2 shillings and 4 pence at Tuz Khurmatu. The principal pit is about 15 feet in diameter and 25 or 30 feet deep, and the oil is brohght up in goat skins by men who clamber down for it.727 R oute N o . 201— contd&gt; Khurmatu-Dftquq track. Tuz Khurmatu is to the south-east from here. The Hamrin hills, as seen from here, fill the horizon from west to south -Avest. Just beyond this the hills on the right of the road, hereabout called Dawudiyah, converge towards the road and die away ; but mounds continue near the road for 3 miles further. (N. B.—Troops moving along the Khanaqin- Kirkiik road might be annoyed from the hills close to the road on its north -east side almost all the way from Khanaqin to the present station. The crossing of the Diyalah might also be made difficult.) At about 7 miles from Tuz Khurmatu the highest part of the ground is reached, ^t about 8 miles there is a mound on the right side of the roacf. At about 9 miles the bed of a stream called Khuri Chai is crossed; it is considered the half-way place between Tuz Khurmatu and Daquq. The name means ' dry stream,' but there were a few pools in the bed at which we watered our animals. Some half mile further on a second, Khuri Chai, about 100 yards wide, is encountered ; it is said to unite with the first a little further down (i.e., to the west.) 2 nd Station 3 hrs 40 mts. The second halting place was reached in two hours from the first. From it the mound at 8 miles from Tuz Khurmatu bears south-east; Daquq is to the north-west; and to the north-west by west is a fort of Namuk Agha, DawudTyah Kurd, by which 1,000 houses are said to be protected. 3 ed Station 4 hrs. 10 mts. Half an hour later a third halt was made, and Tu? KhurmStu was found to bear about south-south-east while Namiik Agha's village was to the west-south-west at or 3 miles distance. There are hills to the north-east, but they are now distant and not high. I th Station 5 hrs. After 50 minutes go ing the top of a long rise on the road is attained. Daquq lies ahead to the north-west by north, and Tuz Khurmatu behind to the south-south-east. To the east at 1 mile, is the village of Shorawah, consisting of 50 houses of Dawudiyah Kurds. To the west is a conspicuous mound, about 3 miles off ; a grove of trees lies somewhat nearer and a littlQ729 Route No. 201— contd. dAquq to kirkuk. {23rd April 1910.) DAQUQ •• Daquq consists of about 200 houses. A canal from the Chai runs through the village. 1 st Station (45 mts.) After | of an hour's going a considerable ridge is crossed, and from this point Daquq lies to the south by east. To the south west at or 3 miles distance, are three villages, to appearance small which are said to be the followingAbdul Ghanim (150 houses), Yangijah (60 houses), and Tappah (40 houses), all inhabited by Talabaniyah. 2 MATARAH ( and be - (1 hr. 55 mts.) In 70 minutes ginning of hills ). more a village of 50 or 60 houses of Arab Saivids on the left side of the road is reached. It is called Mata- rah in Kurdish and Ma'amarah in Arabic. On the right of the road are a graveyard and a conical mound. Daquq lies behind to the south-south-east. Just beyond the village a small shingly stream is crossed, and the road enters low hills. After 20 minutes an eminence is reached from which Ma'amarah bears south-south-east, by a very little south. There is another eminence after 23 minutes more from which Daquq lies a very little to the south of south- south-east. At 5 minutes beyond this second eminence, m the hills to the left, not far off, is the village of Shirinjah Bulaq, eonsistincr of 50 houses of Talabaniyah. About 25 minutes later a descent from the hills begins, and Kirkuk is seen lying about due north. After 12 minutes more the village of Zandanah, 70 houses of Arabs and Kurds mixed, is seen to the north-west by west at li&gt; or 2 miles distance. 3 E nd of Hills .. (3 hrs. 30 mts.)

The town of Kirkuk stands up boldly as one approaches it; part of it is built on a large hill which is probably artificial in spite of its size. The population of Kirkuk is estimated at 40,000 to 50,000 souls; and, out of 4,000 houses, 200 are said to belong to Jews and 200 to Christains. The exports are wool, gallnuts, wheat, barley, gum tragacanth, and a little wine. baba gurgur. {25th April 1915.) Baba Gurgur, which was visited during our halt at Kirkiik, is in some low hills a little to the right of the Kirkuk-Altun Koprii road at 4 or 5 miles from Kirkuk. The place itself is a slight hollow on some high ground; it is about 60 yards long and 20 yards broad, and there are some 20 vents of natural gas in it. At the time of our visit these were alight, as they generally are, unless artificially extinguished. If one of the vents be stopped with earth, the gas usually escapes at some other place near by, where it can be lighted with a match. A kettle can conveniently be boiled on any of the burning vents, and Baba Gurgur is said to be a favourite picnic place ^ in spring for the merchants and military garrison of Kirkuk. J here is a strong smell of sulphur about. .... A little further on in the same direction, but quite near the road, is a group of 4 or 5 oil pits called Biar (wells); they are the property of Salih Pasha, absent at Constantinople at the time of our visit, and are said to yield 8 donkey loads (say 32 tins) of crude oil daily. The pits are situated on a slight hill and are 12 to 15 feet deep. The water is separated from the oil at the wells and the oil is afterwards refined at Kirkuk. There is a sulphurous spring in the hills, a little further in than the oil PltS Closely adjoining the official suburb of Kirkuk on its north side on the way to Baba Gurgur, is the considerable village of Shatarli with about 200 houses. It has an old leaning minaret. At Kirkuk the date tree has already ceased to occur, and the olive has made its appearance. We are approaching the tem perate zone. Vines, limes, figs apricots, mulberries, willows, etc., are to be seen.733 R oute N o . 201— contd. which the road runs onwards in a north-north-west direction. The rocks hereabout are sandstone. 4 KHAN-AN-NAFT (2 hrs. After 20 minutes 27 mts.) more a ravine is cross ed where there is a water and a gendarmerie post (Nuqtah) called Khan-an-Naft. From here the road again turns to north-west by north. Five minutes before reaching this place was an encampment of 'Obaid Arabs, shepherds. 5 PAS • • • • (Say 3 From Khan-an-Naft hrs.) the roads runs in a generally north by west direction for IJ miles to the top of the second or inner ridge of hills. On surmounting this pass a magnificent view is suddenly obtained of a plain beyond, draining north-west to the Little Zab. In the distance are magnificent lines of mountains, some of which, when we saw them, were snow-covered. A dark- coloured mountain due north was pointed out as that overhang ing Shaqlawah, which we afterwards visited ; to the left of it, and not so far off, was a long hill of a reddish colour. Snow mountains, extending round from north by east to north-east, were said to be in the neighbourhood of Raniyah, To the east- north-east was a large mountain, also covered with snow, which was described to us as adjoining Sulaimaniyah. The following villages were observed from the pass To the north-east by east Kalwur, 30 houses of (Kalwur) Shawan Kurds. To the east-north-east DSraman-al-'Uliyah, 40 houses of Shawan Kurds. To the east by north Daraman-as-Sufla, 30 houses. The next stage is a descent from the pass to the broad valley beyond them ; and the next station is reached in about 40 minutes. 6 th S tation . (3 hrs. Kalwur village lies 40 mts.) | of a mile due north from here; and to the north-north-east, at 1,000 yards off the road, there is a conspi cuous mound. Ten minutes later Kalwur village is passed ; it lies J a mile to the right of the road. Ten minutes after Kalwur we arrive at another station.735 R oute N o . 201— contd. minutes further on, two small canals, spanned by small bridges, traverse the road. 9 th Station . (6 hours 3 mts.) From this place Kitkah or Kikkah, already mentioned, bears south west and is about 2 miles off. To the east-north-east, at about 1^ miles, is Saibirau, a village of 80 houses of Sawalih. After 20 minutes a broad depression without a stream is reached : it is followed by a stony ascent. After 15 minutes a small dry shingly ravine, called Wishkakhan in Kurdish and Qarah Chai in Turkish, is crossed. 10 th Station. (6 hours 53 mts.) In 15 minutes more a point is reached from which the whole way to Altun Koprti is down hill. From this point G5k Tappah is seen to the east-south-east. Due west is Zirgah Zirao, a mass of hills close to Altun Koprii on the further side of the Zab. Twenty-five minutes later the bridge which gives its name to Altun Koprii ' Gold Bridge ' is reached, and the town, which begins immediately at its further end, is entered. Altun Koprii (7 hours 18 minutes); but the baggage animals took 9i hours oyer this day's stage. The Lower Zab is divided at Altun Koprii into two branches, an eastern and a western, of which the former is the more con siderable. The main town, consisting of about 350 houses, is situated on the head of the island enclosed between them. The western branch dries up altogether after the spring floods ; and the eastern branch then becomes fordable above and below (but not at) the town. The main stream, when we saw it, was about 40 yards broad ; and the bridge, which is of one span, and very high and pointed, then rose about 50 feet above the water. This bridge, which is extraordinarily steep and difficult of ascent from both sides, is cursed by the muleteers of all the country side for killing their animals ; but the boys of the town enjov diving off it feet foremost. Ihe water under the bridge is said to be very deep. On the eastern side of the main stream is a detached suburb of the town called Mahallah Sulahi, which consists of about 70 houses of Arabs, Kurds, and others. On the west side of the western branch is another detached suburb, called Mahaljah, Tis'in, of about 70 hpuses of mixed736 Koute No. 201— contd. tribes. This suburb is connected with the main town by a bridge less remarkable than that over the main Zab. The two streams of the Zab re-unite about J of a mile below the place where they separate ; and a little below their junction, on the right bank of the river, is the small mixed Turkish and Arab hamlet of Kaiyabashi with about a dozen houses. Ka- yabashi lies nearly due south of the bridge over the main Zab. The direction of the river near the town is about north-east by north and south-west by south. In the whole town there are about 50 shops and one public bath. Trade is mostly in wheat and barley, which are exported and floated down the Zab and Tigris on rafts. There is an ex port, but small, of wool, and of timber brought by river from the hills. The inhabitants of Altun Koprii are mostly Turks, and Turkish is the prevailing language. (The settled Turks of this part of the country are Turkmans and are said to talk a Tur- komani dialect; they are not 'Osmanlls.) ALT I N KOPRt TO .. The road from Altun A R BIL. Koprii to Arbil runs at first, alter leaving the former place, up the valley of a small tributary of the Lower Ziab. This stream is called the Injesui. There are corn lands in the valley and low hills on either side. A bend on the Injesui was crossed at 28 minutes and another at 32 minutes from Altun Koprii, and a third was touched at about 35 minutes. There were at this time only a few inches of water in the stream. 1 st S tation . (48 mts.) In 13 miles more an eminence is reached, from which Altun Kop- rii bears about south-south-east. The Mosul road, which diverged from ours on entering the hills, is now seen about half a mile off to the westward. The telegraph to Arbll is also on the left-hand side of the road that we are following. Between us and the Musal road is a mill, and beyond that road is a hamlet called Makhsumah, consisting of 12 houses of Kurds. At 11 minutes beyond the first station the telegraph line (two wires) crosses from the left to the right of the road. In 18 minutes more we reach the second station at the top of a shingly ascent, just before which there is a dip into a hollow and a bend737 Route No. 201— contd. of the Injesui is touched. The valley of the Injesiii and the Masai road now disappear to the left. 2 nd Station . (1 hour 17 mts.) Altun Koprii still lies to the south-south- cast. To the west by south, at 1 mile, is the village of Shaikhan, 50 houses of Dizzai Kurds, apparently situated on the Musal road. All the Kurds hereabout are Dizzai. Arbil is invisible, but its direction is pointed out as about north by west. To the east, at li miles, is Saikhuchan, a village- of 20 houses of Kurds. (N. B. —The baggage took 2 hours 6 minutes to reach this station from Altun Koprii.) 3 rd Station. (1 hour 52 mts.) At 25 minutes further on the telegraph re- crosses from the right to the left of the road; and 10 minutes later high ground is reached, which does not, however, command any 'points worthy of observation. (N. B. —Stage between 2nd and 3rd stations was done along with the bag gage.) . , . 4 th Station . (2 hours 53 mts.) Thirty-nine minutes beyond the last sta tion a point is reached where a small stony hollow crosses the road from right to left; and 22 minutes later a second hollow of the same kind, but smaller, is encountered. This second hollow was taken as a station, but there were still no observation points. 5 th Station . (3 hours 11 mts.) In 18 minutes more high ground was reached and the follow ing places noted :— (N. B. —Stage between 3rd and 4th stations was done walking.) to the south by east, Altun Koprii ; to the south-west by south, at 1 mile, Dolar Saza. 40 houses of Dizzai Kurds ; to the south-west Bash Tappah, some whitish mounds in the bottom of a valley ; apparently on the Injesui ; to the south-west by west, at about 4 miles, Kazikhanah, 20 houses of Dizzai Kurds, beyond the Injesui. Oth Station (3 hours. 51 mts.) After 40 minutes there is a depres sion 100 yards across. Froni here the village of Hamzakor, 15 houses of Dizzai Kurds,739 R oute N o , 201— contd. There were also a number of more distant villages, and some black tents were seen scattered about. The road ahead appeared to run north by west. The country is a plain, or very wide valley, shut in by ranges of hills on the rit h t and left of the road which seem to run about north-west and south-east. These ranges must be about 20 miles apart. There is said to be no leading chief among the Dizzai Kurds ; but Ahmad Pasha, son of Husain Agha, is recognised by the Turkish Government as thair official head. This individual is said to live at a village on a long ridge about 10 miles west-south west of this place (Qush Tappah), near the Mosul road. Other prominent men among the Dizzais are Ibrahim Agha, son of Baiz, and Mahmud Agha, son of Kuka Khan, who resides at Girdmalah. 9 QARACHAN 7 hrs. 31 mts. The next station, AGHA TAPPA- Qaraehan* Agha Tap- , PACHI. pahchi, is 2 hours 45 minutes beyond that of QOsh Tappah. From it the following observations were taken to the south by east, the two last stations and Altun Kopru ; to the west by north at 2 miles, Timar, a village of 20 Dizzai houses ; to the east, at 1 mile, Qarachan Agha, a village of 25 Dizzai houses ; to the north by west, Arbil. (V. B.—For the stage ending at this station the time taken by the baggage has been adopted.) ARBIL .. 10 hrs. 6 mts. About 1 mile from the Qaraehan station a small stream was crossed, and immediately afterwards a little dry hollow ; near the latter, close to the right, was a village called Little Hamwarkah. We could not take observations from here to Arbil as a guard of honour had come out to meet us. (.V. B. —Time adopted for last stage into Arbil is that taken by baggage.) Arbil, like Kirkuk, stands partly on a huge artificial hill, of prehistoric construction, and makes a bold feature as it rites above the plain. It is in fact of more striking appearance ♦Perhaps ' Karachan.740 E ottte N o . 201— contd. than Kirkuk, the Foi't (or elevated part) l)eijig more compact, and the buildings in it of a better sort. From the Arbil Fort an old minaret lies to the west-south- west, just outside the town. To the south-east at miles is Badawah, a village of 50 houses of Dizzai Kurds. At Kirkuk we met Ibrahim Agha, the chief of the Dizzai Kurds. Arbil is said to consist of 1,800 houses of Turks and Kurds. The water of the town is all from ponds. The Q.aza yields a large surplus revenue, which is sent to Kirkfik. The land taxes are said to produce £T.90,000 a year, of which one -third is from lands formerly belonging to the Sultan's Civil List. The yield could be greatly increased by irrigation from the Zab. The entire way from Altun Kopru to Arbil we had fields of wheat and barley on both sides of the road ; , but not a single tree was to be seen. The harvest was an ex ceptional one. ARBTL TO SHAQLAVVAH. .. The road to Shaqlawah from Arbil runs at first across open plains. I BAIRKOD TAP- 52 mts. After 52 minutes Arbi^ PAH. lies to the south-west by south ; so does Bairkod village passed 5 minutes previously, on the west side of the road from Arbil. Bairkdd consists of 10 houses of Gardi Kurds. Between Bairkod and the station, just before reacing the latter, a small hollow descending from the right to the left of the road is crossed. T o the west, slightly north, a village is pointed out which is said to be Ain Qahwah, 300 houses of Oriental Christians, distant | of an hour by road from Arbil; this is no doubt the Ankowa ' of the War Office map. Somewhat west of south are the Qarah Chog hills, already obsen ed on the way from Kirkuk to Altun Koprii. As now seen they form two masses, of which that to the right is called Qarah Chog Harqi, and that to the left Qarah Chog Bulbadh. They are ^aid to be nine hours by road from Arbil. i o the east-north-east is the main peak of the long black range which was first sighted on the way Kirkfik to Altun741 R oute N o . 201— contd. Koprii : it is Safin. A nearer and loAver range bounds the plain of Arbil in the same direction and is called Dulopa. 2 nd Station . 1 hr. 26 mts. After 33 minutes the next station is reached. To the north- north-west, distant about | of a mile, in Pirzin, a village of 50 houses of Gardi Kurds. To the east-south-east, is Pi 'ash, a village of 40 houses of Dizzai Kurds. At the foot of the first hills to eastward are various temporary encampments of Gardi Kurds of the Zaid Baigi section. 3 rd Station . Ihr.lmts. Sixteen minutes more bring us to tne next station. About here Ave passed the baggage caravan, between two ravines ; it left Arbil at the same time as ourselves. 4 th Station . 2 hr. 16 mts. The fourth station was reached in oo minutes from the third ; it was a knoll situated amidst stony but more or less cultivated ground ; just before reaching it a small clear rivulet flowing over Lues was crossed. From here A ^.|f V OU iTh 7 S h west-north -west we see two masses of hdis beyond the/ab Piver that to the right of the line of vision is Maqlub that to the left Chazardak, and the latter is said to be 7 hours distant from where ^ The the east-north -east, at f of a mile, is Malla 'Umar, a village of 25 houses of Gardi Kurds. To the east, at 1 miles, is Shawak, a village of 2o houses of Gar To the 'lorth-north- east is the Galiyawah Pass, which will be mentioned again. 5 th S tation . (2 hrs.

The bed, about 80 yards wide, was stony. The largest channel was the first one crossed ; at the time it was only about 6 yards wide and the water 1 foot deep , but the flow of the current was very rapid. 8 th S tation . (4 hrs. The next station was 15 mts.) reached, 35 minutes after crossing the Bas- torah, by an ascending path. From it Saiwakah bore north by east and Donguzawah south by east, the former at i of a mile, the latter at J a mile, on opposite sides of our track. 9 th S tation . (4 hrs. Forty minutes walk- 55 mts.) ing uphill brings the traveller to another observation point. The surface of the track is rough, otherwise the ascent is not difficult. From this station Arbil lies to the south-west, but the nearer half of the road thence bears south west by south. To the south-south-west is Donguzawah village. T^sear by, to the leit of the road, is Saiwakah foit, a square stone erected with bastions ; it may be conjectured to have belonged, in times past, to robber barons who levied blackmail on the traffic over the passes between the plains and the hills. Hanarah Daghi, the range crossed before fording the Bastorah, has its highest point to the south, and dies away into the plains to the west-south-west. The Bastorah is seen to go westwards to the Zab River, which is also visible. There is a good spring in a hollow just above Saiwakah village. 10 th S tation . (5 hrs. In 21 minutes more 16 mts.) the top of the pass is , reached by walking- From it the peak of Safin bears about east at an apparent dis tance of 8 or 10 miles. Shaqlawah village is not visible, but its direction is pointed out as east-north-cast. Ahead is a white- coloured ridge with a notch in it to the left of east-north east, and through this notch appears a red range beyond,745 Route No. 201— contd. over, the rain still continuing, we were obliged by the approach of night to push on. After 10 minutes we reached the top ot a small pass, from which the I) fir band behind lay to the south- south -west, while the road ahead turned east in the direction oi Shaqlawah. Partly through heavy mud, partly over wet ground, Ave reached Shaqlawah in an hour and 20 minutes, without baggage and wet to the skin. Owing to variation of pace according to the nature of the road and the gathering dark, I cannot estimate the distance traversed in this time. The time of arrival of the weary baggage caravan which plodded for much longer through mud and darkness is also no criterion. _ , . (The topography of the War Office map beyond Karrai, no doubt '' Kora,'' seems to be conjectural. Shaqlawah village really lies on the northern, not on_ the southern, side of the Shaqlawah mountain ; and its position is, I should say, a good deal further to the east than that assigned to it the map. Moreover Shaqlawah mountain appears to be simply the highest peak of the Safin Range, not a separate range divided pices of the mountain. Magnificent clear springs burst from the hill side and water abundantly the orchards, vineyards, and woods which extend downwards from the village into a valley that passes across its front from west to cast. There arc 230 houses of Muhammadans (Kurds), loO of Chris tians (Chaldfean Catholics), and 5 of Jews. The Jews are wea vers ; the Muhammadans and (Christians are cultn ators am muleteers and also weave cloth. There are three Ghaldsean Catholic priests in the Christian community. Poplars are grown for the sake of the wood which they yield, and there are other large trees. I noticed 3 great planes (chinars) of which the smallest was 18 feet in circumference, also a mulberry with a girth of 13 feet. Cereals grown are wheat, barley, mash, and arzan ; there are also cotton, sesame and a little tobacco ; fruits include grapes, apples, pears and mulberries. There are 5 out mills worked by the water of the springs. Notwithstanding all these resources the place has a poverty-stricken appearance. from the latter by a great valley. SHAQLAWAH VILLAGE.

The place where we 46 mts. halt is the ruined village of Mir Rustam, which was accidentally destroyed by fire in the autumn of 1909. The present village is a little to the north-west, but we are as sured that the people will return before long to the former site. 4 KOIKAH .. 2 hrs. In half an hour an- 1 fi mts. other station is reached at Koikah, where the track crosses another ridge, and where there are the remains of a village deserted a year ago. The ovbservations are taken from a place 100 yards to the right of the road. Looking backward we see the crossing of the Mirawah ridge to the south-south west. To the south by east, is Shavaisiyah, a village of 10 houses of Mir Mahmali Kurds, and to the south-east by south is Shinawah, a village of 8 or 9 houses of the same ; wc passed these villages 10 minutes before reaching the station, 8havai- slyah being then 300 yards to the right of the road, and Shina wah in line beyond it and about 1,000 yards from the road. Both villages are under the Amir of Shaqlawah. From our present point of observation we see, slightly to the right of Shi nawah but about 2\ miles off, the village of Shaikh Mahmudi- yah, 60 houses of Mir Mahmali Kurds ; it seems to lie immedi ately under a hill which closes the upper end of the valley up which we are now looking. From that direction come two streams which close in to wards one another and again separate under the point of the ridge on which wc are now standing ; the nearer is called Sha vaisiyah, the further Shinawah. Due east, at 500 or 600 yards, is the village of Sisawah, consisting of 10 houses of Mir Mahmali Kurds. Northwards, beyond the streams, on the road by which we shall pass, is the village of Ari Sirak, 10 houses of Mir Mahmali Kurds. It is 20 minutes beyond the point where we now are. To the north-north-west, at about 1J miles, is M5trawah village, 30 houses of Mir Yiisufi Kurds. To the north-west by west, at some 2h miles, is Sursurah village, 30 houses of Mir Mahmali Kurds. There are some good fruit orchards hereabout. Since entering the hills between Arbil and Shaqlawah we have seen oak trees of two kinds. In many places they make up the greater part of the wooding. One of these is the ballut,748 R oute N o. ZOl—contd. which is not always easily recognisable, as its loaves vary great ly m colour substance, and even shape, from place to place' perhaps with the.r age or the age of the tree. The other is th* afas which yields the gallnut of commerce ; it resembles the •.ng ish oak, the leaves being scalloped and crimped at the edges while those of the ballut are serrated. cu g es . Above Shaqlawah there were tulips and primroses. To-dav our eyes have been gladdened by the sight of buttercups, dwarf- many, a kind of anemone, poppies, forget-me-not, English thist les, a ground convolvulus, and ground ivy. Some of the meadows are ablaze with flowers of one colour. There is almost -ill th* of m Engiish ^ ^ txtt We notice that the Kurds place wood which they have col lected on graves.

The mill belongs to Agha Baigi, an officer of Gen darmerie at Rowanduz. Near the mill is one house, also a ruin called Kalatu Sor, which is said to have been the stronghold of Sulaiman Baig, unoccupied since 40 or 50 years. Probably he was a Kurdish chief whose power was brought down by the extension of Turkish influence to the hills, as that of the Shaq- lawah Amir will bo brought down ere long. The ruin consists of square blocks of stone set in good mortar. To the north-north-east, three-quarters of a mile or one mile distant, is the village of Harir ; it lies just under the range of hills to which it gives its name, and it boasts of about 100 houses of Rowanduz Kurds. Our fcist station bears south-east or very slightly south of south-east. BATAS 4 hrs. 3 In 23 minutes, travel- mts. ling along the south west side of the ridge we have ascended, just below its crest, we reach Bat as, the end of this stage. It is a village of a hundred houses of Batas Surkhi Kurds. From here Harir lies to the east by south ; on the other side we overlook a fine valley descending and broadening as it goes, to the north-west; and Rowanduz is said to lie about north-east behind the Harir hills and other ranges. (Batas is probably a little south-east of the place marked '' Sinsira in the War Office map. Sheet 33.) BATAS TO ROWANDUZ. This was a hard day for men and animals. We started before dawn, yet the baggage did not reach Rowanduz till dark. Observations were postponed to the return journey, which is less difficult. I shortened the way by climbing over the Harir range, while the caravan went round by an easier route to the west. 1 he top of Harir, where I crossed it, was a pleasant table and called Morgah with pear trees in full bloom ; some hospitably disposed Kurds encamped on it supplied my party with milk, cheese, etc. On the other side I descended into a valley, parallel to the range, at the bottom of which was a fine rushing stream, follow ing which downwards I rejoined the baggage about the middle of the dav at a flat halting-ground called Cham-i-Khalfan,751 R oute N o. 201—contd. Rowanduz is the headquarters of a mountainous Qaza, said to contain 350 villages, nearly all Kurdish. The Qaim'- Maqam, when wc were there, was a Moslem Greek, the Qazi a Syrian from Latakia. The former did not know the name of his own Mai Mudiri (principal assistant), with whom he had been working for 14 months. There are about SO households of Jews similar to those of Rowanduz town, scattered over the outside villages ; and there are 3 or 4 entirely Christian villages. Rowanduz is a base for Turkish military action in Persia. At the time of our visit the Nizam infantry battalion by which it is ordinarily garrisoned was on field service against the Shaikh of Baraizan. The two Radlf battalions, probably nominal, of which Rowanduz was then the headquarters, had not been embodied. The local Jews were beginning to be conscripted for the army ; 16 had been taken for the Nizam and about 70 enrolled in the Ihtiyat. The principal man at Rowanduz is 'Abdullah Pasha, Kurd, a descendant of Muhammad Pasha, the last native ruler of Rowanduz. As 'Abdullah Pasha is now 60 years of age or more and does not remember Muhammad Pasha, the supersession of the latter's authority by that of the Turks must have occurred long ago. 'Abdullah Pasha is an agreeable old gentleman with considerable knowledge of the world, and full of local infor mation which he imparts with a readiness unusual in this country- he gave a quantity of data about local routes, etc., which are re produced in an annexure (Appendix B) to this report. He was in the Turkish service for many years as a civil Qaim-Maqam, and he combines the urbanity and trained intelligence of an official with some of the good qualities and advantages of a here ditary chief in his own country. His son Said Baig, who has a separate house, is arrogant and seems less intelligent than his father ; he too was in the Turkish service for a time, but had to leave it on account, it is said, of his having caused the death of a Turkish military officer. On the second day of our visit to Rowanduz I crossed the Rubal by the bridge, accompanied by the Mai Mudiri of Rowan duz, himself a Kurd, and climbed and explored the hi&lt;/h Zozik hill on the other side of the river. The ascent was made from a village named Goan, where there was great difficulty in obtain ing an inhabitant to act as a guide to the top. The Mai Mudiri752 R oute N o . 201— contd. pointed this out as a proof of how authority (his) had been weak- oned by the grant of the Constitution to me it appeared rather an instance of Kurdish laziness, ' constitutional' perhaps, but in a different sense. Goan lies a mile or two back from the Rubal up a small valley ; on the way to it after crossing the Rubal we passed a four-cornered bastioned fort, ruined, upon an eminence, which we were told had belonged to Muhammad Pasha, Kurd, the last of the great chiefs of Rowanduz. Up the same valley, about a mile above Goan, lies Diyanah, a small Christian village. On one part of Z5zik hill we found Kurdish villagers living in tents. It is their custom to camp out at this season for a month or so, partly for the sake of pasture, and partly to escape the fleas which now infest their houses. This day we heard the homely voice of the cuckoo, locally called bilbil. ROWANDUZ to ASHKAR. Before leaving our quarters, which were in the summer Sarai between upper and lower Rowanduz, the following obser ved :— To the north. —The valley of Garmuk running down towards us on the other side of the Rubal or River, to which it is tributary, with Dashtah Diyan behind it. North hy east. —The ruined fort of Muhammad Pasha, also beyond the Rubal. To the north-east.—The Z5zik hill, likewise across the river, 2 to 3 miles distant. To the east by north. —The valley of the Rubal above Row anduz, as it comes down from Riayat. To the east by south. —Hindarain, a big sloping hill, the most closely connected with Rowanduz, of the sur rounding mountains. To the south by west. —The Armushah hill; a valley coming down from the east between it and Hindarain is called D5laku. To the south-south-west. —Baijan, an isolated, very sharply pointed hill, divided by a cleft on either side from the hills next it. From south-west to south-west by west. —The Kurak hill. None of the above hills are many miles from Rowanduz, and some of them are quite high, Armushah, Baijan and Kurak753 'Route No. 201— contd. had snow on them when we saw them. Baijan has a striking ap ran 00 q ar d a q a r d .. 25mts. In 25 minutes, mov ing with the baggage, we reach the pass, called Gardagard, from which the road descends into Rowanduz town ; this is the way by which we arrived also. Far off, to the north, are the high snow hills of the Baradost district. To the north-east is Zozik, with Sari Hasambak, a bold conical mountain, showing over its left flank. To the east is Hindarain. At the head of the Dolaku valley, which, as seen from here, comes from south-east and turns north, is a mountain named Sari Sawusiwokah. The highest visible point of Kurak is to the west-south-west at about U miles distance. North west, about U miles off, is a hill, Balakyan, just above the Gall or gorge of the Rowanduz Rubal and just beyond it. Leaving Gardagard we descend into the Kanijuz ravine or valley, which we must cross; there is a stream at the bottom of it, which appears to be the drainage of the east and north-east faces of Kurak. The Kanijuz valley opens, through a gap on the right of the road, into the gorge of the Rowanduz Rubal, which is near. The descent to the bottom may be 300 feet, and it is steep; but the going is good. The ascent on the other side is greater, perhaps 400 feet, and the path is bad; part is very rocky or stony, and in places it consists of dis* integrated shaley rock. 2 DARAKASAB .. Ihr. In 59 minutes we 24 mts. reach the pass on the other side, called Dara- kasab, a shoulder of Kurak; but the baggage takes an hour and forty minutes to get there from Gardagard. Balakyan, across the Rubal, now appears to lie 2 miles to the north ; and to the north-north-west is a hill named Garwai- biran. ^ , , 3 rd S tation . 1 hr. 39 mts. Quarter of an hour beyond Darakasab we attain a command- inff point, from which we can look both up and down the Rowan duz Rubal valley, or rather gorge, as well as right over to Balak yan.765 R oute N o . 201— contd. 6 th Station . 3 hrs. 47 mte. In 18 minutes w« are just entering some hills on our right. Looking backwards, we see Khalifan village about three quarters of a mile off to the south-south-east while the head of the 'All Baig Gali, or gorge, lies to the east-north-east at about 1 mile. Just after leaving this station we pass a Kurdish graveyard and fine grove of oaks. 7 th Station . 4 hrs. 11 mts. In 24 minutes, ascending a valley by which a tributary comes down to the Khalifan stream, we reach a point quarter of a mile south of the village of Khan-i-Batman. The village consists of 20 houses ; the people are Kurds of no particular tribe. Behind us the last station is visible to the easth-north-east. 8th Station. 4 hrs. 36 mts. We halt again, after 25 minutes, and note that Kurak mountain now lies east of us, and that the general direction of our course since leaving Cham -i-Khalifan has been from east-south-east to west- north-west. t . , i Five minutes beyond the 8th station we cross a watershed and find ourselves in the basin of a valley which, instead of woing down eastwards, runs westwards between us and the Harlr range on the south. In 23 minutes more we pass a vil lage above us on the right, about half a mile off ; it is Kalakin, consisting of a dozen houses of Surkhi Kurds. Three mmutes further on we cross a brook which runs down from the north on its way to join the stream at the bottom of the valley on our left; the stream, after receiving the brook, turns away leftwards from our road down a gorge. Six minutes later we halt. 9 th Station . 5 hrs. 13 mts. At this station the direction of our journey is still to the west-north west, and Kurak is now to the east by south. On this stage we have crossed two or three small rivulets besides the brook mentioned ; and ever since we left Khalifan there have been frequent springs spoiling the road. The hills among and over which we have been passing have been well wooded with leafy oaks of both sorts (Ballut and Afas),R oute N o . 201—cqiM. tho gap there was a small hamlet (Ashkaftu, 7 houses of Surkhl Kurds). A few minutes' descent brings us out on a grassy but stony plain, where we encamp close to the half dozen tents of Ahmad Agha, a Surkhi Kurd. The place is called Ashkar, which name is said to mean ' cave.' The Shaqawah hills are visible, bearing about south by east, and the gorge by which the Zab River issues from the mountains is to the north-north-west, one or two miles distant. This gorge reminds one of the opening by which the Indus makes its final exit from the hills at Kala- bagh and the general lie of the country is not dissimilar. ASHKAR TO KANDIL We intended to cross FERRY. the Zab without going further down its bank than necessary, and to make for ' Aqrah, then a centre of political interest because of the operations in progress against the Shaikh of Baraizan. We accordingly made for Kandil, which is marked in the War Office map. One and a half hours, at a foot pace brought us to Kandil; it was a continuous descent, first over stony hills, then over grassy downs, and finally over rich meadows of white clover. There were numerous springs, on the way down, making the ground soppy. At 35 minutes from the start, at about the steepest part of the descent, wc passed Barzin, a village of 20 houses of Surkhi Kurds. 1 KANDIL 1 hrs. 30 mts. Kandil itself is a group of 4 or 5 houses of Surkhi Kurds, with a fruit gar den containing figs, vines, etc. The meadows about were full of black tents, and ploughing was going on. At Kandil the exit of the Zab from the hills lies north-east; on the east side of its gorge stands the high Galaizai hill, on the .west Baixat, stiU higher. ' . • ■ ; 2 FERRY. 1 hr. 53 mts. ' The ferry was not at KandTl at this time but a mile or so below. To reach it we move along cliffs formed by a projection of the higher downs. At 8 minutes from Kandil we cross a small stream runn.ng down a gully to the river. In 23 minutes from Kandil we reach the crossing place.

Darkness fell before our destination was reached. Our road lay, for the first two hours after leaving the Zab, over gravelly conglomerate hills covered with grass and clover. The path generally wounda long watersheds between complicat ed valley systems, all apparently draining to the Zab ; it was steep and narrow in places, but there was no difficulty in getting the horses along. At 1 hour 15 minute from starting we found our route con verging on a range which seemed to be a continuation, on this side the Zab, of the Harir hills. At 1 hour 25 minutes we saw to our right, on the outer slopes of this range the village of Siisnawah (30 houses of Surchi Kurds), At 2 hours 35 minutes we passed the ruins of a castle, on our right; it was described at the castle of Ahmad Agha. Jscar it is the village of Qalati (60 houses of Surchi Kurds), of which the headman is, or was, Muhammad Mahmud Agha. At 2 hours 50 minutes the village of Gulsair (50 houses of Surchi Kurds), is on the hills to our right For the last hour, or hour and a half, the track has been running up and down across valleys with small clear streams. At 3 hours 30 minutes we reach the wooded valley or ravine of Bijil, which is crossed on a narrow stone bridge without para pets. Immediately beyond the bridge, above the road and on the right, is part of the village of Bijil, viz., about 40 houses of Siirchi Kurds. ■ • j • • i j • At 4 hours 5 minutes we reach Bijil proper ; it is divided into two parts by a great ravine in which is a waterfall. On the east side of the village, that first reached is a smaller ravine with si water-mill in s* ca/vc.

There are 80 hosuses of Surchi Kurds here ; the owner of the place is Shaikh Muhammad Bijil, who lives at 'Aqrah and owns here a long low Qasr, with two tiers of loopholes, on the top of a rock on the west side of the large ravine. The houses of the place are piled up one above another upon the hill Gide. At 5 hours 5 minutes, we reach Zinta village, 15 houses of Surchi Kurds. Just beyond is a tremendous cleft iu tho hills on the right, from which a stream emerges ; this is Gali Gibair.760 rottte'no. 201— contd. Ten minutes beyond the village we cross the stream ; it is about 1 ) yards wide and a foot deep ; the water is pale green and clear. At 5 hours 45 mmutes Jodah, a village consisting partly of caves, is seen to the right; here are some 15 houses of Surchi Kurds. It is getting dark now, and the road is wild and lonely At about 7 hours we reach 'Aqrah, after painful stumbling about m a deep gully with dark gardens and a rushing stream of unknown depth, which we eventually succeed in crossing. ,, . j8 stony ascent from the gully brings us into the town. If we had been a few minutes later we should not have found our way into Aqrah this night. We are received by 'Ali Niyazi Bey the Qaim-Maqam, a native of the Hauran (Syria), who has been a year here. AQRAH .. There are said to be about 1,000 houses in 'Aqrah v a u i. prw * ™ , an ^ these are mostly of Kurds, but 50 of Chaldtean Catholics and 10 of Jacobites are included, also some 20 of Jews. The Christians are blacksmiths, joiners, and artisans ; the Jews are traders and weavers. The place is poor ; a regular hill village, but a large one.

In the plain to the westward the light is reflected from numerous collections of water; the whole of this lush plain seems to ooze with water, yet not to be marshy. A European prospector for liquorice root from Messrs. MacAndrew and Forbes Company's Baghdad branch is encamped before us at Badarash. v T ™ • x 1 bardarash to MOSUL. (20 mts.) In 20 minutes after leaving Bardarash we reach the top of the ridge, called Jabal Zirg Bardarash, on which it is situated ; this ridge runs to the Zab River. From here the position of Aqrah is about north-east; and in the northern hills, about north, is a deep gorge like the letter V, known as Bazai, which seems to be the exit of some river. Jabal Maqlub is now to the west and a reddish hill called Kani Zardak to the south -west. 2nd S tation. (1 hrs. One hour and ten 30 mts.) minutes after leaving the top of Zirg Bardarash we arrive at the left bank of the Khazir river at the village of Katisi (20 houses of B5t Kurds). Jabal Maq ub lies north west ; Kani Zadrak south-west. The ford of the Khanzir is a little above the village; at the time of our visit the stream was 50 yards broad and in places as much as 3 feet deep, with a air y strong current; we were told that the river at this neither high nor low. The Khazir here comes from the north through a breach between Jabal Zirg, Bardarash and Jabal Maqlub; below Katisi it circles round to the sQuth-west. _ At 1 mile to southward, on cliffs on the left bank oi the Khaz , is Dusarah, a village of 50 houses of Bot Kurds. About 20 minutes before reaching Katisi we crossed ravine with a small stream in it. Beyond this point there w ^cu i-va- tion of wheat and barley. Thus far the road from Bardarash has not been very good, and we have ridden at a walk. &lt;. RD S tation. (1 hrs.

We reach the river at Mosul in about an hour from Gogjali ; but we travel faster in this last stage. Before passing Nabi Yunas, among the ruins of Nineveh, we cross an outer gravelly ridge, a hollow, a central ridge, and an inner ridge; these great ridges lie parallel to one another and seem artificial—perhaps connected with the ruins of Nineveh. The river is high and, in order to get at the bridge, we have to flounder on our horses througli some deep water. The stone bridge does not reach to the Mosul bank, but is supplemented at that end by a bridge of boats. Oa the present tour there have been frequent crossing of streams and rivers, but nowhere has a respeo^able bridge been met with except that at Khanaqln which was not constructed by the Turkish Government. The greatest need of this part of Turkey is better communications ; it is greater than the need of admin istrators, troops, or even money. Mosul.

' embarked at Mosul, below the bridge, we passed Yanmj ah on the left bank (150 houses of Turkmans Kurds, and Shi'ah Arabs). Yarimjah is U hours from Mosul by land. 2 At 1 hour 9 minutes we pass Al Bii Saif and a &lt;?asr (walled enclosure) called Sairauun, on the right bank ; here are GO houses of Jibur Arabs The qasr belongs to the Jalil Baigs of Mosul Down to this place there has been cultivation on both banks • and there have been low hills, not far inland from the right bank' which now approach closer to the river. tt ^ * h&lt; ™ r 31 minutes the 'ver divides'round an island called Hawijah Shamsiyat. On the left bank are the villages of Shamsiyat, upper and lower, each about 100 houses of Jibur Araos; the upper village is opposite the upper end of the island the lower 1- of a mile down. The island itself is about J a mile long. The low limestone hills on the right bank continue near the river. At 1 hour 57 minutes is Al Bu Juwari on the right bank, half a mile inland consisting of 50 houses of Jibur. About ^ of a mile before this was another right bank village, lying back on some highish lulls and not seen in passing.

On the right bank, opposite, is Lazzaqah (50 houses of Jibur Arabs). There is also a conspicuous fort belonging to the Baigs of Mosul. Here the hilla on the nght bank recede from it considerably.769 K oute N o . 202— contd. At 2 hours 32 minutes the river changes its direction from south to south -south-east, and hills begin on the left bank and run along it. Near the first hill, called Hamiru, a strong smell of sulphur pervades the air. On the right bank opposite, or a little further up, and 1 mile inland is 'Araij (70 houses of Jibur Arabs). The hills on the right bank are now nearly 2 miles inland. On the right bank, o. a mile down from where we are and some distance inland, is Qabr-al-'Abd (13 houses of Jibur), On the left bank, I of a mile below us, is Safij (25 houses of Jibur. 1 on the hills on that side. An island on the right side of the channel begins between ' Araij and Safij. The right bank hills appear to be limestone, the left bank hills at first conglomerate, changing later to limestone or sand stone. At 2 hours 48 minutes we reach the lower end of the island. At 2 hours 57 minutes the left bank village of Hawi Arsalan is passed (15 houses of Jibur) ; it is situated at the water's edge below hills. There are islands now on both sides of the channel. At 3 hours 13 minutes, on the left bank, is Little Hamairah (50 houses of Jibur). Here the river turns to south-west. At 3 hours 22 minutes is Great Hamairah (70 houses of Jibur) on the left bank, \ a mile inland ; it belongs to one 'Abdul Jalil of Musal. The river is still going south-west. Here the hills retire from the left bank, leaving an alluvial stretch. At 3 hours 31 minutes is the landing place, on the right bank, for Hammam'Ali, which is 4^ hours by land from Miisal. It is at the lower end of a right bank island and is marked by two dome- shaped hills ; the larger of these, about 100 feet high, is called Tall-as -Sabat. To the west by north, at 300 yards, is one Hammam 'Ali village, to the north by west at 500 yards ia another; the former consists of 50 houses of Lihaib and Al Bu. Hamadi Arabs, the latter of 20 permanent houses inhabited by miscellaneous Muhammadans and 7 or 8 shops. Five islands are in sight, 3 upstream and 2 down ; and here the channel shifts from the left to the right bank of the river. The site of Nimrud and the Qarah Chogh hills are in line to the south-east. The Musal- Baghdad road passes through Hammam 'Ali. We visited the hot springs of Hammam Ali, which have a great reputation ; people come from as far as Zakho in the north, Kirkuk and Sulaimanlyah on the east, and Baghdad in the770 Route No. 202— contd. south to take baths here. There are said to be 10,000 visitors in a season ; the season is from the middle of June to the middle of September. The course is one of 3 baths per diem, lasting 10 to 30 minutes each, and continues for 40 days. The visitors inhabit mud huts and temporary shelters (Arlsh), paying £T 1 or 2 as rent for each for the period of the course. 'The water in the springs, which are built over, is of a dirty green colour, has a bituminous scum floating on the surface, and smells strongly of sulphur. Daring the season a municipality (haladiyah) is cansbitutjd. Two Iic0ns3d coifea shops here bring in £T. 200 a saason, and the bitumen yielded by the springs is collected and fetches about £T. 20. At 22 minutes after leaving Hammam 'Ali, where we have spanb | of an hour, we pass Salahlyah (3:) houses of Jibur) on the right bank. At about 36 minutes, on the right bank, is Jahainah (100 houses of Jibur). The Jibur hereabouts are Jibur-al-Wawi. At 53 minutes, on the left bank, partly on the river bank and partly at some distance behind a hill, is Salamiyah, GO houses of lurksmans and Jibur Arabs. At 1 hour 16 minutes we reach the first 'Awayah or rapid which we have to pass on our way to Baghdad. The river is too high to disclose the nature of the object forming it, and it give? n^ trouble. There are again hills close to the^ht bank. At 1 hour 23 minutes comes, on the left bank, NSifah (50 houses of Jahaish), the landing place for the Nimriid site. The left bank is low, shelving and gravelly; on the right bank there are stony lulls. There is a raft ferry here. 1 he chief mound at XimrTid, which wo visited, is situated a jout ' miles east-south-east of Naifah ; there are fine crops of ripe barley all the way thither. From the mound we see to the west, at about U mil:*?, the village of Nimrad (150 houses of hhammattah and Jibur). Camps of Wawi and Jahoni are visible to the west across the Tigris. In 3 hours we are under way again, and in 25 minutes we pass a rapid known as 'Awayah Sakhr JVfunairah. - t 35 minutes a ravine called Wadi Jahannam comes down o u uver on the right bank immediately below a small island, smiiar y named, near the same bank. Not far from this point, on u eft bank, we saw the village of Saiyid Hamad, consisting \771 'R oute N o . 202— contd. of 60 houses of 'Ajl Jibur and Jahaish. It is near the river, but au island called Haw!jat-al-Hisan intervened between it and us. At 67 miutes we passed a village called Sanadiq, 10 houses of Jibur, on the right bank. The name Sanidiq (' Boxes ') is given to a series of square-topped mounds on the right bank between this point and the Makhlat or confluence of the Great Zab and Tigris, and there may be other villages called after them besides this one. From Hammam 'Ali to Sanadiq there are no hills on the right bank. At 1 hour 15 minutes another rapid is passed, but at the present high level of the river it hardly extends to the left bank. There is au island hero dividing the river into two ; we follow the north -eastern side of it; the south-western channel also contains a rapid. Just below this place there are considerable rock cliffs on the right bank of the river, rising in places to 20 or 30 feet! At 1 hour 30 minutes, comes the village of Umm-al-'Asafir, 1 omitted to note on which side of the river it was. It is in two parts of almost equal size, divided by a gully, each containing 20 to 25 houses of Wawi Jibur. At 1 hour 37 minutes on the left bank is Jaifah, a village o( Jibur. There are some 10 houses near the river, and 100 more are said to lie less than a mile inland. Here the direction of the river changes from south-east to south-west. At I hour 48 minutes there are sunken rocks near the right bank making broken water. There is an island just above this, and from about here a rocky clift runs along the right bank for perhaps a mile. At 1 hour 55 minues the river divides round a green island, to the right of which our raft passes. On the right bank there are bold rocky cliffs perhaps 150 feet in height. At 2 hours 4 minutes the end of the island is reached ; and to the east, at about 2 miles distance, we see a mound called Kashaf, which is said to be on the south side of the Great Zab. At 2 hours 10 minutes we reach the Makhlat or confluencs of the Great Zab with the Tigris : there is nothing remarkable about it. Just inside the mouth of the Zab is an island ; and Tall Kashaf appears to be situated on the proper left bank of that river some 2 or 3 miles up it. (On enquiring about ferries over the Great Zab we are told that there is a ferry-boat at Quwair about 2 hours from Makhlat, and another at Kilik772 R oute N o . 202— contd. 4 hours above Quwair). On the Tigris, just below the Makhlat, there is something approaching a rapid ; and at the tail of this there is a ferry with a small boat. At 2 hours 16 minutes we pass the village of Makhlat ; it is on the right bank and consists of about 20 houses of 'Ajl Jibur. The village is immediately followed by a gravel island, and our raft takes the left hand channel. In this channel we descend the biggest rapid we have yet encountered. From here to Duwaizat, a place about a mile further on, low and insignificant cliffs follow the left bank ; they seem to be of different kinds of stone, mostly a conglomerate. At 2 hours 26 minutes there are sunken rocks at the left bank, making troubled water. At 2 hours 37 minutes we reach Duwaizat, a village of 50 houses of Jibur on the left bank. Opposite to it, on the right bank, is Talui-ash-Shok, :50 houses of Jibur. A small island has its head between these two villages, and on both sides the banks down stream appear low. The average width of the Tigris stream thus far, as has been perhaps 200 to 250 yards ; much greater breadths will hereafter be met with. At 2 hours 55 minutes the river, here about 500 yards broad, again divides ; wo take the loft hand channel. Immediately afterwards we see on the left hand, about f of a mile inland, the village of Hasan Tashqal, 100 houses of Jibur. At 3 hours 3 minutes, after the island on our right has ended, is Manqubah, a village of 25 houses of Jibur. Two minutes later cliffs again appear within about half a mile of the right bank, and the Qarah Ch jgh hills show up to the east bv south. At 3 hours 9 minutes we pass the important village of Tall- ash-Sha ir on the left bank. It consists of about 200 houses of Jibar Arabs, and there are some 20 shops. The mud houses here, and in this part of the country generally, are like small European cottages with gable roofs. There is no Turkish official at iall-ash-Sha'ir, only an Arab Shaikh who is responsible for the safety of rafts passing this way, and who collects a due of 1 to 1|- Majidis from each. Tall-ash-Sha'ir is a river port from wnich grain bought at Shamamak is shipped. This grain tormerly went to Musal, but now goes to Baghdad; I presume that it comes from the plain of Arbll. It is stated that in an ordi nary year about 1,000 Kiliks, carrying 12,000 tons of grain, leavR0 R oute N o . 202— contd. Tall-ash-Sha'ir for Baghdad; about fa of the quantity is said to be wheat and -fb barley. At 3 hours 25 minutes we pass the deserted site of lamman on the right bank, which here again inclines to be high and bold. On the left bank is the village of Sultan 'Abdullah, consisting of 50 to 60 houses of Jibur. At 3 hours 38 minutes there is an island on our right with large Gharab (Eurphrates poplar) trees. At 3 hours 55 minutes Zawiyah is left behid on the right bank, it is a settlement of 'Ajl Jibur, composed of 50 permanent house^ and about 200 tents. ^ At 4 hours 3 minutes Makuk, a village of 100 houses of Jibur about 2 miles inland from the left bank, was said to be opposite us ; and at 4 hours 27 minutes Khabbatah, a village of 50 houses of Jibur occurs on the left bank. At 4 hours 53 minutes we reach what we take to be the landing place for the Qaiyarah bitumen springs and tie up; there are cliffs on the left bank and a low gravel island near the right bank. The place, however, proves to be the wrong one, and we go on for 10 minutes more to a spot where there is a considerable encampment of Jibur on the right bank. We thus take 5 hours and 3 minutes from Nimrud to Qaiyarah, or (3'31 + 1 '26+5■3 = ) 10 hours in all from Musal to Qaiyarah. QAIYARAH. Before continuing our voyage towards Baghdad wo paid a visit to the Qaiyarah bitumen springs and oil refinery. These lie about 2 miles inland from the place on the right bank where our raft finally halted. At 20 minutes from the river an oilv stream is crossed; at 30 minutes an old Qasr or fortified enclosure is passed; and at 35 minutes the new oil works are reached. The bitumen springs are situated in the beginning of some low hills, where they form an* expanse of bitumen, irregularly shaped, with an average diameter of about 100 yards. The surface'is all bitumen, in places hard, in places viscous, in places soft: and there are oozings, here and there, of sulphurous water. The 'bitumen is collected soft in the open watery spots and packed in skins; what is taken away during the day replaces * This expanse may be compared to a lake of inky water covered with jet black lee.m R oute N o . 202— contd. iteelf m the night. The crude bitumen sells at the springs for half a Beshlik per skin pf about 40 lbs., or approximately 8 lbs for a penny. J The oil produced here is distilled from crude bitumen of the consistency of stiff treacle. Twenty tins of bitumen yiled 10 tins of oil of which 2 are of the first quality, 2 of the second, and (&gt; of the third The lirst quality is colourless, the second yeUo^v, and thethird black; and the third quality must be refined a second time before it is fit for any purpose except anointing camels agamst mange, but more bitumen is mixed with it before 10 ] IS + u a 10 ''i ' !' e ^ lle ^ use ^ ^ or distillation is crude bituiben ; and the residue left in the retort is bitumen, and is allowed to dX^Th I™' 4 ?. t0 5 ? tinS of oil arc billed at Qaiyarah daily.

Here the lulls retire from775 R oute N o . 202— contd. the left bank, but 14 minutes further on low conglomerate cliffs appear on the right bank, with something similar on the left bank opposite. • i . t i „,, i At 36 minutes Wadi-al-Massal comes m on the right bank ana brings some water to the river ; it appears that it does not come from Qaiyariyah, as might be supposed. At 49 minutes there is broken water due to rocks. At 55 minutes the village and mound of Hajj 'A1 are paBsed ; I omitted to record ou which side of the river they lay. Ihe village consists of 25 houses of Jibur. The mound looks artificial and there are marks of digging in it; below it was a considerable Arab encampment. . . , , , At 1 hour 4 minutes is Tall-ar-Raqubah on the right bank; it is a conglomerate mound about 50 feet high. At 1 hour 17 minutes is the right bank village of Ma tuq, -0 houses of Jibur, with an island in front of it. The bank is com- paratively low hereabout. Just after this cliffs of mud, conglo merate, rocks, etc., begin on the left bank; they are called Chahalah. . . . \t 2 hours 32 minutes, the cliffs having ended some time before this, we reach the left bank hamlet of Qan'iis, 5 houses of Jibur. A little below it, on the same side, is a mound bear- ine the same name. . , , At 4 hours 2 minutes rocky bluffs topped with conglomerate begin on the right bank : these are called Jabal Mataq. At 4 hours 45 minute's, some time after the bluffs have receded from the right bank, we are opposite the village of fakil-al- Aqr on the left bank. Here is a ferry called Ma 'bar-ash-Sharqat, with one boat. There are only 7 houses of Jibur at this place. The mounds from which it takes its name are 22 minutes further on. At 5 hours 42 minutes we reach Sharqat. Just above it a hollow called Wadi-ash -Shababik comes in on the right bank. SHARQAT. -^t Sharqat we were hospitably received and shown over the excavations by the German archceological staff. The ancient site of Sharqat is a steep hill on the west side of the Tigris, v iaic i it overhangs.776 R oute N o. Wl- conUl. Ihe rums go back to early Assyrian times, viz., about 2,000 V' but earlier relics of the bronze and even of the stone ace arc found under them. A Parthian palace and a poor Parthian town existed on the same site in later times, and there are Muhammadan remains dating from about 1200 A. D. Sharqat possessed one of the great towers dedicated to superior divinities of which only two others are known to have existed in Assyria, mz., those of which the traces remain at Nimrud and Khorsabad. I he only possible indications of ancient foreign relations dis covered are, we were informed, some metal articles which may be from Cyprus and some objects of ivory. With reference to Ihe last it may be noted that elephants existed on the Khabur not very far from here, in early times. The Sharqat excavations are managed by a Committee con nected with the Berlin Museum ; and the funds are provided, in part at least, by the Prussian Government. It is not known how long the work will be continued. Excavation work is not congenial to archaeologists ; it is therefore carried on here by agents who are primarily architects or engineers, and most of the deciphering of inscriptions is done in Germany. I gathered that the early British explorers of this and other sites had been very successful in finding and removing most of the striking articles of interest, and that attention is now chiefly concentrated on disentangling the foundations, and working out the ground plans, of the buildings of different periods, inscribed bricks, etc., are also found which yield some information. The ruins are so completely flattened out that nothing can be known from lem regarding the roofs of the ancient houses, etc. After a three hours' halt at Sharqat we resumed our journey. At about 27 minutes some low bluffs on the right bank, which have their beginning a little below Sharqat, become high and cliffy ; eventually they attain perhaps 150 feet. They are part of wnat is called Jabal Mak-hill. . n ^ utes we came on two rocks projecting out of the river m mid-channel; the water was breaking over them. hey are called Abu Sharib. The left bank is pretty high hereabouts, of mud and conglomerate. At 1 hour 33 minutes the hills retire again from the right bank lour minutes later a low verdant strip, known as Shati- al-Jidr, occurs on the left bank.777 R oute No con^. At 2 hours 3 minutes is a rock near the left bank, called Sakhr- an-Namal. At present it is submerged and invisible, hut m summer it stands 5 or 8 feet out of the water. Steep clay banks have begun on the left, and stony hills are again approaching the river on the right. At 2 hours 17 minutes was a rock, harraj, making rough water near the right bank, which here is high and liroken. There was some talk about rapids, and it seemed to be the opinion of our boatmen that only* those of Jahainah and Sanadiq were due to artificial obstacles in the river ; at both of these places they said, cut stones and building work are visible when the river is low. Jahainah is the more complete of these two constructions, each of which has a passage for rafts through the middle of it. The boatmen opined that they were sills made by Nimrud to raise the level of the river near his town, and it would seem natural to suppose that they were dams of some sort rather than bridges. At 2 hours 30 minutes there was a mound with an Arab encampment near the left bank. The place is called Qubbat-al- Hadldi, but we saw nothing suggesting an ' iron dome. This reach of the river is called Jabaih. i x*- , At 2 hours 51 minutes we reached the Qal at-ai-Bmt or ' Maiden's Castle,' which stands on the right bank at a sharp bend of the river, here only 150 yards broad, oiieven less. J ho gun had set, and it was growing dark, so we passed on without landing. The castle is remarkably situated on an isolated rock and commands two reaches of the river, looking up the one and down the other. We could distinguish what appeared to be a masonry bastion and part of a curtain, the latter loop-holed at the top. . . , . . At 3 hours 0 minutes there was a sound of rushing water towards the left bank, but the boatmen denied the existence here of any 'awayah or real rapid. The place was called 1 raishah. At 3 hours 31 minutes Began on he left bank a permanent camp of the Jibur, called Hawi Dindi, said to be an hour's walk in lenght, and to extend from this point to the junction of the 'They now said that these were only true 'awdyahs or rapids on ths riverr —J. G. L.779 @ 9 Koute No. 202— contd. A khan called Kharnunab, [on tjie Baghdad-Musal road, is said to lie inland from the right bank hereabonts perhaps tvo miles off. All this morning we have been passing islands between us and the right bank. They are grown over with tamarisk and harbour francolin. At 3 hours 25 minutes a conspicuous object known as Qal 'ah Raiyash is seen on the right bank. It consists, according to our informant?, of masonry remains ; and it is situated on the top of rocky cliffs which, having began 2 or 3 miles further back hp, re approach the right bank. On the left bank, nearly opposite are encampments of the Al Bu 'Ali tribe. At 4 hours 40 minutes there are camps of the Jibur Arabs on the right bank abreast of us and also downstream. At 5 hours 30 minutes steep conglomerate cliffs called Jabal 'Ajzau, rising to as much as 80 feet, adjoin the right bank; they have already accompanied it for some distance, say 2 miles. Five minutes further on a low strip of land known as Hftwi Mataridah begins on the right bank between the cliffs and the river, Avhile the left bank opposite is cultivated and goes by the name of Moh-al-Hisan. (M5h is said to bo another name for the vegetable also called Lubiyah.) At 5 hours 5H minutes wo reach a locality ou the left bank styled Tall-as-Suq where there are ruins on land, and in the water rocks said to be uncovered in the low season. A little further on there is an island in the river. On the right bank the hilla continue : they are said to be all one range from Kharininah to Tikrit and beyond, but opposite Hawi Mataridah their name changes from Jabal 'Ajzau to Jabal Sa'luah. At 6 hours 10 minutes we reach the end of Hawi Mataridah, and conglomerate cliffs on the right bank come down to the water's edge. At 6 hours 35 minutes the right bank is called Qaim, and its high cliffs are of mud and conglomerate. On the left bank the date palm, long unfamiliar, reappears. At 6 hours 45 minutes we arrive at Tikrit, the reputed birth place of the great Saladin, whose tomb is at 'Damascus. Here we again see in the river the quffah, a round basket-work coracle smeared with bitumen, which is one of the most characteristio objects of tho Baghdad country.780' v R oute N o. 202—contd. TIKRIT .. Tiki it stands on the right bank of the Tigris on conglomerate cliffs, which at the middle of the town rise to a height of 50 or 60 feet. The left, bank opposite is low ; and a t the time of our visit the river appeared 500 to 600 yards broad, but on the Tikrit side it was shallow, people wading out as much as 100 yards from the shore. The frontage of the town on the river is 400 or 500 yards. The place has about 950 houses and is the headquarters of a Mud!rate under Samarra. Wheat, barley, wool and skins are exported, and merchants come from Baghdad to buy these Sheep are exported overland to Syria. We learn that the men of Tikrit are largely employed as raftsmen on the Tigris, and that some are settled at Musal in connection with this profession, which very few natives of Miisal itself adopt. We are told that a tax is levied on rafts by the Turkish authorities ; the skins sup porting each rafts are counted when it is finished and half Sagh piasture (or approximately one penny) is levied per skin. After an hour's halt we continued our journey, and at 1 hour approximately from the start reached the end of the Tikrit cliffs. Here there was an oncampmont of Baijat Arabs on the right bank. At 1 hour 27 minutes, there is land called Hatrah on the left bank, and 5 minutes later wo pass rough water, caused by some rocks ■which aio said to stand out of the river ' as high as a camel ' m the low season. A raft carrying 100 bags of grain was lost here in 1909. At 2 hours i minutes wo roach a rock called Dahri and more bioken water. It is said that this rock does not uncover even at low season. At this point there are, on the right bank, some temporary cultivators from Samarra. Three minutes later como more rocks called Dahri which are said to uncover to the extent of 21 feet in the low season. At 2 hours ] f t minutes are the rocks of Dor, near the left bank, some of them show, some are invisible. Those at present sub merged are said to rise 6 feet above water in the low season and to divide the river into various channels. At 2 hours 30 minutes we have opposite to us, on the left bank, tho villago^of Dor. It has about 500 houses and is the east eeat cf .ludir. Next to us is a email island ; bej ond it a large781 R oute N o . 202— contd. island with water lifts and cultivation ; and beyond that again the branch of the river on which Dar is situated. Between J)or and the river is Imam Dor, a high square, dark-coloured budd ing with round bastions slightly indicated, and a top shaped somewhat like the point of a shrapnel but diminishing m dia meter by 5 stages, the lowest of which has flat faces. The build ing is covered with storks' nests. Dor is a scorched-looking place ; there is no greenery about it. The people are all Sunnis. Below Dor both banks are low for some way. At 2 hours 42 minutes there are rocks called Haraqiyat near the left bank. They are said to project r, feet in low water. Various streams into which the river has divided recombme here and give it a breadth of about 400 yards. At 3 hours 2 minutes low conglomerate cliffs begin on the right bank Eight minutes later there is an opening called ' Rasasi' in conglomerate cliffs upon the left bank. It is evidently the head of an old canal, but the bottom of it is now some 15 feet above even the present level of the river. On the right bank here, half a mile inland, is a mound called Mahaijlr. _ . , . At 3 hours 27 minutes there are water-lifts and cultivation stretching down the right bank. ^ . . At 4 hours 45 minutes we pass mud rums on the left bank | they are inaignificant, but are described as Old Baghdad. The left bank is of conglomerate and raised, the right bank is cultivated and has many water-lifts. j ^ { co- - At 5 hours 14 minutes we reach a place called Qaias olnnas on the left bank. Before it we pass round a large bend of the river which does not appear in our maps. A little further down are trees, marking the site of Bisat, a village of 25 houses of Samarra Arabs. On the right bank opposite Shmas is an Al Bu 'Abbas village, consisting of 30 houses of Samarra Arabs. At 5 hours 22 minutes is Hawai Sullat, a village of 20 houses of Al Bu 'Abbas, a tract extending from the first Al Bu Abbas village, above mentioned, for about 3 miles downstream all bears this name. Since passing ' Old Baghdad' no cliffs nor hills have been visible near the river on the left bank. At 5 hours 36 minutes the left bank still bears the name of Bisat. Some houses are visible on it. There have been various islands since passing Old Baghdad ' and the mam channel of782 R oute N o . 202— j ?iett e deaT 1 ' ii,h ^ *» ^ b ' ,lk ' h » s to wind « ,.

There were many* has sfccSa appointed di ^ ribu ^' of the Oudh Beque'.t tortioo and ill-usage and efficiently protects his clients from ex-783 R oute N o . 202— cmid. complaints of the ill-treatment of pilgrims by khddims (guides to the shrines) and others. Oil the white-washed wall of a room in a house some Persian had scribbled in pencil the following indictment of the khddims, which is the more interesting as probably not having been intended for any European eye : ' Nous sommes arrives a cefcte Sainte Place le 16 Rebieh-el- Aval 132G apm* pelerinage. Xous partons le 18 de ce mois, mais helas que les khuddarns nous ont fait beau- coup de mal :ce ne sont les justes khuddams, mais ils sont des brigands et des malfaiteurs.' The kilid-ddr or key-keeper of the shrines was Saiyid Hasan, who had been appointed the previous year. The killd-dar has power over the khddims, whom he can exclude from the sacred precincts. The khdiims, some of whom exercise their calling regularly and some occasionally only, belong to various tdifahs or tribes. Only about 15 are officially recognised by the Turkish authorities, but the others who work without recognition are very numerous. Those who show the Sardab Sahib-az-Zaman, or underground place where the Mehdi is supposed to have disappear ed, belong to the Al Bu Nisan 'Abbas and A1 Bu Tdijahs, which, oddly enough, are Sunni. Thoee who show the 'Askariyain, or burial place of the Imams, are of the Tdifahs Al Bu Salih Shaikh (to which the hilU-ddr himself belongs), Al Bu 'Abbas, and Ai Ashashah. There is much fine daim land about Samaria, that is land on which crops are grown by rainfall without the help for irrigation, and it bore a fine harvest in the year of our visit. Most of the land in the district is Miri, i.e., owned by the Government, which leases it to individuals on rent. There are no large free hold proprietors in the neighbourhood. Our raft was got under way again in the afternoon. At 55 minutes we passed Tinah, 10 houses of the Al Bu NisSn, on the right bank. Here are good ripe crops. At 1 hour 13 minutes, at Qaim, there is an opening in the conglomerate of the left bank marking the head of a canal. At 1 hour 37 minutes the right bank shows ruins called Istabalat, situated on high ground ; also a police post, seemingly in perfect order, but said to have been unoccupied since an attack upon it by the Shammar tribe 3 years ago.784 R oute N o . 202— conld. At 1 hour 51 minutes the head of the Dujail canal is shown on the right bank ; it is cut through high earthy ground and is narrow and deep, with great mounds of excavated silt beside it. Below this the banks appear low, and the tract on the right bank is called Qubban ; there are Arab camps, but no permanent vil lages. At 2 hours 25 minutes, we see on the left bank the head of the old Jalsiyah canal. The canal seems to be a very large one, and the huge piles of silt clearance along it resemble high railway embankments. At 2 hours 49 minutes we reach a ferry where there are 3 boats, capable of carrying 50 or 60 persons each. On the right bank are a hut and 2 or 3 sheds ; a very few gendarmes are stationed here in summer, and in winter are transferred to the opposite bank. By crossing here from the right bank to the left travellers from Baghdad toSamarracan reduce the remainder of their journey from 6 hours to 4, i.e., can save 2 hours. The telegraph wire here crosses to the Samarra side. Here we noticed 14 large qui]ahs which had come up from Baghdad to collect j iss (gypsum mortar) and firewood. At 3 hours 5 minutes we passed A1 Hawai, a village of 23 houses of '' Sawamirah ' and A1 Bu Daraj Arabs, on the left bank. Opposite, on the right bank was an encampment of Mujamma' (possibly ' miscellaneous ') Arabs. At 3 hours 17 minutes the river divides ; the land between the branches, at this season an island, is called Barqah. The left branch passes the caravanserai of Khan Misraqchi, one to two miles down it; the right branch passes Tall Jabbarat on the right bank at 3 hours 27 minutes. The telegraph line is to the west of the river. At 3 hours 40 minutes we are opposite Khan Misraqchi, but at a great distance from it. Khan Sawiyah is mentioned as in the same direction ; it is apparently not another khan, how ever, but the locality in which Khan Misraqchi is situated— so at least say our informants. The banks of the river are now of the same character as about Baghdad, that is to say they consist of firm alluvial soil, stand 10 to 15 feet high, and carry numerous water-lifts. The breadth of the river is now generally about 300 to 350 yards.785 Route No. 202— contd* At 4 hours 9 minutes we arrive at the head of a right-bank island called Jazirat-ad-Darawish. Here are several char ads (water-lifts) in full swing: the cultivators are Sawakinah. On the left bank of the river, opposite, is a camp of the Al Bu Daraz. At 4 hours 30 minutes we are at the lower end of Darawish Island, and at 4 hours 53 minutes at the middle of Tuthah, another right-bank island. At 5 hours 35 minutes we are passing through a reach called Bi 'rurah, after which there is an island called Bahairiyah on the Side towards the right bank. At 6 hours 16 minutes comes the end of Bahairiyah Island, and 8 minutes later Dalai'ah, a camp of Jibur Arabs on the left bank. At 7 hours 3 minutes, on the right bank, in a tract occupied by Al Bu Handhal Arabs, is Safinah, a square enclosure where the Turkish authorities receive and store agricultural rents paid to them in kind. At 7 hours 41 minutes, on the right bank, is Habbab, a walled camp of 'Azzah or 'Obaid Arabs. At 7 hours 59 minutes we pass 'Ausajah, a camp of 'Azzah Arabs on the right bank; and 7 minutes further on we halt for the night. m 'AUSAJAH to MALLUH In 40 minutes from getting under way the next morning we arrive at the end of the reach called 'Ausajah. At 1 hour 10 minutes there is a temporary cessation of the water-lifts on the right bank. At I hour 30 minutes we are at Qubbah Shawali which seems to be the end, on the right bank, of the shingly zone of the Tigris. At 1 hour 43 minutes the 'Adhaim stream flows into the Tigris on its left bank. At 2 hours 16 minutes we enter a reach called 'Aqab. At 2 hours 27 minutes we enter the reach of Sufait, on which there is a camp of Al Bu Haiyazah ('Obaid) Arabs. We are informed that in this district each ordinary water lift of 2 pulleys pay £T. 5 a year to the Turkish Government. At 2 hours 56 minutes we are in the Ahmad-al-Faiyadh reach, where there are 25 to 30 water lifts on the right bank. iSome-786 R oute N o. 202—contd. where hereabouts, near the left bank, is said to be another Khan- as-Safinah, like the last a Government grain store. At 3 hours 42 minutes we are passing through the Kuwar reach, so called from some brick kilns. At 4 hours 18 minutes the reach we are in is called Dojmah on the left, and Khadhairah on the right bank. Khadhairah directly follows Ahmad-al-Faiyadh, i.e., presumably, Kuwar, is confined to the left bank. At 5 hours 12 minutes we pass Himma, opposite to which is Zambur ; I forgot to note which of these two was- on which side. At G hours 7 minutes is th&amp; head of the Husai reach, so called on the right bank ; and 35 minutes later we are passing water lifts on the right bank which are still called Husai. At 7 hours 2 minutqs the banks on both sides of the river are quite low, and the river seems as much as 500 yards broad. At 7 hours 14 minutes we are at the middle of a roach called (on the left bank) Dagharah, and the breadth of the stream is- about quarter of a mile. At 7 hours 35 minutes we are opposite to the date plantation of Jaizani on the left bank. Jaizani village is said to lie a little way inland and to consist of 50 to 100 houses of Shi'ah Arabs. At 7 hours 57 minutes the date gro\ies of Sindiyah begin, and quarter of an hour later we reach Sindiyah itself, which is on the left bank of the river. It was here that Mr. Tabor, one of Sir W. Willcocks' engineers, was fired at by Arabs with rifles while surveying in the bed of the river in the winter of 1909-10, and it does not appear that his assailants have ever been brought to justice ; it was pretenHed that they were strangers from else where. SINDIYAH .. .. Sindiyah consists of 100 houses, perhaps ra ther less, of Shrah Arab® belonging to the Bani Tamim, Dilaim, and other tribes ; there are only 4 or 5 households of Sunnis. There are no shops. Op posite it, on the other side of the river, is a grove of gharab (Euphrates poplar) which serves as a halting place for caravan^ from Baghdad. Sindiyah is included in the Mudlrate of Dalta- wa. There are some lands in the village assigned ' to the Pro phet. ' that is to the Makkah, nkrines, and these were held on787 R oute N o . 202— contd. tease, at the time of our visit, by Anwar Baig, one of the Haidari- zadah family of Baghdad. Here we met the first grain^purehasing boats of the season coming up the river from Baghdad ; they were running before &amp; fair wind which greatly retarded our own progress. At 37 minutes after leaving Sindiyah we were in a reach called, on the right bank, Tuwair. Nine minutes later we passed a ferry of one qu, Jah. At 1 hour 11 minutes, detached date groves beloging to Sa'diyah village began on the left bank. It is at Sa'diyah, written by the Germans Saidije, that the KhSnaqin branch of the Baghdad Railway is intended to cross the Tigris ; the name is therefore likely to become better known. At 1 hour 34 minutes we pass Sa'diyah itself ; it is on the left bank and consists of about 100 houses of Arabs, Shi'ahs, as are all the inhabitants of the Khalis tract, or that watered from the right bank of the Diyalah. Behind Sa'diyah are date groves, and just below it is a tomb said to be that of the Banat-al-Hasan. At 2 hours 10 minutes we pass the pump of Haji 'Umr, in a reach styled (on the right bank) Shaikh Jamil. At 2 hours 40 minutes a tract called TSrmlyah begins on tho right bank ; it is marked by the end (head or tail) of a high silted- up canal which has been cut away by the river; this landmark is called Ishan Tarmlyah- At 3 hours we are said to be opposite Mansarlyah on the left bank, but the village is hidden by date plantations. It consists of 200 houses of Shi'ahs. Below it is a tomb, said to be that of the Bani-al-'Abbas. At 3 hours 6 minutes we pass the head of the Tarmlyah canal on the right bank. It is above the present level of the river, and we are told that water now very seldom passes into it. The width of the river here is 400 to 500 yards. Just below Tarmlyah are signs of the head of an embankment, or possibly another canal, having been cut away by the river. At 3 hoiirs 56 minutes the river is more than usually broad; the breadth seems about 600 yards. At 4 hours 10 minutes we reached the end of the reach called Tarmlyah on the right and Mansuriyah on the left bank. A strong wind from the south-south-west now drove our raft on t® the left bank, and for more than an hour we could not move. 3x2788 R outs N o . 202— contd. Forty minutes after starting again we had the tract of Has- hus, with numerous water-lifts, on our right. On the left bank opposite was Raqqah, a locality without a village. At 1 hour 35 minutes Qaisariyin, a village of 100 Shi'ah houses, was on the loft bank. At 1 hour 49 minutes the tract of Has-hus ended, and that of Suwaidiyah began, upon the right bank; while on the left was the village of Hawaish, 300 houses of Shi'ah Arabs. At 3 hours was the end of Suwaidiyah on the right bank. At 3 hours 27 minutes we passed on the left bank Jadidah, a village of 200 Shi'ah houses; and on the right bank a reach called Malluh began. At 4 hours 2 minutes a reach styled Yahudiyah began on the left bank, Malluh still continuing on the right. At 4 hours 27 minutes we tied up for the night in the Malluh reach. MALLUH to BAGHDAD .. Starting early we reach ed the end of Malluh (right bank) in 20, and that of Yahudiyah (left bank) in 25 minutes. At 35 minutes a tract called Babi began on the right bank. At 55 minutes we passed Rashdiyah village on the left bank ; it seemed to consist of a two-storeyed house and a few culti vators' huts At 1 hour 5 minutes the tract of BSbi ended and that of Mashahidah began upon the right bank. At 1 hour 23 minutes we passed Sawakin on the left bank, consisting of 10 houses of Shi'ahs and 2 brick kilns. About this time, not long after sunrise, the southerly wind, which had fallen at sunset on the previous evening, began again. A raft, having considerable surface and no means of propulsion, is greatly retarded by contrary winds ; at bends it is driven on shore ; and, when the wind is sufficiently strong, the current will no longer carry it along even in midstream. At 2 hours 3 minutes DawudTyah, a village of 15 houses of Shi'ah Arabs, passed on the left bank. At 2 hours 30 minutes the wind compelled us to tie up at 'Awaijah, a village of 30 houses of Mashahidah, opposite to which there ie an enclosure on the left bank.789 R oute N o. 202^ — concld. Forty-three minutes after getting under way again we paeaed Hasaiwah, a hamlet of G houses of Mashahidah, on the right bank ; here the tract called 'Awaijah ends. On the bank opposite there are poplar trees and the tract is still called Dawudlyah. It should be noted that the Mashahidah of the right bank villages are Sunnis, and ho differ from the inhabitants of the opposite bank. At 1 hour 8 minutes, further progress being impossible owing to the wind, I disembarked just above the head of a small canal called the Nahr-al-Pasha, intending to save time by walking to Baghdad. At this point is a little village, with another a few minutes' walk above it; both villages are waqf, i.e., held in trust for spiritual or secular purposes. The inhabitants are Dilaim, but no tolerable riding animal could be procured. The Nahr -al-Pasha is about 5 yards wide and several feet deep ; it is spanned near its head by a brick-bridge. Even in the present favourable state of the river it is high and dry. ROUTE No. 203. F rom BASRAH to NASIRlYAH. 115 miles. ^ stages* Authorities. —Indian Expeditionary Force ' D,' 1915.

Shaqldwah to liowdnduz. —There is a more direct road from Shaqlawah to Rowanduz than that by Batas, but it is also more difficult for mules. It is that through Baizan. The distance is 10 hours. In winter this route is blocked by enow. Bowdnduz to Koi Sanjaq. —The 3 stages on this road are :— Eowanduz by Darband 'Ali Baig to Binavi (7 hours) ; Binavi to Siktan (8 hours) ; Siktan to Koi Sanjaq (5 hours). Bowdnduz to Eanlydh. —The easiest way is to follow the Koi Sanjaq route to Binavi and one hour further to a place called Khata. The further stages are : Khata to Chiwah (7 hours, easy, along a valley); Chiwah to Sarwisawa (6 hours, easy) ; Sarwisawa to Raniyah (3^ hours, easy, over a plain). There are more direct routes from Rowanduz to Raniyah, but they are more difficult, and in winter they are blocked by snow. Tiowdnduz to Edyat and beyond. —The stages are : Rowanduz to Dargalah (5 hours, a good useful road) ; Dargalah to Galalah, where there is a Mudir under the Qaim-Maqam of Rowanduz (4 hours pretty easy going, but stony); Galalah to Rayat (6 hours pretty easy going). At Rayat there are a quarantine station, a telegraph office, and a post of gendarmerie. Beyond Rayat there is a hill, Garwi Shaikh, to be surmount ed ; after that the plain of Lahijan is entered. The next stage is reached at Shinawah (3 hours, fairly good going, presumably after coming out on the plain). At Shinawah there is a cross-roads. One route runs thence through the Mangur country, in which the chief place is Narain, to Sardasht and Banah. Another runs as follows to ' Sauj halaq Shinawah to Lagbal (6 hours easy, over plain) ; Lagbal to Maidaa Bulaq (2 hours through hills, but easy) ; Maidau Bula^ to Saujbulaq (3 hours, hills, but easy). This latter is a caravan route. Pashwah, a Turkish military station, is 3 to 4 hours from Lagbal ; the road is to the left of that going to Siujbiilaq, and is easy, running over a plain *».«. ' Sujbulak.'798 It should be noted that the passes between Rayat and SMnS wah are sometimes blocked by snow in winter for one, two, or even three months. The natives then use a kind of snow-shoe for crossing them. Rowdnduz to Urumlyah, etc. —The stages are: Rowanduz to Badiiyan (2 hours, easy) ; Badilyan to Sidakan (4 hours, some hills, but easy) ; Sidakan to Bairikmah (3 hours, easy) ; ascent of the Kuh-i-Chailashin pass ; to Shno,* a small town where there is a QSim-Maqam. _ _ From s hn5 one road goes to the right to Sundusj- and Sauj- bulaq. Another goes to the left to Margawar, where there is a Turkish XShiyah, and so to Urumlyah. The Chailashln pass is sometimes under deep snow for three months in winter. Rowdnduz to 'Aqrah. —The stages are : Rowanduz to Shait- nah, where good tobacco is grown (5 hours, fairly easy but through hills) ; Shaitnah to Baibarun {8 hours, a difficult road) ; Baibarun to RaizanJ on the Zab (3 hours, all down hill but steep and stony) ; crossing of the Zab on a raft ; from the ferry to Blr- i-Kapran§ (3 hours easy going); Bir-i-Kapranl| to'Aqrah (7 hours, up and down, mostly up ; two bad hills). Additional notes. Khurinj is a place belonging to Persia between Maidan Bulaq and Saujbulaq. Waznah is reached by turning ^o the right at Maidan Bulaq or from Pashwah ; it is distant 1 day from the former and 1 h days from the latter place. Waznah stands in a plain with low hills and is about the same size as BStas. Saujbulaq is as large as Arbil. Sardasht has about 200 houses. Lahijan, when used as the name of a place, means Pashwah.

In the low season the Tigris is fordable at the following 8 places between Mosul and Baghdad :—■ 1. At Jahainah (see page 771); 2. At a place called Shaqq, immediately above the junction . of the Little Zab with the Tigris (see page 779) ; 3. At half an hour's walk above Sa'luah (see page 780) ; 4. At quarter of an hour's walk above the Dahri rocks (se© page 781) ; 5. At the middle of Bisat (see page 782) ; 6. At Tlnah (see page 784) ; 7. At Darawlsh Island (see page 786) ; and 8. At Bahairiyah (see page 786). All of these fords are pebbly, and there is always a part in each where the water is breast high. No native sailing boats go above Samarra. Even in the low season they could no doubt get to Tikrit, but only by canying half cargoes. In other seasons than the lowest the current would be too strong to tow above Samarra. The largest vessels reaching Samarra itself only carry 8 tons. ... In the height of the floods a raft may get from Mosul to Tikrit m 24 running hours, and from Tikrit to Baghdad in the same. But, as above Tikrit, it is dangerous to run by night; the least that the whole journey can be performed in is about (50 hours. Ndhiyah. Dairah Harlr Barak Barad5st Shairwan Headquarters.
