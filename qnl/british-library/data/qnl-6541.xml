This Document is the property of Eer Majesty's Secretary of Sta te foe India. Confidential. 1899 . British Policy in Persia. Minute by Sir A. C. Lyall. (Secret Letter from India, No. 175, 21st September 1899.—Pol. 927/99). The Government of India, in their letter dated 21st September 1899, begin by tatin^ that they have not been able to discover “ in their records any clear efinition of the principles upon which our policy toward the Persian Kingdom s based. Accordingly they concur with Sir M. Durand m his belief that the ime has come for laying down a definite line of P°hey. T Ky proceed to lesoribe the strategical and commercial interests of Great Britain and India n Persia and to draw a picture of the present condition of those interests.^ I do not think that this description of the existing state of affairs contains mvthing of importance that has not been already recognised and well under- itood by those who have studied the question. Russian influence is pre- nonderant in North Persia ; British influence has the advantage in the South, rom the proximity of the sea coast; hut their respective spheres are undefined, in paragraphs 15-19 of their letter the Government of India propose certain measures for strengthening our position and guarding our interests at certain places; and to these wo might agree, subject to settlement ot hnancial ^Paragraphs 20, 22, and 28 discuss the importance of certain terri tory points or regions,—Seistan, Khorassan, the Persian Gulf-whose situation more directly affects India. All these points are said to be more or less immediately threatened by Russia; and undoubtedly we must resist any encroachments upon our position and influence in i . Quarters. The Government of India declare (paragraph 47) that, in the area (which includes these important points) of British influence, that influence h directly 0 and increasingly challenged by other nations; and they proceed (paragraph 50) to consider what steps should be taken ior the piotection ot the common interests in those parts of Great Britain and India. They be&lt;'in by a reference to the assurances interchanged between Russia and England concerning the maintenance of the integrity and independence of Persia.° Presuming these pledges or engagements to be still in existence, the Government of India place no reliance upon their effect in checking Russian encroachments, and are of opinion that such engagements may tend ^Thev al°s™ beheve 1 that the policy of joint action by England and Russia to imoose reforms upon Persia is impracticable; but they raise the question whether a distinct understanding between the two European Powers tor the separate patronage --^^^Uiotl^Me' “t.S queS, /think tha/tlle difficulties aiul drawhacks so forcibly enumerated in paragraphs 58-61 Ke letter are decisive against attempting spheres of interest upon the Persian the proposition, a lint* we are contemplating a partition of the Governmen a convi ^ essence inconsistent with our own kk ^menUo°Sin thSpendenec and integrity of Persia, and if Russia D nnted it she would probably treat it afterwards as a pretext for maintaining tlTbfo r owract we had released her from her previous assurances. Nor l 1 understand why the Government of India, having already pronounced listing nl/ -e to be quite untrustworthy, should immediately afterwards surest entering into a new and much more dangerous contract with issia. S. 59. vntev ll' into a now UIIU inu^u mwiv, — - 'The niere suggestion might lay the British Government open tothe same imputation that in this letter the Indian Government brings against Russia, of a disposition to treat engagements as mainly nominal, whenever it becomes expedient to break them. If, however, the notion of defining separate spheres of influence is rejected, as I hope it may be, the Government of India are inclined to fall back on the alternative policy recommended by Sir M. Durand, of intimating plainly to Persia that aggressive action by Russia in the North would immediately result in decided action by us in the South. In the 11th para graph of his letter to the Foreign Office, dated 6th March 1896, the Secretary of State has distinctly given his opinion that such a communication would be impolitic; and I should strenuously advise adherence to this opinion. There are grounds for suspecting that Persia has already heard something of this recommendation, and that this knowledge is not unconnected with a diminution of the personal influence of the British Minister at Tehran. My own view is that such an intimation would only play into Russian hands, and would necessarily weaken any trust in our own sincere desire to maintain Persian independence and integrity. In short, as regards general principles of policy, I find nothing in these papers that need induce us to alter the conclusions stated in the letter of 2nd March 1896 from the India Office to the Foreign Office. In writing to the Foreign Office we should aga : n recommend endeavouring to obtain from Russia a fresh and explicit assurance that the understanding for the maintenance of Persia s integrity and independence is still recognised. Paragraphs 63-88 of the letter from the Government of India deal with the details of measures proposed for safeguarding our interests by the increase of Consular and other establishments in Persia. I leave these for examination in Committees. The main political question discussed in the Viceroy’s Minute is whether a railway from Quetta to Seistan would or would not stimulate Russia into taking immediate steps to forestall us at that point. I myself believe that this result would follow, or else that Russia would use it as a strategic reason for pushing forward elsewhere, seeing that Russian Ministers have openly warned us that every advance on our side would be answered by a corres ponding advance on their side. Moreover, it is certain that at present Persia could not allow us to bring a railway into Persian territory, having just renewed for five years the agreement to grant no railway concessions in Persian territory. But the A iceroy’s Minute notices this difficulty among others, and his conclusions on the railway question are somewhat inde terminate. In the meantime, there are, in my opinion, no political objections against connecting Quetta by railway with Nushki. 3rd November 1899. A. C.
