Section 2. [E 7017/549/25] Copy No. H7 Sir R. Bullard to Viscount Halifax.—(Received October 18.) (No. 140.) My Lord, Jedda, September 19, 1939. I HAVE the honour to submit a brief report on the situation as seen at Jedda. 2. the German attempt to represent the visit of Khalid-al-Gargani, the envoy of Ibn Saud. to Berlin as having great political significance did them more harm than good in the eyes of Ibn Saud. who has no wish to be tied to Hitler’s chariot and to fly from known to unknown evils. It was reasonable that he should try to obtain from the Germans arms which we could not supply, especially if they were^ willing to grant favourable credits. Ibn Saud communicated to His Majesty’s Government the correspondence in which his envoy related the progress of the negotiations with the Germans, and requested their advice when the Germans asked for a neutrality agreement in return for the facilities promised. The advice being rather long in coming, he on his own initiative sent a polite refusal to enter into a neutrality agreement. It is interesting to learn that the Germans hastened to accept Ibn Sand’s point of view. Unless the correspondence communicated to us has been falsified (and there is no reason to believe this). Ibn Saud told the Germans openly that his interests prevented his taking any step which would involve him in difficulties with His Majesty’s Government. The outbreak of war brought the negotiations to an end, and on the 13th September Ibn Saud sent Khalid a telegram instructing him to return home. Khalid had not enough money for the return journey, and as Ibn Saud considered it impossible to send money to Germany, he instructed Khalid to go to some neutral country, preferably Switzerland, where he could receive money from Saudi Arabia for the journey‘home. Khalid is said to be due here soon, but I have no official information on that point. 3. As Mr. Trott reported to you at the time, towards the end Khalid gained the impression that the Germans were not anxious to supply the arms in any case. If the Germans expected hostilities to break out soon, that might well be the case : they would need all the arms they could get; Ibn Saud could not be relied upon not to be sympathetic towards their enemy, Great Britain; and the foreign exchange to be paid for the arms in instalments would probably never reach them. Later, however, they seem to have been keen to supply the arms, and the agreement was signed. Ibn Saud, however, seems to have taken it for granted that the outbreak of war destroyed all hope of his getting the arms. I have received your telegram No. 126, dated the 13th September, in which it is stated that if the Germans are still willing to supply the arms without unacceptable conditions. His Majesty’s Government see no reason why Ibn Saud should not take advantage of the offer, though as to the method of payment, about which His Majesty’s Government could make suggestions, they would deprecate the transfer of gold to Germany. The agreement, a copy of‘which was transmitted in Mr. Trott’s secret letter of the 6th September to Mr. Baxter, provides for the sale of 10,000 Mauser rifles complete and 10 million cartridges for the sum of £119,962 3s.. c.i.f. Jedda, payment to be made in seven equal instalments at dates from four to seventy-six months after delivery of the goods. 4. It was to be expected that when the German Minister was handed his passports by the Iraq Government he would try to make for Saudi Arabia, where from the shelter of his other legation he might be a thorn in the side of the Allies, and. in fact, he applied to Ibn Saud for permission to travel to Saudi Arabia by land from Najaf, with several cars. Ibn Saud did not want to have Dr Grobba [730 s—2]in his country at all. He could not refuse to receive him altogether, since Dr. Grobba is accredited to him, but he found a good excuse tor refusing to allow him to come by land : he alleged that the tribes on the route, excited by the talk of hostilities, and particularly by the news that Iraq had entered the war, nug ^ make some regrettable mistake. It was expected here that after reaching hyna, Dr. Grobba would make an attempt to reach Jedda by sea, but 1 have no news of his movements or intentions. i r u i ^ 5. The situation in Jedda is much more tranquil at present than 1 had reason to expect a year ago. It seemed almost certain that Italy would be against us if we went to war with Germany, and this would have turned Jedda into a centre of propaganda and brought the war much nearer to Ibn Saud. Moreover, at that time it was not foreseen that a conference would result in the adoption by His Majesty’s Government of a Palestine policy which not even the Arab extremists could deny to be an improvement from their point of view, and wine, would enable the Arab States to side with us whole-heartedly in case of a European war. The Italian wireless broadcasts are carefully neutral and the Italian Legation are not distributing any objectionable propaganda. Among certain sections of the populace the violent German broadcasts, professing love for the Arabs and disinterested wishes for their independence and their liberation from the Jews, are not without effect, but on the other hand, it is the pilgrimage that matters to Jedda and, indeed, to Saudi Arabia as a whole, and for that the country is largely dependent on Great Britain and not at all on Germany. Moreover, public opinion here has little or no effect upon Ibn Saud, who steers his own course. . . 6. Ibn Saud defined his attitude in a message, which was reported m the last paragraph of Jedda telegram No. 119, dated the 3rd September. In this message Ibn Saud assures His Majesty’s Government that he would never give any undertaking or take any secret or open action with any Moslem or (other) foreign Government which might damage British interests or affect his relations with His Majesty’s Government. This assurance is of a piece with Ibn Saud s policy for many years past. He does not claim that he has any greater affection for us than any other non-Moslem foreigners, but only that his interests are in essence identical with ours. 7. It is early to say what course the war will take. I he attitude of Italy and Turkey must naturally be of great concern to Ibn Saud, and what policy they will eventually adopt is at present unknown. All that can be said is that for the moment the task of His Majesty’s Legation in Jedda is easier than I expected it would be. Ibn Saud is impatient to see me to discuss matters of common interest, and in my telegram No. T23, dated the 13th September. I suggested that, in the first place, I should pay him a visit at Riyadh; as an alternative, he seems much to prefer to a suggestion that Captain de Gaury should visit him. It was I who originally proposed that if war broke out it might serve the interests of His Majesty’s Government well if Ibn Saud would allow us to have a representative at Riyadh, and suggested Captain de Gaury as the ideal officer for this purpose, but from the comments of Ibn Saud, some received before and some after the despatch of my telegram No. 123, it is evident that if this project is still desirable, and is ever to be realised, it requires preparation by a visit from the Minister at Jedda, which, as Ibn Saud says, would be generally considered natural and not, like a visit from Captain de Gaury, a highly abnormal event. I am expecting to receive at any moment your instructions whether I am to go to Riyadh. 8. The Foreign Office were aware, before I left England, that Ibn Saud had decided to establish a legation in Paris and that Fuad Hamza had been selected for this post. My French colleague, M. Ballereau. who is as active as his predecessor was supine, claims that this step has been taken as a result of his insistence. He declares that the Quai d’Orsay do not understand the Arab point of view, and that he urged upon the Saudi Government their responsibility to enlighten the French Government on this subject. It is more than probable that Ibn Sand’s main object is to urge the claims of his family to the Throne of Syria and to counteract the influence of the Shereefian family, but M. Ballereau. whether conscious of that fact or not, did not allude to it. But whatever is behind the appointment, it can hardly fail to be advantageousto the Allies that the only legations maintained by Ibn Sand abroad should all be in Allied countries—Great Britain, France, Egypt and Iraq. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Cairo and Bagdad, his Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine, his Excellency the Governor-General of the Sudan, his Excellency the Governor of iVden Colony, the Political Agents at Bahrein and Koweit. the Commissioner ^it Port Sudan, and to the Middle East Intelligence Centre at Cairo.

Ibn Sand showed me a letter written by German Secretary of State to Khalid, after outbreak of war, saying that arms and ammunition could be exported to Jedda by Dutch steamer at Saudi risk; otherwise, they would remain at the disposal of Ibn Saud in the safe keeping of the German Government. The King says, however, that he has decided not to proceed with the transaction during the war lest his action should be exaggerated by the Germans or misinterpreted by others. I made suitable reference to the wisdom of this decision. Ibn Saud stated, with a meaning smile, that after the allied victory, for which he hoped, German arms might be going for nothing.■ - rs Ho. 2021/572/35. 3li/ 3Hi2iT BKlTiaH LEGATION, «J ijDiJA • oAUDI Ax&lt;A-lA.

I have received Your Majesty’s secret letter and understood it all as the cypher had no mistakes s and I am ready to execute all Your Majesty’s commands : I have no other ambition, as Your Majesty Knows* I had an interview with the head of the Lastern Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and spoke to him in the sense you command. I made clear to him, in a decent and appropriate way, all the points which Your Majesty explained. I took great pains to convince him that Your Majesty desired greatly that your friendship with Germany should continue, as well as that with other nations. But as for Britain, I explained to him what I had already said to him previously, on the reason for Your Majesty’s determination to adhere to your friendship for them, and how that was a matter of religious feeling, as well as prompted by yur feelings as an Arab, and by geographical considerations and the interests of your country* I said all this in a proper way, and added that it was impossible for Your Majesty to sell your friendship for a price. The question of the arms was in their hands. If they wished to complete the transaction, well and good. If they preferred to put i£ off till a more suitable occasion when the international situation wouldwould be more propitious, let them do so : I was refcdy depart without having completed the transaction, ifl there (Q j was any difficulty about it, for it was impossible His majesty to a^ree to anything which was contrary to the interests of anybody, whether of German or anyone else, more especially in the present circuustances* He understood what I said, and asked for two days to consider it and ask instructions from his superior officers. After two days he sent to me in my hotel and said he wanted to come and have tea with me, and he did so. He talked to me for a long time very courteously, and could not have been more agreeable. He said he had reported all I had said to his superiors, who had seen that there was force and truth in it all. They were very pleased at my complete firmness. And in truth they had no doubt whatever of Your majesty 1 s honesty, and your attachment to your obligations and treaties : what I had told them had confirmed that view and shown it was true: they appreciated Your majesty’s position and its difficulties : they knew that you were the sole person who was capable of ruling your country properly : they did not wish to embarrass you or place you in difficulties with your f™- ends ; but they desired that you should demonstrate to all people your position clearly, so that your independence should not depend on any one else : that was one thing. The second point was that the action of the English and the French in helping the Jews and the Turks had induced then to consider that their position in relation to the Arabs was one of stubbornness a 2d watchfulness. The third point was that they trusted that Your Majesty would demonstrate to the world that you were not under the thumb of the British* They0 ‘ .. They had no desire except for the interests of the Arabs,' and their independence* So at this time they would! n °to x o insist on Your Majesty taking up any point of view which you did not consider appropriate for you, or in which you considered there might be some disadvantage to your country or your people* Therefore the Minister for Foreign Affairs had ordered him to accept all the explanations which I had given him, to proceed to execute all the transaction, which there was no need to suspend or delay. In accordance with those instructions he had come to bsing me this good news and to present to me a letter of which I submit herewith a translation to Your Ma jesty* On the following day they sent to me the director of the company with which the transaction was to be concluded and he handed to me a proposal of an agreement which had been signed temporarily : so I signed it too, but it does not come into force until Your Majesty announces your approval.

Honourable Royal Counsellor. I have the honour to confirm to you the result of the conversations which we have had up to the present time. The Reich G-overnraent is very desirous of giving proof 01 its friendship to oaudi Arabia, a friendship which it has already shown by the appointme t of a Minister Henipoten tiahy to that country: so it accepts certain orders given by the King. The Government of the Reich agrees that the oaudi Arabian Government should purchase from it the goods which it requires from German firms up to the value of six million reichsmark, equivalent to half a million pounds sterling, payable in seven equal annual instalments in sterling. Tlie transaction will commence by the submission of orders from the oaudi Government through th German Government to German firms, selected by the German government, and those firms will execute the orders under the supervision of the German Government. The orders will be C I F Jedda : payment will be arranged under the conditions which prove necessary.

You may recall that a certain Khalid al Hud was for some time in Berlin negotiating for the purchase of arms on behalf of the oaudi Arabian Government* He was recalled shortly after the outbreak of war, and as far as we are aware the deal did not go through. Vs/e have, however, received a copy of a draft contract with the Ferros.tahl A.G. Bssen, and I thought you might be interested to see it. You will notice that there is no provision for interest in it, but I presume the difference between the gross and the net price is meant to cover that. Yours sincerely, (For ELM% byres, who is away) (Signed) P.M. CaOSTHV/AITH. 0. G.

His Majesty's Government would be most reluctant to see any payments made to Germany in gold or in sterling or other free currency and therefore hope that Saudi Arabian Government will not ratify contract in its present form., An alternative method would be for Saudi Government to offer payment in marks, which might be purchased from neutrals having mark balances m Germany. If German Government were to refuse such terms His Majesty's Government would preier deal to be postponed, since provision oi even small amount or free exchange to Germany would contribute pro tan to to prolongation ox war, which Ibn Saud must be as anxious as His Majesty's Government to avoid. 2. At same time I realise that amount due under contract in near future (i.e. lour months alter delivery of arms) is relatively unimportant (it must, however, be remembered that this particular contract only covers a portion ol whole credit of £500,000 supposed to have been offered and there may be corresponding payments under other contracts), and that whole circumstances may have changed before any further payment is due thereafter. Moreover impossibility of His Majesty's Government themselves supplying arms required adds to difficulty of taking advantage of Ibn Baud's friendliness. 5. In these circumstances I leave it to you to deal with problem as best you can (for preference during visit to Riyadh) with discretion to accept contract as it stands in last resort if you find it essential to do so. /^ This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty*s Governmerit^ and ^should be returned to the Foreign Office if not re quired for official GENERAL DISTRIBUTION .

Ibn Saud is grateful for your message. He would obviously like to have arms but says that if difficulties are great he would prefer to av/ait the end of the crisis. On the other hand he foresees some difficulties which are not inevitable, e. g, he seems to think it essential that a German should come here v '- to complete arrangements and he evidently does not understand the question of payment at all. I think that His Majesty’s Govern ment should suggest to him the least objectionable procedure and he would accept it. Alternatively I could discuss details with him if I am to see him soon. 2. For terms of payment see Mr. Trott’s letter of 6th September. The first instalment would be about £17,000 sterling four months after the delivery of the documents and the arrival of the goods.f 6170 No. 1926/483/52 BRITISH LEGATION Personal Jj^DDA J August 25., 1939. Your Royal Highness, I have the honour to inform Your Royal Highness that I am instructed to convey to you the following message from my Government to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, in to the message which you sent to them requesting their views concerning a reply to the German Government. 2. His Majesty’s Government are most grateful for the opportunity of expressing their views on this German message communicated to King Ahdul Aziz by Khalidabu , l Walid. They regard that mark of confidence as a further signal proof of the friendship which His Majesty has shown the British Government on so many occasions already.^ 3. The British Government suggest that His Majesty might send to the German Government an oral, or at any rate an informal message to the effect that he does not agree that friendship for Grer.t Britain is inconsistent with friendship for Germany or any other state: that his policy aims at friendship with all states alike: that he has signed no treaty of alliance with any great power: and that so far as His Majesty is concerned the question of taking sides in any conflict between great powers has not even arisen. 4. The British Government maxe tnis suggestion because neither His Majesty nor any other statesman can forsee exactly how his country’s interests will be affected in the event of general hostilities: r- ^Governments usually aim at keeping for His Royal Highness, The Amir Peisal Taif,/ (Q q 'belligerency or neutrality as circumstances perifli'trr'—^^—- for themselves as much freedom of action in the matter of * ' - . 6170 5, Moreover if His Majesty were to sign a formal agreement of the kind described, that would be interpreted by ignorant and thoughtless persons, of whom there are too many in every country, as an indio-tion that his sympathies lay with the central powers. This in its turn might have a most unfortunate eifect on the British Governments prestige throughout the Middle Hast. The British Government hope that His Majesty will agree that any action which added to the difficulties of the British Government and their allies either in advance of or during a war might be disastrous from the point of view of the Middle Eastern states themselves. 6. His Majesty will see that since he h^.s been good enough to consult them, the British Government wish to inform him that they would prefer him not to go beyond a message such as is suggested in the third paragraph above, coupled possibly with an assurance in the matter of propaganda and military matters to hold the balance evenly between all countries. 7. As regards the last named-points, the British Government are not clear what the German Government mean by references to 'propaganda”, ^military matters', and 'other things which might affect friendly relations'. Presumably the German C^overnment desire an assurance that apart from keening neutral in war, His Majesty in ordinary times will act in a strictly impartial manner as between the German and the British Governments. 8. In the matter of propaganda in particular, the British Government ask nothing better, as His Majesty knows, than that he should maintain strict impartiality between all countries. Int 6170 In the past His Majesty has, the British Governments understands, always refused to entertain propaganda^o^ behalf of foreign governments no matter what those governments may be. The British Government consider that this is a natural and proper course for His Majesty to pursue, though they hope that if actual hostilities break out, His Majesty will feel able to make it clear that in his view the victory of the Allied Powers would be desirable in the interests of the Arab States. With highest respects, (Signed) A.C. Trott.If t No* Ministry Taif • August 29th., 1939 PERSONAL. Dear Mr. Trott, • I have received your personal message No. 1^26/483/52 dated August 25th., 1939, and I am glad to inform you that His Majesty the King has seen the reply sent by His Majesty's Government, in which they thanked us for the marks of true friendship and firm confidence which we h&amp;ve always shown. We wish to assure you that our attitude towards the British Government is due to a complete conviction and belief that our permanent and mutual interests make this friendship essential to us, and necessitate consultation and exchange of advice on every matter which may effect our mutual relations a We previously explained to the British Government the fundamental points in our policy, and which we can not deviate from by the might of God. We also cannot agree to any matter which may create a gap between us, or result in the interference of our enemies or things between us. As regards the message which may be communicated orally to the German Government, or at any rate in an informal manner, there is no doubt that the British Government has seen the first letter which we sent to Khalid Abul Waleed, our representative, to furnish him with a reply to the German Government, and as a precaution, we sent urgent instructions to Khalid Abul Waleed to inform the German Government very frankly and clearly that it is impossible in any circumstances for us to give any undertaking, or conclude any friendly agreement, Ihe Honouraole Mr. Trott, v /F Jedda\ ^ ^ * Jf agreement, or give any guarantees which may adversely-ai^^ct-'our ' friendship with the British Government, or harm their interests^ Moreover, we explained to Khalid Ahul vi/aleed all that the British Government had mentioned in their suggestion. We instructed him to send us hy post the details of all the latest negotiations between him and the German Government. The mail will reach us tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, and we will communicate his letter to the British Government when it arrives. On this occasion we should like t .&lt; assure the British Government, so that they may be in no doubt 9 that it is impossib' -• for us to give any undertaking, or conclude any pact or take any open o-* secret action with any moslem, Arabian or foreign government, which may adverssely affect the interests of the British Government, and the relations existing between use As regards what is contained in paragraph seven of Mr, Trotts note, about its not being clear to the British Government what Khalid Abul Waleed meant about the request of the German Government in connection with the matter of Propaganda or military matters or anything else which might affect our friendship, we point out to the British Government that our position in this problem is that, as is already known to the British Government, we cannot accept or allow any secret or open propaganda which might affect the British Government's interests crour friendship to be made in the whole of our Kingdom either by our own subjects or by others. All our subjects and all people of our country, and all other peopl all over the world are aware of our friendship with Britain, and know that we do not allow anything which may affect our relations. We still maintain this attitude and always will.0 However our present friendliness towards the Italians ? Germans or any other foreign government is due to three reasons?- (1) We have followed the advice of the British Government that we should adopt a friendly attitude towards all nations. (2) We do not wish to do anything in any problem in which we see that the British Government wish to avoid being involved or to which they are trying to find a peaceful sol Ion. The British Government pursues a policy of friendliness towards all states and we follow their example in that. (3) We communicated to the British Government our intentions in respect of the matters of arms, and they advised us to take the arms required especially the rifles from some other Government, and we, therefore, took the opportunity of the German’s and Italian’s friendliness towards us to ordering certain arms from them. In no circumstances can this cause a rift between us and the British Government, and we do not take any action in such a matter without informing them of it.

Your telegrams Nos. 107 and 108 saving [of August 12th and 15th: neutrality of Ihn SaudJ. Please convey the following reply to Ibn Saud: His Majesty’s G-overnment are most grateful for the opportunity of expressing their views upon the message from the German Government. This mark of confidence is a further signal proof of the friendship which the King has shown to His Majesty's Government in so many ways in the past. 2. His Majesty's Government suggest that the King might send the German Government an oral or at any rate an informal message to the effect that he does not agree that friendship for Great Britain is inconsistent with friendship for Germany or any other .State, that his policy aims at friendship with all States alii® , that he has signed no treaty of alliance with any great Power and that so far as he is concerned the question of taking sides in any conflict between the Great Powers has not even arisen.5. His Maiesty’s Government make this suggestion because neither he nor any other statesman can foresee exactly how his country 1 s interests will be affected in the event of general hostilities and most governments aim at keeping for themselves as much freedom of action in the matter of belligerency or neutrality as circumstances permit. 4. Moreover, were the King to sign a formal Agreement of this kind with the German Government this would be interpreted by ignorant and thoughtless persons, of whom there are only too many in every country, as an indication that his sympathies lay with the Central Powers. This in its turn might have a most unfortunate effect upon the prestige of His Majesty's Government throughout the Middle ;ast. His Majesty’s Government hope that the King will agree that any action which add.ed to the difficulties of His Majesty's Government and their Allies, either in advance of or during a war, might be disastrous from the point of view of the Middle Eastern States themselves, 5. Prom the foregoing the King will see that, since he has been so good, as to consult them, His ma 'esty s Government would prefer him not to go beyond a message such as is suggested in paragraph A coupled possibly with an assurance tnat in the matter of propaganda and military matters he intends to hold the balance evenly between all countries. 6. As regards these latter points, His Majesty s Government are not clear what the German Government mean by references to 'propaganda”, 'military matters' and 'other things which might affect friendly relations'. Presumedly the German Government want an assurance that, apart from keeping neutral in war, the King will in ordinary times act in a strictly impartial manner as between Germany and His Majesty’s Government. 7. In the matter of propaganda in particular, His Majesty’s Government ask nothing better, as the ling knows, than that he should maintain strict impartiality between all countries. He...He uas, they understands set his free resolutely against propaganda on 'behalf of foreign governments, no matter what ohese governments may be. His Majesty’s Government consioer that this is a right and natural course for the King to pursue, although they hone xhat in the event of actual hostilities he would feel able to''make it clear that in his view the victory of the Allied Powers was desirable in the interests of the Arab States.

Trott (Jedda), Foreign Office, 24th August, 1959. 11.50 p.m. No. 114. My immediately preceding telegram [of August 24th: neutrality of Ibn Saud]. Following observations are for your own information only: His Majesty s Government realise that the proposed message may not meet the requirements of the German Government, who are clearly under no obligation to supply Saudi Arabia with arms or credits and free to make what conditions they like before they ao so. They would, however, orefer to await the King's reactions to the reply contained in my immediately preceding telegram before making any other suggestions. 2. You will note that the reply does not contain any precise answer to the King’s enquiry as to the course which His Majesty's Government would wish him to pursue in the event of war. Although, as is suggested in the reply, His Majesty's Government hope that Ibn Saud will be able to show that he is in favour of an allied victory, they do not in fact either wish or expect that he shall enter the war as a belligerent, at any rate at the outset (should hostilities extend to the kiddle East, and in particular should the Yemen join the Central Powers either of her own free will or under duress, the position would probably be different).Hues!’2 . 3. It is, however, one thing to wish Ibn Sand to remain neutral until the course of the war shows that there would he some definite advantage in securing him as an ally, and even to advise him that he would do well to remain neutral (although His majesty's Government wish if they can to avoid giving any advice on this noint). It is quite another thing to have him promise a prospective enemy ol his country that he will remain neutral and a fortiori to advise him to do so. 4. Should the King fail, for whatever reason, to obtain from Germany the arms and credits for which he is now in negotiation, it is highly unlikely that His Majesty’s Government will be able to supply him with these arms or credits themselves. You should therefore do your utmost to avoid being drawn into any discussion of such points. Should the King ask whether, in the event of his accepting the advice of His majesty's Government, they would be able to make good to him the arms and credits which he loses thereby, you should say that you will report the enquiry. 5. As regards 'military matters', the German Government may have in mind such things as military missions. His Majesty's Government would regard the acceptance of German or Italian military or other missions at the present time as most unfortunate, in view of the propaganda which they could carry out, and the impression which their reception would make upon the inhabitants of neighbouring states. 6. But although His Majesty's Government are always anxious in principle to assist Ibn baud in any way they can, the demands'upon their resources at the present time are so great that it is improbable that they could themselves spare officers for such purposes, even if the King were to invite them to do so. They would probably therefore be quite content if the King were to' decide not to receive military or similar missions from any of the Great Powers.

Subject to what the Service Departments may have to say about the Nejd route, some of what Mr. Baggallay has drafted might be used as a basis for a reply to Ibn Saud, but his draft seems overfull of protestations of our inability to help Ibn Saud.

We understand that this question will he discussed at a meeting with the Service Departments this afternoon, hut I have been asked to send you the following observations which occur to us. It seems to us that the crux of the matter is well stated in paragraph 10 of your letter. Assuming that Ibn Saud’s neutrality would in fact suit H.M.G. best - an assumption which may to some extent depend on the views of the Service Departments regarding the Nejd route - it does seem that nevertheless it would be most unfortunate if he bound h imself to Germany to remain neutral. One can quite see Germany making the most of such an agreement as another diplomatic defeat for/ H.L. Baggallay, Esq.wmm for Moreover, the kind of agreement which the Germans suggest seems to smack of neutrality our prestige in the Middle East, and we should imagine elsewhere, would surely he very had. At this stage would it not suffice that the gist of our reply to Ihn Saud should simply he to ask him what were the arms which he was expecting -to receive from that quarter. H.M.G. might then consider more at leisure whether they could not do something more than they are doing already to help him in the matter of arms. £125,000 seems a very modest political credit for Saudi Arabia, having regard to its importance, especially if credits to the tune of millions are being considered for Persia. Part of what you have drafted in paragraph 21 of your letter could he used for a reply advising benevolent to Germany.

SKZmJK* K^gwrfC^' FOREIGN OFFICE, S. \7. 1. 22rd August, 1939, Sir, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to transmit to you herewith, for the information of the Army Council, the accompanying copies of two telegrams from His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Jedda, conveying a message from Ibn Saud to His Majesty's Government in regard to the question of his neutrality in the event of a war between this country and Germany, 2 e It will be seen that the German Government have informed Ibn Saud that they do not feel able to furnish him with certain arms for v/hich he has been in negotiation for some weeks past, unless he will make an agreement to remain neutral in any dispute into which they may be drawn with this country; and that Ibn Saud has asked His Majesty’s Government to supply him with their views upon this question ’'without ambiguity, ' 3. So far as the question of Saudi Arabian neutrality is concerned, Lord Halifax inclines to take the view that it would be more convenient for His Majesty's Government if Ibn Saud v/ere to remain neutral in the event of a war between the Great Powers than if he were to become r their ally, provided at any rate, that the enemies of His Majesty’s Government did not include any other Middle Eastern State c With the exception of the Kowei t-N’e jd- Trans j'ordan/ The Unde r-Sec re t ary of State, War Office, / ——— ■TjcansJordan route (which is dealt with below), his territory is, His Lordship presumes, likely to be of little use to British forces in the event of hostilities. His armed support would be of even less value. Furthermore, his territory produces no commodity of which His Majesty’s Government would be likely to stand in urgent need in time of war and which he could not supply without indulging in unneutral conduct. The knowledge that he was well disposed towards His Majesty’s Government would no doubt impress Arabs elsewhere and prove a valuable asset to the Allied cause. But it ought to be possible for his good-will to be manifested v/ithout any departure from technical neutrality. 4. Furthermore, Ibn Saud would be likely to prove an exacting ally. He would almost certainly expect His Majesty’s Government to supply him, both before and after the outbreak of hostilities, with arms and money, which they could ill spare, on a much larger scale than they have yet contemplated; he would expect His Majesty’s Governrrent to divert some part of their forces for the protection of his territory; and, in the event of a final victory, he would expect rewards in many forms, including territory belonging not to His Majesty’s Government but to other Arab rulers, which His Majesty’s Government would probably find it as difficult to give him then as they do nov/. The fact that His Majesty’s Government would find it so difficult to reward him Tr m^cmo +nn +/hn+. pynpnt. for .q ome dos s ib le presentsIMi—I— —I I I— , H—&gt;—I5. There seems, then, to he no reason at first sight why His Majesty's Government should wish Ibn Saud to do anything but maintain his neutrality in the event of a general conflict. This conclusion must, however, be qualified by the existence of the Koweit-Ne jd-Trans jordan route. : 6. Lord Halifax understands that the preliminary investigations made by Captain de Gaury, the Political Agent at Kov/eit, on his recent journey have shown that the route leading from Koweit through northern Saudi-Arabia to Amman in Transjordan can be developed for motor transport with comparatively little trouble and expense, but that the War Office would desire to have the route inspected by a technical officer before forming an opinion as to how far, if at all, it would be worth while spending public money upon its improvement. His Lordship also understands that, although the War Office see no strong reason to doubt that the Iraqi Government would at need fulfil their obligations under the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance of 1930, they would nevertheless, other things being equal, welcome the creation of a route for the movement of troops between Koweit and the Mediterranean alternative to the present route through Iraq; for this reason they would be glad if permission could be obtained for a further investigation of the route by a technical officer, provided that the mere fact of such permission having been sought would not involve them in any obligation, moral or otherwise, to assist the Saudi Arabian Government in improving the route should it prove capable of improvement. 7. Lord Halifax has under separate consideration the question of approaching the Saudi-Arabian Government for _ permission for a visit by a technical officer. So far as His/His Lordship can see at present, this permission might be sought, and help afforded to the Saudi Arabian Government in improving the route, without any question of Sauai Arabia’s departure from neutrality at a future date arising, since the route could be ostensibly - even if a little unconvincingly - developed for commercial purposes. His Majesty’s Government would, however, have little interest in the development of the route unless they had some prospect of being able to use it in an hour of need; and they could not use it unless they were able to persuade Ibn Saud to become their ally, or at any rate to perform acts of so unneutral a character as to expose himself to the possibility of being treated as a belligerent by the 8. In the ordinary way it might not be necessary to come to any final conclusion about this question at trhb present time. His Majesty’s Government might decide that. remain neutral in a future conflict and yet keep in mind the possibility of persuading him to depart from neutrality should they findibr any reason, such as hostility on the part of the Iraqi Government, or an insurrection in Iraq, that the use of the Basra-Bagdad-Transjordan route was enemies of this country. so far as they could see, they would prefer Ibn Saud toneutral and is hereafter given no ground hy Germany or her partners for repudiating this undertaking, 10 o This raises in a direct form the question of the reply to he sent to Ibn saud. It is one thing to wish Ibn Saud to remain neutral and even to adivse him that he would do well to remain neutral,, It is quite another to have him promise a prospective enemy of this country that he will remain neutral, and a fortio ri to advise him to do so e 11 0 Much, however, depends upon the form the agreement takeso One alternative would be for Ibn Saud to sign a formal Agreement, with clauses in the usual form to the effect that neither party will join with third Powers in qny activities prejudicial to the interests of the other party and that if either party becomes involved in war with third Powers, the other party will refrain from joining those PowerSo If Ibn Saud were to conclude an Agreement 1 of th„s kind, his action would undoubtedly be interpreted by many people as an indication that his sympathies lay with the Central Powers, and the results, so far as the prestige of His Majesty’s Government in the Middle East is concerned, might be serious. The ill-effects of such an Agreement might to some extent be neutralised by giving publicity to the fact that Ibn Saud had consulted His Majesty ; s Government before making this agreement, and had been informed by them that they had no objection to, and even approved, the prospect of his remaining neutral in a conflict between the great Powers. But such counter-propaganda could not be expected to undo the ill-effects altogether. A further possible counter-measure w ou Id/would be to press Ibn Saud to sign a similar Agreement with the United Kingdom. 12. There would, on the other hand, be less objection (although Lord Halifax does not suggest that there would be no objection) to a second alternative procedure i.e. a general declaration by Ibn Baud of his intention to maintain his neutrality in any conflict between the Great Powers, or indeed in any conflicts which might arise between any other Powers whatsoever, subject only to his obligations under the Treaty (with Iraq) of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance of the Pnd April, 1936, as modified by the Agreement with the Yemen of the 29th April, 1937 e Such declarations, although unusual in advance of the outbreak of war, are not unknown, and as Saudi Arabia is not a Member of the League of Nations there appears to be no juridic al reason why a declaration of this kind should not be made, subject, as already indicated, to the treaty obligations into which Saudi Arabia has already entered of her own accord. If such a general declaration were made, Ibn Saud could communicate copies to any Governments he chose, including the German Government.. 13. The obligations under the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance are, it may be noted in passing, of a somewhat indefinite character, and although the Treaty is called a Treaty of Alliance its/its terms do not seem to impose an absolute obligation upon the parties to resort to arms in support of any one among them who is attacked--. 14, A third alternative procedure, and possibly the least objectionable of all, would be for Ibn Saud simply to send a message to the German Government to the effect that he could not agree that his friendship for His Majesty’s O-overirnent was inconsistent with friendship for Germany or any other country, that he had signed no treaty of alliance with any Great Power, that his policy aimed at impartial friendship with all Powers alike and that so far as he was concerned the question of his taking sides m any conflict between the great Powers had not even arisen. It is doubtful, however, as Mr, Trolc surmises, whether the German Government would find this answer adequate for their purpose, 15, A complication is in any case created by the German references to propaganda, military matters and 'any other thing which might affect 'friendly relations' . as recorded m the first of the two telegrams from His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires These are a little difficult to understand, although they seem likely to refer to matters which might arise in advance of an actual outbreak of hostilities and to indicate a desire that in ordinary times Ibn Saud should hold an even balance in the favours he grants to this country and Germany, 16, Ibn Baud/16 . Ibn Saud can clearly not control propaganda carried on by wireless and other means from outside his own territories. As regards propaganda inside his territories, he has so far set his face against it, no matter from what quarter it emanates, and so long as he continues to pursue this policy impartially there is no reason for His Majesty’s Government to object. 17. As regards military matters, this may be a reference to the acceptance of military ar technical missionso There is nothing inconsistent with impartial friendship, and even with neutrality, in the acceptance of a military mission, whether its members hold executive or advisory functions, from one country and not from another. It is, on the other hand, open to the German Government, who are not under any obligation whatsoever to supply Saudi Arabia with arms or credits, to make any conditions which they please before they do so. The prospects of His Majesty’s Government being themselves able to spare money or personnel for, e.g., an air mission to Saudi Arabia, on the lines discussed at various times in the last few years are at present small* A decision by Ibn Saud to exclude missions from all great Pov/ers alike would not necessarily therefore be contrary to the interests of His Majesty’s Government. 18. To sum up, there are many reasons why His Majesty’s Government might wish to dissuade Ibn Saud from accepting the German proposal, quite apart from the question of the'“N Nejd route 0 as against these reasons can he set only one positive reason for encouraging him to do so: that it might force the German Government to furnish him with arms and credits with which they are clearly reluctant to part and for which they are ILkely to receive little return„ 19. But although the positive reasons for encouraging Ibn Saud to promise his neutrality to Germany may be of small importance the disadvantages of any attempt at dissuasion are far-rcaching* In particular His Majesty’s Government would incur a heavy degree of responsibility towards Ibn Saud m the matter of his rearmament ? and the least His Majesty’s Government would have to do would be to make it clear that? should he follow their advice, they could not undertake to do all that Germany would otherwise have done as a supplier of arms or credits, 20o The question of how far the possibility of using the Koweit—Nejd-Transjordan route should affect any action which His Majesty's Government might otherwise think the most suitable to the occasion is one which His Lordship must leave to the appreciation of the Service Departments. It will naturally simplify the problem? however, if the Service Departments feel able to decide that the importance to be attached to the use of this route is not great enough to affect whatever action is otherwise desirable. If they decide that the route’s prospective importance is so great that every effort should be made to prevent Ibn Saud from committing himself to a policy of neutrality, /appropriateappropriate instructions will have to be sent to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, ''lays and means will also have to be devised of increasing substantially the allotment of £125,000 at present earmarked for ’’political” credits for Saudi Arabia, as well as the amount of arms which can be supplied against those credits* On the question of the prospective danger of the Iraq route being interrupted, Lord Halifax can only express the opinion that although unfriendly Iraqi governments or internal troubles in Iraq are always possible, he sees no reason to doubt that the Iraqi government will fulfil its obligationso 21. If, on the other hand, the Service Departments feel that the question of the Nejd route is not conclusive Lord Halifax suggests that the reply of His Majesty’s Government should be on the following lines:- ”His Majesty’s Government are most grateful to ’’King Abdul Aziz for having given them the opportunity ”of expressing their views upon the message from the ’’German Government. This mark of confidence is a ’’further signal proof of the friendship which he has ’’shown to His Majesty’s Government in so many v/ays in ’’the past, ”His Majesty’s Government suggest that, in ’’deciding on his reply to the German Government, the ’’King should bear in mind the following considerations ”(a) His Majesty’s Government think it only ’’right, and in accordance with the friendship which /’’exists'exists between themselves and the King, to state 'frankly that in their opinion he will best serve 'his own interests and those of Saudi Arabia by 'remaining neutral in any conflict between the 'Great Powers. If he does so, they do not think it 'at all likely that any of these Powers will violate 'his neutrality. The position might be different if 'hostilities were to spread to the Middle Past as the 'result of any Middle Pastern State joining the Central 'powers. In that case the chances of the Central 'Powers winning the war would be increased and as the 'victory of those Powers would mean the end of true 'freedom for all the States of the Middle hast it 'might be in the interests of Saudi Arabia to help in 'subduing the Middle Pastern State which had joined the 'enemy. '(b) His Majesty’s Government also think it only 'right to state frankly that if the King fails for 'v/hatever reason, to obtain from Germany the arms and 'credits for which he is now in negotiation, it is 'highly unlikely that they will be able to supply him 'with these arms or credits themselves. They do not 'know the nature or value of the German arms, but at 'the present time all the arms and all the money they 'can spare are needed for their own rearmament and that 'of other countries which are likely (as Saudi Arabia 'is not) to be objects of attack, or the scene of 'hostilities, in the event of war.'(c) There is, however, a great difference ''between forming an intention to preserve one’s 'neutrality, provided it is respected by other Powers, 'and entering into an agreement with another Power to 'preserve it in circumstances which have not yet arisen. 'Neither the King nor any other statesman can foresee 'exactly how his country's interests will be affected 'in the event of general hostilities and most 'governments aim at keeping for themselves as much 'freedom of action in the matter of belligerency or 'neutrality as circumstances permit. '(d) Moreover, were the King to sign a formal 'Agreement of this kind with the German Government, 'this would be interpreted by ignorant and thoughtless 'persons, of whom there are only too many in every 'country, as an indication that his sympathies lay with 'the Central Powers. This in its turn might have 'a most unfortunate effect upon the prestige of His 'Majesty’s Government throughout the Middle Past. 'His Majesty's Government hope that the King will agree 'that, for the reasons given under (a) respecting the 'result of a German victory, any action v/hich added 'to the difficulties of His Majesty’s Government and 'their Allies, either in advance of or during a war, 'would be disastrous from the point of view of the 'Middle Eastern States themselves. '(e) a general declaration addressed by the King 'to the v/orld at large (and communicated by him, if he 'so desired, to the German and other Governments) 'stating his intention to preserve his neutrality 'provided it were respected by others would be less 'objectionable* He would presumably make an exceotion 'for his obligations, in so far as they are relevant, /under'under the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance 0 'As Saudi Arabia is not a member of the League of 'Nations, there appears to be no juridical reason 'why such a declaration should not be made» '(f) Better still? the King might send the 'German Government an oral or at any rate an informal 'message to the effect that he does not agree that 'friendship for Great Britain is inconsistent with 'friendship for Germany or any other State, that his 'policy aims at friendship with all States alike? 'that he has signed no treaty of alliance with any 'great power and that so far as he is concerned the 'question of his taking sides in any conflict between 'the Great Powers had not even arisen. His Majesty’s 'Government realise, however? that such a message may 'not meet the requirements of the German Government, 'who are clearly under no obligation to supply Saudi 'Arabia with arms or credits and free to make what 'conditions they like before they do so.

His Majesty’s Government 'consider that this is a right and natural course 'for the King to pursue, although they hope that in the 'event of actual hostilities he would feel able, within 'the limits imposed by international law upon a 'neutral, to make it clear that in his view the 'victory of the Allied Powers was desirable in the 'interests of the Arab States.

At 'the same time, although His Majesty's Government are 'always anxious in principle to assist the King in any 'way they can, the demand upon their resources at the 'present time is so great that it is improbable that 'they could themselves spare officers for such missions, 'even if the King were to invite them to do so.

'At the same time, as they have already frankly admitted, 'the help which they can themselves give him in the 'matter of arms and credits is strictly limited.

Dear Thorley, I enclose copies of a telegram from Jedda and of a record of a discussion between Baggallay and Zada, of the Saudi Arabian Legation, regarding the proposed credits to Saudi Arabia for certain armaments purchases. 2. You will see that the Saudi Government now require, in addition to the cartridge factory and raw material for it, 3,500,000 rounds of new ammunition (instead of a similar quantity of old war-time stock) and 200 Hotchkiss guns. This brings the total cost up to rather more than the £70,000 which it was proposed to offer under the credits, and leaves nothing over with which to buy rifles. 3. The Saudi Government are evidently anxious to have as many rifles as they can get, and since the total credit offered is still well below the maximum of £125,000 available for C.G. Thorley, Esq. Export Credits Guarantee Department.for Saudi Arabia, we would suggest that the sum of £10,000, which it was originally proposed to allot for the purchase of rifles, should be added to the total of £73,500 required for the other armaments. 4. I should therefore be very grateful if you would let me know whether the Export Credits Guarantee Department agree to the raising of the amount of credits offered to Saudi Arabia to about £85,000. Copies of this letter are being sent to all the departments represented on the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee, to the Department of Overseas Trade, Board of Trade, and to the Secretary of the Allied Demands Sub-C ommi tt e e.

Zada, the Secretary of the Saudi Arabian Legation, called here this afternoon in connexion with the offer made to the Saudi Arabian Government by His Majesty’s Government last May of credits for certain armaments purchases which they wish to make in this country. 2. M. Zada said that, according to a telegram which he had just received from the Saudi Arabian Government, they had now agreed with His Majesty’s Legation upon the following purchases:- (a) 200 Hotchkiss guns at £12 each, with all accessories and in good condition; (b) 3,500,000 rounds of new 303” cartridges at £5 per thousand rounds; (c) The cartridge-making factory, as already offered; (d) Raw material for the factory, ditto. (e) Any sum remaining over after these requests had been satisfied to be devoted to the purchase of British rifles in new condition. 3. I told M. Zada that, so far as I was aware, no particular agreement had been reached with His Majesty’s Legation, but that Mr. Trott had reported that the Saudi Arabian Government now required 200 Hotchkiss guns and 3,500,000 rounds of new anmunition. 4. We then checked together the figures involved in thei the new Saudi Arabian demands and agreed that the position was as follows:- (i) Original offer . £. (a) Cartridge factory . 28,000 (b) Raw material 25,000 (c) 3,500,000 rounds of old ammunition * 3,000 (d) Rifles 10,000 Total £66,000 ( i i) New request , £. (a) Cartridge factory 28,000 (b) Raw material 25,000 (c) 3,500,000 rounds of new ammunition 18,000 (d) 200 Hotchkiss guns 2,500 Total £73,500 There was therefore, in reality, nothing left over with which to buy rifles. These, as we both agreed, probably referred to the offer of B.S.A. rifles at about £8.10.0 each which had recently been communicated to the Saudi Arabian Government. Moreover, the new request, even without the rifles, came to more than what had originally been offered. 5. I told M. Zada that this request would be considered as quickly as possible. In the meanwhile I thought it better forfor him not to make any approach to Messrs. Greenwood &amp; Batley (the suppliers of the cartridge factory) to ascertain whether their prices had risen, as indeed they might have done. It would be better that I should consult the Export Credits Guarantee Department before he took any step of this kind. (Signed) L.

Foreign Office. 3rd May, 1939. 6.55.p.m. No. 75. oOo Your telegram No. 43 [of March 29th: credits for Saudi-Arabiaj- You may inform Saudi-Arabian Government that His Majesty's Government agree in principle to assist them to acquire on credit:- (a) cartridge factory, (b) some raw material for this factory (sj up to 3,500,000 rounds of war-time *303° ammunition, (d) rifles or machine-guns from this country. 2. Price of (a) c.i.f. Jedda is nearly £28,000. This includes machinery shipped from here and cost of sending out experts to erect it, but not the building (nothing elaborate is needed) to house the machinery or local labour. 3. Price of (b) is at present (when prices are high) rather over £4,000 per 1,000,000 rounds. His Majesty’s Government have in mind quantity sufficient for about 6,000,000 rounds (say £25,000). But for reasons given in letter from Mr. Baggallay to Export Credits Guarantee Department enclosed in my despatch No. 106 [of April 15th] it is not contemplated that this would all be acquired straight away. 4. Price of (c) is 16/- for 1,000 rounds £2,800 in all without freight etc.). This quantity is all ./ar Office have to offer, as it is unlikely that anything can be done to ensure delivery • •••••f delivery of (a) at earlier date than Greenwood and Batley have mentioned, Saudi-Arabian Government may thinic it desirable to take full quantity. 5. Sum His Majesty’s Government propose for (d) is £10,000. ..ar Office have no second-hand rifles for disposal, but orders for both rifles and machine-guns can be placed with the trade. There may be some delay owing to Army expansion in this country. But if given particulars of types and quantities required War Office will be glad to help with advice generally. 6. Terms His Majesty’s Government have in mind are that Saudi-Arabian Government should undertake to repay all the credits (including that for factory, for which they have suggested paying firm in annual instalments) at end of five years and in the mean while pay only interest. Export Credits Guarantee Department propose to arrange, if practicable, a global guarantee arrangement, so that a number of separate contracts can be avoided. 7. It is, however, important that if Saudi-Arabian Government decide to accept this offer, or any part of it, no further steps should be taken to place orders until Saudi-Arabian Legation have discussed financial details with Export Credits Guarantee Depart- rnent* who will, bo aiCLe to-indicate, the lines on which a global agreement could be prepared. 8. Please telegraph as soon as practicable whether these suggestions are agreeable to Saudi-Arabian Government. This applies especially to (c) for which there are other would-be purchasers.My dear Stirling, You may remember that I spoke to you before Easter about the possibility of using some of the £10,000,000 credits now available under Section 4 of the export Credits Guarantee Act in order to assist Saudi / Arabia to buy arms and ammunition in this country and, particularly, a cartridge-making factory on which Ibn Saud has set hie heart. 2. The position as regards the use of the special credits for assisting Saudi Arabia is that when the inter—departmental committee set up for the purpose made a provisional allocation of these credits between different countries, a sum of £250,000 was set aside to be divided between Persia and Saudi Arabia. It seemed likely at that time that cases would arise in connexion with both C.fo. Stirling, Esq«, O.D,E7 Export Credits Guarantee Department. countriescountries where credits of some amount could usefully he employed, but it was not known how much money would be needed for each and no attempt was made to apportion the £250,000 between the two. 3. /hen, however, the question arose quite recently of using some of the £250,000 in order to assist this country in maintaining its present position with respect to the sale of aircraft to Persia, it was agreed that the sum to be used for this purpose, if the necessary conditions were fulfilled, should not exceed £125,000 i.e. one-half of the total sum available. 4. For the purposes of the present discussion, therefore, the maximum sum at present available for Saudi Arabia must, I think, also be placed at £1 2 b non.during the difficult times of the last few years with even the most meagre concessions to his territorial claims makes it particul.arly dusirable that we should make our gesture before the White Paper on Palestine appears (which will probably be on the 24th April) or at any rate very soon afterwards * S» The importance of the question is stressed in Jedda telegram No 0 43 of the 29th March, of which I enclose a copy, together with copies, for convenience, of Jedda telegrams Nos 0 37 of the 16th March and 42 of the 25th March, to which it referso Finally, there are, as the telegrams show, two concrete cases in which Ibn Saud would like our help, and it is always easier to deal with such questions in the concrete than the abstract e 8 e The first case is that of the cartridge-making factory which Ibn Saud wishes to buy from Messrs. Greenwood and Batley, Albion works, Leeds. Zada, the Saudi Arabian Chargd d Affaires, has been to see me at my request and has given me full particulars of these negotiations, together with copies of correspondence showing what the SaudiSaudi Arabian Government want in the way of credit* delivery, etc 0 and what the firm are prepared to give# This correspondence consists of a memorandum of the Saudi conditions which v/as apparently sent to the firm by the Saudi Arabian Legation on the 3rd January, of this year and three letters from the firm dated the 6th February, 10th February and the 15th February respectively® Zada expressed the opinion, incidentally, that the delay in the negotiations was in no way the fault of the firm. 9 0 I enclose copies of the correspondence left with me by Zada and for this correspondence you will see: (a) The price Coiof. Jedda of the machinery etc® to be shipped from this country, including the cost of sending out experts to erect it and train Saudi operatives in its use, is £27,643 0 (b) The Saudi Arabian Government would in addition have to supply, or meet the cost of supplying, a building of simple construction to house the machinery and the local unskilled labour necessary for its erection cm W X (c) The Saudi Arabian Government would have to pay separately for the raw material necessary to start the factory and keep it running* This raw material wir,:. apparently cost about £4,000 for 1,000,000 rounds of o303' ammunition and rather more for 1 P 000,000 rounds of Mauser ammunition 0 (d) The Saudi Arabian Government wish to pay one-fifth of the price with the order and the remaining four-fifths in five yearly instalments: whereas the firm want one- third of the price with the order and the balance against deliveries 6 (e) The Saudi Arabian Government want delivery within six months of the order: whereas the firm cannot promise delivery in less than two years. 10. With regard to point (o), Zada told me that in spite of what the firm say about the inadvisability of buying all at once a six years' supply of raw material, he thinks the Saudi Arabian Government would prefer to have a large rlarge supply in the country owing to the possibility of further supplies being interrupted in case of hostilitiese It seems that they have taken into account the fact that the last war lasted four or five years, and think that it would in consequence be prudent on their part to lay in at least a six years’ supply against the next war. 11• I pointed out to Zada that, on the assumption that the cartridge factory turned out no more than 20,000 rounds a day for no more than 300 days in the year, this would mean an annual production of 6,000,000 rounds* Since the raw material for 1,000,000 rounds apparently cost about £4,000 (a little over in the case of Mauser ammunition) this meant that the raw material for one year’s output v/ould cost the Saudi Arabian Government some £25,000 o It might be that the Saudi Arabian Government would not think it necessary to turn out anything like this number of rounds a year, but if they did so a six years’ supply would cost them something like £150,000, a sum which completely overshadowed the original cost of the factory,, Zada said he had never worked this out before and did not think the Saudi Arabian Government had done so either 0 It seemed to him that the cost of the raw material was very heavy,heavy, seeing that, according to his information, •303'’ ammunition could he bought in the market for about £5,000 for 1,000,000 rounds, whereas the cost of raw material as quoted by Greenwood and Batley was about £4,000 for 1,000,000 rounds. This meant that the Saudi Arabian Government would only save about £1,000 per 1,000,000 rounds by manufacturing the ammunition themselves. I said this might be vso, but that although I had no idea of the cost of these things it seemed to me quite likely that the cost of the raw material represented the ma/jor mart of the price of the finished rounds of ammunition. 12. I have since heard from Zada that since our conversation he has had a further discussion about raw material with Greenwood and Batley. They repeated their advice not to buy too much raw material now owing to prices bei.v, exceodia 1 r hi h and to the fact that they may be lower in two years time, when the factory would start working. They suggested that the Saudi Arabian Government should not order now more material than is required for 1,000,000 rounds of .303” ammunition and 1,000,000 rounds of bauser. 13. I do not kno' T what the Saudi Arabian Government will eventually want done about raw material, but in any case it seems£0 seems that we could help Ibn Saud to acquire the actual cartridge-factory, which may or may not be a wise investment on his part, but is one on which, as I have said, he has set his heart, for under £50,000* This sum is small compared with most of those with which we have to deal in these days, but the gratification which he is likely to feel if we can respond quickly is likely to be out of all proportion to its size* '/e very much hone, therefore, that it will be possible for us to tell hi”' soon, and at any rate before the end of the month, that if in spite of the cost of raw material he still wishes to buy his cartridge factory we will assist him to do so on the conditions as regards payment which he has himself proposed, and will furthermore assist him to buy some raw material to start it 14. This raises as a separate issue the question of when and how the proposed promise about raw material could best be implemented. There does not seem to be any particular need to buy now material which will not be needed for two years, especially if prices are likely to go down, on the other hand, prices might go up and the suggestion of Greenv/ood and Batley that a small amount sufficient for 2 , 000,000■■■ 2,000,000 rounds should be bought may be a wise precaution. Saudi Arabian Government that we would help them straight away to buy material for 2,000,000 rounds on long term credits. This is especially the case, if there v/ould be any difficulty on your part about promising to give credits in respect of a transaction which was not to take place for two years. But in either event we should regard material for no more than 2,000,000 rounds as being less less than the total amount we ought to help them to buy at the time when, or before, the factory started work. '■Ie would put the total amount at something like 6,000,000 15.. But although we may be able to help Ibn Saud over the financial aspects of his proposed order, I doubt whether we can help him over the question of the date of delivery. Greenwood and Batley presumably have sound reasons for saying that the completion of the order cannot be guaranteed in less than two years, and it does not seem likely that anything which any Government department can do or say will render it possible to reduce the period. If so, we should be glad if it were possible to tell the than the Saudi Arabian Government’s real requirements and rounds. IfIf this is so, the second concrete case in ^hich Ihn Saud would like our help assumes additional importance. 16* This second case i.u that of a proposed purchase of rifles and small arms ammunition, particularly the latter 0 In this connexion I enclose a copy of a letter from Harding of the 7ar Office showing that (a) the 7ar Office have for sale 3,500,000 rounds of 303 M small arms ammunition of war-time manufacture. (h) This ammunition could he sold at 16/- for 1,000 rounds or £2,800 for the lot. (c) The War Office have no rifles for disposal. 17 0 To take the ammunition first, the sum involved is very small, and in this case again we should much like to he ahle to tell Ihn Saud as soon as possible, and at any rate before the end of the month, that although we are unlikely to he ahle to do anything to help him obtain his cartridge factory before two years are out, we can and will supply him straight away with 3,500,000 or any lesser amount of rounds of war-time 303 M ammunition at 16/- for 1,000 rounds on long term credits - say five to ten years.mOMn^WM h 18, The question of rifles is more complicated,, Although the Tar Office have none to sell, they could doubtless be supplied by one of the usual manufacturers e But we do not know for certain that Ibn Baud particularly wants more 303' rifles. In fact we have some reason to think that he would prefer German rifles, mainly no doubt because he thinks they are cheaper, but also, perhaps, because he wishes to avoid too great a variety in the armament of his forces* 19* In this connexion I enclose a copy of a despatch fir-om Havard at Beirut transmitting an interesting exchange of letters between a certain Mr. Francis Kettaneh and a young Syrian employed in the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Finance.- This despatch is part of a correspondence which has been going on with Havard and Bullard for some little time about a consignment of Hotchkiss machine-guns which Kettaneh is trying to sell to Saudi Arabia* The details of this correspondence are not relevant to the present question, but I send the despatch for the sake of the light it throws on the question of Saudi arms purchases. I add that although Kettaneh has been suspected of some rather doubtful commercial transactions in the past, Havard hashas a high opinion of him 8 In the present case he does seem to he doing his hest to sell British arms in competition with German arms, 20, To judge from what Bullard and Kettaneh have been told, the question of what Ibn Saud wants in the way of rifles or machine-guns is somewhat obscure. Possibly Ibn Saud does not really know himself. In any case the question is a technical one which it may take some little time to resolve, and in the meanwhile we should like to be able to round off our response to Ibn Saud's request for assistance by promising him long term credits for rifles or machine-guns to be acquired in this country. The sum which we have in mind is £10,000, 21* To sum up, we think it important that, if possible by the 24th April, and at any rate by the 30th April, His Majesty's Government should tell Ibn Saud that they are prepared, as a mark of good will and in response to his recent enquiry, to furnish credits which will enable him (a) to acquire the cartridge factory for which he is in negotiation with Greenwood and Batley upon the terms, so far as finance13 finance is concerned, which he has offered. (Id) tc acquire in this country (hut not necessarily straight away) raw material sufficient for 6,000,000 rounds for use in the factory, to he repaid between five and ten years from delivery. (c) to acquire from the -^ar Office anything up to 3,500,000 rounds of 303' f small arms ammunition at 16/- for 1,000 rounds, to he repaid between five years and ten years from delivery. (d) to acquire in this country rifles and machine-guns up to a total value of £10,000, to he repaid between five years and ten years from delivery, the types and prices to he determined later,, 22« I ought to add that this question is to some extent hound up with a recommendation made by the Middle East (official) Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence in a report of the 13th July, 1938, dealing with measures which might he taken straight away (i.e. without waiting for a state of war or imminent war) to influence ArabVi tArab States and minor (Eastern) Powers. This recommendation was that any future opportunity of meeting the arms requirements of the Kings of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen should as far as possible be met, the prices quoted being as low and the terms of payment as easy as possible. The Committee of Imperial Defence and the Cabinet subsequently agreed that the Service Department should consider requests for the supply of arms as and when they arose. We may assume, I think, that the framers of^ho-S©- recommendations had something hardly distinguishable from gifts in mind. In the present case we are not suggesting that the cartridge factory, or the rifles or ammunition, should be given to Ibn Saud outright, but we are probably suggesting something very like it. Ibn Saud has no security to offer for credits and even if he had given security he would almost certainly expect to be excused re-payment when the time came if he had been our good friend in the intervening years.

They offered impossible terms of payment and wanted delivery in six months instead of twenty- four. Ibn Saud now regards the possession of the factory as essential. This was one of the points mentioned to the German Minister but there is no reply from Germany. 2. Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on instructions from Ibn Saud asks whether His Majesty's Government can help. I reminded him how busy His Majesty’s Government and the armament firms in the United Kingdom are with our own work but promised to report to you. All necessary correspondence is at the Saudi Legation. I do not see what form assistance could take unless under Exports Credit scheme, and it is by no means certain that the factory would be a success if it were established here, but rearmament is a matter of the greatest interest to the King and any help we could give would be appreciated by him and therefore useful to us at this juncture. 3.

(January 3rd. 1939.)Cepy Ref:- T/8672 GREENWOOD Sc. BATLEY, LTD. 8 ALBION WORKS, LEEDS. 6th February 1939. Sir, Our quotation dated 24th July, 1937, for plant for the manufacture of Small Arms Cartridges . Further to the conversation you had with Mr. J.R. Symes of Richman, Symes &amp; Company, Limited, on the 2nd January, and your letter to him of the 3rd January, 1939 wherein you gave him a list of the conditions laid down by your Government regarding our tender for the small arms Cartridge Factory, we have gone into the various questions raised and have the honour to give you the following information:- 1. Daily Output of pla nt. The cartridge plant offered in cur above mentioned quotation would be suitable for the production of 20,000 to 25,000 cartridges per eight hour day. This production could be increased to 30,000 per day if required, if the working day were longer than eight hours. 2. Type of Cartridge to be manufactured . We have pleasure in confirming that as stated in Our estimate the plant offered is suitable for the manufacture of both 7.9 m/m German Mauser and British .303 M ammunition. 3./ The Secretary, Revyal Legation of Saudi Arabia, 115, Ebury Street, London, S.W.l.5. Spare parts and Guarantee . All the machinery and tools supplied hy us for the factory would be of the highest class, and would be complete with their accessories. It is unusual to supply spare parts for such machines as these are generally unnecessary. Although we have many machines similar to those offered which are working satisfactorily after more than 20 years service, and are perfectly confident the machines offered would last more than this time, it is quite unusual to give a specific guarantee for 10 years as suggested by your Government, The greatest care is given to the designing and building of our machines, and * we have never been asked to give such a guarantee by any other Government. As a case in point, the Iraq Government have been working these machines for a number of years and there has been no instance of a machine proving faulty. All the machines would, of course, be carefully tested and inspected before despatch, and would be guaranteed for 12 months in accordance with clause 14 of our conditions of Sale ’'TE' attached, we delivering any repaired or new parts f.o.b. English port. There should, therefore, be no need for the ten years guarantee suggested by the Government of Saudi Arabia. Tools . It will be appreciated that on account of the large amount of work which they have to perform in producing so many thousands of Cartridges per day, the Punches, hies and other Tools used in the Cartridge Machines/Machines naturally suffer a certain amount of wear. The result of using Tools worn 'beyond a certain point is that it is no longer possible to produce Cartridge components with the requisite degree of accuracy to ensure good firing and shooting. It is therefore necessary to replace the Tools when the wear has reached such a point that the Tools cannot be satisfactorily re-conditioned by grinding and re-hardening. The foregoing remarks are, of course, applicable to the manufacture of Cartridges in any Country and on machinery of whatever origin whether supplied by ourselves or other manufacturers. It will be noted from our tender of the 24th July, 1937, T/8672A, that we included in Section E for the supply of the following Tools, and Gauges:- Necessary Tools for the manufacture of 1,000,000 Cartridges .303’' calibre, MkoVII Two sets of Working Gauges for the manufacture of .303' Cartridge Tools, One set of Check Gauges for the manufacture of .303' Cartridge Tools, One set of Inspection Gauges for ,303' Cartridge Tools. Necessary Tools for the manufacture of 1,000,000 Mauser Cartridges, 7.9 m/m calibre. Two sets of Working Gauges for the manufacture of 7.9 m/m Mauser Cartridge Tools, One set of Check Gauges for the manufacture of 7.9 m/m Mauser Cartridge Tools. One set of Inspection Gauges for 7,9 m/m Mauser Cartridge Tools. in/In Section J we included for Machines for the manufacture and upkeep of Tools, etc* Our experience over long years in our own Factory as actual manufacturers of Small Arms Cartridges enables us to supply Tools of the most suitable material and finish for the duties requiredc Further, our experts referred to elsewhere in this letter would instruct the Saudi Government’s Cartridge Factory Staff in the best methods of using and re-conditioning the Tools to obtain the longest possible life consistent with efficient cartridge manufacture, and would instruct them in the use of the machines in the T:ol Room Plant included in Section J. Supplies of material for the manufacture of Tools, or supplies of further Tools could be undertaken by us if required, at an extra price according to the rates ruling at the time of supply, 4. Engineers f cr conducti ng work of Factory and t raining of yo ur j^ers onnel 0 As indicated on page 4 of our letter of 24th July, 1937, our tender includes for the services of three experts for a period of twelve months at the factory, for supervising erection, and for demonstrating the operation of the planto These experts, as stated in our tender, would demonstrate each machine, showing that it was capable of the production specifiedo It would not, of course, be fair to ask us to accept responsibility for all other operatives in the factory, as these would be obtained locally in Saudi Arabia. We would suggest that if the necessary permission can be obtained from the British Government Authorities here/s here, some of your own Engineers should be sent to our Works for training. From our own experience in Iraq, we do not anticipate that the training of local operatives would present any serious difficulties, 5. Daily Production . There is no question but that this plant, when installed, would be capable of producing 20 to 25 thousand rounds of ammunition per day of b working hours. Time, of course, must be given for all workers to be thoroughly trained. As stated in paragraph 4 above, the experts would supervise and help to train your operatives. It would, therefore, not be fair to ask us to accept responsibility and liability for production, as the efficiency of the operators would be a factor entirely unknown to us. 6. Erection of Machinery. This company, as stated in our tender, would supply three men fully competent to supervise the erection of the machinery on the site chosen. All necessary unskilled labour and labour other than the three experts referred to above, to be provided by the Government of Saudi Arabia. 7. Electri c G enerat_ing_Pla nt . The electric generating plant required to run the Factory is included in our tender, and the erection and putting to work of this machinery would be carefully controlled by one or more of the three experts covered for in our tender. It should be noted that all foundations, piping, wiring, drainage and ventilation plant would require to be supplied by the Building Contractor, as this work is not covered by cur tender. 8-/8. Drawings of Buildings . This Company would supply drawings showing the buildings necessary for the Factory and would give all possible assistance in recommending where the Factory should be placed. The Company, if required, would be prepared to send an Architect or other competent person to supervise the erection of the buildings, but this must be at the expense of the Government of Saudi Arabia, but we do not think that this would be necessary if the instructions that we should give were carefully carried out. The type cf building required is of a very simple nature and could be satisfactorily built by any Contractor, who would carefully supervise the erection and the materials which were used. 9. Supplies of Raw Ma teri als » This Company would be prepared to supply sufficient materials for one year’s utput, on the basis of a normal production of 25 thousand rounds per day of 8 working hours at prices based on the cost of materials ruling at the time of placing the order for the materials, and would continue to supply the annual requirements on this basis. The Government would be ill-advised to purchase, in one order, materials sufficient for six years as the prices thereof vary from time to time and it would be more usual to place each year an order for the normal annual requirements as suggested above,, Ida, prices c,i,f g Jedda, T erms of Payment and Delivery. We regret that we are not quite able to adhere to the prices quoted in July, 1957, as some of our sub-contractors/7% sub-contractors, such as the Diesel engine Makers, are insisting on an increased price due to advances in costs since the date of our original tender, and we are accordingly compelled to increase our total price. It should be noted that our quotation of the 24th July, 1937, covered for delivery of the plant f.o.b. Birkenhead or equal. If delivery is required c.i.f. Jedda this would necessitate an increase in the cost. We indicate below the present day prices: CARTRIDGE PLANT comprising Machinery and Equipment for the production under ordinary working conditions of from 20,000 to 25,000 .303 H Mark VII Cartridges, or 7.9 m/m Mauser Cartridges per day of 6 working hours; all as specified in our quotation T/8672A dated 24th-July, 1937, and the letter and schedules appended thereto, TOTAL CURRERT PRICE including additional equipment specified in quotation for 7,9 m/m Mauser Cartridges, and services of experts as specified in quotation : Packed for shipment and delivered f.o.b. Birkenhead or equal;- £26,625 Delivered c.i.f. Jedda, exclusive of import duties, stamp taxes or any other duties present or future:- £27,643 The amount included in the above price for delivery c.i.f. is based on rates of freight, insurance, etc. at present ruling, and is subject to alteration according to rates in force at the time of shipment. If any insurance is to be effected by us it will not include War Risks, If, however, you notify us that you wi sh/wish us to cover these risks, we will do so at your expense at the rates ruling at the date of the insurance if and in so far as we are able to obtain cover 0 This revised quotation is subject to conditions of Sale 'TE' attached, being open for acceptance within 30 days Of date, and later only upon confirmation by us. Terms of Payments - NET - Payment to be made in English Sterling Currency as follows:- One third of the total value of the contract with order. Balance of the value of each individual shipment payable in London against invoice. The Company has very carefully considered the terms of payment suggested by the Government of Saudi Arabia, and has the honour to reply as follows - The terms of payment stated in the Tender are those which have been invariably agreed upon with their other purchasers. These terms have been established over very many years and have been found to be quite satisfactory both to the purchaser and to the vendor. The terms in question have been accepted by other Governments, and after giving the matter very careful consideration, the Company regrets that an alteration thereof cannct be agreed to. Despatch ^ As regards delivery, it would be impossible to deliver the machinery in six months and the quickest despatch which could be promised would be 24 months. Every effort would be made to improve upon this time, but we could not give any undertaking to do so. In considering this/this point v/e would, like to remind, you that the demand for all Armament machinery is increasing daily, and delivery dates are likely to get longer rather than shorter. At the same time, a great deal of work can be done in the 24 months in the building of the Factory, and in taking delivery of part of the machinery as it comes along and having it properly installed. 10b. Salaries of Enginesrs. The salaries and travelling expenses of the three Engineers to supervise erection are covered for in our tender, and the Government of Saudi Arabia would not therefore be required to pay these men. We trust the above satisfactorily deals with the points to which we hc'e been requested to give consideration, but are at your entire disposal for any further particulars in our power, and commending our tender to your favourable consideration, We have, etc,,GREENWOOD &amp; 3ATLSY, LTD.

Further to our letter of the 6th instant, as requested by Mr. J.R. Symes of Messrs. Richman, Symes &amp; Co. Ltd., London, we have pleasure in giving you the following information with regard to Clause 17 of our Conditions of Sale 'TE'. The meaning of the clause in question is that except as specified in paragraph 14 of the conditions of sale, we are not liable for any costs which might be incurred by the purchasers in consequence of the following unforeseen happenings:- 1. Delay in delivery caused by breakdowns or stoppages in our plant. 2. Delay in delivery caused by the commandeering of our plant, or of any part of our output by our Government. 3. Damages caused to other portions of the plant, buildings, or personnel, by breakdowns on the machines supplied to the purchasers. 4. Consequential damages of any kind arising from loss of output qr other costs arising from breakdowns of the machines supplied to the purchasers.

The prices quoted are for material strictly in accordance with British Government Specifications, where applicable, and of the very highest respective qualities, such as we have found from our long experience as Cartridge manufacturers to be the most suitable for the manufacture of small arm ammunition. The prices quoted are moderate for such material, as at the moment we happen to be in a favourable position as regards the purchase of the raw materials for the manufacture thereof. Our offer is subject to /confirmation@ confirmation at the time you are prepared to order; and the permission of the British Government to supply the material, together with the necessary Export Permit, would have to he obtained.

It will he noted that whereas some of the Continental Armies use Cups of steel, coated with base metal alloy for the Bullet Envelopes On Mauser Ammunition, we have included for Cupro-Nickel Cups for these Bullet Envelopes. This has been done with a view to facilitating the manufacture of both the .303” and 7.9 m/m Cartridges on the Plant offered, by employing Bullet Envelope Cups of the same material for both calibres, and further, Cupro-Nickel Trimmings etc. would probably be easier to sell in Saudi-Arabia than Base metal Coated steel trimmingH , which have no commercial value. In addition, should the Government of Saudi Arabia at a later date wish to undertake rolling their own Bullet Envelope Strip, whereas this is not a very difficult process with Cupro-Nickel, the rolling of Base Metal Coated Steel Strip presents certain difficulties. /We% %«&gt; 'He trust the above gives you the information desired for your present requirements, and shall be glad to look into the matter with a view to quoting firm prices at the time you are ready for placing the Order.

Mr, Kettaneh’s idea is to make use of Najib’s known qualities to secure the contract for an ammunition factory for a British firm, but as regards the Saudi Government’s alleged intention to turn to Germany for arms, this would appear to be directed either by Ibn Saud himself or by His Minister of Finance, to whom I presume any approach would have to be made if it were to have a prospect of success 3.

I have been, as usual, extremely busy over many many jobs which the Government wanted finished prior to the visit of His Majesty the King to Jeddah. I have not failed however to discuss the matter of arms with His Excellency the Minister of Finance. His Excellency has informed me that although your proposal seemed good to him yet he feels that the Government is in more need for rifles and ammunition (especially German make) than for machine guns of which they have a great number. He also said that the Government has been and is still investigating the matter of purchasing an ’’ammunition factory”. I have all the details about the ammunition factory referred to above because all the communications exchanged between the Government and some English firms are in my office; if you are interested please let me know so that I can send you the whole data. To make this matter more clear to you I wish to point out that the Government would much prefer to equip its army with German rifles and war material than with any other make; this being the fact the Government is now approaching German authorities on this matter and the officials concerned are taking keen interest in this respect. The German Minister who/ F» Kettaneh, Esq* Beyrouth*who was in Jedda last week has gone away in order to discuss the matter with his Government and he told me ■before his departure that he expects to return shortly.

According to Fuad consignment would consist of guns and specimens of various weapons, e.g. rifles and what are perhaps sub-machine guns with three Italians to explain their use. If specimens are satisfactory orders may be passed. The message was accompanied by an assurance from the King that no material advantage would ever affect his friendship for His Majesty 1 s Government.

CONFIDSNTIAL 0,1/0 ‘iff' Sxtract from despatch A from Sir R. Bullard, to Mr. Eden dated 18th December, 1937 at Jedda. 4 The next subject was arms. Ibn 3aud said that as His Majesty's G-overnment knew, he had tried to treat the Italian offer of arms in such a way as not to place himself under an obligation by acceptance and yet not to offend the Italians. The offer of Italian rifles he had eventually refused, on the ground that his forces were equipped with Mausers, and that to introduce some weapons of a new type would complicate the rearmament question. The Italians tnen said that they would get him any kind of rifles he liked, e.g., Ivlausers from Austria or Germany. The King then pleaded poverty, but the Italians said that that need not worry him, they would arrange easy terms. Keeping to his delaying tactics, the King said that if they would provide samples he would study the matter; and there the matter rested for the moment. Had he done right ? What would His Majesty’s Government say ? I repeated more or less what Sheikh Hafiz Wahba had already heard at the Foreign Office. His Majesty’s Government had provided all the arms which their own urgent needs enabled them to spare. If it had been within their power they would gladly have supplied more, but it was not. Ibn Saud was the sole judge of his own requirements in the matter of arms. It would evidently be better if he could have recourse to neutral supplies rather than to a Government like the Italian, which presumably, as His Majesty had himself said, was not offering cheap arms out of pure love for Saudi Arabia, but/but if in the end he could not escape the Italian offer, he would at least be acting with his eyes open* Ibn Saud said that he would continue to delay as far as he could, but there usually came a time in such cases where a decision could no longer be postponed. However, he would see what he could do. 5* I mention here that, according to a statement which Fuad Hamza had made to me the day before, the Italians wanted to sell Italian guns and anti-aircraft guns, in fact, any war material Ibn Saud might want as well as Mauser rifles.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002f0_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2214</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002f0</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2214</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 7/44 'Arabia: supply of arms and ammunition to Saudi Arabia from United Kingdom'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1941</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-09-16T15:00:41</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (139 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in rough chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 140; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
