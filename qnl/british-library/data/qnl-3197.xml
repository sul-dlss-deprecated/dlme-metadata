The bore is expected to go to about 12,000 feet and Mr. RUSSELL BROWN, the General Manager of the Company, is hoping for successful results. Mr. BROWN when he called on the Political Agent on the 11th, told the latter how pleased he would be if his Company could open a well yielding 50,000 barrels a day although he was not serious in suggesting that such a very high yield wpuld be obtained.

On the 29th December Shaikh HUMAID BIN/ABDULLAH, nephew of the Regent of Kalba, arrived in Sharjah. His visit to Sharjah was at the invitation of the Shaikh of Sharjah who secretly sent him a letter and a verbal message through one ALI BIN HAZIM saying he wanted to see him and make friends with him. After his arrival HUMAID met the Shaikh of Sharjah several times but it is not known what passed between them. The Shaikh /of-3- of Fujairah who is still in Ajinan suspectei that tho Shaikh of Sharjah's object in making friends with TIUMAID was to terrify him or instigate HUMAID against him now that he (Fujairah) has agreed to give protection to the inhabitants of vjadi el Hilu which belongs to Sharjah. The Shaikh of Fujairah visited the Residency Agent soon after HUIiAID 1 s arrival in Sharjah and reported to him that he suspected^ that this move by the Shaikh of Sharjah was directed against him and that if the case was such, he could deal very effi ciently with both HUMAID and the Shaikh of Sharjah. in the meantime, HUMAID came to call on the Residency Agent_and, in the presence of the Shaikh of Fujairah, told che Residency Apent that so fhr the Shaikh of Sharjah has not disclosed the object of his invitation to him and assured him that should he (the Shaikh of Sharjah) try to instigate him against the Shaikh of Fujairah he would refuse to act. The Shaikh of Fujairah was satisfied but he proposes to stay longer in Ajman in order to watch events. It may be remembered that last year the Shaikh of Sharjah took all possible precautions against^HUMAID and ordered that he should not come to Sharjah.( ^ide paragrapn 87(ii) of intelligence Summary No.8 of 1947). 8.

They have also sent a warning to Shaikh KHALID BIN AHMAD, the Regent, that he should not return to Khor Fakkan as they do not want him there. The Regent has not so far taken any steps against the inhabitants, but told the Residency Agent when the latter called on him on the 14th, that the uprising in Khor F&amp;kkan was due to negli gence and mal-administration of his nephew HUMAID who had been put in charge of the affairs there. The Political 0 ficer, Trucial Coast, has been asked to visit Kalba and Khor F^kAan and report further. 9. ZUBARAH AGAIN . . _ ' ’ The Shaikh of Bahrain has protested against che Shaikh of Qatar’s cultivating some land at Lish and Hillwan and his utilising water from 'our two wells' for this purpose. 10.

The meeting was called because during the last few days packets of Vene- % zuelan pearls and also pearls from the Red Sea were alleged to have been sent to Bahrain pearl merchants for disposal, fhe merdhants represented that the pearl trade had been seriously hit by India's ban on their entry into that country and that this latest danger would strike another blow at the industry. /The% V ». -4- The Shaikh of Dubai is reported to have published an ’Alan prohibiting the import of Venezuelan pearls into Dubai. 11.

Since then the Manasir, who are Abu Dhabi's allies, have committed many overt hostile acts against Dubai as well as constitutinp a continuing threat to the people of this Sheikhdom. Up to recently, it was considered that their hostile attitude had approval and help, if not open support, of the Shaikh oi Abu Dhaoir and accordingly ’’economic sanctions” in the orm of suspension of cereals, sugar and cloth quotas, were imposed agdnsc him in order to persuade him to fulfil his CrLcy ob- ligations by withdrawing his help from them. These seen to have had effect, because when the Political Officer, frucial visited the Shaikh recently, he argued.that if once ohe Manasir were put in the position of being able to commit depredations for which the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi rather than tnemselves were hell responsible, they would be in a position to blackmail the Shaikh and his brothers to an extent far beyond....% t? beyonri ; 'hac they can affori to pay them.

(i) Abduction of persons into slavery is taking place on a small scale on the Trucial Coast but on a much larger scale from Muscat and the Batinah Coast. The LI Bu Shamis and the Nai'm still turn a blind eye to slave dealing in their territories, and it is alleged that the Abu Dhabi Shaikhs in Buraimi afford asylum to bedouin robbers and abductors. The incentive to this trade is the presence in Buraimi of Saudi and Qatari slave traders who pay high prices for abducted persons for re-sale in Saudi Arabia Unless Saudi Arabia can be closed to this traffic there is little hope of H.M.G. being able to stop it on the Trucial Coast especially at this time of economic depression. (ii) The Shaikh of Sharjah recently heard that two free women of Sharjah had surrendered themselves into slavery and that they were with the Beni Qitab a few miles from Sharjah. He brought them to Sharjah and asked them whether they had really surrendered into slavery of their own free will. They admitted having done so because, they said, they were starving. He let them go with a warning but it is reported that they have again surrendered themselves into slavery. (iii) Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid, Ruler of Ajman, recently pursued two Harasis tribesmen who had kidnapped a woman from Masfut and sold her in Buraimi. Reaching the Harasis encampment in Buraimi he secured two Harasusis as hostages to be held until the kidnapped woman was restored. The Harasis eventually brought her back and handed her over to the Ruler of xijman, who released the hostages. Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan, Chief of the Nai'm of Buraimi, who is on bad terms with and is very frightened of the Ruler of Ajman, happened to be out in his newly purchased Ford pick-up with a guard of 18 men. When he reached Dhank he learned that the Shaikh of Ajman was camping in the vicinity. He immediately turned back and was driven with such precipitate haste that he broke two springs of his truck and had to abandon it and return to Buraimi by camel. 85. Mr. WILFRED THESIGER .

At his request, the Political Agent has written to His Excellency the Ruler of Qatar and expressed Captain Southern's appreciation. 87. A ID FOR PALESTINE .

The Manasir have moved their main encampment to Hasa and continue to resist the efforts of the Abu Dhabi Ruler to make peacd between them and Dubai. Shaikh Hazza has, however, given the _ Political Officer, Trucial Coast a written undertaking that Abu “^XDhabi will prevent them using any part of Buraimi under Abu Dhabi control as a base from which to attack Dubai. He has also promised not to supply them with guns or camels nor make increases in the amounts of money, cloth, grain, coffee and other foodstuffs which Abu Dhabi have hitherto supplied to the Manasir, nor assist them in any way as long as they continue to indulge in hostilities against Dubai. Shaikh Rashid has accepted these assurances as »su„ficient and is confident he can decal with the Manasir if they attempt to renew hostilities without Abu Dhabi support.

H.M.S. ’’Wild Goose' had shore landing parties in readiness in case assistance was needed by the civil power or British lives or property were threatened. Perhaps be cause of these precautions, up to the present nothing untoward has happened except that in the main Girls' School the female teachers went on strike. They were informed that if tney struck, they would not bo employed any further by the Bahrain Government. They fell into hysterics and were only brought around by the suggestion of the wife of the Adviser that, instead of striking, they should say prayers on behalf of the Palestine Arabs for a quarter of an hour every day. Sven though there wore no exciting incidents here, there were plenty of rumours, eg. (a) A B.O.A.C. flying boat was carrying a cargo of bombs through Bahrain to Tiberias for the Jews but had to turn back and then try again. (The origin of this was that a flying boat was stationed here for a few days and made short flights testing new equipment.) (b) Outside Manama town the rumour went that 2000 British sailors had landed, cordoned the town, and were pre venting all movement in and out. (ii) The news of the invasion of Palestine by the armies of the surrounding Arab States was received with jubilation by the local population. Relief is felt at the prompt action that has been taken by the Arab States. The course of events in Palestine are being followed with great interest by all classes and the col fee shops arc crowded to a la.te hour every night by people listening to the radio news broadcasts. 119.

The events were well organised and included horse races, tent pegging, high and long jumps, the pole vault, a sack race, and a 440 yards relay. The meeting was well attended, His Excellency the Political Resident and Lady Hay, His Highness Shaikh Salman, the Political Agent, and Shaikhs Mohammed and Abdullah bin Isa, the two uncles of His Highness, being among those present. (ii) On the 7th and 8th, the Annual Exhibition of Handicrafts was held at the Qhadhibiyeh Palace, Manamah the - exhibits consisting of work done by the Girls' Schools a d the Boys' Technical School. Sales were brisk. (iii) As a result of the stoppage of supplies from Iran, the price of rice has increased from Rs.3/- to Rs.4/8 per Ruba. This increase is felt severely by the local middle class. (iv) It was possible to state in the Annual Administration Report that no case of small-pox had occurred during 1c st year. This record has now unfortunately been broken by the a&gt; oearance of 6 or 7 cases in Manama, (v) A second case of a lunatic seaman being'lan.' e d and stranded in Bahrain has occurred. The previous one, &lt;.• Spaniard-5- caused the Shipping Agents who were unfortunate enough be saddled with responsibility for him a sum of Rs.5,003/-, and he had to be sent back to Spain with an escort of A o i-o^icemen, one, of them an European Sergeant. The secoid case is a coloured man. The tanker in which ho arrive refused to take him away with a full cargo of oil, son of w uch was inflammable; the Shipping Agents not unnatur- Jly deny any responsibility on the owners’ behalf; and the' ~ Bahrain Government, although now saddled with him, do nee ••.msh to ..rye him for an indefinite period in the lunatic asylum. All the parties concerned (except the lunatic) complained to the Political Agent that it was unfair to saddle them with any responsibility in the matter. 120 • SHIPPING . . 40 ships (13 British, 12 American, 8 Panamanian, 1 ^rwegian, 2 Dutch, 3 Swedish and 1 French) called at the Scrio Bahrain during the period under report.

PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (TRUCIAL C OAST) LIM ITED. The Bahrain Manager of the Company has inquired from the Political Agent whether in the event that Fujairah territory is considered to be of sufficient geological or other interest, it would be in order for his Company to enter into negotiations with a view to obtaining an oil concession from the Shaikh of Fujairah. The inquiry arises from the fact that while the Sultan of Muscat considers the Shaikh of Fujairah to be bis subject, the latter does n&gt;t recognise his claim, pays no zakat tr the Sultan or any Trucial Coast Ruler, and is in effective control of Fujairah territory. 127.

The Bahrain Government have replied that they have searched the house of i.li Somali and that they have no definite information leading then to suppose that he is recruiting labour. They understand that the suggestion that i*li Somali was recruiting labour for work in Dhahran originated with the Irani interpreter of h.k.S.'WhBN'. (ii) On the 14th a football match was played at Dnahran, Saudi Arabia 9 between a Bahrain team and a team composed of Italian and Sudanese employees of uiuJiCO. The Bahrain team wore loading by 2 goals to one when an altercation broke out between them and the Italian referee, the latter holding that only one player at a time could tabkle an opponent, as a result of which the Bahrain foam walked off the field and the match was abandoned. The proceeds from tile match were donated to the Palestine &lt;c*rabs. (iii) On Friday the 28th there was a volley ball tournament between teams of Indians, Pakistanis, Persians and Bahrainis.

An altercation followed and one of the Jews, at any rate, hit the Persian. He left them and went to Muharraq town where he roused public feeling against the Jews to such bad effect that a posse of Arabs,- one of whom brought a shot-gun, marched to the R.A.F. camp and laid seige to its telephone exchange in which the Jews had taken refuge. They were rescued by an Assistant Sub Inspector of the Bahrain State Police and brought to Manama where they will be tried. The communal aspect of the incident has invested it with an importance which intrinsically it never deserved.

The latter objected to the dhow^ being laid alongside 6ne of the Company barges loaded with materials, an altercation followed, and a dagger was drawn by the Nakhuda of the dhow. The Nakhuda, Mohammed Rashid, and one of the Khalassis, Abdullah bin Ahmed, were arrested by the local Amir and have been deported by the shaikh of Qatar.

LANDING ARRANG EMENTS. (A PERENNIAL) Kanoo, the two landing companies in Bahrain, recently wrote and informed the Bahrain Government that they wished to increase the landing charges (a 15 per cent reduction in charges was made by the landing companies in June 1947). A meeting of the merchant community was held at the Customs House to discuss this proposal at which the old complaints of delay in transporting cargo between Sitra and Manamah and damage and pilferage of cargo were made against the landing companies. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie sought to'prove (both at the meeting and in subsequent correspondence with the Bahrain Government) that much of the damaged cargo had been damaged before it arrived in Bahrain, that pilferage of cargo had decreased in recent months, and that delay in transporting cargo between Sitra and Manamah was in large part due to the fact that the Shaikh Hamad swing bridge in the causev/ay between the islands of Manamah and Muharraq was only opened for one hour during the daylight and for a few hours after 12 midnight. They suggested that the Bahrain Government should place police guards on board the barges and offered to dismiss any of their unloading crew who had a bad police record. charges should be increased by 15 per cent restoring them to what they were before the 15 per cent cut was made in June 1947. The Adviser to the Bahrain Government promised to post police guards aboard barges but warned Gray, Mackenzies that this v/ould be for an experimental period at first and that the police were not up to full strength and could not allot sufficient men for this work. Regarding the closure of the swing bridge as the alleged cause of delays, he pointed out that the primary object of building the causeway was to facilitate road traffic between the two islands and that the frequent closure of the bridge to road traffic would greatly reduce its usefulness. He suggested that barges might travel around Muharraq, which is a small island, instead of passing between Manamah and Muharraq. which the “breakdowns” and 'shortages' In the electricity supply and the fact that many house-owners are still unable to obtain electricity for their houses has focussed public Reference paragraph 122 of Intelligence Summary No.11 of 1947.

He is reported to have told Shaikh Saqr that the Sultan wished him to allow P.C.L. to operate in Nai'm terri tory but the Shaikh has not yet agreed to this. While in Buraimi Saiyid Ahmed asked the Buraimi and DhaMrah Shaikhs he met there if they would agree to the opening up of the Wadi el Jizzi to motor traffic. It is reported that the Chiefs deferred giving their consent to his proposal until they have had a chance to meet the Sultan at Sohar after the Id, and that until then no cars will be allowed to use this road.

The nephew of the Regent extorted about Rs.13,400/- from some of the inhabitants of Khor Fakkan and is reported to be buying arms and ammunition with this money.

She was accompanied by her nephew, Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah A1 Khalifah, and sixteen male and female ser vants. It is learnt reliably that some of her servants succeeded in smuggling some gold sovereigns with them into Karachi. The fact that the Shaikbaand her followers were exempted from search by the Customs authorities at Karachi helped them to do so. (iii) Reference paragraph 193 (iv) of Intelligence .

Cable &amp; Wireless Limited vice Mr. C.E. Gahan who has left for India. (v) Reference paragraph 132 (vi) of Intelligence Summary No.9. During Ramadhan most of those who can afford it buy meat rather than fish. With the end of Ramadhan the demand for fish increased again out of all proportion to the supply. To those factors already mentioned which make for scarcity has been added the great heat of the coastal waters and the retreat of the fish towards the cooler deeps of the sea. Catches are therefore extremely small, and it is tasking the patience and ingenuity of Bahrainis to get any share in them. Sons of families prowl from beach to beach in swift motor cars, servants stand all day looking out to sea, and the approach of a fishing boat is met with a mad stampede of persons into the shallows. The poor cannot buy fish. 178. PEA RLIN G. Reference paragraph 130 of Intelligence Summary No.9. Pearling boats began leaving for the banks on the 3rd day after Id ul Fitr and many have left.

The Political Agent and His Highness the Shaikh attended an evening gathering held by the Pakistanis. Interminable, frothy, and fanatical speeches were the main items of enter tainment* but provoked little response. Few local Arabs attended.181. BAHRAIN ,IND PALESTINE. Local feeling seems to have, got rather lukewarm on the Palestine issue. Recognition of the poor showing of the Arab armies, their disunity, and of the results of the early failure to reap the benefits of a compromise have contributed to this. The callous, Arab individualism has thus emerged undisguised*.;, in an attitude of indifference's towards the fate of the refugees of their own race. 182. QATAR . The Bahrain Government has long had an under standing with local merchants that they must sell in Bahrain half of any consignment of cereals they import for retranship ment to another port. In order to avoid this levy, Abdullah Darwish, a Qatar merchant, recently had a shipment of 400 tons of rice consigned to Dubai instead of to Bahrain. The Shaikh of Dubai, however, adopted the Bahrain practice and forced Abdullah Darwish to sell half his consignment in Dubai. The remainder, further reduced by the theft of 400 bags at Dubai, was eventually sent to Qatar, its price having greatly increased. 183. TRUCIAL COAS T.

LANDING,ARRAN GEMENTS . x. _ Reference paragraph 156 of Intelligence Summary On the 22nd His Highness Shaikh Salman presided over a meeting of local merchants and representatives of the landing companies to discuss a demand by Messrs. Gray,-3- Mackenzie &amp; Co„, that the landing rates should be increased by Rs.1/8 pcrton both on bag cargo and other cargo. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa, uncle of His Highness, and Mr*; Belgrave, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, were also present. Most of the meeting was spent in bringing up and replying to the old charges of pilferage of cargo and delay in transport ing cargo between Sitra and Manamah. Much time was also devoted to a discussion about the depth of Manamah harbour and suggestions that it should be surveyed. When the question they had met to discuss was eventually put to those present by His Highhess the merchants unanimously declin d to agree to any further increase in the landing charges. 194. LABOUR. (i) There have been no great fluctuations in post war prices in Bahrain (controls have only been removed very gradually), but there is a flourishing black market, and the Bahrain economy is influenced by the inflation in Saudi ^rabia. This is true especially of the labour market. The high wages being paid at Dhahran, Ras Tanura, and Dammam continue -to attract labour away from Bahrain and the Government is reported to be contemplating the reintroduction of their former ban on the migration of labour to the mainland. The great discontent it aroused at the time and the fact that it would be extremely difficult to render such a ban really effective has so far deterred the Bahrain Government from re-imposing it. (ii) The Bahraini Labourer has always been a seasonal worker, either agriculturist or pearl diver, and though the moribund pearl industry no longer attracts him he continues as of habit to change the place and nature of his occupation. The Bahrain Petroleum Company have been attempting to check the seasonal migration of their labour by introducing a pro vident fund for them, but without success. That the Company should give him money the labourer understands, but that he should again give it to the Company he does not understand. 195. FURTHER L OCAL AFFii lRS . (i) On the 17th Shaikh Salman bin Muhammad bin Isa al Khalifah, one of the Bahrain Court Judges, who had been spending the summer in the Lebanon, returned to Bahrain. (ii) On the 17th His Highness left Bahrain on a visit to the neighbouring small island of Umm Na’san, which is the private property of the Ruling Shaikh. He was accompanied by his uncle. Shaikh Abdullah and other members of the ruling family. The party returned to Bahrain on the 19th. i (iii) For many months past the Adviser to the Bahrain Government has had as one of his manifold activities the construction of a 'water garden' outside Manamah town at, it is said, a cost exceeding Rs.10,000/-. Some marshy land has been reclaimed and filled in to make two artificial lakes the channel between iwhich is spanned by a 'willow pattern' bridge, while an octagonal bandstand in 19th century municipal style rears itself incongruously in the Bahrain scene. On the 24th, Mr. Belgrave held an aquacade, arranged by himself, to open the garden to the public. Practically all departments of the Bahrain Government were mobilised for the occasion. The Shaikh’s arrival was sounded by the playing......196. playing of his 'salute' followed immediately by an 'interval' and 'Bells across the Medow' (sic). Coloured lanterns were borne in procession round the two lakes and model boats were towed across the water by concealed men while spotlights played and 'pearlers' sang plaintively in the distance. Swans, carved from plywood by the Adviser himself, appeared on the water to the strains of (the programme stated) 'The Swan Lake Ballet Music' - only perceptible however by the eoarA of faith. The 'piece de resistance' and finale was provided by young men who paddled small boats and set fire to a cloth and bamboo fort. His Excellency the Political Resident, the Political xigent and His Highness the Shaikh and other Shaikhs and notables were seated apart on a sort of grand stand. His Highness, when asked what was going on, opined that it was 'something Western'. What the other Arabs made of these entertainments, most of which had featured when King Ibn Saud visited Bahrain in 1939, it is hard to imagine. (iv) Many cars are being sold by Bahrainis to Pakistani- buyers, two or three cars being shipped by every 'down' steamer to Karachi. (v) On the 19th a quarrel broke out amongst the Canadian crew of a tanker berthed at Sitra. One of the naturs who attempted to intervene was 'beaten up' and when the Captain who was ashore, attempted to return, the men refused to allow him to get on board. The vessel was towed away from Sitra pier to prevent members of the disaffected crew getting ashore and there wert. no serious results from the affairs. The prospect of tanker crews coming ashore in Bahrain raises problems. (vi) PRICES OF ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES FOR AUGUST. Prices per kilogramme.

Fantastic as it seems_one theory is that Great Britain is prepared to let Persia into Bahrain in return for the guarantee that her and not the United States’ influence would be predominant in. the Bahrain Petroleum Company. (It is firmly believed locally that the Bahrain Petroleum Company is controlled entirely from the United States.) All this talk is causing concern to the Shaikh of Bahrain and he h&lt; n s asked the Political Agent why no denial of the claim has been issued by His Majesty's Government. 197. TR UCIAL COAST . (i) Fujairah. About a month ago 10 robbers believed to be from the Beni Qitab attacked three of the Sharqiyeen who were also Fujairah subjects at Tuwi Rashid on the main Sharjah - Dhaid road killing one and robbing them of what goods they had with them. The Shaikh of Fujairah took the matter up with the Beni T^i-tab 'but failing to get any redress he has now declared hostilities against them. Recently an important member of the Beni Qitab was killed by Sharqiyeen tribesmen in the vicinity of Khatt. They also killed by mistake a Mazrui, a Ras al Khaimah subject. The Beni Qitab retaliated by killing one of the Sharqiyeen but he was not a Fujairah subj ect, (ii) Abu Dhabi . Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan, Ruler of Abu Dhabi, has recently married a young bedouin girl (a child of 12 years) from the Abal Khail tribe. (iii) P earling . During the period under report the majority of the Trucial Coast diving boats left for the diving banks. It is estimated that the number of diving boats, both large and small, which' - have so far left is four times more than that which went to the diving during the earlier part of the diving season, i.e., before Ramadhan. This increase is due to the fact that the prices of certain types of pearls have gone up in India which has led local as well as Indian mer chants to finance diving boats. The following is an estimate of the diving boats which have already sailed:; Dubai 180 Sharjah 33 Abu Dhabi 140 Ajman 20 Jazirat al Hamrah 15 Umm al Qaiwain 5 Ras al Khaimah 5 Total 398 198. Shipping198. SHIPPING. 33 ships (12 British, 8 American, 5 Panamanian, 3 Norwegian, 2 Swedish, 1 Dutch, 1 French, and 1 Portuguese) called at the port of Bahrain during the period under review. Imports were 1848 tons of general cargo for Bahrain and 3577 tons for transhipment to the mainland. Exports were 700 drums and 10 packages of general cargo and 222900 tons of petroleum products. 199.

PAID -I -A ZAM MO H AMM ED AL I JI NNAH. Mr. Jinnah's death came as a great shock to local Pakistanis and to members of all communities in Bahrain. The next day, the 12th September, all shops and offices, including the Agency, were closed and flags were flown at^ half-mast on public buildings. In the evening a memorial service was held in the luma’ Mosque in Manamah where speeches were made in praise of the dead man. Cinemas were closed. 204. Bahrain• Hj @ - 2 - . 204o BAHRAIN ELEC TRICITY DEPARTMENT . (jj Reference paragraph 157 (i) of Intelligence Summary No.11. Mr. Clear, the Cfeiro representative of British Oil Engines (Export) Limited, who are the Middle East agents of Messrs. Mirrlees, Bickerton and Day, visited Bahrain during the period under review and inspected the electricity system of Manamah and Muharraq. His visit was at the in vitation of the Bahrain Government. His report confirms previous impressions that the supply of electricity has always lagged behind demand and stresses the need to order new generators immediately in order to cope with the fore seeable demand next year and the year after. As it will be some time before these generators can arrive and be installed 1949 will be another bad electricity year for Bahrain. (ii) Reference paragraph 190 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.14. Group Captain Leigh has already left Bahrain for the United Kingdom. 205. L ANDING A RRANGEMENTS . Reference paragraph 193 of Intelligence Summary No.14. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., have written to the Bahrain Government complaining that the many other points raised at the meeting had left no time for a proper discussion of the case for an increase in the landing charges. This is justified, they argue, because they are increasing their barge fleet at considerable cost to them selves and have recently stepped up the wages of barge crews from Rs„350/- to Rs.530/- per mensem. Further, the Bahrain Government have recently decreed that Customs employees must be paid overtime by the landing company for any work done after 3.00 p.m. This has meant that Gray, Mackenzie have also had to pay their own employees overtime after 3.00 p.m. They are willing, they say, to discuss these points with individual merchants or with a small committee appointed by the Bahrain Government; and add that while they will continue to charge the present rates until the end of 1948, they may consider it essential to increase the landing charges in the new year. 206. LABOUR. Reference paragraph 194 (i) of Intelligence Summary No.14. The higher wages being paid on the mainland (and in Qatar) is attracting not only the Bahraini labourer but also the office worker. In Bahrain, where salaries are more or less pegged to the Bahrain Government scale, he would be paid a starting salary of Rs.120/- per mensem; in Dhahran the Oil Company pay a Clerk as much as Rs.300/- to Rs.400/- per mensem. He may do even better if he works for an Arab Contractor. Many of these men, who are earning very large sums, are illiterate and are paying their clerks as much as Rs.600/--3- Rso600/- per mensem. Both Cle j rks and labourers are now paid in gold by ARAMCO and the sale of this gold boosts salaries still higher. There is no shortage of clerks in Bahrain, however, as the Government Schools are still turning out yearly a sufficient number of young men with some pre tensions to literacy to supply both the Bahrain Government and the oil companies„ 2 °7o PAKISTAN CURRENCY . The Karachi newspaper 'DAWN” reported in its issue of Sepoember 4th that 'despite the overwhelming demand for Pakistan Currency” the Political Agent had issued a notice that all the transactions should be in Indian Currency and not Pakistan Currency. The paper calls this 'one more proof of Britrin’s anti-Pakistan policy'. The Political Agent has issued no orders regarding the currency to be used in Bahrain. At the request and on behalf of the Pakistan Government, however, he sent the Bahrain Government and Bahrain banks a copy of a note prepared by the Pakistan Ministry of Finance in which it was alleged that malicious propaganda had been carried on in some countries in the Middle East with a view to sabotaging and discrediting Pakistan Currency. The Bahrain Government replied that it did not consider that there had been any propaganda in Bahrain directed towards the discrediting of Pakistan Currency. This was also the opinion of both the Bahrain banks. They added that Pakistan currency was being freely accepted by the banks, a charge of one anna for every ten rupees being made to cover the cost of its repatriation to Pakistan. A similar charge, they stated, was being made in purchases of Sterling Notes, Iraq Dinar Notes, and Egyptian PoundsNotes to cover the cost of repatriation to their respective countries. 208. PERSIAN CLi.IM TO B AHRAIN. Reference paragraph 196 of Intelligence Summary No.14. The Persians seem to be carrying on particularly intensive propaganda regarding their claim to Bahrain. A report was current recently in Manamah that a Persian Deputy had offered a large reward and grants of land in Persia to anyone (including, of course, Persians in Bahrain) who could bring forward proofs of the validity of the Persian claim to Bahrain. The origin of this report was said to be a Baghdad broadcast. A few days later an Arabic broadcast from Paris stated that the Shah had settled satisfactorily to Persia her claim to Bahrain with His Majesty's Government and that the islands were to be handed over to Persia. 209. LIQUOR . (i) Ghulam Akhtarzadah was once a servant of the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and is now the proprietor of a large new shop and restaurant called the Moon Stores. He recently imported a consignment of apple cider and established himself for a time as the most popular restaurateur in the' island. Bahrainis, who partake impartially of Scotch, local arak, ahd Eau de Cologne in secret, flocked to drink cider in public. The alcoholic content of the cider was negligible but such is the power of faith that many who drank it displayed allsymptoms of bein^ drunk. As a result on Friday ^vnen ms Highness attended pul lie prayers in the Juma' hosque^the Sunni Qadhi spoke so feelingly of tie evils °i drin-: and the reproach attached to the Government for allowing the sale of intoxicants that the following day ms Hignness issued an 'uhlan' prohibiting the sale of apple cider to the puMic.

The guests included His Excellency the Political Resident, the Poli tical Agent, the senior officials of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, members of the local European community, and many of the A1 Khalifah. (iii) Ahmad Omran, Director of Education, Bahrain Government, has returned to Bahrain, having been in Egypt and the Lebanon. He has arranged for 22 Egyptian teachers to be seconded by the Egyptian Government to the teaching staff in Bahrain. He was able to get Palestineans with better qualifications, but in view of the fact that they are non-returnable to their country of origin, he wisely refrained from engaging them. There is criticism amongst certain circles in Bahrain regarding the alleged frequent changes and quality of the teachers imported from outside Bahrain. (iv) Reference paragraph 119 (v) of Intelligence Summary No.8. The lunatic seaman was thought to be an Adenese, and Gray Mackenzie managed to persuade the master of the tanker on her next visit to Bahrain to take the lunatic with him as his ship was calling at Aden. The authorities at Aden, however, were not convinced that he was an Adenese and would not allow him to be landed. He was therefore brought back to Bahrain and is now wandering round the town. (v) Reference paragraph (iv) of Intelligence Summary No.12. For the first few days after its opening the 'Pearl Cinema' showed to full houses and there were as many as three shows a day. But when the novelty of the interior decoration, the upholstered chairs, and the distorting mirrors in the gallery had 'worn off Bahrainis had many criticisms to make. Without air-conditioning, the cinema was a most un comfortable place to sit in during th^ summer months, the screen was too small, the projector and sound apparatus poor, and the quality of the films shov/n indifferent. As a result the 'Pearl' has been showing to almost empty houses. Its competitors the 'Bahrain Cinema' in Manama and the 'Muharraq Cinema' in Muharraq are doing much better. To them has been added another, the 'nl Ahli Cinema' which opened in Manama during September. The building is no more than a walled enclosure and has ho roof, but the screen is large, the pro jector and sound apparatus good, and only films which have already proved their box office value in ^gypt or India are being shown. It can seat over a thousand persons and is running at present to capacity houses. (vi) The staple fare of the Bahraini cinema goer is the Egyptian film, but many Indian films are shown and there are large audiences for them. 'Kismet' and 'Mun Ki Jeet' were very popular, and at the moment 'The Flying Prince' which features a pugilistic heroine is providing a rival attraction to the Egyptian Cinema stars, .Abdul Wahab, in 'Yom Said', and Omme Kalsoum, in 'Sallamah'. (vii) The European community goes either to the Bapco cinema at Awali or the R.A.F. cinema at Muharraq. The PearlPearl Cinema has shown one or two American films but soon withdrew them. Bahrainis find little to admire in most English and nmerican films. The Hollywood M song and dance ,, film does not attract 9 but the ’'westerner' or 'action film' is popular&lt;, and several have been shown at the 'Muharraa Cinema'.

While he is in the United Kingdom,Colonel Moody hopes to obtain sanction for the appointment of a European' Quarantine Officer who would superintend quarantine ar rangements at Sitra. The question, as to whether he will, as the previous Quarantine Medical Officer, medically attend the ships visiting Sitra, is under discussion between the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Political Agent, the Company having given indications at various times that they would prefer to themselves provide medical attention for the crews, at any rate, of tankers belonging to Companies affiliated to them. It would, however, be a waste to have a doctor at Sitra solely for quarantine work. The Oil Company have built a dispensary there. S 1 ?* ROYAL NAVY „ On the 15th H.M.S. 'Wren', Commander J.G.

Reference paragraph 207 of Intelligence Summary In its editorial of the 17th September 'DAWN' again, inter alia, charges the Political Agent with having issued a 'peremptory order on the banks and Government offices of the island not to accept Pakistan Currency on any account', 'It is quite obvious', says the newspaper, that the bias among the top administrative personnel there is definitely against Pakistan'. 219. £ATYR. It is reported that one Naim bin Wadiya, a subject of the Sultan of Muscat, is being held in captivity near Zakrit in Qatar.

The Shaikh of Dubai has sent a messenger to Matar bin Salim al Azizi of Dhank with an offer for peace and re concilement . (iii) During the period under report, many Manasir tribesmen and their chiefs visited the Shaikh of Dubai in order to profess friendship to him and offer their services. They obtained presents of cash, foodstuffs and clothes from him. (iv) Fujairah. Reference paragraph 197 (i) of Intelligence Summary No.14. The Shaikh of Fujairah sent one Hamdan ash-Shihi to the Shaikh of Dubai with an offer from him to make peace with the Beni Oitab.

During the period under report they raided a Beni Qitab encampment in the vicinity of Jebel Fayah, killed one of them and took away a number of camels. A Beni Qitab pursuit party consisting of 15 men overtook the Awamir west of Buraimi and engaged them. One of the Beni Qitab was wounded and the Awamir escaped without any loss.

Indian films have been showing in all 4 Arab cinemas during the past fortnight. It would appear that while the cost of an Indian film is about £60/-, an Egyptian film costs four times as much. As competition is keen .and films run for no more than 4 days to a week it is not possible to recover the. money spent on an Egyptian film. The 'Indisri 1 films' sound is in Urdu which many of the local people understand. (iv) .About a month ago when the Bahrain Police searched the house of a Persian resident of Manamah, they found the apparatus of a Still and ov r 80 gallons of Arak. This find and the sentence imposed on the Persian by the . gency Courts bus severely discouraged other local distille,s and urak is in very short supply. Many drinkers have however- already discovered a substitute for Arak in 'aqua velve'. 1 . 11 * stocks of this well-known after shave lotion hrve recently disappeared from the bazaar.

(i) On the 21st His Excellency the Political Resident left in the L.T. 'Nearchus” on a tour of Muscat and the Batinah coast. He was accompanied by Lady and Miss Hay. (ii) Reference paragraph 241 (iv) of Intelligence Summary No.18. (.i:) On the 21st the Political Agent returned to Bahrain. (iii) Reference paragraph 190 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.14.

'Loch Quoich', to call on His Highness at Ghadhabiyeh Palace- His Highness returned the call at the Agency the same day. (ii) On the 25th Mr. Emile Bustaneh of the Arab Contracting Company, Lebanon, called on the Political Agent He proposes to build and run an hotel in Bahrain. 255. LOCAL AFFAIRS . (i) A1 Khalifah . On the 17th Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa, uncle of His Highness, left for Kuwait on a hawking trip into the hinterland. He was accompanied by his nephews, Shaikh Khalifah bin Muhammad, Superintent of Police, Bahrain, and Shaikh Salman bin Muhammad; one of the judges of the Bahrai lower court.

There were 69 boats with a total complement of 2560 persons engaged in pearling operations this year. The total catch is estimated to be worth about Rupees four lakhs. This has disappointed those, like His Highness,- 2 - who hoped for a revival of the Bahrain Pearling Industry. They may, however, find some consolation in the reflection that the pearling fleet only went out after Ramadhan and that it suffered bad weather towards the end of the season. (ii-‘: t.-ats (iii) Rents . His Highness, who is himself a large owner of house property, has long wanted to amend the existing rent law and allow an increase in rents. On the 24th a meeting of the Rent Committee, appointed by the Political Agent and consisting of representatives of European firms, local merchants, landlords and tenants, was held at the Agency in order to consider a suggestion that the percentage to be charged as rent should be raised from the existing rate of 4% to 6% on the value of the property. Major J.E.H. Hudson, the Assistant Political Agent, presided. In the course of discussion it was pointed out by the representative of the local merchants that the assessed value of houses under the present rent law was far higher than their actual value as rents had risen progressively without check for some ten years before the law was passed. The Committee considered this point and found that the suggested rise would, in effect, be an increase of 50% in house rent, which, because of the high cost of living today, would make for increased inflation and a resultant demand for an increase in wages. They recommended therefore that there should be no increase in the percentage of rent charge able and expressed themselves as only willing to consider a rise if properties were reassessed excluding thu value of the site. (iv) Venereal Disease . At the representation of the Chief Quarantine Medical Officer, the State Medical Officer, and other doc tors, the Bahrain Government are takj ig steps to combat the incidence of venereal disease in Bahrain, which, it has been stated, is amongst the highest in the world though no accurate figures are available. The Police have rounded up all prostitutes for medical examination, and free treat ment is being offered to those suffering from venereal disease._ The Bahrain Government have asked that every person with venereal disease should undergo treatment at the hands of a doctor and have ordered compulsory examination and treatment of any person who will not voluntarily under- go it.

There have been a number of resignations over the last few months from amongst the engineering staff of the Company. The reasons seem to be a lack of many amenities and the fact that much of the construction ma terial for the company's building operations has not yet arrived and there is little work for their engineers ? this leading to boredom. Many of those who have resigned have elected to go to East Africa in order to work on the development projects there. 260. T RUCIAL COAST . (i) Petroleum Development (Truc i al Coast) Ltd .

(i) A1 K hal ifa h. - Reference paragraph 255 (i) of Intelligence Summary No.19. On the 10th Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa returned from Kuwait. (ii) A round robin signed by a large number of the A1 Khalifah shaikhs and addressed to His Highness Shaikh Salman asking him for increases in allowances has led to a real family row. The Shaikh as usual when his pocket threatens to be affected became incensed, and condemned his relations, with indeed a good deal of truth, as vi cious and useless parasites - not that that really upsets him but he genuinely objects to unconcealed vice. He has not so far given any notice to the request for in creases but relations are very strained. The incident^. 1 is symptomatic of the unfortunate social and economic consequences of the monetary inflation following the pouring of oil royalties into an area, the inhabitants of which do not know how to spend them. (iii) R ace Meeting . The Winter Race Meeting on the 10th was held j in good weather and provided a card of six events.

The main event was won by His Highness' horse 'Rabda' with another of his horses in second place. The silver cup for first place was auctioned after the meeting in aid of the Red Crescent and knocked down to Mr. Khalid Aujan, a local merchant, for Rs.2,000/-. (iv) Pump i ng Sta t ion . Reference paragraph 245 of Intelligence Summary No.18. On the 11th His Highness Shaikh Salman formally opened the new pumping station in Manamah erected by Messrs. Holloway Bros, to supply the town with piped drinking water. (v) Wells . The wells in most private houses in Manamah are very badly kept by their owners and are in a filthy and insanitary condition. The Bahrain Government have been contemplating the sealing up of many of these wells now that Manamah has a piped water supply, and a recent tragedy may force*them to take immediate steps to this end. On the 12th a servant who descended one of those wells to recover an eating mat that had fallen into it was overcome by the gases he had disturbed in his descent and drowned. A se cond servant who descended to search for the first suffered a similar fate. A third man who attempted to enter the well was also affected but was pulled up in time to save his life.

The Adviser to the Bahrain Government has written to the Manager of Messrs. Cable and Wireless and informed him that so long as the company insist on maintaining those clauses in the subscribers' agreement to which there has been objection neither His Highness nor the other Arab subscribers are prepared to sign the agreement. The main point at issue seems to be that of a high tariff with an unlimited number of calls to be allowed each subscriber versus a low tariff with a limited number of calls. The company maintain that a high tariff would mean fewer subscribers but His Highness and the other Arab subscribers do not agree with this view and want calls to be unlimited. 267. B RITISH COUNCI L. Some months ago, the British Council allocated a small sum of money for subventior - for local educational organisations. After consulting t.ie local educational- authorities, the British Council were asked to provide sets of physiology and biology wall charts, travel association poster#, and photographs and charts of British agriculture, . industry and commerce. These have recently been received here and have been distributed to the schools concerned. 268 , WAT ER CONSURVi.TION . His Highness and the ndviscr to the. Bahrain Gov.rnment have often expressed their concern at the great wastage of water that tak-..s place from the uneconomical sinking of wells and have in several instances made this the reason for holding up or refusing the sinking of new wells by the Bahrain Petroleum Company, alleging that this would result in the drying up of other wells in the vicinity. The Company have now pointed out that they were recently consulted by His Highness about the sinking of a new well in the property of one of the A1 Khalifah and that though they advised against it on the grounds that the property could be easily supplied with water from other wells in the area and that a new well would supply a quantity of water far in excess of that required for the property, His Highness insisted on the sinking of a new well. The Political A r -ent is addressing the Shaikh on the matter 269. QATiiR . Naim bin Vifadiva . Reference paragraph 236 of Intelligence Summary No.17.

Negotiations are going on between them to settle this matter. (vi) It is reported that the Shaikh of Sharjah feels that Shaikh Rahmah bin Abdul* Rahman of Hira is in triguing against him and accuses him of instigating be douins against him. Shaikh Rahmah is therefore unable t° come to Sharjah as he fears that he may be arrested by the Shaikh of Sharjah. (vii) Nai* m. The Nai’m tribe under Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan looted some camels from the Beni Qitab and the former retaliated by stealing five camels from the Nai'm. Ef forts are being made by Shaikh Rashid bin Said of Dubai to bring about a reconciliation. (viii) R ain . Towards the end of November, heavy rain fell on Abu Dhabi territory upto and including Buraimi. The rain lasted five days and formed a lake in a salty de pression some 20 miles south-west of Abu Dhabi. This lake is over 6 feet deep in parts and has already attracted numerous birds including duck and flamingo. (ix) S hooting Incident . On returning from Buraimi as mentioned in paragraph 263 above, the Political Agent and party were fired on and held up by Beni Qitab tribesmen. The Naim 'Dalil' (guide) with them nearly made matters worse by shouting that he was from the Nai'm and that they and the Beni Qitab were 'on the same road'. This remark w^s taken derisorily and it was not until Mr. Bird of the Petroleum Concessions Limited, had explained that the cars were oil company cars that the party was allowed to proceed. The excuse given by the Beni Qitab for the hold-up was that they expected Nai’m to be in the cars and we*re hostile to them as a result of the incident mentioned in paragraph 270 (vii) above. The Residency Agent unfortunately gave the Beni Qitab Rs.10/- on the party being permitted to proceed and this may encourage similar instances. 271. CORRI GEND UM.
