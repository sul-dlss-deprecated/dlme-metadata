(cV Dear Harrison, * *. t* it *- You will recollect that in your letter Ext.4075/46 of the 20th June, you forwarded a oopy of India le tter c/237 of the 5 th June containing a warning from the Political Agent at Bahrein that civil aircraft flying down the Persian Gulf must not fly across the tip of the Musandan peninsula without permission of the Sultan of Muscat. This warning was duly conveyed to Mortons Air Lines who have pointed out that the geography of the region is not well documented, and they are uncertain what precisely are the Sultan of Muscat’s territories. Their ordinary route is from Sharjah in a direct line to Jiwani, and this passes over the Peninsula between Dibba and Qalfca. It is believed that this is territory belonging to fch® Sheiks of the Trucial Coast, and that it is only the extreme tip of the Peninsula that belongs to the Sultan of Muscat. I shall be glad if you can confirm this. Yours sincerely F.A.K* Harrison, Esq., India Office, King Charles' Street S.W.1.V. Tel. No. ^ HOLBORN 3434, Ext. V#' Dear Harrison, .

Political Agent, Bahrain, reports that a civil air service styled 'Morton’s Airlines' is flying along the Arab Air route, using Dragon Rapide aircraft with landings at Bahrain and Sharjah. I should be grateful for information regarding this service and its authority for using this route. If the aircraft fly across the tip of Musandam peninsula the position will have to be regularised by obtaining the Sultan of Muscat’s permission. 3. Row that paragraph 1 of the Air Navigation Regulations in Bahrain and Kuwait has been cancelled it appears to be implied from the language of articles 1 and 9 of the Civil Air Agreements with these States, and from article 4 of the Agreements that the right to authorise territories of these States Majesty’s Government. This the fact that the restriction in old applied only to foreign aircraft, flights over and landings in the by British aircraft rests with His rigEF could, and presumably is. to exercised in the grant of the licence to the aircraft, and the provision of special power of authorisation in the Civil Air Agreements does not appear to be required. I should be glad learn whether this view is accepted as correct. If so, it appears necessary to delete the words 'by the Shaikh' from article 3 of both Civil Air Agreements mentioned, and I may kindly be author ised to effect this amendment by a further exchange of letters.
