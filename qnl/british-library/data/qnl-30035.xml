During the discussion of the matter with the Commandant the su ^ 9C t ° r * telephone facilities (the lack of them actually) naturally *ro e and I was led to enquire whether there was any scope for a public , system and whether such provision had been considered. I was much concerned to hear that the ^tate had call- for and obtained a quotation from the representatives in Bombay of an American firm manufacturing telephone equipment for ohe provision and ^Retaliation of an exchange to serve Muscat and T'uttrah. ks far as I can trace, my company, who are interested in such questions, had never been consulted and I immediately, 22na December, wired to The Divisional Manager in Karachi as fo lows: 'Sultan approached American Manufacturers regarding installation local automatic telephone system Muscat and district to be Staee operated. Could possibly influence entrust Company if authorise- a-pproach/'promptly. Sstimate initial subscribers forty ultimate maximum hundred'. The foregoing has been passed on to our Head Office in London for instructions. I will advise you immediately I receive a reply. Meanwhile I shall be obliged ii the matter can be r 3 gardted as confidential and no steps taken.

He represents a well known firm of jilectrical Contractor and is h imself an eminent electrical engineer, nis programme includes a visit to Iraq and Iran and he has promised to visit me on his way up the Persian Gulf and if possible stay here for a short while. I shall be writing to him by the ne^t mail reminding him of his promise and enquiring when I may hope to see him. His advice electricity supply and power station capita-u cost will I am sure be very valuable to you. If you wish I wil^. ask hxm as a personal favour to me to give me a very approximate idea of the probable cost of the equipment for a 100 K.v/. deisel driven plant subdivided into two or three units, explaining that he will be helping me in a matter which is really outside my province but very definitely within his.

POLITICAL AGENCY, MUSCAT, 1 Dated 27th March, 1946. To The hon'ble the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bushire . Memoranuum. His Highness the Sultan has been recently considering the introduction of a modem telephone system in the towns of Muscat and Mutrah and it is understood that he has been in com munication with an American firm in regard to a contract for its installation. 2. The Officer-in-Cherge, Cable &amp; Wireless Limited, Muscat, who was apparently informed of this, referred the matter to his Head Office, but received the reply that Cable &amp; Wireless Limited were not interested in securing a contract for tl is work. 3. It is very desirable that, if possible, any contract of this nature should go to a British firm end it is clear that, in view of local circumstances, arrangements with Cable ft Wire less Limited for this undertaking would be the most satisfactory. Maintenance and repairs could probably oe undertaken without any increase in their present engineering staff at Muscat and they are the only firm in a position to effectively supervise and control the xork of operators and others employed for the running of an exchange, and the maintenance of telephone lines and ins truments. It is to be hoped that the force of these practical considerations would be sufficient to outweigh any reluctance His Highnecs may feci in dealing with Cable &amp;. tireless Limited as a result of the intention to nationalise this company. 4. If no objection is seen, therefore, it is requested that the matter be referred to Ceble ft Tireless Limited in the hope thatmmmmm /-N - 2 - they may be able to reconelder their earlier decision. It may be mentioned here that the installation of a telephone system will have to await the erection of a satisfactory ge nerating station for electric power, concerning which this Agency is in correspondence with the English Electric Co., Limited, 249 Hornby Road, Bombay.

The facts, as we understand them, are as follows:- At the end of December, 1945 the Sultan of Muscat approached an American manufacturer regarding the installation of a local automatic telephone system in Muscat and district to provide for 4D&gt; rising to 100 subscribers, the installation to be State-owned. The Company’s Manager at Muscat, when conveying to us the above information, said that the Sultan might be persuaded to entrust the installation and operation to us if we so desired. We have close working relations with the British organisation, the Automatic Telephone and Electric Company, Ltd., and as the Muscat telephone proposal appeared to be a matter of more interest to that organisation than to ourselves, we replied to our Manager that we were not particularly interested but had passed the information to the aoove- mentioned Company. We learnt later that Major Hirst, Military Adviser to the Sultan of Muscat, had visited Karachi in January, 1946 in order to contact the Indian agents of the Automatic Telephone and Electric Comnanv. and that subsequently that firm wasn 2 . the necessary questionnaire has been prepared and submitted to Major Hirst and that as soon as his reply is received, the appropriate quotation will be made without delay.

It is understood from the Automatic Telephone and Electric Company that their activity in the event of their tender being accepted would be limited to the supply and installation of the equipment, and it may therefore be ttecessary at a later stage to ask your Company to undertake the operation of the system. The consideration of this question may however perhaps be postponed until it has been decided whether the Automatic Telephone Company will in fact install the I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant t f.

The Divisional Manager of Cable V.ireless Limited states quite openly that as a result of the Company's none too happy experiences with telephones in Bahrain and Kuwait, there have been no very strenuous moves regarding the proposed Muscat installation, and have been waiting for further information from the manufacturers as to the availability of the necessary apparatus. It is suggested that this matter is left for further discussion with the India Office and Cable &amp; Wireless Limited in London.

I have received a questionnaire from, the Automatic Telephone &amp; Electric Co., Ltd which I am forwarding to you. I regret that it is not possible to reply to many of the points noted and think it would be of mor« assistance to you if I gave you our requirements on broad lines. 1. The existing nains supply is D.C. 2. The mains supply, if provided by the Consulate Power House is reliable, if supplied by the State Power House it is doubtful. 3. There is no particular building selected for housing the equipment as yet. 4. Initially 50 lines would be required, it is not possible to give any accurate estimate of the possible exoansion but it is not thought that it would ever exceed 200. 5. Strowgers RAX 50-8B appears to be the most suitable equipment. I imagine that when it became overloaded another .could be added quite easily ? 6. The type of wire which would be suitable for distance over 1^ miles would be 150 Lbs per mile iron wire or ^0 Lbs per mile bronze. The distance between the two adjacent towns of Muscat and Mattrah is approximately 3 miles. It is presumed that if the exchange was situated between the two towns a lighter wire could used.

So far as I can discover from my records our interest in telephone system arose from an unofficial report that Sultan was consulting an American firm on subject. I have no indication that he ever has tanra asked for our help or that we have officially suggested to him that Cable and Wireless should instal the system. 3* In the circumstances unless you see objection, I propose telegraphing Sultan informing him that Cable and Y/ireless have an expert in the area who would be willing to visit Muscat to examine the question of installng a telephone system without any charge stated and suggesting that Sultan should avail himself of opportunity which had presented itself. 4* In any case I think Sultan should be consulted before Col.

The Sultan of Muscat, Muscat, PERSIAN GULF. ' Dear Sir, 50/200 Line R.A.X. for Muscat We regret the delay which has occurred in forwarding our quotation for the above, but at the time of your enquiry, our R.A.X. equipment was under review and certain alterations have since been made in the design of these units. We are pleased to inform you, however, that our pricing is now complete and full details of price and delivery are shown on the ^attached tender. The equipment is of the latest type and a general description of it is given in the Engineering Notes and Engineering Bulletin No.400/1, copies of which we enclose. Reference is made in the former to calls originated by coin box subscribers. This feature is controlled by a public telephone rel^y group. Its operation is such that when ohe operator at the manual exchange answers an incoming call from a coin box subscriber on the R.A.X., a tone is connected to the line and transmitted to the operator. This tone lasts for a period of twelve seconds and indicates to the operator that the call originated irom a pay stationi. We would point out that the operation of this f eature is dependent upon the employment of a ’loop-calling’ type coin box.2 24/2/47 Ext.438/47 Technical Adviser to H.H. The Sultan of Muscat, Muscat, PERSIAN GULP. Two bothway auto-to- manual relay sets are included in the equipment offered on the assumption that the R.A.X. will work into a magneto exchange. This quantity is ■considered adequate for an exchange of this size. It is also assumed that line terminating equipment is available for junction lines at the exchange and, therefore, no provision has been made for such equipment in our tender. We understand that a reliable D.C. mains supply is available at Muscat, and this supply is recommended for operating the automatic exchange. If, however, it is necessary to utilize an unreliable supply, certain nations would be necessary ir^connection with the jquipment included in our tender. 3 trust you will find our offer acceptable and shall ised to furnish any further information required.

ELECTRA HOUSE, MUSCAT, OMAN, PERSIAN GULF. IN REPLY REFER TO 1st September 1 j47. iierevrith a letter just received iron my Divisional suitable for submission to the Sultan and will supply you with a copy and shall be glad if you will return the actual letter to me. Briefly, it provides very adequately for all forseeable requirements of Muscat and Mutrah for some years to come at very reasonable tariffs. A single normal automatic line, will cost Rs. 30 per quarter with 300 free calls per quarter and there will be an initial installation charge of Rs. 25. On this basis it is not anticipated that the system will be a profitable concern, initially at all events, so that should the Sultan wish to derive revenue from it I shall have to inform my Head Office of any extra charges he wished to levy. The plan referred to in Paragraph 11 is in my office and if you are interested to see it perhaps you would look in when convenient. Paragraph 9 which has been excised refers only to ^ i 4- A ■v* r*-* /'-y. to 4- /-*• ^ -.o to ~ _ to o. to o ^ „ _ _ _ the Company r s accounting arrangements for any expenses incurred on the project. Prom paragraph 12 it appears that I have to see that the proposal is submitted to the Sultan as soon as possible - by the first mail, I hope - and transmit his decision to my Head Office. The importance of this being obtained promptly lies in the fact that Col. Bloodworth is now in the U. K* placing orders for apparatus required for other similar projects in this area and, if the Sultan’s acceptance reaches him in time, Muscat ’s requirements can be included with this order. The estimated time of IS months to 2 years for completion is based on this assumption. A small delay in acceptance is iimrfHKg: therefore certain to involve a very much greater dei&amp;y in completion. I will call to discuss any details^ and hear t .rough what channel you think the proposal should go forward to H# H., at your nnnvsxKrinE: convenience. The Political Agent &amp; H*H.

It concerns reports that the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] is considering introducing a telephone system (consisting of around 80-100 connections) to the towns of Muscat and Matrah (transliteration varies throughout).The file features the following principal correspondents: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Secretary of State for India; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman; representatives of the India Office, the Commonwealth Relations Office, Cable and Wireless Limited, and the Automatic Telephone and Electric Company.The correspondence covers the following: the British authorities' concerns that the contract for the proposed work should go to a British firm, with Cable and Wireless Limited being considered the prime candidate; Cable and Wireless's initial reluctance to take an interest in the proposed installation, following 'none too happy' experiences with telephone systems in Bahrain and Kuwait; the submission of a tender in February 1947 by the Automatic Telephone and Electric Company for the supply of telephone equipment to Muscat; proposals submitted in September 1947 by Cable and Wireless for the installation of a telephone system in Muscat and Muttrah, including details of installation costs, and a stated intention to invite tenders for the supply of material in the form of sub-contracts.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Automatic Telephone and Electric Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Telephone companies</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India and Burma, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Cable and Wireless Ltd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commonwealth Relations Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Telephone</topic></subject><subject><topic>Telecommunications</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000037#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
