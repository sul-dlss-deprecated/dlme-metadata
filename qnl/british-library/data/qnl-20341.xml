In accordance with instructions froai our nut al friends the iion f ble ther Resident in the persit.n Oulf a id H.E the High Gommr, Iraq t I \ rite to explain to Y.H. the difficulties which arise in connection with the issue of oassports in Bahrain. The norual proco iding,if there were a British Consul in Y.H's terr tories would be for the traveller after talcing a io«isaport from /our officials to have it vis* by the British Consul to shew that there was no ob ection to his landing in the country of destination, Since however there is no Consul in your do;iains, the Consul in Bahrain uust perform the functions i 3 far a passports i -re concerned, '.ven if Y, had a consul in B hrain 'j he wore to is^ue passports it would still be necessary for the bearer to h: ve it vise by the British representative here if ho intended to travel to any British possession or elsewhere but 1 s you hive no Consul the \A. cts s Consul in the e natters for all foreigners. The reason ^or this is that H.r.Gr have longstanding rgrei art with H.I]. the 3uler of Bahrain whereby no foreign consuls . re permitted in B^.hrain. -ven if H.I-.Gr \ ere to -r • e to one of r our subjects i 3Uing x^assoorts here,such . -tion would at one confer upon him fie status of Consul, since all th ■ world over such duties are onl. per orne by Consuls. This would affar^d op ^ortunities for other states such r 3 Persia, Iraq etc to seek pernio ion for a consul at 3r hrain,t st ta of affairs in which, in vie T , of ihe agree..ant with ihaii v sa,H.K. 5. could not acquiesc '. The ..lost saitabl^ arrangement therefore se-ns to your friend,thrt Y.H. shoul issue orders for the ia^ue of passports to your subjects before they leave your territory.In fact this will proba ly be aore con- venie .t dnce Y.H. will be in a position to tuice steps to ensure that no one leaves without a pass. On iirrivs 1 here, if they wish to [ X ^roceed elsewhere the oassnort vill be vised by your friend in ord r tb t it nay be acceptable in the couitry they desire to visit.

Many thanks for your letter of the 5th May returning papers re Bin Saud. Since then, events in Bahrain have rushed to a head and the state of affairs, as I anticipated has developed to such an extent that the passport question has gone into the bgCckground, We have had to remove Sheikh Isa from active participation in Bahrain affairs, though he still enjoys the titular dignity of the Sheikh of Bahrain and remains on the island. We have practically removed Bin Saud * s agent and intimated to the Sultan of Nejd that, if any agent is necessary, we expect him to consult H.M.Govt, as to whether such an agent is a persona grata. His reply is awaited. It is kind of you to say that you are glad to think we are once more serving fairly close to one another. I hardly thfrik it will be for long as I expect to go in October or November next, when Trevor returns. I wonder if you agree with me and Daly that Bin Saud's reply to Cox' letter about his subsidy being withdrawn shows that he has either wilfully misunderstood or failed to appreciate the purport of the letter. I shall have to be applying soon officially for your cecords dealing with Kuwait, Bahrain and Bin Saud f s affairs to enable me to deal intelligently with problems that will arise, I hope I may rely on your good offices to hurry them on to me when the time comes. I leave for Kuwait tomorrow but shall not, I hope, stay long.

British Residency and Consuiatd-General f Bushire, 26th July 1923 • Copy of the undermentioned paper is forwarded with oompliments , with r eferenoe to this office endorsement Ho. 316 -S dated 23rd June, to the Political ^gent, Babwin, who la requested to tnlw steps to issue to the Nejd ^u^iio in Bahrain, unless he saes objection ) in ^hioh oaae ha is requested to report immediately, the notifioatlon dasired by the Sultan of Hejd, informing them of the arrangement, which has been arrived at on the subject of Hejd passports. 2. The Political ¥ywt ax Resident considers that this arrangement will no doubt need watching for seme time, and it is impossible to disguise from oneself the danger of some Nejdi by origin prefer±n^ to oonaider himself either a subject of the Shaikh of Bahrain or possibly «ven a natural ised British subject. Any cases of this kind should b® immediately reported , but as a general working arrangement it is hoped that the present will suffice for the needs of the bulk of the community. 3. The Political ^gent is requested to raport the action t^ten on this endorsement so that a report to the Government of India and the Secretary of State may issue in due course.

Knox makes no suggestion as to how Nejdis travelling direct to India SiO^.1^ o'tain Biitish visas . Lord eel has not up to the present received any communication from the Government of Irda on the subject , but as the question will probably be raised in course, and as Irai is also concerned therein, he woali^ suggest that 1 ol.

Knox is asked lor further observations , especially in regard to how Nejdis travel ing direct to India should obtain pritish visas . ^s you will no doubt mickly appreciate , the reason for his mak ing no suggestion is that the number of ^'ejada who travel to India direct without passing through either Bahrain, Kuwait or possibly Muscat , must be so very limited that their cases could probably be dealt with individually by India without much trouble and he has tl^relore not thought it necessary to raise the point .

The i^olitlcal Resident has decided that as the question of translating the term 'Political Agent' into an Arabic phrase readily intelligible along the Arab Coast from Kuwait to Muscat presents difficulties, the best solution of the problem is to transliterate the words 'Political Agent' into Arabic characters. In India such words as 'Leputy Commissioner' 'Collector' etc. arc used freely in Urdu in their transliterated form, as also is the term 'Consul' on the Arab Coast. lie translit- -eration of the term 'Political Agent' therefore, in the opinion of the resident, constitutes no new departure from recognisec custom in such matters on the Arab Coast or in India. I am to request you to amend both the hnglish and Arabic versions of the endorsement by simply aubstitut- -ing the words 'Political Agent' for 'Consul'.

Pleas® refer to your D .0.NO.491-S of 27tii August, I have delved in the old records of this Agency and found that the British representative at Muscat was commissioned as a Consul in Marcn 1863; 'before that he was called officially British Agent, Old Arabic letters show that he was addressed 'before 1862 as 'Valcil ud daulati aulia' or 'NailD ud daulati In- -Slisift' or as variation of these two. Since 1863 he has been addressed as '•Balius' or * Consul* and rarely as 'Vajcil as Siasi' wnich latter is the literal translation of Political Agent,The term'Balius' does not appear to te Arabic but is possibly a corruption of a Portuguese word. The Omanis make no distinction between the Consul at Muscat and the political Agents at Bahrain and Kuwait and refer to them when they have occasion To Captain G^L.Mallam, Secretary to the Political Besldent in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIBE, &gt;0</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000217_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/562</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000217</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/562</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 61/9 (D 109) Nejd passports'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1922/1924</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-09-02T11:55:25</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (109 folios)</extent><extent>The volume is arranged chronologically.</extent><extent>Foliation: the sequence starts at the front of the volume on the tile page (f 1) and ends on the inside back cover (f 107).

The majority of the correspondence is between the Political Resident in Bushire (Arthur Trevor, later Stuart Knox); the Political Agent in Bahrain (Clive Daly); the Political Agent in Kuwait (James More); the High Commissioner in Baghdad (Percy Cox, later Henry Dobbs); the Colonial and Foreign Offices, both in London; the British Consulate in Damascus; and Ibn Sa'ud.The whole of the volume relates to the issuing of passports and visas to the subjects of Najd. The file opens with correspondence concerning the issuing of Najdi passports in Bahrain and British disapproval of it. The question of whether visas are required by Najdi subjects travelling to British possessions and protectorates then follows, with details on such procedures in Syria, Iraq, Trans-Jordan, and Palestine. Discussion of the idea of an official British endorsement required on all Najdi passports is also contained in the volume, with particular coverage of what terms to use when referring to the various British political offices in Arabic, which varies from country to country.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consulate, Damascus</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Travel documents</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000217#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
