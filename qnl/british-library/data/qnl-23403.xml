On discussing the matter further there is another point which I had not considered which is the question of the Royalty which we recieve on the Landing Companyâ€™s charges. If there is any possibility of our not recieving this I think it would be better not to allow any steamers* to go round to Sitrah. As you know the possibility of the mail boats going to the Sitrah harbour was spoken of several weeks ago by Russell and he mentioned the possibility of this German boat going there to me a few days ago and was told by me that he would have to make an application to the Government. A copy of the letter to de Grenier was sent to me but I did not open it at the time.Dated, the 8th April 1934. Vy dear BeIgrave, With reference to your demi-official letter dated the 30th March 1934 about the S.S.Heunfele going round to Sitrah, I presume that it has been made clear in writing to the Besopotamia Persia Corporation Limited (a) that the previous permission of the Bahrain Govemnent is needed for steamers to use any anchorage off Bahrain other than the regular harbour and (b) that, should permission be desired, reasonable notice should be given so that the Bahrain Government may have an opportunity of considering the request and any implications which may arise from it* Yours sincerely, r C*Dalrymple Belgrave Esquire Adviser to the iahrain Government, Bahrain*D. 0 //JAW .3 Bahrain, April 12, 1934. Dear Colonel Looh, With reference to your D.0/583-6/63 dated 8th April 1934. I think both these points were clearly indicated in my letter to Russell. I have discussed the matter with him again since then and he understands what he should do should the matter arise again. Yours sincerely, Lieut-Colonel C. Loch, I.A., H. B.
