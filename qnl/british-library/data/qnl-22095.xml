(a) Number of out-patients 12,740 (b) w * in-door patients Nil (c) n w Operations ( ail minor surgical pperations) 467 (d) No epiaemla of any of the major infectious disease occurred during the year. Tne incidence of malaria decreased from 2683 for 1046 to 2146 f or 1047. This is undoubtedly due to the anti-malarial measures carried out by the Bahrain Government. Many of the cases were relapses of old infectious, as the local populace seldom if ever submit to a complete course of treatment. Gastro intestinal and intestinal parasitic ixifections are about the Habit same, as the infections of food by flies, and the insanitary/of tne population nave not yet improved to any appreciable extent. (e) Small Pox. There were no cases reported for tais year.

(incorporated in England,) ^ Dear Sir, With reference to your Confidential letter No* C/23 of 6th instant, we append a brief summary of working conditions for the year 1947. Money* Money was plentiful in the bazaar throughout the year. A feature of the early part of the year was the influx of rupee coin from various parts of the Gulf to such an extent that the Banks were compelled, through lack of storage space, to suspend receiving coin until arrangements could be made to ship surplus stocks to India. At the close of the year, an influx of hundred-rupee notes took place. Exchange. Exchange rates were unchanged throughout the year. Indian funds from bazaar sources were not too plentiful owing to the cessation of pearl sales to India and later, when overseas accounts in India became 'non-resident', local supplies of Indian funds practically ceased. Bazaar rates varied from 8 %0 premium to 2$ discount at the close, with more sellers than buyers. The dollar allocation given to Bahrain in the earlty part of the year was soon used up and no further dollar exchange was made available. Trade. The Island had a very active year in trading, with deliveries of consumer goods becoming more easy towards the end of the year though heavy goods plant, machinery and equipment - are still slow.

The numbers were not significant. Typhoid and Paratyphoid occurred sporadically. There was no single Cholera case. Prophylactic Measures . 1. Smallpox has practically been stamped out, due to the mass vaccinations of the past few years. 1499 vaccinations were carried out this year. The port health regulations with their quarantine section have also largely contributed to this success. This year, the first on record, no Smallpox patients were seen. 2. Enteric . T.A.B. inoculations are more and more asked for, 485 being given this year. Town sanitation and general cleanliness has also improved. 3. Cholera . Rigid precautions prevented this disease entering the island. i N.B No grave major epidemics have been recorded other than smallpox, for over 20 years.GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. 3 Malaria * Anti-malarial measures continue on a wide scale and at great cost* This is the eighth year of control. Not only is it effective in the milder Benign Tertian May - June season, but the malignant incidence in the November - December period has been very substa/ntially reduced the last 2 years. Figures this year show a 7.7# incidence of all disease seen, which with 1946 are the lowest recorded results, and compare favourably with the 22# figure of the years before control. Venereal Disease . Patients continue to come in large numbers for long courses of treatment, and in earlier stages of the disease. The later manifestations are not now so commonly seen. Numbers are slowly declining, being 1110 this year as compared with 1326 in 1946. General Comment k good year of health. No smallpox for the first time.

Summary of the working of the Imperial Bank of Iran, Bahrain, for the year 1947, During 1947 the Bank's activities continued to expand mainly in connection with the finance of Bahrain's trade which appeared to us to continue to show healthy growth. V/e did not attract a large number of new current ac counts as we had done the previous year but that was only to ^oe expected. There was however a tendency for the total number of our depositors to increase. The average amount on deposit was considerably lower and this reflect^d^the absorbtion^of x^re- viously idle money into active trade. The highest figure for deposits during the year was 32 lacs and the lowest, which was touched in August was 20 lacs. The end of the year saw a heavy demand for accommodation by way of overdraft on current account. Our Cash position was strong and we were well able to meet this. We ^noticed that the facilities we offer for banking business with Kuwait and Dubai, where we have branches, were much more used by the bazar than previously and this enabled us to reduce our rates. The year was noteworthy for the complete absence of pearl exchange. Exports from Bahrain to India were impossible duetto the prohibition of the entry of pearls into India. Our total operations in Foreign Exchange, including India rupees v/ere Purchases Kps .12, 68 ,363. Sales '» 49,05,270. 'Purchases would have been much larger had there been any pearl exchange on offer. We repatriated to India 19 lacs in notes and 72 ' lacs in coin, sales of exchange were practically entirely against imports which were mostly from the United Kingdom and India. Sales were made mainly against shipping documents either under Credits or received for Collection. The flow of good arriv ing illustrates the expanding production of the United Kingdom. We noticed that merchants prefer to buy British goods provided delivery dates are not too far forward. For The/Imperial Bank of Iran ManagerGOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT.

The following were the Ruling Shaikhs of the various States on the Trucial Coast throughout the year: (1) Dubai (2) Sharjah (3) Abu Dhabi (4) Ajman (5) Ras al Khaimah (6) Kalba Shaikh Said bin Maktum, O.B.E. « Sultan bin Saqr al Qasirai ' Shakhbut bin Sultan bin Zayid » Rashid bin Humaid *» Sultan bin Salim M Hamad bin Sa»id (minor) Regentj Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad 3.

On the 14th January the Iraqi Arab Levies were withdrawn from Sharjah. The strength of the R.A.E. in Sharjah has been considerably reduced. At the end of the year the number of R.A.P. personnel was 46. The R.A.F. Medical Officer has also been withdrawn. During the year surplus R.A.P. vehicles and stores were sold by British Stores Disposals Officers, who came down to Sharjah for the purpose.- 2 - 5» British Interests* (i) Petroleum Development (Trucia.1 Coa st) Limited* During the early part of the year Petroleum Development (Trucial Coatet) Ltd. completed a geophysical survey of Sharjah and Has al Khaimah territories. The geophysical party met with constant interference from the many tribes inhabiting these Shaikhdoms and the Political Officer and the Residency Agent were continually and actively exercised in promoting settlements between the tribes and “their ruling Shaikhs, without which the company could not have proceeded with their work. Most of the interfeience arose from the Jawasim Shaikhs* parsimony towards and lack of influence over the tribes inhabiting the territories for which they had given oil concessions. A geophysical survey of Abu Dhabi was then begun and continued until the end of March when operations were concluded for the season. The survey party left the Trucial Coast on the 1st April. On the 11th October they returned to Sharjah for the 1947 - 48 cool season* s operations. Geophysical and topographical surveys were started simultaneously in Abu Dhabi.territory and that part of Buraimi which is under Abu Dhabi. Work in the latter area had been completed by the end of the year. The Company*i local representative did not succeed in obtaining permission from the chiefs of the Nai*m and al-Bushmis tribes to do geophysical work in their territories. They put forward such unreasonable demands that his principals decided to drop the matter for the time being. Work during the latter part of the year proceeded without any opposition or inter ference by recalcitrant tribesmen or common robbers. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi’s security for oil company personnel has been complete; and the party's main problem has been one of transport. During the year under review Mr. H.M. Jackson continued to represent Messrs. Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited. He visited most of the Trucial Coast towns and also Buraimi.( ) Civil Aviation. On the 10th January the last 'C” Class Plying boat to fly on this route left Dubai. Since the^E.O.A.C. have not used their bases in Dubai and Sharjah except ao emergency landing areas. V/ireless and meteorological servic s have been maintained^ and also catering services on a reduced scale. International Air Radio took over the wire less installations towards the end of the year. A number of casual operators and through services used B.O.A.C^s facilities; but, for passenger and freight spare and for the carriage of mails, local residents have had to rely on the R.A.F. routine services to their station at Sharjah. The following are particulars of aircraft which passed through Sharjah during the year 1947s B.O.A.C. 18 Eastbound &amp; Westbound K.L.M. 61 do Other air- 113 do craft (handled by B.O.A.C.) Following the ban imposed by the Government of India on the landing of Dutch aircraft in India, K.L.M. aircraft used Sharjah as a staging post on the Batavia Amsterdam route from August to October. (C) tertf) Shipping., During the period under report 24 ships at called/Sharjah and 32 ships at Dubai. /J\ (iv) The Golden Valley Ochre and Oxide Company . Mining for red oxide on Abu Musa Island was continued until the 9th May when Mr. E.Innes Pocock, of the Golden Valley Ochre &amp; Oxide Company, Limited, returned to the United Kingdom. 1000 tons of red oxide from Abu Musa and about 70 tons from Sir Abu Na'Air Island were shipped to England by S.S. Beharistan. On the 23rd September Mr. Innes Pocock returned to Abu Musa and recommenced operations on the Island early in October. He was still working there at the end of the year. His operations were hampered towards4 0 the end of the year by the Shaikh of Sharjah^ taxing the labourers working in the mines and attempting to secure the dismissal of those subjects of other Shaikhs from whom he was unable to extort a large portion of their earnings. of Iran, which had only recently been opened in Dubai, was to a large extent on probation to the commercial community. The greatest call was on their service as exchange dealers and some caution was at first shown by merchants in depositing funds with them. The advantages of having a bank account are now more widely recognised and the use of the cheque as a means of exchange has greatly increased. The bank’s principal dealings in exchange were with India, with their other Persian Gulf branches, and with Basra, where the Trucial Coast wheat quota was purchased. A slight but welcome increase has been perceptible in trade with the United Kingdom and the sterling area. The bank are fostering this as far as possible — the main difficulties being the relatively small market for British goods (largely owing to the state of depression now prevalent) and the inability of most of the merchants to correspond in English. The bank are endeavouring to develop the merchants contacts with United Kingdom firms and think they will be able to give useful service in this field. The demand for other facilities normally associated with a bank — such as safe deposit facilities and the issue of travellers cheques — has been very slight. Order-in-Council, 1946, was brought into force on the Trucial Coast. By the Order-in-Council H.M.G. assumed Jurisdiction over all persons in the Trucial States other than subjects of the Trucial Shaikhs. Since the Order was brought into force some progress has been made in acquainting foreigners with our judicial administration and in establishing joint courts, . tv) Imperial Bank of Iran. At the beginning of the year the Imperial Bank (vi) Order-in-council. On the 26th April, 1947, the Trucial States5 although not all foreigners who hs-ve complaints against subjects of the Shaikhs yet bring their complaints to the Agency in the first instance. Certain of the Shaikhs refer joint cases to the Agency immediately they are received; others are being asked to do so. Meanwhile, foreigners whose cases are first\ decided by the Shaikhs tend to biing them to the Agency if they get no satisfaction from them. 6. Officers 1 Tours.

The Ruler of Ajman came to the Agency in the afternoon and called on the Political Resident, who proceeded to Ajman by car shortly afterwards and returned the Shaikh’s call. On the 23rd the Political Resident left for Dubai by L.V. Nearchus. The Shaikh of Dubai called on the Political Resident on board and the Political Resident returned the call at the Shaikh’s palace. In the evening L.V. Nearchus left Dubai and reached Ras al Khaimah on the morning of the 24th. The Political e * Resident exchange calls with the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah and had lunch with him. ^He then visited Rams and spent the rest of the day shooting partridges in the Jiri. In the evening the Political Resident left for Bakha and arrived there on the 25th. He left Bakha the same day, visited Sha'am and returned to Ras al Khaimah at sunset. The morning of the 26th the Resident again devoted to shooting in the Jiri nd thenWcontinued his journey hy road to Umm al Qawain, •fi- 6 - arriving there at noon* After lunching with the Shaikh, the Political Resident and his party returned to Sharjah and left for Bahrain on the Kearchus the same day* Throughout the tour Lieutenant-Colonel A*C* Galloway took the opportunity to discuss outstanding cases with the Political Officer and had a number of conferences with the Shaikhs concerned* On the 15th April Kr* C.J* Pelly, O.E*E., Political Agent, Bahrain, arrived at Sharjah* He visited Dubai in the morning of the 16th and in the afternoon called on the Shaikhs of Ajman and Umm al Qawain.

The following were the most common diseases on the Trucial Coast: Eye diseases Venereal diseases Teeth and gum diseases Digestive System diseases Ulcerative and inflammatory diseases* In November a suspected case of cholera was reported in Dubai. Every possible precautionary measure vas taken, including inoculation of the public both in Dubai and Sharjah. About one fourth of the population of both towns7 was inoculated. No further case occured and it is presumed that the suspected case was not* in fact* cholera. The quarantine restrictions caused very considerable dislocation and adversely affected trade for some weeks afterwards. 8 . Postal Services. During the year a Sub-Post Office was opened in Sharjah for two days a week as an experiment. The amount cf postal business transacted did not justify its continuation. Air mail services were interrupted when B.O.A.C ! s M C M Class flying boats ceased to call at Dubai. Arrangements were later made to fly mails to Bahrain in R.A.P* aircraft. On the 29th October Mr. V. Appleby of the British General Post Office accompanied by Khan Sahib Abdul Hamid* Superintendent* Civil Engineering* Post Offic* Hyderabad* visited Dubai to study the problems involved in the transfer of the Dubai Post Office from the Government of Pakistan to H.M.G. 9. Local Affairs. (i) Dubai - Abu Dhabi dispute. The armed conflict between Abu Dhabi and Dubai which arose last year over the ownership of Khor Ghanadha was being actively prosecuted by Abu Dhabi at the beginning of the year. Shaikh Jumah bin Maktum, brother of tYe Ruler of Dubai, who had been one of the min obstacles to a settle ment last year was ordered by the Political Resident to reside in Bahrain until further notice, and economic sanctions were enforced against Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan bin Zayid of Abu Dhabi. These measures resulted in the settlement of the dispute on the 6th March. The cessation of hostilities was greeted with jubili-tion by subjects of both Shaikhs. On the 8th May Shaikh Shakhbut came to Sharjah and met Shaikh Sai’d bin Maktum O.B.E., Ruler of Dubai* at the Agency. Unfortunately the settlement proved to be only temporary,for shortly afterwards Shaikh Shakhbut failed to fulfil his undertaking to bring his allies into the settlement; and*although he was repeatedly called upon by the Political Agent to act in accordance with the peace treaty which he had signed* he declared that he was unable to do so and alleged that he exercised no control over his former allies* The chief of these, the Manasir, then restarted their depredations against Dubai* Economic sanctions were re-imposto against Abu Dhabi and continued up to the end of the year • After forbearing to retaliate for the first raid, in November the Shaikh of Dubai sent a pursuit party after a large force of Manasir that raided his territory a second time* They overtook the raiders at Soat, north of Liwa, and inflicted very heavy casualties on them* Indeed, the casualties of 56 killed and 20 wounded on the Manasir side - including the leader of the Manasir force wounded - and 5 fatal casualties among the Dubai force are said to be the heaviest suffered in a tribal fight on the Trucial Coast within living memory; and many think that the power of those sections: of the Manasir that are allied to Abu Dhabi has been seriously curtailed if not broken for some time to come* (ii) Jawasim. The Jawasim Shaikhs of Sharjah and Ras al Khaimah together with their cousin Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad, Regent of Kalba, prove, as we gain experience of them, more and mor4 conclusively their impotence and incapacity to rule* Neither the Shaikh of Sharjah nor the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah was able to facilitate the work of the oil company in his Shaikhdom without the intervention of the Political Officer, while the Shaikhs of Hira and of the Beni Qitab openly defied Sharjah and were only brought to terms by the payment of allowances of Rs* 5000/- and Rs. 30,000/- a year respectively. The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah has been at loggerheads with his nephews, and the dispute was not settled until he satisfied them financially. The affairs of Kalba under the regency of Shaikh Khalid and the de facto control of his nephew Humaid bin Abdullah have gone from bad to worse. The administration of justice and the maintenance of securityhave been entirely neglected* and such power as Humaid commands has been devoted to the extortion of excessive taxes and forced loans from the subjects of the State. In fact* none of the Jawasim Shaikhs has used what force or influence he commands to oppose the strong in protection of the weak. They prefer to befriend law-breakers of whom they are frightened and to use such pow'er as they have to extort money and goods from the poor and humble of their subjects* who most need their protection and succour. Indeed* their subjects go in as much fear of depredations by their not Shaikhs as by robbers. This practice has-been without effect. Persian merchants hitherto established in Sharjah and Has al Khaimah are moving away to Dubai* and villages on the extremities of their domains are turning to the Shaikh of Fujairah for protection. They are now paying their taxes to him because they have found that he gives them some return for them in security. In Dfcibai, too, the emphasis has been on the Ruler's duty towards his subjects rather than on his claims to their property. Security there and in Abu Dhabi has been almost complete and both Rulers are obeyed and greatly respected by their subjects. The Shaikh of Dubai and also the Shaikh of Fujairah (who is most active and whose influence is steadily increasing) have themselves undertaken the punishment of robbers who loot their subjects within Jawasim limits because they knowing that they can get no satisfaction from the Jaswasim Shaikhs. The same is true of Ajman and Uram al qawain; and Ajman has recently assumed, at the request of the inhabitants, jurisdiction over Masfut* formerly under Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan of the Nai»m* because the latter was unable to protect the inhabitants from the Beni Ka*ab. (iii) Slavery. During the year under repbrt there have been some cases of abduction of persons into slavery from Sharjah, Dubai and other parts of the Trucial Coast and the Batinah. Persons abducted were taken to Hamasah, Buraimi* by land and sold to Saudi and Qatar slave dealers* who took most of themto Saudi Arabia on camels* Strong representations have been made to the Shaikhs of Dubai and Sharjah, and the Shaikh of Dubai has expelled from Dubai one Khalifah bin Majid, a notorious slave-dealer, and has recovered three persons who were abducted from Dubai* Most of the bedouin involved in the abductions from Sharjah were of the Beni Qitab, against whom the Shaikh of Sharjah dare not take any action. The Residency Agent visited Buraimi during the year, made enquiries in Hamasah about the slave trade, and did all he could to suppress it* He also arranged for three abducted women to be retained in Hamasah until they could be recovered through the Shaikhs of Dubai and Sharjah, from whose territories they had been abducted* (iv) Piracy. There has been no complaint against any of the subjects of the Trucial Shaikhdoms of their having engaged in piracy during the year* (v) Economic * Trade has been depressed throughout the year* Expbrts to Persia have considerably decreased; and many merchants who held large amounts in Persian currency have lost nearly half their capital — the exchange rate between the toman and the rupee having fallen from par to Rs. 60/- to Ts* 100/-* The depression has been accentuated by the ban on the import of pearls into India and by the curtailment of expenditure by H.M.G’a defence services. This curtailment has not yet been made good by the activities of the oil company. There is much unemployment and many subjects of the Trucial Shaikhs have gone to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Kowait in search of work. (vi) Communications. The motor track between Dubai and Muscat through the Wadi el Qaur has been used much more frequently since local taxi owners were able to buy surplus military vehicles from the R.A.P. Security on the road between Dubai and the11 m W eastern end of the V.adi el Qaur, most of which lies in Jaswasim territory, has been bad. A number of armed robberies have taken place. !/(a - Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah,&lt;2f&lt;?

There were 414 theft cases reported to the police as against 411 during the previous year. There was a decrease in attempts to smuggle goods out of Bahrain. There were 130 traffic accidents in which five persons lost their lives. One case of murder occurred in which an Iraqi stabbed his cousin. At the end of the year an underground movement of irresponsible youths attempted to stir up polit ical trouble by distributing anonymous leaflets to the public. No arrests were made. 3. Administration . During the year the dearness allowances paid to the Bahrain Government staff was increased. ?£r. R.C. Tunnicliffe, Officer-in-Charge, P.W.D. went to England on sick leave and later died there. , s«3 /— - 2 - 4. Pearl Industry . The pearl industry suffered a severe set back owinc to the embargo inpose 1 ^ b./ the Government of India on the import of pearls into India. Hainly as a result of this only half the usual number of boats went out to the pearl banks. The Government advanced money to a number of Nakhudas to enable them to finance their boats. 5. publ ic y/orks . The new customs dheds were completed, the buildings have roofs of asbestors sheeting and cement floors. A new passport office and a shed for the inspection of passengers luggage were built at the entrance to the pier. The new p. 7. T J. office, stores, sheds and Officer-in-Charge, P.W.D.’s flat were completed and work was begun on nine shops in Barrett Road on the site of what was formerly the customs importshed. Material for the new buildings which had been ordered about two years before arrived in Bahrain. Mr. Stanley Hills was appointed Officer-in-Charge, P.V/*D. but did not arrive from the Sudan during the year under review. 6. Mun icipalities . V/ork was begun on a large sc^le to metal the main roads in Manama. “The Municipalities were able during the year to acquire more vehicles. A line of four houses was completed in the Munipipal Garden in Manama for letting. 7. Agriculture. No progress coulc be made owing to the difficulty in obtaining trees, plants and seeds from India and Iraq. Prices of lucerne and vegetables continued to bo high. 8. Bkoc trici ty. Continuity of electricity supply was maintained until 15th August despite the average3 peak load during the hot weather months represented the total output of the plant available. The increased demand over the previous year was 21 K.'.V. On 15th August whilst running on a comparatively light load the engine of No, 3 200 KW generating set suffered a major breakdown owing to breakage of the crank shaft. There was no apparent reason for the breakdown and it is thought that it was the result of either an inherent fracture or fatigue. The consequent loss of 200 EW was partially met by the temporary supply of 100 KW from the R.A*F, Station Muharraq which was fed back to Manama at 3,300 volts on the Government High Tension distribution line from Manama to the R.A.F. Station and Muharraq. Owing to the overloading of the R.A.F. Supply which was often in excess of the 100 KW catered for, it was necessary for the R.A.F. temporarily to shut down on several occasions for periods up to four hours. A new 300 KW Mirrlees - Metrovick set which had been on order since February 1946 was received on August 10th at Manama pier and was finally transported to the Power House en August 14th. The construction of the engine foundation bed and platform for water and fuel tanks had previously been completed and erection of the engine commenced on 15th August. This was finally completed on 16th November and the engine was turned by air on 17th November. Owing to the delay in obtaining the generator panel and switchgear the set was run for a period of five hours 25 minutes on the following five consecutive days on 'No Load' and on 6th January 1948 it was first run on 'Load' for a period of five hours. After a 4/-5 /— 4 further period of £2 hours 25 minutes running on four consecutive days it was finally brought into full service on January 11th and is new running daily singly or in parallel with the other tlired generator** The erection of the plant was carried out entirely by mechanics of the State Engineer*s Department without any outside help and was supervised by the State Engl-- A further set of 300 ICY/ rated capacity is due i arrive early in March andpreparations for its installation are now in hand. It is not certain whether this will be available for service during the hot weather this will be available for service during the hot weather months owing to the reported delay in manufacture of the switchgear. An additional ’Sream—Line 1 oil xilter has been installed and is in service. The- oil filtration plant is now capable of dealing with all lubricating oil in use and rendering it fit for further use. The total quantity of oil filtered and returned to serviceable storage during the year was 14,110 gallons representing a cash value saving of Rs.49,385/-. Transport Department . During the year the Government Garage carried out the major repair andservicing of all Government vehicles (62 vehicles). During the year 14 Dodge trucks (ex Army) and 6 of other makes were disposed of. 6 Humber Station Wagons were received from the U.Iv. and 3 Dennis 5 Tonneps and 2 Austin Tipping trucks were purchased locally during the year. Other vehicles on order from U.K. but not yet received, consist of 8 Humber pick-ups, 1 Humber Ambulance and 2 Humber touring cars. During the year the Government of Bahrain imported from the U.K© M.T• spare parts valued at Rs.80,958.Telephone Section , The total number of subscribers at the end of the year was 131 and many additional applications i^r telephones were refused owing to the commencement work on the new Automatic system- 9 .

AL KHAUFAH rir h n»rg slr - fclman tln * * * / H i s Highness the Shaikh's opinions and behaviour are * as his appearance - an effect achieved by constant c.nd heavy / dyeing of his beard. He grows, perhaps, more pompous, acre inclined to interfere in the details of his adminlstretien and more impatient of restraining influences. But his fundamental trust in the British Government, his reliance upon nis /dyiser, his anxiety that Bahrain should remain th€ centre have remained unimpaired during the year, together with his narrowness of vision, his hatred of i^atar, his inability to take a long view and his often fatuous conviction (occasion.* -y for his own purposes merely assumed) that there is a simple answer tc every question. His health remained good, jus intelligence system has teen preised, somewhat ruefully* ly members of his own family.

Material for the new buildings took tro years to arrive from the date of Mr. Stanley Rills was appointed as Officer- in-Charge © P W D liork was started on the installation of the vater Supply in November 1947 and 20£ of the work had been completed by the end of the year. Supply is expected to be part operation by July of this year, and if equipment is for .hcoirlng from England it should be complete by the end of October. Operation however is dependent on the requisite supply of electricity. 8 . ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT Supply remained well in arrear of demand owing to the breakdown* of one generating set in the middle of august, this loss being partially remedied by assistance from the R.n.t 4 . Station; and made up in the winter months so far as actual present consumers are concerned by the installation ot a new ;tt. The P&amp;p 'between supply and demand still potentially persists however, and is bound to be realised again next summer particularly when it is remembered that many consumers will be without air- conditioning and wven sufficient electric lighting, and that the automatic Telephone and the Water Supply schemes may be held up for lack of current. This is all the direct result of the Bahrain Governments failure to take its own electrical Engineers* advice given in 1944 to order then sufficient new generator* to meet the estimated (now well realised) demand. 9. TRANSPORT D; P, Ra^LNI During the year the Government Garage carried out the major repair and servicing of all Government vehicles totalling 62 in all. 6 Humber Station wagons were received from the United Kingdom and 3 Dennis five tonners and 2 Austin Tipping trucks were purchased locally during the year, opare parts for these vehicles were purchased upto the value of Rs. 80,968/- from the United Kingdom. 10. TF.bPPHONr DEPARTMENT The total number of subscribers at the end of the year was 131 end many additional applications for telephones were refused owing to the commencement of work on the new Automatic system. 11. pearling The pearl industry suffered a sever© set back owing to the embargo imposed by the Government of India in July 1947. / As a \As a result of tMs f only half the usual number of boats went to the oyster banks. The Bahrain Government advanced money to a number of peerlinv bo*&gt;t masters to enable then to finance their ventures* Income from this year's dive was estimated at 26 lacs of rupees compared with 40 lacs last year* Mr. Harvey C. V/yant f an American Pe»xl dealer f established in Bombay, visited Bahr In in the mid :le of the year to investigate the possibility of establishing an office and to buy pearls here because of the ban on import of pearls into India* He returned in November and bought pearls. 12 . Customs revenue from all sources amounted to Bs. 36,40,676/-,an increase of Rs. 7,67,166/- over the previous year. The reasons for this increese were the removal of controls in the United Kingdom and the U.3.A., general revival in trade and extended operations by Petroleum Concessions Limited, Qatar. A certain amount of the increase is due to higher prices. The total number of Bahrein boats registered by the Customs Department is 1076 of which 90* are sailing boats. 13. Food supplies were no better than last year and the Stete devoted a considerable amount of time, energy and money towards fche year providing the necessities of life for the genera}, public. During the year Rs. 113 lacs was spent in the purchase of Rice, Tea, Sugar, Wheat and mixed Persian grains. The monthly cereal ration was successfully maintained and the increased rice ration proved very popular* Flour was issued to the villages only, as unlike the towns, they have no facilities for grinding whe^t* The price of sugar rose considerably during the last three months cf the year dun to delays in obtaining quota sugar and the necessity of obtaining such supplies elsewhere in the open market. With a satisfactory harvest in Persia, a steady and continuous supply of livestock, potatoes, onions, fresh and dried fruit were imported into Bahrain. The system of cloth rationing was smoothly run throughout the year. There w^s an equal distribution of cloth to the villages and town areas. De-control of many more commodities was introduced during the year. Articles kept under control were those supplied under a quota system and for which special exchange was granted through the Agency. Black Market trade was less than last year, due to the availability of more goods and resulting competitive spirit among the importers. Prices generally showed no sign of falling. 14.

Proposals r were put forward but nothing concrete was dedided at this mfetinb. In Hay a second meeting was held by the Bahrain Merchant community to consider a proposal to form their own landing company. ' sum of Rs. 7,00,000 was promised to finance it. A third meeting was held on the P9th May at the Agency, ihe Political Arent, is Highness the Ruler of Bahrain, .Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa, uncle of His Highness, Mr. C.D. Belgrave, the Adviser, and representative., of Messrs. Gtay Mackenzie and Co Ltd., were present. At this meeting it soon became' •ppMWRt that the merchants wished not to oompete but to co-operate with Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and the general Impression was that the proposed landing company was un likely to materialize. On the 1st of June a fourth meeting a., held. It was stated that the merchants would withdraw tueir application to the Bahrain Government provided Messrs, uray Mackenzie accepted certain terms regarding delivery and care of cargo which should be discharged at Manama, • ^ ln the existing scale of landing charges, and that the rahrain Government would review the scale of landing charges yosriy. . p.

One case of murder occurred in which an Iraqi stabbed his cousin. is. rcQuoiac (D Trade 1 As previously noted f the is? and had an active year in trade f as delivery of consumer goods became easier f which cannot be said of heavy products like machinery; in many cases exchange difficulties made these unavailable from the United States of America and the United Kingdom was unable to supply them* Trade with continental countries increased.. Exchange and import controls were relaxed in May so far as soft currency countries were concerned but were re-imposed in December. Our lack of consistency in their administration has puzzled the locals. (11) xchan^e a nd currency Exchange rates did not change during the year. Indian funds from bazaar sources were not plentiful because of ban on pearl sales to India. Later when overseas accounts in India became 'non resident* local supplies of Indian funds practically ceased* The foreign exchange allocation given to Bahrain in the early part of the year still exists in limited amounts for currencies other than dollars. The dollar quota was soon used up and applications were only accepted for special essential goods which were recommended through the Agency to the exchange control authorities. There was a surplus of money during the year in various parts of the Gulf, ^he amounts were so large that the banks suspended accepting/.until arrangements were made to ship the surplus the India. Towards the end of the year an influx of hundred-rupee notes took place. (Ill) Other than the oil and pearling inudstries there are none of importance in Bahrain. 19. (i) General The health of the community was good during the year. There were no major epidemics. Anti-malarial measures were carried out by the Bahrain Government and the incidence of malaria has been reduced substantially. Figures show a 7.7 % incidence of all dieseses seen* which| with 1946 9 is the lowest recorded and compares favourably with the ?2 % incidence figure of the years before anti-malaMal / measures9 measures and measures against intestinal diseases were instituted by the Bahrain Ciovernraent. *here were no oases of major infectious diseases in Bahrain during the year, oince 1941 Small-pox, always endemic in Bahrain, has declined steadily from 119 cases in 194,1 to 21 in 1946 and nil in 1947.

CAtLE AND ^IHELFSS LIMIT[T (1) The Increase of traffic experienced in 1946 was maintained throughout the year as shown ty the figures below. The figures exclude traffic in transit for ’Iraq and Iran. Figures for aeronautical traffic have been included and the decline shown in the latter part of the year is due to part of the traffic temporarily being diverted through the International Aeradio Limited, Uuharraq. The Company have been unable to provide full services because of the inadequate power supply efrom the State.

From November Saudi Arabia traffic has been for arded through Saudi Government Station at A1 Khobar. The Kadio Telephone service to Dukhan, Qatar, was changed to Kadio Telegraphy. (ill) Cables The Gulf cablfs were Interrupted for long periodst Including total Interruptions. The only cable restored was the Bushire - Muscat cable by H.M.S. ,T Bull-flnch n . Communications were, however, maintained by alternative wireless channels to Aden and London direct. In November a temporary wireless circuit was operated with the Karachi radio to assist the Pakistan Government. It was discontinued when the Muscat - Karachi cable was restored after a period of two years. It Is believed that Its Interruption was due to the earthquake off the Mekran coast. Ov) Technics 1 the Installation of a second 10 K.4. telegraphy/ telephone was completed. Difficulty was experienced In maintaining communication free from Interruption because of the breakdown of the local electricity supply. x here were eight cases of repairs to ship wireless installation during the year.

The Cable Office has been extended to house the R/T terminal,and other building, projects for housing of rA Staff are under construction. (vl) Concession Rights I On the 28th of July Cable and Wireless Limited obtained from the Shaikh a concession to operate telephone cormaunlcrtion and public telephone services In his dominions for a period of 20 years. This really regularised a position as monopolists which this long-established concern has held 23. (1) Towards the beginn ing of the year the •C * 1 11 Class flylng-boet services were withdrawn from the Cairo - Bahrain - Karachi runs. No service replaced them and the only service which passes through Bahrain was the United Kingdom - Singapore service. There was bitter disappointment among the public as It wos practically Impossible to obtain passages on these through services. About this time the B.O.A. C. agreed to operate a 'Plymouth' weekly flying-boat service between UK - Bahrain with a shuttle service to Karachi. Negotiations were completed in about May and the service was introduced shortly afterwards. The Karachi - Bahrein service was found to be unprofitable to the Corporation and was discontinued towards the latter part of the year. The Bahrain - UK service still continues.

They traded on the sale of amulets and charms and persuaded some of the younger members of their following to submit to the Zikr exercises practised by the dcrwishes of North Africa. In these exercises nails and pins are driven into the body of the devotees when they have been worked into a certain stc.te of hysterical insensibility and they appear to feel no pain at the time, but injuries are often inflicted. One devotee was taken to the Government Hospital for treatment. These darwishes were arrested by the Bahrain Government and later on deported from the Island.

In November meetings were held to raise funds to assist Palestine Arabs to retain land which would otherwise be bought up by Jewsf Rs 66,000/- were promised but it is not known how much of this was collected and sent to the right quarter. In the beginlng of December, the three days set apart in the Arab countries for demonstrations against the partition of Palestine were marked by antl-Jewlsh riots resulting in the looting of twelve housee and three shops, the beating up of a few elderly Jews and the death of one Jewess. The instigators were mainly politically young minded/men of Persian origin know to be anti-the Bahrain Government and anxious to create trouble! the actual doers of the damage were riff-raff| though this ofcourse is not to say that Bahraini Arabs to a roan are not anti-Jew on the Palestine question. The local Indian Moslem community seized the opportunity to air its communal grievances in a threatening manner ewefe to such good effect that after a short while practically all the Sikhs in the Island and In Qatar fled home. The Bahrain Government arrested seventy of the antl-Jewlsh rioters and sentenced those convicted to various terms of imprisonment. Up to the end of the year there fas no recrudescence of overt antl-Jewlsh activity. si. mmm The first week of May was marked by most extraordinary weather even for the Persian Gulf.

During the early part of the year Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd. completed a geophysical survey of Sharjah and Res al Khaimah territories. The geophysical party met with constant interference from many tribes inhabiting these vShaikhdoms and the Political Officer and the Residency Agent were continually and actively exercised in promoting settlements between the tribes and their ruling Shaikhs, without which the company could not have proceeded with their work. ?«ost of the interference arose from the Jawasio Shaikhs* parsimony towards fcnd lack of influence over the tribes inhabiting the territories for which they had given oil concessions. A geophysical survey of *»‘bu tfhabi was then begun and continued until the end of March when operations were concluded for the season. The survey party left the Trucial Coast on the 1st April. On the 11th October they returned to Sharjah for the 1947 - 48 cool seasons operations. Geophysical and topographical surveys were started simultaneously in Abu Dhabi territory and that part of luraiml which is under Abu Dhabi. Work in the latter area had been completed by the end of the year. The Company f s local representative did not succeed in obtaining permission from the chiefs of the Nai'm and al-Bushois tribes to do geophysical work in their territories. They put forward such unreasonable demands that his principals decided to drop the matter for the time being. Work during the latter part of the year proceeded without any opposition or interference by recalcitrant tribesmen or common robbers. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi*s security for oil company personnel has been complete; and the party*s main problem has been one of transport. During the year under review Mr. H.M.

Wireless and meteorological services have been maintained, and also catering services on a reduced scale. International Air ^adio took over the wireless installations towards the end of the year. A number of casual operators and through services used E.O.A.C’s facilities; but, for passenger and freight space and for the carriage of malls, local residents have had to rely on the R.A.F. routine services to their station at Sharjah. The following are particulars of aircraft which passed through Sharjah during the year 1947. B.O.A.C. 18 Eastbound &amp; Westbound K.L.V. 61 *’ &amp; M Other 113 ' &amp; tt aircraft (handled by B.O.A.C) Following the ban imposed by the Government of India on the landing of Dutch aircraft in India, K.L.M. aircraft used Bharjah as a staging post on the Batavia-Amsterdam routefrom August to October, 1947• (c) vMp- lng. During the period under report ?4 ships called at Sharjah and 32 ships at Dubai* (d) Jhe_. Golden VaUey Ochre and Oxide Company.. Mining for red oxide on Abu Musa Island was continued until the 9th May when Mr. F. Innes Pocock, of the Golden Valley Ochre &amp; Oxide Company, Limited, returned to the United Kingdom. 1,000 tons of red oxide from Abu Musa and about 70 tons from Sir Abu Na*Air Island were shipped to England by S.S. Beharistan. On the 23rd September Mr. Innes Pocock returned to Abu Musa and recommenced operations on the Island early in October. He was still working there at the end of the year. His operations were hampered towards the end of the year ty the Shaikh of Sharjah’s taxing the labourers working in the mines and attempting to secure the dismissal of those subjects of other Shaikhs from whom he was unable to extort a Urge portion of their earnings. Iran, wh:’ch had only recently been opened in Dubai, was to a large extent on probation to the conimerical community. The greatest call was on their service as exchange dealers and some caution was at first shown by merchants in depositing funds with them. The advantages of having a bank account are now more widely recognised end the use of the cheque as a means of exchange has greatly increased. with India, with their other Persian Gulf branches, and with Basra, where the Trucial Coast wheat quota was purchased. A slight but welcome increase has been perceptible in trade with the United Kingdom and the eew Sterling Area. The bank are fostering this as far as possible - the main difficulties being the relatively small market for British goods (largely owing to the state of depression now prevalent) and the inability of most of the merchants to correspond in English. The bank are endeavouring to develop the merchants* contacts with United Kingdom firms and think they will be able to give useful service in this field. with a bank - such as safe deposit facilities and the issue of travellers cheques - has been very slight. Order-in-Council, 1946, was brought into force on the Trucial Coast. By the Order-in-C*njncll Kis Majesty’s Government assumed Jurisdiction over all persons in the Trucial States other then subjects of the Trucial Shaikhs. Since the Order was brought into force some progress has been made in acquainting foreigners with our Judicial administration end in establishing Joint courts, although not all foreigners who have complaints against subjects of the Shaikhs yet bring their complaints to the Agency in the first instance. Certain of the Shaikhs refer Joint cases to the Agency immediately they .are received; others are being asked to do so. Meanwhile, foreigners whose cases are first decided by the Shaikhs tend to bring them to the Agency if they -get no satisfaction from them. v («) jpgsrAfllJfipfe ‘if, Ixm At the beginning of the year the Imperial Bank of The bank’s principal dealings in exchange were The demand for other facilities normally associated On the 26th April, 1947, the Trucial States / (vi) Officers* Tours*.■■■ - 83 - (vl) Officers' loura. On the 29th January the Kon*ble Lt-Col. Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E,, C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, accompanied by Lady and Miss Hay, and Lt-Col A. • Galloway, C.I.E., O.R.E., Political Agent, Bahrain, arrived at Abu Dhabi by L*V. Hearchus* Ohaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan, Ruler of Abu Dhabi, accompanied by the Political Officer, frucial Coast, and the Residency Agent, went on board and met the 'olitical Resident. The Political Resident and his family returned the call on.the Shaikh at his Fort and took lunch with him. On the 22nd the Political Resident and the Shaikh of ^harjah exchanged calls. The Ruler of Ajman came to the Agency in the afternoon end called on the Political Resident, who proceeded to AJman by car shortly afterwards and returned the Shaikh's call. On the 23rd the Political Resident lefj for Dubai by L.V. Neerchus. The Shaikh of Dubai called on the Political Resident on board and the Political Resident returned the call at the Shaikh's palace. In the evening L.V. Rearchus left Dubai and reached Has al Khaimah on the morning of the 24th. The Political Resident exchanged cbIIs with the shaikh of Ras al Khaimah and had lunch with him. On the 26th he continued his Journey by road to Umm al Qaiwain, arriving there at noon. After lunching with the Shaikh, the Political Resident and his party returned to Sharjah and left for Bahrein on the Nearchus the same day. Throughout the tour Lt-Col. A.C. Galloway took the opportunity to discuss outstanding cases with the Political Officer and had a number of conferences with the Shaikhs concerned. On the 16th April Mr. C.J. Pelly, O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain, arrived at Sharjah. He visited ‘'ubai in the morning of the ICth and in the afternoon called on the Shaikhs of Ajman and Umm al Qalwaln. On the 17th he visited Has al Khaimah. On the l£th he called on Shaikh Sai'd bin Maktum, O.B.E., Ruler of Dubai, on his launch which was anchored in the Fas al Khaimah creek. Re left Res al Khaimah in the afternoon of the 18th, sheltered from a storm in Umro al Qaiwain creek and reached Dubai on the 20th. He left for Bahrain on the 21st. On the 6th and 7th November Dr. M.A. Steele, M.B.E., Residency Surgeon, Bahrain, visited Sharjah and Dubai in connec tion with a suspected outbreak of cholera. On the 15th December R.M.S. 'tfREN' with the Political Resident on board arrived at Abu Musa Island and left after an hour and a half. The Political Resident was unable to get a»hore or to meet the British residents there (vii) Medical . During the year under review Malaria was the chief disease on the Truclal Coast and accounted for one fifth of the new cases treated by the Medical Officer. The following were the most common diseases on the Trucial Coasti- Fye diseases Venereal diseases Teeth and gum diseases Digestive System diseases Ulcerative and inflammatory diseases. In November a suspected case of cholera was reported in Dubai. Every possible precautionary measure was taken, including inoculation of the public both in Dubai and Sharjah. About one fourth of the population of both towns was / inoculated •'•••£4 inoculated* No further case occurred and it is presumed that the suspected case was not, In fact, cholera* The quarantine restrictions caused very considerable dislocation and adversely affected trade for some weeks afterwards* (vill) Postal Services . During the year a Sub-Post Office was opened in Sharjah for two days a week as an experiment* The amount of postal business transacted did not justify its continuation* Air mail services were interrupted when B.O.A.C^s 'C” Class flying boats ceased to call at Dubai. Arrangements were 1? ter made to fly mails to Bahrein in R.A.F. aircraft. On the 29th October Mr* »• Appleby of the British General Post Office accompanied by Khan fahib Abdul Hamid, Superintendent, Civil Knglneerlng, Post Office, Hyderabad, visited Dubai to study the problems involved In the transfer of the Dubai Post Office from the Government of Pakistan to H.il.G. (ix) PuVal - /,bu ^habl dispute. The armed conflict between Abu Dhabi and Dubai which arose last year over the ownership of Khor Gh&amp;nadha was being actively prosecuted by Abu Dhabi at the beginning of the year. Shaikh Jumah bin 'tektum, brother of the Ruler of Dubai, who had been one of the main obstacles to a settlement last year was ordered by the Political Rerident to reside in lahrain until further notice, and economic sanctions were enforced against Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan bin Zaid of Abu Dhabi. these measures resulted in the settlement of the dispute on the 6 th March. The cessation of hostilities was agreed with Jubilation by subjectf of both Shaikhs* On the 8 th May Shaikh Shakhbut came to Sharjah and met -haikh Sai*d bin Maktum, O.B*?., Ruler of Dubai, at the Agency. Unfortunately the settlement proved to be only temporary, for shortly afterwards Shaikh Shekhhut failed to fulfil his undertaking to bring his allies into the settlement 5 and, although he was repeatedly called upon by the Political Agent to act in accordance with the pe^ce treaty which he had signed, he declared that he was unable to do so and alleged that he exercised no control over his former allies. The chief of these, the Manasir, then restarted their deprecations against Dubai, rconomic sanctions wee were re-imposc’d against Abu Dhabi and continued up to the end of the year. After forbearing to retaliate for the first raid, in November the Shaikh of Dubai sent a pursuit party after a large force of Manasir that raided his territory a second time. x hey overtook the raiders at Scat, north of Liwa, and inflicted very heavy casualties on theip. Indeed, the casualties of £€ killed and £0 wornded on the Manasir side - including the leader of the Manasir force wounded - and f fetal casualties among the Dubai force are said to be the heaviest suffered in a tribal fight on the Trucial Coast within living memory 5 and many think that the power of those sections of the Manasir that are allied to Abu Dhobi has teen seriously curtailed if not broken for some time to come. (x) Jawasl m. The Jawasim Shaikhs of *-harJah and Ras al Khaimah together with ther cousin Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad, Regent of Kelba, prove, as we gain experience cf ^hem, more and more conclxisively their impotence and incapacity to rule* Neither the Shaikh of Sharjah nor the Shaikh of Pas al Khaimah w$s able to facilitate the work of the oil company in his Sheikhdom without the intervention of the Political Officer, while the Shaikhs of Hira and of the Beni Qitet openly defied Sharjah and were only brought to terms by the payment of allowances of Rs.6,000/- and Rs. 30,000/- a year respectively. The Shaikh of Has al Khaimah has been at loggerheads with his hephews, and the dispute was not settled until he satisfied them financially. / The ....T ' ■■ • - £he affairs In Kalba under the regency of ^halkh Khalld and the de facto control of his nephew Kumaid bln AMuJlah hafe gone fron bad to worse. The admlnistretlon of justice and the maintenance of security have been entirely neglected» such power as Humaid commands has been devoted to the extortion or excessive taxes and forced loans from the subjects of the otnte. In fact, none of the Jawasim Shaikhs has used what roree or influence he commends to oppose the strong in protection o. oie weak* They prefer to befriend law-breakers of whom tiiey are frightened and to use such power they have to extort money and goods from the poor and humble of their subjects, who need their protection and sucour. Indeed, their subjects go in ar much fear of depredations by their Shaikhs as by roboers* This practise has not been without effect. Persian merchfints hitherto established in Sharjah and has al Kh&amp;laah are moving awfiv to Dubai, end villages on the extremities of their domain®, are turning tc the bhaikh of Fujairah for protection. ^They £re now paying their taxes to him because they have found that he gives then sone return for ther in security. In ^ubai, too, the emphasis has been on the Ruler's duty towards his subjects rather than on his claims to their property. Security there and in Abu Dhabi has been almost complete and both a ™ 0 * )e ¥ e&lt;1 and greatly respected by their subjects. The Shaikh of Dubai and also the Shaikh of F'ujfilrah ( who is most active and wnose Influence is steadily increasing) have themselves und*rtaken the punishment of robbers who loot their subjects w^tnin Jawaslm limits because they know that they can get no satis a action from the Jawasio Shaikhs. The same is true of Ajman and Umm al vaiv.alni and Ajman has recently assumed, at the request of the inhabitants, jurisdiction over Masfut, formerly under ^halrfh Seqr tin ouitan of the Nai'm, because the latt er was una&gt;le to protect the Inhabitants from the Beni Ka'a-o. (xi) iJL-xm* During the year uncer review there have been some c&amp;ses of abduction of persons into slavery from Shr.rjah, Dubai and other parts of the Trucial Coast and the Eatinah. persons abducted were taken to Hamasah, Buraimi, by land one s°ld to Saudi end Qatar slave dealers, who t&amp;ok most of them to Saudi Arabia on camels. Strong representrtions have Veen made to the Shaikhs of Dubai and Sherjah, end the Shaikh of ^ubai has expelled from Dubai one Khalifah bin kajid, a notorious slave- dealer, and has recovered three persons who were abducted from Dubai, lost of the bedouin involved in the abduction from Shariah were of the Beni Qitab, against whom the Shaikh of Sharjah dare not take any action. The Residency Agent visited Buralmi during the year, made enquiries in Enmasah about the slave trrde, and did all he could to supress it. He also arranged for thr-ee abducted women to be retained in ;.anasah until they could be recovered through the Shaikhs of Dubai and Sherjah, from whose territories they had been abducted. (xii) Pta&amp;sy* There has been no complaint against any of the subjects of the Trucial Sh&amp;ikhdons of their having engaged in piracy during the year. (xiii) : conomlc» Trade has been depresbec throughout the yeor. Exports to Persia have considerably decreased $ and many merchants who held large amounts in Persian currency hr^ve -.ost nearly half their capital - the e; change rate between the toman and the rupee having fallen from par to Rs. CO/- to IOC/-, •^he depression has been accentuated by the ban on the import of pearls into India and by the curtailment of expenditure by H.tt.G's defence services. I This .. • •- mmaam - 26 - This curtailment has not yet been made good by the activities of the oil company. There is much unemployment and many sut Jects of the Trucial Shaikhs have gone to . ; at?r, Saudi arable f Bahrain end Kuwait In search of work. &lt;±lv) :c-minunl?r.tlons. The rotor track between Dubel and Muscat th: ough the Wadi el Qaur has been much more frequently used since local taxi owners were able to buy surplus military vehicles from the R.A.F. Security on the road between Dubai and the eastern end of Wadi el Qaur* most of which lies in JaAaslm territory, has v been bad. A number of armed robberies have taken place. .
