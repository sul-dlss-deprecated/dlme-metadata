Several thousand NORTON motor cycles have been supplied to the British Government for military use. Thousands of machines have been supplied to the India Office for use in India, where the machine is, of course, used under entirely different conditions from normal, not only is there tropical heat, but in other circumstances intense cold. The machines have to traverse for thousands of miles during the year in regular patrol work dried-up river beds; in the rainy season they have to go through mud - in certain sections axle deep. Petrol and oil consumption are important items because of the sparsely populated areas and inability to obtain supplies. Furthermore, in certain districts by reason of the tribal differences it is absolutely essential that the machine is reliable, otherwise a man might lose his life. In addition, the Turkish Government have NORTON machines in use for Military purposes and a number have also been supplied to the Egyptian Government for use of the Ministry of War &amp; Marine, Camel Corps &amp; Car Patrols. H.E.H. The Nizam’s Regular Forces at Hyderabad are also equipped with NORTON motor cycles and the Royal Automobile Club have^standardised NORTON sidecar outfits for the whole of their Road Patrols and are eminently satisfied with the results they have obtained.Birmingham Continuation To State Engineer, Date Bahrain G-ovt. Electric Supply Dept. 5 th December 1939 A large batch of machines and sidecars have been supplied for use in the Dutch East Indies by the Army Authorities* tne General Post Office of Australia have a fleet of NORTON machines in use for delivery of telegrams, and the New Zealard , Canadian and Australian Defence Forces are equipped with NORTON motor cycles, as also the Defence Forces of Malaya. The British Air I .inistry have a large number in use, as also a number of Police Authorities in this country. The machine is exceptionally sturdy in construction and is built to withstand arduous work with a minimum of attention. The design is simple and straight-forward, every detail is accessible, the machine has a very high factor of safety and is extremely economical to rim, both from the point of view of oil and petrol consumption and general maintenance. It has never been part of the Company's policy to manufacture machines on mass production lines, each machine is an individual unit, is subjected to inspection during various processes of manufacture and every individual machine is road tested before being put into service. &gt;7e shall be happy to give you any further information you may require and hope to be favoured with your esteemed order in due course, which would receive our very careful attention.

Sir I have the honour to refer to the correspondence resting with the Indian Stores Department letter No. 7604- ES dated the 28th March 1940, and to enclose herewith a statement of quotations for Norton motor cycles received from Messrs. Norton Motors Limited, Birmingham. These prices are compared with those charged by Messrs. Noble Cycle &amp; Motor Co., Bombay, and Messrs.

The prices charged by these two firms are clearly exorbitant as even after deducting the Customs draw-back refunded to them, they have on an average charged almost double the prices quoted by Messrs. Norton Motors Ltd. It is of course realised that the cost price of motor cycles in India includes freight, packing and insurance charges, etc., paid by the firms when importing them into India /-2 India but this does not account for so great a difference and I should be grateful for an explanation# 3* I had always understood that one of the advantages of placing orders through the Indian Stores Department was that goods would be supplied at the cheapest possible rate* In this case it appears that had the order been placed direct with the makers of Norton Motor Cycles and not through the IndianStores Department an enormous saving would have resulted. 4* Would you also please inform me of the rate of duty on motor cycles imported into India from the United Kingdom ?

Order No.N-848/1 dated the 20th October 193$ Sir &gt; ) SL J* s • .a With reference to your letter No.^75-6/71dKed the 2nd May 1940 and this office letter No. 11-^48/1 dated the 11th July 1940, it is regreted that a reply was not sent earlier explaining as to why high prices were paid to Messrs. Noble Cycle &amp; Motor Co. The motor cycles were required by you urgently and enqui ries were made by telegrams from likely suppliers. As it was considered advisable to keep to one make of motor cycles and as these motor cycles were available from only tie above firm and Messrs. Mody &amp; Co., purchase was arranged at the prices quoted. The motor cycles supplied by Messrs. NobleCycle&lt;&amp;: Motor Co. included Lucas Magdyno Electric Lighting Set whereas the Motor cycle supplied by Messrs. M r ody &amp; Co. did not include this lighting set. On comparing the prices it has been found that approximately Rs.300/- higher was paid to Messrs. Noble*Cycle &amp; Motor Co. than what was paid to Messrs. Mody &amp; Co. The matter has been taken up very strongly with the firm, but they are not prepared to reduce their price. On comparing the landed costs of motor cycles, it has been found t at Messrs. Mody &amp; Co. have made a profit of about 3s 4.5%, at which profit the other firm is not prepared to transact business. In view of the special circumstances of the case, no further action can be taken but instructions are being issued to scrutinize closely the prices which Messrs. Noble Cycle &amp; Motor Co. may quote to this Department in future. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Officer on Special Duty (V) for Chief Controller of StoresSection.)
