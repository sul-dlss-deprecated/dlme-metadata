                           auqāf(or
                           awqāf, plural of
                           waqf) on behalf of the Harameyn (the two sanctuaries of Mecca and Medina, also transliterated as Haramayn, Haramein and Haramain in the file) and their people.Much of the correspondence concerns enquiries made by the Hejazi (later Saudi Arabian) Government about information regarding the estates of deceased persons in British-ruled territories (including British India, Burma, and Palestine), parts of which estates are claimed to have been designated as Harameyn
                           auqāf.The file features the following principal correspondents: the British Agent and Consul, Jeddah (Acting Agent: Herbert George Jakins); His Majesty's Chargé d’Affaires to Jeddah (Cecil Gervase Hope Gill, succeeded by Albert Spencer Calvert); His Majesty's Minister at Jeddah (Sir Andrew Ryan); the High Commissioner, Palestine (Arthur Grenfell Wauchope); the Governor of Burma (Charles Alexander Innes); the Hejaz/Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs; officials of the India Office, the Foreign Office, the Government of Bombay, the Government of Burma, and the Government of India's Foreign and Political Department.A large part of the correspondence is concerned with the details of a
                           waqfcreated under the will of a deceased British Indian resident of Java named Ali bin Hussein Nanabhai as-Surati (there are various transliterations of his name in the correspondence), who left property in Rangoon, Burma. Whilst His Majesty's Minister at Jeddah and other British correspondents make efforts to assist in providing the Hejazi/Saudi Government with information regarding Nanabhai's estate, they also state that the British Government cannot intervene in the management of any
                           auqāfcreated in British territories.Also discussed are plans for an unofficial Saudi mission (proposed in 1935 by a recently formed Mecca-based society for the protection of Harameyn
                           auqāf) to Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Iraq and India, to promote the claims of the Hejaz's Holy Places to the revenues of Harameyn
                           auqāf.Most of the material in the file dates from 1932 to 1935, with the exception of a few earlier items, which date from 1927.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Governor of Burma</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Missions</topic></subject><subject><topic>Religious organizations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Wills</topic></subject><subject><topic>Religious life</topic></subject><subject><topic>Auqāf</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Jeddah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Agent and Consul General, Jeddah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Palestine and Transjordan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Bombay</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Saudi Arabia, Minister for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000279#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000279#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000279#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
