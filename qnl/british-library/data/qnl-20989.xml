Memor andum * ?rom the fii 93 of this off/ice I 39 e that, it is on record that it was the intention of H.M.Govt. before the war to more definitely dispose of the pretentions of the Persian Sovt. to rights over the Islands of Bahrain. In this connection I would point out that the practice is continued by the Persian Passport authorities, of issuing passports for Bahrain as for an inland port of -’ersia and the passport holder has to lodge a deposit .This deposit is not refundable before he sends his -Pass- back, with an endorsement to shew that he has duly arrived in Bahrain.Borne years ago such passes were endorsed by one H *ii Abdur but he was warned to cease doing so,&amp; orders were ultimately passed by H.M.G. for his removal from Bahrain. I t 13 not known why these orders were not carried out at the time The individual,although he no longer endorses passports, continues to cause every troublr he can and has had to be severely cautioned by nearly every Political Agent who has been here. The position as regards these pa-ses now is that they are endorsed by the Political Agent to the effect that t-e holder arrived in Bahrain.lt would seem that we are in ao doing placmg ourselves in a somewhat invidious position, and acting as part of the Persian Passport systems endorse passes,plainly marked &gt;Prom one itt*aiis®*tinternal sort to another' and charge no fee whatsoever.There is a very consider! ’able amount of clerical labour Involved.since the number of sc such Teakereh passes issued is great.(&gt; ) Althoagh we are responsible in Bahrain for Persians.who while here are under British protection,yet we have no control whatsoever over Persians entering Bahrain.As a result it has become a happy hunting ground for undesirables who find a temporary absence frtfc.*: Persia desirable for their own interests. Such persona are the cause of a good deal of pe4ty crime and can be used at all times by unscrupul' ous persona for crime and intrigue. It would seem desirable that inasmuch as Persians while in Bahrain are under British protection, that they should be required to take out a passport to come to Bahrain,in the same way that British Indian subjects and others take out passports.An Identity certificate would probabjry suffice, and could be issued by H.M$s consuls in Persia,who could collect the usual fees,which would seem a Justified source of Revenue to H.M. Government. Such a procedure would place beyond douhbt the position of Great Britain in Bahrain vis-a- vis Persia. At present the Persian Government issuespasses and takesRevenue thereon permitting their subjects to visit Bahrain,where we are responsible for them,without our concurrence and moreover we serve them by endorsing such passes without fee f thereby allowing a procedure to become customary which might in the future give Persia an excuse for claiming a special position in regard to Bahrain.

A person who v.is summoned oving to a suit haying been filed against him, is not permitted to tafca an Identity certificate,unlsss ha appoints a ’waill' to appear in his case,or some suitble guarantee that he ulll return in &gt; reason able time which is accepted by the other party. For this reason, and to enable some check to be kept on the movement of undesirables the system is useful^ I am inclined to think thet the Karguzars representation is more likely the result of agitation of the party mentioned in ray Ho. 73/ c * ' fch8tl an ^ 5,01110:1 of the Persian Sovemment/fthn system has been in force now for several years end with the exception of a few months oerly last year regularly carried out. I am however inclined to think that in order to save inuonvenience.and office work,we sight issue yearly Identity oertlfioatas entitling the holder to enter and leave Bahrain during the period without further necessity for ssis.r.'.i’xxx endorsement,a's far as Persian ports are concerned. A register of such certificates would ho maintained and it would be always possible to instruct the police to stop tha holder of a certain number should he be evading the law. This should removepossible oomplaint on the sooro of inconvenience,while at the same time retaining certain advantages of th* pas port system•Persons who are in the habit of visiting Bahrain frequently for short periods, could avilithemselves of this . If you approve of such a system, I should be glad to know what charge should be made.I would suggest that HsP/S v&gt;ould be a reasonable fee for a yearly passport. As you will se&gt; from the statistics with the report on the Bahrain order in Council, v he number of suits filed has greatly increased. Persons wore so much in thn habit of running off to Porsi'-n Ports to rvold their debts or rarke away after thefts,th£t when I first ca.me h f &gt;T* 8 1 T 9 were pestered every mail day,by urgent petitions to stop dafend-mts from getting awny.

Issue of Certificates of Identity and Ilm Khaber for Bahrein. Reference the correspondence ending with your mernor-indum N0.76/C, of 19th April 1922, I am informing the Karguzar hers verbally, that no new rules with regard to the issue of Certificates of Identity and lira Khaber have lately been introduced into Bahrei^ but the reason for his receiving complaints nov/ is probably due to the more strict enforcement of the rules in force. This ia^owing^partly to uhe recent institution of regular police by the Municipality which has resulted in a more careful examination of passengers and scrutiny of passports, than was carried out formerly by the Shaikh’s Fidawis, and partly that the Political Agent, Bahrein, finding that a lot of people were evading hhe rules in force simply to escape their debts in the Courts, had ordered a more strict enforcement of the rules. The Political Resident considers that any persons who are domiciled in Persia and who have to go over to Bahrein on business occasionally need only have the lira Khaber counter signed as formerly when they are about to return. With regai d to your prpposal in the last part of your memorandum, the Political Resident considers that a yearly certificate is a good suggestion and worth trying and he thinks a fee of Rs.2/8/- would probably be sufficient.

I am informed hy H.M f s Consul, Bandar Abbas that the Persian Passport authorities at iingah and Bandar Abba^ are insisting that gahrainis are Persian subjects and refusing to allow them to leave without talcing out Persian Passports. I am representing matter to Tehran but in the meanwhile have instructed H.r f s Consul to tell Bahrainis that they should take out the passports under protest. The claim of the Customs (in its capacity of Passport Department) is at strange variance with its request for our assistance in preventing smuggling from Bahrain to Persia, and in view of it we certainly need not bother to do so any longer. I would suggest that, if possible Bahrainis should be advised to avoid going to Lingah and B an dar Abbas and if they have business in Persia go by dhow to #ne of the smaller ports. gieut-Jol Political^Resident in the Persian Gulf.No. ^7- S of 1922.

I have instructed Consul to inform Bahrainis that if local authorities insist they had better take out passports under protest. This attitude of Ministry of Foreign Affairs is curiously at variance with that of Customs Department which considers Bahrain foreign port, charges duty etc and pro secutes persons caught smuggling. Last year Customs asked £&lt; for and obtained my cooperation in trying to prevent smuggling from Bahrain and Director told me it was of con siderable assistance to them. Arrangement has of course been dropped now as the Persians cannot have it both ways. Seeing that Persians were finally driven out of Bahrain in 1783, and in view of their absolute in capacity to reoccupy islands new, their present attitude seems rather childish.

A. far a. i. known no action however has been taken on this memorial. ith regard to the actual eases mentioned in these articles, I would observe that three of these are mentioned in nearly all the articles about Bahrain and are three in which Haji Abdul Habl ha. specially interested himself. ihe c: ee of uli aastaki referred to in the first extractextract has already 'been reported; It Is true that the man died hut of pneumonia some days after he left the Agency look up during which he had worked as usual as a coolie. Kerbalal Asad was accused of •Dishonest misapproprlatlon of property possessed by deceased person at the tine of his death 9 . He pleaded not guilt/ but admitted har'ng Iftfc* dienosed of the whole of the property of deceased, though he was un- fynv an. r able to produce any will appointing ^/executor or/ordrr HrTl\ any Court; and nothing to gfcow what he had done with the property. He was found guilty by the Shara Court, and ssntene^d to 5 months imprisonment* vr ulk B&amp;ranl Kaxeruni was accused of •forgery* and pleaded guilty• He wae sentenced to a fine of 30/- and wae released after hawing been detained in prison for 3jr days in all. ^is forgery was a Tory palpable and senseless on© and he probably got off so lightly in this account. The case of sheikh Hafiz Mlsri Is well known to the ®©nt of India and has formed subject of correspondence; he is an Itjgyptian Journalist of extreme wlews ’•ho was knocking about the Gulf and was not allowed to land a second time at Bahrain at the request of th* sheikh. Jasim Cherawi was one of the Secretaries of the Sheikh who was -ilw&amp;ys interferring and on one oco&amp;slon hawing gone too far he was made, with the approwal of the Sheikh to glwe an undertaking to behawe and refrain from intrigue or be liable to deportation. Hawing broken this he was denorted. This case was also reported to the 3cwemm©nt of India. It is a curious thing that Haji Abdul wabi continues to reside and carry on business in Bahrain, as he apparently fi'K?s the conditions of life so trying there. I beg to suggest that he wight be repatriated to his rwn country, in 1910 His Majesty 9 s ‘inister, Tehran informed ♦Ms office (in his telegram No. 163 dated 17th July 19io) that Mis Majesty 9 a Gowemment had agreed to the deportation of naji Abdul Habl for carrying on exactly the same intrigu-e as he0 he is doing now* it is unfortunate th^Vhe w*b siven time to wind up his affairs before being deported and in the end was not sent away* During the war he l*v very low, as he doubtless knew that if he had i?;iYen trouble then, he would hare been deported or otherwise punished at once* since the htf*- vmrn ratification of the Anglo-Persian Agreement and the sub sequent wave of anti-British feeling in Persia, he has re sumed his Intrigues with renewed energy* Until recently he confined himself to cslun^ryating the Agency, but recently he has started attacking the Sheikhs and his family, who ire much annoyed* If the Sheikh presses for the deportation of rfaji Abdul Uabi, i beg to enquire whether I can authorize the Political Agent to carrj it out *at the request of the Ruler or, as Haji Abdul Habi is a foreigner unler British protection, to inform the shaikh that on account of his misbehaviour our protection is withdrawn from Eaji Abdul Habi tmd allow# him to deport the man himself* Of the above two courses I should prefer the first, as the latter might be mls- interrreted e a relaxation of our orotection of foreigners* It is of course possible that Haji Abdul Habi would continue hie agitation in ^ s r 8 i a# this oase he would not be in such a good position to carry it on as he is now.

The political Agent expressed the view that this is perfectly feasible, and recommends that the procedure should be adopted. As far as I can see It would be perfectly easy to adopt It for all arrivals by steamer, but to enforce the procedure on Persians arriving from the Dashtl and Shlbkuh ports would inflict a certain amount of hardship because It would entail « longlsh ijourney either to BUahlre or Ling ah to obtain a pass or visa. This would not matter of Itself wsry much as the Persian authorities do not show much ocr.ilderation to Bahrain subjects, were it not that it might result In deterring these boatmen from coming to Bahrain. When X was at Bahrain (and I fancy it 1 s still the case) nearly all the fresh meat In Bahrain and a large proportion of the fresh fruit and vegetables used to come by dhow from the smaller Persian Ports; if this traffic were to be reduced by the new passport rules, it would cause considerable inconvenience In Bahrain. This could perhaps he obviated If the boatowners obtained Persian Passports and secured a visa lasttag for (say) one year, and the prospect of a chance of smuggling goods back from Bahrain to the Persian Coast would doubtless offer strong inducement to the boatmen to continue their trips to Bahrein. 4. in the circumstances I beg to recommend that the system of British passports and visa, suggested by the Minister may be given a trial, and to request that if the Government of India concur, they win he pleased to authorise its Introduc tion« T have the honour to be.

Please refer to your telegram No.53-C dated the 22nd April 1923, which appears to me to connote some fundamental misunderstandings that I am anxious to remove, as their removal will be of service to you in guiding your general policy. As you are aware, if in no other way from recent telegraphic correspondence, Persia is claiming sovereignty over Bahrain and they are resolved to raise this question in an acute form and we may be unable to prevent it and our position may be questioned - say, before the League of Nations. You say, Moreover he could not threaten punishment, as he has no jurisdiction over Persians here”. Now what are the facts? It is obvious that, if we claim the SheiVh of Bahrain to possess sovereignty, even though we may have established a protectorate, someone must have the right to deport or imprison persons intriguing against the sovereign power in favour of an alien unjustifiable claim. His Majesty’s Government have laid down that we have not the power, unless expressly ceded to us by the Sheikh of Bahrain. And that brings us to the whole crux of the question. How did our jurisdiction over foreigners - a delicate power to defend before an assembly of indifferent or hostile rowers- arise? There is only one position we can defend and that is the delegation by the Sheikh, an independent sovereign,- for reas/ons that do not here concern us- of jurisdiction. It is true that it lands us in the difficulty that he who has delegated can withdraw the powers granted, but that inconvenience cannot be overcome and must be faced. It follows from the above that the Sheikh still retains the power to threaten11 and punish foreigners especially with our approval, ^hat our position in the Gulf, and a fortiori in Bahrain,enables ud to remonstrate authoritatively with the Shaibh against the nisuse or arbitrary and unjust exercise of his cowers over foreigners does not alter the nature of sovereignty or destroy its powers. Sheikh of Bahrain in the present crisis will be worth ten of ours. Whether you can, by flattery or other means, manage to put a little backbone into the Sheikh and get him to assert himself, is a matter of practical politics, which you are in a better position to decide ± than I, a newcomer, can possibly be, but there is no doubt that it would be a feather in your cap if you could. far you can let the Pheikh know all the above truths, but there is no doubt that you must keep them at the back of your brain for use when reauired, and not tell me or His Majesty’s Government that the Sheikh of Bahrain has no jurisdiction over Persians in his territory. It is true only to a very limited extent. Perhaps you would now like to rewrite your telegram and reconsider how far you can help. P. 8 .

I r minded him that Persian authority had not been exercised in Bahrain since the latter half of the IBth Century; that the Persians were then evicted from the Island by certain Ar^o tribes and had made no attempt for well over one hundred years to recover it. Hig Majesty's Government had nothing to do with that eviction, but they had since made treaties with the Sheikh of Bahrain, v/ith the result that the Island 'was now a British Protectorate. I a^ded V that His majesty's Government did not contemplate any alteration of its status.

The letter enclosed with above has been identified here as emanating from Yawar (Major) Ali Asghar, Commanding at Bushire. This gentleman is generally supposed to be the bluff soldier type averse from intrigue and was reported by the Residency staff to be somewhat embarrassed by the honours given to him at Bahrain. I am inclined to think he is not an- intriguer, and that this letter was probably got out of him by Shah Ismail. If the matter can be brought home to Muhammad Sharif I agree that he ought to have a severe reprimand. I authorize you to give him the following message which I have had translated into Persian and attached for conven- -ience from me: 'From certain facts which have come to my know- '-ledge it is evident that Khan Bahadur Muhammad Sharif 'has been intriguing with Persian officials in Bushire 'in support of the pretensions of Persia to Bahrain and 'theref one directed both against the British Government 'under whose protection in Bahrain he and other Per- '-sians are, and against the sovereign rights of the 'Rulers of Bahrain from whom he lias received nothing but2 'has been allowefl to reside and amass a fortune. It 'is therefore necessary to inform him that if there is 'the slightest cause of complaint of his behaviour in 'future the British authorities will have no hesitation 'in removing him from Bahrain, with the government of 'which he appears to be so dissatisfied, and in support “-ing the Ruler in confiscating his property. In 'such an eventuality it goes without saying that the 'title of Khan Bahadur conferred on Muhammad Sharif 'would Tje forfeited.' If it becomes necessary to give Muhammad Sharif this message I think it should be read to him an&lt;i h ® ° 0Uld if nece£S a-ry see it to convince himself that it emanates from me, but it is not necessary to.

In my telegram Ho. 120 , dated the 26th Hovember 1926, on the subject/ of passports or travelling passes for Bahrain subjects, I promised a further report by despatch. Ae you warned me subsequently in your telegram Ho. 52, dated the 16th be allowed to slumber, I am now simply attaching a Note on the history of the Persian Travelling Pass, called Ilm»£-^abft£, together with the following observations below. The use of Ilm-o ^Ktiaba r passes seems first to have come to the notice of this Residency in June 1910 when the Residency Agent at Xingah reported that the Ha^jiuda and crew of an Arab (Oman) boat had been compilled to take out such passes. At this time tiie administration of the service had been newly taken over by the Belgians of the Customs Department. In April 1910 Sir Percy Cod telegraphed to His Majesty’s Legation enquiring whether any new passport regulations had come into force, and whether they had been concurred in by His Majesty 1 * Government. The reply received on 1st August 1910 (Tehran telegram Ho. 173) was that the Persian Government stated that no change had been made in the 'assport Regulations. Instructions L. Loraine, Bart., K.C.K.G., .M’s. Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the March 1926, that His Majesty’s Scoretarjr of State for Foreign Affairs wished the question of principle regarding Bahrain to Court of Persia, Tefegeji.- 2 - (3 Instructions has recently been prepared (? printed), but they did not modify the regulations in any way* On the 10th June 1922 Colonel Trevor, in his telegram Ho. 177, reported to Tehran that the Karguzars at Lingah and Bandar Abbas were pressing Bahrain subjects, leaving Persia, to take out Ilm-o-Khabar passes. This action, he pointed out, was inconsistent with the Customs Department’s attitude, under which Bahrain was treated as a foreign port, duty being levied and smugglers therefrom being punished. In neither of these years was any formal protest made to the Karguzar at Bus hire. With regard to the recent correspondence between yourself and His Majesty’s Foreign Office, my Note will show that Bahrain subjects have never been granted regular British Passports of any category by the Political Agent, Bahrain. Those Bahrainis in Mohammerah who hold British passports are doubtless men who have resided in India and become naturalized British subjects there. Others have Certificates/of Identity issued to the* in Bahrain or in Iraq, who on the strength of such documents have got themselves registered as British Protected persons in the Mohammerah Vice-Consulate. The third category calling themdelves 'dependents of Shaikh Isa bin Ali' must be persons who have been long resident in jbt&amp;±jc ^ersia and were recognized by the late Mr. McDouall as natives of Bahrain. I do not think t a&gt; is Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Mohammerah has ever issued a British Passport (as distinct from a Certificate of Identity) to a native of Bahrain. If he or the Administrative Inspector at Bufexx Basrah have ever done so, I consider that their action was wrong. Personally, in spite of the strange surrender of principle displayed by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs in regard to Famadi, son of Haji Abood (as related in your Despatch Ho. 252, da.ed the 9th May 192b, to the address of the Foreign Office), the reason for which I cannot fathom, I would have hesitated to ask you, as my locum tenens did in his Despatch Ho. 60/243-S., dated the 16th July 1925, to submit to the Persianto be regarded in effect as British subjects I believe that you did not literally comply with this request t but I fear as represented in 2 ny telegram of 26th November 192b that our position may have become somewhat impaired, as you have now tajcen notice of the practice of issuing Ilm-o-iCftabar passes for Bahrain, which hitherto has not formed the subject of official discussion. I do not suppose that anything more can be done in the matter now. Uhen opportunity occurs I think that the desideratum for which we should strive is/to have reciprocal \ agreements arranged between I’ersia on the one side and the Arab States on the other, introducing special passport and visa rates for poor traders (in cereals, live-stock, etc .). porters, divers, boatmen, etc. just as at present the Persian Passport/ Regulations grant concession rates to Pilgrims and fcakarl (camelmen-transporters) on the land frontiers of Persia. With regard to Arab Passports I have been given to understand by the Muscat Government that they regard the Travelling docu ments which they issue to their subjects proceeding to any distance from home as Passports proper. The Shaikh of ituwalt has approv ed a form of passport which he Intends to introduce as soon as possible. Re lias not considered it necessary to consmlt me about the rates to be charged. In am enquiring into tills. In Bahrain, in view of the action taken by you on my tele gram Ko. 124, dated the 16th December 1925, I presume that there is no objection to the Political Agent continuing to issue Cert/ificates of Identity to all applicants. The Persian Government should not, in my opinion, confiscate such documents, aswhiie the question of nationality remains in dispute they should at least recognise that Bahrainis may have dual nationalities. In every journey to places other than Persia the British Certificate of Identity is obvioudiy more ddsired by a Bahraini than a Persian passport. India. 1/ am forwarding a copy of this despatch to the Government of I have, etc.The eyetem of Paasports was introduced into Persia about 1869 A.D. PersiaiiB who wiohed to proceed by steamer from one Persian port to another in the Persian Gulf were required to deposit the ^assport fee at one K &amp;rru z arate end recovered it at the port of dieembarkation or on return home. In 1900 A.D. new Passport Rules were published. A* the same time the money deposit for journeys by sea within the Empire was reduced by a Foreign JUnistry*! Order to ten fcrans . The Receipt fora called Ilm -p- i%habaj r- — a compound word (of. band -o - bast )» which literally means “Knowledge and information M . In 190B a revised set of ^assport Regulations was issued. About the same time the price of Ilm -o- iaulbar, Receipt forms was reduced to one icran . wliich sum was no*- r^ -urnable to the traveller. The latter however was required to get an endorsement of lancing certified on his pass. If he returned home without pi'oducing the completed document he was fined two krans . Similarly Persians anti Arabs who landed at a Persian port from another port in the Persian Gulf without possessing an IIm -o- Khabar certificate a common event, of course — were fined two krana . In 1326 Uijri (1908 A.D.), new Persian 'assport Regulations were printed and published. In 1327 Hijri (1909 A.D.) printed forms of Ilm-o- were taken into use under a Foreign Ministry Order Mo. 779, dated 25th Zilhadjeh, 1327. Up to two years ago t the forms were in Persian only. Mow they are printed in Persian and French. Two specimens are enclosed. They are issued from every small Customs post on the Banian coastcoast. Although these forms are stated to be for use between Persian ports # the supply of them is not apparently restricted to Persian subjects only. In practice, all natives of the Persian Gulf are forced to taice out Ilm -o- ilhabar . if they do not possess foreign passports which cannot be success fully challenged. As the fee is so small it is not considered worth the traveller's while to object to payment, even is he is going to Kuwait, Bahrain, Bibai or Uuec&amp;t. Vhe noteworthy point is that, unless the ti'aveller to Arabia ic actually going to Bahrain, his port of destination is not truly shown. The place entered is given as Ucliammcrah, Lingah or Bandar Abbas ! As the Arab Governments of liui cat, Kuwait, etc .» do not demand the exhibition of passports by travellers visiting their ports, no objection is raised on the Arab side to the issuing Ilm -o -Khabar documents by the Persian Passport Department. It is understood that the Persian alternative might be to insist on the possession of Passports which would be vio^ under a higher fee. During the ITar thousands of Persian coolies were also allowed to travel to Basrah on Ilm -o- Kh&amp;bar certificates which were paid for by the British military Authorities. Occasionally ths Persian Government objected to the practice. % nowadays a large number of Persians enter Iraq as pilgrims, on the special pass which cocts ten Kruns only. A mi.icrity take out ordlnax'y Passports, which cost 23, 34$ or 67 Kraus respectively to different classes of travellers. The latest phase in this question is a recent reference of which I have been secretly but reliably informed, from the Kars:uzar . Bashirs, to the foreign Office, Tehran. The representation made is to the following effect 'Hitherto Passports have never been issued for towns of Trucl&amp;l 'Oman, but they are some times Issued for Unseat. Alien it 'has been considered desirable to issue a Passport, and not an ' Ilm -o -iQmbar . to a person travelling to (a) Kuwait or (b) Dibai (or other Truclal town) ths Passport^* made out for3 - '(a) Basrah and (b) ’Karachi via Dlbal 1 * It is recommended 'that the same procedure should be introduced for travellers Persian Government’s shadowy claim to sovereignty over the whole of Oman, which Nadir Bhah’s troops conquered about 1736 and lost in 1741 should be revived. British Certificates of Identity. Prior to the Great War, the Arab Shaikhs of Bahrain, Plbai, etc .. used to issue Letters of Recommendation (called in Persian Pahdarl ) to their subjects going abroad. These, if brought to a British Political Agent or Residency Agent, were endorsed in English, certifying to the Haider’s nationality and recommending him to the good offices of British officers. In 191B, as a War measure, it was ordered that all travellers from Abab towns to places outside the Persian Gulf — i^.e,. to Iraq, India, etc .. — should furnish themselves with British Certificates of Identity, for which a fee of one Rupee was charged. '’’haveners found these Certificates so helpful that the practice became general of taking them out also for journeys to Persia for instance, in particular, on $1 pilgrimage to Hashed. The practice continues to the present day. The Political Agent, Bahrain, in 1925 issued about X 200 Certificates of Identity to British subjects, 800 to Bahrain subjects, 2000 to Persians and 2000 to other foreigners. The Residency Agent at Gwadur (Muscat State) issues about 2000 Certificates MX a year meetly to Baluchis proceeding to India. Commanders of Btcaners, which sail from India for the Persian Guldf, nowadays insist on all passengers holding travelling Documents in some form or other. The issue of British Certificates of Identity to Persians and Bahrainis landing at South Persian ports is accepted by the Persian Customs and Passport authorities as proof of port of embarkation, but its possession does not exempt the bearer from the fine of two ftrans for failure to hold an Ilm -o rKhubur .

The Persian claim to sovereignty uv^r -a,.rain can Be regarded as in the same neBulous aauegory and receivei no material support from the issue of . Ilm-o- Khabar certificates for travellers to and from Bahrain. (B) if we recognise and temporarily tolerate the Persian contention that 4 Bahraini on Persian soil should oe treated as a Persian national, or if we prefer to regard bim as a person not enjoying capitulation rights, like a muscat ur Iraq subject, and therefore untotitled to hritish protection, it hardly seems 1 ogival that we should object The Hon*tale H. Miiolson, C.M.G., K H.M’s. Charge d*Affaires, British Legation, Tehran . f toto tJae le-vy of a two- Kxan charge from him as is levied from Persian subjects returning to Persia from Bahrain without the Ilm- o- Khabar * (c) The amount of the I 1 m- o- Khaoar fee, even when doubled, is insignificant. Its possession saves the holder from paying the cost or the double cost of a passport which he should possess if returning from Muscat or Iraq. (d) If the Persian Government could see their way to changing the form of this certificate ttH so as to read 'from one port in the Persian Gulf to another” it would Me quite unobjectionable and they could honestly collect the fee from all persons unfurnished with passports, travelling between Persia/ and huwait» Trucial Oman or Muscat as well as from the Persian ports., 3. I am of opinion that His Majesty f s Legation can only taice one of the two following courses now s- (a) to inform the Persian Government that, having seen a specimen of the Iim- »o-» Khabar subsequent to Sir P. Loraine's conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in October last, they place ohrecord the view that ( its use for persons travelling to Bahrain doe^not affect the claim to independence under British protection of the Chief of those islands vis- a- vis the Persian Government; or (b) to ignore officially the fact that I 1 m - o-Khabar certificates are used in a wrongful way. 4. The confiscation by Persian passport authorities of British passports and -oritish certificates of identity is another matter altogether• It should be strongly objected to. There are thousands of persons in Persia of Persian origin, v/ho personally or through their fathers have ac quired British naturalization in England, India or else where. These persons can only be regarded by the Persian Government as having two nationalities, and our right\ right to recognize them as such also is incontestable The Persian Governmenif cannot properly confiscate their haitish passports f acquired in tneir country of naturalization, even if such documents are to a certain degree inoperative in Persia. The case for hritish certificates of identity seems to be similar. The benefits which these certificates confer on British-protected persons travelling to India or Iraq are appreciable. Moreover the possessors of them in Persia also are able to count on British consular good offices, which are by no means a negligeable asset. &amp;• 1 am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to tne Government of India and to His xuAj.Q&amp;ty'a Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

INDIA o:^ics # WI 7 ITE] T AII, # LondorT, 1. 4th Noven:^er 1926. Sir, . I m directed by tiie Secretary of State for India t to refer to year letter of the lot October, No. T.^1069/235/ 73, relative to the ..grant of travelling pa es to subjects of Bahrein ani to sa^ t at, before causing i iBtmctions to be issued in the sense suggested oy the Secretary of state for Foreign -affairs, he would prefer that the question should be re-exau ned with reference to the oints mentioned below. In the first place the Carl of Jirkenheaft is unabli to find justification for the atateme.it, made in para^ ;raoh 2 of your letter, tint according to the letter addressed by His If jesty^r Consul deneral at Du shire to His MajesV f s Minister at Tehran on the 20th of f ay last the dai of holders of British identity certificates issued in Bahrein or Iraq to the possession of such certificates is open to deuot. Lieut.Col.Prideaux refers especially to the posses sion ox these certificates of Bahreinis residents at Loham lerah, but he does not suggest that subjects of Bahrein who h- vc taken up residence in Persia have thereby acquired Persian nationality in supersession of their former status. Bo long as such persons do :iot voluntarily adopt Persian nationality they would appear to be entitled to retain these certificates of identity, nor would there appear to be any objection, in pri ciple, to their being registered as British-pro tec ted persons. It will be recalled that in 1906 (telegram to Tehran, No. 28, 9th Cebruaiy 1906) ani again in 1908 (Tehran despatch ho. 101, 24th April,1908) and in 1909,(Tehran despatch No. 116, 4th June 1909, the Persian CoveTYiment were info mi'd that ; is Majesty's Government con sidered the island of Bahrein and its inhabitants to be un or British protection. I am t invite a reference in this connection to tlie arrangements made in 1910 for the protec tion cf Bohreinis -t I dluicr.erah, a report of which was made toto Sir 2. Grey in Tehran despatch o* 235 ck ted the ^3rd 1910, An agreement was then made locally with the Sheikh ol kohammerah to the effect that Sahreinis who had take i up resi dence at flohammerah since tiie accession of Sheikh iQiaZcfl should be registered by his h.alesty’e Consul as dritish-protected persons upon application to him, and tliat th ciiildren of such persons should also be entitled to registration. The ersimi Goverrment, hov/ever, wer not informed of these arra ge entr, and this Jepartne t is unaware whether any reply was male to Sir G,Barclay's despatch, in the lost para ;ranh of ’Vhich he invited the concurrence of air 2. Grey in aooroving them. It would anpeor, however, from 3u r hire letter dated the 22nd Jaruary 1913, ( a copy of which was sent to you with India Office letter P.801 on Hie 3rd March 1913) that there arra ge ne nts were still in force at that time: and i &lt; apy case they show the attitude which the Minister at Tehran and British officers in South Persia then considered themselves, authorised to adopt in regard to the protection Bahreinis at . ohanmeraji* 3, It is true that in his letter of the. ~Gth May Lieut.uol. Prideaux aupears to hold that a Bahreini is not entitled to a ^ritish Passport (as distinct from a certificate of identity issued by a Britidi Officer) unless he ha- already becoine a naturalised ’*itish subject. It may be recalled, however, that in June 1918, the Government of India, as a war measure issued % instructions to the following effect (see enclosure to India Office letter P.3510/18, dated the 17th August IQlSj-^All subjects of States in the Persian Gulf and of the King of the Hejaz should be treated as British nrotected oer^ons in the matter of passports, hen th8? hold no passports from their own rulers, and require than for journeys outside the Gulf, they should be granted Ittlian passports describing them as^iative of' Muscat, Bahrein, Koweit, the Iledjaz, etc., as the case may be, Tand as such entitled to British protection.' When such persons possess passports issued by their own rulers, these should similarly be endorsed'. Bubsequently in August,1923,(see this Office letter I c. 0. 3132/23 dated the 10th Septemuer) these orders ’ ere canc lied in so far as they concern subjects of Muscat.runcat, Koweit and of the King of the Kejaz, but go iar as this office is aware they still remain in force in respect of subjects of Bahrein. Witiiout suggart^ing that it is necessary ly desirable at present to t^ke up this point with the rersim Government, Lord Birkenhead would be glad to learn whether Sir Austen Chamberlain dissents from the view that a subject of Bahrein which, though not formally a British protectorate, has been repeatedly declared by His Ixjesty’s Gover rnent to be under their protection and the foreign relatione of which are under^Sontrol- is entitled to hold a British pa r ort os a British-protected nerson. The grant of such passports to Bahreinis would be the natural counterpart of the arrangement 1 which was on the point of being introduced in 1923 (see your letter o. B. 1485/67/91, dated the 14th February 1923) under which Persian subjects proceeding to Bahrein would be re quired to provide themselves v/ith a British pans or visa* 4* The above considerations appear to Lord Birkenhead to invalidate the inference drawn in ourajn.ph 2 of your letter, that it would be impolitic to protest against the confiscation of British certificates of identity by the Persian authorities, moreover, in the only recent case of such confiscation that is on record (see enclosure to this Office letter P.73 of the 20th January 1926) when identity certificate carried by two 3 hrein subjects travelling f v on Bahrein to Jebai were confiscated by a Persian passport officer at Lingah, there would seen to have been no doubt whatever respecting the title of the holders to the possessior of these certificates. In view of the rarity of cases of con fiscation of British papers and of Sir P.Loraine’c statement (see his letter of lOttyJune to Lieut. Bol. Prideaux, copy er closed with your letter T,8352/235/378 of the 9th July )thut 'it does not seem that such incidents are due to more than excess of seal on the part of local authorities, nor do I anti cipate that they v/ill be frequently repeated', it would appear that matters have not yet gone so far that the alternative. u unless| | unless the issue of certificate is discontinued, i ' 'between protesting against and acquiescing in the regular seizure of British certificates of identity by the Persian authorities. 11 5. . Lord Bidcenhead is therefore of opinion, as at present advised, that no sufficient reasons exist for terl- VI nating the issue of British certificate of identity to Bahreini subjects. Moreover this course, would appear to be open to serious objection unless the Sheikh of Bahrein is permitted to i .-sue hir own ’a oorts or travelling docuiaents (rahdaris) such as he 1 -sued before the war. From recent r letters of Lieut.Col. Prideaux (dated 20th M,y and 10th duly) it will be noted that the British certificates confer appre ciable benefits on British protected perons travelling to India or Iraq, and in Persia also enable them to count on the good offices of British consuls. Passengers also on steamers sailing between India and the Persian Gulf are required to carry travelling documents oi some description. If British certificates of identity vyq no longer to be granted to Bahrei is, and if the Sheikh of Bahrein is prevented from issuing his own documents, the^bnly alternative open to Bahreinis who wish to take out papers when going abroad would be to obtain Persian passports. Lord Birkenhead finds it dir icult to believe that Sir Austen Chamberlain would con template such a surrender to Persian claims to sovereignty ever Bahrein. 6. Subject to any further views that Sir austen Chamberlain may wish to express. Lord Birkenhead would suggest that, in the absence of satisfactory alternative arrangements, British certificates of identity should con- time to be issued to subjects of Bahrein, and that His Majesty 1 s Minister at Tehran should be instructed to make an t energetic protest if aity further instance of the confiscation of British docudvents occurs. As regards the Ilm-o-Khabar passes, if Sir Austen Chamberlain is not prepared to run the , r risk of re-onening the whole question of the position of Bahrein at th° present time, he will not resist the view thatFin f.'i jesty'r, Goverme it r;} o Id tacitly acquiesce in the compulsory issue of those pa ees Dy the Persian uutliorities to Bfhreinis e terlng and leaving Persia, unsatisfactory and illogical us tliis course muy be* A copy oi’ this letter Is being sent to the Colonial om ce* I have etc..

Sir, V/ith reference to your letter P 3365 of the 4th ultimo, respecting the grant of travelling passes to subjects of Bahrein, I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to inform you that he has given careful consideration to Lord Birkenhead^ suggestion that, in the absence of satisfactory alternative arrangements, British certificates of identity should continue to be issued. 2. On political grounds it is of great importance to avoid any action which would result in the re-awakening of the controversy as to the sovereignty of Bahrein, and it is difficult to see how this could be avoided were the seizure by the Persian authorities of British certificates of identity issued to Bahrein subjects to become a general practice. The only alternative to faci] the major question would then be to acquiesce in the seizure of British document by a foreign authority^ a course which appears equally open to objection. On the other hand Sir Austen Chamberlain is desirous of meeting the views expressed in your above mentioned letter, and a middle course has accordingly been sought, and it is thought that a satisfactory solution has been found by a study of the earlier history of these documents. 3. It is stated on page 3 of the memorandum enclosed in the despatch No. 34/202-S of May 20th last,addressed by His I^ajesty’s Consul General at Bushire to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, a copy of which was transmitted to you with the letter from this department T 8352/235/378 of July 9th, thatjit was in 1915 as a war measure, that orders were first issued that all travellers from Arab towns to places outside the Persian7 Persian Gulf, i.e. to Iraq, India etc., should furnish themselves with British certificates of identity in place of the letters of recommendation previously issued by the Arab Sheikhs of Bahrein, Dibai etc. to their subjects proceeding abroad# 4# In this Memorandum Lieutenant Colonel Prideaux states that these documents, if subroitted to a British political agent or Residency agent, were endorsed in English, certifying to the holders nationality and recommending him to the good offices of British officers. He adds that travellers found the certificates so helpful that the practice became general of taking them out also for journeys to Persia etc., and that the practice continues. 5. There is no reason why Bahrein subjects should not still be given British documents for production to British authorities,iwhich seems to have been the sole purpose for which they are originally issued) and I am therefore to suggest for Lord Birkenhead’s consideration that the issue of these certificates should be continued, but with the addition of a clause to the effect that they are merely a recommendation to British officials and that they are not intended for production to foreign authorities The use of Ilm-o-Khabar for the purpose of travelling to Persia could at the same time be given tacit acquiescence as proposed by His Majesty’s Charge d*Affaires at Tehran in his despatch No. 394 of the 7th August last. 6 . If the Government of India and Government of Iraq were then informed that the additional clause was not intended to affect the 'fcalue of these certificates in the eyes of their authorities, the documents would have the same value in practice as they possessed before the change, while the possibility of their seizure by the Persian authorities would be avoided.7. If this solution is held to be satisfactory it is presumed that Lord Birkenhead will concur in the maintenance of the embargo upon the issue of passports by the Shaikhs themselves* I am, etc*, Sd.

A A+ 77 9f //./y.Xj‘January I encloao cuttings from the 'Pioneer'of 31st December iyh7 and the 'Times of India' of hnd Danuar 19D8, which as you will see are all full of incorrect *1* statements. The Pioneer remarks that 'largely on account of intri gues among nie sons' the British authorities persuaded bheiich Isa to abdicate in favour of nio son abdullah. The reason for the abdication in lyh3 not was gross misgovernnont and oppression of his Bhiah subjects. It was Sheikh Isa bin All Al Khalifa's son, Sheikh Hamad and not Abdullah who succeeded. There is no justification whatever of tne statement that 60 years ago under threat of a Persian attack the Turks seined Bahrein. Mr.Belgrave objects to the Times of India's remarks about the Customs Revenues from the pearl industry giving the -helkh of Bahreinan income of £.80,000/- yearly, but I do not consider this point of view can be rightly contested. kr.Belgrave considers that further publicity of the fact that H.B. SheiKh namad is the richest ruler in the Persia Gulf will attract still larger crowd of beggars to the islands. ille °T India is also guilty of the mistatement that the Turks laid hands on Bahrein.

Fir, I have the honour to state that since I assumed charge of the appointment of Political Resident in the ersian Gulf the question of our relations with the State of Bahrain has given me some cause for reflection. Cur that position in xkn I.haiichdom, and the amount of control that we exercise, appear to be open to criticism when viewed from an international standpoint. r 'his would be of no great importance but for three factors 1. ersia has never ceased to claim sovereignty ovei Bahrain and our own Foreign Office have recently not been desirous of raising the question of the status of that place. 2. ihe cie iacto Ruling Chief, with whose consent we intervene, was placed in his position by us, when we deposed his father from the chief authority. 5.

An appeal to the League of nations by ''ersia, forwarding an appeal by Shaiich isa or one o^ his relations on the lines of the ersian protest in 1669 would. I think, place us in a difficult positionGulf 2 position. V/hile I do not consider this a very likely event now, owing to our better relations with Shaikh Isa, it does not seem to be sound politics to leave so important a natter to chance; there are many other combinations to consider, such a*Shaikh Hanad himself changing his view with regard to us; interference by Ibn Saud with the rel- -igious appeal; indeed any of the possible derangements which can occur where matters depend upon the personal element alone. In studying the question of the development of our position in Bahrain to its present condition many other matters arise, ouch as the still existing claims of Persia, and in the past those of Muscat, the Wahabis, the Lgypt- -ians and the Turks, all of which affect the validity of the ersian demands. 4* In order to prevent one despatch being too un- -wieldy, I have found it necessary to divide the subject into two despatches, the first dealing with the subjects mentioned in the above paragraph i.e. the international aspect, the second dealing with the facts which led to our talcing so intimate a part in the internal administrat- -ion of the Islands and with the degree to which that interference has now reached. The first despatch is bound to be a long one. when I say that the important dates which we have to con- -sider today are 176b, 1803, 1811, 182G, 1822, 1638, 1648,] 1859, 1869, 1880, 1886 and 1892, while many other dates of almost equal importance occur, it will be seen that a per- -iod is covered during which constant activity was kept up which cannot be disposed of in a few ^ages, and of which activity every incident which I quote has an important bearing on the decisions and opinions to be formed. In this despatch 1 will then deal with the history of the Chaikhhom for the last 150 years, showing how Bahrain became involved in our policy in the PersianGulf Gulf and the facte upon which the Island, a claim whiou she is a century and a half since jurisdiction in the ^lace. Persia bases its claim to has never dropped though it she has had any form of ik actuality both the .Vahabis ana the tulian of Muscat have had far more recent possession of the Islands ana claim of Persia has been icept alive by purely diplomatic or fictitious incidents which have occurred through the difficulties in which the ShaiJchs of Balirain ha- e found tlieiaselves, either in preserving their independ* -ence or in meeting the activities of rival pretenders to the Ghaikhdom. The claim of ersia would not intrinsically stand the test of examination nii by a committee of the heague of nations. ^ or purpose before us it is necessary to go back to the year 1782, at which date Bahrain was unquestior. -ably in possession of the Persians, who had first occupied i u in 1602, when they expelled the Portuguese. How long the^ held it has apparently not been determined, but in 1716 the Islands were taken lay a short time by the Omani Sultanate. In the middle of the 18th century the Kowalah Arabs controlled the politics of the archpeligo, out in 1705 the Persians definitely occui ied the islands. ±n 1765 they were once for all driven out by the Arabs led by the Shaikhs of the Utb tribe, who still hold Balirain today. 7 * v ^ en it is said at any time that the Persians held the Balirain Islands, the expression needs ex x JLcination. Until as recently as 1804, Bushire, from whence the sea power came, was held by an Arab Shaikh under Persian sover eignty, and to this day the Persian islands of the Persian Gulf are occupied by Arabs and Arab Shaikhs who are similar -iy i &gt;ers i an subjects. 'hese are the men who supplied th ships and the crews which acted for the Persians in PersianGulf history; the Persians have never been seamen. 8• Thus in 1785 Bahrain was held by the Arab Shaikh Nasir of Bushire, under the orders of the Persian Govern- -ment, then settled at Shiraz. The garrison when attack- -ed by the Arabs from the Southern mainland were commanded by Shaikh hasir’s son, and after a seige of two months* duration the latter capitulated on the 27th July and the garrison were permitted to return to Bushire. Henceforward the archipelago was ruled by the A1 Khalifeh section of the Utbi tribe, a fact which gave umbrage to the Jatahmieh section of/ the tribe, who with- -drew to Qatar on the mainland, whence the Utb had come, and who for many years to follow supplied claimants or joined in with other claimants for the attacks on the ruling Shaikhs. 9* In the same year 1785 the Persian Arab Shaikhs of Bushire and Hormuz assisted by Persian troops made prepar- -ations on a large scale for an attack on Bahrain in which the Shaikh of the Qowasim on the Pirate Coast was to take part, but the expedition never sailed. In 176b similar preparations were made but were broken up by the death of Ali Murad Khan of ihiraz. During the domestic difficulties of the Shiraz Government which followed, Bahrain remained unmolested, during which time it acquired a great merc/an tile fleet and the prosperity of the Islands developed till they be- -came the chief commercial emporium of the western end of the Persian Gulf. 10. For the next generation such threats as were made to the independence of Bahrain came, not from Persia, but from other sources. • In 1791 Saiyid Sultan of Muscat, with the en- -couragement of the Persian Governor of Shiraz, which place was no longer the seat of the Persian Government, declared war on Bahrain.14. 5 The Utb Shaikh, alarmed by hie proceedings, opened correspondence with Shaikh Nasir of Bushire and on their offering to become tributary to Persia the Shaikh proceeded privately to Bahrain and received an instalment of the revenue for the previous year on behalf of Persia. 18©Q Saiyid Sultan of Muscat invaded Bahrain, deported twenty five of the leading families to Muscat, and established an Omani garrison on Kuharraq Island, ihis garrison was in the following year, however, compelled by the Utb to surrender and to evacuate Bahrain. The Persians do not seem to have assisted, but in the same year, 1801, the Muscat ruler, with assistance from Bushire, given with the permission of the Persian Gov- -ernor of I&gt;hiraz, again landed at Bahrain. 12 • 3y this time however the Bahrain Shaikhs had secured the support of the Wahabis, who were threatening the outposts of Oman, and Paly id Sultan was obliged to return to protect his own country. For the next ten years the Shaikhs of Bahrain succumbed, though reluctantly, to the influence of the Wahabis. \ 1603 they sent a fleet to cruise against Muscat during the pearl season, and not only sustained the resultant pecuniary loss, but also received a heavy defeat. In 1805 they joined a movement to destroy Wahabi influence, but in 1810 the Wahabis appointed an agent to live at Bah* -rain to superintend the administration, though leaving the local authority in the hands of the Utb Shaikhs. At the same time they appointed Wahabi teachers to convert the people to the Wahabi doctrine. 13. In 1611 the Wahabi Amir reduced his garrison in Bahrain in consequence of the gradual advance of the Egyptians on his frontiers. The Imam of Muscat attacked Bahrain and the Wahabi Agent w-.s taken prisoner and the power of the Utb restored.14. To follow year by year the change of fortune of Bahrain, its dependence now upon the Wahabis, its dangers now from the Sultan of Kuscat, and then the Egyptians who had ousted the Wahabis, the c/alias of Turkey from the date they conquered the Wahabi country, and the continued though intermittent claim of Persia, though every detail of it bears upon our position in Bahrain and that of Persia has taken a hundred pages of foolscap to note upon. It is obvious that no despatch could bear this weight. I have accordingly written, with the assistance of Major Barrett, Political Agent of Bahrain, a monograph on the subject which I will forward separately and which can be referred to, if necessary, and in this despatch I will attempt to keep to the main yaxyum events which have affected the question. 15• In 1817 the Resident found the conduct of the Utb Shaikh moot unsatisfactory in connection with Jtha piracy, our main concern in the Persian Gulf, and Bahrain became the principal mart for the property plundered by xhx pir- -atea, and the main depot from which the tyvwaaim, the pirat centre, drew their supplies of rice and dates. In the previous year, 1816, the Resident, .ieut* Bruce, of the Indian Navy, had made an informal agreement with the Shaikhs, and in 1819 an agreement of a similar nature was contemplated by the Government with the object of restraining the Am Bahrain Arabs from piracy. 18. In 1820 the Persian Governor asked the Sultan of Muscat and indeed the British also, to convey Persian troops to Bahrain. In the some year, the Bahrain Govern- -ment, fearing that an attack would succeed, made full submission to the Multan of Oman and agreed to pay him an annual tribute of # 3.000/- per annum. Both parties appear to have asked for the guarant -ee of the British Government to this agreement. In February of the same year a preliminary treaty of } e*oe was made by the Shaikhs with the Bombay Government to7 to present the sale of plundered goods, and unaer thia treaty the Shaikhs v?ere adroit ted to the benefits of the general treaty of Peace of the Trucial Coast. 17 * In 18 22 an extraordinary incident took place, and it is upon this that the Persians raainly base their claim to the Islands of Bahrain. Captain Bruce, the Resident at Bahrain, had been considerably worried by the attempts of rival claimants to the Bahrain principality, and he finally came to the con- -elusion that the only way to achieve peace and to prevent piracy was to hand over Bahrain to Persia. Accordingly, in August 1822, he made an extra- -orcinary and unauthorised agreement with the Prince Governor of Shiraz relating to the whole of the Persian Gulf. It may be added that the Governor of Shiraz was also not authorised by his Government to enter into this agreement. IB. in this agreement, with reference to Bahrain, it was stated that the Islands of Bahrain had always been suooiuina.e to the Government of Ifars, against whose auth- -ority the Shaikh/ of the Islands had lately become rebell- -ions, that accordingly the flag granted to the Shaikh under the general treaty of Persia whould be withdrawn, cand that no assistance should in future be granted by Great Britain to the Utb Shaikhs, that on the contrary she should assist Persia against them by lending one or two vessels. In other words the title of Persia to Bahrain was explicitly admitted. 19. -he Government of Bombay promptly disavowed the action of thtcyrepresentative in Pars and removed Captain Bruce from his appointment . In doing so they remarked regarding the agree- -men t :- It acknowledges the King of Persia's title ' totl to Balirain, of which there ia not the least proof. and to which the British Government cannot assent without injuring the pretensions of the Imaum and the Awtabeee. It promised our aid against every M Power possessed of an island in the Gulf, and ex- -pressly against the Attahees, to whom we are bound by a treaty of friendship, and with whose conduct we have every reason to be satisfied. ' *he Government of Bombay also pointed out that the agreement totally violated all the principles of our policy in the Persian Gulf. The Shah of Persia appears to have been equally annoyed with his representative for conducting unauthorised negotiations and he equally refused to ratify the agree- -ment. 1820 Muscat made its last attack on Bahrain, and was defeated partly by the Utb, partly by cholera. The Imam lost considerable prestige in the Gulf by his defeat and in future confined his attention mainly to Africa. It may be stated hat the various attacks of Muscat were based on the failure of Bahrain to pay the tribute to which it had bound itself. 21 • In 1830 the power of the Wahabis was again established in Central Arabia, and Bahrain imraediately felt the repercussion. At the end of the year the Wahabis presented the Shaikhs with a demand for the payment of M Zakat' and for the cession of Dammam, on the mainland of Haaa, which was still held hy Bahrain. he Shaikh attempted, without success, to obtain the intervention of the British author!t -ies; in consequence an agreement was made with the Wahabis in which the supremacy of the Wahabi Amir was acknowledged, and the right to the payment of the Zakat admitted. The Amir in return undertook to protect Bahrain against externa aggression.aggression. In 1633 the Shaikhs threw off cheir allegiance, but in 1836, as there was talk of the Persian Govemioent raising their clain to sovereignty, the Shaikhs once more became reconciled to the Wahabi Aiair and agreed vG pa^ nirn '/ 2,000/- per annuia as tribute, the Amir promis- -ing in return to supply troops for the defence of Bahrain. 22* As will have been seen throughout the object of • iic British Government had been to achieve xhx maritime peace for the safety of the carrying of their trade, and in 1636 a restrictive line was laid down for the ChitVs of the Trucial Coast beyond which hostilities at sea were not ^er- -mitted. This restrictive line was extended to the rhaikhs of Bahrain. 23* In 1838 the Wahabi .Amir was captured by the Egyptians and deported to Egypt, a puppet being set up an in his place. at The Shaikh of Bahrain was much alarmed by the ra.:JOUxB he heard anci, in reply to the demands of the PUPP©t Amir Khalid, processed hi.'iself to be a subject of the 5 er» -sian Government; as a result the Persian Governor of Shira, sent an envoy to reside at Bahrain, but his mission was a failure. The intentions of Khurohid '’asha, the Governor of hasa, now became clear and the Government of India found themselves, to some extent, bound to anticipate the intent- -ions of H.M»s. Government regarding the policy to be pur- -sued in the ersian Gulf, and the presence of a British naval squadron in the Gulf was made use of, and the Command' -er was instructed 'strongly to use his influence' to deter the Egyptian general from further encroachment. '’he Admiral was empowered, in the event of the Shaikh of Bahraii soliciting British aid, to afford every encouragraent to resist, and all the support he could render without engaging in actual hostilities. The'^he Governor General of India was not disused at the time to enter into any new engagement with the Shaikh of Bahrain, but the Admiral was instructed, in case such an engagement should be suggested, bo far to encoura^ the proposals of the Shaikh as to transmit them for the consideration of the Government of India. In other words the Government realised the ser- -iousneso of the situation if the Bgyptisns desired to annex Bahrain, but did not wish to be drawn into a diffi cult situation unless circumstances really demanded it. 24. From this period dates our more active intervent- -ion in the affairs of Bahrain. In a letter dated 18th April 1859, the Indian Government advanced beyond the position they had taken up, and empowered the Admiral, in the event of the Shaikh claiming British intervention, and offering to place his territories under British protection, to assure him of the temporary protection of H.M’s. squadron and to intimate hie action to the Egyptian commander. About the same time the Admiral visited Bahrain, accompanied by Captain Edmunds, Assistant Political Resid- -ent, and Bhaikh Abdullah gave the latter a promise that he would take no steps to place himself under the authority or protection of a Foreign Power without first consulting the British Resident; but in the same year the Shaikh unexpect- -edly acknowledged the supremacy of the Egyptians and cov enanted to pay them a tribute of 2 , 000 /- per annum, on condition that his local authority should be preserved and that no Egyptian representative should be sent to reside at Bahrain. The Ghaikh justified his action*by the Hesid- -ent’s refusal to give him advice % of a specified assurance of support, and of a virtual immunity from disturbance which he had purchased for a trifling and mere pecuniary sacrifice. 25. The Resident delivered a written protest to the Rhaikh, and another in nearly the same terms to the EgyptianI u © Egyptian aemmander. The Shaikh protested t)mt he would never, even at the demand of the Igyptianu, ^lace himaelf in opposition to the British Government and he offered, on condition that distinct pledges of protection should be given him in writing to repudiate his agreement with the Pasha and to avow himself a dependant of the British Gov- -ernment - but he refused to put this in waiting. 26. This circumstance is most illuminating, especi ally in relation to our dealings with the Shaikhs of C^atar and tile ^’rucial Coast today, when the circumstances are very similar. ./ithout our definite pledge of assistance the Shaikh of Bahrain of that day could not afford to com- -promise himself with the power on the mainland. The Egyptian question was brought to an end in the following year, 1840, on the evacuation of Hasa. 27. By his conduct with the Egyptians Shaikh Abdullah had forfeited the trust of the British Government, and the possibility of his being displaced by a more favourably disposed r&gt;haikh was discussed. In 1842 a rival appeared in the form of one Jioh- -ammed bin Khalifeh, a grand-nephetir of Shaikh Abdullah. he Tahabis, who were once again in power, supported the young claimant and Isa bin Tarif of qatar and Bashir bin J-ahrnak, an Utb chief of the Jatahmieh section, askea per- -mission of the Resident to join themselves with Shaikh Mohammed. This sanction was given, and in April 1843 Bahrain passed into the possession of Shaikh Mohammed. 28. In 1843 the Government of India issued orders that an invasion of Bahrain by the ex-Shaikh Abdullah would be prevented if necessary by a British naval force. In 1847, however. Shaikh Mohammed bound himself to pay tribute to the Wahabis at the rate of $ 2,000/- per annum. 29. In the same year, 1847, ^urkioh claims to Bahrain were advanced from Basrah, apparently for the first time. r, he Shaikh was invited to declare his allegiance to the Sultan,12 Sultan, and to submit a detailed list of his shining, in order that it might be registered under the Turkish flag. For various reasons the Shaikh was disposed to accept this advance on the part of the Turkish Government. 30. ‘his caused the Bombay Government to state that it was obviously desirable to exclude interference by l?or- -eign bwers in the affairs of the Persian Gulf, inasmuch as without retaining supreme authority the British Govern- -ment could not hope to secure the performance of the ob- -jects which they had attained in that quarter at a large expense. ''’he Board of Directors concurred in their re- -commendation that “any attempts upon Bahrain should be 4 resisted by the British naval force”. The Resident, Major Hennell, was authorised to ascertain whether the Shaikh was inclined to enter into a closer connection with the British power, and some months later Ghaikh Mohammed ex- —pressed a wish that his Shaikhdom should be taken under British protection, but in 1849 the Resident was directed -o decline the proposal of the Shaikh, but to assure him of the continuance of the goodwill and friendship of the British Government. In 1850 the Shaikh was on bad terms with us and sent insulting messages to the Resident. 31 • In 1B51 the Shaikh was on the point of succumbing to the wahabis when a British Squadron arriving took the Islands under their wing. \ In the same year a claim by the ^orte to the sov- -ereignty over Bahrain was summarily rejected by the Brit- -ish Government. 1853 the British Government authorised the Gov -eminent of Bombay to offer every obstacle to an attack upon these Islands by the vahabi Amir, who was now norain— -ally subject to the Ottoman 'rmpire, on the ground that Her -lajesty’a Government would not permit the occupation of BahrainBahrain by the Turiciah Govermaent or by anyone acting for them or in their interest. In i8b9 the Persian Gulf Squadron was again ciee^e -patched for the protection of the Islands and the Wahabi governor »ued for pardon. bb. In 18b9 8hailch iAohai.uaed made simultaneous applic- -ation for protection to the Persian Governor of ’are, and to the 'urkish wali of Baghdad. The response of the 'Parks was delayed but a •ereian agent, one itirza &amp;ehdi Khan, a well known ^mglo- -phobe, almost iimaediately arrived in Bahrain, the '’ersian flag was hoisted anu Persian sovereignty proclaiiaed. rcarcely however nad the^e ceremonies been performed when Mohammed Bey, the emissary of the Mustafa, Kuri Pasha, appeared, the Persian flag was again lowered, and the Turk- -ish flag raised into its place - to complete the absurdity the Persian agent refused to leave Bahrain or surrender his imaginary authority. 54. Sir Henry Kuwxinson, the British Minister in ehran, differed from Captain Pelix Jones, the Resident, and regarded the matters as of slight account. He content- -ed himself with obtaining from the Shah’s Minister an assurance that no military occupation of Bahrain should be undertaken by Persia until the question of title had been settled by diplomatic discussion. The Government of Bombay instructed the Itesident not to interfere with the occupation of Bahrain, whether by Turkey or Persia, otherwise than by a protest, and by an intimation that the matter hod been reported to H.M’s. Government and that aggression on the neighbouring tribes would be prevented by force if necessary. While discussion on the subject was continuing the 'urkish and Persian agents apparently vanished from Bahrain. 55. In 1861 the Chaikh commenced hostilities against Has a14 Hasa # but was brought to his senses by the despatch of K.M's. ships to the spot. He made submission ana signed a convention in May of that year, acknowledging the valid- -ity of the treaties and conventions concluded with the British Government by his predecessors, and undertook to recognise the jurisdiction of the British Agent and the Political Resident over British subjects of every kind in Bahrain, and to allow the latter to reside in his dominion One result of this convention was to assimilate the position of the Shaikh of Bahrain, who was not a party to the Perpetual Treaty of Peace, to that of the Trucial Chiefs. By 36. In 1863 the Chief was again behaving badly and at 4 the end of 186b the Resident seized one of his war vessels. The Persian Government who had in 1862 complained about a similar incident now complained again on the ground that under the agreement concluded by Captain Bruce in 1822 Bahrain was a dependency of Persia. The Government of India informed the Minister at Tehran of the facts of the case and stated that whatever might have been the pretensions of the .thah to Bahrain in bygone days he could not now be regarded as having any rights in the Principality. This view was approved of by H.M’s. Government in 1867. XxidbKX 37. At this time the Shaikh of Bahrain was paying a sum of 4,000 jmnually to the Wahabis on account of Qatar but was held by the Government of India to be independent \ as far as Bahrain was concerned. Owing to his treacherous and piratical destract- -ion of Bohah and V/akrah, the chief towns of v 0 atar, in October 1867,Shaikh Mohammed of Bahrain was deposed in 1866 by the action of the British Government and his brother ^ Shaikh All was appointed in his place, and protest was again made by the Persian authorities. 38. A complaint, in which Bahrain was claimed to be the property of Persia, was addressed by the Shah’s Ministc tc f^gune ac tual control and hia15. to Minister in Tehran, another wais acicircaiieci by ^he ^Carguxar at r.hiraz to Col. Telly, the lleoiaent at “uahire, and a third, with which Mere enclosed two letters from the deposed Chaikh of Bahrain, was lodged at the Foreign Office on the 13th April 18C9 by the Persian ianis- - ,er in London. Apxx A principal ground of complaint was ..hat no previous notice had been given to Persia^ of the British intention to proceed against Bahrain. 59. In a reply sent on the 29th April 18(59, after consultation between the Secretary of State for India and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Persian Minister was reminded that the Shaikh of Bahrain had at diiferent periods in the past entered into direct communic- -ation with the British Government, he was assured m* the sole objects of the British Government in holding the * haikh to hose engagements were the prevention of piracy, oi the slave trade, and the maintenance of the police of the Gulf, duties of which Great Britain would gladly, if it were possible, divest herself in favour of Persia. in conclusion a promise was given that should punitive measur- -cs against the Shaikh of Bahrain again become necessary, IumL:. Government would, if practicable, cause the fersian Government to be Informed beforehand and that in cases in which this might be impossible in consequence of the delay which a reference to the Court of Tehran would involve, a lull coramunication on the subject would be made to the Per- -sian Government. \ ..he object oi this re^ly was to avoid causing irritation at ehran, but it is not surprising that it was subsequently quoted against us. 40 * 1x1 ^ ie year Shaikh Mohammed attacked Bahrain and Shaikh All was killed in the defence. The British Government blockaded Bahrain, captured and deported the Shaikhs concerned in the attack and replace Shaikh Ali by his son Shaikh lea. (The latter has reigned for 58 years and was in 1923, four years ago, deposed by us from the actual control and hi* troa44. 16. from the actual control, hiu oon Shaikh Hamad, the present Shaikh, being made Deputy Huler in his xJ lace). were informed of the action taken and the usual complaint followed. of State pointing out that the Persian Government had no Eavy and was incapable of assisting the British Government in maintaining the peace at sea, while iiciqcckattt a Havy, it would only have meant that they would have been embroiled with the Sultan of Oman, with the Arab Principalities, with the Wahabi Power and with Turkey, all of whom were antagon istic to her; indeed the assertion of claims by Persia had already caused xhc revival of similar obsolete claims by Turk ey and other Powers. 42. In a despatch of the 27th iiay 1870 the Government 'performance of the tasks vve have undertaken we must 'withdraw altogether; but the consequences of such a 'step would be so disastrous, not only to our national 'honour but to the peace of the Gulf, to the prosperity 'of the tribes inhabiting the littoral and to the lives 'and property of our subjects who during the peace of 'the last 50 years have settled on the shores and em- '-barked enormous capital in the pearl fisheries and the 'trade with the mainland, that we cannot contemplate 'this course as one which H.M f e. Government could for a moment contemplate.' -ter in London against the proceedings of the British auth- -orities in Bahrain which were represented as acts of Brit- -ish sovereignty over ' a portion of Turkish territory.' The Ottoman Government was informed that the British Gov- -ernment could not recognise the Turkish claim to the eov- -ereignty of Bahrain. 41. In the same year, 1869, the Persian Government he Government of India replied to the Secretary had theyhad of India observed 'If mo are no longer prepared to continue of 43. A protest was also entered by the Turkish Hinls-17. 44. In 189r! :h.e queaticn ofifciac uricler coniiidera a^ain In coneequence of certain ta^es, recoverable from Ottoman subjects only, having been levied at Basrah from natives of Bahrain; a demand for a refund was preferred by the British Assistant Political Agent, who contended that Bahrain and its inhabitsinto were under British protect -ion. On this occasion the 'urleish Government addressed tlie British Embaaay at Constantinople and denied the title of natives of Bahrain to British protection; bjit the reply, given under the instructions of II.M’s. Government, was to A.&lt;.e ex fee i/ that, as Bahrain was now under the protection of K.K. the Queen of England, no interference by the Ottoman authorities with the natives* of ISahrain cculd be admitted. A year later, in April 1S93, the Turkish Government again protected against the assumption by the British Assistant Political Agent at Basrah of a title to protect natives of Bahrain; and once more H.M’s. Government maintained the right of their Aiplcmatic and Consular representatives in tne Ottoman Pmpire to extend their g^od offices to the class of persons in question. 45 * In interest in the Persian Gulf was being shown by Foreign Powers. French, American and Japanese vessels had visited its waters. In the ciroumctances, believing that Bahrain, as one of the chief commercial centres, would soon become an object oi this attention, the Resident, finding the Shaikh disposed to conclude a special arrangement with the British Government, took the opportunity to obtain his signature to an agreement which was approved by the British Government ii xii 1881. 40, Ii; Bound ilu Phaikh fram to abstain from entering in v,o negotiations with or making treaties with other Govern- -ments except with the sanction of the British Government, and he agreed to refuse permission to any other Government other than the British to establish Diplomatic or Consular Agencies or Coaling Depots in Bahrain territory, except wit!■ 1 '“‘'s . ' 18. the consent of the British Government. 47. In 1886 the chah of Persia had verbally requested Mr. Nicholson to convey to the British Government the fact that he considered the communication made to him in 1869 as tantamount to an admission of his rights over Bahrain and that he was anxious to establish authority over the Islands either by sending a Governor to Bahrain or by recognising the Thaikh as his representative, but that he wished the Maritime police to remain in the hands of the British &amp;&amp;xji *exiubki&amp; Naval authorities. An aswer was prepared, but not delivered, as the Shah did not revert to the subject. It was to the effect that H.l£ f s. Government did not concur in Mx&amp;l H.M. the Shah f s interpretation of the communication of 1869, on the contrary they considered Bahrain to be in- -dependent. 48. In 1888 an intrigue by certain Persian officials with the Nhaiich of Qatar, which place now had no connection with Bahrain, was supposed to contain danger to the in* Islands and two warships were stationed at Bahrain with instructions to prevent by force, if necessary, any hostile attampt to land by the Turks, Persians or Arabs. 49. In 1892 a document similar to that of 1880 was signed by the Shaikh of Bahrain with an additional provis- -ion against the cession by the Shaikh of territory to Foreign Governments. In this document the Shaikh under- -took on no account to enter into any agreement or corres- -pondence with any power other than the British Government, not to consent, wxcept with the concurrence of the British Government, to the residence within his territory of the Agent of any other Government. And on no account to cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation any part of his territory save to the British Government. 50. NBe reign of Shaikh Isa was disturbed during a number of years by the ambitious projects of the 'orte and the 1ormation of a Turkish province upon the adjoining mainland of Hasa. Bahrain was however protected by the British66 British Government against the danger of annexation. At tines, further claims by tiie r i‘urics ware maue, and in January 18C3 the local 'rurkish Governor of Q,atif proclaimed vhat Bahiain and Oman h&amp;ci. reverted to Ottoman juricdic'..ion and ’ur^ich ila^^s were forced on tlie- owners of Bahrain coats. In August of the some year, in a formal notification by the same official, it was stated that the British Government hud no connection with Bahrain, which was a part of the 'urkish Brapire and would in future be treated as such. Jhis notice was posted up in the bazaars. On representation the notice was withdrawn, but the Turkish f oveimaent refused the right of the British authorities to protect Bahrain subjects at Basrah or on Turkish soil. Ijl iBSb the British Government intervened forcib ly to prevent an invasion from *^atar and attacked the tribei uc ^ubarah on the rauinland, who were supported by ^uncish officers. The Turkish Govermaent protested, but the British Govermaent replied that it did not recognise Turk- -ish jurisdiction on the Coast of qatar. From this aate forward, though ; ruriiish claims persisted, no actual feui* of annexation occurred. In tiie Constantinople Boiird of Health pro- -posed to ea tablish a sanitary poet in Bahrain, but the proposal was abandoned on the abatement by the British dele -gate that Bahrain was under British protection. In 1898, the -orte proffessing that they had heam tiiat a British Vice-Consul had been appointed to Bahrain, requested JI.W’s. Government to apply to them for an exequtu; a request which naturally was not considered. L4 * In -ke orte were again informed that Bahrain was under British protection. At this time our relatione with Thaikli Isa were very strained and in 1906 rumours not aevoid of foundation were current that the Shaikh desired t place himself under the protection of rT 1 urkey.59. II. In the mc&amp;jntime the ercian Government hah con- -tinued to preac their claim to the ItlandH. In 1899 our Minister informed the Persian Governnent that since 188G the r&gt;haikh of Bahrain had heen precluded by treaty from holding direct relations ^ith foreign powers, and that his subjects were under British protection. 56. In 1905 the Persian Government refused to conoids Bahrain subjects residing in Persia aa being under British protection . In February 1906 the Legation informed the Persian Government that they maintained the British right d to exercise good offices on behalf of Bahrainis and declare the Persian claim to be entirely inadmissible. ^hey statS that the Island was under British protection and that the Ottoman Government v;ho had on several occasions advanced a claim to Bahrain had invariably received this reply. On this the Gxancl Vizier again riased the question and referr- -ed to Captain Bruce’s agreement of 1822. In re;ly it was pointed out that the agreement in question, so far froic having been ratified, had been expressly repudiated by the British Government, and that the Shah hiid also withheld hie approval, and had censured the 'ersian Governor of Shiraz for entering into such an agreement without his authority. ~ 7, Thus, though both hirkey and Persia had been in formed by the British Government that Bahrain was under Bahrain protection, neither of them had up to 1914, when war broice out, waived their claims to that place. cd * in 13^0 the olitical Agent, Bahrain, reported that two Persian merchants were issuing parses for travel to Persian subjects in Bahrain, while the ersian officials in Persian ports were taxing Ls. 100 . occur!ty from Persian travellers to ensure that their passports wxxs on return v/ere vised by Abdul ITabi itazeruni, a Persian merchant residing at lianameh. the capital of Bahrain. The matter was reported to '/ehran, but the Foreig: Office decided that it was undesirable to raise the questio: by a protest to Tehran.21 . 59. Presumably the custon^ continued until 1913, for in that year the Political Agent again reported the incid ent, but brought successful pressure to bear on the mer- -chant to make him discontinue this practice. Reports show that in 1914 two other merchants were viseing pusses, but the signature of any known merchant or the Political Agent were accepted. 60. The German firm of Woncknaus had been established at Bahrain since 1901, and in 1909 the German Hamburg Amerika Agent appeared desirous of supporting the Turkish claim, for ships of that line hoisted the Turkish flag while lying in harbour. On the Political Agent taking up the question the practice was stopped. In 1913 Bin r&gt;aud captured Hasa, and with this and the Great War, Turkey faded out of the picture. 61 • During the war Bin Sauci established a commercial forwarding agent at Bahrain, and he began to take some in- -terest in Bahrain affairs. During the war period there was nothing to not- -ice. At its termination, however. Bin Baud began to take more interest in Bahrain, and he encouraged the Dowas? tribe in its contumacy by offering them sanctuary in Hasa. The Political Agent reported 'Bin S ud is 'seeking to interfere in Bahrain affairs, and it is to his 'advantage that inefficient administration should continue, '■so as to enable him to make secret alliances with independ -ent factions such as the Dowasir.' When this tribe finally left Bahrain in 1923 they wA** given shelter by Bin Baud in Dammam in Hasa. 62. In 1922 the Persian question again arose over the matter of passports. In June of that year the British Consul at Bandar Abbas reported that the Persian passport officials at Lingah, the port at which the British India ships call from Bahrain, had ruled that Bahrainis were Persian subjects and should be given Persian passports. TheyThey seized two British certificates of identity issued to Bahrain subjects, but on representation orders were issued from Tehran to Lingah that this action was not to occur again. In 1923 the Persian Government instructed its s officials in the Gulf to treat Bahrainis as Persian subject and the Persian Consul at Kejef issued a notice to the effect that Bahrainis should register at the Consulate as Persians. In the previous year, 1922, a Postal Conference was held at Bushire, and the Persian delegate, while not for the moment pressing for the Bahrain Post Office, intim- -ated that his attitude was without prejudice to Persian claims on Bahrain. At the same time a press campaign was started in the Persian papers, demanding the return of Bahrain to Persia. 63. In 1922 the Foreign Office in Condon begun to * v take a strong line regarding the conditions prevailing in the Government at Bahrain and on the 7th December of that year addressed the Government of India in the following terras ,J I am to express he earnest hope that ste^s may 'be taken forthwith for the introduction at Cahram of 'reforms tending to ensure the equitable treatment of Shiahs.' Colonel Knox, the Acting Resident, protested against action being pressed too strongly. 64. In replying to the Secretary of State the Covern- -ment of India in their telegram ho. 634-^ ., dated the 14th May 1923, stated 'Knox overlooks the fact that the Foreign Office 'consider the time has come to face the direct issue 'with Persia and that should Persia appeal to the League 'of Nations misrule would be the only serious flaw in 'our case. Publicity is a new factor that cannot be ignored.23 “ignored. Developments are likely to have an unsettl- “ring effect on Bin Gaud. Prompt action in Bahrain is 'imperative, and Knox should he given authority to take “it at his discretion Wc desire only tp put ‘ourselves right in the eyes of Bahrain and the workd.’* first pressing these reforms, the Government of India stated “Nothing should be done to encourage 'the idea that the Shaikh is introducing the reforms at Government dictation. t ' • ?he question of these reforms and our interfer- —cnce internal affairs is dealt with in my accompanying despatch No. 295-S., of today’s date. 6?• The international aspect of the case is then that Persia, depending upon her possession of Bahrain up to 1783, on the agreement of Captain Bruce in 1822, ana on our communication to her in 1869, maintains her/ claims to Bahrain, notwithstanding the Muscat and Wahabi possession which intervened and the long subsequent independence of the ohailchs. It is doubtful whether she today has any knowledge of the fact that on three occasions, in 1791, in 1838 and in 1859 she temporarily assumed protection of Bahrain, though for so short a time that no real claim coulc, uc based upon it. In the third case the ciroum— -stances would only count against her. However, in foreign Office No. T - 14±12/235/378, dated 3lst December 1926, addressed to the Under Secretary of State, India, it is stated “On political grounds it is of great importance to av ajjj. xc oion which would result in the re—awakening *of the controversy as to the sovereignty of Bahrain.” 68 ‘ 1922, however, we stated, as quoted above, th^s Jolonel Knox was unaware that we were ready to meet the ersian claim, and even to put it before the League of Nations. Thus it is obvious that it is only our other commitments with Persia which made it undesirable public- -ally to meet the question in 1926. 69.72. 24. • : g* 69. But the real danger is not from Pereia, since if the point was forced on us we should hve no hesitation and no difficulty in disposing of her very iilusionary claims. But the resulting investigation would show the weakness of our gladttBM own position in Bahrain, based as it is upon the continued consent of the Shaikh. Our treaties give us no right to our present domination, a point mentioned by Shaikh Isa in his petition to Government, and which would certainly come out before the international tribunal. All that we could prove would be the independence of Bah- -rain and our protection based on custom and consent, but Should Shaikh Hamad desire it, or should Shaikh Isa inter- -vene, any international tribunal would limit our powers of action in the Islands. Except so far as dependant upon the good will of the Shaiidi our past protection would give us internationally no ground for maintaining our position in the future. 70. Indeed this point we ourselves have brought out in communication to the sublime Porte, which we now desire to repeat to Bin Baud. (Vide paragraph b of letter No. E - 2585/119/91, dated Foreign Office, 7th July 1927, to the Under Secretary of State for India, forwarded to me under your No. 402-N., dated 17th August 1927). In that communication we stated that as regards Bahrain and the Trucial Chiefs of Oman, British rights in the Persian Gulf relied not merely on the agreements con- -cluded and transmitted at that time to the Ottoman Govern- -ment, but on the custom, consent and long-established relations between the local Chiefs and the Government of India. 71. Persia is then not the real danger except in so far as she would expose the weakness of our position. The future danger to our policy lies in the growth of the Wahabi power and its extension to the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf.25 72. In this reference I will a^ain quote irom Percy Cox’b remarks at the C e ntral Asian Society on 27th October las;t, which I quoted in a previous despatch. He said with regard to Bin Saud 'I have discussed his axabitions with him many w timeB. It may be of interest if I tell you briefly M what they are. Practically he thinks that he is 'justified in principle in regaining any territory that 'his forefathers had a century ago, whether as territory 'or as a sphere of influence. Oman was in their sphere of influence 'In ray time before the war we had intimate relat- 'iono with Ibn Baud: we had a treaty with him under 4 'which we paid him a subsidy, and it was part of the 'agreement that he should not attack or molest any 'friends of ours or any Chiefs who were in treaty 'relations with us... but he quite realised we 'could not go on paying this for ever. But what he 'felt was this - Up to now I have been under specific 'obligation not to annoy the British Government by any 'policy that I pursue but now they have felt 'obliged to stop any payment to me, I think I am entit- '-led to pursue my own policy and work out ray des Un$ 'as I think best. - He is now doing that. Up to now 'he has been extraordinarily correct and statesmanlike 'in all that he has done. We have never been able 'to put him in the wrong I have little doubt that 'in the course of time he will seek to extend his author u iity over the interior of Oman.' 73. The subject on which Sir Percy Cox was speaking was Oman, but if Oman were under Wahabi influence, Bahrain was under Wahabi control, and it would be difficult to say in which place our position was strongest or more important 74. Here we have from the fountain head a statement of Bin Baud*s projects on the shores of Arabia. Let us see how his action bears out Cir Percy Cox’s statements. In26. Treaty with Bin Baud. In 1927 we aitempted to include a section in the reaty with the following wording f is majesty the i£ing of the Kedjaz and Sultan of &lt; am. its dependencies undertakes as his fathers did beiore him, to refrain from all aggression or interfer- '-ence with the territories of Kuwait. Bahrain ancTthe ' haikhs of Katar and the Oman Coast, who are under the “protection of the Government of His Briumnic majesty, “and who have treaty relations with the said Government.' nith the exception that no reference is raade to the question of determining the limits of the territories mentioned, this article repeats the provisions/ of Art. 6 of the Treaty which we had made with him in 1916. ' HU d now found it inconsistent with his dignity as an independent ruler to accept the phrase 'to refrain from all aggression xkk or interference' more particularly because the word interference seemed to him capable of too wide an interpretation (vide lir. Consul Jordan's despatch E 477/119/91. dated 26th January 1927). lie has now asked us for the terms of our treaties which he knows leaves the rulers in question independent, though they may not hold communication with foreign Powers. But they do hold coiamunication with Ibn Saud. 76 ‘ 1 then an alarmist when 1 consider that with the growth and advance of ,the Wahabi power, with the activ- -ity reported by the Political Agent vide, paragraph 61, ' j. „{; ' e absorption of the principalities foreshadowed as possible in paragraph 8 of foreign Office letter lie. 1 6118/180/91. dated November 3rd 1926, we have food for thought ? In 1870 liihdat Pasha Wall of Baghdad fonaulated a aexlnite claim to Bahrain as appertaining to the $aim Maqamteq of Nejd.and geographically it belongs to Qatar and Hasa.27. We have found that the growth of nationalist spitit in China, in Persia and the Kast generally, has produced new circumstances which we have had, at any rate partially, to accept. Would not the growth of a nation- -alist Arab and Islamic spirit make our position in Bahrain a matter of considerable difficulty, if that position were left in its present undefined condition 7 77. Uy more definite suggestions in this reference I make in my accompanying despatch on our position with regard to internal affairs in Bahrain.

Trom The Hon’ble Lieut-Colonel L.B.H.Haworth, Political Heaident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire To :he Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. Sir, In my acooapanying despatch Ho. 294-S., dated today. I have dealt at length with the history of Bahrain, the growth of our political interest in it and internation- -al claims with reference to the archipelago. I now propose to deal with the development of our concern in the purely internal affairs of the island up to the present day. xhis Interest may be said to date from 1877: I quote extensively from Lorimer. In 1869 we had installed Shaikh Isa as ruler of tne island and it was entirely, and only, due to our support that he had been able to keep his position. Since the year mentioned the British Government consiaered that they were bound 'to prevent grave outrage or oppression by the ruler, or at any rate not to remain unconcerned spectatirs of such acts of violence, but rather use their influence to repress them'. in consequence the 7 esia ent was authorised to convey to Shaikh Isa and to his brother Shaikh Ahmad, who was his chief adviser and had a stronger character than the Shaikh the emphatic disa.pror -al of Government at an act which the latter had committee in killing a first cousin of the Shaikh and to convey •2 © warning against such conduct in the future. ' N -—^ The above statements are xxlc the key to ail future developments in Bahrain. fTcm 1877 to 1900 we were chiefly concerned with external matters though attempting with our advice to 1m- -prove internal conditions. At this time the financial condition of the State seems to have given us most concern and we were attempting to improve the customs system which had much leakage. Up to 1879 the Assistant Resident in Bushire occasionally spent some time on the Islands, but in 1900, as will be seen in the body of the report, an uncovenanted official was appointed to reside on the Island. By this time lord Curzon was Viceroy and it is probable his inter- -est in the Gulf and Persian affairs focussed our attent- -ion on matters connected with it. In 1905. on his visit to Bahrain. Lord Curzon considered that an officer of the Political Service would have more influence with the Shaikl and accordingly one was appointed in 1904. From this date our interest in internal matters increased. During tUfT flve - /ears of the war no action was taken, but in 1919, probably owing to the treatment of the Shiahs having pro- -voked a protest in ehran, our immediate interest in the misrule of the State became very much greater and on our finding Shaikh Isa entirely obstructive he was removed froa active control, his son Hamad acting as his Deputy. With this short summary I will come to details. In 1880 the Shaikh entered into closer relations with the British by a 'Treaty in which was included a pro- -vision by which he agreed to have no negotiations with foreign Counties, and in 1892 he made a further and more extended treaty in which he stated he would cede no territory to foreign countries. he protection given by Great Britain to Bahrain resulted in a considerable increase of material prosperity and our interest, our influence being more and more powerful.powerful, was turned to internal improvement anu reforms, and to precautions against political competition on the part of ' uropean Powers. 5. In 1899 differences came to light between f haihh Isa and his nephew, Ali bin Ahmad, son of the Shaikh Ahmad mentioned in paragraph 2, and supplied a possible explanut- -ion for the anxiety which Shaikh Isa had displayed zo have his son Hamad recognised by the British Government as his heir. Sanction to this recognition, and it is illumin- -ating that such sanction was considered by the Shaikh necessary, was granted in 1898 but it was not actually openly announced until 1901, owing to the obstruction by the Shaikh to the reform of his customs, from which he was not receiving the value he should have received, the pro- •fits going mainly to the customs farmers. 6. In 1899 the British Government offered to lend the Shaikh a British customs official but he declined the offer, the reason being apparently that he considered his dignity and independence would be compromised. In the same year, in violation of a promise that he would not extend the current customs contract without reference to the British Resident, Shaikh Isa granted a new lease for two years and enhanced the general rate of duty from 4 to 5 per cent, without giving previous notice to the British authorities. 7. It was felt that the time had come to replace the Indian Agent, who had existed since 1829, by an Euro- -pean officer, and in January 1900 an uncovenanted officer of the Bushire Residency was appointed. In earlier days An Assistant Resident from Bushire had been sent occasion- -ally to reside in the Island. 6. The question of the customs was allowed to rest until Lord Curzon’s visit to the Persian Gulf in 1905 when it formed the chief subject of discussion between His Excellency4 XdM&amp;iSfiilMM/feMi Forcellency the Viceroy and the Shaikh. x)rd Curzon pressed the Custoios reforms on the Shaikh hut the latter maintained that it was a matter which concerned himself and there is little doubt that he considered the matter as affecting his independence. Lord Curzon however gave him a final warning that the matter could not, and would not, be dropped. It may be stated that in 1901 Sir N. O’Connor had recommended the appointment of a British Director of Customs as a measure which would appear to the Turks a material proof of British authority in Bahrain. To coerce Shaikh Isa into acceptance of reforms would have been easy but it was thought better that he should consent of his own will. In 1904, after the failure of various attempts - induce the Shaikh to agree to a reform^ of his customs administration, a further enhancement of the status of the British representative in the Islands was approved of, and in October 1904 a Political Resident was appointed from the cadre of the Indian Political Depart ment. Lord Curson had felt, while at Bahrain, that an uncovenanted officer, hailing from India, did not carry the necessary weight with the POiaikh of Bahrain and it was hoped that a British officer would obtain more influence. 10. Shaikh Isa’s conduct, however, left much to be desired, and he seemed more concerned with preserving his independence from us, than with conciliating us, by whom only his independence could be maintained. II-• -n liovember 1904 a riot had occurred in which the bodyguard of the Shaikh’s nephew Ali attacked the Persians resident in the bazaar at iianameh, the capital of the Islands. Captain '^ideaux, the new Political Agent, interviewed the Shaikh in the matter, but the Shaikh, on ihe ground that the Persians were Mohammedans, declined to admit his interference, and expressed his intention of the senaing case to Shara. Ultimately the matter was keptb kept pending until the arrival of the Resident. In the meantime the Persian sufferers had telegraphed to the Shah and had been informed in reply that the British Government would take action on their behalf. An undesirable incident in which a German was assaulted occurred about the same tine in which no redress could be obtained. On 21st January 1905 the Viceroy despatched a message to the Secretary of State from which the following is an extract M The incidents reported appear in our opinion 'to warrant and necessitate vigorous measures with 'Shaikh* who is only encouraged in his obstinacy by our 'continued forbearance. 'His obstinate attitude in regard to proposed 'Customs reforms was explained in our despatch of 21st A 'April 1904 and apart from tills present case he lias 'shown a disposition to ignore the advice of our new 'Political Agent. The appeals for our assistance rec- '-eived from subjects of the German and Persian Govern- '-ments seem to minimise xiqc grounds for any internation H -al objection* and makes the present opportunity favour -able for proclaiming our protectorate.' * 13. The Resident, Major Cox, spent four aays discuss- -ing the case of the Persians, but without result, the Shaikh maintaining that ’'ersians were under his juris- -diction and that the case must be tried by the Bahrain Courts. The status of the Persians as foreigners resident upon an Island under British protection together with the certainty of injustice being perpetrated should the case be made over to a £unni tribunal forbbde any concession on this point. Deadlock ensued and Major Cox left the Islan on 10th December to report the situation to Government. On the 23rd February 1905 he returned to Bahrain as the bearer6 ■■■■ PKW bearer of demands authorised by His Majesty’s Government upon Shaikh Isa. He had been empowered to enforce com- -pliance with the same by naval force if necessary and the British cruiser H.M.S. • 1 FCx ,, and the gunboats H.M.S. “Redbreast” and H.M.S. “Sphinx” were assembled in the harbour. An ultimatum was delivered to the Shaikh from which the following is an extract of the orders received from Government “Demands should be prefaced by a reference to “the long continued support accorded to the rulers of “Bahrain and to the present Shaikh by the British Govern- '•-ment, who caused the usurper to be axpelled, himself to ”be installed and the succession of his son to be recognised.” 8 'The Shaikh should be reminded of his assurance ”to follow the advice of the Political Resident.' 14. Government in their memorandum of demands direct- -ed the Resident to state. 'You have not maintained your friendship ra&amp;k 'towards the British Government and have conducted your- '-self in a manner which cannot be permitted to 'continue. In the event of any continuance of repetlt- ”-ion of an unfriendly attitude, ail support and assist- '-ance, whether diplomatic or military, which you, or 'your predecessors, have enjoyed will be withdrawn from you, and may possibly take another direction.' A warning was conveyed to Hamad, the heir appar ent, whose attitude throughout the crisis had been as little satisfactory as his father’s, that the ultimate recognition of his claims by the Government of India would depend upon his future conduct. lb- In his Ho. 12b, dated 11th March 190b, Major Cox stated that he regarded it as a /oatter of considerable regret that the exigencies of Imperial politics did not admit o£ our making our moral protectorate into an open and effective7 effective one at the present juncture. In a later lett- -er he stated that he baoed A su^gestion he hi*d raaae on the facts that 1. The ?riiae Minister in a speech had referred to Bahrain as a British Protectorate. 2. On the 21st January 190b the Government of India had expressed the opinion to the Secretary of Ptate that the present opportunity seemed particular- -ly favourable for proclaiming a protectorate. 3. On the 22nd February 1905 His i&amp;ijesty^ Uinister for Foreign Affairs intimated to the Turkish Ambassador that it was a matter of common knowledge that the Island of Bahrain and its natives were under British protection. 4. On the 12th August 189b, the British Ambasa- -ador had informed the hrte that all Turkish claiiis to Bahrain, which was under the protection of the queen of Kngland, were totally inadmissible. 16. iilajor Cox had in his letter stated:- M I do not see how we can expect anything but 'periodical trouble from a continuation of our laudable 'endeavour to carry on the Government of the Islands 'through the rule of a Chief who has shown himself to ^possess few, if any, of the qualifications necessary 'for the maintenance of order, the security of the persons and of trade ' His Majesty’s Government did not accept Major Cox’s suggestion but resolved to follow a more cautious policy. It was decided that for the time being the activity of the British Political authorities should be confined to the direction and control of the i haikh’s external relations and that the amelioration of the in- -fcernal Government should be sought by indirect and pacific means and by gaining the confidence and trust of the Shaiich 17.17. ^he position and influence of Great Britain were, however, so Loriraer states, undoubtedly consolidated by the crisis of 1904-1905 and the relations of the Chaikh v/ith the British Political Agent improved, though the former still regarded offers of advice as attempts to undermine his authority. Trade increased by over 50 per cent, but no progress was made in the matter of customs reform. But it was felt that some features of the intem- -al adminiati'ation were not credi(j^le to the 'protecting British power' - I quote from Larimer. The slave trade still flourished and slaves were freely imported from C,atar and Has a. Oppression of sub- -jects was rife not only by the ShaiJdi and members of the A1 Khalifeh,:£HJEbt}c the ruling family, but also by petty magistrates, and revenue authorities and specially by the Qazis, who grossly abused their functions. The chief sufferers were the aboriginal cultivating population called the Bahama, Shiahs by religion, who lived in a condition of virtual serfage and were liable to forced labour and similar hardships. In 1905 the Political Agent was authorised to manumit slaves in suitable and deserving cases. 18. In 1906 rumours were current which were not dev -void of foundation, that the Shaikh desired to place him- -self under the protection of ,71 urkey; but in 1909 we were apparently sufficiently pleased with him to raise his salute of guns to eleven. 19. On the 14th September 1905 however the Government of India had laid down their idea of their position via a vis Bahrain: They wrote to the Secretary of State that 'Great Britain is the protecting power of Bahrain and Bahrain is therefore under the protection of Great Britain in the following sense.' i. Ike British Governmeht and they alone, as distinct from Persia, Turkey or an^ other Power, controlthe Foreign relations of Bahrain. The Shaikh has bound himself not to enter into relations with any other ^ower. 'he British Government therefore undertake the protection of foreigners. ii. The reciprocal aspect of this obligation is that Great Britain is bound to protect the Islands from any external aggression or assault. iii. It results that British influence and authority are and must be in the ascendant in Bahrain: his influence is political both in character and origin and it gives Great Britain the right to claim that in ?uiy matter to which she attached high importance heYadvice jd must be followed. The acceptance of this advice is the return paid by the State for the advantages which British protect -ion confers. 'he British rights were explicitly seated in the ultimatum presented to the Shaikh on the 24th February 1906. If British advice must be accepted action in contravention of it, whether it takes the form of vacillation, bad faith or open contumacy, cannot be tolerated. IV. British paramountcy is commercial as well as political. 20. After the event of 1904-1906 the Political Agent though not directly empowered by an Order in Council, assumed jurisdiction over foreigners (An Order in Council to rectify this was introduced in 1919). 1 Shaikh Isa though he agreed to the right of protection in the case of other foreigners maintained his own right over Kejdis. In 1917 the 'olitical Agent suggested we might lall in with this view of the Ohalkh as a graceful concess- -ion and this appears to have been acted on unofficially up to 1920. 21• Txcept as above the internal affairs of Bahrain do not appear to have attracted much attention until the end of the Great War. 'he10 . The Political .A&amp;eut found himHelf powerleua to prevent many groeu tyrannieo whiori were being perpetrated but used his influence as far as he could to prevent eer- -tain abuses. In 1908 the Political Agent attempted to improve trade conditions and in 1910 he reported that the utmost patience had been exercised in order to &gt;feet the Shaikh to agree without coercion to some compromise to meet the requirements of traders with regal'd to landing drrangemento which he leased as a monopoly. 22. In 1911 the Political Resident again gave a gloomy picture of the condition of the Bahrain principality due to the incompetence of Shaikh Isa. He said that all progress was hampered by the bigoted incapacity of the Shaikh, to which wua to be added the nationalist sentiment which had agitated Islam during the past two or three years. He was of the opinion that Government would have to interfere in the interests of our shipping. In 1912 the Government of India called upon the Shaikh to form a suitable scheme for the landing of cargo, a reform which was suitably carried through. 23. On the outbreak of war the attitude of the Ghaikh and his two sons was friendly but the inhabitants of BahraJa were, perhaps naturally, affected by their Islamic sentlmexr The arrest of Wonckliau8 , Agent and the capture of Basrah had a quieting effect. During the war internal affairs necessarily received little attention. In iSigx 1912 Bhaikh Isa agreed to the erection of a wireless station in Bahrain, and in 1916 on the departure of the Shaikh’s quarantine officer on leave we took over the quarantine duties of the place, a duty which we have continued to perform. In 1916 Shaikh Isa was invested with the C.3.I. and in 1919 with the K.C.I.E. 24.11 tin) 24 • May 1919 Captain Sray, who had been for six months 'olitical Agent, accompanied Shaikh Isa’s second son, Shaikh Abdulla, to England. Captain Bray considered that there was some anti- -British feeling in Bahrain, that there was no British party, arid he considered the activities of the Amricaii Missionaries to be anti-British. While this is not the case directly, indirectly it must necessarily be so. 25. Captain Bray, the first of a series of officers from Iraq, was very much in favour of an up to date Bah- -rain, with water works, electric power, industrial schools button manfactures etc., etc. The Deputy Resident, Hr. Bill, was not however in favour of these improvements, preferring rather to leave the Arab to develop slowly than to inculcate in him a divine discontent. 26. Dix months later Hajior Dickson reported: i. ' ) olitical situation wholly unsatisfactory. ii. strong long standing and deepoeated anti British sentiment. ill. British prestige rests on fear and not on respect. he also statec: that Thaikh Isa was a very old and weak man with sincere feelings of friendship for His Majesty’s Government but easily swayed and confused in his judgment by astute minds and intrigues dictated for the most part by intentions evil to him and to us. It is amusing to note that as far back as 1698-99 Colonel Meade referred to Shaikh Isa as a very old man with a weak character. About the same time Government interfered in a difference between Shaikh Isa and Ibn Gaud regarding the duties to be charged on goods proceeding to Hasa. Shaikh Isa was compelled to accept a 2 per cent, duty much to his chagrin as he considered Government had favoured Ibn Baud at his expense. In12 . 27. In the meantime ShaiJch Abdulla haa via fled -land and had an interview with :;ir Arthur Hertael which was illuminating with regard to the ShaiJth'a feelings. Shaiich Abdulla aeked that !• r&gt;haikh Isa should be jjut on an equality with neighbouring Arab rulers in the exercise of authority over all persons except subjects of Great Britain ana the Grtat European powers (i.e. Nejdis and Persians etc.) ii. Shaikh Isa should be empowered to select the Bench of * agistrates. iii. Shaikh Isa should be given a port at Zubarah in .a tar. iv. shaikh Isa should be given permission to corres- -pond direct with London. - need no:, dilate on the last two points. The first two were part of the sentiment for which Shaikh Isa had been fighting throughout, that is to say his pride of position with his fellow Arabs and his idea of independence 28 • During 1920 the question of jurisdiction over hejdis and the people of Hasa hau cused some friction betwe -ween Shaikh Isa and the Political Agent. On the Lth May 1920 the Secretary of State for India informed : haikh Abdulla by letter through the usual sources that with reference to his first demand of the previous year, quoted above, the Government agreed that the Shaikh of Bahrain should exercise jurisdiction over the subjects of other Atoar Rulers provided that the Rulers themselves concurred, but on the 8th of the same month the Political Agent had already stated that Bin Baud objected t the Shaikh controlling his subjects and in July reported that Bin Baud haa in writing requested him to exercise the jurisdiction in question. The Shaikh of Qatar sent a similar request. Hie Political Agent accordingly issued a notice on the 26th November 1920 that all foreign subjects, includ -inf. ersjians and subjects of Arab Rulers and Cniefa other than those of Bahrain are, while residing in Eahrain e)ui1 ie13 entitled to the protection of His -‘*aje8^y f 8 Govei’nment. Thus jurisdiction over all foreigners parsed to the Pol- -itical Agent. The situation naturally caused friction with Fhaikh Isa and left him smarting. 29. In 1921 Major Laly, who had succeeded as Polit- -ical Agent, summed up the situation in Bahrain in the following terms. H £’haiich Isa’s wife ho las a regular court and ’’imprisons and punishes at her will with a total dis- '-regard of the most elementary laws of even Arab 'justice. The Salifeh diving court has degenerated 'into a single venal judge owing to BhaiJkh Isa having 'become deeply indebted to Hashid bin l&gt;ohaiina M a disturbing element is the rapid increase of the 'family of A1 Khalifeh. There is no outlet for the 'many younger members and no attempt is made to educate them for any occupation.' Major Daly had previously reported the gross oppression practiced on the Shiahs by the Al shalifeh and especially by Thaikh Abdulla bin Isa, who had his father’s and mother’s complete confidence and consequently ruled Bahrain. 30. In 1921 the rising discontent frightened Shaikh Abdulla, and Shaikh Isa appointed his heir, Shaikhliamad, to take over the control of affairs under his orders, but haikh Isa’s wife, the mother of Abdulla, kept such a tight hand over things that Shaikh Hamad was powerless to make any changes. In December 1921 discontent in Bahrain had reach -ed such a pitch that, as the Resident reported to the Government of India, a deputation of Bahrainis presented him with HXjant&amp;tdbsjDGBJ? an appeal against the tyranny existing. \ 31. T he Resident, Colonel Trevor, suggested that the 'olitical Agent should be authorised to intervene in jtftx cases of tyranny and to give individual protection, pending enquiry14 enquiry, when neceusury. 31. Shaikhs Hamad and Abdulla took alarm at the attitude of the people and on the nth A(bril 1922 Hajor Daly was able to report that the Shaikhs appeared anxious for si. reform as the Shiahs were becoming restive. He had warned Shaikh Isa that he could expect no assisumce in the event of disturbances. He also reported that orders had been passed for the opening of a Government office with two regular clerks for dealing with public business and that a regular court had been established for the disposal of cases. 32. On this the Government informed the Resident thal they did not desire to be drawn into interference between the Ruler of Bahrain and his subjects that noth- -ing should be done to encourage the idea tha^ reforms vjere being intruduced at Government dictation. The Political Agent reported that Hie Rhaikhs, frightened at the attituue of the Sunnis, had drawn back from their reforms and that some of the Shi^ahs were advocating open rebellion and were said to be importing arms. A week later, in July 1922, the Government of India asked the Resident whether, as the Shaikh would not act, pressure should not be applied owing to the gross in- -justice and the victimisation of Shiahs. 33. On the 7th December 1922 the foreign Office, London, informed the India Office that they desired to ex- -press their earnest hope that steps might be taxen forth- -with for the introduction at Bahrain of reforms tending to ensure the equitable treatment of Shiahs. I5y files do not show it here but I understand that Shiah pressure was being exercised through the Persian Government at Tehran. Colonel iCnox, who was acting Resident in 1923 at the time the reforms were finally put through, was not in favour of our pressing reforms on Shaikh Isa as he consider -ed the Persian challenge was directed notthere tuid that reforas would not placate Persia but would provoke the larger iesue. He pointed out in this refer- -ence that if we withdrew frora Bahrain it would not be Persia but the Wahabis who would succeed us. 34. In January 1923 Hajor Daly reported that Shaikh Isa was purely obstructive in matters to the advantage of the State and amongst them would never agree to the ex ploration for oil e&gt;cept under pressure. Colonel Trevor then reported that the state of affairs in Bahrain called for reform more urgently than ever. 35. On the 17th April 1923 the Government of India wired to London urging reforms since misrule had reached such a pitch but said M In the present temper of Islam we are anxious to use every endeavour to induce Shaikh Isa to act ostensibly in his own interest and wish to avoid overt if intimidation failing ihat/it means his enforced re- -tirement and deportation of f'haikh Abdulla we are determin -ed to carry out the feforms ourselves such action would almost certainly force the general issue of our status in Bahrain, and might produce an unfavourable re- -action on Bin Baud, but we presume His majesty’s Govem- vment are prepared to face the consequences. In reply the Secretary of State gave the required authority to convey a categorical warning to Shaikh Isa. 36. A further disturbance between some Uejdia and Persians took place in which five persons were killed, which assisted Colonel Knox when on the 15th May 1923 he crossed to Bahrain to take action. He stated Shaikh Hamad’s great fear was of Bin Baud; and he reported his own anticipation that the whole management of affairs would more and more come into the \ hands of the Political Agent. 37. On the 20th May Colonel Knox had an interview with Shaikh Isa. He told him that the Government were much16. !\%1 much much concerned at the conditiona in Bahrain ana that we were committed to a serious course of reforms and ad- -vised him to stand aside and give Shaiich Hamad a free hand. Is*. Shaikh tomad was obdurate and on the 23rd Kay Colonel Knox asked Shaikh Hamad and Shaikh Abdulla to make one last effort to induce Shaikh Isa to agree to his measures. On the 26tii May Shaikh Isa was set aside as fax as control over matters was concerned and his shn, Hamad, appointed to rule for him. -haikh Hamad though weil meaning was without experience and had the weak character of his father though perhaps without so much obstinacy. Consequently for the next four years he took no step without the help or indeed advice of the Political Agent and his complete lack of in- -itiative forced Major Daly Ante the foreground. • In June 1923 the Government of India wrote the first of their repeated warnings that, the Political Agent must be on his guard against being tempted to interfere too much and too directly in the Shaikh’s affairs or to become the administrative officer rather than the adviser. Colonel Knox pointed out that to ev/olve order out of chaos steps had to be taken, and liat both Shaikh Hamad and Major Paly were In bad odour in consequence of the reforms having been established. 39. Shaikh Isa then appealed to the High Commissioner at Baghdad. She Sunni tribes were opposed to these reforms and, in Hovember 1923, petitioned Colonel Trevor on his return to the Persian Gulf. On the other hand Shaikh Hamad and Shaikh Abdulla asked Colonel Trevor if he would permanently appoint a British Quatoms Director for Bahrain. Colonel ^revor supported their request and also recomnended the raising of a small force of Baluchis to maintain order along with aiher local reforms such as law courts, etc. Colonel.31 JazLz niui niB'ixuvfl cti aaojt-5 xi&gt;.aou slU Sb nvai3onca jfewwi -/xb 'xw* lo ^axtroa Buafcisa js bBd^icjsioo oiew sw .£)asrf fs iJiiisusH mLiaxiS &lt;ovi:&gt;j i)nja wtodLu* bna3B o*t uiixl Ijo-bIt- igaM uatti :n'£j no y^,ix»jix *'0 a&gt;^w *-«»*&gt;■«*»: ifeiuria saUiia oJ allx/MA fitiktiiV hius owurK LisLXm^M i) 5 J 3 (ys xort- ionoXoO eiii Q-j o-j nul £bL£&amp;i&amp; nmthnt of &amp;*iq‘X1$ 3q&amp; 1 sno V &gt; •- .

They asked whether an Arab from Iraq or T, 'gypt could not function as Director o^' Customs. It is unnecessary to go into the further corres- -pondence on the subject. 40. In January 1924 Hr. de Grenier Look over the appointment of Director of Customs and in the same year a corps of Baluchis was raided under a British officer and in 1926 an adviser Jifc* was appointed who deals with jud- -icial, financial and general administration. In the course of a compilation of a record of rights it came to light that Shaikh Isa had frequently sold the same plot twice to different people and had given documents for land included in the property of others. 41. Outrages against life and property now began to be common, of which two were perpetrated by Shaikh Thalid and his sons, merakers of Shaikh Isa^ family, the A1 Khalifeh. 42. On the 24th July 1924 the Foreign Secretary wrote that 'the Government of India had no desire to pro** -c*ed further or faster than they could carry the Shaikh whole heartedly with them. They think the Political Agent and the Political Resident have shown a tendency to too treat the Island an much on the xiukck lines of a Native State in India. Colonel Prideaux reported that he had obtained the impression that Shaikh Hamad whole heartedly approved of the reforms. 43.18 43. On the 13th February 192b Shaikh Isa submitted an appeal to His Excellency the Viceroy against his § deposition. In it he says “the reforms which my subjects did not want or damand anu which indeed they condemned took the form of forcing on me inadmissible demands for concessions to forei^i syndicates. 1 * He also refers to the resolutions passed by his chiefs of tribes of one was 'that the British Consul should abide by the contents of the treaty contracted between the British Government and that of Bahrain and should not meddle with internal affairs.” He concluded ”It is against the intolerable persecution to which I myself have been subjected in breach of Treaty obligations in the matter of my prerogatives as an independ -end ruler of Bahrain that I seek protection and redress at Your Ixcellency’s hands.” 44. At the beginning of Shaikh Hamad’s rule affairs in Bahrain were in chaos. Disturbances which owed their inception to the party which desired Shaikh Isa and his misrule were rife and finally an attempt was made on Shaikh Hamad’s life. 45. In 1926 the Fubedar commanding the Baluch levies was killed by one of the sepoys in the force, and Major Daly was attacked said wounaed. I consider that this in- -cident, though it hau some connection with the general un- -rest need not be considered politically. It had no Arab significance, except as a symptom of general conditions; it was not due to the causes which preceded the attempt on Shaikh Hamad’s life. The Baluch Levy Corps was however abolished and an Armed Police Corps of hnjabi Mohammedans enlisted, again under a British officer. 46. oday Bahrain is quiet. Shaikh Isa meets the Political Besiaent and the Political Agent, and he draws his19. his allowance. The Doiwasir tribe who left Bahrain are coming bacic on the conditions which we named, and we are attempting more and more to make Shaikh Hamad the obvious head of the State. 47. But it is still obvious to the world that Shaikh Hamad does what the Political Agent wants him, that he frequently does kb$ what he does not want, because the Political Agent tells him - we shouxd say advises him. A glaring example of this is the Bowasir case, in which the Bowasir and all the Island knew that Shaikh Hamad’s sympathies were with the expelled tribe, and he joined with that tribe to obtain Ibn Baud’s recomaendation to us in order to laake easier his task of obtaining their return to Bahrain. 48. In the meantime we have a British Administrator, a servant of the State, who sits with Shaikh Hamad on tri- -bunals, we have the Customs Birector ana the Chief of Police, all of whom were appointed by the British Govern- -ment, though under Shaikh Hamad’s signature. ''he British are still looked upon as the rulers, and how indeed can it be otherwise ? We make and unmake rulers, we appoint administrators and officials. very important point is referred to us - the question of landing charges, readmission of the Bowasir, arrival of foreigners, visit of the Shaikh to Qatar etc. etc. 49. Now,on reading the the history of Hie last 100 years it is not difficult to see how the present situation has come about, nor the causes of the differences which have occurred between the Shaikh and the Political Agent, the difference of outlook of Shaikh Isa and Lord Gurzon. 50. In the course of putting down piracy we were bound to take an interest in Bahrain affairs, for we could not allow the Islands to fall into the hands of a foreign power who might allow it to be a centre of disorder. In 184b we allowed the Shaikh to be ousted as we did not find him satisfactory, and he was replaced by us by another who waswas equally unsatisfactory, ana who finally fled in 1 We then recognised Shaikh Ali, who was killed by usurpers, whom we defeated and deported, and we then installed his son Isa in his place in 1869, and in 1923 we deposed Shaikh Isa and again appointed his son to rule. 51. During all this time we have protected the State from outside encroachment, and since the Shaikh was put and fcept in his place by our power we have felt some responsibility for his internal administration and have felt that common gratitude on his part must give us some rights of advice. We have however aiways publicly insisted upon his independence and he lias imbibed the idea of the fact that he is independent. 52. But with an uneducated Arab tribesman independ- -ence means the power to do many things of which we do not approve. It means administering the islands for the benefit of the Chiefs of the tribe to which he belongs, it means t as it means in many Native Btates in India - the exploiting of the people for the rulers, it means to a bigoted Sunni the treating of the Shiahs as »x people of an unprivileged class ( as we see toaay in Ibn Baud’s country, fifty miles away on the mainland), it means Jus- -tice tempered with a consideration of the position of the ruling tribes, and to a man of sixty, as i haikh Isa was when the first crisis occurred, it means an abhorrence of all new-fangled ideas. Thus the more we insisted, the more he felt his position threatened, and the more he resisted. The troub&amp;ft that came was bound to come if we desired a clean administration and elementary justice. Indeed Colonel Knox, knowing the type of aan and the civilisation with which we had to aeal, pointed out when the reforms were made that it was inevitable that the power should fall more and more into the hands of the T 'ol- -itical Agent, at any rate for some years. 53. But we have already had,in the past, our experienceexperience of trying to ¥»ork by merely advising, and tKe Government not the Political Agent, finally had to insist on threats instead of aavice. f'haiich haaad is a pleasant man but a weak one, and it is idle to pretend that he and his brothers would not backslide. He has already shown that he is very much liable to the influence of Ibn Baud, and t,o other Atax Arab influences. He has staced that he looks to Ibn Taud as the great Arab ruler whom they would all wish to please. He, in a way, likes the h r itish officers he meets but he, like every other Arab Shaikh, would gladly be rid of us all and go back to his definite Arab ways amongst his fellow Arabs. 54. The question then is what are we going to do, now that Bahrain is, however little we may desire it or have desired it, administered as a British Province, for apart from the British employees, the iuevy Corps is// entire -ly Indian and we have nearly completed a F.evenue Burvey carried out by Indian Surveyors. 55. I am separately from this despatch submitting suggestions for the reduction of the number of the British employees and we are doing all we can to induce Shaikh Hamad to accept the responsibilities of the post which he holds. 56. But the reforms we have introduced are essential^ western in/ ethics and in principle ana foreign to the 1 astern mentality of an Arab rhaikfc. To relax too much, to allow Jiaikh Harmui his way, means to go through the same grind through which we have come, and we cannot afford today, any more than in the past to let Bahrain come under the influence of any other Power, Eastern or Western. It must be remembered that only in 1906, 57 yesars after we had put Shaikh Isa on the throne, and after we alone had kept him from annexation, and not- -withstanding our treaties with him, he had ideas of accept -ing urkish nationality.22 22 (5)V b7. Bahrain ie more important to us than it ever hae been. Vhere ie ii^tie aoubt thiit with the development of Persia our strength on that coast will be weakened, it is for ub to see that it ie not weakened bj* with the Arabs as well. as a The Persian Gulf is vital to ub bk Xta point on the line from which our oil comes. Bahrain is a keypoint on the air route to India and the Bast, and without it we could not maintain a service. We cannot lose Bahrain. But notwithstanding our outwardly strong position on the Islands a single serious quarrel with Shaikhs Isa and Hamad , a quarrel engineered by Ibn Saud on religious grounds, or through Persia on political grounds, and we should have to vacate our privileged position or force ourselves on the principality in the face of the world, against the wishes of its rulers. The fact that under treaty the ruler is not allowed to correspond with foreign powers has not prevented him from bo doing in the past, and would not do so in the future. 58. In bygone days, in 1849, we did not take over Bahrain when it was offered to us by Shaikh Mohammed be- -cause of the commitments it would give us in aoministrat- -ion and defence. ! oday our position in the Islands is accepted by the Aruba, ana we have accepted the committment in adrainiotration, and we should have equally to accept the commitments for defence if Bahrain were threatened. Indeed I am separately suggesting it as a haval base and the head- -quarters of our squadron in the Persian Gulf. 59. The objections to a protectorate are purely • ^ ■ h political, they are no longer administrative. But 8haik Hamad knows that he cannot stand without us, and indeed I would say that notwithstanding his personal outlook, he is content to keep us there for that reason. His state of mind is a mixed one to be swayed either way by the course of events. At present, though turning towards Ibn Baud in his personal feelings, he looks towards us and has no desir for the rigid strictness of Wahabi rule. 60 .23 60. I would suggest then that Shaikh Hanad should be induced to approach us saying that he fears the political situation, and would be glad if we would extend to him the protection which was refused to his predecessor in 1849. With the consolidation of our position we could afford to cut down the British staff to one man and in- -sist that Shaikh Hamad should make all the show of a ruler -ship, as in an Indian State, since our position would be unassailable except by force. 61. The Protectorate thus concluded need not be pro- -claimed for the moment if it is not desireu, but it would legalise and consolidate a position which is loose and un- -certain. I cannot, personally, face with equanimity a future based on the present circumstances of world pol- -itics, especially of Pastern politics, and the conditions under which we are now tolerated in Bahrain, conditions which with the advance of the Wahabi power, might, in place of a willing subordination, become a forcible bond founded on no right, with a hostile people in open sym- -pathy with an advancing Islamic power. 62. We are losing our position in the northern coast of the Gulf; we shall equally lose it in the Southern if we allow Ibn Baud to consolidate his power on the whole Southern littoral.

With this ana our position in Bahrain for 100 years and especially our suzerain acts in Bahrain for the last 60 years (i.e. since last theoretical occupation by Persia) including imposition of present ae .1 ure and de facto rulers, Persian Government should have no case.

Again, Mr.Alison, in his letter to tnis )~fic6 Ho.25, of 26th July 1862, considered himself 'Precluded, under instructions from the foreign Office, from entering into any discussions on the subject of Bahrein with the Persian Government'• 5. The Persian foreign Minister pretends that 'the right of * Persia over the Ports of Qmman' (Omman, including the Muscat territories, and a portion of the Arab littoral known as the Pirate coast, and along which are located many independent Arab Chiefs with whom we have treaty engagements,) is a treaty stip ulation between England and Persia. If so, I must plead igno- * ranee of the fact, nor can I suppose that Government would, for an instant, acknowledge any alleged claim on the part of Persia to sovereignty over Muscat and our Arab Chiefs. 6. The Persian Foreign Minister would pretend to dread that „ l we may use force against Persian Islands. The simple reply to this is, that Persia owes the possibility of trade in the Gulf and the tranquillity of her Gulf littoral wholly to the British Maritime Police of the Gulf. Persia has not a gun afloat to pro tect her own shore, and the Arab Chiefs have, on more tuan one occasion, expostulated with me for- preventing their old sea raids, % and have frankly admitted that, if it were not for the British Resident, they would seize every Persian merchant craft and plunder the Persian sea-ports. Liy opinion, based on many years* observation and experience, is that, if we were to abandon our maritime protection of the Persian Gulf, trade in these waters would soon become impossible, and the ports on the Persian littoral! y. . J , flOl') littoral would become subjecta to hostile attack, and, perhaps fall into the hands of Arab Chiefs. 7. It is remarkable that, .vhile the Persian Foreign Minister would pretend to dread violence on our part towards Keshm and irmuz, the Persian Grovernor General of Southern Persia is in debted to me for having placed a gun-boat and the 1st Assistant /ide ioy Reports Nos.32 and 45,dated respectively Resident at 4th and 23rd April,and No.52,dated 9th May 1868. di B p 08a i f in view to enabling him to inspect those islands. His Royal Highness has, as Government are aware, expressed his thanks and satisfaction for the same. 8. I observe that the Foreign Minister incidentally refers to Vide my letters Mo.il5,of 1st December 1866,and Angaum as a No.14, of 16th January 1867. Persian island. Since the date of my letters now noted, I have not.troubled Government *vith my opinion on this Question, unless when it was especially called for by the Viceroy. But I think that His Vide Government Telegram of 5th August 1868, Excellency the and my reply of 6th idem. Governor in Council would probably wish to have his attention attracted to the present allusion to Angaum. 9. The Persian Foreign Minister asserts I gave no information of my intended movements on the Arab Coast. I submit that I am in no way accountaole to Persian authority in respect to my duties in Arabia. As a matter of fact, however, X did, in an unofficial manner and in the course of friendly conversation, inform the Prince Governor General of Pars of the Government intention to punish the Bahrein Chief. At the same time, I should not wish this unofficial circumstance to be adduced, as some inconvenience might thence, perhaps, result to His Royal Highness. 10. Government will recollect that just before proceeding to Bahrein, the danger to the Persian Coast, from the inflamed state /ide my uelegram of 19 tn August 1363. of the Arab Coast,was so imminent, that I tele- gramed to Mr.Alison on the subject, and sent copy of my telegram to India. I entertained little doubt that, had it not been for the recentrecent check given to the Arabs, a descent on the Persian ports even to discuss, Persia^ pretensions to sovereignty over Bahrein or Omm&amp;n; and 2ndly.- Government will, perhaps, concur with me in considering that, under all the circumstances of the case, a letter of thanks ior maritime protection would have been at once more reasonable ana appropriate than is the present protest on the part of the I have the nonor to enclose copy of a protest received from the Persian Foreign Agent, Shiraz, concerning certain punishment which Her Majesty's Indian Government have deemed proper to inflict on the Chief of Bahrein* 2. I find tnat, under date 13th February 1861, Her Majesty^ Secretary of State for India ruled as follows!-'Bahrein should be regarded as Independent', and as subject neither to Turkey nor to with the above policy, as stated in your letter 3STo*25, of 26th July 1862, that you were 'precluded, under instructions from the Foreign with th&gt;3 Persian Government'♦ * 4* I have, therefore, sent no reply to the Foreign Agent at Shiraz,nor am I able to acknowledge the interference of any Persian authority with ray duties on the Arab littoral. 5* For *your Hxcellency*s own information it is agreeable to me to had taken place* 11.

The British Government readily admit that the Government of the Shah has protested against the Persian right of sovereignty over Bahrein being ignored by the British author!tea, and they have given due consideration to that r^-otest. But it is the fact, as yourself and the Government of the are undoubtedly aware,that the sheikhs of Banrein have, at different periods,entered directly into engagements with the British Government; und I beg to assure you that the British Government hold the Sheikh to these engagements solely for tne purposei of preventing piracy and slave trade and of maintaining the Police of tne Gulf. If the Persian Government are prepared to keep a sufficient force in the Gulf for these purposes,this country would be relieved of a troublesome and costly duty, but if the Shah is not prepared to undertake these duties,Her Majesty's Government cannot suppose His Ma jesty would wish that in those waters disorder and crimes should be er~ couraged by impunity.I need scarcely assure you of the friendly feelings entertained hy Her Majesty’s Government towards Persia* and their desire on all occasions to meet as far as possible the wishes of the Shah* and in regard to this question I have the honor to state to you that*whenever it is practicable to do so, Her Majesty’s Government will cause the Persian Government to be informed beforehand of any measures of coercion against himself which the conduct of the Sheikh of Bahrein ija^ have rendered necessary. But the British Government cannot consent to debar its officers* to whom the superintendence of the Police of th« Persian Gulf is entrusted, from the exercise of the right of punish ing* by prompt measures* the Sheikh of Bahrain* on occasions when a reference to the Court of Teheran would be attended with emoarrassing delays which might endanger the general peace of the Gulf, but when ever such a necessity shall arise a fuil cormiiuniccition respecting it shall be made to the Persian Government.

I duly referred to ray Govern ment your note of the November,containing a formal protest against the terms of Article 6 of the treaty of Jed ia concluded on the 20th ay 1927 between His Dritannic 1 ajesty and His ajesty the King of the hejaz and of nejd and its Dependencies, on the ground that the reference tn that article to the Islands of Bahrein is contrary to the territorial integrity of Persia. In reply I am instructed to inform Your Excellency that His Majesty’s Government are not aware of any valid grounds upon which the claim of the Persian Government to sovereignty over these islands is or can be based. Geographically the islands are not a part of Persia nor are the inhabitants of Persian race. Kis -ajesty*s Government therefore presume that the Persian Government can only refer to the fact that during certain periods pierious to the year 1783 Bahrein was overrun and occupied by Persian troops or by the followers of certain chiefs from the eastern shores of the Persian Gulf; but it is clearly impossible to attach serious importance to a claim founded on such remote historical events. . The ? L ' 1The Persian Government are under a complete misapprehension if they suppose that His ajesty’s Government, either in 1869 or at any other time, intended to recognise that Banrein was a part ofPersia. On the contrary, they have consistently endeavoured to secure that the peaceful development of the islands and the welfare of the Arab inhabitants shall not be disturbed by unjustified attempts on the part of tneir neighbours to subject them to a foreign domination, A copy of this note is being sent to the Secretary General of the Leajue of Lations,as — maam i P. 5563/27.

Hie criticisms we have to offer have probably already been met by you as the result of the further investigation of the question to #iich you refer in your letter* but I send them for what they are worth. e are in cotsplete agreement with the Foreign Office as to the attitude to be adopted towards the claim, and were this merely a matter between His f’ajesty’s Government and ersia, and were there no question of the League of Nations, we should have little to criticise in the terns of your draft. But in view of the fact that the Persians have referred the matter to the League, and that we propose equally to send the Lavoie a copy of our reply, we are inclined to L. Gliehant, .an., C.; *G., FoiSl® OFFICE, 3.^. 1.to feol here, not only generally that wo should do well to state our case in rather fiacre detail, but, in particular, that it is for consideration whether it miedit not be wiser rather to modify the terms of the third sentence of your second paragraph. 4s regards amplification of the draft we recognise that the more we say the more surface wo expose, and that by referrin to the fact that we hate on numerous occasions during the past century repudiated Persian claims to Bahrein, we confirm the Persian contention that that claim has neror been allowed to lapse. But we are inclined to think that for all that the assertion is worth makin , with the addition possibly of a special reference to the 1906 repudiation which is the *aost emphatic recent statement of our position. is regards the argument employed in the third sentence of paragraiih 2 of your draft, we feel that, in view of the specific reference in the Persian note to the correspondence of 1069, taerely to suggest that their claim is based on the occupation of Bahrein by Persia during certain periods prior to 1783 might, to a detached&lt;3 detached or possibly hostile critic in the ijeague, convey an iroression of disine'snuousness, wore especially as the rersian riao^M to whatever we s^y would probably base itself on a series of incidents coionencin . with the Uruco episode of 1822, and leading up throucJi the appeals to Persia of 183f' and possibly 1859 to the 1869 discussion and t the fact that the Persian interpretation in 1886 of the 18 ^) correspondence as an acknowledgaent of Perela f s cia.iji was not at the time repudiated by Her liajesty’s Goveronent. In these circumstances, we should be inclined to suggest that it might be worth amplifyin this particular section of the draft to the effect that effective Persian occupation of the island had ceased in 1783, that since then sovereignty had never been exercised by thorn in it (if you thini this safe, in vie T - of the incidents of 1 38 and 1; 59), that they had made no attempt to reconnuer it from the ^rabs, who hid wrested it from them, and that the connection with Bahrein of His Majesty’s Government, which culminated in their special treaty relations, now of Ion- standing. referredreferred to in the Heja* Treaty, with the Sheikh, had not conmanced until a considerable period after the island had been conquered by the Wahabis , then proceedinfr, on the lines of your present naragraoh 4, to say that the correepondance of 1869 was noter intended t to lend itself to the interpretation placed upon it by Persia* and that this is loads abundantly clear not only by the subsequent en^agenents entered into by His Majesty's Governaant with the hheikh* but by tne successive repudiations culminating in ti:ie emphatic repudiation of 1906 # of Persian cl *iias to suserainty* I am sendin ; a copy of tiiis letter to Shtsokborgh.Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of the instructions received by me with reference to the Shaikhs of Bahrain and the Persian claim to Bahrain. 1 shall, 1 presume, he coming to Bahrain shortly in connection with the Ibn Saud meeting but if this is unduly delayed I will in any case visit you with reference to the subject of this letter.

To - Major Barrett, Shiraz 0 No. 208 Bated 7th September 1928. MOHOMKD J.aMaL KIIUNJI is known to endorse Persian Ilm-o-Klmbars for return journey to Lingah „ Shall I stop this by order.Confidential. !• According to Al Habhan v 8 iiiotory, Nadir Shah when his kingdom took a stronghold, wrote to his Govern or in Shiras, Mirza Taqi Khan, ordering him to soize Bahrein from the hands of Sheikh Jahhara. He obeyed his orders, invaded Bahrein with a large foroe and conquered it. Sheikh Jabbara himself was away from Bahrein in the holy city of Mecca;his viceroy could not withstand the army of Mirza Taqi Khan, so he took to flight and the sol diers of Madir Shah got hold of Bahrein. This took place in the year 1150 A.H. Next year (1151) Saif bln Sultan, the ruler of Muscat Invaded Bahrein and after bringing about a general slaughter became its master;but in the following year (1152) Hadir Shah issued orders in the name of his governors Muhammad Taqi Khan and ^,alq All Khan, bidding them to put the ruler of Muscat to death. They, thereupon crossed to Muscat and put him to death. After his death, Hadir Shah again became the master of Bahrein and appointed Al Mazkur to govern it on his behalf. These were Sheikh Ghaith and Sheikh Hasir Al Mazkur. 2. The writer of Sheikh Abdulla bin Ahmad 9 s letter to the Governor of Shlras was Sheikh Abdul Jalil, the port of Bahrein, whose book was printed in Bombay .The reply is given in full in the book. I am attaching a copy with its translation. It is mostly flowery no things. The portion I have marked does however appear to profess some sort of allegiance. Sheikh Mahomed bin Isa says that the whole letter is merely a polite and flowery rejection of the Governor 9 s proposals. It seems to me difficult to determine where polite persiflage ends and real business begins. Perhaps you may be able to check the translation of the portion 1 have marked and see if it bears a definite / interpretation. a rather important point made by Sheikh Mahomed and confirmed by his brothers is that at the time of this visit4 visit Sheikh Ahdulla was not the Head Sheikh, was Sheikh Sulaiman (from whoa Sheikh Isa is descended) Sheikh Abdulla, his brother was merely associated with him, in the way that Sheikh Mahoiaed bin Khalifa was af terwards associated with Sheikh Abdulla and even ^hmed bin Ali, Sheikh Isa f s brother was associated with him in the early days of Sheikh IsaU rule. The associated re lation enjoyed very large revenues and was a super coun sellor and commander of the armies. His influence in The Ruler the affairs of the State was immense but he was not the head. Muhammad al Habhan makes no mention of the incident but he gives the date of the death of Sheikh Sulaiman and the succession of his brother Abdulla as 1236 a.H. 5. Habhan aftei^eacribing the events leading to the- del eat of Sheikh Abdulla says ^ The he (Sheikh Abdulla went to lars, where he scattered his army, every tribe in a small town and himself put up, together with his companions in a small town in Haband called Sfakhl H&amp;shil. There was a consiberable number of all tribesmen with Sheikh Abdulla and there was a considerable number of their followers as well. There some of the sons of Sheikh iibdulla went to Damam ( on the Arab coast south of ^atif) and took their re sidence there. He himself went to Kuwait to seek the help of its ruler Al Sabah, but did not succeed in his object; the he proceeded to Hejd when also he could se cure no support. Then in the year 1265 Me set out to Muscat to secure the help of Multan Sajryid Said, but when he reached there he died.' Sheikh MohamAd bin Isa says that Sheikh Abdulla bin Ahmed went to Kuwait but sent his family to Bedha Khan m at Asalu. Prom Kuwait he went to Hejd to ask help from Paisal bln Saud but was refused. He then went to Muscat and died there. His family went to Damam and some of them i.e. thethe d«&amp;u*ud&amp;nts of hi a son Mubarak are still in Hasa .-' They have gardens in ^atlf but never possessed a single garden in Persia, It is true that a number of Abdulla's followers emi grated to Persia, but the reason is that they were traders by sea. They depended on their trade with India for a livelihood so went to ports on the trade route. Their move was certainly not due to any desire for Persian nationality. It must be remembered that at that time Persian rule on the sea coasts did not exist, 4, Mahamad al Nabhan speaking of Sheikh Mahamod bin Khalifa says ' There are xanous stories current about him, some of which I will produce for the sake of enjoyment and evidence ( of his chaste judgment, acute genius, clear perception and quick penetration ± into the interpretations of dreams). It was his in genuity that he hoisted an Ottoman flag on the south west tower of Qal&amp;h Abi Kahir and a Persian flag on the south east, so that whenever either of the sove reignties Imposed dominion on him, he alleged his con nection with the other and thus remained safe, But fire of jealousy Inflamed the hearts of the English, who oo&lt;&lt;ld not bear to see his union with the two Muslim powers and consequently instigated the ^rabs and his nobles to rise against him. On account of his extreme vigilance, they could not extract anything from him till 26 years had passed over his rule. In describing Col.Telly’s first attack on Port Abu Uahlr Mohamed Nab an says ' The Consul counted his (Sheikh Mahomed’s) going away as a further proof of his violation of the agreement and as flying aw^y from retribution, so he ordered his ship of war to direct guns against Qalah Abi Uahlr, which was demolished so that the two flags, the Ottoman and Persian, which Sheikh Muhammad had hoisted over it fell down.' Sheikh Mahomed bl£ Isa says the Persian flag was flyingflying ov«r Abu Hahir Fort whon Col.Polly boabardod it at hie first attack. Ho says there is no proof that .Sheikh hahoi tod bin Khalifa accepted Persian nationali ty when ho was turned out of Bahrein ho looked to Arabs and not Persians was assistance. 5. Habhandoes not mention Mcrakhi. Sheikh aohaaed bin Isa however knows about him. Ho says that Sheikh Mahomed bin Kkialifa was not the ruler at the time he sent Meratki^to Persia. Sheikh Mahomed may have been living in Bahrein with the permission of his brother Sheikh Ali at the time, but the rule had passed to his brother All and the sending of Merakhi was merely one of his intrigues to win back the rule. The wording of the newspaper article bears out Sheikh Mahomed bin Isa's contention. Sheikh Mahomed bin Ahallfa was ob viously smarting under his defeat and was seeking al lies wherever they could be found. 6. It is not known whether Persian troops were despatched and turned back. They certainly never landed. It the warships acted as the newspapers &amp;ay» it is a point adverse to the Persian claim. 7. Habhan's description of the affair is as fol lows : - The battle of Aszila (1286). Sheikh Mahomed equipped an army from Barin ( on Tarut island near ^atif) consisting of Bani Hajir and Sheikh Naslr bln Mubarak A1 Abdulla ( he was grandson of the former Sheikh Abdulla bin ^hmed A1 Khalifa) had made a promise to help him, so he accompanied him amonr, his followers. tthen they landed, Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa came out with a large army, the rest of Al Abdulla, with Sheikh Muhammad bln Abdulla at their head, being in his com* pany with their followers and dependants. Sheikh All however suspected their a&amp;herence when he learnt the alliance of their brothers with Sheikh Muhammad bin KhalifaKUulixft, so lie aokecl thcxa to renew the a^reeiaent,whidBr they did. Then Sheikh All sent hie eon Sheikh Ibrahim to AX Abdulla commanding them to attack the forces of his brotner (Sheikh Muhammad). They expressed their consent «.nd obedience, but when he (Sheikh Ibrahim) turned his back to go to his x'ather’s army. Sheikh Muhammad bin Mubarak and a man from Bani ilaj ir assault ed him so he died. A1 Abdulla thus exhibited themselw ves as enemies of Sheikh xtli. a fierce and bloody battle then took place between the armies of Sheikh Muhammad and A1 Abdulla and that of Sheikh All. Sheikh All was killed and his army dispersed. It was the highly cherished desire of A1 Abdulla to see Ai Salman (i.e.tlie present ru .ers) reduced to the situation which comes to pass through division and dissension. V;hen Sheikh Muhammad bin Khalifa came back and his ■i joa.^er mis billed they considered it a proper oppor* tunity, so they alleged that they were the cause of Sheikh Muhaanaah bin Khalifa’s victory. They even went a step further and assumed that they had a better righl. to the kingdom than he. They kept waiting for a favour-* able opportunity till one day they got hold of Sfceikh Muhammad bin Khalifa whom they imprisoned in ^alah Abi Mahir. Thei^teldest brother Sheikh Muhammad bin ^bdulla be came the ruler. After this Sheikh laa bin All went to ^atar. All his brothers and cousins followed him except his bro ther Sheikh Ahmed bin aII who went to IJejd. XX XX Before 3 months were over the i nglish Consul at Bushire who A name was Bailey (Pelly) came to Bahrein in his war ship and consulted the tribes and people about whom they would like to be their ruler. All of them agreed to send for Sheikh Isa, so the Consul wrute to himhim to come to Bahrein* H« raachad Bahrein with hie own trifce, the tribe A1 Huaim and his followers and ^ut up at Muharrao.* When he saw the Consul the latter told hi» that it was the desire of the people of Bahrein that he should become their ruler. He effected an agreement with the Consul and ascended the throne* The Consul on his arrival had enquired of Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdulla concerning Sheikh Muhasaiad bin Khalifa and had been told that the latter had been killed in the fight, nfter enquiry however the Consul came to know that he was imprisoned in ^alah Ai iiahir* So he surrounded it with his naval force and placed a number of guns over the Bar ul Hukm in Manama, so that they (presumably the Al Abdulla) fled away with their Chief Sheikh Nasir bin Mubarak. When Sheikh Isa bin AH had arrived with his army, the spacious world had beooxae narrow in the eyes of Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdulla, so that he now sought refuge in the ^nglieh war ship. The Consul refused him at first but when he explained that if he were to remain in Bahrein, he would be murdered, he took him in along with his brother’s grandson Sheikh Ali bin Masir bin Mubarak* Then the ship sailed off with him and with Sheikh Muhammad bin Khalifa. N Sheikh Hamad and his brothers assure me that Mab~ ban's description of the incidents described is subs tantially correct. They say that %x± Lorimer is wrong in stating that Muhammad bin Abdulla was holding Eifa in the name of Sheikh All (page 897) and they insist that Sheikh Muhammad bln Khalifa was confined in Abu Mahir as prisoner of Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdulla, the usurper and was rescued by Col.Pslly. The status of Bahrein cannot be compared with that of Baluchistan or the petty Sheikhships of the Persian side od the Gulf, as these have al ays acknowledged PersianPersian GoTerixor (either their own he*d Sneiidi or mother) wad ha-ve flomx the Persian flag. hT«n the Ruler of iiuhasBmerah was idxazal Kti.au, 3cTern- or General of ^rahistan on htiialf of the f-hah and ac cepted the Persian flag.

From-- The Hon’ble ht.Colonel H#V.Bioeoe§l.A*^ jpolitical Resident in the Persian Oulf To - The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. Sir. I have the honour to address the Government of India regarding the treatment of Bahrain subject* resident in Khuaistan. Many of these Bahrain subjects have been settled in Rhus is tan for 20 or 30 years and some of them longer. Ihey fall within two categorical (a) agriculturists who have acquired date gardens and are chiefly settled in the Gusba area opposite Pao near the mouth of the lhatt-al-Arab; and (b) petty merchants, shop-keepers, e.e.,who live in Moh&amp;mmerah town. 2 # When the Persian authorities started some years ago on their present reforms and required all Persian subjects to register themselves and to wear certain prescribed clothing, the question arose of the nationality of these Bahrainis. The Persian authorities, in support of their claim to Bahrain, contended that they were Persian subjects and brought considerable pressuie upon them • • •1 them in yarioue deTioue mannere to regieter ee 3?ereian nationals. The Bahrainis for some time resisted these efforts and the matter was ultimately referred to is Majesty's Legation and was discussed by ^ir ofeert vl^ve with the Minister of Court. In this connection I would invite a reference to Sir Kobert Clive's despatch He* 476 of IBth September 1929 to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, of which a copy was sent to the Government of India* in that despatch His Majesty's Minister reported that lie had received an assurance from Teymourtache that, pending a solution of the Bahrain question, the Lahrainis should be left in peace. I regret to report that, whatever instructione to this effect may have been issued by the Persian authorities at Tehran, the local authorities in Khuzist&amp;n have certainly not acted up to them. His Majnaty s Vice Consul at j4ohMiflerah informed me rtgs* during the winter of 1929-SC^the Bahrainis were being subjected with every kind of petty annoyances in lohaamerah that the ingenious minds of the Persian police could devise and that great pressure was being put upon them to adopt Persian nationality* 3, mrnn I went to Bahrain in December 1929, strong rspresentatione were made to me by the local Shia' priests regarding the treatment accorded to Bahrainis in Mohammerah; and on sswh occasion that I have visited Kohammerah I have received deputations of ahrainis seeking my support against t-he Persian authorities. 4. The most flagrant case of ill-treatment ol Bahrainis at the hands of the Persians of one Haji • •..£g- -Sfel'-fei £ / -3- Haji Hamid. Shis individual was deported to 'Iraq by the Persian authorities and his case has formed the subject of repeated representations by His kiajesty’s linister, but so far without effect* On arrival at Basrah, after having been taken to task by the Persian Consul for his laek of patriotism in saluting the British Vice-Consul at ioham icrah in a public place, he was promised a safe eonduct on condition that he asked for a passport as a Persian subject. He refused to comply with this demand but submitted a request for a passport giving his national status as being that of a Bahraini born at Bahrain. A few days later the Persian Consul told the British Consul at Basrah that he had received authority to issue to persons of dual nation ality who wished to proceed to Persia special permits, making no mention of the nationality of the individual concerned, and that in his opinion Bahrainis were to be considered as coming within this category. However, the passport issued to Haji Hamid by the Persian Consul described him as being a 'Moh&amp;mmerahi', born at Mohauaieraii, With this docu ment Haji Hamid returned to Mohamitierah where, however, two or three days later he was arrested by the Persian authori ties and put on a ship for Bushire. V*hen the Vice-Consul at Mohaamerah enquired the reasons for this action he was told that it was done under the express orders of the Central Government. Haji Hamid naturally did not desire to get off at Bushire, where he would assuredly have been arrested, and proceeded to Karachi« On arrival t-e e, as he was not in possession of a passport, he was fined Hs.ib/- by the local police and put on board the steamer and sent back to Basrah, where he still is. i t ve b nee taken .••taken up his ease with the CoulaI sal oner in 3ind who kindly obtained for me a refund of the fine imposed on this un fortunate individual, who however is still at Basrah unable to pursue his normal cmiercial activities at Mohammerah. 5 * When I visited Hoharamerah in October last, further specific cases of pressure being brought to bear on Bahrainis oame to ray notice and were reported to His Majesty’s Minister and the Government of India in my telegram Ho.T.lll of 3lst ctober 1930 ( copy enclosed for ready reference)• As a result of that telegram urgent representations were made to the ieraian Government by Mr. Sarr in his note of 4th kovsober 1930 but hitherto without effect, and the Persian authorities, so far irom in any way modifying their previous attitude or attempting to implement the assurance given to His Majesty's Minister, have been more active than ever in harassing these unfortunate people. As a result of their action and the apparent powerlesaness of the British authorities to protect them a number of these Bahrainis have accepted Persian nationality papers whereupon the Persian authorities have gone further and have promptly conscripted the younger members of the conuaunity for service in the Persian aragr, and tis majesty’s vice Consul, Mshsisserah, where I recently proceeded in order to discuss this matter, informed me that some 30 of them had been sent off to ihw&amp;s. Eis Majesty’s Acting Consul at Ahw&amp;z referred the matter to His Majesty's Minister, but has been informed in reply that, as these individuals had taken out Persian nationality papers, nothing could be done for them. 6 * the other hand two Bahrainis by name Jafer and AziZf &amp;. r ;ed respectively 17 and 24, sons of one Abdul Cyedan undoubted Bahrain subject, refused to accept Persian nationality papers and were imprisoned on the 28th **.pril by the Persian authorities. They were still in prison when I left ^ohammerah. His .Majesty’s vice Consul had attempted to interrene informally with the Governor of iLoharamerah on their behalf, since there had been a working &gt;vn arrangement with the Governor that while he would^aceept official representations from the vice Consul on behalf of Bahrainis he would be willing to listen to informal representations on their behalf, but on this occasion Dr. Lincoln received a verbal message from the Governor that he would not discuss the question of Bahrainis with him either formally or informally* vf 9 The leading members of the Bahraini community came to see no when I was in Kohammerah and asked me what they should do. As I was unable to hold out any hope for them that the British authorities would protect them, the only advice that I could give them was to accept Persian nationality papers under protest and to register their protest at the Vice-Consulate in each individual case so that when the question of Bahrain is ultimately settled there will be a definite record in the case of each individual that he registered under compulsion. 8 # These Bahrainis, as explained above, come under two categories - agriculturists and traders. The Tomer category do not, i think, deserve much sympathy. I have informed them on several occasions that under Persian law foreigners are not allowed to own agricultural land. It is true that in Shaikh Sir Khasal IQianU days this law was not enforced in the case of Arabs in Khuaistan, but those »«•-6- tho*e day. ar. now past and th. Peraian Xa» on tha | aubject ia wall-itnown, X balieTO, to every foraic,ner. I have told them that, a. Xong a. they are infr.nging^ the Permian Xaw, It is not posalhle for me to do anyt.ng for them, they are .eeklng to get the beat of both worlds the advantage, of Persian nationality without it. drawback.. Thi. they cannot have. Ihey rtiould, I think, be informed that until they diveat themselves of their agricultural lands they cannot claim the privilege of Bahrain nationality• The others however are on a totally different footing. Foreigners are allowed to own shops, warehouses, and dwelling houses, and that Is 1'- - JlRt 01 individuals possess, and in visw of the fact that we control the foreign affairs of the Bahrain state, and are responeible for the protection of their nationals abroad, 1 would strongly urge that it is incumbent upon the British Government to put an end to the persecution of these Bahrain subjects. I need hardly say that our powerlessness to protect Bahrainis is most strongly criticised in Bahrain and has a bad effect on our general position on the Arab coast. 10 . AS a means of bringing pressure to bear on the Persian Government I would suggest that unless they undertake definitely to release those Bahrain subjects already cmsoripted and to cease at once their further persecutions of Bahrainis in Khusistan until the question has been finally settled, they should be informed that the special privileges at present enjoyed by -ersian. resident ••resident in l&gt;ahraln 9 under which, they are subject only to the jurisdiction of the Political Agent and not to that of the Bahrain authorities! will be discontinued! ad that they will be treated in all respects as Bahrain subjects* I doubt whether the ruling authorities in Persia are rery deeply interested in the fate of their compatriots in Bahrain! but I think they would regard the abolition of the capitulations ( if I may so describe it) in Bahrain as a blow to their amour propre aid I doubt if it would be necessary to put the threat into execution* In practice! it would probably be more convenient in the first instance merely to make a Bahrain warrant operative in the case of Persians resident in Bahrain and then arrange with the Bahrain authorities to hand them over to the Political Agent for trial* This however is an administrative detail which could be ca.sidered later in the improbable event of some action of this kind being necessary* 11* I am aware that there are large considerations involved in this question! but 1 would urge that it is in cumbent upon His .£aj esty* s Government to take measures to protect a community who are entitled to claim their protection* I trust therefore that my representations will receive a sympathetic hearing and tnat something will be done on behalf of these people* 12* I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India!

His Majesty's Minister further stated that the letters received hy him showed that the troops of Ihrahim Pacha had occupied Bahrain and that the Imam had suggested to the Shah that he should send a messenger to the Pacha asking him to evacuate the Isrand, 2, Secret Consultation 28th Augus t 1819 Ho, 1, Despatch from the Bombay Government dated the 21st July 1819, regarding the measures to he pursued for the suppression of the piratical tribes in the Gulf of Persia, and the disposal of the Island of Bahrain and such other places as may he wrested from the pirates after the transfer o^ Ras-al- Khaimah to Ihrahim Pacha.

On the death of Karim Khan in 1779, the Zobara Arabs, a section of Uttoobees, made a descent on Bahrain and after a short conflict obliged sw-ikh Huseer. the Governor of Bahrain, to retire to the fort. After plundering the town the Arabs retired to Zobara in 1782. Sheikh Huseer then made an attack on Zobara but was defeated and the Zobara Arabs occupied BahrainBahrain in 1783« In 1799» the Imam of Muscat attacked Bahrain and the Island was reduced in 1800, hut the Uttoohees with the help of V/ahahees recaptured Bahrain in the following year# In 1799, the Uttoohees wrote to the Governor of Bushire that the Island originally belonged to the Turkish Government but that they were desirous of becoming subject to the King of Persia, to whom they would pay a tribute# Sheikh Bassir, Governor of Bushire, availed himself of this invitation and privately proceeding to Bahrain received the tribute for the preceding year# In 1810 the Wahabees assumed the Government of Bahrain and Zobara but the actual administration remained in the hands of Uttoobees# 4 # Political Consultation 4th October 1822 Bos# 5-6# Letter from the Government of Bombay to the Political Agent, Bassadore, dated 17th August 1822 regarding the Imam of f— Muscat’s claim to tribute from the Uttoobees of Bahrain# His Excellency the Governor of Bombay wrote two letters - one to the Imam and the other to the Sheikh of Bahrain • advising them to arrive at a settlement in the matter# 5.

In his letter of B5th May 1C39 the Resident suggested that on account of the unfriendly attitude exhibited by the Governor of Bushire towards the British the port ot Bushire be blockaded. In his letter of 30th May he referred to two letters from Khurshid Pacha who occupied Bahrain in 1839# In one of those letters it was stated that when the Pacha took possession of Hedjd, he received from Pysul books which contained an account of the districts in that province ana also those subject to it. Among them he found Bahrain included, so he took possession of it. As regards the Persian claim to Bahrain, the Pacha stated that the Persians had been rulers of Africa, Asia and hurope but subsequently a strong power arose which was victorious over them by the sword and since then the Persians were confined to the land of Persia only# 8* Foreign Consultation 3rd February 1844, hos #15«18» There are three letters - two of 23rd November 1843 and one of 24th November » from the Resident in the Persian Gulf# In the first he brought to the notice of the Government the continued tranquility in the Persian Gulf.

It is stated therein that from the eleventh century to the beginning of the sixteenth century the inhabitants of Banrain appear to have been subject to Chiefs of their own race. Previous to that period the aborignal sheikhs had not always been able to hold their own against foreign aspirants to power who invaded the island from the other side of the Gulf. In the time of Albuquerque, Bahrain, in common with other islands of the Gulf, fell into the possession of the Portuguese, who were eventually deprived of it by the Sheikh of ■-nsa a dependency of Nejd* It was wrested from the latter about the year 1600 by the Governor of Pars, in the name of Shah With the exception of an interval of sOM Abbas the Great.20 years when Imam Malik and his son Omar were masters of the island, the authority of the Suffavean dynasty was recognised until its extinction in the person of Shah Sultan Hussain. The island then again fell into the hands of the grandson of Imam Malik who in turn yielded it to the Afghan invader .Nadir Shah# The latter retained his hold on it till his death in 1747* Thereafter Bahrain was subject to the Sheikhs of Tahiri, Aseeloo and Ahooshuhur# The Sheikh of the last mentioned place now known as Bushire was a vassal of Persia and under his rule there is little douht that Bahrain paid tribute to the Shah# *ith the death of Karim Khan in 1779 the influence of Persia began to wane and the petty chiefs of the Gulf whose lawlessness had been controlled by the strong hand of .Nadir Shall and his immediate successors were soon involved in a contest for superiority# The Arab tribe oi Uttoobees which had been settled at Zobara attacked Bahrain in 1782 and eventually occupied it in 1785* 17 # S&gt; H» 1870, Hos» 26-27» Letter from the India Office dated the 24th December 1869 forwarding a paper from Tehran reporting that the Persian Foreign Minister had expressed the opinion that the murder of Mohd# bin Khalit a had obviated the necessity for Colonel Pelly’e proceeding to Bahrain* and also that the Persians would themselves keep the affairs of Bahrain by land in order and if necessary ask the British Government to send a naval torce to put affairs into order should anything happen to attect its affairs by sea#( Received under Government of India endorsement No, F.315-N/31, dated the 23rd September 1931), No.472. (E 4081/455/91). Forei Office# S.W.l. 1st August 1931. Sir, i With reference to Sir R. Clive’s telegram No. 110 of the 14th May regarding the ill-treatment suffered by Bahreinis in Persia at the hands of the Persian authorities, I transmit to you the accompanying copy of a letter from the India Office rel tive to the recommendation contained in paragraph 10 of the despatch No. (2358) of the 5th May, addressed by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Government of India, to the effect that the moment has now come to inform the Persian Government that unless they undertake definitely to release those Bahreini subjects already conscripted, and to ce-se at once their further persecutions of Bahreinis in Khuzistan until the question has been finally settled, the special privileges at present enjojted by Persians|re3ident in Bahrein, under which they are subject only to the jurisdiction of the Political jlgent and not to that of the Bahreini authorities, will be discontinued, and they will be treated in all respects as Bahreini subjects. 2. Prira facie it appears only reasonable that, if the Persian Government insist upon tre-ting Bahreini subjects in Persia as Persian subjects, the Sheikh of Bahrein should likewise insist upon treating Persian subjects in j ah rein in the same manner as Bahreini subjects. It is clear, howevei, that if the course recommended by Lieutenant—Colonel Biscoe is adopted, there is a danger that the issue may not remain confined to the treatment of Bahreinis in Persia, and that of Persians in Bahrein. The possibility must be faced that a threat of this n ture may move the Persian Government to adopt counter measures by challenging the status .quo in the Persian Gulf in other ways, e.g. in regard to the present position at Henjam, the facilities now enjoyed by Imperial Airways on the South Persian air route, or the visits of British warships to Persian ports. There is the further responsibility that the PersianPersian Government would protest to the League of ^at-ions regarding the treatment of Persian nationals in Bahrein, and would take the opportunity of asserting once more their claim to sovereignty over these islands* 3« For this reason I consider that the question nether it would be wise to adopt Lieutenant-Colonel Biscoe*s proposal must largely depend on the degree to which it can be held to be likely to have the desired effect* It is possible that tne Persian Government care little for the welfare ot Persian residents in Bahrein, and will not be moved to accord nahreini nationals in Persia more favourable treatment by the knowledge that otherwise their nationals in Bahrein will lose certain privileges which they at present enjoy* In such circumstances the sole results of the action now proposed would presumably be on the one hand that the Persian Government might retaliate against British interests or press more actively their claims to sovereignty over Bahrein, and on the other that Bahreinis in Persia would in future be persecuted to a much greater extent than at present* 4 # Before deciding whether to instruct you to address the \. Persian Government in the sense suggested, I shall be . lad to learn whether such a threat to the Persian Government, and the actual withdrawal of the privileged position at present enjoyed by Persians in Bahrein, • should it become necessary in the i last resort to carry the treat into effect, - is in your opinion likely to result in any improvement of the treatment at present meted out to Bahreinis in Persia* I am, with great truth, Sir, Your obedient servant, (For the Secretary of State), Sd.

Apart from this cons, deration, Mr. Bodd gives various o-her reasons for which he considers such action inadvisable. 4. Lord Reading is in general agreement with the views expressed by Mr. Bodd in the enclosed despatch, and in his opinionfthere would be serious objections to adopting the course of action suggested by the Political resident..

E.4740/455/91 Mr Dodd to the Marquess of Heading- iNo 494) Gulhek, September 9th 19 31* My Lord, Vvith reference to Mr Secretary Henderson’s despatch of the 1st ultimo, ^ tiave the honour to report that 1 am not in favour of adopting the measures of retaliation suggested hy the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf as a means of coercing the Persian Covernr -ment into modifying their treatment of Bahreinis in Persia, nor even of threatening the j-ersian Government with such retaliation. tn my opinion, such a course is unlikely to achieve the desired result of ameliora- -ting the situation of Bahreinis in Persia. The Persian Government cannot he credited with any such tenderness for their subjects as the contrary supposition implies. I fear that the Persian authorities’ zeal might even be whetted in hunting down their victims. 2 , The proposal to treat Persian subjects in Bahrein as subjects of the sheikh does not appear tj me even to be logical, ^is majesty's Government and the sheikh have all along maintained that Bahrein is a State independent of and distinct from Persia. Persians are aliens in Bahrein, and 1 can see no grounds on which they could reasonably be regarded as Bahreinis. It would be logical and consistent to withdraw trom Persians the special privileges enjoyed oy them in common with other foreigners. The Political Agent, Bahrein, who has been staying with me for the last three days, has privately informed me that he would not regard with equanimity thft teniiiniation of his jurisdiction over so large an2 . an alien colony, since it would have the eileco of undermining his influence. -n the other hand, the closing cf the lersian schools and the interdiction of the lahlava cap would he an even sorer offence to lersian amour - propre, and if any such, measures of retaliation he resolved upon , it is this which he, for his private part, would recommend. But 1 am / speaking personally, unahle to approve of inflicting hardships on these Persians, for the sins of their Government, of which they are innocont. 4. The attitude of the Persian Government in this question has been, in their own eyes, consistent. For them Bahrein is part of Persia ana u^hreinis x e S i ar subjects. It follows that when legislation is passed making life more burdensome for Persian subjects such as for instance, the conscription law, Bahrein must shoulder the burden with the rest. •'■hen 1 complained of the persecution of Bahreinis to the minister f-r Foreign Affairs recently, he wished me to dccppt this view. He did not deny that conditions had become more burdensome for Bahreinis; but he argues that his own son had been conscripted. To ask the xersian Gcvern- -ment to exempt the Bahreinis, is to ask them to abandon their claim in favour of that of His majesty’s uovern- -ment. It is true that the Minister cf .ourtfdid undertake to see to it that Bahreinis were not molested. That undertaking was however,a derogation^ from the lersian aspect of the status quo, and has since been in fact dishonoured. On the other hand, o.ny ouch measure of retaliation as that suggested to Lieutenant- Colonel Biscoe would be an actual and admitted breach of the status quo on the part of His Majesty’s Govern- -ment. It would be proclaimed as such. This departure would place His Majesty’s Government dialectically, ifs. if not morally, in a disadvantageous position. It would t&gt;e taken by tbe lersian Government as justification for any counter measures in the lersian Gulf which they chose to take - although I scarcely believe that the lersian*' timorous charatofe’er would allow them to take ny veiy a.astic steps. It would however assuredly lead the Persian Government to seize the occasion loudly to reassert their ciiims to the sovereignty over Bahrein, -hey might even protest again to the League of Nations. 5. But some day the negotiations for a general treaty will presumably be reopened; ana an overt breach of the status quo by His -ajesty's Government now might handi- -cap the -“ritish representative from the start, -t would be preferable that he should be in a position to make capital out of his Majesty's Government's inno- -cer.ce of such a breach in the face of gress ^rovo- -cation. lo me it seems improbable that any useful step can be taken on behalf of the ^ahreinis apart from the settlement of the claims to Bahrein sovereign- . t y in principle. This settlement can hardly be achieved save as part of a general treaty settlement; and in this respect, the sooner negotiations for a general treaty can be resumed the better. 6 As mentioned above, I hardly anticipate that the Persian Government would counter a mov^against British interests elsewhere in the Gulf. But one cannot be sure. And if British prestige is suffering from the impotence of His Majesty's Government to protect Bahreinis from iersian oppression, the loss of prestige which would ensue from such a humiliation as expulsion from Benjam would have still mere violent repercussions• In their present frame of mine!, the rersian 7 .4. the Persian GoYernment resent what i'eroughi calls the exercise ot unwarranted pressure. Tbe leeson of the failure hitherto to obtain an extension of Imperial Airways permission to fly along the xersian coast by a refusal to npepcn the Puzdap hallway m default of it should not be forgotten. Such pressure as that recommended by Lieutenant-Colonel xascje would appear to the Persian Government as unwarranted and would be resented, and might make them still less sympathetic to the aesiaerata of his ^jesty’s Govern- -ment. 8. Eecent legislation requires that agricultural landowners should be Persian subjects. Chat effect this has had on hahrein landowners* loyalties in Khuzistan 1 am at present unaware, and X am making enquiries, hut most if not all, will, x anticipate prefer to accept Persian papers ana keep their land. If this conjecture proves to be correct, the probx -c vvcirTic ™iii lave been solved by events of protecting Bahreinis will nave for an important part of them. 5 . In conclusion I may add that the Persian Govern ment may be encouraged in their attitude towards Bahreinis in Persia by their general attitude on the question of Persian nationality. This is typified in t he provision of the nationality law by which any inhabitant of xersia is a Persian subject unless ae can prove to the satisfaction of the Persian Government that he is of foreign nationality. ^ accepting or rejecting the proof, the decision of the xersian Government is final. 1 tiave etc., *( For Charge d*Affaires) L.Baegallay.aad institute s Tsry orael per see at I o?t &lt;*£ thee# individ^le.

I feel some apologyi? due to you for my remarks to Dodd which he has taken advantage of in this underhanc manner, for you are clearly entitled to expect that your subordinates will not make statements that may prejudice any line of action you have decided upon. X thereforemy humblest apologies, and my excise i that X had not realised the length to which a for eign Office official would go to to attain his ends. The remarks were made in the course of a private chat, and it was only when he asked me to give my^iews in writing that I realised that I was dealing with a type new to me, and on Leaving him I made a note of what had be-n said so as to inform the Residency. I was only four hours in Bushire on my way though from Isfahan. and the B?N.O. and Major Fowls had some important matters to dis- t . an^ the mater slipped my mind. 2. I saw little of Podd during my two days tnere as I was busy with the dentist, and he did not me t except once at meals. Just before I left h wever, he a-ked me to come and see him and chatted about the Gulf and Bahrain. He. then got onto the subject of this retaliation and asked me if I thought it WO uld be effective. I said ' No, I dont, for once the transfer has been made it will be over and done with and as the rersian Government are perfectly callous to any injustice their subjects , may suffer we shall get nothing out of it. In fact we may suffer ourselves for they are a very turbulent crowd and the Bahrain Government have not the machinery to deal with them. TrouDle^ would ensue and the ’gency would be called in, but would A K** .ave the power to punish except through the Bahrain Government. ’ Is there any other way we could get at them ? 1♦ v e s t certainly. If Pahlayi caps wer^ abolished and their sc. schools closed we should be able to bring a continual series nf pinpricks to bear on a very sensitive portion 01 their iiide. The Pahlavi cap would touch them very closely and ail iersia would hear of it.* 3. He then gave me his views regarding the status quo. I told him that in allowing the Persians to make their own deii. nition of it we were selling the pass* but that it was only ty pical of the cringing attitude we had adopted in Persia ior a. the last nine years. I adcui that we had treated Pahrain exactly as if it had belonged to us* and that if we did not protect then in return we were like welshing bookma-kers. - e said that he feared their retaliation at Henjam. I said that that was exactly what I objected to. Ifce were sacrificing Bahrain interests in order protect or obtain facilities for the Navy and that such a course was dishonest This part of my conversation he did not reproduce ! 4. He then asked me if I could write to him giving the alternative mean° of retaliation that I recommended. I was as tounded and told him that I was directly subordinate to you and could only address you in such a matter. He was obviously dis appointed, and finally said * Yes, Isee. I suppose you cant. 5. Just as I was going he said f There is one other thing T want to talk to you about. You know there is a question of moving the Residency to Bahrain and Col Biscoe has estimated it at £100,030.• This seems exorbitant to us. With your experience of Bahrain Building do you not think it could be done for much less. T said f No. Everything will have to be imported, and suitable artisans for a pukka building would have to come from India. The new ^unjab states Agency, which is a smaller one than the Gulf Residency, and has half the staff is estimated to cost 14 lakhe or rather more than £100,000 at the present rate of exchange. ff Fe said * Well it seems a great deal of money to me, and it 1'oks as though Col Biscoe did not want to move.’ To this I made no replyPage 3. 6* I discovered a curious fact when up there. No one in Teh ran has the slightest idea how wide the extent of your jurisdic tion really is. In fact they found great difficulty in understand ing that I should be subordinate to you, and were much surprised that I should have to ask permission from Bushire Dei ore leaving Isfahan for Tehran, or that Bxwh the Resident could object to my going on to the Caspian It was psrhapd indiscreet to di'cuss anything in Tehran on which their views and yoirs clashed, but it is difiicult remain silent when asked a question in what one imagines to be a private conversation. If it has caused you any annoyanxxce I can only offer my apologies, and I shall certainly ue ito.e c-re ful in conversation in future when with ioreign Ofiice officials. Yours sincerelyPolitical Agency, Bahrain, trie lotn lecember 1931. From:- Political Agent, Bah rain. To:- The Hon T ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf., 1 have the honour to refer to your letter No:74G-S dated Gth November 1931 to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to heartily echo,as far as it is open to me,with due respects the sentiments expressed in the final paragraph tnereof. 2. We have interfered in the affairs of Bahrain to an extent unparalleled in British India save where misrule lias been so ixar marked as to threaten a revolution. Our interference has gone to the extent of assuming jurisdiction over a very large number of the inhabitants,of deposing a Ruler,of manipulating Xjaii an Oil Company to suit our imperial interests ana finally establish- ing an^air base and I consider the demand that we snould grant these people the same support and protection that we extern to inhabitants of British Indian States. 3. If Rr.Rood’s views were to be accepted it would mean that it would be open to the Persian Government to commence a persecution of Bahrain subjects at any time,merely,on the grounds that theirown subjects were liable to similar barbarities and to any justice elsewhere in their dominions. In other words we have acquiexcised in the doctrine that the r 'ersian Government are allowed to put their own interpretation on what constitutes the status quo. Confidential . No:C//i7 .4. A new matter has arisen,howeyer,in which early action is imperative to forestall any possible Persian claim ann that is the arrival of the Persian Navy in these waters, iou ei e no doubt aware that this has been a cause of some alarm to the inhabitants of the Arab Littoral,who are well aware of the aggressive nature of post war Persia. The Shaikh of r.ss al Khaimah observed to some one the other day that now the ersians wks were buying warships they would try to conquer the Arabs, but,he added,the British Government would not let them. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad askea me the other day whether it was true that the Persians were bringing warships into the Persian Gulf and, I could see that both he and his brother,Shaikh Abdulla,viewed the prospect with some uneasiness. They dis-r cussed the possible damage these ships may ao to Arab interests, but Shaikh Hamad finally said,the Government^.e.,the British Government,would not allow them to interfere with us. it is this that I wish to make certain of in advance. 5. As you are aware Bahrain owns a tery large number of boats, mostly connected with the Yearling industry. These are alx numbered ana registered and are in possession oi nationality certificates,issued by the Director ot Customs and counter signed by the Political Agent. They are always able,therefore, to prove their nationality at a moment T s no t ic e. It is quite possible that under a of searching^the new Persian l.&amp;ry may stop these vessels and finding them of Bahrain origin treat them as theirown and subject them to the same arbitrary treat ment*, aac is A&amp;jestyfe Minister when appealed to oy us would,no doubt,then say that since the Persian Government assumes that Bahrainthe Persians^ th&amp;^ ctuTiflirt*feeing wlm^yor to the status quo and 'they would be stultifying their claim if they uid not do so'« 1 feel very strongly,therefore,tnat oefore any possible iHterfjsrBKaK question of interference by 'ersians with Bahrain vessels can arise,a solemn warning conveyed in the plainest possible terms should oe aaaressea to that Government stating that we regard Bahrain vessels of whatever shape or s ;i / \ as entitled to the same same protection as British vessels and that our warships will immeeiately take notice of any attempts to exert soverignty over them, if this is done before the ersian sloops arrive no one could possibly claim this xx &lt;^&gt; . KuivU' *v tne status quo and if our attitude were dell nett before hand,I have no aoubt the Persians would hesitate before tne/ involved themselves in any action which we would be entitled to resist by force of arms. b. I understand that at a recent meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence it was dec idee to do nothing in this matter, i would very respectfully urge that action is required ana very early action at that. I have mentioned Bahrain but it is clear that arab interests further afield may be involved^racas between Arabs and 1 ’ersiens frequently occur on the Trucial Coast and should one of their ships be in port,let us say at Dubai, there is no doubt,what- evei,that tney would assist their countrymen by force of arms and a moot awkward situation would ensue. This,however,is beyond my province ana has no doubt been the subject of your consitieration. I have the honour to be Sir, four r £ost obedient Servant, Political Agent,Bahrain. IIConf i oential.

I hare the honour to refer to the third paragraph of jrour letter No:740-S dated the 6th Not ember 1931 and to say that t ourh this A -ency has not been consulted regarding the form which retaliation upon the Fersian Corernment should take,nevertheless i feel that it is a matter in which my views should be placed on record ana I,therefore,express them below. 2. I do not believe for a moment that the abolition oi the capitulations in Bahrain.as far as 'ersians were concernea,and the subjecting of them to the Bahrain Courts would have the desired effect. In the first place owing to its very nature it would be a single act incapable of being repeated and once the initial shock was over would po&amp;tably be imperceptible. Secot»aly,it is obvious to any one who has studied the idiosyncrasies of the present Fersian Government that they are not in the slightest degree disturbed by the hardships they impose on their subjects^so long as their amour propre is maintained. I do not feel that their amour propre would be Effected by the loss of these rights,which here either been lost or never existed in other Arab countries. Thirdly,it is a physical impossibility at the moment to undertake any more work in the Bahrain Courts owing to lack of trainee staff2 . / particular!/ work in a language the/ do not understand. iLe . ersians produce more than half the cour^t work of this Agency,which is now in the neighbourhood of 2,500 cases a /ear. The/^speak no language except Persian and since the Bahrain courts do not speak,read or write this language,chaos would ensue,and it would only be a question of of time before the political Agent would be forced to intervene and resume his jurisdiction over them in the interests of law and order. 3. ,.e have,however, two means of retaliation which are easy oi accomplishment and which would provide a constant spur in the ribs of the Persian Government. I refer to the abolition of the ^ahlavi cap and the closure of the Persian schools. Both would be fully justified, in tha£ Persians compel Bahrainis to change their head-dress in ersia,and,it is well known that an Arab school,maintained by foreign funds,would not be tulerated for a moment in the Arabic speaking districts of Persia, kith every Pahlavi hat knocked off the 'ersian Government would receive a fresh reminder) with every Persian schoolboy obliged to go to an Arab school it would be closely brought home to tnem that what was sauce lor the goose was sauce for tne 4. I repeat,therefore, that the transfer of jurisdiction over ^ersians to the Bahrain Government is not only impolitic but impracticable and that in attacking their schools and ^ahlavi hat we are on surer ground. gander. I have the honour to be Sir, Your Most Obedient Servant, Political Agent, Bahrain.(Received under Government of India endorsement Uo.F.315-N/30 of 30th November 1931). From The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, To The Under Secretary of State for India, ing with le Resident in the Persian Gulf No.740-3, dated the 6th November 1931, and to offer the following observations of the Government of India on the subject of the treatment of Bahrainis in Persia. Government of India have understood from the beginning that the Political Resident’s intention as expressed in paragraph 10 of his letter No.235-3, dated the 5th May 1931 was merely that the special privileges at present enjoyed by Persians resident in Bahrain should be with drawn and not that such persons should be regarded as Bahrain subjects. The recommendation made by the Govern ment of India in their telegram No.l333-S, dated the 21st May 1931, is to be interpreted accordingly. 3. On further consideration the Government of India are now however inclined to the opinion that apart fr'om the present question there are objections of weight against the abandonment of the Political Agent’s No.313-B/30 London Dated New Delhi, the 30th November 1931 Sir ' l the correspondence ehd- 2 I am to explain in the first instance that the j urisdiction • • •jurisdiction over Persian subjects in Bahrain. ?he causes which induced the Government of India to recommend the assumption of jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahraini vide Despatch from the Government of India in the Foreign Depart ment No.188 of 1907, dated the 14th November 1907 and connected correspondence) still apply with the same force as formerly and it seems doubtful whether it would at this stage be wise to do anything which might endanger the position achieved in an attempt to bring pressure to bear on the Persian Government. 4 . The Government of India are further impressed by the arguments advanced by Hr.Dodd in his despatch No.494, dated the 9th September 1931 and disposed to agree that as a means of bringing pressure, the proposed abandonment of jurisdiction over Persian subjects in Bahrain might well fail in its obj ect. 5 . No doubt, as the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf urges, the rights of Bahrain subjects abroad should be as zealously protected by British Consular Officers as those of British subjects. Under present conditions in Persia it seems necessary however to face the fact that even if Bahrainis were regarded by His Majesty’s Government as British subjects consular intervention in Persia on their behalf, as in cases of persons of dual nationality, would not be likely to prove effective. There seems therefore to be no remedy cut patience, unpleasant and humiliating as the admission may be. It seems possible that if His Majesty’s Minister were to bring the facts once more to the notice of the Persian Government and make an appeal to their vanity reminding them of the undertaking given by the Minister of Court, he might I be able to persuade them that to leave Bahrainis in Persia in peace is not really tantamount to surrender of their claims tor' -3- to Bahrain, but this is a matter of tactics over which the Government of India hesitate to advise. 5 . A copy of the letter is being sent to His Majesty’ Minister,Tehran and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to ce, Sir, Your most obedient servant, sd/- E.3.Howell, Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.to send you for your confidential information a precis of some recent correspondence, which will be of interest to you, regarding the ersian claims to sovereignty over Bahrain , and a suggestion which emanated from our Minister in Tehran that -ohe uestion might be solved by submission to arbitration . ji &lt; /cLfT* K Major C. K. Daly, \ Political .agent , Bahrain.In the course of a conversation which he had last October with the British Minister in Tehran on the subject of Bahrain , the Persian Minister for Foreign .affairs , Mossadegh - es - Saltaneh, observed tlat altho-ogh the Persian Government had no intention of raising the raestion of sovereignty, at all events for the tine being, no ersian Government could abandon or compromise the Persian claims to the island; and lor that reason the Government of which he was a member could not agree to cancel certain instructions which had been issued by the previous government to the Karguzar of ^xabistan regard ing t]:]e grant of Persian visas for journeys to Bahrain, nor the notice issued some time ago by the Persian Vice-Consul at Nejef which equally indicated a tendency on.the part of the ersian Government to assert those claims. .uiy cancellation by the ersian Government would be regarded as a total abandon ment ol their claims , and if a formal demand for cancellation were made , it would be met by a formal assertion of Persia's claims . .Mossadegh-es-Sultaneh admitted , in reply to the historical argument then put foi^ward by Sir Percy ^oraine , that Pei’sia's refusal to abandon its claims was based on moral and sentimental reasons but he did not believe that Persian public opinion would ever agree to such a renunciation except for very good reasons . 2. This led Sir Percy Loraine to hazard ihe purely private suggestion that if the ersian Government would not yield to any argument , it might accept an arbitration award by some third party which Sir p. Loraine said was certain to be against ersia . Mossadegh-es-Saltaneh said that in his opinion the ersian Government would accept such an award . (It may be noted,by the way, that Sir p. Loarnine did not ask and Mossadegh-es~Saltaneh did not say whether Persian public opinion would be likely to support the Persian Government in that case ^ a most important omission) .3 • Ths contents of this conversation were at once c om- municated to His Majesty’s aovernment who expredsed theii’ un~ ualified disapproval of the suggestion to submit to arbitrat- -ion the uestion of sovereignty over Bahrain for the follow- ■ ^ T]ie °i history. The Persians were in possess ion oi Bahrain for Jo years only from 175J to lys^ and since then Bahrain has been ruled by an ^rab Shaikh who r is under our protection and who would regard the reference to arbitration as an act of deceipt towards himself by His Majesty’s Government on whom he counts for protection (as e .g . in I 87 I -72 when the presence of British ships in Bahrain prevented Turkish attempts at encroachment , and in 1888 and I 893 when His Majesty’s Goveinment took similar deciaed action) . The inhabitants have no affinity ‘with Persians and no desire to be ruled by them. I 1 ^reference oi tne Bahrain uestion to arbitration woulc cause grave doubts of our good faith and of our strength in the Middle East in the minds of the rulers of other ^.rab states in the Persian Gulf . (3) It would form a dangerous precedent,which might be 1 followed by a similar request from the Persian Government * in regard to Mosul or from Bin Baud in regard to Kuwait. (4) There is the danger, remote but not to be dismissed, that the arbitrators might not be satisfied as to our - 1 -i^kts to de facto' sovereignty over Bahrain to enter into any argument with the Persian Government on the subject should it be raised by that Government , but to meet the suggestion with a categorical assertion of our claim that Bahrain is under our protection and that no further represent ations on the matter will be entertained ing reasons 4.
