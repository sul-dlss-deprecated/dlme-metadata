(!) O l L~ 2. Mr. Li, who is 37, started his official career as a district magistrate in 1928. He entered the diplomatic service three years later and served in London from 1932 to 1936, during which period he also acted as Secretary to the Chinese delegation to the World Economic Conference held in London in 1933 and Secretary to the Chinese Delegations to the League Assembly in 1934 and 1935. Prom 1937 to 1941 he was Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs for Kansu Province, being the first holder of the post. In 1941, he was transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was a member of the Chinese delegation in the abortive negotiations for an Immigration Agreement with Burma. 3. In a statement regarding Mr. Li’s appointment issued by the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reference is made to the antiquity of iaino-Iranian relations, and to the introduction of Zorastrianism and Nestorianism into China, which are described as constituting a kind of spiritual bridge between China and Iran. Emphasis is also laid on the fact that the Sino-Iranian treaty of amity of 1920 was the first treaty based on equality and reciprocity signed by China as a result of the movement for the abolition of the unequal treaties. This fact may explain the importance the Chinese attach to the present appointment, and probably also their concern over the apparent lack of interest shown by the Government at Tehran in delaying for so long before granting the agrement for Mr. Li. 4. After Dr. Quo Tai-chi’s appointment as Foreign Minister a number of changes took place in the personnel of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, of which the appointment of Mr. Li was one of the first. These changes were construed in some quarters as constituting to some extent a replacement of pro-American by pro-British influence, and Dr. Li was in fact generally regarded as being pro-British. He is well spoken of for his industry and integrity, and has always been very friendly to this Embassy. I have, etc., (Signed) H.J. Seymour - Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C.y M —‘ Foreign OfficelRECD.
