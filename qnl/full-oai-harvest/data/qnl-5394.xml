The report is preceded by a copy of a letter sent by Ross to Sir Alfred Comyn Lyall, Secretary to the Government of India, dated 14 July 1881, which enclosed the submission of the original reports to the Government of India (folio 69).The report is divided up into a number of parts, as follows:1.
                           General Report, prepared by Ross (folios 70-82), which is divided a number of small reports, organised by region and subject, as follows: 1. ’Omán [Oman] or Muskat State; 2. Pirate Coast; 3. Islands of Bahrain; 4. Nejd, El-Hasá [Al-Hasa] and El-Katr [Qatar]; 5. Southern Persia, with subheadings for Arabistan, Fars, Bushire, Lingah [Bandar-e Lengeh] and Persian Beloochistan [Baluchistan]; and 6. Bassidore; naval; slave traffic; the observatory at Bushire; and the purchase of mules in Persia. Under the observatory report (folio 74) there is a handwritten pencil note (author unknown) which questions the underlined term ‘Samoom’ in the text, described as ‘a scorching northerly wind’. Three appendices follow the report: Appendix A comprises tabulated meteorological data from the Bushire observatory; Appendix B contains extracts from a report written by Captain Edward Durand, former Assistant Resident, on the men and internal politics of Fars; Appendix C is a genealogical table showing part of the Kájár [Qājār] royal family of Persia, indicating their present official appointments.2.
                           Administration Report of the Political Agency, Muscat, for the year 1879-80, prepared by Lieutenant-Colonel Samuel Barrett Miles, Her Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent and Consul in Muscat (folios 83-98), chiefly reporting on internal political affairs, with additional short reports on changes in British offical personnel and the slave trade. Two appendices follow the report: A. A note on the tribes of Oman, written by Miles, with tabulated data on the population, district and political affiliation of tribes, and separate sections dedicated to each main tribe, detailing their geographic location, character, and internal organisation. Appendix A also includes two genealogical tables, entitled ‘Seif bin Mohammed bin Saeed bin Mohammed bin Abdulla Âb Boo Saidi’ (folio 92) and ‘Khalfân bin Mohammad bin Abdulla el Wakeel Âb Boo Saidi’ (folio 93). Folio 94 is a note, inserted into the volume at a later, unspecified date, stating that a map, plan or sketch has been temporarily removed from the volume. Appendix B is a note, prepared by Ross, on the Ibadhiyah sect of Oman, with the translation of chapter 29 of “Keshf-ul-Ghummeh-El-Jama’l ’Akhbár-el-Ummeh” of the Shaikh Sirhán-bin-Sa’íd-el-’Alwai of Oman.3.
