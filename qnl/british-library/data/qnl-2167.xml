In compiling this Index Register, obsolete major heads occurring In the previous Registers have been eliminated. Territorial heads like '19. Bahrain' 1 , 'as. Muscat', '53. Kuwait', etc., have also been dispensed with. The files In current use have been re-arranged, and numbered consecutively under each of the new heads without leaving a gap, according to the subject matter to which they relate, Irrespective of the territorial jurisdiction. 2. The omnibus major head '13.Miscellaneous' which conslsted^nearly^fj 300 files has been greatly curtailed and several new major heads appropriate to the nature of the subjects have been opened. It has not been found feasible to eliminate this head altogether and It Is hoped that only papers of a miscellaneous nature that cannot be classified under a more suitable and well- defined major head will be put on these files. 3. The territorial heads should never be revived under any circumstances. The criterion should be to open new major heads If necessary according to the subject natter but not according to the place to which a subject may relate. 4. The bound volumes under the 'A' Series are meant for purposes of reference only. A list of the existing bound volumes under the 'A' Series and an alphabetical index of their subject matter is also being separately compiled. Periodical 'weeding' out of the files is essential and a list of files destroyed from time to time should be invariably maintained as much time will otherwise be wasted by the succeeding generations of staff. /6. In the....5* In the current files (which are numbered under the 'B' ^Series according to this Index Register), references to the closed volumes under the 'A' Series have been given wherever possible* 6. For the successful working of this system the compilations in the Inward and the Outward Registers should be invariably marked, and its importance need not therefore be over-emphasised.

The list of common A series files, with their B series numbers (folios 7-11) is arranged numerically by A series file number (1 through to 92). The index to the main headings (folios 12-18) is arranged alphabetically. The main headings (folios 19-212) are arranged by the heading number. Many of the main headings were allocated several folios to accommodate future expansion to the lists, the result being that there is often one or more blank folios included at the back of each list where the additional space was never required.</extent><extent>Foliation: The volume is foliated from the front cover to the inside back cover, using circled pencil numbers in the top-right corner of each recto. The following foliation anomalies occur: 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume is an index of those files created by staff at the Persian Gulf Residency that came under the general heading ‘B Series’. The B Series was created in 1945 from those A Series files (see the A Series index at Z/R/15/1/1) that remained open at the time. New B series files were opened until the closure of the India Office in 1947. The bulk of the volume is made up of lists of files (folios 19-212), arranged under subject headings which are numbered from 1 through to 95. The file lists under each subject heading include a file number, file title, and original (A Series) file number.The original lists in the volume are typewritten, but the extensive annotations, deletions and additions, marked in pen and pencil by various hands, suggest that the index was a working document for a number of years after its creation. There is no guide to the meanings of the single-letter and acronymic annotations, or the ticks and crosses used. New files opened after the creation of the index have handwritten entries added below the typewritten lists, which are marked ‘new’ or with the letter N under the original file number column. Some files are marked as destroyed, while those files marked with the letter D may also indicate destruction. Many of the handwritten annotations dated between 1947 and 1953 note the transfer of files to other Government departments or organisations in the wake of the closure of the India Office. For example: C.O. (Commonwealth Office), F.O. (Foreign Office), G. of I. (Government of India), G. of P. (presumed to be Government of Pakistan), and H.M. (meaning unclear). On most pages files are marked with the letter T or L, but the meaning of these letters is not explained.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100022598644.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
