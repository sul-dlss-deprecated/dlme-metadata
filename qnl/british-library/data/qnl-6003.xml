ADMIRALTY &gt; 1 .02976/38 .A CONPIDEKTIAL. 9« W* X* 10th June, 1938 Sir, In reply to Foreign Office letter E 2094/2094/93 of the 2nd May, I am commanded hy My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that they concur in the view that the construction of a port in Kovveit Bay under Iraqi control, coupled v/ith an extension of the Iraqi railway thereto, would he open to objection on the ground that if such a project v/ere executed, the Sheikhdom would tend to fall more and more under Iraqi influence. 2* It appears to be undesirable from every point of view that a British protected Sheikhdom should become dependent economically on Iraq to too great an extent. Furthermore, the uevelopment of the port would no doubt involve the grant of privileges which would tend to assume a political character, such as freedom from Koweit customs control, etc., and it seems very unlikely that the Iraqis would agree that Koweit (a comp; ratively insignificant Sheikhdom) should have any considerable hand in the control of their new port. 3. Moreover, My Lords feel that the danger from Persia which the Iraqi project is designed to insure against could hardly be regarded as serious so long as the Anglo-Iraqi alliance is maintained. It is unlikely that v Persia would commit an act of aggression against Iraq while we v/ere at peace. If we were at v ar it also seems to be improbable that Persia, left to herself, v,ould adopt a hostile attitude, since we are the largest purchasers of Persian oil, and, in the event of supplies The Under Secretary of State, * Foreign Office, 'being/ S.W.lbeing withheld from ourselves, we should almost certainly be in a position to ensure that no enemy power obtained oil irom this source. The resulting loss of revenue should be sufficient to c eter Persia from ; ny such hostile move. 4. The real danger to our supplies of oil from Persia would appear to be that internal disturbances, probably fomented by our enemies, might break out in that country whenve were at war. In this event it would be necessary for us, if we were to continue to draw these supplies, to control that part of the country where the oil concession lies, and this would incidentally mean security of navigation in the 3hatt-el-Arab. 5. My Lords would accordingly suggest that, provided the secretary of State concurs in the foregoing analysis of the probable Persian attitude, it might be as we 1 that His Majesty ? s Ambassador, jagclad, should also be instructed, when^ he attempts to dissuade the Iraqi Gover ment from the Kov/eit scheme, to remind them of the value of their alliance with this country. 6. with regard to Sir John Ward’s proposal for a port at Fao, Their Lordships consider that this project would, from the point of view of this country, have none of the disadvantages of the scheme for a port at Koweit. Indeed it would appear to offer definite advantages since any development which would attract more trade to the 3hatt-el- Arab is desirable because it is bound to result in a wider distribution of the heavy dredging costs and a corresponding decrease in the high proportion of these dues at present derived from the shipment of Persian oil. An increase in the traffic not related to the carriage of oil is all the more desirable in view of the possibility that the Oil Company may be obliged to develop a port in Persian territory (e.g. at Bandar Shahpur). Conversely, the development ofan Iraqi port outside the t3hatt-el-Ara!:&gt;» hy talcing away from the river traffic not connected with the carriage of oil, could only lead to an increase in the credging dues levied on ships carrying thnt commodity; this in turn would further encourage the Persians to proceed with their project for a port at Bandar dhahpur, which, Being on neutral territory, i ould he of much less use to this co ntry than an Iraqi port for supply purposes in time of war. ’/• finally, I am to enclose notes prepared hy the Hydrographer of the TTavy on the relative sui ability of Koweit and Pao for development as a port. These notes also contain information about another possible site - the Khor dhetana - but this is furnished solely as a matter of interest, and Their Lordships do not wish thereby to suggest in any way that the attention of the Iraqi Government should be drawn to this alternative, since, as explained above, the interest of this country appears to them to lie in persuading Iraq to retain her port or ports in the Shatt-el-Arab. 8.

Moreover, the Council feel that the Iraqi proposal for the extension of the Baghdad-Basra Railway to Koweit is not unconnected with the substance of Sir M. Peterson*s despatch, Ho. 162 of April 19th, reporting certain Irani tendencies towards disputing the Independent ^ status of Koweit. That the Iraqi Authorities may be seeking for some means of claiming sovereignty over Koweit is disquieting, and reinforces the Council in their view that the Iraqi proposals for extending their railway to Koweit should be discouraged. In view, .owever, of the great increase in the strategic importance of our lines of communication through Hie head of the Persian Gulf, the Council suggest that it would be politic to frame the reply to the Iraq Government in such a way as to leave an opening for possible negotiations in the future. 3.

I now transmit to you copies of the letters which have 'been received from these Departments in reply. You will see that in the letter from the India Office there are enclosed copies of a semi-official letter on the subject from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Secretary for the Governmeht of India in the External Affairs Department, and of an express letter from the External Affairs Department to the India Office. 2. It is clear from these replies that Taufiq Suwaidi’s proposal is, in its present form, quite unacceptable, although the croEtbion of a port and railway at Koweit would not be without advantage from the military point of view, if satisfactory arrangements could be made for their control. In the circumstances I consider that your best course if it i^necessary to refer to the matter further, would be to confine yourself strictly to the proposal in its present form and to say that His Majesty*s Government are not favourably disposed to a scheme on the lines suggested, since th.ey do not see how it could function without infringing the rights of the Sheikh. You could then add, as suggested by the Admiralty in their letter, that in estimating the pirapects W.E.Houstoun-Boswall, FSq. , E.C., etc. etc. etc Bagdadof Persian interference with Iraqi trade on the Shatt al Arab, the Iraqi Government should not overlook the advantages which they derive from the interest of His Majesty’s Government in the maintenance of free communications in the Shatt* 3* You should, however, endeavour to avoid having to reply to Hj.s Excellency at all and should leave it to the Iraqi Government to reopen the question* Since the enquiries of the Minister of Foreign Affairs appear to have 'been caused hy the excitement which followed the passing of the legislation necessary to ratify the Frontier Agreement between Iraq and Persia, and with the passage of time this interest in what is, at most, a somewhat remote problem for Iraq, may now have died down, it is possible that the enquiries will not be renewed* I am, etc. (Sd) Lacy Baggallay, (for the Secretary of State)3679a INDIA OFFICE POLITICAL Department.

With Foreign Office letter E 4145/2094/93 of the 16th August, we have recently sent you a’copy of a despatch to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad about the proposals of the Iraci Government for a port under Iraqi control at Eoweit? in v/hich we tell him (as the result of interdepartmental discussion) that the Iraqi proposals are quite unacceptable in their present form and instruct him to say nothing more to the Iraqi Government on the subject; in the hope that they will let it drop. 2. That despatch had scarcely left the Foreign Office when I received a visit from Colonel Sir John Ward; (who is now not only the Director of the Basra port administration; but also the Director-General of the Iraqi Railways); who tells me that he has heard privately from Bagdad that one of the main questions which Tawfiq Suwaidy, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs; will raise when he comes to London early in October will be this very question of a port at Koweit. The Minister will have with him Edmonds ? of the Consular service; the principal British adviser to the Iraqi Government; but Ward has also been warned to remain in England for -the visit. 3. The gist of what Ward had to say was this: His Iraqi employers; who are still obsessed; however unreasonably; with fear of Persia; are exceedingly anxious to secure an alternative outlet to the Ghatt-el-Arab, and for this reason have turned their eyes towards Koweit. Whether or not we are willing to let them have the use of a port at Koweit is a point on/ Peel Esq., M.C./ 2 . on which he has no information, although he realises perfectly well that we are not likely to let them have anything in the nature of an n imperium in imperio 1 ' . If, however s we would like his help in riding them off the idea of Xoweit, he could, he thinks, divert their eyes to the khor Abdullah (i.e. the Khor Shetana mentioned in Admiralty letter M.02976/38 of the 10th June). He, like the Hydrographer of the Navy, is of the opinion that it would he easjf to provide a good anchorage in this inlet, especially in that part lying to the north of Warbah Island. In fact, the expense v/ould probably be far less than the expense of developing Koweit, since, unlike Koweit, there is deep water right up to the shore. Finally the question of rail connexion would be unlikely to present any great difficulty. (A drawback from the Iraqi point of view v/ould probably be that Warbah Island belongs to Koweit. If Iraq could secure this island by making territorial concessions to Koweit elsewhere, and so become the owner of the whole channel, she might have a really fine anchorage of her own. That, however, is looking ahead). 4. furthermore, Ward is of the opinion, if I understood him rightly, that the capacity of the Shatt-el-Arab is rcaching saturation point. Things will be eased a bit if he can dredge the channel to thirty feet, as he hopes to do when he gets the full quota ox si,/v dredgers which he has been aiming at for many years past, and which he hopes to do, notwith standing the pressure which is always being brought to bear on him to reduce the shipping dues, before much longer. But even allowing for this, some additional outlet may soon be necessary. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company for instance are being forced inevitably towards the development of Bandar Shahpur, notwithstanding the additional loading facilities which/M r7 o /-^which they are providing in the 3hatt-el-Arah ? in order to deal with the increased output from the new Persian fields which are now being brought into production. If ; in addition, the Iraqi Petroleum Company were to find oil in the Basra district (for v/hich they have now obtained the concession) or if for any reason e.g. danger to the Haifa pipe-line? it were decided to build a pipe-line from the Kirkuk or Khaniqin oilfields to the Persian Gulf, the only outlet for such oil as could not be shipped from Pao would be through the Khor Abdullah or Koweit. 5. Ward would be glad of some indication of the sort of policy which we ourselves would like to see the Iraqi Government follow. This naturally does not mean that he can make them carry out our wishes whatever these may be? but he will, I know, try to steer clear of anything which we regarded as seriously detrimental to our interests. 6. In these circumstances, it seems to me that the questions which we have to ask ourselves are (a) whether we can, if we need to, prevent the development of either Koweit or the Khor Abdullah: (b) whether, if we must accept such development, we would sooner see an Iraqi port developed at the Khor Abdullah, or see the port of Koweit, developed either by our own efforts or those of Iraq? in some way which would allow Iraq the benefit of its use. 7. I do not think it is necessary to assume from the outset that the Iraqis could not use the port of Koweit unless they were given some degree of control over the administration of the port. That is what they have asked for as an opening gambit, but it is possible to conceive a suitation in which they might be willing at their own expense to build a railway from Zubair to Koweit (Ward is going to have a quiet look at the country, but thinks that/4 1 (J A-y that, apart from occasional flooding? there are no obstacles) 3 and to improve the harbour facilities at Kov/eit, in return (if they could get not ing better) for a free customs zone, which would not need to be very large, and the right to use the port and railway free of charge, or on a r ‘services provided' basis, for a number of years. 8. In this connexion I think the Government of India are a little pessimistic. In their express letter ITo. P.297-11/33 of the 23rd June they say very rightly, in commenting upon Fowle ? c remarks as to the possible advantages of letting the Iraqis use Koweit, that his arguments 'have no validity unless 'Iraq control could be strictly confined to the technical 'management of a port and railway 5 ’', and then proceed “in our ;i opinion such a condition would not be fulfilled, and this “opinion is reinforced by the conversation reported in His 'Majesty’s Ambassador’s despatch To. 162 of the 19th April '1988 (in which he reported that the Iraqi Minister for 'Foreign Affairs had suggested that Koweit should by right ’'belong to Iraq as part of the former Vilayet of Basra).' It may be that there is bound to be some danger in admitting the Iraqis to Koweit in any shape or form. But after all, it is for us to lay down the conditions on which the Iraqis may use Koweit, and if we draw up the conditions with sufficient care, I see no reason why they would obtain any serious degree of influence over the affairs of the Sheikhdom. It is admittedly possible that, if we draw up the conditions as carefully as all that, the Iraqis may lose interest in the Koweiti project, and prefer to build their own port at Khor Abdullah. But assuming for the sake of argument that other trings being equal we would rather see Koweit developed than the Khor Abdullah, the possibility of their not proving willing to use Koweit excepton conditions which we should think unsatisfactory does not seem to he a reason for not making them an offer. 9. As to whether we do or do not want to see Koweit developed; we have already had a certain amount of inter-depart mental discussion and I think it would he fair to say that 5 from that discussion ? three main points emerge: (a) Everyone is agreed that we must do our hest to keep Koweit as a pied a terre for ourselves at the head of, the Persian Gulf ? and.that for this purpose it must remain under British protection and influence and free from the domination or influence of any other country. (h) ITo one is anxious to sec anything done which might have the effect of lessening the volume of the shipping dues upon which the navigability of the Shatt-el-Arab ultimately depends, seeing that the Ghatt-el-Arah is a link of vital importance in our Imperial communications. (c) Insofar, however, as it is possible for such a thing to he done compatibly with (a) and (h), no one would be sorry to see the port of Koweit developed, and connected by rail with Iraq, in such a way as to provide an alter native channel of communication to the Shatt-el-Arab on one section of a route which is becoming increasingly important, at any rate potentially, not only for the despatch of reinforcements to the East, but also for the despatch of reinforcements to the Mediterranean sea-board. 10. 'To these three considerations I would add two more: (d) We cannot in the long run rely upon the use in full security of the route through Iraq, unless the Iraqi Government remain not only our allies, but our willing allies, and we must therefore do our best to meet their natural aspirations in matters to which they at any rate6 attach importance and must, v/here v/e are inevitably forced to obstruct these aspirations 5 do our best to provide them with an alternative form of satisfaction. (e) Whatever arguments v/e may use to show that the Iraqi fears of Persia are groundless, or, even if not entirely groundless, at any rate unnecessary so long as the alliance subsists, the Iraqis are bound to remember that sooner or later the day may come when they will have to stand on their own feet and may not unnaturally wish to take precautions against that day. 11* It is in the light of all these considerations that the problem should, I suggest, be approached. V/hat Ward had to say can to a great extent only be appreciated in the light of technical knov/ledge and it is difficult for anyone in the Foreign Office to know to v/hat extent it need affect any of the views already expressed by the other departments concerned. Similarly, the Foreign Office is in no position to judge whether, if faced with the inevitable necessity of seeing an Iraqi port developed outside the Shatt-el-Arab, we ought to choose Koweit or the Khor Abdullah. But the fact that the Iraqi Government are apparently much more in earnest than v/e had hoped at first does, we feel, make it necessary to reconsider carefully the line which we are to take in discussing the question with them* 12. We are therefore in favour of the whole question being considered further before Taufiq Suwaidi's arrival early in October; and I personally think it would be a good thing if we were to have a meeting - perhaps a Middle East (Official) meeting - before then. 13. I do not wish to anticipate too far the discussion at the meeting; but the sort of line we would like to see taken would be as follows:- d)/c (1) \7e should tell ward that if the Iraqis pursue the idea of a port outside the Shatt-el-Arah, for whatever reason 5 we would sooner they developed Kov/eit than the Khor Abdullah (or vice versa ? as the case may be). (2) If the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs raises the point we should toll him (if it remains the considered opinion of the other departments that we do not want an Iraqi port outside the 3hatt-el-Arab if we can help it): (i) that we do not think the Iraqis really need such a port - the alliance * expenses etc. - but that if they are really set on it we would not for a moment wish to oppose them and either (ii)(a) that although we cannot agree to anything which would infringe the political or administrative rights of Kov/eit, we would not be averse, for our part, to discuss an arrangement v/hereby the Iraqis could, have a free zone at Kov/eit, on the analogy of many similar arrangements elsewhere, the necessary railway and harbour facilities being provided either by them at their own expense or by us and recovered from them through dues etc. in she ordinary course of business. or (ii)(b) that we regret we cannot, however, admit any foreign State- to previleges of the kind for which they have asked in Kov/eit and therefore think they might consider the possibilities of the Khor Abdullah which we believe are very hopeful. 14. A decision of some sort is necessary, because although the line already given to His Majesty’s Charge d*Affaires to use in the event of the Iraqis themselves returning to the charge in Bagdad (that His Majesty’s Government do not see how the plan put forward could function without infringing the rights of the Sheikh of Koweit) is all right as far as it goes, it will//ill not 1)0 sufficient if the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs presses the question seriously here and says, in reply to any such statement ’’Well let’s consider how it can he made compatible with his rights”. 15. Will you let me know as soon as possible if you agree that a meeting should be held, without prejudice to any views you may wish to express at that meeting? 16.

There is however the point about Warbah Island 9 bar bah Island is a lov» one intersected with creeks as is the North end of J Bubiyan Island, and is hardly, at certain tides, distinguish able from it. It was for this reason that Warbah Island was always considered to g) v;i th Bubiyan, the existing maps not giving an accurate picture. If Kuwait gave haroah to the Iraqis, although what advantage will be to them, I fail to understand, as they could be permitted to use the whole channel, they would I suppose eventallly refer to Warbah as being in reality inseparable from bubiyan, and demand it as w ell. Nev-^r b f we had to persudade the Sheikh to give up Warbah, it would I think be infinitely preferable from our point of view (if we wish to maintain 'a pied-a-terre, for ourselves at the head of the Persian Gulf, under British protection. /protection, and influence, and free from the domination &gt;r influence of any other country”, which I see is noted, in para 9 ii. of 3 ? oreign Office letter, as one of the official disiderata decided uoon at the Inter rdapartmen tal conferences) to have the .) ! Irakis at Xhor Abdulla tran adhere in the Kuwait Bay* 5. If however for the reason given in para 10 of the letter or any other reason, and I would include as a reason the welfare and attachment to us of 'uwui t as one, we wish to see the Kuwait port developed, I think it should be ourselves, the protecting power, who should take the lead. If we can get Ibn Saud to call off the blockade and if in addition, Irac will guarantee Kuwait, as presumably she would, a certain minimum volume of trade through Kuwait, I believe that there would be a sound economic proposition for a Port Trust or Company, perhaps caTi'TtaJsp to make and operate a Kuwait port. The Sheikh and his Council are already speaking of some such schemes on their own, wi th a BritL di engineer to help them, but money is lacking, and neither Saudi nor Iraqi trade yet assured* 6. I think Ibn Saud would not cavil at such a development but I believe that he would be if we allow tlie Iraqi to develop a port in Kuwait territory, fliatever the conditions, he would certainly be surprised when he heard that it was proposed that, while the technical control of -asra port remains British, the technical/ ^^' l ~ 1 y supported by t iie 3ri ti sh Gover nmen t,technical control in Kuwait port was to be Iraqi/#-**/ 7. i O-r]r&lt;X UAjlA a ^jt' ts Cur^r 4^ I'dj^'sfU C In such raa tt (the question of w&amp; jtrt* for Kuwait is £ another) the initiative i:i this should^ I suggest, rest with Great 3T±z&amp;in, and not wi 1 Cabinet of I&gt;aq&lt; 8 . The answer therefore to my mind is that the Iraqis had better develop Iho, or the Khor Abdulla, and if they do not wish to io so they could enquire for some arrangement whereby Kuwait would build a Railway to the frontier, on guarantees from them governing the minimum tonnage to be carried, wi Hi return guarantee from Kuwait concerning dues. Kean while we (rtr a should I think, in any case^ prepare A for the early development J of Kuwait with our assistance, and if the Sheikh agrees, .said -out—engineers w make a survey report and apnroximate estimate for (a) the harbour and wort development and (b) water possibilities. In the latter connection I have written to you separately. In the case of the former the engineer should , I think be a person not connected with the Iraqi Government, which would make his enquiries suspect, and t lead to undesirable rumours'and exitement.

Mr. Houstoun-Boswall to Viscount Halifax -- (Received September 19) (No. 438) My Lord Bagdad, September 7, 1938. I HAVE the honour to report that when I saw the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 6th September he said that he had been axious to speak to me about Koweit, with special reference to the desire of the Iraqi Government to establish a port there, and he proceeded to elaborate the familiar arguments about the vulnerability of Iraqi interests in the Shatt-el-Arab. It was thus fortunate that I had received your Lordshipfe despatch No. 462 of the 15th August, which enabled me to inform the Minister that His Majesty’s Government had given very close study to the proposal as presented to Mr. Morgan, and on another occasion to His Majesty’s Ambassador, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs last March, but that the scheme on the lines suggested did not commend itself to them because it was felt that the rights of the sheikh might be infringed thereby. I also added that the Iraqi Government could rest assured that free communications in the Shatt would be maintained, as the interests of Iraq and of her allies were there identical. The Minister was clearly disappointed. He said that the Cabinet had considered the question several times lately, and that, indeed, the Minister for foreign Affairs proposed to take up the question with your Lordship this month in London, as stated in my confidential letter to Mr. Baxter of the 23rd August, and in the enclosure to my despatch No. 410 of the 29th August. He went on to say that there had been some suggestion of linking this question with that of the sheikh’s properties in Iraq, but I think I wassuccessful in persuading him that any such move would, to say the least of it, be very bad tactics (the Director-General for Foreign Affairs also mentioned this to me last week and showed that he entirely shared my view). Saiyid Abbas Mahdi also said that his Government would proceed to elaborate some other scheme to secure an outlet to the sea through Koweit, for they were genuinely perturbed at the possibility of Persian interference with Iraqi trade on the Shatt-al-Arab and felt very strongly that it was their duty to do everything possible to obviate any such risk. He would write to me on the subject after consulting his colleagues, who would no doubt send further instructions to Saiyid Taufiq-al-Suwaidi. 2* I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and to His Excellency the Governor-General of India.

Sir J. v/ard has asked to be given in confidence some indication of His Majesty's Government’s views, since it will be useful to him to know whether, if the Iraqi Government pursue the idea of a port outside the Shatt-el-Arab, we would rather that they developed Koweit than the Khor Abdullah, or vice versa . 2. You may speak to Sir J. Ward in confidence on following lines. Result of interdepartmental discussions shows that neither alternative need be ruled out on political grounds. Purely practical difficulties of building a modern port on Bay of Koweit would, however, be very great. At Koweit itself it would be very expensive to carry out necessary developments, which would include dredging on large scale, and building of a breakwater five miles long. A new port to the North of Kov/eit Bay would seem even less practicable, since ships must anchor three miles from the shore, and lighterage would be impossible in a strong southerly wind. On the other hand, Khor Abdullah appears from Admiralty charts, which are based on survey of 1911 and will require verifi cation, to be very suitable, with a deep water approach of at least 21 feet, and good anchorage next the shore. From Iraqi point of view, there seems every advantage in first examining Khor Abdullah, which is unquestionably more hopeful than anywhere in Koweit, could be developed at far less expense, and would be far closer to existing Iraqi railway system. 5. Reply to Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, if he raises the question, will be based on the foregoing considerations.(s^ ft mst. INDIA OFFICE, Department.

Sir, With reference to the recent discussion at the Middle East (Official) Suh-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence regarding the desire of the Iraqi Government for an additional commercial outlet to the sea, I am directed hy Viscount Halifax to transmit to you herewith, for the consideration of the Marquess of Zetland, the record of a conversation on this subject at the Foreign Office with the Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs. 2. It will he seen that in this conversation Taufiq Suwaidi said that the Iraqi Government would examine the possibilities of Khor Abdullah, but that if they decided to develop a port on that inlet they might require certain concessions from the Sheikh of Koweit, and that they would like to be assured in advance that the Sheikh of Krweit would be prepared to agree to an alteration in the existing frontier, in so far as this might be necessary. It will further be seen that when it was pointed out to His Excellency that if the Iraqi Government wished the Sheikh to cede to them a part of his territory they would have to make an offer to compensate him elsewhere, he urged that he might be allowed to approach the Sheikh in the first place direct, The Under-Secretary of State, India Office* IN LETTER No. 2* OCT 1930 FTC t SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND 'T DF - N«piA OFFICEinsufficient, or that the Iraqi Government were bringing pressure on him to conclude an unfair bargain, he would naturally be able to inform His Majesty’s Government accordingly, and request their assistance in the negotiations. 5. I am accordingly to suggest that the Iraqi Government might be informed that it will in the first place be for them to state exactly what concessions they will require from the Gheikh of Koweit, and that if their requirements appear to be reasonable His Majesty's Government will be prepared to inform the Gheikh that they have no objection to his discussing informally with the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs the question of the compensation which he would be prepared to accept. 6. Lord Halifax assumes that in the meantime nothing will be said to the Sheikh to give him an enhanced idea of the value which such concessions as he may be asked to make would have for the Iraqi Government. 7.

Copy No. [Amended Copy.] Record of Conversation with the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs held at the Foreign Office at 6 p.m. on October 4, 1938. Present: Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs. Major Edmonds (British adviser to the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior). Mr. Baxter, Foreign Office. Mr. Crosthwaite, Foreign Office. Mr. Baxter enquired whether the Iraqi Foreign Minister wished to begin by discussing in detail the matters which formed the subject of the aide-memoire handed by his Excellency to Mr. Butler at Geneva, or whether there were any other matters arising out of that morning’s conversation with the Secretary of State which his Excellency wished to discuss. The Iraqi Foreign Minister said that he would like to discuss in detail the subjects dealt with in his aide-memoire. Aerodrome Guards. As regards the question of aerodrome guards, Taufiq Suwaidi referred to the delay which had taken place in giving effect to article 4 of the annexure to the Angio-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance. It was true that various proposals had been made since the entry into force of that treaty in 1932, but some of these proposals were not in accordance with the provisions or the intention of the treaty. Discus sions had taken place at Bagdad in 1935, and a certain measure of agreement had been reached, but there were still two outstanding points on which the views of His Majesty’s Government had never been received. It was with a view to providing a solution of the whole problem that he had now suggested that the aerodrome guards should be detached either from the regular Iraqi army (in which case the commanding officer would be a British officer attached to the British military mission) or from the Iraqi police. In either case, the Iraqi military or police forces would be placed under the control of the British Air Officer Commanding, and in addition, if the forces were to be provided by the Iraqi army, there would be a British commanding officer. He thought that a solution on these lines would be entirely in accordance with the treaty. Mr. Baxter drew attention to the provisions of the treaty article, stating that the special guards should be provided “ upon such conditions as may be agreed upon between the high contracting parties,' and that the Iraqi Government would “ secure the enactment of such legislation as might be necessary for the fulfilment of the conditions referred to above.” Various efforts had been made to reach agreement as to the nature of this legislation to be introduced by the Iraqi Government. The last proposals, it would be recalled, had been handed to the Iraqi Government by Sir M. Peterson in May last. It did not appear that the Iraqi Government had yet replied to that communication, and it was there fore only now that His Majesty’s Government learnt that these proposals were unacceptable to the Iraqi Government. As regards the proposals now put forward by Taufiq Suwaidi, it was regretted that neither was entirely welcome to the British authorities concerned. The main difficulty was, to speak perfectly frankly, the problem of the control of these aerodrome guards. His Excellency had stated that they would be under the control of the Air Officer Commanding, but in certain respects these guards, being part of the Iraqi military or police forces, would also be under the direct control of the Iraqi Government. It seemed to the British authorities concerned that this divided control might lead to difficulties and disputes between the British [430 e—2] b'2 and Iraqi authorities, wmcn it would be in the best interests of both the British and Iraqi Governments if possible to avoid. His Majesty’s Government, however, realised the difficulties in the way of reaching an agreed settlement on the lines hitherto followed, and had therefore been giving active consideration to an entirely difterent solution of the problem®' which, if it proved practicable, would no doubt be welcome to the Iraqi Govern ment; that was that His Majesty’s Government should waive their right to ask the Iraqi Government to provide special guards, and that the Royal Air Force should themselves provide for their own ground defence without maintaining the present levies or any other force composed of Iraqi subjects. Before definite proposals to this effect could be made, however, various practical difficulties would have to be examined. During a recent tour of the Middle Fast undertaken by the Under-Secretary of State for Air, a senior officer of the Air Ministry accompanied him to discuss this problem with the authorities in Iraq, but unfortunately, owing to the international crisis, they had to be recalled when they had got as far as Palestine. But the British authorities would continue to consider the question as rapidly as possible. Taufiq Suwaidi said that this was an entirely new suggestion, and he could not say how the Iraqi Government would regard it. He would at once telegraph to Bagdad and might possibly receive some indication of the Iraqi Government's views in the course of a day or two. ^ Registration of Land Occupied by the Port of Basra. ^ The Foreign Office representatives regretted that they were not yet in a position to discuss this problem, and that if it proved impossible to give his Excellency a reply before he left London a reply would, in any case, be sent to him at Bagdad at an early date. Taufiq Suwaidi saM he was sure that, if the Iraqi Government repaid the outstanding instalment ot the port loan, there could be no objection to registering the land in the name of the Iraqi Government. He hoped that it might even be possible for His Majesty's Government to agree to his proposal without insisting upon the immediate repayment of the loan. Such a gesture on their part would he much appreciated in Iraq. Koweit. (The Secretary of State, in the course of his meeting with the Iraqi Foreign Minister m the morning of the 4th October, had told his Excellency that His Majesty’s Government would find it difficult to admit any Iraqi claim, if the Iraqi Government were ever to put forward such a claim, to sovereignty over Koweit ; and the Iraqi Foreign Minister had agreed not to insist on discussing this point, to which a reference had been made in the aide-memoire which he had 4 communicated as a basis for discussion.) ^ Mr. Baxter referred to the reference in Taufiq Suwaidi's aide-memoire to Koweit as a centre for extensive arms traffic and smuggling. He would like to consider, in the first place, the statement that there was an important illegal traffic in arms into Iraq. Hitherto, ne believed, His Majesty’s Government had not received any evidence to show that any such smuggling of arms was, in fact, taking place. In fact, the British authorities in the Persian Gulf seemed to be fairly sure that no arms were now entering Koweit, at all events by sea. He asked whether the Iraqi Government were able to produce any evidence to show that smuggling of arms did, in fact, take place through Koweit. J aufq Suwaidi replied that the Iraqi Government were convinced that arms smuggling from Koweit into Iraq had, in fact, assumed serious proportions, and he thought that the Iraqi Government could produce evidence of this. He’was, in any case, quite certain that arms were on sale in Koweit in large quantities and at very cheap prices, and that there was nothing to prevent anyone who liked from buying arms freely in the open market and trying to smuggle them across the Iraqi frontier. Ma]or Edmonds added that, to his personal knowledge, as a result of his conversations with Iraqi tribesmen, it was quite a frequent occurrence for an Arab to buy a rifle in Koweit for £5 or £6 and to travel with it to Iraq, wherehe would sell it for about twice that amount. The fact was that Koweit had become a recognised market where Arabs, whether would-be smugglers or not, went to purchase arms. He was quite prepared to believe that the British authorities in the Persian Gulf were right when they said that no arms entered Koweit by sea, but it was absolutely certain that somehow or other these arms were ■available for sale in Koweit. Mr. Baxter said that His Majesty s Government would certainly be prepared to give the whole question their earnest attention if the Iraqi Government would, m fact, be good enough to produce all the evidence in their possession. At a later stage in the discussion, Major Edmonds suggested that His Majesty’s Government might be prepared to consider a solution whereby substan- uai restrictions wouiu oe placed on the sale of arms in the Koweiti market. He thought that in Muscat, before the war, His Majesty’s Government had insisted that all the arms available for sale in that territory should be collected and stored in one special warehouse under Government supervision, and that the sale of these arms should be subjected to some form of Government control. He suggested that some such system in Koweit might be the most effective method of dealing with the situation which had arisen. 3/r. Boater said that this suggestion would receive further consideration. As regards other forms of smuggling, Mr. Baxter wished to point out in the nrst place that it was really entirely for the Government of a country to see that smuggling into its territory did not take place. The Iraqi Foreign Minister had put lorward three suggestions. The first was for a customs union between Iraq and Koweit. This did not seem to His Majesty’s Government to be an acceptable solution, since such an arrangement between a large State like Iraq and a small State like Koweit might be expected to undermine the independence of the smaller Taufrq Suwaidi said that he did not think that there was much foundation tor this fear. He said that for many years now the Iraqi authorities had run the Koweiti postal administration, this had not, he thought, made any difference to the political position of the sheikhdom, and he did not see why it should make any difference if the Iraqi authorities also took over the Koweiti customs administration. Koweit would, of course, be offered a fixed annual sum in lieu of its present customs revenue. He thought that the Koweitis themselves would be very ready to accept such a suggestion. Mr. Baxter said that the Iraqi Foreign Minister’s second suggestion, that the northern frontier line of Koweit should be fixed further south so as to give the Iraqi preventive services more space in which to operate, seemed also to be unacceptable. This suggestion would apparently involve the cession to Iraq of about one-third of Koweit, and it was difficult to see what compensation could be given to the sheikh elsewhere. Taufiq Suwaidi said that, if the suggestion of a customs union between Iraq and Koweit were found to be possible, it would not be necessary further to consider this alternative. Mr. Baxter proceeded that, as regards the Iraqi Foreign Minister’s third solution, he understood that the proposal of combined preventive operations had already been put forward some months ago. The Sheikh of Koweit had stated on that occasion that he was willing to negotiate with the Iraqi Government when he had reached an agreement with the Saudi Government regarding the raising of their blockade. These negotiations had been proceeding fairlv satisfactorily of late. Taufiq Suwaidi interjected that he did not see what these negotiations between Koweit and Saudi Arabia had to do with Iraq. In reply to the question whether the Iraqi Government had any special measures in mind in connexion with the proposed anti-smuggling agreement with Koweit, Taufiq Suwaidi seemed to think that it might be possible to induce the sheikh, who had no armoured cars, &amp;c., to contribute to the proposed joint preventive operations, to share the cost of these operations. It was pointed out to him that the sheikh would not be likely to agree to any such proposal. [430 e—2] B 24 Mr. Baxter informed his Excellency that His Majesty’s Government had, in tact received an expert report, from which it appeared that the Iraqi authorities might be able to give smuggling from Koweit a decisive blow if they were to take certain additional measures, £.y., control by aeroplanes and armoured cars, together with drastic measures against those organisations or individuals in Iraq \\ho must be assisting in smuggling on such a large scale as had been suggested by his Excellency. ' Taufiq Suwaidi thought that the Iraqi Government had already taken all such measures as were in their power. There were numbers of armoured cars, troops and police engaged in anti-smuggling measures, and all this was involving u ^vernment in serious expenditure. The position apparently was that the bheikh 01 Koweit would take no action whatever, because, of course, he had nothing to gam from doing so; on the contrary, Tie was,HI anythlrigfmaking'a ' large piont, for a large part of the customs levied on goods entering Koweit (which might subsequently be smuggled into Iraq) went into his own pocket. From the Iraqi point of view it was an unbearable situation. Major Edmonds suggested that the difficulty might be overcome if the Koweiti customs tariff were increased to the level of the Iraqi tariff. The main cause of the smuggling was that the Koweiti tariff was so low. He thought that possibly the Sheikh of Koweit was precluded from raising it by his treaties with His Majesty’s Government. If it was impossible to agree to a customs union between the Sheikh of Koweit and the Iraqi Government, could it not at least be arranged that the two Administrations, even though remaining entirely independent, should impose the same tariff, i.e., the Iraqi tariff ? ’ Taufiq Suwaidi added that in that case the Iraqi Government would no doubt wish to assure themselves that the higher tariff was being applied in Koweit in fact as well as in theory, and also that smuggling into Koweit was not taking place on a large scale. He thought that this difficulty might be overcome if an Iraqi customs official, perhaps one of the British officials attached to the Iraqi customs administration, could be attached to the Koweiti customs administration. Mr. Baxter undertook that this suggestion would be examined further. Iraqi Government's Wish for a new Port on the Persian Gulf. Mr. Baxter drew attention to the fear expressed by the Iraqi Foreign Minister lest there should be serious interference by Persia with navigation on the Shatt- el-Arab. He enquired the nature of the Iraqi Government’s fears on this point. Surely they did not expect some hostile act on the part of Persia, at all events in peace-time ? Taufiq Suwaidi replied with references to the violent tendencies of Persian policy as directed by the present Shah. He referred to the difficulties that had already arisen with Persia regarding the Shatt-el-Arab, and to the use of that waterway by Persian warships. Mr. Baxter suggested that in time of peace it was improbable that Persian warships would commit hostile acts against Iraqi shipping using the waterway between Basra and the sea. Such an act of aggression seemed very unlikely, at least so long as the Anglo-lraqi Alliance was maintained. In time of war, also, the Persian Government seemed to be unlikely to adopt a violently hostile attitude towards the British and Iraqi Governments, since they would be anxious to maintain the revenues resulting from their sales to us of Persian oil. On the other hand, His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated the desire of the Iraqi Government to secure an additional commercial outlet on the sea. They had no desire at all to stand in the way of such a project, and they had carefully gone into the Iraqi Government’s wishes. The information at the disposal of the British authorities concerned showed that Koweit itself was not suitable for development as a modern port, and such development would be very expensive; it would involve dredging on a large scale, and the construction of a long breakwater, in addition to the provision of ordinary harbour works. Any other place in Koweit Bay would be even less suitable, since at present ships could not anchor nearer than 3 miles from the shore, and when the south-east wind blew lighterage would be impossible. On the other hand, Khor Abdullah appeared from the charts (which would, however, require confirmation, since they were based on a5 # survey made so long ago as 1911), to be very well suited to development as a modern port. There seemed to be a deep water approach of at least 21 feet the whole way, and a deep water anchorage next the shore. Khor Abdullah thus seemed to be much the best site from the point of view of the Iraqi Government. Ilts development would almost certainly be less expensive, and it would be nearer the Iraqi railway system. The Iraqi Government would, therefore, do well, in the first place, to examine the possibilitv of meeting their requirements by the con struction of a port at Khor Abdullah. 1 aujiq Suivaidi replied that the Iraqi Government would certainly examine the possibilities of Khor Abdullah, but if they decided to develop a port on that inlet they might require certain concessions from the Sheikh of Koweit, and they would like to be assured in advance, before embarking upon any expenditure, &amp;c., that the Sheikh of Koweit would be prepared to agree to an alteration in the existing frontier, in so far as this might be necessary. Mr. Baxter suggested that first it would be necessary for the Iraqi Govern ment to decide exactly what they would have to ask from the Sheikh of Koweit. If they wished the sheikh to cede to them a part of his territory, e.g., the small island of Warbah and the navigable channel between that island and the open sea, they would have to make an offer to compensate him elsewhere. For this purpose it would be desirable that the Iraqi Government’s offer should be made as attractive as possible to the sheikh; it would be well that the compensation offered should quite evidently exceed in value the territory which they were asking 1 the sheikh to cede. Taufiq Suwaidi asked if he might get into direct touch with the Sheikh of Koweit on this question. Mr. Baxter replied that His Majesty’s Government would prefer that any official approach should be made through them. Taufiq Suwaidi urged, nevertheless, that he might be allowed in the first place to approach the Sheikh of Koweit, whom he knew personally, and discuss the matter privately with him. He was sure that this would be the best procedure for reaching agreement. He, as a fellow Arab, would know how best to put the matter to the sheikh, and induce him to accept some reasonable arrangement. But he would like to be able to tell the sheikh that this private approach was being made with the knowledge and approval of His Majesty’s Government. The official proposals would be made later, and through us if we wished. Mr. Baxter replied that he must maintain the view that any official approaqii should be made through His Majesty’s Government, and added that further con sideration would be given to the proposal that a preliminary private discussion should take place between Taufiq Suwaidi and the sheikh, with the knowledge and approval of His Majesty’s Government.

You will recall that since this matter was raised last year, it has gone through the following stages. (1) When Taufiq Suwaidi, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, was in London in October, he was informed that the information at the disposal of the British Authorities concerned showed that the Khor Abdullah appeared much more suitable for development as a modern port than any site in the Bay of XiOY/eit. (2) Taufiq Suwaidi pointed out that if the Iraqi Government decided to develop a port on the Khor Abdullah, they might require certain concessions from the Sheikh of Koweit, and he enquired whether any objection would be seen to the Iraqi Government making a private approach direct to the Sheikh, with a view to reaching some reasonable arrangement with him. (3) After consultation with the Government of India, it was agreed that no objection need be raised to this procedure. (4) In view of the change of government in Iraq, it was, however, decided that the Embassy at Bagdad need not take the initiative in informing the Iraqis accordingly, and (5) meanwhile Sir John Ward was carrying out a new survey of the ?Ihor Abdullah. C.G.Jarrett, Esq., Admiralty.3. Ward, who is now on leave, has called at the Foreign Office and left the attached chart of the Khor Abdullah which shows the results of the new survey. He explained that he had throughout treated the matter as one of the greatest secrecy, in the first place because he wished His Majesty's Government to have a chance to consider any requirements they might have before the Iraqis began to take too lively an interest in the possibilities of the new port; in the second place because it seemed undesiracle at the present stage to arouse the curiosity of the Sheikh o j K oweit. He had, therefore, specially asked General ITuri not to write to him on the subject and even his own subordinates had not been told the real reasons for his surveying operations. The explanation that he had offered for general consumption of the movements of his survey ship was that the Port authorities wished to test throughout the whole area the effects of dumping from the dredgers of the Fao service, and he had left definite instructions with his deputy at Basra, Captain Garstin, not to communicate his copy of the chart to the Iraqi authorities until Ward's own return to Iraq. 4. In brief, the survey had, Ward said, shown (a) that there is a channel never shallower than 19 feet at low water (i.e. some 29 feet at high water). This is quite adequate for most of the ships that use the Persian Gulf. With a very little dredging it could be made navigable at all tides, and as there is no silt brought down to ohe Khor Abdullah from upstream, the dredging operations, once completed, would not have to be repeated, or at most wouie only have to be repeated at long intervals.n 3. (b) that there are two good sites for a port on the right bank of the Khor Abdullah, one on the north, one on the south side of the Tin Kasr creek; the creek itself could, with the existing dredgers of the Port of Basra easily be made into an excellent basin: so far as he could judge from the air, the southern site was rather more suitable, but with the expenditure of some money the northern site too should prove quite adequate: Ward was not quite clear where the frontier reached the Khor Abdullah, but he thought that both the northern site and the creek itself were in Iraq, while the southern site was in Xoweit. (c) That so far as he could make out, there should be no difficulty in extending the Iraqi railway system down to the Khor Abdullah, and that meanwhile there was a good surface for motor traffic. The examination had in fact settled once for all the question where Iraq should look, if she wished an outlet to the sea. 5 . Ward further explained that before the completion of the survey he had himself inclined to the view that there was no very satisfactory site for a port on Iraqi territory. Hence Taufiq Suwaidi’s reference to possible cessions from Koweit. ITow anything of the sort had apparently proved to be, strictly speaking, unnecessary, although if the site to the south of the creek turned out to be greatly superior to the site on the north, and if it was in fact in Koweit, the Iraqis might wish to secure it for themselves. Moreover, it would, of course, from the Iraqi point of view prove more satisfactory if such adjustments/'1 4. adjustments could Toe made in the frontier as v/ould give them sole control of the channel, and thereby avoid the possibility of the same complications arising with Eoweit in the future as had already risen with Persia over the Shatt al Arab. Ward added that so far as he himself was concerned he did not attach great importance to this' second point, since so long as Iraq remained an ally of His Majesty’s Government, they would no doubt ensure that Koweit’s interest in the water-way did not cause inconvenience. 6 . General Huri had shown considerable interest in the survey. Ward had, indeed, no idea whether the Iraqi Government was seriously contemplating any scheme that would involve expenditure on a considerable scale, but he was himself convinced that the site on the Khor Abdullah was in any case likely to play an important rdle in the future. If at any time the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had to move out of the Shatt, the port of Basra might for financial reasons find difficulty in keeping up the dredging service on the existing scale, and if this was not done the channel would rapidly silt up and revert to its pre-War state. The maintenance of the Khor Abdullah would be a very much less expensive task, and the time might come when all the big traffic in the Gulf would go either to Bandar Shahpur or to the Khor Abdullah, while only light craft would continue to use the Shatt. On the other hand, if the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company remained at Abadan, there was the fact that the Shatt was nearing saturation point, while it was only natural to suppose that the volume oi Iraqi import and export trade would go on increasing. If oil is found in South Iraq the problem might become urgent. 7./n 5. 7. That however, was in the future. Meanwhile Ward was confident that if additional, or alternative, port facilities were required in an emergency, he could arrange for them to he provided at very short notice indeed. The essential requirements could he supplied from reserves held at Basra and adequate communications could he provided hy motor transport from Zuheir. 8 . From all this the following points seem to emerge:- (a) 1/Ve should note, for possible use in an emergency, that it will he feasible to provide facilities on the Khor Abdullah without much preparatory work. (h) We should try to get the facts about the frontier clear in our minds, and consider whether we ought to approach the Iraqis now with a view to getting an agreed definition of it, or whether it would he preferable to leave the matter alone for the time being so far as they are concerned. (c) If the result of our enquiries is to shew that the more southerly of the two sites is in Koweit, whereas the more northerly is in Iraq, we should consider whether from our point of view v/e should wish Ward to advise the Iraqi authorities that this may he the better site provided that they can come to a political arrangement with Koweit such as would justify them in developing it as their new port; or, alternatively, whether he would do well to take the line that as the northern site is unquestionably in Iraq, and as it should be perfeetly practicable to develop a good port there, the simplest plan will certainly be to decide in its favour* (d) Wo should in any case consider whether from our point/point of view it would be preferable to arrange for Iraq to have sole control of the new port and its approaches or whether we would wish her ' iel with obscure. in the note of Jul __ General liuri to Sir F. Humphrys the definition given is as follows:- '-••to a point just south of the latitude of Safv/an; thence eastwards passing south of Safwan Wells, Jebel Sanam and Uli Qasr leaving them to Iraq and so on to the junction of the Khor Zobeir with the Khor Abdullah. The islands of Warbah, Bubiyan...appertain to Koweit'. In a despatch which we have recently received from Bagdad, it is suggested that this definition should, in the interests of clarity, and by agreement with the Iraqi Government be expanded as follows The * junction of the Khor Zobeir with the Khor Abdullah’ shall mean the junction of the thalweg of the Khor Zobeir with the thalweg of the north westerly arm of the Khor Abdullah known as the Khor Shetana. From the above mentioned junction of thalwegs to the open sea the boundary shall follow the thalw eg of the Khor Abdullah. ,f 10. It is not quite clear to us that this expanded definition will be sufficient to fix the frontier. It seems that the Knor coheir and the Khor Shetana form one channel, and are in fact both parts of what is known as the Khor Abdullah. Where then is the junction of their thalwegs ? It may be that the Khor Shetana begins where the Khor Sabiyah (? or the Khor Koweit. 9» The position regarding ; to us very Bubiyan) joins the main channel. If thi s is so, it would seern preferable to make this clear in any improved definition of the point. For is it clear how the line from the point ’’south of Safwan/1 7. Saf^an” to the junction of the two Khor is drawn. In the 1932 definition it is said to run ''eastwards 11 hut it is clear from any ■map that it does not run due east, or anything like it. The natural assumption would he that it is a straight line between the two points? hut if the junction of the Khor is opposite the mouth of the fvhor Sabi yah? a straight line from there to a point just south of Safwan would apparently, owing to the bend in the Khor Sobeir, include a part of the left bank of the Khor in Koweit. So far as we know, however, no one has disputed that the whole left bank belongs to Iraq.. 12. In spite of these difficulties, it certainly seems that, as ’7ard believes, the Urn Kasr creek and therefore the site to the north of it, is in Iraq, t/hat is doubtful, is whether the site on the south is in Koweit. j Whether, when we are clear ourselves as to where the frontier 1 j;s, we should approach the Iraqis forthwith with a view to securing its definition, depends, I think to a considerable extent on our vieves about points (c) and (d) above. lu. As ■ p ar as point (c) is concerned, it will I imagine be common ground that we have no sort of interest in trying to prevent the Iraqis from constructing a port on the Khor Abdullan if they wish to do so- 1 /e gave the idea our sympathy last autumn and so far I know, there is no reason why we should change our views. On toe contrary, T - T c should in principle sho*:* ourselves as sympathetic as possible towards their wishes to establish a new port. 13* At first sight it would appear that if the Iraqis can make an adequate port within their existing frontiers, this will be all to the good. For if, on the other hand, they want to construct their new port on what is now- Koweit territory, there will have to be an alteration in the present frontier, and this is bound to lend to difficult negotiations bet'een Iraq and Koweit. But this briiigs us to the question whether there will not in any case have to l*e so, no alb oration in the pro sent frontier in order to ensure that/8. that in the Khor Abdullah, unlike the Shatt-el-Arat, Iraq shall have complete and undisputed control over the whole of the port area and over the whole of the waterway connecting it with the open sea. lo. Y/e thus come to point (d). We must make up our minds what part, if any, we wish Xoweit to play in the development and administration of the new port. It may he best that Koweit should -go some extent participate in any new schemes that may be devised in the Khor Abdullah. Or it may be best that Iraq should be allowed to exercise exclusive control. The Iraqis will naturally wish for exclusive control, and it will be hard to persuade them to agree to anything less than this. 17. The first and most obvious objection to exclusive Iraqi control is no doubt the fact that the Iraqis would expect the Sheikh of Koweit to surrender, or at least to refrain from exercising, some of his existing rights over the water-way, and io would be difficult to find any quid pro quo that they could offer him for the necessary concessions on his part. If these were go include the cession of some part of his territory as well cxb of nis rights over txie waterway, the difficulty of finding any -9AL : L ( i...Hf? 9 . u0 wiild pe very great indeed. Moreover, even if something suitable were found, it might not be easy to induce the oheikxx bo accept the bargain. There may also be objections to a orange in the status quo either on strategic grounds, or on the grounds Gnat it is in principle undesirable, in viev/ of tne propaganda that has been going on in Iraq for the absorption Oj. Kov/eib, that Iraq should be enabled to acquire from the Sheikh any concession of potential value to her. In/9, In addition to this, we may well ask ourselves whether we can count indefinitely on the continuance of our present position in Iraq., whereas our relations with Koweit are presumably on a more permanent basis. Again, it is conceivable that Koweit might at some future date herself wish to establish a Koweiti port in the Khor Abdullah, and in any case might not wish to deprive herself for ever of the possibility of establishing such a port. Moreover, it may be thought that Koweiti participation in some kind of Harbour Board, (if the Iraqis can be got to agree to that) may seem a useful guarantee for the future. 18. On the other hand, unless the production of oil in Koweit develops in a spectacular way, it seems unlikely that Koweit 1 s trade is by itself sufficient to justify the creation of a new port, even on a small scale, so far from the town. If there is not going to be a Koweiti port there in the foreseeable future, the Sheikh might well be f reluctant to incur any expenditure or responsibility in connexion with the control of the waterway. Moreover, so far as our imperial communications are concerned, it is not clear what use a port in friendly territory would be unless a safe route to the Mediterranean could also be guaranteed. In fact, Koweit by itself would not seem toj provide an adequate alternative to a friendly Iraq. 19. Complete Iraqi control of the new outlet: to the sea would presumably be a great simplification frorft the practical, point of view and will probably be regarded as essential by the Iraqis. If we oppose their wishes in this respect, the political consequences may be ver*y serious« 20 . There is one further point which has occurred to Let us assume that there is a growing Iraqi port on/ us.N /-s 10. on the Khor Abdullah, and that the Sheikh, v/hile maintaining his rights, is not himself in a position to construct a port of his own there, or make use of the waterway. The result would only too likely he the development of yet another source of grievance between the two countries, and those quarters in Iraq, who, for no particular reason except prestige already look forward to the annexation of Koweit, v/ould then he able to find persuasive arguments in support of their views. Taking the long view then, it is arguable that the Sheikh mignt he well advised, if he suffers thereby no real loss, to withdraw in time from this potential source of trouble. 21. These are, however, all matters on which other Government Departments will have their views. I am accordingly sending copies of this letter to Shuckburgh at the Colonial Office, Peel at the India Office, Coryton at the Air Ministry, Mallaby at the War Office, Starling at the Petroleum Department, Weston at the Board of Trade, and Porter at the Committee of Imperial Defence. If they agree, I v/ould suggest that the matter might oe considered at a meeting of the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee some time before Ward returns to Iraq, understand that this will be early in September.

You are aware that work has been going on for sometime in connection with the survey of the Khor Abdulla and I submit herewith a very brief report and a Hydrographical Survey of the Khor Abdulla from Urn Qasr to Warbah Spit. The survey has been carefully done in spite of the most unpleasant conditions which prevailed in the winter months during the stormy weather which made the task most arduous. It will be seen from a careful study of the chart that from a marine point of view the building of a Port just below Urn Qasr Creek presents no great difficulty. The range and strength of the tides are, when compared with those in the Shat—el*”Arab more difficult, neither is the surrounding country anything like so pleasant^ but it is, in my opinion, infinitely better in every respect than Bandar Shapur upon which the Government of Iran has already spent a very large sum and only one Berth to show for it. A proper port could be constructed at Urn Qasr for a comparatively small sum - bearing in mind of course that Port construction is always a most expensive business, even the Port oi Basra was a costly affair. There however, a port, with dolphins, short temporary jetties and the loan of pontoons and barges which could be made available from Basra, could be opened within a very short period of time. As will be seen from the chart a wide bar 2? to 3 miles long exists outside the Khor Shatona which carries 18 feet at low water with a rise of tide of 10 to 12 feet. This however is sufficient to enable vessels with a draft of 27 to 28 feet or more to navigate with safety as soon as the channels are buoyed and marked which again presents no great difficulty.- 2 - If considered necessary one of the Port’s large dredgers could, 1 estimate, make a channel with 20 feet at low water in 5 to 6 weeks clear wolfing. A greater depth could be obtained over a longer period and it would not be the perpetual and most arduous task that dredging the Shatt—el—Arab bar has proved to be. I am of the opinion that once dredged it would remain steady for a considerable time* The dredgers would however be exposed to the south easterly gales and therefore could not work in bad weather, and it is nothing to be compared with the Shatt- el-Arab bar. In addition to the Bar already mentioned there is, near the upper end of Laskar Reach a shoal patch of 16 feet at low water, steep-to, almost in mid-stream; this would be buoyed or marked, also a short distance further up a shoal extends 3 cables out from Bahrah Point to the 3 fathom contour. This would also be marked and there is another steep-to shoal or obstruction which exists nearly in the middle of the channel approx: miles below Um Qasr Creek but there is ample room lor shipping. This would also be marked. The stream narrows to about a mile in the Um Qasr reach which is ample turning space for ships at slack water. The bottom is not good holding ground but with the exercise of care ships anchoring with a good scope of cable should be quite safe. Heavy mooring Buoys could of course be laid in due course for vessels to make fast to. In my opinion from a marine point of view there is no great difficulty in making Um Qasr into a very good port. The tidal range and strength of the tides will require ships to be brought in carefully and safely moored. Considering the position froma shore point of view, again I see no difficulty which cannot be overcome without vast expenses. There is a good 30 miles road running from Zobair on the same hard solid ground to within three quarters of a mile of the foreshore. This short stretch however is on ground /thatthat will become a quagmire in the rainy season, but a road could be easily made up and also wharves could be built from the Jebal Sanam Stone which is only 20 miles distant. A railway line could also in my opinion be quickly laid and without great expense. A railway bank from Shaiba to Jebal Sanam already exists. In all, 40 miles of light railway will be required to connect up the quarry (i.e. from Shaiba to Jebal Sanam and on to Urn Qasr) and additional 35 miles of proper track for direct connection between the Junction Shaiba and the Port at Urn Qasr. All the ground appear to be well above spring tide level but an early survey should be made to verify this. The foreshore is unfortunately very shelving and extends approx. 300 ft. between the high and low water marks. Temporary Jetties of 100 ft. in length approx, will also be requied, these with dolphins together with pontoons and Buoys available in Basra would enable the Port to be quickly put into commission. If rough estimates of cost are required then the railways should undertake the shore survey and my surveyors and engineers could prepare estimates of jetty construction, costs of dolphins Buoys, Beacons, etc., etc. (Sgd.)

General Nuri told me that the preliminary survey of this waterway, which had been entrusted to Sir John Ward and the Basra Port Authorities, would be completed during September. Mr. Loggin, the British Adviser to the Ministry of Communications, had previously told me in confidence that the Ministry of Defence were anxious to proceed with this project and had asked him to prepare plans for the construction of a railway extension to connect it with Basra. Mr. Loggin therefore anticipated that a formal approach would be made to me at any moment, but his anticipations have not as yet been realised. 3. I have since been told by Sir John Ward, on his return from England two or three days ago, that his survey is practically complete and only has to be checked. On the other hand, from oflicial quarters in London, he derived the impression that His Majesty’s Government were not anxious to expedite the scheme. He was moreover confident that an emergency port could be got into use at short notice and that there was a serviceable track to connect transport with the Shaiba Road. 4.

It will be seen from this despatch that the Iraqi Government have been favourably impressed by the results of the survey carried out by the Port of Basra authorities, that they have decided to undertake the construction of wharves near Urn Qasr, which is to be connected with the Iraqi railway system, and that, in the opinion of the Iraqi Government, it would be necessary, both from the point of view of navigation and security, to obtain for Iraq the sovereignty over both banks of the channel connecting the new moorings with the open sea.. It will further be seen that, on being pressed by Sir Basil Newton, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that the concessions from Koweit which his government had in mind were the Warbah and Bubiyan islands. 3. From the previous discussions on this subject, Lord Halifax understands that the Iraqi Government can in fact build on Iraqi territory a port of their own which would be adequate to their immediate needs and would have access to the/ The Under-Secretary of State, India Office./oX-' the sea through Iraqi territorial waters, v/ithout obtaining any territorial concessions from Koweit, although it might be necessary for a certain amount of dredging to be carried out in Koweiti waters 0 On the other hand it is understandable that the State which controls the Mesopotamian plain should desire to have undivided control of at least one good means of access to the sea, and Lord Halifax thinks that on a long view it is likely that, if Iraq were given this access, it would make for steadier conditions in that part of the world in years to come 0 4 0 Undivided control of a waterway normally pre-supposes the possession of sovereignty over both its banks. At any rate it is difficult, as the experience of Turkey and Iraq in the Shatt-al-Arab has shown, to make good a claim to sovereignty over the whole of a waterway without possessing the sovereignty over both banks. But all the same the essential requirement of the Iraqi Government, or any other government in their position, must be the sovereignty of the waterway itself; and this general consideration is not effected by the fact that, in the case of the Khor Abdullah, if the port to be constructed on this particular waterway were expected to become a large one, they might require in addition, in order to allow for future expansion and for reasons of purely local topography, the cession of a small part of the Koweiti mainland near the point at which the common frontier meets that waterway (assuming, at any rate, that it meets it somewhere only a little south of the Um Qasr creek ) 0 If Iraq could secure the sovereignty over the whole of the Khor Abdullah, the cession of the islands of Warbah and Bubiyan themselves would/would seem unnecessary from the point of view of navigation, and could only be justified on the sore of defence* As regards defence, since these islands are, at certain times of the year anyway, under water at high tide, the military reasons for their acquisition by Iraq do not seem strong. In any case, strategic requirements would seem to apply with equal force, or rather with more force, to the whole of the mainland of Koweit from the point (wherever that may be) where the frontier meets the Khor Abdullah to the ^ point of junction of the Khor Abdullah with the Khor Sabiya* The introduction of so-called defence requirements therefore involves further cessions from Koweit over and above those which could be justified on the score of navigational requirements alone 3 Moreover, from the point of view of the prospective difficulty of retaining and exercising sovereignty over the waterway through a long term of years in the absence of sovereignty over the right bank, the acquisition of the two islands alone is insufficient. 5* But whatever the desires and deserts of the Iraqi Government may be, the sheikh of Koweit is clearly under no obligation to cede to Iraq any part of his territory, except in return for what he may consider adequate compensation. If, therefore, the Iraqi Government desire to obtain concessions from him,they must accept his terms, although His Majesty’s Government would no doubt, in view of their friendly relations with both parties, endeavour to facilitate a settlement satisfactory both to the Iraqi Government and to the Sheikho Copies of Sir Basil Newton’s despatch have been sent to the political Resident in the Persian/Persian Gulf and to the political Agent at Koweit, as well as to the Government of India, who may have observations to offer as to the nature of the compensation which the Sheikh might accept&gt; Until an expression of their views has been received, it is clearly impossible to reach any conclusion on this point. But it seems to Lord Halifax probable that the question of compensation on any large scale v/ill in any case present great difficulty 0 6, It therefore appears desirable that the concessions required from Koweit should be reduced to the minimum, and as there is a case for maintaining that it is at present unnecessary, in view of the special relations between His Majesty's Government and both the parties, and of the evident impossibility of any threat to Iraq from Koweit, for the Iraqi Government to take strategic considerations into account in connexion with the new port, it seems to Lord Halifax that they might be well advised to concentrate on their navigational needs only 0 As has been said above, these involve, essentially, only the cession of the Koweit portion of the waterway, and since sovereignty over half this waterway is at present, so far as Lord Halifax knov/s, of no particular value to the Sheikh, and would probably not become of essential value (seeing that Koweit has other outlets) even if oil were discovered in larger quantities, it seems to His Lordship that some settlement agreeable to His Highness as well as to the Iraqi Government should not be impossible of achievement, possibly on the basis of a monetary payment by the Iraqi Government« I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,Copy.

British Embassy, Bagdad 4 14th November*, 1939* My Lord, /“N P / With reference to my despatch No. 503 of September' 6th, I have the honour to inform Your Lordship that during the course of my last weekly visit to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, His Excellency spoke to me about the proposed new port on the Khor Abdullah. He said that the Iraqi Government had been favourably impressed by the report of the Survey carried out by the Basra Port (Chancery letter to the Eastern 4 . 0 Department No. 30/13/39 of September 26th, 1939) and had decided to undertake the construction near Urn Qasr, of wharves with moorings for two ships. They would also build a railway line from Shaiba to the new port, thus providing it with railway communication with Basra. He added that, in the opinion of the Iraqi Government in order to protect the new port, it would be necessary both from the point of view Of navigation and strategy to secure Iraqi sovereignty over both banks of the channel connecting it with the open sea a He went on to recall that, when Taufiq Suwaidi then Minister for Foreign Affairs, was in London in October 1938, he had discussed this aspect of the matter at the Foreign Office and had, according to Ali Jaudat Bey, been encouraged to believe that the good offices of His Majesty’s Government would be available to secure such territorial concessions from Koweit as might be required to secure the safety of the approaches to the proposed port. 2. I asked the Minister what concessions he had in mindo He/ The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., etc., etc., etc.He replied that the Iraqi Government considered that it would be necessary to acquire from Koweit the Islands Warbah and Bubiyan, Both he claimed were barren sand and mud banks and were quite valueless to Koweit» 3* l pointed out that however barren these Islands might be they represented in area, a considerable proportion of the whole of the territory of Koweit, and that it would be vain therefore to expect the Ruler of Koweit would be willing to cede them to Iraq without adequate compensation 0 I enquired whether the Iraqi Government hrd thought at all about this point and if so with what result. The Minister admitted that he had no proposals to put forward concerning the quid pro quo for the cession of the Islands^ and was inclined to take the line that as the Islands were worthless it would be unnecessary to compensate the Sheikh for their loss. He also suggested vaguely and uneasily that Iraq was in fact in a position to claim sovereignty over these Islands and even over the whole of Koweit. 4. I reminded him that the reaffirmation of the frontier contained in notes exchanged between the Iraqi and Koweit Governments a short time before Iraq’s admission to the League of Nations in 1932 specified quite clearly that the Islands of Warbah and Bubiyan belonged to Koweit, and I warned His Excellency that the Iraqi Government could hope for no advantage from any attempt to dispute the validity of the definition of the frontier contained in these documents. H is Excellency did not press the point further and I suggested that the best policy for the Iraqi Government would be to study the whole question from the point of view of providing for Koweit a common interest with Iraq/Iraq in the construction and development of the new port. This Ali Jaudat agreed to do but begged that at the same time His Majesty’s Government would also give the matter sympathetic attention and if possible offer suggestions for a basis of settlement. 5. The problem of finding a suitable quid pro qu o which Iraq could offer to Koweit for the cession of the two Islands is clearly difficult to solve. The frontier on the west of Koweit follows the line of the well-marked natural feature of the Batin and could not conveniently be altered to make a territorial concession to Koweit, while any movement northwards of the line from the Batin to the Khor Abdulla would not only take the boundary dangerously close to Basra but would also cut off Iraq from access to the site of the new port itself, it would seem, therefore, that the quid pro quo must be economic and not territorial, and I venture to suggest that the question should be approached from that angle. Possibly the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf through his special knowledge of local conditions may be able to suggest what form of economic assistance or commercial facilities would be most attractive to Koweit* 6.

Dated Hew Delhi, the 7th March 1940• ' / I have the honour to refer to your telegram Ho.l22/H, dated the 1st March regarding the Khor Abdullah, and to express the following views 2. The matter must be viewed from two aspects: Firstly an Iraqi port on the north aide of the Khor which would require no cession of territory by the Shaikh of Kuwait, and which would simply be a question of the Iraq Government improving and using the joint waterway for their own purposes. I do not think that His Highness would object to this, nor, provided that his rights were protected, would any objection be justified. 3. If, on the other hand, the Iraq Government decided that a port on the south side of the creek, i.e. in Kuwait territory, would be the only one that would meet their requirements, then as has been accepted in Foreign Office letter Ho .S.7601/58/93, dated the 16th December (para.5) the Shaikh of Kuwait is under no obligation to cede any portion of hie territory except in return for v/hat he considers adequate compensation. Further more, by virtue of the last paragraph of certain assurances / \ given to Shaikh Mubarak as-Subah in 1914 (Aitchieon’s Treaties 1929 Ho.XLII) we have recognised that the Shaikhdom is an independent Government under our protection. / 4. ■ Sir,4. His Highness has not yet been officially informed of the exact nature of the Iraqi proposals and it is therefore difficult to say with certainty what his reactions to a request for cession of territory would be* I feel sure f however, that if he is to be allowed no share in the port that he will not agree to any form of monetary compensation, nor would he yield to blackmail in the shape of renewed attacks on the as-Subah estates in Fao. We may dismiss territorial compensation as impracticable* 5. The Shaikh has shown by his obstinacy over the 3:eutral Zone that he is extremely tenacious where his rights are concerned, and I do net consider that his pride as an Arab Ruler would permit him to accept cash compensation for ceded territory, and Ibn Saud would be certain to resent an$ one fjided concession in an area where he feels he has an under lying interest. There is no doubt that Ibn Saud moved troops to the frontier in the spring of 1939 when His Highness staged his coup d’etat, and had it failed he would almost certainly have sent them to the support of the Al Subah. Since then they have further strengthened their ties. 6. I do not feel that we should be acting in the interest of Kuwait in advising them to cede their interests in a possible port in the Khor Abdullah. Cil has already been found in large quantities and it is very likely that the Khor Abdullah may prove to be the most practical route for export ing it. The beat line to take appears, therefore, to ^e that suggested in para.4 of the 3agdad iimbassy letter ho*S^8 of - ( o- the 14th Hovembeb: i939, namely that of providing a common interest for Kuwait in the construction and development of the new port. On these terms the co-operation of the Shaikh / should-3- should not be difficult to secure • 7, As to whether the port is or is not required, I am not competent to judge* The view of leading shippers is that far from having reached saturation point, the Shatt-al-Arab is only working at about 30 or 40 per cent of its capacity. If this is correct, and if as I believe to be the case, His Majesty’s Government are still owed some £ 170,000 for Basrah Port, a new undertaking would appear difficult to justify* I believe, however, that a separate port entirely under Iraqi control, far from making for more settled conditions would only make them more intransigent, and the ideal arrangement, if expert opinion considers that a port can and must be made, would be for it to be under joint British, Iraqi and Kuwaiti control* It should not be impossible to attain this position* 8. I am visiting Kuwait on the l7th of March and will take the opportunity to inform the Shaikh of the nature of the Iraq proposals. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, sd.

As ? point to decide ?_principie in British interests as distinct from those of Kuweit we are entirely opposed to eny territorial cession in this quorter. The last 20 years have demonstrated Iraqi fickleness and we should not a oet transfer of important point from a Bhaikhdom ^which with cur xect in salt water we can always influence) to a State whose future attitude to the Empire is hard to predict. Indie will no doubt be called on to find ? forces to meet any threat in this region end is closely interested in maintenance of Kuwait as pied a terre. An Iraqi port on Khor Abdullah v.ould inevitably tend to lessen the importance of Kuwait and might wentually eclipse it altogether. It is important for our position in the Gulf that Kuwait should be stable and free from Iraqi influence. It follow© that we are strongly opposed to any attempt being made to coerce the Shaikh of Kuweit into making any concession to the Iraqis. If case i 8 taken with the uheikh beyond confidential approach made by Irior (and we are averse from raising it) we think it should be made clear that Ki 8 Majesty's Government will observe letter and spirit of third promise given to shaikh in 1914 vide document XIII at page 265-266 of Aitchison Volume XI.to any direct dealing on tnie queoticn between Kuwait and Iraq in tne manner euggested at one stage by Iraq. 6. finally we are impressed by ? comment that Ibn baud in so far as we ere in a position to appreciate his views would almost certainly resent Iraqi encroachment in this quarter and would prefer maintenance of Kuwait protectorate unimpaired to expansion of Iraqi influence. ^e recommend therefore on all grounds that project be dropped and if Iraq need a port they be encouraged to develop it within Iraq as safer course political circumstances ? of ( mut. ). foreign G,T.\«v \X\ COPY OF TELEGRAM 1 —'' ———— .

My dear Colonel, A / X Will you please refer to 3ir Basil Newton’s Cavingraa No. 13 of the 27th February, 1940, on the subject of a port on the Khor Abdullah? 2. It occurs to me that this desire to acquire the islands may not be for so hypothetical a reason at all. It is, I believe, more than possible that the Irakis cannot conduct the operations of a port on the Khor Abdullah without entering Kuwait waters. The desire to possess the islands on an excuse of defence or to meet internal criticism may only be a blind, to cover the facts, the real position being that by obtaining possession of the islands the Iraqis will automatically acquire ri^ts over all the water, thereby achieving their object without admitting the weakness of their position, i.e. that they cannot operate a port without acquiring Kuwaiti waters. 3. I have heard that Sir John has been discussing these very secret plans with an American Missionary in asra and, unless my memory fails me, has actually shown him plans. I, therefore, saw no harm in mentioning the case to Hr. Jameson ,$hen he was here a day or so ago. ks I suspected he was fully conversant with the case, and he told m that it is possible that the Company mi^ht consider loading oil in the Khor Abdullah, and he thought that Kuwait $culd be ill advised to give up any of their rights in that area.

Sir, A A With, reference to Foreign Office letter iii 7601/58/93 of the 16th December I am directed by Viscount Halifax to transmit to you, herewith, for the information of the Marquess of Zetland, the accompanying copies of a further despatch and telegram from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad regarding the proposed construction by the Iraqi Government of a new port on the Khor Abdullah. 2, it will be seen that the Iraqi Government have again raised this question on two occasions, and that in speaking to General Nuri, Sir Basil Newton held out no hope that it would be possible to arrange for the ^ m surrender of any territory to Iraq by Koweit. 3. v/hether it would be likely to prove prejudicial to British interests that Iraq should obtain sole control of the Khor Abdullah is a question which was discussed in some detail in paragraphs 16 to 21 of Mr. Baggallay’s ^ n s semi-official letter E 5116/58/93 to Mr. Jarrett at the Admiralty, of the 5th August last. For the reasons given in that letter Lord Halifax is inclined to doubt whether, in the event of a breach in the present close relations between The Under-Secretary of State, -p ^ o- India Office.4 mi' between His Mejesty’s Government and the Iraqi Government, the retention by the Sheikh of Koweit of his present rights in the waterway would be of any particular advantage to His Majesty’s Government, though it might of course prove useful to the Sheikh himself. On the other hand, any attempt on the part of His Majesty's Government to make use of Koweiti rights in the waterway to exert pressure on the Iraqi Government would be likely to prejudice relations between the Sheikh and Iraq and would not therefore be in the former's interest. Lord Halifax feels, therefore, that apart from the general consideration that it would probably, on the long view, make for more stable conditions in that part of the world in the future if Iraq, as the State which controls the Mesopotamian plain, had the undivided control of at least one good means of access to the sea, His Majesty's Government should treat this problem strictly on its merits: that is to say, in the light of their obligations to Iraq, as our ally, on the one hand, and to Koweit as a protected State, on the other. If their judgement is influenced by attempts to maintain a strategical hold over one territory or the other in circumstances which cannot now be foreseen, the consequences may recoil upon them in some totally unexpected manner and lead to trouble which the adoption of a different course might have avoided.mmamm Mil. 1 *’n 14 4.

While not proposing any territorial compensation he hinted vaguely that economic satisfaction could be given and also that some common regime might be established similar to that of the Iracpr Saudi neutral zone. While admitting that access to the port was not likely to be endangered by Koweit he said that the Iraqi Government would be exposed to criticism if they failed to provide for their own control over the approaches and he offered to give any guarantees which Koweit or His Majesty’s Government might desire in return. 2. I promised to telegraph again and said that I might have some opportunity of discussing the question with the Political Resident whom I hoped to meet shortly in Bahrein. At the same time I hold out no hope that territorial surrenders would be made.

INDIA OFFICE, iVHITSHALL, S.V/.l. l8th April, 1940. \ Sir, f With reference to Mr* Baggallay’s letter of the 16th March, No* E* 1033/630/93, and connected correspondence relative to the proposed construction of an Iraqi port on the Khor Abdullah, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the /fo ‘ » Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a copy of a letter dated 7th March) in which the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf /-N submits his views on this subject. The views of the Government of India have been communicated in their telegram of the 18th March, No* 631, and further observations have been received from the Political Resident in his telegrams , A 1 »v' No. T/209 and T/210, dated the 22nd March. Copies of these telegrams have already been sent to you and to the other interested Departments* 2. The Secretary of State fully endorses the Government of India’s view that it is important for our position in the Gulf that Koweit should be stable and free from Iraqi influence. Having regard moreover to the nature of our relations with the Sheikh and to the undertakings given to Sheikh Mubarak in 1914, it is in Lord Zetland’s view axiomatic that no pressure should be put on the Sheikh to cede any of his rights to the IraqiGovernment. Apart from these considerations it is necessary, as the Political Resident and the Government of India suggest, to take account of the attitude of Ibn Saud who is likely to regard with misgiving any extension of Iraqi influence in Koweit. The Under Secretary of State, COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL Foreign Office, COPY SENT BY AIR MAtL^ * S£A __ S.w.l. of xf. ^ 4c ^ (i. . gf as- v-o -fe COPY SENT BY P&amp;R MAIL of 1#. . lw ^(r l*'3. As the result of the informal approach made by the Political Resident to the Sheikh, it is clear that the latter would he opposed to making any territorial concession to Iraq., if approached in the matter, and that though he could not object if the project were to be kept entirely in Iraqi territory, he would not welcome the scheme owing to the possibility of its affecting detrimentally the interests of Koweit. In view of the Sheikh s attitude and in the light of the considerations mentioned in the previous paragraph, Lord Zetland would suggest that the Iraqi Government should be informed that until they can put forward a definite scheme which would indicate more precisely the nature of the concessions which they think it essential to obtain from the Sheikh and of the compensation which they would be prepared to offer him in return, His Majesty’s Government cannot offer any considered opinion on the matter. It should be explained at the same time that His Majesty’s Government understand that it is improbable that the Sheikh will in fact be prepared to make any territorial concession in this area, and that in view of their engagements to the Sheikh they could not put any pressure upon him to do so. The Iraqi Government may therefore think it preferable either to proceed with a scheme which would locate the proposed port ^ Iraqi territory and would not involve the cession by the Sheikh of any of his rights in the waterway or, as already suggested by His Majesty’s Ambassador, to work out a puoject which would provide for Koweit a common interest with Iraq in the construction and development of a new port. 4. whatever the eventual decision as to the scope and nature of the new port, Lord Zetland would see considerableadvantage, before the project is further pursued, in the recommendation made by the Political Resident that Sir John ward’s proposals, which have apparently been made known by the latter in unofficial quarters, should be examined by the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, or, failing him, by a harbour engineer, and he would commend the suggestion to Lord Halifax’s consideration. Pie would also once more draw attention to the desirability of proceeding with the proposed demarcation of the irontier between Iraq and Koweit without delay since, should the Iraqi Government decide to confine the scheme ior a new port to Iraqi territory, the precise position of the boundary line in the neighbourhood of Umm Qasr may be of considerable importance. 5.

In view of this assurance, and indeed on general grounds, it seems clear to Lord Halifax that if it is in fact thought that additional port facilities in raq are required in the interest of His Majesty’s Government, some part at least of the cost will have to be borne by His Majesty’s Government# 4# As Lord Zetland will be aware, a reconnaissance party has recently visited Basra in order to review the existing port facilities there in relation to possible requirements in the future.

Prom tentative enquiries made from the Shaikh of Kuwait it is clear that he is firmly opposed to any scanty cession so that the proposed port must he situated on the Iraqi territory and must not involve cession by the Shaikh of any of his territory or rights in waterway.

I have noted that Iraqi Government are anxious to obtain financial assistance from His Majesty's Government to enable them to complete scheme. His Majesty's Government would always be prepared to negotiate a fair financial settlement with Iraqi Government regarding cost of any additional port facilities which they might themselves require. They could not however reach any conclusion with regard to financial aid for present scheme until they have had an opportunity of considering whether it is both practicable in itself and necessary from their point of view. As Iraqi Government are no doubt aware reconnaissance party which recently visited Basra inspected site at UM QASR.

Military authorities are being asked to report immediately exact site where they construct harbour and to state whether they intend use port Basra authorities as their agents for construction. If port is to be north of UM QASR creek it will undoubtedly be in Iraq, but there is an alternative site south of creek which, owing to uncertainty regarding exact position of Iraq. - Kuwait frontier, may possibly be wholly or partly outside Iraq.. Until position regarding wishes of Military authorities has been cleared up, it does not seem practicable to put forward to Iraq Government and Shaikh of Kuwait any definite proposals. 2. You should therefore now inform Iraq..Government only that it has been decided for Military reasons to contruct an emergency port art or near UM QASR as a matter of urgency.

As regards (a) Shaikh reacted well; said he would welcome purely British port at UM QASR but desired me tell you with all emphasis he could command that there must be no handing over - of port to Iraqis after war as that would place Kuwait in mortal danger. He would prefer its utter destruction rather than that happened. Nor would it be enough dismantle port if purely in Iraq territory as Iraqis could easily replace jetties etc. and carry on campaign of diverting Kuwait's trade to UM QA.SR. If port is located in Iraq and His Majesty's Government unwilling retain permanent control, then either it must be dismantled under British guarantee that Iraq will not rebuild or if port is half in Kuwait and half in Iraq a joint Kuwait Iraq harbour Committee might possibly be set up under direct British control though this solution may not please Iraqis. Kuwait in any case to retain control her water rights and not be asked transfer territory (above almost exactly follows line of Government of India's telegram 3786 and paragraph 3, and your telegram T/336 paragraph 2). Regarding Kuwait itself Shaikh said he agreeable Military authorities developing port facilities and improving road to Basra, but hopes former will mainly be in direction SHUTAIKH. 3. As regards (b) Hickinbotham. Shaikh unfortunately reacted badly, he pointed out that in view problems like Monthly require-*- 2 - I requirements Programme and coming TO C^ASR negotiations ,, swapping ,, horses present juncture might he disastrous, and will unfairly handicap him.

No. C/472 Political Agency, Kuwait, 27th August, 1941 ■'ty dear Colonel, I was interested to meet Ward in riasra on Monday morning to listen to him. H e raised the (question of Umm Q,asr and explained with considerable vigour that he had flown over the area and convinced himself and, so he claimed, Calloway that the site of the new port was wholly in Iraq territory. I found that I was not required to make any contribution to the conversation. Ward ended by assuring me of his cooperation in every way. 2. I inferred from rennrks maae by Martin, the Chief Engineer in Iraq, who was here yesterday that /ard had ocposed the development oi Peuwait which was from Maiti*! s point of view a better proposition in some ways than Umm Qasr as the approaches are less obstructed. In Mart in* s opinion Ward is much afraid of the Shatt entrance silting up and he wishes to have an alternative outlet for Iraqi produce ready for immediate use. I see from the files that Ward has been interested in the Umm Qasr and similar projects for some yesrs. 3 . Martin and I examined a map of the Umm Qasr areas as I wished to find out from him exactly where they were at the moment driving experimental piles, and the place he pointed out is south of Umm Qasr fort and. seems to be almost completely within Kuwait limits.

This he said he was unable to do as it had never been demarcated whereupon his inatruotions were to put in the boundary as shown on the i of an inch map. I gathered from his conver sation that the military authorities are particularly 2. The port is supposed to be for purely military purposes and as the military authorities have been given complete freedom of movement in Kuwait territory and terri torial waters, it should be a matter of no particular interest to them whether it is wholly or partly in Kuwait I or Iraq, territory. This ourious interest is in my opinion disquieting and although I have tried to Keep an open mind | on the question of Kuwait - Iraq relations I fin'., rayseli wondering if there is not some ulterior motive in the atten- | tion that is being paid to the siting of a port tne position of which should be decided entirely by tactical and strate- the south apparently to avoid any possibility of it entering Kuwait territory.

If you will refer to your telegram T/364 of the 30th of July you will see that paragraph {A) reads 'That in regard to (a) he may rest assured that his rights will he fully safeguarded both now and in any arrangements for the disposal of the port on the conclusion of hostilities The underlining is mine. The Shaikh is naturally fully aware of the danger to ruwait of the development of an Iraqi port at Umm ^asr as is shown by my predecessor’s telegram fto. vj/444 of the 10th of August, I have no doubt that he supposes that His Majesty’s Government’s declaration qtuoted above fully safeguards the interests of his State and that the port will be under the control of the military authorities during the war and later abandoned or that some amicable agreement will be arranged by Kis Majesty’s Government beneficial to both Iraq, and Kuwait, I am not at all sure th- t His Highness is correct in assuming any such thing for as you have pointed out in paragraph 7 of your demi-official letter ao, C/93 of the 3th of February to Peel 'If the Iraqis can develop the port without territorial concessions there is of course nothing to prevent t hem , Ci~ (/? i/u so th*»t the Shaikh can have no Tights' in the port/, and it is clear from H.'.f's Ambassador in Baghdad’s telegram ho. 14 »• of the 31st of July that he considered there was a'possibility that Iraq would receive the port free after the war. Kuwait has asked for the port to be dismantled when m hostilities have ceased and Iraq is visualising the acquisition of/of another free port jaid for hy the British public. One side or the other will be aggrieved and we shall again be accused of having failed to keep our promise and may possibly have an Uram viasr crisis on our hands after the war not dissimilar in some of the potential results from the Palestine crisis, I suggest we decide now what we are going to do and make it abdundantly clear to both parties without delay. The first thing to do is to decide in whose territory the port is situated for, unless it is decided to dismantle the place as soon as hostilities have ceased which I am inclined to think would be much the most satisfactory solution f any suggestion with regard to the future control of the place must be largely determined by its geographical situation. At the same time I feel that the political question involved should be explained to General Beresford so that he will be in a position to assess correctly any suggestions of a political nature that may oe made to him by Iraq.

Political Agent, Kuwait, Inform! ■ thet Ship whioh visited Um qasr on September 19th considered it very doubtful if site is wholly in Iraq territory. It also appears from Railway surveyors that Um Q,asr port is not correctly marked on quarter inch map and should be .9 of an inch further south. Also according to their calculations southern boundary of port is nearly 3 miles south of Um C.asr as it is at present shown on map. Hickinbotham considers site is partly in Kuwait territory. 2. It is clear that the definition proposed in Ambassador Bagdad’s letter No.487 of 7th October 1940 to Minister for foreign Affairs represented a concession to Iraq (since it drew a line from a point south of Bafwan to the junction of the Khor Zubair and hhor Abdullah and not from 'just south of Urn O/tBr' to the Khor junction) and as the Iraq Government did not accept the proposed definition the Shaikh is presumably no longer bound by it. Sir Percy Cox’s definition was admittedly based /based on Article 7 of the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 29th July 1915 and by that the moot easterly points are (a) the mouth of the ithor Zubair and lb) a point immediately south of the place and wells of Um ^asr'. If this is shown to be more beneficial to Kuwait the Shaikh would appear entitled to claim it. 3. I suggest that railway surveyors (who are presumably Royal i£ngineers) be asked to give us an author itative map of disputed points so that we can see actual position and proposed definitions could then be amended if necessary as was contemplated in paragraph J of hewton’s despatch Jio.164 of April 15th 194 U oo roreign Office. A joint harbour board is clearly moot favourable to our interests and will be moot easily secured if a portion of the site is found to lie in Kuwait territory. It would of course be open to the Iraq Government to move the port further north (if this were practicable) but this would not evade necessity of using Kuwait territorial waters and once they conceded joint harbour board they would be unlikely to make alterations. It is essential that they should be warned in advance that they will not be allowed unrestricted control of port now being con structed as otherwise they will certainly create difficulties when port is handed over. 4. Um Qasr creek. This is not mentioned on any map nor on Admiraly chart 1265 but I assume from paragraphs 5 and 6 of Ambassador’s despatch ho.164 of 15th April 1940 to foreign Office that he refers to the small inlet shown in chart 1265 on right bank of Khor Um Qasr at 95 d from .Fort of Um Qasr.

Political Resident’s telegram 110 .103. We agree that it is most desirable to clear up as soon as possible doubts regarding location of appropriate port m relation to frontier. As this can only be done when we liave liad a reliable map made of area, can General officer Commanding Iraq spare Royal engineers or others with any personnel to undertake close reconnaissance V If so it would be helpful if they could plot on map the frontier on basis of 194U formula and also show area to be covered by port installations and nut. nut. as constructed or in mut. contemplation.

As well as the details of these specific proposals, the correspondence also discusses relations between Iraq and Kuwait, and Britain's position in both countries.The majority of the correspondence is between British officials but the file also contains a limited amount of correspondence between the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah and the Political Agency in Kuwait (in Arabic with English translations).The file also contains a record of a conversation between Foreign Office officials and the Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs during a meeting held at the Foreign Office in London on 4 October 1938 (folios 54-56).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Umm Kasr</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Harbours</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000cb#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
