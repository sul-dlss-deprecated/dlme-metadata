However, be si; ••• ' ''' 1 powerful(powerful brother UuhMiaaad bin Saqar - ae the new Sheikh c Khan inaedlatel./, and doubly to lock the door by oarrying hia within 48 houra to niece of the nurdered Sheikh! Sheikh Sultan haa the reputation of being more greedy than clever, but thia little incident might take an honourable place in any catalmgue of murderous intrigue. in one ^oup* he rids himself of a tiresome separetist, provides a sop for a powerful rival, placates the offended populace by marrying the new nan to the old family and public opinion by executing the murderer. Nevertheless public opinion - guided by Abdur Rahman - may not see the thing quite in this light. Sultan is undoubtedly selfish and greedy and is not popular. I am told that we may find in the near future that the sheikhdom of Khan was but a stepping stone to the Sheikhdom of Sharjah. It remains to be seen whether the next murderer will be double crossed tool At Babai there are no complications. The Sheikh*s relativea think they should have a larger share of his regular revenue. Shaikh Sa'id, who Hhen pearls were paying was poorer than they, thinks otherwise. The Sheikh is concerned for the welfare of his dependants, realising as he does that in the event of any accident befalling him his cousin Hana* bin K^shid might well succeed in place of his own son. 0. At Ajman the Residency Agent thought there was unlikely to be any disturbances. The present Sheikh is a strong man well able to keep order in his own house. He is unlikely to aspire to any of the neighbouring sheikhdoms, and if he did would not be welcomed owing to being of a different tribe. 8. There has* been no opportunity to check the accuracy of the facts comprising this report, and it is requested therefore that it may be read with reserve pending confirmation through political channels.

Tv/o raiders 01 the Awaiair tribe recently went off with some booty from the territory of the jhaikh of Hamriyah, who pursued and caught them up. ^ne ol the raiders screed to give up his share of the booty. 'The other, stouter-hearted, made the sporting suggestion that the Shaikh should let him away on his she-camel as far as he, the Shaikh, could see, and then pursue him. If the Shaikh was successful in overtaking him, then his share of the booty would be returned, otherwise he would keep it. ine Shaikh agreed, gave the raider the start agreed upon, rode after him, overtook, fired on, and wounded him so severely that the latest news was that he was on the point oi death. 2. The whole affair reminds one of one of the old Scutcu, or North Country, ballads, and probably will ^orm a Trucial Coast ballad: the Arebs are very good at that sort ox thing. 3. Incidentally it shows that in spite of an air route, air facilities, and the general opening up oi the Trucial Coast, the folk there are still quite 'primitive', and have their own ways,peculiar perhaps in our eyes but quite satisfactory in theirs, of settling their own affairs.

The Honourable the Political nesident in the Persian G-ulf, BUSHIRE. Sir, T) S I have the honour to refer to the Residency Agent, Sharjah f s report Wo.371 dated the 3ra June 1936 with enclosures. 2. It appears that there has been a disturbance between the subjects of the Shaikh of Bakha who is a vassal of the Shaikh of Dubai and a section of the subjects of the Ruler of Has al Khaimah who are from Sua t am. The facts of the case as reported are:- a. In AP r il fishermen from Bakha hauled their boat upon the beach near Sha t am ana exception was taken to the position of the boat by the local inhabitants, a free fight ensued ana a Sha T ami was killed. The Bakha people returned in good. order ana sailea away. b. In retaliation for (a) (above) the Sua T am people ..... / attackea Bakha ana capturea a dnow. c. The Shaikh of Bakha in his letter of l^th May accuses the Ruler of Ras al Khaimah of a breach of Article I of a mutual treaty dated 24th June 1879 This treaty is printea in 'Existing Treaties' between fhe British G-overnment anaTne Trucialn Chiefs 1906. 3. There is not sufficient eviaence for me to determine who the original aggressors were ana this point must necessarily influence any recommendation^ 1 may have to make. That the Sha'am people were wrong W-- in attacking Bakha whatever the provocation is beyond dispute but confirmation of this reported attack should be obtained before action is taken. On the face of it it seems that the alleged breach of Rule 1 of the Agreement of 1879 is in the nature of a make weight. I suggest that the Resiaency Agent, Sharjah, be instructed to make a careful enquiry into the two incidents both at Bakha ana at 3na T am on receipt of which I will forward such recommenaations as i may have to make. ''S I have the honour to be, Sir, lour most obedient servant. Captain, Offg. Political Agent, iialirain.Translation of letter No.371 datea the 3rd June 1936 t/f The residency ^gent, aharjah, to tne . olitical «.gent, ,aura After Gorapliments. Durin g wy visit to Dubai oa the ^5tii L.ay 1^36, Si^ikii Sai'd bin i &amp;ktua, O.3.B., Ruler of Hubni, told me that he receiveu a letter from iiiaikh auhammad bin ...jiiad bin Dulaiman, Shaikh of liaiha, coaplainin.,; about the aggression done by the people of Sha'am whicn is unuer Has al Khaimah and that he sent the letter to Khan Gahib husain in order to report the matter to you but after enquiries had been mtde, it appeareu that the letter was not forwardeu to you through an oversight. I am, therefore, senuing it to you in orij;ihal, togetuer witn tue letter to the Kuler of Dubai. 2. Sha'am is under Ras al ''hnimah ana its inhfcoitantB ^re from the Shihuh. This act is in contravention to Article I of the general treaty concluded between the Trucial U;aikhs of Oman and His Majesty's Government dated the 15tn March 1820. But, should the Ruler of Ras al Khaimah try to take strict action against the Shihuh, tney woula run away to the mountains and block the ways. Consequently, there will be no safety and internal dillicullies will sri^e. I am of opinion that if sucn incidents happen anu the offenders are not punished, this will encourage then to repeat such acts. Therefore, it is necessary that the Ruler of has al Kb iaah be asked to prevent his subjects fron conmitting aggression against anyone. 3. As regards the sailors. Article 1 of the treaty concluded between the Crucial shaikhs anc His Majesty's Government/-Goverment dateo the 24th June 1879 re aires that sailors should be returneu. In the case of the non return of sailors, Article II of the s^me treaty is to be enforced. 4. As the people of Bakha diu something which aade the people of bha T am rise against them, as reported in item 2 of paragraph 75 of the Residenc/ Agent 1 s Diary No.8 for the period from 15th to 30th April 1936, I sugg that when i next go to has al ^haimah, I will talk to the Shaikh in this connection and make en .uiries into the matter. If i find that that the aggression was actually done by his subjects, I will ask him to prevent there from doing so and to punish them. As regards tne question of sailors, it is in the interest of diving that Article II of the treaty dated the 24th June 1879 may be enforced, and, if you aeem it fit, I will ask the shaikh to act in accordance with his undertaking.

The main correspondents are British officials in London, Bushire, Bahrain, Residency Agent Sharjah; Shaikh Sa'id bin Maktum of Dubai; Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Sulaiman, Shaikh of Bakha. The dispute concerns the Shaikh of Rams who was no longer able to afford the payment of R1000 to the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah which was part of a treaty. The correspondence discusses the disputes of the Gulf and in a letter to the Political Resident Persian Gulf, Bushire, the Political Agent, Bahrain notes that if the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah were killed he would probably be succeeded by his brother Muhammad bin Salim and an assessment is given of his capabilities.The second part of the file contains papers containing information on the general situation on the Trucial Coast from October 1924 to June 1937, which is about the 'intrigues which are a permanent feature in the Persian Gulf'. This includes a report on the rulers of the Trucial Coast and many accounts of disputes between al-Khawatir, 'Awamir bedouin and the people of Batnah [Batinah] over raiding of goats and camels, and fishing rights. One letter describes an incident involving the looting of a boat. The letter notes how the Shaikh of Bakha perceives the role of the British government in the incident in correspondence with Shaikh Sa'id bin Maktum, Ruler of Dubai.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Shaikh of Fujairah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Shiḥūḥ (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000f8#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
