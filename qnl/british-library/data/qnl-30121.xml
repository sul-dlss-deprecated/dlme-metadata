La ior ths. mQnth...fl£ &gt; 254. The state of insecurity prevailing during October (fefer- ence paragraph 240 of Diary No. 11) underwent a marked improvement during the first half of November* after the Military and Civil Governors of Abadan had arrested over 100 habitual thieves and bad characters, who were subsequently sentenced to terms of detention varying from four to twenty-four months. Security deteriorated again* however* during the second half of the month* when two daring cases of armed robbery occurred in the quarters occupied by the British staff of the A.I.O.C. 255. It was at first thought that the thieves concerned in these armed robberies were Arabs from the Seeba area in Iraq* who had taken advantage of the lack of liaison between the Iraqi and Persian frontier authorities to cross the Shatt-al-Arab under cover of darkness. But the Civil Governor of Abadan later in formed H.M. Consul that he had every reason to believe that the robbers were Persian employees of the A.I.O.C. and that some of them had worn Arab clothes in order to conceal their identity* In both cases the male occupants of the houses were badly beaten up. 256. In Abadan itself, these incidents and the fluctuating state of security have become a source of grave concern to the European employees of the Oil Company. It is reported that the Military Governor has asked for two more Companies of Infantry from Ahwaz* to reinforce the existing units on Abadan Island. MILITAHI ' 257. Reference paragraph 241 of Khorramshahr Diary No. 11. Colonel Sarimi, the newly appointed Military Governor, arrived in Khorramshahr on the 23rd and assumed charge the following day. Ee is said to be an energetic officer and has been heard to express very anti-Russian sentiments. POLICE 258. Colonel Azad-Rad* the new Chief of Police for Abadan, arrived on the 22nd and assumed charge of his post the next day. 259. Special allowances are reported to have been granted by the Imperial Government to the Officers and men of the Police Forcexq in the Abadan and Oil Fields areas. The substantial increase in the total emoluments is expected to attract recruits, but the Senior Police officials consider that as the Company undoubtedly get the best available local man-power* it would be inadvisable for the Police to recruit in this area. TUDKH PARTY 260. The Tudeh party* though outwardly quiet during the first half of the month, continued to hold their secret meetings in order to collect funds and to keep up the members* enthusiasm* which appeared to be flagging. There was, however* an increase in their underground activities later in the month, when it became known that the Democratic Party of Iran had received instructions to open a branch in Khorramshahr before the coming general elections. 261. It is reported that Ali Pahlevan, the notorious political agitator and Tudeh leader who had been arrested in connexion with the July riots, has been released in Tehran, and the rumour that he may visit Abadan shortly is keeping the local Polite authorities on the look out for him. 262. Two other absconding Tudeh leaders* Nataqi and Safavi, are reported /A - 2 - XT EXT l 7 reported to have returned to Ahadan on the £fi)thj where they passe on special instructions which they had brjcta ght fr om Tudeh Head quarters in Tehran in regard to the General Elections. They left Abadan before the authorities could discover their whereabouts* POLI'UCAL 263. Ali Sheqaqi. Representative of the Central Committee of the Democratic Party of Iran 9 arrived in Khorramshahr on the 18th and convened a preliminary meeting on the 20th f with a view to forming a branch of the party here. A number of prominent citizens attended and a programme was drawn up. The official opening of the party’s headquarters, which is temporarily located in the Yab Water and Electric Company's premises, took place on the 24th. The ceremony was attended by the Governor General, who came down from Ahwaz for the occasion, most of the local officials and some of the notables. About 7-800 Arabs from the surrounding villages Joined the party and a few leading merchants and local Arab Shaikhs were also persuaded to Join. The townspeople, however, though perhaps willing at first to Join the party, were later on warned against doing so by the two T$deh sympathisers - Shaikhs Abdullah and Hassan Eoleyal of Khut-Shaikh - for fear of irritating the Tudeh party. 264. It is reported that the Democratic Party intend opening a branch in Abadan in the first half of December. Responsible quarters state that it would be most difficult for the party to obtain a following in Abadan, which is a Tudeh stronghold, and that an attempt to do so might result in a clash, with possible damage to the Oil Company's property. RUSSIAN AFFAIRS 266. It is reported that M. Novikov, the Soviet Consul at Ahwaz, has been taking considerable interest in the formation of the Demo cratic Party and its plans regarding the forthcoming elections in Khuzistan. He visited Khorramshahr two days after the party was officially opened and, accompanied by Abdullah and Hassan Holeyal, called on Isma'el Navidi and Doctor Hussain Rahim-Zadeh, and asked them to prevent the townspeople from Joining the Demo crat Party. Navidi has since been urging the people not to Join any more parties which, he says, experience has shown give rise to nothing mm but trouble. This is reported to be the reason for the lack of enthusiasm shown in the opening of the party here. 266. Before returning to Ahwaz, Novikov called on the Civil Governor at Abadan and asked a number of questions regarding the Democratic Party and the elections. He said that it would be useless for the party to open a branch in Abadan, in view of the lack of enthusiasm shown when it was opened in Khorramshahr. 267. Mr. Kazelof, Representative of the Soviet Trade Delegation to Iran, visited Khorramshahr on the 4th, 11th and 26th of Novem* ber in connexion 'rt-th the shipment of a consignment of silver articles to India through Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Limited. « Sd. V.W.D. Willoughby. His Majesty's Consul Khorramshahr.COMJflDfcKTlAi ^st' TT^ ▼A British Consulate, Khorramshahr* © the month of c am mmol 268. Following an order issued by the Mllitar^authorities on 30th November, 1946, the Headquarters and all branch offices and Club Houses of the Tudeh party in Khorramshahr and Abadan were closed and their sign-boards removed by the police. Members found in the Club houses were arrested and the landlords of tne various buildings used by the party were ordered to find new tenants. Apart from a feeble protest in the form of a few pam phlets directed against the Iranian authorities, there has been no reaction fro the party. 269. A large number of Tudeh leaders and agitators arrested during the month by the Military and Police authorities. Among these was Mohamed Kaveh, the party Treasurer in Abadan, in whose house the police discovered a sum of Rials + 1 } _ cash* receipts for large amounts which he ad pai-j to inuivi^ual oarty leaders, and correspondence between the local ana the Tehran Union Headquarters, each accusing the other of misappropriating the Party's fluids. 270. The arrests of their leaders, together with the news of the fall of the Province of Azerbaijan, have been a great blow to the movement in this area and the flaggii g enthusiasm and low morale of the Party's members has fallen still further. These reverses have not, however, put an end to the Party's activities. The ban imposed on public meetings and the closing down of their Club Houses etc. has had the effect of driving them underground and secret meetings continue to be held in private houses. 271. Though it is understood that polling in the Elections to the 15th Majlis should have commenced early in December* no action appears to have been taken locally. The if*rge number of prospective candidates expected to stand for the Kh^rra’ constituency has now dwindled to the followings Dr. Rajeh* of Tehran, who was unsuccessful in the last * 7 r elections, Agha Majid Muvaqar, editor of the newspaper 'Mehr Iran' and a Tudeh sympathiser, Dr. Mustafa Rahimaadeh, of Shiraz, Agha Naqabat, the present deputy, and ^ Agha Behrani, Manager of the Karun Hotel in Khorramshahr. The Democratic Party, which was recently opened in Khorranrha! r (para. 263 of Diary No.12 refers) have not yet nominated their candidate, but reports indicate that the Ideal leaders have started canvassing votes. 272. A number of Iranian triblii, chiefs in Khuzistar oent a telegram at the beginning of the montn to the ^rime Minister, offering to help the Government in its campaign in Azerbaijan, with a contingentt totalling HOC men. The offer was accepted by the Divisional Commander, but it is understood that the fall of the Province was announced before the men started^out for4 * --TS* - 2 - Ahwa*. As far as is known, no offer of help,came from the Arab tribal chiefs• 273. The Governor General is reported to have stated privately that he will permit certain Arab Shaikhs of this Province, who are now in Basra, to return to their homes in Khuzlstan if they send him a petition asking to be allowed to do so. Though the Arabs concerned are understood to have been informed of this, they v have not, yet, taken any action in the matter. UIUMiLt | : 274. Major All ashraf S&amp;fa'e arrived in KhorrMshuhi on 10th December and assumed the post of Garrison Cottraander,/ Khorramshahr and Abadan, a week later, vice Major Nadir Kljani, who left for Ahwaz on the 20th. 276# With the arrival of one Infantry Company from Ahwaz, the strength of the Military Garrison on Abadan Island is now 4 Infantry Companies and one M.G. Company. 276. There were no further incidents of robbery with violence in the European or Iranian residential areas in Abadan during the month, owing to the tightening up of general security measures by the Divisional Commander. While the junior British employees still appear to be perturbed about a possible recrudescence of such incidents, the Company's officials seem satisfied that the recent round-up of about 100 lawless elements has brought about some measure of Improvement in the town, the Company's works and residential areas. They are however still concerned about the security position in their shipping area, where unidentified and well-organised gangs of thieves and smugglers continue to operate and, when disturbed in their operations by the Abadan Security authorities, take refuge in flight to the Iraqi side of the Shatt- al-Arab. Efforts are being maae to enlist the assistance of the Iraqi authorities to exercise a strict contrAl on the Iraqi side of the river with a view to eliminating the operations of these gangs. The Iranian authorities are also considering the appoint ment of a Deputy Frontier Montrol Officer at Abadan for the purpose o/ maintaining friendly co-operation with the Iraqi officials across the river. ei&amp;sim nm* 277. Reference para. 248 of Diary No.11. Colonel Zelli has been appointed Iranian Naval Officer in Charge at Khorramshahr and has received instructions to re-organise the Iranian Naval Forces. He is reported to have received a sum of 3 million Rials for this purpose. 278. Reference para.218 of Diary No.9. On 7th December a further consignment of 10$ tons of silver ingots was shipped by the U.S.S.R. Trade Delegation in Iran to Lloyds Bank Bombay, through Messrs.Gray Mackenzie &amp; Company, Ltd. It is reported that another consignment of 4-5 tons is expected to be shipped shortly. Md. V.W.D. Willoughby. HDN.

Aghai Mir Afzali, the Government Inspector of the 1 lections, arrived here from Tehran on February 2nd and im mediately set about electing the tlectoral Committees. Separate Comrlttees, each consisting of nine persons, were elected for Abadan and Khorr&amp;mshahr and the period 14th-18th February inclusive was fixed for polling* 26* There was no election campaign or canvassint of votes by the candidates as it is known in the western sense* Canvassing was confined to a few private meetings at which prospective candidates, after being introduced to the audience by well-wishers, proceeded to make short speeches of little or no Importance* In the meantime all Government Departments had received instructions from the Governor- General at Ahwaz to the effect that their support should be given to Dr. Rajah, the Chief Medical Officer of the Banque-i-Melli and an ex-Anglo-Iranian Oil Company employee* Any attempts by other candi dates to press their campaigns were quiclly and effectively smothered by Government officials, and it soon became evident that Dr. Rajeh would heve no difficulty whatever in being elected from this area* Shaikh Abdul Axis Faxeli, of the Matur tribe, was at first w* popular choice of the rhusistan Arabs. He went to Ahwas on the^_ 4thlto discuss his candidature with the Governor General, but was given the discouraging news that the Government were strongly in favbur of the election of Dr. Rajeh. He returned, somewhat discora- fltted, to Khorramshahr, where he informed his supporters that he no longer wished to contest the seat and that their support should be given to Rajeh* Niqabat, the ex-deputy, and Bahreni were also sum moned to Ahwax during the polling and instructed to cease canvassing \ for votes immediately* They returned to Khorramshahr and took no further part in the proceedings* 28* Though the polling itself was conducted in an orderly manner, it cannot be said that it was entirely 'free'. Most of the voters, on approaching the ballot box, were handed voting papers, already prepared (in the same handwriting) in favour of Dr* Rajeh, which they placed * • • •2 ./l^ced In th© box* ^any of thos© who arrived with papers Bad# out in the nasi© of a candidate other than Dr* Kajeh were persuaded to have these exchanged for others in his favour f though the Electoral Committee were prepared in some Instances to allow voting papers in another name to be placed in the box so as to make things appear nor» mal.

The registration of the Union was not completad till the last week of $etorunrv i iter endless official delays and justlflabia suspicion on tha part of the authorities, owing to the fact that tha majority of t e union's Ixecutlve Committee were former Tudeh leaders* It is reported that the Oil Company's attitude towards the formation end Mtlvltlee of the Oil Workers Union is one of encouragement as they consider that it is infinitely better for the workers to belong to a genuine labour union rather than have no union at all. 30. There have been unconfirmed reports that the Democrat Party of Iran are anxious to organise a Vorkers' Union of their own in Abadan* 31. The Tudeh Party continued its underground activities Curing the month with secret meetings at w ieh speeches were again directed against the Oil orkers' Union and the Oil Company.

These included the absconding leaders Dashtipur, Moradi and Nateqi, who however left a few hours after their arrival in order to avoid arrest by the local authorities* Rumours then circulated to the effect that Dr. Jodat, a prominent Tudeh leader, was to accompany the Delegation on its visit to Abadan. The Governor General, on heax*ing his. protested strongly to Tehran on the grounds that Jodat's visit would give the 3ocal Tudeh Party, which had at that time virtually ceased to exist* the opportunity they had been seeking to revive their activities. The main part of the delega tion duly arrived on the 22nd March, accompanied, to the astonish ment of all, by Dr* Jodat and Mahmud Nateqi (a notorious agitator and absconder from justice), both of whom had managed to attach themselt'es to the delegation as •’interpreters**. They accompanied the delegates on their visits to the Refinery and to the workers* new housing estates and succeeded in making individual contacts with certain of the Party’s members, to whom they gave reassuring promisee. The local authorities, becoming apprehensive that the continued presence of these two individuals in Abadan might lead to disturbances, made protests to the Under-Secretary of the Min istry of Labour (who w£;s accompanying the delegates), but it was not until the Governor-General had informed them that they would be liable to arrest if they persisted in remaining in these areas, that they decided to return to Tehran, which they then did on the 24th March. No untoward incidents or demonstrations occurred, but their visit had an extremely heartening effect on the Tudeh Party. Propaganda was intensified and speeches became more violent. The Party formed a nev •’shadow** Committee during the course of the month, and it was reported that it had completely re-organised its ranks in ^budan by the end of March. 43. The Oil Workers* Union made little progress during the month. Its membership is now reported to be about 2,000* but the Union leaders are finding great difficulty in collecting new recruits* The main reasons for the workers* unwillingness to join the new Union is said to be that (e) their unhappy relations with the Tudeh Party have mad© them suspicious of all such organi sations (b) they fear that* after they have joined the Union, a return of the Tudeh Party uo power would leave them in an exceed ingly embarrassing situation (c) they are reluctant to pay any more subscriptions etc*, especially to the very same men who had collected money from them on behalf of the Tudeh Party and (d) many are still genuine Tudeh sympathisers* 44. A number of Tudeh leaders, Including Ramzan Kaveh and Benish, who had been under detention in Ahwaz, returned during the month to Abadan with letters of pardon from the Governor- General. Thek release is reported to be the result of the persuasive • •..- 2 - S ersuasive efforts of Mustafa Fatih&gt; the newly appointed eneral Manager of the Oil Company and sponsor of the ne Assistant ___ — w __ __ — — —^^ neji Union 9 who argued that these men had seen the error of their ways and were now required to promote the interests of the Union. Other individuals, who had previously been strong Tudeh propagandists and who had for various reasons been dismissed from the Company's ser» vice, were re-instated at his instigation. This has caused resentment in many quarters, especially in view of the fact that they had been tools of the Tudeh Party and strongly antl-Company in their sentiments. 45. On March 9th, the Ministry of Labour in Tehran announced that Iftikhari (the leader of the Oil Workers' Union) had been appointed ^a member of the Grand Council of the United Syndics of Iranian Labour, which is the Labour Union organised by the Democrat Party of Iran. He was immediately accused by the Union's members of double-crossing them, but he hotly denied this and sent telegrams of protest and denial to Tehran and Issued pamphlets locally to the effect that he was a genuine Trade Unionist and that he had no connexion whatever with the politically sponsored U.S.I.L. ll&amp;ll OF XH&amp; W.F.I .U . - DhLLGATION 46. The above delegation paid a visit to Abadan during the month. It consisted of a Syrian (El Aries), a Russian (Borisov), a French man (Malfitte) and an Englishman (Harries). Owing to the delay in the arrival at Tehran of El Aries, the British delegate obtained Instructions from his principals in London and arrived in Abadan independently on the 15th. He was shown round the Refinery and spoke to a number of workers and interviewed Yusuf Iftikhari, with whom he discussed the affairs of the Oil Workers' Union. He left for Isfahan on the 17th. The remainder of the delegation arrived in Abadan on the 22nd and left on the 24th March. During their visit they were conducted through the Refinery and other departments of the Company and on the afternoon of the 24th give Interviews to anybody wishing to see them at the office of the Ministry of Labour. El Aires was button-holed by the Arab employees from whom he re ceived numberous complaints regarding thermctivities of the Tudeh. The delegates left for Ahwaz and Bandar Mashur on the same evening. NAVAL 47. The Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf paid an official visit to Khorramshahr on the Ifith March in H.M.S. 'wild Goose'. Gun salutes were fired in turn by H.M. Ship and the Iranian Naval Base and the Senior Naval Officer exchanged calls with H.M. Consul, the Iranian Naval Officer in Charge and the Civil and Military Governors of Khorramshahr and Abadan. The Senior Naval Officer left for Bahrain on the 23rd. During his visit, 300 rounds of 12-pounder ammunition was supplied to the Iranian Navy. 48. Reference paragraph 33 of Diary No. 2. Salvage operations on the 'Palang' and 'Ivy' continued during the month. The first attempt by the Salvage Party to raise the 'Palang' at Abadan was unsuccessful and it is understood that efforts are now being made to tow the wreck down-stream and beach it. The Steam Yacht 'Ivy' at the Khorramshahr Naval Base is expected to be re-floated shortly. / LOCAL DEPARTMENTS. EgjJrSg* Colonel Azadrad, Chief of Police, Abadan, left for Tehran on transfer on March 20th. The reason for his transfer is said to be that he was considered neither energetic nor capable enough for the important task of maintaining law and order in Abadan at the high level required. Lieutenant Colonel Rafii, who had arrived earlier in the month and assumed the duties of Deputy Chief of Police, was appointed to officiate in Colonel Azadrad's place. LieutenantClX © &lt;© - 3 - Lieutenant-Colonel Hafll has the reputati Of being an energetic officer and is reported to have taken very ITrm XCtloil to suppress the May Day demonstrations which took place last year in Kerman- shah, where he was Acting Chief of Police at the time. 50. Police reinforcements of officers 9 clerks and constables arrived in large numbers from Tehran and the constable strength of the Abadan Police was brought up to full establishment during the month. Accommodation for the new arrivals in however extremely short and they have freely expressed their dissatisfaction at housing conditions here. It is expected that the A.I.O.C. will eventually have to find accommodation for them at the expense of Jthelr own employees. 53-* Military &gt; In the Nauruz Honours 9 Lieutenant Colonel Sami 1 ! the Military Governor of Abadan 9 was promoted to the rank of a full Colonel. 52. Sk It is expected that 9 in view of the improvement in the general situation in this area 9 the Military Governorate may be abolished within the next month or two. Meanwhile 9 there is an acute shortage of accommodation for the Military Garrison on Abadan Island and the Military authorities have asked the Company for the use of one section of the former U.S. Air Base as tempo rary barracks for one battalion. It is understood that the Company have agredd to their request in spite of the very serious inconvenience it will cause them. SSXMX.MmM 53. M. Novikov 9 the Soviet Consul at Ahwaz 9 accompanied by his Vice-Consul and Interpreter, arrived in Khorramshahr on the 2nd and left on the 4th. He visited a number of local merchants during his stay and it is rumoured that the Russians intend opening a Trade Agency here. The party visited Khorramshahr and Abadan again on the 6th and called on the local Governors. The purpose of these visits may have been to contact the Soviet Representative of the W.F.T.U. Delegation, but, when questioned, they stated that they were arranging for a further shipment of silver to India. mmin 54. The improvement in security continued to be maintained during the month. The Military Governor addressed a request to the A.I.O.C. to tighten up control measures at the Refinery gate, in case of possible attempts by Jewish elements to emulate the activities of their compatriots in Palestine, by sabotaging the oil installations. He was furnished with nominal rolls of all Jews employed by the Company. 55. He has a£Lso protested against the lack of control in the Bashgar Iran (Iranian Club), which undesirable elements are able to enter without check or hindrance and which has become one of the worst centres for Intrigue in Abadan. The Company have agreed in principle to a proposal to decentralize the Club by building smaller ones in the residential areas. M&amp;kQrMmmMk 56. Aghai Aramesh, Minister of Labour and Propaganda, arrived in Abadan on March 23rd and held long discussions with the Compa ny's Management on various points of interest, including the fix ation of a minimum wage for unskilled labour in Khuziwtan, a sub ject on which he appeared most anxious to /(make a public announce ment.

It 3^ strongly criticised the scale of wages paid by the Company to its labourers, which, it stated, was quite inadequate to off-set the high cost of living in this area. It maintained that the recent wage increase granted by the Company to its labourers, was a cunning move, for, at the same time, the Company had abolished Control Pay and Service Pay and the workers will now receive their basic wages only. It suggested that the minimum wage should be fixed at Rials 55/- per day. 73. As a result of the interest displayed by H.M. Consulate in the work of the A.I*-0.C, Public Relations Organisation in regard to its Iranian-labour, the circulation of the Company^ News Sheet has been increased from 350 to 1000 copies a day, and arrangements made for distribution to all workshops and other departments of the Company where there is labour personnel at work. MISCELLANEOUS 74, About 100 Iranian Jews held a meeting at the Khorramshahr Synagogue in the middle of April, with a view to collecting funds for Palestine Jewry, The organisers of the movement are: ' 1.

They decided to stage a performance on the following day for the same purpose, but the Iraqi Jews, who had refused to associate them selves with this movement, complained to the Governor, who took steps to disperse the gathering a few minutes before the per formance was scheduled to commence. The local authorities have again asked the Company to tighten up security measures in the Refinery area. 75. Attempts have been made by Aghai Navidi, the Manager of the Yab Water and Electric Company, to form a Company to under take lighterage in Khorramshahr Port. The proposal has failed to produce any enthusiasm amongst the local merchants, who are^ well acquainted with Navidi*s unscrupulous methods in business^ transactions. Sd.

African and Eastern (Iran) Limited, after having been dismissed by the Oil Company. OIL WORKERS * UNION 91. There has been little or no activity by this body during the month. definite results are the onl^- factors which the workers understand, and the Union's failure to secure better wages and living conditions, which have been promised by its leaders, cannot be calculated to retain their'enthusiasm or to bring in subscriptions. The general opinion is that the rapidity with which the Union is losing ground is chiefly att ributable to the renewed attacks which the Tudeh Party has been making on it, and it is expected that the complete liquidation of the Union is not far off. Yusuf Iftikhari himself appears to be disheartened and has hinted that he will close down the Union unless some improvement sets in shortly, eventhough such an action would be an undoubted triumph for the Tudeh Party. MILITARY 92, Reference paragraph 81 of Diary No. 5.

ANGLO-IRANIAN Oil COMPANY 100.
