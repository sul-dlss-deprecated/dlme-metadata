UNREST IN KURDISTAN ; SITUATION DURING SEPTEMBER 4th - 18th, 1941. The first news to reach me that supporters of Sheikh Mahmud had crossed the frontier and attacked Iranian military- posts, was received hy me on the 4th September when General Mogaddam asked me to call and see him. At his house he produced a number of telegrams, one of which he shewed me; it was apparently from the Commander of the Iranian Military post at Durud (West of Sanandaj), who reported that large numbers (about 1,000) of Iraqi Kurds had crossed the frontier and that with about 1,000 Iranian Kurds who had rallied to their support, they were attacking several military posts. The telegram mentioned that the Iraqi attackers had called upon the Commander of the Iranian garrison to surrender n in the name of the King of the Kurds’*. General Moqaddam had taken a serious view of this report and had asked me if I could bring the news to the notice of the British Military Authorities here and of the British Embassy in Bagdad. 2* In reply, I had said that I would at once report t© General Slim what he had told me and I would telegraph t© Tehran and Bagdad on the same subject. I added that I had no knowledge of Sheikh Mahmud^ present whereabouts and that the last news that I had heard of him described him to be living quietly in his tribal district; I said that I therefore felt it difficult to believe that Sheikh Mahmud could really be the cause of the trouble which he had described. 3. Half an hour later I repeated to General Slim what General Moqaddam had reported and how seriously the latter regarded the matter. General Slim inrnediately sent Colonel Roberts (G.S.0. I) to discuss the matter with General Moqaddam and in view of the possible threat to the British garrison in Sanandaj and to lines of communication additional mechanised forces were sent into Kurdistan* 4 4. During the past fortnight British patrols have scoured large areas in search of the Iraqi invaders (and of hidden rifles) and I have been given to understand that practically no sign of the Iraqi intruders has been seen. It seems probable, therefore, that the telegram shewn to me by General Moqaddam was based on inaccurate information and that Sheikh Mahmud’s ’’invasion” was nothing more serious than one of the occasioixal frontier incidents which relieve the monotony of life among the Kurds. It is, of course, possible that many Iraqi Kurds are still in Iran living among their Iranian fellow-tribesmen and making common cause with the latter in their revengeful attacks upon Iranian garrisons; to distinguisn these Iraqis from their Iranian Kurdish friends might well be difficult. Indeed, officers returning from patrols in Kurdistan have stated that they saw there no signs of disorder or of Iraqi Kurds. It would, however, be dangerous to take for granted that Iranian Kurdistan is clear of Iraqi Kurds because the latter were not in evidence in large numbers. British Military patrols might easily have been misled into taking the view that no Iraqi Kurds were in certain areas because no strangers were seen and tne local population gave assurances that no Iraqi Kurds were among . iem.Co 5. At present, Iranian Kurds are, like the Lurs and other tribesmen in the Kermanshah district, raiding their enemies’ villages in traditional style and lawlessness is rife in most districts of Kurdistan. The Iranian Military Authorities are still too disorganised to send adequate forces to Kurdistan in order to restore order or to disarm the Iranian Kurds and their Iraqi kinsmen who are with them. The British Military Authorities have a small garrison at Sanandaj and carry out patrols in order to maintain undisturbed their lines of communication with Kermanshah, but these British patrols have obviously been unable to circulate throughout the whole length and breadth of Kurdistan and brigandage continues spasmodically where British Military patrols have not made their appearance, in Kurdistan, as in other parts of this Consular district. 6. It has not been possible to obtain confirmation of General Moqaddam's report that the Iraqi Kurds who on September 4th attacked frontier posts and garrisons in Iranian Kurdistan attempted to stir up in Iran feelings of Kurdish nationalism. Enquiries on this point are being made and a further report will be submitted later. (Signed). J.R. VAUGHAK-RUSSELL. H.3.M. CONSUL.

In conversation v/hich I had with the Shah at a banquet on October 26th [? group omitted] spoke of the Treaty as agreed upon in principle but stressed the need of assistance not only in economic but in military matters. He again seemed to contemplate large Persian army with equipment supplemented from Great Britain or America. He said that army not only lacked ammunition but v/as almost entirely with out supply services, e.g. it had not a single field bakery. I suggested to the Shah that the Prime Minister, who was present, would tell me Persia needed wheat more than munitions and I spoke of internal military needs as coming first. Since then member of the General Staff has called to develop same theme and been met with the same reminder about internal situation. 2.

Attempt to enforce, on receipt of further instructions from Tehran Government full selling price has led to refusal of bakers to buy wheat followed by a serious bread riot this morning. Bread, almost the sole food for the majority of poor population, already 66% higher than before British occupation and the enforcement of the above-mentioned order v/ould further increase the cost of bread or else result in quality badly deteriorating. Rioting was therefore understandable. The disturbance was quelled promptly by Persian military intervention. General Officer Commanding immediately issued proclamation stating that the price of bread would not be raised, and that no wheat would leave Kermanshah until its. full requirements had been met. The Government buying price in force before August 25th, if not profitable to growers, was at least reasonable, and it seems difficult to justify the recent increase. Although this seemingly ill-advised increase has.been ordered by the Persian Government, the British authorities are blamed for it, and anti-British feeling has been further stimulated. Unless bread can be sold at a price little greater than that ruling last August, the situation will remain serious, and incidents are likely to recur. R£Cd. POL. EaSPt, ;cr 91!

Lieutenant Colonel Fletcher. Political Adviser, has returned from Bagdad and acquainted me with discussions held with General Quinan, His Majesty’s Ambassador, and various officials regarding the present dangerous situation in Kurdistan. Persian authorities seem doubtful of the sincerity of our avowed desire to support central government and interpret friendly contacts with Kurds as sign that British military authorities are indirectly encouraging Kurdish aspirations. On the other hand tne Kurds apparently regard the official British attitude of support for Persian Government to be at variance with friendly attitude shewn by our troops when contacts made, and have been restrained from attacking Sanandaj chiefly because hopes have been raised that negotiations with Persia would take place under British auspices. As British military authorities are opposed to action in Kurdistan which might involve troops in conflict with the Kurds and appear fearful that, by acting as intermediaries in above mentioned negotiations, they may become involved, and therefore must dissociate themselves from such a scheme, there is the risk that the opportunity may be lost of applying to this delicate problem almost the sole remaining expedient for preventing clashes or restoring calmness in Kurdistan. Although British military considerations are of paramount importance m Persia at present, I submit that one should not minimise the dangers which may arise if the Persians and Kurds get to grips, and also the serious political reper cussions which may well result if negotiations are discouraged - or fail to materialise. [Gp. omitted: ?if] negotiations take place valuable time will be gained and even if British authorities convene the meeting, it should be possible to avoid British military commitments.

Situation elsewhere in Kemanshah district more disturbed than ever, but new Persian General Officer Commanding seems confident that with new volunteer force he.is raising he will without much difficulty disarm all brigands and crush resistance.

Possibly a suggestion that Persian Government would do well to pay fuller regard to the realities of p resent situation might have some effect. RECd.

He said that the present Government was not popular*, and maintained that there were three main sections of opinion in Persia. The first he described as reactionary and composed of landlords and the army: among these he nut Feroughi and Soheili. The second section, which included the Minister of Finance was composed of merchants and intellectuals and was generally in favour f of reform. The third section he described as the people's party and mentioned Suleiman Mirza as its leader, Tsee Sir R. Clive's despatch 337 of 13th July, 1927). He said this section was compgsed of intellectuals who had been persecuted under the old regime, that they championed the cause of the Eurooean democracies, and that they favoured collaboration with the Allies. He thought that perhaps the best Government of Persia would be a combination of the second and third sections, I replied that I felt sure it would be a great mistake to do anything to disturb the present Government just now. Feroughi was a friend of ours and so was Soheili. They had given valuable service at a critical period and I should certainly not wish to take any action'to bring about a change without further thought and full consultation with you. The Ambassador at once replied that he was not suggesting a change now. It would be a mistake to disturb Feroughi, but he was an old man and it was perhaps wise to look ahead. He fully agreed that I should consult you and did not press the matter strongly. Ambassador also said that present Government had not broken off relations with Germany. Can you explain this statement?

I agree that a Custodian's Department should be set up to sequester and administer enemy assets. As Persia is not at war the word 'enemy' v/ill have to be avoided in any Persian legislation. Proposal that representatives of the Soviet Embassy and His Majesty's Legation should assist in supervising the Department s operations has obvious advantages, but would entail more open interference with Persia’s independence than there has been in either Egypt or Iraq. 2, In-Egypt a decree whose general lines follow our Trading With The Enemy Act is in force, whereby German and Italian property and the property of nationals of most countries in enemy occupation is vested in custodians who pay any debts due and guard the balance of the assets until the end of the war. The custodians are Egyptians whose actions are, in theory, completely free from British influence, while they are in practice not altogether amenable to guidance. In Iraq, under a regulation called 'The Control of Foreign Property Regulation' much the same thing has been done as in Egypt except that the 'controller' is a British subject. As the Iraqi Government employs a number of British officials there is no overt limitation on Iraq's independence in this appointment. 3. The Persian Government would naturally dislike a greater degree of foreign control than has been imposed either in Iraq or in Egypt, and I leave it to you to make whatever proposals you think are likely to achieve our object without upsetting the Persians. You should, of course, consult with your Soviet colleague. INDIV^ a j v*/h • [CYPHER] With the Com of the Jr4er Secrete W*. € .VO.R . 0 ^Sir H.

He said that he himself was worried because the situation had deteriorated since the subject was first raised in that (a) Russians were being pushed back and no-one could say whether the Germans would not reach the Caucasus (b) Turkey seemed to be weakening (c) population of Persia would not^ be easily reconciled to an alliance with U.S.S.R. after the behaviour of Russians in Persia and in particular in the neighbourhood of the capital. ^ 2 ) I made the best case I could for prospects of Russian resistance and Turkish firmness, and said that many of the stories told about the conduct of the Russians were' grossly exaggerated. As arguments in favour of a treaty of alliance I said that (a) events had shown that to remain completely neutral was impossible (b) Germans would occupy Persia if they could and v/hether population were treated like Bulgarians or like Norwegians would not make much difference i G Mu ? rsia was com Pl e 't e ly dependent on the Allies for certain foodstuffs and other imports, population should understand that.

R*|: 5 SI British military authorities at Sultanabad report riot caused by shortage and high price of sugar which the Governor attributes to hoarding by merchants, Sultanabad awaiting the. arrival of seven waggons of sugar from Ahwaz for which the British military authorities could secure_priority_if necessary* General sugar shortage will be relieved it is hoped by rationing which is to be tried in some towns, bp local production now beginning, by gradual arrival of 45,000 tons ordered in Netherlands Bast Indies and by any_ sugar that India sends.* It will be remembered that with normal local production Persia requires about 90,000 tons of sugar per annum from overseas. 2. I'here is also the question of prices. Controlled price is low but sugar obtained legitimately or illegitimately is re-sold at very high prices. The Government are thinking of raising controlled price to cover increased cost of transport. Our competition for lorries has probably tended to raise cost of internal transport and.sea freight is heavy especially from Netherlands East Indies. The reason for raising price of bread was explained in my telegram above-mentioned. 5. British Officer-Commanding at Sultanabad suggests that the Governor should be instructed from Tehran to ensure release of food of all kinds at low price. So far as sugar and bread are concerned, where there lias been complete State^control, reduction in price means that State must pay the difference. Fixing of prices for other commodities is' not rigidly effective in Persia, where it often exists in name, as sellers withhold goods and sell privately. 4. Nevertheless, wo cannot wash our hands of this question which.affects public security, especially as wo broadcast our intention to send food after the troops. It is/• is^r^p'ortccL that when the British column visited Isfahan its peoj^Lc asked whether it had brought sugar.

IMPORTANT. eeeeeee My telegram No. 918. 3^3 t*.a. t 3 s-C\ , I I recently received secret message from the Shah saying that he would like to see me fairly often alone and without \ the knowledge of politicians: he said that he felt that some 1 Ministers distorted the truth for their own benefit and mentioned various_constitutional and administrative questions on which he would like my advice. He v/ished, he said, to have the supuort . of the British Empire and to work in close agreement with His iMajesty s Legation with greatest discretion. I sent a reply s that while I would ask for instructions I was sure that it would not be possible for me to be received without the [knowledge of the Persian Cabinet and my Soviet colleague. t , 2.1 had in fact already suggested to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was present at my first interview, that it might be a good thing for His Majesty to talk to representatives alone and before I could in fact ask for instructions I received through Minister for Foreign Affairs invitation to call on His Majesty on October 14th. 3. . This time His Majesty made very good impression and I now actribute to the presence of Minister for Foreign Affairs the fact that on the previous occasion the Shah talked so much himself and concentrated upon the conventional view of the army. Uhis time he asked many questions, did not make long monologues and was reasonable and modest in his statements. ,, x His Majesty began by hoping that the final text of the ureaty would soon be presented. He seemed to take the con ?i u ? 10 ? ' the i :rea 'ky for granted though he said that there ought to [grp. undec, ? be] some propaganda to lead up to it. Ho spoke mucn.about the desire for particularly close relations o * 1 • l- Britain] but this time he snowed consciousness that bovieu Russia could not be ignored and I was therefore not obliged to emphasise this.2. m . . 5. Conversation turned iiainly on three subjects (a) internal politics. He regretted that his father after establishing order had not given the people more liberty. He despised the deputies who after abject sub mission to the laae Shah, were now so violent in criticism but that did not change his feelings which were naturally democratic. He thought that his people were also democratic in feeling but they badly needed advice how to out that feeling into a.ction. He was thinking of broad casting something on his birthday reminding- the people that each is responsible to his neighbour socially and politically. \rj) The Army. This tine' the Shah tended to trumpet its prowess but spoke with regret of the corruption and cruelty in it, of which he seemed to be fully cognisant. He believed that given better gay there were, enough decent officers to compose useful force and the rest especially certain generals ought to be retired. He hoped that His majesty's Government would help with aviation. ■ ■ (c) Propaganda, by His Hajesty's Government. He thought that we ought to own a newspaper- in Tehran to preach the advantages of Angio-Persian co-operation and to explain.th^ benefits and also the difficulties of democracy. We should also both in this newspaper and on the wireless, compare the Persian and British love of freedom. Broadly in order to combat .pro-German feeling here we should constantly describe*conditions in restive countries so.that Persian people might realise what would happen if Persia were occupied by. the Germans. .. k.,6. I have reported interview 4-V at .length because it corrects the-- regression left by previous one and shows His Majesty in-a. .good'light. It is not necessary to report at -eoual length what I said in.an interview which lasted 5 hours. For advice about propaganda I thanked His Majesty and said that it would be considered with greatest attention. In message received beforehand there had been signs that His Majesty wanted to begin dismissing and appointing individual Ministers and although this is within his nominal powers i suggested.that in. constitutional matters he should for the present watch the machine of Government at work even if he felt that his intervention might effect improvements. I supported strongly his proposal to encourage Persians after a period of strenuous material development to devote attention to personal virtues. *. • 7: His Majesty did not again suggest that I should^ see him freouently, but he sent word that he realised this would, be difficult for a Minister but hoped Counsellor might see him say twice a week. I have much sympathy wiuh the Shall 5 s desire to learn how best to serve his country at a moment of international and internal # crisis but he would not accomplish that object by attaching himself exclusively to one power. There are obvious objections to frequent and exclusive visits whether secret or open. The Shah would tend more and more to regard us as a bulwark against Soviet Russia, and might be encouraged by talks to feel he understood public business and.•e••ft 3. and to intervene inaffairs of Government. He lias yet to consolidate his position (though there seems to he very little criticism of him now) and for that, a non political role should he followed. If he became publicly identified with His Majesty’s Government he would.suffer for our real or alleged mistakes and we for his, our relations with Persian Government would be embarrassed (e.g. there are signs that His ‘Majesty is being backed by Minister for Foreign Affairs against Prime Minister); and Soviet Government would have grounds for their at present baseless suspicions and would be tempted to set in motion those violent forces which it would be easy to provoke. His Majesty should I consider see all foreign representatives and all foreigners of distinction and if he happens to see British rather more often than the others it would hardly be noticeable.^ ^’~' v ^' Tjents _ OUTWARD TELEGRAM 4 ^ ^ v, y of State vAj&amp;jc (ffpcg .

Vj^aaI^iu. emissary of Hama Rashid Khan (who is now in control at Bana) has visited the Embassy. He declared that he had been sent to ask the British Government to establish a protectorate over Persian Kurdistan and to save the Kurds from Persian tyranny. 2. He was told that the best course for the Persian Kurds was to come to a settlement with the head of the Persian Government._ ^If they did this it might be possible for us to help by advising the Persians to be conciliatory. . 3. The emissary obstinately maintained that, after their past experience, it was quite impossible for the Kurds ever to accept Persian rule again and enquired whether it was the British Government's intention to re-impose Persian rule over them by force. He was told in reply that so long as the Persian Kurds helpud our forces when required to do so and gave them no trouble it was unlikely that British forces would take any military action against them. He must understand, however, that any disorders which impeded our war effort would be iirmly suppiesseu. The emissary left Bagdad on October U-th for Bana. # spite of the emissary's flat refusal to consider a compromise with the Persian Government and in spite of the lailure of the first efforts of the local Persian authorities to come to terms with [gr. undec.j Kurds it seems probable that before long (unless there is still further weakening of the authority of.the Central Government) both sides will seek a modus vivendi and I think from our point of view that it is desirable that they should do so. 5* A .successful Persian re-conquest of Kurdistan seems at present impossible and the continuation of the struggle between, the Kurds and Persia v/ill make an uneasy situation in the vicinity of our line of communications. Similar, inevitably, disagreeable consequences would follow a situation ol general tribal chaos which is a not improbable development if the tribes are left to themselves. 6 ./ KECd.POL.

A Kurdish sub-governor for Sauj Bulagh would also probably be necessary. 9. Such arrangements, if they appear to you to be sound, would have, I think, to be inspired by the Central Government and negotiated with the Kurdish chiefs by a special representative from thu capital. The return to Persia of some of the exiled Kurdish chiefs who are now in Simla and are particularly amenable to our influence would no doubt help to stabilise the situation, 10.

We entirely agree with the Government of India on this question and realise that they must be on their guard lest Soviet Communist and separatist propaganda should affect areas outside those under Russian occupation. As long ago as the 11th September (our telegram No. 1236, to Moscow) Sir Stafford Cripps was instructed to emphasise that everything should be done to prevent the breakdown of the civil administration and to stress the danger of inciting the Persian people and Army against the government. Since then the Secretary of State spoke to M. Maisky on the 23rd September, the 28th September and the 8th October about rumours of separatist movements encouraged by the Soviet Government in Azerbaijan and Khorassan. I enclose copies of the telegrams in question, which were all repeated to the Government of India. In the circumstances, I hope you will agree that we can hardly say anything more in Moscow, particularly at a time when the Soviet Government have so many other preoccupations. R.T.

I spoke to the Soviet Ambassador on 23rd September about the position in Persian Azerbaijan. I said I understood that there had been a movement, especially among the Armenian minority, in favour of the separation of that province from Persia and its eventual federation with the Soviet Union, Considerable apprehension appeared to exist lest these separatist tendencies should be encouraged by the Soviet military authorities in Tabriz, It appeared that on their first arrival the Soviet forces had armed many imenian irregulars to keep order in Azerbaijan, but that these Armenians had since been disanued. About the 1st September, a large open-air meeting had been held in Tabriz, which was chiefly attended by Armenians who demanded independence for Azerbaijan and its federation with the Soviet Union, but the Soviet military authorities had wisely prevented a second public meeting from being held with the same object in view. A petition had, however, been circulated in the same sense. 2. I said that it seemed to me most important that no encouragement should be given to the movement for autonomy in Azerbaijan by the Soviet Government, The effect of any such action on Turkey and on the Moslem population in other parts of Persia would be deplorable. The Ambassador replied that he felt sure that the Soviet authorities had no such intention. Indeed, I myself had told him that the Soviet military authorities had prevented a second public meeting from being held in Tabriz, replied that though this was so, I attached so much importance to the matter that I hoped the Ambassador would telegraph to his Government reporting what I had said.

He realises that the contingency may be remote but suggests that it should be envisaged as a possibility since wheat and sugar are already^insufficient for local population and so are medical supplies. I did not accept the possibility as of practical importance but since we must envisage all contingencies, this one must not be overlooked. Transport facilities in Persia are being rapidly developed and would be adequate for food and medical supplies since presumably transport of war material would diminish, but whether stocks of wheat etc. could be found suddenly is another matter. 2, Stocks of rice and meat would be adequate and fortunately they are in the North.WT' (f (issi/Souhn) With th® C^msirmnante of the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affair* 4 J 4 + £a*A ?) •' [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should he retained by the authorised recipient^** and not passed on],, [Cypner]• WixR Ci,EIKET DISTRIBUTION.

Since v/ithdrawal from Tehran is one of the advantages which the Persian Government hope to obtain from signing the proposed treaty (f alliance, you may think it best that it should be arranged with Persian authorities as part of treaty negotiations. You might for example tell the Persians that we have decided on v/ithdrawal in principle, and that it will be carried out v/hen treaty is signed. 3. Alternatively, you and your Soviet colleague might now inform the Persian Government that decision has been taken and v/ithdrav/al will take place, but that this decision has been taken on the assumption, v/hich we shall be glad if they v/ill confirm, that Persian Government are in principle prepared to accept treaty of alliance on the lines of the draft communicated to them. 4, If however you think it best that allied troops should be withdrav/n at earliest possible moment regard less of treaty negotiations, you may arrange accordingly. 5.

JJJJJ My immediately preceding telegram [proposed withdrawal of Anglo-Soviet troops from Tehran]. Soviet Ambassador did not know whether substance of this letter.had.been telegraphed to your Soviet colleapne for communication to the Persian Government at a suitable moment, 2, I thanked the Ambassador and said that I was all the more pleased to receive this letter since I feared that matters had not been going well in Persia lately. There had been rumours of separatist movements encouraged by the Soviet Government in Azerbaijan and Khorasan. There had also been some.friction between Persian and Soviet authorities. The Persian Government had delivered a note to the Soviet Ambassador and to ourselves which was clearly unwise, and you had expressed this view to the Persian Government, but I thought we should not allow ourselves to be provoked by this act of foplishness on the part of the Persian Government. From the point.of view of our common war effort there was nothing to be gained and much to be lost by disorders in Persia. I knew of no alternative Government to the present Government, and if this collapsed we should be left with the formidable task of trying to run the country for ourselves. What we wanted in Persia was a'through route for supplies for Russia. To ensure this we wanted a peaceful and friendly Persia. 3. Soviet Ambassador said that he agreed with all that I had said, and begged me to believe that the only reason for his Government s delay in replying to my various messages was that they were now preoccupied m Moscow with the military situation« He was hourly expecting to receive his Government's reply about the Treaty. . ' ' 4* I replied that I fully understood the difficulties and was making no complaint. Our only concern in Persia was to be of help to the Soviet Government and secure a safe winter route for supplies.

Ambassador has asked Minister for Foreign Affairs for an interview to talk about many acts of 'provocation'^by Persia (this however means that many Persians are talking with more or less exaggeration about the behaviour of Soviet forces). Ambassador even, according to Minister for Foreign Affairs, suggested that story of robbery reported in my telegram No. 920 had been invented by Minister of Communications and adduced in support of this theory that Minister s brother who went to Russia many years ago as a Communist had given Soviet Government much trouble, [ 2 grps. undep.J it is believed the trouble of shooting him. State of mind of the Soviet Embassy is thus not favourable for Treaty negotiations. Persian Government are partly to blame for presenting such a note and also in disregarding my repeated advice never to compare Soviet conduct unfavourably with ours in Soviet’s hearing; but fault lies mainly with behaviour of Soviet forces which have spread under pressure of events, over so wide and important an area. i05 y/tW ^ •f the?

He also said that the ote was not directed against us but against the Soviet authorities. This will have been obvious to the Soviet Embassy // 2 . Embassy from the reference to. securityespecially the phrase 'disarmed the forces responsible for security so that internal security^ was gravely prejudiced' and it accounts largely for the anger of the ambassador who described the note to me as provocative' (ominous word in Soviet vocabulary) and as showing that co-operation could not be expected from the present Government, He even ' compared .the note to the pro-Axis-article which helped al:) ? ut the occu P atl on of the capital..

I am disturbed by signs that Soviet authorities here are suspicious of us. According to Governor of Tehran, Soviet Military Attach^ a few days ago, after enjoining secrecy, said that Soviet authorities suspected that British 'were working against Soviet interests and asked him to watch us and report. I might have believed this to be invented to sow dissension between allies but just then Soviet Military Attach^ who had been asked by our Military Attach^ for a pass for the Caspian for two British officers replied in writing that owing to storms on the Caspian visit would not interest the officers. Also four Royal Air Force officers who, acting on orders from Bagdad, asked Soviet Military authorities for permission to return to Iraq via Tabriz and to inspect Persian aerodromes on the way had waited a week without reply. 2. Suspicioins may be due to fact that before passes began to be required British officers entered Soviet °rea rather freely. I understand that the two officers referred to in paragraph 1 were in fact going on reconnaisance, that a British Intelligence Officer travelling in Azerbaijan with an American observer was arrested by Soviet authorities and interrogated at great length, and that Soviet Command in Tiflis were very suspicious at our sending there as Royal Air Force officer Mr. Lockhart of Anglo-Persian Company. Perhaps Soviet Government [? spotted] connexion betv/een such visits and your appeal to Soviet Ambassador in London about Azerbaijan (your ngm™ jin. 1815h _ Acts which might noTdTsturb other’allies might seem highly suspicious to Soviet minds. It appears on the other hand that no Soviet officers have attempted to enter territory occupied by us except as members of official parties and with our consent and I gather that we should not welcome such attempt. RCCo* POL. DKPr» 7 OCT 941 INDIA OFFICE 3. /u 3. It is possible'however that suspicions have been aroused by the Soviet agents of our Foreign Office polioy. The Soviet army is accompanied by Uaminsnors and Ogpu with-pre-conceived opinions about us. I spoke to my Soviet colleague with whom I am l (Sm excellent terms about the- suspicions which I felt K existed and.though he tried to explain everything away H he looked confused; On the whole the evidence suggests n. x that the Soviet Government wish to convert Northern Persia to the Soviet idea before they leave (if they ever do leave), that weakening of all authority is part ol that scheme, and' that our policy, very desirable to override central government, runs counter to theirs. Suspicion may diminish as our efforts to increase transit trade to Russia becomes more apparent especially il the proposed commiss ion (your telegram Mo. 81M treats relation to that trade. I am confident that His Majesty’s Legation have done their best to give no cause for suspicion,, On the military side perhaps General, Iraq, will consider what can be done to re-assure the Soviet military authorities. 4. Although.our policy is directed towards increasing supplies to Russia and is in accordance with our .joint declarations it is opposed to what must be the ultimate policy of Soviet Russia namely the absorption of Persia. Uniortunately Soviet Russia has several advantages over (1) the.common people of Persia suffer from grievances which the Soviet propaganda finds it easy enough to exploit (2) Persian ruling class through whom we have to work are worthless. (3) Soviet authprities in Northern Persia have only to continue their present policy to cripple the South, discredit us and arouse desperation in^the people.3. / With tb&amp; Compliment* of the Under of 3tote f@r Fore-^n Affair* -6 OCT 194?

Also four Royal Air Force officers who, acting on orders from Bagdad, asked Soviet Military authorities for permissipn to return to Iraq via Tabriz and to inspect Persian aerodromes on the way had waited a week without re ply,. 2. Suspicioins may be due to fact that before passes began to be required British officers entered Soviet °rea rather freely. I understand that the two officers referred to in paragraph 1 were in fact going on [ reconnaisance, that a British Intelligence Officer travelling in Azerbaijan with an American observer was : arrested by Soviet authorities and interrogated at great length* and that Soviet Command in Tiflis were very suspicious at our sending there as Royal Air Force officer Mr. Lockhart of Anglo-Persian Company. Perhaps Sqviet Government [? spotted] connexion between such visits and your appeal to Soviet Ambassador in London about Azerbaijan tyour telegram Ho. 1813). Acts which might not disturb other allies might seem highly suspicious to Soviet minds. It appears on the other hand that no Soviet officers have attempted to enter territory occupied by us except as members of official parties and with our consent and I gather that we should not welcome such attempt.A. 3. It is possible'however that suspicions have been aroused by the Soviet agents of our Foreign Office policy. The Soviet army is accompanied by CcEimisrars and Ogpu with pre-conceived opinions about us. I spoke to my Soviet colleague with whom I ami om^excellent terms about the suspicions which I felt existed and though he tried to explain everything away he looked confused. ■- On the vrtiole the evidence suggests that the Soviet Government wish to convert Northern Persia to the Soviet idea before they leave (if they ever do leave), that weakening of all authority is part of that scheme, and that our policy, very desirable to override•central government, runs counter to theirs. Suspicion may diminish as our efforts to increase : transit trade to Russia becomes more apparent especially rf the proposed commission (your telegram No. 813) treats all prpbl^ms ip rCUtign to that trade, I am confident that His Majesty s Le^gation havei done their best to give no cause for_sus*picion&lt;, On the military side perhaps General, iraq, will consider what can be done to re-assure the Soviet military authorities. , . , •» &gt; « * • y ^ 4. Although.our policy is directed towards increasing supplies^to Russia ana is in accordance with our joint ^declarations it is opposed to what must be the ultimate {Policy of Soviet Russia namely the absorption of Persia. •Unfortunately Soviet Russia has several advantages over us (1) the common people of Persia suffer from grievances which the Soviet propaganda finds it easy enough to exploit (2) Persian ruling class through whom we have to work are worthless, (3) Soviet authorities in Northern Persia have only to continue their present policy to cripple the South, discredit us and arouse desperation in the people.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be kept LOCK and KEY.] / With thy Corvt£!fm0nt8 G Of / un-der Secretary of 3ftftt0 Foreign Affairs [Cypher], GENERAL DISTRIBUTION.

Soviet Ambassador who was at first in favour of con siderable combined withdrawal of Allied troops from Tehran has gradually turned round, though difficulties which their presence causes are a constant source of embarrassment to him. He now says Soviet troops ought to stay until every thing is running properly. There is no doubt that in many respects it is the presence of Soviet troops that prevents this. I am reliably informed for instance that orficial sent out under an assurance from the Soviet Embassy to pay workers on the roads was relieved of money by first Soviet post and turned back with a rude message Igrp.omitted ?to the] Soviet Ambassador. This is one example of many. 2., According to Minister for Foreign Affairs he asked the Soviet Ambassador on October 5rd if any foreign troops would be withdrawn and the latter replied that only the richer classes wanted that: poorer classes were delighted that Soviet troops should be present. This sounds authentic and probably represents policy of Soviet Govern ment. It also seems to me an excellent argument for trying to secure complete withdrawal from the capital unless there is some military argument for remaining, which no general I have met here has discovered. However small the Soviet force that stays at Tehran, it follows that the whole country east, north and south will be occupied and held by Soviet army.— /fU ~ \ 0&lt;6 [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government, and should under Lock and Key.] £ 65^-3 [Cypher]. •!

General circumstances we hope that you will feel able to instruct H.M.representatives at Moscow and Tehran in the sense suggested by the Government of India We suggest that, in their discussions with the Soviet authorities, Sir h.Bullard am sir Stafford Cripps should lay stress upon the necessity for refraining from the encouragement of an^' political or propagandist tendency/tendency which might endanger the security of the supply- routes.

I spoke to the Soviet Ambassador on 23rd September about the position in Persian Azerbaijan. I said I understood that there had been a movement, especially among the Armenian minority, in favour of the separation of that province from Persia and its eventual federation with the Soviet Union. Considerable apprehension appeared to exist lest these separatist tendencies should be encouraged by the Soviet military authorities in Tabriz. It appeared that on their first arrival the Soviet forces had armed many imenian irregulars to keep order in Azerbaijan, but that these Armenians had since been disarmed. About the 1st September, a large open-air meeting had been held in Tabriz, which was chiefly attended by Armenians who demanded independence for Azerbaijan and its federation with the Soviet Union, but the Soviet military authorities had wisely prevented a second public meeting from being held with the same object in view. A petition had, however, been circulated in the same sense. 2. I said that it seemed to me most important that no encouragement should be given to the movement for autonomy in Azerbaijan by the Soviet Government. The effect of any such action on Turkey and on the Moslem population in other parts of Persia would be deplorable. The Ambassador replied that he felt sure that the Soviet authorities had no such intention. Indeed, I myself had told him that the Soviet military authorities had prevented a second public meeting from being held in Tabriz, replied that though this was so, I attached so much importance to the matter that I hoped the Ambassador would telegraph to his Government reporting what I had said.

Moscow, Cairo and saving to Bagdad and Angora. b b b b b b MvIEDIAlE Both British and Russian trooos in Persia have orders to interfere as little as possible with Civil Administration. Ours interpret this liberally with excellent effect. * Soviet authorities narrower interpretation is having prejudicial effect on communications by' rail, road and telegraph, security, the supply of foodstuffs and other goods to less rich parts of the country, collection of taxes etc. .2. Soviet troops are in possession of the richest provinces. Tehran and the South are [grp.undec.] to those provinces on which they are largely dependent for food and revenue. Non-interference in Civil Administration is not enough. What is wanted is active co-operation to ensure that economic life of the country shall not breakdown as it is in serious danger of doing. I have twice suggested to Soviet iAmbassador that there should be in Tehran a Commission composed, of Soviet, British and Persian representatives empowered to deal ■ with all non-military questions arising out of the occupation, ilHe agrees in principle but is obviously afraid to take action. I have spoken to General Novikov who is in command in the Yfest. is full of good will'but not all his assurances are borne out by experience and in any case he has nothing to do with the troops i n the E ast. What is wanted is a Commissar resident m iehrafl^witTf wide powers to untie the knot caused in the Soviet area by stupidity, fear of responsibility etc. For form's sake tnere would have to be corresponding British representative who might be someone from the-Legation staff. 3, It may be that being on the prosperous side of the line, the Soviet military authorities do not notice that there is a line. Or perhaps the Soviet Government are deliberately favouring the north with an eye to its spontaneous adhesion to Soviet Russia one day. Whatever the' cause, I consider that we ougnt to treat Persia as an economic and political unit as it,2 /X \ it was before the trouble. Otherwise the population in Tehran and south of it will go hungry and the administration ^ will breakdown from lack of money. Anti-allied feeling will then increase and transit of goods and material to Russia will become difficult or impossible - two military reasons which the Soviet Government are unable to understfwid. 4. This is a difficult question to broach to the Soviet Government. Perhaps it can be done by pretending that these difficulties are inevitable and are common to both occupied areas. Can it be taken un while Lord Beaverbrook is in Moscow, as part of the transit problem?.. Unless a solution is round soon the situation will become‘very serious. Compared with this problem, talk about reforms is unimportant. 5. I have refrained from making a great question out of this because I hoped that the difficulties would diminish but while this has happened in some respects, in others there is no improvement and even retrogression.[r=a 'O Urvr4er of Uiv4or /r' CoysA 0 ^ •/ P#r Foreigrt Affftk 1 * [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should he retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on].

Your telegram 1236.to Moscow and my telegram 795 (not repeated to Bagdad and Angora) which repeats Tabriz telegram 47 September 6th repeated to Angora, which I have received via Bagdad. ., ,. . Minister for foreign Affairs read to me today list of reforms which he said the Soviet Ambassador had told him the Soviet Government .expected to. be carried out. The Soviet Ambassador admitted to th.e Jllnister for Foreign Affairs, according to the latterj that he had not spoken to me on the subject.. There is no disagreement as to some of the reforms on the list e.g. transfer or Crown property to the people and reduction of taxation. Two of them, however, have aroused the anxiety of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs viz. (a) there should be a moderate constitution giving to the majority of the population the right to elect Majlis, (b) there should be, at least, minimum of local self- government. 2. One can understand the dislike of the population of Azerbaijan for its Persian rulers who exploited them in the time of peace and ran away the moment danger appeared, and a minimum of self-government would seem to be the least they might expect to obtain under a constitutional regime. Moreover the Soviet Government may feel that they are forced to adopt active policy to counteract German propaganda amongst the Armenians ana attraction of Turkey for Moslems of Azerbaijan, Possibly the separatist policy of the Soviet military authorities in Tabriz would be repudiated by the Soviet Government but the General Officer Commanding [grp. omtd. ?has] political officer attached to him and v/ouid hardly act without authority. I will talk about this to the Soviet Ambassador but he has little influence with the Army Commanders even if he thought fit to use it in this connexion, 3. In a later telegram, the British Consul at Tabriz reports that leading citizens at a meeting with him, admitted general oitterness aboat the Tehran Government and a demand2 - for independence amongst all classes. The Consul advised them against secession, quoting the misfortunes of 1908-12. I have approved his action subject to the views of His Majesty’s Government. 4. Minister for Foreign Affairs fears that other condition might involve demand for 'fresh elections and with a much wider franchise.: It‘is admitted that elections now in progress were 'begun under the Shah’s control and that members already returned \;ust a quorum I believe) might be considered as the Snah’s creatures but to dissolve Majlis would involve departure from the constitution and be an unfortunate precedent. Nor is violent reaction^after years of servility the best mood for elections while it is feared that elections in the areas occupied by the Russians would produce only communist [?deputies] and perhaps lead to revolution. Prime ‘Minister is inclined to induce most objectionable members to resign and to hold fresh elections for their constituencies but except for these changes to carry on with Majlis elected and to ask ihe people to judge it oy its wprks, Whether that will satisfy the people who are so hold now that there is no risk I cannot say, but I sympathise with the Prime Minister’s desire not to have the Majlis chosen to a considerable extent by the Soviet Government. 5. It will probably be difficult to satisfy the legitimate demand for refprms without the danger of anarchy, which would increase the difficulty of our position and interrupt or reduce supply, if Soviet Government will [grp. omtd, ?not] restrain their people in Persia from trying to bring about violent change. Temptation to exploit conditions ideal for communist propaganda must be great but I hope that it will be resisted.S s 70/3^ V jncia mew (This Document is the Property of His Br ent, and should be kept 190 under Lock and Key.] [CODE R] GENERAL DISTRIBUTION 5894 From: PERSIA FROM TEHRAN TO FOREIGN OFFICE* Sir R* Bullard No, 789 D. 11,45 p,m, 19th September,1941, R. 8,50 a.m, 21st September,1941, I9th September, 1941• Repeated to India, Cairo, Angora, Moscow and Bagdad Saving. kkkkk My telegram N o, 781, Press to-day publishes text of an Imperial Decree authorising a general amnesty.

His Majesty's Government's acceptance of the Crown Prince's accession [3 grps. undec.] conditionally was a great relief to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Soviet Ambassador has had no instructions about the attitude of his Government but seems to think (rather contemptuously) that it will be all right. 2. General impression of observers was that the new Shah received genuine applause on his way to take the oath yesterdsy as opposed to the conventional applause used to greet his father, but this may have been due merely to relief at father's abdication.

This was doubtless to enable him to make, with greater authority ? a declaration regarding the crown jewels of which following is substance. As was well known crown jewels had been divided years ago into those of historical interest which were set aside as property of the Crown and those of less value, which, in accordance with the law, were ear-marked as cover for note issue. Historical jewels were as always inGulestaa Palace until quite recently when, owing to building operations, they were removed to the National Bank [? grp. omitted: ? for] greater safety.

Lists of all jewels had been drawn up when division had been made and arrangements for [grp. undec.] investigation of inventory checking.

After some references to tlx ex-Shah's financial interests etc*, Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated that he did not expect the Crown Prince would remain on the throne for much more than a month. He would probably give way to some member of the old Imperial family and, in this connexion, Minister for Foreign Affairs added that a possible candidate for the throne was actually with the British forces in Persia. Minister for Foreign Affairs concluded by advising his audience to pay no attention to the many rumours about alleged misbehavious of British and Russian troops.

It appears from the latter that Crown Prince was.not involved in anti-British-press publica tion and that Prime Minister forecasts system under which new Shah will be constitutional monarch with little real power. I note also that Soviet Ambassador thinks Crown Prince best candidate in present circumstances. 2. If the reform programme can be carried out and if the Crown Prince behaves well, we should, in view of the finding any other solution, be quite prepared to consider a settlement on the lines you suggest, i.e, extensive reforms, restoration to the nation of property illegally acquired by Reza Shah and departure of Reza Shah and all his sons, except the Crown Prince, from Persia.. - aave no illusions about the •character of the Crown Prince, and the position is that we are prepared to give him a trial, but subject to good behaviour.&lt;j-iV ihIo^ ■ 2\S- l/*' ( ^ - 18th September 1941. Bullard’s 767 about the convenience of carrying on with the Crown Prince is probably right, and if he does at all well there may be no reason for changing him# But Bullard seems to be pretty mudaied about who prince Hassan is when he describes him as ignorant of Persia and having an English education. He is evidently mixing him up with his son Hamid, whom I don’t imagine we would dream of putting forward directly, prince Hassan, after all, was not only brought up in Persia, but acted as ttegent for some years.

I realise that the most important thing is to ensure that the new Shah whoever he is will not oppose our interests. There are several reasons why we might expect the correct attitude from Crown Prince (a) warning from the fate of his father {p) constitutional procedure which will not allow J re ^ 0111 to.intrigue (c) youth and inexperience which places him under the influence of the Cabinet, ihe Prime Minister v/ho is one of the very few men who commands general respect and confidence states that working with the new Shah all yesterday and this morning he gained best impression of his abilities and good-will. It must be remembered that hitherto he has been under the influence of a masterful father. ^ 3 * . Great advantage of accepting the choice of the Crown Prince is that it is sanctioned by the Constitution. Once we insist on some other choice v/e become positively insteadof merely negatively responsible. We shall then become involved in a mass of conflicting interests and intrigues when there are most urgent things to be done such as seeing that Tehran does not starve. Already we are besieged by crowds of people grinding every kind of axe and ijp the Constitutional question is re - opened the noise will be deafening. 4» If the two give the Crown Prince rid of him quickly if that choice of a Shah had better be left to them meet in some out by themselves.

I left the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs in consternation after telling them about ^our telegram under reference. 7. I have throughout encouraged Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs to act on their own responsibility and not to expect His Majesty’s Government to make and run their Government and they acted accordingly. But for threatened Soviet-British occupation yesterday Government could have postponed the issue of a proclamation about the Shah’s abdication until we could learn whether.Great BritMn and U.S*S*R. approved but situation was very disturbed and delay would have.been dangerous, Soviet Ambassador and I told Prime Minister that v/e realised that proclamation could not be delayed but v/e did not f? commit] our Governments and I added that after all Crown Prince could also abdicate if necessary; but I hope it will not come to that just at present. 8.

You should inform the Persian Government that as they have undertaken to huand over these Germans for internment it is their duty to make the Japanese Minister disgorge them. 2. Meanwhile secret reports from Kabul of the enormous increase in the number of telegrams passing between the Japanese Legations at Kabul and Tehran show that the Germans in Tehran are using the Japanese Legation as a means of communication with their compatriots now that cypher facilities have been withdrawn. 3. You should inform the Persian Government that we must therefore insist on the withdrawal of bag .and cypher facilities from the Japanese Legation, though there is no objection to the Minister sending and receiving cn clair telegrams.

By that he meant that he could announce; (a) that he came to restore the constitution; (b) that the Allies guaranteed the integrity and independence of Persia; (c) that Persia*s relationship with the Allies was that of definite alliance. He said he would like to put tills in writing for me to pass on to you. Meanwhile this is just to let you know his ideas. They are ail right from our point of view. In any case I feel that none of neza's offspring can be counted on for anything but latent hostility for us and fro$ those elements in Persia who hate the father.

My telegram No.754 (see also telegram from General Officer Commanding Iraq September 15th to Chief of General Staff India repeated to War Office). Military Attache was called to the Ministry of liar where all the Generals were assembled to give him a message from the new Shah. The Shah says that he is prepared to co-operate with us to any extent (this also means I fear that he^expects us to act as a buffer against the Russians) if we will explain what we want. He asKs however whether we want the Persians to run the country or for it to be run by the Russians and ourselves because if the former what prestige can any Persian Government have with two foreign armies camped outside. 2. To reply that no Persian Government could have any prestige which was unable to arrest a few hundred Germans is no complete answer. We want to secure with the minimum expenditure in men and money certain objects especially the despatch of large quantities of goods and war material to Russia in transit and I fear that if the capital is occupied we i shall find ourselves being dragged into administering Tehran and therebv governing and policing the whole country. I am av/are that the Soviet Commanders have orders not to interfere with civil administration but they interfere by disarming the police, with food supplies by requestioning transport and so on and besides at mere contact with the Russians the administration tends to disintegrate. I know that my Soviet colleague has similar views but as he runs greater risks than I if he submits unpalatable views to his Government he may keep them to himself. If we could say that the troops will remain outside Tehran or that even if they occupy Tehran they will be withdrawn to Kasvin and Kermanshah when foreign legations and colonies have been removed it would put heart into the Government v/ho have had great difficulties to contend with and with this severe lesson might serve us well.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be kept under Lock and Key.] tv [This telegram is ^f partieular secrecy and should be /V/5V retained by the and not passed onj.^f^ (E^; /^326/3i*.)

Scv+Jtt i /(, Representative, while still convinced that whoever wrote the article was sure of Shah's approval, deprives Crown Prince of complicity. Minister for Foreign Affairs says that he is sure that Crown Prince had no previous knowledge of the article. Both believe that if approval of His Majesty*s Government and Soviet Government was assured, change from Shah to Crown Prince could be effected at once and without causing disturbance which selection of any other successor would cause. Soviet Ambassador telegraphed to Moscow saying that while he held to the poor opinion he had expressed about Crown Prince as an individual, he thought that recognition of Crown Prince as Shah was the solution which best suited the needs of the moment. Although my information about the article was from a source well informed and usually completely reliable, I am compelled to accept evidence to the contrary and to say that I see no better candidate for the throne in the present circumstances.- 2. New Shah v^ould be constitutional monarch with little or no power in Government and his accession would be accompanied by reforms. If you approve I should suggest to Prime Minister that accession should be accompanied by a proclamation in which the new Shah made over Royal Estates and Palaces to the nation and stated that he would be content for Majlis to fix civil list suitable for him and his family. It should, I think, be insisted that Shah should leave the country and take all other sons with him. &gt; Decision doubly urgent if Russian and British troops are to enter Tehran.

My telegram No. 735 and Your telegram No. 682. At the request of the Prime Minister I saw him and the Minister for Foreign Affairs together, to receive the message from the Shah asking what the London broadcasts in Persian meant and whether they could not be stopped. After some unreal talk I promised to convey the message to you with the comment that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs could not say that the broadcasts were unfriendly, or that they were displeasing to the people of Persia. Afterwards I was given to understand by each of‘them separately that they had been merely acting as mouth-pieces. 2. Minister for Foreign Affairs considers that the Shah can be persuaded to abdicate, only before Persians take any action thev wish to be sure that it will not be contrary to the wishes of His Majesty’s Government I said that if they considered that the Shah ought to go, His Majesty s Government would not interfere to prevent it. I did my best to make him believe that it is for Persians to initiate a policy, but it is true that they need to know beforehand that they are not embarking on one unwelcome to us, or to the Russians. The view of the Minister for Foreign Affairs seemed to be that the Crown Prince was the best candidate as the constitutional successor, but he f ets little praise from the public, he has become obnoxious to is Majesty’s Government (your telegram No. 688), and the Soviet Ambassador has reported very unfavourably on him. I am to see Minister for Foreign Affairs again to-day and will see what he considers possible second choice. Speedy action is necessary as the country is in a mess and the Snah is doing nothing to improve things. 3. Soviet Ambassador and I are fully agreed that the main.thing is to keep Persia quiet and increase the flow of goods to Russia ana he shows no desire to set up extremist Government, 4. * Deputies are to visit the Shah to-morrow about reforms. He may offer to abdicate, in which case the deputies are quite capable of begging him not to leave them orphans, though the London broadcasts or the last few evenings have given heart to the public in general. Deputies are the Shah’s nominees and therefore unheroic.vdth retention of his throne by present Shah. 5. You should convey the substance of the above to the Secretary of State and assure him that the action nronosed in no way runs counter to tne statements already made by His Majesty’s Government and the Soviet Government regarding their intention to respect the integrity and independence of Persia. The military measures which Persian meakness before German pressure has compelled us to take will not outlast the present emergency, and we wish to emphasize once again our firm intension to respect the assurances which v/e have given. 6.
