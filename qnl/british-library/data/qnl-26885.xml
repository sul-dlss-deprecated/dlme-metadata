I also enclose a cop; of a letter No.T-18, dated the 27th November 1937 addressee by me to the Sultan at his request before he signed the Prolongation - vide paragraph 2 of the Note (copy of whicn I was inforaed was to be forwarded to you) of the discussions held at Delhi on the 17th November 1937, between Sir Aubrey Met calfe, Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, and His Iligiiness at which I was present. The Sultan, in contradiction to what he had agreed to at Delhi, asked that the question of the Municipal Taxation should be dealt with in a separate letter and not referred to in xh the one he required from me in which he mentioned the stipulations under which he would prolong the Treaty. I have not yet received a reply from the Sultan to this letter. 3. It will be observed tiiat the document prolonging the Treaty makes no mention of the conditions referred to in my letter to the Sultan quoted above. The document has been prepared by me before the Sultan maaemade his stipulations in the hope of • hfeirip; able to -r ’ r .'

It would appear that the letter from me insisted on by the Sultan and his reply in confirmation which will no doubt eventually be received — are, from the Sultan’s point of view, really unnecessary since (a) the existing Treaty has been prolonged for one year only as usual, (b) if the new Treaty under negotiation is concluded and ratified before the expiry of the prolongation of the existing Treaty the latter will be automatically abrogated by the or^eamblc of the former. If this presumption is correct I trust there is no objection to the Sultan having signed the or elongation of the 1891 Treaty in the usual fora.V‘| (S' f ' Telegram:- (G.T.C.). From - 7/atts, Bombay.

Action suggested in case of France appears to offer good prospect of success and, if, as seems probable, Sultan now evinces same desire as previously to free himself from tariff restrictions/restrictions, should supply us with useful aid in concluding our own new Treaty with him. (ii) Success with France may incline United States of America to follow suit, and perhaps to waive insistence on most favoured nation rights in other matters (see United States of America draft treaty of 1930). We may expect Sultan in any case to maintain his resistance to grant of suph rights (paragraph 5 of Sir H.Biscoe's letter of the 7th April 1932). (iii) Path will then be clear to grant of tariff autonomy to Muscat. N.B.Holland under Declaration of 1877 retains no right to specified rate of tariff once Sultan is free of obligations under this head to other countries. 3. Above observations must be read as subject to qualification in the light of present tendencies of Sultan as these may be revealed in present Treaty negotiations. But having in mind Sultan's projected tour which will take him to United States of America and France (where he may be tempted to open negotiations himself), there would be advantage in referring at an early stage of the present Treaty discussions to the implications of treaties between Muscat and other Powers, and in indicating a method whereby His Majesty's Government could assist Sultan to obtain his desiderata, vis-a-vis these powers.

We have, however agreed somewhat reluctantly with the French proposal that these negotiations should take place in Paris instead of in India# The French Government are keen on *a decision of principle T , and the compromise which we have suggested, namely, the cession of jurisdiction in return for the recognition of French sovereignty, is not likely to be attained® It would therefore be of some advantage if, as a quid projquo for the abrogation of the provision in the Commercial Treaty of 1856 which limits the rates of customs duties to be levied in Morocco to 10 % , we could /4 . / 2 could demand the cession of French jurisdiction in the Loges. On the other hand, the French (rovernment might argue that to raise this question in connection with the proposed commercial negotiations regarding Morocco, is to betray a premature lack of confidence in the success of the impending negotiations regarding the Loges. Moreover it must be admitted that the cession of jurisdiction in the French Loges is not a very appropriate set-off against the abrogation of the limits on the French right to levy customs duties in Morocco. In any case the French Grovemment seem likely to adhere to their contention, which seems plausible, that article 7 of the Commercial Treaty of 1856 is of a capitul^ory nature and therefore must go, without any quid pro quo ^ with the rest of the capitulatory rights which have been abolished. For these reasons we consider that nothing will be gained by introducing questions connected with French possessions in India into the proposed coraaercial negotiations. 3. As regards the proposal that the French rights under their Treaty of 1844 with the Sultan of Muscat should be linked with the question of British capitulatory and eonmercial rights in Morocco it would seem technically that we have no locus standi to negotiate with French Government on behalf of Muscat which is an independent State. We appear however to have been doing so in the past, vide India Office memorandum No.PZ.195 3/ 36, dated the 20th March 1936, and letter No*PZ .3548/36, dated the 30th May 1936 and perhaps therefore no objection be raised on this score.3 4* One point however requires consideration. The existence of the article in the Treaty of 1844 limiting the rates of customs duties which the Sultan of Muscat can impose on French goods makes it virtually impossible for him to demand the rigjit of applying rates in excess of the same limit to British goods. If the article concerned in the French Treaty is abrogated before the new commercial treaty which we are about to negotiate with Muscat is signed it seems likely that we shall be compelled to agree to the Sultan imposing such customs duties as he pleases within reasonable limits on our goods. For this reason also we deprecate the proposal to link the question of French rights in Muscat with that of British rights in Morocco. 5. Our observations in paragraph 3 and 4 are subject to any comments the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf may wish to make. The issue of the above has been authorised. Sd/-.W.R. Hay.

Re our conversation. Mr. Caroe’s telegrams Nos.T-234, T-236 and T-237 of 27th September. Revision of Muscat Treaty . The Sultan is being tiresome. Prom what I know of him, I think what he has at the back of his mind is that we want to induce him to lay his cards on the table by appointing a negotiator, which does not commit us in itself to a revision of the Treaty, and then if we do not like the look of his cards we intend to hold up the revision of the Treaty by ■t refusing to appoint a Plenipotentiary. It is true that by our doing this the Sultan knows that the Treaty would automatically lapse if he insisted on its doing so by not renewing it. But I think he would hesitate to take this extreme step, which he knows would annoy H.M.G. considerably. 2. I agree with Mr. Garoe (para.l of his telegram T-236) that Major Watts* proposal cannot be brought within the scope of Article 23 of the present Treaty. 3. On the other hand, if I am correct in my diagnosis of the somewhat tortuous movings of the Sultan’s mind, the suggestion in Mr. Caroe’s telegram No.T-237 would, I am afraid, confirm the Sultan in his suspicions. I suggest, therefore, that the Sultan might be informed as follows (a) H.M.G. have appointed Mr. Garoe as Plenipoteniary; but (b) that if the Treaty is not revised by the 4th November (which of course it won’t be), H.M.G. intend to appoint me; (c) that in the meantime Major Watts will continue preliminary negotiations with the Suitan.J It could be explained to the Sultan verbally by Major Watts „that this procedure follows international practice by which max# Plenipotentiaries actually meet and preliminary A investigations/2 investigations are carried out by negotiators. 4. With regard to (a). This will ease the Sultan’s mind and induce him, I hope, to put forward his proposals immediately. With regard to (b). This, strictly speaking, has nothing to do with the Sultan, but the point will undoubtedly occur to him. With regard to (c). Here again no explanation is really due to the Sultan, but I have found from practical experience that he likes (as do all the Rulers of small States) to think that he is being treated on a par with other Powers. 5. The above proposals go a considerable way to meet the Sultan, who, as I have remarked above, is being tiresome. We have, however# to remember, first, that he is apparently within his technical rights under Article 23 of the present Treaty in asking for a Plenipotentiary. Second, that since the present Treaty is in our favour and not his and expires automatically in February next if not renewed (unless we can induce the Sultan to agree to an extension) and time is short, our position is by no means too strong. 6* An alternative to the proposals in para.3 (a) and (b) above would be for the Sultan to be informed that as we see no prospect of the Treaty being revised by November 4th, I a was being appointed Plenipoteniary from that date. fl/w C Proposal (c) mhbA as it is. The advantage of this would be that only one Plenipoteniary would have to be appointed instead of two: I don’t know how much trouble is have to have His Majesty’s signature. The disadvantage wDuld be that the Sultan might reply that he would hold matters up till I came out. We might discuss this alternative with Mr. Walton as well as the rest of this Note. involved in appointing a Plenipoteniary, e.g. whether papers m/?gch/vh i'. /. 6422 .

My dear Brenan, In connection with the question of the Revision of the Muscat Treaty of 1891 (your reference E.5013/689/91) we have Been looking into the 1905 papers and find that a revised draft of the Treaty, incorporating the desiderata of H.M.G. , was drawn up in consultation with the Foreign Office, Board of Trade and Colonial Office. The revised draft in its final form was sent to the Foreign Office on August 9th 1905, and approved in a letter dated the 26th October, 1905, from Sir E. Gorst, The correspondence was sent to the Board of Trade on the 29th November 1905. The draft contained alterations to Articles 2,4, 6 , 8 , 9, 10, 12, 13, 14,/19, 21 and 22. Many of these alterations appear to have been comparatively unimportant, and some (such as the revised Article 21) are clearly out of date. The more important alterations seem to have been:- Article 2, 'national' instead of most favoured nation treatment. Article 4, Muscat coasting trade to remain 16 open to British vessels. Article 6 , a clearer definition of British goods 59 '3 5000 3.37 Article 9/5973 )raft ] 2 . (3 Article^ approval by British Consu of the judge selected for ^ ^ disputes between Muscati and British subjects. Article 19, 'national” treatment in respect QX i of taxes if paid, ‘ Article 21, Dominions and Colonies u&gt;dl Accession Clause. It may not be worth considering in detail whether any of the 1905 amendments 1 ' s should be put forward until we have the , Sultan’s own suggestions for amendments - which,we understand, are likely to affect a great number of the Articles. But we might give the matter some preliminary examination. f Our feeling here, I think, would be against putting forward any amendments that are not essential-except in so far as it may be tactically desirable to use them as bargaining counters, since we are anxious to get the revised treaty concluded as soon as possible. Moreover, the present treaty seems to have done us quite well during the 30 years and more since the 1905 draft was put forward. We should accordingly be glad to know whether you attach importance to any of the amendments suggested in 1905 , 8 o far as the Foreign Office is concerned, and if so, to which.

I have, etc., (SIGNED) MALCOLM MAC DONALD,/ Hits W- I ^ 0 ' ^ iO Fr. Claason . Many thanks. Let us look up the 1905 draft. As regards the subsidy, I see that in approving its discontinuance in our telegram of 24th January, 1936, we stated that this was subject to general re-examination of the Muscat financial situation m about two years’ time (P.Z. 38/36). as regards the suggestion in the earlier Bushire telegram about a formal guarantee of protection, note the Anglo-French declaration of 1862 (No. X in Aitchison); prirna facie this would seem to make it very difficult to enter into an agreement to protect the Sultan (at any rate without squaring the French first); perhaps you could ask the F.O. to consider this point in connection with our letter of 1st September.

Before my arrival at Muscat on my recent tour the Sultan addressed a letter to the Political Agent, Muscat, copy and trans lation of which I enclose, informing him that he wished the above Treaty to be revised. This revision is provided for in Article 23 of the Treaty. In conversation with me His Highness reiterated his request. I replied thc*t I would inform His Majesty’s Govern ment, and a copy of a letter sent by Major iffatts to the sultan under my instructions is enclosed* 2. This means that the revised Treaty will have to be put into force by the 11th February 1938. 3. I suggest that I be authorised to reply to the Sultaa thatHis Ii5Sl j esty 1 s Government would be glad to have his proposals for the revision in order that they may consider them before negotiations for the revision actually begin. (Aitchison Vol.XI, page 310) confers most-favoured-nation rights on British and British protected subjects. It is true that if the Treaty should lapse this Article would of course be equally nullified with the rest of the Treaty but in view of our special position in Muscat it can scarcely be contempat ed that any fresh Treaty will not confer similar rights. If therefore the Sultan’s proposals for the new Treaty involve terms less favourable than those enjoyed by the citizens of the United States of America under the Treaty of 1833 (Ibid. APP*XXVIl), or subjects of Prance under the Treaty of 1844 (Ibid.APP*XXIX), or subjects of the Netherlands under the Treaty of 1877 (Ibid. AppoXXXIX), then it will be necessary to ask the Sultan to revise these Treaties as well. 4 It may be noted that Article 2 of the present Treaty sd.

As this involves a demand which is unacceptable for the accord of nice t-favoured-nation” treatment to United States nationals as well as to United States goods, the Secretary of State, after consultation with the Government of India, now proposes, subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs, to abandon attempts to secure a modification of the Muscat Treaties with i?rance and the United States of America. But as the financial position i i the &amp;uscut St te is still acute Sir Samuel Hoare is anxious to persevere with the proposal to modify the Treaty of 2 ^-uscat with this countiy of 1891 so as to allow an increase in the maximum tariff rates leviable from 5 $&gt; to 10 ^&gt; (ZSfc in the case of alcoholic liquors and tobacco).

It will be recalled that, in order to overcome the difficulty caused by the lack of any provision,in the Treaty for the separate withdrawal of the Dominions to which it had been applied, it has been the practice, at the request of His Majesty’s Governments in Canada and the Irish Free State, to insert a special clause in the THE UNDER SECRETARY. OF STAT INDIA OFFICE. , ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY LETTER No. £2 14JAN. 1932 FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICE J annual ifannual renewals of the Treaty giving those Dominions the - ight to withdraw from the Treaty at any time upon notice to that effect being given by His Majesty’s Representative at Muscat* This clause in its original form extended also to the Commonwealth of Australia, and His Majesty’s Grovernment in the Commonwealth took advantage of the clause to withdraw from the Treaty in 1923. 3. It is understood to be the intention of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom that, pending the completion of negotiations for the revision of the Treaty, arrangements should be made as usual for the renewal of the Treaty in its existing form on its expiration in February next. On this basis the correct procedure for securing the withdrawal of the Union of South Africa from the Treaty would seem to be (1} that arrangements should be made for the addition of the Union of South Africa to the Dominions mentioned in the special clause referred to abo-e (viz* Canada and the Irish Free State) when the renewal of the Treaty is effected in February next; ( 2 ) that, following on this extension of the special clause, notice should he given to the Muscat authorities, as soon as may be convenient after the renewal of the Treaty has been effected, of the wi thdrewalBESBBflnBB&amp;fl&amp;iB f'i r It may be added that the Treaty does not aoply to the whole of the Union but only to the provinces of Natal, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. it would seem desirable, therefore, that to any provision for the withdrawal of the Union should be added the qualification 'in respect of Natal, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State '* The s P ecia; *- clause would then run as follows:- 'It is also understood that it shall be open to the Dominion of Canada, the Union of South Africa (in respect of Natal, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State) co.d the Irish iree State to withdraw from the aforesaid Treaty at any time on notice being given to that effect by His Majesty's Representative at Muscat.' A similar (qualification should also be made in the subsequent communication to the Muscat authorities giving notice of the withdrawal of the Union of South Africa from the Treaty. 5. Mr. Thomas would be glad if Sir Samuel Hoare could arrange for action to be taken in accordance with the procedure suggested above and if a copy of any communication despatched from the India Office for this purpose could be forwarded to this Office in order thatHis Majesty’s Government in the Union of South Africa -iay be informed of the action contemplated. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Office. I am, Sir, Your most obedient servant,I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Confidential Despatch No.269 of the 5th of September last, in regard to the proposed revision of the Commercial Treaty between Great Britain and Liuskat. His Majesty's Government in the Union of South Africa is of opinion that the Treaty in question is of little or no interest to the Union and has, therefore, decided that the Union shall no longer remain a party to it. There is, therefore, no intention on the part of the Union to renew the / Treaty after its expiration in February, 1932. s It may also be stated that the provisions of Article 4 are contrary to the Asiatic policy of the Union.

The bulk of the papers consists of correspondence connected to the annual renewal of the treaty for the years 1931-38 and the forwarding of copies of the renewal agreement to various offices of the British Government.The volume also covers the insertion of a clause in the agreement to allow for the Union of South Africa, a British Dominion, to withdraw from the treaty.From April 1937 much of the correspondence concerns the Sultan's wish to revise the 1891 treaty and the subsequent negotiations. No conclusion of these negotiations is covered by the volume.The main correspondents are the Political Agent, Muscat, Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, Government of India (Foreign Department), India Office, and Foreign Office. Further correspondence is from the Dominions Office, Colonial Office, and the Sultan of Muscat, Said bin Taimur [Sa‘īd ibn Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Dominions Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0001f0#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
