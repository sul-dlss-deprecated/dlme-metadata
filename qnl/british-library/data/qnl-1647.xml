' ^ 48 DEC The raising of the status of the French Legation in Tehran to that of I&amp;nbassy, which I had the honour to report in my despatch No. 365 of November 1st provides a good occasion to examine the question of French influence in Persia. 2. As you are aware, it could be said, until the beginning of the 1939 war, that French cultural influence in Persia was supreme. This influence, as in Turkey and Sgypt, went back a very long way, and tradition, and the pressure of vested interests, helped to keep it in being. The American and English schools must have had more pupils than the French schools, but the number of Persians who went to France to complete their education far exceeded the number who went to Great Britain or America, in spite of the fact that in the execution of the terms of its concession the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company sent a number of students to the United Kingdom every year to study engineering or medicine. During the last years of the reign of Reza Shah more and more students were going to Germany to study. Politics may have played a part in this, but the main factor was financial: under the clearing arrangement students could be supported and educated without the purchase of foreign exchange. In spite, however, of the drift towards Germany, the figures for 1936 a year for which we happen to have statistics - show French culture as still far ahead: Kuinbers of Persian students . France 537 Belgium 114 Switzerland 31 Beirut 163 Germany 137 0 . s. A. 70 U.K. (1) A.I.O.C.... .... 36 (2) Others •.., TOTAL 1121 Since students in Belgium and Switzerland would usually be -in French- speaking colleges, and since probably half the students at Beirut were at the French college (the other half at the American), we may fairly reckon that about 7o0 students, i.e. over two-thirds of the total number pursuing their education abroad, were being brought up under the influence of French culture. At the present moment the newly formed Society of Graduates of British Universities has about 75 Persian members and it is believed that this number includes nearly all those who are qualified to belong to the Society; but there are in Tehran many hundreds of doctors, lawyers, engineers and others with a French educational background. The University of Tehran (the only university in the country) is almost entirely French in atmosphere, and I understand that one would hardly realise from the textbooks in the medical school, which are all in French, that modern medicine owed anything to any country but France. Another centre of French influence was the Persian army. Many Persian officers went to France, usually to St. Cyr, to complete their military education, and for years before 1939 there was a French military mission attached to the Persian army - and so firmly attached that it remained at The Right Honourable Ernest Bevin, M.P., His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, LONDON S. W. 1. 1 lotcm*' 1 IN p IA uFRCfc !mm-2** ^ epite of the breach of relatione with France which was 'J j seci Reza Shah»s annoyance at the flippancy of the French press. 3. As a result of the war France has lost some of her cultural assets. The French military mission left when the war vegan, airi the military record of France during the war, and her inabilils to supply any war material for a long time to come, will probably prevent the restmption of French influence in the Persian amny. Then the French language has had a set-back in comparison with English. The presence of British and American troops in Persia seems to have hastened the recognition by the Persians of the fact that English and not French is to be the world lar^guage, and the establishment of the British Council in Persia, with Anglo-Persian institutes in Tehran and two other towns, has provided facilities for the acquisition of English which thousands of students have been quick to seize. Nevertheless, French education still retains some advantages. Most of the French-trained professional men are partisans of the French language and the French system of education, and that between Ijo and 200 of them have French wives doubtless tends to accentuate thifa incxination. The only two foreigners employed in teaching in Persia are both Frenchmen: Monsieur Godard, who is Director of Archaeology, and Monsieur Oberling, Director of the Faculty of Medicine in Tehran University. Both are excellent men, and neither would I think engage in disloyal competition against us; but it is not to be expected that their mere presence should not favour French culture. Then there is the eternal attraction of France for the lighter side of the Persian character. The Persian finds too a wanner welcome at French universities than at any college or university in England: not only do the French cater for foreign students, but they let than off lightly in examinations, especially since laws were passed providing that a French degree in e.g. law or medicine should not entitle the holder to practice in France. One reason for the preference for France may perhaps be found in a remark made to me by Monsieur Harriot when he stayed in Tehran on his way home from his German prison. Monsieur Harriot told me that he had been invited to speak to the Majlis and was wondering what to say, aid he added: H 0n me dit que les Iranians aiment qu*on les flatte. Eh bien, les Framjais savent faire ca. The addresses which he subsequently gave to the Majlis And elsewhere established the truth of this statement. 4. The French in Tehran are fully conscious of the asset they have in hand, and are determined to keep it and if possible add to it. Even the de Gaulle Governaent in exile managed to grant scholarships to a considerable number of French youths to enable them to take courses at the French college in Beirut. They are now launching out into propaganda on an expensive scale. In addition to the Press Attache at the French Qnbassy, there is in Tehran a representative of the Agence Fran^aise Presse, Monsieur Jekiel. There seems to be no limit to the funds at Monsieur Jekiel* s command. 1 understand that he has a salary of £150 p.m. and £100 p.m. for esqoenses. He has a large office with a uniformed messenger and men on bicycles to take to the telegraph office the lengthy telegrams which he sends /notIK* MMII &gt;ii«i rfttii 1 * ■■■■I nc ^ only about* important, affairs but also about matters that one would hardly think worth a letter. The Press Attach! distributes a French newsreel to the local cinemas every week without charge; Monsieur Jekiel supplies the Agence Fran^aise Presse service to the Pars Agency free of charge - a present which makes the Pars Agency, which also receives all Tass material free, ask why they should pay £§00 a year for Reuter telegrams. The Press Attache proposes to establish a French newspaper. His Ambassador is against this, but the Press Attach! is not under his orders and seems likety to inaugurate his project in December. To compete with a French propaganda organisation provided with enormous funds will not be easy, especially if Reuter’s Agency continues to be as niggardly about representation in Persia as it is at present, and the English press continues to pay as little regard to Persian 5 . The French language is losing steadily to English. A significant pointer is the fact that cinema proprietors who used to buy the synchronised French versions of British and American films now buy the original versions with English sound-track and add French (and, it must be admitted, Russian) captions here. Nevertheless, the French language, and French culture, have merely been occulted by the war, ard the French Goverrment seem to be determined to spare neither trouble nor money to restore to them the predominance they formerly enjoyed in this country. 6 .
