The back of the scarab is executed with average workmanship, but the bottom design is poorly made. \r\n\r\nThis scarab functioned as an individualized amulet, and was originally mounted or threaded. The amulet should ensure for its owner support by the royal authority of the divine king (Thutmosis III), as well as divine protection. \r\n\r\nThe scarab was produced after the death of Thutmosis III (1479-1425 BCE). The names and titles of Thutmosis III were used also in later periods; the Egyptians saw him as a protective god of kinship and his names and titles as powerful magical elements. The additional reading of his throne name as Amun increased the power of this amulet.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/24291", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acqusition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "19th-20th Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2009-09-11T09:35:05.56", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.68_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.68_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.68_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.68_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.68_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "CUR_42.68_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.68_Bot_DD_design_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.68_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.68_Rt_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.68_VwA_DD_hieroglyphictext_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.68_VwA_DD_TranscriptionRS2009.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
