Due to the War, the arrangements for the King’s Birthday celebrations at the Agency were cancelled between the years 1940 and 1944, and invitations were only sent to the Shaikh of Bahrain and his family. For the King’s Birthday, a notice was sent regularly by the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf announcing which day in June the birthday would occur that year. For Christmas, a memorandum was sent by the Political Agent in Bahrain with a sum of money to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. The memorandum instructed the Adviser to distribute sweets among the prisoners on Christmas Day. The following arrangements were made for each ceremony when it took place:refreshments including biscuits (Nice), coffee, sherbet, crystallised cherries, Mackintosh toffees and tin biscuits (unsweetened) were ordered mainly from Jashanmal &amp; Son;European and American community members as well as Bahrain Petroleum Company’s staff were invited;personal invitations were sent to Shaikh Hamad Bin ‘Isa al-Khalifa and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Bin ‘Isa al-Khalifa respectively;a guard was appointed to receive the Shaikhs and their family members at the Agency;the speech of the appointed Political Agent was read on the occasion, focusing mainly on malaria and education in Bahrain as well as affairs concerning the Second World War (1939-45).Lists of invitees from among Manamah and Muharraq notables, and Indian invitees, and records of absentees were drawn up. After each ceremony a report was written summarising the event. The correspondence is mainly between Political Agents Hugh Weightman, Major Reginald George Evelyn William Alban and Tom Hickinbotham, the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, and Shaikh Hamad Bin ‘Isa al-Khalifa and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Bin ‘Isa al-Khalifa.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Bahrain Ḥamad bin 'Īsá Āl Khalīfah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Bahrain Salmān bin Ḥamad Āl Khalīfah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Birthdays</topic></subject><subject><topic>Christmas</topic></subject><subject><topic>Monarchs</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00018f#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00018f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00018f#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00018f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
