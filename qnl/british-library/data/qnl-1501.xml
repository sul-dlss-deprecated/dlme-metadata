Recent articles in British Press regarding Bahrain Oil are occasion of renewal prese campaign. One article states that 'Persia will prove her rights Before International Courts of Justice'. It is not unlike the press announcements of the impending cancell- -ation of the A.P.O.C. concession. Moreover I have simultaneously received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs answer to letter referred to in my telegram No. 56. He makes it plain that there is no present intention of renewing treaty negotiations. In these circumstances and in view of the fact that Bahrain nay pio v , he a gold mine it seems to me possible that the above quoted statement must be taken seriously, in whicn case a decision on our general attitude is urgent.

In connection with the Treaty it is true that I remarked in the course of our conversations that all the disputed questions could be settled by a general treaty but at the same time I am confident that Tour Excellency will agree that as long as the conclusion of treaties and agreements are not based on equality and the balance of interests of both parties and observance of real reciprocity between the contracting parties, and the exigencies of the time they will not have a firm and unshakable basis. \t any time that I feel that the foundation and basis of the matter will be such aHraen* •tioned above I shall be most willingly prepared to enter into negotiations on the matter.

Soon afterwards tribal forces occupied empty military barracks and negotiations then commenced for surrender of Government forces. The latter so far refuse to surrender unless ordered to do so by Persian Government with whom communication is being attempted through Persian wireless station at Bushire. Negotiations still continue. The tribes are in full control of Bushire with exception of gendarmerie barracks. Conditions are almost normal and inhabitants can move freely. Understand no violence or looting has occurred except that house of Consulate Power House engineer was entered into by tribal party and small amount of cash and cutlery removed. It is believed this was done ? in error and out of personal enmity with previous engineer who married a tribal woman.

JMEDIATE Truce broke down on evening September 21st. at about 0900 p.m. when Government forces from Gendarmerie barracks opened fire on nearby house of Consulate doctor shortly after his return there in his car which is well known to everyone. Firing continued throughout the night and was returned by tribal forces after 11 p.m. when they occupied roofs of houses nearby including that of Consulate doctor and Consulate house recently vacated by Consul. Apart from a short pause during the day when Consulate doctor was extricated from his house unhurt firing has continued ever since• It is understood there are no casualties. Telephone communication with Officer Commanding Government forces is cut and apparently he is not making any attempt to obtain orders of Persian Government, and will not surrender until so ordered by his Government. There seems little chance of position changing until Government forces exhaust their stock of water. 3. Tribal forces are treating inhabitants well and there have been no cases of theft or violence. Government ammunition, sugar and merchandise in Customs warehouseswarehouses are being well guarded and apart from unsafe area around Gendarmerie barracks and observance Ox curfew life is almost normal* All Government offices except Governorate are functioning. 4.
