There is also correspondence from the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain (Charles Dalrymple Belgrave); HM Minister, Jedda [Jeddah] (Sir Andrew Ryan); and members of the ruling family of Bahrain. Enclosures to correspondence from the Political Resident to the Political Agent, Bahrain include correspondence from the Government of India, and the Foreign Office.The papers cover: minutes of meeting held at the Foreign Office on 8 October [1934] to discuss relations between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, November 1934; the possibility that Saudi Arabia might develop Ras Tanurah [Ra’s Tanūrah] as a port for direct steamer traffic; continuing references to the incident concerning the SS
