Intelligence Report for May. It is reported that Dr. Blegrad is proceeding to Denmark shortly at the end of his contract with the Iranian Government. He is reported to have expressed much satisfaction at the canning prospects on the Iranian side of the Gulf. His scheme is that two factories should he started, one at Bushire for fillets, and one at Bandar Abbas for delicacies such as anchovies, sardines, langousts etc. He thinks that the Bushire factory should he in operation before the Bandar Ahhas factory is started. However before much could he done the fishing industry would need re-organising and it is thought that the indigenous fishermen may cause difficulties. (P.R.

Reference paragraph No. 190 of diary for January, 1938. The fishing trawler 'Rashgu” visited Bushire and Kharg Island during the month. It is reported that Dr. H. Blegvad, the Danish marine 'biologist, is proceeding to Denmark shortly at the end of his contract with the Iranian Government. Mr. Blegvad is reported to have expressed much satisfaction at the canning prospects on the Iranian side of the Gulf. His scheme is that two factories should 'be started, one at Bushire for billets*, and one at Bandar Ahhas for delicacies such as anchovies, sardines, langouste etc. He thinks that the Bushire factory should be in operation before the Bandar Abbas factory is started. He stated that he thought that 6 tons of fish could be canned for £30,000 which is apparently a very profitable figure, and may well be since at Bandar Abbas 7 pounds of first class anchovies can be purchased for a rial. However, before much could be done the fishing industry would need re-organizing, and it is thought that the indigenous fisherman may cause difficulties.11. Fisheries Further to paragraph 3 of last month's Intelligence Report, Dr.Blegvad's party consisting of three Danish and two German Fishery experts arrived from the Gulf at Khorramshahr on 1st May and left for Europe via Tehran on the 3rd leaving their trawler 'Rashgu' in charge of the naval authorities. It is reported that their survey has been successful and about 50 samples of fish have been taken with them. They expect to return to Iran in about 4 months time. Dr.Blegvad himself left for Tehran via Bunder Abbas in mid April. It is reported that he has been offered a two year contract by the Iranian Government at £1200 per annum.

Blegvad’s fishing trawler, which has been named 'RASHGU' (after one of the best varieties of fish obtainable in the Iranian waters of the Persian Galf) returned from Bandar Abbas and down ports and left for Khorramshahr on 30th April. T&gt; r. Blegvad is said to have left direct for Denmark on six months recess. The crew of the 'RASHGU' will leave from Fhorramshahr for Denmark while the boat will remain in charge of the Iranian Naval authorities in Khorramshahr. According to a correspondent of the local V/eekly, the 'Khalij-i-Iran', the fishing prospects m the harbour of Henjam Island are excellent. The correspondent states that in rough weather all varieties of fish collect round the harbour. The same correspondent states that xiqai Bahadur, the Governor of Bandar abbas, accompanied by Aqai Koohbud, the Director of the Oxide line, and Aqai Per-Zadeh, an Inspector of the Revenue Department, Bandar Abbas, visited Penjam (at about the end of April) and gave the inhabitants assurances that the Iranian Government would provide all necessary means for bettering conditions on the Island.(P.2. 3615/37) Extract from Bashire Residency Diary for Parch 1937. 54.

The local weekly the 'Khalij-i-Iran' in its issue No. 13 dated the 25th Isfand 1313 (16th March 1937) reported that the Iranian Government have engaged Dr. Blegvad for two years service on the following terms That during the two years Dr. Blegvad is entitled to a pay of 200 pounds sterling a month for six months - the fishing season. That half of the amount should be paid to him at the rate of exchange current at the National Bank of Iran and one balance m sterling.

There were on hoard, besides Doctor Blegvad, two Danish Zoologists and one Botanist, the Captain of the trawler and two seamen and an Iranian interpreter. They came over largely to buy supplies, particularly ammonia for their refrigerating plant which could not be obtained in Iran. Doctor Blegvad stayed at the Agency, and his scientists came to dinner one evening and the Captain of the trawler to lunch. They all made themselves very pleasant and apparently enjoyed their spell of freedom. (ii) Doctor Blegvad told the Political Agent that he had stayed with the British Consul at Bandar Abbas, but had subsequently been informed by the Iranian Government that they would prefer that he should stay with the Governor. (iii) Some days before Doctor Blegvad’s visit, the Commandant of the Bahrain Police had dug out of the ground two ancient cannon and mounted them for ornament before the gate of the Police Fort. The M Rashgu M was wearing the Iranian flag and it was once stated that the Bahrain Government had had news of her coming and so had mounted the cannons to ward off attack and that the 'Rashgu' was only the precursor of an Iranian invasion. (iv) Doctor Blegvad said that several countries had offered to take up his fish enquiring work, but that the Iranian Minister concerned had decided on Denmark, because years ago he had seen the milk collecting system and had been deeply impressed by the honesty of a people who could leave cans of milk standing unguarded by the roadside./■■ ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ roadside. (v) Doctor Blegvad said that His Majesty the Shah had asked him whether it was possible to establish commercial fisheries in the Persian Gulf and that he had replied that it could be done if money was put into it.

(E 7681/12/34). My dear Clauson, With reference to India Office letter p.z. 8420/36 of the 27th November regarding the prospective visit of a Danish fishing expert to the Persian Gulf, I think you may be interested to see the following minute which has been written by Beckett:- 'I have looked at the Law Officers f opinion 'referred to by Lorimer x and a copy of it is available 'in my room if the Department wish to see it. As 'regards the legal question involved our view is 'that, although the sea itself outside the three 'mile limit is not capable of appropriation, the 'position is not the same with regard to the bed of 'the sea and that prescriptive rights may be 'obtained/ X Part I, Volume II, paragraphs 2247-2249. M.J. Clauson, Esq. ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY LETTER NO. -6 11 FEB 1937 «j orrr^srvA V Pf&gt;l IT1P.A1 AND X•'obtained to exploit the bed of the open sea for 'the purposes of pearl fisheries, etc. This view 'is best set out in an article by Sir Cecil Hurst 'in the British Year Book of International Law '1923-4, page 34. The same view is adopted by the 'editor of Oppenheim on pages 513 and 514 of volume 'I of the fourth edition. This view is not the 'original view of Professor Oppenheim himself and 'it may be noted that where the matter is referred 'to earlier on in the footnote on page 507 the 'editor has not so clearly rejected or corrected 'Professor Oppenheim’s view as he does on page 514.'Extract from an Article by Sir Cecil J.B.Hurst, 1C. C.B. ,K. C., published in the British Year Book of International Law 1923/24 and entitled - ' Whose is the bed of the Sea ? Seaentary Fisheries outside the three mile limit.' * * * * * * * * The question however remains, to what distance do these j.iopeit,y rights of the Sovereign in the bed of the sea extend? So far as the law of this country is concerned, the rights of the Crown were fixed long before the doctrine of the three-mile limit was tnought of, and yet it seems to be agreed that nowadays these property rights do not in general extend beyond the three- mile limit. plowden might argue in 1577 - 'that the interest of the Queen in the sea extends into the midst of the sea between England and Spain; but the Queen hath one whole jurisdiction of the sea between England and prance because she is ueen of England, Prance, etc. And so it is of Ireland.' To-day such claims would be excessive. Lord Hale's writings give no indication as to the distance to which he considered the property of the Crown in the bed of the sea to extend - 'The king hath the propriety as well as the jurisdiction of the narrow seas, for he is in a capacity of acquiring the nairow and adjacent sea bo his dominion by a kind of possession which is not compatible to a subject; and accordingly, regularly, the king hath that propriety in the sea; but a subject hath not, nor indeed cannot have that propriety in the sea, through a whole bract of ib that the king hath; because, without a regular power he cannot possibly possess it. But though a subject cannot acquire the interest of the narrow seas, yet hejnay by usage and prescription acquire an interest in so much of the sea as he may reasonably possess, viz., of a uxstrictus maris , a place in the sea between such points, or a particular part contiguous to the shore, or of a port, creek, or arm of the sea. These may be possessed by a subject, and pi escribed in pOi.nt 01 interest both of the water, and of the soil itself covered with the water, in such a precinct for these are maniorable (sic), ana may be entirely possessed by a subject.' The v/ide claims to jurisdiction over the narrow seas wnich this councry made in the past have ra^len into desuetude. There has been no formal renunciation of them and it is merely© 2 . by disuse that they have lapsed. If the rights of the Crown to the ownership of the bed of the sea are now more restricted than they were at the time at which Lord Hale was writing, it can only be that they also have been narrowed by disuse. The principle enunciated by Hall is that the true key to the development of the law is to be sought in the principle that maritime occupation must be effective in order to be valid. If it is disuse and disuse alone which has led to a restriction of the rights of the Sovereign in the bed of the sea, it follows that in cases where there has been effective occujjation of a portion of the bed of the sea within the meaning of the principle enunciated by Hall, and such occupation still continues, there has been no abandoning of the rights of ownership, and consequently the ownership still continues. Assuming that this proposition is sound, it removes a difficulty which has found expression in writings on international law as regards seaentary fisheries occurring outside the three-mile limit. Vattel's statement: 'Who can doubt that the pearl fisheries of Bahrein and Ceylon may lawfully become property?' ceases to cause any difficulty to even the stoutest upholders of the principle that the limits cf the territorial belt are not more than three miles if it is realised that the exclusive right to the pearls to be obtained from the banks flowed from the ownership of the bed of the sea 'where the banks were situated, and not from any claim to maritime jurisdiction over the waters. Wherever it can be shown that particular oyster beas, pearl banks, chank fisheries, sponge fisheries or whatever may be the particular form of sedentary fishery in question outside the three-mile limit have always been kept in occupation by the Sovereign of the adjacent land, ownership of the soil of the bed of the sea where the fishery was situated may be presumed, and the exclusive right to the produce to be obtained from these fisheries may be based on their being a produce of the soil. Ownership of the soil by/3 by the Sovereign of the country under such circumstances must carry with it the right to legislate for the soil so owned and for the protection of the wealth to be derived from it, and no doubt need be felt as to the binding force of the various enactments which have been issued for the protection of these sedentary fisheries outside the three-mile limit. The instances where ancient usage justifies a claim to sedentary fisheries outside the three-mile limit do not seem to be numerous, and of those wrich are known some appear to be situated in bays or gulfs which are claimed as part of the national territory by the State contiguous to whose shore they lie. For instance, the chank fisheries and the pearl fisheries in the Gull of Manaar have been the subject of regulation by local ordinances, etc., throughout tne nineteenth century. The pearl and chank fisheries in the Gulf of Manaar were claimed from early times by the successive Portuguese, Dutch and British masters of the neighbouring territory, and there can be little doubt but that a good title to the ownership of these beds can be made out, based on long-continued occupation. Both the Gulf of Manaar and Talk’s Bay, the two great bays which divide India from Ceylon and are separated from each other by the long stretch of islets known as Adam’s Bridge, would probably be claimed as part of the national territory, and not part of the high seas at all. Talk’s Bay at any rate has now been held by the Madras Courts to be an integral portion of the British Dominions, and if the question arose a similar decision might possibly be given as to the Gulf of Manaar. Even if it were not, however, the claim to the ownership of the pearl and chank beds in that gulf could be based on long usage and uncontested enjoyment; and the right to legislate with regard to these beds could be rested on the ground of their ownership. Another instance which can be cited, and one where there is no doubt that the site forms part of the high seas, is that of/of the oyster beds off the east coast of Ireland. By the Sea Fisheries Act of 1868 power was taken to issue an Order in Council enabling the Irish commissioners to regulate the dredging for oysters on any oyster beds within a distance of twenty miles seawards from a straight line between Lambay Island and Carnsore Point. Some of these banks were between ten and twenty miles beyond the three-mile limit. The above are instances where the State interested formed part of the British Empire. The same principle must of necessity apply also to sedentary fisheries on banks claimed by foreign Governments. The Bey of Tunis has, for instance, claimed the exclusive right to the sponges on a bank outside the three-mile limit off the coast of Tunis by the continuous and unquestioned enjoyment of the fructus of these banks. Such enjoyment would constitute a title to the bank which foreign States y/ould no doubt recognise and would oblige their nationals to recognise. Similarly, Mexico is said to have legislated for regulating pearl fisheries off the Mexican coast though outside the three-mile limit. The mainbenance of a Stage’s property rights in special areas outside the three-mile limit when more extensive general claims to sovereignty, jurisdiction and property were abandoned is in no way inconsistent with the principles laid down by Oppenheim, that the sub-soil beneath the bed of the open sea outside the marginal belt of territorial waters is a no man’s land, property in which can be acquired on the part of the littoral State through occupation starting from the sub-soil beneath the bed of the territorial maritime belt. Tunnelling in the sub-soil for purposes of mining or communications seems to be the only aspect of the problem which Oppenheim had in mind, out the principles he lays down are in no way inconsistent with the recognition of a right of exclusive ownership arising from long and undisputed occupation of sedentary fisheries lying5 on the surface of the bed of the sea. The international Convention for the Protection of Submarine Cables (Paris, March 14, 1884) does not run counter to this theory of the bed of the sea being a no man 1 s land in which property can be and is acquired by occupation. The effect of the convention is to place submarine cables unaer a hind of common protection, as all the parties to the convention accept the view that wilful injury to a caole outside territorial waters is an offence to be punished in the courts of the country of the vessel doing t-e damage. There is nothing exclusive in character about the occupation of the sea bed occasioned by the laying of a submarine cable. The mere fact that one cable is there already does not prevent another from being laid across it; hence there is no need for the application of the principle that sovereignty and property of the sea bed are acquired by the occupation which the first comer achieves by the laying of his cable. There is no call for the recognition of exclusive rights. All that is necessary for safeguarding the position of the cable owner and for the maintenance and encouragement of cable communications is some method of protection of the cable by the recognition of its right to be there and by ensuring the punishment of those who injure it. It is not so with a submarine tunnel or with a mine driven out into the sub-soil beneath the high seas. Unless the rights created by such operations were exclusive the works 'would be valueless, for at any moment they would stana the risk of aestruction through contact with similar works carried out by some other party. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that the recognition of special property rights in particular areas of the bed of the sea outsine the marginal belt for the purpose of sedentary fisheries does not conflict in any way with the common enjoyment by all mankind of the right of navigation of the v/aters lying over those beds or banks. Uor does it entail the recognition Of/of any special or exclusive right to the capture of swimming fish over or around these beds or banks. To sum up: so far as Great Britain at any rate is concerned, the ownership of the bed of the sea within the three-mile limit is the survival of more extensive claims to the ownership of and sovereignty over the bed of the sea. The claims have become restricted by the silent abandonment of the more extended claims. Consequently, where effective occupation has been long maintained of portions of the bed of the sea outside the three-mile limit, those claims are valid and subsisting claims, entitled to recognition by other States. The claim to the exclusive ownership of a portion of the bed of the sea and to the wealth which it produces in the form of pearl oysters, chanks, coral, sponges or other fructus of the soil is not inconsistent v/ith the universal right of navigation m the open sea or with the common right of the public to fish in the high seas.MNH 2 . recognise frankly that, as a matter of law, a State may 'by strictly local occupation acquire, for sedentary fisheries and for other purposes, sovereignty and property in the surface of the sea bed, provided that in so doing it in no way interferes with freedom of navigation and, perhaps we should add, with the breeding of free-swimming fish.P.Z.934/37. Extract from Diary of the British Residency and consulate General, Bushire, for December, 1936. 7. On the 9th December Dr. Blegvad, a Danish Marine biologist in the employ of the Iranian Government, arrived here and after making enquiries as to the variety of fishes obtainable at Bushire and down ports he left for Khorramshakr on the 16th accompanied by the officer in charge of the Iranian Naval Bureau here nakhuda Abdur Rahman Daryapaima, to make similar enquiries there. While at Bushire Dr. Blegvad stated that the Iranian Government have engaged him with a view to monopolising the pishing industry in the Iranian waters of the Persian Gulf and that from Khorramshahr he would proceed to Tehran to submit a report on the prospects of the venture, which in his view are good, and that he would then return to Bushire and start work. in the meantime, he said, a trawler bought by the Iranian Government will arrive here from Denmark and await his return from Tehran when he will begin fishing.CONFIDENTIAL.

Mth regard to wy jpuragrajsh 2 both Captain .Butler i;nd Colonel hoch point out that even on tne high seas difficulties »4iy arise, should Doctor Blegv d visit the Arab pearl banks. I entirely agree. 4. The pearl banks are scattered all down the Arab Coast from Kuwait to lias SD&amp;s&amp;nd&amp;m, very roughly speaking on the sice of a line drawn dov.n the middle of the Gulf. Almost all of these banks arc situated on the high seas, though a few of minor importance are within the territorial waters of various Arab Bhalkhdoss* 5. From one point of view their situation on the high seas might be held to make tnoc open to fishing by all and sundry, tout the Arabs natioiKls of the various Sheikhdoms c mcerned have, am exercise, the right of immemorial usage, and both His Majesty 1 s- 8 - Majesty 1 ® Ooverment &amp;mi tae Govera.T^nt of India hate in trie past upheld the principle that pearl banks are the property of the Arabs by discouraging at various times foreign attempts to exploit the beni;s, laorc especially by mechanical rtseans* 6.

At the same time our experience of tne Iranian Government hrs been such as to give cause for apprehension that any activity of theirs may result in political coi^plications and difficulties. This being so, I have thou^t it advisable to try to foresee certain specific difficulties which may arise in this case.Extract from Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf. Trucial Shaikhs warned not to grant concessions, 1900. In July 1900 Ratansi Parshotam, a British Indian merchant settled at Masqat, after obtaining leave from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and making arrangements with the Bani Yas tribe, sent two Indian divers with diving apparatus to the pearl banks; but the venture failed, in consequence, it was said, of the inexperience of the divers in pearling operations, and of the boat being taken by the Arab guides to an unsuitable place. The Government of India thought that the affair, if no notice were taken of it, might form an embarrassing precedent; and colonel Kemball, Political Resident at Bushehr, accordingly gave it to be known that permission for such undertakings should not be granted in future by the Trucial Shaikhs, and that British subjects seeking to obtain permission should be referred to the Resident. Enquiries by Colonel Kembail from the Shaikhs of Trucial Oman and Bahrain showed that the banks were regarded as the common property of the coast Arabs, that no Shaikh had the right to grant permission for diving to foreigners, and that the appearance of divers equipped with European diving dresses would probably not be regarded with equanimity by the local operatives. Accordingly in March 1902, when Tek Chand Dwarka, a British Indian subject in Bahrain, stated that he had been offered a concession by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi for pearl fishing by means of diving apparatus and enquired whether he could be guaranteed against molestation in case of his taking it up, he was informed by the Assistant political Agent in Bahrain that it was not legally in the power of the Shaikh to grant any concession of the sort. The next symptom of outside interest in the pearl fisheries was the visit of the 'Selika! T , a small Belgian steam yacht, to the Persian Gulf in the spring of 1901. The 'Selika”/ Belgian venture, 1901.British communication to the porte, 1901. 2 . 'Selika', after leaving Masqat, disappeared till the 11th of April, or about a month later, when she made her appearance at Bahrain; but those on board admitted that most of the interim had been spent in the neighbourhood of the pearl banks, and it was afterwards ascertained that on their return to Europe they had disposed of a quantity of small pearls. It is noteworthy that in the same year it was announced, in the 'Daily Express' of the 9th of May 1901, that an influential German syndicate were negotiating with the Porte for a monopoly of the pearl fisheries along- the Ottoman shores of the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, with a view to working them by scientific methods; a somewhat similar statement also appeared at the same time in the 'Moniteur Oriental'. The British Ambassador at Constantinople accordingly brought it to the notice of the porte that the operations which appeared to be contemplated would excite the jealousy of the natives, and he alluded to the moral obligation under which the British Government l^r to protect the rights of the Trucial Shaikhs in the matter. The Turkish Minister denied knowledge of the negotiations, but he promised to take note of the Ambassador^ statement; and nothing further was heard of the syndicate or their scheme. The question of the international status of the pearl fisheries was at length, in 1903, brought to an issue by the apparent intention of two French subjects to establish themselves in Bahrain and take part in the industry. M.M.Dumas and Castelin, the former a partner in the Marseilles firm of Dumas et Guien, arrived in Bahrain in February 1903; M.Dumas was provided with letters of recommendation from the French Ministries of Commerce and Foreign Affairs. On the 25th of March M.Dumas called on the British political Resident at Bushehr and sounded him as to the possibility of engaging in the fishery; he was informed by Colonel Kemball that his operations would be attended/mmmm attended by risk, and that he would probably meet with active opposition. M.Dumas then returned to Bahrain, and in April he made advances to the Shaikh through Tek Chand; but his overtures were repulsed by the Shaikh, who asserted the grant of a pearling concession to be impossible. Ultimately, in May 1903, his affairs making no progress, and an outbreak cf plague having occurred, M.Dumas left Bahrain and was not again seen there; but the importance and scope of the questions which his project had all but raised were now fully appreciated, and steps were taken by the Government of India to bring them to a settlement. It was foreseen that, in event of the forcible intrusion on the fishery of European foreigners, the Trucial shaikhs would immediately appeal for protection to the British Government; and it was therefore necessary that a line of policy should be laid down in advance. Legal opinion in regard to British policy 1905. The matter was placed before His Majesty ! s Government in a despatch of the Government of India, dated the 8 th of March 1904, and it was subsequently referred for opinion to the Law Officers of the Crown. The finding of the Law Officers, dated the 11th of February 1905, dealt separately with the question of the rights of the Arab tribes and with that of effective steps for their protection. The Law Officers were of opinion that, within the three-mile limit and in any other waters which might justly be considered territorial, the tribes of the Arabian coast were entitled to the exclusive use of the pearl fisheries. As regards pearl banks outside territorial waters it was held that, as a matter of international law, such banks were capable of being the property of the tribes to the exclusion of all nations; and the case of the Ceylon pearl banks and the views of various authorities* were cited in support of *0ne of these was the Swiss publicist Vattel who in his 'Droit des Gens' has remarked: 'Qui doutera que les p^cheries de perles de Bahrein et de ceylan ne puissent Idgitimement tomber en propridt^?'4 this view; whether such proprietary rights existed in the case of the Persian Gulf banks or not was, however, a question the answer to which must depend on the evidence available as to the enjoyment of the bank fisheries by the tribes and i the exclusion of others from them. It was added, with reference to the banks, that there appeared to be grounds for asserting the possession by the tribes of an exclusive right of fishery; that the enjoyment of such a right by the tribes in common was not a bar in law to its acquisition; and that, regard being had to the relations of His Majesty*s Government with the tribes on the western shores of the Gulf, the existence of the right might properly be maintained on their behalf by His Majesty*s Government. With regard to deep waters, where the tribes themselves had not been accustomed to fish, it did not appear to the Law Officers that a claim by the tribes to exclude aliens from such waters could be advanced with any chance of success. The recommenaations of the Law Officers in regard to practical measures of protection were that fishing by foreigners within territorial waters might be prevented, but that indirect means should, if possible; be taken to discourage them from pearling on the non-territorial banks or in deep water; in the last resort, however, it would be admissible, in the case of the banks only, to effect the compulsory removal of the vessels; but such measures should be taken with caution, and only after obtaining authority irom the local chiefs. The Law Officers also pointed out that the whole question might be raised, if this were considered politic, in a form suitable for decision by the Hague Tribunal; but they added that, as the result of such a reference was uncertain, it would probably be better to avoid raising the question internationally.?&gt;r Extract from Gazeteer of the Persian Gulf . Vol.I, Part ll. Yesseis provided for the preventive service, 1903-06. Steps were also taken to improve the general efficiency of the preventive establishment. At the beginning of 1903 the Belgian steam yacht 'Selika' - which in 1901 had achieved a certain political notoriety in the Persian Gulf - was purchased from Europe and, under the name of 'Mozaffer', was employed for the prevention of smuggling; she carried a couple of small Hotchkiss guns and was officered in the beginning by four Europeans, two of whom were engineers but later the places of the European engineers were taken by natives of Baghdad. In the autumn of 1903 funds were provided for the purchase of 5 armed sea going steam-launches of 10 knots for the preventive service; in the following year the contract for their construction was placed by the Persian Government with the Hoyal Indian Marine dockyard at Bombay; and in June 1906 two of them had been completed and were ready for delivery after the monsoon.Confidential # EXPRESS ■ i Q A Q 'A C 4 Z ..

In order however to co-relate hie information with cond itions on the Arab Coast he may wish to enter Arab territorial waters and his vessel, being in the employ of the Iranian Government, will presumably fly the Iranian flag and will be temporarily at all events, an Iranian Government craft. 4. Tnough this is the case tha vessel will not be a vessel of &gt;var, and, this being so, it appears to ma that for a mere visit (i.e. to refuel etc.), under international law and pract ice, the Iranian Government will not have to give official notification to, or seeJc permission from, the Rulers of the Arab ctatesr if this notification or permission vere necessary .ictlon/action would have to be taken by the Iranian Government through us* 5* If, however. Dr* Blagvad wishes to carry out invest- ig&amp;tions in Arab waters then p©railssion must be obtained by the Iranian Government through us from the Arab klers concerned 6* In considering whether Arab Bulers should or should not b© advised by us to give such permission the fact will have to be borne in mind that these activities may quite probably not be welcomed by the local Arabs, especially in the less settled coastal areas, who may suspect Dr*Blegvad, (doubtless quite wrongly) of having designs on their pearl banks or fishing grounds* 7* In the circumstances I venture to suggest that the range of Dr* Blegvad , s activities might be ascertained as soon as possible from the Iranian Government* Sd.
