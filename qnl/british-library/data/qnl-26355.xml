My Lord, In my confidential despatch No. 171 (72/8/58) of May 3rd last, I alluded to the possibility of the Japanese endeavouring to inaugurate on air service between Formosa and Bangkok via Hanoi. In this connexion, I have ^ust received the following information in strict secrecy from Mr. Jackson, the Operations Manager of the Aerial Transport Company of Siam, which is, as Your Lordship knows, a Siamese Company Itself operating internal services in this country, and which acts as the local agent for Messrs. Imperial Airways and Air France. 2. Mr. Jackson s id that, some little time ago, the Japanese Minister here, Mr. Mural, invited Fhya Chalerm Akas, the Chief of the Siamese Division of Civil Wiation, to corne and see him. It was a question, apparently, of the Siamese Government having insisted that, in the event of a Japanese service to Bangkok being inaugurated, its agent here must be the Aerial Transport Company. Mr. Murai accordingly wished to discuss the personnel of the Compiany with phya Cholerm Akas, who found him with a copy of the '’Bangkok Directory” before him, looking up the information concerning it v/hich appears in that publication. Mr. Murai enquired who were the foreigners on the Company^ staff, and was told that they consisted of a ground engineer in the employ of Messrs. Imperial Airways and of Mr. Jackson. With respect The Right Honourable to/ Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., etc., etc., etc.2. to the latter, Mr. Murai asked whether he was English or American, and was told that he was neither, but a Canadian! I am not aware of what else was said, but Mr. Murai must have made some impression upon Phya Chalerm Akes, for the latter came back and, in telling Mr. Jackson of Mr. Murai’s enquiry about him, emphasised that he (Mr. Jackson) in his capacity of an employee of the Aerial Transport Company must forget that he was even 'Canadian' and must be wholly Siamese* 3. It would thus appear that the Japanese are still occupied with the idea of an air service to Bangkok. As far as Mr. Jackson knows, however, neither they nor the Germans have reached an agreement upon the subject with the Siamese Government, which will in any event stipulate that the Aerial Transport Company shall be the agent for any services that may be established. 4. I am transmitting copies of this despatch to His Majesty f s Ambassador in Tokyo; to the Air Vice-Marshal Commending the Royal Air Force, Far East, at Singapore; and to the Air Attache 7 to this Legation.

I enclose copies of all these telegrams for ease of reference and also a copy of Foreign Office telegram No. 12 Tour of 20th April to Hankow. I am afraid that the Government of India must find it very troublesome to pick out telegrams on any particular subject from the mass of recent telegrams about the China situation especially since owing to Foreign Office rules copies of secret cypher telegrams have to be sent by sea mail while code telegrams go by air mail. I doubt if we can do much to help you as regards this but we are making arrangements to ensure at any rate that copies of any correspondence on the subject of Sino^Burma communications which we receive from the Foreign Office are/ Hi M3 y/* % are in future sent to the External Affairs Department instead of to other departments of the Government of India.

While His Majesty's Government realise that during present hostilities it may be impossible to extend the service further to the east than Yunnanfu they hope that this service will eventually link up with extended services to other parts of China. The Chinese Government will realise that His Majesty's Government cannot regard Yunnanfu as a suitable eventual terminus and must therefore ask that they may receive an assurance that if and when extended services are organised by the Chinese, they will receive permission to operate through services beyond Yunnanfu over the routes to Hongkong and r hanghai as soon as conditions permit. You may inform Chinese Government that the necessary reconnaissance of the route in Burma for use by the air service is now being undertaken and permission may shortly be sought to make a trial flight to Yunnahfu.

Fossibility of extension to Burma frontier of Imperial Airways services to link up with Burasia Corporation. 2. In my immediately succeeding telegram I repeat report received, from Governor of Burma of discussion with Chinese Vice- Minister of Communications from whom this project emanated, hang left Rangoon on 26th January for Yunnanfu ? which he expected to reach about 15th February. 5. Following were the conclusions reached by His Majesty’s Government before receipt of Governor’s telegram:- The particular suggestion which fang originally made, namely, an extension of Imperial Airways to a point at or near Burma-Yunnan frontier could not at present be entertained for following reasons:- (a) Imperial Airways would require financial assistance for such a purpose and there could have been no question of His Majesty’s Government at present spending money on a short extension of that kind in addition to existing route via Bangkok and projected route via Southern Shan States, neither of which could be abandoned on account of it, (b) The suggestion originally put forward appeared to involve exchange of traffic at or near frontier and this cm U o across accepted policy of developing air routes on an interna tional rather than a sectional basis. 4. In considering Nang’s original suggestion, however, His Majesty’s Government examined also the wider question of desirability of securing an opening for air communication with China by the/ 7i } - ) direct inland route and any other means which might be considered towards this end, and on this wider question they reached the following conclusions (i) In view of importance of our relations with China at lie presen g time it would be undesirable to return negative reply without suggesting any alternative, f ,ii) moreover, establishment of a route from Burma to iumanfu mighu become strategically important for us as providing onlj saie air route to .Hongkong in event of Japanese hostile activity, (in) The possibility has also been considered than if such a route were established it would become international and the G-euians would have some clamm. to equal treatment for continuation to tnina oi their service across India and Burma, It is felt, however, that it would be impossible and indeed undesirable to objeoG, as go go so might force them to fall bacw again on the Central Asia route via Afghanistan. bo In view of these considerations His Majesty’s Government weie 03 . opinion that reply to original Chinese suggestion should be to tne effect that while the actual suggestion for an extension of im Or.ricU Airways go Ghe Burma frontier was not one which could be entertained as such, any proposals which Auras!a Corporation might v/i sh to out i or ward lor an extension of their OY ; /n service into Burma by this route to link up the existing air lines would be given sympathetic consideration, subject to the understanding that recipiocal lacilities would be made available for a. British line to operate to China by the same route when so desired. As a result, however, of discussions with Jang and Miao reported in Rangoon telegram dated 29th January, Chinese sugges- i0 ^ a ' re k/een Qe ^sloped in a form which His Majesty’s Government +• q y o .L .y iwpf'nwnniwwii 12 '/ 0 # feel will be of great importance if fang's personal suggestions are ta*\n up by Chinese Government, fhese neu suggestions not only strengthen the possibility of building up a connexion between Burma and China 3 but might also be used as a lever to ash for reciprocal rights not merely to Yunnanfu (which would not by itself be of much value) but also on the routes beyond Yunnanfu to Hongkong and Shanghai. It might even become possible to visualise a Sino- British company employing British machines and personnel. The immediate step, however, would be for the Chinese to organise the routes referred to in the Rangoon telegram. 7. You should therefore arrange for the discussions to be continued with Yang or the Central Chinese Government on the basis explained above. You should state that His Majesty's Government attach considerable importance to the suggestions which emerged from .iang's discussions in Burma. In the course of the discussion you should suggest that the first step is for the Chinese to organise the suggested routes in China, and should state that any proposal that Murasia Corporation, or such other Chinese company as operates these routes, should be allowed an extension from Yunnanfu to connect with existing air lines at Rangoon, will be referred for sympathetic consideration to the Govern:.lent of Burma and His majesty’s Government, subject to recognition of the right of reciprocity on the Chinese routes when it may be desired to exercise it. It could be explained that,though the-application which the Chinese themselves made in 1956 for an extension of the Yurasia ser vice to Rangoon was refused at the time,His Majesty's Government,in their desire to meet the Chinese request in any possible way,have recently had the latter under review as a result of which they would be willing ta consider a similar proposal now provided that the understanding as to reciorocity is obtained. 8.

On the other hand, in view of suggestion that extensive air routes in China should be taken up by or in association v/ith British interests, the Chinese presumably will have no difficulty in giving undertaking to give Imperial Airways rights on these lines and on the connection betv/een Yunnan Pu and Burma if these routes are established by Chinese agency. 6.

Dear Hall, I am eorry that 1 have not replied before to your letter of the 09th April about the suggested air line bet*f&lt; en Burma anft Tengyueh. The po ait ion le ©till somewhat obscure, and I am afraid that I am not even noa able to give y m a very satisfactory answer. When the proposal for the creation of a Chinese Company to operate between Tengyueh and Bhamo was first mooted, the Government of India felt, as you know, that it ought to be considered in relation to the various other scheme© which were then under examination in London for connecting up the Imperial air routes in Burma with China and Hongkong. Subsequently, however, the Tengy teh merchant© put forward their proposal for a single isolated flight on this route ,*not to be regarded as connected in any 'way/tt way with the permanent service”. This proposal had the support of the Government of India, the In^iia Office, Air Ministry and ourselves and the necessary steps would have to be taken to obtain permission from the Chinese Government had it not been felt at the last moment that this application might prejudice the negotiation® which were then being carried on in Hanking about the use of Hopg Kong by China national Airways Limited (see Mr* Howe * &amp; telegram to the Foreign Office Ho. 41, which was repeated to you). The negotiations about Hongftmg are not, I fear, completed, but as we have recently agreed to allow China national Airways to make use of Hoig Kong without any conditions of x reciprocity, it may be assumed that a eatisfaefcory settlement will be found in the very near future. After that there would, so far as we can see, be no further objection to a single experimental flight on the line® x iu u 6 g*;* '{ 0 'X Tot*-' T/ i CJI.^ W-AJ/ proposed./Cypher telegraiji to ;.:r = Howe (Nani^ing)« Foreign Office. 6th July, 1956. 10.50 p. No. 85 Tour. Your telegram No. 80 [of 9th June: Use of Hongkong by China National airways]. It has now been decided that we must, if necessary, waive condition of most-favoured-nation treatment. This decision is prompted by importance which we attach to the acceptance of our offer by China National airways. Unless Company can be induced to make Hongkong a point of call the bulk of Chinese traffic for nurope may be diverted to Hanoi. Nevertheless we are far from satisfied with attitude of Chinese Government. You should seek interview with Minister for Foreign Affairs or other appropriate authority and express our disappointment at refusal of Chinese Government go grant the very small measuie of reciprocity for which we have asked. I You may press tactfully for explanation and suggest that while His Majesty’s Government have no desire to embarrass.Chinese authorities they would welcome opportunity of full joint examination of the problem. You should then state that His Majesty's Government are willing in the meancime not to piec,s for a formal guarantee of most-favoured-nation treatment and will permit China Airways to operate to Hongkong unconditional ly, subject to working arrangement with Imperial Airways. At the same time they feel justified in expecting that Chinese Government will not permit other foreign European services to be operated into Chinese/territory without giving similar facilities ...facilities to British companies. This latter request, though no longer a condition sinejpia no_n on our part, should he acceptable bo Chinese Covernment, particularly if their reason for refusing general most favoured-nation guarantee is fear of Japanese pressure.

We presume that the Government of Burma also sent you a copy of their telegram Ho. 29-C of 23th January which is also referred to in Foreign Oxfice telegram No. 171 of 16th February to Shanghai? I enclose copies of all these telegrams for ease of reference and also a copy of Foreign Office telegram No. 12 Tour of 20th April to Hankow. I am afraid that the Government of India must find it very troublesome to pick out telegrams on any particular subject from the mass of recent telegrams about the China situation especially since owing to Foreign Office rules copies of secret cypher telegrams have to be sent by sea mail while code telegrams go by air mail. I doubt if we can do much to help you as regards this but we are making arrangements to ensure at any rate that copies of any correspondence on the subject of Sino-Burma communications which we receive from the Foreign Office are/3. are in future sent to the External Affairs Department instead of to other departments of the Government of India. We assume however that in so far as air communications are concerned you will not require to he informed of all the details and that it will he sufficient to keep you in touch with major developments. The question of the development of land communications would seem to concern India more closely.

Military Attache believes central government to be finished. Mr* Mac^cillop, who does not go so far, thinks they will crack when forced to leave Hankow if not earlier but does not foresee subjection of China as a necessary concomitant. My own views are these. If dowers stand aside completely central government rnay well crack before economic and financial pressure compels Japan to relax her grip. Moreover it is possible but by no means certain that if we were to encourage China to make peace with Japan on any terms they might lose heart and seek to negotiate. But this would not necessarily bring about peace. Whatever may happen in North, Southern leaders will not easily accept Japanese domination nor will they agree to any terms recognising economic or political domination of the North by Japan. I think that if Chiang Kai-shek were to endeavour to make peace on such terms Kuangsi generals would assume control and would have behind them not only sympathy of vast majority of Chinese but some of the best organised forces in the country i.e. their own (gp. undec.) men and Communist troops. ■ Sven/i;. Even if Japeneoe claimed what are helieved to he their nearer objectives their approximate territory would still he hounded hy a line running from Paotou to Changsha and thence to position covering only about one-fifth of the country (excluding Tibet and uinkiang) enormous forces would he necessary and enormous risks have to he taken if they were to proceed further. Let us assume every vestige of central government control gone in occupied area even including the port of Canton: Japanese in full control of customs, salt etc.: a crash of the entire financial structure based on revenues reserves and credit of central govern ent* Even then I do not rule out possibility ofa central government under leadership of Kuangsi group continuing to function effectively (by Chinese standard) in the rest of China. I think they might well succeed in ’’rational organisation” of this remaining territory maintaining a fighting force which while /2 gps* omitted7 effective attack would make establishment of peaceful government by Japanese puppets in neighbouring provinces exceedingly difficult. So long as there is an effective Chinese govern .ent in any part of the country claiming to be the govern lent of China it must attract better elements and prevent drift towards any bogus organisation. If I am ripht in this view then whether or no we supply Chiang Kai-shek with arms and financial assistance and whether or no we discourage its will to fight there will still remain a central govern lent in lineal success !dh to government which we have recognised and in more or less effective control of four-fifths of the country. If arms and financial assistance were available government would be by so much stronger. I do not suggest we should provide this government with any special facilities but/3. tat I do not agree that we should restrict those supplies which this government is able to obtain by re?son of o i undjJ? neutrality* Our League obligations permit us to sympathise with incessant difficulties of Chinese government and this attitude seems to have full support of current popular opinion in Great Britain. Though we should not go out of our way to provoke Japan nothing is to be gained by attempting to placate her. British interests in Japanese dominated territory would receive no more consideration simply because we had thrown over central governnent. Japanese find us in their way all along the line. Our only fault is that we got there first. !$e are feeling their pressure at a hundred points and a policy of weak conciliation will not get us anywhere. I hold further that it is to our definite advantage to break Japanese stranglehold on Chinese coastline by encouraging building up line of communication road rail and air - across Chinese Western frontier. Internal communication system in West China is expanding rapidly under impulse of government war needs and I believe it important to our future trade to link up tnis system with Burma at as many points as possible.

Sir The local press announces the inauguration as from to-day of an air service between Hanoi and Yunnanfu which will be operated by the Eurasia Aviation Corporation. 2. According to these renorts only one flight per week in each direction is at present contemplated. This will be made ea^h Thursday, when an aeroplane of the new service is scheduled to arrive in Hanoi from Yunnanfu at 9.45 a.m., leaving again for Yunnanfu the same morning at 10.15 a.m. The duration of the flight between the two air oorts is estimated at two and three ouarter hours. The renort adds thnt from Yunnanfu the aeroplane will nroceed the same day to Chengtu, the canital of Szechwan, whence air connexion may be obtained the following day in the directions of Sian and Hankow, 3. The machines employed by the Eurasia Aviation Corporation for this service are stated to be equipped with three motors of the BMW Hornet type of 650 horse-power developing a maximum speed of kms 270 and with a cruising speed of kms 230 per hour. ■ Apart from their crew they have accommodation for 15 passengers. The pilots and wireless operators employed on the new line are stated to have previously been in the service of the Deutsche Lufthansa with sty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office LONDON.with long experience of Chinese air routes. 4. It is pointed out that the new service will not only provide Tonkin with a convenient and rapid means of communication with Yunan, hut will also produce a considerable acceleration in the transport of passengers, mail and merchandise for central China (Sian, Hankow and Changsha), while important towns in the Yangtze valley will he brought within two days distance of Hanoi. It is considered that the new line will also confer great benefi&gt;s on tourism, opening un, as it will, parts of China which have hitherto been largely inaccessible to travellers. It is also claimed that the connexion with the Air France services made by the new line at Hanoi will confer upon China the benefit of a more speedy communication with Europe than is at present possible via Hongkong. 5.

Secretary of State Council perusal.... via Burma Minute. This telegram is not altogether clear, hut presumably what the Chinese are seeking is a link with Imperial Airways service from Rangoon via Bangkok and Hanoi to Hong Kong, permission for which was obtained from the Siamese by an exchange of notes on December 3rd. the routes (a; Rangoon-Bangkok-Singapore, and (b) Bangkok-Pitsanuloke-Hong Kong; any inter mediate landings between Bangkok or Pitsanuloke and Hong Kong are to be made at Udorn. i Commencing 19th December, Imperial Airways 1 service to Hong ru&gt;ng will operate the route Rangoon-Bangkok-Hanoi-Hong Kong. In 1934 overtures were made to the .nir Ministry by a representative of the Deutsche Luft Hansa Co. of Berlin that in return for help in obtaining from H.m.G. the right for the Chinese murasia Coy. to fly a mail service This exchange of notes gives Imperial airways authority to operate regular services over 4592 1000 2.36 from— ■ from Yunnan~fu across Burma to Kangoon, and for Luft Hansa to fly via Athens to Baghdad, Imperial airways should have the exclusive privilege of carrying the mails of these services Between Rangoon and Baghdad, or possibly on to Athens. These suggestions did not appeal to H.M.G., partly Because there was no likelihood of the Chinese government giving reciprocal permission for imperial airways to fly to Hong Kong; moreover, in the absence of any organised route Between purma and Yunnan the proposal that aurasia should fly direct to Rangoon was not considered practicable. All that the present telegram may mean is that ^urasia are anxious By means of the extension of their present service via Changsha to Canton to link up at hong Kong with the service which Imperial Airways are starting this week via Bangkok, which would presumably entail that until the projected German service to the Far r^ast via India is established imperial airways would convey hurasia’s mails from Hong Kong to murope. On the other hand, it may be a revival on the part of Burasia of the proposal that they should be allowed to fly direct to itangoon linking up with Imperial Airways there. as regards the direct route to Hong xvong via the chan otates, the present position i &gt;, according to our information, that reconnaissance flights made over the western section of this route|led to the conclusion that a route from Akyab to Magwe, Thazi, and Loilem to a plain at wan Pong would present no great diff culties, and that while the continuation to Luang Prabang in Indo-China required more examination, there wasIn any further communication on this subject, please nuote J no. i , o-y a j 5 °) vy /1*1 aip^^ddress —not to any person by nam^, but'to— / / Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1 .

Sir, i am directed to refer to paragraph 2 of this Department letter No.ViQ, dated the 17th June 1937, and to say that with the separation of Burma from India, the Government of India's interest in the proposed air route to Hong Kong via the Shan States is extremely limited. They do not therefore consider that they will he justified in incurring any expendi ture from Indian revenues for the purpose of the proposed surveys in connection with the contemplated route. The Government oi India are, however, prepared to allow the reconnaissance party the use of the ■Avro X at the rates charged for Government flights if the reconnaissance is undertaken and completed before the middle of December. i have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Joint Secretary to the Government of India.filo No Seriai No \l I* J^&gt;.No. i-yy / y' t311116 ^ ^ *J ( £ (LOA^ //fc; {'v^‘ rv '.

These flights were carried out in April last hy a party which included Mr. Tymms, the Director of Civil Aviation in India. The conclusion reached as the result of the flights is that ar air route from Akyah to Magwe, Thazi, and Loilem to a plain at Wan Pong, presents no great difficulty for modern aircraft with proper organisation. The continuation from Wan Pong to Luang Prahang in Indo-China needs more thorough examination, hut there is no reason to suppose that it will prove impossible. This route avoids both Siam and China, and would make the distance to be flown between Calcutta and Hong Kong 1,770 miles, as compared with the existing distance of 3,150 miles via Penang. Suitable landing ground sites have been found, but an essential requirement is a large and well-equipped aerodrome in the vicinity of Wan Pong together with a well- organised meteorological station.

DKA.16/6.1 SOUTHERN SHAN STATES—AIR ROUTE. JB. ^ ' 4&lt; ' Report on reconnaissance flights by the Director of Civil Aviation in India, 25th126th April 1937. I. The flights were undertaken in the Government of India Avro X VT-AOT in extension of an official tour to Burma by the Director of Civil Aviation. The personnel were,— Crew. Pilot.—Flight Lieut. Burbury. W|T Operator.—Mr. Green. Engineer.—Mr. Caroll. Passengers. Mr. F. Tymms, Director of Civil Aviation in India. Mr. A. Croad, Superintending Engineer, Aviation Circle, C. P. W. D. Capt. A. G. Wyatt, Engineer Officer, Civil Aviation. The flights covered the Southern Shan States between the Taunggyi-Kengtung Road on the north and the Siamese border on the south, to within 50 miles of the Indo-China frontier on the east, i.e., a belt between the parallels 20 ° N. and 21 ° N, upto 99° E. II. Earlier developments. ( 1 ) Attention was first drawn to a more direct air route to China by the. request of the Eurasia Corporation in 1935 for permission to investigate the route via Yunnan-Fu and Mandalay. An article on this route quoting the views of Captain Kingdon-Ward had appeared in ‘ ‘ The Whip ” of the 5th November 1934. An air service—particularly foreign—on this route, which would cross the Wa States, was considered politically undesirable by the Burma Government, and attention was then drawn by Mr. C. W. Scott, Indian Forest Service, to the advantages of the Southern Shan States, which offered a topographically more favourable route direct from Burma to Indo China, thus cutting out both China and Siam—both a source of political difficulty. The French Minister in Bangkok had suggested the investigation of this route to the British Charge d’Affaires at Bangkok, in January 1935. ( 2 ) In March and April 1936, a French expedition under the leadership of M. Winckler, an Air France pilot, travelled by road and river from Hanoi to Mandalay, through the Southern Shan States, for the purpose of investigating the route. A limited number of copies of M. Winckler’s rather depressing report - f is available. L (3) Early in 1936, the Burma Government, at the request of the Govern ment of India, arranged for reports on possible landing ground sites in the Shan States to be collected, and for regular observations of cloud height and visibility to be taken and reported monthly. The information collected is summarised in paragraph III. (4) In January 1937, the Air Ministry made proposals to the Government of India for a systematic investigation of the route by air and ground recon naissance, with the assistance of Air Ministry personnel. III. Info r mat ion collected by Burma Government. (1) Landing ground sites are reported to have been selected at, Aungban .. Lat. 20° 40' N. Long. 96° 39' E Sinhe (7 miles W. of Taimggyi) ..

(2) At Loikaw in the Karen States (Lat. 19° 40' N., Long. 97° 12' E. approxi mately), about 80 miles south of Taunggyi on the Thazi-Kentung Road, a temporary landing ground has been made by the Mawchi Mines for Indian Air Survey and Transport, Limited, who, in November 1936, carried out a photo graphic air survey of 2,500 square miles of territory to the south-west of Loikaw. The landing ground is a strip 750 X 150 yards but can easily be extended to 1,000 yards square. (See separate schedule.) (3) The climatological observations were started about June 1936 at,— A ungban. Shweuyaung (near Sinhe). Loilem. Kengtung. They have also been taken at three places in the Northern Shan States with which we are not immediately concerned (Old Lashio, Kutkai and Tangyan). (4) The observations are partially vitiated by lack of essential data, and steps are being taken to get them completed, but they show generally clear weather from November to April. Rainfall statistics have been published by the Indian Meteorological Department for Kalaw (near Aungban), Taunggvi Loilem and Loimwe (near Kengtung). Rainfall occurs mostlv in the months of May to October. Annual rainfall is 50 to 75 inches. Rainv days reach a maximum m August —22 at Kengtung, 18 elsewhere. The special observations are summarised below :— At Aim jib an there is a tendency to morning fog with visibilitv below 1 000 yams about once a month in September and October increasino - to ]0 times a month m November and December and persisting into January and Februarv— about once a month.

Maximum altitude of flight 13,000 feet. This flight was much interfered with in its later stages by clouds at three or four diflerent levels above and below us. 1000—1215 Loikaw to Rangoon. V. Observations. (1) The route between Rangoon and Loikaw (direct course) crossing the first range of mountains east of Toungoo on the Mandalay railway is not a very favourable route. It crosses very broken jungle covered mountainous country- heights 5,000 to 7,000 feet, with an isolated peak of 9,000 feet in the neighbour hood. The route across these mountains a hundred miles further north, between Yamethin and Aungban, is lower and easier. (2) Loikaw lies in a wide upland valley plain, at about 3,000 feet. An expanse of 20 miles from north to south and 10 miles from E. to M. closely resembles the plains of East Africa—grass land and park land, rolling to fiat in contour, intersected by streams, with isolated jungle covered hills and spurs. There is no difficulty in making an aerodrome (here and there good forced laud ing grounds) and no difficulty in flying, but because of the mountains both east and west of Loikaw it is not favourably situated for a through route. (3) The country covered by the first reconnaissance flight, i.e., a triangle with sides roughly 100 miles in length, with its apex at Loikaw in the south and its base along the Kengtung Road from Aungban to the Salween River in the north, presents no insuperable difficulty for organised flying. It consists essentially of a succession of upland plains similar to that at Loikaw, divided up by parallel ranges of hills, escarpments and mountains running north and south, and subsidiary hill features. The principal of these ranges passes just west of Loilem at 6,300 feet and culminates 30 miles further south in Loi Maw (8,100 feet) (Lat. 20° 27' N.; Long. 97° 25' E.). The individual ranges are of no great extent east to west, so constitute a series of independent obstacles in conditions of low cloud, rather than an extensive mountanous area. A similar type of country is believed to extend some distance north of the Kengtung road, and by repute is repeated in the Northern Shan States in the neighbourhood of Lashio and elsewhere. (4) The most favourable air route is, as might have been expected, already followed by the Kengtung Road;—at least as far as the Salween River (98° 40' E.). This route is also followed by a railway (metre gauge) from Thazi (Mandalay Railway) to Shwenyaung (approximately 97° E.). The mountains between the Mandalay Railway and Aungban and Kalaw are low (4,000 feet) and there is no need for an air route to follow the railway north to Thazi—a minor feature. The height of the successive level areas from west to east varies,— Aungban 4,500 feet. Shwenyaung (Railway terminus for Taunggyi) 3,000 feet. Hopong (97° 12' E.) 4,000 feet. Loilem about 4,500 feet. Wan Pong (extensive plain east and southeast of Loilem) 3,500 feet descending towards the east. (5) The most favourable position found for a main aerodrome is on the plain stretching along the road east or south-east of Wan Pon«- ( 20 ° 55 ' V \ 97 0 41' E ). ^ Wan Pong is 8 miles E. of Loilem. It is only a minor village but lies at the junction of the Kengtung and Mongnai roads, and is used as a reference point for a lack of a better. It will be borne in mind that observation was from an average height of 4,000 to 5,000 feet above ground and it thereforedoes not embrace minor features. This plain is open and extensive, stretching many miles to the south of the road and embracing Mongsit and Mongnai. On it a site could be selected sufficiently removed from high hills and mountains to permit of the organisation of bad weather flying. The only one of the sites selected by Burma Government officers which .could be approximately located ^ trom the air (due to lack of data) was Loilem, and it appears certain that Loilem itself is too much encircled by hills to be suitable for an aerodrome for air transport purposes. The indications are that the plain east and south of Wan Pong is likely to prove the key to the route, as the site for a main aerodrome, equipped with wireless communication and D. F. and a main meteorological station, which would be used for refuelling and as a haven in really bad weather, but which would have little or no traffic significance. ( 6 ) Contrary to preconceived notions the route as far east as W r an Pong would not lie over uncivilised country. It has an organised motor road, which extends to Kengtung, a railway part of the way, and it passes over such centres as Kalaw (a hill station), Taunggyi and Loilem while the country round Mongnai produces potatoes for the Calcutta market. (7) The Inle Lake, vieAved from a considerable altitude appears to be shallow over an extensive area on the north, west and south sides. On the east side it is closely bordered by a high range of hills, at least 2,500 feet above the surface of the lake. WTien seen it was glassy calm, but in April 1936, an Irrawaddy Flotilla seaplane crashed here, the accident being ascribed to down currents of air. The lake does not appear suitable for the operation of large flying boats. ( 8 ) The territory covered by the second day’s flight, which was undertaken with the object of reviewing a section of country further south, and particularly certain low flat areas in the neighbourhood of the Mekong River at the junction of the three frontiers of Burma, Siam and Indo China, is as nearly impossible for an air route as one could find—short of the Himalayas. (9) All the country east of Loikaw, for nearly 100 miles, extending to the south into Siam and bounded on the north and north-west by the Mongnai Plain, consists of a high limestone massif with peaks reaching nearly 7,000 feet— the whole an incredible jumble of precipitous hills, valleys and gorges, every inch covered with the densest jungle. Not a flat square yard of ground is to be seen, nor any evidence of habitation. Through this the Salween River cuts its way in a tremendous V shaped gorge down to below 1,000 feet, at first running in its main course due south to latitude 20° 10 / N., then W. S. W. for about 70 miles to a point 30 miles E. of Loikaw, whereafter it runs south again. The description just given applies mainly to the country on either side of the river where it runs W. S. W. (10) East of the Salween River in this southern area, be., say, east of 99° E., the country falls away rapidly to altitudes varying from 5,000 to 2,000 feet, and a fairly extensive area in the region of the junction of the three frontiers down to 1,500 feet. Unfortunately, while the lie of the land could be seen from the configuration of the clouds, this country, which was the main objective of the second flight, could not be observed because it was covered with cloud. An attempt to reach Kengtung and observe the country in the neighbour hood of the road from there west to the Salween River was also frustrated by cloud. Judging from the map and what had already been seen, however, T con clude, that a more southerly course in this region, i.e., a course from Wan Pong (the main aerodrome proposed) about E. S. E. to the junction of the three frontiers, would traverse lower and more favourable country than that along the road to Kengtung. In this S. E. corner of the Shan States there are believed to be a number of level areas of low T altitude, and particularlv one of considerable extent (mostly in Siam) at the bend of the Mekong River at the junction of the three frontiers. M. Winckler reports some “ beautiful plains ” in this region near Chieng Sen and Chieng Rai. B VI. Points from M. Winckler's report. ( 1 ) The northern part of Indo-China (upper Laos) is extremely difficult climatically and topographically, sparsely inhabited and in some parts scarcelv administered. This refers to country in the region of parallel 21 ° N„ and north of it.5 (2) In Tnrlo China the route would have to go as far south as Luang Prabang (just below 20° N.). The country at Luang Prabang is sufficiently open and the landing ground could be made into a first class aerodrome. (3) It is even suggested that the route should go as far south as Vientiane (about 18° N.). (A glance at the map will shew that if the route goes as far south as this, it would be better to go through Rangoon, and in this case, the route would cross Siam.) ( 4 ) Good open country and suitable sites for landing grounds were observed in the vicinity of Chieng Sen and Chieng Rai (near the junction of the three frontiers) and at Wan Pong (on the Kengtung Road—see above). VII. Conclusions. ( 1 ) A direct route to China in the vicinity of Mandalay and Yunnanfu would involve crossing high mountains, up to 10,000 or 12,000 feet. The direct route between Calcutta and Mandalay via Chittagong involves crossing 120 miles of the Arakan Yomas which here reach 8,000 to 9,000 feet. Further, the Govern ment of Burma see political objections to an air route crossing the Burma-China frontier. The political difficulties in China would probably be still greater. ( 2 ) Further south, an air route through the Northern Shan States might bp practicable. (It has not been examined) but it would lead to the Chinese frontier. (3) An air route from Akyab, passing approximately over Magwe (Irra waddy valley), Thazi (Mandalay Railway), thence following the Kengtung road over Taunggyi and Loilem to a plain at Wan Pong, west of the Salween River, presents no great difficulty for modern aircraft with proper organisation. (4) From Wan Pong, because of the unfavourable country in this latitude in Indo China, the route should take a south-easterly course to the Mekong River at the junction of the three frontiers, thence to Luang Prabang in Indo China. This part of the route needs more thorough examination, but there is no reason to suppose that it will prove impossible. (5) The physical difficulties encountered in the flight from Akyab are,— (i) The Arakan Yomas, between Akyab and the Irrawaddy River, altitude 5,000—6,500 feet. Width of mountains 50 miles, jungle covered. The Arakan Yomas reach 10,200 feet in Mt. Victoria 70 miles north of the Akyab parallel and in that latitude are more extensive. South of Akyab they dwindle in height and width. Direct crossings of the mountains in this region in the monsoon are not infrequently made by the existing services. (ii) The Pegu Yomas, a forest clad range of hills reaching a general altitude below 2,000 feet, but with isolated peaks up to 5,000 feet and a width of 30 to 40 miles between Magwe and Thazi. (Hi) A succession of ridges, mostly jungle covered, between Thazi and Wan Pong, reaching varying heights up to 6,300 feet west of Loilem. The ridges are relatively narrow and separated by plains of varv- ing extent. (iv) A stretch of about 100 miles of broken hilly country, jungle covered, between Wan Pong and the Indo China frontier in the south-east! General altitude 5,000—6,000 feet, but with low areas and descend ing towards the south east. 7 ( 6 ) The key to the organisation of the route in Burma will be the construc tion of a large aerodrome m the vicinity of Wan Pong. This aerodrome must be equipped with the most up-to-date wireless communication and direction find ing equipment, to enable aircraft when necessary to descend through clouds at this point with safety. A well-organised meteorological station is also essential I his should probably be of the auxiliary station class (Indian Meteorological organisation), in communication with the forecast station to be established in Rangoon. (7) Auxiliary organisation would be valuable at the following places (i) Magwe or Yenangyaung in the Irrawaddy valley—an emero-encv landing ground in case of difficulty in crossing the Arakan Moun tains. Tenangyaung is the centre of the Burma oil fields and the landing ground would have some commercial utility. A site for a6 landing ground at Magwe has already been surveyed, but the project was abandoned for economy reasons. Because of the inter- rerence of the mountains with the Akyab D. F. station, a D. F. station at this landing ground would be valuable. Thazi, Pyawbwe or Yamethin on the Mandalay railway—an emergency landing ground for the crossing of the mountains to the eaot. Observation from the air suggests that there would be no difficulty in finding a site and in fact a small landing ground has been licensed at Pyawbwe. A D. F. W|T station would be useful for the crossing of the Pegu Yomas to the west and the Shan States mountains to the east. (Hi) Emergency landing grounds could be made at Aungban and Sinhe. (iv) An emergency landing ground site should be found in the vicinity of the Mekong River, at the junction of the three frontiers (Burma, Siam and Indo China).

Ihe aeroplane should work from a temporary landing ground to be first constructed for t ^’purpose at or near Wan Pong. Loikaw is too far away for the range ot most aeroplanes available. The Government of India Avro X or an Indian National Airways Dragon are the most suitable types available m India or Burma (Irrawaddy Flotilla and Airways are not prepared to operate again from the Pile Lake, which in any case is too far from the centre of the area to be examined). These aeroplanes have to be flown from Delhi at considerable expense, and as regards the Avro X the Government of India do not propose to maintain it for Government service after November 1937. The choice of an aeroplane should be left for the time being. An estimate of the cost of the ground and air reconnaissance to be effected in the cold weather of 1937-38 is being prepared. (10) Two key maps are attached. Further reference should be made to the “ India and adjacent countries ” 1|M series. Minor place names will be found on the Survey of India 1 [250,000 sheets, which are available for practically the whole of the Shan States.

We had., therefore, to wire the French Residents on the frontier enquiring whether they could let us have the rupees we would need, paper money not being current in those regions. All the replies wo received were in the negative with the exception of the. imply from the Resident at Bun Houai Sai,which compelled us to take the route through that village. It is forth whil e mentioning that in Rs. 2, tpo (about 60 kgs) we only received one had one,whereas in Burma One generally receives..5. to 15% spurious rupees. In our pr eparations ' we had to pay particular attention to the following points a) Arms and ammunition T We carried : 1 Winchester rifle 1 Maulicher 8 m.m. rifle 1' sports gun Vemey, 12 calihie 1 7.65 Browning revolver All the ammunition was carried in soldered boxes p M, • : - ; ' b) Equipment: We took with us: 1 large tent to be put up between trees or to be used as a covering when not put up. Cambodian mattresses Bedding 3 Camp beds Acetylene lamps. - Electric torches . c - v ' v • ■ .V ' In addition, all the members of the mission were equipped with thick cotton Clothes, khaki shirts, waterproofs, sandals with crepe soles. We also had two saddles for the horses for the Head of the mission and his Deputy.' Our equipment included packets of candles, some calcium carbide (about 60 kgs) a few dozen boxes of matches. All these were in sealed boxes. We also took with us for the natives encountered in the villages, about 150 francs., worth of glass beads and 15 kgs of salt. We also calculated for stores to last lOQdays for one small meal in the morning and for only one ; * ■ •. r \ 1 meal a day (partly European food, tinned provisic' s, vegetables, potatoes, partly Annamite food)r\ X expecting that the second meal could he got from the local inhabitants. The journey has proved that vie were not mis taken in this respect. ill the perishable goods were taken in sealed boxes. ?rom a medical point of view 'we had all six members of the expedition examined before departure to ensure that all were free from any sickness and that all were capable of travelling for three months in the wilds. We also took with us boxes containing medicines. These, : boxes, like the boxes containing stores', wore all of one kind.A -G eographical The maps we have had In our possession are near if all wrong except for the courses of navigable rivers which are relatively well drawn because they represented the only means of travel in many cases. There still exist unexplored areas utilised by Chinese bandits and smugglers who work between China and Siam because they are hindered by no one; no European lives in these parts. From a-purely ge6graphical point of vlew ? the Upper Laos and Upper Burma constitute a very mountainous region made up of a serios of peaks close together resembling in their' form, their gradient 9 their structures etc., the Bay of Along.* U'/rv-: The so mountains, except in the r ;gion between Sonia and Dion Bien Phu, arc completely covered by imporiGtrablG forests: pathways novertheloss exist but so narrow in places that the packs must be taken off tho horses to enable them to get through* It was evident elsewhere f rom what we were able to see that the mountains become higher and higher as we went northwards, where they reached a height of about 3,000 metres. B - Geological An extremely tortuous region, consisting of linn or sandstone rocks which leave at the bottom of the valleys rod clay soil which has after the slightest rain the consistency of solid tallow. Some alluvial rogions exist along tho rivers and streams at tho bottom of _tho valleys and therefore unsuitable for aviation purposes because they are either too small or are under rice cultivation which is the only wealth of the country.m On rare occasions one finds/certain mountainous regions of granite or slate ? which goes to show that in these mountain ranges all the geological epochs are represented. I \. G - Climate The climate between randalay and Hanoi is regulated by the two monsoons; that;;.is to say 9 the north-east monsoon in winter and the south-west monsoon in summer: during the north - oast monsoon the region surrounding Houng Kona is completely covered oy rain and mist. During'the south-west monsoon the Weather is fine in the above-mentioned region but there are storms in the evening in the mountains between Moung Kona and Mandalay ( we did not travel through this rgi on anci,. t his inf omati.on is f rom an indigenous source )» There is not much rain: three: inches of rain per month during the rainy season in Mandalay, but in the same latitude at Akyab it reaches six or seven inches in one night. D. Moans of Gommunlc a tion 1) It. is relatively easy to travel for six months in the year from Dien Bion Phu to Hanoi but the route is vary rough and difficult, for the ramining six months( from March to September ). This is d ue to the floods,arising from the clayey soil which being impermeable, drains all the water into the only places to which it can go. 2) Lur-ng praban g - Hanoi . Communication has become easy, thanks to the new road opened.This is a metalled road but as it is a recent one ( it was; not open when we came through) one should not count on it for at least a year. The time taken along this road by the col at Nape is about three or four days.3) OlianF, ^ai - Bvm gkok A railway goes three times a week between Chang Hai end Bangkok-duration ol the journey 48 hours. 4) Fandalay - Kieng Tung Pelatively easy and f* open all the year round in view of the small rainfall each - month. But road is very difficult and rough. A lot of traffic. This road recently opened, carries all the trade between South China and Upper Burma. E- Aeronautical Conclusions 1) It is very difficult to envisage the connecting up of Uandalay and Hanoi by a direct route 5 a) because the country does not offer any resources ( the population is not dense ); b) because it is quite impossible to think of a landing ground even in an emergency on this itinerary; except in two or three impracticable regions; in the case of forced landings in the best conditions in these regions an aeroplane landing even in a rice field without damage could not be salvaged in any case; c) because it would be impossible, even at a high price, to make landing grounds in view of the obstacles surrounding those places which seem suite ble at first sight, of the complete absence of means of transport of supolies - of the impossibility of reaching the passengers and the mail carried by an aeroplane which has made a forced landing and because in these regions Places are 30 to 4.0 days march away from each other at certain times of the year ; and d) because it is impossible in case of accident to help the sick or.wounded even a little because the slightest wound or sickness takes on proportions which, in view of the difficulties in communication, lead to very grave consequences. 2) The only way to make the route between Calcutta, and Hanoi shorter than it is at present is to make a detourmam to the south of the Mekong Tttver which is the only real i ,, ns of ponotrating into Upper Laos. We also stress the fact the t the Me Kong is not navigable above Ban Haonei Sai and the following considera tions should, besides, be taken into account; a) An extremely bad and trying climate which makes it difficult to think of posting in certain regions the Europeans necessaacy. for the functioning of the necessary meteorological stations etc,., which are absolutely necessary« b) Difficulty in finding the labour necessary for making the lending grounds. The Mandalay-Hanoi route can perhaps, be thought of either by the rfando lay-Luang P r a bang - Han o i route or by the Mandalay- Vientiane- Hanoi intinerary. There is a site .at Wong Pin, 107 kilos from Touri Guyi the- exact position of which is indicated in our route booko Another exists at Chueng Bsi in Siam which, could be made into an emergency landing ground ( very fine spot situated in a plain without obstacles). Another site at Luang Prabang which could very easily be made into a landing ground and could now be used.. The Luang Prabang region has not been examined and it would be useful to survey this route from the air. The detour by Luang Prabang or Vientiane presents great a dvantag e s:- 1) nearly all the time the route passes over civilised countries. 2) it would be possible to make forced landings which would not regularly have disastrous results. It must be noted finally that in the Calcutta- Phnoi route with detour to the south, it is absolutely necessary to have proper meteorologica l stations all along, the. route in the first place,, and* sc ccndly, the establishment of . telegraphic communication which is not at present in existencef On the other hr rid, it would ilso bo noc^sor ry request ' the Government of Indi^ ‘xicl of Burnr. to be so ‘kind as to install wireless andgoniometrica 1 stations in places which should be determined in accordance with the following- conditions: 1) the possibility of transporting nrtcrial in conditions of fdmissible security; 2) the possibility of providing the personnel and particularly the Europeans necessary for the purpose: 3) the establishment of. these stations in the pia ms.

Sir, ft I am directed, by the Secretary of State for Air to refer to previous correspondence concerning a proposal to investigate the practicability of establishing an air route to Hong Kong from Akyab or Rangoon via the Southern Shan States and French Indo-China. 2. As the. Secretary of State for India will be aware, this question was considered by the Interdepartmental Comjnittee on International Air Communications at its 24th Meeting held on the 6th May last, when it was recommended that a survey of the route in question should be carried out. 3. Lord Swinton has accordingly caused the opiestion of the proposed survey to be carefully studied in the Air Ministry, and advantage has been taken of the presence in this country recently of Mr. F. Tymms, Director of Civil Aviation in India, to discuss the matter with him. 4. As a result of the foregoing Lord Swinton novf has under active consideration the tentative proposals contained in the Memorandum forwarded herewith and is immediately concerned with the Preliminary Stages contained in sub-paras. (i) to (iii) part II thereof. 5. Subject to the conclusion of satisfactory arrange ments Lord Swinton would be prepared to send out a reconnais sance party, consisting of a Royal Air Force officer, a mem ber of the Civil Aviation Department, a Works and Buildings officer, and possibly would be able to arrange for a represen tative of Imperial Airways Limited to accompany the party. He would hope that the Government of India also would like to attach an officer. Under Secretary of State, India Office, King Charles Street, S.W.l. The6. Lord Swinton is advised that in order to enable the best sites for aerodromes and landing grounds to be most readily selected, both with reference to their local position and to their situation on the most favourable route, a reconnaissance from the air should be carried out in the first instance. 7. Provided the results of the preliminary air survey justify itj.. the,.next stage, as explained in the Memorandum, would ^ consist of an investigation on the ground by the party which, it j-' is suggested, should include a representative of the Burma PubIf Works Department (or of the Government of India Central Public Works Department). This would complete the survey stage and, subject to decision in the light of the survey, would be followed by the development of the landing grounds, as necessary, to a state when under dry weather .conditions experimental flights over the route could be made as the next stage. Finally, the landing grounds considered essential for the operation of the service would be improved up to an all-weather standard, and the permanent aids to navigation installed. 8. Accordingly, I am to request that, subject to the concurrence of the Marquess of Zetland, it may be ascertained from the Government of India whether they would be prepared to partici pate in and to make arrangements for such a survey, from the air and on the ground, as far as the Burmese frontier and, if so, whether they would be prepared to arrange subsequently for the preparation of landing grounds selected as a result of these investigations. 9. It would also be desirable to ask the Government of India for an estimate of the cost of the survey and what part of it they would themselves be prepared to defray. 10. I am to add that Lord Swinton hopes that in connection with this proposed survey it would be possible for the Government of India to incluae in the facilities desired, the full co-operation of the Departments concerned in the matters of wireless and meteorology.

V. Co-operation with French . The formal concurrence and active co-operation of the French Government to the project will be necessary so far as the French Indo china section of the route is concerned# A French Air Mission left Hanoi in March last to investigate certain landing ground sites on this route including, it is understood, Aungban, Taunggyi, Loilem, Keng Tung and Loikaw. No information regarding this investigation has yet come t to hand, but while the result of the French reconnaissance may have a direct bearing upon the route ultimately selected, as well as upon the ground organisation required; the investigation of landing grounds as far as the frontier of Burma should not on that account be delayed.4s Tel.

India Office. 1- Mr. Burkett explained t at the Interdepartmental Committee on International , ir Communications had at its 24th meeting in May list recommended that a survey should be undertaken to consider the practicability of establishing an air route to Hong ong via the Southern Shan »tates. This question had been considered in the Air Ministry, who hid been on the point of sending a letter and memorandum to the India office on the matter, asking them to seek the co-operation of the Government of Burma in the proposed survey. It hid, however, been learnt, before this letter was despatched, that the proposal to dispense with air reconnaissance in the first instance did n t quite accord with the views of O.c.A. India, f ncl T ' as th orefore considered desirable to take advantage of nr. Tymms' presence in this country to discuss the matter in some detail with him. landing gr unds to be most readily selected, both with Mr. Tymms pointed out thi t this reconnaissance by air was not so much intended to prove that the route was practicable, as to enable the best sites for terodromes , reference to their local position and tnelr situation on the most favourable route. The maps and information at present /available2 - available were not adequate f and previous experience in India had taught that time and money was saved if the landing grounds were investigated in the first instance by air and not merely from the ground* A ground pi rty would necessarily be restricted to examining a few sites not far from the highway, md might well miss more suitable sites in the v cinity* It seemed from the reports of Mr* Scott (Indian Forestry Service) that the best route would follow the line between Thazi and Reng Tung, where there was already a connection by road through Loilem, which is an administrative centre* S. Mr* Tyarns suggested that the first stage would be to establish one or two temporary landing grounds for the reconn. Issance aircr; ft to work from. There would be formed, he thought, a suitable piece near Thazl and there was a natural landing ground near Loilem, about 250 miles from kyab. The Government of India possessed an Avro X, operated for them by India National Airways, which would be suitable for the preliminary reconnaissance and could be hired for 200 rupees per hour, inclusive. 40 hours flying or so should suffice as only two preliminary flights should be necessary to select likely sites for investigation by the ground party. The cost would, therefore, be in the region of £1,000 for the tireraft* It was unlikely that Royal Air j oree aircraft could be used as there were none of exactly suitable type in India, anc the use of such types as were evailable would not be economical. 4. He made it clear, i owever, that although the Government of Indir would be prepared to help in the investigttion, they would not be ready to bear any of the cost, either of chartering the aircraft and arranging for the /expeditionmm i i mm expedition or of estaTalishing the landing grounds at a 1 ter stage. The Government of India regarded this as an Imperial project and in any case their own schemes for developing the main air routes were taking all the available money. Nor could the Government of Burma at thlr stage make any contribution towards the cost, although they were certainly interested in the route. 5. Squadron Leader Williams agreed tin t Mr. Tymms* explan? tion put the matter in a new light and he thought that the Air Staff would probably not wish to raise objections to the proposed preliminary air reconnaisstnce. 6. ing Commander lien suggested that an R.A.F. pack-set might be sent out to the temporary base from which the aircraft would wor . This would be of greater value than leaving the aircraft to maintain communication with one of tne permanent W/T stations. Intercommunication between the permanent W/T station and the base by 1end-line would be slow and difficult. As the route had never yet been flown, it would be advisable# in view of high mountains, to maintain wireless communication as much as possible. xperienee of working in this i rea would also be gained. Mr. Nichols thought that the total distance of the rjroposed route was such th? t nowadays aircraft should be able to fly over it without Hie necessity for a number of intermediate emergency landing grounds# but it was pointed out that the difficulties in the case of this route arose from the terrain and the meteorological conditions. If the landing ground in the mountains was in fog or mist the aircraft could not have sufficient fuel to fly back to its departure point. Tt was hoped that two flights should be enough to obtain the Information needed in this first stage. /a.•4- 8* As regards the letter and memorandum which the Air Ministry vas sending to the India Office, it was agreed that (a) It would he preferable to refer to the Government of India at present rather than to the Government of Burma. (b) In paragraph 6 of the letter to make arrangements for' should he substituted for ’’to organise u . (c) The Government of India should be invited to send an offic ?r on this air recoruu issance# (d) Para raphs 4, 5 and 6 of the letter would need modification as it was now contemplated that the survey should consist of five phases. First it would be necessary to prep, re temporary landing grounds near Thazi and Loilem as jumping off places. Secondly, there would be reconnaissance flights by an aircraft chartered from the Government of India, on board which should be the representatives of the Royal ir Force, the Civil Aviation Directorate, Imperial nirv/ays and possibly the Government of India. The third step would be a ground survey, the party for which would include the representatives mentioned above, a D.W.B. officer, and a representative of the Burma ublic works Department (or the Government of India Central P. ; .D) to investigate the suitability for development of the sites spotted from the air, to study the ground organisation required, and to prepare an estimate of its cost. This would complete the survey stage. Next would follow the preparation of these landing grounds up to an 11-weather stage, so that finally experimental flights over the route could be undertaken. /(e)*4 —5' (e) ] It would 'be desirable for the Government of India to be requested to arrange at all stages for the co-operation of the Departments concerned in the matter of wireless and meteorology# 9. Mr# Nichols raised the question whether there should be any consideration it this sttge of the finance of the full scheme. This was considered unnecessary t present as the survey was only to determine the practicability of the route. 10. Mr. Tymms pointed out that on the ground expedition it would perhaps be as well if the estimates of the cost of prept ring landing grounds etc. should be made by the representative of the Public works Department which would h ve to do the actual work of construction. The D. .B* Officer would give practical advice on the development of the sites. It was agreed that two landing grounds would probably be necessary» one near Loilem (if a site suitable in all weathers could be found), and one near the border of Indo-China. 11# It was finally agreed that the Air Ministry should revise their letter and memorandum to the India Office in the light of the suggestions made, so that it could be ascertained as soon as possible from the Government of India whether they would be willing to co-operate in the scheme, and, if so, wlr t would be the probable cost of the survey, as Treasury concurrence would then have to be obtained before arrangements could be carried further.You asked the other day whether the Air Ministry had ^ret written to us about the exploration of the oouthern Snan Route on which the Warren Fisher committee smiled when it mentioned by India some months ago. We have not yat had any proposal from them on tne subject yet. I wrote reminding them just before I went away and they replied that they were drawing up a plan. I have now asked again and find that the’ plan is being vetted by the Air Force side of the ministry. As it is now three months since we heard of the idea from bir -c I\oyce I suggested tnat that the Air Ministry might suitably send us some sort of a^ letter saying that the C.A. Committee were interested and that they intended to make proposals for a reconnaissance. /) 1 / 7/36hhhhhhbhhhhhhhhhhhii * 005Tf (5? 479iV f '0B/S7) No. 412 (30/73/1936) Ills \a jeety # s Charge d* affaires, Peking, presents his coHpllmentw to His Majesty’s Principal ' secretary of State for foreign Affairs and transmits herewith original and two oo dee of the undermentioned paper Peking, $0ih .pril, 1936. deference to previous despatch! despatch to Foreign Office Flo. 94 of £3.1.1936.

Cadogan’s despatch No. 94 [of 25rd January: application by Eurasia Aviation Corporation for permission to operate air service to Rangoon]. After careful consideration it has been decided that permission cannot be granted to Eurasia Aviation Corporation to extend their service from Yunnanfu to Rangoon. For your information principal objections to service are (a) physical disadvantages of the route; (b) undesirability of granting facilities to a Chinese company when reciprocity cannot be obtained; (c) danger that Lufthansa would attempt to link proposed service with Europe and thus compete with Imperial Airways’ Far Eastern route; (d) intention of His Majesty’s Crovernment to develop, if practicable, a British service from Rangoon to Hongkong via the Chan States. If, therefore, you receive formal application on behalf of Eurasia company, you are authorised to state that His Majesty’s Government and the Government ol India regret they are unable to accord permission for such a service. You may however hold out to the company the possibility that they mig i be allowed to make a connexion with Imperial Airways service- at Hongkong. You should not actually invite them to do so until the China National Airways and Pan-American Airways ha/ finally established services to Hongkong, since presence of Eurasia in Hongkong might make the use of that port appear le, valuable to the former companies. For your information, His Majesty s Government have re ? jected proposals of Siamese Government for British service v-‘ Bangkok to Hongkong, and propose to continue operation via Penang. In the meantime steps will be taken as soon as &gt; possible to survey the direct route from Calcutta to■ Hanoi via Shan States./ / / c.^Aj tJXp ^ ^ &amp;&amp; u, tfc« (1 .Lu . t~/te 'tffcZ fc &lt;~ij^-J~ (2J&lt;? tWjLS\m* o ko k • 3 ' • „ Secretary (Polit Departmeniy , i^i. Sir Cecil Kisch. '6 n There are several threads in this skein ana the papers are becoming somewhat voluminous. It has been suggested by Pekin that permission might be given to Eurasia, the German-Chinese Plying Company, to fly to Burma or India via Yunnan. India's views on this were given in a telegram of the 26th March. They disapproved, and expressed views favouring the route over the Southern Shan States into Indo-China if it were desired to fly east by land from Burma. A further complication arose from a proposed flight from Bhamo to Tenguyeh which was sponsored by the Consul in Tenguyeh. All of these matters are mixed up with the matter of connecting Hongkong with the Empire air route. The obvious route through Siam is blocked by difficulties with the Siamese, and alternatives are consequently sought. All these matters were discussed at a meeting at the Air Ministry last week, most of them very briefly. The&amp; 2 . Air Ministry are definitely opposed to facilities for Eurasia to fly into Burma, but wish to offer them a junction at Hongkong. So far as I can gather they have no enthusiasm for the proposed flight to Tenguyeh. As regards the Southern Shan route they are ^apqrqcfed to some extent though not as much as the Post Office. The reason for their comparatively moderate enthusiasm is that everything nowadays is for flying boats and Imperial Airways (who were present at the meeting) are now flying and hope to an alternative route to Hongkong, taking the main line at Penang and thus flying around two sides of an equilateral triangle and over a very considerable amount of the South China Sea. Nevertheless when fche|r realised that the French were exploring the Southern Shan route from the Indo-China end. Colonel Shelmerdine agreed that the matter was one to be explored. The Post Office are particularly anxious fo r a shorter route to Hongkong than that via Penang, because the Russian routes to the Far East have oeen greatly accelerated and leave little advantage for our present flying times.3 . Colonel Shelmerdine has written to Sir Cecil Kisch, ^ acknowledging the two telegrams sent him and undertaking to circulate a note to the Warren Fisher Committee. Until that is done there seems no occasion for us to take any further action but it does seem to be of some practical value that His Majesty's Government and the Government of India should co-operate in the exploration of the Southern Shan route, and that the interests of the Air Ministry in this matter should be stimulated whenever possible. •' 2 5 6 P C$&gt; Eu\-ciT.u C' V.5V «v CX'9-0&gt;Dear Kisch, In reply to your letter (No. E. &amp; 0. 2145/56) of 2nd April concerning the proposed air route between Shanghai and Burma to be operated by the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, I am enclosing copy of the letter dated 4th December, 1955 and enclosures, which were received from Tymms on this question. I note that Noyce's telegram is hostile to the Eurasia project and we share this view. It might be wise, however, to give Eurasia permission to use Hong Kong. This would probably present further applications from that Company to fly to Calcutta or Rangoon. I do not think, however, that we should offer them the use of Hong Kong until the arrangements with Pan American Airways and China National Airways have been completed, as the two Chinese companies are in competition and the advent there of this Sino-G-erman concern before China National becomes well established might prove unfortun ate. fe are proposing to investigate closely the possibility of the Southern Shan route from Burma to Hanoi, in view of the present impasse with the Siamese- and w e shall be circulating shortly a note on the Eurasian project for consideration at' the next meeting of the Warren Fisher Committee. Sir Cecil Kisch, K.C.I.E., C B India Office. Whitehall/ S.W.l. Yours sincerely.COPY. Director of Civil Aviation in India Department of Industries &amp; Labour. D.O.No.T.61. New Delhi, the 4 th Dec. 19^^ Direct air route to China My dear Shelmerdine, I have delayed replying to your letter 409089/35 dated 11 th October until I had had an opportunity of consulting Scott (C.W. Scott, Forest Service), whom you probably know but in any case will know of as one of the most knowledgeable man on this subject of the eastern part of Burma, particularly in relation to aviation. subject when I was in London, but I will recapitulate briefly. The question first arose in connection with your negotiations with the Deutsche Lufthansa on behalf of the Eurasia Corporation, when they proposed to run services through Yunnan Fu to connect with Imperial Airways at Rangoon. Copies of despatches were sent to us for information. We had already been mildly interested in the possibility for the future, as a result of a suggestion by Mitchell. We then proposed that an effort should be made to investigate one part of the region involved during the operations of the Boundary Commis sion which is operating this winter. It proved impracticable to arrange for the addition of an air officer for this purpose. We decided, therefore, to continue to take an interest in the problem and collect information as and when opportunity offered. To this end I consulted Scott and we asked the Consul General of Yunnan Fu and the Consul at Tengyueh to let us have their views. I enclose for your information copies of the following: (1) Note by C.W. Scott dated 9 th March 1935 . (2) Report from the Consul-General Yunnanfu dated 19 th August, 1935 . ( 3 ) Report from the Consul Tengyueh dated 2 nd August,1935- (Ij.) Note by C.W. Scott, dated 23 rd November. Having occasion to write to Wronsky during the summer. I mentioned his plan and said that I was very interested in it as a technical proposal. This called forth a reply of which I enclose an extract, Wronsky professes not to understand the reason why they were not given permission to fly through. Incidentally I might note that I did not offer to help him - I explained to you briefly what was happening on this Lt.-Col.F.C.Shelmerdine, C.I.E.,O.B.E., Air Ministry, Gwydyr House, Whitehall, London, S.W.l. /I- 2 - (z zs j I merely asked for information. When I was in Berlin, Wronsky was away, but I had talks with Haensel, the D.L.H. Foreign Manager. I think he clearly understood that one of the conditions of the grant of permission for the operation of a German-Chinese service across the frontier into Burma would be a reciprocal concession for a British or Indian company in China. He freely admitted that the Lufthansa are unable to influence the Chinese Government in this matter, and the Chinese Government in their turn are afraid to grant a concession because of the reaction on their relations with Japan. We asked for the view of the Burma Government on this proposal and they are opposed to it for political reasons connected with the administration of the frontier States. You will remember that the Government of India have not been asked by H.M.G. for their views, so the Burma Government^ opinion was sought purely for our own information. Apart from the political difficulty of operation from Burma direct into China in the region of Yunnanfu, I doubt if it would be technically impracticable or even extremely difficult to operate such a service with modern aircraft. It is quite clear however, and the reports from the tv/o Consuls bear this out, that there are greater topographical difficulties in the north than would be encountered further south - a natural result of the rising altitude of the country. Scott T s note on the Southern Shan States is most encouraging. From this I would not expect any great difficulty, either in establishing the ground organization required or in operating a service direct from Burma into French Indo China as you suggest. So far as I remember, the French have established quite a number of landing grounds throughout Tongking, and if their aerodromes are of suitable standard, probably nothing new would be required on that side of the frontier. For refuelling purposes we would really only want a couple of landing grounds between Akyab and Hanoi, one of which would be in Burma, possibly in the neigh bourhood of the Mandalay Railway, and the other in French territory. Scott f s report shows that emergency landing grounds could probably be prepared without great difficulty in the Southern Shan States. We have also a very cheap scheme for a landing ground at Magwe which, however, has had to be sacrificed for the time being. I would certainly recommend that the route should cross the Arakan Yomas somewhere round Akyab. North of this it is not impossible, but the mountain zone is broader and the peaks generally high. Scott, in his note, suggests certain definite lines of investigation, and I am following this up with particular reference to the places in the Southern Shan States. The provision of landing grounds at Thazi on the Mandalay Railway and at Mandalay, in what may be called normal country, is a comparatively ordinary proposal which can wait till later. I will ask Nornand to study the climatology of the region as well. As to what you can do at your end, I suppose you are quite optimistic with regard to the political difficulties with Indo-Ghina. Without looking at the book, I seem to recollect that your arrangements there are fairly easy and it would only be a question of whether the French would agree to an air route crossing their north-west frontier. I am not sure whether I can dig out much information about the air organization in Tongking, but I am sure you have full information in the Air Ministry and could have a route report for this compiled. At the moment I cannot think of anything more specific, but you will no doubt get your own ideas now that I have given you the history from this end. /iI should make it clear that we have interested ourselves in this question purely from a general point of view. There is no intention, either immediate or remote, of spending money on the organization of this route. Being part of the route to China, however, I suppose if H.M.G. attach sufficient importance to it, they would take the question up with the Government of India and would no doubt find a solution to the financial end of the problem. Yours sincerely, (Signed)Notes on the Galcutta-Mandalay-Hongkong air route. (Mr. C. W. Scott, Indian Forest Service) 1. Calcutta and Hong Kong are on approximately the same parallel of latitude near the Tropic of Cancer. Mandalay is about 50 miles south of this parallel, a negligible angular diversion on a long route. Lashic, the rail head of north-east Burma, is practically on the Calcutta-Hongkong parallel. At Lashio there is an excellent emergency landing ground already in existence and capable of development as a good commercial aerodrome. The important Burma Corporation silver and lead mines at Namtu are close to Lashio and it is adjacent to the Wa States where further mines exist. 2. High ground and rainfall affect the suitability of the direct air line from Calcutta to Hongkong. Betvfeen Chittagong (which is practically on the direct air line) and Mandalay there are some 120 miles of extremely wild country, the Chin hills, reaching 7000 to 10,000 feet. By edging south from Calcutta and striking Akyab, about 150 miles south of Chittagong, the hilly strip between the Indian Ocean and Mandalay can be reduced to about 50 miles and the maximum land height to about 5000 feet. 3. East of Mandalay the ground is fairly broken but relatively mild to the China Frontier anywhere near Lashio, and for some distance north of Mandalay-Lashio direct line, e.g. at Kutkai (where there is a poor but possible emergency landing ground and much open downland at about 3000-6000 ft) and Namkhan where the Shweli River enters Burma from China. Going north of Namkhan, by Bhamo and onwards the country is higher, more broken and much more wooded, especially round Bhamo itself and the Irrawaddy valley. 4. The section of the undemarcated frontier between Burma and China, running through the Wa States, lies east of Lashio. The direct air line from Lashio to Hong Kong would cross this section but a direct line from Lashio to Yunanfu would pass north of the disputed area. 5. Mandalay is practically in the centre of the Burma dry zone, with only some 30” of rain per annum, against 100 ” in Rangoon and. still more at Akyab. Lashio also has only a moderate rainfall, but being higher has much more cloud than Mandalay during the monsoon (mid-May to mid-October). Even In the monsoon, however, the chances of easy flying conditions would be much better at Mandalay than at Rangoon and probably better at lashio than Bhamo. North of Lashio the rainfall increases rapidly and by Myitkyina is very heavy. 6 . East of the Burma frontier the conditions are unknown to the writer but the maps indicate a maximum height of only about 7000 ft. and a fAirly easy approach to Hongkong down the Si-Kiang River in Kwang-Si province. 7. The direct air line from Lashio to Hongkong passes near the China-Tongking frontier and crosses the Hanoi-Yunanfu railway. From Lashio to Hongkong via Yunanfu would entail an appreciable northerly diversion of about 150 miles. 8 . Chittagong, Akyab and Mandalay are all suitable for flying boats. Even at Bhamo the Irrawaddy River is possibly suitable for commercial flying boats but much less so than at Mandalay. There are lakes and rivers on the China side which seem to offer possibilities.H 2 9. As regards aerodrome^ Lashio is roughly 130 miles from Mandalay and Maymyo about 30 from Mandalay. Lashio already has an excellent all weather landing ground, well drained. There are good cheap sites at Maymyo and Mandalay and both places require aerodromes, Maymyo as the Govt, capital and Mandalay as the commercial Capital of Upper Burma. Maymyo is 3500 ft. and Mandalay is practically at sea level. For heavily loaded commercial craft, Mandalay seems preferable as a primary site and there would probably be less trouble there with clouds in the monsoon, though ground mists might give trouble in the dry season. 10. A rainfall map of Burma is practically a target with Mandalay as the Bullseye (minimum rainfall) and concentric circles of increasing rainfall centring on Mandalay. An emergency landing ground in south central Burma, near Thayetmyo, about 160 miles SS3 of Akyab, could be made cheaply and might be a good haven for machines bound for Rangoon, striking extremely bad monsoon weather and possibly suffering from failure of wireless. The rainfall is 3-ow at Thayetmyo and location easy by the Irrawaddy River. Visibility must often be good there when it is extremely bad further south. (sgd) C'.W .SCOTT, Delhi. 9.3 .35. Indian Forest Service.Confidential* Copy of a letter No. dated the 19th August 1935, irom His Majesty's Consul-General Yunnanfu, to the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. With reference to your letter to His Majesty’s Consul at Tengyueh Confidential No. D.3515-X/35 of the 16th July of this year on the subject of a suggested Calcutta-HongKong air route via this Chinese province and to Mr. Toller’s reply of the 2nd August, I have the honour to transmit the following observations. 1. So far as is known here the willingness of the Chinese Government to see the inauguration by a nominally Chinese sub-company of the German Lufthansa of a trans-Yunnan service has not led to any 'intensive study' of the possibility of linking Burma with China by air so far as the portion of the route lying over this province is concerned. The only aerodrome in this province practicable for heavy machines is that near this city. 2. I feel sure that if the Chinese were to accord to a Sino- British company the right to fly over this province they would insist on Yunnanfu being one of the stopping places. 3. For seaplanes I know of no lakes or rivers suitable even for emergency landings on any Calcutta-Hongkong flying route passing through this province east of the lake adjoining Hsiakwan Talifu save that near this city. Rivers are all too shallow or turbulent. 4. For land planes there should be no difficulty in providing necessary aerodromes in addition to that existing here and I understand that suitable places for forced landings could generally be found as far as the border of this province, 100 miles east of Yunnanfu. If, however, it were desired to fly south-east from this place to Hongkong via Tiuchow Fu in Kwangsi province, the next place where an aerodrome of sufficient size exists, a plane would for 250 miles have to pass over country where a forced landing would inevitably damage the under carriage and would necessitate the plane being taken to pieces and carried away on mule back. This information was given to me some months ago by Captain Jones-Evans of the Far Eastern Aviation Company who has more than once flown over the route in question. Possibly a better route might be found by making a diversion via Huang Ts’ao Pa and Hing-yi in Kweichow province. In any case it would be necessary to fly over mountains 9000 feet high. 5. As bearing on the question of flying at all seasons in this part of China I would mention that the Chungking-Kweiyand-Yunnanfu mail plane has for five successive v/eeks during the (this year some what nominal) rainy season succeeded in making its weekly flight to this place and back again. The practicability of such regular flights was strongly doubted by Captain Jones-Evans and perhaps it is still too early to say whether they can be regularly counted on. On this route too there are 9000 feet mountains to be crossed. 6 . I understand that the Chinese Government is unwilling to grant to any non-Chinese company the right to fly over Chinese territory owing to the fact that if they do so they will be compelled to grant similar rights to the Japanese.■■■ mm COPY. Confidential. Copy to Peiping. No. 17 Burma Yunnanfu. British Consulate. Tengyueh. August 2nd, 1935. Sir, With reference to your letter No. D.3515-X/35 of the 16th ultimo, I have the honour to state that such personal knowledge as I possess of Yunnan is confined to the western portion of the province. I am therefore sending a copy of your letter and of this reply to His Majesty 1 s Consul-General at Yunnanfu for any information with which he may he able to furnish you regarding the remaining area. Copies are also being sent to His Majesty 1 s Ambassador at Peiping and to the Chief Secretary to the Government of Burma. 2. As regards the two suggested routes, I ?/ould observe that, in view of the close commercial connection between Tengyueh and Burma, it appears almost essential that this town should be included in the proposed service; a call at Tengyueh may also be necessary for customs purposes as there is a Customs House here. The route via Bharno and Tengyueh would, however, be more difficult than that by way of Lashio and the Namting valley, as it would involve crossing the valleys of the Shweli and Salween, and the Shweli-Salween Divide, in addition to the | Mekong. The Divide rises, in its highest parts to over 12,000 feet; the valleys of the Shweli and Salween are comparatively narrow defiles, about 2000 feet deep, and would, I imagine cause difficult air conditions. Prom the commercial standpoint it would also be essential to include in the route Hsiakuan (Talifu), the entrepot of Western Yunnan. 3. The northern undelirnited frontier starts at 25 15* North; an air line from Bhamo to Tengyueh would inevitably cross within the demarcated section, as would also that from Lashio via the Namting valley. The air line from Bhamo to Tengyueh would be about 100 miles and would not appear to present any great difficulties. It would follow the valley of the Taiping river which is, for a great part of the China Section, a lacustrine plain devoted to paddy cultivation. There are however several expanses of level turf v/hich it might be possible to utilise as emergency landing grounds. A nominal landing ground is in existence at Tengyueh, but it is extremely liable to be waterlogged, being simply a piece of reclaimed paddy land, and could not be relied upon, nor would it be necessary to do so as in the immediate vicinity of the town there are numerous stretches of downland v/hich would seem to have been designed by nature for the sites of aerodromes. There is also a lake, about j mile square, some ten miles north of the town. The average annual rainfall of Tengyueh is about 60”, the bulk falling in the monsoon season. 4. So far as my observation has gone, no landing ground could be found between Tengyueh and Paoshan (Yungchang). The Shweli and Salween rivers, as also the Mekong, would appear to be unsuitable even for emergency landings. The current is apparently less strong than in the Upper Yangtze, where amphibians regularly land, but the streams are narrow and situated at the bottom of deep defiles, and are liberally strewn with rocks and snags. The river valleys are very sparsely populated and, even if a minute survey should reveal a suitable stretch of water, there would be no shore facilities. At Paoshan itself there is a large paddy plain, and emergency landing grounds could probably be found among the foothills. 5. I regret that I have no personal knowledge of the Namting valley line. Information that might be useful may be found in Major Davies 1 ”Yunnan: the link between India and Yangtze” (Cambridge m awl- 2 - University Press, 1909); Tengyueli-Talifu Railway Survey. 1907 (Government Branch Press, Maymyo); and the Report on the Tengyueh- Bhamo Railway Project (Government Press, Burma). I have the honour to he. Sir, Your obedient servant, Sd. Illegible. Consul. The Deputy Secretary to the Govt, of India, F &amp; P. Dept., Simla.p G Q P Y &gt; Further note on the Calcutta-Mandalay-Hongkong air route-J By G.W. Scott, R.A.F. 1915-19, I.F.S. Burma 1919-34 1. Further to the previous note, dated 9.3.35 some additional information and suggestions are below more particularly with reference to comments on the first notes and the reports by the British Consul at Tengyueh and Consul General at Yunnanfu, dated 2.8.35 and 19.8.35. 2. The facts given in the note of 9.3.35 are correct and easy to verify. Where mere opinions or guesses have been put forward, they have been clearly labelled. 3. The first reports of the difficulty of the country at Lashio and east of it, from the point of view of aircraft, were in correct. There is a good landing ground at Lashio, there are emergency landing grounds at Kutkai and elsewhere, and the open downland in large parts of the Shan States, particularly the southern S.S. makes further aerodromes easy, for example at Loilera, a Military Police Station, 150 miles S. of Lashio and 120 miles S.E. of Mandalay, on the motor road to Kengtung, the most easterly salient of Burma. Kengtung town is about 130 miles east of Loilem and 70 miles west of the French frontier on the Mekong. There is a military Police Station near Kengtung, at Loimwe. 4. The heat haze of January to May in the Shan States would be an obstacle to air photography and mapping, as it was to the air surveys of the Irrawaddy Delta and Tenaserim in 1923-25. It would be no obstacle to a transport service by air. 5. The average rainfall of the Shan States is much less than that of the Burma coast or the area round Bhamo. The higher average altitude of Shan States aerodromes, however, might give trouble, owing to clouds and mist reaching to the ground. That is a point on which information can be got from the officers now in the Shan States, either at once or within one year, prefer ably from ex-pilots of whom there are possibly some in service /therem HMH ■HE iai 2 . there. An aerodrome on the low level of Mandalay or Thazi (the railway junction for the Southern Shan States about 75 miles S. of Mandalay) would be free from this altitude objection but somewhat further for a hop into China or French Indo-China. 6 . The present Boundary Commission is operating only in the dry season and over a relatively small range of country. An observer attached to it would not help greatly with the major problems of an air route to HongKong. 7. The consular reports from Tengyueh and Yunnanfu are useful but perhaps attach too much importance to the idea of local traffic and interests, and short stages. Unless political considerations dictated halts at those towns it would appear unnecessary to stop there. A good modern medium or long range machine on a China- Europe service could well fly from an aerodrome in Burma, say at Mandalay, Thazi, Loilem or Kengtung, to Hanoi non-stop, without crossing Chinese territory, or to a Chinese aerodrome far east of Yunnanfu, if permission were given. Lashio is too far north if the service is to avoid crossing China. 8 . The consular reports from Yunnan speak of 9000* ranges in the Yunnanfu area and 12,000* ranges further north in the Tengyueh area, indicating an increase of obstacles northward,parallel to that in Burma, as between Mandalay-Lashio and Thazi-Loilem to the south and Bhamo to the north. The 60 u rainfall reported from Tengyueh is of medium severity, corresponding to that in the Pyinmana - Toungoo zone of Burma, and much heavier than at Mandalay or Thazi. The indications are rather adverse for seaplanes and better for land planes. The stretch of difficult country for 250 miles south-east of Yunnanfu, mentioned by the Consul-General is probably no worse than the Sundarbans, Bay of Bengal and Arakan Yomas, now being traversed weekly by three air services. 9. It is suggested, (1) That aerodrome sites should be prospected at Mandalay, Thazi, Loilem, and Kengtung or Loimwe. (2) That weather observations should be made at those places /and5 and Lasliio, particularly on flooding and low cloud or mist, preferably by ex-pilots, especially during the monsoon. (3) That suitable aerodromes or sites should be investigated in China and French Indo-China within range of planes flying from the places in Burma mentioned above. Sd. C.W. Scott. 23.11.33.

Dear Tymms, * * * As to the first part of your letter, I may say that it would be quite indifferent to us - or rather to the Cerman- Chinese company 'Eurasia' - to connect either at Rangoon or at Calcutta. But unfortunately our plans have not met with the approval of Imperial Airways Ltd. for reasons which I am at a loss to understand. The situation is this, that for the time being the Chinese Government does not want to allow any country to fly into its territory as then Japan could not be kept out. I had proposed to make, as long as this situation prevailed, a provisional arrangement providing for the 'Eurasia' to carry the mails to Calcutta or Rangoon, while Imperial Airways should for the time of this arrangement renounce to reciprocity. I know that this would have meant some sort of a sacrifice for England, yet it would have been better than nothing at all. Now the mails are forwarded by steamer and no air company has any profit. I am afraid that even you will not be able to be of much help in this matter. Major P. Tymms, The Priory, Simla, India. Yours sincerely, Sd. Wronsky.No • 18 (29.5.35) Confidantial. BRITISH LEGATION, Bangkok. 12th January, 1935. Sir, With reference to my very confidential despatch No. 17 of the 9th instant, I have the honour to report that M. Maugras, the French Minister, called upon me a day or two ago and, among other topics, broached the subject of civil aviation with me. He enquired what arrangement we had made with the Siamese for our service to Singapore. I told him that there was no arrangement - nothing beyond a provisional and indeterminate understanding - and that no agreement was likely to be concluded until we had settled the question of connection by air between the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. M. Maugras then spoke of the proposed shuttle line which n Air France ,, wishes to establish between Bangkok and Hanoi via Korat, Khon Ken (in the former province of Udorn) and Vientiane. He said that the Siamese would only accord permission for this service on a provisional basis, their authority for it being subject to withdrawal after notice, and he seemed not a little disgruntled by the fact. He expressed his satisfaction that Messrs. Imperial Airways should have at least succeeded in getting the French to allow their machines to make the journey from Paris to Marseilles over French territory on the way to the Far East, and he had apparently heard something of the proposal of Imperial Airways to get to Hong Kong via the Strait of Hainan, utilising the French aerodromes at Moncay and Fort Bayard and thus avoiding Chinese territory and territorial waters. He thought the idea a good one, and only wished that Imperial. Airways and n Air France” would both of them decide to push through to Hong Kong via Rangoon, Mandalay and the British Shan States, thereby leaving out the Siamese link no less than the Chinese one. It would serve the Siamese right he said, for their obstructive attitude, and he did not believe they would dare to retaliate by stopping the services to Singapore and Saigon vai Bangkok which are already in being. I replied that I had seen something of the Southern Shan States when I was a young man, and that the country was very mountainous and difficult. M. Maugras answered that the idea was at any rate worth considering; we looked at a map together, and he pointed out that Mandalay was practically in a direct line with Hanoi. If his idea proved to be practicable, Rangoon, and not Bangkok, would be the point of bifurcation for the English services to Hong Kong and Singapore and for the French services to Hanoi (Hong Kong) and Saigon. 2. During his conversation with me M. Maugras was full of the spirit of co-operation, but I imagine that he was talking purely on his own account and not in accordance with any instructions that he had received. I have the honour to be, With the highest respect Sir Your most obedient, humble servant. Sd. J. Crosby.

Sir* With reference to the final paragraph of my despatch JL 10 of the 14th instant (49 / S9/36) jl I have the honour to report that I saw Prince Var rvaidya yesterday and enquired from him as to the precise meaning of article S of the proposed new agreement b 3 tween the French and Siamese Governments concerning aviation. 2. After refreshing his memory, the Prince explained that this Memorandum had been actually submitted to the \ v m h Legation in Bangkok well over, a year ago, but had el *.i t ; reply at the time* It had been drawn up by Mr* Stevens, the late Adviser in Foreign Affairs, when the agreement concluded with the French by Pr: nee Purachatra had n t ye. been denounced and when it was • bought that that unfortunai convention might be modified ra‘her than abrogated,. Since then the convention had been denounced and it world eaae to be valid at the end of the piesent month. In the meantime, the Siamese were pressing the Fi ench for an answer on the i subject of the new proposals drafted by Mr* Stevens. The Prince thanked me for drawing hla attention to the anomaly presented by the wording of article 9 of these proposals., The 'present Agreement' referred to therein was, he a- V the Purachatra agreement, whilst the 'supplementary Agreement was the one prepared by Mr. Stevens, The denunciation of The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, P.C., M.C., M.P., etc,, etc,, etcthe former instrument rendered erticle 9 of the latter meaningless and, in the fresh peot to he concluded with the French^ it would have to he altered so as to make it clear that the newer Agreement was alcne in question, I asked the Prince whether the draft agreement which he had shew to me, if accepted by the French# would represent the sum total of the obligations of the Siamese towards them. I was careful to put the question to him twice, and in each case he answered in the affirmative. I have, etc., (Sd) c. CROSBY.

You- will no doubf/take this into consideration in any proposal you may put before the Civil Aviation Committee in either connexion.

It would seem a matter on which H.M.G. might be prepared to spend a little money on survey. The route from Rangoon to Hongkong by Kengtung is barely half as long as that by which the present service is going via Penang and Saigon, and the latter has the additional drawback of very long stretches over the sea. Perhaps you would think it worth while to discuss the matter with Sir F Shelmerdene with a view to some proposition being put before the C.A.Committee. In any case there seems enough in the telegram to justify a decision to turn the Eurasia proposal down, as the Air Ministry have always done hitherto. It is disquieting, if not surprising, to find that the Director of Civil Aviation in India has been sending ^ apparently considerable amounts of information on the subject direct to the Air Ministry. It ought to be made clg clear that if matters of this kind which have a political bearing, are discussed direct the 1.0. should be kept informed. Much the same applies in regard to the French survey, and indeed to the whole matter, India ought to i keep us much better informed. I doubt however if there is much to be done about it. 1212 5000 0/32.'•N The Governments of Burma and India seem right in their view that a foreign air service over the Burma- Yunnan frontier should be opposed for the reasons they state. 1 doubt whether there is very much in the consideration advanced in paragraph 4 of Peking Despatch of 23rd January. The air service would no doubt give the Nanking Government greater control over thevv avr authorities ija Yunnanfu and Tengyueh, but I think our difficulties in respect of the administrative arrangements on the Chinese side of the frontier arise out of the pooif control which the authorities at Tengyueh and Yunnanfu exercise over their frontier districts, and I do not see how an air service is going to remedy this. It is therefore agreed that the offer of the Eurasia Company be refused. The Political Department agree with the Government of India that the same political objections do not arise in respect of an air service between Burma and Indo china direct. The Civil Aviation Department of the Government of India should surely send us copies of their correspondence with other Whitehall Departments (andadso indeed British Representatives outside India) which deal with matters of a political nature.

Walter, the Technical Manager of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, called at this office and lunched with me to-day. 2. He informed me that the Minister of Communications had granted a franchise to this Company to operate an air service between SHAWOHAI and TUHNAH via MHCHANG, CHAKOSHA and EWKIYAHC, and trial flights will probably conmence next week. He admitted that this proposed internal service was not likely to be successful from the financial aspect, but said that hopes were entertained of it being possible to extend the route, either to CALCUTTA or RANG ON and to link up with Imperial Airways. 3. He begi ed me to do everything possible to secure His Excellency, The Hon. 81r Alexander h.G. Gadogan,K.C.M.G., C.B., His Britannic Majesty 1 s Ambassador, British Kitfesssy, the/ Peiping■i the necessary permiaslort to fly over IBIMA and IKDIA and said that he anticipated that the Chinee® Government would shortly rescind the prohibition whereby foreign aviation operating congjiniea are debarred fro-'-.- flying over Chinese territory, e®peelally as pressure la being brought to bear by the Japanese for the eatabllfthaent of air routes in CHIBA* 4. He submitted that, in the event of the Chinese Government giving way on this point, the Eurasia Aviation Corporation would be prepared to operate the pronosed service on a **fifty-fifty* bnele with imperial Airway® which would thus permit of Imperial Airway® being able to extend to SHAR0HAI. 6. He also informed me that there seemed to be little prospect of establiehing the projected route via H/vMX, UHUifTOHl and TCHuKUCHAK and it was Ibr this reason that the Company was anxious to obtain facilities for connection with the Imperial Airway® service to 6. there was, he said, considerable competition between the Kura©la and the China National Aviation Corporation©, and added that an agreement between the Eurasia Aviation Corporation and Imperial Airway®, having the sponsor©nip of the Central Government» would be eminently desirable in the interest® of both Companies, more especially sine© connection© will shortly be made at HAKOI between the China national Aviation Corporation and rt Air France* 1 . 7.

Department, Simla. ^ - With reference to your letter to His Majesty’s Consul at tengyueh Confidential No.D*3515-X/35 of the 16th July of this year on the suhjeet of a suggested Caleutta- Hongkong air route via this Chinese province and to Mr. Toller’s reply of the 2nd August, I have the honour to trsuasi mit the following observations. 1* So far as is knovat here the willingness of the Chinese Government to se« the inauguration by a nominally Chinese sub-company of the Cirtm**?* Lufthane; of a trane- Yunnan serviee has not led to any ”intensive study” of the possibility of linking Burma with China by air so far as the portion of the route lying over this province is @on- cerned. The only aerodrome in this provine® practicable for heavy maehines is that near this eity. 2« I feel sure that if the Chinese were to accord to a Sino-British company the right to fly over this province they would insist on Yunnanfu being one of the stopping places. 3* F6r sea-planes I know of no lakes or rivers suitable even for emergency landings on any Calcuttn- Hongkong flying route passing through thi^province east of the lake adjoining Hsiakwan T©,lifu save that near this city. Pivers are all too shallow or turbulent. 4# For land planes there should be no difficulty in providing necessary aerodromes in addition to that existing here and I understand that suitable places for fore* f . . - j ,Pw I of this provinse, 100 miles east of Yunnarifu. If, bo it were desired to fly south-easi, from this place to Hongkong via Tiushow Fu in Kwangsi province» the next place where an aerodrome of sufficient size exists, a plane would for 250 miles have to passover country where a forced landing would inevitably damage the under-carriage and would necessitate the plane being taken to piece© and carried away on mule back. This information was given to ? re some months ago by Captain Jones-IS vans of the Far Eastern Aviation Company who has more than once flown over the route in question. Possibly a better route might be found by making a diversion via Huang Te’ao Pa and Hing-yi in Kweichow province. In any case it would be necessary to fly over mountains 9,000 fe«t high. 5. As bearing on the question of flying at all seasons in this part of China I would mention that the Cbungking- Kweiyang-Yunn&amp;afu mail plana has for five successive weeks during the (this year somewrat nominal) rainy season succeeded in making its weekly flight to this place and back again. The practicability of such regular flights was strongly doubted by Captain Jones-Ev&amp;ns and perhaps it is still too early to say whether they ©an be regularly counted on. On this route too there are 9,000 feet mountain to be crossed. 6. I understand that the Chinese Government is un willing to grant to any non-Chinese company the right to fly over Chinese territory owing to the fast that if they do so they will be compelled to grant similar rights to the Japanese.2956 6000 7/34 Minute Paper. ^ Li Department. 1 E. &amp; 0.

Sir, I have the honour to submit to your Excellency the following report of a conversation which took place to-day between Flight Lieutenant G. Bartholomew, and Herr Starte, of the Sura Bis flviatlon Corporation, on the subject of certain reports which have recently appeared in the Chinese press. 2. It was confirmed by Herr Btarte that the service between CKANGUHO! and CANTON on the PEIPING - HANKOW - CANTON at route, will be discontinued temporarily, owing, it was stated, to floods in the region of H NKOW; in the meantime a service on the HSIPING - CHENGCHOW section will be maintained. It seems likely that lack of patronage (see my despatch No. 54 dated 26th June, 1935) and shortage of machines may also have been deciding factors, but Herr Starte emphasised that the service will eventually be re-opened. 3. The Ministry of Communications haa asked the Euraeia Aviation Corporation to open a branch air line from 8IANFU to CHENGTU. Herr Starte anticipated that the new His Excellency, The Honourable Sir Alexander M.G. Cadogan, KcMG.,CB., His Britannic Majesty’s Ambaasador, British Embassy, P B I P I N GV q O' 35 new air service will be inaugurated on or about 10th August with the aircraft withdrawn from the FklPING - CANTON route, and stated that trial flights are now being carried out. There will be one oort of call on this route, at HANCHIJNGF0. It is believed that there is an emergency landing ground at PAONIITO, near CHKNGTU. 4. In order to cope with the increased service, three twin-engined Junkers (Type 316} aircraft have been ordered and will be delivered in NOH I in September.

The possibility of an air service between Burma and China was first mooted at a meeting between Major Wronsky of the Deutsche Luft Halls a and representatives of Imperial Airways in London in October last, when the former enquired whether the Company would be prepared to help him to obtair from the British Government the right for the Chinese Company 'Eurasia’ 1 , in which the D.L.H. is interested, to fly from Yunnan-Fu across Burma to Rangoon for a mails service, westbound mails being handed over at Rangoon to Imperial Airways for carriage to Bagdad I^powl whence they would be conveyed to Europe by the Deutsche Luft Hansa. Major Wronsky was told that the matter was one for consideration by the British Government, and later when he visited the Air Ministry it was made clear to him that the proposals would not in any event be agreed to unless reciprocal facilities Y/ere afforded for British air services in China at least to the extent of permission tofly over the Lui Chow peninsular without landing en route from Indo-Ghina to Hong Kong. Major Wronsky promised to look into this and see what could be done. He hinted that if a Yunnan-Fu - Rangoon route was refused his company might he forced to negotiate with the French for permission to fly from Yunnan Fu to Indo-Ghina with a view to connecting with the French service to Kurope. In informing the F.O. of these conversations the Air Ministry recognised that tne (i/I. would need to be consulted. At a subsequent interdepartment meeting at the Air Ministry in Decemher last to al consider civil aviation in the 5hr East, the (E. &amp; 0. 8195/34) Air Ministry representative agreed, in reply to a question hy Mr. Dihdin of this Officejthat no governmental action was necessary, at any rate for the present, regarding Major Wronsky*s proposals. Since then, Dr. Wah Ghing Lin, Aviation [ Gouncillor, Chinese National Government, has t visited Rangoon to study unofficially, aviation conditions in Burma. His chief objects appears to have been to make a study of the probable route from Rangoon to Shanghai via Bangkok and Saigon, not via Yunnan Fu. In June the Air Attach^ at Shanghai reported that the Chinese still had under consideration (E. &amp; .0. 3545/35; (E. &amp; 0. 5591/35) the possibility of operating a Yunnan-Rangoon route, but appeared to be uncertain whether the G/I. would agree. In their present letter to the Consul at Tengyueh, the G/I. say that the potentialities of such a route are of such importance to India that,; ; they cannot leave it to a German-Chinese combination to exploit and they desire to collect all possiole information on the subject.

K* Caroe Deputy Secretary to the Government of Indie.Calcutta and Hongkong are on approximately the same parallel of latitude near the Tropic of Cancer„ Mandalay is about 50 miles south of this parallel, a negligible angular diversion on a long route. Lashio, the rail head of north-east Burma, Is practically on the Calcutta^Hongkong parallel. At Lashio there is an excellent emergency landing ground already in existence and capable of development as a good commercial aerodrome. The important Burma Corporation silver and lead mines at Namtu are close to Lashio and it is adjacent to the States where further mines exist. High ground and rainfall affect the suitability of the direct air line iron Calcutta to Hongkong. Between Chittagong (which is practically on the direct air line) and Mandalay there are some 120 miles of extremely wild country, the Chin hills, reaching 7000 to 10,000 feet. By edging south xrom Calcutta and striking Akyah, about 150 miles south of Chittagong, the hilly strip between the Indian Ocean and Mandalay can be reduced to about 50 miles and the maximum land height to about 5,000 feet. Sast of Mandalay the ground is fairly broken but relatively mild to the China Frontier anywhere near .uaelio, and for some distance north of the Mandalay- Lashio direct line, e.g. ao Kutk&amp;i vthere there is a poor but possible emergency landing ground and much open cl ownland at about 3000-6000 feet) and Nsmkhan where the Shweli River enters Burma from China. Going north of Namkhan, by Bhamo and onwards the country is higher, more broken # and much more wooded, especially round Bhamo itself and. the Irrawaddy valley.4. een Burma and China, running through the m States, lies east of Lashio, The direct air line from Lashio to Hongkong would cross this section but a direct line from Lashio to Yunanfu would pass north of the disputed area. 5, Mandalay is practically in the centre of the Burma dry ^one, with only some 30* of rain per annum, against 100® in Rangoon and still more at Akyab. Lashio also has only a moderate rainfall, but being higher has much more cloud than Mandalay during the monsoon (mid- May to mid-October)o Even in the monsoon, however, the chances of easy flying conditions would be much better at Mandalay than at Rangoon and probably better at lashio than Bhamoo North of Lashio the rainfall increases rapidly and by Myltkylna is very heavy. East of the Burma frontier the conditions are unknown to the writer but the maps indicate a maximum height of only about 7000 feet and. a fairly easy approach to Hongkong down the Sl»klang River in Kwang~Si province, 7. The direct air line from Lashio to Hongkong passes near the China-Tongking frontier and crosses the Hanoi-Yunanfu railway. From Lashio to Hongkong via Yunanfu would entail an appreciable northerly diversion of about 150 miles. Be. Chittagong, Akyab and Mandalay are all suitable for flying boats. Even at Bhamo the Irrawaddy River is possibly suitable for commercial flying boats but much less so then at Mandalay. There are lakes and xe rivers on the China side which seem to offer possibi lities. As regards aerodromes, Lashio is roughly 130 miles from Mandalay and Maymyo about 30 from Mandalay. Lashio already has an excellent all weather landing ground Aground, well drained» There are good cheap Maymyo and Mandalay and both places require aerodromes p Maymyo as the Government capital and Mandalay as the commercial Capital of Upper Burma 0 Mayrayo is 5500 feet and Mandalay is practically at sea level. For heavily loaded commercial craft, Mandalay seems prefer able as a primary site and there would probably be less trouble there with clouds in the monsoon, though ground mists might give trouble in the dry season, 10„ A rainfall map of Burma is practically a target with Mandalay ae the bullseye (minimum rainfall) and concentric circles of increasing rainfall centring on Mandalay. An emergency landing ground in south central Burma, near Thayetmyo, about 160 miles BSE of Akyab, could be made cheaply and migiit be a good haven for machines bound for Rangoon, striking- extremely bad monsoon weather and possibly suffering from failure of wireless• The rainfall is low at Thayetmyo and location easy by the Irrawaddy d® Elver, Visibility must often be good there when it is extremely bad further south. ddA C,W.

I have the honour to submit the following report 1. I had an interview to-day with Herr R. Walter, Technical Manager of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation. He gave me the following information (l) The Corporation reduced the passenger fares and freight rates by 25% on 15th February, 1935 and, in spite of the suspension of the service West of LANCHOW, business has steadily increased. Hie bulk of the traffic is on the SIANFU - LANCHOWFU - NINGHSIAFU - PAOTOWCHEN route. Passenger bookings are heavy and freight, a big percentage of which is comprised of bullion and arms, is considerable. On the other hand, the volume of traffic on the SHANGHAI - LANGHOWFU and the PEIPING - HANKOW - CANTON routes is dis appointing, the average number of passenger 1 bookings between PEIPING and CANTON being only one per flight. (ii)/ The Honourable, Sir Alexander M. G. Cadogan, K. C.M. G. C.B. , His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador, British Embassy, PEIPING. 1(ii) The present contract with the Chinesfe Government ^ will terminate in 1941 and, although it may he inopportune to make any statement, Herr Walter is of the opinion that the ultimate aim of the Minister of Communications is to have both China National and Eurasia Aviation Corporations one hundred percent Chinese national airways. With this end in view, both Companies have received instructions to proceed with the training of Chinese pilots and mechanics. This is causing a certain amount of dissension as the Chinese are not considered either efficient or reliable. The German pilots, moreover, refuse to put their trust in Chinese mechanics. (iii) Information has been received from the Deutsche Luft Hansa Company that the French Government has granted permission for Chinese air transport companieg to fly to HANIO without demanding reciprocal rights except that, in the event of any foreign air service being granted facilities to fly over Chinese territory, similar rights shall be afforded la coftipagnie n Air France 11 . In view of the inability of the Eurasia Aviation Corpor ation to establish the proposed air route ASIA - EUNOPE via URUMTOHI and CHUGUCHAK, to possibility of operating a route from YUNNAN to RANGOON, (to which reference was made in my Despatches Nos. 48 dated 20th September, 1934 and 6 dated 18th Jan- uary, 1935), is still under consideration. Herr/ 'rH a tgHerr Walter agreed that to establish a service over this route would he a difficult undertaking owing to the nature of the country, apart from the fact that the Government of INDIA might not agree to the proposal. 2.

There is not much military aviation in China because we only started two or three years ago, but whereas previously it was haphazard now it is more systematic. At present we have only a nucleus of an air force and it is meant only for defence purposes. We shall have to build it up so that we could protect our territory. COMMEH Cl AL FLYIHCr. w We have great faith in coinmercial air lines**, said Or Wo-Chiang Lin ‘‘because China is such a vast territory with very little surface transportation**. Asked what progress he had noticed in the Philippines, 'Dr Wo- Chi&amp;ng Lin said that previously the Philippines had no civil aviation worth speaking of but now they had two line®. “Lately there has been some .movement for establishing a line from San Francisco, through Manila to China. While I was there I was riven every opportunity by the authorities to study the progress made in civil and military aviation there. TO SUPR&amp;SS BAMITS. **I have not seen what has been done in Singapore yet, but I intend calling on the Commodore of the Air Force here. I have a letter of introduction from the British Legation and the Air Attach^ in China* 1 . Reverting to the question of building up a big air force in China, Dr Io-Chiang Lin discussed how effective it would be in dealing with bandits. 'In the past planes have been very helpful inin keeping down bandits and Communists in Kiansu. They hare proved very effective. It is probably the only way of getting at bandits because communication is so difficult. BRITISH jSNGIK&amp;S. w These bandits if they see a few planes in formation, immediately quit the place. They imagine that the scouting would be followed by bombing and they leave the place before they are bombed. •Bandits generally occupy hilly districts while a few of them hold strategical positions and if our troops approach they are shot and we suffer great loss, but with these planes we hold an advantage. w Br o-Ohi&amp;ng Lin added that most of their planes were of British manufacture. They also had American planes and each of them had its own individual good points. In the British planes they always found that the engines were very good. •China wants planes for more peaceful purposes too. We like to have these planes to improve our communications and to get in touch with the outside world. 1$ T1RHATI DIAL AIRPORT AT SHANGHAI. •There are many aerodromes and air fields are in China.

That is one of the schemes for the future.'Review LIII, page 72. Lin Wo Ghiang, Counsellor of the China National Aviation ’oi/uiiittso, visits lalaya* Lin /o Chiang { ) Counsellor o. zk&lt;e China national Aviation Committee, arrived from Manila in Singapore on 26.1.35. He has been sent fcy the koverniuent of China to visit the Ai.ierican Duton, Irench, and British Colonies in the Southseas to tnank the Chinese for their generosity in subscribing funds for the development of aviation in China and to study aviation in these Colonies. He proposes to go from Singapore to Java to thanJc Chinese there for defraying the cost of an aeroplane for the Chinese Government which has been recently built and named 41 Java* . He is reported to have plans for aeroplanes which he intends to show to Chinese, presumably in the nope that they will subscribe for machines to be presented to the Chinese Government. Interviewed by the press in Singapore he stated that the Chines© Government realised three years ago after the Japanese attack at Shanghai that China 1 s air force was incompetent and decided to improve it. It has established an aviation ^cr-ool at Hangchow and factories to build aeroplanes. Lin Wo Chiang is a Hokkien, who learned aviation in the C.8.A. He returned to China in 1931 and became a member of the Law Drafting Committee of the National Aviation Administration. During the hostilities in Shanghai he undertook the defence of SoochowV * ^ O Sooohow aerodrome. He is Raid to have played an important part in the collection of public subscriptions for the purchase from the U.S.A. of a number of military aeroplanes and bombers of which he formed a squadron* It is alleged that the foreign air attaches in China have cabled to their respective Governments asking that facilities be given to him to inspect the air force® of their Colonies, 14.3.35 from Java where he had a study of aviation* Review LV, page 45.

This is the plan of Mr. i.iu iei-chuan, managing director of the south-west Aviation Corporation, as told to a representative of the Canton Daily Sun yesterday. ”#e propose to take passengers and mails from Canton to Lungehow to make connection with the iianoi-Marseilles ai' service 11 Mr. Liu disclosed. ”An agreement has been reached with the French air line for through passenger service from Canton to Kurope”. Planes of the South-west Aviation Corporation go as far as Lungehow, according to r. Liu, and passengers from Lungchow •c r can take a bus to Hanoi in about four hou^s via Chinankwan and Liangshan. Canton Aviation Centre M We have sent a petition to the Ministry of Communications requesting it to arrange with the French postal administration in Indo-China for through air mail service from Canton to Europe,' ^r. Liu went on. 'If this arrangement is put through, air mails from North China can be sent via Canton. n In that event, air mails from Peiping, Hankow and Shanghai can reach Europe in nine or ten days. The China National Aviation Corporation and the Eurasia Aviation Corporation will be benefited by this trunk line, as they will handle/handle all passengers and mails from and to North China,” The Chinese Post Office accepts air mails from Canton to Europe via Singapore or Saigon, although this route takes at least 14 days, i eople in North China find that air mails to Surope via Singapore or Saigon take too much time and prefer the railway route via Siberia, which is much cheaper than air servicer All communications should fce addressed to the Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Industries and Labour (Civil Aviation), by title, NOT by name.

Sum a yesterday made to me th irprising statement that the Chinese Government ha L^^he Japanese Government with a request for landing rights in Japan for Chinese aviation lines, without being ready to grant reciprocal rights for Jap nese aircraft* In support of this attitude the Chinese Government had alleged that the French Government had granted them unilateral rights for landing in Indo-China, and that the Indian Government had done the same. M. Suma added that he had subsequently ascertained that it was quite untrue ti;at the French had granted such rights to the Chinese, though an arrangement had been made for the linking of the French and Chinese Air lines on the frontier; but under this arrangement the Chinese aircraft would onlv operate as far as the frontier, and the service would then be taken on by the French. He enquired whether the Gove nment of India had granted any unilateral rights to the Chinese, and he also asked whether any negotiations were being conducted by Imperial Airways for landing rights in China. such action on the part of the Indian Government, which seemed to me unlikely. As regards Imperial Airways, I said thefc since I had been here there had been no negotiation on behalf of Imperial Airways. I added that I understood the latter were now exploring the -nossibility of linking Hongkong with the Australian service, but I thought that it was in their minds t: at it might be possible to do t is without flying over Chinese territory, in which case there would be no need to approach the Chinese Government on the subject.

Sir, In ny ’’Report on Conditions and Events in Indochina for the month of January 1935”, under the rubric ”Aviation , it 'was stated that the Compagnie Air France, the iiench air-line running between Marseilles and Saigon, proposed to continue their line from Saigon to Hanoi. 2. This project has been abandonded for the present. As was stated in the report, however, the line from Marseilles to Saigon will now branch off at Bangkok with a 'feeder” line to Hanoi, to permit intending travellers from Tonkin and the North to join the west-bound plane at Bangkok. 3. This projection of their air-line to Hanoi is no doubt the initial thrust of the French towards China, and from Hanoi it will probably be sought to make connection with Hongkong and Canton and so connect Europe with the Pacific. From Bangkok the branch line to Hanoi crosses Siam via Korat, reaches Laos via Vientiane on the Mekong, the administrative capital, crosses the Annamite chain to Vinh, on the coasts of the China sea, and so North to Hanoi. Thence it will probably be continued via Quang-Yen, Moncay and Hainan along the China coast to Hongkong and Canton. of their air-line to China, the French authorities have established the necessary aerodromes and landing grounds in Towards the realisation of this projected extension Laos/ His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, LONDON, S . ?v • 1 •2.

Atmospheric disturbances are very common in this region, and may necessitate frequent emergency landings: ¥inh .in Annam, with a wireless station: Gia Lam, near Hanoi, in Tonkin, where hangars and workshops have been constructed. 5. It is understood that negotiations between the French authorities and the Chinese government have been proceeding for some time with a view to securing the permission of the latter for flights between Moncay on the Tonkin China frontier and Hongkong. Several experimental flights over this territory are said to have proved the practicability of a regular air- service, and it is hoped that it may be possible to extend the line from Hanoi to Hongkong during the course of the present year. 6 . The ”Air France' company are likewise considering i possible improvements in the speed and comfort of their machines. * They propose to add to their existing fleet the Liore Olivier waterplane, and the Lewoitine aeroplane. The former has four motors with a total horse-power of 1,420. It carries eleven passengers. The Lewoitine machine will, it is thought, complete the journey Marseilles-Hanoi in under five days. It has three . Hispano-Suiza motors and can atxain a speed of 260 kilometres an hour. It carries eight passengers. I have, etc., (Sgd.) J.L.HOGG. Acting Consul-General.

We discussed inter alia proposed air routes in CHINA. He asked me not to disclose the following except to H.M. Government, 3. He said that an agreement ’had now been reached in LONDON between the Lufthansa Company and the Air Ministry whereby the Eurasia Aviation Corporation had been given permission to fly via YUNNAN either to RANGOON or CALCUTTA. Mails and passengers carried by this service would be flown by Imperial Airways to and from EUROPE and Lufthansa would provide the European link which would probably be between ATHEN2 and BERLIN.

He added that the Central Government had, as a quid pro quo, given permission for Imperial Airways to fly over the HAINAN STRAIT. 6. The Air Ministry has not informed me of any such agreement. 7.

In their discussions with Major Wronsky Imperials Airways had suggested that 'Eurasia' should endeavour to obtain for them the right to fly over Chine without landing en route to Hong Kong and had hinted that, in return, it might be possible to arrange for facilities for 'Eurasia' to operate to Rangoon. If the proposals for co-operation with 'Eurasia' matured and permission was also obtained for Imperial Airways to operate to Hong Kong - flying over the Lui-Chow peninsula without landing - his company would be enabled to carry both north and south mails over two routes to and from China. ••• ... ... ...

China. Lt.-Col. Shelmerdine said that the meeting had been called to discuss further the question of the establishment of a British air service to China. The matter had become one of some urgency in view of the activities of foreign competitors in th same field. He referred (l) to the proposals of 'Eurasia', a Sino-German Company, to operate an air mail service between China and Europe in conjunction with Imperial Airways, Ltd. (He)then asked for the views of the representatives of other Departments concerning the 'Eurasia' company*s proposals. Mr. Randall said that the Foreign Office saw no objection to the German scheme, but they felt that it should not be regarded as a suitable alternative to the British proposals. Mr. Harcourt Smith pointed out that 'Eurasia' could apparently blackmail us by their threat to link up with the French if the British will not co-operate. Mr. Dibdin intimated that if the Air Ministry desired to support the 'Eurasia' proposals the India Office would probably raise no objection. The scheme did not appear, however, to be very attractive so far as India was concerned. He thought, moreover, that it was very unlikely that a service could be operated direct from Yunnan Fu to Rangoon in view of the difficult nature of the country. Lt. Col. Shelmerdine said that the only attraction which thi scheme offered was that it would ensure for Imperial Airways Ltd. the carriage of a large volume of mail - i.e. the British German and Scandinavian - between Athens and Rangoon. With regard to Mr. Harcour Smith*s point he said that while the French migh t agree to co-operate with 'Eurasia' it would seem that Air France are definitely linking up with the China National Aviation CorporaGaon. Extract from minute by Mr. Dibdin submitting the note for information, 17th Dec. 1934. .... There was some discussion in reg/ard to the question of flying over the Hainan Strait or the peninsula leading up to it. The former involves an extra 150 miles flying'' but was practicable. Imperial Airways were inclined to suggest that if we would give their friends 'Eurasia' rights to fly into Rangoon it would be possible to get from the Chinese the necessary rights to permit flight over the Hainan peninsula. It was, however, generally agreed that we did not wish to pursue the 'Eurasia' project.ii any further communication on this subject, please quote No. pLi+CO- ^/C»|. and address —not to any person by name, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

ALSO ' ~ s PRESENT). Major Wronsky commenced by stating that the Deutsche Luft Hansa was,interested in a Chinese Company called 'Eurasia,* and he wished to secure arrangements whereby the mails that came into the hands of Eurasia in China could be flown towards Europe and be handed over to a German service somewhere on the route and vice versa* and would help him to obtain from the British Government the right for: - (1) The Eurasia Company to fly from Yunnan-Fu across Burma to Rangoon and (2) Luft Hansa to fly via Athens to Baghdad either via Cyprus and Palestine or via Egypt and Palestine* In exchange for this help and this permission, he would be prepared to arrange for the mail to be carried between Baghdad and Rangoon exclusively by our service* He stated specifically that the service would be for mails only and also that he had been authorised by the Chinese Government, who have the controlling interest in Eurasia, to approach us in the matter. ment would give us reciprocal facilities to fly to Hong Kong, Major Wronsky said that the Chinese Government regretted that they were unable to give facilities for any foreign service to fly over Chinese territory, as if they were to do so, it would be impossible for them to withhold permission for the Japanese to fly over China and they were not prepared at present to agree to any Japanese aircraft flying into China. It was pointed out to Major Wronsky that if China were given such a facility in the case of Eurasia, they might adopt the He asked, therefore, whether we would give our blessing In reply to an enquiry as to whether the Chinese Governsame procedure elsewhere* (We know, but did not disclose to Major Wronsky that negotiations are already been carried on on similar lines for the China National Aircraft Corporation to fly into French Indo-China without reciprocal facilities being granted for French aircraft to fly into China)* This would give China an unfair advantage, since they would be able to get an air connection to Europe themselves, while prohibiting our getting an air connection from Hong Kong* Major Wronsky pointed out the value of the postal traffic which they would give to our service from Rangoon to Baghdad, which he said would amount to 100 kilos a week, and which would be paid for at the internationally agreed rate. In reply to the question as to why he wanted to fly to Baghdad, he said that he wanted to fly as far as possible, but was apparently quite agreeable to bargain as to whether he should stop and hand over the mail to us at Athens, Egypt, Palestine or Baghdad* It was pointed out to him that for us to carry the mail only between Baghdad and Rangoon, was to carry it over our bottle neck section which would probably deprive us of through carryings over twice the distance, and that we would naturally prefer to have the mail handed to us at Athens. Major Wronsky gave the impression that he would agree to this, but pointed out that the crux of the matter was at the eastern end and as to whether Eurasia would be given permission to fly into Rangoon, and whether we would mind his seeing Colonel Shelmerdine on the subject. We said that we had not the slightest objection to hia seeing Colonel Shelmerdine, but we doubted very much whether the British government would give such s permission for Eurasia to fly from China Into Burma, without obtaining reciprocal facilities for our service to fly into Hong Kong.* * -3- whatever of the Chinese Government according this reciprocal right, and indicated that if he could not make an arrangement with us, he might he forced to approach the French with the idea of flying from Yunnan-Fu into French Indo-China, where he would, of course, connect with the French service to Europe. Following the discussion of Chinese affairs. Major Wronsky raised the difficulties of payments from Germany to this country, and explained that although their indebtedness to us was recently to the order of £15,000, they had now reduced the debt to £10,000 and would as currency became available, continue to reduce it still further. With a view, however, to speeding up the settlement, he asked whether we could accept payment In kind, and gave to us a list of aeroplane material which he considered might possibly be of service to us or the British Government, and would enable him to discharge his obligations to us at a quicker rate than would otherwise be possible.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000230_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2022</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000230</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2022</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 5/61 ‘Far East: Proposed extension to Burma-Yunnan frontier of Imperial Airways to link up with Eurasia Corporation’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-12-20T23:10:25</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (363 folios)</extent><extent>The file incorporates two files from the Economic and Overseas Department: E&amp;O Coll 2/23 (folios 131-364) and E&amp;O Coll 2/23A (folios 95-130).
