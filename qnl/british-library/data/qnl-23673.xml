Subject: - Grant of the benefit of the''.next below rule^ to officers of i;he becretnry of State, I aia directed to invite a reference to the.'.correspond ence resting ri ill the Government of , India, Home Department, letter No,277/42-Ests. oated J-anaary-4, 1944, on the subject noted above, and to their letter No-ol/44 : -Ests; &gt; , dated March 16, 1944, regarding the particular case/of Hr/lQiurshed Ahmad lOian, 1.0,5,, Chief Gomiiissionef, Ajmer Meiniara, and to say that'after carefpl consideration of., the various rulings regarding the application of the ? next belovj rule ? the Gover- ■ nor has come to the conclusion th?:t the position has become very complicated and obscure, as. shov;n belovf, and requires to be finally clarified by the Secret ry of Statec . ' N 2c: The guiding principle -which was approved by the Secretary of State for the working of the T next'below rule 7 ., in the correspondence a copy of ikhich was. forwarded to Pro vincial Governments with the Government of India, Home Lepart- ment, letter No c F, 0 52/36-Ests : ? dated February 6, 1936, indi cated thcit the- intention was that the benefit of that ir rule Tr '' should be given, .in the.circumstances detailed in that corres- po.ndence, to an officer serving out of his regular line. Sub sequently with their letter Ho j 1 .15(14)-Exl/41, dated Dececi-■ ■ber 3, 1941, the Government of India, Finance Department, forwarded to all Provincial Governments', for information and guidance, copies of two letters dated September 3,1941 and November 10,1941, : from the Auditor:-General on the'subject. The first letter explained that the ,f next; below rule ,{ was not a rule,- that there was no general authority of the Secretary of State' to apply this so called rule to cases relating to his officers and/that consequently it could not .be applied to those cas'es Unless its application had been specifically: sanctioned, by the Secretary of State, The second letter explained that the' second proviso to Fundamental Hule 30(1) provided, where it was applicable; a substitute for the 'next below rule' 7 and that it conferred on the competent authority in India powers calculated to achieve the, same effect as the^ ''next below rule*' even in the case of officers of the Secre tary of State's- servicesj subject to the general principles approved by that authority for the application cf that rule. Later with their letter No.150/41-Ssts, dated April 23,1942,• the _ Goyernment of Ina ia, Home Department, commuar-oated a ruling of the Secre.triry cf S' ; ate contained in his telegram No.4620, dated August 10 ; 1940. that holders of■special posts such as Secretary to a Governor or Secretary to a Provincial Government should be ready to .accept- loss of officiating promotion to higher posts in the ordinary line for short periods in consequence of their incumbency of special- posts. and that when the stage is reached at which their retention involves loss of substantive or lengthly officiating promo tion, the proper course woulei b,e to release them from the special pests rather than'to compensate them under the ''next ' : below . .. 0 c c,....below rulo' 1 for the Ions of officiating promotion. This ruling v /ould. equally apply to the post of Chief Gonunissioner, Ajmer-' Mervmra, as in this respect it is not different to such posts as Sbcretry to a Governor or oecretnry to a Provincial Govern- ment. 'The term ' f short_periods'^ usea in these orders has since . .been defined as a period not Bxceeding thr^e months and the orders have been amplified in the India Office letter No.G &amp; G. ^688/43, Gated October 29,1943, It will be observed that while the term used in the Secretary of Gtate ? s telegram dated August 10, 1940, is ^special pests' thr-t used in the letter elated October 29, 1943, is 'posts outsiae the ordinary line' of a service, but from the .context it would appear- that the- two terms are intended to have reierence to the same kind of posts e 'Posts outside the ordinary line r is also the term used in the seconci proviso to Fundamental Rule 30(1). 3. Under the second proviso to Fundamental Rule 30(1) as amended by the general rule made by the Secretary of State, publisked with the Government' of India, Home Department, notifica- / tion ilo. 195/40, dated June 9,1942, the Governor acting in his individual judgment is now empowered to specify posts outside the ordinary line of a^ service anc. to give the' holders thereof such officiating promotion ana higher pay as the y would have got had they remained in the ordinary line, even in the case of officers of the Secretary of State r s services serving in connexion with the affairs of the province without reference to that authority. It is quite clear that the Governor has this power in the case of -x-padre posts held by such officers, such as the temporary posts oi war Production Commissioner, Command:ant of a Special Armed Constabulary Battalion, etc., created by the Governor, end he has been exercising this power in cases in which the general conditions of the 'next below rule' are satisfied. He is inclined to consider however, that the- term 'posts outside the ordinary line of a service 1 ' in the second proviso to Fundamental Rule 3C .) also in cludes special posts outside the ordinary line but vuich are in cluded in the cadre of a service, such as those of Secretary to Government or Settlement Officer, and that that proviso therefore applies to such posts also, since if the term was intended to mean only ' ex-cadre posts' those words would have been/instead , to make the meaning clear. But doubts have arisen on this point firstly because the term 'posts outsice the ordinary line of a service' is not defined anywhere, secondly because of the instruc tions contained in the .Auditor Generals' letter dated September ^3,1941^ referred to- in para. 1 above, and thirdly because in the case oi special posts the Secretary of State has in some cases issued special orders, as for example the orders' contained in Schedule,VIII to the Superior Civil Services Rules regaraing the grant of senior scale pay without special pay to I.G,S, Assistant Settlement Officers if they would have been holding superior posts if employed in the regular line, and the orders of the Secretary of State in his telegram dated August 10,1940, and India Office letter No. S &amp; Xr 2688/43, dated October 29',1943. But if the in tention of the Secretary of State was that the second proviso to Fundamental Rule 30(l) should be applicable only to holders of ex-cadre posts, and not to holders of special posts included in the'cadre ofa service, there seems to be no logical reason for such discrimination, if an officer has to forfeit officiating pro motion in the regular line which he would otherwise have got and is thus put to loss for no fault of his own but because Government considerconsider t necessary in the public interest to, retain him in some special post carr/ii^ 6, lower pay it 6oes not seem to be relevant 3 in considering the question''.of. compensat- • ing hin 5 uhether- the special- post is an ex-cadre, one or is included in the cadre of the service. TJie view tliat spec.ial posts'.out.iiae. the &lt;|rdimry ;^ine; but included,-an the cadre of a service are ±1 \o inciuaed in the term .- n posts out sic. e/. • the'ordimry line af a service !t , besides ex-cadre .posts, ■ is also-confiraod by'the ruling ' contained in the India Office le-; ter-o.ated October 29 5 1943, v;iiicl^uggests; that the Holders of such posts can be given tlie benefit of the 'next below rule' provided the conditions laid down for its application are fulfilled. It,also seems to be confirmed by the Go^eriimenL of India., Home Department, 'letter dated March 16, 1944, regarding, the case of Mr. Idmrshed .\hmad Khan, 1,0 Chief Commissioner, .'Ajmer-Merwara, since so far as the Provincial Government are- aware., this post is, , . • included ;Vn the 1,GoS* cadre of the United Provinces in place of the previous.post of Gammissioner 5 Ajmer-Merwara. ' 4. In the circumstance detailed above ,' I am to. request that a^clear definition of the term r1 posts outside. , v the ordinary line of a. service^ occurring in the second proviso to Fundamental Rule 30(1) inay^ be obtained from the Secretary of State,as soon- as possible,, so*that, the' doubts regarding the application of that proviso to special posts included in the cadre of a service, may be removed. If it is held thf t. the term includes such posts then the occasions when it might be: necessary to apply to officers of the oecretary of Statt. f s' services in the special. ■ orders resgarding the grant of compensation contained in paras 3 and 4 of the India'Office letter- dated October 29,1943, would be very few and the d iff iq.ult ie s regard ing the application pi those orders,would largely disappear. As regards holders of posts in the ordinary line, .eVg.. a Joint Magistrate, Collector, Assistant Superintendent of Police or Superintendent' of Police the intention no-doubt is that the benefit of the ? next below rule 1 should not. be giyen^to them unless the Secretary of State has specially sanctioned it in a particular case. 5.

In certifying the amount of privilege ? u ? to the aud:lt executive officer will add to the total admissible under the ordinary rules an additional period calculated on the service during which an officer was so debarred. This additional period of leave will be limited to two months.

His Excellency the Governor of Madras has decided that the commutation privilege should be restored on the lines of the rules in force before 1939. Funds will be provided for the expenditure in the current year in due course. 2. The following notification will be published in the Fort St. George Gazette i - NOTIFICATION In exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) of Section 241 of the Government of India Act 1936, His Excellency the Governor of Madras is pleased to make the following rules to regulate the commutation of civil pensions. Rules. 1. These Rules may be called the Madras Civil Pensions (Commutation) Rules, 1944. 2. These rules apply to Government servants under the rule-making control of the Government of Madras, and shall also apply to persons to whom the Madras Civil Pensions (Commutation) Rules 1934, would have applied, had those rules not been cancel led by Finance Department Notification No. 7 dated 10th January 1939. published at page 64 of Part I of the Fort St. George Gazette, dated the 17th January 1939. 3. (1) A Government servant to whom these rules apply shall, subject to the conditions hereinafter specified, be allowed to commute for a lump payment any portion, not exceeding one-half of the pension granted to him by the Provincial Government : Provided that : (a) the expenditure involved can be met from the sanctioned budget grants; and (b) the residue of the pension after the commutation, together with the uncommuted portion of any permanent pension or pensions payable to the Government servant by a local body or a state in India or by any Government in British India or in the British Empire, shall not be less than t (i) One hundred rupees per mensem or two-thirds of the pension granted to him by the Provincial Government, whichever is less, in the case of a Government servant who at the time of his retirement held a permanent gazetted appointment; andSt. George Gazette, dated the 17th November, 1931, as subsequently amended. Note : - The lump sum payable on commutation to Government servants who have served under more than one Govern ment when the commutation tables applied by the different Governments are not identical, shall be calculated according to the commutation table of the Government under whose rule-making control they are at the time of retirement. In the case of Government servants who are temporarily lent by one Government to another, the commutation shall be according to the table of the landing Government and in the case of those who are permanently transferred from one Government to another, it shall be according to the table of the Government to which their services have been permanently transferred, ?• Commutation, when sanctioned, shall take effect on a date to be specified in the order. Such date shall ordinari ly be about one month later than the date of the order; and all calculations shall be made with reference to the date so specified. Payment of the commuted portion of the pension shall cease from the date specified and the sum payable on commuta tion shall be paid on that date or as soon afterwards as possible. The applicant may withdraw his application by written notice despatched at any time before his medical examination is due to take place. Where the table of present values applicable to an applicant modified between the date of the order sanctioning the commutation and the date on which the commutation takes effect, payment shall be made in accordance with the modified table; but it shall be open to the applicant, if the modified table is less favourable to him than that previously in force, to withdraw his application by notice in writing despatched within fourteen days of the date on which he receives notice of the modification. 8. The lump sura in cases in wh^ch application is addressed to the Provincial Government shall be payable in India; in all other cases it shall be payable at the Home Treasury; the rate of exchange for the conversion of the lump sum, where the question of conversion arises, shall be such rate as the Secretary of State may by order prescribe. 9. A commutation once given effect to cannot be rescinded, that is, the portion of a pension commuted cannot be restored on refund of its capitalised value. 10• If the pensioner dies on or after the day following that on which commutation took effect but before receiving the commutation value, such value shall be paid to his heirs.

Subject:— Clarification of the Secretary of State f s rulings crelating to the 'next below rule'. I am directed to state that doubts have frequently been expressed by Provincial G-overnments and Audit Officers regarding the exact scope of the various rulings issued by the oecretary of State in connection with the operation of the next oelow # rule'. For avoidance of doubt, the extant decisions on this subject have been summarised below. 7 ^ 2. x The working rule subjoined to this paragraph may be ta^en l &gt; o express the convention which is commonly mown as the next below rule' as originally approved, and its provisos, the modifications made from time to time by the Secretary of State. Tne intention underlying the 'rule' is that an officer out of his regular line^should not suffer by forfeiting the officiating promotion which he would otherwise have received had he remained in nis original line. The so-called 'rule' is not a rule of any independant application. Itsets out only the guiding principles ior application in any case in which the &amp;overnor-General in Gopiacil, ^or the Governor exercising his individual judgment in virtue of the powers conferred on him by the Secretary'of State's 9 1 'f &gt; ^ e l^th April 1942 (published with Home Department Notification No.195/40-S3ts.,' dated the 9th June 1942), proposes to regulate officiating pay by special orders under the second proviso to Fundamental Rule 30 (1). The conditions precedent to the application of the 'ngxt below rule' must therefore be fulfilled in each individual case before action may be taken under this^proviso. It also follows that the benfit of officiate mg.promotion is to be given only in resnect of the period or periods during which the conditions of the 'next below rule' are satisfied. Rule--When an officer in a post (whether within of his service or not) is for any reason prevented from oificiating m his turn in a post on a hisfier seale^ or ^rade borne on the cadre of the Service to which he belongs, he may be autnonsed by^special order of the appropriate authority pro forma officiating promotion into such scale or grade and there upon be granted the pay of that scale or grade, if that be more advantageous to him, on each occasion on which the officer immediately junior to him in the cadre of his Service (or if that officer has been passed over by reason of inefficiency or unsuitablity or becuase he is on leave or serving outside the ordinary line or foregoes.officiating promotion of his own volition to that scale or grade then the officer next junior to him not so passed over) draws officiating pay in that scale or grade. Provided that all officers senior to the officer to whom the benefit under the substantive part of tikis rule is to be allowed are also drawing, unless they have been passed over for one or other of the reasons aforesaid, officiating pay in the said or some higher scale or grade within the cadre: Provided further that, except in cases covered by any special orders of the Secretary of States, not more than one officer (either the seniormost fit officer in a series of adja cent officers outside the ordinary line, or, if such an officer either foregoes the benefit of his own volition or does ^ot require the benefit in virtue of his holding a post outside the (Drdinary line which secures him at least equivalent benefits in respect of pay and pension then the next velow in the series) may be authorised to draw the pay of the higher scaifee or grade in respect of any one officiating vacancy within the cadre filled by his junior under this rule'.holding the special post in the public interest, « . , n If? teowever, in such a case the conditions of the + 5 0 jf ru iu are s^-^isfied, the officer concerned may be granted under the second proviso to Fundamental Rule 30(lj tne concession admissible under the 'next below rule', but, save m exceptional circumstances, such an officer should i ^ e . s P?pial post if the pay attached thereto is lojver tnan that admissiole to him under the 'next below rule' 1 1 or more than 6 months beyond the date from which the H next below.rule' fflXMMXrataMIH begins to operate!

After a careful consideration of these cases, the Government of Pakistan are .pleased to decide that road-mileage between residences of officers and aerodromes should not be allowed in case the air companies have arrangements for the transport of passengers between aerodromes and their offices in the cities where facilities of air travel exist. In such cases mileage should be allowed only upto the point of the offices of the companies. il l IK , i V k ; - 11 M ,No. -15/10.

S'v/hile returning from leave the Residency had booked ray passage and that of ray family from Bombay. I could not have proceeded to K-r \chi .and embarked from ther« as communications between Bombay and Karachi were |uite unreliable and because of the insecure conditions prevailing there at th^ time. To be able to arrive in Bahrain withih ray joining time it was in the interests of Government that I should make my journey from Bombay. fr I may also submit that Karachi being no longer part of India an Indian national returning from leave could not be expected to embark from a port other than one in India # The ne .rest port to the Gulf fxsaa In India is Bombay and should be consi dered as the 'fixed point 1 for the journey. During■the war the Govt, of IndLq had allowed ministerial staff of the Residency to consider Bombay as th?s 'fixed point' while proceeding on or returning from leave, under certain circumstances, (vide p.70 of file 15/10-VI - flagged). On the same analogy, as it was 'in the interest of Govefnment that I should arrive in Bahrain with the minimum delay after the expiry of ray leave -- which could only be done if I embarked from Bombay — and the Residency themselves booked ray passage- from Bombay I request that I may be allowed to draw my travelling allowance and that for ray family ffom Bombay.

Subject:- Commutation with retrospective effect of leave granted under the Revised i^eave Kules, 1933# Sir, I am directed to invite a reference to this Department letter jmo . F.7(34)-K.i/36, dated the 13th August 1936, on the subject stated above, which has been inserted as the Government of India's decision under rule 11 of the Revised Leave Rules, 1933, (Volume II, page 66 of the fundamental Rules compilation by the Accountant-General, Posts and Telegraphs). The question has been raised whether in the case of an outsider who was appointed to a temporary post in 1934| was granted extraordinary leave in 1939 under rule 16(1)(a), and was without any other interruption of duty confirmed in 1940 in a permanent post, it is permissable to convert retrospectively his extraordinary leave into earned leave by the revision, under rule 11, of the earned leave at credit. As in a case like this the character of an officer's temporary service is not changed by his subsequent confirmation and as his claim to leave is to be strictly governed by the rules in force at the time the leave is applied for and granted, the regulation of earned leave during such temporary service by a rule other than rules 10 and 12(d) would be opposed to the provisions of the rules, it has accordingly been decided that commutation of extraordinary leave taken during temporary service when no other leave was due into earned leave on confirmation without interruption of service by giving retrospective effect to the benefit of rule 11 would be irregular and not in accordanve with the intention of this Department letter referred to above. 2. The real intention tf rule 11 of the Revised Leave Rules is to provide only for a retrospective recalculation of the leave at credit on the date of confirmation with a reduction on account of the earned leave already taken, except for the carry-forward of the recalculated credit on confirmation, leave earned and taken should be a closed chapter at that point and no readjustment of any leave taken is automatically permissible as a consequence of such recalculation. The 'closed chapter 1 may however properly be re-opened, for instance, to correct a miscalculation of leave earned or taken; or to readjust leave earned and taken when confirmation is ordered with retrospective effect; or, at the discretion of the sanctioning authority, to convert leave of any one kind already taken into leave due of any other kind admissible at the time the leave was originally taken.

To The Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I/£MQRAIvDUM Mr. S.K. Moorthy who came here on transfer from Bushire in September 1943 and travelled by M.Y.'Resang' claims the usual travelling allowance for a journey on transfer, i.e., three steamer fares and the actual cost of transporting his personal effects within the minimum prescribed for his grade. Unfortunately if Exception to S.R.116(a)(I)(iv) is made operative in his case, since at the time of his transfer the 'Resang' may have been a Government vessel, he can only draw daily allowance. This means he will only draw Rs. 4-5-0 for the two days and the cooly hire, launch charges, £:c., for trans porting his baggage which came to Rs .26/-. 2. The whole idea of the Transfer Travelling Allowance rules is to cover the numerous incidental expenses involved in dis mantling one establishment and setting up another, and this idea would appear to have been rendered inoperative by the Exception quoted above. As a result Mr. Moorthy will be con siderably out of pocket over his transfer and subject to hardship I should therefore be grateful if any allowance can be macie in Mr. Moorthy 1 s ca^e and if for the purpose of Travelling Allowance rules tne 'Resang' should be considered as a Government vessel or not. for Political Aeent, Bahrain.—— FINANCE lEPARMSNT NO TTFICATION New DelUii, the 21st October 1943. ^o.l r ,2(40)-1/45.- In exercise of the powers con- rerred 'by clause (a) of su 'b -section (2) of* section 241 or the Goverment or India Act, 1935, the Governor General in Council is pleased to direct that the following further amendments shall he made in the fundamental Bales, namely In the said Roles to clause (h) of rule 53 the following proviso shall 'be added, namely 'Provided that the suspending authority may direct that the CJovemment servant under suspension shall he granted in addition such compensatory allowances as the Governor General in Council may sanction 'by general or special order for issue under this proviso • M (This amendment shall take effect from the 20th July 1943), SWA, Sd/- B.M,8taig, Additional Secretary,Nb,]?.l(l2)-E, 1/43, GGTORNMBNT Oi 1 INDIA simm xKPAtmua'i' Simla, the 6th October 1943 QMmjmmimM Subject Compensatory^ allowance payable during leave talcen 'by a GoTemment seiTant in, or at the end ot 9 foreign service.

The sanction accorded in telegram under reference permits the piyin©nt of a lump sum at the rate of Ks« 2/- per day (assuming there are 30 days in the month) during tue period of an enforced bait at Bombay or Karachi. This rate is quite inade quate for new clerks, who apart from maintaining themselves in an hotel have also to bear expenditure on account of their transport to and from the shipping office, the Persian Consulate, the Censor Office and Customs. 3 # I consider that each recruit should receive a minimum sum of lis. 5/~ per day for the period of his enforced halt and I request that this amount be sanctioned with retrospective effect from July 6th 1943. In view of the extreme difficulty experienced in recruiting and retaining clerks for the Persian Gulf Clerical Cadre it would appear unnecessary to stress the importance of ensuring that new recruits do not start their careers with an overdraft. 4.

Subject K Improvements in the pension prospects of staff of Persian Gulf. Sir, &gt; 1 I am directed to refer to the Express Letter from the Secretary of State for India No. Ext. 7124/41, dated the 8th November 1941, and to forward a copy of Express Letter from/ Britconsul Bushire No. 2738-64/62, dated the 9th December 1944. In the circumstances explained, the Government of India afiree that the concessions sanctioned by the Secretary of State in his letter referred to above should be made admissible to (a) all members of the Persian Gulf Residency clerical cadre in cluding ministirial gazetted officers (b; all clerical and subordinate members of the Residency Public ^orks Department including clerks, draftsmen, overseers and supervisors and (c) all persons mentioned in (a) and (b) above who may be on,j deputation provided the conditions specified in the Govern-, ment of India, External Affairs Department letter No. F. 19(11) -E/40, dated the 27th March 1942 ( forwarded to India Office with Government of India, External Affairs Department letter No. 25*1, dated the 27th March 1942) are satisfied. It will be seen from the letter from the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf No.656, dated the 17th May 1940(copy en closed with the letter from the Government of India in the External Affairs Department No. F, 19(11)-E/40 dated the 7th May 1941) that the revised pension rules were intended to apply to members of the clerical cadre who have to spend their whole service in the Persian Gulf area, and only the I.P.S. officers who were not permanently posted there were to be ex cluded. As the ministerial gazetted officers come from the same clerical cadre and put in their entire service in the Gulf, it is reasonable to give them the benefit of the revised pension rules. The Government of India are also opposed to differen tiation between members of the clerical cadre and those of the Public Works Department as the latter have to serve under similar conditions. 2. I am directed to request that approval of His Majesty's Government to the proposed amplification be obtained and^ communicated to the Government of India as early as possible.
