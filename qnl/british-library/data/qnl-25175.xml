The Imperial Bank of Persia has now applied for admission to the list,. Its reason for doing so will be found in the Manager 5 s letter dated 4th January (copy enclosed) and in the enclosed note headed M Purchase of Drafts on India by Imperial Bank of Persia', explaining more fully the nature of the transactions which make it desire drafts on India. The transactions have^ it will be seen, no connection with the export of war commodities to Europe: and the Bank has (for reasons stated in the letter and note) not been hitherto a purchaser of drafts from the Secretary of State. The recent purchases have been:* 1916. Eso £e 27th September, 1,15,000 mm 7,700. w » 2,00,000 = 13,300o 27th December, 15,00,000 mm mm 100,000 1?17 3rd January, 15,00,000 100,000. Even if it were admitted as an applicant for drafts, it could not 8 consistently with the principles on which the approved list • has been drawn up 8 be allowed to apply for amounts at all approaching its purchases on 27th December1916, and 3rd January | 1917. The Secretary of State would very much prefer to reply I to the Bank*s letter by an expression of regret that he cannot accede to the request contained therein 0 In that event, the Bank would be in the same position as regards remittances to India as any of the other numerous firms not on the approved list, i.e. it would have to rely on such means of remittance as it could get from Exchange Banks or by the purchase (if available)available) of commercial bills payable in India against commodities imported into that country 0 Before communicating his decision s the Secretary of State will be glad to receive any observations which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs may wish to make® A copy of this letter is being sent to the Treasury to save timeg as the decision ought to be communicated to the Imperial Bank not later than the 9th Instant 9 the day before the next weekly sale of drafts on Indiao I have the honour to be 9 S'ir» Your obedient Servant, (S’d) LIONEL ABRAHAMS.PIMIHASE QF DRAFTS QI1 INDIA BY U^KRIAL BANK OF PERSIA. 1. I5r* Newell, Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, came to see me to-day and explained how the need of the Imperial Bank of Persia for Drafts on India arises. 2. The Russian troops in the North of Persia are paid by their Government in rouble currency. Their method of turning their pay into Persian money is to sell to the Imperial Bank of Persia, for krans, rouble notes and rouble telegraphic transfers on Petrograd. In order to get krans for the purpose of this business the Imperial Bank sells for krans, to Persians who have imported goods from India, drafts on Bombay which the Persians use to pay for imports. 3. In order to meet the drafts which thus become payable by it in Bombay, the Imperial Bank sells in London exchange on Petrograd (acquired by it as explained in paragraph 2) and uses the London money thus obtained to buy exchange on India. The cycle of payments and receipts is thus completed. 4. , Formerly the Imperial Bank bought its exchange on India from the HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Mow that that Bank, like the other great exchange banks doing business with India, finds itself very short of exchange on India, it cannot sell to the Imperial Bank of Persia. The Imperial Bank has therefore in the last few weeks bought its exchange on India direct from the Secretary of State by bidding for Council drafts. If that resource is cut off from it, it will presumably have to give up selling in Persia drafts on Bombay (which will hamper Indian exports to Persia) and] THE IMP 'RIAL BANK OF P RSIA, 25 ABCHURCH LANE, LONDON, E.C. 4th January 1917 Dear Sir, With reference to the Notification issued yesterday by the Secretary of State for India in Council in miard to applications for Bills of Exchange and Telegraphic Transfers on India, I notice that this Bank does not appear on the list of Institutions and Firms from whom applications for Bills and Transfers will be received until further notice. I shall esteem it a favour if you ''ill be so good as to give instructions to the Chief Cashier of the Bank of England to receive applications from this Bank, and also indicate the amount of Bills or Telegraphic Transfers for which the Bank will be at liberty to apply. As you are probably aware, the Bank, in agreement with the British and Russian Governments, is financing the Russian troops in Persia, and our Offices in Persia have to draw on India in this connection, and this Office has to remit to India in cover of such drawings. Formerly the funds required in India were provided by our Correspondents, the HonpKong and Shanghai Banking CorDeration, but owing to the restrictions placed upon remittances from this side our Chief Manager has requested us to anply direct to the Council for our remittances to India* In the last two weeks, as you know, we have remitted to Bombay 30 lacs of rupees Telegraphic Transfers.

Sir, On the receipt ot your telegram no 246 of the 23rd of ?r ay I addressed, a Jtfote to the Persian Government in regard the property of tlie Imperial Band: of Persia stolen or destroyed during the revolutionary disturb ances which resulted from the agitation fomented by agents of the German Government and by Persians in their pay and under their Influence. X reminded Prince Serein ed Bowl eh that I had on several ecsastons wam€Kl his predecessor that If tl e property or persons of British subjects were injured a cld. would arise against the Persian Government # I also recalled that the Chief Manager of the Imperial Bank o Persia had protested against the acts of those responsible The Fight Honourable Sir JMward Grey.

I stated that in the view of His r fajesys uovern^ent the above clause clearly fixed u^on the Persian Gcvemrent the duty iff safeguardlm the property of the Bmtik # and that falling such protect Ion the Bank had the undoubted right to look to th&amp;tc Government for redress. I concluded by inviting tlie Persian Governnent to aocepy liability for U:&amp; losses ascertained to have been oausei. to the Sank by tko forcible closing of ^ its branches and by the destruction . t or theft of its property. In reply the Minister for foreign iffairs has mm .trore advanced, the plea of force majeure .

Consequently the Perslar. Govemmexrt placee tl-.a responsibility on the instigators of the revolution and Ieohs to H1s Majesty's Govensrent to assist Fersl she has suffered.

I feel sure that whatever may have been in the minds of previous foreign ini stars* it is an argumant which Your Bughness will disclaim .jin general however Your Higimess’s hot© appears not to recognise the essential difference between neutrality in time of peace and in time of wrfc.In tine of peace the observance of neutrality is a duty which primarily the State owes to Itself alone but in tlr.esof war ^ neutrality imposes on a nonbelligerent state the further duty of protecting within its own borders the Interests of on© belligerent as against the othier* It is precisely the duty which, Persia has failed to fulfil and she cannot ©scare fros&gt;*%Jie responsibility for the consequences of for neglectJ] regards m&gt; &gt; * v/ As regards the q.-uestio of the assistance which Persia desired tc obtain from the two Powers to enable her to preserve her neutrality, I presume that Your Highness alludes to the reciuest made by her for arms and money, ^.s to arms Your Highness is aware that whexi the question was first mootea neitiieh His Majesty's Government nor tliat of Russia was in a position to supply them, and on a review of the situation it is very much o^en to doubt whether in view of the dubious attitude of the Persian Government at the time it would have been prudent to give arms had they been a,vail able. As for financial assistance I must remind Your Highness that the two Powers informed the Cabinet of His Highness Prince Ain ed Dowleh more than a year ago of their readiness to comply; that the negotiations for the purpose wer not concluded till October can scarce 1 y be attributed to illwill on their part.

Cannot you procure Persian Government's 'formal acceptance of liability for ascertained losses 'and also devise with them plan for verifying the same 'and a method of ultimate payment? Telegraph your 'views fully.' I spoke to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in.the sense you mention and he said that the Persian Government would acknowledge responsibility if the British Minister permitted them to prosecute those who are known to have aided and abetted the robberies. The persons implicated at Kerman, Yezd and Isfahan are all Bakhtiari Chiefs who were Governors at the time those places were looted. I subsequently spoke to Mr. Marling but he strongly objects to the prosecution of the Bakhtiari Chiefs and points out that the central Government is directly responsible for all that happened under the Premiership of Mostofi-ul- Mamalek and other pro-German Ministers. His contention of course is quite correct, and his desire to leave the Bakhtiaris alone is in order to safeguard the Oil interests which would be greatly prejudiced were civil war to break out in that quarter.''' » ...U77U6/16. oune : ■'•nf , 1916. ,0. 6l - \ h fay Sir:- In reply to your letter to Mr. ullpiiaat of tne 16Ui iueUait, relative to the responsibility of the i ersian fao ferment for the losses entailed upon your rank by the looting and closing of several of their provincial branca&lt; a in I ersla, 1 a;n directed by secretary dir dward Grey to state that since the u&amp;te of the letter from yo\ir Chief -annger at lehran, enclosed in your above-mentioned corsnunication, his majesty ’s minister at lehran has been instructed to pres:- Uie e,a?:tia,.. i ersiaa Cabinet to sJ rdt their liability under Article b of the auk's concession.

THE IMPERIAL BANK OP PERSIA, (25540) 25, ABCHURCH LANE, . LONDON, E.C. ^ * 8th February, 1S16. Dear Mr. Oliphant;- I have made enquiries and am informed by our Bullion Brokers that there is at present no Bar Silver available in Shanghai, but Sycee Silver (about 980 fine) could be obtained in Shanghai, and the price to-day is about 27.375 pence per ounce f.o.b. Shanghai, or 27.562 c.i.f. Vladiovostock. I understand the time taken in transit from Shanghai to Petrograd would be four to five weeks. It might be possible to buy Bar Silver in Bombay and sent it to Teheran via Seistan, but I do not know how long Silver would take in transit from Bombay to Teheran, and 1 arn not sure that at the present time I can effect insurance by this route. I am making further enquiries of our Insurance * Brokers, and will let you know. In Mr. A.O. Wood's opinion, throughout the north of Persia, including the Seistan route, the risk is less now than in normal times, but I am doubtful if the Underwriters will regard it in that light. I enclose for information, copy of a Memor andum by our Bushire Manager, dated 2nd January, on the Political Situation in the south of Persia. Yours sincerely, (Signed) G. Newell. Manager. L. Oliphant, Esq., Foreign Office.Extract from Bushire Manager's letter dated BUSHIRE, 2nd January, 1916. _the:, south of p er^t/^ . Civil warfare is now taking place in Shiraz between the two rival factions, that is to say, the (fravain (the acting Governor) with his adherents, against the rebel Gendarmes and the Nationalists. The i^avam is stated to have a force of some 3,000 of his own tribesmen while the numbers of the Gendarmeri should not exceed a few hundreds but the latter are obviously better equipped than the other side. The 9 Nationalist party in Shiraz are said to number about 7,000 but a very small proportion are available as a fighting force. It is very difficult to ,get news as to which side is gaining and very conflicting reports are reaching Bushire; it has been rumoured that the Gavarn has been surrounded by the Gendarmerie and vice versa - but as far as can be ascertained, at the time of writing, the Gavam appears to be not only holding his own but is gaining the upper hand. Several hundred rebel Gendarmes have been hurriedly withdrawn from Tangistan and sent up to Shiraz with their guns - all Gendarmes at the various posts on the Shiraz road have also left for that place. The crux of the situation lies in the hands of the Saulat ed Dowleh, Chief of the powerful Kashkai tribe; his recent attitude has been doubtful owing to German bribes but, he is stated, with his force of 3,000 men, to have occupied a strategical position at Sineh Sefeed, 20 miles this side of Shiraz, with the object of preventing— 'W'' v H pr6vcnljirig, ccrncnlis P08cniiig 'ujb.8 G6rici&amp;iTjQ6'ri0 fioj; Boi ay jooi, , Ka zero on and the Bushire districts* The successful offensive of the Russians in the North will undoubtedly affect the South and Isfahan should he occupied hy them very shortlyj presumably the considerable number of Germans and Austrians there, will make for Shiraz, if the Gavam is unable to hold the place for the Persian Government. No news has been received lately from the prisoners at Ahram - last reports from them stated that they were all well. Further attacks have been ma.de during the past few days by the tribesmen on the British lines here; the enemy have suffered rather badly and our losses have been nil. W&amp;ssmuss left for Shiraz a week ago and a report has just come in that he has been surrounded, with his men, on the Shiraz road; by whom, it is not yet evident, but possibly by the Saulat ed Bowleh* On the whole, the situation is much brighter and a more optimistic outlook exists, which may very probably cause the early release of the British prisoners. (Signed) W. Forbes Manson. -V— T-'V L&gt; Finance Committee . 1. Perhaps we had better send an interim reply to Foreign Office that, before deciding whether to bear half the advance, we should like to know what reply the Treasury gives to Sir Eyre Crowe’s letter dated 24th January No,W.8874. 2. As it is very uncertain what amount will be drawn, if the advance is granted, there would be some advantage in taking out of our estimates the £171,500 now inserted in them. ^ //WW /6^vW' / ^ l , ,, , p • -i 3.

't .. commencing witli 40,000 already lying at the Bank for hhis A purpose. 1 imagine consent of Persian Government would have to be^obtained. I am personally averse from tnis course as we shculn presumably ixive to consult Russian Government who fur nished naif the money and who might at some later date quote transaction to justify affectation of sane of their monies to a purely Russian interest. Moreover Russian Min ister whom I sounded tentatively is opposed to it. As a temporary palliative we might induce Persian Government to legalise what has been general practise of Bank viz'‘bofh notes and deposit of any branch are payable only at that branch. This would relieve Teheran Office of immediate necessity to meet above liabilities;but Manager points out that Bank is meanwhile seriously crippled and tnat 4 for it to have to meet liabilities from reserve fund pending recovery of amount from Persian Government would entail further loss owing to fail in value of securities in wiii ch reserve i s ii;tv e s ted.

In any case bank is presumably ultimately responsible for the whole of its note issue. Per instance would bank in London be able to repudiate its notes if all its Persian offices were closed ? It appears to me therefore that it is only q, question of time and the sooner the bank here is in the position to meet its provincial liabilities the better for its credit. manager agrees in foregoing.

I an directed by rr^y Board to acknowledge receipt of your letter W. 3637/16 dated 11th instant, in regard, to a telegram which had been received by His Majesty’s Government frou uis Majesty’s minister at leheran, relative to Uie difficulties apprehended by our Manager in Teheran as to the necessity of meeting &amp;t Teheran the liabilities of our 1 rovincial Branches, which have been forcibly closed and looted, and inforaing us that His i ajesty's Representative at Teheran had suggested tiiat as a temporary palliation it might be possible to Induce the iersian Government to legalise what has hitherto been the general practice of this Bank, namely, to consider both the Notes and Deposits of any Branch of the Bank as payable only at that Branch, I may mention here that whilst retaining what we considered our legal rights, it has been our custora to cash Notes and Deposits at Teheran and Branches otherwise than at tae place of origin, and any departure from Mils custom is bound to have an adverse effect on our credit and prestige, especially with regard to Deposits. Notes and Deposits are not perhaps in one and trie same category The Under-secretary of etate, Foreign Office.category. hotes f tiie ter ib oi &gt;ur Concession, are payable only at the place of origin; nothing is definitely stated in regard to Deposits, and in our view it seems desirable to meet these, if possible, without delay. - The temporary palliative suggested by nis majesty’s hepreeentative might be a relief for a time, but sooner or later the main question of meeting these liabilities is bound to arise, and it will be fatal to our position and credit if wo are not fully prepared to discharge them- It is estimated that the liabilities of trie closed and looted Branches amount to roughly 18.1,717,000, more or less, viz., on Deposits Ts.673 t OQQ, and on Motes in Circulation, or looted fro i the Deserves, Ts.i,Q44,.ooo. The total liabilities expressed in sterling, at an exchange of say 5«: as a round rate, amount to about The suggestion that measures rniglit be taken by the Board to realise securities suxiicieno to meet these large liabilities has been carefully considered, but in the present position of affaire on trie Stock Exchange, such action, if attempted, would result in a serious lowering of prices. Bven if sales were practicable, whien we very mien doubt, they could only be at a sacriliee, which migiit quite possibly prove crippling to the Bank. We have a clear and definite claim against the Persian Government, who are bound to protect outour interests, by -article b of our Concession, which reads as follows ’’The object of this Bank as a National Institu tion being tiie public weal and good of the otate, the Government of ids Imperial ajesty the iGTiai:! accords to it the military protection whicii is indispensable to the safety of its heeid office and of its branches”, lending the satisfaction of tills claim, which, with the support of his Majesty’s Government on which we confidently rely, is bound sooner or later to be obtained, and in view also of the difficulties attending the realisation of securities, which we have just described, we venture to request that his Majesty’s Government should advance us from time to time as occasion may arise, the necessary funds i to meet the liabilities forced upon us. xis His Majesty’s Government is aware, the Imperial Bank of i ersia has suffered most severely at the hands of our counury’s enemies in lersia, and should we be called upon to meet, without the financial assistance of His Majesty’s Government, the losses occasioned by theee acts of brigandage t the burden may be possibly beyond our power to support.

Manager of Hie Tape rial Bank of Persia informs me that he ig faced with difficulty of meeting here in Teheran liabilities of Bank’s provincial branches that nave been looted or closed. Liabilities amount in round figures to over tomans 1,717,000 vis: notes in circula tion or looted from reserve, tomans 1,044,000 and de posits tomans 673,000 that is in sterling about £340,000. Manager considers that ne has a valid claim against Persian Government and suggests that Bank in London should oe allowed to attach monies paid into it by His Majesty’s Government on account of retroactive effect of moratorium commencing with 40,000 already lying at the Bank for rids purpose.I imagine consent of Persian Government would have to be ^obtain ed. I am personally averse from this course as we should presumably lave to consult Russian Government who fur nished naif the money and who might at some later date quote transaction to justify affectation of seme of their monies to a purely Russian interest. Moreover Prussian Min ister whom I sounded tentatively is oprosed to it. As a temporary palliative we might Induce Persian government to legalise what has been general practise of Bank via 'both notes and deposit of any branch are payable curly at that branch. This would relieve Teheran Office of immediate necessity to meet above liabilities out Manager points out that Bade is meanwhile seriously crippled and tha-tyfor it to lave to meet liabilities from reserve fund pending recovery of amount from Persian Government would entail further loss owing to fail in value of securities ii irnen^reserve is invested. I suggest you should discuss with London board what measures can be taken to assist Bank whose (?grouo omitted' here is so essential to us politically.suaniA- ffiLUIGAU Decypher Sir G, Buchanan (Petrcgrad) Jan. 4th, D, 9.20 pm January 4th.

Any proposals based on import of silver from Over seas do not offer practical solution since this would entail a minimum delay of two months. Moreover £20,000,000 of gold is to be exported from Russia in any case, and I do not see how Russian Government can reasonably oDject to a comparatively small proportion of this export being diverted to Persia. Introduction of gold standard as a temporary ex pedient could hardly constitute a permanent drain on our gold resources since sufficient silver could be im ported into Persia as soon as practicable. Your Excellency should place these considerations before Minister for Foreign Affairs and urge him to reconsider his decision.

It is particularly imp or '.an u to make Farman Farma secure, and sole means of doing so Is by having Russian troops within reach of Tehran. To occupy Teheran unless essential for protection of Legations might precipitate departure of Shan, who is already at Ferabad, outside Tehran, and of some, if not, all, of Persian Government, but troops should be near enough to prevent Gendarmerie and Germans occupying and becoming masters of Tehran.
