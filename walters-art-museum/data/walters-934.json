The back is high and is carved in a detailed, deeply incised design. The piece is simply made and the workmanship is good. \r\n\r\nThe scarab functioned as a provider-individualized amulet, and was originally mounted or threaded. The amulet should secure the necessary rituals for the god, and provide its owner with his divine protection. It is possible that the owner of the scarab was involved in the rituals, and had a priestly function. \r\n\r\nThe combination of a divine figure with an offering table does not belong to the standard repertoire.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/39686", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "20th Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2009-09-11T09:35:05.56", "Creator": "Egyptian (?)", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.63_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.63_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.63_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.63_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.63_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1522053, 1543485", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "CUR_42.63_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.63_Bot_DD_design_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.63_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.63_Rt_DD_RS2009.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
