PROVINCE OF OMAN. The two Arab tribes, Hinavi and Ghafiri, are the most prominent in the annals of the Province of Oman ; the Yarabi and the Syudi, to which last belong the family of the present Imaums, being both but branches merely of the Hinavi. From the Ghafiri the Joasim are descended. The following historical paragraphs are from authentic sources of Arabian Tradition. Malik bin Fakham, of the Province of Nujd, the first native Arabian who entered Oman, four centuries before the Christian era, came by the route of Yemen, where he was joined by little more than a hundred persons of the Hinavi Tribe of Arabs, who were desirous of following his fortunes. Malik was of a liberal disposition, and an intrepid mind, the union of which qualities commanded the admiration and obedience of his followers. The first settlement of these colonists was at Bahla, or, according to others, at Jaalan, two towns of the Dhahirah, or interior portion of the Province of Oman, south-westward of Muskat about seventy miles. Here they encountered and overcame the troops of the Persian Mo narch, and subsequently fortified the ancient city of Rastag, situated in the central or mountainous district of Oman, thirty miles westward of Muskat. . „ . These colonists were shortly increased, by the accession of two hun dred persons of Malik's tribe, the Bann Honaifali of Nujd, and a second company of two thousand of the Hinavi from Yemen, who were attract ed by the fame and increasing power of this chieftain. Successive addUions of the same and other tribes, to the numbers of these Arabs, enabled them at length to expel the Persians from rt ' e P 10 '''! 'thigh not without severe and obstinate resistance on tl ,e part of their enemy, who received repeated reinforcements of tioops Ma kat length died, after having possessed Oman fm forty yea,* and was interred at Zaki, a town in the central divi.ion of Oman, about4 oman. five-and-twenty miles to the westward of Muskat. This chieftain left behind him four sons, and a numerous clan of adherents, in the indivi duals of the tribes of Honaifah and Ilinavi, whom he had with consum mate policy united by the indissoluble ties of intermarriage, and collectively named Hinavi; wishing thus to commemorate the aid the superior numbers, constancy, and valour of this tribe had afforded in the attainment of his earliest successes. In the third year of the reign of his eldest son, who succeeded to the government, a thousand men of the tribe of Obar, passing out of Nujd, settled in the interior portion of Oman, in a plain, open spot of land ; and from this circumsfance received and retained the appellation Banu Ghafir, the ancestors of the present tribe Ghafiri. Zaid, the son of Malik, noticed this infringement of their territory, but as he was assured by the strangers, in answer, that they considered themselves as subjects and dependents on his power, he admitted them at length to his piotection, and in course of time identified them, by intermarriage with the clan Hinavi. The sons and descendants of Malik continued thus in the enjoyment of power until the birth of the Mahomedan Prophet ( a. d. 571), when one of these, named Jalanda, a powerful and enterprising prince, first constructed a fleet, with which he seized on the island of Ormus, from the Persians, and established it as the naval rendezvous of a fleet of boats, which he gradually habituated to the pursuit of piracy. Prince Jalanda dying after a reign of forty years (a. d. 615), in the first year of the Prophet's mission, his two sons reigned in succession T.n'^ei wi ,ed an&lt; , i T al aUltlOTi, y- the year of the Mission { • • 621) they and a large portion of their subjects were converted to (!

In the end of the seventeenth century Imaum Malik, of the house of Yarabi, a branch of the Tribe Hinavi, was master of all Oman, and added to his dominions, by conquest, Kung, Kishm, Ormus' and Bahrein. His son extended these conquests still further, by taking possession of Kiloa, and Zanzibar in Africa, But in the reign of his grandson, Ben Suif, the new Monarch of Persia, Nadir Shah, sent an army to conquer Oman. The Persians lost many of their number among the hills, and were repulsed. Ben Suif accord ingly continued to occupy the throne till his death. Upon his decease, Mahomed Ghafiri, Prince of Jabrin, made himself master of the greater part of Oman, and assumed the title of Imaum. His son, A1 Nasir, proved unable to maintain the conquest of his father. Suif-il-Asdi, son to the last Imaum of the family of Yarabi, made him self be proclaimed Imaum, and forced Nasir to content himself with his patrimony, the principality of Jabrin. Imaum Suif-il-Asdi was an indolent, voluptuous prince. Not con tent with a numerous Harem, he would occasionally attempt the chastity of the daughters of his subjects. He addicted himself to the use of wine and strong liquors, neglected his affairs, and not paying his soldiers, who were Kafree slaves, suffered them to harass and pillage his subjects. This conduct rendered him so odious, that Sultan Mur- shid, one of his relations, easily succeeded in getting himself proclaimed Imaum, and took possession of almost all Oman. Muskat, however, still remained in allegiance to Imaum Suif ; and he maintained himself in it, by means of four ships of war, and of the profits of its trade, but becoming yet more odious to the few subjects who still obeyed him, by perseverance in his imprudent conduct, he soon found it impossible to prolong his authority. In this extremity he resolved rather to yield up his dominions to the Persians than to his relation Imaum Murshid. Sailing to Persia, therefore, with some vessels which still remained to him, he obtained from Nadir Shah a fleet, under the command of Mirza Taki Khan, Governor of Shiraz. The Persian Admiral, upon arriving in Oman, enticed Imaum Suif into a fit of drunkenness, and seized Muskat, with its citadels. Suif, not knowing what lo do, puisued his rival Murshid with the Persian forces, till, reduced to despair by the loss of his friends, he died a voluntary death. Imaum Suif died soon after at Rastag, oppressed with the mortification of finding himself duped by the Persians. _ tvt t cu i i Taki Khan, on his return to Shiraz, revolted against Nadir Shah, an sought to establish himself in the sovereignty of Farsistan, It is well cG oman. known how the Persian Monarch quashed this rebellion, and punished its author. These, disturbances withdrew the attention of the Persians from the affairs of Arabia, and made them neglect to keep up the gar rison in Muskat. At the period of Taki Khan's expedition into Oman, there was at Sohar a governor of the name of Ahmed bin Sueed, a native of a small town within the Imaum's dominions. This Ahmed, being a man of ability and enterprise, and seeing that after the death of the two Imaums he should be under the necessity of submitting to such potent enemies as the Persians, made his peace with the invaders so ably that Faki Khan confirmed him in his government. During the civil wars in Persia, a Prince of Dhang, of the house of Yaiabi, the Prince of Sir, and a nobleman named Bel Arrab, had shared among themselves the spoils of the last Imaum ; Bel Arrab had even assumed the title. Ahmed, seizing the Persian officers in Muskat by surprise, forced the garrison to surrender, and made himself master of the city, without any 0 U f T 0n r 0 blood - Gai ning to his interest the first Kadhi, who officiates as Mufti in Oman, he obtained from him a decision that he, as the deliverer of his country, deserved to be raised to the dignity of its sovereign. In virtue of this decision, Ahmed was proclaimed, at Muskat, Imaum of Oman. A S soon as Imaum Bel Arrab heard this news, he prepared to attack us rival, with an army of four or five thousand men. Ahmed, too weak i resistance, retired into a fortress among the hills, in which he was invested hy lus enemy, and would have been obliged to surrender himself, had he not happily escaped in the disguise of a camel-driver Being beloved in his former government, he found means to assemble ■ ill. hundreds of men, and with these marched against Bel Arrab w lose army was still encamped among the hills. He divided his little troops into detachments, who seized the passes of the valleys an d sounded their trumpets. Bel Arrab, supposing himself to be drcum alt; struck with a ^ ^ none of Oman, except a son of Imaum Murshid who ma le ' unsuccessful efforts to deprive him of the sovereign amhoTtv n T withstanding these attempts, the Imaum yielded no to his •' l i town of Nahhel, with the territory belonging to i 1 t ,1 two sons of the last Imaum of the ancient f-tmilv ' I've in a private station, but in circumstances so op,lnT'hT.I ^ were able to maintain three or four hundred slaves' TheOMAN. ^ Imaum mairied the daughter of one of those princes, thus connecting- his own family with the most illustrious persons of his dominions. Ahmed now turned to the conquest of the people of Ras-ool-Khyma, descendants of the Ghafiri, who had aided the Persians in their views. He attacked them in a. h . 1160 ( a. d . 1747), by land and sea, with an army of twelve thousand men, under the command of Kandhalabin Suif, of the family of Sueed, who was met at Boraimi by Rashid bin Matar, the Joasim, and Amrar bin Homaid, the Noaimi (a large tribe south of Shargah, the pirate port), at the head of an army of fourteen thousand men, which met with a total defeat. Ahmed was at this time engaged in the siege of Khurfakhan, a town and port in the Batinah, in lat. 25° 20' N., with a fleet of eight ships, and forty of the larger description of Native vessels. The garrison of this fort was composed of one thousand Joasim, who, when they heard the fate of their brethren, gave up the fort, and, entreating the clemency of their conqueror, were permitted to return to Sir. The ambition and exertions of Ahmed daily increased. He pushed his conquests as far as Khasab, the governor of which place, Hassan bin Abdoolla, the Shihiyyin, who was formerly subject to the Joasim, submitted voluntarily to his government. During a residence of ten days in the town of Khasab, he received the alarming intelligence of the revolt of a member of the house of Yarabi Jaalan. His measures were decided : he directed his cousin, Khalfan bin Mirhamad, to proceed to Ras-ool-Khyma, with the great body of his fleet, and returned himself to Muskat with three ships, to attend to the suppression of the revolt. After a delay of only four days, he proceeded to Jaalan, and attacking the rebels, overthrew them with considerable bloodshed, and took, a large number of prisoners. This occurred in a. h . 1162 ( a. d . 1749). Khalfan, after repeated attempts, found he could make no impression on the Joasim. Ahmed proceeded thither in person, and after remaining for four days in the town of Ramse, returned to Muskat by land, and despatched Ali bin Suif, the Syudi, with four ships and ten Dows, directing him to cruize against the ports of Sir, with the utmost rigour, until they submitted to his authority. Ali followed up these orders so strictly, in face of Ras-ool-Khyma, Jazerat-ool-Hamra, Fasht, and Shargah, not permitting a boat to attempt the pearl fishery or a commercial voyage, that the inhabitants of all these places, with the exception of the first, were redaced to the last extremity, and obliged to acknowledge the supremacy of the Imaum, a . n. 1176 ( a. d. 1763). The Chiefs of Ras-ool-Khyma bore the blockade for a year longer, at the end of which time three of these, Sugur bin Rashid, Mahomed bin Ali, and Abdoolla bin Matar, proceeded to Rastag, to Imaum Ahmed,8 OMAN. and entreated that they might be relieved from the persecuting attacks of AH bin S uif; that he would be satisfied with complete possession of the other towns, and allow them to enjoy the revenues of Ras-ool-Khyma, as a stipend for the support of the chiefs of their tribes. The Imaum granted their petition, and favoured them with gifts, and robes of honour. In this state affairs remained till the Imaum's decease, a. h . 1185 ( a. d . 1771). During two years after the succession of his son Sueed, the affairs of the l iinavi languished. In a. d . 1775, the Joasim attacked the whole of Sir, and took possession of Jazerat-ool-Hamra and Shargah, and Ramse and Khurfakhan also, a. h. 1189. Jaud, the son of Sueed, dispossessed his father of power, and in a. h . 1200 ( a. d . 1786) advanced against the Joasim, and re-took Ivhui fakhan and Jazerat-ool-Hamra, and besieged Ramse. He left Mahomed bin Khalfan in charge of the naval armament, and proceeding himself by land to the southward, reached Jabal -ool-Akhdhar, where, after some little stay, he died. To this prince succeeded his uncle Sultan bin Ahmed bin Sueed, a weak and incompetent ruler, in whose reign the Joasim re -possessed themselves of all Sir, except Khasab, and the other towns of the Shihiyyin. The successor of this prince was his nephew Badr bin Halal, who ound himself overpowered by the increased strength of the Joasim who had become sectaries of the Wahabee faith, and were supported by the arms of its Head. The power of piracy was now daily gaining vigour, when Badr was murdered, and gave room for the succession of his nephew Sueed bin Sultan, the present Imaum, who has continued to lose his influence and territorial possession on every side. This historical abstract shows that the Hinavi, of which tribe the Yarabi and Syudi were branches, were the first Arabian settlers in man; tiiat the Ghafin, of which the Joasim are a branch, entered the province after the power of the Hinavi was perfectly established • that they submitted to the dominion of these ; and that the Hinavi retained the supremacy over the whole of Oman, with few intervals of supersession, from the age of Imaum Malik, the founder of the Arab power in this province, till nearly the close of the eighteenth century I he Province of Oman extends from Ras-ool-Hud to the extremity of the ports of the Beniyas, and covers nearly two thousand square miles. It is divided into four districts,-Sir, Dhahirah, Hajar, and Balmah The district of Sir extends from Musseldom to the end of the demht and Tfif! 18 ' al0nS ^ Al ' abian 0f the Persia ' Gulf - ^ tieptn inland of fifty or sixty miles.2 OMAN. 9 Diiahirah. The district of Dhahirah, or the interior, has for its northernmost boundaries Sir and Ras-ool-Khyma, and contains the following towns, and inferior dependencies :—Boraimi, Ghabbi, Obra, Dhang, JBahla^ Naziva, Jaalan, Sir, and Madrikah. The part of this district lying between Bahla, Naziva, and Madrikah is called the eastern division, or Baladoosh Shargiyyah. Hajar. The second midland district, Hajar, or the Rocky, occupies a chain of mountains, extending north and south through the centre of the Province of Oman, commencing at Muskat, and terminating in the sea at the promontory of Ras-ool-Jabal. It contains the towns and lord ships of Rastag, the ancient capital of Oman ; Jabal-ool-Akhdhar, Sama-il-Badbad, Hajar, and Dabba. Batinah. The third, or maritime division, called Batinah, is situated between Hajar and the sea. Tt is very fertile, and abounds in vegetable productions, and fruits of all kinds; and is well watered by running streams. It contains the towns and lordships of Sohar, Shinas, Mudhliah, Birkah, and Muskat.* Tribes of Oman. The tribes of Oman are the Banu Noaimi, of 20,000 effective men, most of whom are shepherds, and live south-westward of Boraimi. A division of these, 400 in number, is settled at Ayman, near Shargah ; Beni Katab, 8,000, within two days of Boraimi; Beni Kaab, 4,000, a branch of the Noaimi, dwell in Dhahirah, near Obra, one day to the eastward of it; Durua, 20,000, in Hajar, near Jabal-ool-Akhdhar, half a day to the north of this place ; Ali Wahaibah, 30,000, twelve miles south of Rastag; Beni Mohair, 1,000 men, one day inland south of Shargah ; Matarish, 500 men, nine miles south of Boo Haile, in the interior. MUSKAT, AND THE ADJOINING COUNTRY. Muskat, the capital and commercial emporium of the Imaum's possessions, is situated in lat. 23° 28 N., long. o9 0 19 E. Muskat is surrounded by steep rocks, on whose rugged superficies * Mutrah is the best watering -place ; but water is also to be had on almost any part of this coast.10 musk at burka. not a sign of vegetation is to be seen. These, however, form its chief security; bearing on their sides and summits forts and towers impregnable except to heavy cannon, and accessible only by the narrowest paths. The town, built close to the water's edge, is walled towards the interior, and may be defended against the Arabs ; but should the enemy gain a footing within the mountain passes, it would be in their power to intercept the supply of water, which is drawn from a deep well at the distance of half a mile from Muskat, and is thence conveyed, by an aqueduct, to a reservoir near the cove, where, at high- water, casks conveyed in a ship's boat may be replenished. Although Muskat, both by nature and art, is strong towards the land side, little difficulty would probably be experienced, by a small force, in cutting out of the port, or destroying by fire, all vessels which might anchor there. Refreshments are procurable in tolerable plenty; fish in great abundance , the beef and mutton, too, arc of a very good quality The town of Muskat, from the want of a free circulation of air, and the proximity of a swamp, is very unhealthy ; while the coasts of Persia and Arabia in general are, fortunately, the reverse. The atmosphere in this climate, during summer, is intensely hot, but being free from moisture, and hence not admitting of the occurrence of disease, is supportable ; in the winter months the temperature of the air is delightful. Muskat Road is open, the water deep, and the bottom loose and rocky, indeed it is one of the most insecure anchorages existing The cove affords better shelter, but even this is not a desirable situation tor a ship, as the north-west winds blow directly into it ■ vet the underlow prevents ships from riding with a heavy strain on'their cables. About six miles NW.by W. of Muskat lies Muskat Island • it has deep water on all sides, within which a frigate may pass at the dis tance of hall a cable, carrying fourteen and a half fathoms. The Beloochees call it Ringole, and the Arabs Fahel. Standing to the westward, the barren hills of Muskat are left behind ofdatetreeT PreSemS a Sandy, ^ SU^faCe, COVeled With P la n^tions' Burka. Twelve or thirteen leagues W.byN. of Muskat lies Burka the summer residence of His Highness the Imaum of Muskat, wh.eh is e ended by a fortified work, originally constructed by the Portuguese but having no d.teh; and being, in consequence, untenable for six hourj XHeme'^fhLr' 6 merely f • 0 ^ the Arab States, entertain a high opinion of its strength. It in fact commandsKHURFAKHAN THE INTERIOR. 11 the whole of Batinah, or lowland region to the southward of Sink, and as the town is situated within a day's journey of the entrance into Dhahirah, it of necessity becomes a place of considerable trade, and communication with that quarter. Within its environs, grapes are procurable during five, and fresh dates for six months of the year; and in their respective seasons mangoes and guavas, peaches and apricots, melons and plantains, may be purchased through the year. As the ground in Burka roads is loose, it becomes necessary that ships should anchor in a position which will enable them to clear the shore, under sail, in the event of parting from their cables. Six islands north-westward of Burka are called Sawardi, and seven others, to the eastward, are termed Damani ; on the easternmost of the Sawardi islands, which are perfectly barren, there is a brackish well, cut deep in the rock; it possesses, too, a good harbour; nor is the navigation dangerous, except between the westernmost island and the shore. Khurfakhan. Leaving Burka, and passing a group of islets, bearing its name, the coast hollows into a deep bay, Khurfakhan, in lat. 25° 20 / N. It is covered with date trees, has a sandy beach, and is free from danger. The lowland continues several miles, to the foot of mountains, which rise to a great height, on the tips of some of which snow has been seen in the month of January. At various distances along the shore, of from five to ten miles, are seen villages and towns, many of which are defended by a solitary tower. The soundings on this coast are regular, but it is nevertheless not advisable to approach the shore in the months of November, December, and January, during the prevalence of the strong south-east winds peculiar to this season of the year; indeed this coast is without the regular track of ships passing between the western side of India and the Persian Grulf. The Interior. We will now pass from this delineation of the line ol coast to a de scription of the interior portions of the same extent of country. The chainof elevated rocks which overhang the town, having nearly enclosed the cove of Muskat, recedes from the sea, and from the boundary of the «andy plain of Mattrah, to the extent of ten miles, as measured along 'their semicircular base ; and at five miles from hence forms the narrow pass of Riu, which, independent of occasional watch-towers erected along the line of approach, over the rocks, is fortified by a mud wall and ramparts, in which there is a gateway suffieiently eommod.ous. At this point, the ehain separates into two ridges, one of which recedes towards the Dhahirah, and the other, approaching the ocean during a12 sohar. course of four miles, at length enters it, and forms the Point Kurnah. The inland ridge, after shaping a vast and lofty amphitheatre, bedded with sand, broken into rough stony ground near its base, presents a bold and precipitous boundary to the Persian Gulf near Amsandam, This plain is called Batinah, to distinguish it from Hajar, or the hilly country, and is productive of dates, clover, maise, barley, the indigo plant, and all the tropical fruits and vegetables ; much inferior, however in flavour and quantity to those reared in Hajar ; the former is artificially irrigated by numerous wells, while the cultivated tracts of the latter abound in springs of water, and are intersected by rivulets. The Native inhabitants of Batinah invariably present a countenance deeply tinged with the yellow hue of disease, and a gaunt, meagre form. Ethiopians and Hindoos, however, enjoy better health in this unfavour able region. To re-touch in detail the sketch of the tract of country we have just examined, it remains to be observed, that from Muskat to Sir, with the exception of the flat on which Mattrah is situated, the whole interven- ing space is occupied by an unbroken mass of rocks far distant from the sea. Thence, however, to Burka and Shinas, the country opens into a semicircular plain, extending, in depth, for nearly two days' journey, towards the foot of its stupendous boundary, and admitting throughout of favourable cultivation. From Shinas to Khurfakhan, the mountains encroach so considerably on the lowland as only to leave occasional sandy hollows for the labours of the husbandman ; but icnce to Ras-ool-Jabal the waves lash their base, and the enormous mass, ascending perpendicularly above the ocean, admits of a shin passing directly beneath its pinnacle. Sohar, Shinas Castle, Khurfakhan, and Dabba. To return to the point whence we digressed, we must remark Sohar a town in lat. 24° 21' N., about twenty-two leagues NW by W from Castle, in lat 24' 45' N T lemakable s P ot we reach is Shinas direction To tVT ' ' ^ stant nearl y nine leagues in a NNW 35° 20' N ■ i succeeds the small cove of Khurfakhan, in lat journey, aires' thT'cape! wMcttle'^ ^ 2 contributes to form the L'rrow entrtro^c P^Guif 6 ^ ^ The Oman. r ul!d e by 0 thc an tw e o X t t rTb d es HTnavfanToh^^ t0 RaS - 0ol - Kh y ma . and is fealty to the Chiefs of the house of Syu^, bei:^^^^^MUSSELDOM AMSANDAM. 13 Irom Ras-ool-Hud to Dabba ; and the last, under their Lords of the branch Qawasim, possesses the remainder of the extent, from the lastmentioned place as far as Ras-ool-Khyma. Cape Musseldom, and Amsandam Island. The cape or promontory above mentioned is called by the Natives Musseldom, and is formed by a chain of rocky mountains, commencing on its eastern side, in about lat. 25° SS' N., and terminating in the sea at the headland of this name. The whole of this promontory is deeply indented with wide fissures, and affords several secure anchor ages. A large island, admitting a creek named Amsandam, which is situated in lat, 26° 22' SO 7 N., directly north-east of the promontory, forms, with the main, a channel impassable to ships from its extreme narrowness, whose depth, however, is never less than sixteen fathoms. It has undoubtedly been riven asunder from the rocky main in some convulsion of nature, to its extreme point. The Natives have given it the name of Ras-ool-Jabal, and British navigators that of Cape Musseldom. Amsandam is intersected by a creek running inwards for a day's journey, and its inhabitants are a part of the tribe Shihiyyin, consisting of three thousand men, who profess Mahomedanism, but are un observant of its forms and ceremonies to the last degree, and, in fact, will entertain no religious instructors. The Chief of the Wahabees was long unable to convert them to their systems of either religion or piracy, nor would they pay him tribute. Their language is different from that of the other tribes, and as there are many individuals among them remarkable for the redness of their hair, it may fairly be concluded, as the Arabs declare, that their language is formed from corruptions of the dialects of their Portuguese and Danish ancestors, engrafted on an impure stock of the Arabic. Both these nations have settlements on Amsandam, and also at Khasab, a bay to the westward of the promontory, on the main, where there was, and exists also at present, a flourishing manufactory of cloth, of a peculiar sort, which has long been used as wrappers for head and loins throughout the two shores of the Gulf. Khasab, too, is said to contain descendants of the Portuguese, in the humble capacity of fishermen. Three small islands, or rather large rocks, dry and barren, he to the northward of Cape Musseldom, and are by the Arabs named Salamah. The northernmost, in lat. 26° 29' 30' N., is ten miles distant from the cape, and lies due north from the east end of Amsandam, which lies in lat. 26° 22' 30'' N. The water near the rocks is deep, and the chan nel between them and the main wide, and free from danger. The tides, however, run here with considerable, and even dangerous rapidity. The Ghanam Islands lie off Khasab.14 PIRATE PORTS. T ribe S hihiyyin. From this cape to the first pirate port at Ramsej on a line of coast of little more than fifteen leagues in extent, lie, at small distances from each other, five towns belonging to the Tribe Shihiyyin, who also possess Amsandam to the eastward of the cape. These towns are named Dar Sinni, Khasab, Jadi, Jnlfar, and Boka. From Amsandam to Dar Sinni is three Furseekhs to the south ; thence to Khasab four ; thence to Jadi two ; and lastly to Boka four. Of these Khasab is now the largest; and Julfar, at which the Portuguese once entertained an establishment, protected by a fort, for the purpose of pearl fishing, is the next in size. They are occupied by the stationary and more civilized part of the tribe, who are employed in pearl fishing, in trade, and in agriculture. Their food consists of dates, wheat, barley, meat, and fish, in abundance. The remainder of the tribe is employed in gaining a precarious livelihood, by fishing in the small bays on the coast, or in the islands at the head of the cape, or else, in the character of pastoral Arabs, wandering over the arid and barren rocks of the interior portion of this country, which afford a scanty supply of burnt vegetation for their flocks. These people live on milk and cheese, and dates also, and some little fish, which they procure from their lowland clansmen on the coast, in exchange for the produce of their flocks, which are numerous. The male adults of this tribe are said to amount to fourteen thousand; are the constant and persevering enemies of the Joasim, friendly to Muskat, and easily conciliated. Their pearl fishery is worth 3,000 Tomans yearly, and they have a fleet of two hundred and fifty small boats. PIRATE PORTS. R amse, &amp;c. Hence we enter on the Pirate Ports at Ramse, southward of Mussel- dom, in lat. 25° 33 / N., at two days' journey from Khasab. The town is composed of four hundred houses, under the government of Shaikh Abdurrahman bin Saleh, of the Tribe Tannay ; and hence to Mahhara, a small village of a hundred houses, under Hussan bin Ali Tannaiye, is four Furseekhs. Two miles off shore is here found a depth of four and a half fathoms ; the anchorage is in four and a half fathoms, sand, with Ramse town SE.byE. three miles, and Ras-ool -Khyma six miles distant. Now the chain of rocky mountains, which formed the promontory ofPIRATE PORTS. ] g Ras-ool-Jabal, retires from the sea, forming low sandy plains, and the depth of water begins to decrease. F;om hence to Shargah the coast is generally low, and thinly planted with date trees, and full of shallow creeks, well calculated to afford protection to the peculiarly constructed boats of the pirate tribes. That of Ramse is particularly safe, from a bar at its entrance, on which the surf breaks heavily. To ships it were hazardous to approach this coast during the prevalence of a north-west wind, lest they become embayed ; no danger, however, is apparent to the eye between Mussel- dom and Boo Haile, a line of shore nearly thirty leagues in extent. The whole of this southern shore of the Gulf, which is very imperfectly known, even by tradition, to European hydrographers, is said to abound in shoals, with a bottom generally of coral and sand, and bear ing, as far as Grane, in lat. 29° 12' N., beds of the richest pearls in the universe. Ras-ool-Khyma. At a distance of seven miles further, lat. 25° 48' N., and long. 56° 4' E. we reach Ras-ool-Khyma, the centre of the Pirate Ports, and their chief town, containing a thousand houses. It bears SW. J W. from the Great Quoin, about fifty-five miles distant. The town is situated on a point of land projecting into the sea, in a north-east direction, and terminating in a bank, extending itself parallel with the coast to the westward, at the distance of two and two and a half miles off shore, with two, two and a quarter, and two and a half fathoms, hard sand, upon it. Within this point is a deep, narrow bay, which first takes a south-westerly direction, to the back of the town, along which the Dows and larger boats are sheltered, and hence proceeds further inwards in a south-easterly line. The entrance to the bay is shallow, and impeded by a strip of land, extending obliquely from the point towards the opposite shore, and forming a bar on which, at spring tides, there is scarcely eleven feet water, although at these periods there is a rise of six feet above the usual level. Small vessels, however, or gun boats, drawing not more than three feet water, may advance within pis tol-shot of the beach, and much within point-blank range of the town; but it is not safe for vessels of fourteen feet draught to approach under two and a half or three miles. The best anchorage is six fathoms, soft sand, the Point bearing SE. about four miles. Amulgavine, Ejman, &amp;c. Eleven miles SW. by W.i W. of Ras -ool-Khyma is situated a small, low, sandy island, containing four hundred houses, defended by bastions, erected in the most commanding positions. It is Insular only at high-16 PIRATE PORTS. water, as at other times the western end is nearly connected with the main, and is called by the Arabs Jazirat-ool-Hamra. Anchorage in three fathoms, sand ; with extreme of Hamra from Ras-ool -Khyma ENE. to SW. ; centre of the town SE. Between this and Shargahlie the small ports and villages of Amulgavine, Ejman, and Fasht, all defended by towers held by musketeers. The first of these intermediate places consists of a group of four villages, containing together dwellings, belonging to the tribe Ahli Ali, under Shaikh Majed bin Sultan, 'it lies four leagues SW. by W. of the Jazira, between which and Shargah (which lies in lat. 25° 24' N., eleven leagues south-west of that place) the coast, at five miles from Amulgavine, takes a more southerly direction. Shargah. Shargah has five fathoms at a quarter of a mile off shore ; the anchor age is with the town and fort from ESE. to SE., distant three miles, in seven fathoms. It is defended by towers, without cannon, and a frigate may approach to within two cables length of the shore, to the westward of the town ; but as the soundings are irregular, it is probable there are hidden dangers. The piratical Dows lie in a small lagoon to the westward of the town. A bank of sand, thrown up along this coast by the violence of the sea, forms a good parapet for the Native matchlockmen. Boo Haile. Three leagues south-west of Shargah lies Boo Haile, a town of two lundred houses, defended by towers, under Shaikh Ali Mahomed of the tribe Matarish. ' Khor Hussan. At two days hence are the Khiran Beniyas, or ports lying along an 'f rl! ' J ;0aSt m Shar g ah to Huailah, a station one day's jonrney south o Khor Hussan, a port and town near the island of Bahrein, on 'which vdlages are V cry thinly scattered for two days'journey along the sea shore. This district stretches inland also for the same distance. The Beniyas. fhc Beniyas are a pastoral clan, of the province of Oman. Thev inhabit a part of its northernmost district, called Sir, which is of a verv sandy, barren soil. It i s divided into three branches • one called the^nr 8 '™ 0 Manasir ' and a 'hird Owaimir.

They do not commit, piracies on the high seas, but take advantage of the approach of the smallest boats to their coast, and seize them ; for which reason their conduct is not so openly stigmatized as that of the other inhabitants of Sir. They have small date groves dispersed among their sand hillocks, which yield a scanty supply of ruit, and amidst which they live during the summer, until their crop is consumed. In this season, the water is very brackish, and in the wintry months the shepherds ascend Lahsa and Qutar, to find pasture for their cattle. They can furnish twenty thousand excellent musketeers. Huailah. Huailah lies to the southward, by one day's journey, of Khor Hassan, and is a small station of Baddoos. Its maritime population exists by pearl fishing, while that of the interior follows the occupation of hus bandmen, and are less impoverished than their clansmen on the sea coast. Zukhirah. The port Zukhirah, under Shaikh Nasir bin Salmin, in common with the other ports of the Arabian shore, fish for pearls. Khor Hassan. From hence three days' journey lies Khor Hassan, the former retreat of Shaikh Rahmah bin Jabir Yalahimi, a tribe derived from Nujd. The town is composed of 400 houses, among which his own is conpicuous, from its height, and from the upper story bearing the appearance of a fortification, pierced with loopholes for the convenience of musketry. Towers, too, are erected for its defence. The port within has two fathoms at high-water, and two or three feet at low-water. Ships cannot approach nearer than two or three miles, but the large Native boats come within musket-shot of the shore. The anchorage is rocky, and exposed to the north-west wind, which excites a tremendous swell. Within the space of twelve hours, five thousand Baddoos may be marched down from the interior to defend the coast. Zobara. Near this is the port of Zobara, the inhabitants of which are allied to those of Khor Hassan ; it has a town of 400 houses. Ogair. Ogair lies opposite to the island of Bahrein, and may be esteemed the chief seaport of the Wahahees. A custom house, at which all imports direct for Lahsa and Dareyah are landed, is established at this place, as their conveyance to their several destinations by land is thus 318 PIRATE POHTS. greatly shortened. All merchandize pays here ten per cent., date grounds and agricultural produce generally twenty per cent. It ean boast of only forty or fifty dwellings. Hence to Dareyah six days, during two of which no water is procurable. Kateef, &amp;c. Fiom Ogaii to Kateef two days. This is a considerable seaport town r whither merchandize is brought for the interior of Arabia. A strong fort defends the town and port, and from fifty to sixty villages are scattered, at some distance from each other, containing individually about two hundred houses. From Ogair to Kateef the inhabitants are Aiabs of the Uttoobee tribe; and thence to Grane is a sandy tract of country, inhabited by Baddoos. Ti.e territory intervening between Huailah and Kateef is called Beri Gattar. From Kateef to Fantas, near Grane, is half a day. From Grane the district is called Adan, and is inhabited by Baddoos ; opposite to which lies the island of Jarim on the banks of which the Amaeer tribe of Arabs fish for pearls from'spring to autumn, and during the rest of the year lead a pastoral life. The tribes inhabiting the Pirate Ports are allied, by common descent, to those Arab families who subsist under the Persian Government, on the opposite shore, at the ports of Tahiri, Aseeloo, Naabund, Congoon, Nakheeloo, Cheeroo, Charak, Sertes, Mogoo, Bastion, Shinas, Lingah, and Koong. Of these stations, Charak has shown itself most hostile to us ; the rest are comparatively innocent ; which in them, and indeed m every petty tribe of the Gulf, results rather from weakness and a dread of our power than from a deficiency of inclination to a life of piracy, or a conviction of its lawless character. , 0f &lt; tbe ( COast on which these ports are situated, and their islands, Captain Seton, formerly Resident at Muskat, speaks as follows : Of those islands in the Persian Gulf whioh arc known our navigators t le greater part have wood, water, antelopes, and wild goats ; they have' also verdure m the rainy season, and in some of them the Natives weave a coarse cloth of cotton. Surdy has large plantations of date trees, some w.ld apple and banian trees, with water, and firewood. Pohor has few date trees, but a great abundance of wild thorn for firewood, and some water. Bomosa is less fertile than the two above mentioned but possesses m a small degree the produce indigenous to 10 o ler wo is ands. All of them are frequented by the inhabitants of the opposite coasts, who are left undisturbed in their possession Koong, Lingah, Shinas, and Mogoo are close to one another and sfggn rfT 01 0 , f GU r b bin bin G ' Zeeb ' -P he - ^ Suhan llahman bin ^fgnr, noHiowcT 'rhf' 311 not ' ' loweve r, the son of the Joasim Chieftain.PIRATE PORTS. 19 From Charak to Ubeed, one day's journey, is in possession of the Humadee, who possess cattle of all kinds in abundance, and are extensive husbandmen. 1 heir Shaikh is Shaikh Abdool Rnheem. trom Ubeed to Cheeroo is two hours' journey, the Shaikh Hassun Yuheea Ubeedelee; they are employed in tillage, and tending their flocks; are the friends of Syud Sueed. From Cheeroo to Nakheeloo is twelve hours' journey ; Shaikh, Yoosuf bin Rahmah bin Sunnud Sulbookhee ; friends to the Joasim, as Sultan Suggur has married the Shaikh's sister. They have date grounds, and cattle of all kinds, and also a pearl fishery, which gives employment to about 500 small boats, for each of which the owners pay one Toman, and one for every sailor. They pay the regulated duties on culture and captures to the Wahabees, besides a tax of about 24 Tomans yearly to the Persian Government. Charak also pays 30 Tomans, and Mogoo 25 Tomans; so that the total amount of Persian revenue collected between Koong and Nakheeloo does not exceed 100, or at most 150 Tomans yearly. From Nakheeloo to Sheeoo is Shaikh Ullag Nusooree, who is at present at variance with the Joasim. Date trees, and cattle, and trade contribute to their sustenance. At a short distance inland from the point which forms Cape Nabor, there is a spring called Beizu Khoon, the water of which is sweet, and abundant. There is also another a little upwards, called Bidbid, which overflows so much as to enable those who inhabit its banks to cultivate a large tract with grain, and palm trees. It is a pleasant, verdant spot, presenting at once a grateful and profitable contrast to the surrounding scenery. I ndera.bia. The island of Inderabia belongs to Hassan bin Yuheea, Shaikh of Cheeroo ; while Busheab and Shitwar are in possession of Shaikh Yoosuf bin Rahmah of Nakheeloo. Inderabia and Busheab are inhabited, and on both is fabricated a coarse cotton cloth. Shitwar, however, is uninhabited. Aseeloo belongs to Shaikh Khulfan Hurumee, the inha bitants of which are traders, shepherds, and farmers, and friends to the Imaum of Muskat. They pay the Persians 300 Tomans yearly. They have twenty or thirty large boats, and some small ones for the pearl fishery. Their revenue arises from taxes on boats, and trade. They endeavour to encourage the resort of strangers. Tahiri is a large village with date plantations, and cattle, in allegiance to Congoon. From this vil age there runs a mud wall, as far up to the hills as is supposed passable for troops, with six bastions at distances near the foot of it.20 PIRATE PORTS. congoon. Congoon is a large port and town belonging to Shaikh Mahomed Khatim Nusooree, uncle to Shaikh Ullag. Its territory extends to a small village, at a short distance to the westward of it. It pays 1,000 Tomans yearly to the Persians. The possessions of all the Shaikhs on the Persian side extend, in some places one day's, in others two days' journey inland. As far westward as Charak may be considered as in the possession of the Joasim ; thence to the head of the Gulf they are in general enemies or friends, as necessity and their interest dictate. From Congoon to Bushire the sea coast belongs to the tribes Dashtee and Tangifseeree. The Shaikh of the former is Hussain Jemal, and of the latter Ahmed Shah. Their towns and villages are further inland than those of their more easterly neighbours. A few huts, at various distances, may be seen, before which the Natives draw up their boats when returned from fishing, or a mercantile venture. The people of Dashtistan and Tangistan are little employed at sea. Bomosa. ^Bomosa lies eleven leagues NNW. | W. from Shargah, in lat. 25° 54/ N. It is an uninhabited island, about five miles long, and is remarkable from a high round hill, which is in its centre. I have not been near enough to make particular remarks. Surdy. Surdy lies about the meridian of Polior, and the parallel of Bomosa ; and is said to be much such another island as the latter. Polior. An uninhabited island, about five miles long, and four broad. It is hilly, with few or no trees ; the water is deep around this island, but fiom its west end runs along ledge of dangerous rocks. Its north end is in lat. 26° 20' 30'' N., and its south end in lat 26° 16' N. This island is west of the Tombs, and is twelve leagues distant from the Little Tomb, Nobfleur. A small, uninhabited island, ten miles SSW. from Polior, with deep water between them. A ledge of rugged rock and breakers run from its western extremity. This island is low, except a saddle hill nearly in the middle of it and has no vegetation, except a few scrubbed plants. Kenn or KaSS. Kenn or Kass is a low, level island, well planted with trees. It wasPIRATE PORTS. 21 inhabited a few years ago, when the attacks of Joasim pirates com pelled the families it contained to seek refuge on the opposite shore. Water is to be procured on its north-east end, where the town stands. It is separated from the main by a channel, said to be five miles wide, and free from danger. This island, being low, and rocks lying off some parts of it, must be neared with caution in the night. Its southern extremity, in lat. 26° 27' N., is situated about ten leagues W.byN. | N.from the south end of Polior. Inderabia. Inderabia is a low, level, narrow island, with a few trees on it; is about three miles long. The strait which divides it from the main is three miles wide, and is said to be clear of danger, as is the channel between Kenn or Kass, and the main, which is considerably wider. Ships running for shelter under this must not approach its south-east end within one mile, until a remarkable tree, which stands by itself, bears WN W. The south end of Inderabia is in lat, 26 o 40'N., and the island is about seven leagues distant from Kenn. Busheab. Busheab, subject to the Shaikh of Nakheeloo, is an inhabited island of moderate height, level, and with some groves of date trees. There is a fine pearl fishery round the island. It may be sixteen miles in length, and five or six miles broad. This island is separated from the main by a channel of considerable width, particularly at its western end, from which runs a long ledge of rocks. It is said that rocks lie off its south-east end. Shitwar. Shitwar, a sandy islet, without trees, is close to the east end of Busheab; between them is a channel, through which you have not less than three fathoms. Between Shitwar and the Persian Coast there is a channel five miles broad; as the bottom is rocky hereabouts, the soundings irregular towards the main, and some ripplings, it is not improbable there are hidden dangers. , . , . The south -east end of Shitwar lies in lat. 26° 47' N,, and is thirteen or fourteen leagues from the outer part of Kenn or Kass. Nakheeloo, A town under the domination of the Wahabees, is situated on the Persian shore, opposite to the island of Shitwar, and within a point22 PIRATi: PORTS. — BAHREIN. which in the charts is represented to form, with the main, the entrance of the Derabin river. It has a square fort, with four towers, and there is a town independent of the fort. Our boats carried in regular soundings, and it appears that a frigate could anchor within shot of the town ; but as it lies in a hook of land, the anchorage is wholly exposed to north-west winds. Ciieeroo. A village subject to the Shaikh of Nakheeloo ; about four miles SE. of that town. Between these places the shone is abrupt, and therefore ships should not stand under fifteen fathoms, when they will be within three quarters of a mile from the land. I have had too little experience of the coast to the northward to give any particular remarks : the directions by McCluer, for avoiding the Verdistan Shoal, appear to be good ; but in that gentleman's chart of the head of the Persian Gulf the shoal-water is carried further from Bushire than the truth. ISLAND OF BAHREIN. The Island of Bahrein lies opposite to the port of Ogair, is thirty- three miles in extreme breadth, and seventy in extreme length, covering about eight hundred square miles. The Chiefs of the Beni Itbah, a foreign tribe of Arabs from Grane (or Koweit), have governed its aborigi nal inhabitants for more than thirty-five years with absolute power. Not so, however, their Uttoobee brethren, who yield to superior authority with difficulty. The revenue collected by them amounts to the yearly sum of 100,000 Tomans, of which 20,000 Tomans is the original revenue, and h0,000 Tomans consist of arbitrary impositions of the governors. The pearl fishery produces to them 100,000 Tomans, of 12 Piastres Roomee each, which is divided among the members of the tribe in proportions, according to their rank and consequence. Their fishing-boats amount to 1,400 sail, of which 700 are of larger burthen, 300 intermediate, and 400 of a small size. The lar-er are manned by one master, fourteen divers, and fourteen assistants' in all twenty-nine men; the intermediate with one master, nine divers and nine assistants, in all nineteen men ; the least with one master seven divers, and seven assistants, in all fifteen men. The portions of the shery are four to the master, and two to the divers; the assistants receive for the season a settled pay of from five to six Tomans. The fishermen borrow for their support, from noted bankers, amounts both of money and grain, on which these gain a profit of thirty per cent., orBAHREIN. 23 more, as circumstances may influence. The larger crews require 100 Tomans in the year, the intermediate 50 Tomans, and the least 30 Tomans. The modes of payment and indemnification are as has been related of the people of Ras-ool-Khyma, The Governor of Bahrein levies a convoy duty on the pearl fleet of 2 Tomans yearly from each boat r all of which are escorted by seven war Bugalows during the fishing season. The aboriginal inhabitants of Bahrein, now subjected to a foreign power, suffer from the tyranny of their masters more keenly than language can express. The island abounds in water, the date, and other fruit trees. The Bahreinees are 10,000 in number. The number and names of the Uttoobees and their allies are as follows : A1 Khulefe, the Governor, 600 souls; Ali Zauyed, 1,200; Ali Mauzeed, 2,000; Ali Muhavideh, 3,000; Ali Sulaim, 3,000; Ali Mao Sullim, 1,000; Ali Sumait, 900 ; slaves, 2,000 ; total number of Uttoobees and others, 13,600 souls. There is considerable difference of opinion as to the origin of the first inhabitants of Bahrein. Some authors assert that they were ancient Persians, who, after a long residence, adopted the dialect of the inhabitants of the nearest coast; while others declare that they were descended from the Arab Tribe of Thamud, one of the oldest in Arabia (1900 b . c.), who were driven out of Yemen, or Arabia Felix, by Saba, son of Hamyar, into Hajar, or Arabia Petrsea, and passed at length into Awal (Bahrein) subsequent to their dispersion by the Almighty for their want of religious faith. Some centuries previous to Mahomedanism ( a. d . 420), the idolatrous Natives were the governors of the island ; but when Bahram, of the last or Sassanian dynasty of Persian Kings, achieved his partial conquest of the Arabs ( a. d . 615), he possessed himself of it, and nominated a governor from the royal presence, who retained his seat until the era of the mission of Mahomed. At this period the government of the island of Bahrein reverted to the original people, and remained with them as late as the reign of Keshan birTAbdool Malik, who vanquished them in the commencement of the eighth century ( a. d. 723), and placed over them a rnler of the Oommiyyad branch of the Iribe Koraish. They continued thus under a foreign power until the close of the Abbaside dynasty, in the eleventh century, when they again became subject to chiefs of their own race, until the sixteenth century, in t e ao-e of the Saffis (or Soph is), who took Bahrein, and deputed a Persian nobleman to the office of governor. During an interval of twenty years at this period, about the middle of the seventeenth century, Sui bin Sultan, the Yarabi, retained the island under subjection ; when, in^4 nAHREIZV. the latter part of the same century, it was reduced by the Generals of Sultan Sulaiman the Sophi, and continued to recognise the authority of this dynasty until its close in the early part of the succeeding or eighteenth century, in the person of Shah Sultan Hussein. Sultan the son of Suif next became possessed of the island, after a bloody and obstinate resistance ; and retained the supreme authority until he was driven out by Nadir Shah, under whose power it remained until his death. jUter this, during a period of fifty-seven years, it passed into the hands of four different chiefs of districts on the Persian shore of the Cmlf, at no great dtstance from each other. The first of these was abara bin Yasir the Nasiri, surnamed Nasuri, Shaikh of Tahiri, who e . ' fourteen years; next, the famiiy of the Shaikhs of Abooshahar Tab' , g overnment for thirty years; after them, Mahomed bin Jabir, of the fam.iy of Haram Shaikhs of Aseeloo, for five years- from whom, after a sanguinary contest, it reverted once more to the Shaikhs o ooshahar, for e.ght succeeding years, when the Uttoobees wrested since aikhS 0f AbOOShahar ' a ' d '-e retained it eTer The celebrated traveller Carsten Neibuhr gives the following more r^r Unt ^ 111686 SUdden revolutions i' government of ' Within the last few years Bahrein has had many masters It once possessed himself of Jt • j t • , x nnce ol Uman now through theTn rv i'on ;ta i kh ,0 M e b PerS !, a, t f0r 9 SUm 0f governor of it at the period ^ Majid, who was still at his death succeeded by his Jon Iha'],-]' a T™ ^ rSia ' and WaS principal fortress of the island had at this f .

' At this time, however, as the public troubles of Persia were daily increasing, Mahomed bin Jaber, of Aseeloo, and of the race of Haram, brought the island under his own power, but was dispossessed of it by the united powers of Mir Nasr of Bender Rig, and Shaikh Nasr of Abooshahar. The first of these established a superiority over the second | and he was in turn driven out by the tribe Haram, who Were themselves obliged to yield at length to Shaikh Nasr of Abooshahar. This chief, after many successive changes in the result of his military operations against the tribes Beni Hul and Haram, finally succeeded in making himself master of the island.' ( a. d. 1765.) With regard to this island, Justamond, in his History of the East and West Indies, has this striking and remarkable passage:—^ 'This Company (the English East India) have never attempted to establish themselves on the island of Bahrein, which we are at a loss to account for. This island, which lies in the Persian Gulf, has often changed its masters. It fell, with Ormus, under the dominion of the Portuguese, and was governed by the same laws. These conquerors were afterwards deprived of it, and it has since undergone a variety of revolutions. 'Tahmasp Koly Khan restored it to Persia, to which it had belonged. His death put a period to his vast designs, and the confusion into which his empire was thrown afforded a fair opportunity to an ambitious and enterprising Arab of taking possession of Bahrein, where he still maintains his authority. ' This island, famous for its pearl fishery, even at the time when pearls were found at Ormus, Karel, Kishen, and other places in the Gulf, is now become of much greater consequence, the other banks having been exhausted, while those near it have suffered no sensible diminution. The time of fishing begins in April, and ends in October. It is confined to a tract of four or five leagues. The Arabs, who alone follow this employment, pass their nights upon the island or the coast, unless they are prevented by the wind from going on shore. They formerly paid a toll, which was received by the galliots on that station. Since the last changes, none but the inhabitants of this island pay this acknowledgment to their chief, who is not in a condition to demand it from others. r ri . ' The pearls taken at Bahrein, though not so white as those oi Ceylon and Japan, are much larger than those of the former place, and of a more regular shape than those of the latter* They aie o a ye 0 ^ s cast, but hare this recommendation, that they preserve their golden hue ; whereas the whiter kind lose much of their lustre by keeping, 420 BAHREIN. particularly in hot countries. The shell of both these species, which is known by the name of mother-o'-pearl, is used in Asia for various purposes. ' The annual revenue arising from the fishery in the latitude of Bahrein is computed at 3,600,000 livres (£157,500). The greatest part of the pearls that are uneven are carried to Constantinople, and other ports of Turkey, where the larger compose part of the ornaments of the head- dress, and the smaller ars used in works of embroidery. The perfect pearls are of course reserved ior Snrat, from whence they are distributed throughout all Hindoostan. 1 he women have so strong a passion for this luxury, and the sale of this article is so much increased by superstition that there is not the least reason to apprehend any diminution either in the price or the demand. There are none of the^Gentiles, who do not make it a point of religion to bore at least one pearl at the time of their maniage. A\ hatever may be the mysterious meaning of this custom, among a people whose morality and politics arc couched in allegories,' or where allegory becomes religion, this emblem of virgin modestv has proved advantageous to the pearl trade.' At a time when the revenue from the pearl banks of Bahrein alone was at the lowest point, under the Shaikhs ofBushire, from the weak ness and imperfection of their tenure and government, Neibuhr thus speaks of it:— Bahrein is said at. one time to have contained 365 towns and villages ; but at present there is only one fortified town on the island, Awal (Bahrein), and not more than forty or fifty villages on the neighbouring islets. The remainder have doubtless been destroy ed by the continual wars which have infested this country. The pearl fishery of these isles is still celebrated, but as the tribe Hul pay little or nothing for the permission to fish, the revenues of the Shaikh of Abooshahar, on account of the fishery and the date grounds, amount to no more than Rs. 100,000. ' Many persons who have been on these islands have assured me that excellent spring-water is found in a depth of two and a half fathoms, at some d.stanoe from the shore; and that the fishermen constantly dive to that depth, to replenish their jars.' Tavernier says : -'In the first place, there is a pearl fishery round the asland of Bahrein,^ m the Persian Gulf, which belongs ,o the King of 1Sa g0 ° d forlress &gt; g arr ' s oned with three hundred men. «a t rnTof n /tT, 1 ' th ' S . island &gt; o' Persian Coast, is drink it Whh ' ' ,S 0nly 11,0 Na,iveS of ,he countr y that can ^ S(ran S ers ' 11 a considerable sum from half a°ea£up t f ^ ^ ^ fr0m Sea ' at a Stance of a league to two leagues beyond the island. Those that go toBAHREIN. 27 fetch it are commonly five or six, in a bark, from which one or two of them dive to the bottom of the sea, having a bottle or two hang at their girdles, which they fill with water, and then cork them tight; for at about two or three feet from the bottom of the sea the water is sweet, and of the very best quality. When those who are let down have filled their bottles, they pull a small cord, which has one end fastened to some person in the boat, and it serves as a signal for their comrades to draw them up. 'While the Portuguese were in possession of Ormus and Muskat, every Terate or bark that went out to fish was obliged to have a pass port, which cost fifteen Abbasees, and they continually employed several brigantines to sink those that had not got them ; but since the Arabs have retaken Muskat, and the Portuguese have no strength in the Gulf, every man that goes a fishing pays to the King of Persia five Abbasees only, whether his success be good or bad. The merchant also pays some small trifle to the king, on every thousand oysters. ' The second pearl fishery is over against that of Bahrein, on the coast of Arabia the Happy, near the city of Katifa, which, as well as ihe surrounding country, belongs to an Arabian Prince. All the pearls that are fished in these places are generally sold in the Indies, because the Indians are not so difficult as we, and buy indifferently the rough ones as well as the smooth, taking the whole at a fixed price. They also carry some to Balsora, while those that are carried to Persia and Muscovy are sold at Bunder Congo, two days 5 journey from Ormus. In all these places I have mentioned, as well as in other parts of Asia,, they like better to see the water of a yellow cast than white, because thev say that those pearls in which the water is a little tinged like gold always retain their brightness, and never alter, while those that are white seldom last longer than thirty years without; when, owing as well to the warmth of the country as the heat of the body, they take a dull yellow colour.' Notwithstanding the pearls found at Bahrein and Kateef approach a little upon the yellow, they are yet in as much esteem as those of Manaar (Ceylon) ; and throughout all the East they say they are ripe, and never change their colour. The history, according to Native tradition, may now be resumed from the point at which it was relinquished. The last, or Uttoobee conquerors, of Bahrein, who reduced it in a. h . 1194 ( a. d . 1779), came originally from Koweit or Grane. They were formed by the intermarriage of three large tribes of Arabs,^ the Beni Sabah, under Shaikh Sulaiman bin Ahmed; the Bern Yalahimah under Shaikh Jabir bin Uttoobee, and the Beni Khalifah, under Shaikh Khalifah bin Mahomed.28 BAIfREfN. On the union of these tribes, for the purpose of resisting the attacks of more powerful clans in the neighbourhood of Koweit, they determined to become at once merchants and agriculturists, and that the profits arising from these occupations should be equally divided amongst the 'Whole. From the tribe Sabah were to proceed their governors, the Yalahimah were to produce seamen, and the Khalifah to conduct the commercial concerns. The system had been pursued with success for fifty years, when the mercantile federates became anxious to enjoy singly their lucrative branch of the original league. With this view Khalifah bin Mahomed, an artful chief, persuaded the members of the other two tribes to permit him to pass over to the pearl shore, near Bahrein, and as the purchase and sale of these eonsti, tuted the principal source of their riches, to endeavour to procure a share of that fishery for themselves, instead of continuing to purchase from other hands. The Yalahimah conveyed their brethren to Zobara, where they com-, pletely-succeeded in their object, and at length refused a share 'of the profits resulting from its attainment to both the other parties in the origyjal compact. The Beni Sabah, too, who remained at Koweit, also at length threw off the third party (the Yalahimah), who, stung by the injustice of this double defection, retired to Ruaisah, a barren spot a little to the eastward of Zobara, and commenced a system of reprisal on their commerce, which brought the Khalifah to the brink of ruin. Mutual hostilities now engaged these tribes, until the Yalahimah were attacked in their retreat, and cut to pieces, with the exception of some women and children. About this time Shaikh Nasr, Governor of Bahrein, tempted by the prosperity of the settlement at Zobara, besieged it with vigour but sustaining a shameful defeat, quickly despatched the intelli D oence to Ins son, whom he had left to guard the island, and charged him to be resolute and vigilant against foreign attack, until he should come to his assistance. Ths boat conveying this despatch was taken on its passage, and the papers perused by the Sabah, who, having heard of the' meditated attack of their brethren by Shaikh Nasr, were then advancing to assist them. Aware of the defenceless state of Bahrein, they immediately proceeded to the attack, and gained possession of its principal posts previous to the arrival of Shaikh Nasr's fleet, who, finding the island in possession of an enemy, returned to Abooshahar. The Sabah communicated their success to the Khalifah at Zobara, who hastened to collect an army, in order to join their former com- p mens, and reduced the unconquered parts of the island. All thoseBAHREIN — ORMUS. 29 who would join them, and co-operate in the reduction of Bahrein, were upheld by the promise of grants of land, money, and exclusive privileges of tenure. This service was shortly completed, and the rewards conferred, in the distribution of which the four sons of Jaber bin Uttoobee claimed a voice in the government, and were refused, although by the original compact they possessed a just hereditary right to an equal share of the benefits of a conquest, in the completion of which they had shed their blood. On this they left the island of Bahrein in disgust, and commenced the mode of life their progenitor had pointed out to them, in which they have since persevered. Of the four brothers, sons of Jaber bin Uttoobee Yalahimah, Rahmah bin Jaber only is alive ; Abdoolla bin Jaber was inhumanly butchered by the Prince of Fars, while living under his pledged protection ; Bhahin bin Jaber died five years ago, on his return from pilgrimage ; and. Mahomed bin Jaber was lately killed while defencHng the family of his brother, at Khor Hassan, from the attack of the Shaikhs of Bahrein. f After this conquest, the Uttoobees paid a trifling tribute to the Persians only four times, and then discontinued, it altogether, ^ ISLAND OF ORMUS. The Portuguese, by their conquest of Ormus in the sixteenth century, not only secured the command of the Persian Gulf, but gave increased life and animation to a commerce, which, after having long subsisted at Siraff,* a port on the Persian shore, sixty leagues from Shiraz, and twice that distance from Bussora, had passed to this insular station, and transformed it from a desert to an earthly paradise, which has more than once been described in terms of splendid eloquence by celebrated authors. Justamond, in his History of the East Indies, says 'At the mouth of the Strait of Mocandon, which leads into the Pers.an Cxnlf, l.es the island of Gombroon. In the eleventh century an Arabian conqueror built upon this barren rock the city of Ormus, which afterwards beca the capital of an empire, comprehending a conslderab c par o la ro^ide, and of Persia on the other, Ormus had - ^ and was large and well fortified ; Persia and owing to its situation.

In this town are merchants o all nations, and many Moors and Gentiles. There is a very great trade ol all sorts of spices, drugs, silk, cloth of silk, fine tapestry of ersia, great store of pearls, which come from the isle of Bahrein, and are the best pearls of all others, and many horses of Persia, which serve R niflm ' BUNDER ABBAS. ^ The English, in their destruction of the Portuguese power in the Gulf, in conjunction with the armies of Persia, in a. d . 1622, retired to Bunder Abbas, and forced the trade with them from its favourite retreat to a point characterised thus unfavourably by the same author : r I luce 01 foui leagues from Ormus there was, upon the continent, an harbour called Gombroon, or Bunder Abbas. Nature seemed not to have designed it should be inhabited. It is situated at the foot of a ridge of mountains of an excessive height; the air you breathe seems to be on fire ; mortal vapours continually exhale from the bowels of the earth ; the fields are black and dry, as if they had been scorched with fire. Notwithstanding these inconveniences, as Bunder Abbas had the advantage of being placed at the entrance of the Gulf, the Persian Monarch chose to make it the centre of the extensive trade he intended to carry on with India. The English joined in this project. A per petual exemption from all imposts, and a moiety of the product of the customs, were granted them, on condition that they should maintain at least two men-of-war in the Gulf. This precaution was thought neces sary, to frustrate the attempts of the Portuguese, whose resentment was still to be dreaded.' From this time Bunder Abbas, which was before a poor fishing town, became a flourishing city. Bunder Abbas is situated nearly north from the town of Kishm, from which it is from four to five leagues distant : it is now farmed of the Persian Monarch by the Imaum of Muskat, who keeps an armed force in the town. ISLAND OF KARRACK. The Dutch in a. d . 1748, having been plundered at Bussora by the local Government, whither the trade had been carried from Bunder Abbas by the European factors, during the Afghan invasion of Persia, retired to the island of Karrack, on which they planted an establishment, which32 KARRACK. in a short course of time created a rival attraction to the commercial body, highly prejudicial to that city. Of this event Justamond gives the following account:—'Baron Knyphausen managed the Dutch factory at Bussora with extraordinary success. The English found themselves in imminent danger of losing the superiority they had acquired at this place, as well as in most of the seaports in India. They excited the Turkish Government to suppress a branch of trade that was useful to it, and procured an order for the confiscation of the merchandize and possessions of their rivals. ' The Dutch factor, who, under the character of a merchant, concealed the statesman, instantly took a resolution Worthy of a man of genius. He retired with his dependents, and the broken remains of his fortune, to Karrack, a small island at the distance of fifteen leagues from the ipoufh of the river, where he fortified himself in such a manner that, by intercepting the Arabian and Indian vessels bound for the city, he compelled the Government to grant him an indemnification for the losses he had sustained by its behaviour. The fame of his integrity and abilities drew to his island the privateers of the neighbouring ports, the very merchants of Bussora, and the Europeans who traded thither. This new colony found its prosperity increase every day, when it was abandoned by its founder. The successor of this able man did not display the same talents: towards the end of the year 1765 he sitflTered himself to be dispossessed of his island by the Arabian Corsair Mirmahana.' By this event Bussora was freed from a rivalry that was prejudicial to its interests. The chart of Karrack, by the late Mr. Dalrymple, said to be taken from a French manuscript, is good in detail : from carelessness, however, the north point of the compass is inserted where the west ought to be. Mistakes of this nature are dangerous to mariners, and disgraceful to their author ; and here I cannot help remarking that the most gross errors of bearings abound in the quarto book called the East India Directory. The best anchorage on the east side of the island is as follows :— Karrack from NW. by N. to S. by W. ^ W., the adjacent island of Korgo, N. by W. to S. by E. Hallilla Peak, in Persia, SE. by E., in nine fathoms, sand, off shore half a mile. Ships should always be guarded against a shift of wind, so as to be able to clear the south end of Karrack in time ; particularly as the bottom is loose, and the island hereabout is fringed with a coral reef. The passage between Korgo and Karrack ought not to be attempted in the night, except in cases of great necessity. Fresh water is to be had in abundance from wells at Karrack, but, litKARUACK— BOSTANA KISHM. 33 my opinion, its quality does not deserve the encomiums passed on it by the English who reside at Abooshahar. The shoals along the head of the Persian Gulf are laid down to the southward of their real situation, as will appear by a reference to La Chiffonne's log-book for 1809-10, and a comparison with McCluer's chart, published by Mr. Dalrymple. bostana. Bostana is a low shelving point, with rugged hills immediately above it. Its extremity is about lat. 26° 30' N. ; it bears from Polior NNE. ^ E., and W. from the southern end of Kishm. THE ISLAND OF KISHM, AND ITS VICINITY. The western ends of the island of Kishm lie north and south of each other, and are distant about seven miles from the north-west ends, in iat. 26° 38' N. The Coast of Persia rounds to Cape Bostana or Bestian, which in McCluer's and Heather's charts is improperly called Cape Certes. Kishm is near the main, and extends eighteen leagues W. by S. and R. by N. ; its greatest breadth is probably twenty miles ; but from Luft, a town on its north side, about thirty miles in a direct line from that ol Kishm, it narrows in other places considerably, down probably to seven miles, and afterwards widens very little to the westward. Nothing can exceed the singular appearance of the coast of this island : the hills, once uniformly table, are in many places mouldered away, leaving parts of very grotesque shapes. It is said that before the inhabitants were oppressed by the Joasmee pirates, one hundred villages flourished on the island. The Natives are chiefly weavers, who supplv the Oulf with loongees, and striped cotton and bilk cloths , their personal appearance and character are much in their fa\our. On the east side, close to the sea, lies the town of Kishm, in lat. 26° 57' 30' N., off which ships may, with westerly winds, securely ride, in clear ground. Kishm is walled round, and has a small oblong fort within the walls. The whole island, as well as a large portion of the opposite coast, in which are mines of brimstone, is farmed from Persia by the Imaum of Muskat. There is a good channel between Kishm and Larrack, but you mus be careful of a bank, which is said to extend nearly two miles from a point southward of the town of Kishm, on which is a grove ol drttfi trees. The island of Kishm tends from the town NW. to the Western Cape, 534 KISITM LT T FT, in lat. 27° P/ N., calculated from an indifferent observation, the ship being near the land at the time it was taken. The coast 'then runs W. and W.byS. to Luft Point. There is a good channel between iushm and the main, about eight miles wide from the north point of the island, and not three opposite to Old Luft, from whence it winds among several wooded islands, until you reach Bassadore, of which I will speak hereafter. The bottom is generally mud, and the deepest water is near the island, but rocky ledges run a long distance from the point o Klshm » most of which uncover at low-water. The tide falls about twelve feet. As you approach Luft the soundings become irregular the bottom rocky, and the tide rapid. Luft. From the northern point of Luft, the coast turns abruptly to the south- east, and, beyond that, tends westerly to the extremity of the island Bassadore Point bearing SW. by W., leaving a deep bay, which is ik aily filled with low islands covered with brushwood. The harbour of Luft is secure, and the place is admirably adapted to piratical pursuits. 1 he anchorage of the Chiffonne is as follows : tlm\td' d .ead'NW r&gt;re,ty SOOd 0bSerValio '' 260 57 ' ^NW.; point of Jodcrabia asmau wooded island, in one with NE. point, N. j E., Luft K E. 4 E., distant nearly three miles, in nine fathoms, mud. soutw!rd S nf narrOW but pretty deep channel within the low island, eh:'ar;::r^. ,ree ' srowing - of — — the^mvnTKM ' ' le rf 16 ' ^ 0f theisIand of Kishm - arrive off a and An S ar Island the coast hollows until you leagues from Kist ''-''t' T' WhiCl1 iS a mined P a g oda ' aiul about fil 'e An^ar which hp '' ' r l '' 11 ri ' ns to l'-'r a bly straight to the point opposite h'' 1 ? fou1 ' Wlth 'regular soundings, must be approach- v ^b e S n r :r .o Ca t U ;• • t l0ng ,he ,ract 0f COaSt deseri^ Tl lUivisaDie not to btand within i ship will be less than two miles from fhe laTd.

A few villages, also, besides these towns, are scattered over the interior of the island. Water from springs is abundant, and contributes to the fertility of the soil, which produces large crops of barley, wheat, and vegetables of all kinds. In the declivity of its hills, delicious honey is found; in its valleys are large date groves, and the soil of these situations has been found to be favourable for the production of the European fruits, which are transplanted from the Persian continent. Its peasantry is composed chiefly of Persians, who speak their national dialect, and also comprehend the Arabic, from their intercourse with the tribe Bani Main, the governors of the island, as well as with the Arab tribes who occupy the whole of the opposite or Persian shore : the Natives are highly industrious. Previous to the reign of Karim Khan, this island belonged to the Kings of Persia, and was kept immediately dependent on the nearest depart ment of Bastak; so named from this town, which is nine Furseekhs (thirty-five miles) distant northerly from the port of Mogoo, westward of Lingah. This department extended from Mogoo to Bunder Abbas, a port on the Persian main, directly north of the town of Kishm. When Karim Khan reached the throne of Persia, Abdoolla Maini rebelled, and refused payment of the usual tribute. Previous to this, however, a prince of the Hinavi tribe of Oman held the government for eight years, at the close of which it was resumed by the Persians. The veins of brimstone are found in a hilly tract nearKhamir, a town on the Persian continent, about twenty-five miles NE. from Luft. Angar. Ansar, situated on the south side of Kishm, nearly midway between its extremes, is an island moderately high, nearly round, and about four miles long. Its south point is in lat. 26° 37' N. There is a channel between this island and Kishm, more than a mile wide, which forms a very excellent anchorage, and as you lound the northern point of Angar, proceeding to the southward is a capacious bay, with a muddy bottom t this bay is open to sea winds, but there is a flat of six fathoms, which runs from the western point of Angar towards Kishm, which in my opinion would break the force of the sea at any rate, ships riding here, and caught by a gale, have only to slip their cables, and run into the sound, where they would be secmely shelteied. This operation might be performed at night as well as in the day-time, by taking the precaution to send a boat to anchor with a light in five fathoms, off the sandy point which forms the northern end of Angar. To run into the sound from the south-east, keep one-third channel36 ANGAR—GREAT TOMB—LITTLE TOMB. over from Angar ; and do not approach its shore under six fathoms as you will in some places shoal from five to one and a half fathoms* nor near it within three cables length ; and be cautious of the point on Kishm, which has been already noticed as foul. Ihe Chiffonne's marks of anchorage in the sound were the red square building on Angar, with an octagonal top, S. 75° W. Ibe Point, which, as seen from the ship, forms the last entrance S. 21° E. Point Kishm, S. 85° E., ofi shore one-third of a mile, in eleven fathoms, sand. The proximity of Angar to Kishm and Persia perhaps affords some small opening to commercial pursuits; one insuperable objection, however, obtains against forming a large settlement here, namely the want of fresh water near the harbour side of the island ; but to supply only a garrison, spacious tanks on Angar might be repaired, at no ereat expense, and should a failure of rain occur, it is said water might be procured from the neighbouring villages on Kishm. From Angar, proceeding to the westward, you have regular soundings towar s Kishm, but a mud-bank of considerable extent, called the nscilla Bank, lies off its south-western extremity. This shoal should not be approached within five or six fathoms : it is an excellent mark in thick weather or during the night, to run between Kishm and the Gieat Tomb, affording a certain indication of your position. The most southern part, in five and a half fathoms, is in lat. 26° 26' N and ulute water extends about one mile further; then the water deepens lapidly towards the Great Tomb. The Great Tomb is a level island, about three miles long, and two and a half broad: on re a ew trees. It may be seen from a frigate's deck five leagues hes from the southern point of Angar SW.

There is an excellent harbour, but the approach to it is shoal. The Chiffonne going in steered E.byN. for the Point, and had, in passing over an extensive flat, so little as three fathoms, and, in returning, had even somewhat less, |N. by E. ; but the Honorable Company's cruiser Mornington, sailing nearer to the Persian shore, never sounded less than four fathoms. It is very desirable that this channel should be sounded throughout its whole extent, for it would afford capital shelter in bad weather ; and wood and water are to be found at Bassadore, the latter out of tanks. Lingaii, The chief town of the piratical Joasmees, on the Persian side, is situated close to the sea, in lat. 26° 33' N., about eight leagues from Kishm. The soundings are regular close to the shore, and it has a secure road to ride out a north-wester, as you can bring the outer point to bear SW.by W., and anchor, on a muddy bottom, in five fathoms. Shinas and Bostana. Shinas and Bostana lie between Lingah and Cape Bostana. They are small towns, from which may be obtained refreshments for a ship or two. Mogoo. This is a noble bay, secure against the prevailing winds in the Gulf. It is formed by Cape Bostana to the eastward, and Cape Certes, which, in Heather's chart, is improperly called Bestian, to the westward ; the extremes, which lie NVV.byW. and SE.byE. of each other, are about ten miles asunder. The bay is of a good depth, and is capable of holding the largest fleets; the ground is tough clay, from which you with difficulty purchase the anchors; the soundings without the bay are irregular; and between Mogoo and Polior is a rocky shoal, on which is less than three fathoms. This shoal lies nearer to the main than to Polior, and is an objection against running for the bay in the night, but in the day-time the marks are so good that you may easily avoid it. By keeping a remarkable round and lofty hill, named Charak Hill, NW., a ship will be led into Mogoo Bay. The Chiffonne's marks for anchorage in Mogoo Bay are as follow Against a NW.

The remainder of the coast I have scarcely visited, indeed some ports T have never seen ; but from every information I could gain, I have no doubt that it is generally free from dangers as high as Congoon. LARRACK ISLAND. Captain Wainwright, of His Majesty's ship Chifonne, from whom, and from Lieutenant Tanner, of the Honorable Company's Marine, I have selected all the hydrographical details exhibited in the course of this Report, describes Larrack Island as about five miles long, and our broad ; of tolerable height, barren, and with very few inhabitants. He then proceeds thus ' It lies nearly NNW. of the Great Quoin, at about seven leagues distance, its southern point being near the at. of 26° oO' N. There is no danger within half a mile of the shore. lsland has near its ^ntre a small volcanic, conical hill, the most perfect in its form I ever saw.' CONCLUDING REMARKS. The extreme general sterility of those parts of the continents of Persia and Arabia which confine the intervening Gulf has contributed to present to the view of its Natives the life of a freebooter in a more inviting form than could have been given to it had they been situated in a country of greater resources. But this reflection, however it may be admitted as a slight extenuation of their guilt, can never wholly excuse it, particularly when it is known that previous to these piratical pursuits, which are almost the growth of the present century, an exten sive and lucrative commerce first gave them a fleet, and a band of ableCONCLUDING REMARKS. 39 find hardy mariners, which they have since turned to purposes so different from these civilized habits, the primary cause of their aggrandisement. From this the British were among the first sufferers, by the attack on one of their smallest cruisers, assailed in the roads of Bushire with ammunition which had, in an hour of friendly communication previous to the attack, been solicited and bestowed on the chief of the assailing fleet. These hollow friends were, however, beaten off, with consider able loss on their side. To proceed, then, on a plan of methodical and comprehensive detail, it were perhaps advisable, in order to prove their addiction to com mercial pursuits, to premise an account of these tribes in the days of their upright and honorable exertion, previous to their conversion to the Wahabee faith, which paved the way to every subsequent atrocity. These, and other particulars given in the course of this Report, relating to the Arabs of the Persian Gulf, are the results of personal investiga tion, or of cautious gleanings from Natives of authority, and capable of close observation. ^ , + They were originally employed, as these authorities state, commercial enterprise, in the cultivation of extensive groves of the date tree, and the pursuit of a lucrative pearl fishery. The sale of the yearly produce of their date grounds placed the proprietors in possession of an equivalent amounting to Bs. 80,000, of which the governing power received a tenth, or Rs. 8,000. Their fleets consisted of large boats, as the Dow and Buggalow, and smaller ones,^ or the Buteel and Bugare .

H aving lately proceeded to the island of Kenn, we have the honour to submit the following Report, in which the several quarters of the island aie separately described, as represented in the accompanying Sketch namely,— 1 ' ' A. THE A\EST, NORTH-WEST, AND SOUTH-WEST SIDES. This part contains three villages, built near date plantations; one is near the south-west point, and is called Bank; another at the north west, Suffecl; the third does not appear to bear any name, and is about midway between the other two; the distance between these two extremes being nearly three and a quarter miles. These villages are provided with wells, which supply the population, and also irrigate the grain fields and date frees. Some of the water is good ; the remainder is indifferent, and mostly brackish. I'he country for about three miles in their vicinity is moderately elevated above the sea, and nearly level, as it ascends very gradually om the sea coast to the central and higher part of the island. It is partially covered with trees, which are more numerous inland, and the ground is also clearer on the coast, having only small tufts of coarse giass, the inland part being rocky and stony. The coast is of a bluff and rocky nature, with some small sandy bays • but being bounded by a rocky shelf, dry in many places at low'-water, and which extends not less than a quarter of a mile, tolerable landing is afforded in these bays at high-water only, for light boats, and that in moderate weather. There is no good anchorage for ships off this part of the island, the bottom being coarse sand, with patches of coral. It is exposed to a heavy sweH during a moderate north-west wind, but may be safe to appioach to eight or ten fathoms, a mile and a quarter or a mile and a half off shore.K.ENN. 47 B—THE NORTH SIDE.

I was induced to run this risk from information gamed from the pilot and others, that vessels would find shelter fiom sout i- easters and south winds, not only on the east side of 1 heleechi, but the west. I carried soundings of two and a half and two fathoms ove the mud-flat the whole way, with the exception of two casts of ten fee , rocks, laying directly between the two islands, and, running o e northward a short distance, anchored in what the Natives called a Bunder, sheltered from south-east winds, in three fathoms, low-wa er. This place is partially sheltered from south-east, and wholly from south winds, but open from south-east to north. During the time I remained there, it blew a moderate sea-breeze from south-east, wit ou anv swell, but on its shifting to the eastward in the evening, a swell immediately set in. East and south-east breezes ^ prevailed since I came to this part of the coast, and a Native (Shaikh of Pheleechi) informed me they have blown for the last three months with only a few days' intermission. I do not think it a safe anchorage for vessels drawing more than eight feet water, as vessels drawing more would not be able to work out, should east winds blow, and there being less water (two and a half fathoms) to pass over after leaving it. ^ hen at anchor in three fathoms, mud (low-water), I obtained the following bearings and angles -MofWPtrae A tomb on point near Saidee town, bearing south .. 14 OU true.

It has three towns on it, viz. cor the western, Saidee the northern, and Grane the eastern ; the former o which is the only one at present inhabited, the other two having been depopulated by the late plague. It contains seventy to eighty houses, and about a hundred and fifty inhabitants.54 PIIELEECHI.

FRANCIS WARDEN member oi 1 council at bombay. ' tA1UB TRIBES OF THE PERSIAN GULF. OF THE MUSKAT ARABS, JOASMEES, UTTOOBEES, WAHA- BEES, AND OMAN, I k the following paragraphs I have endeavoured to supply the want under which this Government has hitherto laboured of an adequate knowledge of the complicated interests that prevail in the Persian Gulf, by affording a sketch of the history of each of the Powers which have contended for superiority, and of the various revolutions which have occurred in that quarter from the earliest period. During the ascendancy of the Portuguese nation, which under Alphonso d'Albuquerque conquered all the islands in the Persian Gulf in a. d . 1507, its navigation was perfectly secure from piracy ; it continued so during the reign of Shah Abbas, or until the rise of the Muskat Arabs, which may be dated from a. d. 1694-95. On the death of Shah Abbas, the Arabs, who had from the earliest ages possessed a superiority at sea over the Persians, established an influence which they maintained until the year 1736. Their depreda tions during that period were carried on to a most alarming degree, extending to the Indian seas, and the ruler of Muskat became master of all the islands. 1 he power of the Muskat Arabs declined in the reign of Nadir Shah, who re-established the Persian influence; an ascendancy which was maintained during the subsequent reign of Kureem Khan. The tianquillity of the Gulf was, however, disturbed in some degree on the death of Nadir Shah, by the notorious freebooter Meer Mehana, and by the Chaub Shaikh, by whose refractory dispositions the trade was greatly impeded. The British Government was also involved in serious difficulties by the vacillating policy pursued by its Agents at Bussora, on that occasion, which reduced our reputation to the lowest ebb. We experienced a disastrous defeat in an attack of the Chaub, and failed also in an attempt to reduce Bunderik, belonging to Meer Mehana. In the course of a badly conducted negociation with Kureem Khan, for the purpose of retrieving our credit in the chastisement of8 57 ARAB TRIBES. those petty rulers, we involved ourselves in hostilities with the Khan, who iLed orders for the seizure of all English ships wh,eh lus fleets might fall in with. A good understanding with the Perstan Govern ment was in some measure restored on the re-estahhshment of the Factory of Bushire in 1776. * -\nnA The Muskat fleet, of which we hear nothing from 1736 to 17 01 , made its appearance in the latter year, to co-operate m the defence o Bussora, the reduction of which Kureem Khan was contemplating, and effected ; one of the pretexts for which was stated to be the aid wine i the Pacha of Bagdad had granted the Imaum of Muskat, which pie- vented the Persians from subduing the province of Oman. Bussora was abandoned by the Persians on the death of Km eei Khan, in a. d . 1779, and re-occupied by the Turks. The trou cs a ensued in the interior of Persia on that event left the Gul uncontrolled. The decline of the Persian influence may be dated from that period, is maintenance depended exclusively on the attachment and fidelity of its tributaries. The contests for superiority which arose between le different petty States involved the whole Gulf in a state of hosti i y. The fleet of the Shaikh of Julfar (Ras-ool -Khyma), who was at this period at war with the Imaum of Muskat, being continually on the cruise, roused every petty chief to equip armed boats, manned by a lawless crew, who received no pay, but depended so e y on p , which they committed on each other. The Uttoobee Arabs, am ltl °' s of sharing in the spoils, conquered Bahrein from the Persians, the possession of which, supported by their allies, they have since main tained, with unimportant intermissions, against repeated efforts on e part of the Persians, assisted by the Joasmees, and of the Imaum ot Muskat, for its recovery and reduction. „ . ^ , f We now come to an important era in the history of the Persian Gulf,— the rise of the Wahabee power, of which mention is first made in t ic Bombay Records in 1787. The Persian and Turkish Governments were at this period in an unsettled state, and but ill calculated to oppose the progressive ascendancy of that sect. ^ rtrir y During the whole of this period, and even up to the year 1797, the molestation which the British trade experienced in the reign of Kureem Khan may be attributed to that interference which the Government exercised in the disputes between the petty States in the Gull, whenever we preserved a strict neutrality, we derived cvciy^ ac \an a &amp; e from the observance of that policy. To piratical depredations it was not at all exposed, nor can piracy be said to have been systematically prosecuted by any of the powers up to 1797, except by the Muskat Arabs during the period of their ascendancy. r i\t i ♦ The enterprising character of Syud Sultan, the Imaum of Muskat,ARAB TRIBES. who had usurped the Government from his elder brother, led him inin senous disputes with the Arabs, which brought on a war with many of whiVh h ■ ^ inSUlted in 0,16 OT two i-'anees, f 0r w hich, however, satisfaction was rendered. The troubles that prevailed from this period to the death of Syud Sultan, in 1804, are wholly attributable to the conduct of that chieftain in the prosecution of his ambjtious views of aggrandisement. 'J'lie disputes that followed the death of Synd Sultan, for the succcs- 7% w7 K he ® 0ver ' ment of Muskat completely under the control of the Wahabce: from that period, the influence which the former chief had established declined, and that of the latter rapidly advanced, to the establishment of its ascendancy over the Gulf,_an event which led to the systematic prosecution of piracy, under the countenance and protection of that power, even to the Indian Seas. The history of the rise of the Muskat, the Joasmce, and the Uttoobee Arabs, respectively, satisfactorily shows that they resisted the growing power of the Wahabees to the utmost of their effort, and that not one of the petty States in the Gulf has voluntarily en-a^ed in piracy. ^ &amp; From the period of their establishment in Oman until the year 1796, I have been unable to trace a single act of aggression, even on the part of the Joasmees, against the British flag. The attack of the Bassein Snow, and of the Viper cruiser, in 1797, was supposed to have been by Arabs in the interest of the deposed Prince of Oman, the elder brother of Syud Sultan. In 1H02 the Wahabees had reduced to nominal submission the principality of Seer, or the Joasmee territory ; nor was it until after 1804 that the Joasmees, or, what would be a more just designation, the W ahabee Joasmees, commenced their piratical depiedations. On the conclusion of the treaty with them in 1806 Captain Seton represented 'the whole bulk of the Joasmees desirous of returning to their former mercantile pursuits.' VJhatever may have been their disposition in that respect, they had not the power of gratifying it. In 1808, when their depredations first extended to the Indian Seas, Shaikh Sultan, the Joasmee Chief, possessed only the port of Ras-ool-Khyma, and his power being shortly after completely superseded, by the appointment of Wahabee officers to the charge of districts throughout his territories, he was inveigled up to Deriah, and imprisoned by the Wahabee Shaikh. He made his escape, reached Muskat, and sought the protection of the Imaum. The Joasmees were rendered independent of their lawful Shaikh, whose territories were placed under the vicegerency of Hussan bin Ali, the Joasmee Chief of Ramse, who had acknowledged the supremacy of the Wahabee Shaikh, and carried on piracy under his express orders and59 ARAB TRIBES. protection, on the conaitlon o f assigning to Mn. one. fif t h of the valne 0f Se= tnaaetwo ^ Chief in his hereditary possessio , d atShargah) and Shaikh Sultan, w.th ^In bin Rehma is now in charge of the and occasionally at ''SV ^ con , oint i y with his brother Ibrahim bin Government oi: R ^-° hat OTOtl i cr of the brothers always commands Rehma an i i» ^ a iratical cru i s e.

The Imaum of Muskat has no greater merit: with more powerful resources to maintain its inde- pendence, His Highness was equally compelled to preserve the existence of his Government by an abject submission to the authority of the Wahabee Chief. The Imaum acknowledged allegiance to the VV ahabees, and his whole fleet would have engaged in piracy but for the timely interposition of the British Government in 1809. The Records of the Bombay Government, and every other authority I have consulted, fully corroborate the fact, that previously to the estab- Iishment of the Wahabee power,—and I would except also the period from 1694-95 to 1736, during the ascendancy of the Muskat Arabs — the tribes in the Gulf were engaged in commercial enterprise ; in the cultivation of extensive groves of the date tree ; and in the pursuit of a ucrative pearl fishery : their vessels resorting to the ports of India emen, Africa, Sind, Kutch, and Bussora, which afforded profitable' employment to the maritime portion of the population of the Gulf. It is a very extraordinary fact,—at least I have not been able to trace anything to the contrary,—that during the whole period of the ascen dancy of the Wahabee power in the Gulf, the Imaum of Muskat has not lost an inch of territory, nor a single port, that belonged to his ancestors, on the shores of Oman. Neither has he any claim to the ports of the Joasmees. Oman has from the earliest ages been divided between two tribes, the Beni Yemen or Beni Hinavi, and the Beni Nasir or Beni Gafree. The maum is the head of the first, and his ancestors have possessed one of tie two principalities into which the province is divided, namely liastag, of which Muskat is the principal port. The Chief of the Joasmees is the head of the other tribe, and has for ages possessed the other principality, called Seer or Julfar, of which Ras-ool-Khyma is the chief seaport. His ancestors settled in Oman belore those of the Imaum of Muskat.OBSERVATIONS on the PAST POLICY OF IHE BEITISH GOTEENMENT towards the AEAB TRIBES OF THE PERSIAN GULF. by LIEUTENANT A. B.

Tho Treatie. for the Abolition otthe Slave Trade are given in this Selection nnder a distinct head.]BRITISH POLICY IN THE PERSIAN GULF. The general policy of the British Government in relation with the Arab States is fully apparent from the annexed Treaties. It remains but to be shown how far the course adopted by Government has proved adequate to the attainment of the one great and principal end,—the entire suppression of piracy, and consequent security to the trade and traders o a11 natlo ns. The measures pursued in the support of this line of policy have ever been mild and conciliatory ; but a constant sur veillance, and an unremitting vigilance, aided by the occasional demonstration of power (without, however, its actual exercise since 1820, one instance in 1835 alone excepted), have nevertheless been essentially necessary to render it of avail. 8 ia dually improving civilization and increased commercial interests of the inhabitants of the maritime Arab States, induced by these restraints to war and piracy, creating to a certain degree a desire on their own part for perfect tranquillity on the seas, have removed many great difficulties which at first existed, and enabled the Government of late years to diminish the great annual expenditure on account of the naval establishment employed in their watch and observation, by its reduction to the complement of one sloop of war, one brig, one schooner, and the Resident's yacht, without at the same time lessening its influence, or incurring any great danger of a renewal of former disorders. It must nevertheless be borne in mind,—when the poverty, habits of rapine, and interminable blood feuds (the heir-loom of the Arab); and when the enticing prospects of rich booty to be obtained from a course of piracy, are considered,—that the Arabs have been so lono- restrained and impelled to the faithful observance, with few exceptions, of their engagements with the Government, by the dread of its power alone, and the assurance that punishment would immediately follow their slightest breach. The disorders and irregularities arising out of the blood feuds existing on land afford a pretty good proof of what would occur at sea, were it not for the restraining power of the British Government. Experience has shown that the most solemn engagements betweenBRITISH POLICY IN THE PERSIAN GULF. formed without the guarantee of the T. ■«, .1....... &lt;« .h.»».»'«&lt;■'P'-; 'w-y y rjg a in fit; fnv their beinff set aside and disregarded.

War at sea, if previously proclaimed, was consequently not precluded to the subscribers. The sentiments of Government on this point were at the time thus expressed ' Oar relations to the Arab States afforded no grounds for interference to restrain their mutual attacks. It is true that Article IV. of Sir W. Grant Keir's Treaty mentions peace among themselves as one oi the alterations in the condition of the Arabs introduced by that engagement, but this appears to have been rather an explanation of the intention of the flag, than any distinct stipulation ; and it was explained by Sir W. Grant Keir, in the 7th paragraph of his letter accompanying the Treaty, to have been designed, among other purposes, to demon strate our determination not to interfere with the petty feuds of the subscribing powers, while they continued to observe the stipulations of the Treaty. In these circumstances, Government could scarcely pretend to the power of imposing any restraint on the motions of vessels intended for a purpose of lawful warfare.' The total cessation of warfare at sea was nevertheless anxiously desiicd by most of the chieftains, and many indeed themselves enter tained the belief that it was thus provided in Article IV. of the Treaty. From the foregoing extract, however, it is seen that the Government was not prepared at that time to take upon itself the responsibility which such a line of policy must have entailed, in the investigation and settlement of such endless complaints and claims, and the redress of such giievances as must in that case have been referred to it for arbitration and decision ; and the following explanation of this Article was accordingly given by Major Wilson to Shaikhs Sultan bin Suggur, Abdoolla bin Ahmed, and others, on their expressing their conviction that it involved a total prohibition of hostilities. * The irregular habits of the Arabs rendered it necessary, in the opinion of Sir W. Grant Keir, that the Treaty concluded by him should not be strictly enforced for a considerable period after it was concluded. The numerous petty wars between the different Chiefs of the Gulf rendered it at all times difficult to distinguish in that sea between acts of piracy and operations of lawful warfare.BRITISH POLICY IN THE PERSIAN GULF. ^ a Piratical war being in existence previous to the conclusion of this Treaty with the pacificated Arabs, it was necessary, for the purpose of introducing the new order of things which the Treaty announces in Article T.,* that these piratical wars should be brought to a termination : with this view Article IV. of the Treaty was inserted. « The meaning of this Article, when taken in conjunction with the definition of acknowledged war to be found in Article II., becomes perfectly apparent, and it may be thus developed , « The pacificated Arabs shall all of them continue in their former political relations with each other, with the exception that as all piratical wars shall henceforward cease, they shall be at peace with t le British Government, and shall not fight with each other in the same piratical manner ; and the flag is a symbol of this, viz. that piratical wars have ceased, and of nothing further. ^ « It is not, and therefore never can be called, with propriety, the British flag; it is only the flag of certain friends of the British, who may, by the adoption of this flag, be desirous to avoid the risk of being confounded with pirates. There is nothing in these Articles which prevents the Arabs declaring war ; but whenever they do so, they are required to fight after the manner of acknowledged war, which Article II. defines to be that which is proclaimed, avowed, and ordered, by Government against Government. The British Government has always ' said that it will consider all wars that are not acknowledged as piratical, and treat whoever may be engaged in them accordingly ; and the latter part of Article II. states that the killing of men, and taking of goods, without proclamation, avowal, and the order of a Government, is plunder and piracy. _ • • ,1 ' The British Government being most desirous to maintain to the whole of the Arab Tribes inhabiting the shores of this Gulf the blessings of peace and tranquillity, is most ready on all occasions to offer its mediation where disputes may exist, and will always rejoice at their peaceable and happy termination; whilst it avows most distinctly its absolute determination not to tolerate for a moment any piratical practices, and it will look to the different chieftains for the maintenance of due order among all their subjects.' With reference to Article V., the irregular habits of the Arabs, who could never be brought to understand the meaning and aim of the papers required, very shortly proved the futility ol the attempt to * A rticle I .-There shall be a cessation of plunder and piracy, by land and sea, on the part of the Arabs who are parties to this contract, for ever. t The true version -.-The pacificated Arabs shall all of them continue in their former rela- tions, with the exception that they shall be at peace with the British Government, and shall not fight with each other; and the flag shall he a symhol of tins only, and of nothing fmther. 9BRITISH POLICY IN THE PERSIAN GULF. enforce adherence to the provisions it contained, from the great trouble and difficulty attending it, and the irritation and ill feeling it excited.* No occasion has even arisen for calling into operation Articles VI and VI1. The contending chiefs have been occasionally reminded of the exist ence of such an Article as the eighth, and that it maybe enforced ; but it has always been considered desirable to avoid all minute inquiries regarding the treatment of people who may have been captured in the course of hostilities, from the extreme difficulty of substantiating the facts, which would be invariably denied, and the destruction of an enemy palliated or accounted for by the excuse of self-defence, the ardour of the combat, or the obstinacy of the opponent. The enterprise and resources of the piratical tribes having once been directed into a legitimate channel, and gradually given rise to habits of honest industry, and the more lawful and peaceable pursuits of civilized life, it became a great desideratum to prevent the occurrence of any accidents, such as petty wars among themselves, which, from affording an opening and pretext to the evil disposed, have a decided tendency to degenerate into piracy, and a general plunder of all defenceless vessels. Towards the attainment of this end, it was in May 1835, immediately subsequent to the outbreak of the Beniyas Tribes in that year, suggested, that a material check might be given to this evil, were the several tribes prohibited from cruising with their war-boats in the track of the Gulf trade, lying between the Persian Coast and the islands of Surdy and Bomosa, and thus a neutral ground established, upon which the maritime Arabs would be precluded from carrying on hostilities under any circumstances. In January 1836 it was personally intimated by the Resident, under authority from Government, to the several chiefs from Debaye to Ras- ool-Khyma, that the excursions of their war-boats must be thenceforth strictly confined within a line drawn from Shaum to within ten miles south of Bomosa, and thence onward through the island of Seir Aboneid; and that the commanders of the vessels of the Gulf squadron had been instructed to seize any of the boats found on the hither side, or * Moreover, the refusal to grant registers would have produced no good effect, but, on the contrary, have tended to confound ships employed in authorised hostilities with those engaged in piratical depredations; and the non-observance of the conditions considered as a check to piracy was of no great importance, for piracies, since the formation of this Treaty, have usually been committed in boats of the class employed in the fishery, which did not require passes, and usually escaped to the creeks,—at all events avoided our cruisers,—leaving the infliction of their punishment to be sought at the hands of the chief who acknowledged them as subjects, from whose territory they had last set out, or in whose territory they had taken refuge.BRITISH POLICY IN THE PERSIAN GULF, 67 neutral ground, which, from their want of eargo, or their being manned or armed in sueh away, admitted no doubt of their ohjeets not be, ng peaceful. Sultan bin Suggur having represented that he had so - times occasion to send his war-boats round Cape Musseldom for purposes connected with the protection of his territories on the coast of Khor Fukaun* he was informed that previous to his doing so le must make known his wishes to, and obtain the sanction of, the Com modore at Bassadore, who was at the same time instructed that it was desirable,*}' if possible, that the prescribed limits should be enforce upon the Joasmee Chief, in common with others, especially from the month of October to July, the period of the great commercial inter course between the Gulf and India. _ &lt; ■ j a In consideration of the late excesses of the Beniyas, it was judged expedient to limit, for a period, the cruising of their armed boats to within sight of their own coast; and this was officially intimated to their chief. . The only chief absolutely requiring an establishment of war-vessels is the Shaikh of Bahrein, whose independence, from his vicinity to the Wahabee power, to which he has been long opposed, must in a great measure hinge upon his superiority at sea ; yet the cruising of his armed boats could at the same time easily be confined to the limits of the isolated part of the Gulf in which his principal territory is situated. On the occasion, therefore, of some irregularities and piratical acts, committed on the Persian Coast by the sons of the Bahrein Chief whilst in rebellion against their father, this restrictive line was subsequently made applicable to Huailah and Bahrein, by being extended from Hawlool, ten miles north of Ras Reccan, through the island of El Kraan to Ras Zoor, on the main, a measure which was assented to by the .Uttoobee Chief in a letter dated the 26th March 1836. Although the entire limits thus laid down were sufficiently defined for all the required objects, and the concurrence of the Arabian Chiefs in the establishment of the restrictive line had been by implication afforded, yet, with the exception of the letter from Abdoolla bin Ahmed at. Bahrein, no formal intimation of their consent in writing had been obtained. It was therefore resolved by the Indian and Home Go vernments, at the suggestion of the Resident, Captain Hennell, that * Acquired by his taking advantage of the disturbed state of the Imaum's affairs in 1832, when he was only prevented from making further encroachments upon His Highness dominions by the active interference of the British Government. t Not only as guarding against the long-established predatory spirit of the Joasmee Tribe upon the most exposed point of the Gulf, but as at least affording a negative protection to our ancient ally the Imauni, against any further sudden act of aggression by sea on the part of Sultan bin Suggur.f!8 BRITISH POLICY IN THE PERSIAN GULF. previous to any application from the Arabian Chiefs to be permitted o declare war against each other at any future period bcin. acceded to they should be required to furnish a written and formal recognition atlendedto ^ mstractlons which have since been carefully At thls also, (May 1835,) a favourable opportunity offering for he establishment of a peace between the hostile chieftains, by the •md sT'n 0re S . haikh Sultan bin 8U ^'' Joasmee Chief, and Shaikh Shakboot, the father of the Beniyas Chief, and his plenipo- ternary in the adjustment of the claims arising out of the late piracies of the tribe a vessel of war was despatched to Debaye, with an invitation Obcd bin Saeed, one of the Shaikhs of that place, to join the conference Phis chief promptly attended to the summons, and was immediately followed by Rashid bin Humeed, the Shaikh of Eiman and head of the A1 Naeem Tribe. ' Every argument and endeavour to reconcile their jarring interests, or adjust their conflicting claims for reparation and satisfaction on account of past injuries, were entirely thrown away, especially as they deemed the guarantee of the British to any sort of arrangement a sine qua non. The proposition of a Maritime Truce for six months was, however, favourably received, and the agreement having been drawn out, was duly signed and sealed by the respective parties, upon whom it was at the same time fully impressed, that any infraction would be treated as a case of piracy, without any reference to inland disputes. To this anangement they expressed their perfect approval and consent.f * One slight exception may here be mentioned. While war threatened in 1838 to take place between Bahrein and the A1 All Tribe (under its Chief Esai bin Tarif), Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed most unaccountably and unexpectedly objected to hostilities being confined within any limits, under the impression (it was with justice supposed) that the British Government was prepared to do anything rather than see hostilities break out between himself and Aboothabee (where the seceded tribe resided), and in the hope, therefore, that hostilities would be forbid den, and his fugitive subjects compelled to return to their allegiance. Although this chief ought to have made his objections upon the establishment of the restrictive line &amp; three years previously, yet, as he was an independent chief, who had generally observed the conditions of the Treaty of 1820 more carefully than any other person in the Gulf, he was informed that it would not be held binding upon him. On its objects being, however, at the time made known to him, and its being further explained that he had everything to lose and nothing to gain by its being suspended, he tacitly withdrew his dissent. t Of the great importance attached by the maritime Arabs to an uninterrupted pearl fishery an idea may be formed, from the circumstance that some of the principal merchants of Shargah, in a private communication with the Agent at that place, offered to guarantee to the Indian Government the sum of twenty dollars per annum for each boat that went out to the pearl banks, provided they were taken under its immediate protection, and a vessel of war especially deputed to guard them from aggression. Such a proposition of course could not tee entertained, but it shows the desire of the mercantile part of the maritime Arabs for peace,BRITISH POLICY IN THE PERSIAN GULP.

Thus precluded from the illicit profits to be derived from piratical depredations at sea, it became a matter o vi a importance to secure to all the tribes, in common, peace and tranquillity, while engaged in the practice of their vocation on the pearl banks, an the prosecution of their carrying trade, the only means which (the bar renness and infertility of the soil of their country, producing no sufficient for the maintenance of the inhabitants, being called to mind) nature has placed within their reach for gaining a livelihood, and upon the success of which must depend the extent of commerce and degree of prosperity and happiness among them. The interests, moreover, ot humanity and good policy dictate the prevention of outrage and aggression on these seas, by every precautionary measure, rather than the punishment and coercion of such when perpetrated by the rude and uncivilized tribes in these quarters. By submitting to the Maritime Truce,f the parties have bound themselves not to engage in hostilities on the sea under any circumstances. On the occurrence of disputes of such a nature as not to be amicably arranged by mediation and mutual concession, but to-render necessary a recourse to arms, the struggle must be held on land ; but should these disputes have had their origin in depredations and unprovoked aggressions by sea, and at sea, then the aggrieved chief is entitled to * A copy of this Maritime Truce will be found at page 86 of this Selection. A few (la3S before the expiration of this truce (1st June 1853) a ' Perpetual Treaty of Peace, ^ a ^ e( the 4th May 1853, was agreed upon by the Chiefs of the Arabian Coast. A copy of this Treaty is also annexed.— Editor. t Tire nature of our connection with the Arabs who were parties to the Treaty (previous to the conclusion of the Maritime Truce), and the import of Article IV. of that Treaty, no doubt gave great weight to endeavours to prevent hostilities by means of explanation and mediation, and entitled us to demand from each chief an explicit declaration of his intention to go to war with any other power in the Gulf; but that war once announced, 'ue had no further control over the proceedings of the belligerents than might be necessary to pie\ent a renewal of the system of general depredation.— (Government letter No. 329,15th March 1823.)BRITISH POLICY IN THE PERSIAN GULF. demand redress at the hands of the third party, or guarantee for the maintenance of the conditions of the truce inviolate; and these condi tions are, with the perfect knowledge of all, only held to apply to aggressions on the sea by one boat upon another, and not to those cases where boats, drawing up on shore in the creeks and backwaters, are attacked and robbed by the Bedouins. The interference of the Resident towards redress in such cannot be claimed. Circumstances may possibly arise, calling for the temporary suspension of the operation of the restrictive line, and this contingency forms the only objection to imposing any restraint of this nature on the Arabs with whom we have treaties, arising out of the impossibility of exerting a similar control over other States not so bound, the settlement of whose disputes with the former would be involved in intricacy and difficulty. In cases where lawless and unprovoked aggressions have been made at sea by such a power, not authorised by open war, and the remon strances and mediatory interposition of the British authority have failed to procure redress for the injured and aggravated chief, justice and good policy would demand that the latter should be permitted to have recourse to his own means to exact it; and further, that the British authorities, having exerted their influence without effect to bring his opponent to a proper sense of his injustice, should restrain any of the other chiefs, subscribers to the truce, from interfering in any way, but certainly from affording his assistance to that opponent. Such a precedent has not up to the present date occurred, and permission* has, on the other hand, ever been denied to any chief, * Two examples may here be cited. In the middle of the year 1835, when the Shaikh of Amulgavine expressed his wish to assist the people of Charak, it was assumed as a point with him, that whatever claims of superiority he might formerly have possessed over the Charak people, now they had located themselves in Persia they had become Persian subjects, and conse quently he could not, situated as he was, have any right to interfere actively in their quarrels. And again, in October 1843, when three of the Shaikhs of the Coast of Oman (Sultan bin Sug- gur, Suggur bin Sultan, and Muktoom bin Butye) applied for permission to afford aid to the ex-Chief Abdoolla bin Ahmed of Bahrein, in regaining his lost authority over that island, it was well known at the time that overtures had been made by the lattcr's opponents, Mahomed bin Khaleefa and his colleagues, to the Shaikhs of Aboothabee (Klialeefa bin Shakboot) and Amulgavine (Abdoolla bin Rashid), and that these chiefs were prepared to join them. A posi tive refusal was therefore imperatively called for, and was made in the following terms to the ex-chief through whom the application had been made ' It is not hidden from you that Mahomed bin Khaleefa, Esai bin Tarif, and their colleagues, being heads of tribes inhabiting Bahrein, the British Government could not interfere in their quarrel with you ; but Sultan bin Suggur and the other chiefs mentioned have no connection or interest in the war, and you are aware that if they become your active allies, Mahomed bin Khaleefa and Esai bin Tarif would undoubtedly immediately crave the assistance of Khaleefa bin Shakboot and other chiefs. The result would be confusion throughout the Gulf, and enmity between all the tribes ; moreover, no benefit would accrue to yourself. For these reasons, it is not possible that I should grant my concurrence to the inter-BRITISH POLICY IN THE PERSIAN GULP. 73 a party to the truce, incited by avarice and a prospect of booty, and desiring without just cause to mix himself up in the quarrels of others, not subscribers to the truce, in the result of which he has no immediate interest or concern, on the grounds that if grained it would afloid a plea to those bound, equally with himself, not to wage war at sea, whereon to base a similar right to espouse the cause of the opponent with whom he proposes to ally himself, and thus cause in the first instance an indirect violation of the restrictive line and Maritime Truce, whose obligations would be very shortly entirely forgotten and set aside by the allies themselves on either side necessarily becoming principals. Piracies are now of rare occurrence in these seas. Slight cases of aggression, unattended with bloodshed, have almost annually occurred, and must ever be expected occasionally to occur, upon the pearl banks. Their origin is almost invariably to be traced to the practice of debtors avoiding the settlement of claims against them,* on account of advances of money (for the purchase of provisions during the unemployed portion of the year, considered as a remuneration beforehand for services to be hereafter rendered on the pearl banks), by deserting their own chief, and taking refuge with another ; and the subsequent attempts of their lawful head, or of their creditors, forcibly to recover possession of their per sons, or of the amount due by them, or its equivalent from the boat in which they sail, belonging to the tribe they may have joined. For such aggressions and irregularities at sea, it is incumbent upon the Biitish Resident, by the terms and spirit of the Maritime Truce, to exact redress. Attempts have been made to induce the several chiefs to enter into a mutual agreement among themselves, without British guarantee, to refuse refuge to such fugitives ; but these have ever been rendered nugatory by Arab pride and sense of honour, as the prospect of the advantage which each chief (forming his own, and therefore of course the most favour able estimate of the popularity and attractiveness of his particular I ference in any way of the chiefs of the Coast of Oman, who are intimately connected with the British Government by agreements, and a truce among themselves made its guarantee. It may be here remarked that in the latter case the applicants, although considering them selves in honour bound to evince at least the pretence of exertion in favour of their ancient friend and ally, yet experienced great satisfaction at having it in their power to adduce the unanswerable argument of the restraining power of the British Government, contrary to whose wishes they were not prepared to act. It must be remembered, too, and to this they were fully alive, that by assisting the ex-chief they would have given umbrage to the ahabee ruler. Ameer Fysul, the powerful ally of his opponent, and that, moreover, they had every thing to lose and nothing to gain by engaging in a profitless warfare, to the prejudice of their trade, and the interruption of the pearl fishery. * For an accurate and interesting description of the pearl fishery, and an account of the system of loans and advances to pearl divers, vide Welsted's Travels, Vol. I.

Government and territory, whether on the grounds of leniency and indulgence in the exaction of more moderate taxes, superior military prowess and renown, or greater commercial advantages) anticipates from a numerical increase to his subjects, and consequent improved revenue and influence. The first principle of our policy enjoining, for obvious reasons, a total non-interference in local matters concerning only themselves, and the false position in which the assumption of the right of insisting upon every fugitive being given up to his own chief would evidently place us, as being calculated to remove the only check at present existing to the tyranny and oppression of the chief over his subjects, constitute powerful arguments against affording the required guarantee, or inde pendently striking a blow at the root of the evil, however much it may be desirable to remedy it. The piratical Arab Chiefs, satisfied of the advantages obtained by the establishment of the Maritime Truce, which, by common consent, precluding hostilities with each other, removes the chance of a relapse into a system of general depredations, and unprovoked aggressions, are now quite as much interested in its maintenance as ourselves ; and of this they exhibited ample proof in their united readiness to renew it for so long a period as ten years, or even more, had such been desired or deemed expedient. As before observed, however, it would be too much to suppose that so radical a change has been or will for a length of time to come be effected, as to admit of the total with drawal of that influence and political control which have, from their wise and mild exercise, rendered this Gulf, whose coasts are inhabited by a brave, rapacious, and cruel people, brought up and nurtured from their childhood among scenes of bloodshed, and licentious and treacher ous warfare on land, comparatively as safe and open to the trade and navigation of vessels of all nations, as the seas of any other portion of the world.75 TREATIES WITH THE ARAB TRIBES OF THE PERSIAN GULF.

There is established a lasting peace between the British Government and the Arab Tribes, who are parties to this Contract, on the following conditions:— • A rticle I. There shall be a cessation of plunder and piracy, by land and sea, on the pait of the Arabs who are parties to this Contract, for ever. A rticle II. If any individual of the people of the Arabs contracting shall attack any that pass by land or sea, of any nation whatsoever, in the way of plunder and piracy, and not of acknowledged war, he shall be account ed an enemy of all mankind, and shall be held to have forfeited both life and goods; and acknowledged war is that which is proclaimed, avowed, and ordered by Government against Government, and the killing of men and taking of goods without proclamation, avowal, and the order of Government, is plunder and piracy. A rticle III. The friendly (literally the pacificated) O Arabs shall carry, by land and sea, a red flag, with or without letters in it, at their option ; and this shall be in a border of white, the breadth of the white in the border being equal to the breadth of the red, as represented in the margin, the whole forming the flag known in the British Navy by the title of ' White pierced Red' ; and this shall be the flag of the friendly Arabs, and they shall use it, and no other.OF THE PERSIAN GULF. 77 Article IV. The pacificated tribes shall all of them continue in their former relations, with the exception that they shall be at peace with the British Government, and shall not fight with each other; and the flag shall be a symbol of this only, and of nothing further. Article V. The vessels of the friendly Arabs shall all of them have in their possession a paper (' Register'), signed with the signature of their chief, in which shall be the name of the vessel, its length, its breadth, and how many karahs it holds ; and they shall also have in their possession another writing (' Port Clearance'), signed with the signature of their chief, in which shall be the name of the owner, the name of the Na- khooda, the number of men, the number of arms, from whence sailed, at what time, and to what port bound ; and if a British or other vessel meets them, they shall produce the Register and the Clearance. Article VI. The friendly Arabs, if they choose, shall send an envoy to the British Residency in the Persian Gulf, with the necessary accompaniments, and he shall remain there for the transaction of their business with the Residency ; and the British Government, if it chooses, shall send an envoy to them also in like manner, and the envoy shall add his signa- ture to the signature of the chief, in the paper (' Register') of their vessels, which contains the length of the vessel, its breadth, and ton nage; the signature of the envoy to be renewed every year.

The putting men to death after they have given up their arms is an act of piracy, and not of acknowled ged war; and if any tribe shall put to death any persons, either Mahomedans or others, after they have given up their arms, such tribe shall be held to have broken the peace, and the friendly Arabs shall act against them, in conjunction with the British, and, God willing, the war against them shall not cease until the sur render of those who performed the act, and of those who ordered it.78 TREATIES WITH THE ARAB TRIBES A rticle IX. The earrying oflf cf slaves (men, women, or children) from the eoasts of Africa or elsewhere, and the transporting them in vessels, is plunder and piracy ; and the friendly Arabs shall do nothing of this nature.

AND EELATIONS of the TRIBES INHABITING THE ARABIAN SHORES OF THE PERSIAN GULF. by LIEUTENANT A. B. KEMBALL, Bombay Artillert, ASSISTANT RESIDENT AT BUSHIRE. Submitted to Government on the 6ih January 1815.92 MEMORANDA on the \ RESOURCES, LOCALITIES, AND RELATIONS OF THE TRIBES INHABITING THE ARABIAN SHORES OF THE PERSIAN GULF. T he total non-interference in the internal disputes and affairs of the piratical Arabian Chieftains, wisely enjoined as the first principle of the Government policy, added to the absence of any intercourse, com mercial or otherwise, with their ports, by individuals and vessels of any nation, have precluded the attainment of any specific and accurate knowledge of inland localities, and extent of population and territory. To fix the limits, therefore, of the lands actually belonging to, or claimed by, each tribe respectively, would, with our present information, be impossible ; nor, indeed, do these often form the grounds of any great altercations or hostilities among themselves, owing to the barren ness and inlertility of the soil; which being, moreover, very imperfectly cultivated, in consequence, probably, of the absence of the means or labour of irrigation, does not yield sufficient for the support* of its inhabitants in even their common article of food,—dates,—the fruit of a tree which may be said to be generally indigenous to Arabia alone, and renders its possession, accordingly, of no worth. Upon the success of the pearl fishery, and the profits of the carrying trade which it brings into operation, must, under these disadvantages, depend the means of obtaining the positive necessaries of life, and those trifling luxuries desirable to an Arab.f It is needless to observe how * The Arabian ports, particularly Aboothabee, are consequently dependent upon other places for supplies of provisions, and are soon reduced to great distress by anything like an effective blockade. t Captain McLeod, in reporting upon the Joasmee Tribe in 1823, stated as follows — ' The Joasmees procure all their materials for building, as well as their warlike stores, from Muskat, Bahrein, and the Persian ports in the lower part of the Gulf. In the construction of their vessels they use no other wood than Indian teak, and, in respect to arms, those prin- cipally of Persian manufacture. They possess no articles of export, since their pearls are gene rally purchased by merchants on the spot, and the produce of their country is not even suffi cient for their maintenance. Their only employment is fishing, diving for pearls, and importingCHARACTER AND SUBDIVISION OF THE TRIBES. 93 materially their own condition, and, by an easily deduced corollary, the safety of the Gulf, might be affected by the failure of a single season. The attention with which this point has been considered by the Government, in framing its policy, marks the anxiety and care, attended with great expense, which have been devoted to the main tenance of perfect tranquillity and security on the pearl banks to the subjects of the several petty chieftains who, however inimically disposed, are bound there to forget their quarrels, or suffer them to rest in abeyance. The manners and religion of the Arabs of the piratical coast, being those appertaining to the Soonee sect of Mahomedans, are already too well and generally known to call for any further description in this paper. Of a character deceitful, vindictive, and treacherous, but brave and independent withal, they hold in utter contempt all other nations^ pro fessing whatever creed 5 the conviction of the irresistible power of the British Government, whose weight they have in two instances been collectively brought to feel, together with its subsequent occasional exercise or demonstration in individual cases, have alone reduced them to succumb to its will, and restrained them from acts of piracy. They do not at the present time hesitate to admit, that the restraints imposed upon them once withdrawn, their boats, now, in their own phraseo- logy, ignobly employed as beasts of burthen, to carry about dates and merchandize, would again, as in former days, overrun this Gulf and the Indian Seas in search of booty. The inhabitants are divided into a number of large tribes, acknow ledging each its feudal superior, which are, again, sub-divided into branches or clans, composed of the relatives and dependents of some connexion of the general head, or of a powerful and wealthy individual. The superior of the tribe collectively has the general control of all; possesses the right of claiming at his pleasure their military services } and appropriates the small taxes that are levied. dates, grain, and other necessaries of life, which they purchase with the price of those pearls. Their dates are chiefh' brought from Bahrein and Bussora, grain and cloth from Muskat and the Persian ports. They are very poor, and, perhaps, can never find much employment in commerce, unless in carrying for others, although it is said they at one time possessed a very extensive trade.' The same holds good for the tribes in general to the present day, except that their own boats are now engaged in the Indian trade. Such was the original object of the Maritime Truce, guaranteed by Government, and enter ed into for the six months including the season of the pearl fishery. At the request of some, and with the concurrence of all the Chiefs, its time was extended to eight and twelve months, and finally to ten years, during which all hostilities at sea are forbidden.94 CHARACTER AND RELATIONSHIP OF THE TRIBES The Kazee, or Ecclesiastical Judge, constitutes the only tribunal and decides upon all cases according to the Mahomedan law. It is by no means uncommon for one of the branches of a tribe, to the number sometimes of several hundred individuals, in order to escape excessive taxation and oppression, or with a view to secure to themselves greater immunities and advantages, to secede from the authority and territory of their lawful and acknowledged chief into that of another, # or to establish themselves and build a fort on some other spot,! and assert and maintain independence ; nor is it a matter of great moment that the chief they are about to join, or whose friend ship and countenance they must in the first place command, is a rival at implacable feud with their own : the advantages attending any numerical increase of subjects ensure them welcome asylum and protection. It will not escape observation, that the facilities thus mutually offered to seceders on the one hand, and the loss of authority and revenue consequent on their secession on the other, act, vice versa, as a salutary check to the tyranny and oppression of the respective chiefs. The Arabs of the coast are more or less connected with the Bedouin tribes of the interior, either by ties of relationship, or from consideration of mutual interests and defence. Of so great impoitance is their alliance or forbearance considered by the maritime chieftains, that these, particularly Sultan bin Suggur, who is especially interested in maintaining a sort of balance of power, find it their best policy to conciliate them by repeated and considerable presents. To go over from one chief to another, with whom they may be or have been at feud, and even to plunder the territories and subjects of their patron, should he not coincide in, and follow out their views of ambition, honour, or revenge, or withhold the usual payment of blackmail, are shown by the sketches of the Arab tribes to be of constant occurrence with these fickle allies. Kh alee fa bin Shakboot may be said to possess the greater influence inland, and to command the services of the greater number of Bedouin auxiliaries. v The Boo Muhair, at Shargah, are an example of the former, t The Boo Felasa, of Debaye, of the latter.DESCRIPTION OF THE ARABIAN COAST. 95 DESCRIPTION OF THE ARABIAN COAST. From Koweit to Dhabran, a ruined position, four Furseekhs north of Kateef, the country bears the name of Adan. It Memoranda, collected is generally void of towns, but in the summer, from living Native authori- gome of the Khalid Arabs, as the Amayir ties, descriptive ot the uoast -n -i- * of Arabia from the mouth and Sobaik, inhabit Fantas and ranaitis, two positions on the coast, a day's distance sonth of Colonel R. Taylor, Politi- Koweit. Three days further on, m the same cal Agent, Turkish Arabia. directionj is the i s l an d Balbul, slightly separated from the shore during the time of flood. Two days south-east of Balbul is the island of Jinnah, similar to the last. South of this, three days, is the island Boo Ali, with a long point running into the sea, and a flat shallow between it and the shore, as the island last mentioned. Further south-eastward, by one day, is Ras Tannurah ; a day south-east of this is Kateef. The whole country just traced is called Adan. Kateef, however, and its district southward to Ojair, together with the territory of Bahrein and A1 Ahsa, and the country between the last and Ojair,—all this tract is denominat ed Hajar. Kateef, though, is also peculiarly named A1 Khah ; Bahrein, Awal; and A1 Ahsa, Haajar. From Ojair to the ports of the Beniyas, the country is named Qatar, and is so called from the greater fall of rain therein than in the other portions of the Beni Khalid territory. Ojair is about four Furseekhs south-east of Bahrein; on the coast, half a day south-east of this, is a tract of land inhabited by the Beni Khalid Arabs in the spring and autumn, and containing shallow wells, or springs of water. Two days hence is Zabara, a place forty years past of some note, and considerable population and trade. One Furseekh south of this is Ras Ashairij; three Furseekhs hence north-east Khor Hassan, the residence of the Yalahermah, a division of the Atul Arabs; hence, a day north-east, is Huailah. Two Furseekhs onwards is Yusa- fiah ; then four Furseekhs to Rowaidhah ; two days south of this station is Fuwairit; south-east hence, a day, is Matbakh. Two hours south of Matbakh commences a tract of land, composed of sandy hillocks, and uninhabited for an extent of four days in length from north to south; from this, south-eastward, lie the ports of the Beniyas, the commence ment of the province of Oman, and the end of that of Hajar. The whole of these districts, Adan, Hajar, and Qatar, from Koweit to the ports of the Beniyas, belong to the Beni Khalid. A day to the westward of Koweit is Jahrah, situated two Furseekhs south -eastward of the angle of a bay. Its site is elevated, and gives a view of all vessels passing in the Gulf near Koweit, and the island of96 DESCRIPTION OF THE ARABIAN COAST. Pheleechi. In the ages previous to Islam, it was extremely populous as its very extensive existing remains evince; in which ancient coins also are occasionally found. These occupy a space of ground two Furseekhs in length from north to south, by one in breadth from east to west. J he soil is saline and sandy to a great extent all around, but the water is sweet in wells at a fathom deep. . To tlie north-east of Jahrah fourteen Furseekhs, towards the sea, is situated the town of Sabbeyyah, anciently well peopled, as here also'its ruins declare. It derives its name, as is said, from the Sabeans, and is supposed to be the remains of one of their cities, built after the destruc tion ofBabel. Moslem historians declare that it continued flourishing down to the age of the Dhurmiad Khaliphs, when it fell, and its popu lation dispersed; some of whom are, it is asserted, still living in Khujistan. The Arabs dwell in this spot during summer, invited by its cooler temperature. The extent of the Beni Khalid territory, inland, varies at different points : from Koweit to Dehna, the frontier of Nujd, is a distance of ten days; from Adan to the same point eight days; the same from the vicinity of the Balbul and Boo Ali districts ; from Kateef thither nine days ; and from /obara to Dehna thirteen days. On clearing the mouth of the Euphrates, bound for the Arab shore you reach the bay or Dohat of Hajee Silo ; south-east of which is the anchorage, or Khore Mughanwee; and to the south-west Khore Abdal- lah. Between this last and Bubean is the rocky shallow or Dieh Ras- al-Kaid, which lies off the eastern point of the island of Bubean; whence are formed two anchorages, the southern one termed Warbah' and the northern Rabac-iyyah ; both which extend to the inlets o^ channels Khuair and Sabbeyyah, ^ The next point is Duwairah, the port of the Zobier, situated on the Khuair, which is interposed between Duwairah and Dohat Hajee Silo. Along the Khuair there are several islands and Khores. Of the more remarkable positions, however, are A1 Haddamah, a c osed Khore ; Kasr Ash Shatan-iyyah ; A1 Bahaith ; Khuar Ath Tha- a-ahl ; Dohat-al-Bagar, opposite to which, on Bubean, is the closed Khore Rawaishid, and A1 Maghasil. Next is Sabbeyyah, a building at the outlet of the Khuair, and oppo- site to Birshah, the south-eastern point of Bubean. South of this is the island of Mashkan ; eastward of Mashkan is the rocky shallow Aich-al- Holaibe ; and northward those of the Sabbeyyah channel. Between this island and the shallows there is a passage for smaller boats ; and to t e south of it is the island of Pheleechi ; south of this, Ohah ; and eastward of Ohah a Gussar, or shallow flat.DESCRIPTION OF THE ARABIAN COAST. 97 Next, Ras-al-Gussar; then Dohat Khawaitir; opposite which is the bank, or Rigadh Dharub, formed entirely of mud.

The town consists of cadjan huts, constructed of date sticks and mats, around the fort on every side. Stone dwelling-houses are rare, and Shargah and Ras-ool-Khy- ma can alone boast of them. PIRATICAL PORTS. The Piratical Ports one and all have their sites near a backwater, on the spit of land formed by it and the sea. R as R eccan to C assaab. These backwaters afford perfect security to their largest boats (un laden) during the stormy season. The line of coast on which they are situated possesses no harbour of any description, and is, moreover, uniformly exposed to the prevailing winds, which blow from the north-west. The anchorage, too, is bad. From Ras Reccan to Aboothabee is crowded with shoals, and other obstacles to safe navigation. A steamer may anchor off the several ports at a very short distance from the shore, from three-quarters to a quarter of a mile, but a sailing vessel could not take up such a position without considerable risk. Aboothabee. At Aboothabee it was ascertained by sounding that the Hugh Lindsay (in July 1839) could have lain within pistol-shot of the shore. Amulgavine, The Hugh Lindsay, during the same cruise, anchored at Amulgavine in six and a half fathoms, sand, three-quarters of a mile off the western tower, south -western rocky point bearing SSE. ; town fort south Appears quite safe, having six, five and a half, five, and four and a half fathoms in shore of the vessel.

Grant eir in 1820, or rather, perhaps, previous to his confinement by the ahabees in 1811, held supremacy over Amulgavine and Ejman, and exacted tribute from the chiefs of those towns. Since that period however, and up to the present day, these have enjoyed virtual inde' pendence, notwithstanding his repeated attempts, principally by intrigue, and on one or two occasions by actual force, to re-establish his lost authority. They have, it is true, once or twice acknowledged his general supremacy, but this was merely nominal, and lasted so Ion- only as the danger of an attack with his superior means appeared to threaten them. Sultan bin Suggur, on the other hand, has been obliged publicly to disclaim authority over these places, and to decline respon sibility for the proceedings of their inhabitants. The following was remarked by Captain MacLeod in 1823 ' Sultan bin Suggur is ambitious of reducing the tribes to complete and absolute subjection, and to be considered answerable for the whole of the coast. It is impossible for us to recognise his authority any further than it is obeyed by the other chiefs, nor can we lend the influence of our name in any way to aid his views ; at the same time, we cannot directly interfere to prevent him from recovering that authority which he regards as his birthright.' Such would appear to have been the sole aim of his ambition since that period ; nor have any obstacles been opposed by the British Government to his lawful exertions towards its attainment, beyond such as are involved in the terms of the Maritime Truce. Sultan bin Suggur, Chief of the Joasmees, aged between sixty and sixty-five years, succeeded to the Shaikhdom of the tribe in 1803, upon the death of his father, Suggur, who had assumed the chief authority in ] / 77, upon his father Rashid bin Muttur's retiring from public life, and resigning the office. Invited to Deriah in 1809, he proceeded to that capital, and was detained and imprisoned by the Wahabee Chief, one Hussein bin Ali, a Joasmee, being appointed in his room Wahabee vicegerent in the Seer principality. He contrived to escape from prison, and, finding his way to Yemen, embarked at Mocha, and proceeded to Muskat, and, thiough the Imaum's influence and protection, was established at Shargah. It was not, however, till 1813, that by the same instru mentality he recovered his lost position at Ras-ool-Khyma, when the Governor, Hussein bin Ramah, his relative, but born of a concubine, continued to exercise general control. Sultan bin Suggur had three brothers, the one Saleh (of a slave girl), still ali\e, the other two, Mahomed and Muttur, deceased.CHIEFS—JOASMEES—ABOOTHABEE—BENIY AS—DEBAYE.

As no duties or customs are levied upon the imports and exports ot Bahrein, the revenue of the Shaikh is principally derived from the produce of the date plantations, nearly the whole of which have been seized from the original owners by the Uttoobees. The total sum realized from this source may amount to 100,000 crowns per annum; but as this is divided in different proportions among the numerous relatives and connexions of the Uttoobee Chief, it is impossible to say what portion reaches his own coffers. Shaikh Abdoolla, however, derives a small income from the pearl boats, each of which pays from five to ten crowns, according to its size, on its return from the bank _ The chief articles of export from Bahrein consist of pearls, dried dates, and bullion. Of the former, about 350,000 crowns' worth are annually collected by the vessels belonging to the place, and something more than that quantity is brought in from other parts of the Gulf for sale. The total value of the exports may amount to about eight lakhs of dollars annually. The imports are principally from India, and are composed of rice, cotton, cloths, calicoes, spices, &amp;c. to the extent of perhaps 600,000 dollars each year. Of these articles one-fourth may be expended in Bahrein, the remainder being re-exported to the different ports of the Gulf. About thirteen years ago the Shaikh began to levy regular customs upon the commerce of Bahrein, but after a trial of seven years the attempt was abandoned as a failuie. The only towns of any size are Munama and Muharag, near the harbour, and two smaller ones, called Ruffa and Jour, situated at some distance inland. It is said that formerly Bahrein possessed upwards of 300 villages, but at present there are not above fifty hamlets, averag ing about twenty houses each. No fixed taxes are taken from the inha- bitants, but whenever the Shaikh requires money, he levies forced contri butions, particularly on the Bahreinees (or aborigines of the island), who, being descendants of the old Persian settlers, and consequently Sheeas in their religious tenets, are greatly oppressed. This class, perhaps, consists of about fifteen thousand individuals, while the Arab inhabitants, calling themselves Uttoobees, may be reckoned at an equal number, although those really belonging to this tribe do not exceed a thousand. The Uttoobee Chief can muster a greater number of vessels than any other power in the Gulf. He has twelve large Buggalows, which are never employed in trade, and in cases of emergency he prohibits the departure of the merchant Buggalows which traffic with India : these consist of twenty-five, some of them of the first class, and most of the others of a respectable size. In addition to the above, twelve Buteels 14106 BAHREIN. and Ghoonchas are engaged in the Indian trade. The boats emploved in the pearl fishery may be reckoned at about eight hundred. The climate of the island is bad, and the inhabitants suffer more t lan those of other places when any contagious disease appears in the he rava g es of the cholera when it breaks out arc very much greater there than in any other towns on the Arabian or Persian Coasts , nU fever 18 also Prevalent at certain seasons, and stran-ers sleeping on shore are liable to suffer from its deadly effects. Upon the whole, with the exception of Muskat, Kishm, and Bassadore, Bahrein may be considered the most unhealthy place in this quarter of the globe. The power of the Bahrein Chief has of late years been much weak ened, by the contumacious conduct of his sons, and the divisions which lave arisen among his other relations. Some of them, particularly the ami y of lns nephew, Khaleefa, are supposed to be friendlily disposed towards the Imaum. The secession of Esai bin Tarif, with 400 iollowers, has also been productive of injurious consequences to Shaikh Abdoolla the more so as that person, who is a man of great courage and energy, has now closely connected himself with the Government of Muskat, and, through its influence, will probably aid materially in promoting the views of Korshid Pasha in Bahrein. Observations.Such was the description, and detail of resources, &amp;c. of the island of Bahrein, as given by Captain Hennell in 1839. Since that period, owing to the increased dissensions, and subsequent hostili ties between the members and relatives of the ruling family, the popula tion, prosperity, and commerce of the island have gradually declined. Numbers of the principal and most wealthy inhabitants, to avoid the effects of increased anarchy and confusion, fled, upon the commence ment of actual hostilities, to Koweit on the Arabian, and Lingah and other places on the Persian Coast, where they have since temporarily located themselves, in order to watch the course of events, and return with the first signs of peace and established government, and conse- quent security to life and property. Although the de facto ruler Mahomed bin Khaleefa^ has met with no decided opposition to his authority since his ejection of the old chief, his grand uncle, from the island, m April 1843, through the assistance of the latter's aggrieved and justly disaffected subjects, Esai bin Tarif and Bushire bin Ramah yet Abdoolla bin Ahmed, refusing all compromise or understanding which does not stipulate his re-establishment in his former position and authority, continues to reside at Nabend, on the Persian Coast, havino- at his disposal four or five moderate sized vessels ; and his intrigues and overtures, having for their object to engage in his favour the assistance and countenance of the Wahabee ruler, Ameer Fysul,107 BAHREIN. together with bis occasional capture of the Bahrein ll ' adlng J^^ proving that he has not abandoned his hostile des.gns, are not calculated ,0 liTlaT^f B C uggalows (not'including those belonging to the anthon- tiesl tMrty to forty of the size employed in the Gulf trade, and from five hundred to six hundred pearl boats, probably make up at t i • • to- r»f this once extremely commercial and fertile present time ^ shtppmg ^ ^ foimed by ^ wilson) island; which, accoi g = large vessels, the property of rS^a^^ h^ed, and the other ShaiUhs his L':: mounting in all about fifty guns; ^ jtrt vessels now in Bahrein ; five hundred common fishing and car^o boats • and fifteen hundred pearl fishing-boats.

Esai bin Tarif and Bushire bin Ramah, after their successful at upon Bahrein, removed with their dependents to Biddah, a dependency of that island, upon the Guttur Coast. Esai and his tribe, numbering about a thousand men capable o bear- in- arms, possess three large Buggalows (one copper bottom), which rade to°India • five Buteels, each from eighty to a hundred tons; eleven laige Buteels and Buggalows; and about a hundred and thirty pearl boats..108 BIDDAII—WUKRA—ADEED. Biddah. Biddah, inhabited principally by the Soodan Tribe, is situated on the south side of a bay, formed by two dangerous reefs running out to the sea, and approaching at their extremities so near to each other as to leave little more than room for a ship of the size of a sloop of war to be warped through. Once inside, however, the anchorage is safe, and a vessel of war can lie within something less than a mile from the town which contains about three hundred houses, and could muster six or seven hundred fighting men. Lieutenant Grubb, I. N., in 1822, described Biddah ' as a most miserable place : not a blade of grass nor any kind of vegetation near it; the water good, procured, they said, at some distance. The anchorage in the inner harbour very good, four fathoms, being about one-eighth of a mile from the shore, surrounded by a reef nearly dry, which forms a complete basm, the entrance to which is very narrow, but deep, and fiee trom danger. Not so in approaching it, as the water is very shoal about seven miles out, there being two and a half fathoms, sand, and a good deal of sea in a north-wester.' Wukra. The town of Wukra did not exist at the time of the survey, having heen since erected by the present Chief, Ali bin Nasir, who, with his tribe (the Boo Ejman) formerly resided in Biddah, but having offended the Uttoobee Shaikh, the dwellings of himself and followers were estroyed by that chief, who contemplated their forcible transfer to ah rein. To avoid this offensive arrangement, Ali bin Nasir and his troe took possesion of the site of their present residence, at the foot of J u 3 ml Wukra. The town is situated upon the open sea beach, which, however, cannot be approached nearer than three miles by our vessels of war in consequence of the coast being lined by a shallow and danger ous reef. Its fortifications consist of a small square fort, flanked by three towers, in the centre of the town, which is surrounded on the land side by a wall, with a tower on either side. Beyond the walls are two others detached, one of which, upon a slight elevation, commands the wells which supply the inhabitants with water. The place con tains about 250 houses, and, including the pearl fishers and the Be douins occasionally residing there, can collect upon emergency between live and six hundred fighting men, Adeed.

On the western and protected side of the island fhe shoals run out so far that s earners and the smallest sized ships could not approach nearer than four miles. On the eastern side there is water enough at half this istance, but then the anchorage is exposed, and there are no inha- bitants. A Koweit has unquestionably for the last twenty years been considered as closely connected with the Pasllalic of Bagdad. The vessels belonging to that port all carry the Turkish flag, and Shaikh Subah the Governor, receives an annual allowance of 200 karahs of dates from C.iubda, by the express order of the Pasha, in return for which he is bound to protect Bussora from foreign aggression. Koweit is one of the ports which have benefited by the internal dis turbances and hostilities on the island of Bahrein. Kateef, Situated forty miles to the north of Bahrein, possesses a very respect able and spacious fort. The citadel is strong, having been built by the Portuguese when they had possession of Bahrein; and the whole fort is in good repair, but surrounded by dense groves of date trees, which run c ose up to the walls on three sides, the fourth being washed by the sea. Kateef contains 500 houses, and at least a like number of fighting men — (Lieutenant Edmunds, 1839.) The approach by sea can only be attempted by vessels of small draft, and then only at high-water.

After proceeding ahout six miles, the soil becomes more sandy, but is quite firm, and the load winds between hillocks of sand, which command it. Hence for about three miles further several small ascents occur, over very deep sand, rhe plain of Lahsa, with its date trees, now first seen. Three miles further, pass the village of Jishah, on the right, close to the road. It is encompassed by a wall of about 250 yards square, seven or eight feet ■g . 'ith small towers at intervals. Between Ojair and Jishah eieaieno habitations, and of course supplies of any kind are not procurable. From Jishah to Foozool; time an hour and a half.—About half a mile beyond Jishah, pass the village of Jufoor on the left. Same descrip tion, but larger than Jishah. Now enter the date groves, which con. inue tor one or two miles, whence you again debouch into open coun try, leaving Foozool on your left. The roads through the date groves are narrow, but very good; they have watercourses on either side. icse courses are in many places connected by cuts across the road over which small bridges of date sticks are thrown, but sometimes so narrow that artillery could not pass over them. Indeed most formidable im pediments might be raised to the passage of artillery, by cutting down the date trees, and laying them across the road, and by trenching the road, and connecting the watercourses. I was informed that by mak ing a detour these groves might be avoided, butlhad not an opportunity of surveying the country. Foozool is of the same description as Jishah and Jufoor, but larger than either. The houses are built of stone and clay, and have fiat mud roofs.

They extend to the walls of iioofoof. 1 hey are intended for the protection of the date groves, and are capable or containing fifteen or twenty men.HOOFOOF. 113 Hoofoof. Hoofoof is the capital of Lahsa, and is a town of considerable extent. It is surrounded by an outer wall, seven or eight feet in height, and one or two in thickness, with several towers at intervals. Entering by the eastern side of the town, and passing through the suburbs by veiy narrow streets, you arrive after a short distance at the fort. The fort is a square of about six or seven hundred yards each side, except to the north-west, where the wall takes a direction to the north, and thus commands the north face. The walls are buul ot small stones and clay. They are about twenty or twenty-five feet in height, by seven or eight feet thick, with towers forty or fifty feet in height, at intervals of forty or fifty yards. The wall is surrounded by a dry ditch fifteen or twenty feet deep, and of the-same breadth. Between the ditch and the wall is a level space, with a breastwork of mud and stone, commanding the ditch and ground in front, and going all rouiwl the fort. There are two entrances to the fort, one on the northern, and the other on the eastern side. The walls of the fort are open on the northern and western sides, but suburbs approach to the eastern and southern faces. The gateway to the north leads into a considerable square, or open space, on the eastern side of which is the citadel. It has high walls, with towers at intervals, similar to those of the fort. Within are numer ous houses, and a mosque, the dome of which is the most conspicuous object in the whole town. The houses of Hoofoof are built of stone and clay, and are flat-roofed. The streets are narrow. There are date groves close to the walls on the western side. To the north, these are three or four hundred yards in front. Ihe giound beyond the suburbs on the other two sides is clear. A market is held at Hoofoof every Thursday, to which people from the neighbouring villages bring their goods for sale. Next in importance to Hoofoof is Muburrij, which is situated between two and three miles to the north of the former. The fort which defends it is to the west of, and detached from the town; it is siarrounded by a dry ditch. Hoofoof and Muburrij, with their dependencies, are said to contain a population of 16,000 men capable of bearing arms. About two miles to the north-west of Hoofoof is the Aeen-ool-Nujm. This is a hot spring, of very abundant and most translucid water : it possesses no peculiar smell or taste, and is said to be most beneficial in cutaneous disorders. There is no vegetation near this spring. It is covered by an ancient dome. 15114 ROUTE FROM HOOFOOF TO KATEEF. Tradition asserts that a star, falling from heaven, produced this spring- others maintain that a person named Nujm built a village on this spot' and that it owes its appellation to this circumstance. ^ Four or five miles to the eastward of Hoofoof are the Gibul Garah. These hills are destitute of vegetation, of no great height, and are famous foi the natural caves they contain. The one visited was forty paces in length, by twenty paces broad ; height about twenty or twenty-five feet. Another cave was stated to be in these hills, of greater length, but not so broad. The natives resort to these caves in the hotter months of the year. Dates appear to be the chief produce of Lahsa; rice and wheat are also cultivated in considerable quantities. Water from springs is eveiywhere extremely abundant, and fruit trees, lucerne, and vege tables thrive in the date groves in a most luxuriant manner. ROUTE FROM HOOFOOF TO KATEEF. Distance. Remarks.

Brymee is a town of considerable size, built of sun-dried bricks, and surrounded by a wall constructed of similar material; but the greater part of the town is represented to be in a dilapidated state, and the wall a perfect ruin. On the south side of the town, however, in an open plain, is a fort, nearly square, surrounded by a dry ditch, about twenty- foui fret wide, inside of which is a wall, about eight feet high, for the protection of matchlockmen while defending the ditch.

The two tribes who reside in the part of Oman visited, are the Beni Kaab and Beni Kuttub ; the latter a Bedouin Tribe, without any fixed place of residence, numbering about 600 men. The Beni Kaab inhabit that part of the country between Gibul Yiff and Hurmullioh ; they are estimated at 600 men. The road from Shargah to Brymee is difficult, while that from Sohar to Brymee may be considered good. Plenty of water the whole way ; forage for camels abundant, but none for horses.CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE OF EVENTS CONNECTED WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF MUSKAT, FROM THE YEAR 1730 to 1843; WITH THE JOASMEE TRIBE OF ARABS, FROM THE YEAR 1765 to 1843; WITH THE UTTOOBEE TRIBE OF ARABS (BAHREIN), FROM THE YEAR 1716 to 1844; WITH THE WAHABEE TRIBE OF ARABS, FROM THE YEAR 1795 to 1844; WITH THE BENIYAS TRIBE OF ARABS, FROM THE YEAR 1793 to 1843; AND WITH THE DEBAYE (BOO FELASA) TRIBE OF ARABS, FROM THE YEAR 1834 to 1843, THE WHOLE PREPARED, IN THE YEAR 1844, BY LIEUTENANT A.

The Muskatees boldly and peremptorily refuse the demand of Persia for tribute. A large fleet, with troops, sails against Bushire, but the ships, dispersing, return to Muskat. Efforts to negotiate a peace between the Imaum and Persia fail, the former considering the conditions proposed dis graceful. A Muskat fleet proceeds to relieve Bussora, besieged by the Persians. It defeats the Bushire boats, and becomes master of the river, but the town being compelled ultimately to surrender, returns to port. Syud Sultan, the second son of Syud Ahmed, succeeds to the Imaumship, usurping the authority of his elder brother, the rightful heir, and confining him to the city of Bombac, and its immediate vicinity, the usual residence of thelmaum. An engagement is entered into by the Iraaum with the British Government, to exclude the French and Dutch from having any factory within his territories, or at Gombroon ; to prevent the ships of the former nation entering the cove ; and to dismiss the French, who were at the time, and had been for many years, in his service. The Imaum, with a view the more effectually to prosecute his hostile intentions against Bussora, on account of some ancient claims on the Pasha of Bagdad, negotiates a peace with his formidable enemy the Joasmee Chief.

The Imaum, sailing with a large fleet to attack the Uttoobees, and led ace Bahiein, seizes the only three vessels belonging to them. 1 he X^ttoobees apply for aid to Shaikh Nassir of Bushire, who proceeds to Bahrein, and receives the tribute for 1798. The Irnaum, in return, by means of intrigues, obtains possession of the island of Karrack. He amicably adjusts matters with the Uttoobees, and the Shaikh of Bushire, and returns to Muskat. Colonel Malcolm, touching at Muskat on his embassy to Persia, enters into an agreement, in confirmation of that of 1798, with the Imaum, who was supposed to have fa voured the intrigues of the French, The Imaum proceeds towards Ras-ool-Khyma, where he joins Shaikh Suggur, with a view to oppose the threatened inva sion of Oman by the Wahabees, which is, however, averted by the conclusion of a peace. The Tmaum accomplishes his favourite object of reducing Bahrein. The Uttoobees, however, retake it in a few months. The Wahabee influence and power having greatly in- creased, the Imaum, unable to check its progress, accedes to a tiuce of tluee years \vith them. The AVahabee ruler, returning fiom his victorious career on the western frontier of Arabia (to allow of his prosecuting which the truce had been formed), now, in violation of the same, prepares to attack Oman by land and sea. The conquest of the pro vince was arrested by the murder of the Wahabee Shaikh, Abdool Azeez, early in the month of November. Syud Sultan is killed in an engagement with the Uttoobees, joined by the Joasmees, off the bar of Bussora river. Another account has it that he was killed by some Aza Arabs (a bianch of the Joasmee Iribe), wliile going on shore at Kishm. The administration of affairs devolves upon his two sons, who being young and unprotected, their pretensions are disput ed by their uncle.

The management of affairs is entrusted by the two sons to Syud Beder, their cousin, who, with the Wahabee Chiefs assistance, defeats Ghes. Syud Beder recovers Bunder Abbas and Ormus, of which places the Shaikh of Kishm, availing himself of the troubles that had ensued on the death of the late Imaum, had pos sessed himself. Syud Saeed, the second son of the late Imaum, who had now succeeded Syud Beder, defeats an expedition against Mukran by the Joasmee pirates. An attack by the Imaum against Khore Fukaun fails, in consequence of the treacherous desertion of an auxiliary Chief of the Fajarah Tribe. The Imaum narrowly escapes to his ship, and Syud Ghes loses his life in the aftray, and is succeeded by his son Azan. The W ahabees establish their influence at Muskat, and commence to propagate by violence the tenets of their particular sect. Some instances of oppression on their part, indeed the common danger, reunited the Shaikhs of Oman, who determine on a vigorous resistance to Saood. An expedition was despatched by the British Government, for the protection of Muskat against the Wahabees, in order that a well disposed ally might not be converted into a dangerous enemy, through their influence and compul sion; and for the suppression of the Joasmee pirates (Vide Joasmees.) The Imaum's brother sails on an expedition against Bahrein and Zobara. The latter is taken, plundered, and levelled with the ground. The troops and battering train are landed on the former, where the brother of the governor, and the Duryah Begee of the Wahabee fleet, with fifteen of their principal officers, are made prisoners. An expedition by the Imaum against Ras-ool-Khyma, for the puipose of reinstating Sultan bin Suggur, fails. A second expedition had started, when the chiefs and inhabitants send a mediator to him, to solicit peace, which the Imaum grants, and returns to the island of Ormus. Ihe Imaum's fleet is beaten oft by the Joasmee fleet, and his fiigate, the Caroline, nearly taken. He returns to Muskat,MUSKAT. 125 Date.

The Imaum, accompanied by boats from the coast of Persia, attacks Bahrein, but is signally defeated. He proceeds to Congoon for a Persian reinforcement, for the purpose of renewing the attack. Discovering the treachery of the Persian Government, who contemplate the seizure of him self and the different Arab Chiefs, he quits the coast, and the expedition is abandoned. The Imaum blockades Ras-ool-Khyma for four months, but is unable to effect anything against it. The Imaum co-operates with the British expedition, under Sir W. Grant Keir, against the piratical ports. The Imaum, in concert with a British detachment from Kishm, under the political and military control of Captain Thomp son, attacks the Beni Boo Ali Tribe of Jaalan, The com bined force is defeated. The whole proceedings entirely disapproved by Government. A large detachment is despatched from Bombay against the Beni Boo Ali Tribe, defeats them, killing five hundred of their number, and taking the rest prisoners, and blows up the works and defences of their town. The Beni Boo Ali prisoners (who were taken to Bombay) restored to their former seats and residences, and 25,000 German crowns advanced by Government, to enable them to repair and rebuild their dwellings. The Imaum intercepts the Shaikh of Bushire on his return from Mecca, and captures his two vessels, having previously captured the Noosrut Shah, also belonging to the Shaikh. The Iraaum blockades Bussora, but shortly withdraws his fleet, on his claims being adjusted. Shaikh Abdool Russool, Governor of Bushire, restored to liberty, and his two vessels also given up to him, on his giving a bond for 80,000 German crowns. The Imaum marries the daughter of the Prince of Shiraz. The Imaum, accompanied by Shaikh Tahnoon of Aboothabeej and a body of the Beniyas Tribe, attacks Bahrein, and is defeated, with considerable loss, being himself slightly wounded. The failure was attributable to the imprudence or treachery of the Beniyas' allies.MUSKAT. Occurrences. A small vessel, belonging to Mr. Shipton, a British subject, is attacked and plundered on her way from the Red Sea by some dependents of the Imaum. His Highness obtains satisfaction from the pirates, and affords redress to the Government. The British merchant ship Oscar, having run ashore off the Coast of Jaalan, is plundered of her cargo by the Beni Boo Ali and Beni Boo Hussain Tribes, to the amount of eight lakhs of rupees. Five vessels proceed to that quarter, and partial redress is obtained. The Imaum invites Syud Hullal, the Governor of Soweik, to Muskat, and treacherously seizes and detains him a prisoner. He then sails for his African possessions. Syud Hullal's sister harasses the Imaum's territories, and Syud Humood bin Azan bin Ghes recovers from the Imaum his patrimony of Sohar. The safety of Muskat is compromised, and that town is saved by the intervention of the British Government. The Imaum returns to Muskat, and attacks Sohar, but fails to reduce it; is compelled to come to terms with Syud Humood, who agrees to pay tribute, retaining the districts of Khizza, Khaloora, Markies, and Sohar, Shinas and Ghillal are restored to His Highness, who liberates Syud Hullal, and permits him to return to Soweik. The Imaum, accompanied by the Shaikh, and a force from Ejman, attacks Sohar: having rejected the alliance of the Beniyas, they join his opponents ; and his allies, the Beni Naeem of Ejman, treacherously turning against him, he is defeated, and compelled to patch up a peace with the Sohar Chief, upon nearly the same terms as the former. The I maum, having collected a force of Beloochees, quits Muskat for his African possessions, leaving his son, Syud Hullal bin Saeed, and nephew, Mahomed bin Salim, as his representatives at Muskat. Shortly after his departure, the persons left in charge of the Government, proceeding to Burka, are confined as prisoners there by its Chief, Saood bin Ali, who proceeds immediately against Musnaah, held by the mother of Mahomed bin Salim, but fails to reduce it.

Sultan bin Suggur seizes Khore Fukaun, Khulla, and Dibbah, ports on the Batinah Coast. The British Government, determined upon upholding the Imaum's Government, and preserving the integrity of his dominions, despatch a naval force to Muskat, to support the local Government, and check the designs of their enemies, and the Resident ad dresses letters of remonstrance to the several invading chiefs. The Imaum returns to restore order. The British Govern ment declines to interfere to compel the Joasmee Chief to give up the towns of which he had taken possession dur ing his absence. The Imaum, with the cognisance of the British authorities, enters into closer connection with the Wahabees; agrees to pay 5,000 German crowns as Zukat. A further engage ment is formed, fixing the limits of the territories of each according as they then existed, and binding the parties reciprocally to assist in putting down any rebellions which might arise in their respective dominions. The execution of the last act the Imaum declared to the British Govern ment should depend upon its views and wishes. A cruel piracy, committed on a Kutch Nowry off Zanzibar, is traced by His Highness to some Beni Hajir of Soor. He seizes and places the offenders at the disposal of the Resident, as also a'n individual who had been one of the chief actors in the piracy on a Dutch brig in 1829, who had hitherto evaded detection. The latter is sent to Bombay, but escapes punishment, from the absence of evidence to convict him. A. further exertion of British influence becomes necessary, to check the designs of aggrandisement on the part of Humood bin Azan, who had taken possession of Rastag, and threatened other places. He is informed, that by committing further aggressions against the territories of the Imaum he would incur the penalty of being considered an enemy of the British Government. This has not the full effect. He attacks S9weik, and partially gains possession of the town, but is shortly driven out, with some loss. The128 MUSKAT. Occurrences. a. d . 1836 Muskat authorities imprudently invite the Piratical Arab Tribes to their assistance. The Imaum enters into engagements with Syud bin Mootluk, the Wahabee Agent, with a view to the expulsion of Humood bin Azan from the places of which he had illegal ly and forcibly obtained possession. The combined forces invest Sohar by land and sea, but the Imaum learning that, in the event of the place falling, the Wahabee Agent me ditated retaining and garrisoning it in the name of his master, separates from his ally, and relinquishes the expedi tion. He shortly after proceeds to his African possessions. The Imaum, principally through the assistance and gallant behaviour of Esai bin Tarif, and his dependents, succeeds in reducing Mombassa, which had revolted from his authority. The Imaum returns from Africa in September, and is guided by the advice and views of the British Government in his intercourse and relations with the Egyptians. The letters of their Agents receive no attention. He exhorts and encourages the Brymee Shaikhs to unite and maintain their independence against the invaders. The Imaum threatens to send a force to attack Bushire, in consequence of the murder of his Agent, a Persian subject, in that town, on his return from Teheran, where he had been with a view to negotiate a marriage between His Highness and one of the Persian Princesses. A reconciliation is effected between the Imaum and Humood bin Azan, of Sohar, through the mediation of the British Resident. Captain Hamerton appointed British Agent at Muskat; is subsequently created a Consul by the Home Government, and directed to establish himself at Zanzibar. The blockade of the ports held by the Egyptians being con templated, the Imaum places his vessels at the disposal of the British Government, whenever required. His Highness returns to Zanzibar. Humood bin Azan visits Bombay, and is received with all suitable respect and attention by the British Government.

A piracy, attended with murder, is committed by six Nujdees of Muskat, who had been lately dismissed from the service of the Imaum, upon a Kishm boat, in which they had taken passage. The pirates arc discovered at Cheeroo, and handed over to the British authorities, who subsequently send them, agreeably to instructions from Government, to- Muskat, with a desire that they might be made to suffer adequate punishment. The authorities of Muskat supply Esai bin Tarif and his colleagues with ammunition and military stores, but decline taking any active interference in their contest with Bahrein, without the sanction of His Highness, who refers them for the sentiments of the British Government on the subject. These were opposed to his taking part in the civil war. A force, sent by the Imaum against his rebellious subjects of Sevee, is defeated, with great slaughter. JOASMEES. Date. Occurrences. a. d. 1765 1777 1780 The Joasmees, called in to aid the Governor of Ormus, Gombroon, and Minao, in resisting the unjust levy of tribute on the part of the Persian Government, take possession of the towns of Kishm, Luft, Lingah, and Shinas (on the Persian Coast). Kishm and Luft are subsequently reco vered by the Persian Government. Shaikh Rashid, of Ras-ool-Khyma, resigns the Shaikhdom in favour of his son, Suggur. Shaikh Suggur, failing to negotiate a peace between the Persians and Uttoobees, who had taken and plundered Bahrein, joins Shaikh Nassir of Bushire in an expedition for the recovery of the island. These attempts for reducing Bahrein are repeatedly made, and not abandoned until 1785.130 JOASMEES. 1797 Occurrences. The Joasmees seize the Bassein Snow, a British vessel, charged with public despatches, but release her two days after. The Joasmees, after having by professions of friendship, &amp;c. procured ammunition from the Viper cruiser, treacherously attack that vessel in Bushire Roads, but are beaten off. Shaikh Suggur dying, is succeeded by his son, Sultan. Wahabee influence and authority lead to the vigorous renew al of piracy. The Joasmees capture two British vessels, the Shannon and Trimmer, and a fleet of forty sail surround and fire into the Mornington cruiser, but are compelled to sheer off. V Joasmee fleet is blockaded at Kishm by a combined British and Muskat force, and is reduced to such distress as to solicit a peace. The Trimmer was restored, the Shannon having been previously given up, completely stripped. An agreement is entered into between the British Govern ment and the Joasmees, dated 6th February. It does not appear to have been negotiated with the consent, or even the knowledge, of the Wahabee Shaikh. The Joasmees join Syud Beder, the Imaum, against Syud Ghes, of Sohar. Precluded by the Treaty of 1806 to carry on their cruises in the Gulf, the Joasmees, urged and instigated by the Wa- habees, extend them to India; and, rendered independent of their lawful Shaikh, Sultan, by the Wahabee ruler, send out their boats without his permission, and capture twenty country craft on the coast to the northward of Bombay. They commit a breach of the Treaty of 1806, and attack and capture the Sylph cruiser in the Gulf. She is immediately retaken by His Majesty's frigate Nereid, which heaves in sight. and The Persians from Lar attack Lingah and Charrak, compel the Joasmees to retire to Bassadore.

The British Government, determining to relieve the Imaum from the power of the Wahabees, and to suppress their piracies, despatch an expedition to the Gulf. Ras-ool-Khyma, vigorously attacked by sea and land, is taken, after a bloody resistance. The town, with the vessels in port, amounting to upwards of fifty, with the English prize ship Minerva, burnt. The expedition then proceeds to Lingah, and destroys twenty Dows; thence, after passing Congoon, Bunder Mullim, and Homeram, to Luft. The town is soon occupied, but all attempts to carry the fort by storm fail. The bombard ment continued. The fort is sunendered, together with property to the amount of two lakhs of rupees, belonging to the Imaum, which, with the fort, are handed over to His Highness. Shinas attacked by the combined British and Imaum's forces. After an obstinate and sanguinary resistance, the fort sur renders, and is made over to His Highness ; but now in so ruined a state that it cannot be occupied. The pirates reappear in the beginning of this year, and destroy several large Native craft, belonging to Bussora and Congoon. Boats carrying British colours do not escape, and others are detained at Porebunder, and pre vented from prosecuting their mercantile pursuits. An expedition by the Imaum against Ras -ool-Khyma, with the view of reinstating Sultan bin Suggur, fails. A second expedition this year, for a similar purpose, ter minates in a peace concluded between the Imaum of Muskat and the Joasmees, to which Shaikh Suggur is compelled to become a party.

They take three vessels belonging to Surat, and murder many of their crews : the loss of property by this capture estimated at ten lakhs of rupees. Many other captures made of British vessels, under circumstances of similar atrocity; and finally the British armed boat Turrarow. 1817 A small squadron of Joasmee boats proceeds to Busheab ; the crew land, burn, and pillage the villages on the western part of the island, and carry off all the cattle, killing great num bers of the inhabitants. 1817-18 They enter the harbour of Aseeloo, and take five large laden Buggalows, valued at three lakhs of rupees, and murder their crews. They proceed to Congoon, but, finding the place prepared to receive them, weigh, and proceed to Daire, where they land, and destroy a number of date trees.

Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur claims general supremacy over all the Joasmee ports. The British Government recognise the assumption of this authority on his part in as far only as it is acknowledged and obeyed by the several chiefs. Ejman in the first instance refuses, but subsequently tenders allegiance to him. The Shaikh of Ramse is deposed by Shaikh Sultan bin Sug gur, and succeeded by Mahomed Abdool Rahman, the son of a former Shaikh, who had been removed by Hussain bin Ali (the Wahabee vicegerent). Shaikh Guzeeb bin Ahmed, of Jazirat-ool-Hamrah, dies, and is succeeded by Shaikh Mahzem bin Abdool Rahman ; who, dying, is succeeded by his son, Mahomed ; who, giving umbrage to the Joasmee Chief, is removed by him, and Ahmed bin Abdoolla established in his room. A piracy, attended with cruelty, is committed by two Shargah boats upon a Buggalow belonging to Socotra. A strict watch being kept, in order to seize them on their return, one is abandoned by its crew at Charrak, and the other takes refuge at Muttra, where, having remained unmolested for several months, no further steps are taken regarding it. The Joasmee Chief opens a communication with the Wa- habees, who had lately obtained considerable successes over the Turks, assigning self-preservation as his motive. Owing to the intriguing and faithless conduct of the Joasmee Chief, hostilities arise between him and Shaikh Tahnoon of Aboothabee, and are the occasion of various irregulari ties. An amicable adjustment is effected in October, through the influence of the Imaum. 1824 1824-25 1827 1828 Hostilities again break out between the Joasmees and Beni- yas, the latter having seized Debaye ; but a peace is soon concluded. A most atrocious and cruel piracy is committed by a Joas mee boat, under one Mooslim bin Rashid, upon a Sohar boat, which, after plundering, he scuttles.

The British ship Sunhury visiting Shargah, her Captain and crew are ill-treated, in consequence of her meditating to visit Aboothabee, with which place the Joasmees are at war ; an insult is further offered, in pulling down the flag. Sultan bin Suggur affords satisfaction, by burning the first boat that boarded the Sunhury, and flogging the indi vidual who hauled down the flag. The Joasmee Chief, receiving a subsidy from the Imaum, promises him his aid against Sohar ; but, with his usual want of faith, fails in performance. The Shaikh of Ejman, similarly subsidised, joins His Highness, but, on the defeat of the troops of the latter, declaring in favour of the people of Sohar, treacherously turns his arms against his late allies. His town and date groves are plundered and in jured, during his absence, by a party of Beniyas, sent by Shaikh Tahnoon of Aboothabee. hostilities are in consequence declared between the Joas mees and Beniyas, but through the mediation of Mahomed bin Guzeeb, of Lingah, a peace is again concluded. Sultan bin Suggur intimates his intention of declaring war against the Imaum of Muskat, and of immediately com mencing hostilities. Previous to the receipt of an answer from the Resident, and to the arrival of the British naval force at Muskat, to the assistance of the existing Govern ment, he, by surprise or treachery, obtains possession of the ports of Khore Fukaun, Khulla, and Bibbah, on the Coast of Batinah.

Shaikh Rashid, of Ejraan, on a naval force appearing before his port, affords the required redress, on account of the plunder of Muskat and other vessels (not including those oi bohar, with which place he was at war). A large fleet of Joasmee vessels, under the command of Sultan bin Suggur in percson, come to Bushire, with a view to assist Shaikh Nassir, the hereditary Governor of Bushire who had been ejected by the Shiraz authorities, and had instituted a blockade of the port. According to previous agreement, the plunder of the place was to have been the reward of a successful attack. The Joasmees are prevented by the British authorities from carrying out their intention.

Both sides, much distressed, and de- prived of the benefits of the pearl fishery, are glad to con- elude a peace, which is mediated by Syud bin Guzeeb, the Shaikh of Lingah. The influence of the Wahabees in favour of the Beniyas is insufficient to prevent these proceedings on the part of the Joasmees. Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur proceeds with a large fleet to his possessions on the Batinah Coast, ostensibly for the purpose of assisting the authorities of Muskat in their civil broils (agreeable to the desire of the Imaum, on his leaving for his13() JO ASM EES.

Two Debaye men being killed by a party of six, of whom two are subjects of A mulgavine, the satisfaction offered by that chief, in the shape of blood money, is refused. The Shaikh of Debaye proceeds to foray the neighbourhood of mulgavine, but is defeated, with the loss of six men made prisoners. The Shaikh of Shargah requiring the liberation of these, is refused, and joins the Shaikh of Debaye. 1 heir united forces march against Amulgavine, whose in habitants are decoyed to some distance by a pretended flight, and, suddenly attacked and overwhelmed, are com pelled to retreat, with the loss of twenty men killed, and many wounded.

Captain Hamexton is despatched to Brymee, with a view to collect all the information in his power relative to that place and its inhabitants. Owing to the intrigues of the Joasmee Chiefs, and the Shaikh of Debaye, who offers every obstacle to the prosecution of the Mission, it is not without great difficulty and delay, nor until the principal Brymee Shaikh voluntarily offers to accompany him, that he is enabled to start for his destination.

Suggur bin Sultan, the Shaikh of Shargah, at the instigation of Muktoom of Debaye, rebels against his father, and re fuses to acknowledge his authority. The latter, avoiding measures of violence, dissimulates, and agrees that his son, instead of being Governor of Shargah, and receiving a salary as before, should hold it as a per manent possession, and pay annually a stipulated sum.

Khaleefa bin Mahomed, with a portion of his tribe, passes over and settles at Zobara, where, after gradually drawing over the rest of his own tribe, completely separating him self fropi the other two, he establishes his independence. The Yalahimah, shortly after expelled from the port and town of Koweit by the Beni Subah, seek and obtain the protection of their kinsmen at Zobara. Quarrelling in a few years, they quit Zobara, and take up their residence at Raveish, a barren spot, a short distance eastward of Zobara. A desperate feud arises between the tribes, which terminates in the almost total destruction of the Yalahimah. On the attack of Eussora by the Persians, some of the mer chants of that place, and one of the Shaikhs of Koweit, with many of the principal people, retire to Zobara, and the power, wealth, and influence of the Beni Khaleefa rapidly increase. The fears and jealousy of Shaikh Nassir, the Persian C4o- vernor of Bushire and Bahrein, are thereby excited. His repeated attempts, however, to reduce Zobara, are ineffectual. On the death of Kureern Khan, and the warfare and confu sion which ensue, the Zobara Arabs make a descent upon Bahrein, compel Shaikh Nassir to retire to the fort, and, having plundered and destroyed the town, return to Zobara.

The Imaum of Muskat reduces the island of Bahrein, and sends all the head men, consisting of twenty-five families, to Muskat. The Uttoobees return to Zobara, and solicit the protection of the Wahabees, which is readily extended. Early this year the Uttoobees, with the assistance of the Wahabees, retake Bahrein. The Uttoobees deprecate the wrath of the British Government, urge exemption from the general chastisement of the pirates by the British forces, and solicit the countenance of the British Government in throwing off the Wahabee yoke, and quitting the mam ; also some trifling support to enable them to remain undisturbed at Bahrein. The British Government abstain from all interference. The Wahabee ruler assumes the government of Bahrein and Zobara, and appoints Abdoolla bin Oofcysan Vukeel over those places, and the Kateef and Guttur districts, to convert the Uttoobees to the Wahabee faith. The Uttoobees con- ^ tinue in administration, but pay tribute to the Vukeel.

Ramah bin Jaubir proceeds to, and lands with some guns at Kateef, which, in concert with Ibrahim Pasha, he batters, and commences to rebuild his old fort at Damaum, destroy ed by the Wahabees in 1816. Seventeen Indian women, captured by the pirates of Ras-ool- Khyma, are restored to liberty, by the Bahrein Chiefs releasing a number of Joasmee prisoners in exchange, at the instance of Captain Lock, of His Majesty's vessel Eden, on that ship visiting the island, accompanied by five other vessels of war, for the purpose of inquiring into the report that several Indian women had been brought from Ras-ool-Khyma, and publicly sold in the bazar at Bahrein, which proved unfounded. Ramah bin Jaubir is informed by the British authority that his vessels would not be permitted to leave Kateef to cruise against the people of Bahrein, unless acting with an authorised State, in regular warfare. He proceeds with his three vessels to Bushire, in order to co-operate in an expedition projected against Bahrein by the Prince of Shiraz. On his way down to Tauzee his large Buggalow is wrecked on the Berdistan Shoal, and he and his people escape with great difficulty with their lives. Ramah bin Jaubir refuses to become a member of the Ge neral Treaty, under the plea of his being the servant of the Persian Government. The Governor of Bushire engaging to be responsible for his future peaceable conduct, the excuse is admitted. After the capture of Ras-ool-Khyma by the British expedition, the Shaikh of Bahrein delivers up the vessels belonging to the piratical powers, which were in his harbour.

Of the tribute, 12,000 crowns are subsequently remitted. Ramah bin Jaubir nevertheless (with reference to the security of the Bushire Shaikh for his future good conduct) continues his aggressions upon the trade of Bahrein. The Uttoobee Chief complains to the British authority. A remonstrance is made to the Shiraz Government, who order him to be ca led to account, and his son and family to be detained as icstages. Ramah in the mean time had quitted Bushire and placed himself under the protection of the Imaum' returns to Bushire ^ November ; the Imaum disa vowing him, and declaring that no reliance was to be placed upon his word. Ramah bin Jaubir takes up his residence at Damaum, with a view, although old and blind, of prosecuting his inveterate leud against the Bahrein Chiefs. A peace is concluded between the Bahrein Chiefs and Shaikh Ramah bin Jaubir of Khor Hassan and Damaum, through the Resident's mediation, Ramah blockades Kateef, with the view of recovering the tribute formerly paid him by that place, and is successful.

Busheer, the son of Ramah, surrenders Damaum uncondi tionally. His life and liberty are granted him, and he proceeds to Muskat, where His Highness the Imaum pre sents him with a Buggalow, to enable him to gain a live lihood by trade. Through the influence of the Imaum, Busheer is permitted by the Wahabee Chief to build a fort at Dareen, a place on Tirhoot, an island opposite to Kateef, where he is joined by many of the Aboosemate tribe, bitter enemies of the Uttoobees. Suliman bin Ahmed, the colleague and elder brother of Shaikh Abdoolla, dies, and is succeeded in his property and political influence by his eldest son, Shaikh Khaleefa, who accordingly shares the net revenue of the island equally with his uncle, with whom the executive power and transaction of all public business still remain, the concurrence of the nephew being, however, considered necessary. A piracy is committed by Obed or Abdoolla bin Mohunnah, an inhabitant of Biddah, a Bahrein dependency, upon a Bushire boat, oft' Gonara. The Chief of Biddah, stabbing an individual of Bahrein, is placed in confinement by his feudal superior. The inha bitants thereon becoming refractory, are removed to Rowees and Fowarah, more immediately under his control, and their fort is destroyed by the same authority. Obed bin Mohunnah commits further piracies, but is himself, after a desperate resistance, taken prisoner on his landing at Zeerah, on the Persian Coast, to make inquiries regard ing the destination of a Buggalow then at anchor. Being convicted by the British authorities, he is handed over to the Shaikh of Bushire, whose subjects had suffered from his late piracies, but contrives to escape.

Full redress is, however, afforded for this act, by Shaikh Tahnoon. The Bahrein Chiefs signally defeat the Imaum's expedition against the island. 1829jA Bahrein fleet, under the command of Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed, in person, set out on a cruise to harass the Imaum's trade and coasts. His Highness sends out two frigates to meet it, which, after an ineffectual attempt to capture the Uttoobee Buggalow, the Syar, with which they fall in, return to Muskat without doing anything. The Bahrein fleet fail to capture an Aseeloo Buggalow, which fairly beats them off. They commit a piracy, in seizing a Morebat (neutral) vessel, evade two Muskat vessels of war which they meet, and return to Bahrein in safety. Redress to a certain extent was obtained for the piracy upon the Morebat vessel. A peace most favourable to the Uttoobees is concluded between them and the Imaum; the tribute they formerly paid to cease, and no interference whatever to take place in each other's concerns. Shaikh Abdoolla is called upon by the Wahabee Chief to pay the annual Zukat or tribute, besides 40,000 German crowns, as the alleged value of a number of horses left under his charge by the Wahabees many years previous. A demand is at the same time made for the surrender of the fort of Damaum to Busheer, the son of Rahmah bin Jaubir. The Shaikhs despatching a near relation to wait upon the Wahabee ruler at Riaz, an arrangement is made, that the supremacy of Ameer Toorkey bin Saood should be acknowledged at Bahrein, and the Zukat paid by the Uttoobees, in return for which he promises them his protection. The sincerity of the Wahabee ruler considered doubtful, from his establishing Busheer the son of Rahmah bin Jaubir at Careen, with whom they had necessarily a most inveterate feud. Busheer quarrels with the inhabitants of Kateef, destroys the fort he was building, and leaves with his dependents for Muskat.146 UTTOOBEES.

Pie instigates the Amayir Tribe, who, leaving the neighbourhood of Kateef, take up a position at Damaum, and establish a very close blockade of the former port. The British Agent is ill-treated and grossly insulted by the sons of Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed, whom the father does not exert himself to check. The appearance of a consi derable naval force in his port induces him to afford ample satisfaction. On the death of Toorkey, and in the absence of his son from Kateef, Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed succeeds by bribery in obtaining possession of the fort of Tirhoot, on the island of that name. Khaleefa bin Suliman, the nephew and colleague of Abdoolla bin Ahmed, dies, and is succeeded by his son Mahomed, to whom, however, the power and share in government possessed by his father are not immediately accorded. A party of the Amayir, under the command of one Mushrif, make an attempt to recover their possessions at Lahsa and Kateef, but are defeated by the Wahabee General, Omr bin Oofeysan, and compelled to take refuge under the guns of Tirhoot. The 'Wahabees fail in an attack upon Tirhoot. Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed resumes the strict blockade of Kateef and Ageer. The internal dissensions of Bahrein begin to wear a serious aspect. The Chiefs of Huailah, dependents of Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed, conspire against his authority, and enter into treasonable communications with the Imaum and the Wahabee Chief.

Esai bin Tarif desires permission to carry on hostilities against the trade and territories of his late master, which is refused, he having established himself in a friendly, or at least neutral port. Abdoolla bin Ahmed, alarmed at the threats of Persia, with whom the Imaum might co-opeiate, enters into terms with the Wahabees, he promising to pay the small annual tribute of 2,000 dollars, and ^he Wahabee Chief engaging to supply a contingent of troops to repel any invasion of Bahrein, and not to call foi the vessels of that island in the event of his purposing to attack Muskat. The disturbances and confusion increase on the island, in consequence of the tyrannical and oppressive conduct of the subordinate members of the Chief's family. The Huwajir and Amayir, taking advantage of the disturbed state of affairs in Nujd, in consequence of the struggle for power between Ameer Fysul and the pretender Khalid, commence the systematic plunder of all boats belonging to Kateef, and occasionally those from Bahrein. Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed punishes and brings them to order. Attempts are made to effect a reconciliation between the Chief of Bahrein and the Al Ali under Esai bin Tarif and Bin Salameh, but without effect. Hostilities are, however, postponed. On the fall of Ameer Fysul, his General, Omr bin Oofeysan, seeks and obtains asylum at Bahrein. Ameer Khalid demands his surrender, and that Damaum be given up to him. Tribute, and the surrender of Tirhoot, had been be fore demanded. The Bahrein Chief evades compliance, on the plea of con nection with, and submissioa to, the Persian Government. Korshid Pasha, the Egyptian Commander, avows to the British authority his intention of attacking and reducing Bahrein. The latter remonstrates and protests, and148 UTTOOBEES.

One Hajee Kasim, formerly supercargo of a trading vessel, is sent from Bushire as envoy from the Government ofShiraz to Bahrein, having an escort of ten Sirbaz, to reside on the island as Persian Agent, and be the medium of receiving and transmitting the annual tribute, which the Persian authorities vainly flattered themselves the Bahrein Chief _jyas disposed to pay for their countenance and protection. Hostilities are carried on between the A1 All at Aboothabee and the people of Bahrein, which entail much distress upon the merchants of the latter. The Assistant Resident is despatched, to bring about a reconciliation. As no terms would be entered into that had not the guarantee of the British Government, his mission is of no avail. The friendship between Esai bin Tarif and the Chief of Aboothabee is interrupted: the latter, who was under friendly communication with the Chief of Bahrein, requires him to leave his country, or settle there permanently as a peaceable subject. He is therefore obliged to relinquish the prosecution of further aggressions. Abdoolla bin Ahmed becomes tributary to the Egyptians, not withstanding his having promised to communicate with the Resident previous to placing himself under the protection of any other foreign power; being aware of the light in which Korshid Pasha's proceedings are viewed by the Bri tish Government, and the encouragement he had received from them to assert his rights and maintain his independence. He declares, however, that it has been expressly stipulated by him that no Agent of the Pasha should reside in Bah rein. The quarrels and dissensions among the members of the Uttoobee Chief's family grow more serious. He brings over a body of mercenary Bedouins from the main land. His own weak and vacillating conduct greatly disgusts the inhabitants. 3sai bin Tarif and his dependents remove from Aboothabee, on the termination of the pearl fishery, and settle on the island of Kenn, whence, he is forewarned, he will be pre cluded from carrying on aggressive warfare against any part of the Arabian Coast.UTTOOBEES. 149 Date.

An open collision between the two is with difficulty averted ; a hollow re conciliation takes place, Mahomed bin Khaleefa addresses a letter to the British authorities, offering his services, and soliciting assistance against his grand-uncle. He then proceeds to the Guttur Coast, and commences a system of annoyance and opposition to his superior. A piracy, committed in the previous year upon a Koweit boat, is traced to a follower of Shaikh Moobaruk, the son of Abdoolla bin Ahmed. The father is compelled to make reparation, by the payment of the value of the property plundered. An open rupture takes place between the parties,—the im mediate, but only ostensible, cause of contention being a girl sought in marriage by a dependent on either side. Mahomed bin Khaleefa is driven out of Munama (which town is given up to plunder by Abdoolla bin Ahmed to his victorious followers, and property belonging to British merchants shares the common fate), and flies to the main land. He proceeds to Lahsa and Eiaz, to solicit the aid of the Wahabee ruler, Abdoolla bin Soneyan. Abdoolla bin Ahmed, finding that the son and dependents of Humood bin Omeree, a person most obnoxious to him, had taken refuge in the British Agent's house, demands and obtains their surrender by means of threats of violence, when they are immediately cut to peices. The Agent's conduct throughout the affair is so irregular and condemn- able, that he is dismissed. The Uttoobee Shaikh is not without blame however. Abdoolla bin Ahmed proceeds to Khor Hassan, which he also gives up to plunder. Abdoolla bin Ahmed, not coming to terms with the Wahabee ruler, in consequence of his refusing to release his staunch adherent, Shafee, the head of the Huwajir Tribe, the latter favours the cause of Mahomed bin Khaleefa. Esai bin Tarif and Busheer bin Rahmah solicit and obtain permission from the British Resident to espouse the cause of Mahomed bin Khaleefa, and due intimation is given of this coalition to Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed.150 UTTOOBEES.

The Uttoobee Chief unwisely uses threatening language to the Wahabee ruler, to induce his observance of perfect neutrality. Mahomed bin Khaleefa prosecutes his successful operations on the main land. A piracy is committed upon a boat carrying British colours, in the harbour of Munama, by the immediate dependents of Abdoolla bin Ahmed. Mahomed bin Khaleefa lands with a force on the island, and shortly obtains possession of Munama, which offers no resistance. A Charrak boat is plundered in the harbour of Munama by some of the Huwajir and Suloota Tribes. The forces of the colleagues join from Kenn. They attack Muharag, defeat the troops of Abdoolla bin Ahmed, and compel him to take refuge in a small fort, close to the town. Abdoolla bin Ahmed surrenders at discretion, and is allowed to leave the island, with his personal property and followers. His sons are permitted to remain. Abdoolla bin Ahmed proceeds to Damaum, the only place now left acknowledging his authority, held by his eldest son, Moobaruk. Abdoolla bin Ahmed annoys the trade of Bahrein. The colleagues in consequence blockade Damaum. Both parties make overtures to the Wahabee ruler.

Two boats, despatched by the chief and people of Koweit, with supplies for Damaum, are captured at Khore Balbul, by some vessels detached from the blockading fleet. Although Jhe seizure is perfectly legal and just, Mahomed bin Khaleefa is subsequently induced to restore the boats, rather than incur the risk of a war with the powerful Shaikh of Koweit. The ex-chief lands, is received with honours, and takes up his residence on shore, his hopes of military aid from the Persian Government increased ; but after waiting three months without any signs of intention to join his cause being shown, determines upon taking his departure.

The preponderance of the Wahabees completely established in Oman. Mecca and Jeddah taken, without opposition, by the Turkish troops of Mahomed Ali Pasha, also Taif; thus the Wahabee power in that part of Arabia is annihilated. Saood dies on the 10th April, and is succeeded by his el lest son, Abdoolla. Ibrahim Pasha defeats the Wahabees at Manwiah, seven stages from Deriah ; and, following up his success, invests and reduces the city on the 10th September; destroys the fortifications, town, and plantations of date trees, and removes the inhabitants to Lahsa, the intended future seat of his government. Abdoolla bin Saood is taken prisoner, and sent off to Egypt. Kateef, the principal Wahabee seaport, next surrenders to the Turkish troops. 1824 Shaikh Toorkey, the son of Abdoolla bin Saood, collects a considerable force, and marches against the Turkish pro vinces to the westward, but is repulsed by Ahmed Pasha.

Toorkey establishes himself at Deriah, and governs with great prudence and moderation. 1831 The Imaum, in the hope of forwarding his views upon Bahrein, tenders submission to Fysul, and promises tribute. The Bahrein Chiefs, to counteract the Imaum's designs, are induced to adopt a similar course : thus the whole of the Arabian Coast from Ras-ool-Hud to Koweit, with the exception of Aboothabee, became tributary to the Wa habees. The Wahabee ruler intimates to the Governor of Bombay, through Shaikh Rashid bin Humeed of Ejman, his desire to be on the same friendly footing as that formerly existing between the British Government and his ancestor Saood. A friendly but general reply is returned, through the Resident in the Persian Gulf. 1831-32 Musharee, a relative of the Wahabee ruler, Toorkey bin Saood, rebels against his authority, and joins the Amayir and Beni Khalid Tribes, who had refused to acknowledge his supremacy. Hostilities continue between the Wahabees and Bahrein, the chief of which island blockades Kateef 7 Sohat, and Ajeer. 1833 The Wahabee ruler's influence established throughout the coast. He begins to levy tribute, but will not countenance lawless proceedings, and opposes the renewal of piracy, contrary to the expectation of the Joasmees, who had in this idea hailed the re-establishment of his authority.

Korshid's last act was to put to death Burgeish, the Chief of the Ali Humeed, as a sacrifice to the memory of Mahomed Effendi, his deputy. Intrigues are commenced, to deprive the pretender Khalid of his usurped authority. The Sublime Porte advance claims to authority over Nujd, and, having received presents from Khalid, appoint him their Wulee over that province. Khalid threatening, notwithstanding his utter want of power, to send a force into Oman, an officer is deputed to wait upon him in his camp at Lahsa, with written and verbal communications, indicative of the disapproval of the British Government to such a measure. He disavows any inten tion to do so. Abdoolla bin Sooneyan, the son of Mahomed, a younger brother of Saood, father of Khalid, retiring to Koweit, rises in rebellion against Khalid, seizes Zoomah, lyah, and Munfoohad, and threatens Riaz ; is defeated in a skirmish before that place, but contrives to get possession of it by 'treachery. Khalid flies to Lahsa, but that town favouring the cause of his opponent, and tendering its allegiance to him, he is obliged to take refuge with Moobaruk, the son of the Bahrein Chief, at Damaum, whence he proceeds to Koweit, and thence to Gusseem, where he supposes himself to have some staunch adherents.

At this very time Ameer Fysul opens a correspondence with the Resident by a letter expressive of a desire for the renewal of the amicable relations which formerly existed between his father, Toorkey, and the British Government, sentiments of course fittingly responded to, the objects of the British Govern ment in this quarter being at the same time explained.

Shaikh Tahnoon, a younger son, succeeds, with the assistance of the Imaum and the good will of the majority of the tribe, in expelling the usurper, who escapes with difficulty, and takes refuge at Bahrein. Tahnoon gradually assumes the superior authority and executive power, to which the father quietly submits. The alliance and connection of the Imaum with the Beniyas is the cause of weakening the close intimacy and friendship hitherto existing between that tribe and the Joasmees. The Beniyas Chief is admitted a member of the General Treaty. Sooedan bin Zaal, an individual of some rank, secedes from Aboothabee, and takes refuge at Biddah (a Bahrein dependency). Shaikh Tahnoon prosecutes active measures against him, which, being calculated to lead to the renewal of piracy, he abandons, at the desire of the British authority. Mahomed bin Shakboot collects a force, and attacks and plunders Aboothabee. Shaikh Tahnoon marches to the relief of the town, and defeats his brother with some loss. Mahomed takes refuge at Shargah, but that place being threatened by Tahnoon, quits the protection of its chief, and proceeds to Huailah (a Bahrein dependency).

The Joasmee Chief declares war, but does not commence hostile operations. The Debaye Governor, Khaleefa bin Dumeeta, seizes several Shargah boats, and their cargoes, but is compelled by the British authorities to make restoration. Shaikh Tahnoon joins the Imaum's expedition against Bahrein, but acts with great imprudence, if not treachery, and a signal failure is the result.

Two Bahrein Buggarahs and a Koweit Buteel are seized by the Beniyas ; the boats and property are recovered and restored, but the pirates escape. Hostilities again break out between the Joasmees and Beni yas. Shaikh Sultan blockades Aboothabee, and reduces it to great distress.

Shaikh Tahnoon gives refuge to three Joasmee pirates, inha bitants of Khan, and draws upon himself the responsibility of their acts, and the consequent obligation to afford redress, which he does by paying the sum of 1,500 German crowns. The Joasmee Chief is compelled to pay 2,000 German crowns for the part taken by the accomplices of the above. Shaikh Tahnoon bin Shakboot is murdered by the hands of his brothers Khaleefa and Sultan. The former of the two succeeds him in authority. Shaikh Khaleefa tenders allegiance and the annual payment of tribute to the Wahabee ruler, Toorkey bin Saood, who in return informs the Joasmee Chief that-the Beniyas are under his protection, and that he will permit of no aggres sions upon them. In consequence of the oppressive and arbitrary conduct of the usurper, a conspiracy is formed to put him to death. The plot is betrayed to Shaikh Khaleefa, who puts three of the conspirators to death, and severely punishes the others. The Boo Felasa and Rumshah tribes, to the num ber of about 800 persons, secede from the main Beniyas Tribe, and establish themselves at Debaye, a depend ency of Aboothabee. The Joasmee Chief takes advantage of the division in the Beniyas Tribe, espouses the quarrel of the Boo Felasa, and proceeds with the whole of his dis posable forces, increased by boats and men from Lingah, to the attack of Aboothabee, which he expects to find an easy conquest.

The Muskat authorities receive the explanation offered by the Beniyas, and remove the necessity for any interference on the part of the Resident. The blockade is raised, and a peace effected, through the me diation of the Shaikh of Lingah. 1833-34 Mutual aggressions are committed by the Beniyas and Joasmees ; their boats are in consequence withdrawn from the pearl banks. Shaikh Khaleefa, at the earnest solicita tion of his tribe, sends his father Shakboot to conclude a peace ; one of the conditions is that the Debaye people shall be henceforth under the authority of the Joasmees. 1834 Some of the Soodan of Aboothabee attack a Buteel belonging to Muttrah, and plunder her of property to the amount of 1,000 dollars. The appearance of a squadron before Aboothabee induces Shaikh Khaleefa to comply with the requisitions of the British authorities for reparation. 1835 The Beniyas break out into open and avowed piracy. They commit the most daring depredations, attended with the greatest cruelty. All the available vessels of war of the squadron are immediately despatched in quest of their boats.

A naval force visits the ports of Biddah, Wukra and Adeed, whose chiefs bind themselves to do their utmost to seize the boats of the pirates, and are held responsible for their future acts. The latter is further required to afford security in money and property for the lulnlment of the engagement (which is subsequently restored) Three of Jassim bin Jubbur'sgang are seized by the Chief of Aboothabee, and are detained in confine^ ment four months, during which period one dies.

He further, in direct opposition to all his pledges, and in pursuance of the policy of that functionary, proceeds in person to the attack of the Naeem tribes of Brymee (who had been encouraged by the British Government to maintain their independence against the invaders), but is repulsed. He is held responsible therefore by the British authority for the property plundered by them. A misunderstanding arises between Aboothabee and Debaye in consequence of some aggressions at sea, but is amicably adjusted through the interference of the British authority. A piracy is committed by some of the Monasir and Howamil tribes under the authority of Khaleefa bin Shakboot, upon a Bahrein boat. That chief, upon the circumstance being brought to his notice, adopts the most vigorous measures to punish the delinquents. It was proposed to Khaleefa bin Shakboot to become a party to a truce forbidding all aggressions and hostilities by land. He declines. Shaikh Khaleefa visits Debaye, and a peace is concluded between him and the chief of that place, an arrangement offensive to the Joasmees. Esai bin Tarif invites Shaikh Khaleefa to join the cause of Mahomed bin Khaleefa and his colleagues against Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed of Bahrein. He declines doing so without the permission of the British Government. Shakboot, the brother of Khaleefa, makes a foray into the territories of the Joasmees and their allies, and inflicts much injury.

Muskat is the chief seaport of one of the two grand principalities into which the Province of Oman is divided, of which Rastag is the capital. It is inhabited by the Beni Yemen, or Beni Hinavi Tribe of Arabs, of which the Imaum of Muskat is the head. The line of coast from Cape Ras-ool-Gate to Cape Musseldom belongs to the Imaura. The tribes dependent on Muskat are enumerated in the 2nd paragraph of my sketch of the Province of Oman.* 2. The ascendancy of the Arabs of Muskat in the Gulf of Persia may be dated from the year 1694-95, when they a. d . 1694-95. . became so powerful as to excite an alarm that they would obtain the command of the Persian Gulf. The navigation of the Gulf became more difficult in the following year, from the increase of their power, of which our Agent at Gombroon predicted that 'they would prove as great a plague in India as the Algerines were in Europe.' 3. Being superior to the Persians at sea, they carried on a success ful warfare against the trade of that kingdom, insomuch that the King of Persia made an offer to our Agents that if the Company would co-operate in the reduc tion of Muskat, he would grant them the same privileges at that port as we enjoyed at Gombroon. No decided answer was returned, as we had neither ships nor troops to spare. 4. By the observance of this policy, the English trade was uninter ruptedly prosecuted, while the conduct of the Muskat Arabs towards the Portuguese clearly proved that they would hold any aid given by Europeans to the Persians as an act of hostility against themselves ; for as soon as they found that the Portuguese had assisted the former, they divided the Muskat fleet into two squadrons, one sailed along the Coast of Africa, and burnt the Portuguese settlement at Mombassa, and the other, stretching across the Indian Seas, destroyed one of their factories. * Vide page 42 of this Selection.x MUSKAT. 169 5. The Muskat Arabs in 1705-06 were still infesting the coast, a. d. 1703-06. taking every ship they could overpower. 6. In the following year their attention was turned to a more regular system of naval warfare, for they obtained per- a. d. 1706-07. mission from the King of Pegu to build ships at the ports in his country, and spread their fleets over the seas which surround the peninsula of India. Some of their ships carried from thirty to fifty guns. They made descents on several towns on the Malabar Coast, both to obtain plunder and a fixed station, from which they might annoy the trade, or resist the ]\Iogul oi iVIuratha fleets, or e\en the more powerful vessels of the European nations. 7. These depredations led to the Murathas* equipping a fleet of sixty vessels, not only to repel the Arabs, but to act also as pirates against all defenceless vessels. v 8. The captures by the Arabs and Murathas became so numerous that the King of Persia contemplated the deputation of ambassadors to Bombay and Batavia, to solicit naval aid against the pirates. It having been considered politic to prevent the adoption of either of those measures, as the first would only have exposed the then weak state of Bombay, and the second, if complied with, might have obtained a preference to the Dutch in the Persian market, our Agent in 1 ersia promised, as soon as the war in Europe should cease, that a naval force should be sent to destroy the pirates. 9. Without detailing the various depredations committed by the Arab cruisers, it may be stated that the imbecile a. d. 1707-08 to 1/1/. gtattj of the kingdom 0 f Persia in the commence ment of the last century was favourable to the growing power of Muskat, the ruler of which was at this period master of all the islands in the Gulf; and it is probable that it maintained its ascendancy in that quarter during the establishment of the Afghans in Persia, or until the year 1730. 10. Bahrein was taken from the Arabs in the reign of Nadir Shah, by Mahomed Takee Khan, the Governor of Fars, and there can be no doubt of the influence of Persia having been completely restored by that prince in the Gulf, as even the Muskat Government was at this period obliged to pay tribute to Persia. 11. The Persians were driven out of Oman by Ahmed bin Saeed, the Governor of Sohar, for which act he was elected Imaum. He led an army by land towards Ras-ool-Khyma, and would have reduced the * Seer principality to his allegiance had he not been abandoned by some * The piracies of the Muskat Arabs gave rise to another formidable pirate, Angria of Colaba, in the vicinity of Bombay. 90.170 MUSKAT. of his allies, on whom he chiefly depended for his supplies, and forced to make a precipitate retreat. 12. We hear nothing of the Arabs of Muskat from 1736 to 1769, at itoc i -ro the close which latter year a dispute occurred A. D. l/do to l/oy. IT,' 1 between the Persians and Muskatees, in conse quence of Kureem Khan demanding from the latter a Persian ship which had been a long time in the hands of the Muskat Arabs, and the arrears of tribute they formerly paid to Nadir Shah. With these demands the Muskat Government refused to comply, alleging that the ship was lawfully purchased from Shaikh Abdoolla of Ormus ; whilst with respect to the claim to tribute, they replied that Nadir Shah was too powerful a tyrant to contend with,—it was therefore paid to him, not as a matter of right but of policy : that Nadir Shah, however, and Kureem Khan, were characters widely different,—the one they dreaded, the other they rather despised ; the one was the conqueror of all Persia, the other was merely a Vukeel of two or three of its provinces;—if, there fore, Kureem Khan thought proper to persist in his demand, they threatened to answer it by force. 13. At the commencement of the following year the Imaum's fleet, q consisting of several ships and gallivats, made its appearance in the Gulf, with five thousand troops on board. It was intended to proceed to Bushire, to demand satisfaction from the Persians for some losses the Muskatees had suffered from them. The fleet having, however, dispersed, and not re-assembling at the appointed rendezvous, returned to Muskat. 14. Hostilities continued to prevail between the Persians and the Imaum of Muskat. Shaikh Nassir of Bushire, who had been appointed to command the Persian gallivats, was authorised by Kureem Khan either to prosecute the war or to make peace with the Imaum, who showed a disposition to accommodate matters, by surrendering some Persian property, which he had detained at Muskat on his rupture with the Khan. The efforts to negotiate a peace failed, as the Imaum would not listen to the conditions proposed by the Shaikh on the part of Kureem Khan, which were considered disgraceful. The Imaum professed a wish to be on amicable terms with the Persians, but disdained to purchase their friendship by the payment of an annual tribute on any consideration whatever. The Muskat Government was at this time in alliance with the Shaikh of Julfar, or Ras-ool-Khyma. 15. On the attack of Bussora by the Persians, the Imaum of Muskat detached a fleet to assist in its protection. It anchored at the entrance of the river early in the month of August, having dispersed the Persian gallivats, underMUSK AT. 171 Shaikh Nassir, and became masters of the river. Bussora was in consequence abundantly supplied. Ihe town, Al D - 1776 ' however, having been ultimately compelled to surrender to the Persians, the Muskat fleet returned to port. 16. Hostilities next ensued between the Imaum of Muskat and Shaikh Rashid of Ras-ool-Khyma, who had be- a. d. 1//8-/9. come very powerful, by land. He had taken some Bussora craft, on the plea of their having Muskat property on board. 17. The Jul far fleet continued to cruise in the Gulf, rousing every petty Shaikh to fit out armed boats, which carried on a predatory system of warfare. The death of Kureem Khan, which led to the evacuation of Bussora by the Persians, and to its re-occupation by the Turks, having in a great degree dissolved the bonds which kept the various powers under control and subjection, a. d. 1780-81. the q u ]f was involved in the greatest trouble, one power carrying on hostilities against another. 18. It was during this period of a general contest for independence, arising out of the decline of the Persian power a. d. 1781-82. . n the q u ]jr t | ia t the Uttoobee Arabs con quered Bahrein from the Persians. In the repeated attempts made by the Shaikh of Bushire, in conjunction with the Chief of 'Ras-ool- Khyma, to recover Bahrein, the Imaum of Muskat preserved a strict neutrality. 19. During the hostilities that were carried on in the subsequent years between the Turkish Government of Bus- a. d. 1783 to 1797. gora&gt; and the Montifik Arabs and their allies, the Muskat Government also maintained a strict neutrality ; nor did it interfere in the affairs of the Gulf until the Imaumship of Syud Sultan, or Sultan bin Ahmed, in the year 1797. 20. Syud Sultan was the second son of Syud Ahmed, the riist Tmaum, but being of a restless and enterprising genius, had unjustly deprived his elder brother, Saud Syud bin Ahmed, the rightful heir and his immediate sovereign, of power and authority, by confining him to the city of Bombac, and its immediate vicinity, the usual residence of the Imaums. Having obtained possession of Muskat, he made it the seat of his Government, and thence prosecuted his ambitious plans against his neighbours. 21. The turbulence of his disposition urged him into serious disputes with the Arabs in the Gulf, which involved him in hostilities with many of them, who had united against him. 'i his rupture lendered the navigation of the Gulf extremely insecure. The Viper cruiser was attacked in the month of October 1797, whilst at anchor in the roads of Bushire, bv some Dows, commanded by Shaikh Saleh, the nephewMUSK AT. of Shaikh Suggur, the Chief of the Beni Jansannee Arabs, who were at war with the Imaum, and supposed to be in the interest of his elder brother, the deposed Prince of Oman. 22. The King of Persia, Baba Khan, who had recently succeeded to the throne, reverting to the grounds of offence that subsisted against the Imaum of Muskat, issued orders to the Shaikh of Bushire, direct ing the immediate equipment of a considerable land force, to be embarked on a fleet at Bussora, which was to co-operate in an attack on Muskat. 23. Our policy being at this period actively directed to counteract the intrigues of Buonaparte, in Persia and in the Gulf, for the purpose of prosecuting his views on India, suspicions were entertained that the Government of Muskat was more disposed to an alliance with the French than with the British, a commercial intercourse which the Imaum carried on with the Mauritius bringing him in constant com munication with the former power. 24. It being on these grounds deemed expedient to form a connec tion with Muskat, Mehedi AH Khan, who was appointed Resident at Bushire, was ordered to touch at the former port on his way to his station, and, in pursuance of instructions for that purpose, concluded an agreement with the Imaum, dated the 12th October 1798, the object of which was to exclude the French and Dutch from having any factory within his territories, or at Gombroon, to prevent the ships of the former nation entering the cove, and to dismiss the French who at the time were in his service. 25. At the close of the year, we find the Imaum of Muskat threatening Bussora on account of some ancient claims on the Pasha of Bagdad, and in order to enable h.im the more effectually to prosecute his hostile intentions, the Imaum negotiated a peace with his formid able enemy the Joasmee Chief. 26. The Pasha remonstrated on this occasion against the conduct of the Imaum, observing that whilst the Beni a. d . 1/98. ' . . , . . L ttoobee Arabs were assisting him in an attack they meditated on Kateef and the Wahabee power, the former should seize, at a period, moreover, when the French were invading Egypt, that opportunity to carry on hostilities against their allies and dependents the Uttoobees (between whom and the people of Muskat there existed some differences), a conduct on the part of the Imaum which coun teracted the expedition, and deprived it of the assistance which would otherwise be received from the marine force of those Arabs. The Pasha expressed an anxious wish that two of the Company's cruisers might be ordered immediately to Bussora, for the purpose of acting in concert with his fleet.MUSKAT. 173 27. As a compliance with this application would have reduced the Government to an awkward dilemma with the Imaum of Muskat, whose good will we had so lately engaged, as manifested in the treaty recently concluded, we offered to contribute by our interference towards the satisfactory accommodation of such differences as might exist between the Pasha and the Oman Chief. 28. The Pasha of Bagdad having requested the intercession of the Resident at Bussora with the Imaum and the a. d. 1/98. Shaikh of Ras-ool-Khyma to desist from their hos tile intentions, Mr. Manesty complied with the request : the result led to a negotiation between the Mussaleem and the commandant of the Muskat annual coffee fleet, then lying at Bushire, and the usual friendly intercourse between the Pasha and the Imaum was restored. 29. The Imaum in the course of the following year, however, proceeded, in compliance with the application A - D - 1799, of the Beglerbeg of Fars, with four ships, and sixty Buggalows and armed gallivats, to attack the Uttoobees, and reduce Bahrein. The Uttoobees had only three ships, which were on a trading voyage in the Indian seas, which were all taken by the Imaum on their return. SO. The Uttoobees wrote on this occasion to Shaikh Nassir of Bushire, stating that the island of Bahrein was originally under the Turkish Government, the Kings of the Sofi race having for some time brought it under control, but that it was seventy years since they had been in possession of it ; that they were now desirous of becoming subject to the King of Persia, to whom they would pay tribute. Shaikh Nassir availed himself of this invitation, and privately proceeded to Bahrein, and received the tribute for 1798. 81. The Imaum, on hearing of the intelligence, expressed his dis pleasure at the Shaikh's conduct. He seized the opportunity of Shaikh Nassir's absence from Bushire to spread a report in Karrack that he had fled from the island, and Shaikh Ghanum, Shaikh Nassir's cousin, had been appointed Governor, recommending them to send all the Bushire people back from Karrack, as Shaikh Ghanum would consider them as rebels and confine their women, and to entrust the charge of the fort to him. The Karrackees, in consequence, gave up the fort to the Imaum, who immediately wrote to the Beglerbeg of Pars, that as there were very few people at Karrack, he had taken possession of it, to prevent the Uttoobees occupying it, and offered to give five years' revenue in advance if the island were given up to him. The result of this applica tion is not known, but Syud Sultan, having amicably adjusted matters with the Uttoobees and the Shaikh of Bushire, returned to Muskat, an event which restored tranquillity to the Gulf.174 MUSKAT. 32. The immunities granted to the Imaum of Muskat by the agreement of 1798 were suspended by the Government until that prince offered satisfactory explanations on several suspicious circumstances in his conduct which were supposed to favour the intrigues of the French, These were afforded to the satisfaction of General Malcolm, who had touched at Muskat on his embassy to Persia, and concluded a further* agreement with the [maum, in confirmation of that entered into in 1798. 33. The Wahabees threatening to invade Oman, Syud Sultan proceeded towards Julfar, where he joined Shaikh Suggur, with the view of opposing the threatened attack, which was, however, averted by the peace concluded between the Wahabees and the Imaum. 34. In the following year Syud Sultan accomplished the favourite object of reducing the island of Bahrein ; on the conquest of which he demanded of the Shaikh of Grane that he would personally pay him homage, which must have been complied with, as the Imaum shortly after dismissed all his troops. He retained possession of Bahrein for a few months only, the Uttoobees having re-taken it in 1801. 35. The attention of the Imaum was next directed to the formation of an alliance with the Joasmee Arabs, in which he failed. The Wahabee troops were at this time in the vicinity of Oman, and had compelled the wild Arabs to join them. The Chiefs of Zaheera and Sohar, and Mahomed bin Nassir, three Shaikhs of Oman, had been rendered independent of Muskat. The Imaum received tenders of assistance from the Turkish and Persian Governments if he would attack the Wahabees. This combi- nalion became necessary, to check the Wahabees, who had reduced to nominal submission the whole coast from Bussora river to Debaye,f and who, if allowed to strengthen themselves in their acquisitions, would, it was feared, commence and prosecute those depredations by sea which they had carried on on shore. A conviction of this danger had united the mercantile povers in the Gulf against the Wahabees. 36. Unable, however, to check their progress, the Imaum in 1803 acceded to a truce of three years with the Wahabees, who had succeeded in converting or rendering tributary to their power the Arabs who inhabited the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf. This truce left the Wahabee Chief at liberty to prosecute his ambitious designs on the western frontier of Arabia. * Dated the 18th January 1800. t The boundary between the Muskat and Joasrnee territorie«.17^ MUSKAT. 37 Returning from his viclorious career on the western frontier of Arabia, the Wahabee, notwithstanding the truce so ^' had nreoared for the invasion of Oman by land and sea. A parly had already entered the province, and advanced within two days journey of BurkMthe summer re .idcnee of the I.aum). The Resident at Muskat observed on this occasion that 'if the Wahabces reduced Ora , a l Arabia must submit to their yoke, and the whole coast would become a nest of pirates, who would extend their depredations to ndia, of which there was some danger, as the Iinaum had disgusted al! his chiefs, and stood almost alone.' , f . 38 The conquest of Oman was arrested by the^ murder of the Wahabee Shaikh Abdool Azeez, early in the month of November; and in the same month of the following year Syud Sultan was „...cd in an engagement with the Uttoobees, joined by the Joasmees, off the B 39. The administration of affairs on the death of Syud Sultan devolved on his two sons. Being young and a. d . 1804. unprotected, their pretensions to the succession were disputed by their uncle Syud Gheif, of Sohar, who aimed at the usurpation of the government. .... , p 40. The death of Syud Sultan, who had maintained some degiee of control over the petty powers in alliance with a. d . 1805. Muskat, left these latter without any check ; the disturbances in consequence increased. The Joasmee pirates, who were principally the authors of them, captured two vessels (the Shannon and Trimmer), belonging to Mr. Manesty, proceeding to Bussora with public despatches, and treated the commanders with great severity and cruelty; and a fleet of forty sail surrounded the Morning -Ion cruiser, and fired into her, but a few discharges from her great guns obliged them to sheer off. . , . _ 41. The Government of Bombay determined, in consequence, to assist the Imaum of Muskat in chastising the Joasmees, by aftording the co -operation of our cruisers in the Gulf. ^ 42 The authorities in the Gulf were accordingly enjoined to use every effort to check the pirates, but to take especial care to avoid offence to any other tribes who might not be essentially engaged in piratical depredations. &gt; . 43. The character of the Government of Muskat is so material a consideration connected with the security of the Gulf, that a review of the events that resulted from the death of Syud Sultan, having relation to the succession, is not unimportant. 44. After the death of Syud Sultan, his two sons retained possession of Muskat and the adjacent territory, but being opposed by theiruncle.MUSKAT. Syud Gheif, of Sohar, who succeeded in seizing the forts of Kabara ami heher they were reduced to the necessity of entrusting the management 0 a a.rs to Syud Beder, their cousin, who, being assisted by the Wahabees, succeeded in repulsing Syud Gheif. 45. Syud Beder was a man of ability and enterprise and ^ v connection with or dependence on the Wahabees is also materiall' 8 connected with these inquiries, it may not be improper briefly to advert to the cncumstances which gave rise to that connection 46. In 1803, Syud Beder, availing himself of the opportunity of the ate Imaums absence on a pilgrimage to Mecca, made an attempt to seize e ort o 1 uskat; hut failing in that project, he fled to Zobara and sough the protection of the Wahabce Chief, who ordered the Arab Tribes bordering on Oman to assist Syud Beder in his ambitious views on that country. views 47 With the aid thus afforded, Syud Beder twice invaded Oman bu being repulsed, fled to Deriah. At the period of the death of Syud Sultan Bcdcr was at Zobara, where a force was collecting to assist him. On hearing of that event, he set ont, accompanied only by a few 01 owers, for Ras-ooUKhyma, where he was in danger of being cut off-' but effecting his escape in a flshing-boat, he reached Oman just at the ime that his uncle Syud Ghetf was besieging Muttra, and refusing to negotiate with the late Imaum's children upon any terms short of the surrender of all the forts into his possession. 48. In this conjuncture, the sons of the late Imaum resolved to wiTthc w a hT raent of f' 1 ' 8 to s - vnd Bedcr ' who ' 'y his influen « w.th the Wahabees caused a diversion to be made by the troops of chief towards Sohar, which obliged Syud Gheif to retire, for the purpose of defending his own territory; an army of 4,000 Wahabees having subsequently approached by sea, and a maritime force of fifteen vessels, for the purpose of establishing Beder in the government, and cMldreT 1 '® SyUd Gheif had USUrped fr0m ,he late Im ^ ra ' s 49. The Wahabee Chief, however, apprehending that the successful accomplishment of these measures would render Syud Beder indepen- dent of him, withdrew his aid, and at the same time required the rival chiefs to await his decision. The policy of Saood seemed to be to Mu m | i 1 If' ,e h t'h COmpetit0rs es tablishing an ascendancy at Mu»kat, but, by allowing them to exhaust their strength in hostile e orts against each other, to ensure the more effectually their falling an easy prey, in due season, to himself. S 50.

This 0 ^ f consequence of Captain Seton having accompanied Syud Bcder on . ^xDedition with two of the Company's cruisers. ' 52 Affairs in the Gulf, however, were stilt far from assuming settled appearance, as Syud Gheif, aided by Moolla Hussain, and other partisans, had recommenced hostilities with Syud Bedcr, and compelled the latter to call in a Wahabee force. , u +1^ 53. Operations were also at this period actiirely prosecuted by Company against the Joasmee pirates, m con- a. d . 1806. junction with the Muskat Government, in conse&gt; quenccofthe capture of the Shannon and Trimmer. The combined forces nroceeded to the island of Kishm, where they blockaded a fleet of Joas- mees who, being reduced to distress, Captain Seton agreed to grant them a truce until the pleasure of the Government should be known; explain- i„&lt;r on this occasion, as his reason for refraining from hostilities, the im possibility of prosecuting them with vigour or effect, without offending either tlm Persians or the Wahabees This truce led to the conclusion of the treaty with the Joasmees dated the 6th Febiuary 1&amp;06. 54 The tranquillity of the Gulf was further promoted by he reduction, by Syud Beder, of the fort of Bidbid, which commands the entrance of Oman, and of Keriat, leaving Muttra and its fort alone to Svud Gheif, who engaged to surrender the possessions of the late Tmaum, except Kabara, and left it optional with Syud Beder to assign to him the revenue of Muttra. . . , . , 55. The Joasmees remained true to the engagement concluded with Captain Seton in every point that regarded the a. d . 1807. Company, but co -operated with Syud Beder in an attack on Syud Gheif, who refused to become a party to the peace, as he could not in honour do, until he had revenged the blood of Syud Sultan, his brother. n ^ i 56. Nor would the Joasmees and the Government of Muskat appear * Vide page 75 of this Selection. 0178 MUSK AT. to have strictly observed the terms of that engagement. MooIIa Hussain, the Chief of Kishm, was seized by surprise in 1806 and carried to Muskat. In the following year a force was despatched' from the latter to receive possession of the former place, and of Ormus also from Moolla Hussain's family, in ransom for his person. Shaikh Sultan, the Joasmee, had, however, thrown a force into Kishm, which refused to receive Moolla Hussain, or to restore the island. o7. In the mean time, Shaikh Sultan, taking advantage of the absence of the fleet from Muskat, proceeded with twenty-two Dows two Buggalows, and a number of Botellas,' towards Seer, near Ras-ool- Hud, and landing, attempted to surprise the fort, but they were repulsed, and driven to their boats with some loss. An expedition against the Coast of Mukran by the pirates was also defeated about this time. Syud Saeed, the second son of Syud Sultan, who had succeeded Syud Beder in the Government of Muskat, was prevented by his uncle Syud Gheif from following up those advantages. 58. The Government of Muskat was represented by Captain Seton, a. d . 1808. in a ^ etterdatec * the 16th of January 1808, as very • unstable and unpopular. Syud Saeed, young and inexperienced, had lost the influence his father had acquired, and, from the little consideration he manifested towards the Shaikhs who visited Muskat, was left almost friendless. Of Oman he possessed only the sea coast, the upper country having become tributary to the Wahabees, and it was only by a degrading submission that the Imaum protected the low country from their inroads. Mukran, with the exception of Gauden, had also become independent of the Imaum ; and as most of the Arab families had removed from Muskat, it was ex pected that troubles would ensue. 59. In the month of May, however, the Imaum, assisted by Syud Glieif, reduced the fort of Khore Fukaun. Mahomed bin Muttur, the chief of a tribe inhabiting a part of the country between Muskat and Khore Fukaun, called Tajarab, also co-operated with the Imaum, according to previous agreement, on this expedition. That chief, however, seizing a iavourable opportunity, treacherously deserted, and surprised the Muskat troops. The Imaum narrowly escaped to his ships, whilst Syud Gheif lost his life in the affray, and was succeeded by his son in the Govern ment of Sohar. 60. The power of the Wahabees now reached its height. The Joas- mees had, by a late order ol the Wahabees, been declared independent of their lawful Shaikh, Sultun bin Suggur of Ras-ool-Khyma, and the whole rendered tributary to the Shaikh of that sect. It was even apprehend ed that the Government of Muskat would be obliged to join the general piracy which now pervaded the Gulf, unless the British Government180 MUSKAT. been dismembered from Sohar, so as to reduce the defence of the country to one point, the passage across the isthmus. 66. The Wahabee Chief being absent on a pilgrimage to Mecca the Imaum, in 1^09, prepared an expedition on a large scale, which was to be joined by four thousand men from Bushire ; their avowed object being to destroy Jillama, of Ivhor Hassan. A powerful party of Joasmees, adverse to the Wahabee influence, was to assist the arma- ment, the true destination of which was supposed to be against Hussain bin Ali, the 'VVahabee vicegerent in Oman, under whose control piracy was prosecuted. 67. The Uttoobee Arabs also joined in this expedition. 68. It sailed under the personal command of Syud Saeed, on the 15th of April. The fleet having, however, dispersed in different direc tions, the situation of the Imaum became very critical : he had left his possessions liable to be attacked, without the power of defending them. He was importuned by the Wahabees to proceed to Bussora and Graner the Joasmees were to co-operate in this expedition, but the Uttoobees had declined. Unable to resist, the Imaum declared that his fleet was leady. In some degree to assist the Imaum in this predicament, the CoTnwoJlis frigate was stationed at the Quoins, which would prevent the enemy attacking the Imaum, and enable him at the same time to adopt the line of conduct he wished, by delaying to go to Grane till the Uttoobees were ready to join him. 69. General Malcolm concurred in the opinion expressed by Captain Seton on this occasion, that nothing but the early interference of the British Government could prevent the port of Muskat being altogether destroyed as a port of commerce, and its inhabitants and shipping being added to the pirates;—considerations which led the Supreme Government to equip an expedition for the protection of Muskat against the Wahabees, in order that a well disposed ally might not be converted into a dangerous enemy, and for the suppression of the Joasmee pirates. 70. Sultan bin Suggur, the hereditary Chief of the Joasmees, had also been rendered a cypher in his own country by the appointment of the AVahabee officers to the charge of districts, and had, in consequence, abandoned his territories, and sought the Imaum's protection. 71. Phe Uttoobees at Zobara had also suffered so much from the tyranny of the ^ ahabees that they had recently endeavoured to conciliate the Government of Muskat, frequented the port, and paid duties as other States; whilst the Imaum, with a judicious policy, Showed a preference to them, in remitting such duties as might fall heavily on their trade. No obstacle, therefore, opposed the conclusion of a-solid agreement between the Uttoobees and the Government ofMUSKAT. 181 Muskat, but the want of a guarantee, who could secure the due performance of its stipulations. 72. An expedition against the pirates having been determined on, as well for the suppression of piracy as for the relief of Muskat, it proceeded to the Gulf. The armament, after destroying the boats at Has-ool- Khyma, Lingah, and Luft, repaired to Muskat. The Imaum, who in the first instance considered the attack of the pirates with so small a force a desperate attempt, afforded the fullest assurances of the satisfaction he had derived from its success, and expressed considerable gratitude for the benefit derived to his own cause, particularly by the capture and surrender of .Luft to him; and proposed to accompany the expedition with a large force to attack Shinas and Khore Fukaun. 73. They reached Shinas on the 31st of December. A summons to a d 1809 10 surrender being unattended to, it was imme diately bombarded. The fort, however, being too distantly situated to be reduced by those means, the troops were landed, those of His Highness taking up their ground on the left of the British. A battery having been raised and completed on the evening of the 2nd of January, a breach was made on the morning of the 3rd. It having been determined to storm the place, in which a body of four hundred of the Imaum's troops was to co-operate, these, considering the movements made by our different detachments in taking up their stations as moving to the attack, or misunderstanding their orders, got before the British, and entered the breach first, but the moment we got up they readily yielded to us the remaining labour and honour of the day. 74. After a most determined, sanguinary^ and heroic defence on the part of the Wahabee officer, the fort surrendered, and was given up to the Imaum's troops, but the fort was so much demolished that His Highness did not think it prudent to keep possession of it. 75. The Imaum having expressed some hesitation on the policy of attacking Khore Fukaun, from an apprehension of experiencing a simi lar obstinate resistance as was made at Shinas, which would render it untenable, the object was abandoned, as it had no British interest con nected with it, there being no pirate vessels belonging to that port; nor was it deemed necessary to attack Khor Hassan, as the Uttoobees of that place had never molested the British trade ; the armament ac cordingly returned to Bombay. 76. In the month of April in the following year, information was a d received of the Wahabee troops being in the vicinity of Muskat, attacking and plundering the possessions of the Imaum. They had maintained an obstinate conflict with His Highness' troops at Saood Moval, about forty miles from182 MUSKAT. Burka, and afterwards proceeded to the attack of Ismailee, in the defence of which it was acknowledged the Imaum had lost two hundred of his troops. 77. The Imaum represented on this occasion to the Bombay Government that his co-operation with his friends and allies, the English, in the late expedition, had involved him in a perpetual and implacable war with the Wahabees, with whom he was before at peace and trusted that the British Government would not remain neutral daring the struggle which he was making to defend his possessions and capital from the invasion of an ancient and inveterate enemy, whose resentment had thus been strongly re-excited against him. 78. The Supreme Government, considering the declaration of the Imaum, that he had refrained from taking advantage of the peaceable overtures of the Wahabees in consequence of his connection with the British, to proceed from a wish to promul-ate a belief that we were united with him in his contest with the Wahabees, and that he might expect to derive advantage from the reputation of having the support of so powerful an ally, and thus lead to a rupture with the Wahabees, against whom various considerations rendered it inexpedient, and indeed impracticable, to afford the Imaum any assistance, it was deemed of some consequence that His Highness should be undeceived on tiiis subject, or rather that he should have no room to propagate the belief of our being a party in the war with the Wahabees. /9. It was therefore intimated to the Imaum that it was unnecessary to regulate his reply to any overtures on the part of the Wahabees by reference to his connection with the British Government, which had always considered itself to be at peace with that tribe, the late co-operation with the Imaum not having been in prosecution of Avar against the W ahabees generally, but merely for the extirpation of the pirates, whose augmented power and audacity had endangered the security of his own dominions, as well as interrupted the com- meice and naAigation of the Gulf. That the British Government, there fore, was no further interested in the contest between him and the W ahabees than as it was solicitous for the welfare and prosperity of the Imaum. L nder the influence of that solicitude, and a just sense of the benefits and blessings of a state of peace, it was recommended to the Imaum to grant the terms of pacification solicited by the Wahabees, if consistent with the honour and security of the State of Muskat. 80. Previously to the receipt of that communication, the Imaum's brother, Syud Willah bin Humeed, had sailed on an expedition against Bahrein and Zobara. Zobara was taken, plundered, and the town burnt and levelled to the ground. His troops and battering train were landed at Bahrein; the brother of the Governor, and Duryah BegeeMUSKAT. 183 of the Wahabee fleet, with fifteen of their principal officers, were made prisoners. From Bahrein the armament proceeded to Khor Hassan. 81. The influence of the Wahabees had been introduced into Bah rein, which, however, continued in the possession of the Uttoobees, who were required to pay a tribute to Abdoolla Saood. The Imaum made this attack in consequence of the successes of Ibrahim Pasha having obliged the Wahabee Chief to withdraw his garrison from Zobara, for the purpose of concentrating his forces. 82. An Agent arrived at Bombay from the Imaum in the month of June, soliciting such an auxiliary force as we might be able to allot, for the protection of Oman, during the ensuing season, against the attempts of hostile associations of armed Arabs situated in the vicinity of his capital, and more particularly to overawe the Wahabees, by the pre sence of a British force of about two thousand men, from bis projected measures against the Government of Muskat, a compliance with which was of course evaded. 83. Mr. Bruce having paid a visit to the Presidency in .1813, was directed, on his return to Bushire, to call at a. d . 1813. „ Muskat, for the purpose of making arrangements for the duties of that station, which was placed under his control. On his arrival at that port, he found the Imaum preparing an expedition against Ras-ool-Khyma, for the purpose of reinstating Shaikh Sultan, the Joasmee Chief, in his government. 84. The Imaum requested that Mr. Bruce would accompany him to witness the treaty which he should enter into with Sultan bin Suggur, and for the purpose, also, of negotiating a treaty with that chief on the part of the British Government, which would have more effect in keep ing him to the performance of his engagements than anything else, as Sultan bin Suggur was now aware of our determination not to allow the slightest insult to pass unnoticed. 85. As the renewal of the treaty entered into by the Joasmee Chief with Captain Seton in 1806 # was deemed essential for restraining the piratical acts of his subjects, Mr. Bruce was instructed to adopt the necessary measures accordingly; and to contract similar engagements with the other chieftains in the Gulf, promulgating the determination of the Government to attack and destroy every vessel that might be met with, to whatever State she might belong, engaged in piracies, and that we should not relax in the prosecution of that object until we should obtain the most perfect security for the vessels and trade of our subjects visiting the Gulf. 86. Mr. Bruce accompanied the Imaum on that expedition: they proceeded over to the Arabian Coast to Boothabane, the principal port of * Vide page 75 of this Selection.184 musk at. the Bcniyas, situated to the westward of Ras-ool-Khyma. The Imaum had a conference with Shaikh Shakboot, the head of the tribej who agreed to co -operate in the attack on Ras-ool-Khyma, with two thousand men. At this place the Imaum received a despatch from Sultan bin Suggur, stating that he had been joined by several Arab Chiefs on the Persian side, and that he had force enough to join in the expedition. The Shaikh of Bahrein also promised to co-operate with fifteen or twenty sail, and two thousand men, and proposed to join the Imaum at the port of the Hiza Arabs. 87. The Imaum acknowledged on this occasion that it was owing to our presence that the Arab Chiefs had so readily come in to his views, and had made so favourable an impression to his interests that he was almost certain of carrying his point against Ras-ool-Khyma. His High ness said that Sultan bin Suggur had expressed his gratitude very warmly to the British Government, and would consider himself as having been restored to his hereditary situation by its influence. Sultan bin Suggur having joined the Imaum at Debaye with a hundred and fifty sail of vessels, there was every prospect of accomplishing their object. 88. The expedition failed from an ineffectual co-operation on the part of the Beniyas Tribe, who do not appear to have voluntarily offered to aid in the undertaking. Another expedition was undertaken by the Imaum in the following year, for a similar purpose. His High ness apprising Mr. Bruce that the Shaikh of the Beniyas and Hera Tribes, and Sultan bin Suggur, were entreating him to join them, pro mising most faithfully to support him with all their strength, and to act contrary to what they did in the preceding year. Mr. Bruce stated on this occasion that a severe skirmish had taken place between the Beniyas and Ras-ool-Khyma Arabs, in which the former were victorious, having killed near three hundred Joasmees, and carried off about four hundred head of camels. Shaikh Sultan had, moreover, obtained possession of Shargah with his adherents. The famous Wahabee General, Mootluk, who defended Shinas with so much bravery, when attacked by Colonel Smith, and whose support of the Joasmees had caused the failure of the Imaum's armament, had died, and there was every prospect of success. 89. The Imaum having proceeded on the second expedition against Ras -ool-Khyma, the chief inhabitants sent a A - D - 1814, mediator to him, and solicited peace, which the Imaum granted, and returned to the island of Ormus. The terms were, that the ports on the line of coast from Con goon to the southward on the Persian side, and those on the coast from Bahrein to Cape Ras-ool -Gate on the Arabian side, should be at peace witn each other. Bushire, Bu-MUSK At. 185 ^ora, and Grahe were not included in this pacification, to which Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur and Shaikh Shakboot of the Beniyas were very adverse, and rendered those chiefs dissatisfied with the Imaum. His Highness was, however, obliged to conclude the treaty, owing to the backward ness of Shaikh Shakboot and the other tribes to act offensively, notwith standing that they had invited and urged the Imaum to undertake that expedition. Those tribes were to march and attack Ras-ool-Khyma by land, whilst the Imaum did so by sea ; but finding them averse to it, and suspecting that they had made a private treaty with the Joasmees, the Imaum negotiated a hasty engagement with them also, and with drew his forces. The double dealings of these tribes, observed Mr. Bruce on this occasion, is hardly to be accounted for ; but he suspected it had been from fear that the Imaum would not succeed, that these tribes formed a secret article with the Joasmees. 90. It was reported on this occasion that the Imaum had com pelled Shaikh Suggur to accede to the engagement he had made with the Joasmees, and to agree to a stipulation that Ras -ool-Khyma should remain in His Highness' possession, and that Shaikh Sultan should be established at Shargah. 91. The reverses experienced by the Wahabees having led to over tures on their part to the Persian and British Governments, a Wahabee Agent was also deputed to Muskat. The negotiation broke off because Ras-ool-Khyma, which was in subjection to the Wahabee, was an obstacle, and in consequence of his proposing as a secret article that His Highness should furnish that chieftain with vessels to enable him to embark a force for the purpose of making a sudden descent on some part of the Malabar Coast, which the Imaum rejected, as inconsistent with his engagements with the British Government. 92. The engagement concluded by Mr. Bruce with the Joasmees, a. d. 18L5 an&lt; ^ t ' le ^umstances attending its subsequent violation by them, are fully detailed in a subse quent sketch of that tribe. Their depredations recommenced. The Imaum wrote to the Governor, reporting that another Vukeel had arrived at Muskat from the Wahabee Chief; that the Vukeel was constantly seeking means to set up some new pretension, and made several demands, which were not only inadmissible, but foreign from a state of peace ; that he had not, in consequence, entered into any agreement with the Wahabees, and that being disappointed in their views, they had recommenced hostilities with him; that the Imaum had no other alternative than to employ his utmost exertions and endeavours against Ras-ool-Khyma, for whilst it was allowed to remain on its piesent footing they would never be inclined to peace, and request ing that we should afford him the co-operation of some of our vessels 24186 MUSK AT. 93. The Joasmce fleet, consisting of a ship, and twenty-five Bug- galows and Buteels, being out on a cruise at the entrance of the Gulf, the Imaum, with his fleet, composed of the Caroline frigate and two other ships, with a number of smaller vessels, fell in with the Joasmees off Cape Keriat. A smart action ensued, in which the Joasmees attempted to board the Imaum's ship, and had actually got possession of the forecastle, when they were dislodged by the guns from the poop being fired pointed forward, loaded with grape. The Imaum's other vessels having fallen astern, he was obliged to bear up and run in to Muskat. His Highness, who commanded in person on board the Caroline, was slightly wounded by a musket ball. In two days, after having refitted, the Tmaum again put to sea after the Joasmees, fell in with them off Sohar, from which he chased them into Ras-ool-Khyma, and returned to Muskat. 94. His Highness renewed operations against the Joasmees in the commencement of the following year, but was unable to effect anything against them, not withstanding that he blockaded the port of Ras-ool-Khyma for nearly four months ; nor, in the opinion of Mr. Bruce, would the Imaum be able to do anything without our support, for which he was extremely anxious, and would, to obtain it, be glad to cede to us any of the ports or islands in the Gulf that are subject to him. 95. On the 15th of June 1816, Mr. Bruce reported that the Imaum had proceeded with a large force to reduce the Beni Uttoobee and Joasmee Arabs to his allegiance, having been joined by the Aseeloo and Congoon Arabs, and, with three boats from Bushire, despatched to his assistance by orders from Shiraz, the Imaum proceeded to Bahrein, and landed their troops on the island of Arad, which is separated from Bahrein by a narrow channel for boats, and commenced the attack with some pros pect of success, but ultimately experienced a signal defeat, and with great loss. Two of the Imaum's principal Sirdars were killed on this occasion. Mr. Bruce, who had quitted Bahrein a few days before the Imaum attacked it, wrote to His Highness to dissuade him from it, as he knew that many of the Imaum's troops were secretly in the interests of the Uttoobees, and offering his mediation to settle his differences with that tribe. No reply was returned to that offer. 96. The Imaum, after this defeat, proceeded to Congoon with the whole of his fleet, for the purpose of taking on board a reinforcement of troops, consisting of one thousand musketeers, and four hundred irregular cavalry, which the Prince of Shiraz had engaged to furnish, on condition of the Imaum's defraying their expenses, and paying an annual Peshkush should the troops once embark, and the expedition be abandoned; butMUSKAT. 187 if they landed in Bahrein, and reduced it, the Imaum was to pay 10,000 Tomans annually to the Government of Shiraz. 97. The expedition against Bahrein was soon abandoned, the Imaum having discovered that the Government of Persia was actuated by motives of treachery, and contemplated his seizure, and that of some of his chiefs, and carrying them off to Shiraz. 98. In the month of May in the following year, Rahmah bin Jaubir proceeded to Muskat, with the view of prevail- a. d. 1817. : , . , , 1 mg on the Imaum to make another attack on Bahrein, but His Highness was too much occupied in his own terri tories to undertake it, having met with a repulse from a Joasmee force that marched against Khore Fukaun, which surrendered to those freebooters. 99. By late accounts (1818) the Imaum was meditating another expedition against Ras-ool-Khyma. CONTINUATION OF THE FOREGOING SKETCH, TO THE YEAR 1831, BY LIEUTENANT HENNELL, ASSISTANT RESIDENT, PERSIAN GULF. Mr. 'Warden's Sketches of the Arabian Tribes in the Gulf of Persia conclude the history of the Government of Muskat, in 1817, with the account of the Imaum's defeat in his attack on Bahrein, and the abandonment by His Highness of a second attempt upon that island (in which he was to have been joined by a body of Persian horse and foot), in consequence of his discovering that the Fars Government was actuated by motives of treachery. His Highness, however, appears to have been much hurt at the duplicity and double dealing of the Court of Shiraz, and certainly not without reason, for while the Persian authorities detained the Muskat vessels in the Gulf during many months, at a heavy expense, for the purpose of embarking the troops, which they pretended were collecting to co-operate against Bahrein, they sent over messengers to the chief of that island, and concluded a separate agreement, on receiving presents to a considerable amount. In consequence of this conduct. His Highness despatched a messenger in April 1818 to Bushire, for the purpose of proceeding to the Shah's presence, to lay before His Majesty all the documents relating to his negotiations with the Government of Fars, and to intimate that he should in future look to other sources than Persia for support in carry ing into effect his views upon the Uttoobee territory. This person, onMUSK AT. arriving at Bushire, did not proceed himself to the interior, but sent on his letters and papers to Court by a courier. On His Highness' return to Muskat from his unfortunate expedition, he despatched two ships to cruise off Cape Ras-ool-Gate, in order to protect the vessels belonging to his subjects (returning from India) against the anticipated attacks of the Uttoobees, who were of course inclined to make reprisals for the hostile demonstrations so lately shown towards them. Soon afterwards the inhabitants of Ras-ool-Khyma, alarmed at the approach of the Turkish troops under Ibrahim Pasha, after the fall of Deriah, made proposals to His Highness to settle their differences, and to enter into an offensive and defensive alliance, which proposition was rejected. About the end of 1819, an expedition was despatched from Bombay, under the command of Major General Sir A- I) ' 1S19 ' William Grant Keir, for the purpose of punishing the insults offered to the British flag, as well as putting an end to the piracies daily committed upon English and other vessels, by the maritime inhabitants of the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf. Ge neral Keir touched at Muskat on his voyage ; and, in the course of an interview held with the Imaum, communicated the instructions he had received to His Highness, who willingly entered into all the views of the British Government, and promised to furnish 4,000 troops by land, and to add three vessels of war to the naval part of the force. The expedition subsequently sailed for its destination, and by the destruction or capture of all the vessels, and the principal stronghold of the piratical chieftains, inspired a wholesome dread ol the British power, and restored peace and safety to the Persian Gulf. Encouraged by the complete success of these operations against the piratical chieftains, His Highness determined to avail himself of the strong impression produced in the minds of the maritime inhabitants of the Persian Gulf, by his having co-operated with the British forces, to make another attempt to carry his designs against the island of Bahrein into execution. He however endeavoured to learn previously from Sir W. Keir the light in which this intention might be viewed by the authorities in India, but without success, as the General would give no opinion on the subject. On leaving the expedition. His Highness returned to Muskat in 1820, ostensibly for the purpose of commencing his preparations, but shortly after informed Sir W. Keir that, conceiving- it was the wish of the British Government that he should not come to an open rupture with the Uttoobees, he had consented to make peace with them, on receiving an annual tribute of 30,000 German crowns but that he required the guarantee of the Government for the regular payment of this sum. General Keir, in reply to His Highness' communication, stated that he had no authority to give any suchX MUSK AT. 189 pledge, but that His Highness' desire should be referred to India. The guarantee of course was never given. Some irregular proceedings on the part of the Arabs* of Al Ushkara having been brought to the notice of the Government, instructions were issued to the Political Agent at Kishm to proceed against them, in the event of the action reported appearing to be clearly piratical ; at the same time, he was instructed to take every care to ascertain that what was represented as piracy, might not be lawful warfare. In conformity wilh these instructions, a cruiser was despatched to Al Ushkara, to convey a lelter addressed to the Chiefs of the Beni Boo Ali Tribe from the British authority. On arriving off the place above alluded to, a man of some consequence (who had been previously procured from Muskat), was sent with the communication, but, on his landing, the boat was attacked by the Arabs, and the messenger cut in pieces. This proceed ing appeared to the Political Agent sufficient to justify immediate hostilities, and accordingly, by his orders, six companies of sepoys, with eight pieces of artillery, were embarked from Kishm on board several vessels of war, which sailed forthwith for Muskat, where they arrived on the 11th October. A plan of operations was immediately concerted with the Imaum, and it was arranged, that as the landingat Al Ushkara was nearly impracticable, and could not be supported by such of His H ighness' troops as were to co-operate, the detachment should proceed to Soor by sea, while His Highness marched with his forces by land to the same place. The Beni Boo Ali Tribe no sooner received infor mation of the projected expedition than they set fire to Al Ushkara, and, after burning fourteen of their boats, retreated into the interior, to Bulad Beni Boo Ali. The detachment being joined by one thousand men from the Imaum, together with nine hundred head of draft cattle, marched from Soor on the 1st November, carrying with them two six- pounders, two howitzers, and two iron eighteen-pounders. On the 8th November the combined forces arrived within three miles of Bulad Beni Boo Ali, the residence of the hostile tribe, and a demand was forthwith made for the surrender of their fortifications and arms, together with the persons who had murdered the messenger at Al Ushkara. The sum mons was sent by His Highness the Imaum, but conveyed an intimation from the Political Agent that the war on the part of the British was brought on by the Beni Boo Ali having committed piracies on the seas, and that this cause was quite distinct from the reasons which had induced His Highness to proceed against them. In * A small place on the sea coast near Ras-ool-IIud, belonging to the Beni Boo Ali Arabs, a fierce and turbulent tribe residing in Jaalan, a province belonging to the Imaum, whose authority they had lately thrown off (June 1820).i AO U MUSKAT. answer to th.. summons, the Beni Boo Ali stated they were readv , comply with the eonditions proposed, except the one stfpulatingt/,,, 0 surrender of their arras. This modification, however was not n i ! .o an d the heavy gU ns and stores being .eft in the enTrench d .he combined forces, consisting of four guns, 380 sepoys, and 2 OOn men belong.ng to the Iraaum, raoved the next raormng oward!'!!! enemy s town, which was situated with its back to a deep date l ve tound which it was necessary to defile in order to get at the assailabl' front, which looked towards the sandy plain, and was protected by 1st ban n 9 ar ' VIn S Wlthin si g ht 'f'he town, the light infantry of the 1st battalion 2nd regiment, which had headed the column in extended el ' 0i f ned Jts fire ' and be g an 'o fall back, and soon after the enemy ppeared in motion on the top of some elevated ground, with the apparent design of turning the right flank. The officer commanding mmediately directed the troops to form column of sections to the riehf so as to present a new front, parallel to the enemy's attack, aud then to charge bayonets. Some hesitation on the part of the sepoys is asserted a\e been displayed at this momentin obeying the last order anH the only course left, they were directed to fiL^hLh ^ immediately after, on the enemy being within twenty yards of the me, they are alleged by the commanding officer to have turned about and thrown themselyes on the Imaum's troops in the rear.

M.'s 65th regiment, and 300 of the 1st battalion 7th regiment N. I., under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Warren), took possession of the whole fortified position the same evening. The sepoys on this occasion suffered severely, but the enemy lost upwards of 500 killed and wounded, while nearly all the remainder, together with their two chiefs, were taken prisoners. After blowing up the works and defences, the forces returned to Soor, and re-embarked for India, taking a number of prisoners with them. On this occasion His Highness the Imaum cut down the date groves, and turned the watercourses of Bulad Beni Boo Ali. A discussion having arisen in 1822 between His Highness and the Uttoobees relative to the non-payment of their A. D. 1822. . r ^ tribute, a relerence was made to the British Government on the subject, and Mr. Bruce was ordered to mediate an adjustment between the two powers ; but some delay taking place in carrying this arrangement into effect, it was resolved not to interfere further than by the Government addressing a letter to both parties, advising them strongly to settle their differences amicably, without going to war. It was likewise intimated to His Highness, that he must restrain Rahmah bin Jaubir and Shaikh Tahnoon from committing unjust depredations upon the property of others, and that unless he did so, they would be punished as disturbers of the general peace. In 1823, the Court of Directors sent out instructions to the Bom- A D 1823 bay Government, to use its influence with His Highness the Imaum to procure the restoration of the remnants of the Beni Boo Ali Tribe to their native seats. This was done, and, after some hesitation and correspondence. His Highness permitted their return to their old residence. The next year Mahomed bin Ali having represented to the Resident in the Persian Gulf the distressed situation to which his tribe was reduced by the total destruc tion of their houses and watercourses, the sum of 2,500 German crowns was advanced by the Government to enable them to make the necessary repairs. About the end of 1824, a correspondence took place between His A D 1824 Highness the Imaum and the Bombay Govern ment, respecting the conduct of Captain Owen, of the royal navy, in having taken possession of Mombassa, on the African Coast, in the name of the King of Great Britain. On a strong remonstrance being preferred by His Highness against this proceeding, upon the grounds of his claim to the sovereignty of that island. Captain Owen's proceedings were disavowed by the Indian authorities, and a reference, transmitting a memorial from the Imaum, was made to His1 00 ^ MUSK AT. Majesty's Ministers, who subsequently replied that it wa S determine to take no further steps in the affair. 'ernuned A tribute which His Highness the Tmt^im in - i i * r „ ne.s me Imaum laid claim to from Bussora a. d . 1825. having been withheld for several years, and no Highness inforuted Z HU intention to b.ocUade the river, in order to e^ arrears due. The Resident having offered his mediation to endeavour to the''? v rr' 6 ' ' WaS aCCe P ted ' and a communication was made to the Political Agent at Bagdad, in March IfW , , exert his influenee with the Pasha to settle the^fflT^ll t ,!: Bombay Government, however, direeted that our interference should be confined solely to producing a disposition to an amir-nhl.

Capta n Taylor hav.ng tutimated the failure of his attempt to induce the PaZ o Bagdad to make concessions, the fmaum was'informed t^! h^ wa: at 1 beny to carry on whatever measures he thought proper Hil Highness, however, in consequence of the threats of Mahomed A1 Pasha abandoned the idea of an expedition for that time. In May 1825, the British Resident having received orders to tal e easmes to remove the jealous feelings which had been excited in the mind 0 the Imaum, owing to our interference in behalf ofthe Beni Boo li J1 Ibe, proceeded in person to Muskat, ostensibly with the view of em eavounng to bring the discussion between His Highness and Shaikh .r h T ssar ' ,oaMa * ,he ~ of b --—&gt; - nation The presence at Muskat of Mahomed bin Ali the Chief of tl Ben, Boo A i Tribe, afforded Colonel Staunus an opptmn ty of n Ld^ r 11 ' r d ia the vari ' us Beni Boo Ui Tribe ''f PreSen ' anCl fU,Ure COnditi ™ of .

The people of Makullah having complained to the British Govern ment that some aggressions had been committed upon them by the Imaum's subjects residing in Soor, the Resident was directed to inquire into the affair, which was subsequently settled by his Highness compelling the aggressors to pay 7,000 dollars to the Shaikh of Makullah, as a compensation for his losses. In December 1825 the British authority in the Persian Gulf had an interview with the Imaum, on which occasion His Highness again complained of fresh aggressions having been committed on his African territories by English Agents. His Highness likewise intimated, on the same occasion, that he considered his connection with the British Government in the light of an offensive and defensive alliance ; and, further, recommended that a stop should be put to all maritime war fare in the Persian Gulf, as the most effectual means of suppressing piracy. In the reply to the despatches communicating the above particulars, the Government directed the Imaum should be informed, that with reference to Mombassa, His Majesty's Ministers had determined to drop all further proceedings in respect to that place. On the subject of the relations subsisting between His Highness and the British Government, it was shown, in a detail of considerable length, that although one of the articles of the Quolnamah or agreement, concluded by Mehedi Ali Khan, stated that the friends and enemies of the one party stood in a similar relation to the other ; yet that this was merely intended to convey a general notion of strict friendship, and that it was so com pletely contradicted by the other stipulations, and the numerous communications bearing upon this point subsequently made to His Highness, as well as by the transactions which had taken place between the two States since its conclusion, as to make it perfectly evident that the same understanding of neutrality on both sides in each other's wars had been always avowed and acted upon. The plan of insisting on the maintenance of maritime peace was considered by the Government as impracticable, even if desirable, on account of the absence of any means to compel the inhabitants of the Persian Coast to accede to it, as well as its unequal operation, in increasing the power of the military, and diminishing that of the naval, tribes on the Arabian side of the Gulf. Shortly afterwards, the Resident reported that he had had an interview with His Highness, and succeeded in impressing on his mind the true nature of the amicable relations now subsisting between the two Governments, and that His Highness had fully acquiesced in the pro priety of the views submitted to him. 25■i' ■■■ 194 MUSKAT. ■i - The Imaum having long suspected that Shaikh Abdool Russool a. d . 1826. Khan ' the Governor of Bushire, had, by his in- trigues and misrepresentations, traduced him at the Court of Shiraz, and even attempted to supplant him in his proposed connexion with the sister of the Prince Royal of Fars, His Highness availed himself of the absence of his rival, on a pilgrimage to Mecca to declare war, in May 1826, against his territories. On the 27th July 1826, His Highness' fleet appeared off Bushire, and excited considerable alarm in the minds of the inhabitants, which, however, was allayed on its being ascertained that it had come to Bushire solely for the purpose of landing the cargo of Shaikh Abdool Russool's ship the Noosrut Shah, which had been previously captured by the Imaum on her way from Bengal. No aggressions whatever were committed against the town or trade, and after some little discussion about the payment of duties, the cargo was landed, and the fleet proceeded to Bussora, in order to enforce some private and public claims advanced by His Highness against that place. On a report of these circumstances being made to India, the Government directed that the Imaum should be allowed to pursue his own course of policy towards Bushire and Bussora, in the event of our interference not procuring him ample satis faction, and further directed that the strictest neutrality should be maintained by the British authorities on these occasions. In May 1826, Commodore Christian, the officer commanding the naval force on the Cape of Good Hope station, addressed a letter to the Bombay Government, requesting, for certain reasons, that they would interfere to prevent the Imaum from attacking Mombassa, and, if possible, induce His Highness to acknowledge the independence of that island. In a reply, dated September 1826, to the Commodore's communication, the Honorable the Governor in Council declined com pliance with His Excellency's request; stating at the same time his reasons, and recommending that, in the event of the Imaum being prevented from prosecuting his views upon the place in question by the Home Authorities, a proper compensation should be afforded. The Commodore was likewise informed that a request would be made to His Highness to defer all operations until the decision of His Majesty's Government should be made known. In a subsequent communication, Commodore Christian intimated the removal of the British establish ment from Mombassa, and stated that he did not consider the inhabit ants of that island to be entitled to British protection. The British authority in the Gulf of Persia was accordingly instructed to intercede with the Imaum in behalf of the population of the island in question. In the month of September 1826 His Highness proceeded to cruiseMUSK AT. 195 with his fleet off Kishm, for the purpose of intercepting the Shaikh of Bushire on his return from Mecca. This plan was attended with entire success, as he fell in with the Shaikh on the 13th September, and, after a short action, captured that personage, together with his ' two vessels. On the 25th October the British Resident had an interview with His Highness, on which occasion he brought to His Highness' notice the contumacy of Shaikh Tahnoon, in persisting in his refusal to destroy the fort of Derah, # and remove the Soodan Tribe, agreeably to the stipula tions of the treaty entered into by him with the Joasmee Shaikh. In consequence of this representation, His Highness promised to send his vessels of war to blockade the place by sea, while Sultan bin Suggur, with the troops drawn from Shargah and Ras-ool-Khyma, attacked it by land. The Imaum's claims upon the authorities of Bussora having been brought to an amicable arrangement, the blockade of that place was raised in November 1826, and His Highness' fleet returned to Muskat. In the month of May 1827 Shaikh Abdool Russool was restored to liberty by the Imaum, and, on his giving a bond for 80,000 German crowns, his two vessels were likewise given up to him. About this time His Highness proceeded to Derah, and had that place destroyed, agreeably to his promise to the Resident; but in order to heal the wounded pride of Shaikh Tahnoon, he supplied that chief with warlike stores of every description, and called upon the people of Debayef to submit themselves to the authority of the Beniyas Chief. There can be little doubt that His Highness' intrigues on this occasion fomented the causes of disagreement between Shaikh Sultan and his rival Tahnoon. In July 1827, one of the daughters of the Prince of Shiraz (a sister of Reza Kolee Mirza) was betrothed to the Imaum, and shortly after, proceeding to Bunder Abbas, was met there by his Highness, and conveyed to Muskat. His Highness having requested the opinion of the British Resident as to the propriety or otherwise of his acceding to a request made by the Chaub Shaikhs for assistance against Bussora, a reply, couched in general terms, but pacific language, was returned, in consequence of which His Highness declined interfering in their affairs. * A small fort, between Shargah and Debaye, erected by tbe Soodan Tribe, under Soliman bin Nasser, a dependent of Shaikh Tahnoon. t A small independent town, near Shargah, under the Heera family.196 MUSKAT. In June 1828 a report became very prevalent in the Persian Gulfj that thelmaum had determined to make another attempt to reduce the island of Bahrein to his dominion, and that he was collecting troops and vessels for that purpose. In order to throw the Uttoobees off their guard, His Highness, with more prudence than good faith, sent up a messenger to Bahrein with presents for the Shaikhs, accompanied by letters couched in the most friendly terms, assuring them that the rumours current regarding his hostile views were entirely without foundation. The duplicity of this state ment, however, speedily became apparent, and in the month of August a representation was made on the subject by the Shaikh of Bahrein to the British authority in the Gulf, who declined interfering in any way, beyond making an attempt to induce Shaikh Tahnoon of Aboothabee to remain neutral in the contest, in order to avoid the chance of the Joasmees being brought in as allies of Bahrein, and to prevent the pro bable evil consequences resulting from the blood feud which was likely to arise between the Uttoobees and Beniyas. The effort was, however, unsuccessful, as the Chief of Aboothabee subsequently joined His Highness with a considerable body of men. His Highness himself did not formally declare war until August 1828, when he addressed a letter to Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed, intimating his intention of attacking Bahrein one month from the date of the communication. In the beginning of September, His Highness, attended by a large fleet of ships, and Native vessels, sailed from Muskat, and arrived at Kishm on the 17th of that month. After remaining a few days he again set sail, for Aboothabee, for the purpose of being joined by Shaikh Tahnoon and his contingent. About November 1828, His Highness arrived off Bahrein with his fleet, and, having landed a party of men, look possession of the fort outside without any opposition, and had fixed a day for the whole of his forces proceeding against the town of Munamah, when he was surprised to hear that Shaikh Tahnoon, with his troops, had landed without his orders. Hastily collecting a few of his immediate followers and Nubian slaves. His Highness hurried on shore, to endeavour to avert the consequence of this imprudent proceeding. He was, how ever, too late : a small body of the Uttoobee horse had been previously concealed in some date groves on the flank, which, issuing out while the Imaum's troops were eagerly pressing forward to engage, charged in the rear, and at the same time the Uttoobee infantry making a general ad vance, the assailants were thrown into great confusion, and at last fled, completely routed, to their boats, leaving a very considerable number of lulled, wounded, and prisoners behind them. His Highness appears toMUSKAT. 197 have shown his usual personal courage, and was carried off with great difficulty by his faithful Nubians, after being slightly wounded, [n the confusion attending this disastrous affair, a brig and Buggalow belonging to His Highness got on shore, and, having been abandoned, were taken possession of by the enemy, but the former was subse quently burnt by the Imaum's people during the night. Discouraged by this defeat, and the ravages committed among his followers by the cholera morbus. His Highness affected to consider that the hand of Providence was against him, and, after an incilectual attempt to con clude a peace with the Shaikh of Bahrein, he sailed back with his fleet to Muskat on the 20th November. Various reasons were assigned for His Highness having abandoned an enterprise, the preparation of which had cost him so much labour and treasure ; but it was generally thought, that he either suspected some of his immediate adherents of treachery, or that the unexpected intelligence of a dangerous and spreading rebellion having broken out in his possessions on the African Coast had induced him to forego any further attempt upon Bahrein, and hasten back to Muskat. The town of Bushire having been taken in the latter part of 1828 by Prince Timor Mirza, that personage sent down an a. d . 1829. application to his brother-in-law, the Imaum, for the assistance of one or two of his vessels, and at the same time strongly recommended him to make a capture of Shaikh Abdool Russool's ship, the Harriet. In pursuance of this request, His Highness sent up the Muzuffa frigate, which, having fallen in with the Harriet off Congoon, escorted her into Bushire harbour, without, however, attempting to molest her in any way. On her arrival in January 1829, the commander, Syud bin Khalfan, landed, and finding His Royal Highness the Prince of Shiraz present, and Shaikh Abdool Russool apparently in high favour, he remained a few days as the Wuzeer's guest, and sailed away for Muskat, without attempting any act of hostility. Soon after this, the Imaum having received information that the Uttoobees had despatched a fleet under the command of Abdool Rahman, to cruise against the vessels of his subjects and allies. His Highness directed two of his ships of war to proceed in quest of them. On their way up they fell in with a large Bahrein Buggalow, called the Syar, on her way from India to Bahrein, and immediately attacked her. The Uttoobee vessel, however, defended herself with great gallantry, and, after a distant and ineffectual cannonade, the Imaum's frigates attempted to bear down, for the purpose of boarding, but, on approach ing, perceived that a quantity of combustible materials had been prepared by the Uttoobees to throw on board them should they come198 MUSKAT. near. In consequence, they changed their intentions, and continued the action with their guns, till, night coming on, the Buggalow altered her course, and arrived soon after at Bahrein, very little injured herself but with a considerable portion of the cargo damaged. In May 1829 the British Government directed their Agent in the Persian Gulf to endeavour to compose the differences existing between His Highness and the Shaikh of Bahrein. The offer of mediation was accepted by His Highness with great alacrity, as the state of his affairs in Zanzibar imperiously called upon him to proceed in person to the African Coast, for the purpose of crushing, if possible, the rebellion of the people of Mombassa. After some correspondence. His Highness sent up one of his confidential men for the purpose of arranging terms, but the Bahrein Chief, notwithstanding the earnest advice and recom mendation of the political authority, refused to listen to any conditions of peace, however favourable to himself, that had not the guarantee of the British Government to them. This, of course, was absolutely refused, although His Highness earnestly begged that the pledge might be given, binding the Bahrein Chief firm in his determination, the British Resident, after a correspondence of several months, declared his mediation at an end. Whether the Uttoobee Shaikh conceived that our desire for peace was so strong that, sooner than fail in the mediation, we should have acceded to his wishes regarding the guarantee, or whether he really regarded our friendly interference with an eye of suspicion, is doubtful, but certain it is, that we had no sooner declined taking any further steps in the affair than peace was concluded betwixt the belligerents (through the agency of a dependent of the Imaum, who had proceeded to Bahrein), on terms perhaps even more favourable to the interests of His Highness than those offered to the Uttoobees through us ; thus adding another to the many instances in which the offer of our mediation tended rather to protract than expedite a return to amicable relations. A small vessel, belonging to Mr. Shipton, having been attacked and plundered on her way from the Red Sea by some dependents of the Imaum, His Highness took immediate steps to obtain satisfaction for this outrage, and remitted in the first instance about 6,000 dollars, which he had recovered from the pirates, and subsequently a further sum of 1,100 crowns, to the Bombay Government. About this time a merchant ship, called the Oscar, having been run ashore off the Coast of Jaalan, on her way from Bombay to Bushire, she was boarded by the Arabs (principally of the Beni Boo Ali and Beni Boo Hussain Tribes), and plundered of all her cargo, amounting in value to eight lakhs of rupees, the greater portion of which, had it not been for the violence of the Natives, might perhaps have been saved.MUSKAT. 199 In consequence of this proceeding, a strong application was made to the Bombay Government by the underwriters in India, to take imme diate measures to procure the restoration of the plundered property. Accordingly the Resident, having received the instructions of his Go vernment, proceeded to Muskat on board the schooner Fly, accompanied by Commodore Collinson in the Ternate. These two vessels, added to the three cruisers which had previously assembled there, formed a disposable force of five sloops and brigs of war. After an interview with His Highness, an arrangement was made, by which a portion of the Kashmere shawls taken from the wreck, and purchased by people in Muskat, was recovered, on paying salvage. On the 19th Octo ber the Resident, accompanied by His Highness the Imaum, with two frigates, and the rest of the squadron, sailed for Soor and lyah, but after a minute investigation no trace of any of the plundered cargo could be found. From these places the Resi dent, accompanied by Commodore Collinson, proceeded to Khore Gerany, where he had a long interview with Mahomed bin Ali, the Chief of the Beni Boo Ali Tribe ; and after fully impressing him with the superior advantages he and his tribe would derive from pre serving the cargo of any British vessel that might be wrecked, instead of plundering it, he succeeded in inducing him to give up a few shawls, and 1,200 dollars, which he solemnly swore was all that it was in his power to restore at this late period. Finding that this chief and tribe, in consequence of their residing in the interior, were wholly untangible by naval means alone, the British authority conceived it useless to attempt force, and therefore endeavoured to create such an impression on the minds of the inhabitants of this dangerous coast, as would be likely to prove highly beneficial to any British ship that might have the misfortune to suffer a similar accident to that which had befallen the Oscar. On leaving Khore Gerany the Resident touched at Muskat, and arrived at Bushire in November 1829. The conclusion of the peace with Bahrein, which was finally ratified in Muskat in December 1829, left the Imaum at liberty to carry into effect his intention of proceeding to Zanzibar, for the purpose of quieting a dangerous rebellion which had broken out in the island of Mombassa. As this object, in all probability, would oblige him to be absent from Muskat a considerable period. His Highness made arrangements for the administration of the government of Muskat during his absence, by appointing his nephew Syud Salim his Vukeel, with full powers, and likewise subsidising the Joasmee and Beniyas Shaikhs for the better protection of his dominions. Dreading, however, the ambitious character of his relation, Syud Hillal,* the Governor of Soweik, a young * Syud Hillal's father was a first cousin of the ImauMUSKAT. man of gallant behaviour and liberal disposition, and consequently much beloved by the Arabian Tribes on the Coast of Oman, His Highness induced him, under the guarantee of the most solemn oaths and protestations, to pay him a visit in Muskat previous to his departure, and soon after took an opportunity to have him seized and detained a prisoner in one of the forts. After the completion of this short-sighted and treacherous policy, the Imaum sailed on the 15th December for the African Coast, with the conviction of his having taken most effectual means for insuring the tranquillity of his Arabian possessions during his absence. The very measure, however, which he had so unjustifiably adopted, in the face of the most sacred obligations, was nearly the cause of his ruin. It appears, that on receiving the intelligence of her brother's unjust imprisonment, the sister of Syud Hillal assembled all the chief men of Soweik together, and having acquainted them with what had occurred, asked if they would support her. They unanimously replied they would shed the last drop of their blood in her service. Upon this assurance, she took possession of the strong fort of Soweik, and having, by means of presents and entreaties, been joined by a number of the Beni Ghafoor Tribe, she began to foray and harass the Imaum's territories. The success which attended these efforts awakened the hopes of Humood bin Azan, # who had been dispossessed of a large town and district on the Coast of Batinah, called Sohar, when an infant, by his cousin the Imaum. Taking advantage of the confusion arising in consequence of the proceedings of the sister of Syud Hillal, he assembled fifty followers, and, aided by the good will of the inhabitants, surprised the garrison of Sohar by night, and succeeded in getting possession of this fortress. Once established in this stronghold, the other ports of Shinas, Lowa, and Khaboora soon fell into his hands; and thus, in the short space of one month, nearly the whole of the productive and populous Coast of Batinah was lost to the Imaum. The flame of rebellion daily spread, while the Vukeel left in Muskat displayed a miserable want of judgment and decision in this important crisis. At last, the progress of the insurgents became so formidable, that serious apprehensions were entertained for the safety of Muskat itself. A fast-sailing vessel was despatched after His High ness, to acquaint him with the state of affairs, and Syud Salim became so much alarmed at the hostile demonstrations made by Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, that he directed a communication to be made to the Bombay Government, through the Imaum's Agent in that place, requesting that two cruisers might be sent up to his assistance. In consequence, instructions were issued to the British authority in the Gulf of Persia to prevent the ruin of His Highness by every means in * Huraood bin Azan bin Ghes, a first cousin of the Imaum.MUSKAT. 201 his power 5 Jind although he was directed not to interfere on account of any partial disorders in His Highness' territories, yet he was desired not to permit any act to take place calculated to annihilate or seriously weaken the Imaum's power. In the event of an attack on Muskat being contemplated, he was to take measures to prevent it. Agreeably to this intimation, the political authority despatched a vessel of war to Muskat, with orders to assist in the defence of that place, and made arrangements for the remainder of the squadron to proceed to the same capital immediately certain information was received that the town was about to be attacked. At the same time, he took measures to prevent any of the Arabian Chiefs from acting against the territories of His Highness, and intimated to Humood bin Azan that any attempt upon Muskat would be viewed as an act of hostility by the British Government. On the 8th May 1830 His Highn ess the Imaum returned to Muskat ■•non from Zanzibar, where all his plans for the re- a. d. looo. . r • duction oi the island of Mombassa had totally failed, probably in consequence of the hurried manner in which the disturbance in his Arabian territories had called him away. On his reaching his capital, he immediately sent away the cruiser which had been despatched for the protection of that place, and in his communica tion to the British authority, announcing his return, he affected to look upon the state of the Batinah Coast as a trifling matter, easily to be settled. Altogether His Highness did not appear by any means pleased at our having considered his affairs so desperate. Previous to commencing more active operations, the Imaum in June 1830 offered Humood bin Azan the alternative of the possession of certain districts, provided he would give up Sohar and Khaboora, or immediate war. His proposal was refused, and an intimation given by the revolted chief that he was prepared to stand by the consequences. His Highness accordingly left Muskat on the 12th June, and proceeded to Burka, accompanied by two frigates. On his arrival there he com- menced assembling an array, with the intention of proceeding to the attack of Sohar. In the meanwhile Syud Hillal was still detained a prisoner, and was told that the surrender of the fort of Soweik was the only condition on which his liberty would be granted. After an unsuccessful attempt to bombard and blockade Sohar, as well as to collect forces. His Highness found that the Arabian Tribes in Oman were determined not to afford him their cordial support in his plan for bringing that place once more under his own dominion; he therefore concluded an agreement with Shaikh Humood, by which' he ceded to that chief the districts of Khizza, Khaboora, Markies, and Sohar, for the payment of an annual tribute of 8,000 German crowns 26I ( 202 MUSK AT. The towns of Shinas and Ghillal were restored to His Highness. On his return to Muskat, the Imaum liberated Syud Hillal from confine ment, and allowed him to proceed to Soweik. The total failure of his attempt on Sohar, notwithstanding the powerful demonstrations made by the British Government in sending a vessel of war to Muskat to protect that place, and its declaration that it would not permit the interference of foreign tribes in his affairs, proved in a striking manner the state of weakness to which His Highness' ill-planned and worse- executed schemes within the last three years had reduced him. In February 1831, the Imaum again declared war against Humood A D 1831 ^ zan anc ^ order to promote his views upon that place, subsidised Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur of Ras-ool-Khyma, and Shaikh Rashid bin Humeed of Ejman, by paying them each a sum of money down, with promises of a much larger amount immediately their troops joined him at Shinas, The former, as usual, took the money, and neglected to fulfil his agree ment; but the latter kept his word, so far as to proceed to the place of rendezvous with a small body of troops. His Highness, after a slight opposition, succeeded in disembarking his force near Shinas, where, :after some time, he collected about 2,000 men. Previous to adopting these measures. His Highness had taken steps to conciliate the Wahabee Chief, by sending large presents, and in some measure acknowledging his supremacy. On hearing of the preparations of the Imaum, Shaikh Tahnoon made his usual offers of assistance, Avhich, however, were rejected by His Highness, who appears to 'have considered the conduct of the Beniyas Shaikh in the attack upon Bahrein to have been, to say the least, of a very ^suspicious complexion. The consequence was, that Shaikh Tahnoon united ■his interests with those of Humood bin Azan, and, by an ex tensive foray, made by his orders into the Joasmee territories, kept Shaikh Sultan in check, and otherwise greatly crippled the arrange ments making by His Highness the Imaum for the siege of Sohar; into which place Shaikh Humood, after being defeated in the field, was forced to retreat. The town being closely invested. His Highness directed a number of heavy guns to be landed from his vessels, and batteries to be constructed, for the purpose of opening a breach ; but all his plans were completely ruined by Shaikh Humood making a sud den and unexpected sally, by which the Imaum's troops, after a slight resistance, were entirely routed ; while, to complete the ill fortune of His Highness, the men of the Beni Naeem Tribe, who had joined him under Rashid bin Humeed, turned their arms against their late allies, and joined the Sohar forces in plundering and cutting them up. The loss on the side of the Imaum was so severe (amounting to four or fiveMUSKAT. 203 hundred men) that he judged it advisable to drop all further proceed ings, and having patched up a peace with his successful relation, upon nearly the same terms as the former one, he returned to Muskat with both his finances and reputation, already severely shaken, reduced to a still lower ebb by the last unfortunate attempt. At the present date (December 1831) His Highness is collecting a large force from the Coast of Mukran and the northern ports of the Arabian Gulf. The object of these preparations is not exactly known,, but it is generally supposed they are destined for Zanzibar, on the African Coast, whither, it is reported. His Highness intends to proceed in person to attack the island of Mombassa. FURTHER CONTINUATION (TO 1844) OF THE. PRE; CEDING SKETCHES, BY LIEUTENANT KEMBALL, ASSISTANT RESIDENT, PERSIAN GULF. Captain Hennell's Historical Sketches, up to 1831, being a continuation of those drawn up by Mr. Secretary Warden, up to the year 1817, left the Imaum, after a severe loss in finance and reputation, in consequence of the total defeat of his expedition against Shinas, collecting a large force of Beloochees, destined, it was supposed, for the attack of Mom.-- bassa, on the African Coast, to be commanded by himself in person- Early in the year 1832 the Imaum left Muskat for his African a d possessions, confiding to his son, Syud Hillal bin Saeed, and nephew, Mahomed bin Salim, the direction of his affairs during his absence. Immediately subse quent to his departure, however, these were thrown into the greatest, confusion, in consequence of the seizure and imprisonment of the authorities above mentioned, by Saood bin Ali, the Chief of Burka. It appeared that a misunderstanding had in the first instance arisen between the parties, but had been explained on the latter visiting Muskat at the invitation of the Imaum's aunt. Shortly subsequent to, this accommodation, Syud Hillal, desiring to visit the district of: Eastag and its dependencies, conferred upon him by His Highness' 1 mother, proceeded, with Mahomed bin Salim, to Burka, with the inten-. tion of requesting Syud Saood bin Ali to accompany them. They were received with the greatest respect, and persuaded to enter the fort with a few attendants. Some discussion taking place at their morning repast, Saood bin Ali ordered the gates of the fort to be shut, and made them his prisoners. Their servants offering some resistance, three were-I, f I - 204 MUSKAT. ) ■ B Sn ■i killed, and the rest secured. On the receipt of this intelligence, the inhabitants of Muskat were thrown into the greatest consternation : the shops and markets were closed ; the Imaum's daughter distri buted powder and shot to the guards of the fortresses and defences, and immediately addressed letters to the Imaum, and the British authorities at Bombay and in the Gulf, calling upon the latter for support and assistance. Syud Saood in the mean timC proceeded against Musnaah, which was held by the mother of Mahomed bin Salim, and his offer to liberate her son, provided she would surrender the fort into his hands, having been rejected, invested the place. It being then the policy of the British Government to preserve the integrity of His Highness' dominions, the Resident lost no time in despatching his Assistant, with a respectable naval force, to check the designs of His Highness' enemies, as well as to afford advice and support to the existing Government; and Sultan bin Suggnr having by letter communicated his wish to commence hostilities against the Imaum's possessions, and it being also known that Humood bin Azan of Sohar, and Hillal bin Imaum, although not having apparently interfered, were secretly rejoiced at what had taken place, letters were addressed to those chiefs, as well as to the Shaikhs of Aboothabee, Soweik, and Burka, intimating that the British Government- had determined to support their ally, and further informing the latter, that the continued detention of his prisoners would lead to a collision with the British Government. Before the naval force could reach Muskat, Sultan bin Suggur had seized Khore Fukaun, Khulla, and Dubba, ports on the Batinah Coast, belonging to the Imaum; and Humood bin Azan, Chief of Sohar, with Shaikh Hillal * had prepared^ to attack Rastag, one of the most important inland places in the Imaum's territory. The latter two had given assistance to the Burka Chief in his attack upon Musnaah ; but the Imaum's daughter having succeeded in throwing reinforcements into the place,, the siege had been raised. The prisoners had been released and permitted to return to Muskat, and on the Assistant Resident's arrival at Burka, Saood bin All disclaimed all intention of rebelling against the Imaum, and protested that he had adopted such strong measures with reference to his kinsmen solely with a view to self -preservation, his life having been threatened by Mahomed bin Salim. To provide against any further aggressions and annoyances, a vessel of war was, at the request of the local authorities, directed to remain at Muskat, until the arrival of His Highness the Imaum, who was expected from Zanzibar in the course of a fort night, and these authorities were dissuaded from retaliatory measures in the mean time, and advised to turn their attention to the manage- * Chief of Soweik.MUSK AT. 205 ment of their internal affairs, and to the security of their persons and possessions from foreign aggressions or treachery. The vessel of war was very shortly withdrawn, its presence being required to give addi tional force in the demonstration against Ejman. His Highness the Imaum did not, however, return to Muskat until the 10th September, when he addressed the Resident upon the subject of the loss of his towns of Dubba and Khore Fukaun, proposing to leave the matter in his hands; but was informed that British interference, under the cir cumstances, was not called for, and moreover advised, since his absence from Muskat had been attended with so many disadvantages, to con sider the integrity and protection of his hereditary dominions para mount to every other object. These serious occurrences, as above detailed, were attributable to the imprudent policy adopted by the Imaum, in placing the government of his Arabian possessions in the hands of three individuals whose views and sentiments were notoriously at variance. The superior influence enjoyed by the son and nephew of His Highness, from their position in the capital, appears to have excited the jealousy of the Burka Chief, who (i^was asserted) had been led by the Imaum to believe that he was to be looked up to as the head of the Government, during the absence of His Highness on his expedition against Mombassa. The youth of the parties, together with their want of judgment and experi ence, seemed to have laid them open to the intrigues of several connexions of the Imaum's family, who, to further some secret purposes of their own, spared no pains to foment a misunderstanding among the members of the Government. The consequence was, that a high degree of irritation was excited, particularly in the mind of Saood bin Ali, towards Mahomed bin Salim ; and although an apparent reconciliation had been effected through the influence of the Imaum's aunt, yet the unadvised and imprudent visit made by his colleagues to Burka offered too tempting an opportunity of gratifying both his revenge and ambition to be neglected by the chief of that place, and the result was their seizure and imprisonment, and an attempt to surprise the places belong ing to the Imaum in its immediate neighbourhood. The demonstration made in the Imaum's favour by the visit of the British vessels of war to the Coast of Batinab, and their appear ance at Muskat, was undoubtedly attended with highly beneficial consequences to the interests of His Highness. The liberation by Saood bin Ali of his prisoners, for so trifling a consideration as 8,000 dollars, was to be attributed solely to the apprehensions exciited by his knowledge that an application had been made for British interference. I he support thus afforded by the British Government interrupted various intrigues carrying on against the authority of the Imaum, and inspired20(3 MUSKAT. a degree of confidence in the minds of His Highness' adherents which could not have been derived from any other source. A review of the occurrences of the preceding few years, in connection with this repetition of embarrassment, led to the formation of a very unfavourable estimate of the situation of our ally, the Imaum, at this time. It could not, indeed, be concealed, that our influence alone prevented his immediate downfall; and if the policy of the Wahabees had been less peaceable than all accounts concurred in representing it, from their attention being doubtless drawn to their own embarrassments, we should probably have been forced into actual hostilities, for the defence even of his capital itself. The menacing power of the Wahabees, and the march of their army into the province of Oman, at the invitation of a. d . 1833. mogt of the tribeSj began now to excite the fears of the Imaum for the integrity of his dominions, and he deemed it his best policy to torm a closer connection with them, under the cognis ance of the British authorities, who were at the same time fully alive to the critical nature of his situation, and aware, that unless a rupture with this fanatical and restless sect could be averted^ by the conciliatory policy of the Imaum, British assistance, or a renewed success of the Egyptian arms to the north, could alone enable him effectually to resist their encroachments. It was even to be feared that little confidence could be accorded to their forbearance, if circumstances placed the town and shipping of Muskat within their reach. It was agreed that the Imaum should pay 5,000 German crowns per annum as Zukat to the Wahabee Chief; that each was to hold possession of his own coast according to the limits then existing, the former's extending to Jaalan, the latter's thence to Kateef; and further, an engagement was entered into, binding the parties reciprocally to assist in putting down any rebellions which might arise in their respective territories. The fulfilment of this last article the Imaum assured the Resident, when laying the matter before him by letter, and through his Agent Haiee Hossein Goolam, would depend upon the wishes of the British Government. The line of policy thus marked out and pursued by the Imaum coincided exactly with the views of the British Government, who considered it advisable that His Highness' relations with the Wahabees should remain friendly ; but with reference to his being required to act in concert with them, under the terms of the engage ment, that he should avoid being led into hostilities on this account. He was gccordingly strongly urged against any participation in foreign war, and cautioned against committing himself on points of magnitude, particularly on that of the supremacy of Mahomed Ali, Pasha of Egypt, who might shortly, perhaps, be again at leisure to direct his attentionMUSKAT. 207 to this quarter. The Imaum's assistance having at this time been solicited by either of the parties contending at Bushire (the Governor of Pars and the hereditary chief of that port), he referred the subject for the opinion and sentiments of the Resident, and was by him dissuaded from* the exercise of any interference whatever. A piracy, attended with cruel and aggravated circumstances, com mitted on a Kutch Nowry off the Coast of Zanzibar, was traced by the Imaum to some of the Beni Hajee Tribe, inhabitants of Soor, a place under his authority. He seized the principal offenders, and placed them at the disposal of the Resident, to be dealt with as he might direct, as also an individual who had been one of the chief actors in the piracy on a Dutch brig in 1829, and who had hitherto evaded detection. This last was sent to the Presidency for trial, but, owing to the absence of evidence to convict him, was returned to Muskat. About the middle of the year 1834, a further exertion of our influence a d 1834 became necessary, to check the designs of aggrandisement entertained by the Imaum's relative and dependent Humood bin Azan of Sohar, who had lately taken possession of Rastag, on the death of the governor left in charge of it by His Highness; and Mahomed bin Nasir, another most confi dential servant, likewise entrusted by him with the command of places of strength in the interior of Oman, having died, it was feared these might share the fate of Rastag, and that Humood bin Azan, thus in possession of the greater part of the surrounding territory, would be come too powerful for the young and imbecile governors in authority at Muskat. The Resident, therefore, on visiting that place, informed him by letter, that if by further aggressions he placed himself in a position of actual hostilities against the dominions of His Highness, he would by so doing incur the penalty of being considered an enemy of the British Government. Nevertheless, towards the end of the year, Humood bin Azan sur prised, and partially gained possession of, the town and towers of Soweik, at a time when the governor and his people were absent on an incursion into the country. Great fears were entertained lest the fall of Soweik should entail that of Musnaah and Burka, and even Muskat itself: boats and troops being therefore immediately sent from Muskat to its relief, Humood bin Azan was compelled to retreat, with the loss of twenty-nine men, not, however, before he had plunder ed the bazar, and seized property belonging to the people of Muskat to a very large amount. The Muskat boats, in retaliation, plundered several Sohar vessels, and publicly sold their cargo. The popularity and influence of the Chief of Sohar now appeared to be continually increasing in the province of Oman, while the imbecile conduct and208 - MUSKAT. want of energy on the part of the son and nephew of the Imaum daily diminished their authority. These were guilty of a great want of judgment, in attempting to avail themselves of the interested assistance of the Joasmee, Naeem, and Beniyas Tribes, whereby they opened the door to great disorders in those quarters, likely to entail as much injury upon their own subjects as upon those of their opponents; for, fully aware of the weakness of the Government they were called upon to support, it was not to be expected that these allies would exercise much discrimination between the vessels of friends or foes,—anticipa tions which were too fully verified. His Highness subsequently entered into engagements with the Wahabee Chief's Agent in Oman, with a view a. d . 1836, to ex p u l s ion of Humood bin Azan from Sohar, Rastag, and the other dependencies of Muskat of which he had forcibly and illegally taken possession ; and, under the hope that Syud bin Mootluk's support would enable him to accomplish this long desired object, was induced to disburse a large sum of money for the expenses of the expedition. According to previous arrangement, the Wahabee force, consisting of 2,000 men, collected by detachments from the different tribes, after plundering the Coast of Batinah, besieged Sohar by land, while His Highness blockaded it by sea. The siege had not been long maintained before a misunderstanding arose, which led to its being abandoned, in consequence of His High ness having satisfied himself of the truth of the communication made by a deputation from the besieged, that, Sohar falling, the ahabee Agent intended retaining possession of it in the name of his superior, Fysul. Shortly after the above occurrences, ITis Highness proceeded to the personal superintendence of his African posses- A - D - 183 '- sions, and, principally through the assistance and gallant behaviour of Esai bin Tarif and his dependents, succeeded, by the capture of Mombassa, which had revolted, in recovering his lost authority. It having been asserted that His Highness the Imaum had agiccd with the Pasha of Egypt to pay him an annual a. d . 1839. tribute, if placed in possession of-the island of Bahrein, although his recent secret instructions from Zanzibar to the regency at Muskat were, apparently, to join cordially with Humood bin Azan in his opposition to the encroachments of Korshid Pasha, if certain that he was bond fide in the exhibition of hostility ; and the estab lishment of the supremacy of the Egyptians over the province of Oman, and the Arabian shores of the Persian ( tu II , being a contingency much to be regretted, it was considered advisable to make the Muskat author!MUSK AT. 20.9 ties aware of the line of policy adopted by the British Government, in order to insure their co-operation with the other chiefs and tribes, pre pared to do their utmost to maintain their independence, or to secure at least their neutrality. A communication from Syud bin Mootluk, accompanied by a letter from Korshid Pasha to the authorities of Muskat, calling upon them to afford him every assistance, under penalty of being considered in the light of enemies, received no attention, and the bearer was summarily dismissed. The Tmaum's opportune return from Zanzibar, in September 1839, tended to check the disturbances and quarrels which had arisen among some of the tribes only partially acknowledging his authority, and his judicious measures completely restored tranquillity. His Highness, as well as Esai bin Parif, and the Chief of the Boo Gowarah, who were now in attendance upon him, most earnestly urged upon the British Resident the advisability of his Government taking possession of the island of Bahrein,—a measure which, considering the direct opposition exhibited by its chief to the British policy, his daily drawing closer his connection with the Egyptians, and the universal feeling 0 of dis gust and hatred he had caused throughout Bahrein and its depen dencies, by his oppressive conduct, and the exactions and tyranny he permitted to be practised by his kinsmen and sons, would, they con tended, go greatly to confirm the supremacy of the British Govern- ment in the Gulf, and be hailed with delight by every well-disposed individual. The Imaum lost no time in evincing proofs of his determination to coincide in, and to act up to the views and policy of the British Go vernment, with reference to the Egyptian invasion. He exhorted the Biymee Shaikhs by letter to use every endeavour to maintain their independence, and resist to the utmost of their power the efforts of Bin Buttal, another Egyptian Agent, to obtain possession of their forts, and to rely upon his warmest support in the promotion of this object. Esai bin Parif, finding that the British Government was not disposed to guarantee any arrangements which might be entered into between himself and Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed, or to establish him at Biddah, on the Guttur Coast, under its protection; the possessions of His Highness the Imaum being also too distant from the pearl banks, to admit of his settling there; and most cogent reasons preventing an attack upon Bahrein in which His Highness' Co-operation had been promised, namely the unpleasant contingency of the chief of that island calling in t e Egyptians to his assistance, and virtually placing it under their authority ; and determining, under any circumstances, upon leaving Aboothabee, proposed to settle with his tribe (thenceforth relinquishing 2 /210 MUSK AT. hostilities against Bahrein, provided its chief maintained a like conduct towards him) on the ruins of Wukra, a town which had been a short time previously abandoned by the A1 Boo Eymen, partly from their dread of the enmity of Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed,—to whom they had never paid perfect allegiance, and with whom they had been generally on bad terms,—and partly from its possessing only an open roadstead, which afforded little shelter to their vessels. Deprived, however, of the looked for support of the Imaum,—who, for reasons unknown, most unexpectedly declined acting upon his pro mises, and, moreover, refused to send his relative Hillal bin Mahomed ; to Aboothabee, to assist the A1 Ali in quitting that place, as had been arranged,—he subsequently found himself under the necessity of leaving the Beniyas port, in opposition to the inclinations of its Chief, Kh alee fa bin Shakboot, who, no longer restrained by the influence of His Highness, would most likely instigate the Chief of Bahrein to join in harassing, if not openly attacking, the A1 Ali in their new location of Wukra. Under these circumstances, he determined to settle with his tribe upon the island of Ges or Kenn, off the Persian Coast, to which no objection was offered by the British Resident, that location having the advantage of being situated without the restrictive war limit, and therefore secure from attack or molestation by either the Chiefs of Bahrein or Aboothabee • it being, on the other hand, fully under stood that himself and followers would be equally precluded from committing any aggressions upon the territories of those chiefs. He was furnished with a letter to the Beniyas Chief, and every proper influence was exerted, to obtain the departure of his tribe without hindrance. The violent death, in December 1.839, through the agency of Baukir Khan, the Tungistan Chief, of Aga Juraal, da jure. Governor of Bushire, who (so His Highness asserted), after residing under his protection a long period, had proceeded to Tehran, and made the arrangements regarding the government of Bushire as his Agent, and under his guarantee ; or rather (as it was subsequently ascertained) for the purpose of negotiating a marriage between him and one ol the relatives of the kin', was by His Highness looked upon as a personal insult and injury to himself. He therefore contemplated adopting one of two measures, the first to send up his fleet to that port, and, landing some 5,000 Arabs, completely destroy it; the second, to make a reference to the Shah of Persia regarding the affair, and suspend any ulterior proceedings until jt could be seen what punishment His Majesty inflicted upon the murderers. This latter course was, at the advice of the Resident, adopted, and His Persian Majesty, in reply, promised to exact severe retribution for the murder.MUSKAT. 211 With the view of better carrying out the policy of the British Govern ment towards the Egyptians, and to unite as far as possible the power and resources of the various chieftains, the Resident now applied his mediation and influence to bring about a reconciliation between the Imaum and his kinsman, Humood bin Azan ; and the parties having been brought together, a treaty of peace was, after much and violent discussion on the part of the latter, drawn out and signed. The emissaries of the Egyptian Agent were received by the Imaum appa rently in the same manner as their predecessors, and the contents of their letters immediately communicated to the British authorities, except on the last occasion, when, no objection being offered by the Government in reply to his communication, he sent return presents to some value to Korshid Pasha, and, in a private interview with his Agent, io said to have made two verbal requests,—the first that the Egyptian com mander should demand the surrender of Damaum from the Bahrein Chief; the second, that he should invite Shaikh Esai bin Tarif and his followers to settle at Kateef. A British Resident was in April 1840 appointed to Muskat, to a d assume charge (under the general superintend ence of the Resident in the Persian Gulf) of the conduct of the political relations in the province of Oman, and along such portions of the coast as could be more conveniently con trolled from Muskat than from Karrack. This officer was subsequently created a Consul by the Home Government, and directed to establish his Consulate at Zanzibar, where the Imaum henceforth principally resided. At the time the blockade of the ports held by the Egyptians was contemplated (May 1840), His Highness, on being called upon, did not hesitate to assure the Government that the whole, or any part of his fleet was at their service whenever required. His Highness the Imaum, after visiting his possessions in the Persian Gulf,—Kishm, Bunder Abbas, &amp;c.,—accompanied by Syud Humood bin Azan, the Sohar Chief, with a view, as stated by them selves, to prove that the sincere friendship, consequent upon the reconciliation which had been effected between them through the mediation of the Resident, had not been interrupted, proceeded to his African possessions at Zanzibar. Humood proceeded on a visit to Bombay, where he was received by A D the Government with all suitable respect and attention, and on his return (in 1841) afforded proof of his sincerity in the lately established friendship with his relative, by the part he took in a case of rebellion which shortly occurred.I i ' 1 I f 1 t 212 MUSKAT. About two years previous, one of the Chiets of Oman, Syf bin Soley- man by name, had been placed in charge of a strong fort, situated between Rastag and Soweik, called Honken, by Syud Hillal bin Mahomed, the Governor of Muskat. Having rendered himself ob noxious to the inhabitants and ryuts by his irregular proceedings, Syf bin Soleyman was removed from his post by Syud Hillal, and another person appointed in his room. Thus affairs remained until the middle of the year 1S41, when, taking advantage of the absence of the go vernor, the deposed chief succeeded in surprising and obtaining possession of the fort of Honken. Upon the intelligence reaching Syud Soweynee, then Governor of Muskat, he wrote to his kinsman Syud Humood bin Azan, requesting his aid in its recovery, which that chief readily promised. In the mean while, overtures were made to him by Syf bin Soleyman, which he at once rejected, informing him that there was only one course left him to pursue, namely to tender immediate submission to the Muskat Government. Accordingly, finding that al the chiefs of His Highness' family were now united, and that the support he had counted upon from the ruler of Sohar, based upon t e enmity formerly subsisting between that personage and the Imaum, was not forthcoming, Syf bin Soleyman begged for quarter, which being granted, he delivered up the fort to the troops of Syud Soweynee, an proceeded to Muskat, to make his submission to that chief. Had Syud Humood bin Azan, consulting his own interests, accepted the tempting offer of the fort of Honken, little doubt existed but that the example of Syf bin Soleyman would speedily have been followed y the disaffected Chieftains of Oman ; and as the delegated authority o Svud Soweynee was altogether inadequate to the suppression of such outbreaks, the Arabian provinces of His Highness the Imaum wou before long have returned to that state of anarchy and disorder into which they had on former occasions generally fallen during the peno s of his protracted absence from Muskat. The Naeem Tribes of Brymee, instigated doubtless by the Joasmee Chiefs, made a foray in October 1842 into the a. d . 1842. territories of the Sohar Chief, whose attempts at retaliation were defeated by them, with great loss He ^erefore apphed for assistance to the Governor of Muskat, and addressed a letter to the Resident, complaining of their ungrateful cond ' Ct ' af,er . hem and friendship he had shown in co-operating with and supporting against Syud bin Mootluk, the Wahabee-Egyptian General and int^ mating his intention to nse his utmost endeavours to chastise , put an end to their annoyances. , t t u; g A piracy of a novel and highly dangerons nature occurred aboutMUSKAT. 213 time, of which the following is a detailed account. Six men, originally ofNujd, who had lately been dismissed the service of His Highness the Imaum, look their passage in a small Kishm Buggalow, bonnd with cargo from Muskat for Bunder Abbas and Kishm. In her, also, were passengers, a Hindee, # with his three wives and one child. Observing, on embarking, that some valuable property was on board, and that the crew were without arms, the Nujd men determined to make her their prize, and accordingly, on reaching the Coast otl Salameh, they rose up, murdered the Nakhoda and Hindee passenger, and wounded one of the crew, which so terrified the remainder that they offered no resistance, and the Nujdees, remaining masters of the vessel, steer ed a course for Bahrein, when a severe storm compelled them to put in for shelter to Cheroo, on the Persian Coast. The crew, whe ther from positive ignorance or designedly, declaring themselves incapable of navigating the vessel, they here sent one of their own number on shore to engage a Buggarah, into which, having transhipped the property, they released the Kishm vessel. The crew immediately took her to Kelat, and despatched a messenger overland to communicate the circumstances to Shaikh Khalfanf at Gheroo, who immediately seized and imprisoned the pirates, and, landing the pro perty, gave information to Shaikh Abdool Rahman of Kishm. On the news reaching the Commodore at the naval station, J3assadore, that officer despatched one of the vessels of the squadron to Cheroo, with a letter to the address of the Shaikh of that place, who immediately handed over the six prisoners, and replied that he was only awaiting the arrival of boats from Kishm and Bunder Abbas, to the governors of which places he had written, to deliver over the property. The three women and child, being natives of Hyderabad (Deccan), expressed their wish to return to India. It was accordingly arranged that they should be sent to Bassadore by the boat which conveyed the Kishm property. They nevertheless, by some accident (or design), found their way to Kishm, nor was it until early in the year 1S44, and after much strict inquiry and investigation, and some correspondence as to their fate with the Governor Shaikh Syf, who is supposed either to have himself illegally detained them, or exercised some undue influence in their detention, that intimation of their departure for Bombay was received at Bushire. ♦ Kerbelah Hoosein, a native of Kirman, but who had for many years past resided in India. t Shaikh Khalfan, Governor of Aseeloo, happened to be at this time at Cheroo, having temporarily fled his town, with his family and a few attendants, in consequence, probably, of the heavy exaction of the Shiraz or Lar authorities. The Buggarah engaged by the pirates belonged to him.( 214 MUSKAT. The six pirates were in January 1843 transferred to the custody , r „ of the Shaikh of Kishm, on the understanding A. D. 1843. r i • i i &amp; that a reference having been made to Govern ment for its decision as to their ultimate disposal, he should restore them, if called upon to do so. Orders having been received in March for their being sent to Muskat, to be dealt with as the Imaurn should think proper, they were brought back to Bassadore, whence (one having died in the interim) the remaining five were despatched to the care of Syud Soweynee, Governor of Muskat, by an opportunity which offered in June, with an intimation expressive of the expectation of Govern ment that their crimes should be visited with adequate punishment. The civil war at Bahrein was not viewed with indifference by the local authorities at Muskat. The total discomfiture of the chief, who had hitherto so resolutely and successfully frustrated every endeavour of the Imaum against Bahrein, and the disordered state of its affairs, afforded the prospect of carrying into effect His Highness' long cherished design of adding that fertile island to the list of his possessions. Esai bin Tarif, at heart quite as much the enemy of his present ally Mahomed bin Kha- leefa, with whom his own interests only have led him to make common cause, as of his rival Abdoolla bin Ahmed, had (there existed good grounds for supposing) invited them to make the attempt, and was prepared to join their standard whenever they did so. These were responded to only, in the first instance, by supplies of ammunition and military stores, Syud Soweynee being unwilling to enter upon so exten sive an expedition without the instructions and authority of his father, who was still absent at his African possessions. The latter referred him to the British Government, for whose sentiments he desired that an application should be made. He subsequently wrote himself to the Resident, requesting that the reply might be returned in English, and was informed that the subject had been laid before Government. The policy of the British Government, though never perfectly approving, had never hitherto interfered to interrupt the views of His Highness: but his own personal absence from the scene of action, and the incapacity and inexperience of his representative ; the probability of his giving umbrage to the Wahabees, and thereby endangering the integrity and independence of his own territories in Oman; and the fair excuse that would be afforded to the Persian Government for espous ing the cause of the deposed chief (who had already solicited its assistance), in the event of his pursuing an opposite line of policy ; and, finally, the circumstance of the ex-chief having been debarred the aid of several of the maritime Shaikhs of Oman, were now important reasons for recommending the maintenance of a perfect neutrality on his part.^ v MUSKAT. 215 Presents in money to a considerable amount have been sent up by His Highness the Imaum from Zanzibar to all the maritime chiefs, his object being to secure their assistance next year in an expedition he has in contemplation against his rebellious subjects of Seevee, who have lately defeated, with great slaughter, a force sent by him to reduce them to obedience. CONCLUSION, TO THE YEAR 1853, BY LIEUTENANT DISBROWE, ASSISTANT RESIDENT, PERSIAN GULF. We learn from the termination of Captain Kemball's Historical Sketches of the Muskat Government, that His Highness the Imaum was at this time meditating an expedition against his rebellious subjects of Seevee, and had been striving, by presents of money, to induce the maritime chiefs of the Arabian Coast to assist him in the undertaking. The plan was not lost sight of, nor did the Arab Chiefs fail to espouse His Highness' cause ; for towards the latter end of December, we find that troops to the number of one thousand left for Zanzibar in the ship Naseeree and five Buggalows, the whole commanded by Humeed bin Ahmed. To these must be added the auxiliaries from the Arabian Coast, consisting of 'the nephew of Abdoolla bin Rashid, Chief of Amulgavine, with fifty men; Ali bin Rashid bin Humeed, brother to the Ejman Shaikh, in his own Buleel, with sixty men ; and Muktoom bin Butye, of Debaye, with three vessels.' The result of the expedition we shall learn in the sequel. About this period (November 1844) the Imaum concluded aTreaty with the King of the French. ' A French squadron, commanded by Captain De Fosse, arrived at Zanzibar, armed with full powers to enter into a treaty with His Highness.' The latter had already communicated with the British Ministry, in order to obtain their sentiments on the proposed measure; and an intimation having reached him, through Captain Ha- merton, that no objections existed to his entering into relations with the French, the Treaty* with that nation was at once concluded. During the absence of His Highness at Zanzibar, whither he had proceeded on a visit to his African possessions, the Government of Muskat was left in the hands of his son Syud Soweynee, a man of a temperament singularly weak and vacillating,—one totally unfit and * Copy of this Treaty is annexed.216 MUSK AT. unable either to uphold the dignity of his father, or to coramand the obedience of his subjects. Differences arose between the Beni Jaubirand the tribes of the AlMualik and A1 Humeed, residing within the district of Burka : hostilities commenced between Humeed bin Salim, Governor of Musnaah, and the Bedouins; and none of these feuds did His Excellency find himself in a position to compose. Difficulties succeeded difficulties. While harassed by the disaffection of his own people within, news reached of the approach of a Wahabee force from without, and that the troops would shortly arrive at Brymee : Syud Soweynee was perplexed and embarrassed ; the Brymee authorities were in trepidation, and at a loss how to act, ' whether to deliver up their forts, or defend their territories.' His Excellency had recourse to his usual mode of conduct: he flew for advice to the Resident, and was recommended by that officer to keep up, if possible, a good under standing with the Wahabee Ameer, and to accede to any terms he might proffer, provided such concession did not lower the dignity of his father: if, however, the demands made by Fysul,should prove to be of so imperious and extravagant a nature as virtually to nullify his own independence as Governor, then would he act wisely by representing to the Ameer that without the consent of the British Government, whose ally he was, he never could submit to the requirments that were sought at his hands. Meanwhile, Syud bin Mootluk, the Wahabee Agent, had reached Brymee with all his forces. The holders of the forts, overawed, or thinking resistance useless, handed them over to him without demur- The maritime chiefs, too, proceeded to wait upon him, and did all in their power to manifest good will and respect towards him. Demands were made upon His Excellency Syud Soweynee, and Syud Humood bin Azan&gt; the Sohar Chief, to the amount of 20,000 and 5,000 reals respectively. Notwithstanding the bitter enmity that originally existed between the Imaum and the Sohar Chief, the reconciliation effected between them, through the mediation of the Resident, appeared to be something more than nominal, as was at the time supposed, and bid fair to prove firm and lasting ; for we now find His Excellency Syud Soweynee and the Sohar Chief drawing more closely to each other, and endeavouring by a coalition to avert the impending danger. Syud Humood was ready to fight the Wahabees, but His Excellency at one time consenting to, at another shrinking back from, the idea of hostilities, it was at length agreed that Syud bin Mootluk should be informed that Syud Humood would at once pay the 5,000 reals required of him, but that His Excel lency, ere satisfying the demands that were made upon him, would write to his father for instructions ;—until these had arrived he could not pay one farthing of tribute. Such were the terms offered, and to such did Syud bin Mootluk pretend to agree.MUSKAT. 217 The Wahabee influence, which, on first arrival of the Agent, was so great as to endanger the security of the Imaum's dominions, received a severe shock in the open defiance of the Beni Saeed. The people of this powerful tribe set at naught his authority, refused to disburse an iota of tribute, and inflicted chastisement upon his envoys. Syud bin Mootluk threatened to exterminate them, and called upon the chiefs of the coast to assist him. They however, either disgusted at his arbitrary proceedings, or for some other reason best known to themselves, begged to be excused from joining him. About this time letters arrived from the Imaum to his son, ' enjoining him to strengthen Burka, Semayle, and Nukkul, and, in the event of a rupture with the Wahabees, to confine himself to the defence of the forts, and on no account to leave Muskat.' His Highness also intimated the complete failure of the expedition against Sevee : his troops had been defeated with severe loss, and compelled to retire ; many of note were slain amongst the number Humeed bin Ahmed, who went in command of the expedition, also Nassir bin Ali, late Envoy to England. Syud bin Mootluk's forces now made a foray into the district of Burka, killed some two or three women, and carried oft' a number of the latter, as also a large quantity of sheep and camels; and when His Excellency remonstrated, and sought reparation for these aggressive acts, the only reply he received was one couched in terms most over bearing and tyrannical ; indeed the Wahabee Lieutenant seemed bent on something more than the mere venting of empty words and threats, and notwithstanding the promise so lately made to Syud Soweynee, that he would await his reply from Zanzibar, appeared to have been meditating immediate mischief ; for early in the month of June we find him summoning the Arab Tribes to assemble at a place called Ghoopee, and declaring to them his intention to march upon Muskat forthwith. They on their side were not slow to obey : a large force was speedily collected ; from the Beni Kuttub alone did he muster auxiliaries to the amount of 300 horse and 1000 infantry, and from all the rest of the tribes considerable numbers flocked to his standard. Muskat was evidently in danger. So powerful an army could not be withstood with ease, and no hopes of clemency could be entertained at the hands of so determined and merciless an invader. There remained but one alternative, either to resist successfully, or to be humbled excessively. All, however, was disorder and confusion at Muskat : either no one perceived the danger he was in, or, if he did, he cared not whether he was doomed to stand or to fall. Troops there were none, at least deserving of the name of troops. The garrison not long since had been reinforced with an accession from the neighbouring 28218 MUSK AT. tribes; they however forsook the place, and returned to their homes 1 . Such was the defenceless state of Muskat, such the lethargy of her inhabitants, when she was threatened by the 'Wahabees. Her fate seemed inevitable ; when the Resident stretched forth a help ing hand. On the 25th June 1845 he addressed a letter to the Wahabee Ameer, remonstrating against his proceedings in Oman, and begging him, if he valued the friendship of the British State, not to permit His Highness the Imaum's dominions to be thus invaded. He likewise wrote to Syud bin Moo tin k y desiring him to suspend hostilities, pending the receipt of further instructions from his chief, the Ameer. Meanwhile, also, the ships of war were sent to cruise off the Coast of Batinah, and, by constantly showing themselves, manifested the interest felt by the British towards their ally, the Imaum. At this conjuncture, too, while affairs were in so critical a position, fresh advices reached Syud Soweynee from his father, empowering him, if driven to extremities, to pay to the Wahabee an annual tribute of 6,000 crowns, and desiring him to' keep on the best of terms with the Sohar Chief. The intervention of the Resident, coupled with the opportune arrival of the above instructions, had, no doubt, a salutary effect upon the Wahabee, and inclined him to come to terms more moderate than he probably otherwise would have done; for we find the Ameer hastening to reply to the Resident's communication, and expressing the great feeling of friendship ho bore to the British Government ; and although he dilated somewhat largely upon his rights to exercise authority over the province of Oman, there can be no doubt he feit and knew that it would be wiser far to waive some portion of his asserted claims, and come to a modified settlement with His Highness the Tmaum, than to attempt carrying out his intention to the full, and thereby incur the displeasure of the British power. Whatever his feelings may have been,—whatever his motives,—the matter ended more favourably for the Muskat authorities than they had any right to expect, or deserved. His Excellency Syud Soweynee engaged in the name of his father to pay an annual tribute of 5,000 German crowns, besides a present on this occasion of 2,000 German crowns to Syud bin Mootluk, which made a total of 7,000 German crowns for the first year,—a sum exceeding by 1,000 the amount authorised by the Imaum. The Wahabee forces were withdrawn ; Mujees, a dependency of the Sohar Chief, that had been illegally seized upon, was restored, and peace was established. Scarcely had the above settlement been effected, when disturbances arose in other quarters. The people of Khuthra (a branch of the BeniMUSKAT. 219 Saeed), who, as already stated, had openly defied the Wahabee's authority, were now joined by two other tribes scarcely less powerful than themselves, the A1 Saeed and A1 Boo Rashid. These three banded together, and resolved to arrest the rising power of the invader: they busied themselves repairing their forts, taking in stores, and arming the population around. Not a messenger of Syud bin Mootluk's was permitted to pass through Batinah unmolested,—some were detained, others beaten. Presently, too, we see the Shaikh of the Naeem Tribe making overtures to the Sohar Chief, and inviting him to join in common cause with himself against the intruders, Syud Humood bin Azan gave a ready ear to the invitation. The Muttowas (a branch of the Beni Saeed j likewise coalesced, and into the hands of the latter did the Sohar Chief transfer his forts, conditioning their imme diate surrender to him whensover the Wahabees no longerstood in their way. Here, then, we have two separate confederacies—-both composed of powerful and numerous followers—embarked in the same under taking. The effect of these leagues must, no doubt, have been highly beneficial, and tended greatly to prevent the inordinate aggrandisement of the Wahabee power in the province of Oman; indeed, when we take into consideration the opposition Syud bin Mootluk met with from the above tribes, the general ill feeling borne towards him by the maritime chiefs and others, and the necessity he found himself under of coming to moderate terms with His Highness the Imaum, it can hardly be doubted that his name had of late somewhat fallen in the eyes of the people, and that he had signally failed in the execution of his proud pretensions. The affairs of Muskat with the Wahabees having been thus arranged, let us turn and inquire what was doing in other quarters. The occuirence most worthy of mention, at this period, was the con- a. d. 1845. elusion of a Treaty* with His Highness the Tmaum by Captain Hamerton, Her Majesty's Consul at Zanzibar, in behalf of Her Britannic Majesty, for the suppression of the exportation of slaves from His Highness' African possessions. The first advances that appear to have been made, towards obtaining the above agreement, were on the occasion of a visit of one of Her Majesty s vessels to Zanzibar, for the express purpose of urging upon His Highness the earnest desire that was felt by Her Britannic Majesty, and the British nation at large, that the traffic in slaves should entirely cease in his dominions. His Highness at the outset showed great reluctance to enter upon the discussion of the subject, and, at an interview with the commander of the vessel, pointed out that such a * A copy of this treaty will be found at the end of this Selection.MUSKAT. concession was more than could justly be expected of him. The traffic in slaves, he said, was a lucrative one, and without full compensation he could not dream of prohibiting it. He was informed in reply that Her Britannic Majesty was well aware of the sacrifice he would make by the adoption of Her Majesty's views, and was ready, in the event of His Highness' concurrence in the abolition, to afford him any pecuniary concession he might solicit in reason. This announcement had the desired effect. His Highness took up his position firmly, and at once declared his willingness to concede the point, should Her Majesty, by way of return, think fit to place in his possession the fertile island of Bahrein. This of course could »ot be done, and he was informed accordingly. I am not aware of the nature of the discussions that ensued ; the treaty, however, was concluded on the 2nd of October 1845, and an Act of Parliament for giving effect to its provisions was passed on the 5th of September 1848. Scarcely a year* had passed, before news reached the Resident of a gross case of infraction of the engagement,—that, too, by the represen tative of His Highness at Muskat, his own son, Syud Soweynee. The circumstances attending the case were these : in the month of November 1847 a vessel laden with slaves from Hodeidah reach ed Mirbat. At Mirbat the slaves, twelve in number, Abyssinians, were transferred from the ship into a Bndun (small boat), and thence conveyed to Muskat, where, in the dead of night, to escape the observation of any British cruisers that might be in the vicinity, they were disembarked. On being landed, their owner openly exposed them for sale, and His Excellency Syud Soweynee, notwithstanding the sacred engagement so lately entered into, became a purchaser of three of their number. The British Agent at that port very properly addressed His Excellency on the subject, and animadverted in his letter on the injustice of the proceeding. His Excellency absolved himself from all blame in the transaction by urging and insisting that ' no prohibition to the purchase and sale of Abyssinian slaves existed in the treaty' ; that it only referred to traffic in Negroes and Somalees. It was also ascertained that His Excellency was highly wroth with the British Agent for daring to interfere in the matter ; and although he abstained from showing his anger to him personally, that the expressions he made use of when speaking of him to others were most abusive and violent. The case was represented to the Bombay Government, who, through Captain Hamerton, its Agent, desired that His Highness the Imaum would acquaint his son Syud Soweynee that traffic in slaves of any description whatsoever,—be they Negroes, * Not quite a year, for the agreement commenced to take effect on January 1st, 1847. a n( l the sale of slaves took place in November 1847-MUSK AT. 221 be they Somalees, or be they Abyssinians,—one and all are like prohibited. The agreement for the suppression of the slave trade was shortly followed by another convention,* wherein His Highness established certain rules, regulating the amount to be paid by vessels entering the port of Muskat, or any other of His Highness' ports. It was thereby enacted that in all the harbours pertaining to His Highness, a full duty of five per cent, should be exacted on all cargoes transhipped from one vessel into another ; that no vessel of any nation should pay duty on cargo landed at any of his ports, should such vessel have either put in through stress of weather, or for purpose of refit, and should such cargo be re-embarked in her; and lastly,, it was therein stipulated that on no occasion should duty be charged on stores belonging to the British Government that might be landed at any of His Highness' ports. The above rules, it will be observed, affect vessels of every nation, and not exclusively those of the British State. I have thought them, however, worthy of a passing notice, believing, as I do, that they owe their origin to the Resident in the Persian Grulf, who, on more than one occasion, found himself at a loss how to decide certain claims for im munity from charges on transhipment of cargoes in Muskat harbour, that were referred for his decision by the British Agent at that port. The want of defined regulations for the settlement of such like cases was represented by him (the Resident) to the Bombay Government, and on the 13th April 1846 His Highness was induced to establish the rules above mentioned. Early in the summer of 1846 attention was called to the disturbed A D lg46 state of affairs that existed in the Imaum's rented possessions on the Persian Coast. The proceed ings connected with this affair extending over a period of more than two years, and being well nigh productive of serious complications, it may not be amiss to enter somewhat fully into an account of the cause of the disagreement, and to watch its progress through all its phases. The Imaum had two grounds of complaint ; the first, though it gave rise to much irritation, being comparatively speaking of little impor tance, shall be told as briefly as possible, and at once diposed of: In the year 1846 Mahomed Ali Bundera, an influential merchant of Muskat, visited the town of Bushire. Meerza Abbas, at that time governor, hearing that the new arrival was possessed of much wealth, and instigated, it was said, by the evil counsels of one Meer Banker, a Bushire merchant of no repute, resolved by some means or another to extort from his visitor a large sum of money. Mahomed Ali Bundera * A copy of which will be found at page 259 of this Selection.MUSKAT. was called upon to pay over a portion of his riches, and obstinately re. fused. Recourse was had to harsh measures and ill-usage, but without eflect: at last, however, driven to extremities, and finding that preparations were in course to inflict torture upon him, he agreed to pay the sum of /oU lomans. Having given the above promise, he was released, and contrived to make good his escape from Bushire harbour before he had paid any portion of the money. Meer Banker pretended that the surnof 750 lomans was due to himself, for he said that, having guaranteed the payment thereof to Meerza Abbas, he was eventually compelled to disburse the whole amount from his own pocket. During the preceding year (1845), some seven cases of indigo were sent to Bushire for sale by Syud Mahomed bin Salim of Muskat, nephew to His Highness the Imaum. Meer Banker, ever seeking a pretext for revenge, and still incensed at the escape of his would be victim, now thought a fitting opportunity for the practice of a little more villany had arrived. He declared Syf bin Salim's indigo to be the property of Mahomed Ali Bundera, and, by means of bribes, and a representation of his claims upon the latter party, induced Meerza Hedayut, acting Governor of Bushire, to seize and confiscate the whole of the boxes. These .were transmitted to Shiraz, and no appeals from the Resident either to Meerza Hedayut or to Shaikh Nassir, the de facto Governor of Bushire, could effect their relinquishment. The Muskat authorities retaliated, by the seizure of a quantity of silk, belonging to Persian merchants, that was intercepted on its way to the Presidency. Much discussion arose, and many letters were exchanged on the subject of the above 'seizure and counter seizure,' but it was not until after the lapse of close upon a year that matters were in any way settled or adjusted. We now come to the second ground of complaint: This consisted in the despatch of troops by Houssein Khan, the Go vernor of Pars, against Bunder Abbas, with a view to exacting a large sum of money from Shaikh Syf bin Nubhan, the governor, and the Imaum's deputy in that place. The Imaum was determined to resent these injuries. He addressed himself to the Governor General of India, ' intimating his desire to blockade the port of Bushire,' and also wrote to Shaikh Nassir direct, remonstrating with him for the unfriendliness of his behaviour in the matter of the indigo, and telling him plainly that as he understood Persian troops were encroaching upon, and ' destroying his possessions in Bunder Abbas, he would retaliate by destroying Bushire.' The chief fears entertained by Shaik Nassir, on receipt of the above communication, were lest the Imaum, by means of his fleet, should take possession of Karrack.MtJSKAT. 223 The Governor of Fars likewise seems to have had a wholesome dread bf the Imaum's naval superiority ; for although he did not aetually deign to express such feelingj he besought the Resident to pacify and appease His Highness,—to assure him that in no way had Persian troops encroached upon or injured his rented territories,—they had merely been despatched for the purpose of settling affairs on the frontier. The Resident, in reply, refused to interpose, until the illegally confiscated indigo had been restoied to its lawful owner. In this refusal, too, Was he justified, for the Persian Ministers had both disavowed the military proceedings of Houssein Khan, and commanded the immediate restitu tion of the indigo. That they were not sincere, however, in their professions of disavowal, is plain, for two reasons,—the indigo was not restored until after much evasion, and troops were again marched into the vicinity of Bunder Abbas, Meenao being actually invested by Fuzl Ali Khan, the Governor of Kirman. Syf bin Nubhan lost all patience, and was on the point of himself carrying into execution the threats made by His Highness of blockad ing the ports on the Persian Coast,when an intimation reached him from the Resident, 'that he would not be permitted to carry on hostilities at sea in the name of his master, and thus disturb the peace of the Persian Gulf.' His designs of retaliation were thus frustrated, and he had recourse to another line of conduct. He promised Fuzl Ali Khan, in the event of his raising the siege of Meenao, and withdrawing his troops, that he would disburse to him the sum of 12,000 E. I. Company's Rupees. Whether or not the money was paid, or whether Syf bin Nubhan merely guaranteed its payment, with a full intention to break his promise so soon as a favourable opportunity presented itself, I know not. Ruse or no ruse, however, it had the desired effect: hostilities against Meenao were suspended, and the districts were evacuated by the Kirman army. His Highness had up to the present time behaved with much for bearance, and entirely abstained from acts of aggression ; but in October 1848, perceiving that no amends were likely to be made for the insults offered to his dignity, and the wrongs done to his territories, he again wrote to the Resident, reiterating his request for sanction to proceed against the ports on the Persian Coast, The Resident had hitherto sent no direct reply, but confined himself to doing all in his power to dissuade the Tmaum from entertaining the idea of a blockade ; to assuring him that such an act would in the end prove detrimental to his own interests; and to holding out to him hopes that, through the exertions of the British Envoy at the capital in his behalf, justice would yet be done,—amends would still be made : but now the aspect224 MUSKAT. of affairs was greatly altered,—indeed it is difficult to say where matters might have ended, or what disturbances might not have arisen, had not His Excellency Hajee Meerza Aghasee, then Prime Minister at the Court of Persia, withdrawn from office, consequent upon the death of Mahomed Shah, which occurred at this season, and been succeeded by a Minister more favourable to British views, and more inclined to give ear to justice ; for instructions had been issued by the Supreme Government to the Resident, in reply to a reference he had made on the subject, that he was not to thwart or prevent His Highness from carrying into execution his threat to blockade the Persian ports, in the event of redress being refused him. Ihese instructions had anived, and the Imaum had become desperate. Meerza Aghasee's successor was appealed to. He promised redress ; he fulfilled his promise: Fuzl Ali Khan was removed from his post, and matters were peaceably settled. On taking a retrospective review of the whole course of events, we cannot but think that the Persian Ministers, previous to the demise of Mahomed Shah, however much they appeared, to disapprove of the conduct of their subordinates, they did not do so in reality. On the other hand, the Imaum, although, perhaps, all things considered, he may be said to have acted with much forbearance and moderation, conducted himself, it must be admitted, with considerable hastiness in the outset The opinion of the Resident at the time was that had His Highness, in lieu of threatening to take the law into his own hands, plainly and soberly laid his grievances before His Majesty the Shah, full redress would have been afforded for any amount of wrongs he had suffered at the hands of the Persian Government; but the precipi tate line of conduct His Highness adopted, the objectionable tone of his written address to Shaikh Nassir, the proneness to take offence dis- plaved by Shaik Syf bin Nubhan,—these all tended to provoke and exasperate the Persian Ministers, and, naturally enough, to shut out everv hope of a peaceable settlement. To speculate, however, on what might or might not have been the result of this matter, appears both idle and profitless ; let us therefore retrace our steps, and ascertain what was going on in other quarters. Towards the close of the year 1847, His Highness the Imaum espoused a grand-daughter of the late Fath Ali Shah. Th.s marnage occasioned considerable surprise to many, for no one had m any way heard of the proposed match until the lady made her ap pearance at Muskat, on her way to join His Highness at ^'Jibar No political importance, it may be observed, was attached to this Persian connexion by the British Ministei at the capital.MUSKAT. 225 Before entering upon the subject which now commands our chief attention, and led to such grave results,—I mean the conflict between the Muskat and Sohar Chiefs,—it is necessary that I should briefly describe a case of murder and piracy that had caused much agitation for a period of two years, and also make a short notice of a fresh treaty entered into by the British nation, for the abolition of the slave trade. First, then, the piracy. So far back as the latter end of the year 1846, news reached the British Agent at Muskat of the destruction by fire of a Bombay Buggalow, under British colours, off the island of Busheab, on the Persian Coast. Other rumours likewise were freely circulated, regarding the fate of the above vessel. I shall not recount the numerous steps that were taken to establish the facts of the case, nor how the pirate and murderer contrived for a considerable time to evade the hands of justice ; but simply give an outline of what did really occur, and in what manner the criminal was eventually disposed of. In the month of September 1846 a Buggalow, belonging to Nansee Thakersee, a Bombay merchant, set sail from Muskat for the Presi dency, She was commanded by one Ahmed bin .Dad Kureem, a Beloochee, INative of Muttra, subject to the Tmaum of Muskat. Having arrived in the vicinity of the island of Busheab, Ahmed bin Dad Kureem formed the project of plundering, and possessing himself of all the treasure in the vessel. He seems in the first instance to have endeavoured to carry out his purpose by stealth, and quietly, for in the dead of night, whilst the supercargo, in whose charge the money was, was asleep, he repaired to the treasure chest, and was in the act of making off with its contents, when one Moorad, a sailor on board, remonstrated with him, and caused him to desist. The Nakhoda's plans' being thus frustrated, he resolved to rid himself of his opponents, and to perform by force what he was unable to do by stealth. The following night, accordingly, at an advanced hour, whilst his unsuspecting victims were in a profound sleep, he, with a number of his followers, fell upon and savagely butchered both Moorad and the supercargo : he likewise put an end to the existence of an unfortunate slave, who happened to be standing by at the time. Some of the crew, affrighted, leaped into the sea ; many took part in the bloody deed ; and the rest, however well disposed in their hearts to resist, were too much overawed by the fierce brutality and fiendish threats of the Nakhoda and his accomplices to dream of opposing them. Ahmed bin Dad Kureem vowed instLn- taneous death to any man of the party who would not take the oath of the Zun-tullak # to keep inviolate secrecy. They then, one and all, nine- * The most solemn form of oath among Arabs-' By the divorce of the wife.'226 MUSKAT. teen in number, embarked with the Nakhoda in the long boat, having previously set fire to the Buggalow, and collected the treasure in date jars. Six of the men, notwithstanding that they had taken the oath required of them, fell victims to the Nakhoda's suspicions, and were cruelly slaughtered ; two others, fearful for their lives, let themselves down into the sea close to Shinas, and swam ashore, whence they proceeded to Lingah, and back to Muttra, their native city. Scarcely had they reached the latter place, before they were seiz ed and conveyed to Muskat, as accomplices of Ahmed bin Dad Kureem's. For a length of time they denied all knowledge of the matter, and assured both His Excellency Syud Soweynee and the British Agent that, so soon as the vessel caught fire, they threw themselves into the sea, to save their lives ; that they knew nothing further. Guilt, however, attached itself too strongly to these individuals to permit of their story being credited. Recourse was had to intimidation, and preparations were &amp; even made for inflicting torture upon them; when, on being promised full pardon and liberty, they turned informers, and related all that had occurred. In March 1847, after endless search and trouble, Ahmed bin Dad Kureem was likewise apprehended, and conveyed to Muskat, where, on being examined, and told that there was evidence forthcoming to convict him of his dastardly act, he at once confessed his guilt, and threw himself upon the mercy of his accusers. The matter of Ins trial was referred to the Bombay Government, who desired he might be tried before the Native court in Muskat, and suffer such punishment as the judicial authorities in that town might think fit to award. His Excellency Syud Soweynee, strange to say, did not so much as consult the court of justice regarding the punishment to be in flicted, nor did he cause any form of trial whatsoever to be undergone by the prisoner, but simply and plainly pronounced sentence o death upon him. His execution took place on the 5th day of Octo ber 1848, in the presence of the whole concourse of the Muskat P We now come to the Treaty for the suppression of the Slave Trade. This engagement was one entered into by the a. d . 1849. Chief of Sohar with the British Government, to- wards the latter end of the spring of 1849. The reins of the Sohar Government were at the time held hy Syud Hnmood bin Azan s son, Syud Syf bin Humood, and not by himself, he having been compel e tp resign his authority into the hands of the former some considera e time previous, It is needless entering into detail on this subjt JMUSKAT. 227 suffice it to say that the provisions of the treaty were similar in extent and purport to those contained in the convention concluded with His Highness the Imaum in 1845, and that they came into operation on the 22nd of June 1849. To preserve the connection of the British relations with the Sohar and Muskat Governments, and for a right understanding of the subject before us, it is necessary that we should, ere plunging into the thick of the conflict that at this time occurred, step back a little, and watch the risings of jealousy that so shortly led to a rupture. The reconciliation effected between His Highness the Imaum and Syud Humood bin Azan by the Resident, in 1839, promised for a length of time to keep firm and stable ; but the imbecility of His High ness' representative, Syud Soweynee, the utter want of decision and courage displayed by him during his late struggle with the Wahabees, the little or no support he proffered when the Sohar Chief desired to withstand the invaders, and sought his assistance,—all these things con tributed to alienate Syud Humood bin Azan, and drove him to disre gard his should-be ally, and look for aid from others. It is mentioned in the early part of this narrative, that on the occa sion of the Sohar Chief entering'into a confederacy with a number of tribes against the Wahabees, he transferred his inland fortresses to the charge and holding of the Muttowas. This measure gave much offence to His Excellency Syud Soweynee, and greatly excited his fears: he looked upon the proceeding as one full of danger to himself, and forming but the commencement of a series of frauds ;—he thought his kinsman was aspiring to the Imaumship. The instalment of the Muttowas was shortly followed by the direct interference of Humood bin Azan with the affairs of His Highness. He wrote to a number of tribes, desiring them to associate themselves with his interests, and to forsake their allegiance to the Imaum. This increased the apprehen sions of the Muskat Governor, and led him to pour forth his tale of grievances to the Resident, The Sohar Chief was called upon to afford explanation of his conduct, and received warning that any acts of aggression by him upon the Imaum's dominions would be viewed in a most serious light by the British Government. Syud Humood's reply was highly characteristic, and portrayed the feelings he held towards the Muskat authorities. He denied the accusation wherewith he was charged, and assured the Resident that Syud Soweynee's appeals should never be attended to, for he was weak and fanciful as a child, and incapable of discerning good from evil ! Presently, however, at the time when Syud Humood had been • deprived of power by his son, we find the integrity of the Sohar228 MUSK AT. Government placed in jeopardy, by the impolitic measure of leaving the defence of its forts to a foreign and powerful tribe. The Muttowas, a warlike and ambitious race, took advantage of every opportunity to strengthen themselves in their present position, and by degrees succeeded in usurping all authority. They proclaimed themselves the lawful possessors of the Sohar forts, and contrived, by a combination of rare dexterity and force, to eject therefrom Syf bin Humood, then chief of the place ; they also seized upon Syud Ghes, brother of Syud Humood, and to prevent all chance of either regaining his lost posses sions, they cast them both into prison. Syud Syf after a while effected his escape, and calling in Shaikh Kahtan bin Syf, the Shinas Governor, to his assistance, made a vigorous and sudden attack upon Sohar, expelled the Muttowas, and re-establish ed himself in authority. This authority was not, however, to remain with him long. The father, ever jealous of the son, resolved to destroy him, and hired the confidential servant of his master to carry into execution his base and treacherous purpose : Syud Syf was assassinated in his bed, and the murderer resumed his position. Such was the posture of affairs in Sohar when Syud Soweynee appeared off Shinas in his frigate the Fyz Allum. The immediate object of his visit was to act in concert with Syud bin Tahnoon, the Aboo- thabee Chief (with whom His Excellency was now in close alliance), against Syud bin Mootluk, the Chief of the Wahabees. He also found his presence necessary in that quarter to counteract the plans oi the Joasmees, who were mediating an attack upon His Highness' forts of Shinas, Khore Fukaun, and Ghulla. On arrival. His Excellency expressed a desire to hold an interview with Syud Humood bin Azan, for the purpose of renewing his friendly relations with that chief, and restoring to their original footing the terms of the treaty concluded between Syud Saeed and himself. J he Sohar Chief cheerfully responded to this apparently generous appeal, and hastened to wait upon His Excellency. Their first interview was held at a place called Mudwal, situate between Sohar and Shinas, and was shortly followed by another at Shinas itself, on which latter occasion, so little did Syud Humood suspect His Excellency of treachery, so convinced was he of the sincerity of his professed motives, that he alighted at Shinas unattended by escort, without retinue—his only attendants consisted of one confidential servant, and other followers to the number of ten ;—this, too, at a time when His Excellency had come in a ship equipped for war,—when a land force destined to co operate with the Aboothabee Chief against Brymee had arrived on the spot. Let us now proceed to relate the result of the meeting,—let us leainMUSK AT. 229 with what generosity and faithfulness His Excellency was led to respond to the advances of his unsuspecting guest. After receiving a visit from Syud Humood bin Azan, it was proposed that they should proceed inland on a pleasure excursion, whereby they could enjoy change of air and scene, and also freely discuss any matters that had to be arranged between them. They did so. Much cordiality was evinced on either side, and perfect concord had existed on every subject, until His Excellency expressed a hope that the Sohar Chief would join Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon and himself in the proposed expedition against Brymee. On this point, however, Syud Humood was not to be moved ; no words, no arguments could induce him to waver: he had but one reply,—he could not, he would not, join His Excellency; he was in strict alliance with the A1 'Boo Khureyban, and they were averse to the project;—he could not, he would not, assist 'in the expedition. This unexpected display of stubbornness on the part of his guest greatly incensed His Excellency, and led him to commit a breach of faith and hospitality rarely equalled, I believe, in Arab history. He determined to make his guest a captive; and at Shinas he caused him to be seized, bound, and conveyed to the frigate in chains. He then issued orders for the immediate march of the land forces upon Sohar, and himself proceeded thither by sea. On the arrival of the troops before the fort, Syud Ghes (brother of Syud Humood) was called upon to surrender: he sent for reply a charged salute from his batteries. The fort was invested both by land and by sea. Syud Ghes applied to Shaikh Sultan for succour, and engaged, in the event of being freed from his present difficulties, to pay him a yearly tribute not less in amount than that he had hitherto paid to the Wahabees. He also promised to co-operate with him against Shinas and the other forts of His Highness on the Batinah Coast. Such an appeal was not likely to be disregarded by the Joasmee, whose grasping and ever calculating spirit perceived at a glance what a golden harvest was in store ; for not only did he feel that Syud Ghes was purchasing help by an acknowledgment of his own subserviency, but he also entertained rich ideas of personal aggrandisement in the direction of Batinah. The Sohar Chief's terms were speedily closed with, and troops were despatched to his immediate assistance. In the mean time Syud Soweynee, as was his custom, had met with naught but reverses: his troops had been defeated by a handful of the Sohar garrison, who sallied forth from their defences; the A1 ^ aee d and other tribes refused to espouse his cause ; the Joasmee succours were daily expected ;—in fact, there seemed no chance ol success. His Excellency therefore raised the siege, and returned to230 MUSKAT. Muskat. Syud Ghes now hastened to join the force of Shaikh Sul tan and on his arrival, the combined armies laid siege to Shinas. The resistance offered by Shaikh Kahtan bin Syf was stout and obsti nate —he well sustained his reputation for courage and valour; and had' Syud Soweynee ably supported him, he might have been spared the pain of surrender. His munitions, however, ran out, ineffectual attempts were made to introduce fresh supplies, and on the 10th May 1850 Shinas was compelled to a. d . 1850. surrender. Khore Fukaun shared the same fate, after a siege of two days ; Ghulla had already fallen ; and thus, in aa incredibly short space of time, did the whole of the Batinah Coast, from Merya to Cape Musseldom, fall into the hands of the Joasmee Chief and Syud Ghes bin Azan. . , The season of the pearl fishery was now at hand, and all parties be came anxious for a temporary cessation of hostilities. The tr00 P s of Shaikh Sultan therefore returned to Ras-ool-Khyma, and through the mediation of the A1 Saeed was a four months^ truce effected between Svud Soweynee and his kinsman Syud Ghes bin Azan. Let us now revert to the prisoner, Syud Humood bin Azan, and in- quire how he fared in his dungeon. The treatment he experienced at the hands of Syud Soweynee was of a very severe character : he was loaded with chains, and confined in a place of heat unbearable no liberty, no comforts, no freedom from restraint, was accorded him, health gave way, and nature quickly sank unde ' UC ^™ e fi When the news of his brother's death reached feyed Ghes, tieiy temper became inflamed with exceeding rage : he burned f °' even g e J and eagerly sought for a victim whereon to vent his fury He sought no? in vain: the brave and courageous Shaikh Kahtan bin Syf was cauffht intrieuing, cast into prison, and doomed to perish.

D. 1851. pain and sorrow the injustice and wrongs committed by Syud Soweynee, to dream of supporting his cause. They did not, however, forsake His Highness in the hour of distress : they counselled his imme diate return to his disturbed possessions; they animadverted with the greatest delicacy upon the conduct of his son and representative ; they pointed out the course that appeared most fitting for His Highness to pursue ;—they offered, in fact, every moral support in their power. His Highness gave heed to the friendly warning, and repaired with haste to Muskat. The well known character of Syud Saeed for moderation and justice gave every room for hope that matters might once more be restored to peace and quietness. Syud Ghes was however called upon to restore the forts he had lately seized with the assistance of his ally Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, on the Batinah Coast. He refused, and hostilities were at once commenced. His Highness proceeded to Khaboora, with two ships and a number of Soor boats, having previously despatched a force by land under the command of Syud Soweynee, to invest the place. The campaign opened in September 1851, and began auspiciously enough for the cause of His Highness : Kasbeeah fell without a struggle ; Khaboora was taken after a bombardment of two days' duration ; and other preparations were in course, when His Highness effected a meeting with Sultan bin Suggur, and induced him to abandon the cause of the Sohar Chief. Deserted by the Joasmees, opposed by the combined forces of Syud Saeed and the Shaikh of Debaye,* Syud Ghes stood but little chance of success. He turned, however, to bay, with much display of fierceness, and strove to meet his opponents single-handed. They proved too strong for him : Shinas fell an easy prey to the allied artnies, and Syud Ghes was compelled to surrender. Sohar was handed over to His Highness ; Rastag and Hebee remained in possession of Syud Ghes, who also received from the Muskat Government a pension of 200 dollars per mensem,—a poor indemnity indeed for all the wrongs he had suffered. In the month of May 1852 occurred the loss of the British ship a d 1852 Centaur off Ras-ool-Hud, in the country of the Beni Boo Ali. She ran ashore in a thick fog at the hour of midnight, close to a place called A1 Khubba, and no efforts of the crew could succeed in getting her off. At daylight on the following morning, the Arabs, perceiving the helpless condition she was in, poured down in shoals upon her, and plundered her of the whole of her valuable cargo, which consisted of 1,600 chests of indigo, besides rice, sugar, and other goods, valued in the * The British Agent at Shargah reports in one of his letters that f&lt; the Shaikh of Debaye proceeded to Muskat with 500 men, in nineteen vessels.'232 MUSK AT. aggregate at ten or eleven lakhs of rupees. The crew, overpowered by numbers, left the vessel, and proceeded to Muskat in three Native boats that were hired for the purpose from the people of Soor. Every pos sible exertion was made by the Resident and other political officers to recover the plundered property, but so scattered had it become, and so far inland had it probably travelled, that there remained but little chance of success. The vessel was destroyed by the Arabs. The disorders of the Muskat Government, that had been appeased by the arrival of His Highness Syud Saeed, and the measures he adopted, were merely suspended for a time. It was not likely, indeed, that the line of conduct pursued by His Highness, however well it succeeded in humbling the pride of the Sohar Chief, and wresting from him the posses sions he had so lately acquired, should tend to restore order of a permanent character. Towards the close of the year 1852, His Highness Syud Saeed left Muskat, and returned to Zanzibar, and his African possessions. His departure was the signal for revolt : fresh disturbances arose ; signs of disaffection were freely manifested by the tribes in Batinah, and the whole of His Highness'dominions was in ablaze with dissensions. At this conjuncture, too, the advancing steps of the W ahabee Chief were heard thundering once more in the distance. He came in the character of arbiter and redresser of wrongs suffered by his children (the Shaikhs) in Oman. He took up his position at Brymee, and summoned the chiefs to attend him. The force despatched on this occasion was so unusually large, and entrusted to the command of so influential a person,—that person being no less than a son of the great Ameer himself, that all the tribes, struck with awe, hastened to meet its commander, and seemed to vie with each other in acts of submission and homage towards him. The maritime chiefs, too, repaired with haste to pay their addresses, and to relate their tales of woe. Scarcely had Abdoolla bin Fysul arrived, ere he sent forth demands for the immediate cession of Sohar, and the payment of tribute so large in amount that it was plain he sought but a pretext, in the refusal that must of necessity follow, to attack and lay waste the districts of Batinah. The Sohar Chief, it cannot be doubted, added fuel to the flame, by recounting with fiery eloquence the wrongs he had suffered, the indignities that were heaped on his ill-fated brother. A blow, it was manifest, was about to be aimed at His Highness' dominions, that would imperil their safety, and endanger their integrity. The aspect of affairs was gloomy indeed, and had it not been lor the opportune presence of the Resident on the Arabian Coast, and the steps he adopted to stay the storm, coupled with the noble stand of Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon in support of His Highness, matters would have proved mostMUSK AT. 233 truly serious; for not only was His Highness threatened with ruin by the confederacy in league against him, but great fears also existed lest a renewal of the Maritime Truce, about to expire, should not be effected ere hostilities commenced. The Resident had proceeded to the coast for the express purpose of arranging a firm and lasting peace among the Arab Tribes, and now so engrossed was their attention with the designs of the Wahabees, that not one of their number found himself either able or willing to return to his post. It seemed highly probable, therefore, that unless the crisis had passed ere the coming month of June, either His Highness would fall a prey to his enemies, and maritime disorder in every shape and form arise, or else the British representative must act, on his own responsibility, with a degree of coercion entirelv opposed to the rules of British policy. Such was the position of affairs when the Resident reached the Coast of Arabia,—a position, it must be admitted, highly difficult and embar rassing. He at once addressed a letter of strong remonstrance to Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, charging him in the name of the British Government to abstain from intriguing, and desiring him to return to his seat, to meet the British representative, who awaited his coming. Syud Soweynee was likewise apprised of his presence, and his inten tion, if dangers thickened, to repair to Muskat in person, for the purpose of assisting him. To Abdoolla bin Fysul was conveyed the extreme surprise of the Resident that any circumstances whatsoever should induce him to prevent the Shaikhs from obeying his call. These measures, backed by the presence of a vessel of war sent to cruise on the Arabian Coast, together with the decided tone of opposition adopted by Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon, tended greatly to restrain the Wahabees. His Excellency hastened to Sohar, placed the fort in a state of defence, and assumed a hostile attitude. After some display of hesitation, the plan of attacking Batinah was abandoned, and a series of negotiations entered upon, which ended in a treaty of alliance, offensive and defensive, between Syud Sowevnee and Abdoolla bin Fysul, whereby the Muskat Government agreed to pav to the Wahabee Ameer an annual tribute of 12,000 crowns, besides arrears to the extent of 60.000 crowns, and the usual supply of provisions and stores. The Wahabee likewise pledged himself to assist His Excellency in every hour of difficulty; and the boundaries of the do minions of either remained as heretofore. Matters remained in this condition for a length of time, when fresh A ^ 1S53 difficulties presented themselves. So strong was the ill-feeling of the tribes of Batinah towards Syud Soweynee, that they nearly one and all refused to disburse one farthing of tribute. Disturbances raged on every side: the Wahabee 30M USKAT. commenced calling alond for tribute, and threatened an invasion should it not be speedily paid to him. His Excellency referred Abdoolla bin Fysul to the terms of the treaty, and called upon him to bring back the rebels to allegiance. He did so, though with reluctance, and in the month of December 1853 the tribes became reconciled to His Excel lency, and an amicable arrangement was concluded between himself and Abdoolla bin Fysul.BRIEF NOTES, CONTAINING INFOBMAIION ON VARIOUS POINTS CONNECTED WITH HIS HIGHNESS THE IMAUM OF MUSKAT; AND THE NATURE OF HIS RELATIONS WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, BY LIEUTENANT COLONEL ATKINS HAMERTON, h. m.'s consul, and e, i, co.'s agent, in the dominions of h. ii. the imaum of muskat.

Primogeniture amongst Arabs is not acknowledged as giving any bona fide right of succession. There are but two men who can be fairly said to be principal men of the Court, who interfere in affairs of Government: one is at Muskat, Saeed Mahomed bin Saban, the Imaum's nephew, a clever man, of about forty years of age (he is a sort of adviser with the Imaum's son, Syud Soweynee, the Governor of Muskat); and the other at Zanzibar, * A.

This man has much influence with the pagan chiefs on the Coast of Africa. All the respectable men at Muskat and Zan zibar generally attend daily at the Durbar, or when the Imaum holds his assembly, three times a day. They do not interfere in the Go vernment; but if called on by the Imaum they would do as desired. There are many of these men highly respectable, and wealthy for men in these countries. The Imaum has not any regular Ministers, or Secretaries for diiTerent departments; he has two men who write his letters, and convey messages to Europeans. These men are ill paid. His Highness employs his Nakhodas (who all speak English) when transacting business with Europeans, and these men are supposed to be the Ministers by strangers.

Yet in Oman, formerly, there existed considerable manufactories of silks, and mines were also worked in various places. I have seen old mines in several places, but the Arabs had not even any tradition regarding them. I always got the constant answer of the Arab, touching anything of which he knows nothing (and indeed they do know but very little, and care to know but little),— Allah Aeem hadha row shugne fd Aeiom ul Kaffar!

Oman the religion is Mahomedan, the language Arabic. Such a thing as caste, as known in India, does Religion, Language, not ex i s t amongst the Arabs. The tribes in Tribes, and Castes. Qman are various. In the African territories of the Iraaum but little is known of the tribes; they are almost all pagans, except those immediately on the Coast, the Sawheelies, who are many of them Mahomedans, yel Africans. The principal tribes in Oman are, east and south of Muskat, towards the Hadhrai Maut,—the Hurth, 2,000, the Chiefs Shaikhs Nassir bin Ali and Salah bin AH; the Massakeeah, 4,000, Chief Shaikh Saeed bin'All al Mogeawee ; the Beni Boo Hassan, 1,500 to 2,000, prineipal Shaikh Mahomed bin MasseUim ; the Hajneen, 1,000, Chief Shaikh Mahomed bin Aamr; the Habbeas, 700, head Shaikh Aamr bin Eashid; the Beni Rawaheeyah, 500, Chief Shaikh I know no, ; the Bern Riam, 3,000 to 3,500, living in ov about the Jibbae Kudhera (the Green Mountains), six days' distance from Muskat;-are on good terms wuh the Imaum, but say they have never been in subjection to any one. There are numerous branch tribes connected with these people : they do not mix much with the adjacent tribes, are a violent and unru y people, given to intoxication, and other vices not usual amongst Arabs Their country produces great quantities of fine fruits,-yapes* of most excellent quality; peaches; vegetables; violets and roses in pro fusion, These mountains are the Neilghcrncs of Arabin, but the people dislike strangers coming amongst them.

Some time ago their Shaikh was Saecd Mashun. They say they are about 1,000 souls. * They have ripe grapes for eight months in the year, crop after crop, with which they make wine and distilled liquors ; but they do not sell them.MUSKAT. 241 To the west of Muskat is the Huddabei Tribe,—who the Shaikh is now E do not know; they are 500; the Jenadie, 2,000,—who is the Shaikh at present I know not; the Beni Aamr, and the Hawasseena, 1,200, Shaik Aamr bin Rashid ; the Jeal-i-Saad (Children of Saad), 15,000, Shaikh Jemul-i-Saad. This is the great tribe of Oman, and by whom, and from whom, the Imaums were in the olden time selected. In the Wadi Maaweel are many small tribes, with their Shaikhs, in all about 2,000; and in and near the district of the Ahil-i-Nachl are several small tribes, subject to the Ya Araba: the Shaikhs are many; their names I do not know. In the Zahnah districts are the Beni Kelban, the Beni Ali, the Ahilee Younkei, the Beni Yakoot, the Beni Havill, the Boo Khuriban and the Shakul, the Maahyahee and the Beniyas, who, with their several Shaikhs, own the Imaum's authority, and consider him as their chief. These tribes^ are about 12,000 collectively. These are the principal tribes of Oman; but lam not aware, nor have I ever heard, of any particular story or history of any of them. They know exceedingly little of their own history : Arabs are perhaps the least thinking people in the world. Of the tribes on the Coast of Africa, in the Imaum's territories, but very little is known : they are numerous, but as yet all savages, excepting those along the coast. XIV.—Nothing like a court house or a court of justice exists in the Mode in which Justice is Imaum ' s territories. The Koran is the code, administered. Civil and and the Shaikhs, assisted by the Kazees and Moollas, at once decide all lawsuits, and admi nister justice,—in criminal cases on the instant; and certainly fair jus tice is generally done. If the Imaum were present, or near, anything of importance would be referred to him. At Muskat and Zanzibar^ when cases are tried by the Kazee, the decisions are not so fair, bri bery is usual; but an appeal can always be made to the Governor or the Imaum when he is present. The Imaum's Government is of a purely patriarchal character : there are no establishments of any kind similar to those existing in the States of Native Princes in India • all things are in the most primitive condition,—such as it may be assumed they have been in from a very remote period.

The yellow fever has been here ; I have seen three Europeans die here of it; and Her Majesty's ships on the coast for the suppression of the slave trade have lost numbers of men from it. It may be observed that there are no people in the world from whom it is so difficult to get information as from Arabs. They have a reli gious dislike to talk of the past, they care but little for the present, and for the future nothing at all. I{ viX—NATURE OF THE RELATIONS OF HIS HIGHNESS THE IMAUM OF MUSK AT WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT. His Highness the Imaum of Muskat is an independent Sultan. His ancestors ^have ruled the Kingdom of Oman for nearly three hundred years, in Southern Arabia, and most of them have been Imaums of Muskat, the capital of Oman, the seaport, in lat. 23- 3-' N , and long 58° 33' E The Imaum of Muskat has also possessions on the Coast ot Beloochistan, and rents Bunder Abbas and its dependencies, on the Southern Coast of Persia, from the Persian Government. His Highness has besides very extensive territory on the East Coast of Africa, extending from Mukdeesha {the Majadaxa of the in lat. 2° 2' S., and long. 45° 26' E., to the river Lindee, in lat. 11) b., ^'Xllriritlsh Government have not any political relations of a separate nature with any of the Shaikhs or Chiefs in any part of the territories of the Imaum of Muskat, either in Arabia or Africa : all the ments or treaties which have from time to time been enteie into y East India Company, and the Government of Great Britain, have eenMUSKAT. 243 made with the Imaum of Muskat, and not with any of the Chiefs or Shaikhs. Political relations, in a written form, have existed between the Honorable the East India Company and the Imaum of Muskat since the year 1798, when a Treaty* or Kuolnamah was concluded on the 12th October in that year, between the Honorable Company and His High ness the Imaum of Muskat, through the intervention of the Nuwab Etmandood Duola Mirza Mehdy Ali Khan Bahadoor Hushmunt Jung. In the year 1800 a further Treaty was concluded between the Imaum of Muskat and the East India Company, the late Sir John Malcolm being Envoy. In this Treaty, which is dated the 18th January 1800, it was agreed that the former Treaty or Kuolnamah of the 12th of October 1798, between the Imaum of Muskat and the Honorable .East India Company, through the intervention of the Nuwab Etmandood Dnola Mirza Mehdy Ali Khan Bahadoor Hushmunt Jung, should remain fixed and in full force, and further for the residence at Muskat of a respectable English gentleman, as Agent from the British Government, through whom all matters between the two States should be truly and fairly stated and represented. On the 29th August 1822, a Treaty was proposed to the Imaum of Muskat, for the prevention of the slave trade, by Captain Fairfax Moresby, of His Britannic Majesty's ship Me.nai, and on the 7th September 1822 His Highness the Imaum concluded the engagement for the prevention of the slave trade from his dominions to all Christian countries, and the following stipulations were agreed to:— The Imaum to prohibit the sale of slaves to every or any Christian nation, and to order his officers throughout his dominions, in case they found the owners of any Arab vessels taking slaves for sale to any Christian country, to seize such vessels, and to punish the com manders. The crews of all Arab vessels to be enjoined to report the transport of slaves to Christian countries, in order that the commanders of the vessels might be punished, and in default to be themselves punished; also for the settlement at Zanzibar and other places of British Agents, to watch and report the traffic in slaves with Christian nations ; permission to seize vessels laden with slaves, bound to Christian countries ; certificates to be furnished to all vessels departing on a voyage, stating from what port sailed, and to what port bound ; vessels found without this certificate to be seized. On the 10th September 1822 His Highness the Imaum further A copy of this, and of all other treaties, with the exception of that connected with the suppression of the slave trade, existing between the Honorable the East India Company and His Highness the Imaum of Muskat, follow this narrative. The treaties connected with ths abolition of the slave trade are given in a subsequent portion of this Selection.—.EcMor.244 MUSK AT. granted, on the requisition of Captain Moresby, permission for the ships of war of His Majesty the King of England to seize Arab vessels with slaves on board to the eastward of Cape Delgado, passing sixty miles to the eastward of Socotra, on to Din Head, the western point of the Gulf of Cambay, unless driven by stress of weather. This permis sion granted to His Majesty's ships only, and not to the ernisers of the Honorable Company. On the 17th December 1839, the Imaum consented to three additional articles being added to the Treaty con cluded by Captain Moresby on the 7th and 10th September 1822, in which the following stipulations were agreed to :— In the event of the Government cruisers meeting the Imaum's vessels, or those of his subjects, in a line drawn from Cape Delgado, two degrees eastward of Socotra, ending at Pussem, suspected of being engaged in the slave trade, the cruisers to be permitted to detain and search them, and if found carrying on the slave trade beyond these limits, the cruisers to be allowed to seize and confiscate such vessels and their cargo, unless such vessels were driven by stress of weather beyond the line, in which case they were not to be seized; the sale of all Somalees (a free people) to be considered as piracy, and all persons convicted of selling Somalees to be punished as pirates. These additional concessions were granted by the Imaum on the requisition of Lieutenant Colonel Hennell, Resident in the Persian Gulf. On the 18th August 1845, in a letter to Captain Hamerton, Her Bri tannic Majesty's Consul, and Honorable Company's Agent, His High ness the Imaum consented to rectify an omission in Article IV. of the Arabic version of the Treaty of the 7th September 1822, when His Highness declared it incumbent on himself, his heirs, (^sc. to assist to apprehend British subjects engaged in the slave trade, on a requisition from the accredited Agent of Government. On the 31st May 1339, a Commercial Treaty was concluded at Zanzi bar, between Her Britannic Majesty and His Highness the Imaum of Muskat, by Captain Robert Cogan, of the Honorable Company's naval service, in which is provided for as follows:— Reciprocal liberty of intercourse, trade, and residence ; commercial privileges of the most favoured nations; purchase, sale, or hire of houses in the Imaum's dominions; inviolability of houses and warehouses; search of ditto in certain cases', appointment and pri vileges of Consuls ; protection of Natives, servants of British subjects; punishment of ditto ; settlement of disputes between British subjects, and between them and other subjects ; disposal of property of deceased persons, and of the property of British bankrupts; recovery of debts; duty on British goods; exemption of British ships entering to refit;MUSKAT. 245 liisii' e,!] freedom of exportation and importation ; prohibition of monopolies and exclusive privileges; exceptions, valuation, and sale of British goods; passage of merchandize in the event of war with a third party ; vessels in distress, and shipwrecks; suppression of the slave trade; vessels of war of the East India Company allowed to give full force and effect to the stipulations of this treaty, in the same way as vessels of war of Her Britannic Majesty ; commerce and navigation within the limits of the East India Company's Charter. The ratifications of this treaty were exchanged by Lieutenant Colonel Hennell, Resident in the Persian Gulf, on behalf of Her Majesty, at Muskat, on the 22nd July 1840. On the 2nd of October 1845, a further Treaty was concluded at Zanzibar, with His Highness the Imaum of Muskat, by Captain Atkins Hamerton, 15th Regiment Bombay Native Infantry, Her Bri tannic Majesty's Consul, and Honorable Company's Agent, on the part of Her Majesty, for the suppression of the exportation of slaves, from and after the 1st January 1847, from the African possessions of His Highness. By this treaty the Imaum engaged to prohibit the export of slaves from his African dominions, to prevent and suppress the trade, to prohibit the importation of slaves into his Arabian possessions from any part of Africa, and to use his influence with the Chiefs of the Red Sea, Arabia, and the Persian Gulf, to prohibit and prevent the impor tation of slaves from Africa into their respective territories ; and also granted permission to the ships of Her Majesty's of the Honorable Company's Navy, to seize and confiscate all vessels, the property of His Highness, or of his subjects, carying on the slave trade, excepting such as are engaged in the transport of slaves from one port to another in his own dominions in Africa, between certain limits provided for in the treaty. On the 5th September 1848, an Act was passed by the Parliament of Great Britain, for giving effect to the provisions of this treaty. .nr. iriti? sir STREATIES, ENGAGEMENTS,* &amp;c. concluded between HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY, AND HIS HIGHNESS THE IMAUM OP MUSKAT; and between THE HONORABLE EAST INDIA COMPANY AND HIS HIGHNESS.

If a vessel of other nations imports any goods into the territories of the Sultan of Muskat, and pays less duty than five percent., the same duty only shall be levied on similar goods imported by a French vessel into the said territories. A French vessel, after she has paid the duty of five per cent., shall not be subject to any other charges, such as anchorage, pilotage, &amp;:c.; nor shall any charge be made on that part of the cargo which may remain on board a French vessel; but if the vessel shall go to another part of the dominions of the Sultan of Muskat, duty shall be levied at five per cent. The abovementioned duty having once been paid, the goods may be sold, by wholesale or retail, without paying any further duty. No charge whatever shall be made on French vessels which may enter any of the ports of the Sultan o Muskat for the purpose of refitting, or for refreshments, or to inquireTREATY BETWEEN MUSKAT AND FRANCE. 269 about the state of the market; and they shall enjoy the same privileges which are enjoyed (by the vessels) of the most favoured nations.

The trade shall be perfectly free in the said territories, subject to the above- mentioned duty, and to no other. The French shall be at liberty to buy and sell from whomsoever and to whomsoever they choose; but they shall not trade in the articles of ivory and gum copal on that part of the East Coast of Africa from the port of Tangate, situated in 5i degrees of south latitude, to the port of Culva, lying in 9 degrees south of the equator, both ports inclusive. But if the English or Americans, or any other Christian nation, should carry on this trade, the French shall, in like manner, be at liberty to do so. A rticle XIT, If any disputes should arise in the dominions of the Sultan of Muskat as to the value of goods which shall be imported by French merchants, and on which the duty of five per cent, is to be levied, the Custom-master, or other person acting on the part of the Sultan of Muskat, shall, when practicable, receive one-twentieth part of the goods, and the merchant shall then be subject to no further demand on account of customs on the remaining goods, in any part of the dominions of the Sultan of Muskat to which he may transport them. But if the Custom : master should object to levy the duty in the manner aforesaid, by taking one-twentieth part ol the goods, or if the goods should not admit of being so divided, then the point in dispute shall be referred to two competent persons, one chosen by the Custom-master, and the other by the merchant, who shall make a valuation of the goods *, and if they shall difler in opinion, they shall appoint an arbitrator, whose decision shall be final, and the duty shall be levied according to the value thus established. A rticle XIII. It shall not be lawful for any French merchant to expose his goods for sale for the space of three days after the arrival of such goods, unless the Custom-master and the merchant shall -have agreed as to the value of such goods. If the Custom-master shall not within three days have accepted one of the two modes proposed for ascertaining the value of the goods, the authorities on the part of the Sultan of Muskat, on an intimation being made to them on the subject, shall compel the Custom- master to choose one of the two modes for the levy of the duty. A rticle XIV. If it shall happen that either the King of the French or the Sultan of270 TREATY BETWEEN MUSK AT AND FRANCE.

Should a vessel under the Frencli flag enter a port in the dominions of the Sultan of Muskat in distress, the local authorities at such port shall afford all necessary aid to enable the vessel to refit, and to prose cute her voyage ; and if any such vessel should be wrecked on the coasts of the dominions of the Sifltan of Muskat, the authorities on the part of the Sultan of Muskat shall render all the assistance in their power to recover and deliver over to the owner, or the Consul, the pro perty that may be saved from such wreck. The same assistance and protection shall be afforded to vessels of the dominions of the Sultan of Muskat, and property saved therefrom under similar circumstances, in the ports and on the coasts of the French dominions.

H. THE IMAUM OP MUSKAT,) IN H. M.'S SHIP IMOGENE, IN THE MONTHS OF JANUARY AND FEBRUARY 1834. by CAPTAIN H. HART. y royal navy. Submitted to Government on the IXth April 1834. 35 iNOTES OF A VISIT TO ZANZIBAR. I left Bombay on the 15th January 1834, in H. M.'s ship Imogene, and arrived at Zanzibar, after a passage of fifteen days, on the evening of the 30th of the same month. We came to anchor off the Imanm's palace, alongside of the Liver pool, seventy-four guns, His Highness' flag-ship, carrying a red flag at the main. This is not the usual place of anchorage, and only made use of by the Imaum's men-of-war, in consequence of its being immediately opposite the palace, which stands on the beach, about a quarter of a mile from the ship. We found at this anchorage, besides the Liverpool, two frigates, two corvettes, and a brig. Information relative to the number, force, tonnage, state, age, and condition of His Highness' squadron is given in an annexed statement. At the anchorage off the town of Zanzibar, which is about five miles from this, there were laying one English merchant brig, one American merchant ship and two brigs, with several small craft of the country. Before we had anchored. His Highness sent off a Captain of one of lus frigates to welcome us on our arrival, and to express His Highness great pleasure on seeing an English man-of-war. I thanked him or his attention, and said I was sorry it was after sunset, as I could not salute His Highness until early the next morning, when I would do so with twenty-one guns. He said they knew our custom TC ry well, ami that the flag-ship was ready to return our salute ^ enev ' He now went on shore, and I begged him to state to H ' s H 'S h ' es » that I was sent to pay respects to him, and to inquire after his health, and that I had also despatches, which I would deliver at any ime Highness would do me the honour to receive me. The next morning, at daylight, we fired a royal salute, which was taken np y e ship immediately after our last gun, and m the same time, so i appeared a continuation of the same salute; and this exac nes returning a salute they observed in all subsequent firing, tacing i at our last gun. At 9 o'clock the Captain returned, bringing wit present, which he said His Highness had sent for the Captain, consisVISIT TO ZANZIBAR. 275 ing of two bullocks and vegetables, with a quantity of fruit, sufficient for a dessert for the whole crew after they had devoured one of the bullocks for dinner. He also brought a message to say that His High ness would receive me whenever most convenient to myself. I mentioned 10 o'clock, and at that hour went on shore. His Highness, with his officers, received me at the steps of the veranda in the most courteous and kind manner, coming up to shake hands, and, pointing out the way I was to go, followed me to a long room, at the head of which he placed me on his right. We conversed through his interpreter, Captain Hassan, of His Highness' Navy, who, though an Arab, was educated at Bombay, reads and writes English well, and is His High ness' confidential servant. Captain Hassan is a very pleasant, mi Id, gentlemanly man, and very partial to the English ; has been much at Calcutta, Bombay, and various parts of India, and is appointed by His Highness as Agent to the English ; and it is through him alone that any thing can be done. After many inquiries after my health, and hopes that I had not snffered by the voyage, he commenced by saying how pleased he was 1o see an English ship, and when he heard her fire a gun he was delighted, as he was sure she must be a man-of-war. He always considers the English as his best friends, and was happy to see them at all times, and, whenever in his power, to show them every possible attention. I told him the friendship was mutual ; that the English had a great regard for him and his subjects, and we were glad to show our sincerity whenever we had an opportunity, and that in saying this I was only speaking the sentiments of my country towards him.. We played at compliments for some time in a very pleasant, good- humoured manner, when the interpreter said ' that His Highness was more pleased than ever from the beginning to the end, and requested I would ask for everything I wanted.' This was a good opportunity to change the subject, and I then stated that the ship required to be supplied with beef, vegetables, wood, and water, &amp;c. His Highness ordered the boats off immediately, and they brought off a quantity of water in the course of the afternoon. As this was our first interview, I could not very well introduce what I wished: we therefore spoke about the ships of his squadron. I admired the Liverpool, a very fine ship of seventy-four guns, and told him she was very like the Melville. He said she was English, and all they said or did was good. I told him we had on board the Inlogene guns on a new construction, and if he would do me the honour of visiting the ship, I should be glad to show them. This he was quite ready to do, and Monday was fixed to be the day. Having gone through the ceremony of drinking coffee and sherbet, I took my leave, and went on board. The next day I went to introduce the officers to His Highness, who was happy to see them.276 VISIT TO ZANZIBAR. receiving us at the door; and we were shown into the same room as yesterday, and served with coffee and sherbet, His Highness and the young princes (his two sons) shaking hands in the most good -humoured manner with all who offered to do so. When this was over, he told the interpreter to take a chair near him, **###* The Imogene, in compliment to His Highness, had been dressed in colours since eight in the morning; and at the appointed time all the boats attended to escort His Highness on board, he coming off in the barge, which hoisted his red flag, the other boats attending, and forming in two lines. He was received with a royal salute, and the officers in full uniform, and was attended on board by two of his sons, the governor (who is his uncle), and several officers. From the quarter deck we went to the cabin, when they all took seats, and sat for some time, Refreshments were offered, but it being their great fast of Rarazan, none were accepted. His Highness began by thanking me for ray great kindness and attention,—that he could not sufficiently express all he felt, but that it came from his ' inside, and from the bottom of his heart.' As the Liverpool was laying close under our stern, our attention was called to her. I admired her very much, and repeated that I was struck with her great likeness to the Melville. He said she was a very fine ship, and built by the English, and that nothing would please him so much as for the English to have her,—that if they would accept of Jier he should be very happy. I thanked him, and told him I would faithfully report his munificent offer to my Admiral. He said,—' That is what I wish ; and to the Admiralty, and to the King. She is in very good condition, but is too large for the service of Muskat; and if the King of England will accept of her, it will make me very happy. I will send* her to Bombay, or, if you like, will give her to you here.' We then went round the ship, and returned to the cabin for a short time, when he took his leave, apparently highly pleased, and left with every expression of thanks and gratitude. He proceeded to the shore under a royal salute, the boats attending in the same manner as they brought him off. , The next day I went on shore to see the Imaum. * * * * As I was going away, he said he wished above all things to have an English person always with him : there was a house quite ready, and he wished some one would come and live in it, and he would be guided by him. I now took leave, and went on board. The next day I went to receive my despatches, and take my leave. This was our last interview I now received His Highness' despatches, and after many expressions ^ This vessel was subsequently sent by His Highness as a present to His late Majesty King William IV. Out of compliment to His Highness, her name has been changed to The Imaum, and she now belongs to the British Navy.— Editor.VISIT TO ZANZIBAR. 277 of the pleasure he had experienced in having an English man-of-war with him, and his great attachment to the English nation, he shook my hand in the most friendly manner, wishing me every success and hap piness. He then attended me to the steps on the beach, where I bowed and took my leave, and sailed the next morning. The Imaum is said by his interpreter to be at the present period (February 1834) forty-four years of age, but he appears to be more. He is a tall, stout, and noble-looking man, with a benevolent countenance, clear, intelligent, sharp-eyed, and remarkably pleasant and agreeable in conversation. He is greatly attached to the English, and everything that is English, and appeared to have a pride in telling me 'all his saddles were made in England.' He was wounded some years since when in a joint expedition with the English ; and appears to wish to be considered as an Englishman in everything. The English, he says, he looks upon as his brothers, and will willingly give them his country. He married the grand-daughter of the king of Persia, but in consequence of a quarrel between His Highness and the King of Persia about the English, he lost his wife, and she is now detained in Persia. He has three sons : the eldest, twenty-one years of age, is now in charge of Muskat, and the other two are with him at Zanzibar. When His Highness visited this island last year, the eldest son was then left at Muskat, but some disturbance taking place. His Highness was obliged to return. He has now been here about two months, and it is understood that if things remain quiet at Muskat he will remain here for a year or two longer. His Highness has lately been endeavouring to form an alliance with the Queen of Madagascar, by offering his hand, and sent an Am bassador to the Court of Tananareiro for that purpose. This Ambas sador returned last December, and met the Imaum at Samoo, on his way down from Muskat. His Highness had long been expecting these tender documents, and, cruel as love-letters always are, he found, contrary to all expectation, that they were written in English,—not only the letter from the Queen, but also those from her Ministers. His Highness had no one who could translate these letters, for although his Ambassador could speak English, yet he could not read it, and His Highness was obliged to have recourse to an English brig laying in the roads, the Master of which, as good luck would have it, being- able to read. This Master was therefore employed to read the royal Queen's tender letter to the Ambassador, whilst he translated it to the anxious ear of his royal master. And thus it was that His Highness became acquainted with the reply to his royal love from the Madagascar Queen. The solemnity observed upon the occasion can better be imagined than I describe : fortunately for the nautical reader, there was no love or state secret imposed, or the good-natured man might have278 VISIT TO ZANZIBAR. had to lament his learning, by finding himself doomed to have had his head severed from his body, that he might tell no tales. The Queen said she had been made happy by hearing from one who had long been in friendship with her father, and she hoped always to hear of his welfare, and wished he could pay a visit to Tananareiro : in case he did not do so, she should be very much obliged if he would have the kindness to send her a coral necklace of a thousand dollars, and she would order the money to be paid whenever it was landed. She hoped th.eir friendship would increase, and that opportunities would offer for their becoming better acquainted. The Ministers were also glad to hear of His Highness, and wished much that he would come and show himself, or send some of his men- of-war, which should have every attention paid them. They could not offer the Queen, because by their law it was contrary for her to marry, but there was a young princess which he might have. As for the men, he might have as many as he pleased, and he had only to give them a musket. This was the substance of the two letters. His Highness was disappointed that there was not more said about love in the Queen s letter; but the Master of the brig consoled him by saying ' she had said as much as she could say in a first letter.' The people of Mada gascar appear to be his great allies, and have been some time in corre spondence with him respecting a force of two thousand men, which His Highness is to have to go against the people of Mombassa, who are now in a state of revolt. The Imaum told me that the Mombassa people were in this state of rebellion, and asked, if he were to send to Madagascar and get troops, whether the English would like it ? I told him the English would not interfere between him and his subjects, and that he could act as he pleased to subdue a rebellion in his own dominions; but he repeated, ' Will they like it ? ' That I could not tell. I asked him why he did not send one of his ships, which would blow them out of the water. He said he had done so, but they all ran aw r ay, and returned in his absence ; it was no use, unless he had troops to follow them. It appears he did some time since go to Mombassa with four or five thousand Arabs, who got fever and sickly, and most of them died ; besides an Arab will not fight; whilst these Malambo people from Madagascar are said to be good soldiers, and desperate fellows. His Highness' frigate Piedmontese is going to Madagascar in about a month. Tananareiro, the capital of the island of Madagascar, where the Queen resides, and where she has lately had built, by English archi tects, two beautiful palaces, is said to be very populous, and there are established in it fifty English schools, chiefly by the Missionaiies. They have about five or six thousand troops, which are trained andVISIT TO ZANZIBAR. 279 exercised after the military tactics of England, and are dressed in the English manner, and many of their officers are English. They always keep this number in training, but they can double or treble the number whenever they please. They are said to be good and excellent fighting soldiers. A Frenchman has established a manufactory there for making muskets, and has written to offer his services to the Imaum (who has de clined, saying he can buy muskets cheaper than he could make them) ; and there is an Englishman who has established a powder manu factory. One of the principal ports is Majunga, in Bambatooka Bay, in the .north-western part of the island, where a whole fleet may lay in six or seven fathoms, sheltered from all winds. Bullocks are plentiful at this place, and very cheap. About eight years since the Americans carried on a most lucrative trade from this port, in buying bullocks at two dol lars a head, which they killed on the spot, and salted the meat, and also the hides, and took the hoofs and horns, and, the latter selling for the original price of the bullocks, left the meat for clear profit, which they sold for an enormous price at the Havannah, when they had lost their supplies from South America. His Highness the Imaum's whole revenue is stated to be about 250,000 dollars a year; that is 150,000 from Zanzibar, and 100,000 from Muskat. This revenue appears very small when compared to his fleet and establishment. However, he is said to be very rich, arising from trade, and by property coming to him at the death of his servants, who are expected to leave him their riches. He has a squadron of one line-of-battle ship, three frigates, two corvettes, and a brig, which appears to constitute his great pleasure and amusement ; and he has now given an order to the English brig to bring out naval stores to the amount of 30,000 dollars. When on board, he conducts everything himself; gets her under weigh, shifts her berth, or brings her to anchor, by giving every word of command. He is said to have twenty merchant ships of different kinds, but I could not learn where or how they were employed: there was only one of that description at Zanzibar, and she was going to the Mauritius, to endeavour to get an engineer for the steam-engine she brought thence last year. The island of Zanzibar is in lat. 6° 6' S., and long. 39° 9' E. Its climate is said by the Americans, who have been here two years, not to be unhealthy or disagreeable, except for a week or two at the change of the monsoon, when there are rains and heavy squalls, but after that, the weather is settled, and water smooth ; it is now, from the north erly winds occasionally, for part of the day rough for boats, which renders it bad for landing on the open beach.VISIT TO ZANZIBAR. His Highness the Imaum possesses absolute power, and his word is law. He has lately built a palace at Zanzibar, and is giving every encouragement to trade, and improving the island, by planting clove trees and sugarcane, which thrive in a remarkable manner. It has been supposed that His Highness will, on some future day, make this his chief residence, in preference to Muskat. The only places on the coast of any consequence, subject to his power, are Mombassa and Samoo; the former is at present in a state of revolt, and he has a frigate block ading the port. It produces little more than a few cloves, and a small quantity of sugar, but both these plantations are in their infancy. The interior is said to be well cultivated, and extremely populous. Bullocks do not appear to be plentiful, but there are abundance on Pamba, the neigh bouring island, which also produces a great quantity of rice, and has a good harbour ; but the cattle of the latter will not live at Zanzibar. O ' Fruit and vegetables were in great quantities. It has within itself little or no trade. That to Bombay consists in the export of a little gum and ivory, brought from the main, with a few cloves, the only produce of the island ; and the import trade is chiefly dates, and cloth from Muskat to make turbans. These things are sent in small country vessels, which make only one voyage a year; the trade is consequently very trifling. The revenue is chiefly received from ships, which come here to trade upon the coast, and which are mostly Americans. These ships have great difficulty in collecting a cargo, and their plan is to touch upon different parts of the coast, and leave one or two of their crew behind, with an interpreter, whilst they visit some other parts, or come to Zanzibar, which is the great mart and rendezvous. Out of thirteen ships which touched here last year (between January 1833 and January 1834) only four were English, all the rest Americans. The two American brigs now here are trading on the coast, but it is very common for the South Sea whalers to come for refreshments, of which description the ship now here is one. I w T as surprised to hear this, and could scarcely believe that a South Sea whaler came here for refreshments, and that to be her only object. However I found it truly so, and that he had actually caught between two and three hundred barrels of oil almost between Zanzibar and the next island of Pamba, and this the day after he had spoken an English whaler, who had been on the ground some time, and, after speaking the American, bore away to the Seychelles for refreshments. Of the tw T o American biigs an their trade, one belongs to Old Salem, and other to New York, and bot on their second voyage. The former has both voyages brought dollars to purchase a cargo; the latter, the first voyage, brought out goo s which did not answer, and made a bad trip; he has now dollars, antVISIT TO ZANZIBAR. 281 does not appear to have met with much better success, expecting to be here two or three months collecting a freight. Their return cargoes consist almost totally of copal and gum ; but since the Englishman has been here, and they have seen him buying ivory, they have commenced doing the same. The English brig is a great annoyance to them : it is hoi fii^t voyage to this coast, and she brought out a cargo of goods, the whole of which she has disposed of, and is now about to return with a full cargo of copal, gum, ivory, and drugs, with a little gold dust and tortoiseshell. The latter, the Master gave me to understand, the Ame ricans knew nothing about, and that he expected to clear for his owners 170 per cent. The Americans and this man (who is a clever, industrious, active, close-handed fellow, and understands perfectly what he is about) are upon perfect good terms with each other, though it is evident they are very jealous of him, and it is only his extreme good humour that prevents their quarrelling. Copal, gum, and ivory are the only return cargoes ; they are therefore all looking out for the same thin sr. O This trade has been known only to one. or two houses in America: the Americans now here said there were not ten people in their country who knew where Zanzibar was, or ever heard of it. Last year the Imaum sent a letter by one of these American Captains, to be published m America, inviting the citizens of the United States to come and trade ; but the owners said—-'No, Mr. Waters (the Master of the Old Salem brig) ; if we allow this to be published, everybody will hear of the place, and we shall lose our trade.' The Englishman is certainly a great favourite with the Imaum, and he has already given him orders to the amount of 30,000 dollars, chiefly for naval stores, to be brought out next year, and has been endeavouring to persuade this man to bring out his family, and live at Zanzibar. There was no possibility of ascertaining any actual account of the number of the inhabitants at Zanzibar; some said there were 50,000, and others 200,000 : a gentleman who had been there some time told me he always found the same unsatisfactory answer, but there was no doubt that the island was full of inhabitants. There is no European settled here, nor in any part of His Highness' dominions. The revenue of the island of Zanzibar is said to be 150,000 dollars yearly. Previous to His Highness' visit last year, he only received about 30,000 or 40,000 dollars. The Imaum has only about two or three hundred troops, which he brought from Muskat, but there appear to be a great number of police armed with spears. The only place on the island of Zanzibar where there are any »uns 30I ' 282 VISIT TO ZANZIBAR. is at Ihe foot of a white round tower, which stands near the custom house, on the point of the town,—it cannot well be called a castle. It consists of a square fort or prison, with four walls, and a small tower in each corner; the guns, eight or nine in number, are out of condition, and outside of the tower close to the beach : a jolly boat would take it, or knock it down. It is said His Highness intends to build a new fort. In concluding this statement of my proceedings, I feel it my duty to state that His Highness the Imaum, during our stay at Zanzibar, con tinued to send off' daily a bullock, with vegetables, and fruit sufficient for the officers and ship's company, and completed us with wood and water, for which His Highness would not receive any payment. The morning before our departure, his interpreter came to say that His Highness had 8,000 dollars, which he wished to send to Bombay, and he would pay me the freight. After the generous manner in which we had been treated, and the munificent offer of a seventy-four to His Majesty, I thought I should ill represent my king, or the generosity of my country, by receiving freight on so small a sum; I therefore, in return, declined payment, and received the 8,000 dollars, without freight, to be landed at Bombay.

Their plan is to keep but few men on board, and when the squadron is wanted for service to send to Muskat for crews which generally consist of half Arabs and half Lascars. His Highness finding the Liverpool of seventy-four guns (a very fine ship, and in good condition), too large for the service of Muskat, has offered her as a present to His Majesty.

Submitted to Government on the 1st July 1854.286 PERSIAN GULF. I have the honour to submit the information called for by Government on the 17th February 1854, regarding the principal estates within my political control. No mention is therein made of the ports on the Persian Coast between Bushire and Bunder Abbas given below, because, being situated within the territorial limits of Persia, their inhabitants acknowledge a direct allegiance to the Shah, and, contributing to the general revenue of the country, are more or less influenced in their condition, and in the condition of their chiefs, by the administration of the provincial functionaries within whose districts they are included.

It should be observed, however, that beyond the exaction of an annual tribute, the control really exercised over them by the latter is of a very limited character; and being, as they are, at least east of Con- goon, composed of Arab Tribes, cognate with those on the opposite shores of the Gulf, whence they originally migrated, the general remarks apply equally to them as to the latter. Their means of existence are derived from fishing, a participation in the coasting andMUSKAT. 287 carrying trade of the Gulf, and the cultivation of the date tree, and of grain, to the scanty extent to which the barren nature of their soil admits. A few of their boats proceed annually to Zanzibar, and they engage more or less extensively in the pearl fishery. Of these Arab settlements on the Persian Coast, Lingah is by far the most thriving and important. The advantages it possesses as a free port, and the mild and equitable rule of its chief, lately deceased, have attracted thither, during the past fifteen years, a large accession of population, including many wealthy merchants, principally natives of Bahrein, who have been driven from their homes by domestic troubles; but its increasing magnitude and prosperity have of late attracted the attention of the Persian authorities, and the measures taken by them to extort additional tribute, if persisted in, may soon cause it to relapse into its former insignificance.

These States are independent, but acknowledge the feudal supremacy of the Wahabee ruler whenever his own power, or their dissensions, may place him in a position to exercise it. Tiieir duels are expected 1o afford military aid in his expeditions, and to furnish supplies to his troops when present, as in the case of the garrison at Lrymec in Oman. The territorial possessions of the Maritime States are confined to the inhabited spots on the sea coast, and may be said to he bounded by the walls of their towns, and by the date groves in their immediate vicinity. Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, the Joasmee Chief, holds also some territory on the Batinah Coast, such as Khore I 1 ukaun and Dub- ba. which he wrested from the Imanm during the contest between His Highness and the Sohar branch of his family, when he supported the cause of the latter. The maritime tribes are each of them closely related to nomade tribes in the interior, over whom the chiefs of the former exercise a limited control. The character of the Coast of Arabia, from the mouths of the Euphra tes to the range of mountains in Oman which joins the sea a little below Ras-ool-Khyma, is low, sandy, and barren. Water is everywhere more or less brackish. The Desert passes close up to the walls of the towns, and, beyond the scanty date plantations, tho produce of which is altoge ther inadequate to the supply of the inhabitants, precludes cultivation. The maritime tribes are dependent for their subsistence upon the pearl and common fisheries. They engage, also, extensively in the coasting trade of the Gulf, and in the carrying trade to India and Zan zibar. Nothing is known of the interior of the country, with the exception of Kowcit, and the bay of Kateef, sheltered by reefs. This coast possesses no harbours, and forms a lee-shore to the pie\ailin 0 north-west winds. The towns are all built on the banks of deep creeks or backwaters, into which the larger boats can enter only v&gt; hen unlade The heat during summer is excessive. From the lowness of the country, the average fall ol rain is small, an probably does not exceed from four to six inches in the year.SHAIKHS OF OMAN. 293 NAMES OF THE SHAIKHS OF OMAN; THEIR TERRITORIES, POPULATION, AND REVENUES ; as existing in the year 1854.

The members of the ruling family are thrifty and inoffensive, and engage themselves principally in trade, and in the navigation ol their vessels. V/v p The political condition of Koweit varies from that of the other Maritime States, in that the inhabitants acknowledge the sovereignty of the Ottoman Porte, and use the Turkish flag, though their allegiance to the Sultan is merely nominal. Their Shaikh, on the contrary, receives an annual allowance of dates, stated at 200 karrahs (small), value about 4,000 crowns, from the Pasha of Bussora, as the condition of protecting that port from foreign aggression whenever his aid may be required. Koweit possesses a safe and capacious harbour. The number of men capable of bearing arms is said to amount to 6,000 ; the population o the town to 22,000. The estimated gross annual revenue amounts to 22,000 crowns, derived from contributions, and a small tax levied at the gate, on gooc. carried into the country, or brought into the town.38 CONCLUDING REMARKS. 297 CONCLUDING REMARKS. The prevailing religion of the tribes alluded to in the foregoing paper is that of the Soonee branch of Mahomedans, comprehending, however, some sects differing more or less in their tenets, such as the Wahabees in the interior, and on the Coast of Nujd ; the Byazee at Muskat; Malikees at Koweit and Bahrein. At Bahrein, and in smaller numbers at Muskat, where Sheeas compose a part of the population, they live in a state of compaiative degradation ; at the former place the treatment of them is frequently oppressive. The language throughout is Arabic. The government of the Arab Tribes being patriarchal, justice is administeied by the chiefs, whose decisions are much influenced by public opinion,—more especially in capital or aggravated offences. Sentence is passed by the Kazee, or principal ecclesiastical authority, whose decrees are founded on the Koran, and the traditions of the Prophet and his companions. The election of the Kazee is seldom formal or arbitrary, but rests upon the general recognition of the individual's superior learning, sanctity, and knowledge of the law. Fine, imprisonment, and, less commonly, castigation, are the punish ments awarded for minor offences, at the discretion of the chiefs. Adultery, which is extremely rare ; manslaughter, and other serious crimes, are specially provided for by the Koran, of which the injunc tions are usually enforced. Education is confined to reading and writing, as taught by Moollas in the mosques, or at their own houses, and even to this extent by no means general. Unless immediately on the coast, vaccination and its benefits are unknown, and probably unheard of. One or two instances have come to my knowledge of applications being made to the surgeons of our vessels of war, when lying off the Arabian ports, for vaccine lymph. So great is the dread of small-pox, and so extensive are its ravages in the region referred to, that, were the means afforded, there can I dc no doubt that vaccination would be speedily universally adopted. Fevers prevail more or less throughout the Arabian Coast, and at Bahrein and Muskat, especially, are of a deadly character. At these places, also, when cholera is present, the disease assumes its most vmi ent type. Small-pox, as above remarked, is everywhere generallyHISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE JOASMEE TRIBE OF ARABS FROM THE YEAR 1747 TO THE YEAR 1819. PREPARED BY MR. FRANCIS WARDEN, MEMBER OP COUXCIL AT BOMBAY.

T he Joasmees are a race of Arabs descended from the inhabitants of Nujd, and named Beni Nasir, as being on the left hand side of the Caaba; and called also Beni Gafree. They have possessed the princi- pality of Seer, in Oman, and been an independent tribe, from the earliest ages. Their territory on the line of coast of that province extends from Musseldom to Zobara, or the island of Shargah, to the northward. That part of Oman contains many tribes, the Shahee, Zoheree, Joasmee, Beni Kuttub, and Beni Naeem, &amp;c. The Beni Naeem was for many years the head tribe, but the disturbances that followed the death of Nadir Shah having compelled Moolla Ali Shah * the Governor of Ormus, Gom- A.

The Kasimees, or, as we shall hereafter call them, the Joasmees, retained the vessels occasionally sent for them, and being well paid for their assistance, and having opportunities of procuring arms, they soon acquired an ascendancy among their own tribes, and were enab e -to take possession of the town of Kishm, and of Luft, and of Linga an Shinas on the Persian main, and were exten a. d . 1765. their conquests over all Moolla Ali s posses sions, when their career was checked by Shaikh Abdoolla bin who retook Ormus and Bunder Abbas from Moolla Hussein, and Kisnm and Luft from 'the Joasmees.

They destroyed two Persian gallivats off Gombroon, and a magazine which the Persian troops had formed at Lingah. 4. In 1775 the Imaum of Muskat was at war with Shaikh Rashid, a d who had become very powerful by land ; the Shaikh captured some Bushire craft, under the plea that their cargo belonged to Muskat. 5. Shaikh Rashid retiring from public life, resigned the Shaikhdom to his son Shaikh Suggur, who, marrying one of Shaikh Abdoolla's daughters, all differences between them were settled. 6. The Joasmees now appeared as traders, and, in a very few years, by their activity, carried on a most profitable concern ; but, adds Captain Seton, their rash and treacherous disposition was constantly showing itself, and leading to petty wars and quarrels, both among themselves and their neighbours. 7. The Ras-ool-Khyma fleet, in consequence of the decline of the a d 177s '9 Persian ascendancy in the Gulf, being constantly on the cruise, roused almost every petty chief to fit out armed boats, manned by lawless crews, under no control, but who depended solely on plunder for their maintenance, which they indiscriminately practised. This state of affairs arose out of the war between Ras-ool-Khyma and Mnskat. 8. The internal state of Persia being unsettled, the war with Ras-ool-Khyma continued; Shaikh Abdoolla ofOrmus was at variance with Karrack ; the Shaikh of A1 Haram with the Jamia people; and the Uttoobees of Zobara and Grane with the Chaab. 9. Shaikh Suggur next appears endeavouring to negotiate a peace between the Persians and Uttoobees, who had plundered and taken Bahrein ; but failing in his efforts, he joined Shaikh Nassir of Bushire in an expedition for the recovery of the island, the Joasmee Shaikh having taken part against the Uttoobees, in consequence of their having captured a boat of his, and murdered eighteen of her crew. These attempts for reducing Bahrein were repeatedly made, and not abandoned until 1785. 10. The Joasmees appear not to have taken any part in the disputes , &gt;Tri/ , which occurred between the Montific Arabs and A. d. 1785 to 17%. • m i • u ^ the iurlash Government, nor is any mention made of the Joasmees for a number of years. The Gulf enjoyed, also, every degree of tranquillity in 1793, 1794, 1795, and 1796.302 11. JOASMEES.. A. D. 1797-98. In 1797 the first capture was made by the Joasmees of a British vessel. The Bassein Snow, under British co lours, and charged with public despatches, was taken on the 18th of May, off Ramse, by a fleet of Dows belonging to Ras-ool -Khyma : she was, however, released by the Shaikh two days after. 12. In October following, the Viper cruiser was attacked by the Joasmees, whilst at anchor in Bushire Roads. The Joasmee Dows had arrived about six days before the Viper, under the command of Shaikh Saleh, Chief of the Beni Joasmee Arabs, and nephew to the Joasmee Shaikh, who were at war with the Imaum of Muskat. Their object was to intercept the Sooree Arabs, who were at Bussora. On the day the Viper arrived, Shaikh Saleh had an interview with the Resident at Bushire, when, after the strongest professions of friendship, he stated what his views were, and begged that we would not protect the Sooree Dows, nor ship any British property on board ; but if we did, he promised that it should be held sacred. After these professions. Shaikh Saleh requested a supply of balls and powder from the Viper, which having been furnished, he treacherously attacked the cruiser, but was beaten off. 13. The Resident at Bussora remonstrated against both these acts : they were met on the part of Shaikh Suggur by professions of regard for the English, contending, in respect to the attack of the Viper, that the cruiser had fired first on the Dows. He stated that Shaikh Saleh left Ras-ool-Khyma, separated himself from the tribe, had proceeded to the Persian shore, and there established himself among the Beni Khalid Arabs, marrying a woman of that tribe, which was one of a villanous nature and character; that since the commencement of hostilities between the Joasmees and people of Oman, Shaikh Saleh had acted independently of Ras-ool-Khyma, committing depredations according to his inclination ; that the Joasmees had no disputes with the English, and considered the people of Oman alone as their enemies. 14. These disputes arose in consequence of the unsettled state of the Muskat Government on the death of Syud Ahmed, and the usurpa tions of Syud Sultan. He had involved himself in serious disputes with the Arabs of the Gulf, which brought on a war with many of them, who had united against him ; and the Bombay Government conceived that those acts of aggression experienced by British vessels had been from Arabs in the interest of the deposed Prince of Oman. 15. At the close of the year 1798, the Imaum of Muskat was threatening Bussora, on account of some ancient claims he possessed against the Pasha of Bagdad. In order to enable him the more effectu ally to execute his hostile intentions, Syud Saeed negotiated a peaceJOASMEES. 303 with his formidable enemies the Joasmees, They desisted from these hostile intentions through the interposition of the Resident at Bnssora. 16. The Joasmees do not appear to have co-operated with the a. d . 1802-03. Imaum in his attack on Bahrein ; nor do we hear anything more of them until 1802, when the attention of the Tmaum was directed to the formation of an alliance with the Joasmees, which failed its object probably was to assist in the attack on Zobara and Bahrein. Shaikh Suggur dying in 1803, was succeeded by his son. Shaikh Sultan. 17. The Joasmees must have been kept in check by the progress of the Wahabees, who had by the month of May 1802 reduced to nominal submission the whole coast from Bussora to Dubba, which included their territory. They appear, however, towards the close of 1804, to have been in alliance with the Uttoobees, since it was in an engage ment with these two tribes that Syud Sultan, the Imaum, lost, his life. 18. We may now date the period when the Joasmees may be said to have engaged in piratical depredations. Up to the close of 1804, they committed no act of piracy ; but, with the exception of the attack on the Bassein Snow, and Viper cruiser, manifested every respect to the British flag. 19. The influence of the Wahabecs having been introduced over the A D 1805 principality of Seer, and the Government of Muskat having, on the death of Syud Sultan, also fallen under the control of that power, the characters of the different tribes in the Gulf underwent a material change, and the attention of the British Government was directed to check the spirit of piracy which at this period began to display itself. 20. The contentions for the succession, between the members of the Muskat family, threw the Gulf into a state of great confusion : the Joasmees captured two vessels (the Shannon and Trimmer), belonging to Mr. Manisty, with public despatches, and treated the commanders with great severity and cruelty ; and a fleet of forty sail surrounded and fired into the Mornington cruiser, but a broadside or two com pelled them to sheer off. They were co-operating, also, with Moolla Hussein of Kishm, with whom they were allied, against Bunder Abbas and Minao ; whilst Beder, the successful competitor for the Imaum- ship, was projecting a plan (notwithstanding the support he was receiv- ing from the Wahabees) with the Uttoobees, to destroy the Joasmees, who were at this time in subjection to Abdool Azeez. 21. Syud Beder, on the adjustment of the disputes with Syud Ghes of Sohar, proceeded with a land and sea force for the recovery of Bunder Abbas, Minao, and Ormus, which he effected. Operations were at this time actively prosecuted by the British against theJOASMEES. Joasmees, in conjunction with the Government of Muskat. The com&lt; bined forces proceeded to Kishm, where they blockaded a Joasmee fleet, which were reduced to such distress as to solicit a peace. Cap tain Seton agreed to grant them a truce until the pleasure of Govern- ment should be known ; explaining, as his reason for not prosecuting hostilities with vigour, the impossibility of doing it without offending either the Persians or the Wahabees. 22. The Joasmees, according to their engagements, restored the Trimmer, the Shannon having been previously given up, after having been completely stripped. 23 In the month of October an Agent arrived at Muskat from Moolla Hussein, deputed by the Joasmees to negotiate a peace for them. The instructions of the Bombay Government having been applied for. Captain Seton was informed, that in the event of its becom- ing a party to the peace, it should not be of a limited nature, but extend generally to the whole Gulf, and every other place and situation, and he was to require full indemnification for the losses we had sustained, 24. Captain Seton, finding it impracticable to obey the orders of the Government to obtain the required indemnification, without having recourse to hostilities, which would have involved us in a general warfare with the whole Gulf, judged it advisable to enter into the agreement with the Joasmees dated the 6th of February 1806, the whole bulk of whom he represented as desirous of returning to their former mercantile pursuits. This agreement* does not appear to have! been negotiated with the consent, or even with the knowledge, of thej Wahabee Shaikh. 25. The Joasmees continued true to their engagements in every point. that regarded the British ; but they co-operated a. d. 180/. in t ^ e f 0 u 0w j n g year with Syud Beder, the Imaum, in an attack on Syud Ghes, who had refused to become a party to the peace, which he could not in honour do until he had revenged the blood of Syud Sultan. 26. Precluded by the Treaty of 1806 from carrrying on their cruises in the Gulf, and urged by the Wahabees, the a. d. 1808. Joasmees extended them to India. In the month of April 1808 they made their first appearance as pirates in the Indian Seas, on the coast to the northward of Bombay. The Wahabee Shaikh had long contemplated the extension of piratical cruises to India The Joasmees had by a late order of the Wahabee been rendere independent of their lawful Shaikh, Sultan, who had at this period nothing left but Ras-ool-Khyma. Ramse, Shargah, and other places sent out their boats without his permission. Gadeef, an * A copy of which will be fouiul at page of this Selection.JO ASM EES. 305 Arab Chieftain of the Joasmee Tribe, on the Persian main, was als-o averse to piracy; but his subjects, cut off from trade on account of the general disrepute of their tribe, sought a livelihood in the vessels of a. d . 1808-0.9 others. These piracies (as stated by Captain kSeton) u can only be considered as a general one at the instigation of the A!\ r ahabees.' In one cruise in this year they captured twenty country boats, which so elated them that they determined on sending a fleet of fifty towards Sind and Kutch. 27. On the 20th of October they committed a breach of the Treaty of 1806, by attacking and capturing the Sylph cruiser, in the Gulf of Persia. She was re-taken by H. M.'s frigate Nereid, which was in sight when the Joasmees boarded the cruiser. 28. In the following year, the Wahabees directed the Joasmees and A ^ jg^ the Uttoobees to proceed against Grane. The latter excused themselves, but the former offered to go if they were supported by ships. 29. The Persians from Lar attacked the Joasmees at Lingah, and the town of Karrack, and compelled them to retire to Basside, in the island of Kishm, The Joasmees were however successful against a fleet fitted out by Mahomed Nubhee Khan against Khor Hassan, which twenty-two Joasmee boats encountered, beat, and took six of the Bushire vessels. 30. The Wahabee Chief having appointed Hussein bin Ali, a Joasmee, and who was the Shaikh of Ramse, his vicegerent in the Seer principality, vested him with authority over Has-ool-Khyma, and nominated Wahabee officers throughout the Joasmee country. Shaikh Sultan, the Joasmee Chief, having been invited to Deriah, proceeded to that capital, and was detained and imprisoned by the Wahabee Chief. He contrived to escape from prison, and finding his way to Yemen, embarked at Mocha, and, proceeding to Muskat, made overtures to the Imaum, besought His Highness' protection, disclaiming all countenance to, or concurrence in, the attack of the Sylph, and professing on this occasion a desire to conform to the Treaty of 1806. The Imaum took him to Shargah, and placed him over the Joasmce Tribes at that place, Shaikh Sultan occasionally living at Lingah. 81. The British Government, determining to relieve the Imaum from the power of the Wahabees, and to suppress these piracies, an expedi tion proceeded to the Gulf under the instructions dated the 7th of September 1809. Their first operations were directed against Ras-ool- Khyma. The attack commenced by a bombardment during the 12th of November. On the following day, the Joasmees were vigorously attacked by sea and land : after a bloody but ineffectual resistance, they were driven into the interior of the country. The town, with the 39306 JOASMEES. vessels in port, amounting to upwards of fifty, with the English prize ship the Minerva, were burnt. 32. The Shaikh of Ras-ool-Khyma, in the most insulting manner, had the audacity to demand a tribute from the Government to allow British ships to navigate the Persian Gulf in safety. 33. From Ras-ool-Khyma the armament proceeded to Lingah, where twenty Dows were destroyed, the inhabitants abandoning the town on the approach of our ships. Finding no vessels int he ports of Congoon, Bunder Mullim, and Homeram, the armament proceeded to Luft, situated on the north side of the island of Kishm. The town was soon taken possession of by our troops, but the unexpected stiength of the fort, and the desperation with which it was defended, frustrated every attempt to carry it by storm. All the essential objects of the attack were however fully attained ; their boats and Dows were completely destroyed. The bombardment having continued, Moolla Hussein surrendered the place, together with property to the amount of two lakhs of rupees, belonging to the Imaum, which, with the fort, were delivered in trust for the Imaum to Shaikh Dervish, the head of the Beni Naeem, a tribe of Arabs who have always been firmly attached to His Highness. 34. On the reduction of Luft, the armament proceeded to Muskat. The commanders of the expedition expressed their readiness to co-operate with His Highness in the recovery of any other of his ports. He proposed to accompany the armament with a considerable force to the attack of Shinas and Khore Fukaun. 35. The joint forces arrived at Shinas on the 31st of December, which was summoned on the following day. a. d . 1810. Ag thig hac j no e flp ectj it was bombarded. The situation of the fort, however, being too distant to be reduced by these means, the troops were landed. Shinas was defended with the most determined and heroic bravery. After an obstinate and sanguinary resistance, the fort was surrendered, and made over to the Oman troops, but was so much demolished that the Imaum did not think it prudent to keep possession of it. 36. The Imaum having expressed some hesitation on the policy of attacking Khore Fukaun, from apprehending a similar obstinate resist ance to that made at Shinas, which would render it untenable by His Highness' troops, the object was abandoned, there being no British interest connected with it, as there were no pirate vessels belonging to the port. 37. The commanders were unable to form a treaty with Ras-ool- Khyma, Shaikh Sultan, their chief, having been seized by the Wahabees, and their Government completely overthrown ; independently of which, no treaty could be binding on the Joasmees without the direct authorityJOASMEES. 307 9.nd. participation of Saood5 011 which tribe they were entirely depend ent ; but the commanders observed,—such had been the impression of our operations against the principal pirate ports, that they succeeded in their demand to destroy all the Bows and large boats of the petty chieftains from Ramse to Abookeyle, on the Arabian side, as well as Mogoo, on the Coast of Persia. The Chief of Charrak, not having any Dows or large boats, was admonished to refrain from giving encourage ment or piotection to future pirates. A similar message was sent to the Chief of Nakheeloo, with a demand, at the request of the Imaum, for the release of Shaikh Jubara of Congoon, the friend of the English. It was not deemed mateiial to insist on the destruction of Tromkeys and small boats,—a measure that would have been hard on the poorest of the inha bitants, and created an odium against the British name which did not generally exist, many of the small villages on both sides of the Gulf having been compelled to join in piratical pursuits. 38. As the Uttoobees had never committed any depredations against our trade, even at times when the Joasmees were enriching themselves by their frequent captures of British vessels, the commanders deter mined on not attacking Khor Hassan. 39. It was the prevalent opinion in the Gulf, founded on the result of this expedition, that the Joastnees had been rendered quite inca' pable of committing any further depredations by sea. The Resident at Bussora confirmed this opinion ; but added,—'such was the revengeful and vindictive spirit of the Wahabee Tribe, and of the inhabitants on the Aiabian side of the Gulf under the jurisdiction and authority of Shaikh Saood, that they will attempt to wreak their vengeance on any defenceless British vessels which they may meet. At all events, such people are not to be trusted, and Mr. Manisty recommended a prohibi tion being imposed on the exportation of timber from the ports of India either to those of the Red Sea or the Persian Gulf, even including Muskat; from which place the pirates will by some means or other contrive to procure it. Their countries do not produce any kind of timber proper for ship or boat-building ; if therefore the pirates be deprived by the regulations of the British Government of their ordinary supply of teak, they cannot long possess a naval force of any import ance.' 40. The pirates reappeared in the beginning of 1812, and in the A . d. 1812. following year destroyed several large Dows and Buggalows belonging to the ports of Bussora and Congoon. Boats navigating under British colours did not escape depredations, whilst others were detained at Porebunder, and prevented from prosecuting their mercantile pursuits.308 JOASMEES. 41. In the following year the Imaum prepared an expedition against the port of Ras-ool-Khyraa, for the purpose a. d. 1813. re j nstat i n g Uie Joasmee Chief in his government, Shaikh Sultan promising that if His Highness would restore him to his hereditary possessions and consequence he would ever consider himself as a vassal of the Imaum and his allies, and would never again, or his tribe, commit piracies. The Imaum requested that Mr. Bruce, who was at Muskat, would accompany him to witness the treaty which he should enter into with Sultan bin Suggur, and for the purpose also of negotiating a treaty with the Joasmee Chief on the part of the British Government, which, as observed by the Imaum, would have more effect in keeping him to the performance of his engagements than anything else, as Sultan bin Suggur was now aware of our determination not to allow the slightest insult to pass unnoticed. 42. As the renewal of the treaty entered into by the Joasmee Chief with Captain Seton in 1806 was deemed essential for restraining the piratical acts of his subjects, Mr. Bruce was instructed to adopt the necessary measures accordingly, and to contract similar engagements with the other chieftains in the Gulf. 43. This expedition failed, and a second one, equipped in 1814, for a similar purpose, terminated in a peace, con- a. d. 1814. eluded between the Irnaum of Muskat and the Joasmees, to which Shaikh Suggur was compelled to become a party. He agreed, it is said, to His Highness possessing Ras-ool-Khyma, and to his being established at Shargah. 44 M!r. Bruce, on the 7th of August, forwarded a lettei fiom Shaikh Suggur, communicating the capture of the ship Ahmed Shah by the Shaikh of Charrak, and requested good offices in favour of an Agent he was deputing to the Prince at Shiraz, on business of importance. In transmitting that letter, Mr. Bruce remarked that the Joasmee Chief, who was residing at Lingah, was much attached to the British Govern ment. The only further account we have of this mission is contained in a letter from the Broker at Muskat, dated the /th of November, stating that the King of Persia had sent an honorary dress for Sultan bin Susreur, to obtain his co-operation with Persia in the reduction of Bahrein. 45. In consequence of some depredations committed on the trade, remonstrances were transmitted to the Chiefs of the W'ahabees and the Joasmees, on the impropriety of their proceedings. A reply was re turned from Hussein bin Rahmah, the Chief of Ras -ool-Khyma, stating that he was not aware that any vessels bearing the British pass and colours had been captured by the Joasmees, but that if it should prove to be the case, such property as might be forthcoming would be restored, but thatJOASMEES. 309 in future he would issue instructions to his tribe not to molest or come near any ship or vessel under British colours ; nor did they wish to inteirupt the British trade in any way. As he was proceeding to Deiiah, Hussein bin Rahmah took Mr. Bruce's messenger with him, to obtain a reply to the letter to the Wahabee Chief. 46. The messenger returned with another letter from Shaikh Hussein bin Rahmah, in which, though he acknowledges that his cruisers had visited the northern ports of India, yet denied that they had knowingly molested any vessels navigating under British pass and colours, and repeating his assurances of a desire not to molest the British trade. At the suggestion of Mr. Bruce, the passes were ordered to be written in the Arabic language also, to prevent the Joasmees pleading ignorance of any pass being on board. 47. On the 2nd of October a Vukeel, named Hussein bin Mahomed bin Gaith, arrived at Bushire, with letters from the Wahabee Chief, and Hussein bin Rahmah ; the former disapproving of the conduct of that chief, and of his tribe, and binding himself to compel the latter to deliver up such property as we could prove them to have captured ; who, on the other hand, denied having captured any British property,' expiessing a hope that we would not be too severe in scrutinizing the past. The Vukeel was authorised to enter into an engagement with Mr. Bruce. He stated that the Joasmees were anxious to be on the best terms with the British Government, whose good will they would study hereafter to merit ; that they would respect our flag and subjects ; but that they hoped we would not insist on their leaving off cruising against those States who were at enmity with them ; as, according to the law of nations among the Arabs, blood could only be repaid^by blood ; that if they did not follow this kind of warfare, they would lose their rank amongst the Arab Slates, and that their enemies would come to their very homes to attack them; that they were, moreover, compelled by the Wahabee Chief to wage war against the Mahomedan States of the Gulf, to bring them under the yoke and religion of the Wahabees ; and only to respect the British flag and subjects, to whom they were directed to be attentive, and to cultivate their alliance; that if we would guarantee, on their leaving off this mode of proceed ing, that none of the Arab States would molest them or their vessels, and would guarantee also their safety against the vengeance of the W ahabee Chief for not obeying his commands, they would then abandon the course of life they were pursuing; but otherwise their natural situation in the Gulf was such that they were compelled to be enemies to the greater portion of it. 48. Mr. Bruce confirmed the truth of Hussein bin Gaith's state ment regarding their peculiar situation, and the system among the310 JO ASM EES. Arabs; as also in respect to the tenets of their religion, so different from the other Mahomedan sects, which rendered them the enemies of all other Islam sects, and these to be their enemies; and deemed it advisable to enter into a few preliminary articles of agreement with Hussein bin Gaith, renouncing all claims, and passing an act of oblivion on the past, on the conditions specified in the engagement. The Joasmee Chief having resolved to depute an Agent to Bombay, Mr. Bruce was induced to conclude the preliminary agreement in ques tion. 49. Some boats bearing the British pass and colours having been taken off Porebunder in the month of August a. d . 1815. 1814, Mr. Bruce, conformably to orders to remonstrate against that act, despatched a boat to Ras-ool-Khyma, with letters to Hussein bin Rahmah and to his Vukeel, who had entered into the preliminary engagement above specified, of a friendly tenor, and with a letter also to Sultan bin Suggur of Lingah. 50. To Mr. Bruce's astonishment, the Nakhoda returned in a few days after his departure in a most wretched plight, and almost starved to death. The Chief of Lingah, to which island the boat first proceeded, took 80 frazils of dates out of her, and seemed disposed to keep the boat itself; but on anchoring off the town of Ras-ool-Khyma, a boat put off the shore, came alongside, and inquired what vessel it was. On being informed, they greeted them on their arrival, and recommended them to get under weigh, and stand in for their greater security, and offered to pilot Mr. Bruce's boat in ; on which the Nakhoda weighed, being towed in by the Joasmee boats. Shortly after, about twenty armed men came out of the latter, drew their sabres, and immediately drove the Nakhoda and part of the crew, who were in the leading boat, overboard. Those in the other, seeing, this, cut the tow rope, and pulled away, taking up those who had jumped over, and reached Bushirc. 51. The capture of this boat, which had been despatched on the faith of engagements so very recently made, and which had actually arrived at the very door of their dwellings, proved the little reliance that could be placed in any treaty with such lawless banditti. The act was at variance, also, with the conduct which so strongly characterises the Arabs, who fulfil the obligations of hospitality even towards an enemy seeking their protection, and reposing in their conhdence. This flagrant breach of faith sufficiently proved a determination on the part of the Joasmees of attacking all vessels, of whatever description they might be, or under any colours. 52. This attack was followed by the capture by the Joasmees of a Buggalow belonging to the Imaum of Muskat, whilst at anchor in theJOASMEES. 311 roads of Mo goo. # She was laden with horses for the remount of the 17th dragoons, and with sulphur on account of the British. Six boats were moreover captured off the coasts of Kurachee and Sind. 53. The success that attended the subsequent cruises undertaken by the Joasmees added so much to their strength, that it induced most of the other ports on the coast, from Cape Nabend to the southward, to follow the same system. The Shaikh of Charrak in parti- cular was encouraged to form a connection with Ras -ool -Khyma, and Abdoolla bin Ahmed of Bahrein openly avowed his determination of prosecuting piracy, as the surest mode of acquiring wealth and streno-th. 54. The Joasmees engaged and defeated the Imaum's fleet, and had very nearly taken the Caroline frigate, of thirty-two guns. 55. A vessel belonging to Bombay, sailing under a British pass and colours, was this year captured off Muskat, the greater part of her crew put to death, and a ransom exacted for the release of the remainder. 56. The audacity of the pirates increased to such a degree that they a. d . 1816. attacked the Aurora cruiser, and chased and fired at the American ship Persia, and Cintra schooner; and so great was the dread entertained of the Joasmees that Lieutenant Bruce could not obtain a boat to despatch to Has-ool-Khyma, to convey a letter of remonstrance to the chief in regard to these depre dations. 57. Three vessels belonging to the port of Surat were taken in the Arabian Gulf, sailing under British pass and colours, and many of their crew murdered. The loss of property by this capture was estimated at ten lakhs of rupees. 58. Many other captures were made of vessels sailing under our protection, attended by similar acts of atrocity ; and at length most indisputable proof was afforded of the faithlessness of their promises to respect the British flag and pass, by the capture of the Company's armed boat the Turrarow. o9. The measures of the Government were limited to remonstrances, and to the disposal of the cruisers for the protection of the trade, until the exigencies of the public service in other quarters should admit of an expedition being detached against the pirates. 60. A deputation was sent to Ras-ool-Khyma to obtain redress for the capture of the vessels in the Arabian Gulf, which failed. The oasmees exphciUy and boldly declared 'that they would respect the sect of Christians, and their property, but none other ; they did not consider any part of Western India as ours besides Bombay and Man- ga oie , t mt i we interfered in favour of the Hindoos and other of th^BuggatoVLkgTerT 6 ^ del&gt;reihtio '' «&lt;' ^ given information■ '■ I / 1 f 312 JOASMEKS. 1817. a. d. 1818. unbelievers of India, we might take all India, and Muskat also, when nothing would be left for them to plunder.' 61. A small squadron of Joasmee boats landed in the month of October in Busheab, and burnt and plundered the villages at the western part of the island, carrying off all the cattle, and killing great numbers of the inhabitants. 62. At the close of the year we find them in the harbour of Aseeloo, whichthey had entered, and taken five large laden Buggalows, valued at three lakhs of rupees, and had murdered their crews. The inhabitants of Bushire were thrown into the greatest consternation from the Joasmees contemplating an attack on that place. The Governor of Bushire with great difficulty restrained the inhabitants from leaving it, and retiring further into the interior. 63. The Joasmee fleet remained twelve days at Aseeloo, and thence proceeded to Congoon, but finding the place prepared to receive them, they weighed, and, standing to the northward, anchored off Daire, where they landed and destroyed a number of date trees. They were repulsed, however, in an action with the inhabitants, and obliged to take to their boats. 64. Apprehending an attack by the Turkish troops, the Joasmee Chief sent a number of people from Ras-ool- Khyma to build a fort at Bassadore, on the west end of the island of Kishm, which they intended to garrison, as a place of security for their property, should they not succeed in repelling the Turkish troops. Bassadore has a harbour well secured for vessels, and cannot be approached but by boats of light draught. It was formerly in possession of the Portuguese, who built several large reservoirs for water, and a large town with fortifications all round, now nearly destroyed, and a fine pier jutting into the sea, which, with the reservoirs, are in very good repair. This port, if possessed by the Joasmees, would from its situation be a source of greater annoyance to the tiade going up and down the Gulf than Ras-ool -Khyma has proved. A letter has lately been received from Hussein bin Rahmah, referring to a treaty of peace concluded between ' his Imaum' and us, and professing a desire of continuing on terms of friendship with the English Government; which of course has been positively declined : and by the last accounts from the Gulf it would appear that the Imaum of Muskat was preparing an expedition against Ras-ool-Khyma, in con junction with Shaikh Sultan and the Beniyas Tribe of Arabs. a. d. 1819.JOASMEES. 313 CONTINUATION OF THE FOREGOING SKETCH, TO THE YEAR 1831, BY LIEUTENANT S. HENNELL. Mr. Warden's notices of the Joasmee Tribe are brought down to the L D 1819 ^ ear ' anc * conc l u de by stating that, alarmed at the rapid success of Ibrahim Pasha over the Wahabee power, and apprehending that after the reduction of Kateef the next operations of the Turkish General would be directed against Ras-ool-Khyma, the Joasmees contemplated forsaking that town, and forming a settlement and building a fort on JBassadore (the western extremity of the island of Kishm). Information of this intention having been received in India, orders were given to the commander of the British naval squadron in the Persian Gulf to prevent their carrying it into effect. It appears, also, that Hussein bin Rahmah, the Chief of Ras-ool-Khyma, probably alarmed by the reports of an expedition preparing in Bombay for the Gulf of Persia, made a proposal, about the commencement of the year, to continue on terms of friendship with the British Government, which was declined without hesitation. Mr- Warden likewise alludes to the Imaum having in contemplation an expedition against the Joasmee capital, in conjunction with Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, and Shaikh Tahnoon bin Shakboot. In the month of October 1819 an expedition, which had been con templated for some time, but which various causes had operated to delay, was prepared in Bombay, for the purpose of completely crushing the lawless and sanguinary proceedings of the Joasmees. This force consisted of 3,069 men under arms, viz. 1 company of artillery ; H. M.'s 47th regiment; H. M.'s 65th regiment; 1st battalion 2nd regiment Native infantry ; the flank companies of the 1st battalion 3rd regiment Native infantry; and those of the Marine Battalion ; together with half a company of pioneers; making a total of 1,645 European, and 1,424 Native soldiers, under the command of Major General Sir William Grant Keir. The naval part of the expedition (which was composed of H. M.'s ships Liverpool, Eden, Curlew, and the vessels of the Honorable Company's Marine^ was placed under the orders of Captain Collier, C.B. A short time previous to the sailing of the expedition, a communication was made by the Governor of Bombay to His Royal Highness the Prince of Shiraz, explanatory of the objects in equipping so large a military and naval force ; and after intimating that no course of proceed ing would be adopted inconsistent with the friendly relations so long established between the two Governments, expressed an earnest wish 40314 JOASMEES. that His Royal Highness would co-operate in the measures to be carried on against Lingah, Mogoo, Tawoonee, and Charrak, as those places had completely identified themselves with the Joasmees. A letter was likewise addressed to His Highness the Imaum of Muskat, nearly to the same purport as the above, and intimating that Dr. Jukes and a commissariat officer had been sent on in advance to make arrangements for the co-operation of His Highness, and the provisioning troops after their arrival at Kishm, where they were to rendezvous. The expedition at last sailed from Bombay on the 4th November, the commanding officer proceeding on board the Liverpool to Muskat, which place he reached on the 13th, while the remainder of the convoy proceeded on to Kishm. His Highness the Imaum on this occasion agreed to furnish 4,000 men to act by land against Ras-ool-Khyma, and three vessels of war to join the naval force. After the troops had been refreshed at Kishm, the expedition proceed ed over to Ras-ool-Khyma, which was immediately invested, and bat tered in breach. After an active resistance of six days, the town was taken possession of by the British force on the 9th December, the enemy evacuating it on one side as the troops entered on the other. Hussein bin Rahmah and Guzeeb bin Ahmed, the Chiefs, together with their followers, who composed the garrison, surrendered at discretion. The effect of this success was soon shown by many of the most power ful and independent chieftains on the coast sending an unqualified offer of submission to the British General. On the 8th January 1820 a General Treaty* of Peace was concluded, in Ras-ool-Khyma, between Major General Keir, a. d. 1820. Government, and nearly all the Chiefs of the Maritime Arabs in the Gulf of Persia, by whom it was subsequently signed at different times and places. The sole pur pose and scope of this treaty was the entire suppression of piracy, and the adoption of such measures of precaution and general co-operation as seemed best adapted to attain the object in view. A separate Treatyf was concluded with Hussein bin AlUhe same day, stipulating for the surrender of all his vessels (excepting the fishing- boats), the release of all Indian prisoners, and the occupation of the towns of Ras -ool-Khyma and Maharra by the British Government. A similar Treaty^ was likewise entered into with Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, of Shargah, for the surrender of the towers, guns, and vessels of Shargah, Ejman, Amulgavine, and their dependencies; stipulating, how ever, that the British troops were not to enter the towns, or lay them waste. a short time after these arrangements had been made, General Keir * Vide pages 76 to 80 of this Selection. t Vide pages 81 and 82 of ditto. % Vide pages 80 and 81 of ditto.JOASMEES. 315 returned to Bombay, leaving a garrison in Ras-ool-Khyma, consisting of twenty artillerymen, and the 1st battalion 2nd regiment Native infantry, under the command of Captain Thomson, of H. M.'s 17th dragoons. In April of the same year, the Government resolved to remove the detach ment from Ras-ool-Khyma to Kishm, and orders were accordingly transmitted to Captain -Thomson to evacuate the former place, after dismantling the sea defences, and giving up the town to Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur. On a communication, however, being made to this chief, he positively refused to take possession, if the works were destroyed. A reference was consequently made to India, when final orders were issued for the defences to be destroyed, and the town abandoned, which directions were carried into effect on the 18th July 1820. In the commencement of 1823 Shaikh Sultan began the erection of a a d 1823 ^ 0rt at but was informed that he must suspend the work until the instructions of the Government respecting it could be received. An application from the inhabitants of Ras-ool-Khyma to be allowed to erect a wall across the isthmus was likewise referred to'the Government, which intimated, in its reply, that it was not intended to prevent the erection of forts or buildings on the Arabian Coast, as the treaty concluded by Sir W. G. Keir did not appear to authorise any such interference. About this time the Shaikh of Ramse (one of the Joasmee ports) was deposed, through the influence of Sultan bin Suggur, and succeeded by Mahomed Abdool Rahman, the son of a former Shaikh, who had been removed by Hussein bin Ali. Shaikh Guzeeb bin Ahmed, of Jazirat-ool-Ham- rah (another of the Joasmee ports), having died the same year, was suc ceeded by Shaikh Mahzem bin Abdool Rahman. All the Joasmee ports, with the exception of Ejman, appear to have acknowledged the general supremacy of Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, but Rashid bin Humeed, the chief of that place, complained very earnestly to the Resident at Bushire of the aggressions committed upon him by Shaikh Sultan, and declared he would never submit to his authority. In February 1823, on the occasion of Captain Macleod paying a visit to the Joasmee Shaikh, he produced a paper, signed by the chiefs in the vicinity of Ras-ool-Khyma, admitting their dependence upon him, and he expressed himself very anxious that his rights as a feudal superior should be recognised by the British Government. In reply, he was informed the Government had nothing to do with his disputes for supremacy, and must look to every individual chief to answer for those immediatlly subject to him. Captain Macleod, in reporting upon this tribe, stated as follows :—' The Joasmees procure all their materials for building, as well as their warlike stores, from Muskat, Bahrein, and the Persian ports in the lower part of the Gulf. In the construction of their vessels, they use no other wood than Indian teak,316 JOASMEES. and, in respect to arms, those principally of Persian manufacture. They possess no articles of export, since their pearls are generally purchased by merchants on the spot, and the produce of their country is not even sufficient for their maintenance. Their only employment is fishing, diving for pearls, and importing dates, grain, and other necessa ries of life, which they purchase with the price of their pearls. Their dates are chiefly brought from Bahrein and Bussora; grain and cloth from Muskat and the Persian ports. They are very poor, and perhaps can never find much employment in commerce, unless in carrying for others , although it is said they at one time pursued a very extensive trade.' About the end of 1823, an inhabitant of Shargah, named Hassoom, armed a boat, and sent her to cruise in the neighbourhood of Cape Jask. She however returned without making any prizes, and was imme diately seized by Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, who, after instituting an in quiry into the affair, liberated the owner, on the plea of want of evidence. The first undoubted instance of piracy committed by the Joasmees, subsequent to the conclusion of the treaty, ap- a. d . 1824. pears to have taken p lace i n the beginning of 1824, when two boats from Shargah fell in with and captured a Bug- galow belonging to the Mehra Tribe, near Socotra, on which occasion they are said to have put every one on board to the sword, and then sailed for Zanzibar. That Sultan bin Suggur was fully acquainted with the purpose of the boats in question is evident, from his making a com- munication soon after their departure to the senior officer of the marine, intimating their having sailed on a piratical expedition, and regretting his want of means to pursue them. In June 1824, these two boats returned to the Gulf, one of them having the audacity to touch at Muskat on her way up, and only escaped being detained by produc ing a passport from the Captain of H. M.'s ship Minerva. Finding, however, that orders had been issued for their seizure whenever they made their appearance in the Persian Gulf, they did not ven ture to return to Shargah, but one of the vessels in question was subsequently found abandoned at Charrak, and having been taken possession of by a cruiser, was to have been sent over to Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, to be identified, but owing to its dilapidated state, was obliged to be broken up. The other boat took refuge at Muttra, where it remained unmolested for several months ; and under the particular circumstances of the case no further steps were taken by the Government regarding it. The Wahabees having about this time obtained considerable success over the Turks, Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, in concert with Shaikh Raahid bin Humeed (who had lately acknowledged his supremacy), opened a negotiation with that sect. This measure he did not attemptJOASMEES. 317 to conceal, but assigned self-preservation as his only motive for adopting it. The Shaikh of A1 Hamra, Mahomed bin Mahzem, having given umbrage to the Joasmee Chief, was removed by him from the government of that place, and Ahmed bin Abdoolla bin Ooseyah estab lished in his room. A dispute having arisen between His Highness the Imaum and Shaikh Sultan binSuggur, on the subject of the occupation of the towers of a place on the frontiers of His Highness' territory, called Brymee, which had by a solemn treaty been previously declared neutral. His Highness' cause was taken up by his dependent, Shaikh Tahnoon of Aboothabee. Independently of this chief threatening Shargah, some aggressions were committed on the boats of that place by the Sooedan Tribe, under Salmin bin Nassir, which had separated itself from the Joasmees, and taken refuge in Debaye, between which place and Shargah they were erecting a fort, called Derah, a proceeding which drew down strong remonstrances from Sultan bin Suggur. The general peace and tranquillity of the Gulf appearing likely to be endangered if this dispute remained unsettled, the Resident (having previously had an interview with His Highness the Imaum upon the subject), proceeded to Shargah in December 1824, and there, by his mediation, a reconcilia tion was effected, upon the conditions that on the side of the Joasmee Chief the towers of Brymee should be destroyed, while a similar measure should be carried into effect in respect to the fort of Derah on the part of Shaikh Tahnoon, who was to assign some other part of his dominions for the residence of the Soodan Tribe. Shaikh Sultan, however, took no steps to fulfil his part of the agree- a. d . 1825. ment, and in February 1825 the Resident was under the necessity of addressing a very strong remonstrance upon the extraordinary hesitation shown by him in carry- ing into effect the very first article of the treaty. Shaikh Sultan, how ever, in reply, threw all the blame of the delay which had taken place upon the Imaum's Agent at Brymee, who had persuaded his (Sultan's) man to disobey his orders ; and further, in proof of his sincerity, offered to send a person in company with a messenger from Syud Saeed, and one from the Resident, to execute the conditions of the engagement entered into. A short time before the Huzah, the Governor of Debaye, and a kind of Agent of the Muskat Government, died, and was succeed ed by his young son Mahomed, whose sister Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur had obtained in marriage. By means of this connexion, the Joasmee Chief acquired a very considerable degree of influence in Debaye, and was secretly intriguing to get possession of it, as its position and vicinity to Shargah rendered the place, when under the authority of an enemy peculiarly obnoxious to him.318 JOASMEES. In May 1825, the Resident having occasion to proceed to Muskat, availed himself of the opportunity to endeavour to effect the fulfilment of the article in the treaty mediated by him between Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur and Shaikh Tahnoon, relative to the demolition of the towers at Brymee. Accordingly, having obtained full authority from Shaikh Saltan for their destruction, he determined to send Goolab, the British Agent at Muskat, along with His Highness the Imaum s tioops, to see the above stipulation executed. Before, however, the result of his mission could be known. Shaikh Sultan violated the truce, by suddenly attacking Derah. Reinforcements were immediately sent by Tahnoon to the relief of that place, but being intercepted by the Joasmee Chief, they were compelled to retreat, with ^the loss of a hundred and fifty men. This proceeding of course put an end to any further attempt at media tion on the part of the British authority, who, however, considered it necessary to take every precaution to prevent the war from degenerating into indiscriminate plunder; and for this purpose he directed two vessels of war to be kept constantly cruising on the pearl banks. On the return of Goolab Anundas from the mission mentioned above, he represented that all Sultan bin Suggur's representations relative to the obstacles thrown in the way of the demolition of the towers of Brymee by the Imaum's Agent were totally false, and that the delay which had taken place had been produced solely by his own intrigues. The irregularities which were apprehended as likely to arise from the naval warfare between the two most powerful Arab Chiefs of the Gulf made their appearance shortly after the commencement of hostilities. A boat from Bahrein was attacked by some Shargah cruising vessels near the island of Anjar, without any provocation, and dollars to a considerable amount forcibly carried off, besides three or four of the crew being put to death. In consequence of this piracy, it was deemed necessary by the British authorities to adopt active measures, in order to check the piratical disposition thus manifesting itself, as well as to give confidence to the neutral tribes, who had become greatly alarmed at the lawless spirit which had appeared. Accordingly, instructions were issued, in August 1825, to the Commodore of the Marine, to proceed over to Shargah, and demand full satisfaction or t e loss of both life and property from Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, and in the event of this not being acceded to, to remove the British Agent from Shargah, and capture all vessels belonging to that place. This decisive proceeding was attended by the most favourable results ; the Joasmee Chief, terrified at the firm line of conduct adopted by the Britis authority, lost no time in affording every redress to the Chiel o Bahrein, who, in a letter to the Resident, expicssed himse entir y satisfied with the arrangement made. The successful termination oJOASMEES. 319 this business created a sensation throughout the Gulf highly credit, able to our Government, and tended greatly to establish a favourable impression of the efficacy of the general treaty. Exhausted by continual and fruitless warfare, and their exclnslon from the pearl fishery mconsequence, both Shaikh Sultan bin Sug&lt;.ur and Shaikh Tahnoon gladly availed themselves of the conciliatory offers made by the Imaum of Muskat, and a speedy adjustment of all differences took place under his mediation in October 1825, upon the conditmns of the demolition of Derah, the removal of the Sooedan Tribe, and the reception of a small body of the Imaum's troops into Debaye, Not a word was said on this occasion about Brymee, and this singular omission, notwithstanding its being in the power of the Imaum o dictate his own terms, would seem to remove the blame of the non- fnlfilment of the stipulation in the former treaty regarding this place frorn Shaikh Sultan to His Highness. In the course of an interview held with the British authority in the Gulf Of Persia, in November 1825, Shaikh Sultan bin Snggur expressed great alarm at the increasing power and intrigues of the Wahabees, and professed himself very anxious to learn whether he might look to the En- hsh for assistance in the event of his endeavouring to maintain his inde- pendence. In reply, he was informed, in general terms, that he was the best judge of his own interests; but that no connection or authority would be received by the British Government as an excuse for any proceedings bearing a predatory character. The Shaikh then adverted to the very difficult dilemma into which he would be cast in the event of the Waha bees attacking the territories of the Imaum, and calling ou him for his sup. port against that prince. To this he was answered, that his forming any connection prejudicial to His Highness would be considered unfriendly by us, and it was in every point of view advisable that he should not adopt that line of conduct. The language held on this occasion was confirmed by the Governor in Council, with a farther intimation, that however improbable it might be that we should act against the Waha. bees so long as they confined their conquests to the shore, it was still not desirable that we should bind ourselves to abstain from interposition, or hold out so great an encouragement to the invasion of-the Imaum's territories as,our avowed indifference would be likely to afford. A boat belonging to Amulgavine having been taken by the followers of the notorious Sooedan bin Zaal (who had settled at Biddah, in the erritones of the Shaikh of Bahrein, on fleeing from Aboothabee), the a mee Chief affected to consider this act as more than balancing the piracy commuted on the Bahrein boat captured by his subjects in 1825, * A body of Arabs, under Salmin bin Nassir, inhabiting Derah.320 JOASMEES. and therefore displayed a determination not to pay the remuneration money, which he had promised through the influence of the British on that occasion. This pretence, however, was not admitted by the authorities in the Gulf. In an interview held with the British Resident in October 1826, Shaikh Sultan complained of the injury his a. d. 1826. subjects were exposed to, in consequence of the proceedings of the Sooedan Tribe under Salmin bin Nassir (who still held possession of Derah, notwithstanding Shaikh Tahnoon having formerly agreed to its demolition), and therefore requested permission to expel the occupants by force of arms. As this measure would have led to an immediate rupture with Shaikh Tahnoon, and involved the Gulf once more in hostilities, he was requested to defer taking any steps of this nature until it was seen whether the Beniyas Chief could be prevailed upon to withdraw his countenance from Salmin bin Nassir. Shaikh Tahnoon, however, obstinately refusing to attend to any recommen dation having for its object the demolition of Derah, a representation was in consequence made to the Imaum, who, indignant at the continued contumacy of the Aboothabee Shaikh, promised to send two vessels of war to co-operate with Sultan bin Suggur's troops against the place above alluded to. Having observed the marked disinclination with which the occur rence of maritime war among the tribes of the Persian Gulf was viewed by the British Government, Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, with his usual acuteness, in a letter to the Government, dated December 1826, revived a number of dormant and unfounded claims against the people of Con- goon, for the seizure of a Buggalow several years before, and also against Bussora, for the imprisonment and detention of the Nakhodas of some of his vessels. At the same time he intimated, that unless the Government made good his losses on this occasion, he required their permission to go to war. The Government, in their reply, dated February 1827, intimated that the Resident in the Persian Gulf would be re- a. d . 1827. quired to report on the subjects of his complaint, but that if he did not consider that justice had been done him, he was at liberty to commence hostilities, provided that it did not degenerate into piracy. The report was soon after made, showing that real facts had been grossly misrepresented by the Shaikh, who, failing his object of inducing the Government to interfere actively in behalt ol his unfounded claims, prudently remained quiet. About March 1827, His Highness the Imaum appeared off Derafi with his fleet, and redeemed his pledge to the British Government, y directing that fort to be demolished. The presence of the Imaum,41 JOASMEES. 321 however, so far from tending to promote the general tranquillity, appears to have occasioned a speedy rupture of the good understanding which had been lately established between Shaikh Sultan and Shaikh Tahnoon, in an interview they had held at Shargah only a few days before. The Joasmee Shaikh, after informing the British authority of the conclusion of peace between himself and the Eeniyas Chief on the 17th March, wrote again, on the 22nd of the same month, stat ing taat he found it quite impassible to maintain any engagement with a person of so faithless a character as his late enemy. Certain it is that, whether as an offering to the offended dignity of Shaikh Tahnoon, which had been sorely touched by the demolition of Derah, or in order to sow dissension between him and the Shaikh of Ras-ool-Khyma, the Imapm presented the former with artillery and warlike stores, and likewise endeavoured to induce the inhabitants of Debaye to acknow ledge his (Tahnoon's) jurisdiction. Encouraged by this support. Shaikh Tahnoon seized the ruler of Debaye by treachery, and afterwards attacked and carried that place by storm. Anxious to avert the great and general distress so invariably occa sioned by the breaking out of hostilities during the pearl fishing season, the British Resident proceeded to the Arabian Coast in June, but on his arrival found that peace had been again concluded between the contending chieftains. In an interview held with Shaikh Sultan, the latter endeavoured in vain to obtain the guarantee of the English to the tieaty between himself and Tahnoon, and likewise entered into a long discussion upon Article IV. of the General Treaty,* which, he maintained, bound the British Government to prevent the Arabs from fighting with each other, A written explanation of the real tenor of this article having been given him by the Resident, he did not touch again upon the subject. About this time some acts of a piratical nature having been commit ted by a person named Udwee (a subject of Rashid bin Humeed), upon two Debaye boats, a remonstrance was made to Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur by the British authority, in consequence of which the above individual, together with one or two of his followers, was placed in confinement, and detained there for a considerable period. As might have been expected, the amicable relations, mentioned above as having been entered into by Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur with the Chief of A boothabee, were very soon interrupted by their mutual jealousy, and the collisions of their Bedouin dependents. In a letter dated No\embei 1827, the Joasmee Shaikh declared war against Tahnoon, and detailed his reasons for so doing to the British authority Notwithstanding this declaration. Shaikh Sultan appears to have given up his intention, and affairs remained in their former situation, * Vide pages 76 to 78 of this Selection.322 JOASMEES. Jn April 1828, Ras-ool-Khyma was visited by the British authority in the Gulf of Persia, who thus speaks of its state IgOg 1 at that time :—' A square tower, of no great strength, has been built on the mound raised by the ruins of the strong outwork destroyed after the siege in 1819. A straight stone wall nearly connects one side of the town with the backwater or harbour, but as Yet there are no defences towards the sea, excepting two old guns. The ruins of the old walls and towers serve as stone quarries, and the town of Ras-ool-Khyma is rapidly increasing. The houses are of stone and chunam, and, although small, are carefully built, and remarkably neat, even with some finish. Building is yet very cheap, from the old mate rials being so close at hand ; and Shaikh Sultan is said to encourage it.' About this time, when a profound peace had happily extended itself over every part of the Persian Gulf, the commercial inhabitants were thrown into considerable alarm, in consequence of a very daring and atrocious piracy being committed by a man named Mooslim bin Rashid (an inhabitant of Ras -ool-Khyma), upon a boat from Sohar, on the Coast of Batinah. This vessel, after being plundered of cargo to the value of three or four thousand rupees, and the whole of her crew, fourteen in number, being tied to a grapnel), and thrown overboard, was scuttled, and sunk. The pirate Buteel, after selling portions of the plunder, was met off Lingah by a Buggalow which Shaikh Sultan (alarmed at the probable consequences of this infamous proceeding, and the strong remonstrance addressed to him) had sent in pursuit. A sharp action ensued, which terminated by the Buteel being run on shore at Lingah, and Mooslim bin Rashid, together with the greater part of his crew, made prisoners, and carried off to Ras-ool-Khyma. Shortly afterwards, Shaikh Sultan having assembled the heads of tribes, laid the affair before them, and at the same time mentioned his fears of being brought to a severe reckoning by the British Government. In consequence, it was unanimously resolved that Mooslim bin Rashid should be put to death ; he was accordingly taken out of his prison during the night by four of Shaikh Sultan's slaves, and, having been conveyed to the sea beach, was there strangled, and buried ; declaring, however, with his dying breath, that the piracy had been committed under the knowledge and approbation of the Joasmee Shaikh, who, he further stated, had even given him a document in writing to that effect, w r hich he had lost when his Buteel was captured. The rest of the crew were kept in close confinement for several months; but were subsequently set at liberty with the consent of His Highness the Imaum, to whom the pirate vessel, together with all the plundered cargo recovered, had been given up.JOASMEES. 323 The peace between the Joasmee Chief and Shaikh Tahnoon of A Di jggg Aboothabee, although frequently shaken, was never wholly ruptured, until the commencement of 1829, when Shaikh Sultan again declared war against the latter. 'Whether really irritated against the Imaum for the secret and open assistance which he alleged was furnished by His Highness to Shaikh Tahnoon, or whether he was desirous of taking advantage of the unfortunate position in which Syud Saeed was placed, in consequence of his failure at Bahrein, the Ras-ool-Khyma Shaikh, in a letter to the British authority in the Gulf, intimated an intention of likewise com mencing hostilities against His Highness. He did not, however, think proper to proceed to any overt acts of warfare, and his relations with the Muskat Government gradually resumed their old footing. It being considered by the British Government that the cruising of the ships of war on the pearl banks, as usual during the fishing season, was not unlikely (with reference to the very general state of warfare' in which all the tiibes on the Arabian Coast were engaged) to involve us as principals, or at all events to produce an impression that we did not act up to our declaration touching our non-interference in lawful war, while carried on after the manner of civilized nations, it was resolved to discontinue the practice for that time, and to trust to the monthly visits of our cruisers for the protection of neutral vessels. About the end of May 1829, Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur represented to the British authority in the Persian Gulf, that although he had given due intimation of his intention of blockading Aboothabee, yet he had been given to understand that a vessel carrying an English pass and colours had been hired, by some of the people of Muskat, to convey provisions and warlike stores to the Beniyas capital (Aboothabee), which was suffering in consequence of the scarcity of food. On the arrival of the vessel in question (the merchant ship Sunhwy) off Shargah-, she landed a portion of her cargo, destined for that place, and Was about to proceed on her voyage to Aboothabee, in spite o^ Shaikh Sultan's earnest remonstrances, when an arrangement was made by the agent of the owner, without the knowledge of the Captain, to sell all her cargo to the Joasmee Shaikh. Boats were accordingly sent off, the crews of which boarded the ship in a very insolent manner, and an attempt was made to haul down the British colours, which the Mate resisting, he was struck with some violence by one of the Arabs. Shaikh Sultan, however, on the Captain protesting against such conduct, disavowed the whole of the proceedings, and the opportune arrival of the Amherst sloop-of-war removed all apprehen sions of any further violence. The Joasrnee Chief, to prove the truth of3-24 JO ASM EES. his statement that the insult to the vessel had been offered without his knowledge, directed the first boat that had boarded the Sunbury to be burnt, and the individual who had hauled down the colours to be tied up and flogged. In June 1829, a peace was concluded between Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur and Shaik Tahnoon bin Shakboot, through the mediation of the Chief of Lingah, the principal condition of which was that neither party should interfere in any way with the subjects or dependents of the other. The Imaum of Muskat being on the point of proceeding to his dominions on the African Coast, deemed it prudent to provide for the tranquillity of his Arabian territories by paying an annual sura to each of the Joasmee Chiefs ;—2,000 German crowns a year was the amount fixed for Shaikh Sultan. Notwithstanding this arrangement, the Shaikh was on the point of sending 400 men to assist the sister of Syud Hillal, the Governor of Soweik, in the war which she was carrying on against the Imaum (in consequence of the unjust imprison ment of her brother) ; but the chief men of his tribe, having assembled together, represented the disgraceful nature of such a proceeding so strongly as to induce him to desist for the time. Soon afterwards, he received a communication from the British authority in the Gulf, acquainting him that any hostile steps against His Highness' territories would be viewed as a declaration of war by his Government. In May 1830, the minds of the inhabitants of the Arabian Coast were much agitated, in consequence of the great and ^ D ' 1So() ' unexpected success of Toorkey bin Saood, the Wahabee Chief, over the Beni Khalid Tribe, and the gradual advance of that sect to the southward. To the bulk of the Joasmees, and particularly to Shaikh Rashid bin Humeed of Ejman, and Mahomed bin Rashid of Amulgavine, the prospect of the re-ascendancy of the Wahabee power appears to have given unmixed satisfaction,—the lower orders anticipating a return to their former piratical habits, and the above two chiefs expecting to emancipate themselves from their depen dence upon Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur. This latter personage, how- ever, viewed the successes of Shaikh Toorkey in a very different light, and plainly saw that he could expect nothing but a diminution of influ ence and revenue in consequence. These sentiments he however care fully concealed, and professed himself outwardly as hearty as any one in the cause of Wahabeeism ; but in a letter addressed to the British authority in the Gulf, in July 1830, he expressed his earnest desire to co-operate with the British Government in checking their further pio- gress, and went so far as to declare that he was determined to opposeJO ASM EES. 325 them, even in the event of his not receiving any support. In reply, it was intimated to him that the views of the British Government in these quarters were confined solely to the suppression of piracy, without interfering in the internal affairs of the Arabian States. The fear, however, of any material or immediate alteration in his situation, appears to have been removed soon after from the mind of Shaikh Sultan, in consequence of the Wahabee Chief having refused to furnish JRashid bin Humeed with a body of troops to enable him to obtain the ascendancy in the Joasmee territories, at the same time intimating to him that he should always continue to look upon the Chief of Ras-ool-Khyma and the Imaum as the heads of all the Arabian Tribes in Oman. In the latter part of 1830 and beginning of 1831 Shaikh Sultan was a u 1830-31 busily engaged in negotiating with the Imaum of Muskat, regarding the terras on which he shpuld lend his support against Sohar, as, notwithstanding his having already received half the amount of subsidy, he now refused to move unless either Dubba or Khore Fukaun (places on the Coast of Batinah) were given up to him. This proposal the Imaum rejected at once, and in consequence Shaikh Sultan desisted from the preparations he had begun for the assistance of His Highness. His dependent. Shaikh Rashid bin Humeed of Ejman, however, proceeded to join the Imaum, but on the defeat of the troops of the latter before Sohar, Rashid and his tribe turned their arms against their late allies. On their return to their own country, they found that their flocks had been carried off, and Ejman plundered, by a party of the Beniyas and Monasir, sent by Shaikh Tahnoon. In consequence, both Shaikh Sultan and himself declared war against Aboothabee, and extensive arrangements were made by the former for the blockade of that place'; but finding that their subjects were entirely disinclined to carry on hostilities during the season of the pearl fishing, both parlies requested the mediation of Shaikh Mahomed bin Guzeeb of Lingah, and peace was once more concluded between these unquiet and turbulent spirits. These amicable relations were however soon disturbed by the lawless conduct of Shaikh Sultan's subjects, who, in the month of September, committed a piracy upon two Beniyas pearl boats near Bahrein. On the intelligence of this proceeding reaching Shaikh Tahnoon, he laid an embargo upon fourteen Joasmee vessels which chanced to touch at Aboothabee for provisions. Alarmed at this decisive measure, the Shaikh of Ras-ool-Khyma immediately disavowed the conduct of his people, and after punishing the person who had committed the piracy, he restored the captured boats, with their crews and cargoes, to the326 JOASMEES. owners. Upon this satisfaction being aflorded, Shaikh Tahnoon libe rated the Joasmee vessels, but detained the slaves and pearls belonging to Shargah, as a pledge for the. settlement of debts due to one of his subjects by a former inhabitant of Debaye, but now residing under the protection of Shaikh Sultan, in Shargah. At the present time (December 1831) a correspondence is still carrying on touching the pearls (the slaves having effected their escape to their old masters), but little if any probability appears to exist of the affair being brought to a final and peaceable termination.

In the latter end of December 1831, Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur and his dependent (the Chief of Ejman) declared war against the Beniyas, m consequence of the injury they had received at the hands of the latter while the Ejman Shaikh was engaged in the assistance of the Imaum's forces against Shinas ; or rather, on the contrary, while acting the part of a traitor towards His Highness, and accelerating and completing the defeat of his troops. The good offices and mediation of the Lingah Chief had succeeded in delaying the threatened hostili ties, but depredations having nevertheless been mutually committed at sea by the subjects on either side, negotiations were being carried on for the settlement of the claims arising therefrom, and of others of ancient date, from which most unsatisfactory results were anticipated. Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur having intimated to the Resident his intention of declaring war against the Imaum of Muskat, and of imme- diately commencing hostilities upon his possessions, had, previous to the arrival of the naval force at Muskat, destined for the assistance of the existing Government against the Chiefs of Barka and others, and to the receipt of the Resident's communication, taken advantage of the very disturbed state of the affairs of the Imaum, consequent upon the imprisonment of his. son and nephew by the Chief of Burka, to proceed with a strong force against Khore Fukaun, Khulla, and Dubba, and succeeded, either by surprise or treachery, in obtaining possession of these places, with their surrounding country ; and had been only deterred from attacking Shinas, a place of considerable strength, by the opportune arrival there of two of the Imaum's frigates, with a reinforce ment of men and warlike stores. In the meanwhile his dependent, Shaikh Rashid bin Humeed of Ejman, in direct opposition to the orders of the Joasmee Chief, as it would appear from the latter complaining of his proceedings to the Resident, and recommending the despatch of ships to bring him to order,—committed the most daring and open depredations* upon the trade, not only of Sohar, but of Muskat. * Upwards of twelve boats, with their cargoes, fell into his hands. The origin of these lawless proceedings of the Shaikh of Ejman is to be traced to his conduct on the occasion of the siege of Sohar. Shaikh Tahnoon of Aboothabee, Chief of the Beniyas Tribe, the great rival of the Joasmee Shaikh, Sultan bin Suggur, having been suspected of treachery while acting as the ally of the Imaum of Muskat, on his expedition against Bahrein, found his330 JOASMEES. The defenceless state into which many of the places in the neigh bourhood of Bushire had been thrown, by the ravages of the plague, tended to encourage a return to habits of plunder and piracy, and was taken advantage of by some Joasmees, who, on their return from Bussora, finding that the towns of Bunder Dillum and Bunder Reig had been deserted, plundered them, as likewise a boat returning from Congoon to Bushire. When called upon to afford satisfaction for the outrages committed by the dependents of Shaikh Rashid binHumeed a. d. 1832. o |. ]^j man) Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur distinctly stated, (as he had before done by letter, which referred also to the Shaikh of Amulgavine,) that he no longer possessed any authority over him, nor could either control or be answerable for his proceedings, any participation in which he most positively disavowed. Upon this ex- plicit avowal, therefore, of the virtual independence of Shaikh Rashid, the British authority turned for redress to that chief himself, and a formal demand, backed by the presence of two vessels of war, was accordingly made upon him, for the restoration of such vessels and property, belonging to Muskat, as had been captuied and plundered by his subjects, and twenty-four hours were allowed him to consider the same, or abide by the consequences. The Shaikh at first attempted evasions, upon various grounds : his counter claims upon the people of Bussora, Grane, Amulgavine, Aboothabee, and Sohar ; the discontinuance of late of the payment of the annual allowance, and the non -fulfilment of the promise of a Buggalow made to him by the Imaum ; his being now a subject of the Wahabee Chief, and the necessity, therefore, for a reference to that personage ; the people of Muskat having taken possession of an Ejman Butecl with her cargo, worth 1,500 dollars, &amp;c. ; but was informed, in reply, that being in his own person a member of the General Treaty, he must be held responsible for the acts of his subjects.

As his hostilities against the Chief of Sohar had been proclaimed and acknowledged, no notice was taken of his proceedings in capturing the boats of that place, nor, for the same reasons, of the seizures of Dubba and Khore Fukaun by Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, who now, anticipating with apprehension the chances of reprisals on the part of the Imaum for the loss of those towns, or a declaration of war at his instigation by the Beniyas Chief to whom he was known to have furnished military stores, despatched a Vukeel to the Resident, to learn from him the sentiments and inten tions of the British Government in the event of such taking place * and was, in reply, informed that the British Government had^determined in case of exigency, to afford the Imaum every assistance in their power to preserve his independence, but would not interfere in quarrels involving a minor stake, which His Highness might see fit to prosecute • and consequently that Shaikh Sultan, if unable to effect a reconciliation^ and measures of hostility were pursued against him, would be at liberty to use his own means of defending himself, provided the above reser vations with reference to those means and their ends were duly attended to. In the latter end of November a large fleet of Joasmee boats, contain ing from one thousand to fifteen hundred of the tribe, under the command of Sultan bin Suggur in person, appeared at the head of the Gulf, with d view to affording assistance to Shaikh Nassir, the hereditary Governor df Bushire, who, giving umbrage to the Persian authorities, had been ejected from the town, and had taken to his boats, and commenced a blockade of the port, according to a previous engagement with that person, by which, in addition to certain other considerations, the plunder of the place was to be the reward of a successful attack Previous to their arrival, however, the blockade had been raised and it was evident, from late events, that Shaikh Nassir had no longer any expectation of regaining his inheritance, but was now merely intent upon inflicting injury upon the town and its inhabitants, which must have involved the destruction of a large amount of British property Under these circumstances, and, moreover, the cause of humanity, and the protection of those connected with the British Government, callinn: for the exertion of every endeavour to ward off so great a calamity as that of a band of infuriate plunderers like the Joasmees being let loose in the midst of a peaceable and mercantile community, the Resident 44332 JOASAlEES. Mr. Blane, adopted the strongest arguments with the Joasmee Chief,— indeed threatened to resort to actual force, if he did not abstain from a measure which, as had been explained to the Vukeel above alluded to, on his mentioning the subject, would be contrary to the wishes of the British Government. The fleet accordingly withdrew. One very trifling case only of a piratical nature occurred this year, indicative of the innate spirit of the Joasmees for A - v- 1833. plunder,—a spirit which they found it difficult to restrain even where British property was concerned, and the imme diate infliction of punishment must certainly ensue. One of their boats putting into Korgoo for water, its crew seized and carried off some portion of a tent, lining the building which had been erected on that island for the accommodation of the Resident's establishment, during the prevalence of the plague at Bushire and in its neighbourhood, notwithstanding that they were warned that the same was the property of the British Government. Trifling as was the value of the articles taken, the more wanton and insulting appeared the conduct of the plunderers, and the more urgent the reason for its not being permitted to pass unnoticed. A vessel of war was therefore despatched in quest of the boat, and to demand the surrender of the delinquents. These were found at Mohumrah, and brought to Bushire, together with the stolen property ; but the object having been gained, were immediately freed, in consideration of the Shaikh of that port having begged their forgiveness. After his signal defeat at Khore Suffan (near Aboothabee*), the Joasmee Chief commenced making great preparations for the attack and blockade of the Beniyas capital, and having secured the support of the Shaikh of Lingah, and Rashid bin Humeed of Ejman, the combined fleets sailed from Debaye on the 9th of November. The two Chiefs of Aboothabce had however collected a large force of Bedouins and citizens, and moored with iron chains to the shore six or seven of their largest vessels, well manned, for the protection of their shipping. After a cannonade of three days, which was promptly and effectual y answered by the besieged, Shaikh Sultan 's Buggalow having received two shots in her hull, his whole fleet weighed out of range ot e ouns onshore, and anchoring, confined itself to the maintenance of a close blockade. The besieged were shortly reduced to the greates distress from the want of provisions, and the departure of His t ig me&amp;s the [maum for his African possessions removed all prospect o re ic^ from foreign assistance. Their difficulties were further great y in creased by the capture of thirty of their boats in Khyran Beniyas, am the loss of ten men killed by the people of Debaye (of the secedec * Vide Sketch of the Beniyas, in a subsequent part this Selection.JOASMEES. 333 tribe), who, also acting on the offensive by land, intercepted and carried oil a caravan of fifty camels, laden with dates from Brymee. Pressed by famine, they fitted out three boats,* manned with five hundred men, and secretly despatched them to sea by night. Twenty vessels of the blockading squadron went in pursuit, but unable to come up with them, returned after three days to resume their position off Aboothabee, reinforced by some additional vessels Irom Bussora. - The blockading squadron was not without its difficulties and privations : provisions and water had to be brought from Ras-ool- Khyma and Lingah, and each individual being required to send for his own food, great suffering was experienced. Both parties, therefore, tiring of these protracted hostilities, and dis^ a. d. 1834. posed to come to an arrangement, a peace was easily effected, though the mediation of Ma. homed bin Guzeeb, the Lingah Chief, on the condition that Shaikh Khaleefa bin Shakboot should give up all the boats and property his people had captured since the commencement of the war; and the blockading fleets were withdrawn. The Wahabees were desirous of befriending the Beniyas in this quarrel, but the threats of their representatives at Brymee proved' insufficient to overawe the Joasmee Chief (whereby a decrease of the power of the sect at that time may be argued), and had the effect only of restraining the Bedouins from affording any assistance to Hussein bin Rahmah, who had been despatched into the interior to raise troops for the purpose of cutting off the communication with Aboothabee by land. At the period of the disturbances in the Imaum's dominions, owing a. d. 1835. t0 t ^ e a ?§' ress i ons of his relative Humood bin Azan, Sultan bin Suggur proceeded with a large fleet to his possessions of Khore Fakaun and Dubba. Although formerly requested by the Imaum to assist his representatives in Mus- kat in any quarrels with their neighbours, it was evident that, far from any intention to exert his power and influence in favour of His Highness' relatives, his sole object was to avail himself of the state of affairs to benefit and promote his own interests, at the expense of either party. I he proceedings of his fleet, however, were not confined to depreda tions upon the boats belonging to Sohar and its dependencies, as the enemies of the Imaum, whose interests he pretended to serve, as also upon the property of the subjects of the Muskat Government, his ally, but were extended to acts of a decidedly piratical nature, upon the vessels of individuals having no concern or connection whatever with the contending parties. For these of course he was compelled by the * For the proceedings of these vessels, vide Sketch of the Beniyas.h 334 JOASMEES. British Government to afford redress ; but with reference to the seizures of vessels belonging to Musk at, the acting governors of that place, fearing to incur his more decided enmity, so far from remonstrating, tacitly, and in some cases openly, sanctioned them. Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur applied for permission to grant assistance to the Shaikh of Towanah against him of Charrak, A - D - 183 ^ both Persian subjects, who were preparing to decide their quarrel by the sword,—a request with which his engage ment connected with the establishment of the restrictive line of course afforded one just plea, among others, to the Resident, for refusing compliance. ' ^ , The people of Heera, under the authority of Sultan bm Suggur, committing a piracy upon a boat belonging to Bunder Abbas, that chief of his own accord compelled restitution of the property plundered, and adopted measures to prevent a recurrence of the offence. The Joasmee Chief superseded his brother Saleh in the government of Shargah, and appointed in his place his son, a. d . 1838.

Two piracies were this year committed, by two Joasmee subjects, named Sultan bin Sohar and his brother Mahomed ; the former attended with the murder of several persons, and the plunder of much property, to the north of the Gulf, upon a boat belonging to Karraclt, having on board a wealthy subject of Chaab, who had fled Mohumrah on its attack and capture by Ali Pasha of Bagdad, and was now on hiaretnrn; the other on a Batinah boat off Ras-ool-Hud. Sultan bm Sohar was after some time discovered and seized at Lingab, and placed at tie ' S P 0S ^ of the Resident, who sent him to Shaikh Samur, the Chaab Chief, to e dealt with as he might think proper; the other, Mahomed, took refuge at Ejman, but, as a subject of Sultan bin Suggur, was u subsequently given up by that chief, together with the Nakh of the pirate vessel. As the first of these had suffered severely fiom his confinement in chains at Shargah, he was released, togetier wi his fellow-prisoner, on their furnishing a bond to pay the sum of crowns. ,.,10 -i^ tW Alarmed at the threats held out against them by Shaikh S ^niur, Governor of Chaab, in consequence of the piracy committe on Karrack boat, having on board one of his most wealthy su J^ c s firmest adherents, by Sultan bin Sohar, the Joasmee Chie s o mgaJOASMEES. 335 and Ras-ool-Khyma despatched their boats in a body, forming unitedly a fleet of twenty-two sail, in order that, in paying their annual visit to Bussora, they might be prepared to repel force by force. On their arrival at Bushire, the Resident addressed a letter to the Shaikh of Chaab, deprecating any interference or molestation on his part towards the Joasmee boats, on the grounds that neither Shaikh Sultan bin Suggnr nor his subjects had the slightest concern in the piracy on the Karrack boat, and that Shaikh Syud bin Guzeeb had done all in his power to forward justice, inasmuch as he had, at great trouble and expense, seized and given over the perpetrators. The misunderstanding was thereby amicably arranged, to the satisfaction of both parties. Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, after various unsuccessful attempts by land a, d. 1839. against the Shehaheen tribe, residing at Casaab, Koomza, and Ras Musseldom, resolved to des patch a naval force to blockade their ports, and thus bring them under control. Although the Shehaheen were completely enclosed on the land side by the territories of the Joasmee Chief, whose alleged autho rity over them was admitted by His Highness the Imaum to the British authorities in the Gulf in 1836, yet that tribe had long continued to maintain a sort of independence, and, keeping up a friendly inter course with Muskat, to exhibit little disposition to submit to the claim of supremacy advanced by the Joasmee Chief. The immediate cause of the present quarrel arose from the trea cherous surrender of one of the Shahaheen forts to the Naib of Shaikh Sultan, residing at Dubba, who immediately dismantled it. Skirmishes and predatory inroads on either side were the consequence, until the Joasmee Chief, finding that he could make no impression by land, meditated the adoption of the measures before alluded to. Alarmed, however, at the rapid successes of the Egyptians, and their tool Ameer Khalid, he relinquished his hostile intentions against the Shel]q.heen, and both parties being thus equally averse to war, amicable arrangements were quickly concluded, through the means of an envoy from himself. Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, who had previously applied to the British authorities in the Gulf, to be informed whether he might look to the British Government for support in the event of his subjugation being contemplated by the Pasha of Egypt, was now (March 1839) compelled to receive his Agent, Syud bin Mootluk,* apd by him induced to summon the Beni Naeem to surrender their fort of Brymee into his hands. The only effect of his summons was to lead that tribe to make the most active preparations for self -defence,— a measure oi bold determination, which did not fail to give him secret pleasure. * \ ide Sketch of the Wahabees, in a subsequent part of this Selection.336 joasmees. He nevertheless hesitated to expel Syud bin Mootluk and his party (which had been destined to form a garrison for Brymee) from his territory, fearing lest the Aboothabee Chief, or some other neighbouring enemy, might receive them into his country and alliance ; but at a general meeting of the maritime chieftains, convened in the presence and through the influence of the Assistant Resident, on board a British vessel. Shaikh Khaleefa bin Shakboot having pledged himself, on oath, to Shaikh Sultan, neither to admit this party nor any others sent by the Egyptian commander, nor to ally himself in any way with him, the latter sent to Syud bin Mootluk to desire him to quit his country, and return to Nujd ; but on that person's producing letters from the Egyptian commander to the several Shaikhs of Oman, to the effect that he was his envoy, and that, therefore, whoever opposed him would be considered inimical to the Egyptian cause, finally withdrew his demand, and acquiesced in his remaining, pending the return of the messenger he had despatched for instructions. Shaikh Sultan, deceived in his expectation that the Chiefs of Brymee would place themselves under his authority, in order to secure his support in their contest with the Beniyas Chief, with a view to which he had directed all the tribes under his control to abstain from afford ing them (the Naeem) the assistance they had hitherto done, now that the Brymee Shaikhs made peace with Shaikh Khaleefa * had cause deeply to regret his short-sighted policy, which had the very opposite effect to that anticipated and desired, his ill-timed neutrality not even saving his own districts from aggression; for two of Shaikh Khaleefa's inland tribes foraying his territories, that chief, in reply to his remon strances, excused himself from returning any of the plundered property, by falsely alleging that the tribes in question were not under his orders, but those of the Egyptian authorities at Lahsa. Two Debaye men having been killed in the desert, owing to their having been mistaken for men of the Monasir Tribe, by a party of six individuals of different tribes, of whom two belonged to that of Ab- doolla bin Rashid, Shaikh 6f Amulgavine (who had long since thrown off any real allegiance to the Joasmee Chief), that chief, on discovering the error, lost no time in proceeding to Shargah, in order to settle, the affair, by paying his share of the Deeah, or price of blood, on the be half of his two followers. The amende was not accepted, and the attempts of the Resident shortly after to effect a reconciliation also failing, the parties were left to adopt their own means by land, pre cluded from hostilities by sea by the terms of the Maritime Truce, of which a period of two months remained yet unexpired. * Vide Sketch of the Beniyas.JOASMEES. 337 In the mean while, however, Shaikh Muktoom of Debaye (having been informed by Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, in reply to his demand or the surrender of those concerned in the death of his two subjects t at he was at liberty to take his own measures for redress) had left his town for the purpose of foraying the neighbourhood of Amul- g a vine; but, finding the inhabitants upon their guard, had been AuPf/ 0 retreat ' leavin ^ six of his P eo ple in the hands of Shaikh Abdoolla bin Rashid, who placed them in confinement.

The inhabitants, to the number of 400, coming out to meet them, were decoyed to some distance by a pretended flight of the attacking force, and, suddenly overwhelmed, were compelled to retreat, with the loss of twenty men killed, besides many wounded. A peace was shortly after temporarily adjusted, through the mediation of three influential Moollas, upon the conditions that the six Debaye men should be set at liberty by Abdoolla bin Rashid, and proportionable compensation afforded by him for the share the two men of his tribe had taken in the death of the two dependents of Shaikh Muktoom. It was considered of great importance that every Information should a. d. 1840. obta ^ n ed relative to Brymee and its inha bitants. An officer (Captain Hamerton) of the Karrack field force was therefore despatched there with this object J but it was not without the greatest difficulty, nor until the principal Naeem Shaikh, Humood bin Saroor, himself voluntarily offered to accompany him, that he reached his destination, owing to the intrigues and obstacles offered by the Joasmee and Debaye Chiefs. Immediately previous to this officer's departure, with a view to combine the power and resources of the inland tribes, who were disposed to resist to the utmost any aggressions of the Egyptian Agent their chiefs Were invited to an assembly, convened at Ejman by &amp; the Resident: small presents of money were distributed, and their dif ferences reconciled, through his mediation and influence ; with the exception of a misunderstanding between the Chiefs of the Zowahirand Bern Kuttub Iribes, regarding some mares belonging to the latter, which had been stolen, and sold to the former, and which he would not upon any consideration consent to restore. Ihey were informed, that although they could not be received under the immediate protection of the British Government, yet that their efforts in the maintenance of their independence were viewed with satisfaction, and would insure its good will and countenance,—indeedJOASMEES. assistance, in the shape of a moderate supply of military stores and provisions. Some of the Bedouin Naeem Tribes, under Hdmeed bin Obed bin Subt, the Chief of Heera, under the ptetence of prior right over the then ruler, Rashid bin Huraeed, to authority over Ejman, surprised the town at night, and gained possession of the fort. Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur in the first instance declined to interfere in favour of the lawful gover nor, but considering) without any grounds, that he would thereby give umbrage to the British Government, subsequently directed his son Suo-cmr, and Muktoom bin Butye, to proceed and eject the Shaikh of Heera, which they did, and moreover burnt his town, in retaliation for the injuries he had inflicted upon the people of Ejman. As anticipated, the Joasmee Chief, having lulled his opponent into supposed security, b.y declaring himself satisfied with the extent ofpu- nishment he had already inflicted by means of his son and the Shaikh of Debaye, was only awaiting the lapse of the term of the annual Maritime Truce, ^hose conditions were guaranteed by the British Government, to commence an attack upon Amulgavine by sea and land. He then despatched a fleet, composed of three Buggalows and sixty Buggarahs, conveying 1,500 men, under the orders of Suggur, his son,- and Muktoom bin Butye of Debaye, to blockade the place by sea, while he assumed the personal command of a force of 700 Bedouins, to invest it by land. . . The only operations which had been carried into effect previous to the Resident's arrival on the coast, for the purpose of establishing the Maritime Truce for another year, were directed against a tower com manding the entrance to the backwater, which it was necessary to take or destroy before the blockading boats could pass. An entrenchment, erected in advance of this tower, had been carried by the Joasmee force, who, however, in attempting to improve their success, by advancing upon the fort, had been received so warmly as to be obliged to retire, with the loss of eight men killed and forty wounded. An attempt by Shaikh Khaleefa bin Shakboot to create a diversion m ^vour ol Amulgavine, by surprising Debaye, had failed. ^' dUS a icacie thus far when the timely mediation of the Resident effected an arrange ment of the quarrel, and the siege was raised. It was agreed that Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur should withdraw the demand he had made for the destruction of the tower commanding the wells of fresh water, while Shaikh Abdoolla bin Rashid on Ins part should make good the losses sustained by the Joasmee Chief in ie several skirmishes which had taken place piiorto the siege. po basis, a formal treaty of alliance and friendship was complete , wi the additional stipulations, that Shaikh Abdoolla should erect no nc.JOASMEES. 339 fortifications, and that he should pay the value in coin of what he could not restore in kind. These proceedings, as above detailed, were the result of the intrigues of the Joasmee Chief to bring under his immediate authority ^and subjection the Chiefs of Ejman, Amulgavine, and Debaye,—a design which, in the records of the Residency, he is repeatedly mentioned as having entertained for some time previous; but the settlement of the seiious distmbance they had caused happily removed all further obstacle to the renewal of the Maritime Truce. bin Sultan, the son of the Joasmee Chief, at the instigation of that intriguing and restless character Muktoom bin Butye of Debaye, now attempted to cast off the authority of his father. He commenced by ingratiating himself with the people, inducing many to join him, by persuading them that if he were chief he would deal more leniently with them, and gieatly reduce the tax upon the pearl divers (levied by all the chiefs at a rate ranging from 1^ to 7 crowns,—the latter being the amount recovered by Sultan bin Suggur upon each at the last season). The father, Shaikh Sultan, at first resolved upon a recourse to arms, but was at length persuaded to negotiate; and an arrange- ment was agreed to, by which the son, instead of being Governor of Shargah, and receiving a salary, as before, was to hold it as a permanent possession, paying annually a stipulated sum. To these terms he (Sultan bin Suggur) was compelled by circumstances to yield, but with a reluctance which indicated that he only did so in the hope of being^ sooner or later able to avail himself of some favourable opportunity to overthrow the illegally acquired authority of the son The loss of the most productive and populous of his seaports appears to have been to him a source of great distress, and to have had a material effect upon his health and person. Affairs remained in this state until December, when the Shaikh's brother, Saleh bin Su^o- ur (the former Governor of Shargah), and some of the principal residents in the place, disgusted at the influence Muktoom of Debaye had acquired over the mind of Shaikh Suggur bin Sultan, and foreseeing the injurious results to the best interests of the Joasmee Tribe likely to accrue from the division the irregular proceedings of the latter had introduced among them, determined, by a vigorous and well arrano-ed effort, to restore the legitimate authority of their chief. Accordingly they informed Shaikh Sultan, that if he would contrive to be clandes- tinely in the neighbourhood of Shargah on a certain night, they would introduce him into the town, and, partly by the aid of their own adherents, assisted by the moral effect of his actual presence, put him in possession of the person of his son Suggur, 45340 JOASMEES. This plot seems to have been attended with complete success; Shaikh Suggur, surprised while asleep, found himself deserted by all his followers, and a prisoner in the hands of his justly offended father, who forthwith commanded him to make immediate preparation for his removal 1o Ras-ool-Khyma. Prior, however, to his departure, some of his adher ents found means to communicate with him secretly, and intimating their intention of seeking refuge with Shaikh Muktoom of Debaye, advised him to take an opportunity, while on the road to Ras-ool-Khyma, to slip away and join them. This scheme was carried into execution; and the only reply made by the Debaye Chief to Shaikh Sultan's indignant remonstrances and demands for the fugitives was that he could not, as an Arab, violate the rights of hospitality, by giving up, against their own wish, those who had sought his protection. The Joasmee Shaikh being now convinced that his son had been counselled and encouraged in his undutiful conduct by Shaikh Muktoom, determined to keep terms with the latter no longer ; and accordingly, summoning all his own adherents, he effected a reconciliation with his former enemies the Chiefs of Amulgavine and Aboothabee, and forming an offensive and defensive alliance with them, required their aid in the siege of Debaye. Rejoiced at the prospect of indulging his long cherished hatred against Shaikh Muktoom, the Beniyas Chief willingly engaged to meet Shaikh Sultan's wishes, upon condition that, when captured, Debaye should be entirely demolished, and the inhabitants permitted to locate them selves either at Shargah or Aboothabee, agreeably to their own incli nations. These vigorous measures, and the extensive arrangements in progress for the attack of Debaye, greatly alarmed Shaikh Muktoom and his people, and they lost no time in endeavouring to avert the storm which threatened, by making professions of unlimited obedience and submis sion, and employing the cogent argument of a bribe of 1,000 crowns. Unable to resist this offer, Shaikh Sultan added another to the many proofs already afforded of his faithless and insincere character, by coolly breaking all his engagements with the Beniyas and Amulgavme Chiefs, reconciling himself with Shaikh Muktoom, and, what is more extraordinary than all, replacing his son Suggur in the government oi Shargah; thus leaving his brother Saleh, and the faithful adherents who had supported him so well, to all the bitter effects of the hatred and revenge of the now reinstated and triumphant governor, without the slighest attempt to shield them from him. Shaikh Khaleefa was of course highly indignant at this unexpected breach of formal and written engagements, which he would naturally take the first opportunity that might offer to resent. Neither Shaikh Muktoom nor Suggur bin Sultan were likely soon to forget or overlookJOASMEES. 342 the proceedings of Shaikh Sultan in respect to themselves; and as the faithless conduct of the latter towards his own adherents and allies would necessarily deprive him of all internal or external aid for the future, full scope was given to the ambitious projects of lus son. On the conclusion of the pearl fishery of this year, a Ras-ool-Khyma boat with money and cargo on board, arriving at Biddah, excited the cupidity of some lawless characters residing there, who, on her quitting again, went in pursuit, and overtaking her off Khore-al-Jullaya, captured her and after stripping the crew, and putting them on shore, proceeded with their prize to Khore Shugeer, a backwater between Aboothabec and Adeed. ^ Shaikh Salmin bin Nassir, of Biddah, on gaining the intelligence, espatohed two Buggarahs in pursuit; but these amved in time only o find the Ras-ool-Khyma boat abandoned, and quite stripped. Amona- the pirates was the old delinquent and notorious character, Jassim bin Jabbur Rugragee,* who had in the course of the last five years been guilty of two or three similar acts, and who, as he had invariably proeeeded into the interior with his plunder, nor returned until tho loilowmg fishing season, had always escaped detection. Strong suspicions existed—indeed little doubt was entertained— that were it not for the protection afforded by the Biddah Shaikh, who it was believed, actually shared the booty, he could not thus have found the means and opportunity for these almost yearly acts of piracy. Fur- tier, one thing was certain, that Jassim had resided at Biddah durin™ the whole of the last pearl fishery. With reference, therefore, to the warning personally given by the Resident, in September 1836, regardino- this notorious character, and the chief having on that occasion actually asked for and received a written authority from that functionary for his seizure be could not be looked upon as other than a direct or indirect accompliee, and therefore deserving of being held responsible for his acts is sending out two boats in pursuit was evidently a mere blind, for he acknowledged that his people, fifty in number, fell in with the pirates consisting only of twelve men, whereas these brought back to Biddah the Ras-ool-Khyma and pirate vessels mere shells, stripped of sails, and every moveable article in them. Accordingly the Indian Naval squadron then in the Gulf, consisting of the Auckland, steam -frigate, the Cootc sloop, and the Tigris, brig, under the command of Commodore Bracks' proceeded to Biddah, to demand the surrender of the pirate boat and its puze, and the payment of 300 dollars, with an additional 40 dollars as I ie va ue of the property subsequently plundered by Rugragee, together \ulli the boat which on that occasion fell into his hands. * \ ide Sketch of the Beniyas, in a subsequent part of this Selection.342 JOASMEES. The affair was most judiciously arranged ; but it was not, however, till eleven shots had been fired, one into the a. d. 1811. curtain of the fort, two into the fort itself, and one into a house hard by, that Shaikh Salmin bin Nassir was induced to afford compliance. The remaining shots either fell short of their mark, or were intentionally directed, to avoid the infliction of injury; and it was a matter of gratification that the object desired was fully attained, without any loss of life on shore. Rugragee's boat was publicly burnt previous to the squadron's sailing from Biddah. These proceedings were attended with decidedly good effects: Salmin bin Nassir lost no time in seizing the slaves and effects of Jassim bin Jabbur Rugragee at Biddah, and the Chief of Bahrein issued the strictest orders to all the places on the sea coast, belonging to himself, not to afford shelter to suspicious characters, under pain of severe punishment. It was subsequently ascertained that Rugragee and some of his people were actually in Biddah when the squadron arrived off that port, but had been sent off with all haste by Salmin bin Nassir, who had,, on finding matters so serious, and that he was held fully to ac count, despatched a party to bring back the pirates ] but it was then too late,—they had got beyond his reach. Shaikh Sultan, on receiving information (false and unfounded) that Ameer Khalid contemplated sending Syud bin Mootluk and Bin Buteel with a force against Brymee, opened a communication with them, with a view to promote the ruin of the Brymee Shaikhs. His letters by some means fell into the hands of the latter themselves. The character^ however, of the old Joasmee Shaikh, for faithlessness and intrigue, was so well established throughout these quarters, and he was so entirely distrusted by all parties, that his machinations seldom produced^ comparatively speaking, any evil consequences. Abdoolla bin Rashid, the Shaikh of Amulgavine, desirous of taking advantage of the divisions existing in the family of the Joasmee Chief r to complete the building on the sea side, commenced previous to the attack upon his tower, but to which he was precluded from adding by one of the conditions of the treaty entered into on that occasion with Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, through the mediation of the British Resident, expressed his wish to this effect in an interview with that functionary. He admitted that Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur had as yet displayed no signs of enmity ; that he had, indeed, carefully adhered to the terms of the treaty ; but remarked, that he considered it hard that he alone of all the chiefs should be restrained from altering or improving his defences as he thought proper, the more so as the incomplete state of his towers left him exposed to the attack of his enemies by sea. Such a proceeding was deprecated by the Resident, as involving aJOASMEES. 343 breach of the treaty negotiated at his mediation, at a time when, but for the timely exertion of his influence, he would have been placed in a situation of great difficulty and peril, and as inevitably leading to a renewal of hostilities with the Joasmee Chief. ihe only occurrences of notice during this season were some petty misunderstandings between the Shargah and Aboothabee people, in consequence of the arrest of a person in the latter port for debt, and the seizme of a mast from a Shargah boat. This spar had originally been lost from a wrecked vessel belonging to Sultan, the brother of the Beni- yas Chief, and, having been picked up at sea, had been sold to its present, possessor. An accidental collision between a Shargah and Aboothabee Buggarah on the pearl banks led to blows with sticks between the crews; but the quarrel was made up, and the Nakhoda of the former craft severely taken to task by his chief for his irregular conduct. Subsequent to the visit of the Resident to the Arabian Coast, as before a. d. 1842. mentioned. Shaikh Abdoolla bin Rashid, the Chief of Amulgavine, notwithstanding the remonstrances he had received, and the disapprobation with which his designs had been viewed, commenced the building of the proscribed towers, and the construction of another for the defence of the back water. The Joasmee Chiefs repeated representations, calling upon the Resident, as mediator, to compel fulfilment of the conditions of the treaty entered into through his mediation, now thus openly violated, induced that functionary to depute his Assistant to the Arabian Coast in November of this year, with a view to the settlement of the misunder standing between them. Ihe charge made by Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur was found to be correct. It was, indeed, admitted by Shaikh Abdoolla bin Rashid ; nor could he adduce any palliatory plea for his conduct in the commission of any, the slightest breach of the compact, on the part of the former; but urged merely, in excuse of his faithless act, the necessity of every precaution in self-defence against so intriguing and treacherous a person as the Joasmee Chief. He further expressed his determination^ on the same grounds, not onlyrto complete the tower in question, but to build others; and on being reminded of the circumstances under which the Resident's timely mediation had been afforded, by which he had been saved from inevitable ruin, and pressed to consider the necessity of fulfilling strictly the conditions by which he was bound, under pain of the severe displeasure of Government and the probable chance of its coercing him in the event of hesi tation or refusal, he stated positively that he would not destroy the buildings he had lately erected, but that his tower, and all that belonged to him, being at the disposal of the Government, it might act344 JOASMEES. as it saw fit. The Shaikh of Ras-ool -Khyma, on the other hand, refused to listen to any compromise ; and, with reference to a proposition to afford, him assistance in enforcing compliance, declared that he had washed his hands of the business, and that he looked entirely to the British Government to hold both parties to their agreement, as entered into through the mediation of its representative. The Amulgavine Shaikh being called upon to suspend the further addition to the old or the construction of any new works, the case was now referred for the decision of Government. In accordance with the instructions thereon received, the Assistant Resident, then in charge, proceeded in May 1843 a. d . 1843. to Amulgavine, and finding the Shaikh as little disposed as ever to make the requisite by destroying such towers as had been built or added to, in contravention of the treaty, was constrained, after the failure of every other argument, to have recourse to threats of coercion, before that chief would be induced to concede and pledge himself to a compliance with his just demands The establishment of the Maritime Truce for the extended period of ten years, which took place at this time, overturned in a great measure the arguments of the Amulgavine Shaikh for the non-destruction of the proscribed towers, particularly that erected as a defence towards the sea, and in like manner removed the objections of the Joasmee Chief to their existence. It was therefore agreed, that on the formers acting fully up to his engagements, he would be at liberty to rebuild or erect what towers or defences he pleased, and that the British Government would thenceforth be relieved of all further responsibility arising from its guarantee,—in short, that the treaty should be considered null anc The British Agent was directed to remain a month or a month and a half at Amulgavine, for the purpose of reporting every ten days t ic progress that should have been made. Before the expiration of the period thus allotted, when one of the towers had been levelled with the ground, Muktoom bin Butyc be- coming mediator, and the Amulgavine Shaikh threatening to withho his adherents from the pearl fishery, for the purpose of ^ territories of his opponent ,-a proceeding which would have subjec e the latter to great injury, either by debarring his de P e ' de 7 ' 0m ™ profits to be derived from the fishery, inasmuch as he would b compelled to retain them in a similar manner at home in ^ le • or by exposing them to such losses, during their absence on the banks, as the former h!d it in his power to inflict,-Sultan bin Suggur foni. intimated his consent to forego the further destruction of the proscubed towers, if it were any longer permitted him to do bo.JOASMEES. 345 Such consent was evidently quite sufficient grounds for relinquishing the demand made on the part of Government, the office and duty of a guarantee being to prevent one party from neglecting, while the other u fils, the obligations imposed by the compact, and not to interfere should they mutually determine to annul the same ; and the object of impiessing the Maritime Arab Chiefs with the conviction that the breach of an engagement, entered into through the mediation of the British Crovernmcnt, would never be passed over, having been fully gained it was a matter of the greatest satisfaction that this long pending dispute was now fully terminated, to the apparent satisfaction of both parties without the exercise or even demonstration of actual force, and without any loss of credit on the part of the British Government. A Debaye Kafila having in November 1843 been plundered by some o the Bern Glinflah, Shaikh Mnktoom, in retaliation, made a sudden foray into the lands belonging to that tribe, and to the Chiefs of Brymee and carried off a large number of camels and other cattle, whereby le gave great umbrage to the Joasmee Chief, Sultan bin Suggur, who at the time determined to come to an open rupture with thc^Debaye Chief and compel him to restore the plunder. Wiser councils, however prevailed (the fear of Muktoom's attaching himself more closely to the Bemyas Chief, which would have thrown the balance of power into the hands of the latter, and have proved highly prejudicial to his interests, having its due weight); and in disgust at Shaikh Sultan's change of determination, which deprived them of their revenge, the Chiefs of Brymee (Beni Ghuflah) threatened on their side to submit to Shaikh Khaleefa bin Shakboot of Aboothabee, and actually commenced aggressions upon their former ally. The death of an inhabitant of Shargah by the hand of the brother of Shaikh Muktoom, notwitstandin^ hat the payment ef the Deeah or price of blood was immediate^ endued by the latter, had nearly brought things to a crisis. The Joasmee Chief s conduct at least embittered the feud between his uneoutro lab e but in a measure dependent allies. A smart action took place, inland, between the Beni Ghuflah and Muktoom, in which the TI, lnC T) r 16 ~ d '.T lth the l0SS of Several men killed 011 hoth sides. he Debaye Chief paid somewhat dearly for the victory, having him self received several wounds, one of which caused him the loss of an eye. Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur now (July 1844) exerted himself to effect a. d. 1844. a reconciliation with the inland Bedouins; but , + . his att empts having been unsuccessful, he was a ou to despatch a person to Aboothabee to sound Shaikh Khaleefa bin Shakboot the Beniyas Chief, touching his inclination to receive proposals for a treaty of peace.

A vessel of war was despatched with the above communication, and she had not been long away ere she returned, to inform the Resident that the Joasmee Chief had shown the greatest ' zeal and alacrity in taking measures for the execution of the requisi tions made upon him'; that the property and captive had been given up to the people of Debaye, and the money demanded as security for the peaceable bearing of the delinquents had been paid, and deposited in the hands of the British Agent, This was all satisfactory enough ; but, unfortunately, the very vessel that was the bearer of such welcome tidings was also charged with other intelligence, of a less satisfactory nature. She brought news of a fresh violation of the Maritime Truce in September 1844. The Joasmees were again the offenders: one, Esai bin Jassim, a native of Shargah, quarrelled with the master of an Ejman boat; high words ensued, and these were shortly succeeded by blows. Esai bin Jassim boarded and attacked the Ejman craft, and severely wounded one of the crew on board with a spear. This case, though more grave in its character than any preceding it, was likewise brought to a settle ment without any difficulty. Shaikh Abdool Azeez having begged the Resident to obtain reparation for the wrongs his people had suffered, that officer called upon Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur to make Esai bin Jassim. disburse the sum of 200 crowns, ' by way of punishment for his irregular conduct.' The Joasmee Chief, on his part, did not hesitate to comply with the requisitions preferred against him, but hastened, in December 1844, to fnuii.&gt;h an order for the 200 dollars demanded. The money was lodged in the hands of Moolla Hussein, the British Agent at Shargah, and subsequently made over by him to the Chief of Ejman, as compensa tion for the wounds inflicted on his subject. In the early part of the ensuing year (1846), # hostilities commenced A D lg4fi between the Joasmee Tribe and the Chief of Debaye. Shaikh Sultan, it would seem, with a view to extend his authority over the minor ports of Ejman and Amulgavine, determined, as a preparatory measure, to erect a number oi towers at a place called Khan,f which, although in his own dominions, bordered also upon those of Debaye, the growing influence of whose chief it was his particular interest to keep in check and restrain. Shaikh Muktoom was by no means inclined to permit the plan to be carried Nothing worthy of notice occurred in 1845. 1 1 he actual site of the fort was at a place called Aboo Ileyle, within gunshot range of Khan, and distant from Debaye three miles. 46348 JOASMEES. into execution. He at once resolved to oppose the erection of the fortifications with all the means in his power, and the better to enable him to cope with his powerful enemy, he entered into a close alliance with the chiefs of the two ports (Ejman and Amulgavine) whose subjec tion was eventually contemplated. The Joasmee was equally determined and obstinate,—the fort should be built, and no one should prevent it. He opened negotiations with the Chief of Aboothabee, and, strange to say, notwithstanding the feud so long existing between the Joasmee and Beniyas Tribes, he contrived to persuade Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon to forsake the side of Shaikh Muktoom of Debaye, and come over to that of himself. Prepa rations were set on foot for active operations, and hostilities were on the eve of commencing,—nay, a trifling case of aggression had already occurred, in the seizure* of two Ejman boats by the people of Ramse and Himreeah,—when the opportune arrival of Her Majesty's and the Honorable Company's vessels of war oil: the port of Shargah induced the belligerents to refrain for a while, and attend to the voice of a mediator. Commodore Sir H. Blackwood, R. N., desired the chiefs to await the result of a reference that should be made to the Resident, on the subject of the fortifications in course of erection. His proposition was readily agreed to, and Shaikh Sultan gave a solemn assurance to the British Commodore, that until the Resident's reply had been received not a hand should be laid to the building. This was well | but, unfor tunately, it was not in the nature of the Joasmee to adhere to a promise. He proceeded, in direct violation of the pledge he had given, to erect and complete the structure at Khan. Hostilities were renewed, and conflicts were daily occurring between the forces of the hostile chiefs, when Captain Kemball, who had been deputed to strive and bring matters to a peaceable settlement, arrived in March 1846 off the Arabian Coast. That officer did all in his power to effect a reconciliation between the contending chiefs. He remon strated with Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur for breaking his promise ; he pointed out, that although the British Government had it not in their mind to interfere with the inland affairs of the Arabs, yet they viewed with extreme displeasure his present line of behaviour, both as being opposed to the general peace and tranquillity of the tribes in the Gulf, and as showing a ' spirit of ill-will and defiance.' Shaikh Sultan, after urging, in defence of his conduct, a host of excuses, as lame in their nature as they were false in reality, began to assure the Resident how much he was grieved to think that any act he * Seized from the shore, and not by boats at sea.JOASMEES. 349 had committed should have been distasteful to the British Government; but that, as he himself must admit, every chief has a right to erect in his own territories structures of whatsoever description he chooses, so he was puzzled to imagine how, by the construction of the fortifications at Khan, he could possibly have given just cause for offence. He at first denied, but subsequently granted, that he had pledged himself to the Commodore not to complete the towers until he had learned the Resident's opinion regarding them. That promise, however, was furnished, he said, on a distinct understanding that the Chief of Debaye was on his part to keep the peace; and as the latter proved a constant thorn in his side, and was for ever annoying him, he had no alternative left but to continue the building. Captain Kemball plainly perceiving that further discussion would be unattended with success, proceeded on the 14th and 15th March 1846 to hold interviews with the Shaikh of Debaye, and his allies of Ejman and Amulgavine. These three chiefs expressed a great desire for peace, but at the same time most justly observed, that so long as Shaikh Sultan acted the part of an aggressor, which he most undoubtedly had hitherto done, it was but right and proper that they, weak individually, though strong collectively, should combine to repel his attacks ;—in short, that as they were well aware he was anxious to reduce them from a state of inde pendence to one of subjection, they had resolved to stand by each other to the last extremity. Should the British Government, however, gua rantee that no inland aggressions would be permitted against their territories, they would at once withdraw their forces, and abstain from the prosecution of warfare. This proposition, being one that could not be entertained for an instant, was at once rejected ; and the inveterate obstinacy of Shaikh Sultan, coupled with the determined opposition of Shaikh Muktoom and his allies, leaving no room for hope that affairs could be peaceably arranged without compromising the British Govern ment, Captain Kemball quitted the coast, and returned to his post at Bu shire. He had scarcely been gone a day and a night ere an event took place that paved the way for the re-opening of negotiations. Shaikh Suggur bin Sultan, the Chief of Shargah, together with Abdoolla bin Howeylim, the head of the Beni Kuttub, having made a foray into the neighbourhood of Amulgavine, were suddenly attacked by a large body of troops, under the personal command of Abdoolla bin Rashid (Chief of Amulgavine). A fierce struggle ensued, neither party yielding an inch, until Shaikh Suggur fell from his horse, mortally wounded; on perceiving which the Shargah party took to their keels, and hastened back to their homes.350 JO ASM EES. Shaikh Suggur had all along been looked upon as ' the prime mover and instigator of the aggressive proceedings of Shaikh Sultan,' his father ; and this supposition was now confirmed, for Shaikh Sultan although he expressed himself anxious to avenge the death of his son, showed a greater anxiety for the cessation of hostilities. He on the 2nd and 3rd April 1846 addressed the Resident, ' expressing his regret at not having followed the advice of the Assistant Resident' when he was lately on the coast; he told the British Agent in the plain est terms that he had been blinded by the counsels of his son. Shaikh Suggur, now no more ; that he was for ever wishing disorders might cease, but the evil instigations of others would not permit him to act as he wished. ' What he now hoped was that the Resident would again depute some person, on his part, in a British Government vessel, to quiet affairs,' and reconcile all who were at feud with each other. Here was a golden opportunity for putting an end to disorder,—here was a time for mediation ;—nor was it lost sight of. Commodore Haw kins succeeded in bringing hostilities to a close, and through his inter vention was a temporary peace concluded between the contending parties, whereby it was agreed that all the chiefs should withdraw with their troops to their respective territories, and, until the ensuing 12th of November, a period of more than six months, one and all should be at peace with each other. A satisfactory arrangement this,—one highly beneficial to the interests of all parties. The pearl season was now at hand, and the people of every tribe would be able to flock to the banks, and pursue their vocation. There would be no fear of molesta tion either, for the treaty had been signed in the presence of a British Commodore, and that alone would insure its being kept inviolate. Such, we may readily suppose, were the feelings generally uppermost in the minds of both chiefs and subjects ; such the assurances of peace and quiet that reigned in their breasts;—and such, we are convinced, would have been the state of the case, had the wily Joasmee not been one of the members affected. He unfortunately was one of the number. It was he, too, that had promises to fulfil beyond the mere abstaining- from warfare : he had engaged to demolish the towers he had lately erected; he had promised to permit the people of other tribes to come and go among those of his own tribe, whensoever and wheresoever they listed. These, besides many others, were the engagements entered into by Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur. Let us inquire with how much faithfulness he adhered to his promises. He forbade the people of Debaye admittance into Shargah; he commenced building, in lieu of demolishing ; he strove to instigate Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon, but late his ally, to offend and annoyJOASMEES. 351 Shaikh Muktoom bin Butye ; he seduced a party of the Al Huza from their allegiance to the Amulgavine Chief ;—in short, we may safely say that he put his hand to the treaty with every intention to infringe it. To give a description of all the intrigues he stooped to engage in were both idle and useless. I shall therefore confine myself to the mention of one so inconceivably glaring that his character for deceit will stand naked before us. To describe the case I refer to, I cannot do better, I think, than furnish an extract from a letter, detailing the affair, that was addressed to the Resident at the time it occurred by Moolla Hussein, the British Agent at Shargah. It is thus that he writes :— ' I have understood that Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, when visiting Syud bin Tahnoon at Aboothabee, from a deficiency of sense, entered into engagements for the due execution of their designs,—that Syud bin Tahnoon should get ready a force of horsemen and camel riders to plunder the territories of the Bedouin Tribes, such as the Ghuflah and the Khuaiter, and those connected with them, viz. the Al Ali of the Tribe of Abdoolla bin Rashid, and others ; and with a view solely to in flict loss and injury upon Abdoolla bin Rashid, Chief of Amulgavine. On the 2nd December, accordingly, did a force set out, and at daylight of the lf5th attacked a position of the Ghuflah, containing about thirty men, resting in fancied security, who were taken by surprise. I un derstand that the Beniyas killed of the above all but five, who escaped by flight, carried away all the property from the dwellings, and captured five hundred camels, and a number of sheep. It is reported that of the Beniyas one man was killed, the son of Rashid bin Fazil. Most people possessed of the slightest reason and sense lament and condemn these proceedings on the part of the Beniyas, who were, however, prompted and instigated by Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur himself to the slaughter of his dependents and subjects, because those Bedouins, such as the Ghuflah, the Khuaiter, the Naeem, &amp;c. were all of them formerly connected with the Joasmees—particularly the Ghuflah. This senseless conduct of Shaikh Sultan will ruin and depopulate those districts. The Bedouins, on this event, were thrown into the utmost consternation, and the elders of Shargah despatched a messenger with the intelligence to Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, who affected to disapprove of the proceed ings of the Beniyas against the Ghuflah, and yet it was he himself drew them on them. On the arrival of the messenger on the 7lh of December, Shaikh Sultan came to Shargah, and immediately despatched a boat to Aboothabee, to intimate to Shaikh Syud that the act of his people against the Ghuflah had caused no change in his sentiments or feelings.352 JOASMEES. and in their friendly relations, but requesting that if, among the camels plundered from the Ghuflah, there should be found any belonging to the people of Shargah or Ras-ool-Khyma, they might be restored. I hear that Shaikh Syud returned an answer which satisfied him on every point.' Let us go on to consider the result of this chief's single-minded and upright behaviour. At the close of the year 1846, when the pearl season was over, and the land truce at an end. Shaikh Sultan began to revolve in his mind plans of revenge upon the Chief of Amulgavine, for the slaughter of his son. Shaikh Suggur bin Sultan. He resolved to fall with all his power upon Shaikh Muktoom bin Butye, and, after the reduction of that chief, to fulfil his designs against Abdoolla bin Rashid, who, when unaided by others, would fall an easy prey to the wrath of his more powerful opponent. Shaikh Syud was once more summoned to assist in the undertaking. He cheerfully responded to the call, and hastened to join the Joasmees, with all his available forces. The plan of attacking Debaye in the outset was precisely the thing : nothing could be more consonant to the wishes of the Beniyas Chief than to aid in the re duction of Debaye, and by no other means would the Joasmee be able to wreak his vengeance on Abdoolla bin Rashid. Such was the language held by Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon. Shaikh Sultan, however, was not to be duped : rather than see Debaye fall into the hands of Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon, he would forego his revenge,— he would change his plan of attack ; he would proceed against the town of Amulgavine, and not against that of Debaye. To this Shaikh Syud would not for a moment agree : a difference of opinion arose, which quickly led to a quarrel, and either chief veering round, and suddenly shifting his policy, made overtures to Shaikh Muktoom bin Butye, who humoured the one and rejected the other. With Shaikh Syud he refused to treat on the terms that were offered. With Shaikh Sultan he in February A ' D - 1847 - or March 1847 entered into a treaty, in conse quence of the latter faithfully promising to destroy the towers he had erected at Aboo Heyle, within a period of three months,—a promise, it is scarcely necessary to add, he never intended to fulfil. Nothing worthy of notice occurred from this date until the com mencement of the year 1848, when, ' after friendly a. d . 1848. negotiations had been for some time carried on between Shaikh Saltan bin Suggur and the Chiefs of Debaye and Amulgavine, the people of Ejman,' (who were now once again on the side of the latter,) ' fancying themselves secure, re-opened their inter course with the people of Shargah.' Abdoolla bin Sultan, son of theJOASMEES. 353 Joasmee, who was chief of the place, and on a par with his father for uprightness in dealing and single-mindedness of purpose, made a treacherous attempt to surprise and capture the fort of Ejman on the 12th January 1848. His plot, deeply laid though it was, signally 1 ailed, and led to all the maritime chiefs once more uniting and breaking off relations with the sons of Shaikh Sultan * With regard to Shaikh Sultan himself, Moolla Hussein tells us, in a letter dated February 1st, 1848,—' When he (Shaikh Sultan) heard of the proceedings of his sons, and the failure of their stratagem to capture Ejman, which had led to an alliance between the minor chiefs and Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon of Aboothabee, he was much grieved since detriment and injury could not fail to accrue there from' to his interests; and he immediately wrote to the several Shaikhs, denouncing and disavowing their act : but this communication was dictated by the result, had the attempt been successful he would have approved of their conduct.' We entirely concur with the Agent in the opinion he has above expressed, and are moved to pity for the Joasmee Chief, who was doomed to witness so many of his gigantic and disinterested plans both loiled and frustrated. About this period, hostilities commenced between the Nujdee Lieu tenant and the Chief of Aboothabee. The course pursued by Shaikh Sultan throughout the war was of a piece with the rest of his conduct. The following extracts from letters addressed to the Resident by Moolla Hussein, British Agent at Shargah, will sufficiently illustrate Shaikh Sultan s character; and laid down, as they are, in regular order, they furnish a clear though diminutive outline of the part he played in the struggle. The first passage selected is one from a letter of the 29th of May f «L W , fo' 1 , 1 ' 6 writes: —' Greal animosity before existed on the part of Shaikh Sultan against Shaikh Muktoom bin Butye, and he was exciting Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon to attack the latter; but when he observed Syud bin Tahnoon had joined the coalition against Mahomed bin Syf, he secretly sent to Muktoom to propose an alliance.' Again, in a letter of the 14th of June 1848, he says ' On the 10th of June, Shaikh Sultan returned to Shargah, and wrote to Syud bin lahnoon, that he had at first determined to come for the purpose of arranging matters between the parties, but when he learned that he did not desire it, he had given up the intention ; and at the same time 1 have heard privately he wrote to Mahomed bin Syf that he had prepared to go to his assistance, but could find none of the chiefs of the coast to » Ibrahim is the second party referred to. He too took part in the plot against Ejman.354 JO ASM EES. support him; encouraging him, however, to hold out bravely, and, please God, reinforcements would shortly arrive from Nujd.' A .lain, at the close of the same month, when talking of Shaikh Muktoom of Debaye, he writes on the 25th June 1848 He has no confidence in Syud bin Tahnoon. With regard to his relations with Shaikh Sultan, outwardly a constant intercourse is kept up between them, but inwardly God knows ! A constant correspondence is also going on be'tween Shaikh Sultan and Shaikh Syud. I cannot distinguish the false from the true men, as the chiefs of these parts are all endeavouring each to deceive his neighbour.' In a further letter he writes ' On the 6th Shaban (8th July 1848) Shaikh Syud despatched from Brymee a special courier to Ras- ool-Khyma, with a letter to Shaikh Sultan, to the effect, I understand, that if he desired the continuance of their alliance on its present footing, he must at once commence hostilities against the people of Debaye, and prohibit and cut off their intercourse with his (the Joasmee's) territories. Shaikh Sultan was greatly perplexed, and knew not what reply to give. He resolved therefore to return an evasive answer, in terms of acquies cence,—to the effect that their engagements remained unaltered, and that he had prohibited all commerce and intercourse between his territories and those of Debaye. On the night of the 9th Shaban (11th July), after the above answer had been sent, Soleyman, one of Shaikh Sultan's followers, secretly took his departure from Shargah for Debaye, without the knowledge of the inhabitants, apprehensive lest it should reach the ears of Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon. On meeting Shaikh Muktoom and his elders, he informed them that at heart Shaikh Sultan desired the closest alliance and friendship with them, but that he beo-o-ed them for the present to forbid their tribe from continuing their intercourse with Shargah, and he purposed proclaiming publicly in Shargah that none should communicate with Debaye, in order that the rumour might spread abroad in the country. Shaikh Muktoom and his elders replied that they would not oppose the views of Shaikh Sultan. Some three or four months later in the year, after Shaikh Su tan s territories had been forayed by the troops of the Aboothabee Chief, an after he had complained of the said foray in the bitterest terms to the Resident, reproaching Shaikh Syud with breaches of faith, and al manner of treachery, but omitting, of course, to mention how he, by his own conduct, had brought the attack upon himself -after all this, he committed himself to a most extraordinary piece of duplicity. On one and the same day (30th October 1848) did he make overtures of peace to Shaikh Syud bin 1 ahnoon, and iftsuc an ordei ti ^ people of Shargah, forbidding them ' to proceed on their voyages,/ / J0ASMEE3. 355 his object being, it was supposed, to march with his forces in aid of the Wahabees; and on the 4th of December we learn from another communication that the combined forces of Shaikh Sultan, Muktoom bin Butye, and Humeed bin Rashid, set out from Shargah with Syud bin Mootluk, and the remnant of the Nujdees, to attack Shaikh Syud at Brymee. The Joasmee had now therefore plainly identified himself with the cause of the Wahabees, and was at open war with the Chief of the Beniyas. How matters would have ended, or what would have been the next step of the Joasmees, had hostilities continued, it is difficult to say. No general engagement, however, took place between the contending armies. Peace was concluded in February 1849, and the Brymee forts restored to the Wahabee commander,—all things to all parties reverting to the condition they were in before the strife commenced. Shaikh Sultan had for some time past been planning an expedition against Khore Fukaun, a port on the Batinah Coast, now in the pos session of His Excellency Syud Soweynee ; but, owing to the strong terms in which both Syud bin Mootluk and Shaikh Muktoom of Debaye expressed their aversion to the proposed measure, he abandoned the plan. In the early part of the ensuing year, however, when the Sohar Chief sought his assistance against the Muskat autho rities, who had seized upon his ^brother, and invaded his territories. Shaikh Sultan gave ear to the request, and finding that Syud Ghes promised, in the event of being freed from his obnoxious opponent, to aid and support the Joasmee in reco vering his lost possessions upon the Batinah Coast, as also to pay tribute, the same in amount as he had hitherto paid the Wahabee, assist ance was speedily proffered. The Joasmee troops were yet on the way, when they were met by Syud Ghes, who, having successfully resisted the convulsive efforts of the Muskat Governor to take the fort of Sohar, had driven His Excellency Syud Soweynee to retreat from the neighbourhood, and return to Muskat. The combined chiefs now proceeded at once against the fort of Shinas, and, after a stout resistance had been offered, compelled the place to capitulate on the 10th May 1850. They were equally successful in their attacks upon Ghulla and Khore Fukaun,'and having thus reduced the whole of the Batinah Coast from Merya to Cape Musseldom to a state of subjection, and come to a satisfactory understanding of the partition to be made, they both returned to their seats. 47.356 JO ASM EES. Passing over the countless intrigues which the Joasmee stooped to commit, and confining the narrative to a bare relation of the actual deeds he performed, ihe doings of Shaikh Sultan in the year 1851 can be told in a word ; he made peace with Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon, out of spite to the Wahabee, because he favoured Shaikh Muktoom more than himself. He received a remonstrance from the Ameer for effecting the alliance, ■tind replied to His Highness that, in accordance with the wishes he ex pressed, he would break off the friendship contracted,-—a promise it is needless to say he never intended to fulfil, for it was opposed to his interest to do so. He rashed to the assistance of Syud Ghes, Chief of Sohar, in his conflict with the Imaum of Muskat, according to engagement, and was deceitful enough to accept presents in gold, and forsake the cause he had faithfully promised to uphold. Such was the character of the Joasmee s proceedings during the year 1851. In the spring of the ensuing year a Ras-ool -Khyma Buggalow, when on her return to the Persian Gulf from the a. d . 1852. African Coast, and while still in the neighbour hood of Zanzibar, committed a piracy upon a vessel belonging to that port. . . . . , . The uncertain and tardy means of communication existing between the ports of Zanzibar and Bushire caused eonsiderable delay in obtain- in' the information necessary to establish the true particulars of the case, and to fix the just amount of satisfaction to be demanded from Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur; for although Captain Kembail wrote to Major Hamerton on the subject of the piracy so early as the month of June 1852, and, receiving no reply up to the 3rd of August following, again addressed him regarding it, and finally, on the 4th of February m the succeeding year, found it necessary to write a a. d. 1853. third despatch, begging to be favoured with an answer to his previous communications, it was not until the month of August 1853 that a reply from that officer reached the ebic en a Bushire ; and even then, the offending Buggalow, though owned by a native of Ras-ool-Khyma, yet being manned, as f d Kusbeeah, who arc the acknowledged subjects of H'ghne s S&gt;ud Saeed and the Joasmee Chief 'repudiating his liability t0 a « or redress in consequence. Captain Kembail, considering the arguments adduced by Shaikh Sultan to be deserving of attention, thong g to make a further reference to Major Hamerton on ,he . Sl1 ^'' a . to the close of the year, no reply having been received, the mat remained unadjusted and pending.JOASMEES. 357 During the years 1852 and 1853, Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur would seem to have laboured under feelings of extreme irritation, and have done all in his power to incur the displeasure of the British Government. Twice during the period I have mentioned was our British Agent at Shargah subjected to insults whilst residing at his post within the Joasmee dominions,—once from people of Shargah, with the connivance of its chief, a son of the Joasmee, and once from parties in the interest of the Wahabee Ameer, whom Shaikh Sultan professed his inability to control. In either case was redress demanded and afforded; but scarcely had satisfaction been given, and a reconciliation between Shaikh Sultan and the British Agent been effected, in the presence of Commodore 'Robinson, than the former addressed a letter to the Re sident, preferring a fresh set of charges against the latter, for misappro priation of monies entrusted to his care for delivery to others,— charges both vague and groundless, as was proved by the fact of his be?ng compelled to retract every particle of the accusation he had made, when called upon to furnish proof of the truth of the allegations. Again, towards the close of the year 1852, Shaikh Sultan wrote a letter to thc&gt; Resident, complaining bitterly of the manner in which he was brought to account for even the slightest case of maritime irregularity committed by his dependents, whilst the other subscribers to the truce, he said, were permitted to act with impunity, and were net remonstrated with on occasions of infraction of their engagements with the British Go vernment. The Joasmee was favoured, in reply, with a communication from Captain Kemball, completely refuting every charge of partiality he had thought fit to adduce, and proving most clearly that one and all of his insinuations were groundless. Much of this soreness of feeling was supposed to have arisen out of an ill-will borne to the British Agent, in consequence of divers disclosures he made to the Resident regarding the traffic in slaves carried on by the Joasmee's dependents. Another and far stronger cause of irritation, however, was to be attributed to an intimation conveyed to Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur by Captain Kemball, « in compliance with the orders of the Honorable the Court of Directors, that Government refused its confirmation of the arrangement he (Shaikh Sultan) proposed to Colonel Hennell, for the payment through him, instead of direct to the injured parties, of monies which might be recoveied hereafter as compensation for piracies, homicides, or other injuries sustained by his subjects.' This announcement would appear to have well nigh maddened the Joasmee. 'He was very wroth' so writes the Agent in a letter358 JOASMEES. dated 11th November 1852, some three months after the order had reached its destination, when he heard that some money exacted from Shaikh Synd bin Butye, for some people of his, who had been injured at sea, had been paid to the sufferers, and not to himself. Again so late as the month of August in the ensuing year, Hajee Yacoob complained of the unfriendliness shown him by the Joasmee, in conse quence of monies, exacted as compensation for irregularities at sea, 'being paid to the individuals aggrieved' in lieu of himself. During the absence of Shaikh Syud bin Butye, the Chief of the Boo Felasa, from his post, at Muskat, to which port he had repaired on a visit to His Highness the Imaum, Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur supported the pretensions of the sons of the late Muktoom, who dared to aspire to the chiefship. His intrigues, however, were not attended with much success. He contrived, it is true, to bribe and entice Syud bin Maanaul Moheyree to quit Debaye with his tribe, and settle at Shargah, but all his endeavours in behalf of the youthful heirs to the chiefship were utterly frustrated by an alliance, offensive and defensive, that was suddenly concluded, on the 17th December 1852, between Shaikh Syud bin Butye and the Chiefs of the Beniyas and Amulgavine Tribes. There remains but to notice the part that was played by the Joasmec during the complications that arose in the spring of 1853, between the Wahabee and Muskat authorities. The course pursued by Shaikh Sultan was as objectionable as ever. He hastened to wait upon Abdoolla bin Fysul, so soon as he heard of his arrival at Brymee ; he strove all in his power to prevent the conclusion of a peaceable arrange ment between the contending parties ; though made aware that the Resident had arrived off the coast for the purpose of meeting him, he manifested no inclination to return to his seat and wait upon him, but ' proposed to make up for his absence by appointing certain deputies to communicate with Captain Kemball in his stead,'—deputies whom, there was every reason to suppose, he had not ' vested with powers to conclude any definitive arrangement' ; he strongly counselled an immediate march upon the Batinah districts; he pointed out the defenceless condition they were in; and he succeeded in raising himself to the highest favour in the eyes of the Wahabee commander. His counsels, his plans, beyond those of the rest of the chiefs, one and all were agreeable to the wishes and desires of Abdoolla bin Fysul; and considering that a day had been fixed (so said Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon) for the march of the coalesced forces on the Imaum's dominions, matters might indeed have proved serious, had not a com bination of circumstances conspired to damp the ardour of both Joasmee and Wahabee for a recourse to hostilities. The project of an invasionJOASMEES. 359 was abandoned, and affairs were peaceably settled. Shaikh Sultan thereon returned to Shargah, and waited upon Captain Kemball on the 4th May 1853, on board the Honorable Company's sloop-of-war Clive. -That officer did not fail to upbraid him for the detention to which his protracted stay at Brymee had subjected him, and to make him fully aware how distasteful his late proceedings would be to the British Government, when they learned that it was their old and faithful ally the Tmaum of Muskat he so basely was striving to harm and injure. The subject of the new treaty for a lasting peace being brought under discussion, Shaikh Sultan exhibited considerable readiness to become a member thereto, and affixed his seal to the document without hesita tion or demur.HISTORICAL SKETCH of the UTTOOBEE TRIBE OE ARABS (BAHREIN;) FROM THE YEAR 1716 TO THE YEAR 1817. prepared by MR.

About a. d . 1716, three considerable tribes of Arabs, called the Beni Subah, A1 Yalahimah, and A1 Khaleefa, urged a. d . 171G. motives of interest or ambition, entered into a compact, and took possession of a spot of ground on the north-western shore of the Persian Gulf, called Koweit. The Beni Subah were subject at this time to Shaikh Soleyman bin Ahmed; the Beni Yalahimah to Jaubir bin Uttoobee ; and the Beni Khaleefa to Khaleefa bin Mahomed. 2 These chiefs strengthened the new settlement by intermarriages with the daughters of the other clans, with the view of being enabled by such alliances to resist the attacks of the Beni Khalid, who were a very powerful tribe. . 3. The three tribes determined to follow the occupation of merchants and agriculturists, and to share the profits equally. In the formation of an administration, it was agreed that the sons of the Bern Su a should exercise the functions of government, those of Yalahimah should superintend and control the maritime, and the Bern Khaleefa the mercantile, branch of their concerns. 4 In the course of fifty years, by a prudent and cautious po icy, e new settlement attained a very high degree ot A - D - 1766 - prosperity: but the accumulation of wealth rendered the mercantile branch desirous of seceding from the original league, that they might singly enjoy and add to their acquired nc es. 5. They were obliged to have recourse to dissimulation to ettect their purpose. Khaleefa bin Mahomed, an artful and P oUt10 0 16 ' undertook to accomplish it. He represented to the other two t p spects of wealth that presented themselves by proceeding o le of that part of the Persian Gulf the most productive of pearls, an , y forming a settlement on some contiguous spot, to conduct the fas icry themselves. Lured by the advantages thus held forth, the em Khaleefa Chief was permitted to leave Koweit, with a part of his 11 e. He accordingly passed over and settled at Zobara, on the AiabianUTTOOBEES. 363 By his talents and his treasures he soon acquired a considerable portion of the fishery, and by his prudent liberality to the neighbouring Arab Chieftains, and to those of his former associates, he drew over the rest of his own tribe to the new colony, and at length completely separated himself from the other two, and established his independence at Zobara. 6. The sons of Subah and Yalahimah discovered too late the true motives that influenced Khaleefa's conduct, but were unable to resent it. 7. The more powerful clan of the two, the A1 Subah, soon felt the absence of their commercial brethren, in a deficiency of their finances; and, following the example of their renegade brethren, first refused the Ai Yalahimah their share of the revenue, and ultimately expelled them from the port and town of Koweit. 8. The Yalahimah Tribe sought and obtained the protection of their kinsmen at Zobara, to each of whom, according to his rank, was assigned an adequate income. In a few years they renewed their claims to rights founded on their original compact, which they were not, however, in a condition to enforce. 9. Urged by necessity, and a sense of wrong, the Yalahimah quitted Zobara, and took up their residence at Raveish, a barren spot at a short distance eastward of Zobara, and turned their whole attention to the increase, equipment, and preservation of their fleet, contemplating the object of revenging themselves on their proud and perfidious neighbours. They commenced an extensive system of maritime depre dation, and, by capturing their property, created in the minds of the Beni Khaleefa fears for their existence, and such a thirst for the punishment and destruction of the Yalahimah Chief, that, adding to their own force all the mercenaries their pecuniary resources could obtain, they environed the marauders on every side. The treasures which the Yalahimah had amassed, which they were determined to defend to the last, and the feelings of animosity that existed between them, led to a desperate contest; the Yalahimah Chief having been killed at an early period of the action, the overwhelming superiority of their enemies obtained a complete victory, and a few infants and females were alone saved from the massacre that ensued. 10. Subsequently to this event, the influence and power of the Beni a. d. 1 /75-76. Khaleefa rapidly increased. They acquired an accession of wealth and respectability, on the attack of Bussoraby the Persians, at which period one of the Shaikhs of Grane retired to Zobara, witlfmany of the principal people, and ac companied by some of the Bussora merchants also. A great part of the pearl and Indian trade in consequence centered at Zobara, and at Grane, during the time the Persians occupied Bussora; and those places364 LTTOOBEES. increased in strength and consequence. This state of prosperity excited in particular the fears and jealousy of Shaikh Nassir, of the Bomeheere Tribe, who was also Shaikh of Bushire and of Bahrein, and who had been empowered by his sovereign of Persia to reduce Zobara. Repeated but ineffectual attempts were accordingly made to reduce that place between the years 1777 and 1801. 11. Availing themselves of the general warfare that prevailed in the ^ Gulf on the death of Kureem Khan, the Zobara Arabs made a descent on the island of Bahrein, and, after a short conflict, obliged Shaikh Nassir to retire to the fort: after plundering and destroying the town, they returned to Zobara, taking with them one of the Bushire gallivats that had been sent to Bahrein to receive its annual tribute to Persia. 12. In pursuance of orders from Ali Moorad Khan, Shaikh Nassir prepared an expedition against Zobara, for the destruction of his powerful rival, in which he was to be assisted by the Shaikhs of Bunder Reig, Genowa, Dushistan, &amp;c. The fleet sailed from Bushire with two thousand of the Dushistan Arabs for Bahrein, under the command of Shaikh Mahomed, Shaikh Nassir's nephew. Though deemed sufficient to attack Zobara, it appeared to be Shaikh Nassir's object to bring the Arabs to terms by blockading their port, for which purpose the Persian fleet kept constantly cruising between Zobara and Bahrein. 13. The Uttoobees, unable to oppose them, offered through Meer Gunneeh, of Bunder Reig, to restore the whole plunder taken at Bahrein, as the price of peace. That Shaikh proving unsuccessful in his negotiations, Shaikh Rashid of Julfar engaged to settle all the differ ences to the satisfaction of both parties. 14. These negotiations also failing, the Persian troops landed at Zobara to storm the fort, which they expected to reduce with little opposition. The Persians, however, had scarcely landed, when they were resolutely attacked by a force much greater than they expected, which sallied from the fort, and, after an obstinate conflict, the Persians threw down their arms, fled, and embarked on board their gallivats. Shaikh Mahomed was killed in the action, and a nephew of Shaikh Rashid's, and some men of consequence belonging to the Shaikh of Ormus. Intoxicated with their success, the want of means of transport alone prevented the. Zobara Arabs from proceeding to the attack of Bahrein. 15. The Grane* fleet, consisting of six gallivats, and a number of armed boats, arrived on the same day at Bahrein, set fire to, and plun dered the town, and obliged the force left to protect it to return to the fort. * The A1 Khaleefa, or Uttoobee Tribe of Arabs, occupy Grane.UTTOOBEES. 365 16. Shaikh Nassir, after this unsuccessful attempt, proceeded with Shaikh Rashid to Aseeloo, to re-equip a force for another attack of Zobara. The latter would appear, notwithstanding his recent inter ference as a mediator, to have taken an active part against the Uttoobees, on account of their having captured a boat of his, and put eighteen of her crew to the sword. Shaikh Nassir, however, returned to Bushire on the 12th of June, and on the 5th of August Shaikh Rashid arrived with the Persian garrison of Bahrein, which they had been under the necessity of surrendering on the 2Sth of July. 17. The A1 Subah, who had continued to increase their power and possessions at Koweit, hearing of the distress of their old confederates, prepared to relieve them. On their way to Zobara with that view, they intercepted a small fishing-boat, which had been despatched by Shaikh Nassir to his son at Bahrein, to apprise him of his defeat, charging him to be resolute and watchful in defending the island until assistance should reach him. The information was valuable, and led to their adopting prompt and decisive measures. They immediately sailed to Bahrein, and obtained possession of the principal forts. The news of this success having reached Zobara, every effort was made by the A1 Khaleefa to raise auxiliaries for the subjec tion of the island, which they soon accomplished. 18. On the conquest of Bahrein, they proceeded to reward their companions on this service. The four sons of Jaubir bin Uttoobee were among the number. These, not at all instructed, nor improved by theii habits of life, and without even the power their father appeared to possess to substantiate their claims, demanded from the Jvhaleefa Chief the enjoyment of territorial and political rights, which being refused, they left the island in disgust, and prosecuted the mode of life in which their ancestors had been bred, in which they have ever since persevered.* 19. Active preparations were still made by the Shaikhs of Julfar and Ormus to join Shaikh Nassir in another ^ D ' 1/83 ' attack of the Zobara and Grane Arabs, in which they were to be assisted by a force of six thousand men, which Ali Moorad Khan promised to furnish at the close of the year. However, every design to proceed on a second expedition appears to have been abandoned for a time. 20. Preparations for that purpose were, however, renewed in the close of the following year, and on the 12th of a. d. 17So. FebruaTy 1785 Shaikh Nassir proceeded by land to Congoon, and the Bushire and Bunder Reig fleets sailed for that place * For a continuance of their history, see' Khor Hassan,' in the latter part of this Selection.366 UTTOOBEES. on the 21st, where they were to be rejoined by the Shaikhs of Ormus and Julfar. A small force from Shiraz^had already arrived at Congoon, to join the expedition. The death of Ali Moorad Khan, however, arrested the prosecution of offensive operations against the Uttoobees. 21. The contests for the succession that ensued in the interior of Persia on that event, in which Shaikh Nassir a d 1t99 of Bushire took a part, left the Uttoobees in quiet possession of Bahrein, and no mention is made of them until the year 1799, when the Imaum of Muskat, in compliance with the wish of the Beglerbeg of Fars, proceeded with four ships and six Dows, and armed gallivats, to attack the Uttoobees, and subdue Bahrein. The Uttoobees had only three ships, which were on trading voyages to India, which were all taken, laden with merchandize, by the Imaum, on their return. 22. The Uttoobees at Bahrein wrote on this occasion to Shaikh Nassir at Bushire, stating that the island originally belonged to the Turkish Government, but that it was many (about seventy) years since they were in possession of it ; that they were now desirous of becoming subject to the King of Persia, to whom they would pay a tribute. Shaikh Nassir availed himself of this invitation, and privately proceeding to Bahrein, received the tribute for the preceding year. 28. In the year 1800, the Imaum of Muskat reduced the island of Bahrein, and sent all the head men, consisting a. d. 1800 01. twenty-five families, to Muskat. The Uttoo- bee Shaikhs proceeded to Zobara with their followers, and solicited the protection of the Wahabees, which was readily extended. In the following year, assisted by all the Wahabee dependents in the district of Khutter, the Uttoobees attacked and retook Bahrein, having forced the Imaum's governor and his son to leave the island with only their private baggage; and in consequence of the Persian Shaikhs having •assisted Syud Sultan in the reduction of Bahrein, the Uttoobees made prize of every Bussora or Persian vessel they fell in with. 24. The Uttoobee Arabs at Zobara became at this period, in common with every tribe on the Arabian shore of the Gulf, under the control of the Wahabee power. They would appear, however, to have been at war with the Muskat Arabs since Syud Sultan lost his life in an engagement with the Uttoobes, joined by the Joasmees. 25. It is difficult to trace the varying policy of the different tribes in the Gulf, influenced as they were, at a period a. d . 1804-05. unsettled, by those changes which affected their interests. In 1805 we find the Uttoobees promoting a plan projected by Syud Beder, the Imaum of Muskat, to destroy the Joas- mecs, and to throw off the Wahabee yoke. Captain Seton expressedUTTOOBEES. 367 an opinion on this occasion, ' that this coalition would succeed, and ought to be encouraged, as the Wahabee, in gaining the ascendancy, would order the Muskatees to plunder every vessel they met, as the Uttoobees and Joasmees had been obliged to do.' 26. Orders having been issued by the British Government for the attack of the Joasmee vessels in the Gulf, the Shaikhs of Zobara and Grane required information in respect to the nature of those instruc tions, as they were aware of the outrages committed on our trade by the Wahabees ; and the Uttoobees being their subjects, they wished to know if the Government had included them in the orders in question. They explained that the Wahabee Shaikh was daily pressing them to proceed on a piratical cruise to India; that they had evaded a compliance with his wishes, and that he had received their excuses, as the Wahabees had not the power of compelling them to join in their plans, for want of a naval force, and for fear of inducing them to retire from Zobara to Bahrein ; but as the Wahabee had set aside the Chief of the Joasmees and established his own officers in the Seer principality, they were apprehensive that they should be obliged to join in their piratical schemes. 1 hese Shaikhs required a direct answer whether, in the event of then- retiring from the main, and withdrawing themselves from the Wahabee allegiance, the British Government would lend them such support as would enable them to remain undisturbed at Bahrein,—the greatest assistance they would require would be a vessel or two for a short time. 27. Captaip Seton urged in strong terms the advantages of sueh a eonneetion, in seeming the futare tranquillity of the Gulf. Their situation on one side of the Joasmees, and that of Muskat on the other held out every prospeot of effectually cheeking this new and pernicious system, arising out of the avarice and fanaticism of a desperate tribe in the centre of Nujd, who, reducing their neighbours to poverty and misery, have made them the unwilling instruments of their robberies and piracies; that it would be supposing the British Government had lost sight of those generous principles that had heretofore actuated their policy, to imply a doubt that they would step forward to rescue from such abominable slavery those who by their trade had so lon&lt;T encouraged their Indian produce and manufactures ; that it would be imagining the British Government to be blind toils own interests to conceive that it would allow these traders to be drawn into a state of actual robbery and piracy, preying on their own subjects and allies without an effort to prevent it. 28. Cpatain Seton explained on this occasion that the Uttoobees carrying on a brisk trade direct from Bahrein to India, without touching at Muskat, and thus evading the half duties paid by the other States in368 UTTOOBEES. the Gulf to Muskat, induced Syud Sultan to attack Bahrein in 1800; that compelled by that attack to seek the protection of the Wahabees, they had suffered so much from their tyranny, that of late the Uttoobees had endeavoured to conciliate the Muskat Government, had frequented the port, and paid duties, as other States. The Imaum had also on every occasion shown them a preference, and encouraged them; and that the only obstacle that opposed the conclusion of a solid agreement between the Uttoobee Arabs and those of Muskat was the want of a guarantee, who would secure the due performance of it on both sides. 29. The Bombay Government entertaining doubts as to how far the Persians would be equally disposed to come into such a plan as the Imaum of Muskat, abstained from all interference. 30. The Uttoobees manifested the same disposition, when the Wahabee Shaikh, having established his influ ence over the Joasmees and Muskat, was urging them to proceed against Grane and Bussora, which they declined. 31. The Wahabees in 1810 assumed the government of Bahrein and Zobara, and appointed Abdoollabin Oofeysan a. d. 1810-11. Vukeel over those places, together with the district of Kateef, and the whole of the Khutter district. &amp;2. The Uttoobees continued in administration of the island ; they were, however, obliged to pay tribute to the Vukeel, who was placed at Bahrein to convert the Uttoobees to the Wahabee faith. 33. The successful progress of the Turkish troops under Ibrahim Pacha having obliged Abdoollabin Saood to collect his adherents and his troops, the garrisons of Zobara and Bahrein were reduced. The Imaum seized this opportunity of attacking those places; the former was burnt, and, landing on the latter place, the Wahabee Vukeel, Oofeysan, was made prisoner, and the Uttoobees recovered possession of the island. 34. In 1811 a desperate action would appear to have been fought by the Uttoobees and Rahmah bin Jaubir, who A .. D ' was in connection with the Wahabees, in which the Uttoobees were victorious. 35. In 1813 we find the Uttoobees of Bahrein offering to co -operate with a fleet of from fifteen to twenty sail, and a. d . 1812-13. two t j lousan( j m en, in an expedition which the Imaum contemplated against Eas -ool-Khyma, and proposed to join His Highness at the port of the Heza Arabs, a little to the eastward o Aboothabee, and between it and Ras -ool-Khyma. 36. Mr. Bruce having proceeded to Bahrein, for the purpose o ascertaining * more correctly the engagements a. d. 1814-15. and views tlie Arabs of Bahrein and the Joas- mees had towards the Imaum, who was on his way with a gUTTOOBEES. * 369 expedition to reduce those Arabs to his allegiance, arrived at that island on the 19th of July. He was received with marked kindness by Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed, who was fully prepared to oppose any native force the Imaum might bring against him. Mr. Bruce looked upon it as fortunate his having visited the island, for he found the impression which the Imaum had made on the minds of the tribe against us to be so great, and had impressed them with such a thorough belief that we had determined to take up his cause, and support him to the utmost in our power, that, from the full conviction that we should seize all their vessels if they visited our ports, they were deli- beiating upon joining the Joasmee pirates as a mode of existence ; which was thus fortunately prevented. ' Shaikh Abdoolla, in explain ing the cause of dispute between him and the Imaum, said that Syud Saeed had broken his treaty with them, and that in the most faithless way ; that he never wished to be upon any terms but the most friendly with the State of Muskat, nor had he or any of his tribe ever done anything contrary to this view; that the Syud had seized fifteen sail of his vessels, richly laden, from India, and that at a time when they supposed him most friendly towards them, as they had only put into Muskat on the faith of the Syud's own letter to Shaikh Abdool Rahman, in charge of the fleet, when off the port; that not content with this, he had written to the Wahabee Chief privately, saying, if he would march down and attack Bahrein from the main, he would do so by sea with his vessels,—that this very letter had been sent to him by the Wahabee Chief, with offers of any kind of assistance he required, to sup port him against the Imaum, and that he had availed himself of these offers, which the Imaum's conduct had compelled him to do, particularly as Rahmah bin Jaubir was the person who had joined the Imaum, and who he intended to put in charge of the island if he should conquer it; but in this he trusted in God he would not succeed, as he was fully prepared to receive His High ness with any force he could bring ; that he had 7,000 men at present under arms, and could procure from the Wahabee Chief as many more as he might require ; that Shakboot, of the Beniyas Tribe, as well as the different chiefs on the Persian shore, had refused to join the Syud, who, in consequence, had applied to the prince at Shiraz to furnish him with troops ; but at this he was not alarmed. He then asked in a direct manner in which light was he to look towards us, friends or enemies. On Mr. Brace's saying, why should he doubt our being fiiends, he replied that the Syud had given out we had taken up his cause, and intended to join him with four or five ships, to assist in reducing tho island , that he w r as not conscious of ever having - done anything towards us, contrary to the strictest rules of friendship, or370 UTTOOBEES. would they ever do so ; that he was exceedingly happy Mr. Brace had arrived, as he was on the eve of sending over to Bushire, to ascertain if there was any truth in the Imaum's reports ; that if we did intend to assist him, he confessed candidly he was not able to cope with us ; but as for any native power, he was not alarmed ; that his ports were ever open, and should continue so to us, and every aid at all times rendered to our vessels, whenever they should arrive ; and asked if we would allow his vessels to continue to visit India on the terms they had hitherto done. On Mr. Bruce replying certainly, he was overjoyed, and said he now did not care anything for the Imaum, as this was the most he had at heart. He said the Imaum had always given out that it was owing to his intercessions we allowed the Arab States to visit India. To convince him the more fully of our friendly disposition, Mr. Bruce said he would, although not authorised by Government, draw out a few articles of agreement, which we would exchange, and had no doubt but that they would be approved of, and be sanctioned by the British Government. He was highly satisfied with this. He then informed Mr. Bruce that the Wahabee Chief had directed a large force to march against Muskat by land, under command of one of his brothers, which would compel the Imaum to return; that then he should fit out all his vessels and boats, and proceed to blockade Muskat; and that he might rely on the strictest orders being given to his boats to respect the British flag in the highest degree, from a ship to the smallest boat. He hoped hereafter our vessels would frequent Bahrein more than we bad hitherto done | that there was a great field open to us, as they had hitherto received a great portion of their Indian goods through Muskat, which we could now furnish them direct by our own ships,— particularly the article of rice, several ship loads of which 'v^eie annu ally required for the interior of Arabia, and which went all from Bahrein, and came via Muskat.' 37. Mr. Bruce represented the Beni Attaba Arabs of Bahrein to be a very strong and powerful body of maritime Arabs, who carry on a very extensive traffic with India, and who have alvva^ys been 'very peaceably inclined, preferring commerce to a predatory life, but which they were on the verge of falling into, from the late extiaoidinary proceedings of the Imaum of Muskat. 38. That from the account of Bahrein, the Government would be able to appreciate the necessity of keeping on terms of friendship withits in habitants, when such an extensive mart for commerce and speculation was held out, and when the balance of trade was so much in our favour, we only supplying the produce of our soil and labour for specie and pearls. 39. The Imaum was at this time on his way to the attack of Bahrein ;49 TJTTOOBEES. 371 and in a letter to the British Government stated that he was urged to the measure by the Uttoobees having joined the pirates, and acknow ledged themselves subject to the Wahabees. His Highness added, ' that when that power reduced the island, the Uttoobees sought an asylum at Muskat, and surrendered their country to him. Under that assurance, he went forth with his fleet and army, and wrested the country from the possession of the Wahabees, and gave the Uttoobees a place of abode in it, on their engaging to remain subject to his aUfffbrity ; but they had broken the treaty with him, and joined the Wahabees a second time,' 40. A few days after Mr. Bruce left Bahrein, His Highness arrived at the island. The troops landed at Arad, # and commenced an attack, with some prospect of success, but ultimately experienced a signal defeat, with great loss, two of his relations and principal Sirdars being killed on the occasion. 41. The Imaum, after this defeat, proceeded to Congoon with the whole of his fleet, for the purpose of taking on board a reinforcement of troops which the Prince of Shiraz had engaged to furnish, on condition of the Imaum's engaging to defray their expense, and to pay an annual Peshkush should the troops embark and the expedition be abandoned, but if they landed and reduced Bahrein, the Imaum was to pay 10.000 Tomans annually to the Government of Shiraz. 42. The expedition was abandoned, the Imaum discovering that the ini/ . Government of Persia had been actuated by mo- A. D. 1816. . • , , . . tives of treachery, and contemplated his seizure, and that of the different Arab Chiefs, and carrying them off to Shiraz. 43. In the following year Mr. Bruce represented the Chief of Bahrein to be affording' the fullest and most A. D. I8l/. n- • • i • i • . effective aid m his power, in grain and stores of all kinds, to the Joasmees, who hourly frequented the ports of the island, and that the piratical boats kept up a constant communication with Bahrein, to which place they conveyed all the property they captured, great portions of which finds its way across to Bushire and the other ports on the Persian side of the Gulf, by the Grane boats which trade to the island. 44. The subsequent unfriendly conduct of the Shaikh of Bahrein, when he defied our power, is entirely irreconcilable with the friendly spirit that distinguished it on his interview with Mr. Bruce. The encouragement and protection which the pirates met with at that port, in the reception and disposal of their plunder, are subjects of further representation by the Resident at Bushire. 45. Mr. Bruce remarked that the pirates not only experienced a * An island separated from Bahrein by a narrow channel for boats.372 UTTOOBEES. ready mart for their plundered property at Bahrein, but purchased, ■with the proceeds, supplies of dates and rice, and of all kinds of stores necessary for their vessels, which were brought to Bahrein in abundance by the ships belonging to Arab owners residing at Bombay. 46. That it was impossible under these circumstances to look on Bahrein in any other light than that of a piratical port ; for although they may not individually commit piracies in their own vessels, the assistance they afford to those freebooters operates to the same end, and, in fact, considerable numbers of the crews of the pirate boats are actually com posed of the inhabitants of that island, who proceed to Ras-ool-Khyma, and enter on board for a cruise. If successful, they return to their homes; if not, they continue there until their avarice is satisfied. CONTINUATION OF THE FOREGOING SKETCH, TO THE YEAR 1831, BY LIEUTENANT S. HENNELL. Mr. 'Warden terminates his account of this tribe in a. d . 1817, by alluding to the opinion entertained by Mr. Bruce, that although not actively engaged in piracy themselves, they could be looked upon in no other light than as piratical, as they were the receivers and purchasers of a great portion of the property plundered by the Joasmees, and not only gave them free access to their ports, but supplied them with all kinds of provisions and warlike stores. Notwithstanding the signal defeat experienced by the Imaum in his attack upon this island, the Uttoobees were kept for some time in a state of suspense, in consequence of His Highness proceeding with his fleet to Congoon, to wait for the reinforcements promised him by the Shiraz Government, for the purpose of making a second attempt. But their apprehensions were subsequently removed by the arrival of a messenger by name Sikundur Khan, who was sent over by that Court to Bahrein, to offer terms to the Shaikhs, which they agreed to, and, in return for the presents which they sent, were presented with honorary dresses by the Prince of Fars. In the month of February 1819, a report having been received that several Indian women had been brought from a. d . 1819. Kas-ool-Khyma, and publicly sold in the bazar of Bahrein, Captain Lock, of His Majesty's Ship Eden, in company with five vessels of war, proceeded to that island, to procure their liberation. After some negotiation, the Bahrein Shaikh succeeded in convincing theUTTOOBEES. 373 British authorities that the report was without foundation, and entered into an agreement with Captain Lock, by which he bound himself down to prevent the sale of captured British property in his territory,—to which engagement it appears, however, from subsequent accounts, he did not pay the slightest attention. At Captain Lock's request, he opened a communication with Hussein bin Rahmah, the Chief of Ras-ool- Khyma, offering on the part of the British Government the release of a number of Joasmee prisoners, in exchange for several females who had been captured by the pirates. This proposal was finally agreed to, and seventeen Indian women were thus restored to liberty. On the 17th January 1820, after the capture of Ras-ool-Khyma, and the destruction of the Joasmee fleet, bv the 1 QOr\ * expedition under 8ir W. G, Keir, the Shaikh of Bahrein delivered up the vessels belonging to the piratical powers which were in his harbour, to Captain Lock, of His Majesty's shipj^ew, for the purpose of being destroyed ; and at the same time entered into an agreement not to admit any boats of the above description into his port until permitted by the British Government. The General Treaty between the British Government and the Arabian Chiefs, negotiated by General Keir, was first signed in Ras-ool-Khyma by the Vukeel of the Uttoobee Shaikhs, and subsequently by themselves in Bahrein. Influenced, probably, by the general impression conveyed by the success of the British troops, and the increased degree of confidence acquired by the Imaum from his co-operation with them, the A1 Kha- ieefa (Shaikhs of Bahrein) deemed it prudent to take measures to avert the attack preparing by His Highness, in conjunction with the Prince of Shiraz, against their island. They accordingly sent an Agent to Muskat, who concluded an agreement, by which they bound them selves to pay His Highness 30,000 German crowns per annum; both parties, however, stipulating for the guarantee of the British Govern ment, which does not appear to have been afforded. In return. His Highness engaged to release some of the Uttoobee Shaikhs detained by him, and restore all the vessels and property, belonging to Bahrein, which he had put under an embargo, on their way up from India. Of this tribute the sum of 12,000 crowns was subsequently remitted. In April 1822, an Agent of the Bahrein Chief made a verbal request, a d lq0Q on the part of his superiors, that the British Government would mediate an adjustment of the dispute between them and Rahmah bin Jaubir, on the principle of status quo ante helium. This was acceded to, and instructions to the effect were issued to the Resident at Bushire, with a strict reservation, however, that the Government was not to be pledged in any way to enforce the fulfilment of the conditions. Shortly after Shaikh Abdoolla374 UTTOOBEES. bin Ahmed proceeded to Bassadore, but, from the unreasonable expecta tions of himself and Rahmah bin Jaubir, the Acting Political Agent failed in settling their dispute. About the end of this year a Buteel belonging to a Bahrein merchant was taken in Bussora river by His Britannic Ma- jesty's ship Sophia, on a charge of piracy commit ted on a Bushire boat. The Buteel and crew were carried to Bombay, but the charge of piracy not being considered as substantiated in the Re corder's Court, she was released, together with the crew, and an ex planation of the circumstances afforded to the Chief of Bahrein, who however disavowed the proceedings of the vessel in question. In February 1824, Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed made up his quarrel with Rahmah bin Jaubir (through the mediation a d 1824 of the Resident in the Persian Gulf), upon several conditions, among which it was stipulated that the Bahrein Chief should be permitted to chastise the Aboosemate Tribe, which had fled from his territory, and taken refuge at Demaum, without any interfer ence on the part of Shaikh Rahmah in their favour. Shaikh Mahomed bin Shakboot, the brother of Shaikh Tahnoon, failing in his endeavours to obtain the assistance of the Mohariba Tribe in renewing his attack on Aboothabee, sought the protection of the Shaikh of Bahrein, and took up his residence in Huailah, which is within the territories of the Uttoobee Chief, but over which he has little control. In the beginning of 1824, a report was made by the Resident that he had received information of a piracy having been committed on a boat from Debaye (a town in strict alliance with Shaikh Tahnoon bin Shakboot), by Mahomed bin Shakboot. This proceeding appeared to the Resident in the Persian Gulf to call for immediate notice and chastisement, and he accordingly required Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed, as the ostensible superior of Huailah, to take steps for this purpose, and offered the use of the squadron in the Gulf to co-operate if he found himself unable to do so alone. The Government, in its reply to the report, expressed its opinion that it would have been better to make further inquiries into the affair before offering the use of the marine force against Huailah, and at the same time detailed the reasons which made the case in question come rather under the description of a feud for supremacy than a case of piracy. The whole account of the trans action, however, was subsequently reported to be entirely without foundation. In 1825, Salmin bin Nassir, the elder brother of Shaikh Abdoolla, died, and was succeeded in his property and political a. d . 18-5. influence by his eldest son. Shaikh Khaleefa, who in consequence shared the net revenue of the island in equal propor-UTTOOBEES. 375 tions with his uncle. Notwithstanding this arrangement, the executive power and transaction of all public business still remained in the hands of Shaikh Abdoolla, although the concurrence of his nephew to every act of the Government was considered necessary. An attempt, made at this time by the Resident, to effect a reconciliation between the Aboosemate Tribe and their former chief (the Governor of Bahrein), was unsuccessful. Information having been received in Bombay that His Highness the Imaum proposed supporting the claims of the sons of the late Shaikh to the supreme authority in Bahrein, and that he intended to take advantage of the first favourable opportunity to seize the island for himself, a strong letter of advice was addressed to His Highness by the Governor, in which, after pointing out the evils likely to arise from such a line of conduct, he was earnestly dissuaded from interfering in anv way in the actual disputes of that, island as long as other powers abstained from doing so. In the latter end of this year a Bahrein boat, on her way to Muskat, was attacked by two Shargah vessels near Anjar, and not only plundered of a considerable quantity of dollars, but three of her crew put to death. Although Shaikh Abdoolla did not prefer any complaint himself on this occasion, it was thought necessary by the British authority that imme diate and active notice should be taken of it; and preparations were accordingly made to enforce satisfaction, by blockading the port of Shargah. This vigorous measure had the desired effect, and an arrangement was made by the Joasmee Chief, which fully satisfied the Governor of Bahrein. In August 1825 the Resident at Mocha reported to the Government, that some delay having taken place in that town in settling a claim of 400 dollars preferred against certain traders by the Nakhoda of a Bahrein Buggalow, that person had boarded by night a Mocha vessel lying in the harbour, and, after wounding one man, and binding thWest of the crew, had carried oil twenty bags of coffee, belonging to the Company's broker. This case being referred to the British authority in the Persian Gulf, he reported that the Buggalow in question having put into Muskat on her way back. His Highness the Imaum had compelled the Nakhoda to give up the property taken, which had been restored to the proper owner. About the commencement of 1826 Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed was a d 1896 nearly involved in a serious quarrel with Shaikh Tahnoon of Aboothabee, in consequence of his having permitted some of the subjects of the Beniyas Chief to settle in Biddah, and from thence harass the trade of Aboothabee. On being37G UTTOOBEES. applied to on the subject by the Resident, he disavowed their proceed ings, and stated they had left his territories, but that he would seize them if they ever returned. Nearly at the same time as the above occurrence, the ill-will so long subsisting between the Uttoobee Shaikh and Rahmah bin Jaubir came to an open rupture, in consequence of three men belonging to the latter being put to death by the inhabitants of Bahrein, on a suspicion of their having endeavoured to set fire to the town. In retaliation of this proceeding, Rahmah seized a Bahrein boat, put one of the crew to death, and threw two others overboard. The presence of the English cruisers (stationed off Demaum for the protection of the trade of Kateef from the aggressions of Shaikh Rahmah), however, prevented the two chiefs from carrying on regular hostilities against each other, and as they were not prepared for active warfare (Rahmah on account of the smallness of his force, and the Uttoobee Shaikh owing to his apprehen sions for the safety of his trading vessels then absent in India), they were both well satisfied with the arrangement, and were proportionably alarmed on the removal of our vessels of war, agreeably to the orders of the Bombay Government. An attempt was made by both parties to have a truce for some time proclaimed, but the British authority declined interfering in any measures that did not tend to the re-establishment of general tranquillity. Hostilities were accordingly carried on until the end of 1826, when Shaikh Rahmah's Buggalow was attacked by a Bahrein vessel of equal size. After a desperate action of some hours, finding that he had no chance of success or escape. Bin Jaubir set fire to his magazine, and blew up himself, vessel, and crew. In the month of May 1827, a daring act of piracy was committed on a Bushire Buteel oft' Gunowa, while on her way to Bunder Dillum with passengers and treasure, by an individual of the Monasir Tribe, named Obed or Abdoolla bin Mohunnah, who had lately taken up his residence in Biddah, under the protection of Abdoolla bin Ahmed, the Chief of Bahrein. Several of the people on board the Buteel were put to death, and the remainder, after being completely stripped, were landed on the Persian Coast near Bordakhan. Every exertion was made to trace and seize the perpetra tors of this outrage, as well as to recover the plundered property, but with little success. The principal actors in it were ascertained to be the individual above mentioned, and Hussein bin Jassim, a native of Bahrein; and subsequently a small portion of the stolen goods was found in that island, and restored to the owners. To our demands for the seizure and surrender of the above two individuals, Shaikh Abdoolla replied that it was not in his power to do so, as they had fled from his territories,—which was really the case.UTTOOBEES. 377 The British authority, however, did not cease his exertions and a, d . 1828. inquiries, and availed himself of the opportunity afforded, in a personal interview with the Bahrein Chief in April 1828, to point out the necessity of his doing everything in his power to bring the notorious characters before alluded to to v condign punishment. The Boo Ayen Tribe, residing in Biddah, having in May 1828 displayed symptoms of a refractory spirit on the occasion of their Chief, Mahomed bin Khamees, being placed in confinement by the Uttoobee Shaikh, for stabbing an inhabitant of Bahrein, the latter caused their fort to be destroyed, and all the inhabitants to be removed to Rowees and Fowarah, where they were more immediately under his control. Some time before this arrangement took place, the notorious characters Sooedan bin Zaal and Syf bin Thykhan, already mentioned as having fled from Shaikh Tahnoon's authority, and taken refuge with the Uttoobee Chief, left Biddah, and returned to their old residence in Aboothabee. In the month of September 1828, Obed bin Mohunnah, the chief of the pirates who committed the outrage on the Bushire Buteel in 1827, again put to sea in a large boat, with a number of followers. After taking out the cargo of two or three small vessels near Bahrein, he proceeded over to the Persian Coast near Zecrah, where he landed,' for the purpose of making inquiries regarding the destination of a small Buggalow, then at anchor : but the suspicions of the natives beino- excited by a report of his boat being filled with armed men, he was taken prisoner, after a desperate resistance. The crew of his vessel chiefly composed of the Monasir, Tribe, finding their chief detained,' made the best of their way over to the neighbourhood of Aboothabee, on the Arabian Coast, plundering on their way four Aseeloo boats of' all ^-their pearls and cargoes near Seer Beniyas, for which aggression, how- ever, full compensation was subsequently afforded by Shaikh Tahnoon. Obed bin Mohunnah was detained some days in Zeerah, and after wards sent to Bushire at the request of the political authority, where a strict examination having been set on foot, he was satisfactorily identified as the person who planned and executed the attack upon Bin Musharee's Buteel in 1827. A short time afterwards, on an application being made by Shaikh Abdool Russool for the prisoner to be given up to him, to answer for the murder and plunder of his subjects^ he was delivered over to that personage by the Acting Resident, and would probably have met with the punishment his crime so well merited, had he not been enabled to effect his escape in the confusion attend ing the storm and plunder of Bushire by Prince Timor Mirza in November 1828.UTTOOBEES. The reports et tlie Iraaum's preparations for the attack of Bahrein havin^ now become very prevalent, the chief of that place applied all his energies to meet the impending storm, and spared no exertions to place himself in the best posture of defence Ins resources would •ulmit The small and middling sized vessels were ranged round Mnharag, the large Buggalows collected together in the Khore of Fasht the forts repaired, and large reinforcements of Arabs, both horse and foot, brought in from all quarters. The chief source of the Uttoo- bee Shaikh's alarm was the circumstance of Shaikh Tahnoon joining the Imaum against him ; and he endeavoured, both by large presents and earnest entreaties, to induce that chief to remain neutral,-appa. rently without effect, although subsequent events afford every reason o believe that it was treachery on the part of tie emyas 1C ia ■caused the failure of His Highness' enterprise. After being consider ably scattered by a violent gale on the 27th October, His Highness fleet entered Bahrein harbour on the 31st, and cast anchor off Sutra, outside the Khore of Killa. Khaleefa bin Sultman, the nephew of the Bahrein Shaikh, immediately proceeded with a body of troops, and look post opposite to His Highness' vessels, and subsequently a second party under the command of the governor's son, was sent to support flm After remaining there .three days without any active operations he received orders to take up a position near Horah' to the east of Munama. During the first four days after their arrival the Imanms people were employed in opening the passage of the Khore of killa which had been blocked up by means of sunken boats filled with stones This being effected, two small vessels and eleven Buggalows entered but before anything more,decisive was attempted an effort was made by the Chief of Makulla, Shuheer, to induce Abdoolla bin Ahmed to agree to such arrangements as would ^ blood.

The alleged immediate cause of the defeat appears to. have been a sudden charge made on the flank and rear of the Muskat army by the Bahrein horse, which, at the commencement of the action, had been concealed in some contiguous date groves. The Beniyas were the first to give the example of flight, and they are said to have turned their arms against their own allies, and not only plundered them, but occasioned a considerable loss of lives, by prevent ing the fugitives from saving themselves in their boats. His Highness was carried off the field by his Nubians, but was obliged to swim a considerable distance before he was taken up, and while in the water received a spear wound in the sole of his foot. At the sight of this unexpected repulse, an universal panic seems to have'seized the whole fleet, which immediately weighed and sailed out of the harbour, leaving' behind a brig and a Buggalow, which in the confusion were run ashore, and fell into the enemy's hands. ^The Buggalow was subse quently got oft by the Uttoobees, but the brig, having been stripped of everything on board by that tribe, was set on fire during tlie night by some of the Imaum's people. His Highness in this disastrous affair is said to have lost upwards of five hundred men, and appears to have quite sunk under the failure ; for after making several ineffectual attempts to conclude a peace with the Bahrein Shaikhs, he sailed on the 21st November with all his fleet for Muskat, to the great joy of the Uttoobees, and the infinite discredit of himself. His Highness appears to have displayed throughout the whole affair an absence of decision, energy, judgment, and skill. The check which he had sustained', though not a trifling one, was certainly not of sufficient consequence to induce him to abandon so suddenly this long cherished project, in which his interest and fame were so deeply committed, and the only conclusion that can, therefore, be come to on the subject, is that he must have had some hidden reasons for taking such a precipitate step, arising either from the want of union in the various tribes composing his force, or the treachery of some of the chiefs immediatelv about him. ■ ' ^ The Bahrein Shaikhs were no sooner satisfied that His Highness had a. d. 1829, dropped all further ideas of invading their island, than they determined to become the assailants in ' their turn, and accordingly made preparations for the equipment of a ; fleet of seven large vessels, which subsequently sailed' on the 21st March 1829, under the personal command of Shaikh' Abdoolla bin Ahmed, in the direction of Muskat, for the purpose of cruising against the Imaum's territories. Two frigates were sent out by His Highness to meet the Bahrein fleet, and on their way up, falling in with the 50 ; ■ . ' • ^ : ;380 UTTOOBEES. Uttoobee Buggalow called the Syar, they made an unsuccessful attempt to capture her, and finally returned to Muskat without doing anything. If, however, they gained no great credit by their conduct on this occasion, the Bahrein vessels did not distinguish themselves by their superior bravery. On their way down the Gulf, they met a large Buggalow, belonging to their inveterate enemy the Shaikh of Aseeloo, but after several hours hard fighting were all beaten off, and the Buggalow reached her own port in safety. After cruising some time in the neighbourhood of Muskat, the Bahrein fleet attacked and captured a Bu gg alow belonging to Morbat, a place between Muskat and Mocha, in no way connected with the Imaum. With this prize they set out on their return to Bahrein, but when off Cape Moobaruk they were inter- cepted by two of Syud Saeed's ships of war. The Uttoobees immediately ran into shoal water, and placing the Morbat vessel in such a position as to shelter them from the cannon of the Imaum's frigates, they first transferred to their own Buggalow everything on board, and then, having scuttled and sunk her, they took advantge of the darkness of the n icrht to alter their course, and, having by this means evaded the Muskat men-of-war, reached Bahrein shortly after. During this period, the British authority had been using every exer tion to induce the belligerents to settle their quarrel; but the Bahrein Chief declared he would make no peace that did not receive the guarantee of the British Government. As this of course was out of the question, and finding Shaikh Abdoolla deaf to all advice, the Resident declined interfering any further. While, however, the correspondence for the termination of hostilities between Muskat and Bahrein was carrying on, the political authority in the Gulf was engaged in another discussion with Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed, which gradually assumed a serious aspect. Jt will be recol lected that when the Bahrein fleet was cruising off Muskat, it captured, plundered, and destroyed a vessel belonging to Morbat. As this was considered an act of piracy in every point of view, the captor was peremptorily called upon to return all his ill-gotten booty,—a demand which he evaded, on various pretexts, for a considerable period, until the Resident sent over two vessels of war, and stated explicitly, that if immediate attention was not paid to his demand for the cargo of the captured vessel, strong and unpleasant measures would be forthwith carried into operation. This menace produced considerable effect: property to the amount of Rs. 8,000 (being all that was not converted into cash and distributed) was given up, and a considerable quantity ot o-oods belonging to people residing in Bahrein restored to the owners. On this occasion a reference was made by the British authoiity to t e Government, as to whether further proceedings should be adopted to com-UTTOOBEES. 381 pel the Bahrein Shaikh to pay in cash for such part of the plundered cargo as was not forthcoming ; and at the same time it was stated, that to effect this object it would be necessary to blockade the port with four ships of war, and perhaps to destroy the shipping by means of shells and Con- greve rockets, for which latter purpose asmall vessel would be required. The Government, however, satisfied with the redress already obtained, determined to take no further steps in the affair. On the 2nd December 1829, peace was concluded between the Chief of Bahrein and the Imaum of Muskat, through the mediation of Shaikh Mahomed bin Nassir, upon the terms that the tribute formerly paid by the Uttoobees to His Highness was to cease from henceforward ; that no interference whatever should take place in each other's concerns, but that in the event of either JMuskat or Bahrein being threatened by an enemy, mutual assistance was to be afforded. This last condition was not reduced to writing, being merely verbal. Shaikh Tahnoon was admitted as a party to the treaty, but the Aboosemate Tribe (princi pally residing in Aseeloo) was specially excluded bv the Uttoobee Shaikh. Everything appears to have gone on quietly in the island of Bahrein A p 2330 until the end of 1830, when Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed was called upon by the Wahabee Chief to pay the annual Zukat or tithe, besides 40,000 German crowns, the alleged value of a number of horses left under his charge by the Waha- bees many years previous. A demand was at the same time made for the surrender of the fort of Demaum to Busheer, the son of Rahmah bin Jaubir. Aware how gladly His Highness the Imaum would join Shaikh a. d . 1831. loorkey with his fleet, in any attack upon Bahrein, the Uttoobee Chief endeavoured to in terest the British authority in the Persian Gulf in his favour; but finding that the Government were determined not to interfere in his internal affairs, he despatched a near relation to Riaz, to wait upon the Wahabee Shaikh, and make the most favourable terms in his power. After some discussion, it was arranged that the supremacy of Shaikh Toorkey bin Saood should be acknowledged, and the Zukat paid by the Uttoobees, in return for which he promised them his protection, thus if bond fide in his professions, putting an effectual termination to the designs of the Imaum upon their territory. The Uttoobee Chiefs, however, at the present time still continue to entertain suspicions as to the ultimate views entertained by Shaikh Toorkey bin Abdoolla oos Saood regarding them. The recent establish ment of Busheer, the son of their late enemy Rahmah bin Jaubir, upon Demaum, under the sanction and authority of the Wahabee Shaikh, has382 UTTOOBEES. given them great offence, which has not been diminished by the cir cumstance of Busheer having been joined by the larger portion of the Aboosemate Tribe, between which and the Uttoobees a most inveterate feud still subsists. FURTHER CONTINUATION OF THE PRECEDING, 'to THE YEAR 1844, BY LIEUTENANT A. B. KEMBALL. We learn from the termination of Captain Hennell's Sketche?, that the establishment of Busheer, the son of Rahmah bin Jaubir, at Demaum, through the influence of the Wahabee Chief and the Imaum of Muskat, had given great offence to the Uttoobee?, which was aggra vated by the accession to the number of that chief's dependents of the larger portion of the Aboosemate Tribe, with whom they (the Uttoobees) were at feud. The views of the patrons of Busheer appear to have been,—of the former, that his proximity to Bahrein would act as a check to the Uttoobees, and lead to the more punctual fulfilment of their engagement to pay annual tribute ; of the latter, that he should have a useful and devoted adherent in the event of his again undertaking the attack of Bahrein. The attempt (in January 1832) however failed, and Busheer having quarrelled with the inhabitants of Kateef, des- a, d. 1832. troyed the fort he had just built, and left with his dependents for Muskat,—an event which was looked upon with the greatest satisfaction by the authorities in the Gulf, as removing one cause of continued disputes and misunderstandings in these quarters. The piracy of a trifling nature, as having been unattended with any aggravated circumstances, committed in November 1831, in Hallilah Bay, by a person named Hussoom of Fowarah (a dependency of Bahrein), on a fishing-boat belonging to Congoon, was now traced. The boat was recovered, and subsequently restored to its owners, and the pirate denied refuge on the Arabian Coasf. It appeared that, on leaving Hallilah Bay, Hussoom proceeded to Ajeer, where he attempted to sur prise a Bahrein boat, but the crew being upon their guard, he was taken prisoner, together with eight of his people. After a detention of several days in Ajeer, the prisoners contrived to effect their escape, and pro ceeded to Huailah, where the captured boat was recovered from the pirate, and he with his people refused admittance into that or any other 1 port of the Bahrein dominions.UTTOOBEES. 383 Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed, who with his sons Moobaruk and Nas- a o 1833 S ^ r rema ^ ne ^ ^ or a length of time at his pos sessions on the Guttur Coast, to watch the pro ceedings of the Wahabees, now made up his mind to refuse allegiance to them, and to retaliate all attempts at aggression. His first step was'to endeavour to induce the Imaum of Muskat, which he did successfuHy, to pledge'himself not to interfere in the event of hostilities breaking out between Bahrein and Shaikh Toorkey, and the next to confederate-the neighbouring Arab Tribes who were inclined to fall into his views and designs of opposition to the extension of Wahabee authority, and induce them, by money and promises, to make incuTsions into all parts of their territories. He secretly instigated the Amayir Tribe, who, quarrelling with Shaikh Toorkey, left the neighbourhood of Kateef, and taking up their position in Demaum, established a very close blockade of the former port, plundering all vessels that attempted to enter, and putting to death all inhabitants of Kateef found on board any boats whatever. At this time a gross insult was offered to the British Government in a. d. 1834. i he person of its Native Agent, by the sons of Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed. The cause of dispute would appear to have been a sum of money due by the Agent, on account of some mercantile transactions, to the Shaikh himself, which his sons were desirous of possessing, in opposition to their fathers wishes. They demanded, and by abuse and ill-treatment enforced, payment of certain large sums of money ; nor would the old Shaikh either settle the matter with them, or protect the Agent against their extortion. Hie offence was aggravated by a repetition of the ill-treat ment while the Agent was actually employed in his official duties, having left his concealment for the purpose of going on board a British vessel then in the harbour. This, and the failure of early remonstrances in obtaining redress, rendered it imperative that some public and undeniable reparation should be insisted upon. The appearance of a respectable force, and the threat of resorting to coercive measures, at length induced the Shaikh to comply with the demand upon him, that his son, or, in the event of his failing to do so, he himself, should come on board the senior officer's vessel, with a Khelut or dress of honour for the Agent, and that the persons who had been instrumental in the ill- treatment should be flogged, either on board the ship, or alongside 1 in one of his own boats, in presence of the crew. On the demise of Toorkey bin Saood, and the absence of his son and successor, Fysul, from Kateef, Shaikh Abdoolla.bin Ahmed succeed-ed, by bribery, in obtaining possession of the fort of Tirhoot, a dependency384 UTTOOBEES. of Kateef, producing annually from its date groves, and the usual taxes, an income of 30,000 dollars. The vicious and oppressive conduct of the sons of Abdoolla bin Ahmed, added to the death on the 31st May 1834 of Shaikh Khaleefa bin Soliman (nephew and colleague of Abdoolla bin Ahmed), whose authority upon the island of Bahrein had been little inferior to that of his uncle, which relieved his turbulent and refractory brothers and sons of all control, promised eventually to prove a fertile source of anarchy and confusion. A party of the Amayir Tribe (before mentioned as having joined the Shaikh of Bahrein) under the command of one Mooshrif, now made an attempt to recover their possessions at Lahsa and Kateef, but met by Omer bin Oofeysan, the Wahabee governor of the former town, were defeated with great loss, and compelled to retreat under the guns of Tirhoot, now held by the Bahrein Chief. Upon the ejection of Abdoolla bin Moosharee, and the failure of the attempt thereon made by the Wahabees to recover Tirhoot, Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed resumed the strict blockade of Kateef and Ajeer, and commenced plundering the boats belonging to those places. While the war was being thus carried on with varied success, neither party gaining any material advantage, the attention of Abdoolla bin Ahmed was called to the internal dissensions in his own family, and among his relatives, which, owing to his own misrule, partiality, and leniency, began to wear a most serious aspect. The Chiefs of Huailah, until lately dependent upon his authority, now not only opposed him, but entered into communications of a tendency inimical to his interests with the Imaum and the Wahabee Chief. They were, moreover, joined by one of the sons of the old Shaikh, who, obtaining the aid of several hundred Wahabees, set the power of the father at defiance, and captured .several boats belonging to Bahrein, within a short distance of that island. Another son, Ahmed, made his escape from the Coast of Guttur, and proceeded to Muskat, for the avowed purpose of soliciting His High ness the Imaum to espouse his cause, and to supply his party with ammunition and warlike stores. Some seizures having been made at sea by Ahmed, the circumstances were brought to the notice of the British authorities, who called upon him to make restitution,—a demand with which he did not hesitate compliance. His Highness the Imaum not only declined taking any part in the dispute so unhappily existing between the Shaikh of Bahrein and the members of his family, but sent his son Syud Hillal in one of his frigates to mediate between the contending parties, Syud Hillal's efforts, however, to effect a reconci liation, were nullified by the proceedings of the nephews and partisansUTTOOBEES. 385 of Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed, who, immediately subsequent to the re-establishment of peace, instigated a portion of the A1 Gowarah Tribe to proceed against Huailah, where they sank a boat, and killed a depend ent of Esai bin Tarif, one of the heads of the opposite party, who, on complaining of this infraction of the agreement so lately entered into,* to the Bahrein Chief, could obtain no satisfaction. He, therefore, accom panied by Bin Sulemah and their followers, seceded from Bahrein, and took refuge at Aboothabee, whence he desired permission of the British authorities to carry on hostilities against the trade and territories of his late matstei, a request which was of course denied him, on the grounds that he had established himself in a friendly, or at least neutral port, whose chief must either be responsible for his acts, or make, common cause with him against Abdoolla bin Ahmed. About the middle of the year 1836 Abdoolla bin Ahmed, alarmed at a. d. 1836. iev ^ va ^ the claims of Persia, in consequence of the receipt of a communication from the ener getic Mootamid of. Shiraz, calling upon him as a Persian subject to tender his submission to the reigning Shah, and the possible contin gency of the Imaum's co-operation being afforded in any attack upon the island, resolved to make up his quarrels as far as possible with the Arabs on the mainland, and, by a timely submission to the Wahabee Chief to engage his support and assistance in case of invasion. Terras were accordingly entered into, Abdoolla bin Ahmed paying the small annual tribute of 2,000 dollars, and the Wahabee Chief on his side engaging to supply a contingent of troops to repel any invaders of Bahrein, and'not to call for the vessels of that island in the event of his purposing to attack Muskat. The communication with Kateef and Ajeer was now therefore re-opened. In consequence of the grinding oppression exercised by the sons and nephews of the Uttoobee Chief, many of the wealthiest inhabitants, finding that there was no security to life or property, left the island, to settle in other parts of the Gulf. The old Shaikh himself, too, unable to tolerate their refractory conduct, had determined upon proceeding with his family and immediate followers to Khor Hassan, but was in duced to give up this intention by their expressions of contrition for past offences, and professions of obedience and amendment for the future. His conduct towards them was most unaccountable,— that, having the power and authority to repress them, he should tacitly ac knowledge himself a cypher in the government, by studiously shutting * The principal articles of this agreement were that each should retain the advantages he might have acqmred during the war; that Huailah should be evacuated and demolished; and safety should retura to Bahrein, under the guarantee of the Imaum for theirUTTOOBEESi his eyes to their tyrannous and extortionate proceedings, which, if unchecked, promised, at no very distant period, to effect the ruin and depopulation of the rich and fertile island. The Shaikh was nevertheless fully aware of the probable results of these divisions in his family ; and apprehending the necessity which might occur for bringing over troops from the mainland, for the purpose of re-establishing his authority, and the scene of bloodshed and plunder that must necessarily ensue, took the precaution, customary and suffi cient in the eyes of the Arabs to absolve him from further blame or responsibility, tO' warn a Bushire merchant, in the presence of the British Agent, for the information of the rest, and also of the Shaikhs of that town,, that he must no longer look to him for redress or protection. The Shaikh then prepared for his removal to Khor Hassan, by des patching to that place two of his wives, with their a. d . 1837. families, together with the furniture of the houses, even to the very doors,—a proceeding which much alarmed hib sons and relatives, as leaving them in doubt as to what ulterior measures he might have in contemplation; and tended for a time to check their insubordinate and unruly conduct. . , , . . t . The Amayir and Huwajir Tribes, (the Huwajir inhabiting De- maum, under the authority of the Uttoobee Chief,) taking advantage of the disturbed state of Nujd, in consequence of the struggle for power between Ameer Fysul and the pretender Khalid, commenced the systematic plunder of all boats belonging to Kateef, including also, occasionally, those from Bahrein. Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed there fore solicited and obtained the sanction and authority of the Resident to chastise them, which he did by forcibly seizing two of their boats, in effecting which five of their number were killed. ^ Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed, although anxiously desirous for the return , to his authority of the rulers of the A1 All aud Boo Ejman, who had with their tribes seeeded to Aboothabee, yet, with marked obsunacj aud ineonsisteney, would make no concesston, or yield uo point wh.e could lead to an amicable settlement: and further, complained (in October 1838) of permission being granted equally to them as to him, in the event of his desiring to resort to hostilities, forgetting a through the Resident's remonstrances and exertions alone had e All for three years past been restrained from revenging 'he injuries they had sustained at his hands, and ima g inln K' free himself to adopt forcible measures against the A1 Ah &gt; the y' other hand, were to be withheld from offering 4ny opposit.on in sell- ^All persuasions and attempt, at mediation having failed, both parties were informed that no further interference would be made, and that ,UTTOOBEES* 387 the termination of the month Ramzan, when the pearl fishery would be concluded, they would be considered as at war, and at liberty to pursue their own plans for the attainment of what they considered their just rights, being at the same time warned of the restrictive line, whose limits were to be carefully observed. Before the expiration of this limited period. Shaikh Abdoolla des patched his confidential minister to Bushire, to intimate his desire 'to come to an amicable arrangement, if such could be effected with honour' ; avoiding, however, to yield concessions that might lead to some understanding, and still tenaciously adhering to the condition he had before considered as a sine qua non of their return to Bahrein, to which he was aware they had as positively made up their minds not to consent, and modifying it only in their favour with the promise that their security and lawful claims should be guaranteed by the British Govern ment,—a guarantee which could not of course, as he was aware, be afforded. The Coast of Guttur was then offered as their place of resi dence ; and with the chance of such being accepted, as well as to avert the distress and misery incidental to war, the Resident placed a British vessel of war at the disposal of the Bahrein Chief, for the purpose of conveying himself or his accredited Agent to negotiate with the refugees at Aboolhabee. The services of this vessel were declined on its arrival at Bahrein, it being supposed that any terms proposed would not, if accepted, be adhered to, unless guaranteed by the British Government. War therefore became inevitable. Some objections were at the time made by the old Shaikh to the 'war limit' ; but the superior advantages of its restrictions to his own subjects over those of his opponents being pointed out, these were overruled and abandoned. The conduct of the Shaikh throughout (for it was evident he was unwilling to go to war) would appear to sanction the suppo sition of his entertaining the belief that the British authorities were prepared to go any lengths rather than that hostilities should break out between himself and Aboothabee, and therefore to compel the return of his fugitive subjects to their allegiance in accordance with his wishes. Upon the fall of the Wahabee ruler, Ameer Fysul, his General, Omer A D 18 3 9! Oofeysan, sought and received asylum at Bahrein. His surrender was demanded of the Uttoobee Chief by the usurper Khalid, as also that the fort of Demaum should be given up to him. These demands much alarmed Shaikh Abdoolla, who evaded compliance with them, as well as those previ ously made for tribute, and the surrender of Tirhoot, under the pretence of connection with, and submission to the Persian Government. The 51388 UTTOOBEES. fears entertained by the Uttoobee Chief, that whatever concessions or submissions he was prepared to make would only lead to further exactions, and eventually to the entire loss of his authority, were now confirmed by the avowal of Korshid Pacha, the Egyptian commander, by letter to the British authority, of his intention to attack and reduce the island to subjection. The grounds upon which he stated himself to have come to this determination, it is needless to mention, were perfectly invalid ; might, and the desire of aggrandisement, constituted his only rights; even the flimsy pretext of supporting the pretender (Khalid) against the legitimate ruler (Fysul) being abandoned, and Central Arabia openly claimed as a possession of Mahomed Ali Pacha by right of conquest. Upon the strength of the overtures made by the Uttoobee Chief to the Persian Government, a certain Hajee Kasim, formerly supercargo of a trading vessel, was selected as envoy from the Prince of Shiraz to Bahrein, bearing a Rukum and dress of honour for its chief, and attended by an escort of ten Sirbaz. He was under directions to remain at Bahrein as Persian Agent, and to be the medium of receiving and transmitting the annual tribute, which the Persian authorities vainly flattered themselves the Bahrein Chief was disposed to pay for their countenance and protection. Hostilities were in the mean time carried on between Bahrein and 1 the A1 Ali at Aboothabee, which entailed much distress upon the inha bitants of the former. The merchants, being naturally anxious for the restoration of peace, solicited the interference and mediation of the Re sident, who accordingly despatched his Assistant, to endeavour to effect a reconciliation. Nothing resulted from this mission, as no terms would be entered into that had not the guarantee of the British Govern- ■ ment. It was, however, ascertained that the Beniyas Chief had no intention of making common cause with Esai bm Tanf, indeed that 1 these two were no longer on friendly terms, the former requiring the lat ter either to leave his country, or settle there permanently as a peaceable subject Civilities, too, in the shape of presents, had been interchanged between the Bahrein and Beniyas Chiefs, who shortly after entered into a treaty of peace, which of course deprived Esai bin Tanf of the alliance of the latter, and put an end to his carrying on aggressions against the former from the now friendly port of Aboothabee, which he conse quently determined upon leaving on the conclusion of the pearl fishery, consenting of course to suspend hostilities up to that period. Although no positive pledge of support and assistance in the maintenance of the integrity of his possessions could at this time be afforded by the British Government, yet Shaikh Abdoolla bin AhmeUTTOOBEES. 339 / • . having promised that he would communicate with the Resident previous to placing himself under the protection of any other foreign power, it was not without much dissatisfaction that an intimation was received, through the Egyptian authorities, of his having become tributary to them; more particularly as he had received every encou ragement from the British authorities to assert his rights, and was well aware of the light in which Korshid Pacha's proceedings were viewed by them. The fact was, that this chief felt hurt and annoyed that a more decided line had not been adopted, and also that authoritative influence was not employed to subdue the A1 Ali, and compel their return to his territories, instead of their being, on the contrary, permitted to carry on hostilities against him; forgetting, apparently, that he had himself forced the British Government to withdraw from all interference, inasmuch as he had solicited to be allowed to attack them, whereas they had been repeatedly restrained from becoming the aggressors. The Shaikh excused himself for having entered into any agreement with Korshid Pacha on the grounds that, having given up all hopes of support and assistance from the British, and conceiving himself left to his own unaided resources, and threatened with a war with Aboothabee,— his trade harassed by the aggressions of Esai bin Tarif,—his Bedouin subjects on the main going over in great numbers, and submitting to Korshid Pacha, who was then threatening an invasion,—the difficulty of defending Bahrein from an attack if made from the opposite coast, there being many places which admitted of a fleet of a hundred boats making its way across in a few hours, without the possibility of being approach ed by either ship or Buggalow, on account of the shallow- 3 water and numerous shoals, he considered his own interests were best consulted by his agreeing to pay the Pacha so trifling a sum as 2,000 dollars a year, to secure the integrity of his own territories, and the undisturbed possession of his own authority over them, as it had been expressly stipulated by him that no Agent of the Pacha should reside in Bahrein. He admitted that both himself and every other Arab detested the being at all connected with, or coming under the rule of the Egyptians ; and declared, that if the British Government would give a distinct and written pledge to protect him and his from all attacks and aggressions, he would drop all further connection with him, and avow himself a dependent of Great Britain ; but declined giving the substance of the above in writing, on the plea that, for the present at least, he had got rid of a pressing evil by a comparatively trifling sacrifice, and could not seriously commit himself until he had received the fullest and most satisfactory assurance from the British Government of its protection.390 UTTOOBEES. The quarrels and dissensions among the members of the Uttoobee Chief's family were by no means smothered by the sense of the impending danger. Finding that the heads of the tribe would not take part with him in an attack upon his sons and nephews, from the dread of encountering the effects of their deep and uncontrolled resentment, when, as before, they should have adjusted their misunderstanding by apparent submission. Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed had recourse to the plan of entertaining a number of men belonging to the independent Bedouin Tribes on the main, for the purpose of overawing his disobe dient kinsmen. So great was the disgust created in the minds of the inhabitants of Bahrein by his weak and vacillating conduct, and the heavy exactions which, encouraged by the promised support of Korshid Pacha, he was beginning to levy, that the Boo Gowarah, a tribe numbering about 2,000 men, residing principally at Fowarah, applied for permission to quit, with a view to placing themselves under the protection of the British Government; and the most influential inhabitants only wanted a leader, to unite together and remove him from the chief authority. No sooner had Esai bin Tarif and the greater portion of his depend ents settled on the island of Kenn, on their peaceful removal from Aboothabee, than their desire to retaliate for the losses they had sustained at the hands of the Chief of Bahrein returned, and Shaikh Esai more than once expressed his wish to be permitted to cruise against the trade of that island, and also to seize from the Shaikh of Bebaye a Buteel formerly belonging to himself, but confiscated, subsequent to his secession, by Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed, and presented by, that chief to the Debaye Chief (Muktoom bin Butye). Although by the evacuation of Nujd by Korshid Pacha and the Egyptian army one great obstacle to the renewal of hostilities against Bahrein had been removed, yet the restrictive war limit having been once established, its infringement could on no account be permitted ; more especially as it had been fully explained to Shaikh Esai, when in Muskat, that so long as he remained on Kenn, whose peculiar position without the boundaiy 'was pointe out to him, he must give up all idea of carrying on aggressive wai against any part of the Arabian Coast. A similar reply was again given in May 1841, on the Resident's visiting the island of Kenn. The project of Mahomed bin Khaleefa, of establishing himself at Kateef and Lahsa, the prosecution of w T hich was favoured by the disaffection produced by the highly oppressive conduct of the Agent o Korshid Pacha, proved to be decidedly in opposition to the views o Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed, the superior chief; and great risk was in curred of the two coming to open collision, and thus hastening a re^u tUTTOOBEES. 391 which the real enmity and jealousy existing between them, as well as the overbearing conduct of relations on either side, had long threatened to produce. Although a reconciliation was effected between the parlies, and the impending rupture between them for a time averted, it was evidently nothing but a hollow profession on the part of both, bat par ticularly the young Chief Mahomed bin Khaleefa, who subsequently addiessed a letter offering his services to the British Government, and soliciting assistance against his grand uncle. He soon after proceeded to the Guttur Coast, and engaging the good will of the inhabitants, set up a species of opposition most annoying to his superior. A piracy committed early in the previous year, upon a Koweit boat, A D ^ 00 Syf, baffled every endeavour on the part of the British authorities and agents in the Gulf to discover the perpetrators, until August 1841, when a clue was found, which tended to the inculpation of an individual named Syud bin Azeez, a follower of Shaikh Moobaruk (the son of Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed), residing at Demaum. It was advisable, nevertheless, that it should be impressed upon the minds of the Mari time Arabs, that no lapse of time would be permitted to afford impunity to crime, which in this case having been traced and brought home to the culprit above mentioned, a demand was made upon the Uttoobee Chief foi the payment of 274 Mahomed Shah rupees as the value of the plun dered property, or the surrender of Syud bin Azeez and his boat. The former alternative was complied with, and the money paid. Another case of aggression was likewise committed on the banks about the commencement of the pearl fishery, by some of the inhabitants of Bahrein. One Ali bin Yoosoof, an inhabitant of Lingah, having taken on board his boat at Kateef 250 bags of dates and 80 mats, was on his way to Bahrein, when she grounded on a Subeenah situated to the westward of Ras Reccan. 'While the crew were engaged in floating their boat, five. Buggaralis, commanded by a person named Jallijeh, came off from the shore, and plundered them of 180 bags of dates, and the 80 mats, worth altogether 240 Mahomed Shah rupees. The complainant proceeded to Muharag, to lay his case before Nassir bin Abdoolla, the Bahrein Chief's son, who, in reply, promised to recover his property ; but finding himself put off from day to day, without any prospect of receiving reparation, and ascertaining that his dates had been carried off to the banks, he returned to Lingah, and represented what had occurred to his Chief, Syud bin Guzeeb, who recommended him to the Resident for redress. This being a case very closely allied to piracy. Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed was held responsible that satisfaction should be afforded. As392 UTTOOBEES. the delinquents stated that they had only taken such portion of the cargo of the Lingah boat as had been regularly agreed upon as salvage, it was arranged that the value of the property claimed should be lodged in the hands of the British Agent, until the claim for salvage should be substantiated by oath of Zun Tulaak, in the presence of the Native Agent, which having been done according to form before the Kazee, the money was returned. The authority of the old Shaikh being now openly defied by his sons, who had each from one to three hundred followers, ready to commit any act of violence or aggression at the bidding of their leaders, the island became rapidly the scene of increased anarchy and confusion: as a natural consequence, the trade had diminished to nearly one-half within the last few years. At this time (April 1842) Ameer Khalid came from Demaum to Khor Hassan, to meet Shaikh Abdoolla, who treated A ' D * 1812 ' him with great respect, and led him to hope that he would assist him in the recovery of Kateef to the utmost in his power. After visiting Mahomed bin Khaleefa at Bahrein, the ex- Wahabee ruler returned to Demaum. The Bahrein Chief, however, if he ever entertained such an intention, had already too much on his own hands to admit of his acting up to his promise, for the serious dissensions in his own family, as about to be detailed, had reached to such a pitch as to demand his utmost attention. The immediate and ostensible cause of the present open rupture originated in the opposition offered to the marriage of Ahmed, the son of Abdoolla bin Ahmed, with a young girl, the daughter of one Abdool Rahman bin Rashid. The suitors respectively threatened to possess her by force, # when her guardian, Moobaruk bin Khaleefa, appealing to their mutual relation, Mahomed bin Khaleefa, against the injustice and disgrace of permitting such a violation, he having already select one from his own family to be her husband (Mahomed bin Moojarrm bin Fail), angry discussions and threats were produced, and the etiorts of the old chief, who came over from Khor Hassan for the purpose, failing to effect an amicable arrangement, both parties began to collect troops, calling in principally the ignorant but warlike Bedouins irora the mainland, themselves in no way interested in the quarrel, and e on solely by the prospect of emolument and plunder. ♦ The damsel on whose account so much disagreement had arisen resided at M ' har ^' and was on the commencement of hostilities at the mercy of her would he suitor, w ' moreover consenting, might without immediate opposition ha\e possessec unse person; but as the real ground of the dispute had no reference whatever to her, so t le did not cease with her possession.UTTOOBEES. 393 The towns of Muharag and Munama formed the head quarters of .he respective ehiefs. These are merely separated by a n! row gut n many p aces fordable a. low-water. Abdoolla bin Ahmed in pes- 1 0 e 01 ™ er ' and 'lie more powerful at sea, had complete 'blockade ^ ^ MUnama ' WhiCh he C0 ' ,riVcd effectually Several ^irmishes took place between the contending forces, in which were killed Dhyj, the brother of Mahomed bin Khaleefa, and the grandson of A doolla bin Ahmed, Mahomed bin Moobaruk, without however, any decisive advantage resulting to either side; and the parties maintained their respective positions until the middle of June when Abdool a bin Ahmed, making a simultaneous attack by land and sea, entirely defeated the forces of Mahomed bin Khaleefa, and obtained possession of his town. That chief fled with a few followers to the Gnttur Coast, and thence o ja isa and Riaz, to solicit the aid of the new Wahabee ruler Bin feooneyan. ' The Bedouin troops in the pay of Abdoolla bin Ahmed were let loose to plunder the town which had fallen into their hands.

' ^ ^ ell S a S ed in It appeared from the Agent's statement, that the Zenana and c 11 dren of Humood found refuge in his house with his sanction but at his son and immediate dependents, on Mahomed bin Khalc'efa's forces being broken, fled there for protection, and, finding the door open, entered without Ins permission ; that having done so he was exercise them Witi,0Ut f0ree ' Which he ™ unwilling ' demanded t b ha n t A th raed W!th Ms violori ™ s followers, demanded that he abovemcntioned should be given up to him ^ threatening, in the event of refusal, to level the house with the grouTd' and lull and plunder all the persons and property therein, the Tm , amounting in number to above 1,000 individuals, and he la ter in va ue to between thirty and forty thousand KerooneesUTTOOBEES. down (from the top of his house) the persons demanded, who had hardly reached the ground when they were cut to pieces. \bdoolla bin Ahmed, well knowing the timid and imbecile character of the late Agent, appears to have confined himself to threats and remonstrances to obtain the fulfilment of his object. When called upon he offered the following explanation :—that at the commencement of the outbreak he had sent for the Agent, and given him the option of either coming with all his family and dependents, and taking up his temporary residence at Muharag, or proceeding onboard the British vessel which happened at the time to be at anchor in the harbour; alleging that his mercenary Bedouins, being perfectly uncontrollable, he had reason to apprehend that some injury might result to himself or his house That the Agent would not consent to this arrangement, but returned to Munama, and received under his protection a great quantity of property belonging to the inhabitants, which, on the place fallino- into his hands, he had found great difficulty in restraining his Bedouins from plundering; but that finding that the dependents of Humood bin Omeree, of the Amayir Tribe, of whom he was the head, —who were particularly obnoxious to him, by reason of their having killed his relative,—had taken refuge in the Agent's house, he sent to explain this circumstance, and requested their surrender, which was no sooner granted than the persons in question were cut to pieces. The Shaikh's proceedings could not be pronounced entire y ree roni blame, he having himself in propria persona demanded the surrender o the victims, threatening the Agent, his family, and friends with instant death in case of refusal.

He then, with a view to concentrating and strengthening his resources on the Guttur Coast, planned and commenced the rebuilding of Zobara, now deserted, but which forty years before had been the Uttoobee head quarters. Omer bin Oofeysan, the Wahabee General, and Governor of Lahsa, having seized the person of the Chief of the seaport town of Sohat, and compelled the destruction of that fort, the inhabitants (for the most part pearl divers), at the instigation of Shaikh Abooolla bin Ahmed, seceded to Bahrein, to the number of about three-fourths of the population. The continued detention as a prisoner, by the Wahabee ruler, of Shaikh Shafee, the Chief of the Huwajir, a staunch adherent of Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed, whose release had been declared a sine qu&amp; non by that chief to the entertainment of any overtures of peace between them, precluded compliance on the part of the latter with the demands of the former, for the suspension of the blockade of his seaports of Kateef, Sohat, &amp;c., and determined the former in favour of the cause of his guest, Mahomed bin Khaleefa, to whose solicitations his power had not as yet attained sufficient stability to admit of his actively acceding, in consequence of some of the JBedouin Tribes having failed to tender their submission to his authority. Mahomed bin Khaleefa accordingly commenced collecting forces on the mainland, for the purpose of renewing the war. ^ Affairs were in this state, and the unpopularity of the Uttoobee Chief at his height, when Esai bin Tarif, of the A1 Ali Tribe, residing at Kenn, and Busheer, (with from three to four hundred adherents,) the son of Rahmah bin Jaubir (the famous Pirate Chief of Demaum, who in the latter end of lb26, worsted in an engagement with a very superior Uttoobee force, to avoid capture, with his own hand set fire to the powder magazine, and blew up himself and his vessel), visited Bushire together, for the purpose of intimating to the Resident their desire to make common cause with the junior Uttoobee Chief, who had invited them to join his standard ; and of soliciting his permission to wage open war accordingly upon Bahrein. Ihe reason given by the latter for becoming a party to this formid able coalition* was, that in consequence of the blockade maintained by Abdoolla hin Ahmed, he was unable to carry away the produce of his paternal estates at Demaum (near Kateef). The outline of the cause of Esai bin Tarif's discontent has been already given. The public opinion was now very strong that the late disturbances at Bahrein had been instigated and fomented by him, who, having no adequate means singly of attacking Shaikh Abdoolla, forced on gradually by his intrigues that great object of his ambition, a powerful coalition against his enemy. 52396 UTTOOBEES. The Resident's sanction for the prosecution of open and proclaimed war having been duly given, these chiefs were reminded of the restrictive line, within the limits of which they would be compelled to confine their warlike operations at sea ; and so also was the Shaikh of Bahrein, on the Assistant Resident's visit to that island, where he was deputed solely for the purpose of making known to him the public designs of his enemies, and their declaration of war against him. This communication was received with much surprise and apprehen sion by the Uttoobee Chief, who appeared to doubt that permission had been granted to the parties coalescing. He stated that the news had reached him too late ; that most of his vessels and dependents had left on their trading voyages, and that, his country therefore denuded of troops, and his means of defence gone, he earnestly hoped that hostili ties would not be permitted to commence until their return; that otherwise, with however great contempt he looked upon the power of each individually,—the two, Esai bin Tarif and Busheer bin Rahmah bin Jaubir, as insignificant, and the Wahabee Chief as deficient in shipping and means of transport,—it would not be in his power to cope with them united; hinting that he would be compelled to make the best terms he could with the latter, thereby virtually ceding the island to him,—a measure which he conceived would not be approved of or al lowed by the British Government; that he had opened a negotiation with that ruler for the release of Shaikh Shafee, his relation, offering in return to deliver up Ajeer (a large and strong fort on the coast between Demaum and Kateef), and to raise the blockade of his seaport. He expressed his willingness to permit of Busheer removing his property from Demaum ; but that he could not admit of his taking any of his large vessels into that harbour,—in other words, of his placing men and means at the disposal of his enemies. His request for the suspension of hostilities until the return of his vessels was in the first instance referred to the British Government. Mahomed bin Khaleefa's first object was to establish himself on the Guttur Coast, in order to have at his disposal the naval resources of its inhabitants, and to keep open his communication with his colleagues. The Wahabee ruler now again opened a communication with the Bahrein Chief, acting the part of a mediator, and recommending peace with his grand nephew. He further released Shafee, who promised, on his arrival at Demaum, to exert his utmost influence to restore peace. Shaikh Abdoolla, however, whether treating lightly the means and talent of Mahomed bin Khaleefa, who must nevertheless be henceforth looked upon as by no means a despicable rival, or putting little trust in the sincerity of the Wahabee ruler, treated his mediatory efforts withTJTTOOBEES. 397 slight attention, indeed employed somewhat threatening language, to urge his observance of perfect neutrality. The representations at the same time (January 1843) of the chief a. d. 1843. men of his territories at Guttur, on the main land, of their inability to defend themselves against any attack by Mahomed bin Khaleefa, proved that that chief had not abated in his preparations for hostilities, in which he was un doubtedly secretly assisted by the Wahabee ruler, without whose connivance or countenance he must certainly have abandoned them. The small fort of Meezeer, in Guttur, fell into the hands of Mahomed bin Khaleefa, who, sending his troops, had forestalled those of his oppo- nents in its occupation. The latter, on their approach, finding that it was already in his hands, retired, without attempting its recovery. A communication was thus established with the colleagues of Kenn. Several boats, also, coming over from that island, excited the fears of Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed, who for the second time conveyed a request (February 1843) to the British authorities, similar in its object to his previous one, having reference to the proceedings of Esai bin Tarif and Busheer bin Rahmah ; but as, at the same time, reports were received at Bahrein from Kenn by a Muskat boat (which, arriving fiom the head quarters of his enemy, should scarcely have been deemed worthy of credit by a discreet and wise chief), that these parties had abandoned the objects they had in view, in the belief that the Wahabee ruler had withdrawn his aid and countenance from the cause of the younger in favour of the elder chief, the communication of these reports to Bushire led to the supposition that the necessity for makino- the request* had passed away, and that, consequently, it did not re^ quire a reply, J 1 '. 5 re T'f ' ' 'g'i' implied as requiring reply in the report made subsequently by the British Agent of a nonvemfon winch passed between himself and Shaikh AMoolla bin Ahmed and again conveyed m the Agent's report of the 23rd of the same month , and further implied m the Shaikh's letter of the 2 0tb Mareh, when he was informed that there was no 0^^ than that given by the Assistant Resident when he met him These references are here noticed, because the ex-chief pertinaciously but unfouudedlv attubuted his misfortunes to his having been led to consider himself secure from attack hv the coalesced forces, in consequence of a promise which he alleged to have been made bv the Assistant Resident when that officer was deputed to Bahrein in November 1842 that host 1' t0C0, ' mMCe U ° ,,lhiSb - S had returned from The following are extracts of a letter from the ex-chief of the 29th December 184S * ^ of Captain Hennell s reply of the 30th December, bearing upon this subiect • -« F &lt;■' when I told your man Hajee Jassim that it was my intention to launch my boats andTk'T' initiative with the people of Guttur and Kenn, before they could attack me he fo h ^ ( oing so, saying that the English would not permit this.

The inhabitants of the Gnttur Coast favoured decidedly the cause of Mahomed bin Khaleefa, and established him in Fowarah, whence he proceeded with a considerable force in five Buggalows, and effected a landing opposite to Ruffah (a village, with a fort, six miles in the interior of the island of Bahrein). Abdoolla bin Ahmed immediately sent a force, under the command of his son Nassir, who succeeded in gaining possession of the fort before the invaders could reach it. A fight took place, from which no positive advantage was obtained by either party ; several men were killed, and some wounded. Measures, however, were adopted to surround them by land, and cut off their retreat by sea. In the course of the hostile operations which ensued, a piracy was committed (March 1843) by the dependents of Abdoolla bin Ahmed, upon a Gooncha carrying British colours, and having on board a packet and some stores to the address of the Commodore at Bassadore. It appeared that that chief had issued orders that no vessels should be permitted to remain at anchor in the harbour of Munama (the town on the main island opposite to Muharag), and on the vessel in question anchoring there, two boats were despatched with a message to the Na- khoda to weigh and return to Muharag. The crews of these, board ing, plundered her cargo, and, among the rest, the packet and stores adverted to; hauled down the flag, and tore it to pieces,—an aggravation of their crime which admitted of no excuse. The necessity of sending me that Bin Tarif and Busheer bin Rahmah had obtained permission to commence hostilities against me, and asked whether I had committed any aggression upon them. I replied in the negative. He then inquired what was the cause of their enmity. I answered that Fysul bin Saood wished to establish them in Biddah, for the purpose of plunder and rapine. At the time, also, when all my ships were scattered about in Bombay, Malabar, and \emen, your Assistant told me that both the parties were prohibited from hostilities until the return of my vessels, and that an order would be sent to me by the Resident. Hajee Jassim, your Agent, was present when this conversation took place. On this account I was negligent, and did not send and get other men to assist me, in the place of those who were absent in my vessels. 'W hen, therefore, my subjects who inhabit the Guttur Coast perceived that my country was denuded of troops, they were instigated by a spirit of plunder to rise up against me, and that took place which God has brought to pass: For the above reasons you have now ground (for assisting me).' Reply. —*' Touching your complaint that my Assistant, when at Bahrein, had led you to believe that Esai bin Tarif and Busheer bin Rahmah would not be permitted to attack you while your ships and men were absent in India, and that consequently you were negligent, and did not get troops to assist you in the place of those who were away, I would beg to observe that you are quite mistaken in supposing Captain Kemball ever gave such a promise, lou are aware that his sole object in visiting Bahrein was to warn you that Bin Tarif and Busheei bin Rahmah had asked for and obtained permission to commence hostilities against you, and all he offered was to communicate your wishes to Colonel Robertson. When, however, you did not receive any answer from that officer on the subject, you ought to have been sure that he could not comply with your request for the temporary prohibition of hostilities until the return of your vessels.'UTTOOBEES. 399 two boats to warn ofl a friendly or neutral vessel was not apparent, and favoured, on one side the belief that the Shaikh did not know that the Gooncha was under the British flag, or suspected its having been hoisted by his enemies as a mere ruse,—to the benefit of which supposi tions he had some title, inasmuch as it remained a doubt whether the Gooncha had shown her colours on entering the harbour, or only when approached by the Shaikh's boats,—and as the armed 'vessels of the Kenn Chiefs were hourly expected to the assistance of their colleague, who, as before mentioned, had already effected a landino- on the island; yet, on the other side, it was asserted that due informal tion had been given him of the Gooncha being under British protection and thus left room for the suspicion that the Arabs merely acted in conformity with the directions of their master. The despatch of two well manned boats, with a peaceable object, indicated at least a most culpable want of care and precaution on his part against irregularities aware, as he undoubtedly was, that the party consisting of mercenary Bedouins, proverbially not gifted with great discrimination, could not withstand the temptation of securing a prize, which their superiority in numbers and warlike equipment placed within their power. The Shaikh denied all participation in, or delegation of authority for the outrageous conduct of his agents. A vessel of war was with all haste despatched, for the purpose of making a due investigation with a view to the establishment of grounds for demanding redress.' The occurrences at Bahrein in the interim, however, rendered this of little or no avail. The brother of Mahomed bin Khaleefa, coming to Munama with a party of horse and foot, and favoured by the inhabitants, obtain ed possession of the place, and was very soon joined by the allied chiefs from Kenn in great force. The combined forces proceeded immediately (April 1843) to the attack of Muhavag, and, defeating the troops of Abdoolla bin Ahmed compelled him to take refnge in a small fort, situated at no erea! distance from the town, which they so completely invested as very shortly to have it in their power to dictate their own terms Allowing him no more than one Bnteel and one Gooncha, for the conveyance of himself and his personal property and dependents, they permitted him to quit the island. On the ejection of the father, the fort of Arad, held by his sons, surrendered at discretion ; these were, however permitted to remain and reside on the island. Shaikh Abdoolla proceeded to Demaum (the only place now left that acknowledged his authority), of which his eldest son Moobaruk was governor Every precautionary measure was taken by his opponents to ensure the »ood will or neutrality of the neighbouring States; and this was the more400 UTTOOBEES. necessary, as the return to their homes of their Guttur subsidiaries being suddenly called for, in consequence of advantage having been taken of their absence by the Monasir, an inland Bedouin Tribe, to plunder their territory, they were deprived of the services of a large proportion of their fighting men. Immediately antecedent to the active hostilities which lost Bahrein to the old chief, a Charrak boat (sailing under the neutral flag of Persia), into which property just arrived from Bombay, consigned to two Banyan merchants of Bahrein, had been transhipped, was plundered in the harbour of Munama by the men of the Huwajir and Suloota Tribes, his dependents. The latter, however, passing over to the side of the conqueror, and becoming under his control, cast upon him the re sponsibility of their act, and the consequent obligation of recovering the value of the plunder which had fallen to their share. It would have been objectionable, and in a measure unjust, immediately to have urged payment upon Mahomed bin Khaleefa, while the contest appeared yet doubtful, and while, from his fallen state, and consequent want of means, as asserted by himself, and moreover from the intangibility of his position to our naval force, similar redress could not be exacted from his rival. It was not, therefore, till February in the following year, when the authority of the former was firmly established, that he was call- ed upon to restore the value of that portion of the property plundered by the Suloota, a demand which he acceded to without hesitation. Abdoolla bin Ahmed commencing a system of annoyance upon t e trade of Bahrein (June 1848), the colleagues despatched several vessels to blockade Demaum, and restrain his boats withm the limits of its The recent contentions between the contending chieftains, and their present doubtful position, afforded the legitimate Wahabee ruler, Ameer Fvsul, who had now succeeded in re-establishing his authority in Nuj , the opportunity and pretence for interference; indeed, his aid an countenance being earnestly solicited by either, he very soon exercise an important influence in the affairs of the island, and its dependencies on the opposite Coast of Guttur, with the almost certain prospect ot restoring the payment of the annual tribute, which had not been exacted since the early days of the rule of his father, Toorkey bin Saood. It would appear that Fysul had not forgotten nor forgiven his forme disputes and quarrels with the old chief, who had had generally advantage, and from the first was inclined to favour the cause ot tli younger. Much time was spent in negotiations with either, wu their presents and tempting promises, and the yet unstable nature o newly recovered position, rendered it his inteiest to piolon 0 , an prevented his immediately taking an active part.UTTOOBEES. 4Q2 Shaikh Jaubir, Governor of Koweit,» and a mutual friend of the con tending chiefs, now (August 1843) volunteered his services as mediator. Aware that to effect a lasting peace between them was perfectly hopeless, on account of the conflicting views and interests of the col leagues on the one side, and the sons and subordinates on the other between whom an irreconcilable hatred existed, and unprepared unwilling to engage actively in the cause, this chief had hitherto refrained from any interference whatever. Perceiving now, however, the elder chief reduced to the last extremity and no longer able to resist, he evinced a generous desire to save him 10m nrther degradation, and, if possible, to induce him to return with im to Koweit; for this, it appeared, was his object, in the event of his mediation proving unsuccessful. Under these circumstances, no obiec- tion was oflered to his carrying his proposal into effect, as conveyed in his communication on the subject to the British authority, who merelv recommended his confining his proceedings to mediation alone, and not permitting them to assume the appearance of hostilities towards w uT khaleefa ' now alIied ' if n o' in a manner subject, to the Wahabee ruler, whose aid and countenance he had succeeded in secur ing by the promise of renewing the payment of an annual tribute such as was formerly exacted from the Bahrein Chief by his father' loorkey bin Saood. Shaikh Jaubir accordingly proceeded to Bahrein, accompanied by a fleet of eight large vessels, and there held a lengthened communication with the de facto ruler, the result of which was the despatch of a boat to seek the ex-chief, and invite him to a conference. The latter however, conscious probably, that mediation alone, and not active interference, would be exercised in his favour, had left the neighbour hood (for Bushire), his pride precluding him from accepting or granting terms to those whom, though undoubtedly hereditarily entitled to a s lare of authority over Bahrein, he appears ever to have considered his subjects. H. s visi, being thus rendered of no avail, and the further detention of his vessels from their commercial occupation profitless and prejudicial to the interests of bis subjects, Shaikh Jaubir returned to Koweit, without having in any way achieved his object. !».. a &gt; xr ' a S0n0f AbdooIla bin Ahmed, with Hajee Bushab, the er s Vizier, coming out of Demaum, which under these circumstances continued to be closely blockaded, for the purpose of collecting boats on he adjoining coast, were seized by the G overnor of Kateef, who also made prisoner Ah another son of the ex-chief, who had come over from Lingah with a small reinforcement of the Aboosemate tribe, to join his father. de ;^rtSir^^: ish , MmiM1402 UTTOOBEES. An attempt on the part of his sons, who visited the Coast of Oman with this object, to engage the assistance of Sultan bin Suggur, his son Suggur, and Muktoom bin Butye of Debaye, in their father's cause, having failed, these chiefs evading immediate, but holding out hopes of eventual compliance (on the termination of the pearl fishery), provided they were not forbidden by the British Government or the Wahabee ruler, the ex-chief visited Bushire in person, for the purpose of obtain ing the required sanction of the British authority to their joining his cause. It was reported that the chiefs in question, however much to all appearance in earnest, only wanted some plea or excuse to rid them selves of the importunities of the ex-chief, and abstain from any inter ference whatever in his quarrel, from the knowledge, probably, that the colleagues on the other hand were not idle in their endeavours to arrange a counter alliance with the Beniyas and Amulgavine Shaikhs, with a view to meet the impending emergency. A correspondence had been opened by Esai bin Tarif with the former (Khaleefa bin Shakboot), and the latter (Abdoolla bin Rashid) visited Kenn in person, and received a valuable present. Under these circumstances, the ex-chief was informed, in reply to his application, that the British Government, although prepared to act the part of mediator, without affording any guarantee, could not so far inter fere as to reinstate him in his lost authority, nor could it permit of the Shaikhs of Oman taking any part in a war in which they had no interest or connection, as being bound by agreements with the British Govern ment, and by a truce among themselves, guaranteed by it, to abstain from hostilities of any kind on the seas, whereas the engagement of their assistance by opposite and contending parties could not but lead to confusion throughout the Gulf, and hostilities between the tribes themselves, who, from being in the first instance allies, would very soon become principals, and this too without any benefit accruing to himself. It would appear that one Shaikh Sulman, the nephew of the Mujta- hid of Bushire, a person having no legal authority, or situation under the Government, had commenced a correspondence with Shaikh Ab doolla, while that chief was yet blockaded in Demaum, holding out to him hopes of assistance from Persia, in troops and guns, to retake Bahrein. To this his visit to Bushire was doubtless mainly attributable, not that he really believed the Persian Government had it in its power to sanction and carry through the unauthorised proffer of Shaikh Sal man, but that, anticipating non-compliance on the part of the British authorities to the requests he had to make, he hoped to turn the existence of such overtures to some advantage in urging his case, an inducing acquiescence ; and accordingly intimated to them (OctobciUTTOOBEES. 403 1843) in pretty plain terms, that if his solicitations were unheeded lie would be compelled to throw himself into the arms of Persia. A copy of Shaikh Sulman's communication was forwarded to Tehran, and the ex-chief was informed that any declaration of war on the part of Persia against Bahrein must emanate in the King or Government, and be open and proclaimed. The ex-chief, after a short stay at Bushire, returned to Demaum, and thence proceeded to Nabend, on the Persian Coast, to await the course of events. Esai bin Tarif, to whom it had been intimated that so long as he continued to reside on Kenn he could not, for obvious reasons, be permitted to exercise any further interference in the affairs of the oppo site coast, evacuated that island, agreeably to his expressed intention, on the termination of the pearl fishery, and proceeded with his tribe to Biddah, on the Guttur Coast,—an arrangement considered in every respect highly satisfactory, as bringing him within the limits of the restrictive line, and placing that port (exceedingly difficult of access) in the possession of a chief in whose sincere wish to put down irregulari ties at sea, of a piratical nature, every confidence was placed,—inclina tions very different to those entertained by Salmin bin Nassir Sooedan, the former Shaikh of Biddah, whose proceedings, as already detailed in these sketches, left room for the suspicion that he secretly protected and encouraged predatory characters, in whose ill-gotten spoils he did not scruple to participate. The ex-Chief of Bahrein again visited Bushire in December 1843, with six vessels, manned and armed, with the avowed purpose of having an interview with the Resident; but as he declined the invitation of the lattei for a meeting on board one of the vessels of war then in the roads, given under the idea that his wish to visit him on shore was a mere pretext to cover his real purpose, which was to have a personal com munication with Shaikh Sulman, and that if he really desired an interview he could make no real objection to the arrangement, it was concluded, with justice, that his real object was to endeavour to procure the aid from the Persian Government which had been so unauthorisedly promised by that intriguing individual. He however, by letter, earnestly urged his claims to the interference and assistance of the British Government in his behalf, on the ground of his having rejected the overtures of the Wahabee Chief Fysul • as also his being a party to the General Treaty of '1820claims which were not admitted, as the letter of Ameer Fysul to his address, which ie tiansmitted for perusal, so far from having a tendency to excite disturbances on the sea, appeared to exhibit a sincere desire for the promotion of peace and tranquillity, and for a reconciliation between himself and his grand nephew ; and as the treaty alluded to had for itsm 404 uttoobees. only object the suppression of plunder and piracy, and nowhere contemplated any interference in lawful and acknowledged war, provided always such warfare did not lead to acts of aggression upon the lives and property of those having no concern therein. While the ex-chief w^as yet at Bushire, a communication was received from his rival, complaining that a Buteel belonging to the son of Jaubir bin Busheer, of Bahrein, had been seized by the dependents of the former at Aseeloo, or Nabend, on the Persian Coast, and therefore within the neutral ground ; and calling upon the Resident to exact redress. The remonstrance thereon had the effect of drawing from the ex-chief an order to the Governor of Nabend for the restoration of the Buteel. Before this document, transmitted by a British vessel, could reach its destination, an exchange of governors had taken place at that port, and the new one refused compliance with his instructions ; nor was it till after much delay, and a lengthened correspondence, that the boat in question was restored to its owner (in July 1844), immediately previous to which time Shaikh Busheer bin Rahmah of Biddah most unauthorisedly seized and detained two Buteels belonging to Nabend, in retaliation for the continued detention of the vessel refered to : he however liberated them immediately on the receipt of the Resi dent's letter of remonstrance against his undue interference in an affair which was already in the course of adjustment by the British Government. A further communication was received in January 1844 from the ex-chief, again earnestly urging his claims for a. d . 1844. the interference of the British Government, and soliciting its aid, on the ground of all his misfortunes having resulted from his having been taken unawares at a time when he had deemed himself perfectly secure, in consequence of his having been led by the British authorities to suppose that the colleagues would not be permitted to attack him until the return of his boats and subjects from their trading voyages. To this application a peremptory refusal was returned. . The long promised Nujdee land forces at length arriving, and laying siege to Demaum, the garrison was very shortly reduced to the last extremity for provisions and warlike stores, a A supply, too, sent by the Chief of Koweit, failed of reaching its destination, and fell into the hands of the enemy, whose blockading squadron, gaining timely infor mation of the arrival of the two boats in which it was embarked at Khore Balbul, whence it was intended to have been transported by camels to the beleaguered fort, despatched a force to intercept and make them prizes. Although the legality of the seizure was not for a moment questioned, and, the capture having been made within the restrictive wartJTTOOBEES. 405 limit, the British Government in no way called upon to interfere, so far as to attend to the complaint and requisition of the Chief of Koweit thai it should compel the release of the boats, and the restoration of their cargoes, still it was deemed advisable to recommend Mahomed bin Khaleefa, rather than incur the risk of a misunderstanding with that powerful chief, to comply with his wishes, on the understanding that he should not interfere further in the quarrel, nor again attempt to throw any aid or supplies into Demaum. After some trifling hesitation, this judicious counsel was acquiesced in. A few days after his arrival at Bushire, the ex-chief landed, and took up Ins residence in a bastion which had been prepared for his accom modation, while tents were pitched for the reception of his numerous followers, bringing his vessels (of which two only now remained with im) into the backwater, and drawing them up on shore He was received with marked attention by the local authorities : a salute of three rounds of musketry was fired by the Sirbaz garrison, who were all paraded on the occasion. It is hardly probable that sueh marks of respect would have been exhibited, unless under instructions from the Ameei of Shiraz and it was rumoured that Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed and WO f t a '? f a b0dy 0f t '' 00pS ' t0 0OnSist of 100 horse men and 500 infantry, and that, in addition to taking upon himself all the disbursements incurred in their equipment, had offered to pay a lar-e annual tribute to the Shah, and to leave his son as a hostage for the due fulfilment of this engagement. After waiting nearly three months for a reply to his proposition or some to ten o its being taken into favourable consideration, and finding was mere loss of time and labour, the ex-chief determined upon taking his departure. 1 n Visiting the Resident, he stated that his principal object in solicitino- an interview was to express his earnest hope that the friendship and coun enanee of the British Government, which he had formerly enjoyed or so many years, would be once more extended to him; that the feeling of his not being viewed by the British authorities with the same favour and good will which had once existed, weighed heavily upon him, and paralysed his efforls ; that he sought no aid or support in the rcco\ciy of his just rights beyond the belief that he might hope for the renewa, of the friendly countenance once afforded him ; and that the British Government would not possess a firmer and more devoted adherent t an himself In reply, the fact that his proceedings hadtot been satisfactory to the British Government was not disguised ^or e icjection of the overture made to support him in opposin.' the estabhsnment of the authority of Mahomed Ali Pacha ovc Bahreit the violation of the residence of the British Agent, by the seizure and406 UTTOOBEES. slaughter of those individuals who had taken refuge there ; the plunder of the goods of a British subject, by his followers, during the attack upon Munama; the seizure of British property from a boat carrying- British colours ; and the forcible robbery of the Charrak vessel by his adherents of the Huwajir Tribe, had certainly tended to diminish the friendly feelings entertained towards him. He endeavoured to explain these causes of umbrage to the British Government, and added, that his only reason for coming to Bushire was to seek a temporary refuge, while he matured his plans 5 that he was fully aware of the hollowness of the professions made by the Persian authorities of affording him aid in the recovery of Bahrein, but that he had made a convenience of them, to suit his own purposes. It was not doubted that the Shaikh was perfectly sincere in his wishes to remove the unfavourable impression his conduct had made upon the British Government; but no credit could be attached to his explanation regarding his motives for coming to Bushire ; for he was certainly at one time buoyed up by the extravagant promises and professions made to him by Shaikh Sulman, and it was only when he had reason to believe that these were without authority or foundation that he affected to despise them. The ex-chief's departure was probably hastened by the intelligence now received that the garrison of Demaum, so hardly pressed for provi sions, had been compelled to propose to Ameer Fysul the surrender of the fort, upon certain terms which had been rejected. On leaving Bushire,' he proceeded over to the neighbourhood of Bahrein, and attempted to send in a boat to them, with a supply of stores and provi sions ; but the blockading force were on the alert, and having succeeded in capturing the boat in question, despatched four Buteels in pursuit of the ex-chief. These, however, did not overtake him, and he found a temporary refuge at Koweit. &gt;The fort of Demaum very shortly after / surrendered, the garrison stipulating only for the safety of their lives, and permission to carry away their personal property. Nassir bin Abdoolla and his younger brother returned to Bahrein, but the elder brother, Moobaruk bin Abdoolla, the governor, fled with Shafee, the Chief of the Huwaiir, to join the Bedouin Tribes, towards Biddah. From Koweit, where on this occasion he had taken refuge, the ex-chief revisited Bushire, and, at his own special request, had an interview with the Resident on the sea shore, about three miles from the town, where he was unwilling, as he stated, but without giving his reasons, to land. His ostensible object proved to be, to consult the Resident regarding certain overtures, of a very favourable nature, he had icceived fiom t Wahabee ruler, urging that it was not to be supposed that the latter had volunteered to procure the restoration of his property, vessels, andTJTTOOBEES. 407 territorial possessions, without intending to bind him down by some stringent engagements ; but his real one was to ascertain what effect such an intimation would have, and whether the British Government was prepared to frustrate or supplant this anticipated paramount 'Wahabee influence on Bahrein, and take upon themselves the office volunteered by Fysul. He received in reply no encouragement, and was, moreover, assured that the British Government sought no territorial aggrandisement in this quarter, and had only one object, that of the suppression of piracy, and the maintenance of the tranquillity of these seas. At the present time (August 1844) the ex-chief resides at Nabend, on the Persian Coast, but most of his sons are located at Muharag, without enjoying, however, any share in the government of the island. Shaikh Moobaruk bin Abdoolla, it is reported, returned to Gattur, for the pur pose of meeting Mahomed bin Khaleefa, and coming to some amicable arrangement, but that the latter positively refused to confirm or execute the agreement entered into with the sons of the ex-chief, in the presence of Ameer Fysul, and consented only to the ex-chief's returning to leside on the island as a private individual, provided his conduct was guaranteed by the British Government,—a condition which he was aware would never be accepted. It appears improbable that Mahomed bin Khaleefa and his brothers, toe present Chiefs of Bahrein, will ever of themselves consent to the re-establishment of their grand uncle. Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed, at Bahrein j—at the same time, the deep jealousy of the power and independent bearing of Esai bin Tarif, entertained by the Khaleefa family, and growing desire to resist the encroachments of Ameer Fysul,* may induce them to give their consent to arrangements which, under other circumstances, they would have opposed by every means in their power.

Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa, still continued, and every possible plan was being resorted to by the refugee chief to induce the Persian Government to espouse his cause. They, on their part, had apparently entertained in a favourable light the proposals that were made to them, and showed, by the pomp and ceremony with which they received their visitor, on the occasion of his coming to Bushire in the early part of the year 1844, that there was at least a desire, if not an intention, to lend him assistance. The proceedings of the Persian .authorities were studiously watched by the Resident, and their every movement and expression represented by him to higher authority. It was thought advisable to check, in the outset, this uncalled for offi- ciousness on the part of Persia; instructions were accordingly issued by Her Majesty's Government to Colonel Sheil, begging him to acquaint the Persian Ministers that unless the right of the Shah to take part in the quarrels of rival claimants to the possession of Bahrein were beyond dispute, the interference of His Majesty would be viewed with much jealousy by the British Government in India, and might possibly lead to serious discussions with England. Such an announce ment as this, coming as it did from Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, tended, no doubt, to damp the ardour of the brotherly feeling shown by Persia to'Abdoolla bin Ahmed, and must likewise have blasted, for the present at least, all hopes that existed in the mind of the latter of obtaining assistance from that quarter. From this period the ex-chief commenced a roving style of life,— first repairing with his Buteels to the neighbourhood of Bahrein, then suddenly quitting the island in search of plunder, and, after perpetrating all manner of mischief, returning to his place of asylum on the Persian Coast. By the Resident, these proceedings were beheld with much dissatisfaction, and eventually led to the issue of a positive order, prohibiting him from a continuance of hostilities against the trade and possessions of Bahrein, so long as he chose to reside on the shores of Persia. Fully, however, to comprehend the policy of the British Govern ment with regard to the continued quarrels of the riyal chiefs, it is necessary that we should watch the movements and doings of either party, and also observe the line of conduct pursued by the British to wards them. Let us therefore proceed to consider a brief outline of all that occurred during the protracted struggle for the sovereignty of the Bahrein island. Shaikh Abdoolla had not been long at Nabend ere he set out on a cruise with his Buteels in the direction of his lost possessions, and pro ceeded into the immediate vicinity of Bahrein. His unexpected arrival in that quarter threw the pearl divers and others into a state of extreme alarm and confusion, and it was not until the ex-chief assured themUTTOOBEES, 409 that he had no intention to molest them,—that he was merely in search of the boats of the A1 Ali, whom he wished to encounter,—that their fears were in any way relieved. To effect his purpose, he sailed to Biddah in quest of Esai bin Tarif, but finding his enemy on the alert, and well able to resist, he returned to the neighbourhood of Bahrein, with out attacking him. Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa, when he heard of his arrival, sent a deputation of the principal merchants in the island to invite him ashore, and welcome him home ; the reply, however, sent by the haughty Abdoolla, that he required the fort of Muharag to be restored to him, together with other demcinds of a most preposterous character, pre cluding all hopes of a meeting being effected between himself and his relative, he quitted the place, and sailed to Kateef, whence, after des patching one of his sons on a friendly mission to the Wahabee Ameer, and the seizure of two small vessels on the Dabil Shoal, he retraced his steps to Nabend. The above seizure,-although it took place within the war limits of the restrictive line, and its legality was therefore not to be questioned, from the peculiar position of the ex-chief on Persian soil, it soon became manifest that Mahomed bin Khaleefa would be subjected to a seiies of attacks and annoyances from his rival, without being able to retaliate ; for the latter, at perfect liberty to carry on hostilities with in the restrictive line, would be constantly lying in wait for favourable opportunities to annoy the people of Bahrein, and, ere the injured paities could take steps lor effecting reprisals, would make good his escape beyond the limits of lawful warfare. It was highly necessary, therefore, to place matters upon a more equitable footing, and this could only be done in two ways,—either by effectually restraining the ex- chief so long as he resided on the Coast of Persia,'or by suspending the operation of the restrictive line, and permitting the Shaikh of Bahrein to puisue and attack Abdoolla bin Ahmed wheresoever he met him. ihe former mode had been already adopted towards Esai bin Tarif, Chief of the A1 Ali, who, when located on the island of Kenn, had sought to disturb the people and dependents of Abdoolla bin Ahmed^t the time he was Shaikh of Bahrein; but the isolated position of Kenn, and the ease with which our British cruisers could approach the place, rendered it a matter of no difficulty to bring Esai bin Tarif to an immediate account, should he refuse to refrain from hostilities ; whereas, in the case of the port of Nabend, which was difficult of access, unsheltered from the pre vailing winds, and formed part and parcel of the main land of Persia, there would be no way of punishing the offeiider save by a. recourse to blockade, or to a direct aggression upon Persian territory, by destroying his vessels, drawn up on the beach. The Resident therefore determined, in the eventof a complaint being preferred by the Shaikh of Bahrein, and exhortation failing to restrain the ex-chief, to adopt the latter mode of410 UTTOOBEES. the two proposed, pending a reference to the Bombay Government regarding it. He strove first, however, as a precautionary measure, by a written address to the Governor of Nabend, pointing out the risk he incurred of laying himself open to attacks from the Chief of Bahrein, should he permit his guest to molest the people of that island, to curb and check the hostile propensities of Shaikh Abdoolla. Nor did he write in vain ; this appeal to his feelings and interests was warmly responded to by Ahmed bin Syf, and followed up by the despatch of a confidential messenger to Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa, apologising for the conduct of Abdoolla bin Ahmed, and promising to do his utmost to restrain him. So far matters went smoothly enough ; but the ex-chief had no intention to permit of restraint being placed upon his actions: he had entered into an alliance with the Tribe of the Beni Malij, and they were at feud with Shaikh Ahmed bin Syf; and to show the latter how little he cared for his authority, he hastened to seize two more vessels of Bahrein. Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa, incensed at the injury, but more incensed at his inability to resent it, deputed his own brother, Shaikh Ali bin Khaleefa, to Bushire, to advocate his cause with the Resident, and to beg that officer either to coerce the ex-chief, or to give him permission to retaliate. Shaikh Ali was informed that an intimation would be conveyed to Abdoolla bin Ahmed, that unless he restored all the prizes he had made, and abstained for the future from mischief, the operation of the restrictive line would at once be suspended, and he left to the mercy of his more powerful enemy. Meanwhile, however, until a reply had been received to the above communication, affairs must remain on their present footing. The British Envoy at the capital was likewise apprised of all that was doing, and through his medium was an order issued to the Ameer of Fars, ' directing him to compel Abdoolla bin Ahmed to restore the boats he had taken at Bahrein, and to adopt measures for preventing disorders so injurious to the commerce of the Gulf.' Plainly perceiving that a refusal to abide by the directions of the Resident would only be detrimental to his own interests, the ex- chief gave a verbal assurance, that so long as he remained within the territories of His Majesty the Shah, he would abstain from aggressions upon the trade and dependents of Bahrein. This announced intention he shortly after found himself compelled to obey, for the British Govern ment wrote up stringent instructions to the Residentj desiring him to prohibit Abdoolla bin Ahmed from committing any acts of aggression upon Bahrein soil or trade, so long as he was located in I ei^ia; and the ex-chief having shown a reluctance to confirm in writing the veibal promise he had given, a vessel of war was at once despatched to inform him that he was under restraint, whether he wished it or no.UTTOOBEES. 411 Before prosecuting this part of the narrative, it is necessary to de- a. d. 1845 scribe a case of piracy committed in the early part of the year by Humeed bin Mujdell, of the Amayir Tribe, and to relate the steps that were taken to obtain redress from that lawless chief. A vessel of Karrack, under the command of one Abdoolla, having taken in a cargo of wheat at Bunder Reig, proceeded over to Kateef. On enteiing the backwater, Abdoolla spied three Buggalows coming towards him, one of which, being considerably ahead of the others, approached his boat, and, after a series of manoeuvres, boarded her, and made her a prize. The two other Buggalows, both vessels of Koweit, on one occasion hailed the captors, to know what boat they had taken ; whereupon the Amayir Chief threatened to cut off the heads of his captives if they dared to utter a syllable. Some two days after the capture 'they reached Has Boo Ali, where they anchored, and plunder ed the Buggarah of everything she contained, viz. cargo, arms, cloths, &amp;c. to the value of 1,500 Mahomed Shah rupees'; and when the Nakhoda lepresented that the property they were plundering belonged to a person under British protection, Humeed bin Mujdell laughed him to scorn, and said « Who are the English ? ' The crew were then liberated, and, being allowed to leave the place in their Buggarah, they made their way back to Karrack, and related all that had occurred to them. After some investigation, it was ascertained by the Resident that the Amayir Chief ' having broken friendship with part of his tribe,' had, previous to committing the piracy, ^een compelled to quit his usual place of abode, Jazirat Boo Ali, and taken refuge within the dominions of Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa, who treated him kindly, and supplied him with arms and ammunition. He had not been long, however, with his new master, ere he repaired with a number of followers to a 'small island, named Gunna, which lies near the entrance of the backwater situate between Jazirat Boo Ali and Ras Draeeda. There he took up his quarters, and there, relying upon the strength of his position, he vaunted himself upon his deed of piracy, and expressed his utter contempt for any endeavours the English might make to bring him to punishment. The piracy was of too open a character to be treated lightly, or 'to admit of a compromise being made regarding it.' In the month of May, accordingly, the Resident deputed his Assistant, Captain Kem- baH, with two vessels of the squadron, to Gunna, for the purpose of obtaining full satisfaction from Humeed bin Mujdell. Commodore Hawkins, too, proceeded in person, to superintend and carry into exe cution any measures that officer might be pleased to suggest; and two Native Buggarahs, fully armed and equipped, were engaged'to accom-412 UTTOOBEES. pany the expedition. When the naval force approached the pirate's den, and Humeed bin Mujdell was called upon to afford redress for the wrongs he had committed, he sent back a reply of haughty defiance : he declared his perfect indifference for any plans the British vessels might think fit to adopt, and spoke in somewhat boastful terras of the deed he had done. The bold and resolute conduct of the Commodore, however, quickly brought the chief to his senses ; for notwithstanding the strength of his position, and the numerous shoals that surrounded it,—so difficult of access that the Coote could not approach within five miles of it, and even the schooner Constance, after threading her way through an intricate channel, with frequently only six inches of water under her keel, was unable to get within effective range of her guns,— daylight of the morning succeeding their arrival found the town and vessels of the Amayir Chief closely confronted with a formidable line of gunboats, in battle array, all ready to pour forth their contents should resistance be offered, or satisfaction denied ; and the insolent tone of contumacy hitherto held by the haughty pirate was instantly changed into one of profound submission. He hastened to wait upon Captain Kemball, and to pray for mercy, and finished by surrendering his Buggalow* as a pledge for the payment of the demands preferred against him. Thus were brought to a successful issue, without loss of life, or blood shed, the operations against Humeed bin Mujdell, which, though short in duration, when we consider the terrific heat of the sun in the month of June, the risk incurred by the vessels, and the exposure to which their crews were of necessity subjected, must be pronounced to have been both arduous and harassing. AVe now revert to the rival chiefs. In October 1845, a letter reached the Resident from Abdoolla bin Ahmed, intimating his intention to leave the Persian Coast, and proceed to Kateef, for the purpose of recommencing hostilities. Kateef was at that time held by a Wahabee Governor, Abdoolla bin Saeed, who, although professing feelings of amity for the Shaikhs of Bahrein, was well known to be secretly planning an attack upon their island. It is not unlikely, therefore, that the ex-chief, who had lately received intelligence from the Wahabee Ameer, was invited to join in common ^ cause with the Kateef Governor, and repair to his neighbourhood, with a view to aid in displacing Mahomed bin Khaleefa. The bland de meanour and loud professions of friendship that were made by Abdoolla bin .Saeed, in lieu of producing the desired effect upon the Uttoobee * The Buggalow was redcfcraeil in the month of October 1845, by the pa5 'nient of 2,059 Mahomed Shah rupees in hard coin, and the deposit of property to the value of the balance of 141 Mahomed Shah rupees.UTTOOBEES. 413 Chief, appear to have roused his apprehensions, and led him to act with\ a singular degree of energy ; for not only did he positively refuse to acknowledge the sincerity of the Wahabee's advances, but he responded \ thereto by placing the ports of Kateef and Oojeer in a state of blockade. He also employed Humeed bin Mujdell as his recognised dependent, to assist him in the undertaking—an unwise and impolitic measure ; for however unscrupulous, however ready to perpetrate any act that might be required of him, such an ally as Humeed bin Mujdell could hardly fail to lead his superior into all manner of difficulty, either by actual deeds of violence upon those that should be friends, or by a sudden resistance to his master's authority. Indeed, when we carefully study the character of Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa, and observe the tone of his behaviour towards those beneath him, we can neither praise his justice nor commend his policy. We have already seen him heaping favours innumerable upon the faithless Humeed bin Mujdell, a creature of lawless impulse,—one ready to forsake his cause so soon as a likeli hood of obtaining better favours from others lay spread before him; and we presently find him receiving with the utmost formality and coldness a new and powerful ally, one richly deserving of reciprocation of friend ship,—I allude to the noble Esai bin Tarif; with so much coldness, indeed, that we aie struck with astonishment at the length of time and the faithfulness with which he adhered to his master's cause. While affairs were in this condition, Abdoolla bin Ahmed made a stealthy approach in the direction of Kateef, and, having landed a messenger at Tanoorah, despatched him with letters to his son Moobaruk, and to Abdoolla bin Saeed, informing them of his being in the vicinity, and telling them to be on the alert, and ready for action. He promised to decoy the blockading force away from Kateef, by feigning an attack upon their vessels, and enticing them to leave the port in pursuit of himself, at which favourable moment he hoped no difficulty would be experienced by his son in carrying the island of Bahrein. The plan was plausible enough, and might, perhaps, have succeeded : the letters, however, were never destined to reach the parties for whom they were intended ; they fell into the hands of the Amayir, who immediately carried them over to Shaikh Ali bin Khaleefa! and laid bare the plot that was about to be aimed at the overthrow of his brother. Preparations were set on foot without delay to with stand and defeat any attack that might be meditated on the island, and vessels were sent without the port, to waylay and oppose the advanc ing fleet of Abdoolla bm Ahmed. The latter made bis appearance at the appointed time, but quickly found himself compelled to retire for long ere reaching the port of Kateef he perceived the hostile armament sailing towards him. He withdrew, accordingly, with all the speed in414 UTTOOBEES. his power, and made good his escape from the hand of the enemy : and finding that all his plans were frustrated, he determined to visit Koweit, and there he arrived in safety, after effecting the seizure of a Bahrein Gooncha he fell in with on the way. When the Resident became acquainted with all the occurrences I have related, he wrote word to Mahomed bin Khaleefa, that for any acts of piracy that might be committed by Humeed bin Mujdeil he would be held responsible by the British Government, that chief having become his constituted de pendent, and therefore amenable to his authority. He also addressed the Shaikh of Koweit, expressing a hope that he would not permit the ex-chief to commit aggressions upon the trade of Bahrein so long as he remained within his territory. Matters continued somewhat in the same condition (Shaikh Abdoolla residing at Koweit, and Mahomed bin Khaleefa keeping up the blockade of the ports of Kateef and Oojeer) until the summer of 1846, when the Wahabee Governor of the former port (Kateef) had the presumption to address the Resident, telling him that unless he took measures to expel the Amayir Chief from the position he held, and made him restore a Gooncha and five boats he had seized belonging to people of Kateef, he would let loose the Beni Hajir and other tribes to commit all manner of piracy. By way of reply to the above threat, Abdoolla bin Saeed was honoured with a visit from two British cruisers, that were sent to warn him in a friendly manner of the treatment he might expect to receive should he dare to carry into execution his haughty menace. At this juncture, too, the Persian Ministers seemed once more inclined to espouse the cause of Abdoolla bin Ahmed; and notwith standing the distinct intimation they had received that interference by them with the affairs of the island of Bahrein would not be tolerated by the British Government in India, the Regent of Fars went so far as to invite the ex-chief in June 1846 to repair to Bushire, where, he assured him, he should be liberally entertained at the expense of His Highness, and could remain in peace and quiet until such time as his plans were matured, and the season for action had arrived. Whether or not His Majesty the Shah had any intention to revive his asserted right to the sovereignty of Bahrein, or whether the Regent of Fars had merely invited the ex-chief in hopes of being able to realize from him an amount of tribute, it is difficult to say, and also, from the turn that took place in affairs, a matter of but little importance; for Abdoolla bin Ahmed, influenced no doubt by the favourable recep tion he met with from Shaikh Jaubir (Chief of Koweit), and buoyed up, perhaps, with the expectation of assistance from that chief, did not seemUTTOOBEES. 415 inclined to trust himself anew to Persian protection, knowing, as he did, that they neither could nor intended to support him. He therefore, in August 1846, politely declined the invitation he had received, and begged leave to inform His Highness that a combination of circumstances pre cluded his availing himself of the aid and hospitality he so graciously proffered. In the month of September 1846, shortly after making the above refusal, he re-visited the neighbourhood of Kateef, and took up his quarters in the immediate vicinity of Demaum. His sudden re-ap pearance caused the blockade of the port of Kateef, that had of late been somewhat relaxed, to be strictly enforced again, and led to two engagements between the land forces of Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa and the Kateef Governor, wherein, however, the ex-chief took no personal part, and which terminated pretty evenly for both the belligerents, the Bahrein Shaikh proving victorious on the one occasion, and Abdoolla bin Saeed on the other. Either party now applied to the Resident for permission to call in certain allies to join his cause, and in either case did the Resident refuse to comply. First came the Go vernor of Kateef, petitioning him in October 1846 to permit the Mari time Chiefs of Oman to aid him with their naval force against Mahomed bin Khaleefa. His request could not of course be granted ; the British Government considered them all to be independent chiefs, and with one and all had they entered into treaties, whereby each one of their number bound himself to keep the peace, and not to disturb the tranquillity of the seas. Now it was plain that, if one party coalesced with the Governor of Kateef, and another with the Shaikh of Bahrein,— and this would infallibly happen,—they would wage war the one upon the other, and create maritime disorder. On such grounds did the Resident decline to permit any one of the Shaikhs to proceed to the assistance of Abdoolla bin Saeed, and for the same reasons, too, when Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa shortly after sought the help of the Shaikh of Debaye (November 1846), was a refusal of necessity given. In the early part of the ensuing year (1847), at a time when Abdoolla A p 1847 bin Ahmed was quartered at Tirhoot, without any followers, and war was still raging between Kateef and Bahrein, a quarrel took place betwixt Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa and the Amayir Chief, which ended in the eventual secession of the latter from his master's authority. Some of his principal men went over toNujd to make their peace with the Wahabee ruler; others opened a correspondence with the Governor of Kateef, in order to effect a reconciliation with him;—the whole, in fact, of the Amayir Tribe416 UTTOOBEES. forsook the cause of the Bahrein Chief, and united themselves to the Wahabees, which caused Mahomed bin Khaleefa to address the Resi dent, informing him that Humeed bin Mujdell, having renounced his allegiance, he could no longer be held responsible for any irregularities that chief might think fit to commit. Somewhat later in the season (August), an amicable arrangement was entered into between Ameer Fysul and the ruler of Bahrein, by the terms of which the Ameer pledged himself, although he took Abdoolla bin Ahmed under his protection, and gave him asylum at Lahsa, not to aid or abet the ex-chief in any measures he might be pleased to adopt with a view to the re-establishment of his own authority. Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa engaged on his side to pay the Wahabee tlje sum of 4,000 dollars; and thus for a time terminated the protracted struggle between the Shaikh of Bahrein and the people of Ameer Fysul. Scarcely, however, had Abdoolla bin Ahmed taken up his abode at Lahsa, under the wing of the Ameer, than his discontented spirit began once more to cry aloud, and to crave a fresh recurrence to mischief. He suddenly left the place, and returned to Demaum, where he launched one of his vessels, with the supposed intention of proceeding to Kenn, for the purpose of entering into a confederacy with the dis contented Uttoobees on that island against Mahomed bin Khaleefa. The fears of the latter chief were at once revived : his mind, never at ease, became haunted with pictures of nought but attacks and conspiracies to depose him ; nor were those fears relieved by the unlocked for defection of his dependent, Esai bin Tarif, who took offence at some proceeding on the part of his master, formed a coalition with ' his former deadly enemy, the ex-chief, and demanded from Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa the restoration of the vessels and possessions of his grand uncle, Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed.' Preparations were set on foot by either party for an immediate re course to maritime hostilities, and a collision would no doubt have ensued, had it not been for the opportune arrival of Commodore Lowe, in the Elphinstone, who placed an interdict upon any engagement at sea until the sanction of the Resident had been fully obtained. In due course of time this permission was granted, and hostilities commenced. An engagement took place on the mainland near Fowarit, between the troops of Esai bin Tarif and those of Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa, the latter commanded by-the Shaikh in person, which ended fatally to the A1 Ali side, who lost their chief, and were signally defeated. Whatever prospects of success might have been hitherto held by Ab doolla bin Ahmed must now have been effectually blasted, for not only was he deprived of the services of a strong and powerful ally by ^ lP* UTTOOBEES. 417 death of Esai bin Tarif, but he had violated his engagement to the Resident, by proceeding to the Persian Coast in quest of reinforcements, and thereby forfeited all right to prosecute warfare against Bahrein, and rendered his vessels liable to seizure by the British cruisers. Previous to the action above referred to. Shaikh Mahomed bin Kha- leefa had expressed to the Resident, in the strongest terms, the ap prehension he felt lest an attack should be made upon his island by the confederate chiefs, and had sought permission either to proceed against the Uttoobees located on the island of Ges, and bring them back to submission, or to be furnished with a guarantee that no aggres sion on their part against his possessions would be tolerated by the British Government. These were questions, in the opinion of the Resident, of too great weight and importance to permit of a reply being given before consulting the opinion of higher authority, and were therefore referred for the decision of Government, who wrote back instructions, that in the event of any attempts being made upon Bahrein, such attempts were to be resisted by the naval force in the Gulf, Intelligence of such vital importance to the interests of the Bahrein Chief it was not deemed advisable to communicate, for Shaikh Ma homed bin Khaleefa, once more relieved from apprehension's by the death of Esai bin Tarif, and by the utter failure of all Abdoolla bin Ahmed's endeavours to induce the Uttoobee refugees in Ges to es pouse his side, it was thought that were he once assured of support from the British in the hour of danger, he would be lulled into a state of security, and cease to trouble himself with the adoption of measures necessary for the defence of his territories. We now arrive at a point in our narrative more than usually interesting. The small but fruitful island of Bahrein appears at different seasons to have excited in an extraordinary degree the ambitious desires of divers nations. His Majesty the Shah, or the authorities under him, we have already seen, had on two separate occasions manifested an inclina tion to assert a right of supremacy over it; the Imaum of Muskat has from time immemorial longed and craved to possess the fertile spot; and now we find the Turkish authorities intriguing, and seeking to induce Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa to renounce his state of independence, and own his allegiance to the Ottoman Porte. A letter was addressed by the Mootasellim of Bussora to the above chief, inviting him to acknowledge his dependence on the Sultan, and to ' furnish lists of his vessels, crews, &amp;c., in order that the requisite registers* might be prepared and forwarded.' A Turkish brig of war, too, visited the Gulf, and although she did not actually repair to Bahrein, the better perhaps418 UTT00BEE9. to conceal her designs, still there seemed no doubt that an effort was being made by the Porte to extend its influence over the Arab Tribes in the Persian Gulf. Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa sent, it is true, an evasive reply to the communication he had received from the Mootasellim of Bussora; but yet, from the tenor of a conversation held by him with the Resident, complaining that double duties had been levied from the vessels of his subjects and dependents by the custom house authorities at Bombay, and urging that no such demand had been made upon the ships of those who owned allegiance either to the Shah or the Imaum of Muskat, that unless the British authorities therefore refrained from enforcing extra fees and customs from his people, he would be compelled to follow the example of the Shaikh of Koweit, and place himself under the guardianship of the Porte,—it became manifest, that if the British Government in India wished to preserve their paramount influence in the Persian waters they must adopt measures to rectify the present irregularities, by coming to a speedy understanding with the Bahrein Chief. The harbour fees, &amp;c. alluded to by Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa had been levied in consequence of his vessels not being furnished with the requisite passes; yet, to show him how unwilling the British authorities were in any way to alienate or estrange his affections, the amounts were subsequently refunded, and he was informed that for the future all Bahrein vessels leaving the Gulf must be provided with registers, signed by the Resident, ' else would they render themselves liable to the extra duties levied on foreign vessels entering Bombay harbour.' The Resident, too, was instructed to ascertain the feelings of Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa, and whether or not he was inclined to enter into a closer connection with the British ; also to avoid as far as practicable all discussion with the Turkish authorities relative to the designs they had in view of establishing a supremacy over the island, as the matter was being referred for the decision and judg ment of the Home authorities. v • The Persian Consul at Bagdad wrote strong letters of encouragement to Abdoolla bin Ahmed, assuring him of the support of the Shah towards the re-establishment of himself in his lost dominions, and begging him to make every preparation for carrying into effect the plans he might have in contemplation,—however momentous, however gigantic,—Persian assistance, full and powerful, would most surely be accorded him. Another letter did the same functionary addiess to the ruling Shaikh of the island, teeming with false assurances of fiiend- ship and amity ; urging upon him in the blandest terms the great feeling of interest felt by His Majesty the Shah in his prosperityUTTOOBEES. 419 and welfare,—a letter, in fact, one tissue of falsehoods,—neither more nor less than a ruse to blind and mislead the understanding of the self- sufficient Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa. These attacks upon Bahrein independence were duly represented to the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, who wrote in reply that Meerza Abdool Jabbur (Persian Consul at Bagdad), in perfect ignorance of the relations existing between the ruler of Bahrein and the British Govern ment, had thought it a clear matter of duty on his part to do all in his power to further the views of Abdoolla bin Ahmed, who, from the day of his downfall, had been treated with so much consideration and respect by the Persian Government, but that now he was aware of the inteiest taken in Bahrein by the British State, he would abstain from further interference with the affairs of the island. Not many months after this had occurred. Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa himself expressed a wish to the Resident that Bahrein should be taken under British protection. The Resident, who had been called upon to give his opinion as to the advisability or otherwise of entering into an alliance with the rulers of that island, had in the outset inclined against the measure ; but the spontaneous offer of allegiance now preferred by Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa, combined with other Circumstances, led that officer to alter his opinion, and to recommend the immediate acceptance of the proffer made by the chief. After much considera tion, however, the Government of India, considering it inexpedient to make any alteration in the character of the relations then subsisting between the British Government and the Chief of Bahrein, and the Home Government concurring in that view, the Resident at Bushire was in September 1849 directed to decline the offer of the Chief of Bahrein, assuring him at the same time of the continuance of the good will and friendship of the British Government, In this wise termi nated the long discussion, protracted over a period of more than two years, respecting the proposed alliance with the Shaikh of Bahrein. A few occurrences worthy of notice have been of necessity passed over during the relation of other matters that engrossed our attention, and must be briefly described ere passing on to the consideration of future events. At the latter end of the preceding year. Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa made an unsuccessful attempt to induce the Shaikh of Charrak to expel from Kenn the Bahrein fugitives who had taken refuge on that island. He also behaved most improperly in the matter of one Khaleefa, of the Gubeysat Tribe, who committed a number of piracies amongst others, one upon a vessel belonging to his own dependents' and who, although detained by the Shaikh for a time, at the instance of 55420 UTTOOBEES. the British Agent was eventually set at liberty, ere a reply to a reference made on the subject by Hajee Jassim had been received. This proceeding being, in point of fact, nothing more or less than a direct violation of an agreement entered into with the British Agent, was strongly condemned by Colonel Hennell, and led to a humble apology being offered Jay the Shaikh for his unfaithful conduct, together with a promise that he would do his utmost to seize and detain both Khaleefa and his vessel. From the day that Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa had assumed the reins of government, his mind had been one continued succession of hopes and fears; and no sooner had he been relieved from some heavy weight of anxiety or impending calamity, than the clouds were again observed to gather, and fresh troubles assailed him. About this period occurred the death, at Muskat, of Abdoolla bin Ahmed, who had touched at that port on his way to Zanzibar, whither he was proceeding on a visit to his once deadly enemy, the Imaum of Muskat, hoping to be able to prevail upon His Highness to aid him in the recovery of his lost possessions. Such an occurrence as this tended, no doubt, greatly to dissipate the fears entertained by Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa. Tile relief, however, was not of long duration, for four of the principal merchants of the Bahrein island, disgusted, it was said, with the arbitrary proceedings of the Shaikh, had in January 1849 secretly fled to the Persian Coast, and, taking up their quarters upon the island of Kenn, united themselves to the disaffected Uttoobee^, who, already strong in numbers, being joined by parties of such weight and influence as these, became a most formidable enemy, and increased the alarm of the Shaikh to so great an extent that he deputed his brother. Shaikh Ali, to Bushire, to seek aid and advice from the Resident. Shaikh Ali was told, on arrival, that although the British Government would never permit of an expedition being organised from the Persian Coast for the purpose of attacking Bahrein, and the British cruisers would most assuredly seize or destroy any armed vessels found proceeding with such intent, yet, there being many and distant calls for the services of the vessels of the squadron, it was highly necessary that Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa should keep a strict look-out, and be well prepared to resist any sudden or unexpected attack that might, perchance, be made upon his territories during the absence of the ships of war. The Resident also strongly counselled him to strive, by conciliatory measures, to induce the seceders to return and settle upon the island. How far he followed the advice of the Resident does not appear, but through the intervention of that officer was a reconciliation subsequently effected between the Shaikh of Bahrein and \oosoof bin Ibrahim, the most influential of the four merchants who seceded from theUTTOOBEES. 421 island. This person, together with two other seceders (Shaikh Mahomed bin feaeed, and Shaikh Jassim bin Mahomed), were conveyed to Bahrein by one of the British vessels, and, after some discussion and hesitation, i f matters were, in June 1849, amicably arranged between Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa and themselves. In the following year (1850) a piracy was committed by some a. d . 1850. Bedouins of the Huwajir Tribe upon a Gooncha of Karrack. Towards the close of the month of June, the latter vessel 'left Karrack with a crew of six men, and a cargo of wheat and barley, for Kateef.' On arrival off Ras Tanoora, Abdool Rahman, hei Nakhoda, was suddenly attacked by a party of twenty-six of the Huwajir Tribe, who were returning to their country in a Bah rein Buggarah, and, after a show of resistance, was compelled to sur render up his boat and people to the mercy of the pirates, who took them to the mainland, and stripped them of all they possessed. The Resident had frequently warned the Chief of Bahrein that for any piratical acts committed by the Bedouins of the Huwajir Tribe he would be held responsible by the British Government, for not only had he connected himself by marriage with the people of that tribe, but he permitted them to frequent Bahrein in considerable numbers, and was, moreover, known to be secretly encouraging them in the prosecution o their lawless proceedings. Demands were accordingly made upon Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa for the payment of 100 Tomans, by way of compensation to the Nakhoda and crew, and instructions were issued to Commodore Porter to communicate with the chief and point out to him the necessity of an immediate compliance with the Resident s requisitions. No measures of coercion proved necessary on this occasion, for notwithstanding the constant assertions of Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa that he did not consider himself answerable for the acts of the Huwajir Tribe, he paid over without demur the 100 Tomans required from him, and brought the matter to a speedv settlement. r J Scarcely had he adjusted the affair, however, apparently too with ess reluctance than he was wont to display in cases of demands being preferred against him, than he suddenly plunged into the other ^ extreme, and adopted a line of behaviour at once insolent and inexcusable towards the British Government. He received a number of letters from the Resident on the subject of certain com- p aints he had made to the British Agent regarding the death of one of his subjects, and at the contents of those communications he took of- fence, and sent back messages to Colonel Hennell, through Haiee Jassim of .he most «insulting and unbecoming eharaeter' ^mLagirappl' : not only to himself in person, but reflecting upon the British422 UTTOOBEES. vernment also. Explanation was demanded, and a ship of war des patched for the purpose of receiving the explanation. Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa, repenting the hastiness of his conduct, deputed his brother, Shaikh Ali, to Bushire, to offer his humblest apologies, and to crave the Resident's forgiveness. The Resident declared his willingness (October 1850) to forgive all that had been said so far as concerned himself alone, but as the expressions used by Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa 'bore reference to the British Govern ment as well as to himself. Colonel Hennell considered it due to the dignity of the former, that on the first occasion of the Commodore proceeding to Bahrein the Uttoobee Chief should visit him on board his ship, and personally express his regret that anything incautiously spoken by himself, in a moment of irritation, should have been consider ed offensive or disrespectful to the British Government; and to this suggestion Shaikh Ali readily consented on the part of his brother.' We are now on the eve of great events,—of disturbances that again arose between Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa and the ^/Vahabee Ameer. Fresh complications are presented to our view ;—new dis orders, in new shapes and new forms, of so violent and so dangerous a character, at this period occurred, that the Bahrein island was con vulsed, and well nigh falling a prey to the combined attacks upon its independence. Some three years before, it will be remembered, a peace was concluded between the Uttoobee Chief and Ameer Fysul. This peace had run a course smooth and uninterrupted, either party adhering to the terms whereunto he had pledged himself, until the present time, when divers matters transpired to engender a feeling of jealousy and enmity, which shortly after led to a rupture. In the month of April 1850, Syud bin Mootluk repaired to the neigh bourhood of Bahrein, and, on arrival, deputed his son on a visit to Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa, who received his guest with the utmost formality and coldness, and permitted him to leave the island without showing him the slightest mark of honour or respect. Howevei imprudent such an act on the part of the Shaikh may have been, how ever likely to be attended with grave results,—we cannot with justice blame his conduct; for only a short time previous to this occurrence Mahomed bin Abdool Raheem had been sent by Ameer Fysul on a mission to Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa, and every attention, every show of distinction had been heaped upon the envoy, who quitted Bahrein loaded with presents, and highly elated with the treatment he had experienced. These presents, these favours, one and all did they rob him of, when he returned to Kateef, and by order of the Ameer they confined Mahomed bin Abdool Raheem for having accepted theUTTOOBEES. 423 gifts above mentioned. It was not likely, therefore, that Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa, after such insults as these had been offered to his dignity,—after such indignities had been heaped upon one he had honoured, and merely because it was he that had honoured him,—would be eager to receive with grace or courtesy persons that might in future be deputed to his island on the part of the Wahabees. Shaikh Ma homed bin Kaleefa, when the above affronts occurred, remonstrated strongly with the Ameer, and went so far as to threaten to blockade the port of Kateef unless the envoy he had caused to be imprisoned were at once released, and unless fitting apologies were made for the unwarrantable acts he had been guilty of. Such was the posture of affairs in the spring of 1850, and in such a position did they remain until the commence- a. d* ibol # x* i • ment ot the ensuing year, when dangers began to thicken, and Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa to tremble for the integrity of his dominions. Ameer Fysul arrived within two stages of Biddah; the inhabitants of the towns on the Guttur Coast (Fuwarit, Wukra, Doah, &amp;c,) deserted the side of the Bahrein ruler, and went over to that of the Wahabee; negotiations that had for a long period been carried on, through the intervention of the Resident, to strive and induce the sons of the ex-chief to accept an annual allowance, and abide peaceably on the island of Kenn, had utterly failed ;—indeed in the month of July affairs had reached a crisis truly imminent. Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa, against his better judgment, had made offers to the Ameer of compromising matters, by the payment of a small yearly tribute, and these offers had been rejected with scorn, and replied to by demands of an exorbitant character ; the sons of the ex- chief had been invited to leave the Persian Coast, and join the Wahabee. It is needless entering further into detail on this matter : suffice it to ! say, that in the end of July 1851 a peace was concluded, through the good offices of Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon, between Ameer Fysul and Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa. The fort of Biddah, too, was handed back to Shaikh Ali bin Khaleefa, and the Wahabee Ameer returned to Lahsa. The rest of oar narrative, though extending over a period of more than two years, can be told in the fewest words. It comprises scarcely anything new, but is a mere repetition of olden scenes and olden fears. We have the launching of Buteels and the expectation of attacks; seeking the Resident's advice, and speaking disparagingly of him for giving advice ; the oppression of subjects, and the flight of the oppressed ; the deputing of envoys, armed with full powers, to effect agreements, and the return of the envoys, to be censured for the agree-424 UTTOOBEES. ments they had effected ;—such, and such only, is the character of the doings of Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa during the remaining portion of this narrative ; and having already entered so fully into detail on the subject of the occurrences that took place during his late struggle with the Wahabees, and other foes, and as it is chiefly with the same foes that we have still to deal, it can hardly be necessary to do more than describe with the utmost brevity the few facts that remain to be told. The peace so happily concluded during the summer of 1851 was in danger of being again disturbed early in the ensuing year, by the precipitate conduct of Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa, who commenced complaining aloud, and bitterly inveighing against Ameer Fysul, for locating the surviving sons of Abdoolla bin Ahmed on the island of Demaum. He would not, he said, so long as they remained in the above locality, disburse one farthing of tribute ; he would not allow himself to be trifled with, either by his kinsmen or by the Wahabee. Matters began once more to wear an unsettled appearance, and might in the end have proved serious, had not Captain Kemball, the Acting Resident, strongly counselled him to adopt a conciliatory rather than an arrogant tone of behaviour,—'to disarm rather than defy the Wahabee.' His brother, Shaikh Ali, too, a chief in every sense more temperate and wise than himself, did all in his power to restrain him, and succeeded, by dint of argument, in persuad ing him to pay the instalment of tribute that had now become due, and which a person on the part of the Ameer had been deputed to receive. The storm blew over, and for a short period the Uttoobee Chief showed more than his usual discretion. He deputed envoys to Bushire, to represent to the Resident the fears he entertained that a powerful combination was being secretly formed against him ; that the Imaum of Muskat was planning an attack upon his island; that Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon, not long since an ally, as also his recusant kinsmen, one and all were ready to join the league, with a view to ensure his down fall. These fears Captain Kemball in a great measure contrived to dissipate, but at the same time he advised the chief in no way to relax his efforts in defence of his territories; that although he did not actually apprehend that contingencies such as he foretold would arise, yet was it highly incumbent upon him to be well prepared to resist any sudden attack that might perchance be made on his territories. Other matters there were, submitted by the envoys : they revived the subject of accommodation proposed to be effected between their superior. Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa, and the sons of the ex -chief; they solicited the Resident's good offices to strive and induce Yoosoof bin Ibrahim to return and reside upon their island. In reply, Captain Kemball commenced by expressing his surprise andUTTOOBEES. 425 astonishment at the treatment he had so lately experienced at the hands of the Chief of Bahrein. That chief, said the Resident, had begged and craved his interposition to bring about an amicable settlement between himself and his recusant kinsmen ; that chief had, in the presence of the British Agent, made use of expressions both uncalled for and dis respectful to himself,—the British representative. To sum up in a few words Shaikh Ali, the last and most influen tial of the envoys deputed, after being reminded of the insulting language that had been held by his brother, supplied a written docu ment, specifying that to such and such terms would Shaikh Mahomed agiee, and in such and such places would he permit his kinsmen to reside ; he also begged the Resident to forget the past, and accede to interest himself in his brother's behalf. Captain Kemball, notwithstanding the wayward demeanour of Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa, being placed in possession of the exact terms that were to be offered, and thinking the general interests of peace would be benefited by an amicable settlement, agreed to sound the feelings of the sons of the late Abdoolla bin Ahmed, and, if possible, without however in any way compromising the British Government, to effect an arrangement. The Uttoobee Chief had no sooner ascertained the particulars of the interview held by his brother with the Resident, and become acquainted with the favourable issue of his mission, than he showed a disposition to withdraw from the terms that had been agreed upon. It is scarcely necessary to add that no accommodation was eventually effected; the sons of the late Abdoolla bin Ahmed continued to reside at Demaum, where they were kindly, and even liberally entertained by the Wahabee ruler. One more point remains to be noticed. Yoosoof bin Ibrahim refused \ to return to his home, unless the Resident would promise ' to shield him from future molestation'; and as Captain Kemball would not consent for an instant to such a proposal, the idea of a return was banished from his mind for ever. Shaikh Yoosoof continued for a length of time to reside at Bushire, a. d. 1853. an( ^ subsequently left for Lingah, where, in 1 the summer of the year 1853, he fell sick and died.

This sect was founded about the year 1615, by an Arab of the name of Shaikh Mahomed, the son of Abdool Wahab, whose name they have taken. Shaikh Mahomed connected himself, in the attempt to reform the religion of his country, with Ebin Saood, the Prince of Deriah, the capital of the province of Nujd. Through the efforts of the saint, and the aid of the temporal power of Ebin Saood, and his son and successor Abdool Azeez, the religion of the Wahabees was established all over the peninsula of Arabia. The leading principle of the sect is to destroy and plunder all who differ from them ; and those Mahomedans who do not adopt their creed were represented as far less entitled to mercy than either Jews or Christians. The first mention made of this in the Bombay records is in the year 1787. 2. Abdool Wahab, the Shaikh, inhabited the Desert about eight days' journey westward of the town of Kateef, on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf. 3. Urged by the tenets of their religion, they bad long threatened to destroy all those who acknowledged and followed the religious precepts of the Prophet. The Montific, Beni Khalid, and Anisa Arabs collected in that year a large force, under the command of Shaikh Tweney, of the first-mentioned tribe, and proceeded on an expedition against the Wahabees: it was not attended, however, with any &amp; 7 0 advantage. 4. The Wahabee Shaikh had before 1795, in prosecution of his ambitious views, taken Lahsa, annihilated the power of the Beni Khalid Arabs, and threatened Bussora. The fears of the Turkish Government of Bagdad were ex cited by these events. 5. An Arab force was detached by the Pacha against the 'W ahabee&gt;, under the command of Shaikh Tweney, who, having been killed in an action on the 3rd July, led to the failure of the expedition. Prepa rations were however made by the Pacha for the prosecution of the war during the course of the winter. a. d. 1797.WAHABEE3. 429 6. It was not, however, until the following year, that the Kia Pacha a. d. 1798 proceeded with a large army on an expedition against Lahsa and Deriah, the principal towns belonging to the Wahabees; and with the view also of observing the conduct of several Arab Tribes inhabiting the country between Bussora and the south-eastern shore of the Persian Gulf, the predatory incur sions of the Wahabee Arabs having extended to the banks of the Euphrates, and the vicinity of Hilla, situated on that river, fifty miles from Bagdad. 7. On the Pacha's arrival at Moghil, on the 2nd of December, great preparations were made by the Musleem for co-operating in the expedition, in which the Bussora, Grane, and Montific Arabs were to join. Bussora was at this time threatened by the Imaum of Muskat, on account of some ancient claims on the Pacha of Bagdad ; and to enable him to execute his hostile intentions, the Imaum had negotiated a peace with his formidable enemy, Suggur bin Rashid, the Joasmee Chief. 8. The Pacha of Bagdad remonstrated against the conduct of the Imaum to our Resident, through whose mediation a satisfactory accom modation took place between the Pacha, the Imaum, and the Shaikh of Kas-ool-Khyma. 9. The Turkish troops having proceeded against the Wahabees, a a, d. 1799. battle was on - the eve of being fought, when Abdool Azeez, the son of the Wahabee Shaikh, who commanded the Wahabee force, heard of the death of his father ; an event which threw his troops into the greatest consternation, and- drove him to the extremity of submitting to proposals of peace, which was ultimately concluded, when the Turkish army returned to Bagdad. 10. Abdool Azeez, having succeeded his father as Shaikh of the a. d. 1800. ^ ahabees, now threatened to invade Oman. Syud Sultan proceeded to Julfar (Ras-ool- Khyma), where he joined Shaikh Suggur, the Joasmee Chief, with the view of opposing the attack, which was, however, arrested by a peace concluded between the Wahabees and the Imaum. ll'. The influ ence of Abdool Azeez in the following year was a. d. 1801. established over the Uttoobee Arabs. On the . conquest of Bahrein by the Imaum, the Uttoobee Shaikhs quitted the island, and proceeded with their followers to Zo bara, and solicited the protection of the Wahabee Shaikh, who en- couraged them to settle at that place, for the purpose of employing them against Bahrein, in the recovery of which he assisted the Uttoobees in the beginning of 1802.430 WAHABEES. 12. The Wahabee troops again appeared near Oman, having com- ^ ^ 1809 pelled the wild Arabs in the vicinity to join them. They had at this period reduced to nominal sub mission the whole coast from Bussora river to Deba, which is the boun dary between the Muskat and Joasmee territories, and, if allowed to strengthen themselves in their acquisitions, they would, it was appre hended, commence the same depredations by sea as they were prose cuting on shore. A conviction of this danger had united the mercantile powers in the Gulf against the sect. 13. The measures which the Wahabee Chief was actively prosecut ing for the extension of his power and possessions, and the propagation of his doctrines, derived considerable support from the success of an expedition against Kerbelah, which he attacked on the 21st of April, pillaged the whole of it (the Mehallah or division of Abbas alone excepted), and plundered the Tomb of Hossein, slaying in the course of the day, with circumstances of peculiar cruelty, above five thousand of the inhabitants. This event, which made a deep impression on the minds of the Turks, Arabs, and Persians, was attributed to the guilty negligence of the Turkish Government, in failing to keep the Tomb of Hossein in a proper state of defence. 14. Unable to check their progress, the Imaum in 1803 acceded to a truce of three years, with the Wahabee, who had succeeded in converting, or rendering tribu tary to his power, the Arabs who inhabited the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf. 15. This truce left the Wahabee Chief at liberty to prosecute his ambitious views of aggrandisement, which were next directed to the reduction of Medina and Mecca. The latter he soon reduced, having however previously attacked and taken Taif, which he converted from a fertile region to an absolute desert. He next invested Jedda, which having reduced to great distress, the Imaum succeeded in purchasing a truce for the sum of one lakh and forty thousand dollars. On the fall of Mecca and Yamboo, the extensive adjoining country submitted to the Wahabee, who was now in possession of nearly the whole sea coast on the western frontier of Arabia. 16. Returning from his victorious career in that quarter of Arabia, Abdool Azeez prepared, notwithstanding the three years' truce he had entered into with the Imaum, for the invasion of Oman by land and sea,—a detachment of his troops had already entered the province, and advanced within two days' journey of Burka, the summer residence of the Imaum of Muskat. Captain Seton observed on this occasion, that if the Wahabee reduced Oman, all Arabia must submit to his power, and the whole coast would become a nest of pirates, who would extend a. d . 1803.WAHABEES. 431 their depredations to India ; of which there was some danger, as the Imaum had disgusted all his commanders, and stood alone. 17. The conquest-of Oman was probably arrested by the murder of the Wahabee Shaikh early in the month of November, in his capital at Deriah, whilst at his evening prayers, in a public place of worship, surrounded by his own immediate adherents, by a religious fanatic, who was immediately killed by them. 18. Saood, the son of Abdool Azeez, succeeded his father as the QrH n . head of the 'Wahabee Tribe. a. d. io04-0o. 1 J. On the death of Syud Sultan, the Imaum of Muskat, which occurred in the latter end of 1804, the influence of the Wahabees prevailed over Muskat, and we find Saood interfering between the competitors for the government, but throwing the weight of his power in the scale in favour of Beder. 20. In the month of April 1806 Saood took the field, with about a. d. 1806. thousand men. He first plundered the Dufeeh, and then the Anisa, and proceeded to Meshid Ali, on which he made an unsuccessful attack, and afterwards upon Semowka, from which he was also repulsed, with severe loss. 21. In the following month, Bussora was thrown into the greatest consternation, by the appearance of the Wahabees near Zobeer, only a few miles from the gates of the town. Fortunately the Desert was at the time overflowed to its very walls, and Saood ? s troops, being in great distress, and having a number of wounded with them, no attempt was made against the place. 22. The Persian and Turkish Governments relaxing in their efforts a. d. 1807-08. t0 c ^ ec ^ ^e rise of the Wahabee power, the Imaum of Muskat having lost the influence which Syud Sultan had established over its dependent Shaikhs, and become entirely friendless, and the British deeming it a wiser policy to observe a^ strict neutrality as far as regarded the views of that sect, its preponderance was completely established in the year 1808, in Oman. By attacking the weaker singly, and compelling them to join his standaid against their neighbours, the Wahabee gradually increased his power to a height which enabled him to overawe the greater States. The revenues of the upper part of Oman were paid to Saood, and it was only by a degrading submission that the Imaum prevented their inroads into the low country; he had appointed his own officers in the districts of the principality of Seer, and compelled the Joasmee Chief to abandon his country.432 WAHABEES. 23. It was under the influence of that ascendancy that the Joasmees 1808 09 extended their cruises to India, and in the month of April 1808 they first made their ap pearance in these seas, to the northward of Bombay. The Wahabees had long contemplated that object. Saood had established a new- power, the Zahib Tribe, in the tract of country from Musseldom to Ramse, and had greatly added to his strength by taking from the Joasmees the two strong forts of Feguera and Bithnay. Their Shaikh, Hussein bin Ali, a Joasmee, who was the Chief of Ramse also, was called to Deriah. 24. Hussein bin Ali having been conciliated to the support of the Wahabee, was appointed his vicegerent in the Seer principality, with authority to compel the heads of the Joasmees residing at Lingah and Ras-ool-Khyma to send their vessels to sea in conjunction with those from Ramse, and to cruise in the service of the Wahabee Shaikh against all vessels, without exception, appearing in the Gulf, reserving one-fifth as his share of the pirated property, the remainder being divided among the captors. This systematic plan of piracy created such a degree of fear of the power of the Wahabees among all the tribes of Arabs within the scope of it, that whatever might be their inclinations, they must either join Hussein bin Ali or expose themselves to the cruelty and vengeance of Saood. No dependence could under such circumstances be in prudence placed on the assurances of a pacific disposition given by any Arab inhabiting the shores of the Persian Gulf, for they were no longer free agents, and the exertion of power on the part of the British Government in India could alone give a full and effectual secu rity to vessels in future visiting the ports of Bushire and Bussora. 25. Nor could any dependence whatever be placed at this period in the Government of Muskat, since, however much it was against the interests of the Imaum, it was apprehended that he also would be obliged to join in the general piracy, unless the British Government relieved Muskat from the pressure of all that side of Arabia employed by the Wahabees to reduce that seaport. Agents whom the Imaum had deputed to Deriah, to claim the restitution of Shinas and other forts taken from the Vali of Sohar, were ill received by Saood, and were de tained until the Imaum ordered his vessels against Bussora, or gave proof of his attachment to the Mussulman cause by sending a predatory expedition to India, and threatening to visit Muskat in person on his return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. 26. The common danger that threatened Oman, and the oppressions of the Wahabees, led to the manifestation of a disposition in the several Shaikhs to unite in a confederacy against Saood. They anxiously looked, however, to the British Government for assistance, to enableWAHABEES. 433 them to recover the places on the sea shore near Musseldom dismem bered from Sohar, which •would reduce the defence of the country to one point, the passage across the isthmus. It was important to obtain that object before the return of Saood from Mecca; and it would give the Omanees sufficient time to unite and assemble for their general defence, encourage them to advance to meet the enemy, as they would be secured from attacks in their rear, whilst Saood's return might be de layed by a feint demonstration of an intention of attacking Bussora;— the active co-operation of the Arab States could be depended upon, and would render success certain and easy; but if the spirit of resistance which had displayed itself was allowed to be stifled by the unresisted power of the Wahabees, the trade of the two Gulfs must be annihilated, and that on the Malabar Coast, Kutch, Sind, and Guzerat exposed to constant depredations from a desperate and fanatic enemy. 27. The expedition to the Gulf, which was determined upon as well for the relief of Musk at as for the suppression of the Joasmees, was conducted with a degree of caution and of forbearance towards the Wahabee Chief which rendered its results efficacious but for a short period. Notwithstanding it,was indisputable that the Joasmee Arabs were under the control of Wahabee officers, and compelled to engage in piratical depredations, ' all operations by land were to be avoided, otherwise than might be momentarily necessary for the more effectual destruction of the pirate vessels in their harbours ; and in any case Captain Seton was to be careful to make it in due time fully known to the Wahabee, and the officers of his Government, that it was our sincere wish to continue at all times on terms of friendship with him and with the other States of Arabia (which were a-ll in subjection to the Waha bee), desiring only to provide for the security of the general commerce of the seas, and of the Gulf of Persia in particular, so long and so unjusti fiably interrupted by the Joasmees, in breach, also, of a positive treaty concluded with their chief in 1806 # ; the motives and objects of our interposition involving no views of aggrandisement on our part, but being altogether limited to the repression of maritime depredations (such as is equally condemned by the professors of every religion), and the just support of our ally the Imaum of Muskat cannot reasonably give offence to any other State or Government.' 28. Before the armament sailed from Bombay, the confederacy that a d 1809 10 WaS formin § a g a i nst ^e Wahabees was brought to some degree of maturity, for we find the Tmaum preparing an expedition on a large scale, which was to be * The chief had abandoned the country, disclaiming all countenance to a concern in the attack of the Sylph cruiser in 1809, and professing a desire to maintain the treaty in question.

Their avowed object was the attack of Khor Hassan, and the destruction of its Chief, Jillama Another of its objects was stated to be against Hussein bin Ali, the Wahabee vicegerent in the Joasmee country, the malcontent Joasmees having invited the Imaum to make the attempt, which they had engaged to support. The Uttoobees and Persians co-operated in this expedition which terminated without accomplishing anything. 29. No notice appears to have been taken by the Wahabee Shaikh of our attack on Ras-ool-Khyma. In the month of April, however information was received of his troops being in the vicinity of Muskat plundering the territories, attacking the possessions, and destroying the date plantations of the Imaum. They had taken post at Swadee Mooal, about forty miles from Burka, where they maintained an obstinate con flict with the Imaum's troops for thirteen days, and had afterwards pro ceeded to the attack of Ismaylee, in the defence of which it was acknow ledged His Highness lost two hundred of his troops. The Imaum soli cited the aid of the British Government, which was declined, with the view of not giving ground of offence to the Wahabees. 80. We have now to notice the events which led to the downfall of a d isii 19 the Wahabees, which was as rapid as their ascent, by the successful progress of the Turkish troops under Mahomed Ali Pacha. 31. After entering Jedda and Mecca without opposition, Abdoolla the son of Saood, who was the governor of the latter city, abandoned it with the whole of his troops, on the approach of the Turkish force. Mahomed Ali sent a detachment against Taif, the only place that remained in the hands of the Wahabees, whose power over that part of Arabia was thus early completely annihilated. 32. The successful progress of the Turkish troops led the Wahabee Chief to collect his adherents, and to concentrate his forces: with that view he withdrew their garrisons from Zobara, Kateef, Lahsa, Khor Hassan, and Khutter. 33. At about this period Rahmah bin Jaubir, the Shaikh of Khor Hassan, having entered into a connection with the Wahabees, took, in conjunction with that power, possession of Zobara, from the Uttoobees, who were also obliged to surrender the island of Bahrein to the same political ascendancy. Abdoolla bin Oofeysan was appointed the Wahabee Vukeel over those places, exclusive of the districts of Kateef and Khutter. The Uttoobees remained in charge of the administration of affairs, but were obliged to pay tribute to Abdoolla on account of the Wahabees. 34. The reverse of fortune which the Wahabees experienced led to overtures which were made by the chief to the different powers in theWAHABEES. 435 Gulf. He deputed an envoy (Ibrahim bin Abdoolla Kureem) to the Governor of Fars, with the view of conciliating his friendship, and to prevail on the Persian Government to postpone the march of a force it meditated against the Wahabees, which had alarmed Abdoolla bin Saood. The mission was well received; the Persian Government, in fact, did not possess the means requisite for attacking the Wahabees, as her ports on the coast were at this time more under the influence of the chief of that sect than her own. Whilst, therefore, it was politic in Persia not to disclose its own weakness, it was equally so in Saood to use every means to prevent the chance of an attack from the Persian side of the Gulf, which the reverses he had experienced rendered him very ill able to resist. 85. On Abdool Kureem's return from Shiraz, he waited on Mr. Bruce, and communicated the anxiety of his master to form a connection with the British Government of mutual amity and friendship, such as might be beneficial to both States, and that the ports of each nation might be open to each other, and a free and unmolested trade be carried on by their subjects. These overtures having been submitted to Bengal, the Supreme Government deemed it inexpedient to negotiate any treaty, or to form any intimate connection with the Wahabee Chief tain, but considered it politic to maintain a friendly intercourse with him, and to endeavour, by a cordial and conciliatory conduct, to confirm the amicable disposition which he professed to entertain towards the British Government. 36. The power of Saood was however still very considerable ; for a d 1813 14 independently of the predominance of his in fluence on the Persian side of the Gulf, the whole of the sea coast on the Arabian shore was subject to him, except the island of Bahrein, which had been recovered by the Uttoobees, and the port of Grane. To the southward, his influence extended to Cape Mus- seldom on the sea coast, and in the interior joined the Muskat territories, where, again, his power was acknowledged to the southward of Eas-ool- Gate. Kateef, his principal seaport, was twelve days' march from Deriah. 37. The Wahabee Chief was also negotiating a peace with Mus kat, but, as the Imaum wrote to Mr. Bruce, 'nothing has taken place between us, as the Agent wished the Imaum to enter into engagements which were inconsistent, nor could His Highness enter into his views as long as Ras-ool-Khyma remained the obstacle between them.' 38. Saood died on the 10th of April 1814, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Abdoolla bin Saood, who, after making the necessary arrangements incident to the death of his father, proceeded on an expedition against the Nujd Arabs, who had in a great measure thrown off the Wahabee yoke. 57 Wi| : / 436 WAHABEES. 39. Remonstrances having been made to the Chiefs of the Wahabees and of Ras-ool-Khy ma for some captures made by the Joasmees, Hussein bin Mahomed bin Gaith arrived at Bushire, as the Agent of the Joasmee Chief, Hussein bin Rahmah, and with letters from the Waha- bee Shaikh, disapproving of the conduct of the former, and of his tribe' and binding himself to compel Hussein bin Rahmah to deliver up such propeity as we could prove they had captured. 40. Ibrahim Pacha, prosecuting the advantages'he had obtained a. d . 1818. OVer the Wahabees, again defeated them at Manwiah, seven stages from the capital of Denah. Abdoolla bin Saood retreated to Bundah, in the district of Kassime, four stages from Deriah. Following up this success, Ibrahim Pacha invested and reduced the Wahabee capital on the 10th of Sep tember, destroyed the fortifications, towers, and plantations of date trees, and removed the inhabitants to Lahsa, which he intended to establish as the seat of government. 41. Abdoolla bin Saood was made a prisoner on this occasion, and sent off, with live others, under an escort, to be delivered over to the 'viceroy, Mahomed Ali Pacha. The Wahabee Shaikh's family were to be sent to Medina, until the orders of the Porte should be received. Kateef, the principal seaport belonging to the Wahabees, next surren dered to the Turkish troops, and Ibrahim Pacha's army having been recruited by considerable reinforcements from Egypt, he detached a foice against Beriami, bordering on the province of Oman, which was foimerly subject to the Turkish Government; and was preparing to attack Ras-ooi-Khyma and the pirate ports, Abdoolla bin Ahmed, the Shaikh of Bahrein, offering whatever vessels might be requisite for the transport of troops against those places. 42. Thus rose and fell—it is to be hoped never to rise again—the extraordinary sect of the Wahabees, under whose protection and en couragement maritime depredations were carried on in the Gulf, and in the Indian seas, with a degree of success, audacity, and barbarity, which has been surpassed only by the atrocities of the Algerines in Europe.WAHABEES. 437 CONTINUATION OF THE FOREGOING, FROM 1820 TO 1831, BY LIEUTENANT S. HENNELL. Mr. Warden's^ account of this once powerful sect concludes by describing their'complete overthrow in 1818, when Ibrahim Pacha captured their capital, Deriah, by a general storm, and sent away their chief as a prisoner to Egypt, Nothing further appears to have been heard regarding the-Wahabees til] 1820, when a report was made to the Go vernment that one of their chiefs, who had been taken prisoner in 1818, had effected his escape into the Desert, and, collecting a considerable a. d. 1820. number of Arabs together, had taken possession of the State of Deriah. In consequence, the Chiefs of the Beni Khalid, who had been established by Ibrahim Pacha in Lahsa and Kateef, marched against him with a large force, and compelled him to surrender himself and followers. In 1822 Mahomed Ali Pacha stationed a body of 700 horse, under a. d. 1822. 0ne of llis officers! ' in th e fort of Arrizah, and at the same time directed them to rebuild the fort and works of Deriah, for the purpose of being garrisoned by a Turkish force. Shortly afterwards 100 Turkish cavalry, stationed at Riaz, were suiprised and cut up by the Bedouins in the neighbourhoods The Wahabees appear to have remained quiet until the beginning a. d . 1824. 0f ,' he year 1824, when a large body of men was collected under the command of Shaikh Toorkey bin Abdoolla oos Saood, who proceeded against the Turkish provinces to the westward, but was foiled in his attempt by Ahmed Pacha, the Governor of Mecca, and forced to retreat, with considerable loss. Nothing daunted by this repulse, the Wahabees soon after made anothec attempt, in which they were successful. From this period, the power and resources of this sect appear to have giadually advanced, and shortly after, their Chief, Toorkey bin Abdoolla, commonly known by the name of Toorkey bin Saood, opened a corre' spondence with all the Shaikhs on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf, inviting them to renew the relations which had subsisted between them prior to the overthrow of the Wahabees by Ibrahim Pacha. On the occasion of an interview, about the end of 1825, with the British Resident in the Gulf of Persia, Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur made a dexterous attempt to ascertain the light in which his connection with the now rising sect would be viewed by the British Government, particularly with reference to the injury which might arise to the-438 WAHABEES. Imanm from his so doing. (The policy which the British Government determined to observe towards the Wahabees is detailed at greater length under the head of u Joasmees,' 1825.) From 1824 to 1830 the proceedings of this sect appear to have been a. d. 1824 to 1830. confined ^ carrying on hostilities against the Beni Khalid family, under Shaikh Mahomed and Shaikh Majid, of the A1 Arrasen Tribe. The capital of the dominions of these chiefs was called Lahsa, and they also possessed the seaport of Kateef, upon the mainland, opposite to Bahrein. In this warfare neither party gained any decisive advantage until the beginning of 1830, when the Beni Khalid Shaikh advanced with a large army into Nujd. Upon receiving intelligence of this movement, Fysul, the son of Toorkey bin Saood, the Wahabee Chief, marched with a considerable force from Eiaz to meet them. Unfortunately for the cause of the Beni Khalid, Shaikh Majid, the only leader of any talent they possessed, was sud denly taken ill, and died shortly afterwards. Shaikh Mahomed, the remaining brother, conscious, apparently, of his own incapacity to command in the field, readily gave his consent to the nomination of his nephew, Bargheshee, as the successor of the deceased chief. The new leader did not immediately commence operations, but after a short time advanced in such a manner as to compel the Wahabee army to fall back. Encouraged by his first attempt, he followed them closely, but, unfortunately, leit his original post (a place called Duberah, from whence he drew his supplies of water) unprotected. This improvidence being reported to Shaikh Toorkey bin Saood, he left Riaz on the night of the 23rd March 1830, with a force consisting of 1,200 horse and foot, and keeping to the left, he succeeded in turning the flank of the enemy, and getting possession of Duberah, thus cutting off the Beni Khalid from their water, and placing them between his son's army and his own. In this situation they remained for one day, but the next morning a simultaneous attack being made upon them, both in front and rear, by the two Wahabee Chiefs, they were entirely defeated, and the rout was so complete that the whole of the horses, camels, and cattle of the Beni Khalid Shaikhs, together with all the tents, baggage, women, and children fell into the hands of the victors. It was currently reported and believed at that time that 100,000 camels, and nearly a million head of cattle, were among the fruits of this victory. Shaikh Mahomed fled with a few horsemen to Lahsa, where he was soon afterwards joined by Bargheshee. The success of the Wahabee Chief was however so de cisive that the greater portion of the Bedouins of the Beni Khalid Tribe made their peace with the victor by a timely submission. Shortly afterwards. Shaikh Toorkey moved upon Lahsa, which fell into his hands without resistance, and a party having been sent on to Kateef, that place immediately surrendered. Having thus succeeded in expel-WAHABEES. 439 ling the Beni Khalid Shaikhs from their hereditary dominions, the Av ahabee Shaikh set about consolidating his new conquests, and, by friendly letters and presents, endeavoured to conciliate the good will of all the chiefs of any consequence in his neighbourhood. The report of his success was received with much joy by the greater portion of the Joasmees, who anticipated a renewal of their former profitable practices of piracy through the restoration of the Wahabee ascendancy. The chief of that sect, however, was much more enlightened than his predecessors, and his proceedings were evidently dictated by rules of policy, instead of being guided by the burning zeal for the propagation of the Wahabee faith which had characterised all former leaders. So far from interfering in the religious observances of the individuals a. d. 1831, residing in the places lately fallen into his power, he issued a proclamation, intimating that pilgrims, whether Soonees or Sheeas, were at liberty to proceed through Nujd to Mecca and Medina, and that he himself would guarantee their safety. The only article of the former strict tenets of the Waha- bees, the observance of which he thought proper to insist upon, was that tobacco should not be smoked openly in the streets. It is likewise related, that when urged by Shaikh Rashid of Ejman to give him permission to cruise against all the enemies of the Wahabee faith, he peremptorily refused, saying that it was for authorising such proceedings that his father had been visited by the indignation of Heaven, and that at all events the English being masters of the sea, he was not able to contend with such a powerful nation. Shaikh Toorkey, in making the rapid progress above detailed, gave out that he acted as a free and independent chieftain ; but this was not really the case as he still continued to pay a small annual tribute to Mahomed Ali' Pacha of Egypt, and took measures to represent his proceedings to that ruler in so favourable a light as to obtain his approval to them After placing garrisons in all the towers and strongholds he had taken Shaikh Toorkey returned to his capital, Deriah, and, with the excep tion of some feeble and unsuccessful demonstrations that were made by Mahomed bin Arrareer, the surviving Chief of the Beni Khalid Tribe, remained in quiet possession of his new conquest, which he governed with great prudence and justice, taking from them only the Zukat or tithes, and by his vigorous measures putting a complete stop lo the system of robbery and plunder, as well as the internal dis putes of the different tribes, which had characterised the rule of the Beni Khalid Shaikhs. The acquisition of Lahsa and Kateef appears to have produced a greater effect than Shaikh Toorkey could have ventured to antici pate, for His Highness the Imaum, desirous of obtaining the aid of so powerful an ally in the promotion of his schemes upon Bahrein, sent offi •;&lt;' I 1 n fcl* I : l j I 440 WAHABEES. messengers to Riaz, with large presents, and not only acknowledged the supremacy of the Nujd Chief, but is said likewise to have inti mated his readiness to pay the Zukat. The Wahabee Shaikh, how- ever, appears to have availed himself of the desire of His Highness to obtain the island of Bahrein, for the advancement of his own views, as he forthwith laid before Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed the alternative of war or submission ; the latter was preferred, and agreeably to an arrangement concluded at Riaz by a relation of the Uttoobee Shaikh, that chief was to be taken under the protection of Toorkey bin Saood, on acknowledging his supremacy, and paying an annual tribute. Thus the whole of the Arabian Coast, from Ras-ool- Hud to Grane, with the exception of Aboothabee (the capital of Shaikh Tahnoon bin Shakboot), became tributary to the Wahabees. About the middle of the year 1831, a communication was made to the Governor of Bombay by the Wahabee Chief, through Shaikh Rashid bin Humeed of Ejman, expressive of his desire to be upon the same inti mate footing as that formerly existing between the British Government and his ancestor Saood. To this a reply in general but friendly terms was transmitted, through the Resident in the Persian Gulf. At the present time (December 1831) reports are very current that serious disturbances have broken out in Nujd, owing to the intrigues of a relative of the AVahabee Chief, named Musharee, who, having joined the Kahtan and other tribes in the interior, which have hitherto refused to acknowledge the supremacy of Shaikh Toorkey, is now said to be preparing to commence hostilities. The Beni Khalid and Amayir* Tribes, in consequence of these rumours, were encouraged to make a simultaneous attack upon Kateef and Lahsa, but have been repulsed, and compelled to retreat, and will probably soon be visited by the indignation of the power they have so imprudently provoked. FURTHER CONTINUATION OF THE PRECEDING, FROM 1832 TO 1844, BY LIEUTENANT A. B. KEMBALL. The members of this powerful tribe, or collection of tribes, following the Wahabee tenets, were in the latter end of 1831, as mentioned in Captain Hennell's Sketches, divided amongst themselves, owing to the intrigues of one Musharee, a relative of their lawful head, Toorkey bin A small tribe, under Shaikh Durhash, dependent upon the Beni Khalid, occupying an island between Kateef and Grane.WAHABEES. 441 Saood, who, having joined the Kahtan, and other tribes in the interior had with them refused to acknowledge his supremacy, and was prepar ing to establish his position by force of arms. The Beni Khalid and Amayir Tribes, in consequence of these rumours, had been encouraged to attack Kateef and Lahsa, but had met with a repulse. Hostilities continued to be prosecuted, and early in 1832 the Amayir* seized a boat belonging to Bahrein, lying off Kateef, laden with dates for the latter place. Of thirty Kateef people on board, they killed twelve, and took the remainder prisoners, with a view to their ransom. After plundering the boat of all property belonging to Kateef t ley permitted it to depart, without offering molestation to the Bahrein men either in person or property. The affairs of Nujd about this time, owing to internal dissensions, a. d . 1833. became in a most unsettled state, and the power . . Toorkey bin Saood, the Wahabee, threatened so rapidly to decline, that the Governor of Kateef sought the protection of the Chief of Bahrein, and offered to transfer his allegiance ; but this temporary diminution of his authority, occasioned by the opposition of is relative and competitor, Musliaree, who claimed a prior right bv descent, and stated himself to have escaped from confinement in Egypt qmc dy gave way to the superior energy of his character. The Zukat or tribute of five per cent, began to be exacted, and his in- uence to be completely established over the inhabitants of the coast • but, unlike his predecessors, he opposed himself to the wishes of the Joasmees, and other lawless tribes, desirous of his sanction for the re- newal of piracy, which they supposed would have ensued on the revival of his power ; whereas they found, that instead of reaping the profits of old times, arising from plunder. Shaikh Toorkey was inclined to take liom them a portion even of the little they had. The measures adopted in urging the demands against the Joasmees, now virtually Wahabee dependents, for the restitution of the property (or its value) plundered from a vessel belonging to a British subieet, by some men of Khan (three of whom had taken refuge at Aboothabee), * This W k was described to eonsist of about families, separated into tbe two divisions of Bedomns and flsbennen.

As the former wrote without any authority, no direct notice was taken of his communication ; but the latter was instructed, in reply, to explain, that previous to the adoption of coercive measures, a whole year had been consumed in negotiation, without success, and no interference volunteered on his part for the promotion of the ends of justice; and, further, to use other arguments, importing the evident existence of our right to demand redress. Abdool Azeez returned for answer that Toorkey bin Saood was now the only authority on the continent of Arabia, and that both citizens and Bedouins, maritime as well as inland tribes, having all acknowledged his supremacy, he was in fact the ruler of the country, including Haajar, Oman, and the coast from Jaalan to Kateef, and that therefore, on the occurrence of any piracy, it should be reported to the Wahabee Chief, or, in the event of his being at too great a distance, to his Agent at Brymee. The blockade of Kateef and Ajeer by the Bahrein party caused the greatest annoyance and distress to the people of those places under the authority and protection of the Wahabee Chief, who now called in the assistance of the Joasmees of Ras-ool-Khyma and Lingah. His violent death, however, at this time, by the hand of his nephew, Musharee, led to the suspension of offensive operations, and introduced into the affairs of the Wahabee Tribe such confusion and discord as to counteract the operation of any ambitious views of late entertained by the murdered chief, and for a time at least to leave the maritime tribes in the same relative position as heretofore. There was every reason for supposing that this violent and daring act had been instigated by Abdoolla bin Ahmed, who had kept up a correspondence with the murderer, and who received the news of the death of the Wahabee Chief with the firing of guns, and other demonstrations of joy. Musharee was not permitted long to survive his victim, whose son, Fysul, immediately quitting Kateef and its neighbourhood, which he had been defending against the attacks of the Bahrein forces, marched against him, and laid siege to the fort of Koot, in which he had taken refuge. Treachery on the part of the adherents soon placed Fysul in possession of the fort, when he avenged the murder of his father by putting Musharee, with twenty others, to the sword. About the middle of the year 1835 arrived at Muskat, from Mecca, a person by name Abdoolla bin Musharee, at one time a very respectable merchant of Bahrein, bearing letters from Ahmed Pacha to the Imaufn of Muskat, Abdoolla bin Ahmed the Uttoobee Chief, and Fysul bin Toorkey the WahabeeWAHABEES. 443 ruler, intimating to them that he had been pleased to give him the grant of Kateef at a stated revenue, from twenty to twenty-four thousand dollars, and directing that he might be permitted to take possession of and keep the territory committed to his charge, without molestation. By the Imaum he was received and treated with much courtesy, and furnished with a Bateel and provisions to convey him to Kateef, and letters to Fysul bin Toorkey and Abdoolla bin Ahmed, represented to be of a conciliatory and peaceful tenor. On hearing of the arrival of this personage at Kateef, and the receipt of the several letters of which he was the bearer. Ameer Fysul imme diately marched a body of troops into that place, in order to support the asseition of his superior right over, and determination to keep it, as well as the surrounding district, now so unceremoniously farmed away bv the Pacha of Mecca. Abdoolla bm Musharee did not await the arrival of the Wahabee troops, who took possession of Kateef, and subsequently attempted, but without success, to capture Tirhoot, the place already mentioned as having fallen into the hands of the Uttoobees during the confusion which ensued on the violent death of the late Wahabee Chief, and while his son, the present chief, was engaged in establishing his right to succeed to' his authority, against the pretensions of his father's murderer, Musharee. The mission of Bin Musharee was supposed (and the subsequent arrival of his sons with letters of recommendation, procured from the Government of Bombay, and the correspondence he was keeping up with the Imaum, and the Pacha of Mecca, appeared to identify him with the late events) to have been not unconnected with the design of Ahmed Pacha to engage the Wahabee Chief in operations towards the north-east, whilst he was prosecuting his conquest in the south-west quarter of the Arabian peninsula, and with the wish of the Imaum to see his ancient enemy. Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed of Bahrein, enga-ed in renewed hostilities with so powerful an opponent as the Chief of'the Wahabees, whose attention he was also interested in drawing in a direction opposite to his own territories. The,preponderating influence of Mahomed Ali Pacha on the western a. d. 1836. Side of the Ar abian Peninsula began now to affoi ' d a salutary check upon the encroachments ot the Wahabee sect towards the coast of the Persian Gulf. He sum moned Shaikh Fysul to meet Ibrahim or Hussein Pacha, and afford his co-operation against the Aseer tribe, who had hitherto successfully frustrated their attempts to reduce it to subjection ; but this chief declining compliance, on the plea of sickness, sent his brother with some horses, &amp;c. as a present, and to apologise for him. It was report ed that a very large Egyptian force was at this time collected at Medina.it: a a i H fi ■ t 1 ■f ; • f i 444 WAHABEES. The Wahabee Agent at Brymee, at the suggestion of his master endeavoured, but without success, to secure the maritime assistance of His Highness the Imaum of Muskat and the coast tribes against Bahrein, the former replying, to the requisition for the use of his ships of war, that he was not at liberty to employ his vessels on such enter prises without the previous knowledge and sanction of the English Government. Circumstances, however, shortly after inducing the Bahrein Chief to make overtures of peace and submission, and the proffer of a small annual tribute, Ameer Fysul, mindful of the encroach ments of the Egyptians on the western, was fain to receive them, and thus creditably rid himself of an active and indefatigable enemy on the eastern side of the Arabian peninsula. It soon became evident that the fears entertained by him, in conse quence of the proceedings of the Egyptian ruler, were not destitute of foundation. The object of the latter, to establish a ruler in Nujd more compliant 100 _ to his views, and more devoted to his interests, a. d. 183/. . , , _ „ ' by whose means would be easily effected the subjection of the Bedouins to the south-west, to whom, on the contrary, the present ruler was supposed to have granted aid in their hitherto successful resistance to the progress of the Egyptian arms, was indicat ed in the open support he now afforded, in the shape of a body of troops, to the pretender Khalid bin Saood,* who early in this year set up pretensions to the chief authority over Nujd, and was preparing to establish them by the sword. Ameer Fysul lost no time in making every exertion to meet this new and serious contingency, which he further endeavoured, but now too late, to avert, by despatching messengers with most submissive letters to Mahomed Ali Pacha, with a view to induce him to withdraw his support and assistance from Shaikh Khalid. This pretender successively captured Gusseem and Deriah ; and at length, meeting the forces of his rival near Riaz, defeated them in the open field. Fysul, compelled to retreat, fell back upon Riaz, but found the fort already in the hands of some of the adherents of the victorious usurper. Thus the province of Nujd fell virtually into the hands of Ameer Khalid, for Lahsa and Kateef only awaited his approach in force to tender their submission. Little doubt could be entertained that he was a mere puppet in the hands of the Egyptians, who were of course to reap the benefits of his success, obtained through their assistance. These auxiliaries, or rather principals in disguise, consisted only of from 1,000 to 1,500 horse and Saood was great-grandfather to both Fysul and Khalid.WAHABEES. 445 500 loot, with 12 guns and 4 mortars ; but such was the terror inspired by the Pacha's name, that nothing like determined resistance appears to have been offered, although Fysul stood generally high with the Bedouins of Nnjd. This effectual subversion of the authority of Fysul, and approach of the Egyptians, created great alarm in the mind of the Uttoobee Chief, who had apparently just grounds for supposing that their ulterior objects were not, as at first conjectured, directed towards any part of the Turkish territories, but to the conquest of Bahrein, in which their aid and co-operation had been secured, it was reported, by the Imaum, in a secret agreement, whereby it was stipulated that he should be main tained in possession of the island, and of the districts of Lahsa and Kateef, and in return pay an annual tribute of 300,000 crowns. Korshid Pacha now arrived with a reinforcement of regular troops, a. d . 1838. and commenced his march upon Hiaz, Lahsa, and Kateef. He used every means to conciliate the Arab Tribes, and despatched emissaries to Bahrein for the purpose of procuring grain, provisions, and necessaries for his force, against its arrival. An attempt at treachery, on the other hand, amongst the Amayii Tribe at Lahsa, having been discovered, it was severely dealt with by Ameer bin Oofeysan, Ameer Fysul's General, who put to death three of their chief people. Ameer Fysul was shortly after compelled to fly to Dillum, which was immediately besieged by three bodies of troops, under the respective commandants of Ameer Khalid, Korshid Pacha, and the Shaikh of the Moojariba Arabs, and, being very hardly pressed, to deliver himself up. Lahsa and Kateef thereon surrendered, and the Wahabee General Omer bin Oofeysan, took refuge in Bahrein. Fysul^ was sent a prisoner to Egypt in December 1838, and his sue- cessor Khalid, the Egyptian tool, called upon the Uttoobees to resume the payment of the annual tribute which had formerly been exacted by Toorkey. The Egyptian General now threw off his disguise as the auxiliary of Khalid, openly declared Nujd a possession of his master and avowed his intention to improve and extend his conquests. On the defeat and surrender of Ameer Fysul, Korshid Pacha, with the whole of the regulars and artillery, which, including the irregular Mughnbee and horsemen, amounted to about 3,000, fixed his head quarters at Sulimeah (distant from two hundred to two hundred and fifty miles from the coast), garrisoned Lahsa with 300 irregulars as ikn Kateef, Sohat, and Ajeer, and only awaited the arrival of rdnforce! ments to carry into effect his meditated attack'upon Bahrein. With this view, he expected the co-operation of four armed vessels from the Red Sea, with a supply of arms and ammunition. Emissaries wereI I II I I II I I i m 446 WA.HABEES. despatched to Koweit, Mohumrah, and other places, for the purpose of collecting grain and provisions. Strong remonstrances, however, with His Highness Mahomed Ali Pacha, from the British Ministry at home, as well as those of the British authority in the Gulf with Korshid Pacha, had the effect of inducing the Egyptian Government to postpone, and eventually actual- ly abandon, the fulfilment of its plans of aggrandisement. Syud bin Mootluk, who during the lifetime of Ameer Toorkey re- a. d. 1839. Sided at Br y raee ' as his Naib or deputy, and who possessed great personal influence among the Arabian Tribes, as also a perfect knowledge of their various and conflicting interests, having been removed by Fysul bin Toorkey, the now deposed Wahabee Chief, joined the Egyptian commander, and was by him despatched to Ras-ool-Khyma, to persuade the chiefs on the Coast of Oman to acknowledge the authority of Mahomed Ali in reality, but ostensibly that of his tool Khalid, the now nominal head of the Waha- bee sect. This individual contrived, by a mixture of threats and promises, to persuade the Joasmee Chief to unite with him in requiring the Beni Naeem, who had lately got possession of Brymee, to surrender it to the Nujdees; but these nobly replied that they would rather bury them selves in its ruins than give it up, and lost no time in applying to the Beniyas Chief, as also Syud Humood bin Asan of Sohar, for support to meet the common enemy. This call was immediately responded to by the latter, who instantly sent his brother Ghes, with two hundred men, to reinforce the garrison of Brymee, The perseverance and resolution displayed by the Agents of Maho med Ali Pacha in forwarding his schemes of conquest, and the constant success which had hitherto attended the progress of his General, began to exercise a powerful influence over the tribes in this quarter,—an in fluence which nothing less than a positive assurance of protection from the British Government against his further encroachments could suffice to counteract. A protest in form was therefore entered by the British authorities, against the agreement between the Bahrein Shaikh and the Agent, as having been formed in direct opposition to the assurances given by His Highness Mahomed Ali to Her Britannic Majesty's Government, and the several Maritime Chieftains of Oman were invited to certify in writing their determination to cultivate more sedulously their relations with the British Government, to abide by its wishes and instructions, and to resist to the last extremity all attempts of Korshid Pacha to subjugate them. Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur was called to account for his extraordinary and vacillating conduct with reference to Syud bin Mootluk. He in icply urged that hq had been earnest in his promises, but that hisWAHABEES. 447 arrangements had been thwarted and overturned by the treacherous conduct of the Beniyas Chief, who had entered into a close and intimate correspondence with the Egyptian Agent, and had offered him an asylum in his fort in case of his expulsion from Shargah ; in corroboration of which statement he produced a letter from Shaikh Khaleefa to the address of that individual, alluding to the little assistance afforded him by the Joasmees during the four months he had resided on their coasts, and pledging himself to support him with the whole of the resources of the Beniyas, whether by land or by sea, whenever called upon. He was informed that Shaikh Khaleefa had subsequently pledged himself in writing to drop all further connection with Korshid Pacha or his agents, and that therefore his objections were removed. Upon this he requested to be furnished with a document, requiring him to demand the imme diate departure of Syud bin Mootluk, which was accordingly supplied; and it was at the same time intimated to the Egyptian Agent, that HumoOd bin Suroorand Mahomed bin Abdoolla, the Chiefs of Naeemin Brymee, having with their tribes been taken under the protection of the British Government, he would consequently be held responsible for any injury he might inflict upon them. He was moreover called upon, under the assurances of His Highness Mahomed Ali Pacha, to quit the Arabian Coast, and return to his immediate superior, Korshid Pacha. Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur further agreed to enter into no correspond ence or engagements with Mahomed Ali or his dependents, or any foreign power, without the knowledge and permission of the British Government, and to consider its enemies as his enemies : he was, in return, to be furnished with warlike munitions in the event of his being attacked from any quarter, on consideration of his compliance with the wishes of the British Government. The application of the Beni Naeem Shaikhs to be placed under British protection was favourably received. They were encouraged to stand firm in their resolve to maintain their independence ; and it was determined to send an Agent to reside at Brymee, and to furnish them with ammunition, if necessary. The local Government of Muskat was also called upon to unite in the views and policy of the British Government, and to afford every aid and support to the inhabitants of Brymee. To keep up or recover the semblance of the character under which the Egyptians first entered Nujd, and as a blind to their designs of further aggrandisement, Ameer Khalid was invested with a dress of honour, and proclaimed ruler of the province of Nujd. Syud bin Mootluk, on receiving the Resident's protest, and hearing of the measures which had been adopted by him with reference to the448 WAHABEES. inhabitants of the coast and of Brymee, at length evacuated Oman and, embarking from Shargah, proceeded to Ajeer, having been pre viously personally assured by Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur that if he returned to Oman in force he would join him, and place all his resources at his disposal. His removal from Oman proved a severe blow to the Egyptian influence, and broke up the combination rapidly forming in his favour. On his voyage from Shargah, having landed on the island of Kenn, on the Persian Coast, he forcibly carried off four hundred sheep, and other property,—a gross and wanton aggression upon the subjects of a friendly power, which was duly brought to the notice of Mahomed Ali Pacha, and led, among other causes, to its being subsequently intimated to the Shaikh of Kateef, the Egypto- Aft ahabee seaport, that any expedition against Oman or the territories of the Imaum would be opposed by the British squadron in the Gulf. A portion of the Naeem Tribe (a branch of that which had so openly resisted the encroachment of Korshid Pacha and his Agents at Brymee), residing on the Guttur Coast, having refused to pay the Zukat or tribute, when called upon through Abdoolla bin Ahmed, the Chief of Bahrein, Mahomed Effendi, the Egyptian Governor of Lahsa, des patched a party of regulars, assisted by some of the Mookazeebah Arabs, to ravage their pasture lands and date groves. Before this foray could be effectually made, the expedition was compelled to retreat, in consequence ol the murder of Mahomed Effendi, its originator, by some Arabs, in the suburbs of Lahsa. A Gooncha (belonging to Koweit) reached Kateef from I^deida, in the Red Sea, in ^November 1839, laden with ammunition and military stores for the use of the Egyptian forces in Nujd. The Agents on board did not fail to spread all sorts of extravagant reports regarding a fleet of some eighteen or twenty vessels, laden with troops and warlike stores, being about to follow. The remonstrances of the Home Government began now, however, to a. d. 1840 have full effect; moreover, the quarrels and dis sensions amongst the Egyptian Agents them selves, and the jealousy lately imbibed by Mahomed Ali Pacha of his Gcneial, Korshid, tended very much to weaken their power and influ ence, which were threatened by, among other disaffected tribes, that of Ljman, numbering upwards of four thousand men, whose chief had lately succeeded in effecting his escape from Lahsa, where he had been tieacherously seized and confined by the Pacha's orders. Communica tions between the different towns and districts began to be seriously interrupted, and the supplies for the Egyptian forces at Thurmidah, the ead quarters, needed escorts of considerable numbers of horse and to ensure their safety. Syud bin Mootluk was distrusted, and sentWAHABEES. 449 under surveillance to Riaz, A movement by Khalid into the districts, attended by the Egyptian cavalry, for the purpose of confirming his authority, and receiving the allegiance of the various unsettled tribes, indicated an intention on the part of his allies to evacuate Nnjd, and their desire, by putting him forward in a more prominent position of outward authority than he had hitherto enjoyed, to check the growing disaffections previous to his being left at the head of affairs. Just as the blockade of Kateef, Sohat, and Ajeer, held by the Egyp tian troops, began seriously to be contemplated by the British Govern ment, intelligence was received (May 1840) that Lahsa had been evacuated, and that the main body of the Egyptian troops had actually left Nujd; which being corroborated by the declaration shortly before made by Mahomed Ali Pacha, the Egyptian ruler, to Her Majesty's Consul General at Cairo, and subsequently in a measure confirmed by the despatch of a vessel to those ports, which were now found to be in the hands of Arabs, adherents of Ameer Khalid, although the Egyptian Agent still continued to exercise the actual authority and control, rendered the adoption of this measure unnecessary. The grossly oppressive and extortionate conduct of the Pacha and his Agent further afforded a plausible reason for the belief that the Egyptians no longer contem plated the permanent occupation of Central Arabia, As a sacrifice to the memory of his deputy, Mahomed Effendi, who was shot while Governor of Lahsa, Korshid Pacha's last act, previous to his departure, was to put to death Burgeish, the Chief of the Ali Humeed. It was evidently intended, that on Nujd being made over to the charge of Ameer Khalid, that chief should nevertheless continue to act under the authority of the Egyptian Agent whom it was intended to establish at Medina, a post whence he could exercise a general super intendence over the country of the Hujeeb Arabs and Central Arabia ; but the moral influence of the usurper among the various tribes, which under the most favourable circumstances had ever been very trifling, was now entirely lost: despised, disliked, and deprived of the support of his patrons, he had very shortly his hands fully occupied with the intrigues which were set on foot to dispossess him of his illegal power. At the period of the evacuation of Lahsa and Ajeer, one Mooshrif arrived at Bahrein,^ despatched probably by the inhabitants of those places, to invite Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa (the grandson of Soley- man, the brother of Abdoolla bin Ahmed) to come over and claim those districts, when they would throw off their allegiance to Ameer Khalid. The spirit of disaffection now developing itself in Central Arabia was a. d. 1841. in no slight degree promoted and encouraged by the current report of Ameer Fysul having effect- yed his liberation from Cairo, and commenced his journey to Medina,■ ■■■ 450 WAHABEES. / f: as well as by the news of the reverse sustained by the Egyptians in Syria, and the consequent reduction of Mahomed All Pacha's authority within its legitimate limits, Syud bin Mootluk nevertheless continued to address letters to the Chief of Oman, announcing his march into that province; but these intimations (the excitement they at first caused having worn off from their having been so often made, and having as often proved without foundation) produced little effect. There was indeed little probability, under existing circumstances, of Ameer Khalid actually making any attempt on the province of Omanr it was however decided by the British Government, that in the event of the expedition being undertaken, it should be met with as much active resistance as his means afforded of arraying against it. It now appeared that the Sublime Porte advanced their claims to authority over Nujd ; and certain it is, that having received some presents from Ameer Khalid, that Government appointed him Wulee of that province. His submission was of course hollow enough, having been in all probability prompted by Korshid Pacha, to be disavowed whenever it might meet the views of the Egyptians. He addressed a very friendly letter to the British Native Agent at Bahrein, expressing an earnest desire to renew the amicable and cordial relations which formerly subsisted between his late father, Saood, and the British Government; hinting that he had wished before to open the correspondence, but had been prevented by Mahomed Ali Pacha. On his arrival at Lahsa, in October 1841, notwithstanding these professions, he prepared a force, destined (as announced by the Native Agent at Bahrein) for the invasion of Oman, and the siege of Brymee, and to be commanded by the notorious Syud bin Mootluk. The British Government having provided for this contingency in its instructions that the Resident should endeavour to obtain accurate information of Ameer Khalid's movements, and, if he were preparing for the invasion of Oman, should warn him of the opposition of the British Government, and re quire him to desist from the undertaking, and good grounds existing for the belief that the expedition was now really in contemplation, it was deemed expedient and advisable by him to despatch a British officer to wait upon the Ameer in his camp at Lahsa (distant seventy miles from the coast), with written and verbal communications, indicative of the views of the British Government: to which he replied that he had not sent, nor entertained any intention of sending, Syud bin Mootluk into ^4 Oman ; and supposing him to have been so disposed, it subsequently^/ turned out that he really had not the power; and this was the more yWAHABEE3. 451 fortunate, as the Maritime Arabian Chiefs, although outwardly profess ing their determination to maintain their own independence, were known to be secretly carrying on intrigues and correspondence with him, and as the irregular proceedings of the Brymee Chiefs, in foraying the districts of Syud Humood bin Azan of Sohar, must have greatly diminished, if not altogether destroyed, the prospect of any co-operation on the part of the latter in the event of an attack upon Nujd. A very short time sufficed to show how little able was the titular chief, when deprived of the support of his Egyptian allies, to maintain even his own position. Abdoolla bin Sooneyan, the son of Mahomed, the younger brother of Saood, father of Khalid, entertaining pretensions to the sovereignty of Nujd, and finding himself suspected by Khalid, had fled to Koweit, where he remained some time, secretly supported by Toorkey Heezanee, a Chief of Khurij. He returned in September of this year, and took possession of Zoomah, where, under certain pretences, he seized and executed an inhabitant named Zaghur, confiscating his property, to the amount of 8,000 dollars. He then took successively Syah and Mun- foohad (one or two marches from iliaz), in which latter place, by the execution of a wealthy inhabitant, he secured his property, amounting to 4,000 dollars. With these means at his disposal, he satisfied the immediate wants of his followers, said to consist of one thousand men • besides which the tribes of Graymigah, Soohool, and Toorkey Ahranee,' well disposed towards him. could furnish fifteen hundred more' Three other tribes, the Ali Moorah, Ejman, and Soobaya, numbering about three thousand men, although said to have openly promised their support to his opponent, would, it was supposed, either remain neutral in the approaching conflict, or side with Abdoolla. In December 1841 he threatened Riaz, the major part of who^e inhabitants were said to be in his favour. Khalid was represented as having in his service about eight hundred Egyptian troops, one half cavalry the other infantry, mostly irregular, indifferently armed and mounted, and somewhat discontented, in consequence of not receivino- their arrears of pay, now due for a whole year. These were looked on with much jeabusy and disfavour by the Arab Chieftains, who, when Khalid was left m authority over Nujd, had expressed their dislike to tie strangers, and stipulated for their dismissal, in return for their own friendship and support,— a measure to which he at the time acceded but its execution he had been led to defer, in consequence of the revolt of Abdoolla bin Sooneyan. In addition to the Egyptian troops ie could too, it was reported, depend on the assistance of three thousand men from the Anisa, Muhtari, and Beni Hajir tribes. There was no 1 Cr ^ 011 cltllcr slde J unless a few honey-combed and badly mounted452 WAHABEES. guns, in the possession of Ameer Khalid at Hoofoof, Kateef, &amp;c, deserved the name. On Abdoolla's approach to Riaz, the army of Ameer Khalid advanc ed to oppose him: a skirmish ensued, and the former sustained a defeat; but on the same day, the leading inhabitants of the city secretly invited him to repair with his adherents to the south gate at dnsk, when they would be prepared to act in concert with him. Abdoolla accepted the invitation, and effecting an entrance within the walls, was pro claimed ruler of Nujd. His first act was to put to death three of the leaders of the opposing army,—sparing, however, the life of Omer bin Oofeysan, a resolute man, and one on whom entire dependence had been placed by Ameer Khalid. On its becoming known at Lahsa that Riaz had fallen info the hands of Abdoolla bin Sooneyan, its inhabitants secretly wrote to him, tender ing submission, while Ameer Khalid, doubting their loyalty, assembled the head men, and a second time pledged himself to disband his merce nary troops. He nevertheless despatched to them orders to repair to him in haste and secrecy at Kateef. His stay, however, at this latter place, was not of very long duration : the inhabitants conspired with his own traitorous generals against him, and he was compelled, after dismissing his western or Egyptian troops, to take refuge with Moo- baruk (son of the Bahrein Chief, Abdoolla bin Ahmed), the Governor of Demaum, who came out to meet and offer him asylum. His hopes in this quarter of recovering power were now entirely des troyed, and he shortly left Bahrein for Koweit, with the design of pro ceeding thence to Gusseem, a town three days' journey from Medina, where he believed himself to possess some staunch adherents. Moobaruk bin Abdoolla made a diversion in favour of his guest upon Lahsa and Ajeer, but his success was only partial and temporary, his troops being compelled to retreat on the approach of those of Abdoolla bin Sooneyan. Abdoolla bin Sooneyan, in February 1842 fully acknowledged 1842 Wahabee ruler, desired to extend his authority and influence over the tribes of Oman, with whose chiefs he commenced a correspondence by letter, intimating his intention of sending Syud bin Mootluk as his Agent to them, and invit ing them cordially to unite with and afford him every aid and assistance. The originals of these letters, with the exception of that to the address of Khaleefa bin Shakboot, the Beniyas Chief (who alleged his right to keep, and denied that of the British authority to ask it of him), were procured by the Acting Resident, Colonel Robertson, who thereon addressed a letter of remonstrance to the Wahabee ruler, explaining the ill effects which had hitherto resulted from the establishment of Wahabee •WAHABEES. 453 tenets among the pirate chieftains, which had led to their chastisement by the British Government; deprecating his present attempts to bring them again under Wahabee authority and influence, as calculated to recall to their minds the deeds of other times, when they were similarly stimulated by his predecessors, and to arouse the savage propensities of those who were now quietly settling down into peaceable natives, and thereby to draw down upon them the just vengeance of the British Government. Abdoolla bin Sooneyan, in reply, declared his intention to co-operate with the British Government to check piracy; that he had promulgated the same to the people of Oman, whom he called his subjects, and to others of other countries, enjoining them to abstain from inflicting injuries upon others, and, with regard to the sea, to act in the very manner pointed out,—professions which, rated at their true value, were probably worth nothing; but, whether sincere or faithless, were a matter of little moment, his authority being by no means confirmed, and his views, therefore, liable to any change, as his fame and influence increased or diminished. The Brymee Shaikhs claimed, in their public answers to the ruler of Nujd, a species of connection with the British Government, which, although not absolutely subsisting, was possibly adduced in the hope that, if Abdoolla bin Sooneyan were ignorant of the truth, he might be deterred from interfering in their concerns from fear of the supposed alliance. There were those among them, however, who courted the good will and friendship of the new Wahabee ruler, and desired to tender their submission to him ; and the contents of their letters, secretly despatched, were supposed to be of a very opposite tenor to that above alluded to. The heavy exactions levied upon the inhabitants of Kateef and other places under his authority, by Ameer Abdoolla bin Sooneyan, rendered him for a time unpopular. Some of the Bedouin Tribes still refused to make their allegiance, and a faint effort on the part of his rival, the deposed usurper Khalid, at Gusseem, to recover his lost position, insti- gated and encouraged, it was reported, by emissaries from the Turkish Government, threatened at one instant to jeopardise his newly acquired authority. This danger was no sooner averted than, in March 1843, news of a d 1843 Ameei Fysul s arrival at Gusseem were receiv ed ; and although he still continued to keep up a correspondence with the Oman Chiefs, Abdoolla bin Sooneyan's attention was evidently too much taken up in his own affairs to admit of his entertaining any designs immediately opposed to the policy of the British Government on the Arabian Coast.R| ■■■■■I % 454 WAHABEES. The report of the re-appearance in June 1843 of the legitimate ruler Ameer Fysul, in Nujd, proved correct. His march to the southward and eastward was attended with undisturbed success, and Abdoolla bin Sooneyan very shortly found himself invested with a few followers in the citadel of Riaz (which place itself had fallen into the hands of his opponent), and compelled to surrender at discretion. Khalid, the first usurper, was still at Medina, and refused Fvsul's invitation to join him. The latter had now, however, nothing to fear from this quondam antagonist, whose assumption and loss of power had been coeval with the occupation and evacuation of Nujd by the Egyptian troops, upon whose support he had been dependent, having at no time carried with him the good will and hearts of the inhabitants. Ameer Fysul sent a messenger, in July 1843, with letters to the mari time and inland Shaikhs of Oman, intimating his intention of sending an army under Syud bin Mootluk, on the termination of the hot weather, for the purpose of bringing that province under his authority. These communications were generally favourably received by the former, Muktoom of Debaye being the only Shaikh who exhibited a disinclina tion. Of the latter, the Chiefs of Brymee, Humood bin Suroor and Mahomed bin Abdoolla, addressed letters in November 1843 to the Eesident, stating their belief in the earnestness of the Wahabee ruler's intimation, and requesting the aid and support of the British Govern ment in order to repel the invaders. They were informed, in reply, that the communications formerly entered into with them by the British Government had reference solely to the advance of the Egyptian troops, and the connection subsisting between His Highness Mahomed Ali Pacha with Nujd ; but that these circumstances being now altogether changed, and the impending danger removed, by the departure of the troops under Korshid Pacha from that province, it was the intention of the British Government to withdraw from all interference in the inter nal affairs of Arabia. At this very time, too, the Resident received a communication from the Ameer himself, expressive of a desire for the renewal of the amicable relations which existed between his father Toorkey and the British Go vernment. These sentiments of friendship were duly responded to, and the sole object of the British Government in this quarter being the sup pression of plunder and bloodshed on the seas, and the security of all well disposed inhabitants of the shores of the Gulf, in the prosecution of their several employments, represented to and impressed upon him,— views which he had equally declared to be entertained by himself. The knowledge that a friendly intercourse was kept up between the English authorities and the ruler of Nujd could not fail to make a favourable and beneficial impression upon the minds of the Maritime Arabs.WAHABEES. 455 In December 1843 he made an attempt to mediate a reconciliation between the Bahrein ex-Chief and his grand nephew, Mahomed bin Khaleefa , but his good offices being refused by the former, who declined coming to any friendly arrangement with his successful rival, he determined upon supporting the latter. The fort of Demaum, held by the ex-chief's sons, continued therefore under blockade at sea, and the Wahabee Chief promised to send a force to invest it by land, and check the proceedings of certain tribes opposed to his re-establish ment in authority, and who in the meanwhile had espoused the cause of Abdoolla bin Ahmed, and continued to supply the garrison with such necessaries as it required. This long piomi&amp;ed land force at length made its appearance, its march having been delayed in order to carry into effect the chastise ment its leader was called upon to inflict upon those tribes who had hitherto refused to acknowledge him, and who had, further, been con cerned in the plunder of Persian pilgrims, and other robberies. Demaum fell, and was immediately taken possession of by Ameer Fysul, who has since maintained a garrison there, with a view to appropriating the revenues, to the prejudice of the lawful owner, Busheer bin Rahmah; who, having joined the coalition in the hope of ultimately recovering his patrimony in the event of success,—its restora tion having been, indeed, guaranteed to him in such case by Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa,—is of course much disappointed. Ameer Fysul having gained the object for which he engaged in the war, viz. the cession of Demaum, would appear inclined to permit the contending parties to prolong or terminate the struggle without any further interference on his part, provided he were not alienated from the cause of Mahomed bin Khaleefa, and induced to take part with the ex-chief, by the former's being so blind to his own interests as to persist in neglecting to fulfil his engagement for the payment of the annual tribute.456 WAHABEES. conclusion, to the year 1853, BY LIEUTENANT II. F. DISBROWE. The Wahabce proceedings are so fully detailed in the Sketches of Muskat, the Beniyas, and the Uttoobees, that it does not appear neeessary to do more than run over as briefly as possible the chief acts o( the Ameer, and the parlies His Highness deputed to Brymee, Kateef, and the ports on the shores of Arabia. Early in the year 1845 Syud bin Mootluk arrived from Nujd in 10 „ r the vicinity of Brymee. The force that accom- a. d. IStO. . , . . pamed him was by no means considerable, and he seems accordingly to have been somewhat mistrustful as to the reception he would meet with from the people of the tribes through whose territories he had to pass on his journey ; for we find him sending messengers and spies in advance of his troops, to feel the way before him, and to report on the stale of feeling generally mani fested towards him. These precautions, however, proved scarcely necessary, for the holders of the Brymee forts hastened to tender their submission when they heard of his approach ; the maritime chiefs proceeded to wait upon him ; the Naeem, Zowalim, and Shuanil Tribes joined him, and delivered over such forts as he required ;—in short, one and all appeared to vie with each other as to who should welcome him most, and afford him the greatest support. Speedily availing himself of so favourable a moment, now that he stood high in the favour of all, Syud bin Mootluk sent forth demands upon the Muskat and Sohar Governments for the payment of tribute. Syud Soweynee and Syud Humood bin Azan, the chief authori ties of these places, cordially uniting, held a joint consultation regarding the course it would be best to pursue, and, finally, it was agreed between them that the Sohar Chief should satisfy the demands of the Wahabees at once, lest his territories, which lay in such close proximity to Brymee, should be doomed to invasion; but that Syud Soweynee should declare his determination to make a reference to his father, Syud Saeed, at Zanzibar, ere disbursing a , farthing. The above are the terms that were proffered, and the Wahabee Lieutenant professed himself willing to agree to them. By what motive he was subsequently prompted is not known, but scarcely had he ac cepted the above conditions than he sent word to Syud HumpodWAHABEES. 457 bin Azafi, telling him plainly that the tribute originally required at his hands was too small in amount, and directing him to pay an additional sum; and when objections were raised, he hastened to ravage his territories, seizing upon the fort of Mujces, and ruthlessly butchering the whole of the garrison within it. Syud Humood made preparations for resistance, but guided and influenced by the advice of the elders of his tribe, rather than witness the horrid scenes of bloodshed and slaughter that must inevitably have followed, had he with his poor resources dared to encounter the powerful Wahabee, he made good the tribute demanded. This breach of faith was quickly succeeded by another. In June 1845, before an answer had been received by His Excellency Syud Soweynee from his father, the Imaum, pending the arrival of which Syud bin Mootluk had pledged himself to refrain from hostilities, he {Syud bin Mootluk) summoned the heads of the tribes to flock to his standaid, with theii foices, and declared his intention to march upon Muskat as early as possible. A large army was speedily collected, and fears were entertained by the Resident lest an attack should really be made upon His Highness' dominions. A strong naval demonstration was accordingly made off' the Batinah Coast, and letters were addressed by Major Hennell to the Wahabee Ameer, as well as to his Lieutenant in JBrymee, exhorting the former to restrain his representative in Oman from such faithless proceedings, and desiiing the lattei to desist from hostilities until he was possessed of further advices fiom his superior, the Ameer. These measures pio\ed successful, and were, moreover, responded to in a satisfactory manner by the Wahabee. The storm blew over. His Excellency Syud Soweynee engaged, in the name of his father, to disburse annually the sum of 5,000 crowns as tribute to the Ameer; adding thereunto on the present occasion the sum of 2,000 crowns, by way of a piesent to Syud bin Mootluk. Peace was concluded, and the W^aha- bee foices, after restoiing the fort of Mujees, so unlawfully taken, withdrew from the Sohar territories. The welcome accorded to Syud bin Mootluk, when first he arrived at Brymee, that bade fair to be so lasting and firm, did not prove of long duration. His proud and arrogant behaviour quickly alienated the affections of all the tribes in Oman. Chief after chief conceived a hatred against him, and ranged themselves in opposition to his cause. Of the maritime chiefs, one alone (the Chief of Amulgavine) remained staunch to his side. The Shaikh of the Naeem, a powerful clan, and Syud Humood bin458 WAHABEES. Azan, united together, and were shortly joined by the Muttowas for the purpose of withstanding the oppression of one they styled' a^i invader. The roads from Brymee to Nujd were infested with robbers' opposed to his ascendancy,—so much infested, indeed, that not a mes' senger of his could pass but was beaten ; not a fraction of treasure could be sent to the Ameer in Nujd yet, notwithstanding the mani fold proofs of the disgust that was growing towards him, he issued orders for the assemblage of a large force at Brymee, on the termination of the fast, for the purpose of either seizing upon the fort of Zeit, in the vicinity of Ejman, or of covering the erection of a stronghold on a spot where fresh water abounds, about seven miles inland, by means of which he would be enabled to hold the maritime Shaikhs of the coast more completely in check than was the case at present. This design the whole of the Joasmee Chiefs, excepting Abdoolla bin Rashid of Amulgavine, were determined to oppose. In the meanwhilp Syud bin Mootluk, having failed in his in.rig.les to gain the strong fort of Zemch, belonging to the Boo Kheriban branch of the Naeem iiibe, one ol the most productive and flourishing spots in that quarter, exhibited such evident intention of making himself master of it, even by force, that Shaikh Ahmed bin Ali, having, through the mediation of the Chief of the Beni Ghafir, effected a reconciliation with those members of the A1 Boo Khamis branch with whom he had been upon unfriendly terms, and been assured of their support in the event ot actual hostilities, at once decided that he would defend his possessions at all risks and hazards. The Shaikhs of Debaye and Shargah, finding the hands of the Wahabee Agent thus effectually tied for the present, have contented themselves with detaining two nlen from each pearl boat, to guard against a surprise, and have permitted the remainder to proceed to the banks. Towards the close of the year, so strong was the party in league against Syud bin Mootluk, so precarious did he feel his position to be,— for reports had reached the Ameer that he was appropriating to himself a considerable portion of the treasure he had collected,—that he medi tated pioceeding in person to Nujd, to wait upon his master, and try to dispel fiom his mind all credence in the evil reports so freely circulated against him. A day had even been fixed for his departure from Brymee, when the unexpected arrival of messengers with letters from the Ameer confirming him in his position, but desiring him to send without delay any icady money he might have in his possession'—led to the sudden abandonment of the plan, and the despatch of a considerable sum to Nujd, through the medium of Shaikh Suggur bin Sultan, ^ o, as well as his father. Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, having been avoured with flattering communications from the Ameer by the sameWAHABEES. 459 opportunity, hastened to provide a vessel for the transmission of the treasure. The year 1845 is also remarkable for the hostilities that arose be tween Abdoolla bin feaeed, the Wahabee Governor of the port of Kateef, and the Shaikhs of Bahrein. The cause of the quarrel and the pro' ceedings of either party have been so fully detailed in the Sketch of the Uttoobees that to repeat them here were idle and profitless ; suffice it to say, therefore, that dissensions continued to rage until the month of August 1847, when matters were brought to a peaceable settle- a. d. 184/. ment, the Ameer pledging himself in no way to assist Abdoolla bin Ahmed, the ex-Chief of Bahrein, in his efforts to recover his position as chief of the island, and Shaikh Mahomed bin Khaleefa engaging to pay the Wahabee the'sum of 4,000 dollars. In the ensuing year, the Wahabee prestige received a severe check a. d. 1848. ^ 10m t ^ e Shaikh of the Beniyas, who contrived t0 reduce the forts of Brymee, to defeat and discomfit a Nujdee force sent specially against him, and so com pletely to paralyse the efforts of Syud bin Mootluk to recover his lost authority in Oman, that he drove him to seek refuge at Shar- gah, and there to remain until forces could be collected by the Joasmee and his allies to give him assistance. These troops were speedily assembled and towards the close of the year the combined armie* of Shaikh Sultan, Muktoom bin Butye, and Humeed bin Rashid, set out from Shargah with Syud bin Mootluk, and the remnant of the Nujdees to attack Shaikh Syud at Brymee. Affairs, however, rough the mediation of an envoy deputed by the Sherreeff of Mecca to compose the differences that had arisen, precluded the necessity for a recourse to active hostilities. Peace was concluded, and the Wahabee commander reinstated in his position at Brymee. In the following year Ameer Fysul appears to have entertained the #. d. 1849. d6sl S n of reducing the island of Bahrein to sub- o, . tt ml f lon 10 ^ own authority. From a reference to Sketch of the Uttoobees will be gathered how the Ameer came to the neighbourhood of the island in person; how His Highness induced Iver t th ^ G'''' Coast t forsake the Uttoobees, and come . , he ® lde ° f the Nujdccs; how the sons of the ex-chicf suddenly equipped a fleet from the Persian Coast, and, after attacking and forcing their way through the line of Uttoobce vessels blockading the port of Kateef, succeeded in joining the Wahabees ; how Shaikh Mahomed was on e point of being compelled to succumb to the overwhelming force in eague against him ; and, finally, how the timely arrival off the island of our ships of war, blasting the hopes and ambiUous design, or ^hWAHABEES. 460 the Wahabees and the refugees from Kenn, matters were peaceably settled (July 1851), and the integrity of the island of Bahrein was preserved. There remains but to notice the fear and trepidation caused in the a. d. 1852. minds of the Muskat authorities by the approach of a Nujdee force, under the command of no less a person than a son (Abdoolla bin Fysul) of the Ameer himself. Full and ample particulars connected with the affair,—the steps adopt ed by Abdoolla bin Fysul, and the result of those steps; the proceedings of the Resident to oppose the ambitious designs of the Wahabee, and the success that attended those proceedings,—these have all been so fully detailed in the Muskat narrative, that I will conclude by saying that the invasion of the Batinah districts, at one time contemplated, was abandoned, and matters were brought to a settlement, in 1853, by His a. d. 1853.

Pv either Aboothabee, nor the Beniyas Tribe inhabiting it, appears to have met with a separate notice in Mr. Warden's Sketches. It is situated just below Ras Suffan, on a portion of land formed into an island by a backwater, which admits boats, but which is fordable at one spot during low-water. The anchorage off the town is unsafe - vessels drawing fourteen feet water are obliged to lie a mile and a quarter off from the shore, and are completely exposed to the violence o the north-westers; while, from the low nature of the shore, and prevalence of hazy weather, it is extremely difficult of access ' The town, with the exception of the Shaikh's house, or small fort, is built entirely of cadjans, the policy of the present ruler, Tahnoon, being opposed to the erection of stone buildings, as rendering his subjects too in ependent of him, and, at the same time, causing him to be more tangible by an attack on the sea side. The number of inhabitants fluctuates, but may be taken on an average at about 18,000 souls. During the pearl fishing upwards of 600 boats visit the banks, each caii}ing from bevcn to fifteen men. The soil is arid, and unproductive, anc the watei on the island brackish. Aboothabee is consequently ( ependent upon other places for its supplies of provisions, and is soon re need to gieat distress by anything like an effective blockade. The Beniyas Tribe is composed of several others, such as the Marier and the Kemzan, descended from the Beni Sukur; the Hawamul and the Mujalibah, from the A1 Ali ; the Sumeesat, from the Abedal; the Rameesat, fiom the Beni Humeed ; the Maharibah, from the Beni Naeem; the Bomaher, from the Shubeeb and Kalazy ; the A1 Boo Felasa, from a branch of the Beniyas; and the Beni Kaab, from the Ivaab. The rulers over this collection of tribes have generally been selected from the Huboo Fulah family, from which Shaikh Tahnoon is descended. The original seat of the Beniyas, like that of the Arabian Tribes, was in Nujd, but on leaving that part of Arabia they settled in the tract of country extending between Biddah and Brymee. The larger poition of the tiibe was composed of Bedouins, residing in the interior, an tending theii ilocks and herds ; but some few individuals, reducedIS | BENIYAS. 403 to poverty through the loss of their cattle, took up their abode on the shores of the Persian Gulf, on the line of coast between Debaye, and a short distance from the island upon which the town of Aboothabee now stands, but which at that time, from its being supposed to be wholly destitute of water, was uninhabited. It was, however, sometimes visited by the Beniyas fishermen, as a place well adapted for the prosecution of their employment; but on these occasions they were under the necessity of taking their supplies of water with them. One of these individuals, however, having occasion to dig into the ground was delighted to find the pit fill with tolerable water; a discovery which induced the visitors to take up their permanent residence upon the island of Aboothabee. The first establishment (which consisted of twenty houses) took place a. d . 1761 to 1763. about the year 1761. The intelligence of water having been found quickly spread through the tribe and before two years had elapsed the place had increased to four hundred houses ; from which period to the present additions to the population and dwellings have been constantly making. The Shaikhs 0 the tribe for many years continued to reside in the interior, payino- occasional visits to Aboothabee, and receiving presents from the inhabitants According to one opinion, the original founder of the uboo Fulah family was Shaikh Yas bin Amer bin Ghes bin Nuzur (From the last the t Prophet of Islam is said to be descended.) It is ^wever, asserted by others that Shaikh Tahnoon's ancestor was' Zhelal, a lineal descendant of Gharrem^ool-Zeighee. Nothing, how- ever, appeals to be known regarding his successors until after the death of the great grandfather of Shaikh Shakboot, the father of the sZT* ^ 0f Ab00thabee - This P^son left four sons, named Inhian, !n&lt;l the B 10m T k an - TheSe Soon with each other, the Beniyas Tnbe, being consequently divided into four parties, a 1 T'T7 T pro, '' acted contest was carried on between them. On the c eath of the three first, they were succeeded by their respective sons, Esa n Inluan, Zaed bin Mahomed, and Sultan bin Saadoon, during whose son Zhcab f.h ^ ^ V ' m]ent - ^ WaS suocee d e d by Us son Zheab, a the nominal head of the Beniyas. The new chief observing that the inclinations of the bulk of the tribe were inclined to his unci! Zaed bin Mahomed, availed himself of a favourable opportunity and over the ^h ^ ^ ^ -^lishedhis ei the v..lole of the Beniyas. He continued to govern undisturbed or some time, until a grandson of Mahomed, named Huza bin Zaed w resided in Aboothabee, endeavoured to stir up the neighbourin' tribes against Mm. At this time Shaikh Zheab resided in theTnterio. paying only occasional visits to his capital.g- 1\ !: m 464 BENIYAS. d . 1793. a. d . 1795 to 1819. On the occasion of one of these visits, in 1793, Shaikh Zheab thought proper to give orders that the family of Huza, together with all his dependents, should leave Aboothabee, and settle in the interior. At this time Huza was absent in Bahrein, but, receiving intelligence of the proposed removal, he hastened back, and, in the course of an angry dispute with his relative (Zheab), drew his sword, and struck him dead upon the spot. This action again split the Beniyas into two divisions, one of which supported Huza, while the other and larger portion adhered to Shakboot (the son of the murdered chief), who prosecuted the feud with such success as to put to death the ten individuals who were present at the time of his father's murder. Dreading a similar fate, Huza at last left Aboothabee with his dependents, and settled in Aboo Ali. After his departure. Shaikh Shakboot assumed undisputed possession of the chief authority in the tribe, and continued at its head until 1816, in which year his eldest son, Mahomed, succeeded in deposing him. Mahomed remained as Shaikh for two years, when his younger brother, Tahnoon, having received a Buggalow, together with a considerable sum of money, from the Imaum, returned from Muskat to Aboothabee, and, with the assist ance of his father, and good will of the majority of the tribe, succeeded in expelling the usurper in 1818. For some time after this event both father and son acted together as heads of the tribe, but gradually the authority of Shaikh Tahnoon became superior. To this alteration in their respective relations Shakboot appears to have submitted quietly, as he continued to reside in Aboothabee and its neighbour hood, and was at all times employed by Tahnoon in the arrangement of any affairs of negotiation he might be engaged in. Mahomed bin Shakboot with some difficulty saved his life by flight, and, taking refuge in Biddah, claimed the protection of Abdoolla bin Ahmed, the Chief of Bahrein. Until this period the Beniyas had always been the close and intimate allies of the Joasmees, but the connection formed by Shaikh Tahnoon with the Imaum of Muskat gradually weakened the friendship existing between the two tribes, until at last a total change ensued in their relations, and they became bitter enemies. In 1820 the Beniyas Tribes were admitted members of the General Treaty* concluded by the British Government a. d. 18_0. with the Maritime Arabs of the Persian Gul, for the effectual suppression of piracy in that sea. About the year 1822, an individual of some rank, named Sooedan bin Zaal, fled from Aboothabee, to avoid t e a. n. 1822. payment of his debts, and at the same time * Vide pages 76 to 80 of this Selection.\ BENIYAS. 465 carried off a number of boats belonging to that place with him. After leading a wandering life for some time about the Gulf (during which his pioceedings were viewed with more than ordinary suspicion by the Biitish authorities), he finally settled in Biddah, under the protection of the Bahrein Shaikh, Shaikh Tahnoon, enraged at his flight, prose cuted very active operations against him, and succeeded in capturing some boats and property belonging to him. These proceedings bein- considered as likely to endanger the tranquillity of the Gulf, and lead to a renewal of piracy, an intimation was made to His Highness the Imaum (who was supposed to hold some control over the Beniyas Chief) through Colonel Kennett, (the Political Agent), that unless Shaikh Tahnoon gave up what he had seized, and desisted in future rom any such proceedings, a vessel of war would be sent to Abootha- bee to compel restitution, and destroy his fortifications. In the end of 1823 Shaikh Tahnoon's brother, Mahomed bin Shak- a. 0. 1823. boot ' havin g collected together a body of the Monasir Tribe, attacked and plundered Aboo- thabee. The former immediately marched with 1,500 men to relieve the town, and after an action, which lasted some hours, Mahomed was iorced to retreat, after losing thirty-five men, and subsequently took refuge mShargah. This place being threatened by Shaikh Tahnoon il the fugitives were not given up. Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur collected troops, and prepared to resist, but soon after Mahomed bin Shakboot left his protection, and took up his residence in Huailah, under the authority of Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed of Bahrein. About this time a treaty of peace between the Imaum, Shaikh Tah- a. .d .J824-25. noon, and Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, was con- . eluded, through the mediation of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, the principal condition of which was the destruction of the towers of Brymee, as well as the fort of Derah a Trib 01t be ' ween Shargah and Debaye, occupied by the Sooedan Tribe, under Salmin bin Nassir. A number of secret intrigues appear have been earned on in respect to the former place, which cannot inllfiirT, ! bUt 8h r aikh 8Ul,an ShOWin « —iderable hesitation ing lis poition of the engagement, the Beniyas Chief made prcparatmns for the renewal of hostilities, which were only averted by he influence of the Imaum and the Resident in the Persian Gnlf both of whom, it was at last arranged, were to send messengers afong wi h Sultan bin Suggur's people, to see the stipulation of thf treaty ', ing the destruction of the towers of Brymce carried into effect Th arrangement was, however, rendered useless by Shaikh Sultan 4, Jin* material advantage being gained by cither party o^trothTr ' •VMM mmm466 BENIYAS. About the latter part of the year 1825, the Imaum having arrived in a. d. 1825. the Gu l f With a fleet ' His Hi ghness offered his mediation, which was accepted, and a peace between the Beniyas Chief and Sultan bin Suggur was again conclud ed. The terms agreed upon were that the fort of Derah should be demolished, and Salmin bin Nassir, with the Sooedan Tribe, removed out of Shaikh Sultan's territories, while the fort of Debaye was to receive; a party of troops, under the command of an officer of the Imaum. In 1826 Obed bin Sadoon (a follower of Sooedan bin Zaal, already a. d. 1826. mentioned as having fled from Aboothabee in 1822) and Syf bin Thykhan sailed from Biddah, and captured a Buggalow belonging to Aboothabee, killing and wound ing several of her people. They also took possession of an Amulgavine boat, in which there was one man killed, and another wounded; but afterwards allowed her to proceed on her voyage. Subsequently, these marauders stripped a Bahrein boat, and carried all the plunder to Biddah, from which place they made their escape. These proceedings created a lively indignation in the mind of Shaikh Tahnoon against Abdoolla bin Ahmed, the Chief of Bahrein, for the countenance and shelter afforded to his rebellious subjects.. He appealed very earnestly to the British authority for redress, and was with some difficulty re strained from declaring war against the Uttoobee Shaikh. 'I he terms of the treaty lately concluded between the Joasmee and Beniyas Tribes, relating to the demolition of Derah and the removal of the Sooedan Tribe, not having been carried into effect by Shaikh Tahnoon, the Joasmee Chief applied, in September 1826, to the Resident, for permission to endeavour to dislodge the occupants by force. He consented however to delay his proceedings until it was seen whether the Aboothabee Shaikh would attend to the recommendation given hina by the British authority for him to withdraw his countenance and support from the Sooedan Tribe. No attention, however, was paid by Tahnoon to the personal exhortations of the Resident, who, in the course of an in terview at Aboothabee, endeavoured to convince him that the evacuation of the place in question had become necessary for the preservation of the public peace, which was constantly perilled by the outrageous con duct of Salmin bin Nassir's followers towards the neighbouring tribes, and that both his credit and interest depended in a great measure upon the due performance of his'engagement regarding the demolition of Derah, as the treaty containing this article had received the sanction of His Highness the Imaum, and the English Government. Finding the Beniyas Chief inflexible, the British authority proceeded to Muskat, and there, having acquainted His Highness the Imaum with the contumacy displayed by Shaikh Tahnoon, His Highness promised to send twoBENIYAS. 467 vessels to cruise off the fort, to prevent assistance being sent by him, while the Joasmee troops from Shargah and Ras-ool -Khyma invested it by land. No steps, however, were taken in the affair till March 1827, when the A D 1827&gt; Imaurn sailed with his fleet for Derah, and caused that place to be demolished. At the same time, as a sort of compensation to Shaikh Tahnoon's wounded dignity, he supplied him with cannon and ammunition, besides using all his influence to induce the inhabitants of JDebaye to place themselves under his authority. Prior to His Highness' appearance, a negotiation for peace had been commenced between the rival Shaikhs, which had nearly been brought to a favourable termination, when the arrival or intrigues of Hi^ Highness (who has always felt disposed to view with a jealous eye any combination between these powerful chieftains) threw matters into the same disorder and confusion which had formerly existed. Tahnoon, availing himself of the support afforded to him by the Imaum, made a sudden and vigorous attack on Debaye, which was successful. In November 1827 Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur declared war against Tahnoon, on account of his continued aggressions. Among these was the seizure of several Shargah pearl boats by Khaleefa bin Dumeethar, the Governor of Debaye, who, however, was compelled, by the prompt and efficient measures taken by the officer commanding the vessel of war cruising on the pearl banks, to restore both the vessels and caro-o. The proceedings of Dumeethar produced a strong remonstrance from a. d. 1828. the P olitical authority to Shaikh Tahnoon, and subsequently, in an interview held with that personage in April 1828, Major Wilson pointed out the ill effects likely to arise if he permitted his dependents to conduct themselves in such an irregular manner. Shaikh Sultan, however, does not appear to have acted upon his declaration of war, as he took no further steps after publishing it, and affairs remained as they were. Agreeably to the arrangement previously made with the Jmaurn Shaikh Tahnoon joined His Highness with a large contingent in October 1828, and accompanied the expedition against Bahrein. From what has since transpired, there is reason to believe that a secret understand ing existed between the Beniyas Chief and the Shaikh of Bahrein- for a ter the appearance of the fleet before that island, the inhabitants were minutely informed of everything in agitation, while the irregular and insubordinate conduct of Shaikh Tahnoon and his followers was the principal cause of the total failure of the whole affair. The two notorious characters Sooedan bin Zaal and Syf bin Thykan mentioned as having carried off a number of boats from Aboothabee , 61 }468 BENIYAS. and fled to Biddah in 1822, having effected a reconciliation with Shaikh Tahnoon, left the latter place, and returned to their old residence in the Beniyas capital. In July 1828 two Bahrein Buggarahs and one Koweit Buteel were captured near the former place, by some of the Beniyas Tribe. These vessels were, however, subsequently recovered, and restored to their owners; but the pirates, making their escape into the interior, avoided the punishment they so well deserved. In September 1S28 a boat, manned principally by people of the Beniyas Tribe, under the command of an inhabitant of Bahrein, named Obed bin Mohunnah, proceeded over to the Persian Coast, for the purpose of cruising, but their leader having been seized while landing at Zeerab, a small village on the Persian Coast, they returned to the Arabian side of the Gulf. On their way back they fell in with four Aseeloo boats, near Seei Beniyas, which they plundered ; and afterwards proceeded to the neighbourhood of Aboothabee, to which place the sufferers likewise hastened, to lay their complaints before Shaikh Tahnoon, who behaved on this occasion in a very creditable manner, having afforded them such compensation for the aggression committed as fully satisfied them. Hostilities having again broken out in February 1829 between Shaikh a d 1829 Tahnoon and the Joasmee Chief, Aboothabee, the capital of the former, was at one time re duced to very great distress, by the blockade maintained by Shaikh Sultan. Both parties, however, felt the inconvenience of carrying on war during the season of the pearl fishing, and at length a peace was concluded between the belligerents in the month of June 1829, through the good offices of Shaikh Mahomed bin Guzeeb, the Governor of Lingah. The Imaum of Muskat and the Shaikh of Bahrein having dropped further hostilities, and entered into amicable relations with each other, Shaikh Tahnoon, as the ostensible ally of His Highness, was admitted as a member of the treaty of peace concluded in December 1829, although no act of hostility had ever been displayed towards him by the Uttoobees. The Beniyas Shaikh appears to have remained quiet till the begin- , . ning of 1831, when, on the occasion of the • d. xoox* 'i i • • • a u * Imaum declaring war a second time against nis relation Humood bin Azan of Sohar, he sent down a number of men to Muskat, with an offer of their services in the approaching contest. Whether suspicious of the Shaikh's fidelity, from observing the invari able ill success which attended all the operations in which a share was borne by the Beniyas Tribe, or from some other cause, is uncertain, but all his proffers were peremptorily rejected by His Highness. Irn-BENIYAS. 469 tatcd at this repulse, and probably alarmed at the increase of influence likely to be acquired by his rival, Sultan bin Suggur, from the favour of the Imaum, Shaikh Tahnoon appears to have thrown himself into the opposite scale, and, by a well-timed expedition into the Joasmee tenitoiies, prevented that tribe from affording any efficient support to His Highness operations against Sohar. The consequence of this foray was a declaration of war on the part of Sultan bin Suggur, who made extensive preparations for the blockade of Aboothabee. The prospect of hostilities, however, during the pearl fishing season, excited great discontent in the minds both of the Joasmees and Beniyas, in con sequence of which the good offices of Shaikh Mahomed bin Guzeeb of Lingah were sought by both parties, and after a short negotiation a peace was concluded, in July 1831, through the mediation of that chief, and the subjects of both parties proceeded forthwith to the pearl banks. Shortly after this arrangement, a piracy was committed by some people of Shargah upon two Beniyas pearl boats. In retaliation for this outrage. Shaikh Tahnoon laid an embargo upon fourteen Joasmee Buggarahs which happened to touch at Aboothabee. These, however on the restoration of the captured boats and cargoes by Shaikh Sultan! he liberated, but detained the pearls and slaves belonging to the Shar- gah vessels until certain claims preferred by one of his subjects against p, ma ' 0 . ^ b t ye (n0W residin g under th e protection of the Joasmee ie ) should be settled. At the present time (December 1831) this affair still remains unadjusted, and it is to be feared will eventually terminate in the renewal of hostilities.

The only measure adopted by Shaikh Tahnoon during this year was a. d. 1832. 0ne of P recaution ' in despatching some well armed Buggalows to convoy his trading vessels and secure them from the attack of the Joasmee boats, which were cruising against the trade of Muskat, &lt;Scc, By giving asylum and protection to three refugees, inhabitants of Khan (a place near Shargah, under the authority of the Joasmees). who had been concerned in the piracy and plunder of a boat belonging to an English subject, off the Persian Coast, he greatly offended the British authorities, and drew upon himself the responsibility of their act which, as being Joasmee subjects, would otherwise have properly at tached to the Joasmee Chief. Although the piracy was committed in May 1832, it was not until A D 1833 early in the following year, in consequence of the repeated evasions and delays of Shaikh Tah noon, and immediate means to enforce redress not being available, owing to the pressing contingencies in other quarters (Shaikh Nassir's proceedings at Bushire, &amp;c.) requiring more urgently the services of the cruisers of the Gulf squadron, that the Resident's demand upon him for the exposure and delivery of the culprits, or the payment of 1,500 German crowns, was acceded to, by the adoption of the latter alternative. The satisfaction thus afforded, however, put it out of the power of Shaikh Sultan to excuse any further delay in making good his share of the value of the property plundered; and he was accordingly called upon to disburse the sum of 2,000 German crowns. In the exaction of the full penalty in the latter case it became necessary, on the part of the officer commanding the vessels despatched on this duty, partially to fulfil his threat of destroying a Buteel belong ing to Shargah, lying near Ejman, w T hich he crippled, by knocking away her poop deck, and lodging several shot in her hull.* In April 1833 Shaikh Tahnoon's life was sacrificed to the ambition and jealousy of his two brothers Khaleefa and Sultan, who with their own hands put him to death. Apprehending the chances of their intriguing against his life and authority, he had long ex cluded them from Aboothabee, but yielding at length to the entreaty of the father, Shakboot, recalled them from banishment, under the proviso that they should not exercise any share in the government, or carry arms. A very short time, however, served to discover them in league with some of the principal men of the tribe to murder him, upon which he cast the latter into prison, but thereby unfortunately so * This paragraph perhaps more properly belongs to the section on Joasinees, but it is inserted here in consequence of Shaikh Tahnoon having been mixed up in the affair, as above detailed.BENIYAS. 471 offended and alarmed the remainder that they too secretly entered into a conspiracy in order to put the original design into execution with the brothers. Accordingly, Shaikh Khaleefa, having concealed a loaded pistol under his clothes, took the opportunity of Tahnoon's being off his guard to shoot him in the side, when Sultan immediately despatched him with his dagger. While Tahnoon lived, the reduction of the tribe to submission promised much difficulty to the Wahabee Chief; but the first act of the usurpers was to tender allegiance and the payment of Zukat, in return for which, Toorkey bin Saood intimated to the Joasmee Chief that they were under his protection, and that he would permit of no aggressions upon them. 1 he oppiessive and arbitrary conduct of the usurpers very soon disgusted the tribe, and a conspiracy was formed (August-September 1833) by some of the principal members, who communicated their plot to a nephew of Shaikh Shakboot, the person they had selected to put his cousin Shaikh Khaleefa to death, and become chief in his room. This individual, however, betrayed them to Shaikh Khaleefa, who retired within the fort, and seizing the chief conspirators, put three of them to death, viz. Sultan bin Majid, Mahomed bin Rumeen, and Mahomed Muleefa. He likewise imprisoned two merchants, with the intention of killing them ; but the ferment thereby raised among the people of Aboothabee, combined with his brother Sultan's entreaties, induced him to spare their lives. One of them. Bin lyan, however, after beating and stripping him of his property, he sent away, together with his rela tives, in a Buggarah to Lingah. Consequent upon the discontent and ^sgust created by these proceedings, two branches of the Beniyas, the oo Felasa and Rumsha, consisting of about eight hundred persons, determined upon leaving the place on the first favourable opportunity accordingly those on the spot, leaving all their effects behind them] proceeded to Debaye, which town was after a little hesitation and delay given up tothemby the Beniyas Governor, and they summoned the rest who were on the pearl banks, to join them there. Nothing could have' afforded move satisfaetion to Shaikh Sultan bin Snggnr, the Joasmee - ef, than these dissensions and divisions among the Beniyas, and the prospect of destroying his enemies by means supplied by 'themselves He lost no ttme in proeeeding to Shargah, and agreed to assist Bin Ivan with a large force in an attack upon Aboothabee.

Shaikh Sultan refused to attend to the remonstrances of his principal adherents, pointing out he472 BENIYAS. was inflicting upon his people by withdrawing them from the pearl banks before the season had half elapsed, the probability of his in- volving himself with the English and the Wahabees, and the ad visability of permitting the Beniyas to destroy themselves, without his interference. On the 7th September the united forces, consisting of seven hundred men of the Boo Felasa and Humsha Tribes in eighty boats, and five hundred and twenty men in twenty-two boats, under the command of Sultan bin Suggur and Hussein bin Rahmah, set sail for Aboothabee, in the full conviction that the place was deserted, and would be taken without difficulty. The threatened attack, however, had had the effect of settling the disputes between Shaikh Khaleefa, Sultan, and the father Shakboot, and a force of 3,500 men of the Beniyas and Monasir Tribes had been assembled in Aboothabee. On the afternoon of the 10th, the Joasmee force landed at Khore Suffan, about four miles from the Beni yas capital, where they intended to pass the night, and make the attack on the following morning. At sunrise they were aston ished to find themselves surrounded by a much superior force, support ed by cavalry and camel-men, and a panic seizing them, they broke at the first discharge of firearms, and fled towards their boats, the greater portion of which, owing to the ebb tide, were now high and dry. Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, with four of his slaves, got into a small boat, which sank under their weight, and he had a narrow escape from drowning. His loss amounted to thirty men killed, including the brother of the Shaikh of Lingah, and a Buteel and five boats taken; that of his allies to fifteen men killed, and sixty boats taken; besides two hundred and thirty-five men made prisoners, who had no other resource but to return to their families at Aboothabee. The three Beniyas boats mentioned under the head ' Joasmees' as having evaded the blockading squadron now before Aboothabee and put to sea, proceeded to Cape Bostana, where they captured an Ejman* Buggarah carrying eight men, seven of whom they killed. They after wards fell in with a Muskat Buggalow to the westward, out of which they took some kharas of dates, 3,000 dollars, and all her guns, and killed five of her crew. The Joasmee fleet in pursuit now heaving in sight, they deserted the Buggalow, and, making all sail, escaped from their pursuers, and returned in safety to Aboothabee. Shaikh Khaleefa bin Shakboot made a foray upon the Ghuflah Tribe, who had assisted the Debaye people in cutting off the supplies by land ; and, surprising one of their villages, killed thirteen men and wounded eleven, and * The people of Ejman were acting as allies to the Joasinees, and consequently declared enemies of the Beniyas.BENIYAS. 473 carried away three hundred head of cattle. Encouraged by his success, he made several other incursions into the interior, killing and plundering wherever he went. These vigorous measures alarmed the Bedouins, who thenceforward refused to give any further assistance to the Debaye people. Ihe explanation afforded by the Beniyas Shaikhs, for the plunder of the Muskat vessel before mentioned, having been accepted by the authorities of that place, (who, since the occurrence, had made the former a present, with the desire, probably, of conciliating them, as a counterpoise to the Joasmees,) rendered the interference of the Resident uncalled for. Peace was shortly after concluded between the contending narties through the mediation of the Shaikh of Lingah, but it was destined noi to be of very long duration. A successful predatory inroad into the Joasmee territories by the Monasir, a Bedouin Tribe closely connected with Aboothabee, and the capture in retaliation of ten Beniyas nearl boats, carrying about eighty men, and pearls worth 4,000 dollars on t e anks, by the Boo Felasa of Debaye, led to the renewal of hostilities Bo h parties having been necessarily obliged to withdraw their sub- jects from the banks, to avoid the effect of reprisals on the one side and of further aggressions on the other, apprehensions of future distress were raised, by their being thus deprived of their share of the produce of the annual pearl fishery, forming the chief source of subsistence to e Maritime Arabs of the Gulf, as being almost the only means thev possess of gaining a livelihood.

Shaikh Khaleefa sent his father 7^1, boot) to Shargah, who succeeded in concluding a peace with Suit V ' in Suggur ; one of the conditions being that the Boo Felasa the ' — in Deba - shouid ^ While the people of Debaye, about the middle of 1834, evincing a. d. 1834, a piratical spirit, were making depredations upon formerly from EJman, reMdtraTVlt Mootansh Buteel from Muttra, and plundered her of proVe^t'rtotl a amount of 1,000 dollars; fortunately no lives were ^ 8^ demands onhfEts^em^milhe'w^ 'T**' ^ COmpIiance with 'he of vessels of war off ^ .he pjof i,se,fon individual vessels for which «n' f ' ocasional plunder of always, however, 'been exacted, now^oTe Tut474 BENIYAS. piracy on the part of the Beniyas, not only upon Native boats, but likewise those under British colours. They openly asserted to their captives that they were determined to leave off all trade, and commence piracy ; that their dwellings, con structed of sticks and cadjan mats, could be moved into the interior at will, and thus placed, with themselves, out of the power of the English. The extent of their success of course depending upon despatch, their fleets cruised for a length of time on the Persian Coast, in the general track of the Gulf trade, committing the most daring depredations, attended with the greatest cruelty, involving in some cases the murder of the whole of the crews of the boats that fell into their hands. The most speedy and ample retribution was therefore imperatively necessary, to deter the other tribes from following the example, and thus rendering unsafe the commerce between this Gulf and the Indian seas. All the available vessels of war were immediately despatched on a cruise, to-intercept the piratical fleets. One only, however, had the good fortune to fall in with them, and the following is a detailed ac count of the action which ensued, in the words of Captain Sawyer, her commanding officer :— ' At daylight of the 16th, observed three Buggalows, one Buteel, and three Buggarahs, to the NW., standing SW. Turned the hands out, and made all possible sail to come up. At 6 a. m . got them broad off the lee bow, and found we gained upon them. Beat to action, and pre pared to engage. At 7 o'clock fired the larboard bow gun, and hoisted our colours. Discovered the headmost Buggalow to be completely crowded with men, and having in tow a large one. She fired a gun, hoisted a red flag, and dipped it three times, apparently in contempt and defiance. The whole then closed, and formed, and fired a shot, which fell rather short. The leading Buggalow immediately returned it, and the shot was seen to take the water about midway. The whole then struck their colours, and one of the Buggarahs lowered her sail, and pulled towards us, evidently with the intention of attracting our attention. On minutely observing her, found she was full of men. There was now no doubt of this being the piratical fleet belonging to Aboothabee, and the Arab pilot confidently assured us they were. On closing, he re cognised the vessels, and declared the leading one contained Shaikh Saltan bin Shakboot. On finding we were gaining, he cast off the tow, and they lowered their sails, and closed within pistol-shot, with the other boats formed on their beam for battle. We immediately stood between them, having just room to do so without touching, having the Shaikh's Buggalow on the starboard, and the tow on the larboard side. In passing between them we poured into each a broadside, round and grape, the guns nearly touching. The crew of the Shaikh's vessel cheered,BENIYAS. 475 crying 'Alia Akbar ai Kaffer.' Some were seen in the act of attempting to throw grapnels into us, but were immediately shot. About ninety or a hundred men rushed towards the head, with their long spears, which touched our quarter, for the purpose of boarding us, in which they failed, having met with a most destructive fire from small arms. There must have been at least two hundred men in this vessel, and they presented a most formidable phalanx, with their towering spears. Very serious damage must have been sustained by these vessels, as large splinters were seen flying in all directions. Immediately after passing, about ninety men jumped overboard from the tow, and were picked up by the Shaikh's vessel, who hoisted her sail, and stood to the northward accompanied by one of the Buteels, which afterwards parted En deavoured to close with him, but he outsailed us. Shifted the bow gun to the bridle port, in the hope of being enabled to cripple him, but without effect, the shot falling short. The remainder of the boats hauled up for the abandoned Bnggalow, and stripped her of her sail, and some other small articles, and then stood to the SW. At 9 o 'clock observed the chase heaving overboard some articles that we could not make out. The wind decreasing, plied his sweeps, by which he gained. Lowered the two cutters, sent them ahead to tow, and got out the longest oars for sweeps but without effect. We continued the chase until sunset, when he rounded the eastern point of Polior, about Ave miles ahead of us. Hav! mg lost SJ S ht of her ' and ni g h: coming on, deemed it advisable to give over the pursuit in our present direction, and hauled up to the south ward, in the expectation of meeting with her at daylight; which not doing stood on for Aboothabee, and about 8 a. m . of the 17th discovered the abandoned Buggalow, and stood for her. At 10 o'clock observe,I a raft, with men waving flags, about five miles to the eastward Sent an officer to take possession of the Buggalow, who found eight 'bodies on her deck, and committed them to the deep. Sent the pinnace to the raft, who found nine men on it, and brought them on board On examining them, they stated that they were part of the crew of the Buggalow we had taken possession of, called the belonging o Congoon; had been forty days from Mangalore, when she was cfptured by the fleet we found her with, near Koong, four or five days a»o • the crew consisted of forty originally,-a few arc supposed to have escapld but the others and Nakhoda were put to death ; that the mode of intend' ed attack was to board us in passing between the two Buggalows in dif erent points, and that they were confident of success. They boasted of having large vessels of oil boiling for the purpose of dippL „! when taken. They had no idea of the effects of a hlT 1 / 32-pounders, and were completely paralysed ; so much so that fh ''r ' to fire themselves, and immediately jumped overboard Salim staLsThat476 BENIYAS. his party threw twenty-five bodies overboard, and that the same number were taken away wounded. This makes thirty-three killed in this boat alone, and it is highly gratifying to me to find that none of the survivors originally belonging to the vessel were hurt by us. Two of them had been cut and stabbed by the pirates, and two others injured in the contest with them. They abandoned the Buggalow about 4 p m preferring the peril of a raft to again falling into the hands of the pirates' whom they expected to return. The other Buggalow must have suffered much more, and it is a matter of deep regret that we could not get up with her. ^ Salim states that it was the intention of the pirates, after taking the Nassir, to proceed to Ras-ool-IIud, for the purpose of committing more depredations.' Ihis exhibition of the determination and power to put down piracy very materially facilitated the attainment of our objects, and accelerated compliance with the demands now made, of which the following is a list, enumerating the various vessels plundered, not including the Muskat brig Curlew, the British Buggalow Bury a Dowlut, and various boats belonging to the Joasmees and others (between whom, however, and the Beniyas war had again lately broken out) Ust of the demands to he made on the Chief of Aboothabee, in compen sation for the outrages committed by the Beniyas on the peaceable Arabs of the Persian Gulf.

With reference to the other cases, one brig, seven Buggalows, two Buteels, five Buggarahs, and the greater part of the goods on board the urya Dowlut, were recovered, together with upwards of 10,000 Ger man crowns in cash and property, besides an engagement for 1 600 more on the termination of the pearl fishery, towards the liquidation of the claims made for the cargoes of the vessels destroyed and plundered All their captives were released, and the two pirates Mahomed bin uggur bin Zheab and Mahomed bin Majid, who headed the outrages upon the British flag, surrendered. The three principal Beniyas vessels concerned in the late piracies were put into our possession, as pled-es or the settlement of the balance due on account of the English uggalow Add to this the seizure of their own Buteel with a valuable cargo in Muskat, as above mentioned, in compensation for the loss occasion 0 by the plunder of a Buggalow belonging to that port, and the chastisement inflicted upon the piratical fleet, which make up a summary account of the reparation obtained from the Beniyas, without any further recourse to hostilities. The engagements entered into by Shaikh Shakboot, the father and tTram' t ffr f.' 16 0hief ' for the gradual liquidation of son T h T reraainil, S unadjusted, were confirmed by his and , subse iuently strictly fulfilled. The surrendered pirate —nders were sent to Bombay, where the principal one was r d, found guilty, and condemned to death; but a point of law cing raised, the question was referred to the King in Council and The ^th 16110 ^ | Ubsequ 'f ntl y commuted to transportation for' life Ihe other, Mahomed bin Majid, against whom, uufortunatelv no prosecution could be maintained, was returned, to be handed rUi!—; t0 , Shaikh Sultal1 bi ' Suggu, to' whom was left the infliction of adequate punishment. The prisoner, however, effect e ns escape unobserved, by swimming from the vessel i„ which he was being conveyed, on its arrival off Shargah, and succeedld il reaching the shore, distant about four miles. This just retr W' exacted from the Beniyas led many of the tribe, who had acdvelv engaged in the late piratical proceedings, and shared in the advantage! resulting from their success, to take shelter under the protection 'of another power until the demands pressing so heavilv 7 ? should be liquidated, in order thus to avoid a participation' in T consequences of their acts—a punishment they so justly merited. 6478 BENIYA3. To prevent Aboothabee being depopulated, and the consequent im. a. d. 1836. possibility of enforcing our demands, it became necessary to comply in a measure with the re quest of their chief, and discourage the different Arab Chieftains from affording asylum and protection to Beniyas subjects. The Gubevsat branch, under Khadim bin Nahman, nevertheless seceded, and proceed cd to establish themselves at Adeed, leaving debts to a considerable amount unsettled. Previous to taking their departure, they plundered some Aboothabee fishing-boats. All arguments and endeavours on the part ol the Resident to bring about a reconciliation having failed he was under the necessity of withdrawing himself from any further inter, lerence and of permitting the parties to take their own measures for the settlement of their respective claims. -The situation of Adeed and Wukra afforded particular facilities as places of resort to pirates, and other desperate characters, who supposed themselves intangible to our naval force; and the evil effects of the secession of the Gubeysat from Aboothabee, and their establishment at the former place, began now to manifest themselves. A member of that tribe, Jassim bin Jabbur Rugragee, and two others, Soheil bin Ateesh, and Ali Howlee, each acting independently of the other, and commanding each a small boat, containing a crew of from twelve to eighteen men, principally Bedouins of the interior, commenced a sys tematic course of plunder. Their practice, on the capture of a boat, was to come y it 01 the cargo found in it to Merfa, a desert spot situated between Adeed and Aboothabee, behind Khore Bizzum, near Has Aswamee, there load their booty on camels kept in readiness, and, having made arrangements for its disposal, re-embark, and put to sea in the prosecution of further depredations. It became imperatively necessary to undeceive the perpetrators of this dangerous species ot piracy with regard to their fancied security; and Merfa being utterly inaccessible to the means at the disposal of the Resident, the only course left to him was to hold the Chiefs of Biddah, Wukia, and Adeed responsible for their acts,—a measure justifiable on the giounds of their having identified themselves with them, inasmuch as Jassim had, in the first instance, issued from the last place, and, there was every reason to believe, received support from Khadim bin Nahman, until the publicity of his conduct had rendered it dangerous to countenance him any longer. A portion of the property had been sold at the other places ; and further, it was known that it was in their power to put an end to these lawless acts, by the seizure of the persons in question, and the destruction of their boats, they being dependent upon them for their water, and other necessaries of life.BENIYAS. 479 With these objects, and to remove the impression that that part of the dangerous and intricate coast between Has Reccan and Adeed could not be approached by our cruisers, two sloops of war and a schooner were despatched to make the attempt, which succeeded, after threading the numerous and dangerous shoals, in touching at Biddah, Wukra, and Adeed, and returning in safety. The governors of these places (Salim bin Nassir, Ali bin Nassir, and Khadim bin Nahman) bound them selves by an engagement to do their utmost to seize the boats of the pirates. The last (Khadim) was, through his Agent (Mahomed bin Ateef, the chief himself being absent) further required to afford security, in the shape of money or property, in value to the amount of 600 dollars, to be returned on the fulfilment of his promise, A fleet of Uttoobee boats, well manned and armed, also sailed in quest of the pirates, with whose secret haunts the commanders professed themselves to be well acquainted, but effected nothing. Although the pirates themselves were not seized, their lawless proceedings were put down, and the objects of the expedition fully attained. The amount, therefore, of the pledge, with the exception of 227 dollars in cash, (returned also in May 1838,) was after the lapse of several months restored to the Wukra Shaikh, who, with the others before men tioned, were informed that they would be held responsible for their future acts. Three of Jassim bin Jabbur's gang were subsequently secured by the Chief of Aboothabee, while engaged in an act of piracy, attended with loss of life, upon a Bahrein boat. After having detained them in con finement four months, during which time one had died, he set the remaining two at liberty, further punishing them by the seizure of their boat, which he subsequently, at the request of the Resident, and in his presence, publicly burnt on the beach. The Shaikh of Aboothabee, at the instance of his guest Esai bin anf, and probably at the instigation of the Tmaum, who had for some time maintained a correspondence with the disaffected members of Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed's family, intimated to the Resident his wish to join his (Esai's) cause ; but was in reply informed, that, per mission could not be granted without the special sanction of the British Government, whose decision he was called upon to await, on the grounds of the late serious misdemeanours of his tribe, and of his having no causa belli with the Uttoobees. The departure of Esai bin 1 an f and Sultan bin Salameh, with a large proportion of their followers, from his territories and protection, for the purpose of joining the expe dition of the Imaum against Mombassa, deprived him of any pretext for further uiging his proposal to wage war against Bahrein.480 beniyas. Shaikh Khaleefa at length availed himself (May 1837) of the e ' a. d. 1837. S]0n afTorded b y Resident, to adopt his wn measures against Adeed, held by the finKo seceders from Aboothabee. He eontrived to surprise them, killedZ of their number, and rendered the place uninhabitable, bvdestrmnn I ...e forts and build i„ gS) lhrowing int0 the wells the and filling them up with the ruins. ' This act of vengeance caused much irritation and alarm in the minds of he Joasmee and Debaye Chiefs, with the latter of whom some of the Gubeysat took refuge; but the conduct of Shaikh Khaleefa towards his revolted subjects, subsequent to his bringing them aeaio under subjection, being characterised by moderation, all those re-loeat ed in Aboothabee having had their boats restored to them, and the laikh publishing a full amnesty and pardon to such of the fugitives who might choose to return, at the same time promising to giJback to them their vessels and property, on the condition of their demeaninf; themselves for the future as quiet and obedient subjects. Shaikh Khadim in Nahmati, and most of the heads of the tribes who had made their escape on the occasion, were shortly induced by these favourable terms, held out by the Beniyas Chief, to return and resettle in Aboothabee. The whole of the Boo Eyneen Tribe, to the number of about three a. d. 1838. hundred families, inhabitants of Wukra, on Gultur Coast, under their Chief, AJi bin Nassir, having vacated and destroyed that place, now (March 1838) took up their residence at Aboothabee. This measure they adopted in order avoid Jie piobable consequence of their long continued insubordi nate conduct towards their ostensible chief, Abdoolla bin Ahmed, of ahrein, who, having removed from the island to Khor Hassan, on the main, greatly increased his influence over the Coast of Guttur, and rou &amp; it its inhabitants more under his immediate surveillance and control. Shaikh Khaleefa, who had suffered for a length of time much injury and annoyance at the hands of his lately rebelled subjects, the Boo relasa of Debaye, now (May 1838) determined upon retaliation. During absence of the majority of the tribe on the pearl banks, he went c anc estincly with a small force, for the purpose of destroying their date groves in the neighbourhood; but ascertaining that the sea tower was badly garrisoned, was tempted to make the attempt, and succeeded in S n § possession of it. On hearing of this occurrence, the people of e aye returned from the banks, and having obtained the powerful d^l 'ri anC 'f t ' le ^ lar §' a h, Suggur bin Sultan, after three days is o ged the Beniyas garrison (to which their chief could afford no 16 ^ and c^pietely destroyed the tower. The effect of the aboveBENIYAS. 4gl was to render neeessary the recall of all the fishing-boats belonging to the parties concerned, and hostilities at sea, in the shape of aggressions upon each other's boats (highly irregular, as being contrary to truce), ■were the result. An accommodation was, however, immediately effect ed, by the mutual restoration of the slaves and plundered property, and their boats returned to resume the fishery. Subsequent to the meeting of the several maritime chieftains, who a. d. 1839. ' Ia '' fieen assembled on board a British vessel, Shaikh Khaleefa bin Shakboot, contrary to his promise, held friendly communication with Syud bin Mootluk, the Egyptian Agent; and it was not until required by the British authori ties to declare openly, in writing, his views and intentions, that he avowed Ins determination to abide by the wishes of the British Govern ment, in opposing to the last extremity the Egyptian aggressions. In direct opposition to all his pledges and engagements, however, Shaikh Khaleefa proceeded in person with a force to the attack of the Naeem nbe of Brymce, in pursuance, it was asserted, of an agreement be tween himself and Syud bin Mootluk, by which he bound himself to harass the people of that place by every means in his power, pending the return of the Egyptian emissary with a large and efficient force. The Naeem Tribe of Brymee, however, repulsed these treacherous attacks, and gave him so severe a check that he proposed terms of peace, which they in their turn rejected, being fully aware that his object was onlJ to save his Bedouin allies from the retaliation they had lain themselves open to at the hands of those they had so much injured. He contrived subsequently to effect a peace with two out of the three tribes, upon the understanding that all past aggressions were to be buried in oblivion- but was nevertheless informed by the Resident, that if within the space of three months he had not restored the camels belonging to Ras-ool- lyma and Debaye, or did not produce a satisfactory letter from the Brymee Chiefs, certifying that he had fully adjusted all the causes of complamt existing against him, he would be considered an enemy to the British Government, and compelled to pay down the sum of 1,000 erman ciovvns, as a moderate compensation for the injuries he had inflicted upon the Naeem and Shuwamis Shaikhs, and as a punishment Government raOS, SOlemn PledgeS ^ P ' 0miseS t0 ,he Brilish On his at length, after some vain excuses, producing a letter from a. d . 1840. t ' le Naeem Chiefs, acknowledging their terms .... 0f friendsh ip with him, and their satisfaction for injuries received, these demands were foregone, but conditionally Egyptians re ,en0r COnt,UCt With refere ' Ce t0 Brymee and482 BENIYAS. A misunderstanding, of which the following are the particulars, arose during the year 1840 between the Shaikh of Debaye and Aboothabee, whose settlement was delayed until the present time, but which happily led to no serious consequences. It appeared that an inhabitant of the latter place, named Belor Shat, had proceeded to the pearl banks with a boat furnished to him by his Chief, Khaleefa bin Shakboot, but, instead of returning to his own port, had conveyed the boat to Debaye, where he remained until the present season, when, having manned her with other men, from the Boo Felasa Tribe, he proceeded to the island of Azema to fish for pearls. At this spot several other Debaye and Aboothabee boats were assembled, and Sultan bin Shakboot, the brother of the Beniyas Chief, happening to visit the island, and finding the crew of Belor Shat's boat on shore, took possession of her, and seizing his brother's fugitive subjects, returned with his capture, including pearls, arms, &amp;c. to Aboothabee. The Debaye men, finding themselves thus unexpectedly left on the island, with the loss of all they had in Belor Shat's craft, embarked in a boat belonging to some of their own people, and surprising a Beniyas Buggarah, seized her, and canied her into Debaye, where she and her crew were detained. Two other boats were seized by either tribe, but subsequently returned uninjured by the respective chiefs, who now contented themselves with referring the dispute for the decision of the Resident, their subjects prosecuting the fishing in the interim without any further interfeftnce with each other. Towards the final adjustment of the dispute, it was insisted that Shaikh Khaleefa bin Shakboot should release Belor Shat, together with the boat, arms, pearls, &amp;c. taken by Sultan, his brother; that person being left at liberty to return to Aboothabee or not as he pleased, and the boat, if proved to belong to Shaikh Khaleefa, being returned to him at the termination of the pearl fishery ; and that Muktoom on his part should surrender the Beniyas boat (seized in retaliation), with her cargo and crew, and make good whatever articles his people might have taken therefrom. These requisitions were acquiesced in by the respective chiefs. A respectable person of the Amayir, who some years previously had separated himself from his tribe, and taken up A * ^ 1S11 ' his abode at Taknoonyah, opposite to Bahrein, south of A jeer, was on his way from the former place to Bahrein with his family and property, when his Buggarah ran aground. He landec, with his family, leaving his property in the boat, intending to return to it at the rise of the tide. At night they observed a Buggarah, manne^ by fourteen persons, approach their boat, for the purpose of plundering her. A fight ensued; but the pirates succeeded, after killing one manliENIYAS. 4^3 and wounding several, in effecting their objeet, and gaining possession all the money and property she contained. The perpetrators, it was a certamcd, belonged to the tribes of Monasir and Howamil, established Kha ecf r,' yaS ', 0,1 their Crirae being broa « ht to tho no,ice of wor ! . &amp; ,a iboot '- that chief imprisoned five of the Howamil, who and cn btrii 0 ' ' aS aISO SeVeral 0f ,he chief raeH o f Monasir; d embarking, went in person, with two of three JBuggarahs, and cruised on that ground (Khore Beniyas) in search of the remainder, and ding a boat in one of the creeks, he burnt it. Fifty camel -riders were also despatched to trace them into the desert: these succeeded only in chiM r ! * Iowarail . known thieves, together with their wonLn children, &amp;c., and bringing them with fifty camels to Aboothabee The It was proposed (o Khaleefa bin ShaUboot in April 1842 to become a. d. 1842. olie of the subscribers to a truce, binding the each other hv 1 1 - ^ ^ mak ' mg agressions upon y and as well as by sea, during the pearl fishery a proposal which he no, only declined, but intimated !hat he was just ^ JOaSmeeS dUring lhe fiShinS most suited fo^success, in revenge for the checks and losses he had SUS , al ) . n T e ln s late fora ys. He had accordingly opened a negotiation with Muktoom of Debaye, who agreed to remain neutral. ' sent' Ms' cmisin^Svf W 'n T' ^ ^ 1842 ' sent nis cousin, Sjf b:n Dulmooj, to Khaleefa bin Shakboot who received and treated him with much kindness. His vepresentarions much gratified the Beniyas Chief that he was induced to depute in return, his relative, Viab bin Esai, to the Chief of Debave, to make a final settlement, and establish a lasting alliance. When the Aboothabee ambassador arrived at Debaye, tho Chief uktoom, considering it politic to invite Sultan bin Sa—ur and Snggur bin Sultan to join in the friendly relations about to tfe.tab hshed and being also afraid to enter into bonds of amity with Khaleefa without apprising these chiefs of his intentions, and in a measure obtaining their consent, sent a message to them, to ascertain eir wishes in regard to the proposed arrangement. They answered hat they would be very glad to be at peace with Khaleefa bin Shak boot, if that chieftain was sincere in wishing for peace. They therefore requested that Viab bin Esai should come to them; but on his arrtj tan bin Suggur having ascertained that the basis of any terms of P ace must be his abstaining from molesting the Imaum of Muskat, hb484 BENIYAS. cousin Syud Humood bin Azan, and their subjects, broke off the confer ence, and declined entering into the proposed league. The envoy then returned to Bebaye, and from thence to Aboothabee. A deputation now (March 1843) went from Debaye to Aboothabee, to invite and escort back the Beniyas Chief, a. d . 1843. j n hope that a personal interview between the chiefs might lead to a mutual understanding and settlement of disputes, and promote and confirm their reconciliation. A meeting took place in the fort, where Shaikh Khaleefa was received with all honours, and it was agreed, after the usual manner, that all differences should thenceforth be forgotten, and a lasting peace established be- tween them. These proceedings, as might have been anticipated, gave umbrage to the Joasmee Chieftains, who but ill concealed their disapprobation. Shaikh Muktoom declared them, however, necessary to his best interests, and offered his services as mediator for peace between them and his new ally, knowing full well at the same time that it would not, and in fact little intending that it should, prove effectual. Debaye being situated between the territories of the two great rival chieftains, good policy demanded that Shaikh Muktoom should use every endeavour to maintain the best possible terms with either, and yet a perfect neutrality in their endless quarrels. His adv^itage and inde pendence, indeed, depend upon their being inimical; for the balance of power would be with him who, reducing Debaye to subjection, secured, whether by force or conciliation, the resources of its inhabit ants to forward his own ends. Thus the choice of peace or war may in a manner be said to rest with Muktoom, the execution of whose threat to join his opponent is dreaded by either. In the course of the struggle for supremacy between the rival Chief tains of Bahrein, Sultan bin Sulameh came to Aboothabee as the envoy of Esai bin Tarif, to solicit, with most tempting offers, the assistance of the Beniyas Chief. Khaleefa, however, replied that he could not grant it without the permission of the British Government. Shortly after the visit of Khaleefa to Debaye, his brother. Sultan bin Shakboot, left Aboothabee with one hundred and fifty camel -riders, on a Chupao (plundering excursion). They attacked the Bern Kuttub (allies of the Joasmees), killed three men, and carried away seventy camels, and much property. They then plundered two Kafilas, one of which was bound from Brymee to Shargah, and robbed and killed three men of the Naeem Tribe. After an absence of seven days, they returned to Aboothabee with the loss of two men killed, and two wounded.BENIYAS. 485 A hollow treaty of peace on land was entered into in July 1843 bv t ie Joasrnee and Beniyas Chiefs, but immediate or temporary advan tage of however trifling a nature, being the only rule of action among rabs, it was not destined to have a longer existence than its predeces- sors. Khaleefa bin Shakboot, accompanied by a respectable force of horse and camel-men, principally of the tribes of Monasir and Moozareah, proceeded (August-September 1843) on a foray, and plundered the Beni Cuttub Ghuflah, and Naeem Bedouins, tribes in alliance with the Joas- mee Chief, the greater portion of whom were themselves absent on a upao on the Batinah Coast, of a great number of camels and sheep, anc much property. On their return, they also carried off a number of camels belonging to the same tribes, which had been sent for security o Zeit, in the immediate neighbourhood of Ras-ool-Khyma, and under the protection of its chief. Muktoom bin Butye of Debaye was supposed to have instigated this open rupture of the treaty of peace by land, which had so lately been formed. The remonstrances of Sultan bin Suggur, and his son Suggur, 1 evailed only so far as to draw forth promises of restoration of the ^be fulfiH d 6 Part ^ the BeniyaS ' Which were of course ne ver meant CONCLUSION, TO THE YEAR 1853, BY LIEUTENANT H.

Other tribes, too, did he manage to win over to his side,—indeed he appears to have conciliated the whole of the people he met with; for Syud Humood bin Azan, Chief of Sohar, quitted his territories, and repaired to Brymee to meet him ; Syud Kahtan bin Syf, the Governor of Shinas, hastened to wait upon him ; and with one and all was he said to have entered into a close and strict confederacy. While at Brymee, too, he invited Shaikh Muktoom of Debaye to go and join him, telling him he was anxious to settle the feuds existing between himself and the people of Ghuflah. The Debaye Chief, how ever, somewhat mistrustful of Khaleefa bin Shakboot's motives, politely declining the kind invitation he had received, on the plea of the expect ed arrival of a British vessel at his port, deputed his brother Syud bin Butye to proceed and wait upon him, instead of himself. In the month of December 1844, after Shaikh Khaleefa had returned to Aboothabee, an affair occurred that led to endless correspondence and trouble, which T will endeavour to describe in the fewest possible words. Shaikh Faris, the Chief of Chaab, at a time when all was peace and quiet, took it into his head, without the slightest provocation, and upon the frivolous pretext of a claim he possessed upon the Aboothabee Tribe of more than thirty years' standing, to seize and detain a Buteel belonging to the subjects of Shaikh Khaleefa bin Shakboot, that happen ed to touch at the port of Mohumrah. This aggression, as uncalled for as it was sudden, led to an appeal to the Resident by the Shaikh of Aboothabee, who begged that officer either to cause full reparation to be afforded him, or to permit him to proceed with his maritime forces against the presumptuous Shaikh Faris. The Resident, after inquiring into the particulars of the case, and finding that the Chaab Chief had acted in a most unjustifiable manner, addressed a communication to Shaikh Faris, pointing out to him the injustice of his behaviour, and advising him to release the Buteel, and everything appertaining to her. Shaikh Faris not only disregarded this appeal to his feelings, but expressed his intention to commit further injuries upon the people of Aboothabee, unless their chief chose to make good the claims he insist ed he had a full right to demand,—claims, it may here be observed, that not only referred to occurrences which transpired previous to Shaikh Khaleefa assuming the reins of government, but which, also, 'Weye found to have been forfeited by the course of subsequent events.beniyas.

The latter chief, as it should seem, had long meditated carrying this plan into effect; but, owing to a favourable opportunity not presenting itself, deferred its perpetration until a time when the town of Aboothabee was nearly denuded of inhabitants, who had gone for the most part to the date groves in the neighbouring districts ; then, considering the season had arrived for striking the blow, he repaired to meet the unsuspecting Shaikh Khaleefa and his brother on the beach, and after partaking of an entertainment that was spread under the shade of a Buteel, he rose, with his sons and other accom plices, and slew Shaikh Khaleefa and his brother. Having committed this dastardly act, he assumed the reins of government, summoned the heads of the tribes around, and was quickly acknowledged the chief of the place. Scarcely, however, had Esai bin Khalid been in power a couple of months, ere he, an assassin, was assassinated by one Zaab bin Esai, who, in his turn, fell a prey to the revenge of Khalid bin Esai, the son of the murdered Esai bin Khalid. The latter chief, who brought the scenes of bloodshed and murder to a close, did not attempt to usurp the authority he had managed to destroy, but ' left Aboothabee, and returned to Shargah after a slight skirmish with some people of the Beniyas.' His brother, however, contrived to get possession of the fort of Aboothabee, whence he was speedily ejected by the Beniyas, under the command of two influential leaders, named Mahomed bin Humeed and Rashid bin Fazil. These chiefs declared their intention to retain the authority they had gained until the arrival of Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon, who was con sidered the rightful heir to the chiefship, and had been invited to come and assume it. In due course Shaikh Syud arrived, and finding himself well received by the majority of the Beniyas Tribe, and also that he was supported by the Resident, who had been studiously watch ing the course of events, and now hastened to give all the moral aid in his power to ensure the establishment in authority of the lawful chief, he at once placed himself at the head of affairs, and was speedily recognised by the whole of the Beniyas as their true and rightful chief. Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon had not been long installed in his new position ere he received and accepted overtures to enter into an alliance, offensive and defensive, with the hereditary enemy of his tribe. Shaikh Saltan bin Suggur. How the Beniyas Chief was induced to listen to proposals of such a nature from one bearing the name of Joasmee it is hard to comprehend ; how he induced the people of his tribe to act in concert with those of Shaikh Sultan is more incomprehensible still, that he did so, however, is certain. The Beniyas and Joasmee Chiefs490 BENIYAS. all the troops they could summon—to agree to a peace, and to give back the forts he had so ably possessed himself of. The mode in which all these things were accomplished may be thus briefly related. Shaikh Syud invited Shaikh Syf bin Humood, the son of the Sohar Chief, as also the head of the Naeem Tribe, to enter into an alliance with himself. They did so, and made preparations to join him. Their aim and plan were one,—they resolved to crush and trample under foot the high-aspiring and boastful Wahabee. The Beniyas, impatient of delay, and calculating his own strength, ag well as the weakness of the enemy, determined to proceed to work at once, and not to wait the approach of his allies,—promptness of action was the chief thing needful. The minor lieutenants at all events could be fought and conquered, if not the great lieutenant himself. On the 4th of May accordingly did he, with his own troops, and a number of men from the Zowahir, Amayir, and other subordinate tribes, hasten to attack Shaikh Syf bin Ali, who held command of one of the Wahabee forts in the Zowahir country. Resistance was offered, but not with success : the fort, with all it contained, was quickly surrendered into the hands of Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon, who was wise enough to rest content with the laurels he had won, and to await the arrival of his expected allies ere venturing to beard the lion in his den at Brymee. These shortly arrived, and on the 16th of June operations commenced in good earnest against the stronghold of Brymee. The one, Soo- bauh, was occupied by Mahomed bin Syfut Ujajee in person, and after a cannonade of two days' duration was compelled to surrender. Ma homed bin Syf, however, was not to be found ; he had deserted his followers, and, unknown to all the soldiers in the fort, he, the chief of the place, had fled in the dead of night, and sought refuge among the troops in the adjoining and only remaining fort of Khunduk, which, so confounded were the Wahabees at the activity displayed by the enemy, so disheartened at the fall of Soobauh, and the ignominious flight of its commander, they did not attempt to retain. The fort was vacated, and handed over, together with the horses and property therein contained, to Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon, who permitted the vanquished Nujdees to quit the place without being harmed or molested. These w r ere great and heroic exploits no doubt,—'sweet to Shaik i Syud, but bitter to the Wahabee, and equally bitter to the rest of the maritime chiefs, who, though inwardly abhorring the latter, viewed with still more abhorrence the growing power of the former. A coalition was formed against the Beniyas,—he who had forcibly ejected the Nudjees was in his turn to be forcibly cast out from Brymee. Sue a plan was in course of formation, and such a plan, had not dissensions and jealousies arisen amongst the allied parties, might well, peihapfjBENIYAS. 491 have succeeded, for the son of the Sohar Chief, owing to a misunder standing between himself and the Beniyas, was suddenly expelled the fort of Brymee, and thus was Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon left to contend single-handed against the formidable league about to be arranged against him. No way daunted, however, and fearful for nothino-, he proved for a length of time more than a match for the whole of his enemies. He fought and shamefully discomfited a considerable Nuidee force that was sent to annihilate him; he forced the proud and not U , nS . ' yu f, Mootluk to flee for protection to Shargah; he showed himself ready to confront the combined forces of the Nuidee Joasmee, Debaye, and Ejman Chiefs; he experienced but one reverse' and that but a slight one ; when, finding he was not likely to receive' the succours promised by the Muskat Government, he gave ear to the voice of a mediator, who had been sent by the Sherreeff of Mecca to conciliate the contending parties. A peace was concluded in February 1S49, by the terms of which a, d. 1849. ' 1,16 Bl 'y m ee forts were restored to Syud bin . Mootluk, all that had passed was to be buried M°um™ n ' and a11 PaltieS Were ,0 retU1 ' n t0 the Judging from the subsequent movements of Shaikh Syud, however It does not appear that he had any intention of remaining satisfied with the settlement that had thus been effected. Peace, it is true, was concluded; but Ins visit to Shinas and Muskat, which occurred some few months later in the season, was supposed to have been for the sole purpose of conferring with Syf bin Kahtan and His Excellency Syud owcynee on t ie subject of what could be done against the Wahabees. The plans that were concerted, the complications that ensued,# and the result of those plans and complications, will be learned in the sequel Before prosecuting, however, this part of the narrative, it is necessary that we should accompany Shaikh Syud home to Aboothabee, and watch his proceedings on arrival. The year had well nigh drawn to a close when Shaikh Syud reached ns seat, and found, to his great disgust, that 'on the termination of the pearl fisher y. al1 the boats of the Gubeysat Tribe, that should have returned to Aboothabee in October, had proceeded to the Guttur Coast and sought an asylum at Biddah.' ' The Gubeysat Tribe originally dwelt at Aboothabee, and there continued to reside until the year 1836, when the piratical acts of t ie subjects of the Beniyas Chief leading the British Government to demand payment of considerable sums of money, by way of compel others!' 6 COmpl ' Cat ■ 0n, are ' Jetalled My in the Sketch of Muskat than in any of tll e G4492 BENIYAS. tion to the injured parties, they seceded, and located themselves at Adeed, ' a town situated in a backwater between Bahrein and Aboo- thabee,' and considered by the inhabitants to be quite inaccessible to our vessels of war.' In this, however, they were sadly misktaken ; for they had scarcely taken up'their position, and commenced indulging in piracy, ere Major Hennell proceeded with the squadron of the Gulf, in command of Com modore Lowe, and exacted full satisfaction for past offences. In the following year (1837) they were again disturbed by Shaikh Khaleefa bin Shakboot, then Chief of the Aboothabee Tribe, who attacked them in their den, and completely demolished the place. The greater portion of the Gubeysat members, now scattered and powerless,'were induced to go and reside once more at Aboothabee, where they remained until the present year (1849), when, partly from the dissatisfaction with which they viewed the friendly demeanour of Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon towards the people of the Moharibah, a tribe at feud with themselves, and partly owing to the intrigues of Shaikh Sultan and Shaikh Muktoom bin Butye, who assured them Bin Saood would shortly send a force to rebuild Adeed, and re-locate them therein, they were led to adopt the course of proceeding to Biddah. The intrigues of his enemies, the cause of the secession, and the mischief likely to emanate therefrom, all these things were perceived at a glance by the discerning Shaikh Syud. He resolved (November -December 1849) to nip the evil in the bud, and by promptness of action to crush the disaffected spirit of the offending members. The measures he adopted bore the impress of his wonted energy ; but were far removed from the uprightness and honesty of spirit that had hitherto been the principal characteristics of his dealings with others. He seized the heads and rulers of the tribes still left in Aboothabee, and cast them into prison ; he deputed a messenger to induce the leaders to returft to their homes ; he received and welcomed them, on re turn, with marks of the utmost kindness and respect ; he gave them every reason to believe that past offences were forgiven, and forgotten,—that they were no longer labouring under the displeasure of their Chief;— in short, he succeeded in lulling them into a state of unsuspecting security. What, then, must have been their surprise, when the day succeeding their arrival dawned upon them, to awake and find their boats had been stripped in the night of sails, masts, and rudders, and that means of escape had been snatched from their hands; to find orders had been issued to the people of Aboothabee that all parties possessing claims upon the Gubeysat Tribe were to enforce immediate payment; that a fine of no less than 2,000 dollars was inflicted upon them ;—inBENIYAS. 493 fine, to perceive that they had been ensnared by one whom they never suspected of deceit. The position they were in was a painful one : they were driven to the greatest straits, and so much pressed for payment of the money demanded, that they had no resource but to dispose of their boats and all the goods they possessed. We now revert to the proceedings of Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon and His Excellency Syud Soweynee, .They entered into a strict alliance, and set on foot preparations for acting offensively against the Wahabee Lieutenant in Oman. Such at least was the ostensible reason for which they united, and such, too, was the leal and sole desire of the Beniyas Chief, who was anxiously long- ing foi an opportunity to drive the Nujdees at the point of the sword once more from their position of Brymee. His Excellency, however, had many plans in contemplation : he wished to oppose the ambitious designs of the Joasmees against Khore Fukaun, and his other posses sions on the Batinah Coast; he was anxious to persuade, or, failing persuasion to compel, the Sohar Chief to coalesce with himself, and the Beniyas. All these matters have been so fully discussed in the Sketch of the Muskat Tribe that to repeat them here is unnecessary. The fust mention we find of the despatch of troops by the Beniyas a. d 1850 Chief in the direction of the Wahabee position is in the month of March 1850, when il four hundred men of the Beniyas and Monasir Tribes joined His Excellency Syud Soweynee at Shinas, having been sent by Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon, under the command of his cousin, Mahomed bin Syf, and Fazil bin Mahomed. As to Shaikh Syud himself, he proceeded with a large force to the immediate vicinity of Brymee, and commenced destroying the water courses that irrigated the date trees around. Meanwhile, the combined forces of the Joasmee, Debaye, Ejman, and Amulgavine Chiefs arrived on the spot, and, luckily for Shaikh Syud, perhaps, the ends and aims of the allies were opposed the one to the other,—no two of their number had wishes alike: the Joasmee had in his mind ambitious expectations of aggrandisement on the Batinah Coast; Shaikh Muktoom possessed but one desire, that of expelling Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon from the Brymee territories ; the minor Chiefs of Ejman and Amulgavine, whose contingents were small compared with the rest, appear to have had no fixed purpose or object whatever;—in short, after some discussion, and not a little hesitation, the Joasmee counsels prevailed, and a move was made in the direction of Sohar, when commenced the operations against the fort of Shinas and others that have been so fully recounted in the Muskat history. The exact course pursued by the Beniyas after the departure of I he494 BENIYAS. allies is not known. He would seem, however, after perpetrating all man ner of mischief on the plantations and country adjacent to Brymee, to have gone back to Aboothabee, and there to have remained for a while, when he again returned to Brymee, and amused himself foraying the districts of Shargah and Ras-ool-Khyma, and engaging in skirmishes with Mahomed bin Abdoolla and the tribe of the Naeem A1 Boo Kheriban. He does not appear to have afforded active support to His Excellency Syud Soweynee against the Joasmee confederacy; and as regards the subsequent aggressions upon the Brymee territories, with which we are more immediately concerned, no further mention is made of the subject until the month of November 1850, when we find the Joasmee, Beniyas, and Naeem Chiefs acting in concert against the Nujdee garrison at Brymee. The years 1849 and 1850 were noted for the number of disputes that occurred between the people of Aboothabee and those of Debaye, regarding the seizure and counter-seizure of slaves from boats at sea. These were all satisfactorily settled through the endeavours of Colonel Hennell, and the remonstrances he addressed to the chiefs of the respective tribes. In the autumn of 1850 a gross violation of the Maritime Truce was made by the subjects of the Beniyas Chief, who seized upon a boat of Himreeah, and killed two of the crew on board of her. The vessels of war were despatched to demand satisfaction from Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon, in the shape of the payment of 600 dollars, the sum required as the Deeah or price of blood for the two Joasmees slain, and the surrender of the captured Himreeah boat, with the stores pertaining to her. The boldness displayed by Lieutenant Manners, in command of the Tigris, as also by Lieutenant Tronson, of the Euphrates, in taking their vessels through the intricate channel that leads for upwards of three miles to the inner harbour of the port of Aboothabee, thereby bringing them within effective gunshot range of both the town and the native craft on the beach, somewhat astonished Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon, who had never before beheld a British cruiser so close to his home, and led him to comply w ith the requisition preferred against him without hesitation or demur. The 600 dollars were paid in October 1850, and the boat and stores surrendered so soon as demanded. A few words will suffice to relate the proceedings of Shaikh Syud bin a. d . 1851. Tahnoon in the year 1851. He concluded a peace with Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, notwith- standing the intrigues set on foot by Shaikh Muktoom to prevent it; e proeeeded to the assistance of the Bahrein Shaikhs in their struggle 1th the Wahabee ruler, and through his good offices it was thatBENIYAS. 495 matters were brought to an amieable settlement in July between the e igerent parties; and finally, in the operations carried on by His Highness the Imaum of Muskat and the Shaikh of Debaye, against the ill-starred Syud Ghes, the Chief of Sohar, the part sustained by Shaikh honesty 111 10011 WaS selfish ' and savoured rather of duplicity than The next occurrence worthy of notice connected with this tribe is a a. d. 1852. Case of marit ime irregularity that took place t . l earl y in the s P ri ng of 1852, which would seem to have been committed by order of Shaikh Syud himself. The circumstances attending the affair were these On the 31st of March 1852 a person called Obed bin Butya, an inhabitant of Debaye called upon Hajee Yacoob, the British Agent at Shargah, and informed him that, having a boat which he was desirous to sell, he had embarked in her for Biddah with this object, and that after disposing of her there he had embarked on board a Buggalow, belonging to Zaal, of the' cmyas Tribe, located at Biddah, in order to return to his home When they arrived opposite Aboothabee, so near as to discern the place, a Buggarah came out by order of Syud bin Tahnoon, and seized the boat and conveyed her into that port, when they hauled her on shore, and appropriated to themselves whatever was in her From the people of Debaye they took two slaves, five Kerans, two' Abbas, and an Arab head-dress, releasing four men who belonged to that place and sending them away in a Buggarah ; but they detained two of ^the' crew belonging to Biddah, whose slaves they also took. Syud bin Tah noon observed to the people of the boat that he had received orders from Ameer Fysul bin Saood to seize all Beniyas vessels he might find at sea, unless they returned to Aboothabee. The crew of the boat that issued from Aboothabee consisted of twenty- nve men, ^ A letter of remonstrance was addressed to the Beniyas Chief, calling- upon him to afford redress for so open a case of infraction of the Maritime Truce, and desiring the immediate restitution of all the pro perty and individuals that had been so unlawfully seized. Commodore Robinson followed in the wake of the letter, with a view, in the event of contumacy being displayed by the delinquent chief, ' to give weight bv his presence to the requisition preferred against him, and to warn him o the consequences which must ensue from such a wilful disregard of his engagements with the British Government.' Such were the steps adopted to bring Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon to account, and nothing could exceed the readiness exhibited by him to obey the Resident's instructions. Before the arrival of the Commodore, immediately on receipt of Captain Kcmball's letter, he despatched a special messenger496 BENIYAS. to Hajee Yacoob, for the purpose of handing back the property plunder ed, and of intimating his intention to restore the slaves he had taken so soon as they returned from the pearl banks. But two more points remain to be noticed ere we draw this Sketch to a close. Towards the end of the year 1852 the Beniyas Chief espoused the cause of Shaikh Syud bin Butye, the new Shaikh of Debaye, whose right to the chiefship being, disputed by the sons of the late Shaikh Muktoom, his brother, had led to the latter fleeing for protection to Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, and craving his assistance towards regaining the seat they had so lately won, but been unable to retain. In the spring of the ensuing year, on the occasion of the advent to a. d. 1853. Brymee of Abdoolla bin Fysul, with a consider able Nujdee force, the course pursued by Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon was diametrically opposed to that of the Joasmee. Finding that the latter was doing all in his power to induce the Ameer's son to invade the districts of Batinah, he at once expressed his strong disapproval of the proposed plan, by dismissing to their homes the larger portion of his followers, and begging, if the expedi tion were finally determined on, to be permitted to withdraw. The measures adopted by the Resident, coupled with the above show of opposition, and the assumption of a hostile attitude by His Excellency Syud Soweynee, dictated to Abdoolla bin Fysul the advisa- bility, if not the necessity, of abandoning the project of an attack on the maum s teiritories, and satisfying himself with demands for payment of an increased amount of tribute. When matters had been brought to a settlement, Shaikh Syud bin a noon returned, to Aboothabee to wait upon the Resident, who was o t lat port on his toui of the Gulf, and on arrival he subscribed to the new Treaty of Peace* (May 4th, 1853) concluded by the Ma- '' lme Chlefs of 0man &gt; for a complete cessation of hostilities for ever at sea. * Vide pages 88 and 89 of this Selection.HISTOEICAL SKETCH OF THE BOO FELASA TRIBE OF AKABS.

T he secession of the Boo Felasa branch, under Obed bin Syud and a. d. 1834 Muktoom bin Butye, from the body of the Beni- yas Iribe at Aboothabee, in which originated the war between the latter and the Joasmees; its settlement at Debaye, and existence thenceforth in virtual independence! require that its subsequent history and proceedings should be separately treated, as being totally unconnected with that of the main tribe, with which it was frequently engaged in hostilities. Suddenly freed from the control of a firm and vigorous chief, on the establishment of peace between the great lival tribes, parties of the Boo Felasa commenced depreda tions upon the general trade of the Gulf, and had committed the acts of piracy below detailed before measures could be taken to check them :— ^ le plunder of a Nabend Buteel by the Debaye fleet, ^ncl. The attack and plunder of a Muskat vessel, and murder of five of the crew, by a Debaye boat, under the command of Abdool Mowajea, having with him twelve men. 3^. I he plunder of a village on the Coast of Batinah, not far from i uskat, and the attack and plunder of a Nabend Buggarah by a Debaye boat, under Syf binDulmooj. Ath. The attack and seizure of a boat belonging to Bahrein, by a boat under the command of Abdoolla bin Buddur, inhabitant of Debaye. In the last case, the Chief of Bahrein adopted his own means of obtaining redress ; and placing an embargo on all Debaye boats present at the time in that harbour, further compelled a merchant of that town, ien on the island, to pay to the injured party the sum of 300 dollars in ot the amount plundered by his countrymen. v . J n ^ c e*sity for interference on our part in the first case was also nertv i i ^ V 6 re ^ ease ^ le Nakhoda, and the restoration of the pro- 1 erty taken from his vessel. With reference to the second and third,65 BOO FELASA, 499 however, Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur having disclaimed the possession of any control or authority over Debaye, and remonstrances having failed to bring the Shaikh of that town to afford ample reparation, it became requisite to resort to demonstrations of force, and threats of coercive measuies, which had the desired effect, and secured the payment of 920 dollars, the amount of the value of the property plundered. The death of Obed bin Syud, the principal, on the 9th June, left the a. d. 1836. supreme and undivided authority at Debaye in the hands of Muktoom bin Butye, a young, haughty, and inexperienced character. From the date of the secession of the tribe, and its defeat in the attack on Aboothabee, when co-operating with the Joasmees, it had not failed to offer every annoyance to the Beniyas Chief, by offering asylum to his discontented subjects, and shelter to his enemies, as well as occasionally plundering his boats. The latter, fully alive to the injuries thus inflicted upon him, was only a. d 1838 waiting his opportunity to retaliate. During the year 1888 he succeeded in surprising and captur ing the sea tower of Debaye, but was very shortly compelled to vacate it. Early in the year, a piracy was committed by a Debaye Buggarah upon one belonging to Khaboora. The former, having on board a Nakhoda and eight men, proceeded to Khassa, and thence to the Batinah Coast, on its way to Muskat. When off Burka, observing a anchor, the crew waited until night, and attacked her, with the intention of plundering. Her crew, however, were on the aleit, and offered resistance, until six of their number having been wounded, the remaining three jumped into the sea. These were afteiwards permitted to regain their vessel, but two of the wounded having subsequently died, the aggressors were, through their Chief Muktoom, called upon to pay the Deeah, or price of blood, and to make good the property plundered. An individual named Bin Asker, one of the Gubeysat Tribe (that a. d. 1840 seceded to Adeed, but was subsequently compelled by its Shaikh, Khaleefa bin Shakboot, to return to Aboothabee), upon whom that chief's brother had claims for money advanced previous to his going to the pearl banks, quitting A boothabee, plundered on his way two Buggarahs belonging to the Beniyas Tribe, of pearls to a large amount, and took refuge at Debaye, the chief of which place granted him asylum. He was, however, called upon to surrender Bin Asker to his own chief, and to pay the sum of 200 dollars as the value of the property subsequently plundered by his dependents from the three Aboothabee boats in Belor Shat's affair,* a * Vide page 482 of this Selection.500 BOO FELASA. reparation which he persisted in refusing to afford, until coercion was employed. He however compelled the return of twenty of the Gubeysat Tribe who had accompanied Bin Asker. The Debaye Bug- garah, in which these were sent, landed them on the coast near Aboo- thabee, without provisions, and stripped of their arms. As they were proceeding towards Aboothabce, they observed a Debaye Buggarah fishing near the shore, and going on board, seized her in retaliation and prosecuted their journey by sea. Their chief, however, on their arrival at Aboothabee, deprived them of their capture, and sent it to the British Agent at Shargah, with a request that it might be delivered over to the Chief of Debaye, who however in the first instance refused to receive it, his object being really to have it in his power to ur^e some cause of complaint to the Resident against the Beniyas. a j 11 1 ' etaliation for a fora y u P on the cattle of Debaye made by the Aboothabee men, under the personal command of their chief, some men of the former, joined by about twenty Bedouins, commenced to search the Beniyas creeks, but finding nothing, a portion of the.r number embarked in a small Buggarah, and discovering one e ongmg to Aboothabee, at a place called Inzeerah Sadiat, with three slaves m her belonging to the chief of the former place, engaged in cutting wood, seized the slaves, and whatever propertv was in the Buggarah ; then, breaking herup, returned to their homes.

This occurred at a time, too, when a division had arisen among the Debaye people, which had led to the secession of five hundred of the Boo Muhair to Shargah, owing to their disgust at Muktoom's usurped and severe authority,—an occurrence which afforded unfeigned satis faction and delight to the Joasmee Chief, as diminishing the power and influence of one whose former encouragement and support of his son when in open rebellion, still evidently rankled in his breast. The absence of the Debaye people from their tower, the only guard left therein being twenty-five men from the Persian Coast, and the men of the tribe being themselves for the most part engaged in the pearl fishery, afforded to Shaikh Khaleefa bin Shakboot a further opportunity of prosecuting his revenge upon the Boo Felasa. Having made up matters with the Beni Kuttub and other inland tribes, and secured him self from any opposition on their part, the Beniyas Chief issued secretly from Aboothabee, with a party of one hundred and fifty men, for Debaye, which he reached in two days. After doing much injury to the date groves, the party succeeded in surprising and gaining possession of the town and fort, plundered the market and houses, and burned all the stores of rice and 4 dates that could be found, as also the Buteel* which had been presented to Shaikh Muktoom by the Chief of Bahrein, killing two men who happened to be on board. Muktoom, immediately on gaining intelligence of the above, solicited the aid of Shaikh Suggur bin Sultan of Shargah, who joined him with two hundred men, but too late to be of any avail, for the Beniyas, after having done all the mischief in their power, had left the place, and taken up their position at Joomeerah, distant about eight miles from Debaye. Not yet satisfied with the very serious blow inflicted at Debaye, Khaleefa bin Shakboot a few days subsequently sent out a foraying paity, which surprised Khan (a village on the coast between Debaye and Shargah), and completely stripped the place, carrying off fifteen slaves, without any loss to themselves. The presence of this courageous and energetic chief greatly harassed and annoyed the fehargah and Debaye people, keeping them constantly on the watch ; for nearly all the male inhabitants, having proceeded to the fishing, had left their territories in an almost defenceless state. Reinforcements were sent to Shargah from Ras-ool-Khyma and Lingah, upon which the Beniyas Chief returned to Aboothabee, but shortly again set forth * This Buteel was originally the property of Esai bin Tarif, but was confiscated on his seceding with his tribe from Bahrein.502 BOO FELASA. upon plundering excursions into the Brymee country, and on his return secretly left Khuttum with four hundred followers, with the intention of making a night attack upon these two places (Shargah and Debave) but his object being betrayed, he was compelled to relinquish the design, and proceeded in the direction of Ras -ool -Khyma He*&gt; however, he found Shaikh Sultan prepared to receive him, and was therefore unable to inflict any serious injury. After killing four and wounding two men of the Joasmees, he was obliged to retreat, with the loss of three men killed and his own riding camel, with accoutrements, which fell into the hands of the enemy.* CONTINUATION TO THE YEAR 1853, BY LIEUTENANT H.

This act was not in any way coun tenanced by Shaikh Muktoom bin Butye ; far from it,—he inflicted punishment upon his offending subjects ; caused whatever had been taken from Shaikh Sultan's people to be restored to them ; and went so far as of his own free will to bind over the delinquents to keep the peace, by making them lodge in the hands of the British Agent the sum of 100 crowns, as security for their future good behaviour. A striking proof was this of the well working of the system in operation for the suppression of piracy ; for it was Shaikh Muktoom bin Butye who m former years gave as much if not more trouble to the British representative than any one of the maritime chiefs, by the open manner in which he encouraged a spirit of maritime irregularity. From the commencement of 1845 to the close of the ensuing year a. d. 1845-46. the Joasmee and Aboothabee Chiefs did all in their power to reduce the Shaikh of Debaye to a state of submission. Shaikh Muktoom bin Butye, and his staunch and faithful ally the Chief of Amulgavine, proved, however, more than a match for their formidable adversaries : they successfully defended themselves against all the attacks, both foul and fair, that were made upon their territories, and at Ae close of 1846, when a last and tre mendous attack was about to be directed on the fort of Debaye, a quarrel arose between the two allied chiefs, each of whom suddenly shifting his policy, preferred overtures of peace to the common foe, a. d. 1847. Shaikh Muktoom bin Butye, who entered into an alliance offensive and defensive with Shaikh Sul tan bin Suggur, but refused the advances of Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon. When we commenced our narrative, the Beniyas and Joasmee Chiefs were in the thick of contentions; then came the Shaikh of Debaye, who by joining the former offended the latter ; presently the Beniyas and Joasmees entered into an alliance offensive and defensive, and attacked the Shaikh of Debaye ; and now we find the Debaye and Joasmees acting in concert, and the Beniyas at enmity with either. The last arrangement, however, though scarcely more than nominal a. d. 1848. ol ^ se ^ remained unbroken until the month of July 1848, when a truly close and intimate alliance was entered into between the two (Debaye and Joasmee), for the purpose of opposing the plans of aggrandisement which the now all powerful Chief of the Beniyas seemed to entertain in the direction of their respective territories. Shaikh Muktoom, fearing an attack upon Debaye, found it to his in terest to remain in league with Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, who on his Side, too, trembled for the safety of his possessions on the Batinah504 BOO FELASA. Coast. It was clearly, therefore, fear and apprehension alone that drove these chiefs to unite, and grow, as it were, into one, for much jealousy , had been of late displayed by either. They combined, however and strove in union well together. The two chiefs were shortly joined by the Shaikh of Ejman, and when the Wahabee forces had been defeated, and the Beniyas had reached the zenith of his power, the three chiefs espoused the cause of the fallen Syud bin Mootluk, and repaired to Brymee, for the purpose of ejecting therefrom Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon. A number of skirmishes followed, in the immediate vicinity of the a. d. 1849. forts; but owing to the arrival of a mediator in February 1849, and the acceptance of peace by the belligerent parties, the whole of the chiefs returned to their seat/ and hostilities ceased. ' Shaikh Muktoom still kept up a friendly intercourse with the Joas- mees; and both chiefs, especially the former, strongly advised Ameer ysul in November 1849 to rebuild the town and fort of Adeed and to replace therein the people of the Gubeysat Tribe.

The envoy had scarcely placed foot on the soil of Debaye ere Shaikh Muktoom became aware of the important documents he held in his ands. Moobaruk was seized, and thrown into confinement; a plain and distinct intimation was sent to Shaikh Sultan, that if he Wished to keep on good terms with the Debaye Chief, then mn S t he neither per mit the letters nor the envoy to go to Aboothabee. Shaikh Sultan, unwilling to break with Shaikh Muktoom, but more unwilling to remain at feud with Shaikh Syud, did not boldly and manfully declare his determination to make peace with the Beniyas rether Muktoom wished it or no, but resorted, to effect his object, to his usual mode of duplicity. J ' He feigned compliance with the desires of the Debaye Chief, by despatching his Secretary, Mahomed bin All Boo Shelabee, to bring back the etters he had sent, and so soon as he returned to Shargah h^ forwarded the identical documents in charge of a man of the Aboo Heyle straight to Shaikh Syud at Aboothabee. The result of the affair was that peace was concluded between the Joasmee and Beniyas Chiefs, and Shaikh Mnktoom, fearful for him Jf drew more closely to the Wahabees. The time was now at hand for the arrival of His Highness the maum from his possessions at Zanzibar, on the African Coast. He had long talked of repairing to Muskat, for the purpose of adjusting and arranging the quarrel that had been so unhappily raging betweef his son and the Sohar Chief. etween Shaikh Muktoom, enraged with the Joasmee for the alliance he had a. d. 1852. ately contracted, and thinking the moment M , , .... , favourable f&lt;'- cultivating the friendship of the Muskat authorities, deputed his brother on a friendly mission to Syud506 BOO FELASA. Soweynee, and eventually, when His Highness arrived, and commenced operations against the Sohar Chief, he afforded him active support and remained in union until the spring of the succeeding year, when while on his way from Muskat to the island of Kishm, he was seized with an attack of small-pox, which carried him off' before he reached the end of his journey. There was much of good in Shaikh Muktoom : he was a chief of undoubted bravery and ability ; he was also, so far as we are able to judge, as much esteemed and beloved by the people of his tribe as any one of the maritime chiefs; and, as regards the fulfilment of engage ments with the British Government, T cannot do better, I think, than quote the opinion expressed by Captain Kemball in one of his letters to Government regarding him ' Shaikh Muktoom,' he tells us, ' though manifesting on his first establishment at Debaye a refractory spirit, which led to the adoption of coercive measures towards him, had at least for the past ten years been distinguished among the chiefs of the coast for the general observ- ance of his engagements, and apprehending clearly the policy of the British Government as conducive to the advancement and prosperity of the Arab States, for the earnestness of his endeavours in support of its arrangements to preserve the maritime tranquillity of the Gulf.' Shaikh Muktoom was succeeded by his brother Shaikh Syud bin Butye in the Chiefship. ^ Shortly after assuming the reins of government. Shaikh Syud bin Butye (on the 2nd October 1852) repaired to Muskat, on a visit to His Highness Syud Saeed. His departure at so early a season, before he was firmly seated in his new position, was scarcely prudent or wise; for he must have been well aware that there were aspirants to the chief- k . ip he held, eagcily seeking an opportunity to take to themselves w at t icy looked upon as their hereditary right. We find, accordingly, tiat ^ud bin Lut^ye had barely left his seat ere ' the sons of the late uktoora, by name Soheil and Husher, with their maternal uncle Majid in u mooj, and some of the A1 Boo Felasa, surprised the fort of f . a \ e ' w ^ ose garrison acted treacherously and had an understanding wi t em, and they took the fort, seizing the guardian appointed by m i + 111 ut ^ e ' ^ name Syud bin Rashid, the maternal uncle of u ,oora, who was asleep, and whom they placed in confinement, toge- ther wuh another person, named Khaleefa bin Saeed.'

The measures he adopted were crowned with success : Soheil and Husher were compelled to quit the place, and to flee for protection to Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur. Such was the posture of affairs when Syud bin Butye returned to his seat at Debaye. He perceived at a glance the enormity of the evil existing; he saw how much it was likely to increase, now that the Joasmee had mixed himself up in the quarrel. Nor was he mis- taken. Shaikh Sultan was busy intriguing in every manner and shape : he had already induced one Syud bin Maanaul Moheyree, by tempting offers in gold, to quit Debaye with his tribe, and to go and settle at Shargah ; and it is difficult to say how matters would have ended had not Syud bin Butye made advances to Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon that resulted in an alliance, offensive and defensive, between the two chiefs, who were likewise joined by the Shaikh of Amulgavine, thereby forming a coalition too strong for the Joasmee to dream of opposing it. Nothing of importance connected with this tribe occurred from this a. d . 1853. period un1il the s P rin g of 1B58, when Captain Kemball proceeded on a tour of the Gulf, for the purpose of arranging matters connected with the Perpetual Treaty of Peace 1 * to be entered into by the maritime chiefs. It is not unworthy of notiee that Shaikh Syud bin Butye alone of their number failed to wait upon Abdoolla bin Fysul on the occasion of his arrival at Brymee with a Nujdee Force,!—he only remained at his post; and from the tenor of a conversation held by him with the Resident on board the Honorable Company's sloop of war Ctive, off the port of Shargah, may be gathered how extremely averse he was, or affected to be, to the presence of a Wahabee force in the province of Oman. From the promptitude displayed by Shaikh Syud bin Butye in re pressing maritime irregularities whensoever committed by his depend ents, and from the readiness he showed to subscribe to the new treaty of peace, it is plain that he was anxious to cultivate the good will and friendship of the British Government in the same degree as had been done by Shaikh Muktoom, his brother, before him. * Vide page 88 of this Selection. t Syud bin Butye deputed his maternal uncle to Brymee, in his stead. (iGHISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE TRIBE OF EJMAN, FROM THE YEAR 1820 TO 184J, prepared by LIEUTENANT A. B. KEMBALL; WITH CONTINUATION FROM THE LATTER PERIOD TO THE YEAR 1853, BY LIEUTENANT H. F. DISBROWE; successive assistants to the resident in the persian gulf.r i ,310 EJMAN. A t the date of the General Treaty for the Suppression of Piracy in a. d. 1820. . this Gulf ' coricl ' de d by Sir William Grant Keir in IS20, the port of Ejman would appear to have been considered a dependency of the Shaikh of Shargah, having been included in a treaty with that chief for the surrender of the towers guns, and vessels of certain places therein enumerated. So shortly subsequent, however, as the beginning of 1823, Rashid a. d. 1823. bin Humee(1 of Ejman addressed a letter to the Resident, complaining of the aggressions com mitted against him by Sultan bin Suggur, and declaring that he never would submit to his authority. An attempt on the part of the latter chief to induce the Resident, while on a visit to Shargah in the same year, to recognise his supremacy, by showing him a paper signed by several of the Shaikhs in that neighbourhood, in which they acknow- e ged their dependence upon him, would allow also of a supposition that his jurisdiction was not altogether undisputed. On the othci hand, in a case of piracy committed upon two Debaye a. d. 1827. boals by a sub j ec t of Rashid bin Hurneed in 1827, , , a rem onstrance addressed to Sultan bin Suggur occasioned the offender, with two of his followers, to be placed in con- finement, without any objection being raised on the subject of his responsibility, or right of interference.

Alluding to this interview, Shaikh Rashid himself, in a letter to the a. d 1831 Resident, dated in 1S31, speaks of the pacific views ot Poor key bin Saood in terms of the highest praise, and takes credit for exertions to establish a good under standing between the British Government and the Wahabee Chief, from whom he procured a letter to the address of the Governor of Bombay. No belief, however, was placed in his sincerity, there being little doubt that his real intentions were to excite hostility and disturbance,* and to obtain a Sanction for the renewal of the former system of indiscriminate aggression and piracy. Shaikh Rashid bin Humeed died, and was a. d . 1838. succeeded in the authority over Ejman by his son Humeed. Shaikh Abdool Azeez, the elder brother of Shaikh Humeed bin A D 1841 Rashid (the acknowledged chief), contrived with his slaves to effect, in May 1841, an entrance into the fort of Ejman, and, being secretly supported by the greater part of the inhabitants, to maintain his position : nor did Shaikh Sultan bin S u §'&amp; ur 5 though the father-in-law of Humeed, exercise any interference, but treated the affair entirely as a family quarrel. Shaikh Abdool Azeez, however, alarmed at the preparations making by his deposed brother to erect another fort in the neighbourhood, deemed it advisable to restore him to his former authority, until abetter opportunity should offer to forward his object. He has since succeeded in supplanting him, and is now the acknow ledged ruler of Ejman. continuation to the year 1853, BY LIEUTENANT H. F. DISBROWE. Taking up the history of this tribe in continuation of Captain Kern- a. d . 1844. ball ' S Historical Sketches, the first occurrence worthy of notice is that of a collision, in Septem ber 1844, between two boats on the pearl banks, the one belonging to Shaigah, the other to Ejman. In this case the people of the Joasmees were decidedly the aggressors. Such acts and proceedings of the tribe occupying Ejman as are worthy of notice, or mixed up with the Policy of the British Government, are recorded in the Sketch of the Joasmee Tribe. (Vide page 329 of this Selection.)512 EJMAN. 'One Esai bin Jassim, an inhabitant of Shargah,' to quote the words of the British Agent, 'with a number of pearl boats belonging to that tribe, were anchored among those pertaining to other tribes. By chance the Buggarah of one Syf, a native of Ejman, was engaged in the pearl fishery near that of the abovementioned Esai bin Jassim, when a mis understanding took place between them on the subject of the cables of their anchors. It was at first confined to talking and abuse, but Esai bin Jassim shortly after fired a matchlock at the Ejman Buggarah, and then boarded her, thrust a spear into the body of one of the crew, and struck another three blows on the head with an iron mace. 'The Ejman people did not resort to arms, but flung themselves into the sea, and were eventually picked up by pearl divers of their own tribe, and conveyed home in their boats.' This matter, when it came to the ears of the Resident, was at once taken up by that officer, who wrote to Shaikh Abdool Azeez, asking him whether he wished the case to be settled according to Mahomedan law, or would prefer its being treated by the British authorities as one of violation of the Maritime Truce. The reply of the Ejman Chief leaving the adjustment of the affair in the hands of the Resident, demands were immediately made upon Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur for redress, in the shape of 200 dollars, which sum Esai bin Jassim was to be compelled to disburse, as com pensation to the wounded Ejmanee. Ihe vessels of war were despatched to Ras-ool-Khyma and Shargah, to support the requisition, and a communication was addressed to the Chief of the Joasmees, acquainting him with the object of their visit. No hesitation was exhibited by Shaikh Sultan to comply with the de mand preferred against him; on the contrary, he hastened (December 1844) to furnish an order for the amount required at the hands of his lawless subject, and brought the matter to a peaceable settlement. About this time, also, took place ap affair reflecting the greatest credit upon the character of the chief of this tribe. ^ Two vessels, having embarked a quantity of rice at Lingah, on the oth December 1844, proceeded over to Shargah, but being caught in a storm, and unable to make the port in consequence, they strove to enter the backwater leading into Ejman harbour. One vessel foundered in making the attempt; the other, however, after getting iid of 100 moras of her cargo, succeeded in reaching the inner harbour. Shaikh Abdool Azeez, hearing what had occurred, hastened down a. d. 1845. t0 the beach, accompanied by his brother, and both of them, drawing their swords, swore a emn oath that they would cut down the first man who daredEJMAN. 513 to approach the boat, or lay hands on the rice. After a while, the owners of the cargo, apprised of what had befallen their vessels, came to Ejman, where they remained a period of six days, drying their rice, and eventually left lor Shargah, without having lost a grain of their property. So marked was the conduct of Shaikh Abdool Azeez, so far removed from the usual spirit of mischief displayed by the chiefs in cases of like temptation, that the British Government thought it right to notify their approval of his behaviour by a special vote of thanks. Major Hennell, therefore, was requested to intimate to the Ejman Chief how highly the Government he represented appreciated his praiseworthy exertions and conduct. In the early part of the ensuing year (1846), Shaikh Abdool Azeez A . D . 1846. entered into an alliance with the Chiefs of De- baye and Arnulgavine, for the purpose of resist ing and repelling the combined attacks of their common foes, Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur the Joasmee Chief, and Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon the Bemyas Chief. He scarcely, however, deserves the name of an ally, for in lieu of remaining staunch and firm to the cause he had es poused, and to which, moreover, it was his especial interest to adhere, he was ever inconstant and changeable. We find him on one occasion permitting himself to be detached from the side of Shaikh Muktoom the Debaye Chief, and acknowledging his subservience to Shaikh Saltan bin Suggur, merely, it was supposed, to enable him to proceed to the fishery. Again, we are told by Major Hennell, some three months later in the selfsame year, that ' the Chiefs of Debaye, Ejman, and Amulga- vine, one and all loudly complained of the Joasmee's unfriendly proceedings, in preventing intercourse between their respective sub jects' ; and lastly, in a letter from the same officer, bearing date the loth of December 1846, we read that 'the Shaikh of Ejman had found himself so pressed by the adherents of the Joasmees on either side of his port, that he had been compelled to withdraw from his alliance with the Chiefs of Amulgavine and Debaye, and place himself under the protection of his former enemy, Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur.' From which it would seem that he accommodated himself entirety to the existing state of circumstances, and had no hesitation in declaring or this party or that party, according as he thought would be most beneticial to his personal interests. Ihere is nothing of importance to relate until the summer of the year a. d . 1848. 1848, when, after the Brymee forts hadsuccumb- ed to the Prowess of the confederate Chiefs of Aboothabee and Sohar, the Joasmee and Debaye chiefs, trembling for514 EJMAN. tho integrity of their respective possessions, entered into a close and strict alliance, and proposed to the Shaikhs of Ejman and Amulgavine that they also should join the league against the Beniyas Ruler. Either, however, declined the invitation received, and refused to take part in the machinations of the Joasmee and his complying associate of Debaye, In the month of September 1848 a serious conflict occurred between the people of Ejman and those of Himreeah. A feud, it would seem, had long existed between the inhabitants of the two places, and although for some time past it had lain apparently dormant, it was all of a sudden revived, and hostilities were resorted to with more than their usual ferocity. The circumstances attending the renewal of strife were these :— On the 18th of September, Syf bin Abdoolla dying, the people elected in his stead one of their elders, Abdoolla bin Abdool Suteef, Whether the step gave umbrage to Shaikh Abdool Azeez, or whether he thought a favourable moment for a recourse to coercion had arrived, is not known. By whatever feeling he was actuated, however, he set out with a force of no less than four hundred followers, for the purpose of inflicting chastisement upon the people of Himreeah. His brother, Humeed bin Rashid, also accompanied the expedition. One half of his array was posted on the banks of the Khore, and with the rest he proceeded to Himreeah direct. The foe was well prepared to receive him : they left a small body of troops to defend their town, and with a party, some hundred and twenty in number, hastened to meet the invader. The detachments encountered, and notwithstanding the numerical superiority of the Ejmanees, the people of Himreeah proved quickly victorious. The former, perceiving the fall of Abdool Azeez, theii Chief, and also that Humeed bin Rashid, his brother, was wound ed, finding themselves deprived of a leader, were seized with a panic, and fled from the field in the greatest disorder. The Himreeahites followed close in pursuit, until they reached the very walls of the town of Ejman, whence, after killing and wounding a considerable number, they retraced their steps to Himreeah. Such was the result of the conflict. As to casualties, the Ejmanees, besides their chief, sulTered a loss of twenty-six killed and twenty men wounded. On the side of Himreeah, the chief and five others were killed on the spot, and as many as twenty-two placed //ors de combat. . Hum eed bin Rashid was elected Chief of Ejman, and the son of Syf bin Abdoolla head of Himreeah. Hostilities continued for a length of time, neither chief permitting subjects to pioceed to the pearl fishery, the season for which had now arrived, until Abdoolla bin Rashid, Chief of Amulgavine, at the67 EJMAN. 515 invitation of the Chief of Heera, repaired in person to Ejman, and mediated a peace between the contending parties. Humeed bin Rashid had scarcely been chief a couple of months ere he espoused the cause of the defeated Wahabee, and joined the league against Shaikh Syud at Brymee. What part, if any, he took in the skirmishes that were fought with the Chief of the Beniyas, does not appear. Of his subsequent proceedings no mention is made. We simply gather, from a letter addressed to Major Hennell, on the 8th of December 1848, that he set out on the 4th of the month with the Nuj- dees, Joasmees, and Boo Felasa, to attack the holders of Brymee. A general peace was concluded in February 1849, in the terms of which Humeed bin Rashid was of course included. In the spring of 1850, when the Joasmee repaired with his allies to Sohar and the Batinah Coast, for the purpose of assisting Syud Ghes, repelling Shaikh Syud, and contending with Syud Soweynee, Shaikh Humeed bin Rashid proceeded to Zeit, to join Shaikh Sultan, with a detachment of two hundred men. Not one single matter of interest remains to be told, affecting this tribe, further than a simple mention of the Treaty for Perpetual Peace at Sea,* entered into by the Maritime Chiefs of the Arabian Coast, to the conditions of which Shaikh Humeed bin Rashid exhibited the greatest readiness to subscribe in the month of May 1853. * Tide page 88 of this Selection.HISTORICAL SKETCH connected with THE TEIBE OF AMULGAVINE by LIEUTENANT H. F. LISBllOWE^ assistant to the resident in the persian gulf. Submitted to Government on the ISth August 1854.518 AMULGAVINE. T he first subject worthy of mention connected with this tribe is the re-establishment of friendship between its Chief, Shaikh Abdoolla bin Rashid, and Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, the head of the Joasmees. The latter chief, as it would seem, was driven, in October 1844, by 1Q) . adverse winds, to take shelter in the port of a. d . 1844. 4 i- . Amulgavme, and notwithstanding the blood feud existing between the Joasmee and Amulgavine Tribes, Shaikh Sultan, at the pressing invitation of Abdoolla bin Rashid, went ashore, and partook of the hospitality that was graciously proffered him. He con- tinned the guest of the Amulgavine Shaikh for the space of a night and a day, when, after professing his feelings of friendship and amity, he quitted the place, and proceeded on his way to Ras-ool-Khyma. In the month of October 1845 the Chief of Amulgavine identified himself with the Wahabee at a time when the lat- a. d. 1845. ter was contemplating the seizure of the fort of Zeit, in the vicinity of Ejman, and when the whole of the maritime chiefs, save himself alone, had arrayed themselves against him, and determined to oppose with all the means in their power the execution ot the design he had in view. It is needless entering farther into de tail here on this matter, full particulars having been already given in the narrative of the Wahabee Tribe, with whose history the subject is more particularly connected,* Early in the ensuing year Shaikh Abdoolla bin Rashid, finding A D |g 4 g Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur was bent on compel ling him to renounce his independence, and own allegiance to himself, entered into the closest alliance with Shaikh Muktoom bin Butye, for the purpose of opposing the ambitious designs ot the .loasmee. Shaikh Muktoom was delighted to fall into the views of Abdoolla * Page 45/ et seq, of this Selection.AMULGAVINE. 519 • bin Rashid ; indeed it was he that proposed a coalition, for he beheld a ioitified structure in course of erection at the very door of his territories (at Aboo Heyle, within three miles of Debaye),—a structure which, if once completed and manned, might almost endanger the safety of Debaye itself. These towers were not to be built: all the maritime chiefs agreed with Shaikh Muktoom of Debaye, that such a building, within gunshot range of the outskirts of his capital, must not be permit ted to rise. One and all combined to oppose its construction, and Shaikh Sultan would not have been able to stand for a moment had he not contrived to win over the Beniyas Chief to his side, and to estrange the affections of the Chief of Ejman. The Shaikhs of Debaye and Amulgavine, the only two that were left, remained closely united. The former chief said, that so long as the Maiitime Truce existed he feared no danger from the side of the sea he declared his perfect indifference for any attempts they might make from the land. Shaikh Abdoolla bin Eashid bore an active part, and behaved himself nobly throughout the hosti lities : he it was who commanded a party of his own people, when attacked by a body of troops from Shargah; he it was who, after a ferocious struggle, put them to flight, and sent them back without a leader, that leader being slain on the field, and no less a person than a son of the mighty Shaikh Sultan; he, too, ever acted in concert with Shaikh Muktoom bin Butye, and, unlike the vacillating Shaikh Abdool Azeez, who was now 'for, now against, the Chief of Debaye, he neither swerved to the right hand nor to the left, but co operated with him on every single occasion, and remained in unison A . D . i 8 47. Until the s P rin g of 1847 » wh en a Treaty of Peace entered into between Shaikh Sultan and Shaikh Muktoom, he was also included. ' Aware, however, of the feelings of bitter enmity with which he was regarded by the former, A\ho had reaped nothing but damage, both in power and reputation, since the commencement of the aggressive proceedings. Shaikh Abdoolla bin Rashid was not disposed to allow himself to be lulled into security by the hollow engagement' that was now concluded. Nothing of importance occurred until early in the year 1848, when A&gt; D . 1848&gt; hostilities commenced between the Beniyas Chief and the Wahabee Lieutenant, during which all the maritime chiefs, save one, ranged themselves on the side of the latter,—that one was Abdoolla bin Rashid. He appears to have been favourably inclined to Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon, and to have viewed the brilliant successes of that chief with as much delight as he beheld with distaste the attempts of the Joasmee confederacy to re-establish Wahabee supremacy in the province of Oman. As far as520 -AMULGAVINE. can be learnt, he took no active part whatsoever in the quarrel • and a. d. 1848-49. notwithstanding the pressing invitations or demands of the Joasmee, that lie should act offensively against Shaikh Syud bin Tahnoon, contrived to preserve a strict neutrality throughout the contention. In 1850, however, when a series of hostilities were commenced by a. d. 1850. t ' le ^ oasinee Chief and his allies against the Muskat authorities, Abdoolla bin Rashid declar ed for Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur,—he went so far, at least, as to send a small detachment of camel-men to join the Joasmee forces at Zeit and can therefore no longer be said to have remained neutral. Shaikh Saltan was, as usual, peculiarly grateful for the succours afforded. He hastened to show unmistakeable symptoms of gratitude. By way of return for the aid that was proffered, he seized upon all the date groves and other property pertaining to Amulgavine that were to be found in the neighbourhood of Shinas. Abdoolla bin Rashid remonstrated, but without effect : the seizures were retained, and the people of Amul- gavine, fearing an attack upon their capital, were unable to proceed to tne pearl banks. Nothing of sufficient interest to be related occurred until the close of a. d. 1852. ^ le y ear 1^52, when Abdoolla bin Rashid enter- 4 . c ^ ed into an alliance, offensive and defensive, with tne Shaikhs of Aboothabee and Debaye. I nc two lattei chiefs were in the midst of negotiations, owing to the intrigues set on foot by Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur, who had determined to support the pretensions of the sons of the late Muktoom bin Butye to the Ch.efshtp of Debaye, in supersession of Shaikh Syud bin Butye, when Alt bin Abdoolla bin Eashid, the son of Abdoolla bin Rashid, ar- already alluded to. 6 '' and ' lree chiefs cont| - aot ed the engagement There remains but to mention that in the month of March 1853 Ab- a. d. 1853. doolla bin Rashid proceeded to Brymee, to wait . • • upon Abdoolla bin Fysul, and, in seeking per- h •: 011 0 r&lt; : urn t0 hls P ort ' for the purpose of meeting the Resident, mm tl lcstia ^ nt imposed upon his actions.

K hor H assan is situated on the Arabian Coast, and held by Janbir, of the Yalahimah Tribe of Uttoobees. The Sketch of the Uttoobees* affords information of this, the maritime branch of the tribe, up to the date of their reduction of Bahrein. Ihe four sons of Jaubir having been dissatisfied with their portion of the rewaids distributed on that occasion, left the island in disgust, and the survivor and his tribe have continued to prosecute the mode of life in which their ancestors had been bred. After the death of their father,f these brothers took up their residence for some time at Bushire and Karrack, after which they returned to Khor Hassan, and betook themselves to piracy, in the course of which occupa tion Eahmah obtained the ascendancy. Abdoolla, the elder brother, resorted to Muskat, and sought the protection of the Imaum, soliciting is interference and assistance to enable him to recover possession of or Hassan from his brother; in which he does not appear to have succeeded, but died at Aluskat. The armament that proceeded against,Jhe pirates in 1S09 did not attack Khor Hassan, since, notwithstanding the ferocity of the character a ma bin Jaubir, the surviving brother, and the apprehensions entertamed that he would prosecute piracy, he had always respected the British pass and colours.

He captured also a ship, and several ows and small craft belonging to Muskat, Bushire, Congoon, &amp;c., and, AVi 1 very few exceptions, put the crews to death. Apprehensions were generally entertained that, if measures were not pursued to reduce his growing strength, the whole of the Gulf would, as soon as our cruisers quitted the station, be reinfested with his spoliators In the month of May 1811 Rahmah bin Janbir again pot to sea, on a. d. 1811. a cril i s i n g expedition, accompanied by a fleet of t . . b0atS belon g in g to the Joasraee Tribe called kjman, that inhabited the coast to the northward of Ras-ool-Khyma w ich escaped without suffering any injury from the late expedition. A desperate action was fought between Rahmah's fleet and the Uttoobees of Bahrein, in which the latter were victorious. Some captures having been made in the Gulf, and remonstrances a. d. 1813. s f nt 10 the Wahabee, and the Chiefs of Eas-ool- , , Khyma and Khor Hassan, Rahmah bin Jaubir. in a letter dated the 27th of October, detailed the circumstances attend ing the capture of a Buggalow from Bussora with horses on board belonging to the Honorable East India Company, of which he was nol aware, but as soon as he found they were British property, he eno-a-ed boats to convey them to Bombay, where they all arrived in safety ° ' n the 26th of October 1816 Mr. Bruce reported that the famous a. d. 1816. Piratical Chieftain Rahmah bin Jaubir, with all ' 1 ' s ' )oa,s i and tribe, consisting of about five hundred famihes, had arrived at Bushire, and the Governor, Shaikh Mahomed, had received them, and allotted them a particular quarter of the town to reside in, on condition of being friends with his friends, and enemies with his enemies; that he possessed two very large Bnggalows a t T,^ ' an '' | SeVeral S ' a ' ^'Sgarahs- He gave out that ho intended leaving ofl h.s predatory life, and to employ his boats on mer- cantile concerns,-at all events as long as he resided at Bushire Mr Bruce thought he would be en peaceable terms with most of the ports' of the Gulf, as the Bushire Government was so with them. The Imaum was anxious for Rahmah bin Jaubir to have accompanied nm to Muskat, and offered him any of his ports to settle in ; but his late defeat had shown such a want of foresight and judgment that he had v! .If, f araC, T T Ch in the estimati0n of the Arab Tribes: Rahmah was therefore afraid to pnt himself so much in his power He would not have left his former abode if he could have avoided it JThe W ahabee Chief, Abdoolla bin Saood, was so incensed against him for avmg taken part with the Imaum of Muskat, that he directed his pro perty and family to be seized, and brought up to Deriah, and it was with great difficulty he was able to get them from Khor Hassan, C8KIIOR HASSAN. Rahmah bin Janbir, after his arrival at Bushirc, paid the Resident a visit, and renewed his professions of friendship towards the British Go vernment, and requested the Resident to say that he should be happy to attend to any wishes Government might have towards checking the depredations of the Joasmees. Mr. Brace having communicated to Rahmah bin Jaubir the friendly A D 181 - &gt; disposition towards him of the British Govern ment, he expressed himself highly flattered: he had just returned from a successful cruise to the southward of Bahrein, against the Joasmee boats, which frequented that island for supplies of dates, rice, &amp;c. in return principally for the property of the Sarat ships. He intercepted twelve boats laden with supplies proceed ing to Ras-ool-Khyma, four of which he sank, after taking out their cargoes ; four others he broke up for the want of men to man them, and four he brought to Bushire. He intended, after landing the property which he had brought to that pkice, to proceed again to the southward, to cruise between the piratical ports and Bahrein. In 1818 Rahmah bin Jaubir proceeded to, and landed with some guns a. d. 1818 at ^ atee ^ wtl ich he battered, in concert with Ibrahim Pacha, and commenced to rebuild his old foit at Demaum, which the Wahabees had blown up in July 1816, to which, when finished, he intended to remove from Bushire, with his family and adherents. CONTINUATION OF THE PRECEDING TO THE YEAR 1831,, BY LIEUTENANT S. IIENNELL. Mr. Warden s Sketches conclude in 1818, by stating that Rahmah in aubir had commenced the rebuilding of his fort at Demaum,* which had been destroyed by the Uttoobees in 1816. From the period above mentioned the records of the Bushire Resi- a. d. 1819. dency make no mention of this notorious person till July 1819, when he is stated to have been at vateef at the time Captain Sadlier landed there on his mission to Ibra- acha, and that he rendered that officer every assistance, piloting the Vestal cruiser himself into the harbour. * A fort on a small island opposite Bahrein, and close to Kateef,KIIOJl HASSAN. ^95 In January 1820, an intimation from the Resident at Bushire was a- d. 1820. conveyed to Rahmah bin Jaubir, that his vessels against the people of Blhrel^unless regular warfare, and that if they did so he would H p • i 4 u 111 i ^rr on,h R —- a D &gt; &amp;Ir w - (t - Ken- for the destruction of all the ve«r.|~ K, i to this chief, but as he was at the time of ,1.

Imamn, stating that so little reliance was to be placed upon his word that he had determined to have nothing more to do with him, and therefore would not be answerable for his actions. 1 he renioxal ot the British troops from Kishm appears to have a. d. 1823. afforded this icstless character much pleasure, and he is reported to have publicly expressed his joy at having, as he conceived, the field thus opened for the renewal of his former system of depredation. At this time, although both old and blind, he still retained his original violence of disposition, as well as his inveterate hatred to the Uttoobee Chief, for the purpose of gratis fying which, and prosecuting his aggressions upon Bahrein, he left Bushire, and took up his residence in Demaum. In February 1824 the Resident at Bushire succeeded in effecting a A . d i 8 24. reconciliation between the Uttoobees and Shaikh Rahmah bin Jaubir, and articles of agreement were exchanged between them, by which the latter agreed to withdraw his protection from the Aboosemate Tribe, which had formerly taken refuge in Demaum from Bahrein. After paying a visit to Muskat, Rahmah returned to Demaum, and employed himself in devising plans for the recovery of a tribute formerly levied on the people of Kateef, who had lately withheld payment. In spite of his reduced resources an advanced age, his spirit still continued unsubdued, and about une 1 .,4 he made an application to the Resident to be permitted to ieven &amp; e himself upon the Shaikh of Bushire, who had received orders ,1.0 111 ^ Jc ®^ laz ^' overnn ient to detain the family of his son, and treat im as a rebel, in consequence of his having made up his quarrel with le , ^ too ^ ees - At the interposition of the Resident, however, his son s iamily was permitted to return to Demaum. The pressure of us pecuniary difficulties appears to have been somewhat relieved about - this time by the successful result of his blockade of Kateef. n the beginning of 1825 Shaikh Rahmah proceeded to Muskat, and a . n. 1825. soon after applied for, and received permission to ass ^ s t Shaikh Tahnoon in his war with the • Lhiei of the Joasmees. About the end of 1825, Rahmah bin Jaubir, on the ground of the payment of the tiibute he had formerly exacted from the people of a ee (a. a species of blackmail to save their vessels from being plun- &gt;y nm), commenced a series of predatory attacks upon the commerce of that place, paying no attention whatever to the remon- s ranees made lo him upon ihe subject by the British authority. In ^ -equenee, it was at last judged necessary to station two cruisers near Rahmr; peaoeabie ,radersin ,he vich,i,y frora gg e....ions, and at the same lime it was intimated lo him,kiior hassan. 527 tlml if he did not desist from such proceedings, he would be compelled to obedience. The refusal of this chief to attend to any remonstrances appears to have been produced by his belief in the advancing power of he Wahabees, and of their disposition to support him in every measure en ing to a renewal of the former system of predatory warfare : more particularly m those which were likely to injure their old enemies the Shaikhs of Lahsa and Kateef (Mahomed and Majid al Arareer, Chiefs Th ri T r Tnbe )- 11 was . however, subsequently decided by the British Government, that as long as Rahmah's hostilities were confined to the people of Kateef, we were not to interfere. At the «ame time, in a reply to a communication sent by him in explanation of his proceedings, he was strongly urged by the British Government to change his conduct. Shortly before the removal of our cruisers from Demaum, consequent on the decision above alluded to, the misunderstanding so long brewing between Eahmah and Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmed broke out into acts of open aggression upon each other, without, however, their carryino- on regular hostilities, from which the presence of the British vessels restrained them. ,1. N r tl f aI t' S,heh0S,ile nat ' ,re of lhe relations subsisting between e Uttoobee Shaikh and Rahmah bin Jaubir, the withdrawing our ships of war from the neighbourhood of Demaum was viewed by both parties with considerable apprehension, neither being prepared for immediate and open hostilities. They both, therefore, applied to the British Resident to proclaim a truce, but as there appeared no disposi tion on the part ol Rahmah to admit the people of Kateef to a participation of the benefits of the proposed arrangement, all further interference was declined, except such as would lead to a general pacification. In the course of the many desperate actions in which Shaikh Rahmah a. d. 1826. ' lat ' be(:n engaged with the people of Bahrein, in consequence of this war, the greater portion of his tribe was by degrees destroyed. About the end of 1826, finding himself much pressed by his enemies, who had invested Demaum 3 ahmah proceeded over to Bushire, with the view, if possible to interest the British authority in his favour, and also to procure' an addifon to the crew of his Buggalow, which, from the reasons above alluded to, had suffered very materially. In his interview wilh the Resident, this singular old man (although nearly seventy years of age, totally blind, and covered with wounds) displayed the same haughty and indomitable spirit which had always characterised him, and he express ed equal ferocity and scorn against his Uttoobee enemies. Failin' in his design of inducing the Resident to interfere in his behalf, he set' ail528 KHOR HASSAN. from Bushire, with a reinforcement of twenty-five or thirty Beloochees and proceeded over to Demaum, where he ordered his vessel to fire a salute,—a mark of contempt which so irritated the Bahrein Chiefs that Ahmed bin Suleman, a nephew of the ruling Shaikh, volunteered to attack him in his own Buggalow. His offer being accepted, he laid himself along side of Shaikh Rahmah's vessel, and a most furious action took place, the struggle being for life or death. The people of the Uttoobee Buggalow, however, suffered so severely from the heavy and well directed fire of the enemy, that she was under the necessity of sheering off in order to recruit her exhausted crew from the other Bahrein vessels m the vicinity. Having procured a reinforcement, and refusing the assistance of the rest of the fleet. Shaikh Ahmed again ad- vanced to the attack, weakened as his crew was in the former combat. Kahmah soon found that he was in no condition to carry on the engage ment, and that in a short time he must be taken by boarding, unless he surrendered,—an alternative which was out of the question, consi dering the atrocious and sanguinary warfare he had so long carried on against Bahrein. Having, therefore, given orders for his vessel to grapple with the enemy, he took his youngest son (a fine boy about eight years old) in his arms, and seizing a lighted match, directed his whh th d 7 ^ t0 tbe ma g azine - Although acquainted Wt n f'' 11 0f their Chief ' and of course aw are of the stantlv 1 e ® tluct]on wluc!l awaited them, his commands were in- scattered t ey l ^ T SeCOndS ^ ^ WaS COVered with the Ral mnh h m ? erS i , eXploded VesseI ' the miserable remains of to t e en 1 R ^ ^ deVOted foI10WerS - The -P^-n set fire fore her emy b ' gsa W ' whlch soori afterwards blew up, but not be- I bv the'r } erand r W hadb — fromtheir impending o so ma v v i.' 18 ^ fleet ' ThUS ended Rahmah bin Jaubir' whose delth' r U SCOUr f terr0r 0f lhis P art of —Id, and ferocious and Tt aS 1 Slng In ever y P art of the Gulf.

His Highness, however, succeeded at last m obtaining permission for Shaikh Busheer to erect a fort on Dareen (ap ace on Tiihoot, opposite Kateef, which becomes an island at high- water). ^ To this place he has now removed his family, and as he has been joined by a great many of the Aboosemate Tribe, who are still itter enemies of the Uttoobees, there is every reason to apprehend that the re-estabhshment of this unprincipled character in these quarte^will eventually lead to a renewal of the disputes and disturbances which interrupted the tranquillity of the Gulf during the latter part of his father's lifetime.69 ■331 MEMOIR DESCRIPTIVE OF THE NAVIGATION OF THE GULF OF PERSIA; WITH BRIEF NOTICES OF THE MANNERS, CUSTOMS, RELIGION, COMMERCE, AND RESOURCES OF THE PEOPLE INHABITING ITS SHORES AND ISLANDS.

I have endeavoured to render everything as plain as possible : in all places the native name is retained ; and on the Persian side, of such objects as are known to, and have been named by European navigators, the native name is given in addition to the one by which it is generally known to the European. It is also necessary to notice that the Bushire Residency is through out considered as our first meridian, calling it in lat. 29° 00 7 15' N., and long. 50° 51/ SO'' E. Except the survey of the first season, and part of the second, the variation of the compass has always been obtained on shore, and it may as well be here mentioned, that from observations obtained at different periods during the sixteen years T have been in the marine, and corroborated by those made by Lieutenant McClure and others, the variation in the Gulf is decreasing at the rate of aoout four miles and a half yearly. All the latitudes and longitudes have been observed on shore with an artificial horizon, as the refraction in the Gulf has been found so great that observations made with the natural horizon seldom agree two days together. The soundings have mostly, when near the shore, been carefully taken by the boats, always anchoring when any particular change occurred, and being fixed by angle taken between two well defined objects. All shoals have been fixed by a trigonometrical chain being carried round them. In all cases where the survey has been trigono metrical, which has been the case altogether, except from Bushire southward and westward, and here it has been partly so, care has been taken, by occasionally measuring bases of corroboration, and, obtaining celestial observations, to verify the work. I beg to state that the utmost care has been taken throughout the survey to prevent errors, but that some may occur I think more than probable, but trust they will be so trifling as to be of no importance to the navigation of the Gulf. In regard to the statement that closes this Memoir, relative to the rise of piracy, its causes, and suppression, it is from the best information I could get, and might be considered a subject for another pen than that of a sailor in regard to that part relative to .keeping it down. It is impartially drawn up, from an intimate knowledge of the people, and what from long experience I know to be both the least expensive and most efficient means. To Lieutenant Houghton, of the Honorable Company's Marine, and Lieutenant Haines, of the same service, I feel indebted for much useful information, GEORGE B. BRUCKS.534 NAVIGATION OF THE PART I.* ARABIAN SIDE OF THE GULF. H as M usseldom. Ras Musseldom, in lat. 26° 23' 45 // N., long. 56° 35' lO' 7 E., is the south-eastern point of the Gulf of Persia, and the outer or lowest point of the island of the same name. The island is a barren rook, about two miles m length, and half that in breadth. Its highest part is about four or five hundred feet, formed of steep cliffs. All round the cape is the lowest part, which is about thirty feet high, increasing in some parts to one hundred and fifty. It is at the southern entrance of the Gulf. Between the island (Jazeerat Musseldom) and the opposite promontory of Ras Goberhindee there is a channel, with from twenty to forty fathoms in it; the narrowest part is not quite one-third of a m.le wide, and the currents being strong and irregular, together with being liable to sudden shifts of wind, it is unsafe for navigation.

It contains about three hundred inhabitants, subject to the Imaum of Muskat. These people are very poor, and appear a separate class from either Arab or Persian. Although most of them speak Arabic or Persian, amongst themselves they have a separate language. Some few of them reside on the sides of the hills, and live by their scanty flocks of goats, which feed on the few shrubs found there. Jazeerat Goon. About three miles north-east of Koomza is situated Jazeerat Goon, a high, rugged island, about one mile in length, and half a mile in breadth, having on its south-east end a point like a steeple. The depth round it is from eighty to sixty fathoms. The Quoins. The Quoins are three rocks, near each other; two of them forming in some views like a Quoin, which name has been given them by European navigators. By the Arabs they are called Salama (welcome). The Great Quoin, called by the Arabs Salama, is in lat. 26° SO' 25 // N., long. 56° 34' 20 // E. It bears N. 8° 34 / W. from Ras Musseldom, distance seven miles nearly, and is between two and three hundred feet high, its highest part being to the north-west. The Little Quoin bears from it S. 412° E., nearly two miles ; and Gap Island, the smallest of the three, bears S. 70° 24' E. from the Great Quoin. Both these latter are called by the Arabs Bennaat. They have safe channels between them, which may be passed in case of necessity with soundings from twenty-two to forty-five fathoms; between them and the main the soundings are from forty-five to ninety fathoms. Bab Shereetah. Bab Shereetah, or Perforated Rock, in lat, 26° 23' 54' N,, long. 26° 57' 32' E., bears from the Great Quoin S, 45° S' E,, distant nine and a quarter miles ; is thirty or forty feet high ; has a hole through its centre ; is a few yards long, and narrow. Jazeerat Aboorashid. Jazeerat Aboorashid is north of Koomza two and a half miles, is about one mile long, and rather more 'than a quarter of a mile broad | has a conical hill on its southern part, and steep cliffs all round. It is about one-third of a mile off shore. Near this, in mid-channel, is a remarkable rock, called Bab Makaliff, Remarks. —Several small rocks, some fifteen feet, others less, above water, lie near this, and the eddies caused by them, together with the irregularity of the currents, render it unsafe for navigation. BetweenGULF OF PERSIA. 537 C olville's C ove. The entrance to Colville's Cove is in lat. 26° 17' SO'' N., long. 56° 24' 10' E. *, is nearly four miles deep, and generally about one mile wide ; has soundings from twenty-eight fathoms at the entrance to seven fathoms at the bottom of it. At the northern point of the entrance is a high steeple rock, which is situated about one mile to the southward of Remarkable Cliff. At the entrance, both sides of the cove are formed of cliffs from one hundred to about one hundred and fifty feet high,—the northern one is nearly perpendicular ; large masses of rock are constant ly detaching themselves, and falling at the base. The rocks are much excavated by the beating of the sea against them. The cove runs near ly NW. and SE., and consequently is exposed to north-westers, when the sea runs high, and dashes with great fury against the rocks. R oob A li . Roob Ali, a village at the bottom of Colville's Cove, has a small sandy beach in front of it, and a small mosque ; a few date and fig trees grow among the houses. Some wells of good water were found here. The inhabitants are about one hundred, subject to the Shaikh of Kassaab, and are of the Shehaheen Tribe, mostly fishermen. E lphinstone I nlet. The entrance to Elphinstone Inlet is in lat. 26° 12' SO' N., long. 56° 24' E. This inlet stretches in various undulations nearly eight miles, exhibiting many romantic aspects. Its width, at the entrance, is nearly two-thirds of a mile, and its narrowest part one-third of a mile. The hills, like most others about this part, are high and rugged, and the separation from the coves on the opposite side are in some places not above two hundred yards at the base. This was one of the many places into which the pirates used to escape from our cruisers. K assaab F ort. Kassaab Fort is in lat. 26° 18' lO' N., long. 56° 20' 46' E., and bears from Ras Shaikh Mansood S. 81° E., about three and a half miles ; is situated on a sandy beach, forming between two points of land, which project from it in a curve of about a mile wide, and the same depth. The hills are high and rugged, in some parts hanging over the sea. On the western one is a small look-out house. A flat runs off from the fort a considerable way, and dries at low-water. Under one of the hills, on the eastern side, are some wells of good water, convenient for watering. I watered here in the Honorable Company's cruiser Psyche in Decem ber 1821, with great ease. The hills at this time were covered withGULF OF PERSIA. .0.39 coves are safe to run into in case of necessity or in chase, but there is a risk in all, unless you have a commanding breeze, and in all it should be recollected the ground is bad for anchorage, especially where exposed to the prevailing winds. The soundings outside are from twenty-two to ninety fathoms, but in some parts you will have thirty and forty fathoms. When under the perpendicular cliffs between Perforated Rock and Kassaab Bay, care is required to prevent your being carried into the coves, or Discovery Strait, by the tides, either ebb or flood, especially on the springs, when they are very strong, or in light winds. Discovery Strait is easy of access, and forms a good sheltered anchor age for cruising vessels on this coast, if taken in blowing weather, but 1 would rather recommend Kassaab Bay for cruising vessels to run to during the hard north-westers in the winter months; but vessels having no object in view I should advise never getting on this part of the coast if possible, for in light winds it will often cause considerable delay in their getting clear of the Gulf. In 1821 the variation in these parts was 4° 5' W., now (1827) it is 3° 35' W. R as- OOL -Y eddke. Ras-ool-Yeddee, in lat. 26° 13' 42' / N., long. 56° 16' SO' E., is a high, bluff point, not very conspicuous unless when you are close in with the land. There are eighteen fathoms of water close in. The villages of Algeerea and Yeddee are situated between this and Bokkai Point ; they contain about one hundred and sixty inhabitants of the Shehaheen and Tannagee Tribes, mostly fishermen. At Yeddee are some wells of pretty good water, easy of access, but the exposed anchorage renders it a place unfit for watering, except in cases of necessity. The beach commences at Ras Yeddee. Ras Yeddee bears S. 41° W., nearly three miles and two-thirds from Ras Shaikh Mansood. B okha P oint . Bokha Point, in lat. 26° 9' 27' N., long. 56° 14' 10' E., is something similar, when close in, to Ras-ool-Yeddee. In a small sandy bay, towards Yeddee, is a ruinous square Ghuree, with a few unserviceable old guns, mostly dismounted. The village contains between three and four hundred men, principally of the Tannagee and Shehaheen Tribes. The Shaikh is a dependent of the Imaum of Muskat. He has under his government about sixteen or eighteen hundred people of all descriptions. There are some other trifling defences about here, but none of any consequence. There are a few straggling date groves, and a small plain near. Before the pirates obtained such power as they possessed before the expedition, there were very extensive date groves about here, but destroying the date trees being a principal object in Arabian warfare, 70540 NAVIGATION OF THE these were mostly cut down by the pirates ; but now (1827) they are getting thick again, and will no doubt resume their former state/ Be tween this and Shaam Point are the villages of Fudthra, Rumpthra and Tibbat, inhabited by fishermen, partly of the Shehaheen and partly of the Tannagee Tribe, in all about two hundred and fifty souls. The soundings about here are seven fathoms near the beach, to forty fathoms at two miles distant, sand and rocks. S haam P oint. The land about here is high ; there are three small bights, with sandy beaches, between this and Bokha, from which it bears S. 32° 20' W distant seven miles nearly. '' S haam. Shaam is a considerable village, in lat. 26° 1' 53' N., long. 5§ 0 1VW E (the fort), two miles to the southward of Shaam Point, and is inha- bited by about two hundred and fifty of the Tannagee Tribe, with nearly as many strangers of mixed tribes; they are principally fishermen. A short distance from this place is a remarkable white patch in the gh land that forms the Point of Shaam, and when the sun shines on It, it is seen at a considerable distance.

There are in the date groves about three or four hundred of the Tannagee tribe, the re- mains of the former inhabitants. They send boats to the pearl fishery, and at other times employ themselves in the trading boats of Ras-ool- lyma, and in fishing. Some few supplies may be obtained here. The soundings abreast here are three fathoms close to the beach, five to eleven from one to three miles off shore ; bottom sand and broken rock.

To the ESE. of the old town are situated the date groves, amon 2 wh.eh are several towers. The former chief, now a dependent of the bhaikh of Shargah, resides here, as Shaikh of the village of Himtial Faal. Wells of indifferent water are found scattered about among the date groves. In front of the town is a bank, with only seven or cHn ect isater on jt, and within it two and a quarter and two and a halffa- thorns. A ship in anchoring here should do so with the creek open, in our and a half or five lathoms. Supplies of cattle, poultry, and other refreshments are to be had here, at reasonable rates. The town was completely destroyed by the Honorable Company's Marine, and parties from the m.htary, when the force was removed to the opposite oo'ast in 1820; and so effectually was this done, that it is now difficult to tell v ia might have been the form of the houses. This was done in the heigh of the hot weather, and cost several officers and many valuable n their lives from fever brought on by the exposure.

A vessel in passing this should not come under seven fathoms in the night; in the day-time the reef shows itself. The backwater is formed by what is an island at high tides, and the point on which the ruined town stands. The present town of Libini is situated on this island, and contains about six hundred inhabitants, of the Al Ali Tribe, subject to the fehaikh of Shargah : they take a share in the pearl fishery, and have a few trading boats. Supplies of cattle, very good, are procurable; 'v^atei is also to be had, and the most delicious fish are in great plenty; but the inhabitants are indolent in the extreme, and seldom go to fish, unless diiven by necessity. I was on shore among them surveying the backwater for nearly three weeks, and found them generally civil, but eager to impose on me. They were in 1822 strict Wahabees, and the Shaikh did not seem to be at all pleased with the present state of things. The best anchorage is with the square house on Libini E. by S. ^ S., in five or six fathoms ; but the anchorage is very bad, being a bottom of sand and rock ; high-water at llh. 40m. E jman. Ejman, in lat. 25° 25 / 12' 7 N., long. 55^ 33 / E., bears from Amulgavine S. 37° 10 / W., fourteen miles ; is situated on the southern bank of a backwater,—one of the best on the coast, having a better entrance than any other. There are five feet on the bar at low-water, and about ten to fourteen feet inside. The rise of tide is much the same as at other places, except when influenced by the wind, when it will rise one or two feet higher. It is high-water full and change at llh. 20m. The town is small, and in 1822 had a fortified house belonging to the Shaikh; but I believe its defences have been increased since. It con tains, during the pearl season, from fourteen to seventeen hundred men, of the Mahamee Tribe. During the date season most of them retire to a place named Brahamee, distant a day's journey inland. The Shaikh, Rashid bin Ahmed, is independent, but the Shaikh of Shargah does not acknowledge it, although he has no power over him. They are mostly strict Wahabees. tresh water is procurable about half a mile from the town. The best anchorage is abreast the creek, in five fathoms, about a mile and a quarter off shore ; just without the line of three fathoms is a rocky bank, with only two fathoms on it. Between this and Shargah the coast is nearly straight, with regular soundings from three to five fathoms, sand and rocks. About one mile from Shargah Creek entrance is the ruined vil- lage of Fasht, having a small creek for their fishing-boats, and inhabited by a few fishermen. | I r I544 NAVIGATION OF THE S hargah.

The entrance is about a nule to the northward of the town, and, like all others on this coast has a bar. It runs about three miles, to A boo Heyle, where it unites with the backwater there. The western side is bounded by an insulated sandbank, on which they are now erecting their huts. Sharo-ah is at present the chief place of the Joasmec Tribe, and the head of it, Sultan bin Suggur, chiefly resides here.

The shore may be approached, in case of an attack on the town, to within two or three cable-lengths, but the anchorage is very bad, being broken rock, and sand. You have here two and three fathoms close to the beach, and five about a mile and a quarter out; but you should not anchor under five fathoms, with the entrance of the creek about SE.byS.

Debaye, in lat. 25° 16 7 26 r/ N., long. 55° 24' 42' / E., bears from Shargah S. 36 W., distant seven and a half miles, and stands, like mo^t other towns on this coast, on the banks of a backwater, although rather more elevated than most of them, being about twenty feet above the level ot the sea. It is inhabited by about seven or eight hundred of the Benivas Tribe and is defended by some towers. They are in some measure dependent on the Imaum of Muskat, who pays for the alliance of this tribe. They possess several trading boats, and send a number of boats to the pearl fishery. There were here about one hundred Siddees, in the pav of the Imaum of Muskat, who formed a sort of garrison. Debaye may be considered the end of the Pirate Coast, although I believe they never took a very active part in it. There are several small banks off Debave and the coast is fronted by a reef to the distance of about three-quarters of a mile, extending nearly to Aboo Heyle. From this bank the soundings are a fathom and a half close to it, five fathoms about a mile and a half off, and increasing to seven, eight, and nine, four or five miles off.

Aboothabee, in lat. 24° 29' 21' N., long. 54° 32' 20' E., is situated on a sandy island, and is the principal place of the Beniyas Tribe, and the residence of their Chief, Shaikh Tahnoon. The tribe consists of about two thousand four hundred men ; but there are, of the Monasir and other tribes, near five thousand more, who acknowledge his govern ment. These mostly reside in the interior, at several places in a district called Ruffthra. At Aboothabee the inhabitants are about twelve hundred generally, although much increased in the pearl season, con sisting of people of the above tribes, and a number of Banians, who are traders and goldsmiths. There is in the town a fortified house, and a small tower. There are several more towers in different parts of the island, and two or three villages. The inhabitants have a number of trading boats, and take a large share in the pearl fishery. These form their principal resources, as the country affords little or nothing; cattle and poultry are occasionally procurable, but the only water they have is quite salt. The anchorage is foul, and unsafe, except in southerly winds.

Khore el Bezzim is formed on the northern side by East India Com pany's Islands, and on the south by the mainland of Arabia, and is forty miles deep from its entrance at Bezzim el Gurabee, and from five miles at the entrance to one at the upper part wide, having soundings from nine to two fathons at the upper part. The deepest water and best channel is about one-lhird over from the islands, near the main. Several small patches, with one and a half and two fathoms, lay scattered about. 1 his place is said to have been one of the resorts of the pirates, and many of their boats were said to have been here at the time of the expedition. R as H adwarkah. From Cape Meriton to Ras Hadwarkah, in lat. 24° 11' 40' N., long. 52° 47' 10' 7 E., the coast is fronted, after quitting Khore el Bezzim, to a distance of fourteen miles, by a reef, and numerous small patches. Although there are channels between them, still, it being impossible to give a guide for avoiding the dangers, it cannot be considered safe to navigate. Unless in case of necessity, or being in chase, no vessel should come here, in which case I can only recommend great attention to the lead and look-out, as the only guides they can have. After passing the sandy island of Aiche, in lat. 24° 17' 30' n., long. 53° 1' 35' E., when, if running for Khore el Bezzim, run in as near mid-channel, between the island of Bezzim el Gurabee and the main, as possible, keeping a sharp look-out for a small shoal patch bearing true W. five and a half miles from the body of the island. After passing it, steer boldly up the Khore, keeping near mid-channel until you near the fourth island, when haul in for it, and keep about one-fifth over from it towards the main, to clear a shoal patch on that side. After this, keep over on the island side, along the edge of the reef. Altei passing this island, your soundings will be from four and a half to thiee fathoms, until you come to Jazeerat Billyaird, when it will not be prudent to go further, although you will carry three fathoms and two and a half near the island much further. If it is near low -water, a boat of moderate size cannot go through, but if high-water she will have six or seven feet water, and most probably get into the deep water between Bellyaird and Salaly. Supposing you to be in chase, and the chase steered through Aiche, steer well up to the north, giving Bezzim el Gurabee a berth of six miles, to avoid the patch before mentioned, looking sharp out for a bank near the centre of the channel, whose west end is in lat. 24° 22' N., long. 53° 9' 5' E., and east end in lat. 24° 27' 20' N., long. 53° 20' 5' E. Between this and the bank off the islandmm® 552 NAVIGATION OF THE is a channel with three and four fathoms in, but very narrow at the western end. The whole of these large reefs show quite plain. Steer between this reef and the offshore one, or Walker's Reef. The dis tance between in the narrowest part, close to the east end of the centre bank, is rather more than two miles, soundings from ten to five fathoms. After passing this reef you will see Arlat Owhale and Umbarras : steer to pass between them, nearest the former when you are clear of the in shore channel. S tannus' B anks.

In rounding this island, to go to the cove, which you should do on the eastern side, pass the southern side of the small sandy island of Rusheed at a distance of three quarters of a mile, and run round not coming nearer Seer Beniyas than two and a quarter miles, or seven' athoms, until you near the small dry sandbank, or get the peak to bear about W by S, when haul in towards the island, keeping along at about one mile distant, until you get close to the south point, which haul round about a quarter of a mile distant, and anchor under the island in five or six fathoms offshore, from two cable-lengths to a quarter of a mile W are well sheltered here from all winds. In rounding the island' the soundings m some places are irregular. You may run down to the' SSE. of this island in soundings from fourteen to four fathoms, look ing sharp out for a small dry sandbank in the fair-way ; but there is no outlet, and is only mentioned in case of being in chase. Between Seer Beniyas and the main are two reefs, with a channel nearly a mile wide between them, having three fathoms at low-water in it ; but the tides run in it with such rapidity, and the set is so irregular, that it is unsafe to navigate.

Two other detached banks lie to the north of Zabopt, distant five and a half miles, having narrow channels, with from three to four fathoms between them. Between these banks and Seer Beniyas the channel is so clear that you may follow a vessel into the bight in safety. The western side of Seer Beniyas may also be approach ed to a mile. North-west, distant six and a half miles from the rock off Zaboot, is a small patch, with two fathoms on it.

The entrance is only half a mile wide, having three and four fathoms water in it in mid-channel, and rather less towards the northern reef, and towards the southern two fathoms. As the shoals show themselves distinctly, to enter the harbour you must be guided by them, keeping rather nearer to the northern one. The narrow part is not more than half a mile in length. When through, steer for the town, and anchor abreast the eastern tower, in three and a half fathoms, about half a mile off shore. This place contains about four hundred Arabs of the Nahune, Dooasir, and Abookara Tribes, and is frequented by the Monasir and other wandering tribes. In the pearl season the inhabit ants are augmented to about twelve hundred, it being convenient to the banks, and so completely sheltered. The people are mostly fishermen; they have one or two trading boats, and, like all other inhabitants of this coast, take a large share in the pearl fishery. They are subject to Bahrein.

The centre tower of Rooese is in lat. 26° 8' 25' / N., long. 51° 18' 50' E. It is a small town, much in ruins, situated on a shallow backwater, into ■which the boats belonging to this part of the coast enter at high-water. e inhabitants are about one hundred, of the Abookara and Uttoobee Inbes, subject to Bahrein; they are mostly fishermen. R as R eccan. Ras Reccan is a small island, in the shape of a T, and is the northern point. It is in lat. 26° 11' 25' N., long. 51° 18' 15' E., and is very low. It is nearly joined to the main at low-water, the shallow backwater of Rooese being the only separation. From the point to A1 Bidder sonthward and to Warden's Islands westward, the authority of the onaikh oi Bahrein is acknowledged. General Remarks on the Coast fr After passing Fasht al Arief, and being abreast of Ras Allarch, you should not come under five fathoms, which will be from two and a half to three miles off shore, until you are abreast of Ras Abool Nasheit when it will be necessary, if not bound to Al Bidder, to keep more to the eastward, not coming under four and a half or five fathoms, until you are well past Ras Mut Buck. To preserve this depth, you will in some places be ten and eleven miles off shore, abreast of Ras Mut Buck six if fl be i ni l Wel1 paSt the Bas ' you ma y lhen kee P in four and a half or five fathoms, about two and a half miles offshore, until you get near Ras Reccan. General Remarks on the Coast from Aboothahee to Al Bidder .—The coast is nearly all destitute of water, and uninhabited, except bv straggling parties of the Monasir and other wandering tribes, and is -562 NAVIGATION OF THE completely barren from the meridian of the Yassaat or Psyche 's Islands carrying a line eastward of Arlaat Dalmy, and to the northward and eastward of Fasht Alladeid, to Eas Allarch. Within this line the naviga- tion is extremely dangerous, and should not be attempted except in chase, or other emergent cases, without a pilot. In cases of emergency, the directions already given, and the chart before you, will carry you clear. Boats should never land on any part of this coast away from the towns or villages, without being well armed. B oodeshoof. Boodeshoof, in lat. 26° 7' 50'' N., long. 51° 16' E., is on the point ncaily opposite Has Reccan, and is subject to Bahrein, having about fifty men of the Abookara Tribe, mostly fishermen. Y amale.

It has about fifty inhabitants, of mixed tribes, all fishermen. K hor H assan. Khor Hassan is in lat. 26° 4' 20' N., long. 51° 10' 55' E. It is a small village, with a square fort, belongs to Bahrein, and has about one hundred inhabitants, of the Abookara and Uttoobee Tribes, principally fishermen. F eyraha. Feyraha is a small village, in lat. 26° 2' N., long. 51° 9' E. It belongs to Bahrein, and has a few trading boats belonging to it. It has about one bundled and fifty inhabitants, of the Abookara Tribe, principally fishermen. ZoBARA. Zobara is in latitude 26° N., long. 51° 8' 30' E. It is a large town, now in ruins. It is situated in a bay, and has been, before it was destroyed, a place of considerable trade. The inhabitants are of the Tiibe of Alassar, and subject to Bahrein ; a number of fine Nujdee horses are still exported from this place. This was originally the principal place of the Uttoobee Tribe, until they separated. General Remarks on the Coast from Ras Reccan to Zohara.—^e coast runs south-westerly, and is fronted by reefs all the way, which are diy at low-water, to two or three miles from the shore. It is navi gable to the last mentioned place, having a channel of four fathoms etween it and the Debil Shoal. The villages are all subject to Bah- n, an supplies of cattle may be obtained between them. It is neces- y o e on your guard, in landing, against the straggling Bedouins.mmm 1 Wtfj: eiifc GULF OF PERSIA. R ayborraidge. Rayborraidge is a small village, at the back of Bahrein, on the main, in lat. 25° 57' 20' N., long. 51° 6' 20' E. Between this and Bahrein the water is shoal, and full of patches. Towards Bahrein the reefs extend a considerable way off the island, and render it quite unsafe for naviga tion. It has about one hundred and fifty inhabitants, Uttoobees of the Bahrein Tribe. D ooat al U fzan. Dooat al Ufzan is an inlet running in on the western side of these islands, with shoal water over rocky ground. The bottom of it is in lat. 25° 31' N., long. 51° 1' 50'' E.

Debil Shoal is divided by a channel two miles wide, having two and a half and three fathoms in it. The shoal is dry-at low-water, and safe to approach to three fathoms. It also affords good anchorage under the lee of it, well sheltered in north-westers. The northern point of the larger shoal is in lat. 26° 18' 5' N., long. 50° 59' 50' E.; the southern part in lat. 26 12' 25' N., long. 50° 59' 25 // E. ; and the centre of the smaller shoal is in lat. 26° 10' 20' N., long. 50° 56' 25' E. Between this shoal and the island of Bahrein there is a channel having from three to seven fathoms in it. BAHREIN. Tne island of Bahrein or Awal, and adjacent islands, were known to the ancients by the name of Tylos, and are mentioned by Arrian. We have no satisfactory accounts of them from that period, until in the possession of the Portuguese, who, soon after Ormus was taken by Albu- queique, established settlements here and at Kateef, and monopolised a gieat portion of the pearl fishery and trade of the Gulf. They were expelled soon after the fall of Ormus, by the Persians, who were shortly a tei expelled by Houd bin Jamain, the Shaikh of Alassar's people, w 10 possessed the island for several years, when it was again con quered, after a severe struggle, by the Persians, and the whole of the ■t assar town laid in ruins. Reinforcements soon arriving, the Alassar peop e again made head, and drove the Persians out of the island, and se\cial towns on the ruins of the former ones, which are to be seen at the present time. s ® vent y 01 ei g ht y years back, the grandfather of the present UttoV' T r ? Was 0 f a powerful family, originally from Alassar, of the Bush' 6(3 ri ^ eilteie&lt;: ^ ^ nto a secret treaty with the then Governor of ' ating to pay tribute to the Persian Government, if byGULF OF PERSIA. 565 their aid he was placed in possession of the island. Having many followers, this overture was attended to, and, by the assistance of the Persians, he was made Shaikh or governor, and continued during his life in peaceable possession of the government. Soon after his death, some of the people belonging to his son and successor (Ahmed bin Khaleefa) were murdered by the Governor of Bushire, when the Bahrein people flew to arms, and threw oft the Persian yoke. A large army was assembled by the Persians, consisting of the people of Bushire, Dil- lum, Bundereig, Congoon, and Lingah, from the Persian side, aided by the people of what have since become the Pirate Ports, and invaded the island. The people of Bahrein were assisted by the people of Alassar and Kateef. After a war of several months, with various successes, and the loss of many men on both sides, they became tired of the war. Several of the allies on both sides having quitted them, they entered into a treaty, by which the Persian troops were withdrawn, and the Shaikh (Ahmed) consented to pay tribute to the Persians, which was continued until about 1790, when the Persian yoke was entirely thrown off, and they have been independent of Persia ever since. Although frequently threatened with invasion, it has never taken place. They have had several wars with the Imaum of Muskat, who invaded the island about nine years back, but was beaten off with great loss, his brother being killed. Having been on friendly terms with the Joasmee pirates,—indeed having been the mart for the sale of their plunder,—they were included in Sir W. Gr. Keir's treaty in 1819. They about the same time entered into a treaty with the Imaum of Muskat, and pay him an annual tribute of 9,000 dollars. There have been several wars of late between them and Rahmah bin Jaubir, of Demaum, near Kateef, who belonged to the same family. These were at one time settled through the mediation of the British Government, but the turbulent disposition of Rahmah could not remain quiet, and they again broke out with fresh violence, which ended in the death of that chieftain. The island of Bahrein or Awal is between llghty and ninety statute miles in circumference, and about one-fifth of it is well watered, thickly inhabited, and partially cultivated; the remainder is either hilly or a desert—nearly equally divided. There are the remains of several fine reservoirs and aqueducts built by the Portuguese, but falling fast to decay; as is the Portuguese fort, which has originally been a strong place, and protecting the Portuguese harbour, not now in use, having given way to that of Munama, near it. The only other ruins of any interest are those of a mosque built by the Alassar people.566 NAVIGATION OF THE The population of the island varies, but, from the best information I could obtain, with that of Muharag and Arad Famohay, amounts to sixty thousand men, consisting of the following tribes : the Uttoobees of Bahrein, the Shaikh's family ; the Abookara, A1 Zayed, A1 Salata, A1 Mahande, Mootsallema, Kaiser, Genahat, and some mixed tribes, in all said to be eighteen or twenty thousand men capable of bearing arms; the remainder, about forty or forty-five thousand, Bahreinees, are a mixed breed between Arab and Persian, mostly cultivators, merchants, and fishermen, who appear to possess more of the indolence and cunning of the Persian than the frank and open boldness of the Arab. The Arabs look with much contempt upon this class. There are also in the Shaikh's pay about three hundred Siddees, and about eight hundred of the Beni Khalid Tribe, There are also about one hundred Banians, merchants and shop-keepers, at Munama. The Mahomedan religion of the sect of Omar is that of the place, but a large portion of the Bahreinees are Sheeas. The total number of men under the Shaikh's government, he possessing the several places on the coast already mentioned, amounts to about seventy thousand. The pearl fishery alone employs nearly thirty thousand men, there being under the Shaikh's government two thousand four hundred and thirty pearl boats, each employing from eight to twenty men. Bahrein is also a place of great trade, and has belonging to it twenty large boats, Buggalows and Buteels, from three hundred and fifty to one hundred and forty tons, mostly employed in the Indian trade ; and about one hun dred from forty to one hundred and twenty tons, employed in the trade of the Gulf. An account of the exports and imports will be found attached. The Shaikh, Abdoolla bin Ahmed, resides at Muharag, on the island of that name, which is a large town, and contains about six thousand inhabitants. The principal town on Bahrein is Munama, and is the port of the island, most of the merchants either residing, or having their karavan- seria there. Most of the imports are landed here, and a duty of five per cent, was in 1826 established on Indian produce, and most articles from the Persian Coast, Bussora, and Muskat. The other principal town on the island is Raffar, situated on a hill seven miles distant, the residence of Shaikh Khaleefa, the nephew and partner in the government of Abdoolla bin Ahmed. It consists of a squaie fort or Ghuree, surrounded by habitations, chiefly occupied by his followers. Numerous other small towns and villages are scattered o\er the cultivated part of the island, but none of sufficient note to require remark. On the eastern side of the island are the ruins of a large town called Jow, formerly the residence of the Shaikhs, aban-GULF OF PERSIA. doned in 1800 for want of a sheltered port, and the inhabitants trans ferred to Muharag. Off the islands, and mostly on the reefs, are situated springs of fresh water rising out of the sea ; some are in two, three, four, and I have heard five, fathoms water. They obtain the water by holding a Mussuk over the mouth of a jar fixed over the spring. The pearl fishery generally commences about the beginning of June, and is carried on with the greatest activity until October. Durir^g the period of the fishing, frequently pearls to the amount of from sixteen to twenty lakhs of dollars are obtained, and are exported in the manner mentioned in the account of the trade of the island. The Shaikh receives a small tax from every boat employed, besides having a number employed on his own account during the pearl fishery. It is all hurry, and the pearl bank exhibits an interesting sight; several thousand boats being seen at the same time, some sailing about, others at anchor, but all briskly employed. The people of the island are much divided : those who are termed Arabs, and are not engaged in trade, are attached to the SJiaikh and his Government ; the other part, consisting of all those engaged in mercantile pursuits, and by far the most wealthy, are much dissatis fied, and it was by no means uncommon during the survey of the island for the people, when they thought themselves safe from being overheard, asking whether the English were not going to take posses sion of the island, and appearing both incredulous and disappointed when replied to in the negative. The Shaikh also suspects such to be our view, as he cannot conceive why we should be at the expense and trouble of making these surveys, if we had no ulterior view. Bahrein is capable, under good govern ment, of being very valuable, as the whole trade of the Arabian side of the Gulf might be centred in the island, which in itself is capable of the greatest improvement, and might be made to produce large quan tities of wheat and barley, which grow in some few places, where cultivated, to the greatest perfection. The soil of about one-fourth of the island is very rich, and, in proper hands, would be much improved, as the greater part, with the exception of the date plantations, a few barley, wheat, and clover fields, lies entirely waste. Much more of the island might be brought into culti vation by conveying the water by an aqueduct to those parts of the island now without it, and the springs at the reservoirs are fully equal to the supply. With the exception of the hills, and some small portions bordering on the sea, I do not think there is a part but what is capable of cultivation; but this is not ever likely to take place while the island remains under the present Government, as for want of encouragement I568 NAVIGATION OF THE the people entirely neglect it. The island also produces citrons, pome granates, mulberries, dates, figs, melons, and other fruits ; also several kinds of vegetables. Cattle and poultry are also procurable, but rather dear, being brought from other places. The cloth bazar is pretty well supplied. The islands of Muharag, Arad, and Samahoy are twelve miles round, and only separated at very high spring tides. They have a few date plantations on them, and about seven thousand five hundred inha bitants. There is very little water on them, most of that used being brought from Bahrein. There are two forts or Ghurees, one at Muharag, the other at Arad. Munama town is in lat. 26° 13' 50' N., long. 50° 36' 50' E. The Shaikh has five war Buggalows, but can fit out fifteen or twenty. One of these is of about four hundred tons, and mounts twenty-two guns. The fortifications are a Ghuree at Muharag, on a sandy point, containing six or eight guns, and commanding the channel; two others, one at Arad and another at Samahoy, and a ruinous wall round the town. Oh Bahrein are Raffar, seven miles from Munama, and about fifty other Ghurees, with a number of towers in different parts; but their best defences are those supplied by nature in the reefs that sur round the islands, as five hundred determined men might oppose the landing of as many thousands.

Jillia Shoal, or Arad Keef, surrounds the islands of Samahoy, Arad, and Muharag, and forms the southern side of the entrance to the north west harbour of Bahrein, and the northern to the south-eastern harbour. It is nearly dry in most parts at low-water. The north-western point is in lat. 26° 18' 40' N., long. 50° 37' 10' E.; the north-eastern in lat. 26° 18' 20'N., long. 50° 41'50' E..; and the south-eastern in lat. 26° 10' N., long. 50° 44' 10' E. The tide at times sets strong towards this reef. * A great portion of these articles was again exported to India, Muskat, and other parts; but they are not mentioned in the exports, which are confined to the produce of the island and fishery.570 NAVIGATION OF THE B luff G rove. A bluff grove of trees on Samahoy, generally called Arad Bluff, is a grove of date trees on the island of Samahoy, forming a bluff near the point. A small building stands on a mound near it. It is in lat. 26° 16' 50' N., long. 50° 39' 52' E. F asht al Y arron. Fasht al Yarron, or Teignmouth Shoal. This is one of the most extensive shoals in the Gulf, extending nearly nineteen miles in a northerly and southerly direction, and thirteen miles wide in an easter ly and westerly. It forms the northern boundary of the north-west port of Bahrein, and is nearly dry in most parts. The soundings within half a mile of it are from three to four fathoms, and it is very danger ous, being composed of hard rock and sand. To pass clear of the eastern end, when bound to Bahrein, keep Arad Bluff S. by W. until you get mid-channel between the Al Yarron and Jillia Shoals. The several parts of this shoal are in the following positions, viz. north point lat. 26° 32' 50' N., long. 50° 30' 38' E. ; east point, lat. 26° 29' N., long. 50° 39' E.; west point, lat. 26° 27' 20' N., long. 50°24' 20' E. ; south-eastern point, lat. 26° 22' 20' N., long. 50° 23' 50' E.; south western point, lat. 26° 15' 25' N., long. 50° 38' 10' E. GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR ENTERING THE NORTH-WESTERN PORT OF BAHREIN. After crossing the pearl bank (which do in the meridian of 50° 50' E.), and sighting Arad Bluff, steer for it, keeping it S. by W. or S. by W. i W. by compass, until you get to the southward of the Al Yarron or Teignmouth Shoal, or, if the Portuguese fort on Bahrein is visible, which it will be in moderately clear weather, bring it to bear SW. byS., when haul up about W. byN., or WNW., so as to keep the Al Yarron Shoal nearest to you, if the wind is fair, until the fort bears SSW. i W., or SSW. | W., being guided by your approach to the reefs; then steer right for it, until Arad Bluff bears SE. by E., when, if going into the inner harbour, keep it one point open on your starboard bow, until you near the inner harbour reef, which round. Your lead, and a good look-out, as the reef shows plain, must be your guides, taking care not to come undei three and a half fathoms towards the inner harbour reef, which round pretty close, and anchor within it in three and a half or lour fathoms, clay bottom. The reefs generally show themselves very plainly, except when in 111 ? ear ^§^' wa t er - I would always recommend ships entering the larboui at half ebb, or last quarter ebb, as all the dangers are■BBH GULF OF PERSIA. 571 then distinctly seen, but a stranger should not go in here without a pilot. To work in between the A1 Yarron and Jillia Shoals, you should not approach the former nearer than three and a half fathoms, and the latter than three fathoms. After passing the north-western point of the Jillia Shoal you may work into three fathoms, until you get Arad Bluff E. ^ S., when four fathoms to the westward and three to the eastward, until you approach the inner harbour reef. The western part of the north-western port of Bahrein is bounded by the A1 Yarron and a reef running off from Bahrein. There is a narrow channel between them, having only two fathoms in some parts. The south-eastern port of Bahrein is only used by boats, one part of the entrance being extremely narrow, and the navigation being intricate ; a pilot should be taken for this port, as clear directions cannot be possibly given. D emaum. Demaum is a small island on the southern side of Kateef Bay, with a small village abreast of it, both belonging to Rahmah bin Jaubir. The fort on the island is in lat. 26° 26' 30' N., long 50° 10' 30' E. T own and I sland of J irhoot. The town and island of Jirhoot are situated in the bottom of Kateef Bay ; the island is about four and a half miles long, and one broad. The town is in lat. 26° 33' 4' N., long. 50° 9' 5' E., and is about two and a half miles from the main, being separated by the channel to Kateef town. The island is thickly covered with date trees, and has several small forts besides the town. T own of K ateef. The town of Kateef is in lat. 26° 33' N., long. 50° 5' 5' E. It is situated at the back of the island of Jirhoot. There is, I believe, a channel for large boats to the town, but we were not allowed to examine it. This place belongs to the Chief of the Beni Khalid Tribe, who acknowledge the superiority of the Turks since the fall of Deriah. It has very little trade, as most of its dates supply the inland tribes. H as J amora. Ras Jamora, the north-western point of Kateef Bay, is in lat. 26° 36' 27' N., long. 50° 13' 52' E. ; variation 4° 50' W. It is a low point, with pretty good shelter under it in a north-wester. Within this point is a narrow gut, where small vessels may lie sheltered in all winds. To anchor within the point you should pass close to it, in three fathoms, U ■ 1572 NAVIGATION OF THE within one hundred yards, and as soon as round, come to and moor in three fathoms, the place being too narrow to lay at single anchor. K as A llaly. Ras Allaly is in lat. 26° 48 / 20' N., long. 49° 59' 17' E. It is rather high, and forms the southern point of Dooat Booally or JBooally Bay. Between this and Gebil Rnmmul is a very remarkable black rock, situated about three miles from the beach. G ebil R ummul. Gebil Rnmmul is in lat. 26° 55' 40' N., long. 49° 37' 30' E. It is a high, sandy mountain, situated about fifteen miles inland, and nearly opposite to Ras Booally, The Bay of Booally is within these, and has deep water, but there are a number of shoal patches extending from the shore to the distance of two or three miles. R as B ooally. Ras Booally is in lat. 27° 17' 22' N., long. 49° 41' 15' E. It is a low point, forming the south-eastern point of the island of the same name, and the north-western entrance to a bay bearing its name. It may be known by a small ruin about a quarter of a mile from its point. A spit runs near three miles off this cape. J ezeerat G inua. Jezeerat Ginua forms the south-eastern entrance of this inlet. It is in lat. 27° 21' 56' N., long. 49° 20' 55' E. It is above twenty-five feet above the level of the sea, and formed of sandstone rock. Between tins and Jezeerat Booally is a deep bight, but full of shoals, so as to render it unnavigable even for boats. R as M oosalame. Ras Moosalame is in lat. 27° 23' 28' N,, long. 49° 19' 50' E. It is alow point, and forms the north-western entrance of a small inlet of the same name, within which is an island of this name, inhabited by about five hundred men of the Beni Khalid Tribe, under two Shaikhs, ac knowledging the authority of the Shaikh of Kateef.

Remarks on the Coast from Khore el Ktiffagee to Ras Mush ah.— From Khore el Kuffagee to Ras Mushab this coast is safe and clear, except two small shoals off the latter. In running down, after passing Khore el Kuffagee, you should get into the stream of twelve fathoms, and not come under until you reach Gebil, when it is necessary to keep out to sea, and run out in the stream of eighteen fathoms, keeping a sharp look-out ahead for shoal spots, the coast being fronted from Ras Mushab to Ras-ool-Ghar with patches dry in many parts, and having deep water between them ; but in some parts they do not show themselves. It is dangerous to get near them with the wind blowing hard on the shore, as a very heavy sea runs, and every winter numbers of the na tive vessels get wrecked about this dangerous part of the coast. The northern part of this dangerous bank of shoals is in lat. about 28° 14' SO'' N., and long. 48° 45' SO' 1 ' E., and continues without intermission to Ras Baldana, which is a dry point of the reef in lat. 27° 52' N., long. 49° 9' 30' 7 E. After this they become now detached, but it is unsafe to come near the coast until you pass Ras-ool-Ghar, when it becomes now clear, and you may near it to seven fathoms until you reach Ras Moo- salame, from whence it will be necessary to keep out in eight fathoms until you get near Ras Booally, from which a long spit extends. After passing it, you may keep in any depth from eight to ten fathoms, until you reach Ras Tannora, the north-western point of Kateef Bay. J ezeerat O malmaradain. Jezeerat Omalmaradain is in lat. 28° 40' 33' N., long. 48° 34' 40' 7 E. It is low, and about one-third of a mile long.

Remarks. —Leaving Grane, and bound down the Arabian Coast to the southward, the first place you come to is Ras-ool-Lur, or Ras-ool- Lund. It is in lat. 29° 21 / 15' N., long. 48° 4' 40' E., and forms the southern point of Grane Haven. The water is deep near it, and you may round it at a distance of a quarter of a mile. The point is low and sandy. From this to Aboo Fatiera, a small village, the coast is little elevated, and safe to approach to a few hundred yards, there being seven fathoms close to the beach. G rane T own. Grane Town (or Koweit), called by the Natives Al Quaat, is in lat. 29° 22' 52 // N., long. 47° 40' 40'' E., or 25° 15' 20' W. of Bombay, or 7° 39' 20' W. of Bassadore Point, in the Persian Gulf, It is a place of much importance, owing to the maritime spirit of its inhabit ants. It has a considerable trade of its own, supplying most of the inland tribes with grain, coffee, and Indian produce. They are also the carriers for Bussora, and many other parts of the Gulf. There are belonging to the port fifteen large Buggalows and Dows, from four hundred and fifty to one hundred tons ; twenty Buteels and Buggalows, from one hundred and twenty to fifty tons ; and about one hundred and fifty trading boats, from one hundred and fifty to fifteen tons. They navigate the Gulf of Persia, Red Sea, Coasts of Sind, Guzerat, and Malabar, and to Bombay, Their imports consist of several articles of Indian produce, such as piece goods, rice, sugar, timber, spices, and cotton from India; coffee from the Red Sea | tobacco and dried fruits from Persia 5 grain and576 NAVIGATION OF THE dates from Bussora ; cloth, dates, and fish from Bahrein. Their exports are ghee and horses, from the inland tribes, and for other articles take specie, which they receive from the inland tribes in return for the articles imported. The Government is despotic, and vested in the Shaikh, who acknow ledges the Turkish Government, and pays a small tribute. The inhabitants are about six thousand in number, of the Uttoebee Tribe, and strict Mahomedans. The present Shaikh, Jaubir bin Abdoolla bin Souba, is about fifty-one years of age, and is very intelligent. He succeeded his father, Abdoolla bin Souba, in 1812, and is much respected among his own people, and many of the inland tribes. The family of the Shaikh is ancient, they having been Shaikhs of a small tribe for four or five centuries, and first settled at Grane under Shaikh Ruheembaright about eighty years since, and built a small village. He governed them after this about ten years, and much increased his followers. He was succeeded by his brother, Souba, who built a wall round the village, and founded the present town. He governed about six years, and was succeeded by his son, Abdoolla bin Souba, under whose long and mild government the popu lation was very much increased, and the maritime spirit to which it owes its present respectability took its rise. He died in 1812, after governing them for fifty years, much regretted, and was succeeded by his son Jaubir, the present Shaikh. They acknowledge the authority of the Turks, and pay a tribute of forty bags of rice and four hundred frazils of dates annually. The Shaikh also receives an honorary dress from the Turkish Government yearly. they have enjoyed peace while all other parts of the Gulf have been embroiled, and to this they owe their maritime greatness. Cattle are to be procured good, but very dear. From Grane to Khore el Kuffagee, along the Arabian Coast, the authority of the Shaikh of Grane is partially acknowledged by the Bedouin Tribe, who are mostly of the A1 Ali, and a branch of the Beni Khalid, and some wandering parties of other tribes | also some few stiaggling camps of the Montific Tribe, who come this way at certain seasons. The amount of imports to Grane is said to be about five lakhs of dollars, the exports are under one lakh. The variation of the compass at Giane in 1S24 was 5° 22' W. Grane also takes a share in the pearl fishery. Ohar Island.

If working, you may stand close over to the main, there being from four to seven fathoms within a few hundred yards of the beach, and four fathoms towards Pheleechi, after passing Rassul ; and do not approach nearer than seven fathoms on the Grane side, and work to four on the opposite. In passing Ras Toosa (which forms the low point near the town), do not approach nearer than a mile and a half; when past it, haul in a little towards the town, and anchor off it in any depth from seven to ten fathoms. M uchan I sland, Muchan island is a small dry sandbank, between Pheleechi and the main. P heleechi I sland. # The town of Pheleechi is in lat. 19° 26' 25' N., long. 48° 15' 50' E. The island is eighteen miles round, low, and surrounded by a mud flat, running off for a considerable distance, but shoals regularly in approach ing it. Tolerable water is procured here, also a few sheep, fish, and poultry. It has about four or five hundred inhabitants, who are mostly fishermen, and are subject to the Shaikh of Grane, one of whose relations is Shaikh or governor. The western point of the entrance to the river Euphrates is in lat. 29° 55' 40' N., long. 48° 27' 18' E. It is very low, and scarcely discernible beyond three or four miles. It is nearly surrounded by a mud flat, running off to the southward for six or seven miles, nearly dry at low-water. The ground is clammy, and covered in most seasons with short grass and rushes, and is inhabited by straggling parties of Arabs, who reside about there principally for the sake of pasture for their cattle. On the Euphrates side of the point the water appears to be rather gaining on the land, but on the side towards Khore Abdoolla the land appears to gain upon the sea; and from the information I have received from the pilots, and other intelligent natives, the mud flat on this side has extended considerably of late years, so that in a few years more what is now a mud flat, covered at spring tides, will probably be firm ground. The increase of the land on the side of Khore Abdoolla is also much greater than the loss on the side of the river. This remark, from all the information I have been able to obtain, applies equally to the opposite bank of the river, where the land is gaining ground. Khore Abofalla is nearly separated from the Euphrates by the above point, and when laying in one you may, from the top, see the masts of the vessels plainly in the other. The Khore is navigable to Woorba Island, * Vide also report on this island by Lieutenant J. Felix Jones, I. N v at pages 52 to 54 of this Selection.578 NAVIGATION OF THE where it divides into two branches, one called Khore Shetna, formed by Woorba Island and the main, which continues navigable for large boats above Bussora, and is supposed to be the canal described by Ar- rian in the voyage of Nearchus. The other branch is called Khore Boobian, for in the island of that name, which forms the western bank of both this and Khore Abdoolla, it is here narrow, but safe, having deep water in it, and after passing Woorba Island it branches off to the south ward. It runs this way (and is not more than half a mile wide) with from three to seven fathoms at low-water spring tides, until it again enters the Gulf near the islands of Muchan and Pheleechi, when the passage is very intricate, owing to the number of knolls, nearly dry, and can only be used by the native boats at half flood. (The whole of these Khores are salt water). Nearly in the centre, but rather towards the eastern entrance of Khore Abdoolla, is an extensive and very dangerous shoal, called by the natives Fashtal Aich. The channel on the western side is formed by it and Boobian Khore el Giet. It has from three to five fathoms in it. Khore Abdoolla has regular soundings from three to eight fathoms. Ras-ool-Giet is the north-eastern point of Boobian Island. The western point of Khore el Giet is in lat. 29 0 46 / 53' N., long. 48° 17' oO E. From this to the island of Pheleechi the flat extends a consi derable distance oft shore, and Boobian Island should not be approach ed nearer than five fathoms, as the in-draught of the flood is so great that a a esse] would find it difficult to get an offing in a south-easter. You may anchor in any depth from four to six fathoms off Pheleechi, with the town SW.by W., but recollect the rise and fall are eleven feet.

In case of necessity, a small vessel being driven into Khore Gufgah in a south-easter, and parting from her cables', might run for it at high-water, but 1 cannot recommend it except in case of necessity. Meyune Sand. Meyune Sand, commonly called Bussora Bar, is in lat. 29° 49' 20' N., long. 48° 35' 57' E. Its southern point, measured trigonometrically from the western point of the river, e. by n., distant rather more than one mile, is a small hard sandbank, with only three feet on it at low- water. Between it and the Meyune is a small channel, running into the river, with soundings nearly the same as the regular channel; but it is easily found out if you are in this channel, as you will have hard soundings on the western side, whereas in the proper channel the ground is soft to the westward on the Abdoolla Bank. Care should be taken not to approach this bank in a south-easter and flood tide. Variation 4° 55' W. in 1827. Abdoolla Bank. The Abdoolla Bank, or Mahrugaate Abdalla, is a long mudbank, forming the western side of the channel into the Euphrates. It extendi to lat. 29 46 / N., long. 48° 36' 10''' E., and is dry at low-water spring tides to within about two and a half miles of the bar. It is safe to ap proach in working up the river to three fathoms, or two fathoms and three quarters. Mahrugaate Abadan. Mahrugaate Abadan is the eastern bank forming the entrance to the river, and is composed of hard sand, except towards the southern part, wheie it is a mixture of hard sand and stiff clay. Its southern point is in lat. 29° 45^' N., long. 48° 42' 40' / E. It is not safe to approach in working up on the flood tides nearer than three and a half fathoms ; or immediately you shoal from mid-channel, and find the bottom getting hard, the helm should be put down. Khore Gufgah. The entrance to Khore Gufgah is in lat. 29° 46' N., long. 48° 44' E. It is formed by the Abadan on the west, and Ali Meidan on the east; has soundings from fifteen and eighteen fathoms in the southern part to two and a half at low-water at the upper, where a narrow channel runs into the Euphrates. This is an excellent mark, coming from the eastward, for making the river. If you cross the Ali Meidan in three and a half fathoms low-water, you will cross Khore Gufgah in eight or nine fa thoms, and ought to keep down to the southward a little, as this is in the parallel of the Meyune. If you cross the Ali Meidan in four or four and a half fathoms, which is the best line, you will cross Khore580 NAVIGATION OF THE Gufgah in thirteen to fifteen or sixteen fathoms, according to the time of tide, and the tail of the Abadan in four to five fathoms, when a course west, if a flood tide, will bring you on the Abdoolla Bank, two and a half or three fathoms low-water, which is a fair berth for anchoring if the lide is not favourable for entering the river, as from this you can always run into Khore Abdoolla if it comes to blow hard from the SE., at which time no pilot will cross the bar. A li M eidan. Ali Meidan is an extensive flat of mud and sand, extending from lat. 29° 46' N., long. 48° 46' SCT E., to lat. 29° 55' N., long. 49° 5' E. From the shore the soundings are from seven fathoms on the southern part to two fathoms at five miles off shore. The soundings on this flat are regular, which has got it the name of Meidan : they scarcely vary, except at the edges, in the same parallel, all over the bank. The pilots always try to cross the bank in four or five fathoms, when bound to the river. K iiore B ameshebe.

It was formerly used by trading vessels, and was navigable a consi derable way up ; but is now blocked by a bund near the Haffar Canal. It runs in from the Ali Meidan, the soundings not varying more than a quarter of a fathom, until you get as high as lat. about 29° 51 A 30'' N., when they deepen to five and seven fathoms, according to the time of tide, and decrease again to three and four fathoms at low -water as you near the points.

In standing along it, three and a half and four fathoms is a guide in the day, but you should not come under five fathoms in the night. BUSHIRE. The flagstaff of the Residency at Bushire is in lat. 29° 0' 15' N., long. 50 51' 30' E. It is a town of considerable importance, being themm GULF OF PERSIA. 585 port where all the British and foreign trade with Persia centres. It is walled in, and about two miles in circumference. Its bazar is well supplied from the country with all sorts of provisions and fruits, and a number of merchants reside here, who carry on a very extensive trade ; caravans arrive and depart daily. There is no water in the town that is drinkable—all is brought from places about two or three miles distant. The Shaikh or governor has, in addition to Bushire, all the places on the coast from Bunda Dellim to Halilla, under his authority, and several places fifteen or sixteen miles inland. His government is despotic in the extreme, and having four ships, besides several large Buggalows, of his own, he engrosses most of the freight, as he will not allow the mer chants to ship their goods on any other vessel until his are loaded. The anchorage is in a road formed by two banks, two and a half miles off' the town, having from four to two and a half fathoms at low-water, soft muddy bottom. The following directions will conduct a ship into the roads, should she not be able to obtain a pilot; but I should always recommend a pilot being obtained:— 1 1 IE DIRECTIONS FOR GOING INTO BUSIIIRE INNER ROADS, A ship coming from the northward, with a northerly wind, should stand along' the bank extending off Rohilla Point in a line of four fathoms, until she gets the flagstaff to bear N, 77° E., shipping in the inner roads N, 41° E,, or the Old House or Sand Island N. 47° E. ; then haul up N. 57° E. (in doing which you will cross over hard sand), until the flagstaff bears E., Old House N. 46° E., shipping N. 39° E. (In crossing the hard sand, should a vessel decrease her water to less than two and a half falhorns, she should bear away more for the town, and haul up immediately she increases that depth.) When the above bearings are on, haul up as high as N. 19° E., carrying soundings from two and three quarters to three fathoms, until the flagstaff bears S. 45° E., Old House N. 60° E., shipping N. 62° E. You may then with the ebb tide bear away for the shipping, keeping a good look-out for the point of the reef, which is nearly dry at low-water; but should the flood be running, it would be advisable for a vessel to keep up about three quarters of a point to windward of the shipping, and bear away when the point is abreast of her. A ship coming from the southward, with a southerly breeze, may stand along the low land in a line of three and a half or four fathoms until the flagstaff bears N. 37° E., shipping N, 12° E., House on Shaikh Shaad N. 28° E. ; then bear away N. 4° E. until the flagstaff bears S. 36° E., shipping N. 52° E., Old House N. 51° E. (In standing along this course, a ship will decrease her soundings at low*water to two and aa 586 NAVIGATION OF THE I-Hi I ■■If 1 t ■' ii half fathoms, then increase to four and a half fathoms, with the above bearings on.) She may then haul up for the shipping. The marks for the shipping in the inner roads are given in case of it being too hazy to see the old house on the northern end of Shaikh Shaad Island.

To the NVV. of the town are very extensive ruins, said to have been a Portuguese town: if so, it must have been one of importance, from the appearance of the ruins. In many parts the rock has been excavated for residences in the hot season, and the pass in the hills appears to have been fortified in a manner much beyond the abilities of the natives, at least of the present day. Wells have been also sunk to the depth of forty or fifty fathoms, through the rock. Very high up on the hills reservoirs in ruins are very numerous.

They have a number of trading vessels, and take a share in the pearl fishery. The only export is tobacco, brought down from the interior. The town is fronted by a reef, about one thousand yards off shore, within which is a basin with one and a half and two fathoms water, where their boats lay. The anchorage before the town is good in a south-easter, but a very heavy sea rolls in in a north-wester. About two miles and a half up the bay from the town, with Aseeloo Notch bearing N. 12° to N. 15° W., in three and a half or four fathoms, you lie pretty well sheltered.

In towards the bank, that runs off the shore all round to the distance of one thousand yards, the ground is generally clay or mud, but in the middle of the bay hard sand, with patches of rock. There is no danger whatever within it, or at the entrance. The shore abreast of Nakle Taky and Aseeloo should not be approached under seven fathoms. After the Notch bears N., you may keep in any depth to three and a half fathoms, and with the Notch from N. 10° to N. 15° W. is the best anchorage for a ship in a north-wester, from three to four fathoms, mud. In a south-easter you are sheltered in all parts of the bay. N akle H aghel. Nakle Haghel is a small village, with a tower, in lat. 27° 23' 18' N,, long. 52° 43' 15' E.

S hitwar, or C hitwar. Shitwar, or Chitwar, is a small island, separated from Busheab by a narrow channel, having three or four fathoms in it. The passasre is about one-third over from Shitwar, but as the spit from Busheab runs some distance out past the island, it is not considered safe, unless to persons who have been through it before, as the reef does not always show, and the soundings have little or no change until you arc upon it. ihe west point of Shitwar is in lat. 26° 47' 19' N., long. 53° 16 / 5V E.

There is no danger outside five fathoms towards the island, or four fathoms on the spit, the channel between these having from twenty-two to seven fathoms. The narrowest part is between the island and Cheroo Reef, being there only one mile wide. A course one-third over from the island, in passing Ras-ool-Cheroo, will be found the best. R as-ool -C heroo. Ras-ool-Cheroo, in lat. 26° 41' SI'' N., long. 53° 36' 38^ E., is a long, low, projecting sandy point, and forms the Bay of Cheroo. A sandy reef runs off from it in a WSW. direction, with soundings of from one and a half to five fathoms on it ; but there is no danger on it in or outside three and a half fathoms, as it shoals after you are on it gradually to that depth. Outside of six fathoms the water suddenly deepens to ten, thirteen, and seventeen fathoms. C heroo. Cheroo village is in lat. 26° 42' 15'' N., long. 53° 46' 2' E. It is situated at the bottom of a bay, formed by the Ras or Cape of the same name. It contains about one hundred and fifty men, of the Abadaly Tribe ; the Shaikh resides at another village inland. It was formerly, as well as Inderabia, subject to Nakheeloo, but threw off the yoke about eight months since. It is thg best anchorage in a north-wester in the Gulf, and aflords tolerable supplies and water. It has a few trading boats. M ornington's S hoal, or S umburo. Mornington's Shoal, or Sumburo, is in lat. 26° 32' 43' N., long. 53 46 2 E. It has not less than six fathoms on it, and deepens gradually into twenty-two. It is about one mile long, and rather more than half a mile broad, composed of sand and coral rock.

It *GULF OF PERSIA. has three villages : one on the north-east side, called Daee, is exactly one mile west of our latitude and longitude station. The island has plenty of good water, and many of the wells are near the beach. The fleet composing the expedition against the pirates in 1820 watered here,, and it was found fully competent to supply a much larger demand. The soil is good, but in consequence of there having been no rain the last season, there is at this time little verdure. Barley and vegetables are cultivated, and off the island abundance of very fine fish is caught. The island is twenty-one miles in circumference, and safe to approach to eight fathoms all round. A reef projects off the island nearly all round, having from five to one and a half fathoms water. On the outer edge you have eight fathoms, soft ground, and immediately shoal to five fathoms, so that no vessel ought to come nearer than eight fathoms. It extends furthest off the west end, the outer part being one milo offshore; at no other part does it extend beyond half a mile, and the soundings are regular towards it. The variation at this place was. 3° 40' W. (February 5lh, 1827.) C harrak H ill. Charrak Hill, in lat. 26° 38' 7' N., long. 54° 9'54' E.

The channel between Kenn and the Main is seven miles wide, in ita narrowest part, with soundings of from thirty-six to five fathoms. In working through it, ten fathoms towards the island, and fourteen or fifteen fathoms towards the main, will be good guides in the night j in the day you may stand in close to the shore on the main, and to seven or eight fathoms towards the island. Ihere is no danger on the main but a small spit near Gella Abade, which does not extend above three- quarters of a mile offshore. T awoona. Tawoona, in lat. 26° 42' 15' N., long. 54° 15' E., is a small town at the entrance of Charrak Bay, situated round the fort, which is built on a rock near the beach, and is inhabited by about one hundred and e i§|hty men, of the Beni Baphar Tribe.

Charrak, in lat. 26° 42' 52' / N., long. 54° 11' 16' E., is situated al? the bottom of the bay of the same name. It is a place of some trade, and has six Buggalows, from sixty to one hundred and twenty tons, and twenty smaller trading vessels, belonging to it. It contains about nine598 NAVIGATION OF THE hundred men, of the A1 Ali Tribe. About three hundred and sixty of these are fighting men ; the remainder fishermen and traders. Supplies can be procured here, as well as pretty good water. These people being of the same tribe as the pirates of Amulgavine, were closely connected with them during the time they were in force. Djrd. Djrd, in lat. 26° 39' 15' 7 N., long. 54° 25' 40' E., is a small village on the Charrak side of Cape Djrd or Certes, and contains one hundred men, of the A1 Ali Tribe. It has a few small trading boats, but the people are principally fishermen. Ras-ool-Djrd, or Cape Certes. Ras-ooI-Djrd, or Cape Certes, in lat. 26° 35' 52' N., long. 54° 26' 6' 1 j ., is a high projecting headland, when viewed at a distance, but when close terminates rather abruptly in a low point. It forms the south eastern point of Charrak Bay, and the western point of Mogoo Bay. A reef runs oft this point rather more than three-quarters of a mile. A ship, in rounding it, should not come under five fathoms. Charrak Bay. Charrak Bay is about four miles deep, and formed by Ras-ool-Djrd on one pait, and Ras Tawoona on the other. The soundings are from twelve to three fathoms to a mile off the shore : under that distance, except near Charrak town, the ground is foul, and some small patches of rocks lay scattered about. Mogoo. Mogoo, in lat. 26° 35' 9' N, long. 54° 25' 34' E, is the western town in the bay of the same name, situated nearest to Ras-ool-Djrd.

Ras Bostana is a low point, in lat. 26° 28' 30' N., long. 54° 40' E., forming the south-east point of Mogoo Bay. It is safe to round at L distance of three quarters of a mile, in six or seven fathoms. M ogoo B ay. Mogoo Bay, formed by Ras-ool-Djrd on the western side, and Ras Bostana on the south-east, is a deep bay, with soundings from nine to three fathoms, and has good anchorage in north-westers abreast the town of Mogoo, in four fathoms, with Ras-ool-Dird bearine- about W.|N. 6 B ostana. Bostana is a small village, in lat. 26° 29' 52' N., long. 54° 35' 44 // E. A few supplies may be obtained here. It contains a hundred men, of the Manzeek Tribe, principally employed in fishing. P olior S hoal. The centre, or shoalest part of Polior Shoal, is in lat. 26° 26' 5' N., long. 54° 37' 15' E. It is distant from the low point of Ras Bostana thiee miles, and from the north point of Polior Island seven miles. A line carried from the centre of Polior to the low point of Ras Bostana passes over the two and a quarter fathom patch. The shoal is com posed of sand and rocks, and is six miles long, and two miles broad, extending in a westerly, south-easterly, and northerly direction. The channel on either side is safe, but for large ships that next to the island is the best, and they should not come under sixteen fathoms towards the shoal at night. The inshore channel has from seven to eleven fathoms in it, regular soundings. P olior I sland. The north point of Polior Island is in lat. 26° 20' 30'' N., long. 54° 36' E., the south point in lat. 26° 15 7 30' N., long. 54° 35 / 15' E. The island is apparently of volcanic origin, and has no water. A rocky patch extends a mile off the north-east end, with soundings of from seven and eight fathoms to one fathom. On the south-eastern side you may anchor close to the shore, sheltered from a north-wester, but it would be unsafe in the event of a sudden change of wind to the south east, as the anchorage is so close to the shore that there would be very great risk of the vessel being thrown on the rocks. N obeuze, or N obfleure. The centre of Nobeuze, or Nobfleure, is in lat. 26° 11' 30' N., long. 54° 30' 40 // E. It is a small island, with a high lump hill on its centre. It is surrounded by a reef, having from one and a half to600 NAVIGATION OF THE seven fathoms on it. Outside the reef you may anchor in sixteen or twenty fathoms ; it should not be approached nearer than twenty-five fathoms, unless you intend to anchor, and in the day-time. SURDE, OR SURDY. The south-east point of Surde or Surdy is in lat. 25° 56' N., long 54° 38' 40' E. It is an island formed something the same as most in the Gulf, being composed of coarse rocks and sand, with very little soil. A mile and a quarter to the westward of the south-east point are tke ruins of a town, and nearly in a line to the northward, on the oppo- site side of the island, are the ruins of another town, and a mosque; there are also wells of fresh water on the north-western part of the island. This island, it is said, had once near a thousand inhabitants, but was depopulated by the pirates. There is anchorage nearly all round the island, but the ground is rocky, and bad for holding; the best is to the southward. The island is surrounded by a reef, extend ing two-thirds of a mile off shore. The island is about four miles long, and two and a quarter broad. B ostana to S hinas. From Bostana to Shinas the land is low, and safe to approach to about one mile, in six or seven fathoms. S hinas.

The imports are arti cles of Indian produce, dates, and grain. Supplies are procurable here. The people are mostly Wahabees, and the Shaikh is of the Joasmee Tribe, and nearly related to Sultan bin Suggur, the chief of the tribe, and were always connected with the pirates. The anchorage, abreast the town, in six fathoms, is well sheltered in a north-wester, but a chop- ping sea comes in in a south-easter. There is a basin, dry inside at low-water, where most of their boats lay up. They are not bigoted, and the Shaikh appeared a very intelligent man. The place is much increasing as a trading port. K oong. Koong is in lat. 26° 34' 40' / N., long. 55° 1' 80' E. It is now in ruins, but was formerly a flourishing place. The Portuguese had a factory here when in power in the Gulf. Good water is easily procur able. Here you lay near the shore in six fathoms. B under M ullim. Bunder Mullim is in lat. 26° SS' 20' N., long. 55° 9' 20'' E. It is a small town, under Ras Showly, and has a trade in salt. It has about three hundred inhabitants. The bank on the Persian side, forming the channel into Bassadore, begins to shoal off this place. L ittle T omb. The centre of the Little Tomb is in lat. 26° 14' 50 v N., long. 55° 16' E. It is moderately elevated, is about a mile and a half in length, and has irregular soundings from twenty-eight to five fathoms. There is no danger near it. G reat T omb. The north point of the Great Tomb is in lat. 26° 16' 2S ,/ N., long. 55° 24' E. The island is of an irregular triangle, the three sides being about two and a half miles each. The island is well stocked with antelopes, and there is good water on it. A banian tree stands in about the centre of the southern side. The anchorage is pretty good to the south-east and west, but on the northern part a spit runs off about three quarters of a mile, otherwise that part is steep. To the channel be tween it and two and a half fathoms, on the Bassadore flat, is seven and a quarter miles, but the safe channel is not more than six and a half, as the bank shoals very suddenly at this part. A S mall S hoal. A small shoal patch, with six fathoms on it, bears nearly N. from the Little Tomb, distant eleven miles, in lat. 26° 25' SO' lono- 55° 15' 40'E. ^002 NAVIGATION OF THE B omosa. The Peak or Saddle of Bomosa is in lat. 25° 55' N., long. 55° 8'50' E. This island is low, except the remarkable saddle peak, and some small hummocks. It is surrounded by a reef near a mile off, and indif^ ferent anchorage may be found under it. Bassadore. The Point of Bassadore is in lat. 26° 39' 10' N., long. 55° 22' E. It is the north-western point of Kishm Island, and bears N. 17° 20' W. from the south-west point of the island, and from the Great Tomb N. 4° W true bearing. The variation of the compass was 3° 41' in 1827. This place was once a flourishing Portuguese settlement, and the ruins of the town are still in existence. In 1821, the force stationed in the Gu f for keeping down the pirate tribes was removed to this place from oallack, and was withdrawn in 1823; since when it has been the head quarters of the Indian Naval Squadron in the Gulf. They have a tolerable hospital and storehouses, and some houses occupied occasionally by the commanders of the vessels stationed there. There is a small bazar, and middling supplies. The place is the most healthy on tie island of Kishm, but far from being a desirable station. 1° go into Bassadore from the southward with a fair wind, after the rea omb bears SSE. J E., steer over the flat NW, by N. to NNW., 1 in a avge ship; and while the Tomb is in sight, keep it SSE. until Bassadore Pent bears NE. J E. ; then steer, keeping it a little open on ie staiboard bow. If you deepen to eight or nine fathoms, edge over ic noit ern bank until you begin to shoal again, keeping a good look-out for the beacon on the point of the dry part of the southern bank, and distant about thirteen hundred yards from the Point. You may i } llk ' 1 at distance fiom a cable-length to a quarter of a mile, when haul in for the anchorage abreast of the hospital, or a little above in seven fathoms. You should be careful to be ready to anchor im- edlately you are across the gut, which has twelve to sixteen fathoms n, and is immediately without the anchoring ground. in iV'T'TI fr0m th . e Great Tomb, there is a remarkable notch m , , ^ 1 a , n 0 ^ P ers * an Coast, which, if seen, is an excellent tear Ni xT ng u N - 'y w - i W. by compass, until Bassadore Point j ' NJl - I E., when proceed as above. fla cW^ f T th !

To sail into Bassadore from the northward, after passing Lin-ah with a fair wind, steer about E. by N. to ENE., until Bassadore Point is seen, when steer for it, attending to the directions given above. When coming from the southward, the soundings in the channel are from eight to three and a half fathoms, until you approach Bassadore, when they deepen as before described. There is another passage along the island of Kishm, and within the shoal part of the Bassadore fiat, by keeping along shore in four to six fathoms until the large hummock bears N. 73° E., true bearing, and Bassadore Point N. 12° E. true, when steer across the bank W. by N., or W. by N. | N., until you deepen over it, or the notch on the Persian Coast bears N.by W. | W., when proceed as above directed. I would not recommend this channel except in cases of chase, or other necessity, unless to a person well acquainted with it. Clarence Straits. Leaving Bassadore to proceed through Clarence Straits, weigh, if you have a fair wind, at slack water, and steer about N. by E. until you shoal into about five fathoms on the northern bank, when keep along about E. in five to six fathoms, on the edge of that bank, until you get the date grove at Drakoon to bear true S. 26° E. This carries you safely past Goree, a shoal of hard sand, on which there is not more in some parts than a fathom and a half. After passing this you may steer along the Kishm shore at a distance of a little more than half a mile, until Lucy's Peak, on the island of Kishm, bears S. 44° E. true bearing, when you are off the entrance of the narrow straits or Khore Goran, when, if going through them, steer towards the mosque, keeping it a little open on your starboard bow. The soundings between the banks until you enter the jungle are five to seven fathoms. You must now be guided by your distance from the shore, keeping most on the larboard shore until you pass the second opening or channel on that side ; then keep rather nearest the starboard shore, or near to mid-channel, until you open into the main channel beyond Inderabia Fort, on the Kishm shore To proceed through the main strait, or Khore Manaffee, you should keep rather towards the larboard bank, in soundings of from six to eight fathoms, until you pass a dry sandy islet off the islands fronting Kammeer ; then run along the island at a distance of a quarter of a mile, in soundings of from seven to ten fathoms, until you get to the end of it, when you will see the fort of Inderabia on Kishm, bearing true S. 47° E.; then steer for the extreme point of the island of KishnT keeping m soundings of from six to fifteen fathoms. When you have' 78G04 NAVIGATION OF THE g ' j ' ■jg^'iiWl ■rng: f W closed to the Kishm shore, steer about E. by S. i S., until off the village of Peypusht, attending particularly to your soundings, and not comin^ under six fathoms. You may now steer along the Kishm shore in soundings of from six to twelve or thirteen fathoms, at a distance of a large quarter of a mile, until you come to the village of Durgaum You must now steer out NE. by E. i E. to NE. by E.: this will carry you out of the straits, in soundings of from six to eleven fathoms. M osha. Mosha is a village opposite Bassadore, with a few inhabitants, mostly fishermen and wood-cutters. From this to the commence- ment of the jungles the coast is uninhabited. The jungles begin about thirteen miles above this place, and continue on the Persian side to about lat. 26° 57' 30' N., long. 55° 47' E. K ammeer. Kammeer is in lat. 26° 56' 40' / N., long. 55° 40' 20' E., and belongs to the Tmaum of Muskat. It has large mines of sulphur, and very large quantities are annually exported. A n old M osque.

Ormus was an island formerly the grand emporium of the Portuguese commerce and power in the Gulf of Persia and Coast of Arabia. The fort, built by the Portuguese, is in lat. 27° 5' 55' N., long. 56° 29' 5' E. It js a barren rocky island, covered with salt, except the north-east part, which is low and sandy. It has no water, except what is saved in reservoirs during the rains. There are a number of these reservoirs in good repair, and the ruins of some hundreds, which show what the place has been. The old Portuguese lighthouse is still standing, though last falling to decay. Large quantities of salt are exported from this island to all parts of the Gulf, and Coasts of Arabia; the Imaum of Muskat, to whom it belongs, keeps a garrison of about one hundred men in the fort. There are about four hundred inhabitants, mostly employed in the salt trade, and as fishermen; they are strict Mahomedans. There is good anchorage to the eastward of the fort in a north-wester, and to the westward in a south-easter. I sland of K ishm. The island of Kishm (Jazeerat Towile of the Arabs, Jazeerat JDras of the Persians, and the Oaracta of Arrian) was visited by Nearchus in his voyage from the Indus to the Euphrates. Arrian states that at that time it produced abundance of corn, vines, and fruit of all descriptions. I he Greeks, with their usual superstition, stated the tomb of the first monarch of the island, named Erythras, was then in existence, and from which they named the Gulf the Erythrian Sea. The island is fifty-four miles long, and thirty-two wide in the broadest part, and nine in the narrowest. Before the pirates became so powerful, it had about seventy small towns and villages, and a population of about twenty thousand inhabitants. A very great part of these were weavers ; others cultivated the soil ; and others were fishermen. Most of these were destroyed, or obliged to seek shelter elsewhere, during the time the pirates were' in power : many are now returning ; but the island will never be what it is said to have been again. It belongs to the Imaum of Muskat. G oree. Goree is a small village, producing a few dates, vegetables, and other supplies, about five miles from Bassadore.

Goram is a small village, said to have formerly been a Portuguese station, at the entrance of the straits of the same name ; it may be known by an old mosque. There are some reservoirs, and after rain there is plenty of good water here. Luft. Luft is a fortified village or town on the side of a hill, at the eastern entrance of Khore Goram. It had several towers and a wall down one side the hill, besides a Ghuree. Colonel Smith and Captain Wain- nght, in 1809, despising their enemy, thought to carry it at once by escalade, but they were beaten off with considerable loss, and the men obliged to lay on the beach, not being able to embark them for the em mj s fire. Die Fury and other cruisers were now brought in, and with the gunboats battered the place, when, after some time, it surren- ered. Luft now contains only about two hundred inhabitants, has a e\y boats, and is the residence of the principal Shaikh on the island, t is in lat. 26° 53' N., long. 55° 51' 10' E. Remarks on the Navigation, 8fc. from Goram to Luft.—The whole o the centre, between Kishm and the Persian Coast, is full of small jungle islands, some having narrow channels, with six and eight at oms water, between them. Up these the wood boats go, and this place supplies about three-fourths of the Gulf with firewood. Inderabia.

Most of its inhabitants are sailors and fishermen; the former employ themselves on board the vessels belong ing to Muskat, and other parts of the Gulf. A number of villages in various parts of the island are under the government of the Shaikh of this place. It was here, during the panic consequent on Captain Thompson's failure at Beni Boo Ali, the troops were removed, and were perched on a rock, where I have known a thermometer to burst at 160° when suspended to a tent rope. After five or six officers, and half the men, had died, they were removed to Sallack. The anchorage is good m a north-wester, but a chopping sea comes in with a south easter - a bank runs in front of the town. I sland of L arrack. The island of Larrack is in lat. 26° 53' 30'' N., long. 54° 25' 10' E. The fort is on the north side; the island has water on it, and is barren. Good anchorage may be found under it in a north-wester or south- easter. B under S husa. Bunder Shusa is a small bay, twelve miles from the point off Kishm608 NAVIGATION OF THE town. To the westward it is fronted by two or three rocky islets, on the largest of which is a reservoir for water. Inside there is a fathom and a half and two fathoms water at low tide ; native vessels take shelter here in blowing weather. This I consider to be Nearchus' second anchorage on the island of Oaracta, on the ninety-third day from the Indus. The village of Shusa, where a few cattle and poultry maybe procured, is two miles further to the westward. M ESSAIM. Messaim is five and a half miles further WSW., and is of a similar description to Shusa. H as K iiargoo. Ras Khargoo is opposite to Angaum, and forms the eastern point of the entrance into Angaum, round a rocky spit, with from three and a half fathoms to a fathom and a half. It runs about half a mile off it. A ngaum. Angaum is a rocky island, similar to most in the Gulf. It is five miles long, in a SSW. % W. direction, and two and a half miles broad. It has several wells of water in it,—the best is in a valley, about a quarter of a mile distant NNW. from the south-east point of the island ; there are some reservoirs near the old mosque, which are generally full in the rainy season. The island is uninhabited, but had a town near the old mosque until destroyed by the pirates. There is excellent anchorage near the old mosque, which is in lat, 26° 4V N., long. 55° 55' 52'' E.; variation 3° 37' W. in 1828. Wild goats are found on this island. A ngaum S ound. Angaum Sound is formed by the islands of Angaum and Kishm, and the channel at the south-east entrance is two-thirds of a mile wide. To enter and sail through this channel, steer in about mid-channel, with soundings from six to twelve fathoms, until you get Ras Khargoo NE.byE. | E., when keep most towards Angaum, steering towards the mosque point, which round at a distance of a quarter of a mile, having good soundings close to it. After rounding the mosque, keep in mid-channel, and steer through when the mosque on Angaum bears S. 32° W. true. There is a hard bank, with three fathoms on it, three-fourths over the channel towards Kishm, to work through. Do not approach the Angaum shore at the entrance nearer than one-third of a mile, in five fathoms, or the Kishm shore under five fathoms, until you get Ras Khargoo ENE., when you may work to a quarter of a mile of either shore, until past the mosque point, when you ought not to come nearer than three quarters of a mile to Angaum or Kishm. The soundGULF OF PERSIA. G09 at this part is three miles wide, clear working ground, and four and a half from shore to shore. H as S allack. Ras Sallack is a low rocky point, in lat. 26° 41' 15' N., long. 55° 48' oO' E. It is safe to approach to five fathoms. I S allack V illage. Sallack Village is two and a half miles to the westward of the cape, and has good water. The troops were removed from Kishm to this place, and aftei a few days to Bassadore, the anchorage being too much exposed lor the shipping. Cattle, poultry, and fish are procurable, also a few vegetables in the cold season. R as T arkaom. Ras Tarkaom village is in lat. 26° 38' SO' 7 N., long. 55° 38' lO' E. It is a small point and fishing village ; off this begins the bank com monly called Bassadore Flat. R as K iiarroon. Ras Kharroon is in lat. 26° 34' 10' N., long. 55° 28' E. You may pass it foi the inner channel to Bassadore. Half a mile from here are several salt hills, and boats load with salt for the Arabian Coast. R as D rusterkoon. Ras Drusterkoon is in lat. 26° 32' 45' N., long. 55° 24' 30' E. It is the south-western point of Kishrn. A bank, dry at low-water, com mences running off from this point to Bassadore Point, between which and the southern bank of the channel into Bassadore is a narrow channel, with soundings from three to ten fathoms at low-water, except about two and a half miles from Bassadore Point, when it contracts to about three hundred yards wide, with a fathom and a half and two fathoms in it. CENTRE OF THE PERSIAN GULF, AND THE PEARL BANKS. The centre of the Gulf towards its head is clear of dangers, except such as have been already described with the coast and islands, with soundings varying from nine to twenty-six fathoms above the parallel of 28°. B iddulph's G roup, Biddulph's Group are called so from Captain Biddulph, of Her Majesty's sloop Hesper, being the first person who visited and made any remarks on them ; they are three in number, as follow.610 NAVIGATION OF THE Hargose. Hargose is a small, sandy, and rocky island, surrounded by a reef of rocks. It is at high-water not more than two hundred yards over. The anchorage near it is bad, being hard rock and sand. It is in lat. 27° 55' 30' N., long. 49° 44' E. El Kraing. El Kraing is about three quarters of a mile long, and, like Hargose, surrounded by a reef, extending off all except the south end, two and a half miles. Under the southern end is pretty good anchorage in eight fathoms, low-water, and you may catch good fish at this place. It is in lat. 27° 42' 10'' N., long. 49° 51' 10 ,/ E.; variation 4° 55' W. in 1825. El Krong. El Krong is similar to the last; but within the reef, off, and surround ing it, is a basin or boat harbour, in which the pearl fishing-boats take shelter in bad weather. It is in lat. 27° 38' 10' N., long. 49° 51' 10' E. Between this island and El Kraing is a safe channel, having ten fathoms in it. Zazarine, or Farsee. Zazarine, or Farsee, is a small island, composed of sand and rock. It is half a mile over, and is surrounded by a reef a mile off shore all round it; it has bad anchorage in fifteen fathoms, mud. The island abounds in fish, and is frequented by turtle. It is in lat. 27° 58' 40' N., long. 50° 8' 10' E. Keyn, or Arabee. Keyn, or Arabee, is in lat. 27° 46' N., long. 50° 9' 20' E. It is similar in every respect to Zazarine, and has bad anchorage in eighteen fathoms. Jennee. Jennee is a small sandy island, similar to the others, and surrounded by a reef, having soundings round it from thirteen to seven fathoms; the anchorage bad. It is in lat. 27° 20' 30' N., long. 49° 50' 15' E. Yeredel. leredel is rather smaller than Jennee, and the reef not quite so ex tensive, with similar soundings ; and is in lat. 27° 10' 30' N., long. 49° 53' 10' E. Rocky Bank. A rocky bank, having barely one fathom water on it, bears from El 4qo ^ twelve and a half miles, in lat. 27° 34' 20' N., long. 3 d 20' E., in its north-eastern part.

Remarks. —From lat. 27° SQ' N., long. 49° 24/ E., to the island of El Kron, northerly to the Boosafaa or Durable Shoal, to the south-east enclosing the islands of Yeredel, Jennee, and the Mullamael Shoals, is full of patches and shoals, and should not be attempted to be navigated at night, nor yet in the day, without a pilot, unless well acquainted with the place. R ocky K noll. Rocky Knoll is very small, and nearly dry, in lat. 26° 59' 30' N., long. 49° 56' 80' E. ; soundings ten and seven fathoms close to it. T hree small P atches. Three small patches extend from lat. 27° 13' N., long. 50° E., in a south-west direction, nine miles. A S hoal. A shoal, the shoalest part of which has two and a half fathoms on it, lies in lat. 27° 8' N., long. 50° 9' 30' E. It is three miles long, in a north-east direction. M ullamael S hoal. The shoalest part of Mallamael Shoal, two and a quarter fathoms, is in lat. 26° 59' N., long. 50° 16' 40' E. This shoal is oblong, and has soundings in the other parts from three to seventeen fathoms, very irre gular. B oosafaa, or D urable S hoal, The northern part of Boosafaa or Durable Shoal is in lat. 26° 59' N., long. 50° 24' 20' E., and extends six miles S. 30° E. true. It has barely one fathom on it at low-water. In approching it from the northward, the soundings shoal suddenly after twenty fathoms. The ship Durable, Guthrie, Master, was lost here in 1817, which was the first of the shoal's existence being known to Europeans. E pheraii P earl B ank. Epherah Pearl Bank is a bank of rocks, and considered one of the richest of the pearl banks. It has sixteen fathoms water to the north ward, and ten to the southward. On the bank, the soundings are irregular, from four to eight fathoms. The centre of the bank is in lat. 26° 50' N., long. 50° 37' 30' / E, It is about five miles over from north to south, and about ten miles from east to west. F asht S urrah.

It extends N. by W. and S. by E. five miles, its widest part east and west being three and a half miles. It is more than half dry, and the other part has one to two fathoms on it. It fronts Kateef Bay, and there is a channel with four and five fathoms water between it and the Fasht el Yarron, or Teignmouth Shoal. Rocky Bank. The centre of a rocky bank, with soundings from nine to ten fathoms, and eighteen to the northward and fifteen to the southward, is in lat. 2(3 oS' 50' N., long. 50° 49' E. It has no danger. Rocky Bank. Another rocky bank, with over-falls from six to twenty fathoms on its centre, lies in lat. 26° 54' N., long. 51° E. It extends to E. by N. and W. by S. about six miles each way. Overfall Bank. Oveifall Lank is a rocky bank, extending from lat. 26° 48' N., long. 51° S' E., to lat. 26° 36 / N., long. 51° 45' E., and has soundings of from nine to twenty fathoms on it, rocky bottom.

INHABITANTS OF THE GULF OF PERSIA. The inhabitants on the Arabian side are Mahomedans of all sects, Wahabee, Soonee, and Sheea. In most of the ports are to be found Banian merchants, also Jews and Armenians. The trade of the Gulf is extensive, and most of those maritime places which have not the means or a demand among themselves are the carriers for the other places. Some of the finest of the Buggalows trading from the Gtilf to India belong to these places. At the time the pirates were in power, there were not more than one hundred and twenty Buggalows and Buteels belonging to the Gulf of above seventy tons; three-fourths of these be longed to Grane, Bahrein, and Muskat. Since a regular force has been kept in the Gulf to keep the pirates down, they have increased to near six hundred ; and the trade with India, particularly with the Malabar Coast and Bombay, has become very considerable. The Arabs take off every year a large part of the rice grown in Malabar, and large quantities of timber, for which they pay in dates or hard cash, but mostly the latter. I may add here, that though the pirates are kept down, they are not suppressed, and if opportunity offered they would soon be up again. They possess some of the finest vessels in the Gulf. One thing—the surveys of the Gulf will in future times prevent their escape among the islands and shoals, as they did before, while the Officers of the Indian Navy, from constantly navigat ing the Gulf, will be able to follow them wherever they go. WINDS AND CURRENTS. At the head of the Gulf, during the months of November, December, January, and part of March, the winds blow alternately from north-west and south-east, but with no regularity, as during those periods when it blows hard the wind will be in opposite directions within a very short distance. During these strong breezes, which seldom last beyond four days in the north-westers, the air is clear, cold, and bracing ; in the south-easters the air is generally moist, and rainy. When the winds are614 NAVIGATION OF THE light the Weather is generally ha^y. From the middle of March to September, the winds are mostly from the north-west, sometimes blow ing very hard. Southerly winds seldom blow after March. You have also occasionally land and sea-breezes. From the middle of May to the end of June the wind called the grand Shamall blows: this is a con tinued north-west wind, and at times blowing with great fury, in hard gusts,—at other times light. It must have much altered since McClure's time, who speaks of ships being unable to show sail above their courses to it at all parts above Bushire. The tides are quite regular at Bushire—it is high-water at full and change at 7h. 50m.; at Karrack 9h. 20m., atDillum lOh. 20m, y half way between that and the bar off Khore Moosa at llh. 10m., and at Bussora Bar at 12h. 10m. The same remarks apply from the island of Kenn or Ghes up to Bushire, so far as regards the winds, with the exception that they are much lighter, except in the winter months, when they blow hard, and often in heavy squalls. Except inshore, the tides here are more irregular, being much influenced by the winds from Kenn down to the Quoins. The winds hang in those months most to the eastward and westward, when blowing strong from the north-west and south-east above, taking the direction of the coast, and near the entrance are frequently at north-east and south-west. Strong easterly breezes occasionally blow in the hot season, and the land winds, particularly on the Arabian Coast, are hot and blasting. . At the head of the Gulf th e thermometer ranges from 48° to about 76° m the cold months, and from 85° to 110° in the hot ; at the lower part t ie range m the hot weather is much the same, and from 54° to 78° in the cold. At the entrance of the Gulf, and outside of it from Muskat to the noin., t e tide;? and currents are variable and uncertain (except on e ersian Coast, where there is a regular tide), and depend much upon the winds. When calm, or light winds blow near the entrance of the U ' 116 ln uence of the tide is felt across the whole from coast to coast.

As the place gets settled, this trade will revive. About fifteen hundred to two thousand five hundred African slaves are brought into the Gulf every year by the way of Muskat, besides which I believe two or three hundred girls are brought from the Malabar Coast, Kutch, and even Bombay—at least I have frequently been told so by Arabs and others. A great portion of these are children. Fruits are in their seasons very plentiful at the head of the Gulf, particularly on the banks of the Euphrates, and at Bushire : they consist of nectarines, peaches, apricots, apples, pears, grapes of various sorts, plums, melons, quinces, and many others ; carrots, turnips, occa sionally cabbages, beet, and various sallads, are also to be had in season ; onions, cucumbers, and the usual native vegetables. The meat on the Arabian Coast is mostly good ; on the Persian Coast only occasionally so, and it is also dear. The poultry at the head of the Gulf is very large and fine ; low down very indifferent. Fish in all parts plentiful, and excellent. WITHOUT THE GULF.—PERSIAN COAST FROM ORMUS • TO RAS OR CAPE JASK. Leaving the eastern anchorage of Ormus, course E. by S., along shore, in soundings from ten to five and six fathoms, with the mouth of the Minnow river bearing true NE. The coast from Ormus to this place is long and jungly, with creeks and swamps, and a flat running off a mile and a half. M innae F ort. Minnae Fort is situated on a hill fifteen miles inland, and the custom house, up to which native boats of fifteen or twenty tons go, is seven miles up the river. The eastern point of the entrance is in lat. 27° 6' 48 // N., long. 56° 47' lO' E. This is a place of some trade, particularly in grain, and dried fruits from Kermaunshaw. Some large boats load off the entrance of the river, but most of the produce is sent to Bunder Abbas in smaller boats, and shipped off from thence. The port is under the Iraaum of Muskat. Minnow itself is a large place, and though only fifteen miles in a line inland, is nearly thirty by the winding of the river; and this, from the circumstance of the boats beino- obliged to come down with the tide, corroborates Patra de la Valles^' account, in 1621, of its being two days' journey from the sea.

In Part I. of this Memoir I have mentioned that the high land form ing the southern entrance into the Gulf is by the Arabs called Ras-ool- Jibbul. It is the same as seen by Alexander's fleet, as described by Arrian, from the seventy-eighth station of the fleet from the mouth of the Indus, and which I believe to be under Ras-ool-Khore, near Kohurba- reak. It was about the fleet standing over to this promontory that the dispute arose between Nearchus and Onesicritus, his colleague. It was by the Greeks called Maceta—it was also called Asabo; and the whole ridge from Huffar to Musseldom is the Black Mountains of Ptolemy, Musseldom, or that part near the termination or cape, being named Maceta or Maketa. Having premised so far, it is necessary to add that at present two points of the same ridge of land bear the same name. The whole of these mountains are indented with coves and in lets, some small, others very extensive, and all with deep water within them, even close to the rocks : they produce nothing. The inhabitants are a different race in many respects from the Arabs in the neighbourhood, and have a different language; they live upon fish, dates, and a little barley when they are rich enough to pro- cuie it; they are excessively poor, and rice is nearly unknown to them. Most of the women have never left the hills and coves. They are very ignorant, and their huts, which are built of loose stones, about four feet high, are little better than pigsties. A small pocket looking-glass was given away at one of the villages, and was evidently the first that had ever been seen at that place: the men and women assembled in crowds, and were like a set of monkeys, examining it on both sides—sometimes shouting with laughter, at other times looking very serious. They are very civil, and at the changes of the season emigrate from one Mde of the hills to the other. They have little clothing, and appear in the extreme of poverty, yet contented. Some of the men in the date eason employ themselves in Batinah and other parts of the low coun- y, in getting in the date harvest, yet all return to their barren hills; so much does the love of this miserable place seem to be implanted e in abitants, that I was informed seldom or never is a man known , 6 'J 8 ^ lome f ur ther than a few short voyages in the Gulf.

The Persian Coast is nearer this point than anywhere else in the Gulf, being twenty- seven miles across. D ooat S hesah. Dooat Shesah is the first inlet to the southward of Cape Musseldora, is near seven miles deep, and about twenty-two or twenty-three round.

In the cove there is room, exclusive of the bay just described, for forty or fifty sail of ships and large vessels, the soundings shoaling rom thirteen and fourteen fathoms at the entrance to three fathoms out a quarter of a mile from the bottom of the cove. The cove isGULF OF PERSIA. one mile deep, and, except abreast the half-moon battery, is nearly the same breadth as at the entrance. The best anchorage for a ship only going to stop a fe\y days is in eight or nine fathoms, mid -channel, be- tween the fort on Muscat Island and the half.moon battery ; for ships landing cargo, a berth in six fathoms, a little within the battery, rather oyer towards Muskat Island, would be the best, MCJ8KAT, Muskat Is the capital of the Kingdom of Oman, and the residence of the Imaum or Sultan. It is situated at the bottom of the cove of the same name, and is in lat. 23° 38' 5' N., long. 58° 40' 20' E. It is in some parts well built, and is a place of great trade. The maum's palace is on the water side, and is a good but plain building On the top of a high hill, on the western side, is a large fort, origin all y built by the Portuguese, called Jilla Farsah, and on the east side, over the gap, is another very strong fort, named Jilla Ali. Several small towers and forts are scattered about on the hills, and over the pass to the SE. Though barren rocks and buildings are all that are to be seen yet at few places do you get better supplies,—fruit in the season in the' greatest abundance, and some at all times of the year, particularly limes, and remarkably fine pomegranates; vegetables, though of the country sort, are very good, and plentiful; beef and mutton of the finest quality; the poultry, though small, is good; and fish of the finest qua. hty, and at all times, in the greatest abundance. Ihe population of Muskat is constantly fluctuating. At times it amounts to near thirty thousand souls; at other times there is not more than ten or twelve thousand. There are about two thousand Banians settled here, who carry on a thriving trade. They are patient and enduring, and have little or no expenses. They are brokers to most of the Arab merchants, and generally agents to any European ship that trades to this place. Some of them have great influence with the Imaum, who finds it greatly to his interest, and the benefit of his revenues, to give them every encouragement. There are twelve or fourteen merchant ships and brigs belonging to the port of Muskat, of from one thousand to two hundred tons burden, To the small places before described, there belong nearly two hundred large trading boats, that trade to India, Kutch, the Coast of Mukran, Sind, the various ports in the Gulf of Persia and the Red Sea, the island of Zanzibar, and the Coast of Africa. The ships trade to Bengal, the Isle of France, Bourbon, and Malabar Coast. The imports are piece goods, both of British and Indian manufacture, indigo, timber, rice, sugar-candy, sugar, coffee, spices, dried fruits, dates,632 NAVIGATION OF THE salt, pearls, and slaves. A large quantity of ghee, and some cotton, are also imported from Sind and Kutch. Most of these articles are either sold to the inland tribes, or again exported coast-ways along the Imaum's territory, or into Persia or Turkish Arabia. The exports are gums, drugs, dates, dried fruits, sharkfins, salt, salt fish, and asses, the latter generally to the Isle of France or Bourbon. To give some idea of the trade, I need only mention what the amount paid by the Banian who farmed the customs was in 1827, viz. one lakh and eighty-eight thousand German crowns. Muskat takes off from Man galore and the Malabar Coast annually about four or five hundred thousand morahs of rice, besides immense quantities of timber, pepper, and cardamoms. A large quantity of the Mysore coffee is also exported from the Malabar Coast by vessels belonging to Muskat and its de pendencies. The Imaum himself is one of the principal merchants of the place: a very great portion of the trade is in his hands, and also much of that to Bourbon and the Isle of France, The inhabitants are Arabs of various tribes, and mostly Mahomedans of the Soonee sect; and though many Shaikhs from the Mukran and Persian Coasts are settled here, all under the present Imaum are alike protected. Syud Saeed bin Sultan, the present Imaum or Sultan, succeeded his elder brother, who was appointed by his cousin Biddoo bin Jaaf, in 1806 or 1807. He is now about fifty-two or fifty-three years of age, of a most prepossessing appearance, and gentlemanly manners, and is pos sessed of considerable abilities. He is a careful politician : he watches carefully all political events in India or Arabia, and, as far as he can, turns them to the advantage of his Government. He is much attached to the English, both from personal feelings, and gratitude for the assist ance they have given him at various times. The Imaum has established a very respectable naval force, which is, with the island of Zanzibar, his principal care and study. His navy consists of one seventy-four (I believe now sent to England as a present to the king) ; the Shah Allum, a double-banked frigate of fifty guns ; the Caroline, of forty guns ; Piedmontese and Mustafa, of thirty guns each ; Rahmany, corvette, of twenty-two guns; three brigs and schooners, of eight to twelve guns each ; besides four war Buggalows and six Buteels, carrying from four to ten guns each. He has also several merchant vessels. His dominions extend from the 22nd to the 27th degree of N. lat., and from the 55th to the 60th degree of E. long., comprising what is usually termed the Kingdom of Oman, and has a sea coast of near five hundred miles.

The chief of the latter place actually seized his son and nephew, whom he had left in charge of the Govern- ment; and there are several of his own near relations particularly who are his greatest enemies. As he has no children by his wife, it is generally thought some of his near relations will succeed him in Arabia^ and his sons will be settled on the island of Zanzibar, which is of late the Imaum's favourite resi dence, and on which he is forming plantations of sugar, coffee, and indigo, and with so much success that it promises fair to be one of the most valuable islands on this side the Cape of Good Hope. Ihe Imaum keeps up at Musk at, and in his various forts, about fifteen hundred Beloochees : these are all the soldiers who receive pay his subjects, as in all Arab countries, are bound to follow him to war, but, like the highlanders of old, it is only when their own immediate chief orders them. The total of the Imaum's revenue is said to be near seven lakhs of German crowns, but one lakh may be allowed for short of collection ; Muskat, Muttra, Zanzibar, and the slave trade, are his only certain souices of revenue, and they may be estimated as follows: , German Crowns.

There is little more to add than that the Imaum has TreatiesNAVIGATION OF THE GULF OF PERSIA. with the Government of India* and the Isle of France. He is ranch liked by all foreigners who visit him. The Americans in the year 1833 sent a sloop of war and schooner to make a treatyf with him. The Imaum has two sons and some daughters by his concubines.

KEMBALL, RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULF. to which are appended, Copies of tfje 35ngagemente entmtr into WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, between the years 1822 axd 1851, BY HIS HIGHNESS THE IMAUM OF MUSKAT, THE ARAB CHIEFS OF THE PERSIAN GULF, AND THE GOVERNMENT OF PERSIA, FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF THE ABOVE OBJECT.G3G SLAVE TRADE The first obligation imposed upon the Arab Chieftains in the Persian Gulf, with reference to the Traffic in Slaves, was the provision forming Article IX. of the General Treaty of 1820 * The words are' The 4 carrying off of slaves, men, women, and children, from the Coasts of Africa or elsewhere, and the transporting them in vessels, is plunder and piracy, and the friendly Arabs shall do nothing of this nature.' This Article has ever been understood and held as forbidding only the carrying off of men, women, and children as slaves, and the transport ing them in vessels, when so carried oif, although the words may be said to bear the same comprehensive sense of forbidding the carry ing off of slaves, and the transporting of slaves, however procured, in vessels ; but even this most extended acceptation cannot be con strued into forbidding the purchase of slaves, and the transport of them overland, unless indeed the last clause, which provides that the friendly Arabs shall do nothing of this nature, embraces everything. The Arabic sentence bears precisely the same meaning, and is liable to the same opposite constructions. It would be manifestly unjust to enforce this Article, imposing the same punishment on dealing in slaves as on piracy, whilst at the same time the Imaum of Muskat, the Turks, the Persians, and all the Arabs not included in this Treaty, are allowed to carry on the trade. The effect, moreover, would be only to benefit the latter, by throwing the trade into their hands. The following observations upon this subject, made by Captain McLeod, Resident in the Gulf in 1823, hold good to the present day 'But in whatever sense the words of the Treaty may be understood by either party, I am convinced that our utmost endeavours to abolish the Slave Trade amongst the parties to the Treaty will be ineffectual as long as the other powers of the Gulf persist in it. We may, perhaps, put a stop to the carrying off of slaves, but their purchase and transport * \ ide pages 'S to 80 of this Selection.SLAVE TRADE. 637 we never can prevent: the slaves will be disguised and concealed in a 1 lion sand ways, so that it will be impossible for us to detect them; and 1 doubt whether more harm than good might not be done to the cause of humanity by stopping boats, and searching them for slaves, because it would in all cases occasion such disgust and offence as would involve a great risk of a renewal of hostilities. ' I do not believe that any of the parties to the Treaty do carry off slaves,'- all those they possess being purchased at Muskat and other places. But at all events it would be difficult, even in the former case, to detect them,—in the latter next to impossible; and with all our efiorts we shall find it impracticable to put a stop to a traffic which is sanctioned by their religion and by immemorial custom, unless it were relinquished by the common consent of the whole of the Chiefs of this Gulf.' Finally, the Bombay Government thus declared, in its letter No 393 dated 26th March 18231 rhe Article relating to the Slave Trade does certainly not bear the- construction that has hitherto been put on it. It evidently only alludes to descents made on the Coast of Africa for the purpose of making slaves. This is justly declared to be plunder and piracy,—terms which it would have been an abuse of language to apply to any trade, however detestable, as long as it was peacefully conducted. In this sense the Article must be understood, but every infringement of it, when clearly established, must be resented as a case of piracy would be.' On the 29th August lb22 a Treaty;|: was concluded with His Highness^ the Imaum of Muskat by Captain Moresby, of His Majesty's ship. Menai, under the instructions of the Government of the Isle of France. A letter was received from His Highness the Imaum of Muskat at Zanzibar in July 1837, complaining of the aggressions committed by The Joasmees have been accused of stealing and carrying off slaves from the African. Coast, but the crime was not proven. They are nevertheless supposed to have been frequently guilty of it. ^ ^ t Again, the opinion of the Right Honorable the Governor General in Council, as conveyed in the 9th paragraph of a letter from the Secretary to the Government of India, dated 22nd March 1841 ' That with regard to those chieftains who entered into engagements with Sir W. G. Keir in 1820, it would not be prudent or right abruptly, and until by friendly com munications a sufficient ground shall have been laid for such a course, to declare all trading in slaves to be piracy and plunder, and to attempt to enforce Article IX. according to 'the English version of the Treaty, which indeed has been found not to correspond with the native wording; and considering that it has not in consequence been acted upon for the last twenty years, the force of that Article must be considered as in a great measure suspended.' Suffice it to say, that not one single seizure has been made under its provisions, altllou 0- !! twenty-four years have elapsed since the date of its formation, and the trade continues flourish. 1' A copy of which is annexed. j ■ I 11638 SLAVE TRADE. the subjects of Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur upon the inhabitants of that coast. Although it was not considered expedient to throw any obsta cles in the way of the intercourse so long carried on by the Joasmees with the Coast of Africa, yet it was intimated to His Highness, in reply, that he was fully justified in taking such measures as he considered best adapted to protect his subjects from aggressions of the nature complained of. A few days subsequent to the receipt of the above, a statement was made to the Resident by an individual named Abdoolla bin Iwuz (professing to be a person of some rank from the African Coast), regarding the alleged outrageous proceedings of the crews of some Joasmee boats, in having carried off two hundred and thirty-three young girls, under the pretence of marriage, and subsequently disposed of them as slaves upon their return to the Gulf. On the Joasmee Agent, who happened at the time to be at Bushire, being summoned, and Article IX. of Sir W. G. Keir's Treaty with the pacificated Arabs brought to his notice, he denounced the complainant's statement as an unqualified falsehood. He did not mean to deny the fact of slaves having been brought up from the Coast of Berbera, but declared that they had been regularly purchased from two tribes in that neighbourhood, at war with each other, who were in the habit of selling all the prisoners that fell into their hands. He further denounced Abdoolla bin Iwuz as an impostor, without any letters or credentials, who would have returned to Muskat without lodging any complaint had Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur been willing to make him a small present. Although, notwithstanding the inquiries which were immediately instituted, no proofs could be estab lished to bring the charge home to the Joasmees, who were either innocent of the offence, or had found means of concealing the truth from the Government Agent, yet the case had its effect, inasmuch as it opened a wide field for investigation into the nature and extent of the traffic in slaves, and led to some discoveries which were duly taken advantage of. The result of this inquiry led to the belief that the Somalees, from whom a great part of the supply appeared to be drawn, were a free peo ple (according to Mahomedan law), and could not become slaves with out violence. The conclusion to be drawn therefrom was, that those conveyed to the Persian Gulf must either be kidnapped or purchased while prisoners of war,—a practice to which, even among the generality of Mahomedans, a degree of turpitude attached, which, if argued and insisted upon, would tend materially to diminish and circumscribe the trade. With a view to prevent the recurrence of such a case as that which formed the subject of Abdoolla bin Iwuz's complaint, Shaikh Sultan bin' K. SLAVE TRADE. Suggnr, Rashid bin Humeed, Muktoom bin Butye, and Khaleefa bin Shakboot, the Chiefs of Ejman, Debaye, and Aboothabee, were induced to enter into and sign an Article of an Agreement, dated 17th April 1838, conceding to our cruisers the right of searching and detaining vessels upon the high seas in all cases where their crews might be suspected of having been engaged in the kidnapping of slaves, and at the same time to admit the further right of seizing and confiscating them in case the suspicion proved to be well founded. Up to this time ( a. d. 1838) vessels engaged in the Slave Trade were (according to the Treaty concluded by Captain Moresby, of His Majesty s ship Menai, with His Highness the Imaum, on the 29th August 1822) liable only to seizure if found ' to the eastward of a line drawn from Cape Delgado passing east of Socotra, and on to Diu Head, the western point of the Gulf of Cambay'; but as a further advance toward circumscribing the field for the prosecution of the Slave Tiade in these quarters, and diminishing the number of marts for the sale and purchase of human beings, the Resident, in July 1839, succeeded in engaging the Maritime Arab Chiefs, viz. Sultan bin Suggur, of Ras-ool-Khyma, Khaleefa bin Shakboot, of Aboothabee, Muktoom bin Butye, of Debaye, and Abdoolla bin Rashid, of Amulga- vine, to accede to the wishes of the British Government, by attaching their seals and signatures to a new engagement, # Article I, of which gave to our vessels the right of search beyond a line drawn from Cape Delgado, passing two degrees seaward of the island of Socotra, to 1 ussem, on the Mukran Coast; Article II. rendered vessels belonging to the above chiefs, or their subjects, found with slaves on board beyond the limits specified, liable to seizure and confiscation; and Article III. made the sale of Somalees an act of piracy. To this engagement, which modified and formed an addition of three new Articles to the Treaty concluded by Captain Moresby in 1822 the Imaum was induced to become a party in December of the same year. Under the sanction of Government, it. was subsequently intimated to the several chiefs subscribing to the treaties, that instructions had been issued to the British Political Agent at Muskat, that on all occasions where suspicion might arise of any of their vessels touching at Muskat having Somalees on board, he should without delay obtain the sanction * The warmest commendation of the Honorable the Governor in Council was communicated to the Resident, Captain Hennell, for his valuable exertions in obtaining such extensive concessions, whereby Government had it in its power effectually to exclude this nefarious trade on the long line of coast extending from Bombay to Cape Paperia.

The practicability of inducing His Highness the Imaum of Muskat, and the Arab Chiefs in the Gulf, to prohibit and a. d. 18 ,3/-38. abolish the traffic in slaves altogether, was at one time brought under consideration, but the following arguments and facts, urged at the time, proved the utter inutility of so partial a measure ;— That in the first place it would be impracticable to induce His High- ness the Imaum of Muskat and the Arab Chiefs in the Gulf to put to an end the traffic in slaves without such a large pecuniary sacrifice being made on the part of the British Government as would most likely be considered altogether inexpedient ; and in the second place, that were such a sacrifice made, the humane and philanthropic objects of the Right Honorable the Governor in Council would still be defeated by further impediments and difficulties, for which no remedy could probably be found. Article IX. of Sir W. G. Keir's Treaty of 1820, as before men tioned, had never been held binding to the fullest import of which it could bear the application. Since that date a period of seventeen years had passed over without tiie question having been agitated, and thus the several parlies concern ed had acquired a sort of prescriptive right, never questioned by the Government, to consider that Article IX. was inserted solely with the view of guarding against the forcible carrying away of individuals for the purpose of selling them as slaves, and not meant to prohibit altoge ther a traffic which is not only in accordance with the letter and spirit of their religion, but which long continuance and custom have rendered almost indispensable to their domestic comfort. Assuming, however, that Article IX. of the Treaty of 1820 bears the interpretation best suited to our views and policy, and that our right to act upon it, although allowed to lie so long in abeyance, is neverthe- lebs liable to be called into operation whenever we may consider it expedient to do so, still it must be borne in recollection that even on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf alone, neither His Highness the Imaum, nor the Chiefs of Sohar, Kateef, or Koweit, are parties to this Ireaty, and therefore their consent to a total prohibition of the traffic in oui fellow-cicatures could only be obtained by means of negotiation, and the offer ot such advantages as would in their estimation compen- &gt;-aie foi the loss they sustained, in the surrender of a practice unitingslave trade. 641 both profit and convenience. A great proportion of the revenue of His Ilighneiss the Imaum is drawn from this source, and he is said to have declared, that in consequence of his having allowed himself to enter into the agreement with Captain Moresby, of the Royal Navy, en § a §i n § 1° prohibit the Slave Trade with European Powers within certain limits, he has sustained a diminution on his revenue to the extent of 100,000 crowns, and that he is resolute in his determination not to afford any further concession upon this point. But even admit ting that, either through our influence, or the payment of an annual pecuniary compensation, the parties alluded to consented to enter into an engagement for the total suppression of the Slave Trade, it is to be feaiod that the attainment of the humane objects contemplated by the Government would be still as distant as before. The reason for enter taining this opinion is, that the only effect of the prohibition, if it could be enforced in the ports on the Arabian side of the Gulf, would be to throw the whole of this infamous traffic into the hands of the inhabitants of Bussora and Mohumrah (subjects of the Ottoman Porte), and those of Bushire, Congoon, Aseeloo, and Lingah, the principal seaports of Peibia. It is unnecessary to observe, that in the present state of our relations 'with both these Governments* no interdiction of the traffic in question could be carried into effect, unless under the express sanction of their respective authorities. Taking, however, into consideration, that the sale and purchase of slaves is not only permitted by the tenets of their faith, but that the discontinuance would greatly abridge what habit and custom have led their subjects to value as a domestic conve nience, for some time at least it its-hopeless to look for sucii a sanction being afforded. In addition to these impediments, there exists the probability that were the inhabitants in the Gulf to relinquish the traffic at present carried on in slaves, the place of their vessels would be immediately occupied by those from the Red Sea, the Coasts of Mukran, Sind, &amp;c. &amp;c. It may at the same time be reasonably anticipated, that even those powers whose consent to our views may be exacted or pur chased will exhibit little more than a nominal adherence to their engage ments, unless compelled to do so by our own maritime force. This, however, would involve the necessity of greatly augmenting the number of the vessels of war employed in those seas, and in all probability be attended with the constant risk of entangling us in disputes with the local Governments dependent on Persia, Turkey, and Egypt. As the inhabitants of Koweit, Bussora, Congoon, Aseeloo, and Since this Papei was written, the Pcrsmn Government has entered into a Convention with the British Government, authorising the search and seizure, by British men of war and by vessels of the Indian Navy, ot Persian vessels suspected of being engaged in the Slave Trade. A copy of this Convention is annexed.— Editor.642 SLAVE TRADE. Lino-ah carry on the traffic in question to a considerable extent, and as these ports are subject to the authority of the Turkish and Persian Governments, it would be useless attempting to enter into any negotia- tions affecting this branch of their commerce, unless through our Ministers at the Courts of Constantinople and Tehran. The following review of our powers by the foregoing treaties, which form the only restrictions to the Slave Trade, will prove how little cal culated these are, from being so very partially directed, to suppress or even check the Slave Trade in these quarters, although they should have the fullest effect in excluding it from the entire shores of India, including the newly acquired possessions. The Restrictive Slave Trade Line from Delgado to Pussem leaves a track or road suffi ciently large for the safe and convenient navigation of the vessels engaged in the traffic ; and circumstances of distress, or other unavoid able cause, moreover, exempt the vessel* found beyond it from the penalties laid down by the Treaty. This line, too, affects only the boats of Muskat, and the ports situated between Ras-ool-Khyma and Aboo- thabee inclusive. Those of the ports on the Coast of Persia and Turkey, such as Lingah, Congoon, Aseeloo, Koweit, and Bussora, are bound by no engagements whatever, or restricted to no particular limits. The agreement concluded in April 1838, although it provides against kidnapping on the part of those chiefs subscribing, or their subjects, does not in the letter preclude them from purchasing slaves from others who have kidnapped them, and the difficulties which on the one hand offer to the cruisers in making the distinction, and discovering the actual men-stealers, and on the other the facilities to the latter in escaping detection (for a very large portion of the slaves have been kidnapped—that is, as prisoners of war, have been sold by those into whose hands they have fallen), may be conceived. Article III. of the Treaty of 1839 precluded the parties subscribing fiom the sale or purchase of Somalees in toto,f that tribe, from profess- * No cruisers have hitherto been ever assigned to watch the boundary line laid down in Aiticle II., nor, in consequence, also, has any seizure been 3 r et made under its provisions.

The proportion of the former to the two latter is perhaps as one to one hundred, and these are probably kidnapped or purchased as prisoners of war. There is, how ever, much doubt whether in actual fact any great degree of moral guilt is considered to attach to Musulmans engaging in this traffic. The discovery of an individual of the Somalee Tribe, even when in possession of one of the chiefs subscribing to this agreement, or his subjects, and his consequent restoration to liberty, must be necessarily very rare, and to be accomplished only in spots within the sphere of immediate sur veillance and supervision of our Native Agents. With a view to give a more full effect, however, to these restrictions, such as they are, valuable suggestions, as hereafter extracted* from the Records of the Residency, have from time to time been made, having for their object also the eventual and total suppression of the nefarious traffic. In all the negotiations which have hitherto been entered into with His Highness the Imaum and the independent Maritime Chieftains of the Arabian Coast, the main object in view has been in the first place wholly to exclude this hateful traffic from all places subject to, or de pendent upon, the British Government; and in the next to narrow as much as possible the facilities of carrying it on within those limits which have hitherto been recognised by us as legitimate in all our intercourse with them. The free and unmolested traffic in slaves between the Imaum's possessions on the African Coast and the ports in the Persian Gulf, within the restrictive line, has always been contended for their act; and, in the event of his persisting in a refusal to produce them, liable to the infliction of a fine of twice the market value of the unhappy individual who has been dragged away into slavery, in direct violation of a solemn agreement. To such a plan, however, there exists the difficulty regarding the disposal of the fine when paid'; and it was at the same time suggested ' that it might, provided no legal objection interposed, be applied to the purchase and liberation from slavery of such Somalees as their present owners in different parts of the Gulf might be disposed to part with/' But it may be questioned whether such an arrangement, while it served to check the traffic in Somalees, among those subscribing to the agreement, would not tend to encourage it among those not parties to the same. A better plan, therefore, would appear to offer itself for the disposal of the fine alluded to, when re covered, in the payment of the amount into the hands of the individual liberated, on his return to his native country, as a compensation for the temporary loss of his liberty, and the hardships and inconvenience he has suffered. ' The only other alternative, excepting a pro hibition against all or any of the vessels of the offending chief or his subjects proceeding to the Coast of Africa on any pretext whatsoever, would be to seize the Buggalows belonging to individuals once proved guilty of bringing up Somalee slaves to the Gulf, wherever they might thereafter be found. His Highness the Imaum would probably gladly interdict their visiting Zanzibar and other places belonging to himself in the vicinity, and would give our ships authority to seize sueh vessels as might infringe this prohibition.' * Vide page 646 cl seq* 83644 SLAVE TRADE. for by all the members of the several treaties which have been entered into touching this trade ; therefore no interference with the native vessels in the Gulf having slaves on board existed on our part, excepting in cases where it could be proved that these had been kidnapped by the crews, or their carrying Soraalees for sale. The difficulty attending the production of proof touching the former exception (unless by the aid of qualified Agents at Zanzibar, and on the African Coast) is fully admit ted; but there is no possibility of passing an individual of the Somalee Tribe for a Negro, and therefore a thorough search of the vessel sus pected of having any on board must always tend to their discovery. Little prospect exists of persuading the Arabian Chiefs to resign of their own accord a practice consonant to their social and religious habits, and at the same time uniting profit with convenience. So long as the Shaikhs on the coast are satisfied they are not likely to incur a positive injury or loss from us, in consequence of their continuing the existing traffic in slaves, they will not consent to any arrangements having in view its abolition ; but were a declaration on the part of the British Government made, intimating its being considered expedient and right that the purchase and sale of human beings by the independent Mari time Chiefs of Arabia should cease after a certain period, and that any infractions of such a prohibition would be punished, it would probably be submitted to without opposition, although rather as an act of autho rity it were useless to attempt to oppose or contend against than from any conviction of the justice or propriety of the demand. Next to such a measure as the above, a great check, if not a total stop might be put to the traffic in slaves, on the part of the independent chiefs on the Arabian Coast of this Gulf, were advantage to be taken of the declaration made by His Highness the Imaum regarding the irre gular proceedings of the Joasmees on their coasts, to obtain from His Highness a notification prohibiting these boats from visiting his African possessions on any pretext whatever, and giving authority to our vessels of war to seize any such boats found cruising within the limits of his territories. So far as it can be ascertained, the only places where slaves can be procured are within such limits, and on the coast of Berbera. As the inhabitants of the latter country are Somalees, all vessels belonging to most of the Arabian Shaikhs of this Gulf are liable to seizure if found with one individual of the latter description on board. But that part of the Gulf of Aden and Zanzibar are only visited by native vessels from this Gulf at certain seasons of the year (from November to May), and therefore arrangements might be made by the political authority at the former port for the due surveillance of the Berbera Coast. Were it plainly notified to the independent Mari time Arabian Chiefs that His Highness the Imaum had interdicted theirSLAVE TRADE. 645 de;. vessels from visiting his possessions in Africa, and that the British Government was prepared to enforce such an interdict by the seizure of all boats attempting to break through or evade it, it would certainly check to a great extent the traffic in human flesh, so far as they were concerned, as the price of slaves in the Muskat market is probably too high to allow of their being exported from that port for sale in the Persian Gulf at a remunerating profit. It ought not, however, to be concealed that such a measure as the one suggested would be very restricted in its operation, and afford but a small mitigation to the general trade in slaves in the Persian Gulf. The total number of native vessels belonging to the independent Arabian Chiefs visiting Zanzibar and the Arabian Coast does not exceed eight, a numbei which cannot carry one-seventh part of the slaves said to be annually disposed of at Bussora and in the other ports of this sea.* The traffic in question is principally carried on by the boats belonging to Soor and other places between Ras-ool-Hud and Muskat, subject to His Highness the Imaum, and which of course, as well as all Persian and Turkish vessels, would be quite unrestricted by any measure of * Extract of a Letter from Colonel Robertson to Government, No. 35 P. D., dated Ath March 1842. Captain Ilennell's plan for enlisting the Imaum in our attempt to hinder the Arab Chiefs from trading in slaves appears to me to be merely calculated to throw the trade into the Imaum's hands. lo put down the Slave Trade, therefore, it is useless to check the carriers of one-seventh part of the trade, while the carriers of the other six-sevenths are not checked. It is obvious, indeed, that such a check would only transfer the other seventh to the hands and enterprise of other persons, and that the trade itself would not be checked. Whatever measure, there fore, we adopt, to put down this trade, ought to have a general application and bearing. A check on one individual, and not on all traders, should be deemed no check at all. But to obtain a right for stopping all traders through treaties and negotiations would be an endless task, and in many cases one that is altogether impossible. I am decidedly of opinion, there fore, that the shortest and simplest form of check we shall ever be able to impose is to obtain possession of the seaports, or line of Coast of Africa, whence the slaves are exported, and to prevent the arrival there of slaves from the interior, or the sale of them. Such a position would be but little expensive, I think, in comparison to the system of search at sea, and in harbours (even of African harbours), and would enable us, without a single treaty with any of the rulers of the Arabian Coast and Persian Gulf, to put down the whole traffic through its present channel. ' How such a command of the African ports is to be acquired I am unable to say. Possi bly it may be deemed impracticable ; but if it is not, it presents, in my estimation, the most effectual method of carrying our point. ' Lord Palmerston's offer to the Imaum of Muskat of ,€2,000 a year for three years appears to me to be totally inadequate to cover the losses which that chieftain would sustain by the abolition of the Slave Trade ; for almost all his subjects are slaves, and he sells as well as exports them to Arabia and the Persian Gulf. We should therefore consider the whole value of his subjects annually sold by him, and not merely the custom duties of his ports, exacted from other slave dealers, if we adopt a pecuniary principle of remuneration for inducing him to abandon his Slave Trade.' 1646 SLAVE TRADE. the nature of that suggested to be employed in the case of those Shaikhs who have treaties on the subject with us ; so that while the Muskat, Turkish, and Persian Ports remain open markets for slaves, the diminu tion which we may perhaps succeed in effecting on the Arabian side of the Gulf will be most likely met by a nearly corresponding addition to the traffic of the places above alluded to. Were it, however, possible to obtain from the Turkish and Persian Governments a prohibition to the sale of slaves in the several ports belonging to them in the Persian Gulf and river Euphrates, and at the same time to receive authority for our vessels of war to enforce such an interdict, I should entertain every hope, with the aid of an efficient squadron, of seeing the Slave Trade in this quarter completely sup pressed in the course of a very few years. EXTRACTS FROM THE RECORDS OF THE RESIDENCY AT BUSHIRE. Slaves imported into Persia, through the southern ports, are of two kinds,—the Somalee, or African from the Coast of Zanzibar, the territory principally of the Imaum of Muskat; and Hubshee, or Abyssinian, from the shores of the Red Sea. Judda, Hodeida, Mocha, &amp;c. Slaves are but rarely kidnapped by the crews of the boats in which they are shipped for exportation, or indeed by the merchants themselves immediately on the coast, but by people employed for that purpose in the interior. A proportion are prisoners made in the petty wars between hostile tribes, and sold by them into slavery. Muskat and Soor are the principal primary ports to which slaves, from whencesoever shipped, whether Zanzibar or the Red Sea, are brought, and whence they are eventually carried into Turkey, Persia, Sind, the Arab States, and even our own territories on the Western Coast of India. The boats conveying them make coasting voyages, selling individuals of their live cargo at the several ports at which they may touch. Of the above countries, Turkey consumes by far the greater proportion, Bussora and Bagdad being the largest marts. No vessels proceed direct to Zanzibar from any of the Persian ports, with the exception of Lingah, whence three or four boats are annually despatched, each returning with about seventy slaves. The season for the Gulf traffic in slaves is included between the 1st July and the 1st November. At Bushire and the other Persian ports there are no particular spots allotted for slave markets, nor day fixed for the sale. On the arrival of a boat, the owner takes the slaves, or a number of them, forming hisSLAVE TRADE. 647 cargo, to a hired dwelling, where they are sold privately, or to a Karavanserai, where they are publicly exposed for sale. Should the market happen to be overstocked, or the owner find any obstacle to the expeditious disposal of his property, they are re-shipped, and conveyed to Mohurnrah or Bussora, or even to Bagdad, at either of which places they are pretty certain of finding a ready sale. The treatment of the African slaves is at no time either severe or cruel. During the sea voyage they are not bound, or kept under parti cular restraint. Rice, dates, and fish in sufficient quantities form their food, and a coarse cloth round the middle of the body constitutes their only clothing. Fiom the moment of their purchase at their eventual destination, however, their condition is materially improved, and, considered in the light of valuable property, liable to loss from sickness or death, they are comfortably provided for, and amply fed by their masters. They in return work hard, willingly, and well, and are apparently happy and contented. Mules aie furnished for their conveyance when purchased for re-sale in the interior. The males are employed in all hard and out-door work ; the females in cooking and other domestic, but menial duties, and but very rarely as concubines, except among the poorer and lower classes. The Hubshee slaves of either sex are at all times much cared for, well clothed, and well fed, and treated by their masters with almost equal attention with the members of their own families. The males are early sent to school, and, having learnt to read and write, are employed in the performance of house duties as Peish Khid- muts, &amp;c., and not unfrequently, if intelligent, in the most trustworthy situations, as supercargoes of vessels, stewards, and superintendents. The females are most generally retained as concubines, or employed as attendants in the Harem, in bringing Kaleeoons, and other light duties. The honesty and intelligence of the Hubshee slaves are almost proverbial. Nubian and Hubshee eunuchs are rare, of very great price, and only purchased for the service of the king, nobles, and very rich merchants. Boys are made eunuchs previous to their embarkation, and it is re ported that in consequence of the ignorance of the operators, and the cruel mode of operation, of ten thus mutilated one only on an average survives. The following statement of the number annually imported and sold in the Persian ports is the result of inquiries made at Bushire : Africans. Abyssinians. At Bushire 250 25 At Lingah 350 15 At Congoon 150 10 At Bunder Abbas 300 20SLAVE TRADE. 649 Supposing that the trade in slaves with the ports on the Arabian Coast since 1831, when an estimate was made by Major Wilson, then Resident, has not materially altered, we shall have, in addition to the above,—300 slaves to Bahrein; 30 to Ras-ool-Khyma; and supposing 100 more to the ports of Debaye, Amulgavine, Ejman, and Aboothabee ; total 4o0; making a grand total of 3,488 annually received in Persia, and five or six small towns of Arabia only. Laige as this number may appear, it is allowed, with regret, that if any eiroi has been made it has been on the side of detraction, and not of exaggeration ; and it must be further remembered, that it does not include the slaves brought to Muskat for sale on the spot, or for expor tation, as before stated, to the ports of Sind, and even India. The improved means of gaining information, and the greater earnest ness with which the attention of the British Political Agent has been directed to the traffic in slaves, would account for the apparent increase in the numbei of individuals now annually imported when compared with estimates of former years. Afiican slaves imported, th^ number of males bears a pretty equal proportion to that of the females. Of Hubshees, the greater number are females, in the proportion, per haps, of two to one. The females are somewhat more valued than the males: a good stout lass will sell for 35 or 40 dollars. The profit on the above at Muskat is twenty per cent., and at Bussora and Bushire never less than fifty per cent. The Hubshee females are much prized for their beauty, and symme try of figure ; their value from 60 to 200 dollars, or indeed to any amount. The males also are much valued ; their price from 50 to 150 dollars, and upwards. The slaves of either sex, whether Hubshee or African, of an age exceeding twenty years, on their first sale, are of less comparative value, from their being at that mature age less tractable, and taking less kindly to the language, religion, and customs of their masters. A tax, amounting to about half a dollar, is levied upon every slave at the ports of Bussora, Bushire, Lingah, Bunder Abbas, and Muskat. While every attempt is being made to confine and suppress the Slave Trade in these and all other foreign quarters, it is worthy of remark, that notwithstanding every precaution, and the risk of severe punishment, Price of Africans at Zanzibar.

An adequate estimate may be formed from the accompanying statement, showing those only which have within the last three or four years been discovered and restored to home and liberty at one port alone (Muskat), through the exertions of our late very intelligent Agent, the Jew Khojah Reuben. # In the month of February 1841, the Government of Bombay directed that a strict investigation should be made, with a view to ascertain the correctness of a report which had reached the Home Government, that vessels belonging to His Highness the Imaum of Muskat were in the habit of bringing Negro slaves from Africa for sale at Bombay, and of taking back Hindoo females for the same purpose at Zanzibar. The following is the result of the first inquiries, in the words of the Resident, Captain Hennell:— ' It is with much regret that I have ascertained, from the statement made by Khojah Reuben, that there is but too much reason to believe that the reports made to Her Majesty's Government are not without foundation. I must, however, still report my firm conviction that His Highness the Imaum is not in the slightest degree aware that such a nefarious traffic is carried on by his vessels. * May-June 1839.—An Indian girl recovered from slavery. She had been purchased, then five years old, at Mangalore, five years previous, by Abdoolla bin Khaleefa, an inhabitant of Ras-ool-Khyma, from Saeed, the servant of Syud JafFer, a Dullal or broker of that place. On his arrival at Muskat, dreading the consequences of this proceeding, he voluntarily gave her up to the Native Agent there. The owner of the Buteel in which she had been brought at the same time entered a protest of his entire ignorance of the circumstances under which the child had been embarked in his vessel. She was returned to the place of her nativity in 1841. An Indian girl liberated by the Native Agent after she had been publicly sold in the slave market at Muskat. January-February 1842.—Through the laudable exertions of Khojah Reuben, the Native Agent at Muskat, two Indian girls were liberated from slavery, and subsequently restored to their homes. The one had been decoyed and kidnapped, and quietly embarked from Calcutta ; the other, from Mangalore, had been sold or given awav by her stepmother. I'ebruary 1843.—Another Indian girl released from slavery at Muskat. Belonging, as she did, to the Imaum's sister, the Native Agent was compelled to pay her value, but did so under a protest. The money was subsequently recovered. May 1843.—An Indian girl was recovered by the Shaikh of Bunder Abbas from some Persian pilgrims on their way into the interior. She was sent to the charge of the Native Agent at Muskat, who forwarded her to the Presidency. June 1843. Four Indians were discovered to be in slavery at Muskat; nor was it until the lapse of an entire year that their liberation could be effected, notwithstanding repeated remonstrances addressed to Syud Soweynee, the Governor. The peremptory orders issued by his father. His Highness the Imaum, at the representation of the British Government, had at length the desired effect. July 1843. A Malabaree woman released from slavery, and sent to Bombay.SLAVE TRADE. 651 So far as I can learn, the manner in which slaves are introduced into our Indian possessions is by the males being classed on board the Arab vessels on which they are embarked as part of the crew, while the females are passed off as their wives. As a large portion of the crew of native boats is frequently composed of Negroes, it must of course be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for any examining officer to ascer tain whethei the Africans on board are honhfide seamen, or brought foi sale. I am told, moreover, that so little repugnance is in general entertained by the Negroes themselves to be sold out of the vessels bringing them, that both males and females readily join in the decep tion, and, ii interrogated, seldom it ever fail to corroborate the statement of the Nakhoda or commander as to their composing part of the equipage of the vessel or boat. It was at the same time admitted that great difficulty was experi enced in kidnapping and embarking Indians ; that few only were obtained annually, and these only by stealth. IMio Agent further stated that a great number of Negro and Abyssini an slaves were yearly landed in Bombay, the females being dressed up as men ; while others, he asserted, were passed through the guards by means of bribes. ' The purchasers of such slaves are said to be generally from Luck- now and the Deccan. ' The country craft which trade between the Gulf and Bombay and the Malabar Coast almost all touch at the principal ports within the Gulf, and at Muskat and Soor, either to take in water or goods, before they strike across the Arabian and Indian Seas. Some of these belong no doubt to chiefs with whom we have treaties; but by far the greater number of this description of boats on that line are the property of horse-dealers and other merchants of Bussora, Koweit (or Grane), Bushire, Bahrein, and other smaller places on these shores, and of Bombay, &amp;c. ' The temptation presented to these traders of taking a few slaves to India is very obvious, for the risk, at present at least, is next to no thing. The market being shut, the contraband importation of slaves must yield something, though but little beyond the usual profit, to those who venture on it. The facility with which slaves can be purchased in Lingah, Kishm, Muskat, Soor, and other ports, and secretly con veyed on board, is not greater than that with which they can be landed on the coast of India. There is no effective arrangement in operation for searching such vessels as carry these slaves, eilher at sea by our cruisers, or on arriving at Bombay or elsewhere ; and even if a very expensive establishment were maintained at sea, and in all the bays and landing-places along the whole coast of Western India, for inspect- 84,.. 9 SLAVE TRADE. ina laroo boat?, and every little boat which touches the shore, means would 'still be found, and an agency kept at work, to defeat, with con- piderable success, these endeavours.' In June of the year 1841, the Kheleeya Kussum, a native ship, under British colours, whose owner, Twuz bin Humzan, was on board, arrived at Muskat from Mocha, and the Persian passengers landed forty-five male and female slaves. The owner, on the circumstance being discovered and brought to his notice, lost no time in substituting the flag and register of His Highness the Imaum for those of the British Government, from a consciousness, probably, that he had rendered himself and vessel subject to heavy penalties, for his infraction ol the regulations existing in Great Britain and her dependencies against the Slave Irade. No further steps were taken in the matter, further than that His Highness the Imaum withdrew the protection of his flag at the request of the British Government. The owner, upon this, after incurring much loss from detention, and constantly under dread of impending punishment, adopted the Mocha colours, obtained from the Shereef, and eventually sold his vessel. This was probably not the first case, nor has it been the last, in which the protection and character of the British flag have been made subser vient to the interests of slave-owners; nor can ignorance of the rules and regulations of Government with reference to the Slave Trade be fairly urged as an excuse by the owners and commanders for becoming parties to such nefarious transactions. It may with confidence be asserted that, with very few exceptions, ships under British colours, owned by natives of India, or naturalised subjects, commanded by European officers, and having an Arab or native supercargo, carry a certain proportion of slaves, not perhaps in tended for sale, but as the concubines or personal attendants of the latter; further, that a certain proportion of the crews of Buggalows carrying the British pass and colours, trading between India and the ports of the Persian Gulf, are slaves. It is needless to remark the facility with which a few destined for sale at Bombay or elsewhere could be entered on board as sailors, and the difficulty of making the distinction, unless the individuals would themselves come forward and assert their natural rights.

M.l W'A ■ Agreement with the Persian Government, concluded, in August 1851, by Lieutenant Colonel S heil, Her Britannic Majesty's Minis ter Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary at the Court of Tehran, for the search and seizure of Persian Vessels suspected of being engaged in the Slave Trade ; approved-by Her Majes ty s Government in the month of October 1851. Convention concluded between Colonel S heil and A meer-e -N izam ,/or the detention and search of Persian Vessels by British and East India Compamfs Cruisers. The Persian Government agrees that the ships of war of the British Government and of the East India Company shall, in order to prevent the chance of Negro slaves, male and female, being imported, be permitted for the period of eleven years to search Persian merchant vessels in the manner detailed in this document, with the exception of Persian Government vessels, not being vessels the property of merchants, or theggg SLAVE TRADE. oroDertv of Persian subjects,-with those Government vessels there is to be no interference whatever. The Persian Government agrees that in no manner whatever shall any Negro slaves be imported in the ves- sels of the Persian Government. The Agreement is this I That in giving this permission to search mercantile vessels, and those of subjects, the search shall from the first to the last be effected with the co-operation, intervention, and knowledge of Persian officers, who are to be on board vessels of the English Government. II The merchant vessels shall not be detained longer than is neces sary to effect the search for slaves. If slaves should be found in any of those vessels, the British authorities are to take possession of them, and to carry them away, without detaining or causing them (that is the people of the ship importing slaves) any other damage besides that of depriving them of the slaves. The vessel itself in which the slaves have been imported shall, by the co-operation and knowledge of the officers of the Persian Government, who are on board of the British cruisers, be delivered to the authorities of the Persian ports, who are there on the part of the Persian Government 5 and the authorities of this (the Persian) Government are to punish and fine, in a manner suitable to the crime he has committed, the owner of that slaving vessel who has acted in contravention of the commands of His Majesty the King of Persia, by importing slaves. The British ships of war are not in any manner to interfere with the Persian trading vessels without the co-operation of the Persian Govern ment officers ; but the Persian Government officers must not on their part be remiss in the duty committed to them. This Convention is to be in force for a period of eleven years, and after these eleven years have expired, and the stipulated period has elapsed, if the Persian vessels shall be interfered with, for even a single day beyond the eleven years, it will be opposed to the course of friend ship with, the Persian Government, and to the maintenance of her rights, and this Government will make a demand for satisfaction. If the slaves who have been heretofore in Persia, and are now there, should, from the present date, and henceforward, wish to proceed by sea on a pilgrimage to Mecca, or to India, or travel by sea, they must, with the knowledge of Ihe British Resident in Bushire, procure a pass port from the officer at the head of the Persian Passport Office in Bushire, and no exception shall hereafter be taken to any slave holding a pass port. The passport (regulation) obtained with the knowledge of the British Hesident at Bushire is, like the other stipulations written above, to be for a period of eleven years. This agreement of the right of search, and the appointment of theSLAVE TRADE. !tfi, ■ Hi mill 687 Persian Government officers to be on board the British cruisers, will come in force on the 1st of Rubee-ool-Awul 1268 (January 1st, 1852).

The Articles written in this document have from first to last been agreed to by both parties, and confirmed by the Ministers of both Go vernments, and nothing is to be done in contravention thereof.
