Asked b w Sir E . Fertie as to how much further forward fron the prese nt conpleted portion of the rail wa w at the foot of the Taurus it could be carried b w Cfeman w with German resources onl w . Pichon rex^lied on 2nd Pecember that , as a result pf the enquiries which he had made , he had cone to the conclusion that the Germans would not be able to continue the Faghdad Pailwa^ through the Taurus . He stated that the w wished to produce the inpression that the w could do so but that the^ reail w depended on being able to obtain further kilonetric guarantees through the Z% additiona Turkish Custons duties , to be levied with the conset of the Powers .

Hlo^d , Hon^ : Attache to the Enbass., at Constantinople, on the progress of the Hedjaz Railway fc its influence on Arabian politics . Referring to the obstacles which had to be overcome in construction , Hr tlo^d stated that the question of water supply had so far been the greatst difficulty , that up to llaan it had been overcone fairly well , but that fronthere the water problem had become increasingly difficult , all attempts to sink wells having failed fc water bei&amp;g foundonly at very great depths ft then in insufficient quantities » An additional difficulty related t) tne' supply of fuel which was not to be had inthat part of countr ft which had to be transported over the long line of railway separating Haiffa from the raiilhead. Further , the duty of providing food ft other supplies sufficient for the 7,500 men engaged on the construction work in varying zones resulted in gr at difiiculties ft hardships for both the engineers ft troops . It was stated that the country south of Tebouk as far as lleda'in Saleh , at which place the line was expected to arrive next year , had already been surveyed by Houkhtar Fey who had reported favourably on the c untPy , but held out little hopes of finding water , As wo r,h^ sup-pl. Of labour , Ur Llo„d stated that , as the Shffiihhs had become reconciled to the advent of the line &gt; Arabs were offering themselves in large numbers for employ ■m -n T. +w a +. the number of troops working on theconstruction could consequently be reduced • In regard to the financial condition of the railwa w , Hr LlOyd stated that between the tine the line was comnenced 82 Sept: 1^05 , 45.7 nillion francs had been raised &amp; that there seened to be no doubt that , during the reign of the present Sultan , the railway would not be allowed to want funds . Hr LlOyd further renarked that the question of building a branch line fron Jedda to ilecca was daily be coning no re urgent with reference to the difficulties of construction so far fron a seapoht under special conditions . The delay in building the branch was probably due to the fear of interfering with th canel traffic , which was in the hands of the Sharif of Ilecca , who , if deprived of this profitable source of incone , night be likely to use his influence nore in opposition to than in aid of the railway . The Sultan was also said to have an obstinate dislike to bringing the railway into touch with the sea 8 c thus bringing it within reach of naval hostility . Hr LlOyd was , however , of opinion that the necess ity for joining seened so urgent that it seened fairly certain that the line would be built before very long In connection with the political inportance which the construction of the railway would have upon the situation in the Hejd , Hr LiOyd pointed out that the re-establishnent of effective Turkish control over the ITejd nust cone either fron Fasra 8 c Faghdad or fron He da’in Saleh , 8c that the latter , which was within about five post narches fron Hail , night serve as a strong niliuary base fron which Turkey could conduct operations in Central Arabia 8c the Hejd . Hr LlOyd also stated that the construction of the railway would be liable to affect in no slight degree the political position 8c influence of the Fritish Govt: on the western shores of the Persian Cfuif .^7 i^RUARY J^TS.. .TURKISH ARATIA .

On 4th February , the Political Resident in T. A.rep orted that he had heard on good authority that the-per Porte had instructed the Pali of Iagdad to the effect that no persons owning property on the proposed line of railwa„ were to be permitted to dispose of it prior to a reference to the Porte . It was stated that the Faghdad authorities had also been instructed b„ the Porte to purchase on behalf of Government an w landed properties for sale owned b^ Persians in the neighbourhood of Uendelli Y Khanikin .r&lt;M E M 0 : for March 1907. On 21st February , the G: of I: addressed H.M. * s Secretary of State for India with reference to *the o overtures made b^ 9 and on behalf of 9 Abdul Aziz bin Sa’ud , the T fahabi chief , with a view to the establi shment of a cloa/er connection between himself Sc the British Govt:. Major Cox , P.R. in the Pers: Gulf, ad desired to be in a position to give a definite nswer to these overtures , 3? had recommended that the present opportunity might be taken to come to terms ith the Y r ahabi Chief . Proposals had been made on previous occasions for Br: intervention in the affairs of TTejd, but it had been decided on each occasion that it would be inexpedient to incur the difficulties 8c embarrassment involved • In pursuance of this poliCyH.M.'s Govt: de sired in December 1904 that their interest 8c influenc were to be confined strictly to the coast line of E: rabia , 3? that nothing should be said or done to conn ect them even indirectly with warfare in progress in he interior . Similar instructions were recently recei ed from the Sec: of State , in a telegram , d/: 9/II/6 The G. of I. had already issued the necessar^ orders o Major Cox to ensure strict adherence to the line of % policy which had been laid down , but in the meanwhile they thought it their dut^ to point out that there wer indications in the recent reports that the position of he Turks in Nejd had become increasingly difficult, 8c that they were unable to do more than maintain a mere semblance of power in Hassa where they had recently sustained a somewhat serious reverse at the hands of the local Arabs. In view of the rapid aggrandisementof Bin Sa’ud as indicated by the recent reports they called attention to the opinion expressed by Sir TT. O’Connor in May 1904 , that if Bin Sa’ud succeeded in establishing a Y r ahabi dynasty throughout the centre of Arabia , the result might render Britishinfluence and authority at Koweit precarious . They also invited a pr perusal of their Secret despatch , dated the 11th Jan: 1906 , in which uhey showed that the growing importancef this Chief , if he were hostile to their interests oulh be a danger to their relations with the Trucial chiefs . If the Turks were really likely to disappear 1 rom uhe // stage , &amp; if Bin Sa’ud was to be a power in he land , it seemed desirable that this Chief should , when a suitable moment arrived ,be led to come to a friendly understanding with the British Govt:. In the meanwhile , as some repl^ seemed to be necessary to tte reiterated enquiries which had been m made b, , or on behalf of. Bin Sa f ud , the Govt: of Ind: proposed, subject to the approval of the Sec: of State to conve., an answer to him to the effect that the Brit: Govt: , while anxious to maintain friendly relations with him , so long as he comported himself in a manner consonant with British interests 8c their engagements with Arab Sheikhs on the coast , saw no necessity , under present conditions , for making him an., formal promises of protection which might even have the effect of stimulating Turkish opposition to the consolidation of his authority . The anxiety of the Govt: of I. as to the possible effect of the recent changes in iTejd was heightened b^ the recent passage of considerable bodies of Turkish troops through Koweit , a proceeding which was in contravention of the terms of the status quo Agreement of 1901 b u which the Turks undertook}*! not to send troops to Koweit . The undertaking which the Porte had given related primarily to the offensive movement of troops b u sea to Koweit 8c did not contemplate such a situation as the present in which the Turks had with drawn beaten troops b,, land through Koweit . Still , if -one occU^ r ® n ce were allowed to pass unnoticed , it woul form an inconvenient precedent as tending to bring the Sheikh more directly under Turkish authority or eVen to facilitate a coup de main on Koweit • Xf it were repeated and if the Sheikh resented it , there wol would be some danger that he ra f£frt take direct measures!1&gt; © ■bo si^op 'bhe passage of military parties ■through his territories, 5b this might at an^ moment lead to a disagreeable incident necessitating action on the part of the Br: Govt: which it would be desirable , if possible , to avoid • The G. of I .therefore invited u H.M.*s Govt: to consider whether the opportunity ight not suitably be taken to warn the Turkish Govt: once more against taking action likely to ' add still further to the disturbed condition of this part of Ar abia ”, 5b to intimate to them that , if troops were again moved through Koweit territory on tneir passage to 5b from j?i Nejd , H*M. ’s Govt: would be forced to consider what action should be taken to protect their own interests ./s' - . On the 19th i-ebruar^ , Sir N. O’Connor fonmrded x.o Sir h. G-re^ a memorandum b^ Hr Block reviewing the financial situation of the Turkish Bmpire which , it appeared , was in such an unsatisfactory condition that the Porte would new loans or for the constructions of railways . Sir N. O’ Connor considered that it would be to the advantage of Great Britainas well of other countries to induce , if possible , the Sultan to adopt a sounder financial policy before embarrassing: the Bxchequer with further heav^ charges for further kilometric guarantees of the Bagdad railwa^ .But he did not think that the four Powers would be likely to agree among themselves to interfere in the internal affairs of Turkey in the direct wa u which would be necessary to secure the object in view.Still less did he think that Germany would be willing to co-operate with them in a matter of which the primary objectwas to delay the further construction of the railway respecting which a definite agreement had been concluded between the Ottoman and German Governments. He , however , considered that the situation would be altered if Germany were ta to agree beforehand with the three other interested Powers to at present . i^ven then the task suggested by Mr slock would be so difficult that the Powers would probably prefer to postpone its consideration until a change of regime heldout some prospect that their joint endeavours &amp; to place the finances of the Bmpire on a firmer basis would meet with the support &amp; goodwill of Turkey herself. On the 4th March , Sir B. Grey reported to Sir i* 1 . Berti that he had told M. Gambon that , though the Baghdad railwa formed no part of Bngland’s negotiations with Russia about Persia , it had appeared incidentally in the course of the negotiations that Russia had ceased to regard the railway as something to be opposed at all costs® that she was willing to come to an arrangementwith Germanyabout it, and that , in fact , she felt that no settlement with regard have no justification in pledging further revenues forto Persia would be complete from her point of view unless she had some such arrangement . On the 7th March , Sir Ore,, wrote to Sir A. Nicholsa that , in the course of a conversation which he had had mt with Count Benchendorff , the latter asked him whether ing land would initiate an^ proposal in connection with the B Bagdad Railway , and that he replied in the negative. Count B: stated that M. Ivolsk^ would prefer that the rail wa^ should not be made , but that if it was to be made , the situation must be faced and the best terms secured • Sir B. G-re^ then said that if the railway , which might be made in the long run , became a through route from sea to sea , it was obvious that all the powers Russia, trance Bngland, and G-eman^ , would be affected b., and concerned in it . He therefore thought that , if German^ made an., proposal , it should include an arrangement with Russia. In a letter to Sir B. Lascelles on the 3th March , Sir B.Gre u stated that he had reminded Count Mettemich that , in conversation with others , the latter had expressed himself not altogether satisfied with the relations betwea Ingland and German., and that he had instanced the Bagdad railwa^ and Ingland’s attitude towards it as a cause . Sir L. Gre^ told Count Mettemich that he did not think it fair to quote the Baghdad Railwa^ when it was a subject on which Ingland had not received an u proposals from German.,. Count Mettemich said that he did not suppose thfii German., would make an u proposals and that he had bet-n inf# ormed that Ingland had no interest in the railway except v to see that no fortified port was made on the Persian Gulf Sir L. Gre u observed that , if the railwa., became an alternative route to the lar Bast, going from sea to sea, it must have political consequences which would affect more or less ever., power interested in that region . Count M: was unable to see that it could have an., politica onp or strategic importance so far as Bngland was concerned but Sir B. Gre^ maintained the opinion that the change made b u so great an enterprise must be a matter of interes to neighbouring Powers. Count Mettemich then said that Ge German., had now made further progress with the railwa., &amp;0 that he did not think that an^bproposal which migfht make in the matter would meet the views expressed in Lngland , He added that G-erman^ could never consent , after having made so much progress with the line herself , to be de prived of an u part of it . Sir k. Gre^ replied that he was not aware that , in an u quarter , deprivation had been suggested . Participation was not the same thing as deprivation . On the 16th of March , Sir k.Lascelles forwarded uo Sir k # Gre,, a report- from Mr: Consul-General Oppenheimer giving his views on the subject of the Baghdad Railway scheme so far as it was affected b^ the financial situatin in German^ . Mr. Oppenheimr reported that he had it on abs* olutein trustworthy authority fchat the French and the German financial groups had come to an agreement according to which the Germans should construct the Taurus line from Lregli to Adana (220 kilom:)and the French the next portiQ to Halab (Aleppo)(200-300kilom:). It was stated that this would give the FFrench at Aleppo a junction for their rax railway lines in SMy riaSy ria. Mr. Oppenheimer added that it was generally believed that Great Britain was trying to prevent the construction of the Taurus line , and as there was no inclination under these circumstances to give Gtfeat Britain any chance of influence, British capital for this Taurus line was not wanted » Moreover, the capital fp this line was said to be already secured . Mr: Oppenheimer further reported thatthere seemd to be a desire on the par of Germany that the negotiations with Great Britain should v' be resumed after the Taurus line had been constructed , h but not till then . t' 7 iNo. 110-F.

(Vide para. 189, October 1907.) On the 7th October, Baghdad Railway. the Foreign office for warded to the India Office a copy of the repprt of an interdepartmental Conference which had been held in London on the subject of Baghdad Railway terminus. The Committee stated that they had carefully considered the various ports on the Persian Gulf, not in Persian territory, which would he suitable for the terminus, namely, Bunder Shweikh (near Koweit), Warba Roads, including Urn Kasr, and Basrah. They were unanimously of opi nion that from topographical and hydrographi cal considerations, Bunder Shweikh would undoubtedly be the best site. Next in order of convenience, IVhrba Roadstead was considered to have most advantages; hut owing to the longer distance from the open sea and to the necessity of buoying and lighting the channel, the facilities were not so great as at Bunder Shweikh. Um Kasr, they stated, might possi bly be made useful as a terminus, either in itself or in conjunction with Warba Roads. But it was somewhat more inaccessible than Warha Roads, and the facilities for construct ing a wharf were limited. The Committee further stated that, despite its commercial importance, the promoters of the Baghdad Railway would not adopt Basrah as a ter minus, except in the last resort, as the cost of maintaining a sufficient depth to enable ocean-going steamers to cross the bar of the . Shatt-el-Arab would he considerable. It would be possible to avoid this difficulty^ by cutting a ship canal from Basrah to the Khor Zobeir, hut the time occupied in navigating the canal, and then the channel to the open sea, would he a drawback, as far as passenger traffic and the carriage of mails were concerned. They added that two other places had been suggested as possible terminal ports, namely, Pao and Ras Kathama, at the head of Koweit Bay. Pao was said to have all the disadvantages and none of the commercial advantages of Basrah. As regards Ras Kathama, it was stated that, as the depth of 20 feet at low water was about three quarters of a mile or upwards from the shore, it would he necessary to run out a pier at considerable expense, and the / construction of wharves would also he much more costly than at Bunder Sheikh. L nder these circumstances, the Committee strongly recommended that the strip of foreshore at Bunder Shweikh should he acquired since (1) it would undoubtedly be an asset in negotiations for British participation in the railway, and (2) as, even if these negotiations were to prove abortive, it would be expedientI to consolidate tlie British position at Koweit, in order to counterbalance the prejudicial effects of any German port which might possibly be constructed in the neighbourhood at some future time. In a letter to the Foreign Office, dated the 31st October, the India Office stated that the negotiations, which had recently been concluded with the Sheikh of Koweit for the purchase of the foreshore at Bunder Shweikh (vide paragraph 195, October 1907) with a right of pre-emption of the foreshore in the direction of Bas Kathama, seemed to Mr. Morley sufficiently to secure the position of His Majesty’s Government, if Koweit were finally selected as the terminus. Sir E. Grey concurred in this view. 215. (Vide para. 172, September Carriage service 1907 ■) 0n the . 2Sth between Baghdad and November, the Political Aleppa Resident in Turkish Arabia reported that he had heard that the carriages were taking from ten to twelve days between Baghdad and Aleppo, and that they only ran about once in four days. 216.

Arabia reported that he had heard from the Embassy that Mr. Young, the Vice-Consul for Mosul, would probably take up his duties about the middle of February. On the 7th January, the Political Resident in Turk ; sh Arabia reported to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople that he had received a telegram from Dr. Fischer, a German at Urfa, to the effect that Mr. D. Fraser, a “Times of India” Correspondent, had been robbed and seriously wounded by an Arab at a place near Urfa in the Mosul Vilayet. The Resident was in correspondence with the Vali and the British Consular Agent there on the subject. 8. (Vide para. 2U, December 1907.) On the 27th November, Baghdad Railway. g- r ^ O’Conor re ported to Sir E. Grey that the contract between the Ottoman Government and the Anatolian Railway Co. for the irrigation of the plain of Konia (vide para. 189, October 1907), had been signed, the cost of the work having been fixed at 19,500,000 fr. to be advanced by the Company and paid off by the Government in 35 years, with 5 per cent in terest by yearly instalments. It was stated that of these instalments, £ T. 25,000 was to be paid in cash, guaranteed on the tithes of the reclaimed land, and the balance (£ T. 10,000) was to he represented by the freight of the produce of the district concerned, which was no longer to count as part of the revenue of the railway, and would be made good by the kilometric guarantee. If these receipts did not suffice, the Ottoman Government would make up the deficit from some other source, and if they more than sufficed the balance would go to them. 9. (Vide para. 201, November 1907.) On the 11th November, Yemen affairs the Acting British Consul at Jeddah reported the return to Mecca of the Ulemas sent to the Imam of the Yemen by tho authorities of Hedjaz. As the Imam had refused to receive the deput ation, it did not go beyond Sanaa, from which place a letter had been sent to the Imam exhorting him to resist from further hostilities and to submit to the authority of the Turkish Government. It was stated that in reply the Imam blamed the Turkish officials, notably Ahmad Faizi Pasha for the recent troubles, and declared that there could he no peace in the Yemen until the demands submitted to the Sultan by him had been accepted.CONFIDENTlALi /r TUR'KISH ARABIA. 18. {Vide para. 8, January 1908.) According to an extract Baghdad Railway. f ^ m the dated 6th January, on the subject of German Hall ways in Asia Minor, a contract had been signed by the representatives of the Govern ment and of the Anatolian Railway Company by which the latter had been authorised to to double its share capital at present amount ing to 67,500,000/r. (2,700,000/.) nominal. This important increase had been decided on as the simplest method of providing the capital necessary for certain costly undertakings upon which the Company were shortly to embark. Of the existing share capital only 60 per cent had been paid up. At a meeting of the Board of the Anatolian Railway and Deutsche Bank it had been decided that the latter should take over all the newly-created stock and subscribe immediately only 10 per cent, undertaking to meet further calls gradually, according to the needs of the Railway Company. These needs were reported to be :— First, the cost of doubling the line from Haidar Pasha to Pendik, a distance of about 60 Kilometres; and Secondly, the capital required for the Koniah irrigation works; and Thirdly, the cost of improving and strengthening the Anatolian line to permit the running of an express service in connec tion with the Baghdad Railway. It was stated that the first of these under takings would entail an expense of about 3.000. 000/r. (120 000/.) on which the Govern ment had already guaranteed 6 per cent interest. The second scheme would consume 20.000. 000/r. (800,000/.) to which another 2.000. 000/r. (80,000/.) would have to he reckoned as interest until completion of the work. On this scheme also the Government had guaranteed a minimum of 6 per cent. As regards the third, it w as added that the Company were bound by the Baghdad Railway Convention to spend a minimum of 8.000. 000/V-. (320,000/.) on the repair and improvement of the Haidar-Pasha-Koniah and Eskishehr-Angora lines to permit the running of express trains. A sum of 350,000/r. (14,000/.) from the surplus of the tithes affected to the kilometric guarantees of the line would he paid to meet the interest and sinking fund on the sum of the disbursements under this head. It was also incidently men tioned that the Government had undertaken to provide an equal sum of 350,000/r. to meet the special loss on the express service, which, however, only began when the line reached Aleppo.19. {Vide para. 7, January 1908.)

According to an account of the affair given by the two Moslem muleteers and the Greek servant who accompanied Mr. i raser, the party were met by a mounted Arab, who agreed to lead them to Ibrahim Pasha, but, on failing in his attempt to extort payment, shot Mr. Fraser at one of the halts, wounding him in the left hand and right arm! He also robbed him of nis effects and £17 in cash. On the 11th February, the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia reported that Dr. Yischer of Urfa was taking Mr. Fraser as far as Aleppo. 20. On the 23rd December 1907, Affairs on the Turco- Political Resident £ao 8 rwSoa Uar frOD ? Turkish A ™bia ported that there a feeling of unrest abroad, and that he heard, from a trustworthy source, that it the intention of the Turks to strengthen military position all along the frontier from Fao to Wazna. Pertev Pasha was also said to be on his way to Baghdad from Salonika with a number of cannon and officers. On the 25th January, the Resident reported that 3 guns, 200 cavalry and 200 boxes of ammu nition had lelt Baghdad for Kkanikin, and that the Wali of Pusht*i-Kuh was said to have collected about 12,000 men on the fron tier near Amara.

Baghdad R«lway. ^ ^ ^ ^ tQ Sir A. Nicolson that M. Sevastopoulo, of the Russian Embassy, had called upon Sir C. Hardinge on the 22nd idem, and, by direction of the Russian Ambassador, had communicated to him the substance of a confidential letter from M. Isvolsky on the subject of the Baghdad Railway. Its purport was to the effect that M. Isvolsky had read with interest the account sent him by Count Benckendorff of what had passed between the German Emperor and Sir E. Grey at Windsor, and between Herr von Schon and Sir E. Grey at the London Eoreign Office, relating to the railway. It was stated that great anxiety was felt in Russia as to the influence which the con sequences of the building of the line would have on the actual situation in the Caucasus, Asia Minor and Persia. It was particularly in the latter country, where a junction of the Baghdad railway with the future Persian railways would imply an extension of German commercial interests and competition with existing trade, that alarm for the future was felt. It was added that although England and France had preserved their liberty of action, Russia had not the same position of absolute freedom, since, at the beginning of the recent Anglo-Russian negotiations, M. Isvolsky had given assu rances to Germany that no action would be taken which could in any way prejudice German interests without previous discussion with the German Government. Views had consequently been exchanged between Germany and Russia, with a view to obtaining from Germany guarantees against the exten sion of German influence in Persia and to overcoming the opposition of Russia to the construction of the railway. From this exchange of views there had been no results. The consequence of Sir E Grey’s interviews mentioned above was that a new situation had been created, and, as the Russian Government had fully realised this fact, the question would be carefully considered in all its bearings. The Russian Government had appreciated the manner in which His Majesty’s Government had frankly communicated to them their views on the Baghdad Railway, and they would not fail to acquaint them, as soon as possible, with the results of the enquiry which was to he made. 33. On the 28th January, Sir N. O’Conor The Anatolian Rail- reported to Sir E. Grey way Company. that a contract had been signed on the 25th December 1907, between the Anatolian Railway Company and the Minister of Public Works authorising the2 doubling of the Company’s present capital, thus raising it to 1,35,000,000 fr. The whole of the new shares were to be taken up by the Deutsche Bank, which was to pay a first call of 10 per cent immediately, and undertook to pay further calls as required by the Company. It was stated that the money was required for the execution of two concessions recently obtained by the Company, viz.&gt; the irrigation of the Konia Plain at a cost of 19,000,000 fr. and the doubling of the line from Haidar Pasha to Pendik at a cost not to exceed £ T. 100,000. 34.

In an encounter between them and the Zaptiehs, four deserters had been shot dead and the officer of the Zaptiehs had also been shot. 37. According to a telegram received by Prohibition by the Persian Government of pilgrimages to Kerbala and Nedjef. the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia from the British Legation at Tehran, the Persian Government have prohibited further pilgri mages to Kerbala and Nedjef owing to cholera in the Hedjaz and cases of plague at Kerbala. &amp;TURKISH ARABIA. 58. On the 7th April, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at M^ssr s Ck Ly n ch r &amp; b Co°’b Basrah telegraphed steamer the “ Blosse that, Owing to inse- 1,yncl1 ' curity, the Tigris Mail seryice had been suspended. From details received, it appears that on the morning of the 2nd April Messrs. Lynch &amp; Co.’s steamer the “ Blosse Lynch ” was fired on by Arabs near Amara. Three passen- eers. including one woman who subsequently died, and one fireman, were wounded. Soon after the occurrence, the vessel brought up alongside a Turkish encampment, when the Captain accompanied by Captain McConaghy, the Acting Resident at Baghdad, who was on board, went ashore and reported the incident to the Colonel in command of the troops. The latter was informed that the vessel carried the mails and must proceed to Basrah as soon as possible. Some soldiers were then placed on board, and the Turkish gunboat “ Alus ” was also ordered to accompany the vessel, which continued her journey. At 8-30 the Arabs began firing again; this continued till 9-0, the fire being returned. The danger zone was passed by 9-15 when the escort returned, the “ Blosse Lynch ” proceeding on her journey to Basrah. On the 3rd April, Sir E. Grey instructed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Cons tantinople to bring the incident to the notice of the Porte and press for the punishment of the Arabs. Mr. Barclay replied that the Grand Vizier had assured him that all possible measures were being taken to maintain security of navigation, that troops had been sent to the scene of the occurrence, and that an enquiry was to be held with a view to punishing the guilty parties. It was believed that the incident was the outcome of Arab resentment at certain arrangements affecting the tribes which had been made by the Special Commissioner, Nazim Pasha. On the 13th April, the Consul at Basrah reported that British and Turkish Tigris steamers were again running. 59. (Vide para, 171, September 1907.) „ „ According to a letter edjas ai way. f r0 m its Constantinople correspondent published in the “ Frankfurter Zeitung ”, the Directors of the Hedjaz Railway have made an arrangement with the German geologist, Dr. Blankenkorn, to proceed to Palestine on behalf of the Company in order to prospect for petroleum in the Dead Sea Basin. It is stated that, after the scientist has concluded the examination of this district,2 he will proceed southwards and examine the mineral wealth of the country traversed by the Hedjaz line. In regard to the progress of the Railway, the Consul at Jeddah reported to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Cons tantinople on the 3rd February that work was being done from Medina (where the foundation stone of a station had been laid with much ceremony on the 6th October 1907), as well as from the present rail-head about 100 miles from that town, and that the railway was expected to be completed to Medina by next autumn. It appears to have been decided to prolong the railway from Medina to Mecca via Rabigh and Jeddah, which route is not only free from serious engineering difficulties, but is well supplied with water; whereas the eastern or highland route from Medina to Mecca, also free from serious engineering difficulties, lacks water. The Consul’s report shows that the Govern ment are already making arrangements for steamers to bring railway material to Rabigh, where a pier is, it is said, to be built. The Sheikh of Rabigh is reported to he in favour of the railway project, as Rabigh and his small tribe, which is in its vicinity, would benefit from the increased importance of that town and district. 60. {Vide para. 204, November 1907.)

Attack by Arabs on On the 15th April, His ported that the immediate cause of the trouble was the farming out of certain Government lands at Mejer Saghir near Amarah, the lease of which had expired. The Consul stated that it was the Turkish policy to weaken the big tribal Sheikhs by dividing up the Government lands leased to them into small holdings and apportioning them to individual tribesmen, who would thus be brought into direct relations with the Ottoman authorities, instead of farming them out en bloc to the chief of a tribe, as hitherto. The lurks hoped by this method to break up the old feudal system of land tenure and gradually to acquire greater hold over the nomad popu lation of the Amara Sandjak by weakening the individual power of the Sheikhs. The lands at Mejer Saghir were formerly leased to a brother of Gadban, Sheikh of the Bani Lam, named Faileh. Nazim Pasha gave the lease to one Abul Nefise, a Nedjdi and an outsider, in the face of local opposition, and endeavoured to instal him in his holding by armed force. The project, however, could not be effected. The Turkish authorities explained that the sudden attack on the “Blosse Lynch’* was due to the Arabs being under the impres sion that Nefise was on board her. The Consul was of opinion that this might be a plausible excuse, from the Arab point of view, for the first attack, as Nefise was on the river at the time and was actually proceeding to Mejer Saghir in a sailing vessel, accompanied by Turkish soldiers, to take over his new lease hold ; but that it did not explain the second attack after the vessel had left the Turkish camp, and the scene of the dispute. Taher Pasha, the Commandant, informed the Consul on the 13th April that the cause of the trouble had been removed by the can cellation of the objectionable lease, that the river was quiet, and that nothing more was to be feared. But Mr. Crow considered that, unless some drastic steps were taken, there was no doubt that the Arabs would resort to similar methods in future to gain their ends. On the 29th April, the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia forwarded to His Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople a copy of a letter from Messrs. Lynch, &amp; Co., in which the latter expressed fear of a renewal of the occurrence, in the event of the local authorities taking coercive measures against the Sheikhs of the Bani Lam and the Albu Muhammad.

(Vide para. 32, March 1908.) On the 12th February, Sir ag i a ai way. ^ Lascelles reported to Sir E. Grey that during the discussion of the Foreign Office estimates in the Budget Com mittee of the Reichstag, Herr Erzberger had enquired of the Foreign Secretary as to the present position of the Baghdad Railway and as to the manner in which it had been affected by the Anglo-Persian Agreement- Herr von Schon replied that the Baghdad Railway and the Anglo-Russian Agreement had nothing to do with one another. It was stated that the Agreement between the two Powers regarding Tibet, Afghanistan, and Persia dealt only with commercial in terests, that Germany was only interested in the commercial development of Persia and that the Contracting Powers had dis claimed any intention of interfering with the rights of other Powers. The Baghdad Rail way was, by the Sultan’s concession, a Turkish undertaking with a German character, and the extension of the line depended upon the ability of the Turkish Government to pay the kilometric guarantee of 16,500 marks per kilometre. Germany was* entirely unin fluenced by political motives in the construc tion of the railway. She only wished to re open an ancient land to civilisation and to unlock fresh doors for trade and industry. She had no aspirations towards colonization. Although foreign capital must be employed in the construction of the raiiway, the German character of the undertaking would always be maintained. On the 22nd February, Sir E. Grey wrote to Sir A. Nicolson that Sir C. Hardinge had been informed by the Councillor of the Russian Embassy that Herr von Schon had been continually pressing M. Isvolsky to come to terms about the Baghdad Railway and to agree to the construction of a branch line into Persia via Khanikin. M. Isvolsky had, however, absolutely refused to bind the Russian Government to build the branch railway, on the ground that when railway construction was opened in Persia, on the expiry of the Railway Convention, it -would probably be to Russia’s interest to build some other railway first, and that, in any case, before the construction of a branch of the Baghdad Railway through Persia will be agreed to, Germany must recognise the Russian sphere of influence in Persia. AY hen these terms had been agreed to, the Russian Government would be ready to consider the question of participa tion in the Baghdad Railway and would be ready to discuss the terms a quatre or separately as the other Powers might decide.2 On the 3rd April, Mr. Barclay tele graphed to Sir B. Grey that private inform ation had reached him from a reliable source to the effect that pressure was being brought to bear on the Sultan by the German Ambassador for the construction of three further sections of the Baghdad Itailway on the security of the surplus of the ceded revenues. It was stated that, in view of the present straitened condition of the country’s finances, the Grand Vizier and the Minister of Public Works bad presented a report strongly opposing the scheme of extension. On the 23rd May, Mr. Barclay reported that an Irade bad been issued on the 22nd idem sanctioning the exten sion of the railway to Halif, the junction for Mardin. Bor the construction and working a loan was to be raised which was to be guaranteed by the surplus of the ceded revenues supplemented by the surplus of tithes already assigned for the Anatolian Railway. Subsequent information through Reuter’s telegrams was to the effect that the loan was to amount to 220 million francs and was to be issued by instalments. 103. (Vide para, 215, December 1907.)

With Probable opening of a reference to an enquiry German bank at Bagh- made by the British nople about the probability of a German Bank being opened at Baghdad, the Political Resi dent in Turkish Arabia reported to the Embassy, on the 20th May, that during his recent visit to Constantinople, he had met Herr Guttmann of the Dentsche Orient Bank, who had informed him that he proposed to visit Baghdad in the winter of 1908-09 to see for himself what prospect there was for profit able business there.

On Attack on Messrs the 9th June, the Poli- Lynch &amp; Co.’s steamer tical Resident in Tur- the“BiosseLynch”. Arabia addressed the British Embassy at Constantinople on the subject of the attack on the “ Blosse Lynch ”, urging the punishment of Gadhban and the removal of the Vali of Basrah who was a supporter of Gadhban. Major Ramsay pointed out that the only practicable course of action open to the British Government to protect British interests was to press the Porte to take serious notice of these attacks. lie stated that the Arabs between Basrah and Baghdad had no grievance against the British Government, and that they only attacked British ships as a matter of policy. If their punishment were insisted on, they would leave the British alone in future. On the 16th June, Sir E. Grey instructed Mr. Barclay to enquire from Major Ramsay whether he considered that punishment could be inflicted on Gadhban during the present season and without any very great difficulty. Sir E. Grey considered that further conse quences of an undesirable nature might he entailed by the despatch of a large Turkish force to the neighbourhood in question. In a letter, dated the 25th June, to the British Embassy, Major Ramsay replied that he quite appreciated the danger of large military opera tions causing apprehensions to Persia and the Persian border tribes. He thought, however, that the danger would not exist if the Turks confined their efforts to punishing Gadhban, and if the Persian Government, the Yali of Pusht-i-Kuh and the Sheikh of Mohammerah were informed by British representatives that action was being taken against Gadhban with the approval of the British Government on account of his attack on their steamers. 142. {Videpara. 59, April 1908.) On Hostility of the ,^ r * Bedouins to the Hedjaz Barclay forwarded to Railway. gj r Grey two reports from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Jeddah, with regard to the insecurity of the Jeddah-Mecca road owing to the hostility of the Bedouins to the Hedjaz Railway. In May, large bands of Bedouins, consist ing in part of the tribe of Beni Ali of Awali, had approached the town of Medina and collisions had taken place between the. tribesmen and the Turkish troops under the Command of Osman Pasha Muhafiz, the Governor and Commandant of Medina. • Subsequently reinforcements from the troops constructing the raihvay arrived at Medina and further assistance was despatched from Jeddah.2 The Consul also heard on good authority that the Yali had telegraphed to Constantinople that 20 battalions of reinforcements were needed in the Hedjaz if the construction of he railway was to go on. On the 6th June, the Consul reported another great caravan robbery by Bedouins on the Jeddah-Mecca road. He stated that mer chants in Jeddah, including some British Indians, who were interested in the caravan, were getting very uneasy. 143. (Vide para. 60, April 1908.) Wreck Of the dhow On the 22nd June, Mr. “ Johara ”. Barclay reported to Sir E. Grey that the Mixed Commission, which had been appointed to enquire into the “ Johara ” piracy case, had awarded sums on the different counts amounting in all to 1,025/. as damages, and that the Vice-Consul at Hodeida considered the sum satisfactory. It was reported that the Yali had then com municated with the Borte, that he had stated that the flag of the “ Johara” was not British hut a red one without any distinctive mark, and that the Vice-Consul at Hodeida had admitted that her owner as w r ell as some of the owners of the cargo were natives of Hadramaut and consequently not entitled to British protection. It was added that, after some delay, His Majesty’s Embassy had induced the “ Conseillers Legistes ” at the Porte, to whom the wdiole question had been referred, to report that instructions might be sent to pay direct to the owners of the “ Johara ” and her cargo the amounts awarded by the Hodeida Commission. The Grand Vizier instructed the Vali of the Yemen accordingly, and Mr. Barclay requested the Vice-Consul at Hodeida to press the Vali to pay the 1,025/. awarded and to refer to him should any undue delay occur. On the 24th July, Sir E. Grey pointed out to Mr. Barclay that, of the four Aden merchants interested in the dhow, three, including the owner of the vessel, w^ere subjects of Shehr and Mokalla, and that the fourth Was a British-born subject. He instructed Mr. Barclay to take an opportunity, after the com pensation had been paid, to emphasise to the Ottoman Government the fact that those of the Aden merchants who were the subjects of the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla were British protected persons. 144. On the 3rd August, the Political * Resident in Turkish forTbe^em^am tribe Arabia reported that of Arabs. i ie } ia( t heard on good authority that Sheikh Gadhban of the Beni Lam tribe had been negotiating for the purchase of 10,000 Mauser rifles to be delivered at Mohammerah. The terms were3 that half the price should he paid with the order and half on arrival of the rifles. The business was refused by the man to whom it was offered, hut was, Major Ramsay believed, going to be done by a Baghdad firm. Major Ramsay’s informant stated that he was certain that the offer to buy was a bond fide one, but he thought that the number might be reduced when the time for payment came. 145. On the 11th May, the Political ™ Resident in Turkish Closing of the Jewisn school and synagogue Arabia reported that he at Mosul. ] ]a( ] L received news for His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Mosul, under date the 30th April, to the effect that the local authorities were creating difficulties for the Mission of the Alliance Israelite, which had recently been established at Mosul. It was stated that a summons had been issued against Monsieur Maurice Sidi, the head of the Mission, and that he had been ordered to close his school. On the 6th July, Major Ramsay re ported that he had received information from the Vice-Consul that the Mosul authorities had closed the synagogue and the school. 146. {Vide para. 45 1 March 1907.)

Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Constantinople reported that an Imperial Irade had been issued for the payment of the sum of £ T. 500 as compensation for the murder of Mr. Glan- ville, and that he had received the amount in question. 148. On the 14th May, the Vice-Consul Petroleum oil-fields ot Mosul reported to at Gayara. the Political Resident n Turkish Arabia the arrival at Mosul of a consignment of petroleum from the oil-fields at Gayara, which was being worked by the Harie-i-Sanie. He stated that the petroleum burned brightly and gave a fair light, but that it was very yellow in appearance and smelt horribly. On the 28th idem, he reported that information had reached him to the effect that the French firm of Tassert had made a definite offer to furnish the Daire with expert advice on practically whatever terms the latter cared to offer. Messrs. Lynch &amp; Co.’s Agent had also telegraphed to' his Chiefs at Baghdad to ask them whether they were prepared to send an expert. The Vice-Consul thought that Messrs. Lynch were in the most favourable position4 to take the matter up, hut that, in the event of their not being prepared to do so, other firms might he informed rather than that this opening for British enterprise should be lost. On the 14th June, the Vice-Consul informed Major Ramsay that there were rumours to the effect that a French expert had been engaged, hut that, in the course of convers ation he had with Ibrahim Pasha, the head of the Administration of the Imperial Domains, the latter had twice stated that no decision had yet been arrived at. On the 22nd July, the Vice-Consul wrote to Major Ramsay to the effect that the French expert was coming to superintend the production of oil at Gayara, and that the matter had been arranged on the arrival of the expert at Aleppo. That the name of the firm concerned appeared to be Tassert and that, according to particulars furnished by Ibrahim Pasha, the contract was for three months, and might he terminated at the end of that period. Major Ramsay in for warding the Vice-Consul’s reports to the Prin cipal, Commercial Department, Intelligence Branch, Board of Trade, London, on the 3rd August, pointed out that information on certain points, which would he considered essential by any firm proposing to take up the business, seemed to be lacking. As the Vice-Consul intended going to Baghdad via Gayara, Major Ramsay thought that it would be well to await his report after a personal inspection of the springs. It was added, how ever, that the matter had been brought to the notice of the British firms at Baghdad.r* kj ONFIDENTIAL. . o t * /('MO y&lt; ■twf / tJA.-':'- ft** TURKISH ARABIA. 168. (Vide para. 141, August 1908.) In a letter to Sir E. Grey, Attack on Messrs, dated the 16th July, LvBcb- Co. s steamer tt # hit * ±9 c the “Blosse Lynchs His Majesty’s Charge d’AfTaires at Constanti nople stated, 'with regard to the proposed punitive measures against Gadhban, that, although he was not in so good a position as Major Ramsay to judge of the difficulties which this course would involve, it seemed to him that serious fighting might be necessary, and that there might he further prolonged interruption of the river traffic. In these circumstances, and as he was not convinced that some of the previous attacks had been specially directed against British ships, since native craft had also been attacked, he was not prepared, without instructions, to undertake the responsibility of pressing the Porte, in the sense desired by Major Ramsay. Mr. Barclay further stated that, if it was decided to press for the punishment of Gadhban, it would be essential that Hassan Bey should be removed. He added that, as the result of Nazim Pasha’s complaints from Baghdad in connection with the disturbances, it had been decided to dismiss Hassan Bey, but that this decision had been subsequently rescinded, though the Vali was given to under stand that his retention in office was condi tional on his effectually preventing a recurrence of tribal attacks on the navigation of the Tigris within his district. On the 29th July, His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Constantinople reported to Sir E. Grey that Major Ramsay had informed him that quiet at present prevailed among the Arab tribesmen on the Lower Tigris, that the Provincial Government was bankrupt and could not provide money for offensive mea sures. The Vali, it was stated, was endeavour ing to borrow from the merchants to meet immediate requirements. On the 10th August, the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia reported that, with the existing condition of affairs at Constanti nople, it seemed improbable that any serious attention could be diverted to Gadhban and his conduct in attacking the “ Blosse Lynch ”, Major Ramsay happened to meet a secret agent of Gadhban at Baghdad and told him that the British policy was one of non-intervention in the internal affairs of Turkey, but that, if2 the Arabs forced the British Government into taking one side or the other, they would certainly take sides against the person who had attacked them. Major Bamsay had no doubt that the message would reach Gadhban, and hoped that it might have some effect. On the 13th August, the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company reported to the Foreign Office that, from a telegram received by them from their agents at Baghdad, there had been fighting among the Arabs on the Tigris, and that their steamer the “ Khalifah ”, w ith the dowmward mail, had been detained at Kut, as the Vali considered that it v r as not safe for the vessel to proceed. On the 14th idem, Sir E. Grey instructed His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople to ask the Grand Vizier to take such steps as were required to restore order and to afford protection to the “ Khalifah ”. On the 17th idem, the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia reported that, on a favourable report being received from the Vali, the steamer continued her voyage to Basrah and caught the English mail. In connection with this disturbance, 700 soldiers were said to have gone from Amarah to Ali Gharbi. 169. On the 10th August, the Political The new Turkish Resident in lurkish Constitution. Arabia reported that he had received a telegram from His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople informing him that he had congratulated the Ottoman Government on the revival of the Turkish Constitution, and authorising him to let it be known that the new movement would receive the full support of the British Govern ment as long as it made for reform and good government. Major Ramsay accordingly took steps to make known the sympathy of His Majesty’s Government with the new regime, and also offered his congratulations to the Vali. He stated that, as far as Baghdad was concerned, the immediate result of the newly granted freedom was that the officer of Censor had been practically, if not technically, abolished, that there was now absolute freedom of speech, and that telegrams regarding poli tical matters were accepted by the Telegraph Office without objection. It was added that the younger portion of the population was excited but orderly, wdiile the older people seemed a little suspicious as to what such sudden changes might mean. Major Ramsay reported that, on the 4th August, a large deputation of officers of the Vlth Army Corps went to the office of Sidki Pasha, the Commander of the Corps, to ask him why he had not published any information regarding the privileges that3 had recently been granted, and why there had been no illuminations and public rejoicings. The Commander-in-Chief fearing personal violence . would not meet his officeis. The Yali subsequently appeared on the scene, when the officers were informed of the orders that had been received from Constantinople. A public demonstration and illuminations then took place. It was further stated that the Com mander-in-Chief was to be succeeded by Osman Pasha from Monastir, and that, pend ing his arrival, Zekki Pasha from Mosul would be in temporary command of the Vlth Army Corps. According to a subsequent report, Muhammad Pasha, Dagbestani, Com manding the troops at 'YYazna, was expected at Baghdad as temporary Commander of the Corps. On the 17th August, Major Ramsay reported that a Club and a Committee (two separate bodies) of Young Turks had been formed. The Club was intended to be social and non-political, and persons of all respec table classes were, it was understood, eligible for membership. The Committee of Union and Progress was said to be frankly political. Major Ramsay stated that no Secretary had so far been appointed, and that, until the Committee became more properly organised, it was difficult to learn what was taking place. 170.

Situation in the On the 30th July, Hedjaz. the Acting British Consul at Jeddah reported to the British Embassy at Constantinople that, on the 12th idem, a large number of the Masruh division of the Barb tribe had committed a night attack on the camp of the Turkish soldiers at Bir Rumah, about two miles from Medina, and had been repulsed with very heavy loss. On the l7th idem, Medina was again attacked by a large number of Bedouins, who were repulsed with heavy losses. A dhow r belonging to a British Indian was also said to have been attacked on the 1st July by armed pirates of the Metemeh tribe, wTiile anchored at Moajjiz, near Shageg, between Lohaya and Confidah. The Captain and crew, six in number, were over-powered,and having been relieved of all their belong ings, were sent ashore and left to their fate. They ultimately met two sailing vessels bound for Jeddah and were taken on board. The owner ot the dhow reported the piracy to the Consulate and lodged a claim of 241/ for compensation. His Excellency Ahmed Ratib Pasha, who was at Jeddah, had promised the Acting British Consul that he would settle the indemnity claim within a month. 172. {Fide para. 142, August 1908.) nyx. -a a- x. i The Consul reported The Hedjaz Railway. , 1 , ,1 , K . that the construction of the Hedjaz Railway had been completed up to about 2u miles from Medina, and that it was expected to reach that place by the middle of August.TURKISH ARABIA. 194.

Q f °7^T n i 0n the 19t h September, on the “ niosse Lynch.” His Majesty s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company with reference to their claim against the Ottoman Government on account of the attack on the “Blosse Lynch”, that Sir Gerard Lowther had drawn attention to the fact that under the new system of Govern ment which had been inaugurated in the Otto man Empire it would be possible to count much more than in the past on the good-will and probity of the authorities in dealing with questions ot this kind, but that at the same time the change was attended with a con siderable revival of Turkish national feeling and, in consequence, with a tendency to restrict the privileged position of foreigners. His Excellency pointed out that the fact that the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navi gation Company’s steamers plied on the internal waters of Turkey under a foreign flag was, therefore, not unlikely, in present circumstances, to be viewed as an infringe ment of the sovereign rights of the Ottoman Government, and, further, that the Eirman, on which the rights of the Company were based, was loosely worded, but certainly gave the right to navigate on the Euphrates, and not on the Tigris. In these circumstances it seemed to Sir G. Lowther advisable in the interests of the Company that they should limit their claim to actual losses incurred, and that they should rather endeavour to gain the good-will of the new Ottoman Government than ask for the intervention of His Maj'esty’s Embassy at Constantinople. It might even well be considered whether the unsettled state of the country and the conse quent closing of the river to sailing vessels during several months did not to some extent bring profit to the Company, and, if so, whether it was necessary to insist at all on the question of compensation for the loss. Sir E. Grey, who entirely concurred in the observations of Sir G. Lowther, consequently thought it best, in the interests of the Comp any, to instruct His Excellency not to press their claim officially on the Sublime Porte, but to recall it to their notice in a friendly manner,2 if on consideration the Company still wish ed this done, and to suggest, when oppor tunity offered, that the Valis of Baghdad and Bussorah should he warned of the serious conse quences which might follow a further incident such as the attack on the “ Blosse Lynch”. It was reasonable to expect that such a warn ing would have more effect in the present cir cumstances than it would have had a short time ago. 196. His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople has been asked by the Turkish English Engineers for Ministry of 1 ublic irrigation works in the Works whether there Vilayet of Adana. are anv English Engineers having experience of irrigation work in Egypt, &amp;c., who would be willing, if required, to take service under the Ottoman Government in connection with the important works of irrigation already decided upon in the Vilayet of Adana. The Political Besident has reported that it is officially stated at Baghdad that Sir William Willcocks has been engaged to advise the Turkish Government on matters connected with irrigation, and t .at he will start for Baghdad at an early date.3(r- TURKISH ARABIA. 207. On the 2nd November the Political Navigation “ of the Resident in Turkish rivers in Turkey. Arabia informed His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople that, in his opinion, the approaching visit of Sir William Willcocks to Mesopotamia (vide para. 196 of the memorandum for October 1908) made it desirable that the question of the future navigation of the rivers of the country for commercial purposes should be considered. He enquired, for instance, whether it was within the region of practical politics to raise the question of the rights of British vessels, whether owned by Messrs.Lynch or other British subjects; or to increase the number of British vessels on the rivers of Mesopotamia; or to use existing vessels on the rivers, except between Baghdad and Basrah ; or to hope for any new concessions for vessels flying the British flag on Turkish inland waters. Assuming that the answer would he in the negative, the Resident suggested the possibility of coming to some arrangement with the Turkish Government by which British subjects could run steamers flying the Turkish flag on the condition that such ships should be considered Turkish soil. The owners would consequently be considered Turkish subjects in all matters that concerned them as owners of the ships. This principle would be only extended to ships intended for exclusive use in the inland waters of Turkey. A similar status was given to British subjects who owmed immovable property in Turkey. Major Ramsay presumed that other nations would be entitled to equality of treatment, should such be claimed. In the meantime, it would be a great advantage if permission could be obtained first for British subjects and some steamers could be actually got on the river, before foreign rivals had given the matter their attention. 208. On the same date Major Ramsay Visit of the Mir of informed His Majesty’s Khairpurto Baghdad. Ambassador at Constan tinople that His Highness the Mir of Khairpur, a Native Chief of India, w ho was on his w ay to Baghdad, had chartered the S. S. JBlosse Lynch for his journey, and was anxious that this vessel should take him to Khadimain, a place on the Tigris five miles above Baghdad. Major Ramsay sent his Dragoman to see if this arrangement could be made, but the local authorities, while anxious to give the Chief every facility, hesitated to allow r one of Messrs. Lynch’s steamers to go above Baghdad, unless it* was expressly stated that it would not be treated as a precedent. A satisfactory arrange ment was subsequently arrived at ^howeverwithout raising any question as to Messrs. Lynch’s rights. 209.

(Vide para. 209 of the Memorandum the Political Resident reported that a reception was held by him on the occasion of His Majesty’s Birthday (9th November). Hitherto the only Turkish subjects seen at these recep tions have been as a rule the Vali and some times the Comraander-in-Chief. This year, however, the Consul-General’s reception was attended by a deputation of persons selected by various classes of Turkish Ottoman Society, including representatives of the Ottoman Club, the Committee of Union and Progress, the Baghdad Press, the O dicers, the Doctors, the Chamber of Commerce, the Kurdish Society, and the Ulemas. An address was read in Turkish expressing gratitude at the action of Great Britain in connection with the reform movement. The members of the deput ation asked if there would be any objection to their sending a congratulatory telegram to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Poreigh Affairs. The Political Resident replied that he knew of none. » In addition to the formal address a number of short impromptu speeches were made emphasising the confidence which the people of Turkey feit in the friendship of the British Government. During the day the Turkish steamers on the river were decorated with flags, and in the evening one of the steamers was illuminated and brought down to the Residency where it was anchored. Some of the gentlemen who had come to the reception in the morning came again to the Residency, and more friendly speeches were made. 225. ( Vide para. 208 of the Memoran- Viait of the Mir of dum for November Khairpur to Baghdad. 1908.) Major Ramsay reported on the 16th November that he had heard that His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basra and the Commander of H.M.S. “Lapwing” paid official calls on His High ness the Mir of Khairpur, but that His High ness left Basra without returning the calls. He was treated with great, indeed excessive, consideration by the Turkish authorities, hut, unfortunately, the Mir appeared to have no one with him capable of making proper arrangements. Visitors of position were received at his camp without any semblance of formality. Major Ramsay was away from Baghdad when His Highness arrived, but went to see his sons (or nephews ?) and had to force his way through a crowd of dirty ill-dressed followers and pilgrim agents.

Nakki Bey said that the present Yali of Baghdad was an honest and energetic official w r ho would not, like his predecessor, foment the tribal trouble in which the attack on the steamer originated. He added that it was proposed to increase the local forces at Baghdad to enable them to cope w ith tribal disturbances.CONFIDENTIAI TURKISH ARABIA. 12.

( Vide paragraph 207 of the Memo- Navigation of the randum for November rivers of Mesopotamia. 190&amp;.) Colonel Ramsay recently endeavoured, with the approval of His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constanti nople, to obtain permission from the Yali of Baghdad to take the Residency steamer “ Comet ” up to the Hindiya Barrage on the Euphrates on the pretext of affording Sir 'William Willcocks an opportunity of inspect ing the projected irrigation works. The Yali, when approached on the subject, replied that he saw no objection, but subse quently qualified his assent with the proviso that he should not be held responsible for the conduct of the Arabs in the Basra Vilayet. Colonel Ramsay said he had nothing to fear from the Arabs if the Basra authorities were directed not to be obstructive or to send alarmist telegrams to Constantinople. The Vali seemed doubtful on this point and suggested that a message should be sent to the Grand Yizier. The latter replied that “ there might be objections ” to Sir William going up in the “ Comet ”, and that it would be better if he hired another vessel. The Resident, therefore, abandoned the idea of making the trip, but he considers that nothing has been lost by the negotiations, for his conversations with the Vali and the latter’s reference to Constantinople show clearly that the real question at issue was not whether he could take the “ Comet ” up the Euphrates, but whether the Turkish Government would like its engineeer to ask the British Resident to take him up in that vessel. Colonel Ramsay now proposes, the next time he is at Basra, to take the “ Comet ” a short way up the Euphrates, nominally in search of good shooting, but really to get the Basra Vilayet officials accustomed to seeing the ship pass Gurna.^z- GONFfDP'MTIA?.

(Vide paragraph 12 of the Memo* Disturbances on the randum for March Tigris. 1909.) Reports re ceived from the Political Resident show that the country between Basrah and Baghdad is much disturbed owing to the depredations of the Arab tribesmen who are said to have been goaded, into turbulence by the exactions of dishonest officials. Traffic on the river is practically at a standstill. Colonel Ramsay has brought the gravity of the ‘situation to the notice of His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. He suggested that the appointment of an honest Whli at Basrah and an honest Mutassarif at Amara with Military Commanders who would try to carry out their policy, and the judicious use of the existing Turkish Government steamers on the river for certain offensive and defensive measures which he outlined, would go far towards the restoration of order. In the meantime, Colonel Ramsay has been in com munication with the Commandant of the Vlth Turkish Army Corps on the subject of the pro tection of the river traffic, and the latter has agreed to make certain arrangements, but offiy of a defensive nature.[Confidential.] Memorandum of information recoined during the month of 190^, regardina __ external affairs relating to ' r^o/g.—TliU memoranflmn is based upon reports the accuracy of which it is not always possible to guarantee.]4~5 TURKISH ARABIA. 9. {Vide paragraph 9 of the Memo- Disturbances on the randum for April Tigris. 1909.)

Some Saiyids and others, who used to draw stipends from Sultan Abdul Hamid, are now no longer in favour, their stipends having presumably ceased.

It is said that the head-quarters of the Turkish administration will be withdrawn to Namakba; that the Imam of Yemen will be appointed ruler of north-eastern Yemen with head-quarters at Sanaa; and that the Shafai tribes of south-western Yemen will be asked to elect a ruler. The Resident states that it is probable that the measure will result in the declaration of in dependence by the Imam who is working in harmony with the Arab Mulla Sabia who has great influence and a large following; that tribal fighting will become general throughout south-western Yemen; and that Mokha will thus lie at the mercy of any Power.
