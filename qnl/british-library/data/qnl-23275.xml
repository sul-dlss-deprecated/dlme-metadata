The political Resident is pressing me to get the replies as soon as possible and I should be glad if you could do so; though I realise that any appearance of anxiety by us may have the effect of making the replies more difficult to obtain.

I was, however, most shocked to soe that you had communicated this matter in G.T.C. which is not a con fidential code and even when reversed can be decoded by almost anyone. And on no account should you use G.T.C. for a matter which has the slightest confidential aspect. Since you have no confidential code or cypher, this will mean that all confidential or secret communications from you must be sent by secret letter. But this cannot be helped and is better than breaches of security such as that which you have committed by sending your telegram No. 815 dated the 25th July, 1945. 3. I entirelyapprove of your going to Has al Khaimah in order to explain what is required to the sheikh in the / S matter of the reply to the lor.ter regarding ,, Jurisdietion ,, and I hope that you succeed in obtaining the letter from him, from Sharjah and Abu Dhabi. I have already written to you that I should be glad of all the replies as scon as possible.

I went to Qhaid last Friday in order to see if the Falaj 1 s wauer spring is flowing and also make contact with Shaikh Muhammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin. He was very friendly and was much impressed by the present which you have given him. He again offered his services to the Government. Regarding jurisdiction.

He has not yet sent any reply but I understand he intends to consult the luler of Ras al Khaimah before doing so. Before proceeding to Ras al Khaimah he tried to fool the Ruler of Dubai by suggesting to him not to approve but I frustrated his efforts and got the Shaikh of Dubai to send in his reply of approval, i will write to you officially in detail when i receive all or most of the replies.

As soon as replies from the rest of the Shaikhs are received I will forward them to you* 3* The Shaikh of Sharjah has not replied yet and is still at Has al Khaimah* He is, however, expected back in Sharjah either today or tomorrow. On his arrival I shall do my best to obtain a proper reply from him and forward it to you. 4. No reply has so far been received from the Ruler of Abu Dhabi as it takes some tome for a letter to reach him ana for his reply to come. 5. When your letters were delivered on 19th July, the Shaikh of Sharjah sent his brother Shaikh Muhammad bin Saqr on the night of that day to Dubai to see Shaikh Said, in order to sound him and to suggest to him not to agree. Shaikh Said and his son Shaikh Rashid told Shaikh Muhammad that they cannot be the first persons to refuse, but that if the Shaikh of Sharjah and the Shaiki of Ras al Khaimah did so, he will follow suit. Shaikh Muhammad returned to Sharjah and reported what had happened to the Shaikh oi Sharjah who left for Has al Khaimah the folbwing day in order to visit his family there. Before leaving for Ras al Khaimah he had, however, said that he would consult the shaikh of Ras al Khaimah about this, on 21st July shaikh Rashid son of ohaikh aaid bin * Makturo of Dubai came to see me with your letter and said that he was puzsled aDouo it and could not understand what iu really meant I exppfcainecl/-, / 2 I explained to him in the form indicated by you and he was greatly relieved. He promised to send rne a reply of approval next day but no reply came until tire 2ord of July. Feeling that he might have the been influenced oy/ill-advice of the bhaikh of gharjah, I decided to go and see shaikh Saidj about it. Accordingly I went to Dubai on 24th. July and met shaikh said, in the presence of his son Aashid, I enquired from him why he did not send his reply whereas . he promised to do so within a day. lashid at once said that he forgot all about it and that he „ill send it definitely on that day. pe fulfilled his promise and sent his reply in a proper form on the same day. 6. I do not think that Bethel case will have any effect in persuading the Shaikh of Sharjah to cede jurisdiction. He did not evince much interest in it when it occurred as it did not affect his or his subject^* interests. I think his object in leaving for Has al Khaimah without sending his reply is to wait and see whether the other Trucial Shaikhs will agree or not. In any case, I hope I will succeed in obtaining a proper reply from him when he returns to Sharjah. 7. Regarding paragraph 2 of your letter unaer reference. I am very sorry that my action in communicating this matter to you in G.T.C* was not the correct procedure. I beg to state that this office used to communicate matters of a confidential or secret nature to Bahrain by reversing the groups of G.T.C. and I merely followed this practice not having the least idea that it did not meet with your approval.

He said that his reply ms based on previous correspondence between him and the Government and that he saw no reason to disregard it. I then spent more than one hour trying to dispel his misgivings and to persuade him, to give a reply in the form we want, n nd eventually succeeded in achieving this object. He promised to give me a reply of approval . He then retired for his prayers and when I met him again afterwards he asked me to prepare a draft reply for him.

They have been saying tnat the Government's object in asking for formal approval of the Trucial Shaikhs to their exercising jurisdiction is to appoint British advisers for the Trucial Coast and set up organised Law Courts with competent judges such as those of India and strip the Shaikhs from all authority. I, of course, did all my best to contradict all these unfounded statements and to show that they are •completely absurd.'

The following are my commentss- (1) Part I 8(i)(a)(ii ). The word 'severally* has not been inserted - 'generally* is presumably an error. (2) 'QATWAIN' is I think the correct spelling and should be adhered throughout cf. preamble and amendment under the definition of Trucial Sheikhs in article 4 of Part I. 'Qaiwain' is used in Lorimer, and most closely represents the first vov/ei of the word. (3) Similarly 'SHEIKHS' should be adhered to throughout cf. Article 2 of Part I. (4) Article 4 of Part I - Definition of a British protected Person. (a) I am not clear why the expression should include a person 'other than a corporation'? properly enjoying His Majesty's protection in the Trucial States. (b) Corporations properly incorporated under the law in His Majesty's dominions, etc., are included under the definition isJt British Subject. (c) British corporations not incorporated under the law would be excluded from our jurisdiction if the present draft stands. I think that the phrase 'other than a corporation' might be omitted. 5. Judicial Assistant - Article 4 of Part I and in Article 15. There does not in fact appear to be a post of Judicial Assistant in existence vide Residency letter No. 1061 of the 23rd May, 1931, and so substitution of the word »a» for 'the* in the term 'the Judicial Assistant' in Part III Article 15 should, I suggest, be made. The paragraph would then conform with the definition in Part I Paragraph 4. 6. I am doubtful if the definition of 'Trucial States subjects' Pars I Paragraph 4 is sufficiently close to cover the floating Persian population of the Trucial States and to /give us- 2 - give us jurisdiction over them. The only satisfactory solution that occurs to me is the publication by the Trucial States of a Nationality Law on the lines of the Bahrain Nationality Law. This might take some time and so to avoid holding up the present Order in Council I think the draft might stand and the definition be amended in due course. Sd./- A.C.

The letters of cession of jurisdiction from the Trucial Shaikhs, and the draft Trucial Coast Order in Council give us jurisdiction over all persons who are not Trucial State subjects. Persians would therefore normally fall under our jurisdiction. There are, however, numbers of Persians domiciled in the Trucial Coast and it is possible that, as at Kuwait, the Rulers regard them as Trucial subjects. Please report if in fact this is the case and, if so, whether the number involved is large.

A claim for 91 cases of tea and 2 boxes of camphor was submitted to me by one Muhammad bin Abdur Rahman Zaruni, a Persian resident of Umm al Qaiwain, against Haji Baqir bin Abdul Latif, a Muscat subject. Details of the case are as follows:- The plaintiff claims that 91 cases of tea and two boxes of camphor were shipped for him by his brother from Goa on the sailing craft of one Salih Ibrahim Shuzai 1 . When the boat arrived at Khassab on its way. to Umm al Qaiwain, the agent of the defendant, one Taqi bin Abdul Husain approached the Nakbuda and asked him to hand over the tea §nd camphor to'!him. The Nakhuda replied that he could not do so without the permission of the consignee. Thereupon Taqi produced a letter addressed to the Nakhuda said to have been written by the plaintiff instructing the Nakhuda to hand over the goods to him which was done. Taqi then brought the goods to,Dubai for sale. A s soon as the plaintiff heard that Taqi had taken delivery of the goods on the strength of a forged letter, he proceeded to Dubai and complained to the Ruler of Dubai who issued an injunction ord_er on the goods and referred the matter to the Majlis for a decision. After hearing both sides the Majlis decided to postpone the case for a period of one month to enable the defendant to produce more evidence. In the second session of the Maiis which was held on the 12th August, the case was decided in favour ofthe plaintiff. Before the Ruler of Dubai could confirm the finding of the Majlis the defendant's agent brought a letter fuom Sayid Ahmad bin Ibrahim, Minister for Internal Affairs, Muscat, to the Shaikh of Dubai asking that the case be referred to Muscat for hearing. The Shaikh of Dubai, for certain reasons in which he is interested, hesitated to act against the wishes of the Muscat authorities, and showed his unwillingness to de^l with the matter any further The plaintiff was, therefore, compelled to submit his claim to me. I enterained the claim as both sides are foreigners and / gave the defendant 15 days* time to send BAHRAm RECEIPT. a r&gt; r0 per power of attorney to his agent. The defendant, * Date... £ however, after a long delay,* refused to send a power of Confidential.attorney to his agent and induced the Minister for Internal Affairs to the’Muscat Govt to write again to the Shaikh of Dubai, demanding that the goods be handed, over to the defendant and suggesting that the plaintiff be directed.to go to Muscat and lodge his his claim before the Muscat Courts if he so desired, Ke challenged our jurisdiction over Muscat subjects on the Trucial Coast • I have, however, disregarded this argument which is wrong and referred the matter afresh to the Majlis to which were added two new members# The Majlis examined all the documentary evidences of both sides and upheld their former finding which is to the effect that the goods in dispute have been proved to be the property of the plaintiff(Muhammad bin Abdur Rahman Zaruni)# I,am in entire agreement with the finding of the Majlis andrequest your permission to confirm it# As the goods in dispute have since a long time been under restraint and are liable to deteriorate or fall in price, I shall be grateful if you will kindly pass an early decision in the matter#Dated the 10th of November, 1946. Reference correspondence ending with Residency Memorandum No.c/254 dated the 8th June, 1946. I enclose a copy of Residency Agent, Sharjah’s Memorandum dated the 3rd November, 1946. I propose, if you have no objection, to inform the Residency Agent that he should con firm the decision of the Dubai Majlis. Although the Trucial States Order-in- Council has not yet come into force I suggest that the Muscat Government should be informed that we exercise jurisdiction over all foreigners in the Trucial Coast Shaikhdoms. 4.

A.C. Haji Baqir Abdul-Latif has come to us reporting that their son Taqi has proceeded to your State Dubai with 91 cases tea for sale. This quantity of tea was purchased for them by their agent Abdul-Khaliq at Goa from a merchant named Gamilyo Jomas M. This purchase was effected after the latter merchant had shipped the goods in the boat of Nakhuda Salih bin Ibrahim of Shizao, and from whom he obtained a receipt. Thereupon their above agent wired them to receive the tea from this Nakhuda. At the same time the above merchant Gamilyo wired the Nakhuda instruct ing him to deliver the tea to them. After they have receiveu the telegram from their agent, they awaited the arrival of the boat at Muscat with this consignment as it had been arranged between the seller Gamilyo and Nakh&amp;da Salih to take the goods to them. The above (Nakhuda) did to the contrary and went to Khasab parts, hwere their son Taqi followed him and took the goods from him, which he (latter) has taken to your State Dubai for sale. They have now been informed that you have attached the goods on account of a claim put up by one of Ummul-Qaiwain*s people. I request you to deliver the consignment to its owner Haji Baqir bin Abdul-Latif through his agent Mosa bin Haji Jawad who is coming to you. If anyone of Ummul-Qaiwain's people or others have a claim of right against Haji Baqir for this consignment, he should come to us and we Inshallah will give him redress. I hope that this agent will return to us with the consignment of his master. Thanking you for your good’efforts.

A.C. Your letter dated 2nd Ramadhan 1365 (30-7-46) has been received add I have noted its contents regarding the claim of Haji Baqir Mth Mohammed bin Abdur-Rahman. God saves you, please note that on 9th Shaban 1365 (8-7-46) Taqi agent of Haji Baqir appeared before me and I sent both parties to Majlis-ul-Tijarah at Dubai. The latter asked both parties to bring proofs, after which when the claim has been proved for one party, the other is to defray all expenses. The proof which proved the tea for Mohammed bin Abdur-Rahman is the letter which was forged by Taqi agent of Haji Baqir in the name of Mohammed bin Abdur-Rahmar and through which he received the consignment from the Nakhuda. I am enclosing the letter together with the two Majlis reports. Inshallah you will peruse them from which you will find the right. U.E. IP LTranslation of letter No.837/5, dated 17th Shatiwal 1365 (13-9-46) from Saiyid Ahmed bin Ibrahim to the Ruler of Dubai. A.C. With reference to our letter to you of 2nd Ramadhan 1365 (2-7-46) regarding the 91 cases tea which has been claimed by Mohammed Abdur-Rahman against Haji Baqir Abdul-Latif, in which I have asked you for its release to Haji Baqir’s man. As he (Baqir) is a subject of His Majesty the Sultan, God save him, the claimant should come here to file a case against his opponent and he will get j*edress, but I have received your letter of 24th Ramadhan 1365 replying on the same subject,contents of which I have noted also studied all the enclosures. We have see the finding of the Committee, and in the end the case was decided that the goods are for Mohammed bin Abdur-Rahman relying on the statement of the Nakhuda, the evidence of Khasab Wali, other points according to the plaintiff’s invoice, and the letter, which the plaintiff says that it had been forged. After all that you have transferred the case to the Residency Agent at Sharjah, who has asked Haji Baqir to send his agent in an officia way etc. Please note that the finding of that Committee, after they went through those proofs and on which they relied, is contrary to justice. Firstly, you have already been informed that the defendant is a subject of His Majesty the Sultan, before the Committee was formed. Also the statement of the Nakhuda, on which they relied (in their finding) has now been considered that the Nakhuda is an opponent, and his statement is independable for a finding to be based without a proper proof. The second proof is that of H.E. the Wali of Khasab, on which the Committee gave their finding, does not say that the goods belong to Mohammed bin Abdur-Rahman. The Wali only endorsed the statement which the Nakhuda declared before him, add also the evidence of the Khasab Customs official is the same. The two parties did not appear before him (Wali of Khasab) for judgement, nor did he hear their statements, or the proof from which the right or wrong can be found. As regards the statement- 2 - of the Nakhuda that he delivered the goods to Haji Baqir’s man according to the letter which the plaintiff says that it had been forged. Was the question like that it was necessary for the receipt endorsement to have been made on its (letter) back, as j it has been the rules. But the Nakhuda delivered the goods to Taqi according to the telegrams feceived from Goa and the receipt. These are absolute proofs with Haji Baqir that the goods are his. Also the letter from the owner of the goods Gamilyo is a proof that the goods are for Haji Baqir, and the receipt given by the Nakhuda to the above seller (Gamilyo) is with Haji Baqir. Then what were the proofs on which the Committee gave its decision. I have explained to you the situation contrary to that on which the Committee depended. We informed you that the defendant is a subject of His Majesty's (Sultan's) subjects, how could the case be decided there (Dubai) against him, and why the goods have been attached, and how the case has been transferred to the Residency Agent, and he (Baqir) is not their subject. I request you to release his goods, and the plaintiff to come herewith his proofs as it has been the rules. If he has a right against Baqir or anyelse, he will be given redress for whatever amount he claims. U.E. of the plaintiff The invoice/on which the Committee relied is contrary to its decision and injustice in their report, because such invoice, on which it is to be depended, should be from the owner of the goods signed by him, and not from the plaintiff, so consider it carefully. The defendant's man Mosa bin Jawad said that the Residency Agent, Sharjah wants Haji Baqir to send his agent, in an official way, within 15 days on account of this case, otherwise he will pass an ex-parte judgement. To assun you once more, Haji Baqir is a defendant and not plaintiff. This is on one side, and on the other he is a subject of His Majesty-3- the Sultan, God save him, and not a subject of the (British) Government, so it is not necssary nor incumbent for sending his agent as desired by the Consul’s agent (R.A.), nor do we accept an ex-parte judgement decided in this way. I inform you that such judgement will not be according to justice and right. U.E. Translation of letter dated 25th Dil Qada 1365 (21-10-46) from Majlisul-Tijarah, Dubai to the Ruler of Dubai. A.C. The Commercial Committee has assembled to review the case of 91 cases of tea and 2 cases camphore which are in dispute between Haji Mohammed Abdur-Rahman Zar’ooni and Haji Baqir Abdul-Latif Haiderabadi. The Committee confirms its previous decision dated 2nd August 1946 in the above goods in accordance with’ the aonfession of the boat Nakhuda Salih Ibrahim Shozahi that the goods belong to Mohammed Abdur- Rahman and not to Baqir Abdul-Latif, who has no right in the goods. It is reasonable for the delivery of the goods to its owner Mohammed Abdur-Rahman. As regards the claim of Baqir Abdul-Latif against his agent, whom he claims that he has purchased it for him is still remaining, and he can recover his right from him (Baqir’s agent).

Abdulla Shorfi Abdul-Karim Faroq Mohamed Ali Badri Marshad al-Osaimi Mohd.Abdulla Abbas Veromal Vallabdas€) /O'] Translation of letter dated 16th Dil Hijja 1365 (10-11-46) from the Ruler of Dubai to Saiyid Ahmed bin Ibrahim, Muscat* A.C. Your kind letter of 17th Shauwal 1365 (13-9-46) has been received and I have noted its contents which are right. As from your letter and the proofs of Haji Baqir Abdul-Latif it has transpired to us that the 91 cases tea belong to Haji Baqir, which he has imported into our State Dubai. I wanted to deliver the tea to the agents of Haji Baqir, but the Residency Agent at Sharjah, Jasim bin Mohammed, has prevented me from delivering the above tea to the agents of Haji Baqir. There has been a correspondence between us, copies of which sent with Mosa bin Jawad, for your perusal. I suggest you to communicate with the Political Agent, Muscat for instructions the Residency Agent Qasim bin Mohammed, not to interfere in the case, and wo, Inshallah, deliver the tea to Haji Baqir's agents.

My dear Colonel Galloway, 04 - ^ Reference is made to the British publication Statutory Rules and Orders 1946 No. 2260 - Foreign Juris diction - Trucial States. This publication begins : 'Whereas by Treaty, capitulation, grant, usage, sufferance, and other lawful'means His Majesty the King has jurisdcition within the territories of the Rulers of Dubai, Sharjah, Ras-al-Khaimah, Ajman, Umm al Qawain, Abu Dhabi and Kalba:'. } avv’are of the treaties and agreements under which the British Government has protection over the foreign relations ot the Trucial States, but I am not aware of any treaty or agreement giving the British Government jurisdiction within the territories of the Irucial States which will, permit the application of the laws of British India and of the United Kingdom to the area of the Irucial States. It may be that'such jurisdiction has been acquired by 'usage' or 'suffe rance &gt;, or it is possible that jurisdictional agreements were made at the end of the First World War. I would greatly appreciate receiving any infor mation on this subject both in regard to the Trucial Coast and also concerning the related situations in Qatar and Bahrein Islands. With kind regards, I am, Sincerely yours, Sd. WALDO E. BAILEY. American Consul. cc: American Legation, Jidda. CONFIDENTIA L Copied. G.A.M.CONFIDENTIAL m,am=§.

I should be grateful if you would consider this, and draft and forward to me Orders-in-Council for Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Muscat revised on the same lines, if you agree. The complete set of revised Orders could then be issued here simultan eously. 3. The amendments suggested are for the most part self-explanatory, but the following points call for further examination:- (a) Article 17. The reference to Bombay cannot be allowed to remain in a revised order. Do you consider that this article might be safely omitted, or alternatively will it suffice, so far as the Trucial States are concerned, if provision is made for the trial of offenders at Bahrain? (b) Article 20 . It has been suggested here that provision might be made for convicts from the Trucial States to be imprisoned in Bahrain (if the Bahrain Government agree) as, so far as I am aware, there is no prison which we could recognise in the Trucial States. In this event the Article should be amended to provide for this since Bahrain is not in H.M.Dominions. (c) Article 88 (i). Do you consider that there is any point in retaining this? 4. Question also arises of consulting the Govern ment of India (and Pakistan) in respect of the Indian interests involved - see Section II of annexure to External Affairs Department No.F.15-BPG/47 of 25th April, 1947.

Reference political Resident’s memorandum No. 1680~S dated the 22nd September, 1947. . Enclosed are three copies of the Bahrain and atar orders in Council revised on the lines of the raft revised frucial States Order in Council. 3. A note is also enclosed made by the political Agenu, Bahrain, suggesting for consideration some amendments and additions (other than those made in the draft revised Trueial States Order in Council) in the Bahrain and Qatar Orders In Council. 4. Comments on paragraph 3 of Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations Express Letter, copy of which was enclosed with your memorandum under reply, are as follows ( a ) Article 17 Trueial states and Qatar and Article 16 Bahrain Ibrder in Council . These sections were presumably framed to cover important cases in which trial by a pro fessional, established judiciary outside local politics would be desirable. In modern condi tions such cases are likely to be far more frequent than they were in the past and it is, therefore, urged that the sections be modified in order to provide for trial, in such cases In the United Kingdom. The latter is easier to travel to now than was Bombay when these articles were first framed. (b) Article 20 Trucial States and t'atar. and Article 18 Bahrain . The proviso at the end of these articles should be omitted in all three so as to allow a Trucial States subject to be imprisoned in Bahrain (if necessary), and a Qatar subject to be imprisoned in Bahrain (If ever considered necessary or desirable) and for the sake of logic in the Bahrain order in Council. The Bahrain Government is being asked whether it will agree to imprison Trucial States subjects should the necessity arise. No mention is being made of Qatar subjects. (e) Article 88 (i) . There is no point in retaining this. ATTESTED. 3d./- C.J.

Under Section 4 (top of page 3) of the Trucial States Order—in—Council it would appear that the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, may act as representative of the Political Agent, and in his absence, the Residency Agent. However, I assume that some aeilmtion of powers is necessary, as well as some sort of formal notification of appointment.

You mentioned the Political Resident’s question regarding the status of the Sharjah Court. 2. The whole question is, as I think you know, under consideration with the others involved in the revision of the Orders-in-Council, the revised copies of which ought to appear shortly. But in the mean time I think * we must act on the interpretation you mentioned of Section 4 of the present Trucial States Order-in-Council and assume that the Political Officer, Trucial Coast^ is a.'representative' of the Political Agent. I agree with you, however, that some definition of powers is necessary as well as some sort of formal notification of appointment, but I do not think that an elaborate noti fication of the kind issued under the Indian Codes is necessary; a simple order or orders signed by myself should be sufficient. Before issuing such an order I should, however, like to have an idea as to what limits you and the Residency Agent should exercise criminal and civil powers. This depends to a large extent on the class of cases you are called upon to try and suits you are called upon to hear. After considering these and giving me a general idea of them, can you yourself suggest what P.D. Stobart, Esquire, Political Officer, Trucial Coast SHARJAH.- 2 - what powers the Political 0ffic€;r, True!el Coast, and the Residency Agent should exercise? I would then, I think, issue orders authorising the trial of cases and hearing of suits within those powers. \ Yours sincerely,SoiL- 3 &amp; ' Confidential« D, 0 ,llo. 35 y -1060 British Agency, Sharjah* The 30th March 1949 4 ^ &amp; Will you please refer to your S.CU letter Bo. C/S*30 of 20th March 1949 regarding jurisdiction* any cases 'between foreigners or 'between foreigners and local subjects were decided informally by the Political Officer, Trucial Coast or^Residency Agent. Since then, there has only been one criminal case and that, concerning an affray which Jackson dealt with, and a number of civil suits, mainly for debts and which, in mast cases, were referred to a Panch* As you will see, the legal work here is very light, no doubt largely because there is no semblance of a local police force to investigate and bring a charge, but also because, with the exception of kidnapping, crime is not prevalent in the Trucial Coast y nor is commerce complicated enough to produce involved civil suits* 3* To cover such cases as we have at present^ ard to provide for a possible increase in cases following 'oil development I suggest that the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, might be appointed Magistrate 1st Class and Subordinate Judge 1st Class and the Residency Agent be given^ similar powers, both of the Second Class* Both Political Officer, Trucial Coast and Residency Agent would thus be on a par with the Assistant Political Agent and the Judicial Assistant respectively.

PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, (85/29/49) Dear Pelly I enclose herewith an extract from a letter from Sir Eric Beckett which explains how Assistant Judges of the Court of a Political Agent will be appointed in future and how their powers will be regulated. By Virtue of Article 92 of the new Bahrain-Order-in Council Hafiz can presumably exercise the powers granted to him under the old Order. It appears desirable however that he should be appointed an Assistant Judge under the new Order and if you agree would you kindly make a formal application to me accordingly. In view of the definition of 'Political Agent' in the new Trucial States Order it is perhaps not necessary to appoint Stobartas an Assistant Judge under it but it is for consideration whether he should not be appointed an Assistant Judge under the Bahrain and Qatar Orders. Do you consider that Jasim should be appointed an Assistant Judge under the Trucial States Order ? C.J.Pelly, Esq., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain.— w. — — r-'-r- Copy A EXTRACT from letter dated 24th February from Sir Eric Beckett to Sir RuperHiay. When in futur we want to appoint persons to sit as judges in any of you-'Courts, we shall be able to do it directly under the Ofder in Council, and there will have to be no more references to Any Articles of any Indian codes. Moreover, a person will either be a judge of the court of the Political Agent or he will not. ■‘•here will be no question in future of investing a person with the limited powers of a magistrate of this or that^class. This does not mean, however, that because Mr.X is appointed an Assistant Judge of the court of the Political Agent, he has necessarily got to deal with every case that comes up. The Political Agent himself, as the President of the court, allocates business as between himself and his Assistant, and he can see that his Assistant only takes this those cases which he thinks would be suitable and he takes the others for himself.1 ^/ £&gt; (85/56/49) THE PERSIAN GULP 1 RESIDENCY Bahrain. 8th July, 1949. I discussed with pelly whether the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, when there is one, ought to be empowered as a Judge of the Court of the Political Agent under Article 16 (2) (ii) of the Trucial States Order-in-Council. Pelly held that in view of the inclusion of the words '•or his representative*’ in the definition of Political Agent in Article 4 of the same Order-in-Council this was not nece ssary. I have referred the matter to the Foreign Office and have received a reply that in future a Political Officer, Trucial Coast (and the Residency Agent if necessary) should be especially empowered under Article 16 (2) (ii) of the Order-in-Council and that resort should not be had to the vague words M or his representative'* in the defi- nation of Political Agent. It is proposed to delete these words when the Order-in- Council concerned is next amended.I FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. UNCLASSIFIED 25th October, 1950. Dear Residency, The final draft of the Trucial States’ Order in Council, 1950, has just been received. Since the issue of this Order is a matter of some urgency in view of our plans for the Levies, we are sending you immediately two copies of the draft Order, together with two copies of a memorandum by Judge Haines. 2. We think you may like to have the draft now to study, although it must be borne in mind that we have not yet got the legal advisers’ views on it or on the points raised in the memorandum. We will let you have these as soon as possible.

Article l f 3rd Schedule In the draft law regarding workmen *s compensation and the law regarding registration of patents, designs and trade marks, provision is made for a Commissioner and a registrar of patents, designs and Trade Parks to take evidence. it might be as well therefore to provide that this article shall apply if such acts are done in relation to such officers. This might be achieved by adding to sub-section 2 of this Article 'or to any commiesionex 1 or other oilieial to whom a matter may be referred by any law applied by .King’s Regulation. Schedule 3» article 8 If it 1® decided to and to the Eingfe Regulation regarding the ~evy Force, provision for punishment &lt;f offences committed against that Force, then this Article should be deleted.

An Explanatory Note (as is printed at the end of all Orders in Council) has also been drafted in which reference is made to the Levies, as being one of the new features of the Order, in the folloviing terms:- 'It has been found expedient that there should be created in the Trucial States a small police force under British jurisdiction and therefore this Order in Council enables provisions to be made for the establishment and discipline of this Force by King’s Regulation* 1 . We hope that the order will go be fore the Privy Council about the first week in December, and we should therefore be glad to have your comments as soon as possible so that we may send the final draft for printing.

Article 4. The word sometimes transliterated as 'Qadhi” is here given as 'Quadhi'. The former is, I think, preferable. 2. Article 8 (2). I have given my opinion on another file that members of the Levies should be subject to the Political Agent’s Court. The note under Article 75 of the Note of Amendments is also relevant. 3. Article 12. Judge Haines’s point has been dealt with in the amendments with Mr. Fry’s letter. Article 14. 4. I agree with Judge Haines that modification is necessary and suggest that reference to appeleSt jurisdiction at 3 (iii) and 4 (i) should be omitted. I agree also with para 3 of Judge Haines’s memo. His para 4 is dealt with under ’’Article 14” of the Note of Amendments. 5. One ’1’ in ’Marshal* in article 15 (3). 6. I should have thought that the provisions for bail in the ’’Criminal $ro- Cofta, cedur^’ were adequate. 7. Article 16 and article 48. Nowhere in the order is there any definition of what the ’’preliminary examination' is; nor any mention of the procedure to be followed in conducting it; nor is itMinutes. provided for in the criminal or civil pro cedure codes. I suggest that this needs remedying. 8. The words H or against the convietion M in the note under 'Article 42' in the Notes of Amendments seems superfluous and meaning less. 9. Para 5 of Judge Haines’s note seems to have been taken care of in provisions for appeals in criminal cases in the draft. 10. Article 74 and 76. I think there should be a provision for the trial acMdt of mixed criminal cases by the 'Court for the Trucial States'. There are far too many appeals pro vided for but I suppose it would be fruitless to try to have them reduced. 20-11-50 Second Secretary.|Vb BRITISH RESIDENCY BAHRAIN.

There ar^ large numbers of Per sians on the Trucial coast and the R.A. estimates that in Dubai they number at least 30 per cent of the total popula tion, in Sharjah and Kalba perhaps 20 per cent, in Abu Dhabi 10 per cent and in the remaining sheikhdoms about 5 per cent. The majority of these have been born on the Trucial Coast. Of the remainder, i.e., those Persians who have emigrated from Persia, 82 have been given Trucial Coast passports as a result of p.A. Bahrain's Ro.2397-29/22 dated 11.6. *45^ to P.O.T.C. (Major Hickinbotham 1 s. D.0. letter at page 24 &lt;pf File l(a)/17 also refers). (Many more such pass ports would have been issued but for.the imposition of travel restrictions on Dubai). R.A. informs me, however, that all these Persians are regarded as foreigners and that only those born and bred on the Trucial coast are regarded as Trucial Coast subjects. R.A. considers that only Persians born on the Trucial Coast should^be considered' as Trucial Coast subjects and that all others, N irrespective of how long their stay on the Trucial Coast, should be considered as foreigners. All parties con cerned, including the Persians themselves, seem to concur in this view since from what R.A. tells me it is clear that the 82 Persians referred to in N/para.40 above only claimed the status of Trucial coast subjects in order-to obtain travel documents for India easily. I agree with R.A. and suggest that all Persians other than those born and bred on the Trucial Coast should be treated as foreigners. They would thus automatically come under our jurisdiction and in this way the difficulties mentioned in s.32 would not arise. y-c ^ /h-O X . .. i / 7 f || fV t~N • &gt; . 0 ~*~ 4 *A p»s-C 4 l*A . '.

I have made many of the amendments noted at ’A 1 in the Bahrain and Qatar Orders-in-Council; the remainder should be filled in by the A.P.A. and I.A. - they will probably.find that the work can be completed quicker if they d6 it together. The notes at^B’ y&amp;Mh are a list of possible 72. amendments or additions which it occured to me it might be worth making chiefly in the Bahrain Order-in-Council now that it is proposed to revise it with the others. These noues can be put up with T.A.'s note above when he and A.P.A. have filled in the amendments, etc., at ’A’. T see that this has to be done in no less than 3 copies of each Order-in-Council - perhaps if one each of the Bahrain and Qatar Orders-in-Council (the ones in which I have started the w r ork) were completed, office could complete the two others required.
