I shall be obliged if you will inform me whether you consider this arrangement and the charge proposed to be satisfactory. Cases of a European becoming insane are likely to be very rare owing to the comparatively small number of European residents at Aden, and no doubt if any such case occurs it will be necessary to make such arrangements as seem most suitable when the case arises. 1 have, etc. , (Sgd. ) W.

This question was discussed informally at a meeting at the India Office on the 15th August, 1933, and the tentative conclusion was reached that the best course would be, if the Government of India should see no objection, to continue the existing practice of sending lunatics from Aden to India, possibly for a small payment per head by the new Aden Administration. 3.

Lunatic Asylum ,i It will be necessary to consult the Government of India as to whether they are willing to receive lunatics from Aden.

Dear V/alton, Will you please refer to Laithwaite’s letter to me P.Z. 7877/33 dated. 4th December 1933 enclosing copies of my letter of the 10th August 1933 on points arising in connection with the transfer of Aden, and of the minutes of the meeting at the Foreign Office at which my letter was discussed? As it has been proposed that 1 should go to England this summer to discuss details connected with the transfer with the India Oifice and the Colonial Office, I have prepared a note reviewing the fourteen points that were then discussed, ard adding remarks on further questions that appear to me to require consideration and decision before the transfer takes place. I enclose a copy of this note. I also enclose a copy of a draft estimate for Aden (as distinct from the Aden Protectorate) showing probable revenue and expenditure after its separation from India. I am sending a copy of the note and of the draft estimate to the Colonial Office and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Yours sincerely, (SD.) B.K.Reilly. •C.Walton, Esq., C. B. ,M.

Dear Laithwaite, In conversation in London some weeks ago it was suggested that I should enumerate some of the points that will require consideration if Aden is separated from India. Those that occur to me are:- 12. Lunatic Asylum . There is none at Aden, and lunatics are now sent to India. There are too few of them to justify the establishment of a local asylum, and it would be convenient if the (government of India would permit the existing practice to continue, in return, presumably, for a small agreed payment by the new Aden administration.(The references in the note below are to the points raised in Colonel Reilly^s demi-official letter of 10th August 1933). Colonel Reilly's d.o. letter of 10th August 1933 was discussed at the India Office on 15th August. In addition to Colonel Reilly there were present Mr. Cowell of the Colonial Office, Mr. Walton and Mr. Laithwaite of the India Office. 12. Lunatic Asylum . It was agreed that the best course would be, if the Government of India saw no objection, to permit the existing practice of sending lunatics from Aden to India to continue, possibly for a small agreed payment per head by the new Aden administration.— / *</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000008_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1472</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000008</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1472</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 1/36 'Aden.
