Sir, I have the honour to state that the question whether the Controlling Officer, when countersigning a travelling allowance bill, should pass the latter for the gross amount of the bill or the net amount only after deducting the instalments of recovery of advance and the undisbursed amount, if any, of travelling allowance was referred to the Auditor General. He has decided that the countersignature of a travelling allowance bill by competent authority implies that the bill is approved as a whole, but the ^ue-s position of the relevant space in the bill form for entering the amount by the Controlling Officer - inaic atos that the bill is to be passed for the net amount only. It is not necessary to mention the net as well as the gross amount in the bill. 2.

Exemptions froia the operation of the rule may he granted only in cases where th conditions pBescrihed in clauses (a) and {b) are satis fied and in granting such exemptions, the competent authority may impose such conditions as it thinks fit. one such condition is the reduction in the amount, of the daily allowance that may he drawn and the principle underlying this reduction is that the expense incurred hy a ucvern- ment servant in respect of a haxt at an outstation ordinarl ly decreases in proportion to the length of his stay at that station, ^is principle should he horne in mind hy the authorities to whom powers under this rule have heen delegated and the rate of daiiy allowance should he suit ably reduced after the first ten days in all cases except those which present very speciil features. Oases in which special treatment can 'oe justified will in addition to those of the kind mentioned in clause (h) of Supplementary Bule 73 he generally those in which the halt of a govern ment servant at an outstation is of uncertain duration which makes it impossible for him to arrange for more permanent and cheaper accomodation. 2« I am also to observe that the restrictions imposed in Supplementary Bule 73 on the drawal of daily allowance in excess of ten days apply also to halts in hill stations in the circumstances specified in .'Supple mentary ilule 128. The increased cost of living in hill stations is recognised hy the grant of increased rate of daily allowance and the continuance of the full increasedy\ dally allcwanoe for a period in excels of ten days \ 4 i;.. merely tor the reason that the halt is in a hill statici will not normally he Justified.

With reference to Rute 6, if an officer's residence is at a distance from his headquarters and he is committed to its occupa tion, Heads of Departments may at their discretion sanction the cost of railway travelling (at season ticket rates if possible) between such residence and headquarters, provided that this course will not cost more to Government than the grant of compensatory allowance under Rule 6 and that it will not interfere with the officer's duty. Section III.—Travelling Expenses. 3. In case of doubt the Head of a Department may decide what is an officer's headquarters. 4. With reference to Rule 10 see remarks above under Section II. 5. Heads of Departments are authorised to allow first-class travel to officers not ordinarily eligible for this privilege subject to the conditions laid down in paragraph 5 of Treasury Circular No. 6133, dated 13th April 1933.

In the case of Journesrs between Kuwait and Basrah, the land route hy car is unquestionahly the shortest within the meaning of Supplementary Bule 30(h), and the special sanction of the competent authority under Supplementary Rule 31 to the calculation of mileage allow ance hy this route is not required. In the case of Journeys between Kuwait and Karachi or other ports in the Persian Sulf, however, there are two practicable routes,vi (a) the direct steamer route between such ports and Kuwait# (b) the indirect route, by steamer between such ports and Basrah, end by road between Basrah and Kuwait© Either of these routes may he held to 'be the shortest within the meaning of Supplementary Hule 30 lb) according to circumstances, the delay involved in awaiting steamers which touch at Kuwait being the deciding factor. It may be explained that the Tast Gulf Mail steamers do not touch at Kuwait, and the Down Slow Mails from Basrah touch at Kuwait only once a fortnight. The Up Slow Mails to Basrah touch at Kuwait weekly, but this service is irregular, the peculiar weather conditions in the Gulf frequently causing considerable delays in loading and un loading cargo at ports jan xauts- ^ the circumstances an officer bound for Kuwait, in order to avoid delay, istv-t is often obliged to travel diract to Basrah 'by ^ast ^ and tbenoe 'by road to Kuwaito '^ice versa, an officer proceeding from Kuwait is obliged to travel 'by road to Basrah in order to catch the 5ast Mail to Bushire or Karachi in order to avoid delay in awaiting the next fortnightly down ^low Mail at Kuwait. In practice, the direct steamer route to and from Kuwait is ordinarily held to he the shortest route within the meaning of Supplementary Bule 30(h), and special sanction of the competent authority is obtained for Journeys performed 'by the indirect road and steamer route via Basrah# The Political Besident has accordingly to obtain the sanction of the Government of India whenever he is obliged to use the latter route in the interests of the public service. 4o In the circumstances explained above, and with a view to obviate the necessity for frequent applications for sanction I request that the Government of India will be pleased to Issue executive instructions declaring that the combinea road and steamer route via Basrah between Kuwait and Karachi or other ports in the Persian Gulf shall be held to be the shortest route within the meaning of Supplementary Bule 30 (b) in the case of journeys actually performed by that route to avoid delay and in the interests of the Public service*,Oopy of a Memorandum Ko. 3?#9 (2)-S/35, dated the 5th ^elsruary 1955, from the Additional Deputy Secretary to the G-overnment of India in the foreign and Political Department, to the Hon•hie the iolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire^ Declaration of the indirect route 'by steamer 'between ports in the Persian Gulf and Basrah and 'by road 'between Basrah and Kuwait as the shortest route for the purposes of Supplementary Bule 30(h)o Heference your letter Mo.2728, dated the 15th December 1934o 2* ^n the circumstances explained[the Governor General in Oouncil is pleased to declare that the oomhined road and steamer route via Basrah 'between Kuwait and Karachi or other ports in the Persian Gulf shall 'be held to he the shortest route for the purposes of Supplementary Bule 30(h) in the casj;e of journeys actually performed hy theHroute®OFFICE OF TH3 ACCOUNTANT GENERAL CENTRAL REVENUES NIf DELHI» No. C M dated the 8th J U N S 1937* FROM THE ACCOUNTANT GENERAL?

As, however, you are your own controlling officers in the matter of Travelling Allowance it is 0 0 J* more than necessary that you observe the principle underlying the Travelling Allowance Hules that they are not to be treated as a source of profit. 3. In particular (a) no mileage allowance should be drawn when a car is provided entirely free of charge by an Oil Company, Shaikh, etc. (b) if it is necessary to use two cars for a long desert journey the whole cost of the second car should be borne by the officer concerned unless it is To E.B, Wakefield Esq., I.F. Political Agent,genuinely used for the carriage of office staff, equipment, etc. or unless its hire and the expenses of running his own car together exceed the mileage allowance to which he is entitled. and (c) the provision of Supplementary Rule 185 should be strictly observed. 4. It is probable that you are already observing the above injunctions but if you are not I hope you will do so in future and ensure that your subordinate officers also observe them.

The Government of India would be glad to have your views with rega^rd to the possibility of extension of the reduction in the rate of mileage allowance to officers in the Persian Gulf and other areas covered by S # Ho # 26 of Appendix IS-A to the Fundamental'and Supplementary Rules (Post and Telegraph Compilation). Sd. I.B. Arte. Under Secretary to the Government of India. Copy of an Express Letter No.1163/1/6 dated the 20th September 1941 from Britconsul, Meshed, to Foreign, Simla. Under Serial No. 23 of Appendix 18-A to the Posts and Telegraphs Compilation of the Fundamental and Supplementary Rules, officers of the First grade in ^ast Iran are entitled to road mileage at the rate of annas 12 a mile. As long as cur pay in Rials was fixed at the official rate only this was not excessive, fheia, however, with the relaxation of the Iranian Remil^tions in 1939 our Rial requirements were supplied at the 'black' rate, the amount admissible, though the sane in rupees, was more than doubled, and out of all proportion to the expense involved in an ordinary journey on tour. After due consideration I decided not to raise the question officially f at the time as the rate was fluctuating and in any case Iranian restrictions ruled out practically all touring while journeys on transfer involve much heavier expenditure than journey on tour. 2. The Government of India, under the changed political conditions, now wish Consular Officers to undertake more extensive touring and at the same time the need for economy, where possible, is urgent. It does not seem probable that the old official Rial exchange rate (of approximately 6 Rials to the Rupee) will ever be reintroduced and I therefore suggest that the mileage rate of officers of Grade I should be reduced from 100% incre'ase to the original 33i% which will bring it intc conformity with the rate admissible in Baluchistan and should be adequate to cover normal expenditure. I do not recommend any change in the rates admissible to officers of other grades.

To The Secretary to the GoverjU-x:.t of India, External Affairs Department, New Delhi. Keirjorandum. Subject!- Rate of mileage allowance for first Grade Officers in Iran. Reference memoranda No.F.25(2)-E/41, dated the 14th Novemeber 1941, from the Governrent of India in the External Affairs Departments 2. Since the month of September 1941 when the Consul- General, Meshed, addressed you on the subje'ct of a reduction in the rates of Travelling Allowance admissible in Persia, there has been a considerable increase in the cost of petrol and oil while tyres and spare parts have become unobtainable or else available only at an exorbitant xxt® cost. Further more, owing to the difficulty and delay experienced in pur chasing new cars together with increased cost, especially now that America has entered the War, there has beem a con tinuous and rapid increase in the cost of taxi hire. 3. The above factors would in any case have offset any benefits which may have accrued from the favourable rate of exchange existing in September last. The value of the Toman vis a vis the Rupee has, however, since then risen from the ratiol3 # 50 Tomans = 10 Rupees to the ratio 10.50 Tomans ♦ 10 Rs. and may rise still higher. 4. Officer^ serving on the Arab ssacst side of the Gulf are equally affected by all or most of the items mentioned in paragraph 2. In addition, when they are performing journeys of any considerable length (e.g. between Kuwait and Basrah), it is always necessary for them to employ two cars to avoid the risk of being marooned in the desert. 5. In view of what has been stated above, I do not think it is possible at present to extend the reduction in the rateof mileage allowance ordered for the area of the Khorasan Consulate-G-eneral, to the Persian Gulf and other areas covered by 3.110,26 of Appendix 18-A of the Fundamental and Supplementary Rules.

M.B.E.Copy of paragraphs 1,2 &amp; 3 of Bahrain Residency d.o No. 2183-30/20, dated 17th October, 1947. Dear Hallows, I find that up to date no instructions have yet been issued regarding the drawal of travelling allowances by Grade A officers in the Gulf and that such officers have been continuing to draw their Travelling allowance under the old Indian rules« I have studied Foreign Service Regulation No. 7 on the subject and think there will be little difficulty in enforcing the rules in the Gulf though there are a few minor points which will require clearing up. In some respects they appear to be more liberal and in others less liberal than the Indian rules. 2. A good deal of trouble and difficulty will hov/ever be involved if officers have to refund what they have already drawn on account of travelling allowance under the Indian rules and submit fresh bills in accordance with the Foreign Office rules and it is cbnly reasonable that they should be given the prior notice of the change in procedure. I would suggest there fore that officers might be allowed to draw travelling allowance under the Indian rules until the 1st April which will give them ample time to make themselves acquainted with the Foreign Office procedure and to raise any points about whidh they may be doubtful or which may require special consideration in view of the peculiar circumstances prevailing in the Gulf. I make this suggestion in respect of journeys on tour only. Journeys on transfer or leave if any during the period indicated should be governed by the &amp;02B&amp; Office rules, or by any special terms granted to the officers concerned. 1 doubt if the adoption of the Foreign Office rules for journeys on tour would result in any appreciable saving in expenditure over the period concerned especially as there are at present only four Grade A officers serving in the Gulf and it is not known when more are likely to arrive. 3« Personnel other than Grade A officers serving under this Residency have been promised their previous conditions of service and will therefore continue to draw travelling allowance in accordance with the ^Indian rules. ** spersian gulf res IDE . cy, B ahrain. 20th January, 1948.
