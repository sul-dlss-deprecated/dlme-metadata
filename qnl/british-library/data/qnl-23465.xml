This merchant reports to me that, not knowing of the recent indident in Oatif, whereby the Hindu Agents of local Indian firms were directed to leave that district, and consequently their business interests suffered accordingly, his firm, Messrs L, Nathoomal &amp; Co., shipped from Bombay per a s 'Chakla' v.179., which arrived at this port on the ^rci inst., 540 bar-s of Rangoon Rice, marked RE, which consignment was intended for re -export to Qatif for sale there, as previously. This a^ue of commercial enterprise being now closed, permission is sought for .^e import of this consignment into the State of Bahrein, on payment ox dues. In view of your No.204 of 1926, to which effect has been duly riven, and its period of concession having now expired, it appears to me desirable to invite an expression of opidion 1'rom you on this poi^t, will be rood enough to let me know if this case may be considered as an exceptional one, and the circumstances warrant an exception oo tne RE rule.

At present there are no facilities in this port for transhipment carjo, the only kinds of cargo received here being (l) Import Cargo, and (2) car 0 for RE-EXPORT 'to the mainland of Arabia, the former of which pays five per cent, - and the latter two per cent ad valorem. I am of opinion that the granting of such facilities (similar to those which obtain in India) would be of financial advantage to this State, as the income would be clear profit; and I would therefore ask if a conference -ir.y be prrr. -ed at a very early date with 11.3,. ■' a Political Agent, ..hen i .ay sub it ^ ^ x I have the honour to be.

This new system is being practised since last fortnight only.^o fat we know that herebefore all the cargo was landed in the port and all the dues of the port were paid and then exported to the Persian ports. Further it is very curios that the Nakhuda of the craft gives his declaration for direct transhipment fot Quatter or Ajair and the cargo is actually sold in Bahrein and transhipped to the Persian ports and still the same cargo is treated as direct tranship and no duty is levied thereon. Thar even the R.E. cargo is not allowed for Persian ports and the Importers are liable.to produce their declarations countersigned from the port of destination to^the said goods may have been consigned to,while ' -*• in case of direct transhipment no restriction of any kind what-so-ever is imposed That the expenses on import cargo in Bahrein amounts to 10% and 1% export charge s-thereby making a total of 11% while in KOweit the charges woiyLd hardly amount to 6 to 7 % whereby the »jerchani.s ol Koweit have a clear margin of 5% over those of Bahrein^hence they can create a regular mark^rt at sea i®the port of Bahrein at the cost of the trade of Bahrein,as they they havu to r/ pay no charges in Bahrein what-so-ever on the direct transhipment caigo if ohe present system is continued,which is detrimental to the mercnants of Ba/irein &amp; this trade owing to the higher charges in Bahrein,will be fa£ks(ix shiited into P # T •KISHENDAS HAR1DAS &amp;Co., General Merchants Head Office:— Haridas Janimal &amp; Sons.

I would ask that this matter be treated as very urgent as at the present time the situation is most unsatisfactory both as regards the revenue of the State and the local merchants. In order to settle this question once and for all I would respectfully request that sanction be granted to charge Sfl ad valorem on all cargo which is handled, not necessarily landed, in this port with the natural exception of any cargo marked 'R.Z' , when, as stated in the report, only 2^ is charged. There is little doubt, I think, that this port is being used as suggested by the Director of Customs as a jumping-off place for smuggling which is obviously most undes irable from every point of view, and as the Ports to which the manifests are said to be made out, are not, I understand, in the position to issue landing certificates, it is impossible to check whether cargo is landed at the stated ports or not. I suggest that cargoes such as petrol tins etc. landed by the A.P.O.Coy., shall be treated as R.E. and charged SjS. 1 beg to remain 4 z&lt; Sir, Your Obedient Servant, Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. t P etc 1? u 0 r 3C %C L)Y 71 uS CUSTa BOUSE, BAHREIN, 26011 July, 9th Safar, 1^47. -.B.^Vs Pollfxal A._;^nt, Bahrein, through: The Adviser, The Governnent of Bahrein. Sir, Sub.ject: Transhipment Gar^o . As is well-Iaiown to you there are two classes of cargo operating in this ^ort, namely: (l) Import Garjo, on which duty at Five _)er cent as valorem is paid, and (2) Re-export Car^o, on which duty at Two per cent is paid. Such re-export cargo is for re-shipment to certain Arabian ports only. Khalifa, there was a certain amount of direct transhipment at sea of cargo brought in native craft 1 rem Arabian .ainland ports into steamers, such as dates etc., and 'oossibly from ■-'. jive craxt into otner native crai't, within the neighbourhood of this 'port. SUOh ; 0ra :' t 80 - i ® tiae »» but d0 not,carry .itxuifesta of tJieir cargoes'. Such c .- goes ..ore allov;ec. pass duty free because there was no raeans of effloieitlv collecting . the-duty, ~ ^ In his Memorandum on Re-export Oar;;o, I,!r Bower, the Re-orjanisiiig Officer, reuiar':ed ''.Tlien car^o is transhipped direct from steamer to on-carrying 'craft, no transhipHant duty whatever is collected', ilo reference is made to tran&amp;hipiamtt at sea between native craft, and this rWark would relate to imports, not to exports. N An effect of this proviso i G that there is a steady transhipment of the A .P .C.Ooy 1 e Cil products through this port, to the mainland, on v/hich no Gustams dues are paid; this appears to be legitimate, and has considerably assisted the trade, but not the Ctate Revenue. Unl'ortunately, 1 am not in possession »f a~S^tor launch which would enable me effectively to inspect craft in port, and prevent irregularities which I suspect; but an effort has been made, with only partial success, to control the workings of the native craft here. It is however a fact that a cortain a ount 01 transhipment of cargo at sea between native craft has occurrec.^ which I have not the means to prevent. A further development of this situation has occurred in the last few- eeks. A number of Kuweyty merer ants, where local business is depressed, have brought to this port in native craft cargoes of sugar, with a manifest for an Arabian mainland port, such as Qutar, sold the goods in port to Persians, and transhipped them at sea into craft which are known to be smuggling su^ar into 1 - 1 • ^h® -ocuments iodgeo. with me shew an Arabian mainland port as the poi t j _ ...es v ..^na oion. It should be noted that the cargo is not landed here no**are any Gusto .3 due-- paid, thereon. I am of opinion that such a practice is illegal, according to the general tenour of our Customs rules; but I cannot find a definite pronouncement on the point. I consider that such cargo using this port should pay the usual duty offive per cent, unless the ^oods are specifically .arked 'R.E.', when they should pay two per cent, and produce the usual landing certificate fron the Cuctons at the port of destination. It may be re tarred that this oort's sugar trade in v/orth at least Rsr^OjOOO/- per annu i to the State; and it is \ may ai.iount to ten per cent, yet at Kuweyt the haoAng cost ic not likely to exceed six per cent. Conse uently, if this transhipment at sea in the .ort of Bahrein is tolerated , the sugar inpcrt trade will .most.probably be diverted to Kuweyf, to the serious loss in revenue to ti e Stat© of Bahrein, xhia position is being felt acutely by the l ocal merchants interested in tue su^ar business, v/JToTiave made repre entations to me on the subject. - 1 ' sure you y&lt;i 1 J. agree that it would be an uiidesirable matter for this port to be used as a Jumping-off -round for Kuweyty-Persian souj lers. I am therefore asking for a proclamation to the effect that:~ 'All cargo entering or leaving the port of Bahrein by any kind of craft 'must prepay the appropriate Customs dues before such cargo can be released; 'and failure to do so will render such cargo, the craft,'and the persons 'concerned liable to the appropriate tenalties. This regulation to apply to 'al classes of cargo, whether transhipped at sea, or otherwise'. - would add that, as arranged, I have laid the situation before K.Z.The Deputy Governor, who desires to take the advice of The Honourable '/he fieaident on the sub-Ject. light I therefore venture to ask for a very eai 1j ecisicn on one point, as the otate has already lost a considerable ^ m; _cx. - mjichanus are very anxiously considering their commitments.

Respected sir, We the undersigned,Hindoo merchants,carrying on trade in this port # most resjectfully beg to bring to your honor's kind atten tion that the existing rules for the period of R.S. cargo of 20 days are detrimental to our caxise,specially after the chages and the orders issued. That here-before the bulk of the regular trade of the R.E. cargo -specially grain,coffeesugar-v/as about 70/b in our hands and hardly 30% with the remianing merchants of Bahrein^ but about nine months back since our men,who had been carrying on trade at Quatif have been expelled there-from, the tables have been turned and duiing the last nine months we have been hardly able to import 30 % :. .. cargo. That here-before we used to carry on free transactions and lend the Quatter traders;but about six months back a proclamation was issued by your honoy, in accordance with the wishes ox the Rulei of Quater, stating that no one should give loans to the Quater traders except those who are solvent and good parties anci no cases to be heard against themjhence our trade of Quater also stopped. In consicieration of the above changes,we, most resp ctfuliy submit,that the period of R.E« cargo be kindly extended oo 30 daysin order to enable us to carry on our usual regular trade othenvise we can-not afford to carry on business and our cause will suffer for uhe following reasons:- (1) That here-before we had our representatives in Quatif &amp; used to ship our stuffs to them.But now British subject are not allowed to carry on their trade at Quatif.If we sell in Bahrein bo the merchants of Quatif on periodical payments we are at their mercy i for payment.We can not sue them in Bahrein but have to go to Quatif and file our litigations there,where our claims are not recovered and under one or the other pretext our claims are being delayed i not at all thrown away-the facts which have been brought to your honor's attention.2nd continued:- (2) That here-before we used to carry on business with the Quater traders and used to advance and lend them against short periodical payments.But after the above prolamation we have been obliged to sus pend our new connections with almost all the Quater merchants.As your honor is aware, that if we file suits against any subject of Quater the Ruler always notifies the said man to be nearly bajikrupt;hence it would be rather impossible for us to find out the solvent party to dael with. (3) That nearly half^out of the whole duty realized by the Custom in Bahrein,is paid by the Hindoo merchants (excluding only one steamer in the beginning of every season in every year inwhich arabs import ri -0 e)which clearly indicates that the major portion of the regular trad of grain,coffee &amp; sugar was in our hands and unless the period of R.E. is extended we can not afford to import stuffs as we did here- before for the following reasons:- ^ j (1) That our connections with Quatif have been totally stopped. (2) That we can not deal with the Quater traders freely. (3) That although apperently the period for R.iii. cargo is 20 days from the date of the arrival of the steamer # but in fact at least 5 day are taken in clearing the cargo and specially there is no direct steam -er from Calcutta,all the consignments of Caldutta rice(which is the ^ prime article of trade)arrive via Bombay which will take at least ten days to clear,as the shipping agents do not issue delivery orders unless the whole cargo of the steamer is removed to the Import yard, which takes three to four days i hence the actual clear period left to merchants would hardly come to 10 to 12 days. (4) That during the limited period left to 'ohe merchants they are obliged to expediAte the disposal of their cargo at even low rates as the local merchants realize that we can not ship to Quatif or any othe place as we have now no agents in these ports,hence there is no go buo tp dispose of in Bahrein. (5) That in winter on occasions there is continued Shumal wind in which no boat can enter or leave the harbour . (6) That ont only we will suffer in our trade but at the same time the revenue of the Bahrein G-ovemment will also suffer as the import x. . 3rd continued;- 'v three will decrease.So far we can presume that during the last/months the arrivals have been less than during the corresponding period of the pr -evious yearhence no doubt there would have been decrease in the reve nue of the Customs. (7) That the local consumption of this port is limited and this port chiefly depends on outside purchasers who,would like to purchase from the cheapest market either in Bahrein or in Dubai or elsewhere. But if R.2]. cargo is alv/ays available then owing to the existence of the sea -motor-launches in Bahrein only ^there is possiblity of outside purchasers at this port at favourable rates in comparision to those at other gulf ports• (8) That Quatter and depedancies and Jubail and Ajair are the cni -ef outside ports which are the exporters of cargo.Quatter ia between Dubai and Bahrein and Jubail bet?/een Koweit and Bahrein# ((9) That if the period of R.E. is extended the merchants will be able to import more cargo when there are favourable rates in India. This will bring more income for the Bahrein Customs owing to more arri vals than at present.In this connection we would bring to yuor honor's attention that since the introduction of the R.E. (2%) system the reve -nue of the customs has already increased and similiarly it would incr -ease . With a sanguine hope that the above will receiEe lour Honor's favourable condideration and early orders oe issued to enable us to trade freely. We beg to remain, Respected sir, Y ^ r .

I have to report that Mr Permanand Vassanmal brought to this port for re-export one hundred bags of sugar; and on 3rd September he duly lodged two Shipping Bills covering the re-export of these bags, to Qatar, where there is no Indian Agent of the local Indian merchants. Before the sugar was re-exported, the sugar was sold in Bahrein to. Hajy Yusuf bin Ahmed PaJcroo; and it was shipped into two Persian joliboats in charge of G-hulam Husseyn and Abbas Hajih, respectively, I enclose a copy of a translated letter from the Director of Customs in Qatar, dated 8th October, in which he states that the sugar did not reach any of the ports under his control in Qatar; and, inferentially,he was unable to endorse the usual Landing Certificate on the triplicate copy of the Shipping Bill, and return it. I have, however, subsequently received here the two triplicates in question, with a Landing Certificate endorsed, stamped, but not signed, the handwriting being different from Mr Husseyn Nima's . Hence I am compelled to believe that something fraudulent has occurred, and I suspect that the goods were never intended for Qatar; and five per cent duty ought to have been paid on them.

I2tli November, 1928., 29th Jamad al Awal, 1347., 9 Sir, R.E. Gar ;-vo, I have tne honour to refer to a petition submitted by a group of Hindu merchants of Manamah praying for an extension of the RE period, and also to your N0.C .2I9 of 1928, with its enclosures, and tastate that accoriixig to the intent of the original ordinance RE cargo was assumed to be imported here by an agent of a certain specific individual residing on the mainland. I was not previously aware of this, and would report that I understand that the practice of the Hindu merchants for some time past has been to order from India such quantity of RE cargo as they assume their agents in ^atif could sell. Hence, in view of the explicit terms of the original order, it must be assumed that by some mental tergiversation the Manamah Hindus regarded themselves as the agents of their*agents on the mainland. At present they have no agents in Qatif, and consequently their position is difficult. However: I am now informed that in I92I, soon after H.E. The Governor's ruling was confirmed by H.B.ATs Political Agent*s letter No. 2u6,, a deputation of Hindu merchants submitted to tne Political Agent that the application of this rule would limit the RE trade with the mainland to Arab merchants, so that the Hindu merchants would lose an opportunity of sharing in such profit as could be got, unless they were allowed to order RE cargo for disposal on the mainland by their Hindu agents as and when a suitable market arose and further, that if they have no Agent there, they should be able to order RE cargo and sell it in Bahrein to a merchant having an Agent on the mainland, who would dispose of it at his convenience. This of course goes right away from the purport of the original oraer; but I am informed that tne Political Agent agreed to this interpretation of the position, and consequently such has been the practice for several years; and I do not think the State's revenues ha/e suffered thereby. I would therefore venture to enquire if it is correct that such an arrangement was made, and if there is any record of it; and, in any case, if it is approved nowadays? v , The point is important, since, if such is the case, and a Hindu merchant orders unsold RE cargo, and does not *&lt;8ell it in Bahrein within twenty days, he would very reasonably wish the period to be extended to thirty days, or better still, for an indefinite time, during which he might ta^e advantage of the market fluctuations both on the mainland and in Bahrein. This accounts for the remoter purpose of the petition: namely that merchants may have the right of declaring whether their cargo (which would all be brought here marked RE) should be exported or not. We have recently seen that when flour In Bahrein was scarce and dear, certain Hindu mercnants obtained permissioa to import into Bahrein some RE flour, and were thus enabled to make a greater profit at less expense than was likely if the RE flour were re-exported. If this purpose were achieved I fear that the cost of food in the bazar here would become dearer, an unfortunate thing for the majority of the population, who are poor people.

If this were being d.ne I d. not through their a e ent * ^ w ould have arisen. i5ut the custom seems to £if It;.If. Th. ^-rinoimals in Bahrain took to importing ji .- b .. cargo for sale by the agents on the mainland, and latterly it appears ^at U-e merchants in Bahrain have been importing R.E. cargo of finding a market orders far it from the mainland, taking a chance of .f* t ms ' rlfel f«r it When owing to political and other reasons, they find an^easy markft. they begin to complain and ask for an extension of the R.E. period. Merchants who import their cargo on a genuine R.E. basis, that is in response to a definite demand, have ample time to negotiate it. Undoubtedly it would suit the petitioners better if the fi.S. period was an indefinite one. rhey could stock and ceuld buy and sell according to the fliictuations of the market in Bombay and Bahrain, and the rise and fall of the demand « the mainland. This would be entirely contrary to the very principle of RoE # cargo. Dealing with the petition in detail i would make the following remarks. 1 The fact that trade with Katif has shifted very considerably from the hands of the Hindus to the hands of the Arabs isroughly correct. This Government is not responsible for the difficulties met with by the Hindu merchants trading with ^atif and Kattar. at the same time the Bahrain Government, which is an Arau uoveri.ment, cannofreg^t that trade should pass from the hands of foreigners 2 r ' t * The question of^udicial rights over subjects 01 tne xuaer oj uittar is not a matter for this government to take part in. it is assumed that the Kuler of Kattar had good reason for discouraging credit one might also assume that he wishes to encourage the I am unaware that British subjects are • not allowed to carry on their trade at Katif. I understood that they could ao so uut at their own risk, xhe question of delay in law suits hardly affects the question of R.E. period in -dahram. 5. out of 34 leading merchants in isahrain, according to Customs figures, 15 are Hindus, signatories to the ^ , • t . a. j qt nf* the total customs collection ox merchants contributed 2v..79^ •xoluded as the nindu 1346. The steamer mentioned should not be excluaed asHindu merchante are al»le to impart rice on it, and they do so* 4. Jfrompt clearance of cargo is a matter of importance and every effort is made l»y the Customs authorities to hasten the clearing of cargo. Various helpful concessions have loeen made recently such as not counting jrridays in the h . js . period, and, just lately, the decision to to calculate the period from the date of the completed removal of the cargo into the pier shed. We are also considering creating a separate cash department for n.-a. cargo to speed up the progress of R.E. cargo. In practice cargo has been delivered on afeout the fifth day. ro state that the clear period remaining is 10 or 12 days only is incorrect, -oiven if it were the case such period would allow for a possible strong shamal wind which might ale delay native craft but which would not probably affect launches in which rice is generally snipped to the mainland. 5. xhe petitioners assume a decrease in trade should the trade be no longer in their hands, ihe argument is weak. As long as demand exists tra4e will continue. i .here is a permanent neea for rice in Bahrain. R.E. receipts amount to 8.25^ only of the total collections of customs duty, rhe percentage is not entirely rice. It does not follow that if the petiti^iers discontinued their R.E. trade that it would cease. It is reasonable to suppose that a great part, if not all the trade, would be carried on by Arab traders. 6. xt is true that if n.JJi. period were extended or entirely abolished, as would suit tne petitioners best, the petitioners would be able to import rice at more favourable terms and sell it on the mainland at greater profit, but I do not consider that it wouio be wise for the government to assist them to do this by altering the Customs rules, customs regulations were imposed with very great difficulty in Bahrain and if once the government begins relaxing them the road is open to endless applications from other sources. i might compare this question to the Diving Laws which were imposed after the uiving reforms. Because some concessions have been made in recent years and and the laws have not been as forcibly enforced as before it is common Jcnowleage that many of the laws are being ignored at present. 7. ihe petitioners appear to request h.B.M's Political Agent to assist them in obtaining concessions from the Bahrain State which will further tHeir own interest, on the grounds that they are British subjects. ihey fear the competition of the Arabs, especially since for political and other reasons they have lost ground on the mainland. They speak of withdrawing irom the trade, unless they get what they want, and they point out, m fact almost they threaten, that this will cause financial losses to the otate. xhe only advantage which accrues to the State from tnese nindu merchants, apart from their actual payments to the customs, is that sometimes their inter_competition may keep down prices, xt might be suggested that there are too many Hindu merchants in .uanram ana tnat they are cutting eachothers throats. ihese Hindu merchants neither spend or invest any money in the country. Of the many foreign nationalities in Bahrain they are the only ones who never buy property or take any permanent interest in the place. All their gains are sent back to mdia. ihey come to Bahrain to make money, if they did not make it they would not come, and when they have made enough they leave Bahrain taking their money with them. The trovernment of Bahrain is xx&amp;t an Arab Government and at all times endeavours to further the interests of the Arabs before that of foreigners. As such it is not fitting that it should conduct(.§.) ' conduct its affairs in order to suit the wishes of some Hindu merchants who are aliens both by race and religion, ihe Arao merchants are satisfied with the present arrangements and do not complain. i have the honour to be Sir Your obedient servant.

H. u, M' s Political Agent, Baiirain, through The Adviser, The Government of Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to draw your attention to the existing conditions under which KE-Cargo passes through the Customs into certain mainland ports in Arabia, It will be remembered that the original sanction for Hi-Caro @ ad valorem was granted by H, jfi. Sheikh Sir Isa bin Ali al Khalifa upon condition tiiat the Rai Cargo comprised goods definitely ordered for a consumer upon the mainland through an Agent in iiahrain. This restriction has not uec;n entirely observed; and ,in fact, would restrict the trade to such merchants as have Offices upon the mainland,and consequently would also restrict competition. The present practice is, that Bahrain merchants order goods marked EJ6 intending them to be sold upon the main land to any purchaser offering- and actually the sales transactions take^ place in Bahrain, The local Hindu merchants do not possess branch Offices on the mainland,and consequently if they wish to deal in ilbi-goods in Bahrain (as many of them regularly do) they must sell for cash or credit, and the latter transaction is always a risky one. I feel sure that if there were more elasticity in the conditions of RE-cargo transaction,there would be more competfdn and probably more cargo brought into Bahrain, It should also be remembered that an appreciable quantity of cargo actually imported into the State of Bahrain is re-exported to the mainland quite apart from the lib-cargo; and such cargo lias paid five percent, I would therefore submit,for your consideration that:- The term iifci-cargo should be abolished,and all cargo brought within the port of Balirain should pay five percent primarily. If however the Importej decides to re-export any of such cargo to the same mainland ports as are now used for Rit-cargo, and does ship same within twenty days(the present period) of the import,he should be entitled to a refund of three-fifthsof the duty paid by him,thus making the net duty of two percent as heretofore. I think that by allowing the importer this option there would be more elasticity of trade,uy which the local merchants will benefit and the teclmical position will be regularised. This suggestion might perhaps be put into force for,for,say,one year after uhicli it coulcl be decided whether or not any improvement has ueen effected.

' ^ I have the honour to refer to some previous cor- respondence on the above subject between your self and the Director of Customs and the Acting Adviser of which the last letter was vour No. T/ll of 11th August. 1928, from Shiraz. Since then the question seems to have been deferred. Recently it has been re-considered by me and the Director of Customs. Before the re-organisation of 1923, tranship ment of cargo at sea within the Port took place unrestrictedly because there was no efficient means of controlling it from the shore. Owing to the recent improvements in the amenities of the Portit is considered that the Transhipment at sea has increased; and such transhipment is nearly always pf cargo intended for, and caning from, the same mainland ports at present served by the regular RE cargo. I propose that the transhipment of cargo at sea within the Port should be under the control of the Port, and that some dues should be naid on it in return for the use of the Port. It is therefore suggested that the cargo for Arabian Ports should be treated in the same way as ordinary RE cargo and Export cargo, but on cargo for other ports the full should be denosited, this being refundable upon production of the usual proof of landing within sixty days. I have the honour to be Sir, Your Obedient Servant, . Adviser to the Government.No. /7/4. Political Agency, Bahrain, Dated the 11th January 1931. From Captain C. 0. Prior, I.A # , Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Hon T ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to forward for your information a copy of a letter I have received from the Adviser to the G-overnment of Bahrain. Prima facie there seems no doubt that within the three mile limit that Bahrain Government are entitled to levy such dues as they may wish, subject only to treaty limitations, and I feel quite certain that the Persian Government does not allow transhipment for foreign countries to take place within its waters without the levy of duty. Before considering the matter further, I would be glad to be informed what the practice of the Persian Government in the matter is, and what rules, if any, they have to govern such transactions. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, Bahrain.Ho. D.O. f* 2?' Political i V ^ncy, liahrain. Dated tho llth January, 1931. The question of transhipment of cargo at sea within the three mile limit at Bahrain has arisen, and the Bahrain G-ovem -ment wish to treat it on exactly the same lines as ordinary R»£ cargo for the Arab ports and to charge a duty of 2^ as is charged for Ho-Sxport goods to Arab Forts. Formerly, owinj to lack of control over the harbour there is no doubt that such transhipment took place without paying any duty, but it seems quite clear that the Bahrain Government would be within their ri^its if they imposed any duty within territorial waters that their treaty restrictions permitted# 2. ihat is your practice in India? Could I, for instance, anchor 2i miles from Karachi and tranship goods out at sea for, let us say, Persia, and pay no Indian duty at all? Of course, as you know, we do not have the bond system here, or we should lose a great deal of revenue and the only thing in the nature of a drawback is the concession that goods intended for certain Arab ports and declared as sujich on lending pay only Zjo duty instead of the general tariff of 5/3♦ I would be much obliged if you could find time to let me know briefly how the matter would be treated in India, and no doubt the French and Portuguese ports would produce a situation similar to ours here. What do you charge, (a) if a transhipment occurs from steamer to steamer in the stream, and (b) what do you char t ;e if the goods are landed and then reloaded into another vessel.

Your D.0.58 dated 11th instant. No duty is levied in India on cargo manifested for transhipment to foreign portr&gt;(vide Chapter Xll.Sea Customs Act) and consequently no tenefit accrues in transhipping carpo at sea. 2. Tmpoi't duty is leviable on foods imported for consumption in India and it is 'but equitable that duty should be levied only on those goods which are consumed in the country of import — in other words taxes are levied upon consumption and not merely on importation. For this reason,and to enable the goods to be disposed of in foreign markets as if they had nevei been taxed at all,we have the drawback system(vide Chapter vl.Sea Customs Act) in India— the 1/6th duty retained by the Indian Customs is intended to cover the cost of entering and clearing the goods through the Cu st om K ou se. 3. in the case of transhipments, the fee leviable under section 133 .Sea Customs Act, is intended, to cover the cost of Customs supervision.This fee varies with the nature of the articles transhipped subject to a minimum of Be.l/- in respect of any one transhipment transact ion.The fee is the same whether the transhipment is made from one vessel to another in the stream or whether the roods are first landedand then transhipped. The above re&amp;arKS relate to Custoins duty. Ihe case of levy of port dues,landing &amp; shipping dues and the liKe is of course different and these would be levied (in Karachi by the Fort Trust) for actual services rendered in the port in connection with transhipment and/or re-shipment. cn—rs —^ To.

Sir, I have the honoiir to refer to your letter No:955/3 dated the 18th Rajab 1349 and to enclose copies of letters I addressed to and replies I received from the Hon T ble the Political Resident and the Collector of Customs at Karachi. Of these .,'r Bower's is the most interesting and you will see that in case of transhipments the only charge made is one ©aly intended to cover the cost of customs supervision^^ but,oi course,in the event of cargo being' landed there are also ^Port dues,landing and shipping dues levieci by the Port Trust but these are probably fairly li^ht. I suggest that Mr.de Grenier writes to Mr.Bower at Karachi and enquires from him what the Port Trust dues and Customs 1 supervision charges amount to,for let us say,1000bags of rice and 100 bags of sugar so that he may be able to form an estimate of what would be a reasonably charge to make in Bahrain. It will be seen that I suggest that a charge should only be made for customs supervision and not for customs dues 7 for it would appear inequitable to levy the latter on goods that do not even reach the Fe^fe.

I have to refer you to the Rules promulgated'trp6Ti the 1st Ramadan 1349 (19th January 1931), in regard to the nev; class of 'Transit Cargo'., and particularly to Rule ^To. 1 . , which states T Transit Cargo landed at Bahrain is cargo 'brought 'by steamer on a 'through Bill of Lading for a destination other than Bahrain, or landed port of 'any of the RE ports on the mainland of Ara'bia, 'but to 'be 'at Bahrein for the ship's convenience in transit to such 'destination'. In this connection the local Agents of m he 'trlcy an^ Ellerman Line have produced to me 'Bill of Lading T o.8., covering a shipment per s.s.'Arahistan' of ninety-two packages of merchandise 'to 'be delivered at the Port of Bahrein.... 'unto The Government of The Hi ^ar an^ 1 &gt;T e/^ and its 'Dependencies Ras Tanura....' The packages are variously marked, some YVT others for Hasa, Qatif, and Ju^ail. PA9 TATTURS VIA ^AHREir. At the time of discharge the cargo v/as treated as RE cargo, and duty at two per cent a.v., was collected, ^he Agents submit that this cargo should he treated as 'Transit Cargo', and the duty ought to be refunded. - In my view Ras Tanura is not a recognised port o^ call for steamers in the Persian Gulf, and {2) the Bill of Lading is made out for Bahrein.

The Customs Department, Bahrein, is thus suffering financially and we, on our part are suffering heavily on account of this recent practice on the part of some people, which we trust will kindly be stopped to trie good of all, as our shipments have nearly totally fallen on this account.

Sir, We write to inform you that we propose chartering a steamer with about 1500 tons of cargo for Bahrain. But in view of the present diversion of cargoes to the mainland - Ports of Arabia, by steamers as well as by native cr'. p t3, and also onaccount of 3/* Duty and Import ^ard ix.ian^al concessions to be granted upon re-exports of cargoes to the mainland Ports, and that amount of such concessions being not less than 6% we can under no circumstances be in position to sell our goods to the mainland Ports if once imported into Bahrain on payment of 55 and three annas Khanchia per bag cargo not exceeding three Bahrain mauuds. Under the circomstances, we can not also enter into free competition with tha mainland traders in Bahrain and neither are in position to charter a steamer at the present moment unless the Bahrain Government gives us an undertaking that similar concessions of Duty and Khanchia ( as have been granted to the mainland cargo) will be granted by them, particularly upon cargoes of ra ^i -i~ - of rice and sugar to be imported by us into Bahrain spe- daily by our chartered boats whose Agency will also be handled by us as usual. In this connection we wouia further add for your Honour's information that we do not asx for any such concessions as above to be granted to us upon oar b oaa other than those stated above, although considerable quantities of coffee, tea, L.augar, and Goods havs also been imported by us into Bahrain every year.

Respected 3ir # v * ^ ^ With reference to the incident of S.S.Ahamedi which is receiving the attention of the Government,we the undersigned merchants # beg to lay the following facts to your honor's attention,with a request ,that they may be taken into consideration before any ^inal decision is arrived at:— (1) Port of Bahrein has special pecularities so far trade is concerned or in other words in can be called a tra§it port for Mainland and Quatter* (2) The trade of this port is in the hands 0% foreign -ors, so to say only a negligable percetage is in the hands of * 1 /\ Bahrein government subjects.The chief factors are (1) British subjects (Hindoos and Uohmadans) (2) Persians &amp; (3) NeJ &lt;S ^8. (3) With the introduction of BE i # e 2fo system,the trade of this port continued to improve as it gave facility to the merchants of this port to enter into competition with other gulf ports viz: Dubai. &amp; Koweit (which are Sessible ^ and mainland ports)where government charges^ are less than those at this port.But this new system of Re 2^ duty brought this port to their level. (4) The period of Re cargo was fixed at 20 days which was mis-interpreted to be counted from the day of the arrival of steamer which hardly left 14 to 15 clear days to the merchants. (5) The Hindoo Mer^chants,whose representatives were expelled from Quatif and were already debarred from Quatter ; put in their application on 1^&gt; # 10 # 1928 to the then Political Agent Bahrein, stating there-in their grievances with reasons and asked extension of period of Khanchi and Re to 30 days according to the then existing system.Lt Colonel C.C.J.Barret,the then Polity -ical Agent, after thorough investigation into the matter^ was sattisfied and decided that 20 clear and working da ys should be fixed for R.£« cargo and that system was introduced(as will be clear from your honor's offiwe records) (6) With expellment of our representatives from Quatif and hinderances in our free dealings with Quatter merchants, we were put into many difficulties so far our trade was2 concerned and it became apperent to the Bahrein government that R # E # trade was being monopolized to Kejdis only, hence the Bahrein Government was pleased to modify the working system of R.E »cargo (present systenOwhich resulted in equal treatment to all alike. (7)With increase of Khanchi on bag cargo, specially rice and sugar ; from 0-0-6 &amp; 0-41-0 per bag respectively to 0-0-0 &amp; 0-4-3 per bag respectively (say 6&amp;4 Cimes incres*)the period of cargo naturally expired with the period of first khanoh^as no reftfl -^und of second khanchi was to be given(for which there are proofs if any denial is forthcoming) .This cur&gt;tailment of R.B.period and increase of Khanchi we the chief causes for direct transhipment to Ne.id ports, (8) The Director of Customs issued a notification on 1,1.32 (copy attached) for the levy of khancki whereby ten claggr days were stopped —decision arrived at in the days of Lt. Colonel Barret as referred to above-.As a protest to this notification a f4 petition (copy attached) signed by almost all the leading merchan -ts was forwarded to the Director of Customs who has not till day given any reply to this petition* (9) With increase and change in the levy of khanchi the actual period ofxWwMklt R.E» cargo was reduced from 20 days to clear 4 or 5 days as will be clear from the copy of the petiti -on dated 18 # 1 # 32 • (10) This limited period of four or five days^made it impossible for the merchants to be able to always supply R«£« cargo for Mainland. This gave opportunity and temptation to Kejd merchan t^ for direct (11) No refund of ft on landing charges of R.B, cargo 1 was given to the merchants and at the same time ? on import and export of R#E« cargo^ municipal charges which are also collected by Customs at 0-0-9 P®r bag^are being collected-while in no part of the world,municipality has any right to collect dues on a cargo which does not enter their limits. (12) No restrictionVas put on the cargo which was dir -ectly transhipped from this port, while strict restrictions were put on the cargo which landed on this port to such an extent, that in case of Rangeoni rice^more than ^2 bengal maund8 ,, are to be3 //O put in a bag in order to comjily with standing orders for weighment.. (IJ) In no other gulf port such heavy restriction of weight of rice are in force # As sale of rice is on a bag system hence purchase^rs will not take into considreation weight of a bag but will consider only the price in comparision to other gulf ports (14ft)Considering the above facts and excluding the difference of duty and weight, still there will be a difference of 0-3-6 per bag in addition to the margin of profit of underweight cargo^as there being no control on them•During these hard times of trade depression,even a margin of profit of one to two annas per bag would induce the merchants to a good over-turn of business. (15) Taking advantage of these changes &gt; the direct transhipment or direct shipment has been on the increase^ which has resulted in loss of revenue to Bahrein Government and diversion of trade from all merchants to one section ; who, so to say are enjoying the monopoly at the cost of all merchants* (16) Your honor is aware that British subject^s are not allowed to go to Mainland ports or Quatter for trade and open their permanent branches there,thus thereby Hindoos in particulars are eb denied the freedom of trade which the subject of above ports are enjoying under British protection. ll7)Hindoo8 were carrying on their business in Quatif since a long time,but since five or six years^they have been drivel out from Quatif under false pretext (which could be known from your honor's records).The outcome of the above ha^been now apperent«The Government of Nejd was helping its own subjects to divert the tradeB of the port into the hands of its subject^*The chief commodity of trade^of Quatif is Bahgooni rice -of which 9^ trade then was in nte our hands but with above change r that trade has been on derease and now we can hardly claim of the said commodity in our hands.Even the Customs records will bear testimony to the above* (18) The authorities of Uainland are helping their subjects by giving them all facilities so that they can divert the whole trade to them* Ho extra khanchi is to be levied on any such cargo which may remain in Customs custody for any amount of preiod* This facility given to them would amount to As 2/ per bag -a differ -rence which would give them a chance to be able to store any amount of stuff whereby they they cah have chances to enjoy theflucu^tuation of the market rate, (19) The new chafes of khanchi and reduction of period ol R.E.oargo have been 'brought without calling for any public opinior while here-before leading merchants were consulted.There was no increase ot Khanchi on package cargo which could easily bear. While application dated 18.1.32 to the Director of Customs was neither replied nor acknowledged hence it was considered prudent not to put constant applications to avoid misunderstanding recently created in some circles that only Hindoos have been carr^y ing on agitation against the incresae of any dues. (20) The recent years have shown that, owing to Hindoos being debarred from enjoying the freedom of trade on the ports on which depends the trade of this port^the trade from our hands has decreased from ^ 70fo to 25 to 30 fo only.The diverting of t#rde from the Hindoos means a direct loss to the revenue of Bahrain Government. (21)This year owing to special concession in freight in preference to Dubai and Koweit , owing to the activities of Hind . * j —oos for having arranged special rate for this port from Calcutta / the trade of this port with Quatter has improved but if the pre sex -t state of affairs continues, it would be difficult for us to arr ange for big shipments,hence it may not be out of place to infer that the port of Quatter may be diverted to (fcxa^wr.In the days ot Your honor's predecessor Lt Colonel Barret,the port of Quatter had nearly stopped importing from this port.On reference by H.B.M 1 s Political Agent to the Ruler of Qutter,Sheikh Abdulla bin Jassim admitted ; that major portion of trade was with Dubai as there was a cheap market there (official correspondence will corrobrate ) but the^increase in period of &amp;.£. revived trade with Quatter. (22) In consideration of the above facts we respectfull —y submit that the following facilities may kindly be taken into considrfation;- (1) Refund of all khanchis on R,E.cargo (2) Reverting to the period of ftfrhqpi R.E. cargo of 20 clear worliin^ -days, counting from the day of first delvery of cargo by Gustms.

With reference to your office notification Nt.G22/376 of 1/1/32 re changes in the existing system for Khanohia and not to prerent misunderstanding as alleged on the imported cai?go. we the undersigned merchants loeg to lay the following facts to your notice with a request that they may be favourably and justifiably condiiered;- !• The period of ten days Khanchi to commence from theday of the removal of cargo by the Imperd Yard# is unjustifiao^e to the cause of merchants as they are not expected to get delivery or der from the steamship companies of the cargo until it is removed totally as part of the cargo requires either measurement or marks or counting or such other similar reasons* , - That the cargo will not be deliverd to the merchants before the Bill-of-Entry is cleared fully. To put in a concrete example if any steamer arrived on Saturday in port the cargo which required weighment (which forms a major portion of the bulk cargo) will not ready for delivery to some 6$ the merchants beiore /ednesda^ evening while cargo which requires measurement by the shipping agents will not be ready for delivery before Thursday evening or Saturday raormrjg Why and how this delay is caused is best known to you. Considering the above period which is beyond merchants power the only right period of Khanchi for him will be only 3 to 4 days. That this port has a very limit need of cargo for local consumption and is most dependent on outsiders where tlu -.argo is shipped by crafts. These shipments are effected in coniideration of the winds which are not always favourable hence on occasions, it will be rather impossible to make the shipments during such a limited small period. The existing charges of Khanchi would make it impossible for any merchant to leave the cargo in the Import Yard. But to remove to his godown will deprive him of his benefit for Re-export refund. That the present world wide depression has obliged thexaaxxa merchants to order the stuff through! the countries of origin in ojc M m order to avoid middleman's profit and enter into competition with other glf ports, the bills and documents are always thrtugh* India win which cannot arrive here with the goods but will always be atleas . a week late than the stuffs hence all such cargo will always be liable to extra khanchi which amountsm to in ordinary cases more than magin of profit of the merchants. J ^ . That this port chiefly depends on ^atar &amp; mainland to whom are accessable the ports of Dubai &amp; Koweit hence unless there is a cheap market in Bahrein, the trade will be hampered heavily. That the new order reverts us to the precious pe-iod uian- ohi through the intervention of Colonel C.C.J.Barret. the t.iem Politic cal Agent, who after a discussion with the merchants and the authori44 ties concerned, had modified the old system after having satisfied that the merchants were quite justified in demands (a reference jrill satisfy).

I think it is abundantly clear tuat thetyncrease in khanchiya and other charges that have taken place in recent years are responsible for the attempts to divert trade to direct relations with the ainland and with frelents at the present starvation prices it is an easy ruatier for shippers to supply themselves craft that will suit their purpose. 3* The ijahrain Government have agreed to ^rant direct tran shipment in the harbour and have in principle accepted the point that they will be content with a nett duty on til articles that are reshipped from iehrain. i surest now that the otate should go a step further,that it should put back the khanchiya to its old rate of ^0 days and that it should ^ive facilities for merchants who re-export rice and su^-ar to obtain a refund of all dues paid by tnem,except a sum e t uitalent to 2,0 of the car^o f s value. Let us suppose that a mercnant imports 5000 bags of rice. I suggest that if he subsequently re-exports 1000 ba^s of this that he should receive^ a refund of the 3^ duty,a refund of the Balsdiya fees and presuming that he was able to import it into Bahrain witain the 20 days khani,: i h/m khanchi/a,he will be able to reship his cargo on almost the same terras as men who obtain direct transhipment in the harbour. I make this suggestion lor the following reasons: A number of merchants both Bahrainis,Hindus and Persians hare no agents on the Mainland and it is a matter of chance for them whether they are able to dispose of their cargo within the 20 daj limit or not and in stormy weather itvis frequently difficult to do so. If it is made easy for merchants to export their rice and sugar they will undoubtedly bring in larger quantities,store it in their own goaowns and export it or consume it in Bahrain as occasion This would effectually discourage direct shipment to the Mainland ports for j knowing that large stocks exist in Bahrain at cheap make rates f shippers would not renture to skip direct L after its arriral. There is no doubt,howerer,that some loss will accrue in the shape of khanchiya and refund of Bsladiya dues but we hare had an example recently of the loss of trade that the risit of merely one steamer to Mainland ports can occasion us and the State will lose very much less by making it impossible for such shipments to be resumed. 4. I hare also receired an application from the main body of the Hindu merchants,which may be taken up simultaneously^ and a gist of their request is summed up in paragraph 22 of their application. I think all thase points are clear and I would be glad if they could be considered simultaneously. I feet that so long as the State obtains its 2^ dues its interests cannot suffer and its position will be strengthened and not weakened by any concessions which it grants. I need hardly say that I only recommend that this RE concession should only be giren for the two staple articles of trade to the Mainland,yiz: rice aod sugar.

After Complinents. I beg to inform Your excellency that on 2.4th. damadl al Awal 1361 (24th. uctober 1932 ) a proclamation was Issued by the Government of jaahrain under «o. 28 in connection with transhipment of cargo and it was mentioned in article 2 in the said proclamation that nobody is allowed to tranship cargo from one boat to another or from the steamer to another boat, within the port limits of Bahrain without getting a permission from the eourtr. To-day two boats arrived from nasra with cargo and transhipped the loads to three boats belonging to ^atif within the port limits of Bahrain near the shore. This is prohibited and they had no permission to do so. Consequently the Port Officer was asked to arrest them. The owners of the cargo are foreigners and they are living in Bahrain. Since this sort of practice is harmful to our country I beg your i^xcellencySs assistance to put a stop to this and to punish those persons who have done this. Usual ending. H.un the 10th ueceraber 1932 the non'ble the Political Kesident saw a deputation of nindu merchants in the office and they explained the various disabilities under which their trade suffered,on the general lines mentioned in the enclosure to their letter of the 7th December 1932. !| ' 2. Their troubles appear to fall under two heads, firstly, certain restrictions which handicap them at Bahrain and, secondly,the restrictions imposed by the saudi Arab government. 3. The Kesident promised that the Political Agent would look into the question and,if it was possible to do anything to help them,it would be done. 4. jyjr.Kakoomal valabdas^f said that he had met ibn Tawwil, the customs director of wejd ,and that ibn Tawwil had offered to make representations to Bin Saud with the idea of {-pre- sumably) allowing them to go back permanently to ujai^i They asked if there was any objection to their trying to obtain an amelioration of their position by this means and the Kesident said that it was a matter which needed consideration. They explained that ibn Tawwil was going to Kiyadh in the month of ishaban and would probably be in aahrain shortly,so that it was necessary that anything that was going to be done should be done then, hie was asked to put the matter in writing so that what they wanted should be quite clear, -ar^feaid that he would see ibn Tawwil and hoped to be in a position to make more specific suggestions. 5. bome conversation ensued about the difficulty of trying artificially to stem the flow of trade but there was a general feeling that trade would go through Bahrain,provided the ourdens imposed on it in return for facilities was not too high. 6. After the deputation left the Folitical Kesident and the. political Agent agreed that it would be well to discuss the matter with the Bahrain government,taking as a general text the fact that a flow of trade cannot be forced through inconvenient channels by :Political means for any lengthof time and that the best plan seemed to be to try and make Bahrain so convenient that trade should naturally come there and,if possible,to enlist the cooperation of the merchants of JMejd. it seemed probable that any trade war could only end in the diversion of trade to the mainland ports. 14U 10-12-1932. Lieut colonel. Political Agent,Bahrain. S' ° ' ■' ! '« 'SHW^' / s ^v 24th November, 19 ^//&amp;3. 25th h&amp; j at) 13 i/^ ' ^ *&gt; ^ The Adviser, v^ ^ ^ The Government of Bahrain: » ^ ^ Sir, In reference to H.B.M's Political Agent's Noil^73 of the E3rd November, which enclosed (a) copy petition from Messrs Dhamamnal Isardas &amp; Co., and (3) summary of a petition from the Hindu merchants, 1 would venture to remark:- (2) HE cargo is such as is brought to Bahrain in transit to the • mainland, on pre-payment of two per cent duty, khanchia at the old rates. Pier fees, but no Baladiah charges; and it must be marked 'RE', and despatched within EO days. Optional cargo is such as is brought here for import into Bahrain, or re-export to the same mainland ports within twenty days and it pays full import duty, full khanchia, baladiah fees, and pier fees. After proof of due arrival at the ports in question, a refund is granted upon application of the difference in duty between the original rate and two per cent, the difference between the imported rate of khanchia and the old, rate, but not the baladiah fees, or the pier fees. ThiE^YrTgenerally known as 'Refund Cargo', and has worked well---Eo well that local merchants are now seeking additional facilities, namely that re-exported car.;o should pay to Bahrain State a clear two per cent ad valorem net, without any of the Import Yard charges for khanchia, pier fees, or balad&gt;liah. 3. If the Government of Bahrain accepts the principle of treating all re-exported cargo as if it were transhipped at sea within the port; then only two per cent ad valorem duty should be collected, but nothing for khanchia (i.e.storing the cargo for twenty days), or baladiah, or pier fees. There are certain technical objections to such cargo paying baladiah or pier fees with which 1 am definitely in sympathy, as Id do not think that such charges ought in principle to be levied upon this class of cargo. 4. 1 do certainly think that any commodity stored in Customs premises should pay the hamali charge, as it is an out-of-pocket expense. If the Government decides to grant a refund of Khanchia paid on optional cargo for the first twenty days, which is the limit of the option, then such cargo ought to remain in Customs charge; and the merchant will have the option of re-exporting any quantity of cargo, however small. It is important to define the'period of twenty days' which at present consists of two khanchiaS, the first being ten working days beginning on the day when Import Yard begins to take into charge and sort out the cargo lying on the pier, but not including days when the Import Yard is shut, such as Fridays; and the second period is ten consecutive days. Originally the period was twenty consecutive days beginning on the day when cargo was first landed on the Pier. The request in the extract for 'Twenty clear and working days counting from the Tday of first delivery of cargo' could easily extend the period in fact to twnnty-four or twenty-six days, and I subkiit that the best way to deal with this position is to make the RE and also the optinnal period twenty-five consecutive days beginning on the day when the Import Yard begins to take cargo into charge. 5. If the principle of 'Two-per-cent-net 1 is accepted, it might be well to permit a merchant desiring to bring here rice and Java sugar (but not crystal sugar, or loaf sugar) for re-export, to remove same direct from the Pier to his own godowns, paying the dues, but obtaining a refund on-re-exportation in quantities of not less than one thousand bags of rice or five hundred bags of Java sugar, amounting to the difference between the original payment and two per cent. Thus, the optional re-exported will recover (a) three per cent duty, (b) baladiah, and (c) pier fees; and the question of hamali will not arise.The Adviser (continued) £4th November. 1932.. 6 a The principal commodities re-exported to the mainland ^rts are- Rangoon rice, Java sugar, tea. and piece-goods, the two lest heing in much smaller quantities than the former two. I would therefore suggest that the Government acceptsthe principle of ^Two per cent net 1 as applying only to Rangoon ^ce and Java sugar nrt ionallv re-exported to the RE mainland ports within twent^-xive days of the date of the Customs' taking- into -charge. in quantities of' not less than one thousand tags of Rangoon rice, or five hundred ■bf nf Tava su^ar all other re-exported cargo to proceed upon the'existing system except for the change in the period to twenty- five days. 7. The effect of this will undoubtedly be that certain merchants will ask for further facilities to be granted, to extend the principle to every quantity and class of cargo re-exported, however small; but I suggest that the time for such a concession is not now. since with the present concession the Government will have to face a certain loss in revenue not anticipated in the current budget, and 1 submit that it may be prudent to see if the effect of the present concession during the current year will be to maintain the position of the Port of Bahrain as an entrepot for transit trade with the mainland. 8. In regard to the other points raised by the Hindu merchant s: (4) Refund of munSpal dues on re-exported cargo (optional), and (6) Refund of three per cent duty on Landing Charges these ought to be granted in the ordinary routine of work. (5) Prompt issue of Delivery Orders by the Agents this, 1 understand is being done. (7) Quick clearance of Bills of Entry through the Customs this is being done now, but to clear on the day of the arrival of the steamer would involve the working of the 'Deposit System' , which I am reluctant to bring into force here for several very good reasons, one of them being the need for additional staff. In my opinion the RE period is normally adequate for any merchant regularly trading with the mainland to ship away his sold goods, (8) The present scale of weight of a bag of rice imported into Bahrain is 168 lbs gross, which means that the contents weigh 164 lbs. To reduce the gross weight to 164 lbs would enable the importer (but not the consumer) to make a profit of the cost of the four pounds of rice saved. This question of weight was freely discussed in the Manama Baladiah some years ago, when Hindu members were present and agreed. Any suggestion of an alteration ought to receive your very critical examination, and I understand that the reason for the suggestion is that the profit gained by this saving would meet t^e charge for khanchia now in force, thus enabling Bahrain importers to compete with others who might import into mainland ports via Dubai where there are no restrictions in weight.

Dear Sir, Te are inatructed by the Managing Agents of the above Company to approach the Bahrein Government through your good offices on the subject of a ruling passed by the Sovemment In connection with 1% Duty being levied on bonafide overcarried cargo transhipped **' t in Bahrein harbour# The circumstances under which the question was raised, were as followsi- On a certain occasion the K.U.S.^Bamora* after dis charging moat of her Dubai cargo met with exceptionally heavy weaohar at that port and the cargo boats were unable to make the ®teamer to offload a balance of approximately 500 packages* As the nortli wind* in this section of the Gulf oftan laat several days, the Commander of the 'Bamora** decided to leave Dubai and make connection with the R»M.S.•Baroda* at Bahrein and tranship this cargo to her as ahe was due to call at Dubai on her inward voyage. Had the •BanLOra' stayed at Dubai to discharga this cargo It would have meant a further delay of several days to the steamer. Such d e lays would be of little cenaeiiuenoe if the eteamers were rot under a *all Oontract. They '2 - /7 s ) have, therefore, to consider the mall re&lt;iulrement8 of all other ports In the ^ulf and endeavour to make the various ports as near to schedule time as possible. Moreover, had the 'Bemora* not made connection and transhipped the cargo to the 'Baroda' at Bahrein, this cargo would not hara again reached Dubai under three weeks, thus causing conBidershle Inconvenience and loss not only to the Company 'but to the merchant a concerned. On our aubmlttlng the •'Baroda* b ' Export ^anifest^ to Customs, the Director called for the production of Invoices and payment of transhipment dues. We contested this damand because we were of the opinion it was unreasonable in tha.t, we tiould have landed the goods as mlfilanded cargo and only paid dues levied on such cargo wlnen reshipped. These dues are cons^rahly lesa ^an the amount of duty InvolTed. Moreover, It would have been next to impossible to have obtained Invoice for part shipments of cargo destined for another port. further, we contended that the regula tions in regard to the payment of duty on transhipment cargo referred to goods transhipped to and from the mainland. We are grateful that the Bahrein Government considered our representation d did not press the matter further. The Government, however, wrote to us on the 17th of .April last vide their letter No.i280-S of 1551 - a copy Is attached for your ready reference - that it haJl been decided from the above date onwards to levy the pre -payment of 2^ transit duty on such tranship- ; menU. ^e placed' the matter before our Managing Agents, who desire us to protest against this ruling and they write as follows:-\1*0 - 3 - •While it is not the Company^s intention to appear critical of the Bahrein GoTermaent 1 s ruling, it is neverth#- lesB felt that their decision will involTe the Company and merchants in serious inconvenience and very heavy additional expenditure, which is most undesirable in the interest of trade and we consider an exception should be made in the case of 'bonafide overcarried cargo. The strict enforcement of the Bahrein Grovemment's ruling will oblige the Company to arrange for transhipment of say overcarried Dubai cargo to be effected at Basrah, which will involve a delay of three weeks as against a delay of 2 days incurred in transhipping at Bahrein, if such cargo consisted of specie .you will see that a levy of 2% would involve the Company in very heavy payments. Considering the manner in which we have endeavoured to assist the Bahrein Government over the qtuestion of cargo for mainland ports, we think their action in this matter is very unfriendly.^ We would add that such tranehlpmente are very exceptional. The instance moted abore is the flr.t - to the knowledge of the writer - which has taken place in the past two years and the Company would on no account arrange for such transhipments except in cir cumstances of force uflipure due to weather conditions, facilities . for similar transhipments are granted free of charge by other Custo. Houses in the Gulf e.g. Bunderabhaa, where Company's ateamers often make connections. - 1!We shall therefore he grateful if you will represent this matter to the Bahrein GoYernment on hehalf of the Company with a view to their withdrawing their ruling on this point* Yours faithfully, ffaMEfiOFOlAMIAWA \S1A Corpn.

E v iclos. Adviser to the Government. —Copy of D.O letter from Mr. C.C.deGrenier, addressed to Mr. G. D. Beigrave, Adviser, dated 31st March 1934 (14th Dil Haj 1352) In reference to the attached correspondence, as I under stand the position, the question is rather one of principle than of practice, for it is clear that if this large quan tity of cargo had not been transhipped within port limits, there '.vould have been no case for the collection of trans shipment duty; but it is also clear that the transhipment here occurred for the convenience of the ship T s working, it being less expensive to the Company to tranship here rather than to delay the ship in Dubai port longer than could be helped. As a matter of practice in Bahrain it is a fact that often sundry items of cargo, such as a few bags ? or - unit items of similar tvpe, are mislanded here m the ordinary routine of working a ship T s cargo; and, if a local importer is unwilling to accept such items to adjust his own shortages, such are re-shipped to their nort of destination, and no customs duty is levied. This I have always understood to be an act of grace on the part of the Customs, who are not thereby estopped from their ri^ht to collect duty on such cargo. ^nd I ccpntend that in a case of a large item or quantity being mislanded here, duty is leviable; and I have known duty to have been collected e .g., upon a case of a motor-car. In my opinion an instance of transhipment of cargo within the port does not fall under this category, and should not be considered as such. This is the principle involved; and I submit that your letter No. 1280-3 is justified in principle, and 1 would further submit that an act of grace should not be coi^brued by the steamers T Agents as granting to them the right to re-exnort free of duty mislanded cargo, still less the transhipment free of over-carried cargo. The suggestion of an unfriendly action cannot, 1 suggest, be accepted, for all Bahrain is sincerely appreciative of the regular service of the B.I.S.N.Company's working in this port, it is only desirable to establish the principle. . If. however, you consider it suitable to withdraw your ruling, and to -oermit free transhipment inv port from one B.^.steamer to another, 1 shall, of course, carry out such instructions as you may give.No TA/G/C.

In this connection may I refer to the correspondence recently between H.E. Ibn Jelouee, and H.E.Shaikh Hamad bin Easa A1 Khalifa, which relates to the two quantities of (a) 12,500 bags of rice for the household use of H.M.King Ibn Saud, and (b) 27,500 bags of rice to be imported by His Majesty for State purposes These are expected to come forward through the agency of one M.

Of the quantity (a) two thousand bags have already been properly transhipped; and I am informed by this agent that by to-morrow's steamer a further five hundred bags are expected, the relative Bill of Lading having already been produced for inspection. Permission is sought for transhipment by oversides delivery of this quantity. In view of the circumstances, from the Customs 1 point of view there is no great objection to sanction being granted; but before doing so, I would prefer to be favoured with your views, as there is a possibility that a sanction in a special case may be misconstrued to form a precedent for future consignments,^ please. s t DIRECTOR^ OF CUSTOMS, and , PORT OFFICER.

I told him that I could not give him any reply at present. He informed me that the reason for this enquiry was that on' occasions there are small -cargoes booked for Kuwait the quantity of which would not warrant a steamer calling there. In the past such cargo was carried on to Basra and send down to Kuwait from there but this is no longer possible owing to certain new restrictions in T Iraq which specially affect cargo for Kuwait. The B.I. are now looking for an alternative nethod of delivering such cargo at Kuwait. I should be obliged if you would give me your opinion on the matter. Yours sincerely. Lieut. Colonel G. Loch.

It was agreed, however, that it was undesirable that caigo should be transhipped free as this might lead to demands for similar treatment from elsewhere, but that it seemed fair in the circumstances that caxgo brought in British ships to Bahrain might be transhipped into ships of the British India Steam Navigation Company for Kuwait with a transhipment due of It per cent, the rate recently agreed Upon in the case of goods transhipped to Sa 9 udi Arabia.

I received a petition from the merchants of Qatar in which they stated that the Bahrain Government do not allow the transhipment of goods to Qatar which arrive 'by steamers 'by transhipment system, whereas they do so in respect of the other ports. That this has caused a decrease in the volume of their business and that some of their transactions have been stopped which resulted in a deficit and loss to them and requested me to approach you on the subject. I, therefore, request you to look into the matter and see on what ground the Bahrain Government disallow the transhipment of the goods indicated above to Qatar whereas they do allow the same to the other ports. May I know the reason why Qatar has exclusively been given such a prohibition. You are aware that most of Qatar transaction is connected with Bahrain and that if the merchants of Qatar are prevented from taking delivery of the goods which arrive by transhipment system, they cannot buy other goods as the price of transhipped goods is less than that of other goods. In this way, the business transaction of the town will be delayed and the interests will be adversely affected. Sinc€ the Bahrain Government allow the same in respect of the other ports why should they not give Qatar a similar treatment and allow the transhipment of goods as they do in respect of the other towns. I request you to afford assistance to me in this matter and to intervene with a view to causing the removal of the prohibition which has been imposed on Qatar and to facilitate the business r^3' transaction so that Qatar may fall on the same lines as others, for which act I shall feel very grateful to you, I have a firm hope that, through your kind intervention, the matter will be settled in a most satisfactory manner.

Recently a trader in Bom'ba^, India, exported to D^ai fifty cases of Vermecelli which went forward 'by a steamer which did not call at D'hai, and the goods were over-carried to Busreh, Iraq, where they were landed, and re-shipped to Bahrain by the s.s.'Barpeta 1 v # 261, and landed here. The exporter claimed from the Basra Customs the usual drawhaclc on Transit Cargo. In support of his claim it is usual to submit a Landing Certificate from the Port of Destination, which in this case was done; 'but it then appeared that the claim could not 'be admitted unless the import was for local consumption, it being quite possible that under the Bahrain rules, the goods could be re-exported to D'bai the original t'ort of Destination. Therefore, it order to obtain the Iraq drawback the goods have had to be imported into Bahrain for consumption here, whereas they were originally intended for consumption in D^ai. I thought that perhaps it would be weil to bring this point to your notice, as it will be seen from the enclosed letter,(which please return after perusal), that the Iraq Customs authorities decline to recognise a Cargo Landing Certificate which might be issued by the local Authorities in D'bai, but a certificate issued at Bahrain is acceptable.

(73 s !v His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain. MEMORANDUM :- I enclose a memorandum addressed to you by the Director of Customs and Port Officer, Bahrain, regarding liability for customs duties on imports into Bahrain by Casoc from Saudi-Arabia which are intended to be re-exported out of Bahrain. It appears to me that such imports should be dealt with in the same way as R.E. cargo, in which case they would be liable to l£^ or Zfo duty. Doubt less if the Company is asked to pay it will complain so before making a demand for duty I should like to obtain your views on the subject. Adviser to the Government. End S.Z.No Vkfa/ P. (, THE CUSTOMHOUSE: BAHRAIN: 25th November, 1941., 6th Dhul Qaada, 1360., To:- H.B.M's Political Agent, BAHRAIN, through The Adviser, The G-ove nrnent of Bahrain: memorandum: - I enclose herewith for your inspection and return Shipping Bill covering the export of two cases of Radio Telephone hence by s^/'Adria' via Bombay and Singapore to Belawan Deli. So far as I understand the position, exporters are of opinion that th44 export should pass through Bahrain free of duty. In this connection it will no doubt be remembered that imports into certain Arabian ports, transhipped at sea within the port, pay Bahrain Customs Duty at lj^ a.v., and R.E. cargo meant for mainland ports pays 2% a.v. Arabia imports a considerable quantity of goods through Bahrain; but practically its only exports through Bahrain are dates on which a duty of 2% a.v. is collected. In my Judgment this shipment is an export from Arabia through Bahrain, upon which I propose to collect two per cent, ad valorem. I should be glad to be favoured with any^comment, please.
