J 1 ] a r ve - 1 the honour to forward herewith for the information of the Govern- mGXit ot India the Administration Report of this Residency for the year 1925. 2 A/ CHAPTER I. I. South Persia. —•During 1925 the provinces of Sonth Persia, with one Exception, have been calm and comparatively uninfluenced by the fetormy events of the north. Keza Khan's position as virtual sovereign (in the absence of Ahmad Shah) was reflected throughout the year by the general state of security. Unfortunately his regime was based on the hypothesis of a strong army. During the year this has increased in power, and commensurately its oppression of the population has been marked and frequent. Owing to his preoccupation in the north, Reza Khan's policy of breaking up feudargovernment and centralising all power in Tehran, has been pursued with little rigour in the south. True, spasmodic attempts were made to disarm tribesmen in various districts, but these efforts were never pushed home with military force and consequently only those chiefs who acquiesced in disarmament were deprived of their weapons. It is, however, remarkable what success has crowned these efforts among the migratory tribes around Shiraz, where nearly 10,(J00 rifles are claimed to have been surrendered. The only case where the new tribal policy was actively pursued in the south was in regard to the Arab Shaikh of Mohammerah, Sardar Aqdas. As a result of the military operations conducted by Reza Khan in person at the end of 1924, the position of this chieftain was left ill-defined. In the month of April 1925. however, the Shaikh was treacherously arrested by order of the Central Authorities on the charge of intriguing with his tribes and taken to Tehran. This arrest, contrary to what might have been expected, produced no resentment at the time, and indeed might well have passed utterly without attention but for another chain of circumstances. The rains of 1925 in the Khuzistan area were seriously deficient and as a result the crops were almost a total failure. In July some 30,000 Aiabs fiom the Karun and Hawaizeh areas, unable to find food, migrated soxtthwards towards the' Shatt al Arab, half of them crossing over to Iraq and the remainder encamp ing outside Mohammerah. The presence of this starving and discontented mob, all of whom were adherents of Sardar Aqdas, undoubtedly precipitated matters and the attack on Mohammerah ensude. At first the situation assumed a serious aspect, and H. M. S. ' Triad ' proceeded down the river from Basrah while bmisn troops were held in readiness to guard British interests. Fortunately, they were never required (and never entered Persian territory), owing to the assistance given oy the Wlo-Persian Oil Companv to the Persian Government m the form ot cars to hurry troops from Ahwaz to Mohammerah, and order was speedily restored. The taiie-ible effects of this disturbance are the complete aniiihilation ot Shaikh Khazal's power and influence in this region. The Shaikh is so old and his sons are of such a character that it is very unlikely that this family will regain its former pre-eminence. The interest and excitement aroused by events in Mohammerah for exceeded those aroused bv Reza Khan's action in November when he deposed the Qajar dynasty and caused himself to be elected Shah-m-Shah lor some years past Reza Khan has been strengthening his position as dictator m the land, a thi^ Drocess has been accelerated by the absence m Europe oi Ahmad Shah. In the autumn of 1925, alarmed by the news of Ahmad Shah's intended return, lie laid the r^ans for a coup d'etat which would be far more ambitious and far-reaching than that of Zia-ud-Din, which brought him to the tore and laid the foundation of his fortunes. It was evident that his strongest weapon was the military one which he had himself forced. This he brandished to persuade the country to dethrone fne Oato dvnastv and appoint him head of a provisional government to conduci the affairs of state untH a decision could be reached regarding the future form V nmon'f Ad fnr as the South was concerned his show of force was liko evidenced when the military imposed their wishes (sent to ^ ^ Tehran) on the apathetic minds of the popnlatiom It was a mat^ ence to the southern Persians whether Ahmad or _ when the old Majlis Government was a republic or a mo ^ a r^ T ] ^ n to convene a new Constituent Lc586FDsovereignty, was any trouble anticipated, judging by the actions of the Military Commander there. Thns Reza found himself safely placed on the ancient throne of Persia. From the external view point there have been two events of importance in the Persian Gulf. 1925 saw a complete year's running of the Hansa line of steamers from Germany to the Gulf. Working as they do on a freight agreement with British shipping interests, their two-monthly sailings have had little effect on cargo. It is idle to pretend that there has been no effect on British interests as, the loss of cargo—both from the Continent outwards and of Persian produce to Egypt and elsewhere—is obvious. Moreover, there is the increased facility with which Persian importers can get into touch with Continental exporters. Fortunately however, our main lines of business are unassailable at present. Furthermore, in the little post-wRr experience that Persians have had of German trade, the former have already had a few lessons in commercial morality which cause them to be a little nervous of doing business with Germany. The other external event of commercial and political importance has been the project of the Imperial Airways Limited to use the Persian Gulf route for its service from Egypt to Karachi. Sir Sefton Brancker, of the Air Ministry, did an aerial survey.of the Gulf in February 1925 and pronounced it practicable. In September, representatives of Imperial Airways, Limited, and^ of the Air Ministry made another survey, with apparently satisfactory conclusions. What effect this service will have on the Gulf, is difficult to foresee. At first it will perhaps be inappreciable, but it is interesting to observe that man's latest means of locomotion, the motor car and the aeroplane, are tending to restore to the Persian Gulf that importance it enjoyed in mediaeval days as the channel of communication from the treasure houses of the East to the entrepots of Venice and Genoa. Oil —In their main area at Masjid-i-Sulaiman, the Anglo-Persian Oil Companv are reported to have had a prosperous year^ In regard to their sub- sidiarv areas an event of note has been the final evacuation, about the end ot May, of Qishm Island, where boring operations have been m progress since 1914. In the Bikarz district, west of Bushire and south of Ahwaz work has slackened off at Mishun, but new wells have been commenced at Gach Qaraguli on the Zulu a River and at Pazinun. 11 East and Central Arabia.— Muscat.— r Fhe year 1925 has shown some improvement in the financial position of the State, thanks to the reforms intro duced earlv in the year and the supervision exercised from Api ii onwards b&gt; Mr B S Thomas O.B.E., Financial Adviser, who has replaced the Mmister, Wvid Muhammad bin Ahmad, in charge of the Finance Department—the latter now sittos a?Member of Council without portfolio. The State in common wUh all the chiefships on the Arab littoral has suffered from a bad pearling season and from a serious fall in the price of dates. ^Tpo-nfiations are proceeding for the acquisition of a small steamer in India, 11 of pnrvvi^o nn armed force from one Muscat port of the Oman Coast to another. This, it is believed, will greatly enhance the Sultan's authority and increase the Customs receipts. of th^ veM^^o^the^e^o^^e^^a^h^resM^d^at DhrfaT^a^Etnnt^and,^ur^|s is harc ^ v be r n&lt; ! ered t at - szt&amp;svste * i-i--—r a,* if™ 5i s State affairs has revived appreciably^ He is on tne Mr. Thomas, whom he styles ' v\ azir . n . t7- t r&gt;f Qnlmv flip Amirs of Jaalan at Sur, the \al Saad The Bam Kaab tribe of , ^.^orfers of the Ibadhi Imam, viz., of Suwaiq and the two most pwerfd rappo ^ Hamyar 0 f Jabal Shaikh Isa bin Saleh of Kabil and ^ha v d indifference to the Akhdar, have aH-as is becoming m hnv e Sultan's authority. The Ban K f® an t ? (G OV ernors appointed by the Iroen WaWiabis in creed, withheld assistance, whiclt l b bev a ctld e^il^ave rendered when a Hindu was kidnapped by Bedoum. ■MMTlie Ibadhi Shaikhs conducted a little civil war against the people of Yanktd, l)hank and Ibri in south-Western Oman, which if successful might easily have precipitated an attempt at interference by the Governor of Hasa, who is the nearest representative of the Sultan of Najd. The mischievous Tripolitan Arab, who styles himself Alam Sulaiman 44 Pasha ' bin Abdallah al Baruni and who reached Muscat in August 1924 and talked of moving on to 'Iraq after a short stay, instead of doing so, has been extensively touring in the interior of Oman and visiting most of the Shaikhs who repudiate the Sultan's authority, especially Imam Muhammad bin Abdallah and Isa bin Saleh al Harithi. He has made some literary contributions to Egvptian papers which show that he is not friendly-disposed to Great Britain or'any other Christian-Powers, although he pretends to be only cm^-Italian. Trncial Oman—In April it was found necessary to teach a salutary lesson to the Shaikh of Fujairah, a disaffected feudatory of the Shaikh of Shargah, for misconduct in regard to slavery. His fort was bombarded by two men-of-war and a tine of Bs. 1,500 was recovered from him. In October a serious outrage against His Majesty's Government was com mitted at Shargah. In broad daylight a shot was fired from a house on the sea-front at the Residency Agent, which killed the Khan Bahadur's cousin who was standing bv his side. Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar made no effort to produce the criminal, with the result that suspicion was -generally directed to his tathei- in-law Abdur Rahman of Hair ah. After as full an investigation as was possible th^ Government of India were asked to sanction the deportation of this man m addition to the levying of a fine from the young Shaikh. A matter which may perhaps in future years assume serious proportions is noticed in the pretensions of the Wahhabi Governor of Hasa to vollect Zikat (religious tribute) from the Bedouin tribes of Trucial Oman and the inhabitants of the Baraimi oasis. Ui UlC XJaiaii-LiL v^cic-iw. ,. . Five of fhe Trucial Chiefs and also the Shaikh of Qatar are Hanhali m creed (verv close to Wahhabi), while the remaining two—of ^ ■nivihi—are Maliki like the people of Bahrain and Egypt. It is a difficult matter for'the Hanbalis to resist the commands of the powerful Tkhwan, but the outcome of the ^rSus secret conferences, which are reported to have been held between thp Chiefs seems to be that they all desire to maintain their complete mcepei the Uiiets, see taxation rather than to become subordinate allies ot T C *Z sovweign of whose rwent sMcesses they acclahn themselves to be most proud.

The people of Muharraq town have been given one good well, complete with cistern and about 16 taps, which relieves them of the trouble of drawing from a sub-marine spring. Two or three more wells are to be sunk in this town. Outside Manama a similar well has been s t unk, and some six or eight wells along the north coast of the big island are projected. Towards the close of the year Shaikh Hamad signed a concession in favour of the Eastern and General Syndicate, Limited, represented by Major Holmes, • to explore for oil. Kuwait. —Relations between the Shaikh and his neighbours of Iraq and Najd were uniformally good throughout the year, although the Sultan Abdul Aziz bin Sa'ud still prohibits his subjects from trading with the Ohiefship or importing their requirements, through the port of Kuwait. From January to June raids and counter-raids between IkMvan and seceders from their camps were frequent on the outskirts of the Ohiefship, generally near Jahrah. These only came to an end when the Iraq Government ordered the seceders to live further north of the Najd boundary. Major More has described five raids committed by the Ihhwan and three iii which the seceders were the' transgressors. When the Ikhwan captured Kuwaitis' property they generally returned it with apologies. A migration of Kuwait pearl-divers to Oeylon in January 1925 proved un profitable. The local pearling industry also suffered both from a small catch and a bad market. It is gratifying to read that communications between Kuwait and Basrah are being improved by the construction of a road and the inauguration under a 50 years' concession of a motor-car service which will soon no doubt carry the mails. An Order in Oouncil, approved by His Majesty the Kin 9: Emperor in Council, came into effect from the 1st October with the Shaikh's knowledge and concurrence. Najd. —Major Daly has commented on the unsatisfactory conditions pre vailing in the districts of Eastern Arabia belonging to Ibn Sa'ud, where the Governors (Amirs) are functioning more autocratically and harshly than when their Sovereign resided at Riadh. In the report on the Trucial Coast, also, notice has been taken of the Hasa Amir's encroachments on the hinterland of the Abu Dhabi Chief ship. Up to the close of the year nothing sufficiently serious had occurred to warrant a suggestion that a protest should be made to the Sultan. Slave Trade. —76 salves were manumitted during the year. Of these onlv 10 took refuge in Consulates in Persia, and some of these had escaped from the Arab Coast. It is regrettable that with regard to Kuwait and the ports of Najd no Slave treaties exist. Resume. —As regards South Persia it may perha-ns be said that only one incident of importance occurred during the year which we can regret. This was the cruel and treacherous treatment extended to the aged Shaikh of Mohammerah. In all other respects British interests have prospered. The future of Persia seems to be set fair. On the Arab side confidence about Muscat's ability to escape bankruptcy and dismemberment is increasing. Bahrain is contented and thriving. Kuwait, where there are onlv four Indian traders and artisans, gives no cause for anxiety. The Chiefs of the Trucial Coast have perceptibly drawn nearer together and towards this Residency owing to their common fear of Ibn Sa'ud. The last named Prince has continued his most successful career, but the sphere of his activities is at present so far removed from the Persian Gulf that he ceases to be a subject for inclusion in this report.5 CHAPTER H.

Headlam, C.S.I., C.I.E., D.S.O., Director, Royal Indian Marine, visited Bushire in November in the course of a tour in the Persian Gulf. , Section 5. Lc'cal Government. Governor of the Gulf Ports. —Reza Khan Atabegi (Viqar-ul-Mulk) wa,&lt; .Governor until his death on the 17th September'. His friendly disposition towards the British continued, but he was not popular locally among' the Persians, as he was a weak man and had no money of his own to spend. He died after a short illness, and his assistant, Muhammad Karim Khan Waziri, officiated in his place, pending- the appointment of a successor. On the 13th October this latter arrived in the person of Mirza Jafar Khan Kwajah Nuri' (M ovafaq-ud-Dowleh), and he took over formal charge as' Governor. He is an uncle of the Governor-General for Ears, and a pleasant spoken gentleman, with no outstanding qualities. He seems, like his predecessor, to be of a friendly disposition towards the British, and there is no doubt that like him too he is not strong enough to oppose the authority of the Military. Karguzar.—Kgka Muhammad Mirza Ali Khan, O.B.E. (Muntasir-ul-Mulk) continued as Karguzar throughout the year. He has continued his pleasant relations with the British authorities, and, though taking care to avoid any outward appearance of being pro-British, he has never been other than helpful in settling matters in a mutually satisfactory way. He was elected in November as one of the deputies from Bushire to the Constituent Assembly and was accord- ins-lv away from Bushire from the 26th November to the end of the year. During this'period his assistant, Muhammad Ali Khan (Sadid-us-Sultaneh) officiated for him This latter had come from Bandar Abbas, where he had been Karguzar dnring the year. While in this latter port he had been definitely engaged m pro-Bolshevik activities, and had been removed from there at British instigation Since he has been in Bushire he has openly stated to British officials that he wishes to turn over a new leaf and work for the British This is presumably because he thinks it will pay him better. So far he has been helpful, and he has not been caught out in any doubtful dealings with persons of known anh- British tendencies. Finance Keporimcwi.—Hakim-ul-Mamalek remained in charge throughout the vear His grasping habits made him universally disliked m Bushire, and he came into definite opposition to the Military in connection with municipal matters In an effort to increase their revenues and to provide funds for new read and rail communications, the Persian Government imposed fresh duties ■on tea and sugar in May. These were very unpopular at first among the merchants, ami the increase in smuggling all along the coast has been immense. Section 6. Military. The ascendency of the Military has again continued throughout the year. Amir Lashkar Mahmnd Avram, General Officer Commanding the Southern Bi-i^oi arrived back in Bushire from Khuzistan on the _4th February and left fo, Saz on the 11th February. While he was in Bushire that hardy annual, toi feniraz en ine x-u, - for Dasllti and Dashtistan, again cropped up, and It was' decided that 800 men were necessary, and must be found. This, how- ^^X^Iiril^tearalir^sited Bushire from the 16th to the I9th August when en mite from Shiraz to Mohammerah, and again on the 2nd and 3rd Novem- ber when returning. m On the 20th March the Rais-i-Qushun (Officer Commanding Troops), and the Rais -i-Nazmiyeh (Officer-in-Charge of Police) quarrelled, and, owing to the people taking the side of the former, the Governor was compelled to susp the Rais -i-Nazmiyeh, rather unwillingly. ■w- ^ 4 nmniiw ip—i— i——raThe Chief of the Staff of the Southern Division, Sartip Shahzadeh Muham mad Husain Mirza, who arrived in Bushire from Ahwaz, investigated the refrain from interfering in civil matters. Dn-fche- l&amp;th-M_ay^Jiowever, tha Chiiif refrain jtrom iuterlerrin^ in On the 15th May, however, the Chief of the Staff again visited Bushire, and relieved Naib-Sarhang Ali Ashgar Khan of his command as Officer Commanding the Troops at Bushire, and replaced him by Naib Sarhang Muhammad Quli Khan Asad (Sardar Bahadur), a brother of Sardar Asad Bakhtiari. He investigated various charges of corrupt practices and interference in civil matters against him, and left for Shiraz on the 17th May, Ali Ashgar Khan following him two days later. Two other officers were also relieved of their commands in Dashti on charges of blackmailing and ex tortion and were recalled to Shiraz. In July Naib Sarhang Ali Ashgar Khan was reduced to Yawar as a punishment, and the other officers from Dashti were also suitably punished. Yawar Ali Ashgar Khan had not been generally un friendly to British officials while in Bushire, though he had been hostile at times, but no one regretted his departure. His successor, on the contrary, is profoundly pro-British, having been educated at Forest School, Essex. He is a very agree able gentleman, with whom there has been no difficulty of any kind since his arrival. He lias a certain amount of influence due partly to his family, partly to his wealth and partly to his brother being one of the Ministry, and he has im proved the discipline of the Bushire troops out of all knowledge. 'In November a party of Persian Military Officers, consisting of Sartip Shahzadeh Muhammad Hussain Mirza, K.C.V.O., Naib Sarhang Amir Hussain Khan Atapuri, Naib Sarhang (Medical) Karim Khan Hidaiyat and Sultan Hidaiyatullah Khan passed through Bushire to India, to attend the Army manoeuvres, as guests of the Government of India. The disposition of the forces in 'the Bushire area was estimated to be roughly as follows at the beginning and close of the year :— 1st January. 31st December. Bushire 130 mexj. 260 men Borazjun 50 men 60 men Behbehan 2,500 men* 300 men Dilwar 3 men 3 men Lingah .. 50 men 25 men Dashti 30 men 50 men Dilum 400 men* 15 men Section 7. Aviation, In February Air Vice-Marshall Sir Sefton Brancker and Mr. A. J. Cobham passed through Bushire on their return from India to England. In September Sir Sefton Brancker, accompanied by Colonels Burchall and Minchin of the Im perial Airways Ltd., again visited Bushire, and while he went to Tehran to dis cuss the proposed Cairo to Karachi air route with the Persian Government, Colonels Burchall and Minchin went on to India to more thoroughly investigate the route. Colonel Marquis de Pinedo in the Royal Italian naval seaplane ' Savpia ' passed through Bushire on the 27th April on his flight from Italy to Australia, and again on the 3rd November on his return trip. A Persian Military aeroplane arrived from Tehran on the 24th February. Junker aeroplanes arrived on the 3rd and 28th March from Tehran, and left, one for Ahwaz on March the 7th, and one for Tehran on the 31st. Section 8. The Political Situation. This year has been chiefly notable for the determined effort made by, Reza Khan, as Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief, to strengthen still further *Due to the expedition against H. H. the Shaikh of Mohammerah.the control and authority of a stable Government in Persia. This effort culmi nated, on the news being received of the Shah's probable return from Europe, in Eeza Khan assembling a Constituent Assembly, which took the sovereignty from the Qajars and conferred it on Heza Khan and his successors, to be known as the Pahlevi dynasty. These changes have had little effect in Bushire, where the population have been, as usual, singularly apathetic. Some small local changes may, however, be instanced as signs of the times, and showing how the administration is improv ing. In February under instructions from Tehran, the Kadhhuda and his tufangchis who were responsible for the protection of the suburbs of Bushire, where the European Colony among others live, were replaced by the Military, who are naturally more reliable. In May the Government made their first attempt to obtain more funds for necessary developments and communications by imposing a tax on the import of sugar and tea. The Bushire merchants for a time refused to clear any goods through the Customs on account of this tax, maintaining that at least all sugar and tea ordered before the date on which the tax took effect, should be allowed to enter free. But the Government stood firm, and the merchants had ultimately to give in. Incidentally this tax has led to a vast increase in smuggling, from which Arab coast ports ought to be greatly increasing their revenues. ^ The Customs service in Bushire is building several new motor dhows and arming them with a maxim gun apiece, to patrol the coast and act as a preventive service. The situation has become a little Gilbertian, however, as the arrangement appears to be that they borrow policemen to help man these craft, not soldiers, and the former do not know how to handle maxim guns. Therefore when recently a Customs boat wished to board and search a suspicions craft, and fire was opened by the latter from a few old fashioned rifles, the Customs boat had to turn tail and run as she had no one who could.fire her maxim on board ! Attempts were made in July, August and September to disarm the country round Bushire and the districts of the hinterland calling on all possessors of arms to hand them in under penaltv. Some 1.000 old rifles and 10,000 cartridges were collected from the Khans of Hayat Daud, Kudhillah and Angali, but it is reason ably certain that these Khans and their tribesmen have kept their best weapons, and sent them into the hills for safety, or buried them. The attempts to disarm Dashti, Dashtistan and Tangistan were not even outwardly so successful, and the tribes in these districts refused to hand in their weapons and adopted a con tumacious attitude. In view of the fact that he had not enough men in Bushire, with which to invade Dashti and Dashtistan, the Officer Commanding Troops, Bushire, had perforce to acquiesce in the situation thus presented. In December a District Committee was formed of Local Heads of Depart ments for the better transaction of Government business. This is the first sign of decentralization, but it may be observed that neither the Officer Commanding Troops nor the Director of the Customs joined this committee on the plea that they had received no orders on the subject from their superiors. These attempts at stabilising the administration, of course, had the effect of making the Central Government very unpopular among the ignorant tribesmen, who did not understand the reasons for which they were carried out. This un popularity was heightened by rumours that conscription was to be introduced, but this measure had not actually been enacted by the end of the year. The power of the Military has of course increased to some extent again during the year. As instances of this two facts may be mentioned. The first was the opening in Bushire of a girl's school in February in spite of the very determined opposition of the ecclesiastical party. The second and much more important event was the taking over of the Municipality by the Military. This began in September when there were differences between the Eevenue authori ties and the Municipality, and the first attempt by the Military to take the latter over was made then, but there was a strong public feeling against it. However in October the Officer Commanding Troops felt himself strong enough and took control of all municipal matters. The results were at first good, as he began widening thoroughfares, allotting sites for markets, regulating prices of food stuffs and insisting on public baths and shops being kept clean. It is not so certain that the ultimate results will be good, but the military control is likely to remain for the present. In October the Shah's return was impending, and Reza Khan telegraphed that this return had no effect on his own position in the Administration. Secret Instructions were issued to the Military to whip up support for him, and as a9 result tlie notables of BusMre sent under compulsion sympathetic messages to the Nationalist (anti-dynastic) party at Tabriz, In reality no one in Bushire was in the least interested, ontside of official circles, nor were they affected at jail by the Bread riots that occurred somewhat opportunely in Tehran. They elected four deputies to the Constituent Assembly in Tehran, which was to decide the fortunes of the dynasty; but, though the methods of election were said to have not been above bbard, there was no one sufficiently interested to protest. In December Eeza Khan's accession to the throne was celebrated by the officials, but there was no enthusiasm evinced by the general populace. Section 9. Trade and Trade Facilities. Trade. —There is little to chronicle. Money has continued tight, and the continued embargo on the export of silver has helped to keep the market in Bushire in a very sluggish condition. Communications, —Tha Shiraz road remained impracticable for anything except animals from the beginning of the year for some months, and again at the end of the year. Some funds were, however, allocated for its repair, and attempts were made to improve the surface, and to make parapets on the outside edge of the road, on the worst Kutals, and a beginning was made with the con struction of a permanent road over the mashaileh by using the embankment of the old light railway. Postal Facilities. —These remain very much as^ recorded at the end of last year. M. Arjumand is not a very competent official and his subordinates go their own ways with results as might be expected. Foreign Commercial Enterprise.—11. Wassmuss transported some agricul tural machinery to Ahmadi and Chaghadak early in the year, but his efforts were not rewarded and he sustained a heavy loss on the harvest. The rains at. the end of this year having been better and more distributed, his results should show some improvement. Messrs. Unduch closed their Bushire office in February and handed over the Hansa Line Agency to Mirza Hassan Ali Kazaruni (Ghulshan) and Sons. . It has been rumoured that M. Walden's visit to Bushire in December was connected with a proposal to open (1) a branch of the Russian Bank in Bushire and (2) an Agency of a Russian Steamship Company. He also showed interest in the possibility of opening a Russian wireless station in Bushire. Opium. —6,227 cases were exported from Bushire, as against 4,961 cases in 1924. Mr. Tracy Woodward an American enterpreneur in the opiuin trade re turned to Bushire in February. He was arrested in August by the Vice-Consul for the United States of America, who had returned from Tehran, on a charge of illicit trading in opium and contravening the United States Narcotic Drugs. Import and Export Act. He was convicted and ordered to enter into a bond in $ 10,000 for his future good behaviour. He left Bushire for Shanghai. Section 10. Miscellaneous. Mr. Roberts, an employe of the Military, Works Service in Bushire, was wounded at his house by gun shot on the 19th March. He was a convert to Islam, and had married a gipsy (Turki) w T ife. It was not known whether the assailants were relatives of his wife, Tangistani robbers or followers of the e^-Kalantar (Mayor) of Bushire. One of the assailants was, however, caught by the Officer Commanding at Borazjun and five at KhurmUj, and the Bushire Military autho rities took up the case. They confessed to having been sent by Muhammad Ali, son of the late Zair Khidar Khan, our erstwhile enemy, to kill some important European, and thus involve the Persian Government in difficulties. There were many delays in dealing with this case owing to the mutual jealousy for each other felt by the Persian Government Departments who were dealing with the case, but ultimately orders were received to find out what terms: were agreeable to us and on our intimating that if 600 Tomans were paid as com pensation we should consider the case closed ; that amount was forthcoming, and was paid over to us by the Military authorities in August.

Nicholson, I .M.S., on the working of the Residency Dispensary and Charitable Hospital, Bushire, for the year 1925. Major M. A. Nicholson, I.M.S., was in charge of the Residency Dispensary and Charitable Hospital, Bnshire, during the entire year with Khan Sahib Mania Bakhsh, I.O.M., I.M.D., in subordinate charge. Progress was made during the year in organising and equipping the insti tution as a hospital and towards the end of the year the shortage of necessities was gradually overcome. The more adequate means at our disposal for affording relief led to a very large increase in the work of the Hospital chiefly shown in the very large in crease in the Out Patient attendances as against previous years. This indication of the present popularity of the Hospital shows no sign of abating. The great increase in Out Patients has thrown a heavy strain on the original personnel of the Hospital and even with the engagement of extra hands it has not been possible to expand the In Patient side of the work to the same extent. Moreover even if an adequate staff existed for the care and attention of In Patients, at present no accommodation exists for them in or near the Hospital. Until some arrangement can be made towards this end, in-patient work must necessarily be cramped and restricted. Nevertheless duringi the year good progress was made ; more real than apparent owing to the stricter classification between Major and Minor Operations than in tho past. There is every indication that if a better service could be offered the In- Patients would expand in the future as the Out-Patients have done already. Imposition of Quarantine. Owin 0 * to the continued prevalence of plague in Karachi passengers there from were subjected to Quarantine at Bandar Abbas throughout the year. Epidemics.

Review of Conditions and Events in Faes during 1925 to end of March 192G,. Order and Security. The disappearance of several lawless bandits lias given confidence in the districts they formerly troubled. In January 1925 Ismail Mihmrjani was killed in an affray outside Kazarun. In April Fazlullah (Fazu) was arrested at Kazarun, brought to Shiraz, tried by Court-martial, and shot by a firing party. In May Mir Mazkur of Humarjan district,, who had been trapped bv a Boir Ahmadi relative, was brought in to Shiraz and hung. In the •same month Khanbaz Bani Abdullahi, son of the Askar Khan hung in 1911, was hunted down and killed by retainers of Qawam in eastern Fars. A younger brother of Mir Mazkur, Mir Grhulam, is however still at the head of a band, which has attacked and killed soldiers and robbed local caravans in the last six months .of the period. The son of the late Zair Khidhar of Tangistan ^Muhammad Ali Khan) was arrested by the military, removed to Shiraz on May 18th and kept in open 'detention there till August. For a greater part of the year their associate ■during the war 1915-18, Mirza Muhammad Khan Burazjani, Ghazanfar-us- ^altaneh, was also detained at IShiraz, and not allowed to return to Burazjan. Khwajeh Bashi of Kazarun, who had for years disturbed the town and valley of Kazarun by his intrigues and lawlessness, son-in-law of the even more noto rious Nasir Diwan, gave difficulties to the Military Governor of Kazarun in April 1925, was deported and was still in open detention at Shiraz in the spring of 1926, with numerous claims outstanding against him. The Military Authorities found the presence of Nasir Diwan himself in Kazarun productive of dissen sions and undermining their authority, so they removed him in July to Shiraz, whence he was allowed to proceed on pilgrimage to Meshed ; he still has con siderable ' nationalist ' backing, and was permitted to return to Kazarun in Xovember, to the annoyance of the Governor. The valley of Kazarun was indeed more disturbed than distant parts of the province by several bands of marauders, who terrorized the inhabitants of the town, set at nought the authority of the Governor and his small detachment of .soldiers and created an atmosphere for petty robberies from caravans. Thus British and Iraq firms had one bale of cotton goods carried off near the Khwajeh Ibrahim caravansarai on March 23 : one bale almost at the same spot on October 35 : two bales near Ja'farjin on 21st September : one box near Gharum at the •end of August. Persian merchants suffered more frequently : 2 loads of sugar were robbed in May on the road near Diris : 1 load of cottons early in August near Kazarnn : 12 donkey loads of sugar and one load of opium at the end of August : and in September an Amnieh guard was killed while attempting to stop ■a band crossing the road near the place appropriate^ named ' Tul-i-Duzd '. In July a band of outlaws from Dahleh in the hills to the south-west of Kazarun attacked and killed several soldiers and roadguards sent to collect their firearms : and the subsequent marauding of this band as far as the main road from Bushire made it necessary for a force of tufangchis to be raised to assist the troops in an expedition to Dahleh in August But the most serious robbery of the year occurred on December 18th near Qadirabad on the Isfahan road (which had remained unmolested by robbers for some tyo years), when a band of Chahar-rahi under Qasim Khan attacked a caravan of carts and looted some 8 chests of opium, necessitating the dispatch of 150 cavalry to the Chahar-rahi district. By March 1926 Qasim Khan was still at large, and had taken to the hills, though his family had been arrested and several clansmen killed. The new Shah, when receiving the owner of this opinm in January, told him that he would both have the chests recovered and the robber hung. Here it may be noted that the ' Amnieh ' force in Fars fell of in several ways from the promise it had given in 1923 and early 1924. More robberies occurred, and compensation was not forthcoming either for Persian or foreign sufferers. Colonel Sadiq Khan Mu'mini, who as Commandant of all the Amnieh m South Persia transferred his headquarters to Shiraz from Isfahan in the spring and remained in control until the end of October, always complained tnat the central administration of Amnieh in Tehran, had reduced the budget LeGSGFD14 f or ti lG S() uth below worldng level, and had ordered him to suppress eertaiii posts' on the Bushire-Shiraz road in order to create posts on branch routes,_\yhil0 local politicians prevented him from obtaining compensation from iXasir l&gt;iwaii and other Kazaruhis proved to have benefited from robberies Certainly the new broom at the' head of the Persian road-guard service—Amir Lashkar Ahmad Acia Khan who has no perSotial acqnaiutauce with the South— has made the South-East (including Yazd and Karman) and independent command, and has failed to obtain the credit necessary for a sufficiency of giiaras on the mam Isfahan-Bushire road, while calling for the Establishment- tff posts On such com- merciallv secondary roads as BnShire-Bandar Dilan-Behbehan : and 8hiraz. ' Colonel Mu'mini was succeeded in November by Lieut-Colonel Akbar Mirza Qahrimanpur as commandant in the south and south-west, ihe new Commandant's policy of tracking down the actual robbers and making them pay the compensation sounds well iii theory, but in practice does not appear to 1 promise much result. Miliiafy Affairs. The consolidation of military authority has proceeded effetively and' quietlv tip to the autumn of 1924 the command in Fafs had been held by Sartip Fazlullah Khan Zahidi, whose personality had made neither for military efficiency nor the smooth working of political affairs. In the words of his' brother' officers he was not a trained soldier, but an ambitious ^ politician in uniform. He interested himself little ill the discipline or organization of the o-arrison in Bhiraz,- Wished to obtain a military Governor-Generalship of the province for himself, antagonized the civilian Governor-Generals^ Engaged in tortuous intrigue with clerical demagogues alul other elements in Shir a z and elsewhere, treated all politics including the elections from his personal interest, and finally made the South too small to hold both the Amir Lashkar and him- Self.- With the transfer of headquarters of the Southern Division from Isfahan to Shiraz in April a marked change for the bettery became noticeable, firstly in the soldierlv bearing, discipline aild drill of the mell. Mahmud Aqgi Khail Airam^ Amir Lashkar of the South, is by nature courteous and conciliatory : a devot ed adhereni of His Majesty Riza Shah, he seems to wish to take his cue from his sovereign in all the larger matters of policy, which are in his hands rather than in those of the civilian Governor-General. He appears contented with his post,- and gives little encouragement to the busy-bodies and demagigues of the town. He has his limitations in education, military and general and his manipulation of army funds is probably in the old style, for rank and file as well as officers are not paid regularly, and the former badly clothed. In Sartip Prince Muhammad Husain Mirza, K.C.O.V., a son of Farman Farma, he has a capable and talented Chief of Divisional Staff, trained in Europe. The Sartip professes to dislike provincial and other piliticS^ as a disciplinarian he is more feared than his supe rior, and he has a gift for organisation : he is the guiding spirit in municipal improvements in Shiraz, as* he was at Isfahan. He is also an ardent advocate of a somewhat remarkable method, which he lays down aS one ' sine qua non f for the material progress of Persia—the substitution of Roman for Oriental script in writing the Persian language, and suppression 6f certain letters (since this was drafted, there has been a definite movement ill Turkey in this direction).- Movements of Troops. The maximum Strength maintained in Fars during 1925 amounted (in July) to some 2,600 men, composed of :—= Shir ft z : Cavalry . * w ^ * &lt; .. 587 Artillery i . .. 304 Machine GuimerS ' » 93 Infantry .. j .■ ». ,.1,020 Transport .^ ^ CO GO Ancillary Units ^ n» * # t * t. 81 Staff . ; . ;■ i . .. * CO Outlying posts (Abadeh, Kazarun, Dashti, Jahrum, Ninz)— Cavalry ^ ,.50 Infantry * * * ^ » *t 15 With some 12 mountain and field-guns, and 13 machine-guns. Up to mid February 3925, with the concentration in Khuzistan still not dispersed, there were as few as 473 men in Fars. From February 20 some 350 troops with 3 guns on their Way back from Khuzistan were diverted to Bashti and Tangistan, to quell the perennial strife between the village headmen of that large district^ and retained there until August, when they were withdrawn without having effected any real improvement in affairs or disarmed the tribesmen. Between 15th March and 10th April over 420 cavalry, 680 infantry arrived at Shiraz in connection with the establishment there of divisional headquarters, which were joined by the General Officer Commanding on April 29th. After the Arab rising at Muhammareh he left again for Khuzistan on the 15th August and returned on November 5th. In June 1925 some 10 tons of material for a military wireless station were brought from Tehran, but the remaining 30 tons required before the installation can be used had not arrived by the spring of 1926 : in September it was said that* the wireless was to be transferred to Khuzistan. The motor convoy, which brought this material to Shiraz, returned to Tehran with aeroplane timber, wings, engines and .Building Was begun at Bagli-i-Takht under the direction of a pro-Bolshevist Russian, sent specially from Tehran, at the end of March. Some 140 men were transferred to Behbehan in June : some 250 men to Khuzistan in September t 310 were sent to Iverma'n at the end of that month, and 150 cavalry with 2 guns Were dispatched into the Chahar-rahi district on December 24th, and Were still away with their task uncompleted in March 1926. Early in January 1926 some 400 infantry and 270 cavalry, artillery and machine- gunnerS were detailed by Special order from the Shah for service in South Luris- tan against the recalcitrant Lurg. These were the major military movements of the period. In November the Chief of the Divisional Staff, Sartip Prince Muhammad Husain Mirza, who had been absent in Dashtistan from May 8th to 18th, and from May 22nd to June 23rd in Tehran, left with three other officers to attend the 'nanoeuvres in India, whence they returned on December 26th, greatly pleased at the reception given them in India and with plans for improving the kit and condition of the Southern Divi sion, which through no fault of theirs hardly appear likely to materialize. Disarmament. With the Stronger military position and control two steps of the first magni tude in Fars politics were taken by the Amir LaShkar. In May began the disarmament of the Qashqai and Khamseh clansmen, as well as of villagers in the district of Shiraz i on the 3rd and 5th July the Amir Lashkar issued notices to the people of the southern provinces generally, and to owners of village property in particular, giving 25 days* grace for all arms to be surrendered under heavy penalties for weapons discovered subsequently by informers. The Military Authorities have not been Communicative about the number of firearms surrendered : in September 1925 the Chief of the Divi sional Statf gave the figures as 3,200 by the Qashqai : 4,000 by the Khamseh : 1,200 m the district round Shiraz. It is certain however that the collection slackened from the autumn on, and that the southern districts and some of the Qashqai and Khamseh clans, as well as smaller outlying tribes, have not yet been called on to surrender their arms, e.g., Tangistan and Bashti whither the Amir Lashkar had intended to send as a disarming force the troops diverted to Luristan m January 1926. Naturally a large proportion of the weapons surrendered by tribesmen and villagers are of the older and obsolete tvpes, newer pall mis being hidden. But it is a remarkable phenomenon of the times tliat, except tor one isolated case near Kazarun, troops have not been attacked when on disarmament duty and that the measure as a whole has been carried out ^ut the^di^atchof troops to districts at all : for British militarv and ^oked upon disarmament of Fars as an operation of extreme difficulty if undertaken under British control. As a rule the overlord W i 0r + 5 llstnct 1 }} as sent out representative accompanied in some - two or tllree soldiers to receive the rifles : only in the case of the Qashqai16 was a senior military officer posted nominally to assist the Tlldiam, with some 30 men at first. The villagers round Shiraz appear well content with the ciis~ appearance of weapons, and to an old inhabitant of Fars it is strange to trave. for many miles, whether on main-roads or across country, without seeing a single armed man. The only and reasonable complaints by the villagers are that wild boars -do great damage to crops, and that disarmed districts are at a disadvantage when they have neighbours still armed, and anxious to pay oit old .scores t.q., from Parudkhaneh several murderous attacks have been made on villagers of Zira and Shabankareh. The result of the prohibition of the possession of firearms by the inhabitants of Shiraz is unknown : the Divisional Staff have issued a number of permits ' gratis ' to linesmen of the indo-hmropean Telegraph Department, and to British residents, Qashqai affairs. On or about August 7th, with the approval of the Prime Minister—Coim mander-in-Ohief, a military governorship of the Qashqai tribes was created : and thus ended presumably tho line of ten Ilkhanis of the Shahilu clan, who had held practically independent and uncontrolled powers in the ' Turk ' tribes for the past 150 years. Ismail Khan Qashqai (known under his former title as Saulat-ud-Dauleh), though deputy for Jahruna in the Majlis, had remained a virtual hostage in Tehran since the summer of 1924, and moreover had played his cards so badly in the capital that he haft become discredited generally, and an object of suspicion to the Prime Minister (now Shah). His eldest son, Muhammad Nasir Khan, nominal Ilkhani since September 1920, was ordered to reside in Shiraz, and in March 1926 was still detained^ there : his mother and vounger brothers were however permitted at the end of November to live on their estates in Qir and Karzin district. Ahmad Khan Qashqai (better known as Sardar Ihtisham), the half-brother and rival for the past 20 years of Ismail Khan, returned from Tehran in June 1925 with instructions for the Governor-General and General Officer Commanding that lie was to be assisted in taking over his extensive properties in Fars, seized in 1920 by Ismail Khan and withheld ever since. This restitution is understood to have been ordered by the Prime Minister (now Shah) ; but chiefly through his own indecision of character and miserliness Ahmad Khan had not asserted control over the major part of his estates by March 1926. The attitude of the Qashqai tribesmen towards this, and the removal of administrative control from Ismail Khan's family is one of caution : most of them are iinwilling to commit themselves too far in welcoming the new order of affairs for fear lest Ismail Khan should subsequently be allowed to return to rule them : and, knowing his revengeful nature, they still fear reprisals. The mere permission, conceded to him b}^ the Shah, to visit Shiraz at the end of January and return before the coronation to Tehran has sufficed to unsettle the tribal outlook regarding the stability of the new regime. The Finance Department at once availed themselves of the opportunity afforded to post three Revenue Agents in those regions from which Ismail Khan and his son had hitherto by right or might levied taxes, one agent was sent to accompany the tribes on migration and the Military Governor : a second to reside in the northern districts of Fars : the third to make his headquarters at Firuzabad, with control over Qir and Karzin and other districts. In some cases village headmen have come from districts 150 miles distant to offer the Director of Finance to pay the land tax, which for decades had not reached the Government Treasury, but remained a perquisite of Ismail Khan. When the Finance Department can replace the existing schedule of assessment of the Qashqai b&gt; a ' per capita ' tax on their flocks and other animals, the revenue obtained should weigh less heavily on the tribesmen, being better distributed, and bring in a large sum to the provincial exchequer, far more than the 66,000 Tumans, which is the old and present scheduled assessment. Briefly, two great results should accrue from the deportation of the ruling Qashqai family and the confiscation of arms, taken together. The Government will be able to assert its direct control in nearly a score of districts of Fars, where hitherto its authority has been merged in that of the Ilkhani, a great increase in revenue shoiild gradually appear, and the Turki-speaking tribes will no longer be in a position of vantage as regards the settled villagers or able to loot. Many persons opine that the forced settlement of the nomad Qashqai on the land, whether north or south of the Bushire-Shiraz road, and the termina-17 tion of the centuries-oid migratory habit is a 'prime and urgent need for the increase of tillage in the province ; but evidently the capital to create village settlements for the nomads and supply the Qashqai with farming stock, im plements and seeds would be no light sum. Problems still remaining for pacification of province, _ ^ In their cumulative effect the three factors mentioned above—Extension of military control, disarmament and creation of a military governorship of the Qashqai—liave made for a quieter province, and greater tranquillity than has been experienced for several generations. As a practical illustration, the figures of insulators destroyed on the section of the lines of the Indo-European Telegraph Department between Dehbid and Bushire may be quoted :— 11 months, March 1925 to January 1926 295 insulators (183 of which in May and June, during the presence of Khamseh nomads near Dehbid) compare with pril 1924 alone ^ v v v. ^ 300 insulators total damage in the year ended January 31st, 1923 . . Krans 51,322 total damage in the year ended January .3lst, 19^4 .. Krans 30,771 total damage in the year ended January 31st, 1925 .. Krans 26,805 though it may be added that the necessity for taking action to reduce the amount of damage to the lines had to be impressed on the General Officer Commanding and other Persian officials in a round-table conference in February 1925 with the British representatives in Fars. There -should be no misconception however regarding the extent of the authority of the government and penetration of the military in this large and benighted province : great tracts on the west from the Kuh-i-Pa-dina along the Kuhgilu borders through Mamasanni to the Mahur-i-Milatl have hardly seen a soldier of the new army, and are Still run by their tribal chiefs and Kadkhudas in the old fashion Similarly the Fars-Yazd and FarS-Kerman marches, and the country round Abadeh-Tashk down through Sab'eh to the vicinity of Bandar Abbas. And a greater problem still because the country is more difficult of access, the tribesmen better armed and fiercer, is the region of the Shib-kuh •and the hinterland of the coast tor Some two hundred miles as far as Tangistam Provincial Administration. From August 22nd 1924, tlie Governor-General of Pars Was Mirza Mehdi Khan Dadwar (Wuthuq-us-SaltaBeh) till April 22nd, 1925, when he left on Iranster to Keman and was succeeded by Haji Mehdi Khan Nasir Isfandiaii /ii^Tice a r ' :ui5 ' Saltaileh )' wil0 arrived m Shiran an April 30th, 1925 and is still tho IvV 3 ^ 8 f ?

Improvement in methods of Persian government business m this province is probably due^ n part to the closer co-operation between the Heads of departments : and t is has been increased by the formation early in 1926 of a weekly gathering to dis cuss procedure in cases of difficulty.

It will Tie impossible for some time yet to obtain the final fibres of the taxes collected in Fars during the whole year, March 21st, l.&gt;2o to March 20th, 192 , but the Provincial Director of Finance has kindly forwarded the figures for , mouths, as compared with those for a like period in the previous year given in the 9th quarterly report of the U.

At the same time it should be stated that the heavier taxation is bearing hardly on manv individuals and various occupations m the province, subordinate tax'collectors in the districts are generally accused of oppression in their methods. The cultivation of ' Tambaku ' (nicotiana persica) m ^ has been much reduced as the result of the new excise on it : and opium, v mc has been in the past the most valuable and liquid product ot the province and Jas helped to finance imports is purposely being taxed heavily to reduce tne ae u 0 and is not yielding the former profit to cultivator or trader. Further comments on the effect of new taxation are given below under the heading ' Economic Situation '. Posts and Telegraphs. In Mav 1925 the posting service between Shiraz and Isfahan fcariiage of mails and passengers by waggons, horse -drawn) broke down completely. Phe hie-h cost and dearth of forage and irregular payment of accounts by the Ax - ministration ruined the contractor, who Committed suicide After several months of temporary hiring of Ford cars to take the mails, the Cential Ac ministration in Tehran in October 1925 called for tenders for a contract, which was finally given to a group in Isfahan, one Indian proprietor making^an un successful 'tender. The rates are understood to be a monthly subsidy 01 2,0Wi19 trimans paid by the Administration for four posts weekly each way, maximum weight 100 mans or 650 lbs., delivery in 65 hours, with deductions for lateness : 60 Tumans per 100 mans for extra sendings, and excess to be paid above 100 mans' weight at the rate of 3^ cents of a Ivran pei man to Isfahan, o cents from Isfahan to Shiraz. Four light Dodge lorries with wired sides were imported by the contractors and, the winter being exceptionally mild, no interruption of this motor service occurred from snow or floods. A.s a result the mails now reach Shiraz from Tehran in 7 to 8 days. Signs are however not wanting that wear of the vehicles from the surface-conditions of the roads,, and the care lessness and incompetence of the drivers Avill leave the contractors with little margin, if not a loss. On the Bushire road the former contractor, Ali Asghar Khan Dawani Qasid- bashi was re-employed with the excellent result that the mails, carried by relays of mules at four points on the 190 miles, now reach Shiraz in 3J days' marching time, and regularity has been well maintained throughout the winter to the credit of Ali Asghar Khan. The Provincial Director of Posts, Haidar Khan Barah- mani is a meritorious and careful official: and the paucity of the provincial budget alone stops him from improving further and extending postal communi cations: he has the impression that the Postal Administration is still suffering from its conflict with Dr. Millspaugh. Until a large sum be expended on the road from Shiraz to Bushire for re- alio -nment and re-grading, a motor mail contract would be costly and almost certainlv liable to interruptions in winter, and a mistake to institute at present. But of his own initiative, Ali Asghar Khan has arranged to buy a lorry for the transit on the Bushire-Burazjan section. When motor transport tor mails is adopted for the whole distance between Bushire and Shiraz a strong effort is desirable to constrain the Persian Government to alter their present parcel-post system so that parcels will be automatically brought from the sea-port to the centre of the province of destination (Shiraz, Isfahan, Tehian, &amp;c.) for payment of the Customs dues, &amp;c., instead of lying in 'poste restante awaiting instruc tions from addressees for months. Further foreign postage on parcels should be arranged to cover inland rates, as in other countries. Another defect of the postal service in the south arises at times through the sut)T )1 v of stamps becoming exhausted, when the Persian post-office claims to can cel letters for foreign postage by a rubber stamp bearing in the Persian language the words ' Taxe percue '. Instances of addressees in foreign countries having to uav for the absence of postage stamps, doubtless owing to the oriental script ot the rubber stamp being unreadable, seem to call for action at the next interna tional postal convention to remedy this abuse by the provision of bilingual ruober stamps. As regards the telegraphs, damage to the lines showed a marked diminution (vide the figures regarding insulators under the heading ' Security ) and, as tar as the Indo -European Telegraph Department is concerned, there were fewer inci dents with the Military through forcible occupation of the rest-rooms. Ihe build- S L shirab town next to the Persian Telegraph Office, which had been m the care and occupation of the Department since the line was constructed, was handed back to the Persian Government early in 1926, but has not been occupied by the Postal Department as was intended, owing to the attitude of the Persian Tele- o-raph Superintendent. Local newspapers and politicians from Ume to tiniG Srte that branch telegraph lines should be constructed from Shiraz to Fasa i Damb and Lar and other districts, and managed by the Persian Government direct. Mention has already been made under the heading _ Military that vireless material for the army had been brought to Shiraz m the summei w 1925. Roads and Communications. Though credits of 14,000, 22,000 and 17,000 Tmnans had been allowed the branch in Pars of the Public Works Department m the three years ending March 1925 very little can be shown for it on the Bushire and Isfahan loads. P ec 'la tion and misappropriation was practised from the local Persian superintendent of thTdenartment downwards. The exceptionally heavy rams and snowfall of the winter of 1924-25 considerably damaged the surface of the motor-track. How ler since Signer Argenti, the Italian engineer, has been in charge there has been ■hotter and more substantial work done. The causeway over the Qara-aga.li r v r af zinTan was restored and strengthened only to have one arch brought down again by the flood water of March 1926: the precipitous descent of the20 Itudak Kutal lias been given a parapet: and some 3 miles of the former railway embankment across the Mashileh marsh between Chughadak and Bushire have been remade. Owing to a typically Persian intrigue among the staff of the Public Works office in Shiraz Sign or Argenti was however suspended from Feb ruary to April 1926. From February 1926 no further funds seem to have been sapplied from Tehran, and work on the roads has practically been at a standstill, Motor traffic between Bushire and Shiraz remains restricted, though in creasing. In the year 1924-25, 135 cars (including military vehicles) left for Bushire and intermediate places: 112 cars arrived from Bushire. In the 11 months ended February 20, 1926, 387 cars left for Bushire and intermediate places: 375 cars arrived from the Bushire direction. A British contractor from Tehran made the journey with heavy lorries for the transport of military stores^ but declared that he would not face the risks of the Kutals a second time with heavy vehicles. Commercial transport by lorry is indeed not practicable. Some four or five vehicles are known to have been lost over the Kutals. The suppression of road-tolls and substitution of a far heavier charge on imports and exports at the ports and frontiers, a measure passed by the Majlis in March 1926, is expected to result in a large sum being set free for the roads in Fars: and it will remain to be seen whether these sums are wasted on the present patch-work methods or employed under skilled American supervision on, a scheme extending over a period of years. If there be no real improvement to record regarding the Bushire-Shiraz road, a sudden and remarkable development occurred in the last six months of 1925 on several of the secondary roads covering on Shiraz. Without out side assistance and little official intervention traders and landowners on the Shiraz-Istahbanat: Istahbanat-Fasa-Darab: Shiraz-Kawar-Khafr-Jahrum tracks managed to make them passable for motor cars by the use of village labour, in response to an agitation by traders in Lar, Signor Argenti was sent to make a survey early in March 1926, and has selected the route from Lar passing a few farsakhs from Darab, and joining the Fasa-Shiraz road at Daulatabad in Shish- deh (Fasa), at an estimated cost of 9,000 Tumans, to be paid half by the Lari people, in preference to an alignment from Lar to Jahrum, which was estimated at 13,000 Tumans. Communication between Shiraz and Lar by car is expected to be open by September 1926, but its maintenance will depend upon repairs being done to the section between Ivhir and Kharameh. The Shiraz-Niriz route, made under the South Persia Rifles regime, is still in frequent use by cars : but from Niriz to Karman there has been no traffic for the past eighteen months or more, owing to landslides and other trouble on the Niriz-Saidabad section. The quickening of communications from the outlying districts to Shiraz makes for the better government of the province. Municipality. The transfer of the Divisional Headquarters from Isfahan in the spring of 1925 brought to Shiraz an enthusiastic town-planner in the Chief of Divisional Staff. For Shiraz striking changes are being made in consequence. Houses have been pulled down right and left (by 4 force majeure ' and with little or no compensation paid, it is true): also all the galleries crossing or overhanging* streets sufficiently in order to permit the widening of several streets sufficiently for carriages and cars to penetrate into the centre of the town from several points. Roads have been paved: part of the palace garden has been sold, and its walls pulled down. The main avenue has been laid out in boulevard fashion.* and a ceitain number of electric lights installed. Scavenging improved con siderably But in February, with the passing of the Law for the abolition of 1 Nawaqil ' (octroi), the Municipality lost its only real source of revenue: and owing to typical mismanagement by the Central Administration of Finance no- funds have been supplied for some three months out of the proceeds of the new tax, so that even scavenging and lighting ceased. Police. Lndei Lieut.-Colonel Ibrahim Khan Sharif, a tactful and friendly person- ™ L' uc ^ *! 1 1 Euro P e J the small force in Shiraz town—about 165 men and officers-- is still hampered by difficulties. The military provost-marshal with his soldiers has appropriated many of the functions of the civil authority. In order to know what Persian suspects might be in Shiraz the provincial authorities 7 in May lJ2o ordered that every Persian subject leaving the town should pre viously obtain a permit from the police-station, to be shown to the police-agents'21 on duty at special posts on the roads outside the town. This measure was ex tended to provide a check on possible Bolshevik agitators, and applied to Euro peans. To save annoyance to British subject while the principle of their im munity from such restrictions and measures was maintained, an arrangement was effected by which Europeans were merely asked to write their names, and addresses in Shiraz on forms handed to them at the posts, and nothing was re quired of known resident foreign subjects. In May 1925 the Governor-General called for names of foreign subjects resident or temporarily staying in Shiraz to be communicated: the British and French consular representatives complied : the Soviet Russian agent did not. A case of some importance as a precedent arose in May when a motor lorry, owned by a British subject, but driven by a Persian knocked down a Sayyid who subsequently died. The Public Prosecutor ordered the police to attach the lorry, and the relatives of the deceased claimed it as blood compensation under the religions law. For 18 days it was not released from attachment owing to failure of the Karguzar to press the matter, though he was informed that in n somewhat similar case in Tehran the driver (a British subject) and not the Persian owTier had been held responsible for compensation. Subsequently a claim for 96 Tumans on account of the detention was prefer red against the Provincial Authorities, but still remains unpaid. Education. Though the budget has been increased, the arrangements are said to be far behind those of other large towns in Persia. There are too many schools, and many teachers are insufficiently qualified to teach, so that the newspapers con tinue to represent the state of education as deplorable. Until the end of July 1925 an enlightened and energetic official, Mirza Habib- ul lah Khan Amuzgar, was in charge: he was then succeeded by Mirza Muham- mad Ali Khan Bamdad, formerly an editor in Tehran, who had come in the train of the Gov.-General to Shiraz. His period of direction lasted only to February 1926, when he was succeeded by Saiyyid Muhammad Savehi (Sultan-ul-Ulama) who had been Director in Fars during 1922-23 and later a deputy in the Majlis lor Shiraz. Bamdad set up a Literary Society, where a number of papers were read during the year. Justice. If there has been a remarkable improvement in the security of the south dur ing the past two years, it is impossible to discern any sign of a better administra tion of justice. Probably it is not- incorrect to say that the judicial and lega] system is more helpless and scandalous than it was when there were only Courts of the greater Mujtahids and the rough and ready methods of the Governor- Generals, twenty years ago. The amount of chicanery and deliberate fraud, which now prevails unpunished, is inconceivable. With the rising dominance of the army and military commanders another sinister feature threatens to make matters worse. From privates upwards the soldiers are not made amenable to civil justice. Unless the military command voluntarily punishes a soldier for an offence against a civilian, no redress is possible: and the military command is chary of allowing confrontation of accused and acetiser, or a regular trial. Officers lease houses and do not pay lents, oi debts: they take by intimidation or as bribes considerable sums from districts and villages, where they are sent on missions or quartered. Privates aie not paid full pay, while embezzling of the public funds goes on among the higher officers, through whwose hands the spending on supplies passes. Further civilians aie arrested right and left by the military and kept in confinement or under detention, without trial, for unlimited periods under the cloak of 4 Martia] Law ,^which is still maintained in name in this province and town: nothing transpires of the sums paid by prisoners for their release, but it is doubtful whe ther any government fund benefits. The Adlieh, or Court of Justice of Fars, is com emned on all hands, even by the highest officials like the Governor-Genera] ana Amir Lashkar, for its corruption and chaotic, interminable methods, so that sm oi s are well-advised to keep clear of the pleaders or 'Wakils' who dominate its proceedings, and who will such dry both parties to a suit, and still leave the case undecided. No doubt there are officials in the judicial service, who prefer ones y and are disappointed at the condition of affairs, but their number is few, in May 19-5 forgeries on a remarkable scale by a band of individuals, some of Le586PDthem connected with the Adlieh, came to light, and hundreds of papers purporting to convey landed property were founded. One or two of the lesser fry were given a short term of imprisonment, but owing to the religious law, on which the exist ing practice of the 'Adlieh is based, requiring that criminals must confess their crimes before sentence can be given, the principal accused are still unsentenced but confined, because despite methods of mild torure they will not admit their guilt. No government machinery for registering the title to landed property has yet been created. Non-Muslim foreigners are not allowed to be the guardians of Muslim foreign subjects. Bogus claims and the wiles of defendants are not guarded against by the sum claimed being brought into Court, and expenses and damages being awarded for groundless claims. Fraud is more scandalously rife perhaps among the people of position and turbaned folk than among the lower classes: yet the existing system would stand convicted—if on no other grounds—by the fact that no middle-class or well-to-do citizen or cleric is ever prosecuted by the Authorities, however well-known his fraud may have become to the latter, 'There is no initiative by the Authorities in tracking down and hav ing punished by the Court crimes or misdemeanours, though such cases come daily to the public notice. Commercial contracts are broken, and ignored, and debtors abscond: the parties liable are not, and cannot be, brought to book. For this reason investment of foreign capital by companies or merchants ought not to be allowed by the foreign governments concerned, and credit should be strictly limited. Another grave defect of the Persian legal system, as seen in thig province, is the inability to sue the Government through the provincial depart ment concerned for any loss occasioned, or the extraction of any sum not accord ing to the sanction of the Majlis, or wrong done by its agents, and to obtain damages on proof in court. The Consulate at Shiraz has been brought up against the system of in justice described above in cases where large properties have been made away with by individuals, who i^i Europe would be serving long term sentences for criminal fraud: and, even where a monetary settlement has been wrung out, the many instances of patent fraud revealed have not been taken up by the Authori ties. Even in the Karguzarate the new and laborious method of recording the generally futile, wordy arguments between the pleaders, who at times appear in that court, have made it more difficult to arrive at decisions. Sooner or later no doubt there will be an outcry for the abolition of extra territorial rights and courts: it is for consideration whether it would not be worth while, province by province, to begin now a file of criminal and civil cases, where from the standpoint of the laws and procedure of other countries a scandalous denial of justice has occurred in the 'Adlieh, so that, when the need does arise, it may be possible to convict and shame the Persian Government out of its own mouth. Mir ^a Ibrahim Khan Qawam (formerly Qawam-ul-Mulk) .—From the end of February to the 11th Apj-il 1925 Mirza Ibrahim Khan Qawam was away in eastern Fars, and in some difficulty owing to the unruly and defiant attitude of parts of the Khamseh tribes, particularly the Khans of the Baharlu. This was probably lessened by the death of Khanbaz Khan Bani Abdullahi in May. But the insubordination was connected with a rumour that the Khamseh tribes were ''o he taken away from the hereditary governorship of the Qawami family by the Government. Mirza Ibrahim Khan was himself greatly exercised during the summer over his future and the intentions of the Prime Minister (now H. I. M, the Shah), and his preoccupation was increased when a military government was established for the Qashqai. According to his own statements he offered to lay down his governorship of the eastern regions of Fars whenever the military . authorities desired, but was given to understand in reply that they wished exist ing arrangements to continue. However Mirza Ibrahim Khan must have still been nervous, for in June he approached the Consulate with the extraordinary proposal that he should make over all his estates to be run by the Consulate, or by anyone, British or Persian, appointed by the British authorities in Persia, he himself to receive an income from the proceeds of the estates, the balance of the revenue from leases, etc., to be used for the development of the province. In his idea, he would under such an arrangement be able to leave Shiraz and Fars, knowing that his interests were protected. It took considerable explanation to prove to him that Ins idea would be quashed by his government. But his collateral object of obtaining better and expert development of his estates was helped forward by Ids addressing through His Majesty's Minister an application for the services of23 a. trained British estate agent and agriculturist. The Persian Prime Minister (now H. I. M. the Shah) to whom Mirza Ibrahim Khan communicated his patrio tic desire to develop his lands for the general good example of Fars sanctioned the engagement of experts. His Majesty's Government are endeavouring to find a suitable person; but it is not easy, and the principle at stake, as Mirza Ibrahim Khan realises, is considerable, because for the future agricultural deve lopment of the province much depends on the success or failure of the first trained European estate agent. ji September 1925 the United States Financial Advisers notified Mirzf Ibrahim Khan that the Farman of the extensive properties in Darab, which he had purchased two years previously through the British Legation,' acting as executor for the late Prince Muayid-ud-Dauleh, was insufficient title, and called on him to produce better documents within one month under pain of attachment of the properties by the State. Though a respite has been obtained for an inde- iinite period this imbroglio has not yet been adjusted. One effect it had ^as to accentuate the procrastination of Mirza Ibrahim Khan in paying some nine thousand Tumans to the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers Ltd. in accordance with an agreement signed in April 1925 between himself, the manager of the company in South Persia, and the Karguzar of Fars, and ratified subsequently by the Ministries for Foreign Affairs and Interior in Tehran. This agreement was by way of compromise of a claim for nearly 20,000 Tumans on account of a rob bery in 1913 of carpets by Baharlu tribesmen under the jurisdiction of the late Qawam-ul-Mulk, and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs (Wuthuq-ud-Dauleli) sanctioned an arrangement by which Qawam-ul-Mulk should pay the compen sation and receive in return certain lands in Darab in the hands of the Baharki chiefs. Mirza Ibrahim Khan adopted the attitude that as the United States advisers were challenging his rights to the other D^rab lands, they should, as well as the Persian Ministers, endorse the transfer of the lands to him, before he paid the money to the British company. It necessitated a special visit from Kerman of the manager of the company and a month's hard work with all autho rities before the case was finally settled in April 1926. , The United States advisers also went so far as to put Under nominal attach ment the winter residence of Mirza Ibrahim Khan on the ground that before its sale to Prince Farman Farma (who sold it in 1919 to Mirza Ibrahim Khan Q a warn) it was mortgaged to the Russian Loan Bank (now Bank-i-Iran) by its owner. ' ■ ■ ;r ■ The position of Mirza Ibrahim Khan however underwent a noticeable chan^ from the end of November, and left him— at any rate for the present— master of all his difficulties. When the nationalist committee at Tabriz launched the movement for the deposition of the Qajar dynasty, Mirza Ibrahim Khan put himself at the head or the movement m response from Shiraz and, the deposition effected, worked to lead to Tehran a group of deputies from Fars to the Constituent Assembly pledged to nominate Riza Khan Pahlawi as Shah. It was only the third occa sion on which Mirza Ibrahim Khan had visited Tehran and, difficult though he is in meeting monetary claims, he seems to have spent lavishly in entertafn- nient m the capital in honour of the new Shah's accession,Avith the avowed'pur pose ot attracting attention to Fars and regaining for its representatives the consideration they had lost during the past decade. As a result he appears to have won the confidence, and approval of his new sovereign (and consequently .he deference of the military command in South Persia) and the gratified satis- ' Taction of his fellow Shirazis, particularly the journalists: and his political posi tion m lars is at present stronger than ever before. He has played his cards well, and undoubtedly wishes to have a share in improving the condition of his own province. Logically however, when the rest of the country is being brought under ; dc direct control of the provincial representatives of the various Ministries in i ehran (War Interior, Finance Posts, &amp;c.) the replacement of the hereditary go\ einment of the Khamseh nomads is an unsatisfactory system. Hitherto in order to keep his influence in the eyes of his fellow-townsmen, and a hold o'ver tiie a i.lagers of his own distant properties, Mirza Ibrahim Khan Qawam has manoetiyred to retain these governorships and jurisdiction: but, if he is wise tVt . ta : lc ® . the initiative in divesting himself of such positions, which run so ' 'i y to the current of the policy of centralization. , /^ il l nteresting feature in the end of 1925 was the attitude of the Soviet Oon- sm-Ocneral towards Mirza Ibrahim Khan: at times Monsieur Walden (who is24 somewhat like the proverbial bull in a china-shop) made Qawam the object of Communist propaganda, while manifesting his hostility to the British sympa thies of Qawam and others in the South. Soviet Russian Affairs. % There are no residents in Shiraz of Russian birth; sometimes a stray Rus sian motor-driver is temporarily here from the north, and there are half-a-dozen merchants of Caucasian descent. From the autumn of 1924 Monsieur Hugo 'Walden (said to feave formerly borne the name 1 Formoff '') has been first Soviet Consul, then Consui-General for South Persia. Communist and propagandist of virulent type, lie has pursued a policy all his. own, differing considerably from that of his two predecessors. On May day 1925 and again on November 7th, the anniversary of the Bolshevist revolu tion, he had some 2,000 and 1,000 people respectively to receptions in the garden which he uses: and the anti-capitalist speeches at the first caused the local autho rities to take certain precautions regarding the second, and forbid the attendance of Persian officials. Nearly all the higher Persian officials, one after the other, have been in difficulties with M. Walden over the quarrels he has picked. In May and June the General Officer Commanding withdrew the Persian military guard from the Consular premises on account of a fancied insult to the army. The Governor- General, Wuthuq-us-Saltaneh complained of M. Walden's propaganda and per sonal hostility to himself: his successor, Haji Mehdi Khan Nasir, cut off all personal relations with the Soviet Consulate from November 1925 till the end of April 1926. The Karguzar, Commandant of Police and Direc tors of Finance and Posts have been the subject of M. Walden's complaints to Tehran over petty incidents, this being his method of asserting his position and intimidating the local Persian Authorities—in short a policy of ' coups d'epingles '. With three or four of the editors of local news-sheets however M. Walden has been constantly busy, as well as in interviews with politicians of the advanced type and some persons connected with the tribes of Fars, trying to instil an anti-British feeling, for he is rabidly anti-British. In private con versations with Persians he loses no opportunity Of displaying this hostility. During the period of activity by local politicians to secure support for their candi dature to the sixth Majlis he was accused by the Authorities of interference, and trying to foment a disturbance by the disgruntled radicals. He is active in spy work, and has attempted to tamper with the posts. From October 20th to November 7th M. Walden was away on a Journey to Isfahan, when he met the new Soviet Minister ; from November 29th to December 23rd he paid a visit to Bushire and Ahwaz, on his return endeavouring to have published a libellous account of Anglo-Persian Oil Company affairs at Abadan, which was censured by the Persian Authorities. y Germans. Count Von Schulenberg, the German Minister to Persia, visited Fars at the end of March 1926. In October 1925 a Baron von und zu Bodman, with hia family and a married associate named Mentel, arrived in Shiraz from Germany to do business in imports from that country, but, with trade so bad, even the German Minister thought it unlikely that they would be able to continue the venture. Herr Wassmuss has paid three visits from the Bushire district, where he is engaged in farming. The Germans in Shiraz and district now number some 16. A German bootmaker has been brought out by some local merchants to leach the craftsmen. Miscellaneous Incidents of the period under report. {a) The visit, from the 18th to 22nd April 1925, of Sir Percy Loraine, His Majesty 's Minister, the first British Envoy to make the journey since Sir Arthur Ilardinge in 1902, produced a useful effect in several ways. The provincial anthorities showed every courtesy, and Mirza Ibrahim Khan Qawam escorted the Minister and his party on their return as far as Persepolis, only tc be accusec in oue Shiraz newspaper of having made a 'secret treaty' there. {h) From April 16th to 24th a distinguished party of oil-geologists employed by the Anglo-Persian Oil Co., Ltd., headed by Professor de Boekh and Mr. ListerTimes were in Fars for the purpose of investigating a suspected 'fault'm the hills of the Bawanat district, apparently of some importance. They lost two motor cars out of ten over precipices on the Bnshire-Srnraz load. (c) On February 13th 1926 the caravan accompanying a party of oil-geolo- siists was attacked by armed men and looted near Warawi m the innterlanc 01 the Shibkuh ports. id) At the end «if July Sir Hormusjee Gowasjee Diiishaw (of Aden and Bombav) accompanied by other members of the Pardee community of Bombay interested in the repatriation of Parsees to Persia, visited Shiraz on their wav to Tehran By orders of the Persian Government they were paid exceptional •consideration by the provincial authorities. There has been a movement m the Press of Shiraz for the enlistment of Parsee capital for the dev elopment 01 Persia, and apparently the Persian Government hoped to lufluence Sir Horw^ec in this direction; but, apart from the stressing of sentimental ties of a common -origin, xw definite result has been noted. Indeed the small and poor Zoroastnai colonv at .Shiraz professes to be disgusted with their rich correligiomsts trora India, who expect hospitality on their sight-seeing journeys and make no dona- tions to local funds. U) After a period of restraint in their attitude towards Great Britain the Press of Shiraz and the demagogue orators were let loose by the Persian 1 rime Minister proclaiming September 5th 1925 as a national day oi mourning ror the events at Medina and the alleged destruction of the tomb of the Piophet :(without apparently waiting for the exact facts to be ascertained) : all papery wrote in a strong anti-British strain of the enemy of Islam, and accused Gieat Britain of having egged on the Wahabi Amir in order to humiliate Islam. (f) 'The elections to the Constituent Assembly in November, which followed so rapidly on the first open announcement of the nationalist committees m lai&gt; riz and other places for deposition of tlie Qajar dynasty, were control e b&gt; ie Militarv Command ; but, handled by Mirza Ibrahim Khan Qawam, resu tec 11 representative and on the whole conservative deputies being sent to lehran on the 29th November. The celebrations on the 15th to 18th December, winch were called forth by the conferring of the sovereignty on Riza Khan ^hiav.i by the Constituent Assembly, were on a scale inipreeedented m bhiraz. l ie Persian officials at these ceremonies seemed to make a point of expressmg t.ic friendliness of the new regime towards Great Britain and the British residents in Persia. Economic Situation. This is not the place for details as to the state of trade. It will suffice to say that the scarcity of money has month by month become more and more marked during the past year, and has contributed to reduce the formerly brisk bazaar of Shiraz to a lifeless shell, in which those tied to trade attempt to keep their heads above water by buying each other's bills. Landowners the so- called notables—are equally hard pressed, living beyond their incomes and un able to lay their hands on ready money even to pay small debts: tins is true of men elected to represent the province in the national assemblies. Sixty to seventy per cent, of the ' money ' circulating m the form of paper at 3 or 4 months' date is said to have no cash behind it. In May 1925 the United States Financial Advisers introduced a government monopoly tax on the import of all sugar and tea, winch, added to the already high duty and surtax, had for one result that a bag- of loaf-sugar arriving Bus in e roadstead at a cost of Rupees 14, or say Krans 42, had to pay Krans 68 m customs dutv, surtax and monopoly tax. It is doubtless true that several million tuma s are accruing annually from customs posts m Persia to the^ Go\ ernment foi laudable object of providing a Railway Fund; but on the f Persian coast inside the Gulf the natural result ot such a fantastic late ot ta lion as 150 to 170 per cent, ad valorem (is there any country m the world whei. the sugar and tea of the people is taxed higher?) has been an enormous ex^ sion of the already too prevalent smuggling. ^ hen the Arab coast poits c &lt; - ■ only a 5 per cent, duty it clearly pays handsomely to take sugar and te* acioss by native sailing craft to the Persian shore. Sugar was previous .y in a a cash commodity, and a staple of trade for every merchant, big oi sma . heavy duties now payable are driving nearly all the small men ou o^ le .a . while the more substantial merchants have constantly been oblighec o se a Lc586FD26 loss because of the smuggled sugar reaching as for as Isfahan m competition, and because of falling markets abroad. Worse was to come with the introduction by the United States Financial Advisers, and passing by the Majlis, of a law to rep^e the ea^ng ( octroi) and Road Toll exactions by a CompouJided Road Tax, and have this col- K at the ports and frontiers according to a schedule for sugar was not ex- empt from this, and the charges per cwt. of sugar landed at Bushir* became nearer Krans 80 than Krans 70. Some of tlie soundest merchants of Shiraz are of opinion, that the mcreasmg- scarcity of money in trade, which is at the bottom of the prevailing depression, is lart-elv due to these heavy taxes and to the^money being mimobihsed at Ten- ran and,' so to speak, withdrawn from circulation m the south. The decision of the Persian Government on the advice of their Financial Advisers to reform the currency is doubtless necessary and will ultimately bene- lit the Government ; but the nature of the measures used as seen m practice in the provinces, would be bound to call forth sharp criticism from even the warmest well-wishers of the Financial Advisers. In the space of twelve months they have paralysed trade in the bazaars no less than three times, largely, it would seem, bccanse they have not troubled to take the public into their confidence m ad vance by notices and articles in the Press explaining the scope and object oi the steps, and because they have not prevented profiteers from exploiting the situ ation. New coin has not been supplied from Tehran to replace tjie old and people holding coin light in weight or defaced (as so much of it is m this pro vince) are mulcted of a discount on such coins paid m to the Bank or Govern ment departments. Shopkeepers and money-changers have increased the rate? of discount, inflicting hardship on the poor. At intervals after light-weight anc defaced coin have been strictly collected and taken at a discount, oroers have come from the capital relaxing the rates for collection, and the public has jumped to the conclusion that the collected coin is then put back into circulation at par. In July for some eleven days the bazaars were completely closed owing to tne widespread discontent. There is considerable anxiety in the province over the measures taken to suppress the export of opium, which is the only crop giving a large return to the agriculturist. So many persons of all classes, from the field to the ware houses are kept from want, or enabled to make a living by opium, and the pi o- vision of funds to buy the various commodities of trade so much depends on opium that the outcry in Fars is considerable. There has been too great disappointment at the plans of the Government for railwav building leaving out Fars from any early alignments. Peculiarly lack ing in a sense of organization the people in the interior of tne south seem help- Jess to devise means to market their agricultural produce or get it down to the spa-coast: a cooperative system is foreign to their character. _ The population of the province is far below what it ought to be for any intensive development: and the mortality probably exceeds the birth-rate. It is almost pathetic to observe on the one hand the awakening desire to discover the ways to prosperity, and on the other the extreme depression and discouragement at finding no outlets for activity, and dwindling employment. The vitality of Persia is seemingly inexhaustible, as so many prognostica tions in the past have been falsified. But, to sum up this report on existing con ditions in Fars, if the country has triumphantly mastered the long -standing mouace and problem of internal insecurity, it is now in the grips of almost as grim and debilitating a struggle in the economic situation, and suffering from the effects of a growing and vicious disregard of elementary principles ot ad- mi nistration of justice ruling in the modern world.. BL G. a27 CHAPTER IV. Note oit events iist the ]Bikarz Area during the year 1925. The prosoni Military Officer in Mishun is Naib Azizzulah Khan who relieved Naib Husain A^iia. This officer, who is a weak charactered, iiidivio.ua 1, is inoi e tractable limn Ins predecessors. Gada Khan has continned as Head of the Kashknli guards during the yeai, the average number of which has been forty. The guarding of Granowah is still in the hands of Haidar Khan, and his son Allah Karam Khan still maintains his post as Head of the Guards, the number of which remains unaltered. During the year under review the Company has extended its operations into new territory on the right bank of the Zuhra river and some thirtyone miles of road have been constructed from Mishun to Baba Mohammed (Gach Qaraguli). The last ten miles of this road north of the Zuhra river are in Babui country. This extension necessitated further guarding arrangements and fourteen tofang- chis were obtained from Assad Khan Kalantar of the Basht Babui tribe. They were put under one Karam Khan, who is a nephew of the Kalantar. Considerable local benefit was derived from the enhanced programme, some thousands of labourers being employed on road construction. These were re cruited principally from the Kashkuli and Darrashuri sections of the Qashgai tribe with a small proportion of Babuis. In view of the fact that we were work ing in Babui country every endeavour was made to employ as many of the local people as offered themselves. They were however more attracted to their agri cultural pursuits. During the latter months of the road construction ample labour was forth coming and no difficulties were experienced. On completion of the road the labour was paid off and dispersed peacefully. Assadullah Khan has recently been appointed as sole Kalantar x)f the Basht Babui tribe and Ilyas Khan continues Kalantar of the Kashkulis. Our relations with both the above-mentioned tribes, with whom we are principally concerned, have been amicable. While our operations in Mishun have, during the past year, been curtailed, corresponding activity will take place in the new area at Gach Qaraguli, to which place both the Babuis and the Darrashuris have claimed ownership. This how ever is a mattor for the Central Government's consideration and in no way affects our operations. It will be noticed that at present we employ Basht Babui guards ; solely at the request of the Persian Authorities. For the first time in three years the Kashkuli Khans have made their winter headquarters in the vicinity of Bikarz and Mishun. Towards the end of the year, Hyas Khan and Hadi Khan on behalf of the Kashkuli Khans, suggested that the Company should enter into an agreement with them. They were informed that, our former agreement having been an- nuled by the Persian Government, no further agreement would be considered,, and that in any case the Government would not countenance the conclusion of agreements with tribal chiefs. The matter, as far as we know, has now been drop ped, as the Khans have probably realized the futility of pressing their claim any further. (Sd.) J. W. DIX.

Mirza Ali Naki Khan (Wathiq-i-Huzoor) was Deputv Governor until the 28th October and left on the 5th November for Lingah on transfer in a similar capacity. He was on the whole, friendly in his attitude towards the Consulate, but .nevertheless a weak official. Mohamed Khan Daneshwar (Binan-ul-Mulk) was appointed Governor ot .Bandar Abbas and Minab and assumed charge of his duties on the 12th Nov ember. He had formerly been Deputy Governor of Garoos in the Hamadan jurisdic- He 4 appears to be a capable administrator, and well disposed towards us generally and was not slow to announce this fact on his arrival. Ling ah.-—K\i Akbar Khan (Movaqqir-ul-Mulk) continued to be Deputy Governor till the 30th May and was succeeded by Mirza Ali Naki Khan (Wathiq-i- liuzoor) on the 6tli November, who remained in office till the end of the year. Agha Mohamed Ali Khan officiated in the interval till the latter's arrival from Bandar -A^bbas. Minah. Mirza Abul Kasim Khan (Salar-i-Ihtesham) was Deputy Governor up to ,&gt;id November when the post was again incorporated in the jurisdiction of the Bandar Abbas Government. Salar-i-Ihtasham proved to be a more capable administrator than his pre decessors during the past- few years and managed to maintain comparative quiet and order m his district. • x ?i a i rl - y in tlle year ai1 attem P t was made bv the Governor of the Gulf Ports to install his nominee the notorious Kohandil Khan (Itimad-i-Nizam) as Deputv Governor but the inhabitants of Minab protested strongly and the latter was com pelled to quit the place before taking over charge. Kohandil Khan, however, succeeded in securing the post in November as the Deputy of the present Governor of Bandar Abbas. Karguzarate. Bandar Ahhas. Mohamed Ali (Sadid-es-Sultaneh) who occupied the post since 1922 was dismissed in May under orders from Tehran, and was suc ceeded by Mirza Eeza Khan (Nizam-el-Wazirah) on the 10th July. Agha Sadid, although very friendly to all appearances, was insincere, and extremely anti-British at heart. He was a corrupt and intriguing official and was believed to be m communication with the Bolshevik Consul at Kerman. ^ 4- ^i 1 ' 0esen \ incumbent Mirza Reza Khan is weak and vacillating and inclin ed to be lazy and inattentive in his duties.29 Lingah. —Agha Sayed Husain Busliiry (Hisham-ul-Wazara) who had enjoy ed a fairly long innings was dismissed in June and replaced by Ali Agha Mirza Ahmed Khan. The dismissal of Sayed Hnsain has had a very salutary effect generally and relations of the Karguzarate with our Agency have since been more cordial. The present incumbent a feeble old man who is eddicted to opium, is, never theless, a distinct improvement on his degenerate and poisonously anti-British predecessor. Finance Department. There was no change during the year in the incumbency of the post of 1 Amin-i-Maliyeh ' at Bandar Abbas, Lingah or Minab and our relations with this department have been satisfactory. Posts and Telegraphs. Agha Sayed Jalal Sadri, Postmaster at Bandar Abbas remained m office throughout the year and his administration continued to be efficient. There was one complaint received from a British Indian subject who report ed that certain Bank of Persia notes enclosed by him in a letter to Charbar were extracted therefrom in transit. The Post Office contended that the letter was delivered intact to the addressee and disclaimed responsibility as its contents had not been insured. The state of affairs at Lingah where Sayed Zamoon the Postmaster, has somehow or another managed to retain his post for the fourth year in succession, is not satisfactory. The above official is too busily engaged in intrigues of all kinds and has bare ly time to attend to his legitimate duties. Notoriously anti-British, he is a lying contributor to several Persian news papers and is believed to be responsible to a great extent for the cleavage between Sunnis and Shias prevalent at Lingah. Municipality, Bandar Abbas. —The same old deplorable condition of the town continues,, in spite of the existence under the presidency of the local Governor of a so-called ' Baladyia ' Committee, the chief business of whose members is apparently to quarrel amongst themselves. Lingah. —This department exists only in name, the Deputy Governor and the Officer Commanding the troops both being interested in depleting its slender re sources, whilst the merchants' on the other hand absolutely refuse to pay taxes and thereby cater for the greed of the two above mentioned officials. v Customs. •Ck - Bandar Abbas. —Monsieur H. Paquet, the Belgian Director of Customs handed over charge to Mirza Mahmoud Khan Marzeban in February on his transfer temporarily to Duzdab, but returned at the end of October. Monsieur Paquet's return to Bandar Abbas was heartily welcomed by Per sian and foreigners alike as his locum tenens Mirza Mahmoud Khan, owing to his policy of crass obstruction, made himself intensely disliked. He gave not a little trouble to H. B. M.'s Consulate by persisting to impose on the staff of the Indo-European Telegraph Department at J ask. Customs duties- which had not been hitherto collected and from which they were exempt in virtue of the Jask Agreement of 1887. His attitude gave rise to a lengthy and useless correspondence and necessi tated a reference on the subject by the Hon'ble the Political Resident to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, before the question was finally settled. Lingah. —Mirza Hashim Khan was Director till September when he was transferred to Meshed. He was relieved by Mr. Ibrahim Rafoo, an Armenian Christian. The relations between the Customs and the Consular Agency have been cor dial throughout. Lc586FD30 Persian Army. Bandar Abbas. —Naib Ali Ashgar Khan was in epmmand of tlie troops in this district throughout the year, Naib Ali Khan Naseri serving under him. The strength of his command remained at about 200 infantry and twenty Sowars mounted on horses and camels. Of these 85 foot soldiers and ten mount ed men composed the Bandar Abbas garrison. Detachments of 50 and 35 regulars were stationed at Minab and Jask res pectively, and about 30 distributed amongst the small Military posts established on the road to Kushkn. The conduct of the Persian troops whilst still leaving much to be desired, Showed a slight improvement. They, are now drilled and subjected to parades almost daily, are fairly well clothed and present a much smarter appearance on the whole than they did for- rnerly. Their salaries, in this area are not paid as regularly as they might be. LmcjaJi. —The strength of the garrison which is drawn from Bnshire is main tained at about 50 infantry under a Second Lieutenant. The conduct of the regulars was extremely unsatisfactory and frequent com plaints of excesses committed by them in the bazaars, were received from the townspeople. Very scant discipline amongst his men was maintained by the subaltern in command whose principal occupation appears to have been to interfere in the affairs of Civil Administration and to bleed the local merchants. The pay of the men was very badly in arrears. During the year under review the health of the troops was poor about 75 per centum of whom being affected with venereal diseases. Condition of the country. , Bandar Abbas. —In spite of the representation made to the Central Oovern- ment by successive Deputy Governors no attempt has been made to police the town, the duties of the police being carried out in a most inefficient maimer partly- by the Governor's tufangchis and partly by Military patrols. Nevertheless, no very serious crimes, were committed during the year nor any murders recorded. Four thefts effecting the property of British Indian subjects were brought to the notice of ttie local authorities. The most important of these was one of a burglary committed in July in the house of a Hyderabadi woman, where gold ornaments valued at 9,000 Krans are alleged to have been carried off. None of the culprits were arrested and brought to justice, nor was any part of the stolen property recovered in the above instances. In September, the theft of gold ornaments ^Vorth 20,000 Krans occurred in the house of a Persian subject, but the authorities were equally unsucessful in tracing the perpetrators or the missing jewellery. Mimb—There was a marked improvement in the state both of the town and of the district in general, attributable to the vigillance exercised by the Deputy Oovernor Mirza Abul Kasim Khan, and the presence of Persian troops. The separation of Minab from jurisdiction of Bandar Abbas ]yas a step in the right direction, but unfortunately in October 1925 it was again brought under the administrative control of the latter. Only one petty theft was reported in this town during the year. In February, during his march from Rudbar in the direction of Minab, Bahadnr-i-Nizam, son of Zargham -i-Sultan eh arrested the notorious outlaw Ibrahim Khan and three of his followers and made them over to the Military Authorities. Later three more men of the same gang were captured. Ibrahim Khan and his six confederates were brought In to Bandar Abbas in May and confined in the Military barracks under a big guard. Under instructions from the Minister of War, Ibrahim Khan was sentenced to be shot and his execution was carried out in August by the Military on the Bandar Abbas pier in the presence of the whole town, •• &gt; 31 ■ , \ With his elimination from the Minab area, the population have been freed from a severe scourage and peace and quiet restored to their homesteads. _ Abbas Khan, his co-outlaw, however, is still at large and is said to be in hiding at Rudan. The Persian Government have ordered the confiscation of the property of the two brothers, Ibrahim and Abbas Khan, in favour of the numerous claimants who have been prey to their depredations during the past five years. Biyahan. —Towards the close of 1924, a Persian force with guns from Kerman, that had been concentrated in the liudbar district, was moved to Minab for operations against Mir Barakat, with the object of his final subjugation. At the outset, small Military post were established at Karghan and Kohastaq. The latter was attacked by Abdulah Khan son of Mir Barakat. One Nizami was killed and a few others made prisoners, but subsequently released. Mir Barakat anticipating the advance of a Persian force against him, forti fied himself at his headquarters at Gooshki, and mustered 1,20U clansmen ready to give battle to the Government troops. Finding that the outlaw chieftain had too superior a force, the Persian Com mander at Biyanban with the consent of the Officer Commanding at Kerman ' opened negotiations with Mir Barakat for a general settlement. That rebel ' inter alia ' offered to pay a sum of 3,000 tomans as blood money for the soldier killed by the tribesmen at Kohastaq. Mir Barakat's proposals were, in the end rejected by the higher Militarv authorities who ordered withdrawal of the troops from the Biyaban district, the Persian Government having decided to postpone their operations till a more suitable opportunity. The force returned to Minab in March and thence proceeded in the direction of Kerman. No Military movements, however, with the above objective, were observed at the close of the year. Condition of the Roads. The Persian Government appear to have awakened at last to a sense of their responsibility in regard-to the safeguarding of the trade routes leading from Bandar Abbas to places in the interior. . These roads^ it might be mentioned, were comparatively safe throughout the year. The Amnyieh guards have been increased along the Kerman-Baft-Daulat- abad route, and further posts established between the latter mentioned place and Bandar Abbas in addition to those maintained by the Army. A branch of the Aminyieh department was opened at Bandar Abbas in October and placed in charge of Naib Lutfa Ali Khan. Thirty guards were re cruited localif to form nucleus of this new force, which received'a stiffening bv the addition of one sergeant and nine Sowars from headquarters. On the main route via the Tang-i-Zandan, only one case of robbery was re ported. This was in April when the post coming from Kerman was attacked by highwaymen at Tang-i-Siyah and two or three parcels and a few carpets were looted. . \ On the lesser frequented route to Kerman via the Tang-i-Novergoon, a camel caravan was attacked also in April between the latter mentioned pass and Daulat- abad and five loads of piece-goods and one load of sugar belonging to British Indian traders were carried off. No, part of the looted property was subsequently recovered nor were the robbers rounded up by the authorities, who based their inaction on the usual pre text of the culprits having come from the Fars area. Arms Traffic. No cases of the confiscation of arms were reported during the year in the Bandar Abbas and Lingah districts. In July, a notice was posted in the town, publishing the orders of the Cen tral Government for the surrender of all arms in possession of the Civil popula tion.82 With th6 exception of a few unimportant surrender® of rifles the order has been a dead letter since its promulgation and no Measures have been taken to en force it. At Lingah the above order has proved a psofitable source of revenue to the Officer Commanding the troops who has permitted the rich to retain possession of their arms on payment to Mm Of fairly substantial bribes* Slave Traffic. Bandar Ahhas. —Eight slaves took refuge in H. B. M. y s Consulate and applied for manumission. All eight Were freed and granted the usual certificates, Lingah. —Two slaves were manumitted. Aviation, Seven British aeroplanes and one Italian Seaplane visited Bandar Abbas', during the year* These were (1) The De Havilland 50 -with Air Vice-Marshal Sir Sefton Brancker, accompanied by Mr. A lam Cobhan and a mechanic that passed through on the 2()ih February ofi her return flight homewards from India. (2) the Royal Italian Seaplane ^ Savoia ' (S. 16 ter type) with Vice-Com mandant F. de Pinedo and one mechanic, on proceeding from Eome to Tokio via Australia alighted on the sea in front of the Consulate on the 28th April and left for Charbar two days later. She returned from India in November and con tinued her homeward flight to Rome. (3) Three Eoyal Air Force Machines under the command of the Flight Lieut. Busk arrived from Karachi in September and returned to India after a stay of two days, conveying Colonels Burchall and Minchin of the Imperial Airways. Limited. (4) Three Koval Air Force aeroplanes under the command of Flight Lieut. H. E. P. Wiggles worth with the above mentioned representatives of the Imperial Airways arrived from Iraq via Bushire on the 14th September. One of these machines had to make a forced landing at Basidu owin^ to engine trouble. &amp; ^ Further trouble was experienced during their stay owing to a severe storm damaging the controls of all three aeroplanes, and the rudder of one. These were replaced from Basrah, and the machines eventually left for Bushire on the 5th of October. The visit oi Colonels^ Burchall and Minchin referred to above was ^or the purpose of making an aerial survey in connection with the Cairo-Karachi service, which the Imperial Airways Limited are arranging to inaugurate in January 1927. ^ In August, Flight Lieut. Moore arrived from Basrah for inspection of the aerodrome and the Boyal Air Force Store Depot and petrol dump. British Indian Troops. The Infantry Guard at the Consulate consisting of one Indian Officer and 18 other ranks drawn from the 3|19th Hyderabad Regiment embarked for Bombay on the 14th March on relief by one Havildar and 17 sepoys of the Ijieth Punjab Regiment. An Indian Officer arrived later and assumed command of the Consulate Guard. The following officers visited Bandar Abbas for inspection of the Consulate ^uard and barracks Lt.-Col G. X. S. Keene lJ16th Punjab Regiment accompanied by Major W. G. Strover, M. V. 0. on the 16th April. Captain D. Powell, 1 1 16th Punjab Regiment, from the 23rd to 28th May. Captain M. M. Khan, I.M.S., Senior Medical Officer, Gulf Ports on the 28th May, Naihand Base. vr ?J r ; ^dfrey, Garrison Engineer (M. &amp; E.) Bushire accompanied by Mr. D Heaton, arrived m January, m connection with the disposal of the Mili- 1924 res at thls cantonment, which had been evacuated in July33 The buildings were demolislied and all stores either sold locally or shipped elsewhere and the final evacuation of this base was completed by the first week in April. Visits of His Majesty's Ships. Bandar Abbas. —H. M. S. ' Triad ' arrived on the 30th June and remained till the 4th July. H. M. S. u Crocus ' anchored off the roadstead on the Tth September and left the same day. The Royal Indian Marine Ship 11 Lawrence ' paid three visits to the port during the year. Ling ah. —H. M. S. '' Lupin arrived on the 7th March and remained till the 11th March. H. M. S. 11 Cyclamen ' arrived on the 15th August and sailed the same day. The R. I. M- Ship ' Lawrence ' paid four visits to the port fhiring the year. Visits of His Majesty's Representatives. Bandar Abbas. —The Hon'ble Lieut.-Colonel F. B. Prideaux, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and H. B. M.'s Consul-Greneral for Fars Khuzistan, etc., accompanied by Major M. A. Nicholson, Residency Surgeon and Chief Quarantine Medical Officer, Persian Gulf Ports, arrived in R. I. M. S. Lawrence ' on the 20th January, landed and visited H. B. M.'s Consulate and the Naiband base during- the day, re-embarked the same evening and left for Muscat early the following morning. Lingah.-—En route from Bushire to Bandar Abbas, the Political Resident called at Lingah on the 18th January and inspected the Consular Agency. Mr. G. A. Richardson, O.B.E., H. B. M. ? s Consul, Bandar Abbas visited the Consular Agency in March and again in August. British Interests, Indo-European Telegraph Department. —The office at Bandar Abbas worked satisfactorily and there was no interruption of the telegraph line between it and Kerman. Owing to the protection afforded to the latter by the Amnyieh posts estab lished along the line, no instance in which the wires were mischievously cut by passing caravans, was reported, as in previous years. The Indian Government Telegraph ship ' Patrick Stewart ' made four calls at this port during the year. On the 19th March, Mr. E. E. Gunter, Director of the Persian Gulf Section of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, accompanied by Mr. T. F. Tebbut, Chief Electrician landed here and inspected his Department's local office. During the same annual tour, inspection of the offices at Henjam and Lingah were also carried out. Wireless Telegraph Station at Lingah. —Since the burglary reported in last year's report, a Persian guard has been posted for the protection of this station. The receipts from the Radio Office during 1925 showed a slight increase over those for the preceding year. Anglo-rPersian Oil Company. Geological Survey in the Bandar Abbas .—^Hinterland. —The above Com pany's party of two geologists who had arrived in November 1924 for the ex ploitation of oil in the interior was reinforced in February by Professor de Bockh the eminent Hungarian expert and three other senior members of their geological staff. After carrying out a survey of the country between Kuh Ginau and Rudan and Minab the party returned to Bandar Abbas in March and thereafter continu ed their operations in the direction of Khamir and Lingah. Later Messrs. Fowle and Long, who formed the original party, surveyed between Minab and Pahbahan in the Bashakard country and returned to Moham- merah in April. Lc586FD34 Test wells at Salakh, It was decided in April to abandon further operations at these wells, for which borings had first been made in July 1914. The Company's Works at Ras Tarkun, which were under the management of Mr. W. A. Sharp were accordingly closed down, their stores and other pro perty either sold locally or shipped to Mohammerah, and their well established settlement on Kishm Island was evacuated at the end of May, much to the re gret of the inhabitants of that Island to whom it had given employment for the past ten or eleven years. Imperial Bank of Persia. Mr. A. B. Hutchison was Manager of the Bandar Abbas branch of the Bank until the 20th January, when Mr. W. R. Ward took over charge. Tlfe acceptance by the Bank of mutilated and light weight krans was -con tinued until the 22nd June on which date the Persian Government's undertaking to accept such coins at their face value expired. . Owing to local trade depression there appears to have been a decrease in its transactions as compared with the preceding 3^ear. Rates of exchange as quoted by the Bank were as follows :— Highest sterling rate Krans 45 per £1. Lowest sterling rate Krans 42^ per £1. Average sterling rate Krans 43f per £1. Highest rupee selling rate Krans 339 for Rs. 100. Lowest rupee selling rate Krans 317 for Rs. 100. Average rupee selling rate Krans 330 for Rs. 100. / Bed Oxide of Iron. Hormuz Island. —-The output from the mines increased considerably. The export of red oxide during tlfe year under report amounted to 11,115 tons against 6,000 tons in 1924, the whole quantity being transported in British bottoms. 8,615 tons were sent to the United Kingdom and 1,000 tons to the United States of America on account of Frank Strick and Company, London, 1,000 tons to Garston near Liverpool on account of Messrs. Haji Ali Akbar and Sons of Manchester and 500 tons were shipped to India on behalf of Messrs. Turner Morrison and Company. Trade and Commerce. Bandar Ahhas. —Local trade which had considerably expanded received a •set back and gradually decreased till late in the year when it was practically at a stand still. This was due to general trade depression in Persia and other contributary causes, such as decline in the export of opium, the introduction of the surtax on tea and sugar, etc. As a result of the marked decrease in the business in the bazaars, there was one important bankruptcy and several small failures amongst Persian traders. The branch of a British Indian firm that had failed in India, suspended its operations locally and closed down during the year. The Agency and Transport firms, on the other hand, who deal with the greater part of the imports into Bandar Abbas appear to have been reasonably busy and prosperous. During 1924-25 (Persian year 1,303), the latest year for which statistics from the Customs Department are available, the total volume of trade of this district amounted to £1,798,775 roundly of which the imports included £1,310,940 and exports £487,835. 4 An important factor- militating against trade and commerce at this port is the deplorable conditions under which merchandise is landed on the pier where it is subject to pilferage and deterioration through exposure and adverse climatic conditions obtaining.35 It is extrefnely remarkable that in spite of th« fact of several tliousand tons of car^o being landed annnalljv, Bandar Abbas does not possess a proper pier. The masonry Structure known as the Customs jetty does not allow of loaded lighters coming alongside for more than four or five hours daily. The wharf is not lighted at night, the; customs premises are not enclosed and the accommodation for the storage of goods most inadequate. Linf/ah. —The total volume of tradty dtiring 1924-1925 is2 estimated at £364,760 roundly, of whidh £225,135 represents imports and £139,625 the exports. The above figures show an appreciable increase on those for the preceding year, according to the statistics furnished by the Customs Department Shipping. Bandar' Ahbas.—172 steam ships with an aggregate total of 3()4,953 tons entered and cleared the port ; of these 165 wer6 British, 6 German and 1 French. The British India Steam Navigation 1 Company, Ltd., maintained its weekly mail Service from Bombay and Basrah respectively. Messrs. Frank Strick and Company of London sent one or two ships every month with cargo from the United Kingdom-either direct (M via Antwerp. Six vessels of the G-erman Mansa Line called with cargo from Hamburg and Antwerp. LingaJi. —90 steamers aggregating 185,120 ton's entered and cleared These comprised 85 British and 5 German vessels. bailing Craft. 702 sailing vessels of all descriptions flying Persian and Arab colours and' with a total tonnage of 18,977 were registered by the port authorities as having: entered and cleared. Three casualties were reported amongst sailing craft, being dhows laden' with dates and firewood, one of these foundered off Kais, one off Shibkuh and- fhe third off Bandar Muellam. Meteorological. The rainfair at Bandar Abbas and Lingah did not exceed 3 inches at either place and was restricted to the months of January and October. This district was visited by severe storms in September and October. Several slight seismal shocks were recorded at Bandar Abbas^ Lingah and Basidu (Kishm Island) during the year. Political. The hard and fast policy hitherto pursued by this Consulate, viz., one of help ful and friendly sympathy towards the administration and the population: generally, appeal to liave produced the desired result and there is a decided change in their attitude towards the British Government. The relations of H. B. M'. 's Consul with local officials and Persian merchants' have been cordial and there has been a greater tendency on the part of both to- seek his advice and assistance when needed. Scrupulous care has been exercised with a view to avoid being drawn into* discussions of a political nature affecting the constitution and Government of Persia or its domestic affairs. His reluctance m this respect is not always properly understood and is some~ times interpreted by the less informed and inexperienced as indifference on his 4 , part. In this quarter of Persia, the ordinary trader and the f man in the street ' are not usually interested in politics. This form of recreation is reserved for certain of those officials who hail from Tehran and a few of the merchants of the leisured class. The rapid march of events at the capital between the dose of October and mid-December left the majority of the Abassl population unmoved. Such en thusiasm as was said to have been evinced on the occasion of the deposition of the Kajar Dvnesty and the accession to the Throne of Reza Shah Pahlavi, can only be described as siiperficial, and is known to have been evoked and kept alive by36 tlie fanning of the local Governor and Military Commander, i under orders ' from higher authority. The elections in this town to the constituent Assembly were even more farci cal—the names of the Deputies desired by Tehran having been previously com municated to the local authorities. Quarantine and Medical. Bandar Abbas. —Assistant Surgeon D. L. Mackay, held the post of Quarantine Medical Officer of the port and remained in charge of the Consulate Dispensary and the Town, Charitable Dispensary throughout the year. He proceeded on four months' leave to India on the 19th July and Assistant Surgeon A. L. G-reenway, I.M.D., officiated during his absence. Dr. Mackay carried out his duties in a highly efficient manner. His popularity amongst the towns-people and the spread of his fame to outlying- districts have contributed to swell considerably the attendance at the Town Charitable Dispensary and have caused that quasi-British institution to be appreciated to a greater extent. ^ Quarantine. —The health of the port was good and no infectious or con tagious disease occurred. Town Charitable Dispensary. —The number of cases of the more prevalent diseases treated are tabulated for comparison with the figures for the preced ing year :— 1924. 1925. Malaria 893 1,358 Diseases of the Eye . 520 752 Respiratory Diseases .. . 369 323 Diseases of the Digestive System . 936 . 922 Skin Diseases . 199 284 Dysentery . 97 136 Attendance. —There was an appreciable increase in the total number of out-door patients treated as will be observed from the statistics for the past three years furnished below r— 1923 .. .. .. .. .. 4,452 1924 .. .. .. .. .. 4,419 1925 .. .. ... .. .. 5,848 Operations. —The number of operations performed during 1925 was 258 as against 186 in 1924 and 246 in 1923. These comprised incisions of abscesses, reductions of fractures and dis locations, amputations, excision of tumours, extraction of cataracts, iridectomies and extraction of teeth, etc. A craniotomy performed for the removal of a dead full term foetus was* successful. All cases that were operated on, recovered. Bispesary Building and Equipment. —The, building is in a fair state of repair^ The plastering of the roof which was rendered necessary of heavy rain, is being undertaken at present at the expense of Haji Mukhtar Dewani. The furniture and fittings at the medical and surgical appliances are in a serviceable condition. Haji Sheikh Ahmed Gelladari, the leading merchant and most influential person in Bandar Abbas met the cost of extra drugs and dressings that were required for the dispensary to the extent of Rs. 520. Sanitation of the Town. This continues to be very bad and unsatisfactory. As remarked in previous reports no sanitation is practiced by the inhabi tants and the Municipality makes a very poor attempt to remedy the existing evil.37 The present Governor, however, is devoting his attention to the question of sanitation and cleansing of the streets. Lingah. —Assistant Surgeon E. M. Cuzen, continued to be Quaran tine Medical Officer during the year. Clean Bill of Health were issued throughout and no restrictions imposed on vessels arriving at the port. The present building used as a quarantine station is untenable and is practically a heep of debris owing to ravages wrought by the heavy rain in January. Charitable Dispensary. —This is now housed in the Consular Agency Annex and functions on more favourable lines. The out-door attendance for 1925 was 2,095 as compared with 1,857 during the previous year and consisted of— Men . . .. .. .. . • 1,284 Women .. .. .. .. 476 Children Male .. .. . . .. 190 Children Female .. .. .. .. 145 A better type of female patient now attends the dispensary. The prevailing diseases are digestive troubles and ulcers. Economic conditions. Bandar Abbas. —Owing to a somewhat better rain fall the question of the supply of drinking water for the town-people was not as acute during the summer months. The crops in the surrounding districts were fairly plentiful, and the pre vailing rates in the bazaars not unreasonably high. Lingah. —The market was extremely dull odwing to the pearl trade being badly hit by the cultured pearl. The boat building yards were idle, about four boats only being added to the pearling fleet. These four boats were afterwards sold at Dubai, where they fetched a good price. Other economic conditions similar to those at Bandar Abbas obtained here during the year. Prices of food stuffs.

No criminal cases were instituted or disposed of during the year. 56 British subjects were registered during 1925. 3. Indo-European Telegraph Department, —Mr. J. Hamilton remained in charge as Superintendent of the Kerman Office until 14th June, when he handed over' charge to Mr. T. ff. Lovell. The latter was in charge as Assistant Superintendent until 7th December when he handed over charge to Mr. A. L. Eoberton. At present the staff consists of 5 Europeans—2 Assistant Superin tendents and 3 operators—, one Indian Mechanic and Armenian Signallers. Mr. Ti. Ellis remained in charge of the Section Kerman Sub-Division through out the year. Mr. P. E. Dormer remained in charge of the Section Southern Sub-Division throughout the year. No new offices were opened nor any offices closed In the province through out the year. The Telegraph Offices at Bam, Baft and Sir jail are run by Armenian Signallers. 4. Imperial Bank of Persia. —Mr. F. G. T. Nelson remained in charge as the Manager of the Bank throughout the year. Mr. P. W. Douglas was Accountant throughout the year. The question of defective coins caused some little trouble in August when it was announced by the Persian Government that such coin would be accepted at a discount of 10 per cent., in payment of revenue only ; and that the Imperial Bank of Persia would no longer accept such coins._ The Bank subsequently announced that they would continue to accept worn coins, and the agitation which had risen quickly subsided. 5 Church Missionary Society and its work—{a) The educational work under the Bev. A. K. Bovland, and the Rev. A. G. Ozanne who arrived trom Yezd in February, continued to expand. The numbers m the bovs' school rose from 58 to 64 ; and in the girls' school, presided over by Miss TVooarotie, trom 102 to 117. The girls' school, Miss Woodrotfe writes, has still much opposition to face : and is hampered in its activities by lack of accommodation ; but t e curriculum is so obviously practical and advantageous, including as it does lirst aid domestic hygiene and dress making, that it is sure to wm gradually trie approval of the parents. The boys' school is still without a building of its own. (I) The medical and welfare work were in the hands of Dr. G. E. Dodson and Miss Stratton throughout the year. The work on the new hospital made such progress that these spacious buildings were almost ready for use at tlie end of the vear. There were 581 inpatients as compared with ooo last year and 447 the year before ; and 522 operations as against 540 in 1924 . The advent of motor cars to Kerman has made flying visits to ontlvmg districts possible this vear. Four visits were made (taking up 42 hours m travexiing, ms aac of 27 days which would have been required by mule and camel) and 70U patients were treated. The welfare work in the eitv is on the increase ; 97 confinement casos bemg taken up as against 59 in 1924. In addition there were 906 visits paid by patients, and 2,150 made to patients' homes.40 ^ 6. British and British-protected Firms. —The following are tli6 ! British and British-protected Firms working in Kerman :— {i) The Oriental Carpet Manrtfaetnxers, Ltd. (ii) The North West India Trading Co., Ltd, {in) Messrs. S. Borabjee. {iv) Messrs. Bardwil Brothers. (v) Messrs. B. Kazanjian &amp; Co. (vi) Messrs. Costikyan &amp; Co. {vii) Messrs 1 . A. and M. Karaghensian &amp; Co, (viii) The Wetli Co., Ltd. (ix) Messrs. H. S. Tavshanjian &amp; Co. {x) Messrs. Telfeyan &amp; Co. (xi) Messrs. Atiyeh Brothers. The total value of carpets exported by these firms during 1925 and 1926 wa£ approximately as follows 1925. 1926. Krans. Krans. Kerman carpets and rugs . . .. 7,000,000 8,326,858 Tribal rugs .. . . . . 450,000 422,153 Total .. 7,450,000 8,749,011 The carpet trade in general has had a difficult year. Business was slack in America, and firms here were all instructed to go slow with orders. It was: when things were at their worst in the trade that the Oriental Carpet Manu facturers the chief British commercial interest in Kerman, found itself involved in political difficulties with the local authorities, and principally with the* Governor General, His Excelleiicy Vossuq-es-Saltaneh (Dadwar). Early in the year the O. C. M. had found it necessary to buy out the chief master weavers? m Jupar and Mahun—large villages near Kerman—to whom all their work had previously been given out on contract, and to substitute direct relations with weavers. All the looms in these two places now belong to the O. C. M. This- step exposed the O. C. M. to a great deal of jealousy ; threats of injury to- their employees and to actual damage to their property. In the summer while the O. C. M. was prosecuting a case of theft of valuable yarn in the Karguzari court, several large and embarrassing claims against defaulting weavers were brought in the same court by another firms. The Karguzar, pressed by carpet firms to be severe, and by his fellow countrymen to be lenient, ended bv doin^ nothing. ^ Both Karguzar and carpet firms got irritated ; and when Dadwar Ctiine as Go\ ernor Geneial the Karguzar was, perhaps, inclined to misrepresent to the Go\ ernor Geneial the attitude of the carpet firms and to encourage the new arrival in the idea that the firms generally and the O.. C. M. in particular were grasping, vindictive and a great nuisance. This niFiv have been^one reason why the Governor General—who came from Tehran with a reputation for sincere friendship towards British interests- plunged into his strangely malevolent campaign against the O. C. M. He bega/n with a singular act of discourtesy against Mr. Joannides, the Manager of the O. C. M., in a personal matter in which I had to intervene on behalf of Mr. Joannides to save him from real indignity. Dadwar, in spite of an attempted reconciliation I endeavoured to bring about, followed this up first with an attack on the technical manager of the O. C. M. at Mahun whom he- accused of mtertering m politics ; then with a campaign which threatened to involve the whole carpet industry of Kerman in extreme difficulty. He started the notion that the water m which yarns are washed was injurious to health if used lor drinking purposes, and without consultation with any one acquainted wuh the facts or complexities of the affairs, he dashed oil a proclamation for bidding the washing of yarns in such water. Though he professed to make these orders of general application, no attempt was made to enforce them in Kerman where Persian manufacturers would have been concerned ; but his action was conhned m the first place to Mahun and Jupar where the O. C. M. alone was mv ol\ ed. It is unnecessary to detail the negotiations which followed. In the41 end I was able to convince His Excellency that he had, without proper reflection, started a movement whic hwould have far reaching consequences most injurious to the trade on which Kerman depended for its livelihood ; and to persuade him to suspend action till we had some authority for believing such water to be actually injurious and then, if necessary, to permit some friendly discussion with the carpets interests of the place as to a remedy. A sanitary committee met and decided that they could not possibly say whether the prevailing practice was mjunous oi not and anyhow that there were many other practices more obviously injurious ro public health common in the town which ought to be dealt with first. The Governor General then dropped the matter. But the effect of these attacks on the 0. C. M. was to cause that firm serious enough loss. During the summer when His Excellency was at Mahun the turn out from the looms in that place dropped from 7 or 800 square yards the month to a little over 300 square yards. Encouraged by the campaign against the him weavers and shagirds had got slack and deliberately shirked work and the management had not dared to keep them strictly up to the mark. It was Til 0 ? to the end of the y ear before outturn again became normal in the looms at Mahun. Although the progress of British trade is a subject which will be dealt with tully m the Annual Trade Report, brief mention mav be made here of the activities of Mirza Ali Asghar Moinzada, Honorary Correspondent of the -London Chamber of Commerce. Steady efforts to get him into direct business relations with various British exporting houses succeeded in starting the ball lolling ; and a beginning has at last been made. In the summer—as a con- sequence of reports from this Consulate regarding the gradual ousting of A. 1. (J. G. oil by Russian oil, a representative of the A. P. 0. C. visited Kerman with the object of opening a sales agency for A. P. 0. C. products in Kerman and districts. The agency was given to Moinzada. This move had satisfactory political results, for it knocked a decided hole-in the Russian competition. 7. Political Interests of the Consulate. —While the Consulate was involved in the unpleasant struggle between Vossuq-es-Saltaneh and the 0. C. M., a case in which an Armenian employee of the I. E. T. D. was concerned provided a fresh embarrassment. An Armenian Signaller, named Galessiantz, accused a voung man known as Bahjat-us-Sultan, a professional musician and go-between, of breaking into his house at night with evil intent and of assaulting his wife during his absence on ducy. The good officers of the Consulate were asked for ' by the Superintendent in charge of the I. E. T. D. The case went to the State Courts, and there it stuck, thanks largely to the influence of the Officer Com manding wno was a friend of Bahjat's and engineered to ^counter case against Galessiantz. The only way in which I could attempt to make my good offices effective was to ask tne Governor General to do what he could to expedite things. In spite of promises the Governor General not only did nothing helpful ut did his best to make^mischief between myself and the Karguzar and officials of the department of Justice. I inally (yielding I suppose to the Officer Command- mg's persuasions) he went so far as to transfer the accused Bahjat to a sub- governorship in a district near Kerman. The personal protest I was compelled to make at this step, vhich would have made further proceedings in the case futile, though it did not improve my relations with H. E., resulted' in the orders bemg cancelled. But the case has never yet been decided. It has furnished an unhappy proof of the incompetence or subservience of the' State Courts, and of the difficulties in practice of exercising the ' special good offices ' which are enjoined on Consuls in respect of the Persian employees of the I. E. T. D. Several other side issues cropped up in the course of this case and of the campaign against the 0. C. M.— such as the right of police officers to arrest employees of the I. E. T. D. without warning, forcible entry into the houses of British subjects, etc., all of which were in the end adjusted as satisfactorily as might be. * • These incidents showed how easily our peculiar position in Persia can occasion unpleasantness between the Consulate and Persian officials when there may be the best will in the world, on one side, to steer clear of them. The Medina incident, which followed in the early autumn, showed in its turn how ready public opinion is to suspect the British of evil intentions. A malicious word or two in private .and in public gave birth to a general rumour that the British were at the bottom of the bombardment of Medina. The Governor general on this occasion did his best, I believe, to prevent any anti-British demonstration and speeches and the dav of mourning passed off without any Lc586FDunpleasant incident. Tlie flying of tlie Consulate flag at half mast had an excellent effect and was commented on favourably in the local press. Nevertheless, in spite of the uneasiness which characterised the relations between this Consulate and local officialdom during the governorship of Dadwar, it may fairly be said that on the whole the general feeling towards this Consulate is friendlier than it was a year and a half ago and that there is far less hostility open or concealed. In my report last year I expressed the hope that we might sooner or later get to grips with the local extremists. If that has not been done yet, still one of the leading democrats Agha Mehdi, (Chairman of the Kerman Municipality) a notorious pro-German of the days of the War, who had vowed in 1916 that he would never cross the threshold of the Consulate again, came to call and express his regret for the past and his wish for amicable relations in future, now that the policy of His Majesty's Government in Persia was so friendly and disinterested. His defection—with his followers— from the ranks of the Anglophobes is a sign of the improved times. Increased opportunities of social intercourse with Persian officials—who are glad to reciprocate such amenities—proved also to be a useful solvent of misunder standing ; and games—notably football, which has been started this year— provided a common meeting ground and common interest for the two com munities which were lacking before, and which can only do good. Non-interference, as the established policy of His Majesty's Government in Persia, gains credit sk&gt;wly, but surely. It is probably easier to convince the unbeliever of our motives and position in Tehran than in outlying provinces where the drift of political movements is not so well appreciated. It is mani fest by now in Kerman that this Consulate does not interfere in local affairs ; on several occasions in the past year—notably in connection with the cm^-Kajar movement—it was made as clear as can be that we will not take sides in any domestic question big or small. But it is still generally believed that the .Lega tion plays a big part in the wider affairs of the nation at Tehran. Thus Reza Khan's success in October—especially in the light of our early recognition of him—was attributed by every body to the support he had received from His Majestv's Government. It was a current saying that ' the English have 10 more Shahs up their sleeve ' yet it can hardly be doubted that if Ahmed Kajar had chosen to return it would have been a similar story. ' He would not have dared to come back without English support '. This kind of influence is .not imputed to us for evil. On the contrary, however, regretable it may be on ab stract grounds, the consideration in which the Consulate is held varies with the influence which our Legation is supposed to be able to exert in the Capital. And the personal prestige of the Legation is high in the eyes of Kerman. Nobody yet expects Persia to be really independent of foreign influence : and so long- as Soviet and British policy in Persia continue to be opposed—as they are now everywhere recognized to be—most big questions will be viewed in Kerman from that point of view ; and so long as Russia interferes we shall never be given full credit for non-interference. The great point is that our policy is pretty general ly agreed to be more beneficial to Persia than Russia's, and (which is important) founded on considerations of mutual interest. The Soviet Consul's neutrality in the a^ii-Kajar movement was hailed with general relief as a possible turning point. A significant conversation was reported to me by the Editor of a local newspaper who came to see me a short while ago. He had called on some Persian merchants on his way to the Consulate and when he rose to go he remarked that he was coming to see me. ^ Well ' said one of the Persians ' the Russians seem to be dropping out of things here now. We may have our own difficulties in plenty, but thank God we shan't have that old Anglo-Russian question as well to bother us '. (S. Communications. —There was only one trifling robbery which took place during the year in this Province when a Parsee traveller wag robbed of a mule and several packages on the Karman-Yezd road : the property was recovered by the Amniyeh. Traffic was held up on the Duzdab-Kerman road for a short period in the summar firstly owing to th erising of the tribes in the Sarhad and subsequently owing to a private inter-tribal feud in which the Baluch in charge of the Amniyeh guards on a section of this road was involved. While the feud was in progress the guards were too busily engaged to protect the post and as a measure of security caravans did not proceed until the trouble was over. The condition of the roads in the Province was about the same as last year except that on the Du~dab-Kerman road heavy winter rains made motor traffic impossible till repairs had been carried out. These were made possible by the43 Persian Government having sanctioned a grant of Ts. 300 for tlie purpose of which Ts. 200 were spent under the supervision of the Assistant Superintendent of the I. E. T. D. Dahane Bagi. The Officer Commanding by means of forced village labour has, I believe, made fair-weather tracks suitable for motor traffic (under favourable conditions) to Saidabad ; and it is his professed intention to continue this track across the hills to Daulatabad and thence to Kahnoo in Budbar. But even if this project is carried out I do not suppose the track will survive any heavy rain. Mr. Fitzsimmons, the American Provincial Director of Finance, has shown great interest in the matter of communications in the Province and has called several meetings to ventilate the question and interest local merchants. These discussions have not yet reached a practical stage and the schemes vary between making a metal road from Duzdab to Kerman and building a railway from Bandar Abbas. The postal service between Duzdab and Kerman except for an inevitable interruption in the summer consequent on the tfarhad rising was regular and satisfactory. The post takes 6 days at most over the distance 330 miles. The same cannot be said for the postal service from the West. Letters from Tehran- less than twice the distance from Duzdab—take any thing from 4 to 6 weeks, ,a great hindrence to business and to administrative efficiency. B.—Local Government and Politics. 9. Local Officials, Governor General— Governor General, Nizam-ed- Dauleh, did not long servive the difficulties he had got into at the close of 1924 with various local officials and with the Russian Consulate. He blundered badly early in the year by engineering a protest against the head of the Police and the Chairman of the Municipality with the scarcely concealed object of filling these posts with his own nominees ; and was recalled shortly after. People professed to be relieved at his departure and welcomed in His Excellency Vossuq-es- Saltaneh (Dadwar)—who came from Shiraz in the early summer a man who would stand no nonsense. Dadwar began by vigorously squashing local intri gues and activity discouraging any Russo-phil taint he discovered among the officials, thus falling foul of the Soviet Consulate from the start. He got ' Xauzari ' recalled almost immediately, and Mukha'tib, the Telegraph Master, very soon after. But unhappily his zeal for being the strong Governor soon outran his discretion. He embroiled himself (as has already been related) with the O. C. M. and this Consulate : and later, with all the officials of the place by turn. _ He formed round himself a small clique consisting of the Officer Com manding, the Public Prosecutor and one or two smaller fry—all of whom did jusi what the O. C. told them. An atmosphere of suspicion and intrigue grew up which alienated every body, and his recall early in September—after he had turned out the Assistant Governor General Rafat-ud-Dauleh in order to put in a military officer, in defiance of Tehran, was hailed with general relief. He was greedy in money matters ; and though he certainly put a stop to pro-Russian intrigue, Kerman got no practical benefit from his administration. His failure must, I fear, be put down not to lack of capacity but to defects of character. He was certainly led astray by the O. C. ; but more by his own egotism. He was like the man of whom Dr. Johnson said ' he might do very well as long as he could outrun his character ; but the moment his character got up with him it was all j over ' ! Dadwar's character overlook him 2 weeks after he had arrived in Kerman. Finance Department Ezz ul Mamalik was Provincial Director of Finance from the beginning of the year till the middle of October, when he was relieved by Mr. Fitzsimmons. Haji Ezz ul Mamalik was a real friend of this Consulate ; while he eschewed politics, he kept us informed of all that was going on in his own department. He was respected by all classes, and his departure was a great loss to the place. He endeavoured not unsuccessfully to establish some sort of connection with Dost Mohammed of Bampur to whom he sent a military financial mission in the spring which brought back some useful know- leage of the geographical conditions of that region, and revenue arrears to the extent of some 5 or 6 thousand tomans. Mr. Fitzsimmons, who succeeded him, labours under the dual handicap of entire ignorance of the language, and of the country. But his eagerness to be up and doing' scorns such obstacles., and before he had been 10 days in Kerman he had sent invitations to Dost Mohammed of Bampur to Qome in and discuss revenue affairs with him, and had sent similar invitations to 4 Sarhaddi Sardars Lc586FD ......44 round about Bnzdab, not liaving the smallest idea at the time—as he admitted to me—who they were, what the Sarhad was, or where Duzdab lay.^ His en thusiasm in the matter of communications unhampered by the many serious prac tical considerations which lie in the way has already been referred to. His ready accessibility to all and sundry has made him personally pepular ; but it remains to be seen what success attends the working of the department when its director is so entirely in the hands of a couple of interpreters. Karguzar. —Muazzid-i-Azam remained Karguzar throughout the year though at one time his recall was threatened, almost immediately after Nizam-ed-Dauleh had been removed. He is friendly as ever but more timid than he used to be ; and he is understaffed. In the summer when there were many heavy cases :'n his court mostly brought by carpet firms he proved obstinately slow and difficult to handle. His imprisonment, at length, of a defaulting weaver brought on him a storm of protests from Kermanis, and a reprimand from Tehran which have made .him extremely unwilling to take on himself even the most ordinary res ponsibilities of a judge. The work of Karguzar in Kerman is no easy job : and Muazzid-i-Azam has found the difficulties this year more than his easy going nature could cheerfully put up with. The new and elaborate rules regarding judicial procedure in his court have only added to his burdens by dragging cases out and piling up arrears. He contemplates asking Tehran to sanction additional establishment including a public prosecutor—and these addi tions are essential if the work in his court is to proceed with any thing like proper despatch. Police Department. —The notorious ' Nauzari ' {vide last year's report) managed to get himself into serious trouble early in the year, when he and the head of the Municipality (Agha Mehdi) concocted a scheme to widen the roads in the bazaar by demolishing buildings and parts of buildings. They embarked on their work without consultation with the Governor General (Nizam-ed-Dauleh) and carried it out without regard to the feelings of those whose buildings they knocked down. A ridiculous explosion of public indignation took place which Nizam-ed-Dauleh encouraged and supported in the hope of getting rid of these 2 officials and Nauzari in particular who had always been as a thorn in his side. Nauzari was rewarded by being imprisoned, and Agha Mehdi by being removed from his appointment. Nauzari, though re-instated later on—never really re covered from this blow, and in spite of the efforts of the Soviet Consul to save him, he was recalled soon after Vossuq-es-Saltaneh arrived. His place was taken by a young man from Tehran, Yawar Ali Agha Khan, who is a quiet pleasant fellow who keeps out of politics and attends to the working of his own department which he has improved in several ways. Formerly there were -i Police stations in the town and as the new Rais-i-Nazmieh found that he had not enough men at his disposal to make all these 4 stations work properly (the Police force is about 60 strong which is certainly insufficient for this town and its en vironments), he has reduced them to two which cope with the work more effi ciently. The Policemen on patrol duty are also more regular. He gave valuable help to the 0. C. M. in connection with a serious and difficult case of robbery and embezzlement at the close of the year. Altogether a welcome change from ' Nauzari Adliyeh. —Mirza Abdul Rahim Khan remained head of this department throughout the year. Vossuq-es-Saltaneh tried to brand him—unfairly 1 think— as a pro-Russian ; but he keeps out of politics. He is a cultured intelligent man— the first to admit that till his department can give better proof of its impartiality and capability than was afforded by the lamentable Galessiantz case (vide section 7) it would be idle to expect the removal of extra-territorial privileges. The man responsible for the side tracking of that case was Sharif-ul-Mulk T the Public Prosecutor, who arrived in Kerman in February and remained here till he left to attend the Majlis-i-Mu'assisan at the end of the year. A born wire puller and mischief maker (though a pleasant and cultured man withal) he made common cause with the Officer Commanding and Governor General in all their little intrigues. He is no loss to Kerman and the Rais-i-Adliyeh in particular breathes more freely since he left. JSducaiion. —Agha Sadiq Khan, Ansari, was in charge of this department during the year. He is generally credited with being pro-Russian ; and he certainly committed a grave indiscretion at the time of the ' Medina ' incident^ when he publicly accused the British and French Governments of having com bined together to deal this blow to the Mohammedan world. The matter w^s reported to His Majesty's Minister wltli the result that Ansaii was ordered to45 * make amends ' for this gross calumny. He apologised—and since then has been polite and well behaved. He is keen on his work—especially on encouraging sports ; and responded to my introduction of football into Kerman by forming i Clubs ' for officials as well as school boys. No new schools were opened during the year. , Telegraphs. —Mukhatib-es-Sultan, the pro-Eussian Telegraph Master was finally got rid of shortly after Vossuq-es-Saltaneh's arrival. His successor Ghulam Ali Khan Kashi, though he may not be so openly identified with the Russian Consulate is a more dangerous man. Indeed a less unpleasant in dividual in every way it would be hard to find. He is prepared to sell any in formation, even the most secret, to any body who cares to buy : an unscrupulous, dishonest, treacherous man : a disgrace to any service, and a singularly unfortu nate selection as u Official Intelligence Officer ' to the Persian Government in Kerman. Municipality. —Agha Mehdi, who got into trouble in the early spring over the Bazaar demolition affair already referred to was reinstated in due course ; but never recovered his full authority, a military officer being appointed as Supervisor of Municipality affairs. This was Sultan Allahyar Khan, a capable officer (once in the S. P. R.) who has unostentatiously introduced many small improvements in the bazaar : such as wider roads, protection of meat from flies, better lighting, &amp;c. Questions of public health and hygiene are supposed to be looked after by a Sanitary Committee which Vossuq-es-Saltaneh professed some interest in when he arrived. Dr. Dodson, the C. M. S. doctor was invited to attend the fortnightly meetings of this Committee and did so at first ; but he gave it up in despair when he saw that the opinion and advice of the medical mem bers of the Committee was regularly set aside by His Excellency and the other lay members : and that little practical good was ever likely to come of the Com mittee's deliberations ! The one solid achievement of this Committee was when the medical members—having been given a free hand for once—finally scotched the Governor General's scare over dye-water (referred to in Section 7). Amnieh. —Since his arrival, Yawar Azizullah Khan is trying his utmost to run the department more efficiently but he is handicapped by an inadequate and incompetent staff and a force below strength. He has submitted many pro posals for improvements to his headquarters and though they have been much appreciated none of them has been actually sanctioned. The men are now being drilled fairly regularly. The number of guards on the Fahreh-Nusretabad Sipi section of the Kerman-Duzdab road was increased to 18 from 12 late in the year. Sultan Abul Hassan Khan, the former Bais-i-Amnieh, who now works as Muavin to Yawar Azizullah Khan, proceeded on 2 months' leave to Tehran at the end of the year. 10. Local Politics. Xnii-Kajar Movement. —At intervals during the year there was talk of a fresh attempt on the part of Reza Khan to make himself President of a republic, or even Shah ; and the public were constantly being re minded of the unworthiness of the Kajars and the great services of Reza Khan by means of theatrical performances organized by the Officer Commanding and speeches by the Chief Mujtahid of the town Haji Mirza Mohammed Reza (Ayatullah). When the issue was definitely joined in October, these two were the local organizers of the movement, and stage managed the whole performance. There was some excitement and nervousness at the beginning when the ^-Shah's return to Persia was believed to be imminent : it was rumoured that all the troops were going to leave Kerman except those required for guard duties ; and it was arranged that if there was any hint of opposition to Reza Khan on the part of the Majlis, the Kerman should '' sever relations '' with the Capital : Govern ment offices and the bazaars were to be closed and a committee of public safety was to be selected and presided over by Ayatullah to conduct the affairs of the community. Ayatullah—who has always been friendly to this Consulate- kept me fully informed of his plans, and promised that in the event of any dis turbances the protection of .British interests would be one of his chief concerns. Nevertheless I judged it expedient to obtain an assurance from the Officer Commanding that adequate troops would remain in Kerman to preserve order if things went wrong, as it had been freely remoured (and even believed by some officials) that the object of clearing out the troops was to facilitate temporary disturbances and so justify the 0. C. in returning in force, declaring military law, and thus drastically taking command of the situation. Everyone waited anxious- ly for the lead from Tehran. The end came with a suddenness and completeness46 which proved the truth of Walt whitman's saying that ' argument is beggarly before a defiant deed There was general relief when the announcement came that Reza Khan had won, and no little satisfaction that this bloodless revolution had been so competently stage managed. If there was any dissentient opinion, it was not heard. The popular view was that Ahmed Kajar had brought his downfall on himself ; and though at first some apprehension was expressed lest Reza Khan migiit lose some of his prestige if he made himself Shah, all talk of a republic soon died away. And now the very name of Kajar is already almost forgotten in this town where the first of the Kajars won his throne. Press. —Rais-ul-Mutakallimin, a friendly Rouzakhan of moderate views and much more than average intelligence and character, started his weekly paper ' Istaqa'mat ' early in the year. It has appeared regularly ever since. He receives ' Renter's Summary ' from this Consulate and makes unexceptionable use of the news he receives. He is of considerable help to the Consulate in many ways. - • ' Hashimi's paper ^ Bidari ' has made vrey spasmodic appearances. The ' Habl-ul-Matin ' of Calcutta remains the chief foreign paper which circulates in Kerman. Its malicious &lt;m^-British views were less thinly veiled than ever this year : and it does a great deal of harm in its way. Societies. —There are several Societies in Kerman of which one hears very little. The Anjuman-i-Azadi and the Anjuman-i-Ranjbar for instance, exist : but no one precisely knows what they do. The latest arrival seems to be more vigorous : it has the name of Anjuman-i-Tujjar-i-Jawan—or ^ Young Mer chants' Association'. If the young merchants confine their, activities to en couraging the development of trade and communications in the Province in an unpartisan way, they can only do good. But there are signs of an unhealthy pro-Russian bias among their members which may result in its becoming as much political as commercial. This may prove to be merely a disease of infancy : but it needs watching. 11. Russian Activities, (a) Political. —On the whole there has been a marked and welcome diminution in Russian intrigue and interference in local affairs during the year—particularly since the summer. While Nizam-ed-Douleh was Governor General M. Laktionoff did not relax his mischievous activities : he openly supported ' Nauzari ' against the Governor General and when Nizam-ed- Douleh left Kerman not only omitted the courtesy of paying him a farewel visit but boasted that he was responsible for his recall. He had burnt his fingers pretty badly over his support of Nauzari for when he asked Nizam-ed-Douleh to contradict the general report that Nauzari's troubles were -due to his friend ship with the Soviet Consul, His Excellency received a personal telegram from Reza Khan saying that the Government did not permit outsiders to interfere in any internal question and that what people chose to say about it all was no concern of the Persian Government. But nothing dounts M. Laktionoff, and when Vossuq-es-Saltaneh arrived and tried to get rid of Nauzari he was as indefatigable and as careless of publicity as ever. At times he flirted, or tried to flirt, with various communities—Behais, agricultural labourers (Anjuman-i-Ranjbar) whom he vainly persuaded to go on strike against landowners, carpet weavers and designers. He made the most of the Medina incident to encourage reports that the English were at the bottom of it. His neutrality during the anfi-Kajar movement evoked equal surprise and relief : but there are no real signs yet that M. Laktionoff has ' changed his spots It is now known definitely that he communicates with India via Bandar Abbas : and he is endeavouring to establish contact with Persian Baluchistan. His in fluence locally has waned, however, during the year, to a noticeable extent ; and indeed he has been forced into a ridiculous position by his unwillingness to meet myself and the British community at any public or semi-public function. He has been driven to invent one excuse after another to account for his absence at Military displays, receptions in honour of the new dynasty, theatrical entertain ments, even football matches : and though he wrote a courteous letter of regret at Queen Alexandra's death, he excused himself from coming to the Consulate at the semi-official ' visit of mourning '. He has run through most of the minor ailments in the Pharmacopoea by now : and lives a life of more or less complete isolation. (b) Commercial. —M. Laktionoff has been energetic, and levish in promises : but he has not accomplished much in this sphere. The sale of Russian oil was interfered with by the establishment of an A. P. 0. C. sales agency in Kerman which resulted in a steady supply of oil and petrol at fixed prices where there47 bad been most casual and unsatisfactory marketing arrangements before Russian oil comes, too in unwieldy drums ; and the Russian oil agent s practice of decanting this into A. P. 0. C. tins and selling it in tins convenient form has been stopped, after some trouble, by the Persian Government. The sale of Russian oil has therefore dropped materially for the time being. For a time Russian piece-goods—excellent in quality and cheap in piice—- were seen on the market in Kerman : but after the first supply was sold (and it sold at once) transport difficulties prevented further consignments from reaching Kerman ; and he was unable therefore to drive this initial success home. 12. Military Affairs.— Sarhang Mohamed Khan remained in charge of the Kerman troops which were increased in the autumn by the return irom Shiraz of the detachment (6 officers, 358 men) who had gone to Arabistan m che preceding year. He is ambitious, intelligent, and full of energy ; but his severity makes him unpopular with officers as well as men. He is feared by all the civil officials. He is friendly—even at times intimate—with the boviet Consul : but takes care to keep on good terms with His Majesty's Consulate_: and his courtesy in postponing at the eleventh hour a Military display to which he had invited the British community and which had been fixed for the day at'ter the news came of Queen Alexandra's death, was spontaneous and sincerely meant. He is very keen on physical training and efficiency-—with excellent results as that same Military Display proved to a very large gathering of Kermanis who watched the manoeuvres with interest and pride. But military service_ is as unpopular as ever. Officers and men, who are any good, cannot get'their dis charge as Mohamed Khan refuses to entertain such applications ; the pay ot the ranks is many months in arrears ; desertions are ruthlessly dealt with by me imprisonment and whipping of parents, wives and children. The announce ment therefore, of the ratification of the compulsory service law was received with apprehension, though generally speaking the acts of the military are ac cepted with passive resignation. The disarming of the populace was carried out with fair thoroughness ; but the tribes in Rudbar—led by Zargham -es -Saltaneh—successfully resisted the orders, pleading', reasonably enough, that until and unless the Baluch tribes co the East had surrendered their arms they would be exposed to plunder and heavy loss unless they were allowed to retain the power, of self-deience. Theie uie matter rests for the present. In political affairs, the influence of the Officer Commanding is supreme. He • had Vossuq-es -Saltaneh under his thumb to such an extent that he even rorced the latter to make peace with his enemies, the Socialist leaders of Kerman. in the a^i-Kajar movement his word was law. 13. Persian Baluchistan, Jiruft and Rudhar. —The Kerman authorities made spasmodic efforts during the year to get to grips with Dost Mohammed of Bam- pur but the Central Government's policy as regards Persian Baluchistan m general and Bampur in particular is so undecided, and their efforts to deal with the question so lacking in cohesion that it is not difficult for Dost Mohammad evade any issue. In the spring for example the Ministry of the Interior got to hear of trouble in Dashtyari which they attributed to Dost Mohammed's intri gues. The Governor General (Nizam ed-Dauleh) was called on for explanation of the lawlessness going on within his jurisdiction and ordered to make proposals for dealing with Dost Mohammed. As this was the first time the Governor General had been called to any account for the situation in Persian Baluchistan where Dost Mohammed was practicallv independent corresponding direct wit i the Government in Tehran—Nizam-ed-Dauleh first asked for his responsibilities in that region to be defined. (He never got any answer to this question). At the very same time two missions had actually left Kerman for Bampur a militarv and a financial—unbeknown to the Governor General. Dost Mohammed naturally snaps his fingers at a local government which betrays such entire lack of co-ordination. But the practical question raised by Nizam-ed-Dauleh as lo where his iurisdiction over ' Persian Baluchistan ' begins and ends, forced it self into notice again in the early summer when the tribes in the Sarhad rose against the Persian Government. Sarhad is part of Persian Baluciiistaii and therefore nominallv under the Kerman administration. ^- iie com P e e ignorance of these affairs and of the situation there shared by all departmen s of government in Kerman, and the realization that even if they had known tiiey could not have intervened, caused Vossuq-es-Saltaneh to suggest to his govern ment—after discussion of the matter with myself—that as that part oi Persian48 Baluchistan was politically, militarily and geographically as near to the adminis tration of the North as it was remote from Kerman, it was time some realignment of administrative boundaries was made by the Central Government. Nothing came of his suggestion for forming an official Committee in Kerman to discuss the situation ; and there it remains, as a anomalous and unsatisfactory as ever : with the new American Director of Finance trying to get into touch from Kerman with the chieftains in the Sarhad, but lacking any means of making these attempts effective in a region controlled by the army from Meshed. Dost Mohammed meanwhile paid up some revenue in the spring but it remains to be seen what answer he returns to Mr. Fitzsimmons' invitation to pay up more. As regards disarmament, he has been left severaly alone by the Officer Commanding, Ker man. In Eudbar, Zargham-es-Saltaneh, who has no more fight left in him, settled his arrears of revenue with the Provincial Director of Finance (Haji Ezz -ul- Mamalik) who visited Rudbar in the summer with the Officer Commanding, Kerman. Wali Mohammed, Shirdil, though he kept his robbing propensities :n check, strangely enough flouted the financial assistant who was sent to settle with him ; and no notice was taken of him. Both Rudbar and Jiruft remained quiet during the year. H. D. Gr. LAW, I .C.S., His Majesty's Consul, Kerman, Beitish Consulate, Kerman ; ISth February 1926. *49 CHAPTER VII. Administeation repoet of the Mekean' Coast eoe the yeae 1925. Personnel, —Mr. E. E. Guntur, O.B.E., in Political charge of the Mekran Coast, on relief by Mr. T. F.

He returned to Karachi on the £)th December and re sumed charge of his duties on the same date, Mr. Tebbutt holding charge in his absence. Gun running. —38 Magazine rifles, 7 other rifles and 280 rounds of ammuni tion were reported landed on the coast of Persian Baluchistan during the year. Persian Baluchistan. —Mir Mahmud Khan of Dashtyari who left for Bam- pur to see Mir Dost Mohamed and to ask him to settle the differences existing between himself and Mir Din Mohamed died of fever on his way in the early part of January. He left four sons who are controlling his territory. The eldest of them named Mir Durra Khan was recognised chief of the district and paid the subsidy for protecting the telegraph lines passing through his district. Mir Mahmud Khan was a good chief, much liked by his subjects. He acted loyally up to his engagements with the Telegraph Department since his appointment as joint chief of Dashtyari. There has been occasional fighting (described by Mr. Thoy in his report) between the sons of the late Mir Mahmud Khan and their relations on one side and Mir Din Mohamed Khan and his allies on the other ; some loss of life occurred on both sides. Mir Din Mohamed was helped with arms and men by Mir Dost Mohamed Khan of Bampur. On the 14th June a Persian Lieutenant arrived at Charbar from Bunder Abbas and left for Dashtyari on the 10th July, to settle differences between Mir Din Mohamed and the opposing party. He returned to Charbar without effect ing any reconciliation on the 1st August. On the 6th July Mir Dilawar Khan a son of the late Mir Mahmud Khan arrived at Tezkopan ten miles from Charbar with 80 men. Mir Din Mohamed sent his followers to oppose him. Some fighting took place between them. The two chiefs are now at peace. During a fight which occurred at Gwetter in March between Mirs Din Mohamed and Subhan Khan on one side and Mir Jalal Khan on the other and which resulted in the expulsion of Mir Jalal Khan from Gwetter, the goods of two British Indian traders who had fled to Gwadur were looted to the value of several thousand rupees by the followers of Din Mohamed. The question of restoration was under correspondence with this chief when the year closed.

It was reported in the early part of November that the Persian Government had issued orders for the stoppage of payment of custom subsidies. Consequently on the 9th December, Mir Dilawar Khan (brother of Mir Durra Khan of Dashtyari) acting under orders from Mir Din Mohamed occupied the Customs House with some of his followers. He made the Customs Collector prisoner until the balance of 3,900 Krans on account of the subsidy was paid. The Customs Collector had no cash in hand but borrowed the money from a British Indian trader and paid Dilawar Khan. In consequence of the stoppage of the export of cotton mixed with seeds by the Persian Customs, the British Indian traders suffered a great loss of trade. A large quantity of cotton is in the godowns awaiting disposal.

The relations existing between Mir Burkat and Mirza Khan of Rudbar are still very strained, but Mirza Khan appears to have abandoned the idea of attack ing Mir Burkat. Mirza Khan is supposed to have written a letter to Mir Burkat requesting him to pay all taxes. Mir Burkat replied to Mirza Khan that on receipt of orders from Tehran, he is prepared to pay all taxes. Mir Burkat's relations towards us continue to be very friendly.

All the headmen from Lund to Parag carry out the above oraers as Nagdi Khan. On the 18th of May 1925, both wires were cut one mile East of Rapch by Nawab Mir Dost, a Baluchi residing in the Karwan district duration of interrup tion 27 hours. On the 1st July 1925 both wires were again cut in six places 8 miles from Rapch by Nawab Mir Dost who remained on the spot with 20 armed men and threatened to maltreat and burn the houses of lineguards if they attempted to repair lines.

On the 15th June while the line-staft pay was being taken by the lineguards, they were intercepted by Nawab Mir Dost near Rapch who forcibly carried off the bag containing Bs. 103. Nagdi Khan was informed of the theft and was re quested to recover amount otherwise the same would be deducted from his subsidy. On the 11th December 1925 Nagdi Khan paid the Hs. 103 to the Assist ant Superintendent Jask Sub-Division at Jask. Da slit of the Gaih district. ' From Balband to Tez Hills is still administered by Sirdar Husain Khan, who appears to be carrying on his affairs quite satisfactorily.

Sirdars Din Mohamed and Durra Khan are the chiefs of this district. Durra Khan the elder son of the late Sirdar Mahmud Khan who died on the 14th Jan uary 1925 was appointed as tne subsidised, chief. The relations between the two chiefs still continue to be strained. On the 11th June 1925, Dilawar Khan's men shot two of Mir Din Mohamed's men in the Dashtyari district, wounding them badly. When the news was con veyed to Mir Din Mohamed, he said it served his men right for getting into conflict with Dilawar Khan's men m his territory. Mir Din Mohamed was in Dashtyari when the above happened. Mil Ahmed Khan ox Bahu was turned out ot Bahu by Mir Din Mohamed and Mir Subhan on or about the end of March 1925 and his whereabouts at ■ re sent is unknown. Mir Dm Mohamed and Mir Subhan attacked Mir Jalal Khan's fort at v*wetter and turned him out. Mir Jalal Khan with a few followers left for Mir Durra Khan's fort at Talang. Mir Jalal Khan on arriving at fort Talan,^ informed Mir Durra Khan that he was attacked by Mir Din Mohamed and Mir kjiibhan. Mir Dun a Khan informed Mir Jalal Khan that he was going,* to in terview Mir Dost Mohamed at Bampur and asked Mir Jalal Khan to look after ins fort. ^ lv ^ r Subhan was left in charge of the Gwetter fort by Mir Din Mohamed aiier the fight when Mir Jalal Khan abandoned Gwetter fort.

Mir Din Mohamed and Mir Subhan attacked Mir Ahmed Khan and turned him out of the Bahu district about the end of March 1925. Mir Din Mohamed and Mir Subhan have both applied for Mir Ahmed Khan's subsidy. General. On the 2nd October 1925, Jask experienced an abnormal duststorm with a slight shower of rain which lasted for about half an hour. Very little damage was done to the surrounding districts. On the 27th October and December, the Jask district and Rapch had a heavy rain-fall. The other districts only having slight showers, rain is badly needed otherwise famine conditions will continue to prevail. The arms and slave traffic is still on the decrease. The general condition of the country at the time of writing is satisfactory and all the chiefs are friendly disposed towards us.55 CHAPTER VIII.

Another son Sheikh Abdullah, Sardar Sharaf, who was acting Deputy governor of Mohammerah, was appointed Chief of the Mohaisin tribe and Agent ot the Sheikh during ike latter's absence. Most of the Sheikh's seTvants and local headmen left shortly afterwards for Basrah, where they have since resided. .Sheikh Abdullah has now been given a commission in the Persian Army. Attack on Mokammerah by the Sheikh of Mohammerah's adherents.—On the 24th July at about 6-30 p.m ., the town was attacked by a band of about 400 .armed and several .other unarmed Arabs, who came across the desert from the direction of the Sheikh's Palace at Failiyah. The small garrison of about 40 Persian Military under the Officer Commanding Troops was surrounded, but put up a successful defence until reinforcements arrived next morning from Ahwaz and after .severe fighting succeeded in driving out the rebels,. During the time that the Arabs were in possession of the town they looted one of the main bazaars, and carried off grain, foodstuffs and piece-goods valued .lit about Bs. 10,000. ^ B ^ he 29th there were about 300 Persian Troops in Mohammerah, and the a )r ncer Coniinanding Troops then arranged a combined attack by land and water on ajhyah where the Arabs had taken up a position. A strong resistence was otlerea but after s.hort and severe fighting the village and palace were occupied. lie Arab survivors retreated towards 'Iraq and the troops consolidated their position aronnd Mohammerah. The result of casualties were two Indian Clerks of the Anglo-Persian Oil Coy., Ltd., wounded, one of whom died. The Arabs lost about 200 killed and several wounded and the Persian casualties were small During the period of the outbreak the Officer Commanding Troops and the Xarguzar requested H. B. M.'s Vice-Consul to communicate with the authoritios m Iraq to co-operate by preventing Arabs from crossing into 'Iraq territorv I wo or three protests were made against Arabs firing on the Persian Troops from 'Iraq territory which were immediately brought to the notice of the Ad ministrative Inspector at Basrah, who in turn protested against Persian Troops nring into 'Iraq territory. All possible steps were taken to prevent incursion from 'Iraq territorv security was demanded from each section of each tribe that they would not leave Iraq and Arabs were warned against participating in any attack on Persian territory. Tribal fighting was also reported from Falahivah where the Chaab tribe had split up into two factors. The prime cause of the outbreak was the dissatisfaction on the part of/the Ara bs^ over the unwise announcement of the Financial Commission's orders regaraing-taxation which the Arabs considered would dispossess them of their tribal and family rights m the date groves. Separate reports on the revolt *md causes were submitted at the time of occurrence. Abolition of the Kajar Dynasty. —At the beginning of November news was received from Teheran that the Kajar Dynasty had been divested of their rio-ht to the Throne of Persia and that the present Shah had been dethroned. Meetings were organised by the local authorities and telegrams sent to I eheran urging the election of Eeza Khan as Shah. The bazaars and streets were illuminated for three nights. 9' tlle -^tli December official receptions were held by the Karguzar for ^Umzistan and the Military Governor in honour of the accession to the Throne ^ ll p ehlevi. H. B. M.'s Vice-Consul and the heads of British Firms were invited and attended the reception. The whole town was well illuminated as also all craft on the river and there was great rejoicing. Mhcellaneows.—An incident occurred at Abadan on the 17th April when an Indian sweeper Jamadar, Rahim Ali Khan an employee of the Anglo-Persian ,, ' H ' as stahbed m the abdomen by an Arab, Mohammed son of Wahab ersian subject and resulted in his death. Mohammed and a friend Piruz entered the sweeper Jamadar's hovis,e at midnight and were in the act of remov ing hi« hos which contained money when the sweeper Jamadar awoke and LcoSCFD56 s:rapT)led with them. During the fight that ensued Mohammed stabbed die sweeper Jamadar.- The two culprits were arrested and tried by the Kaiguzai in his court. H. B. M.'s Vice-Consul was present at the trial. Mohammed wa^ found guilty and the Karguzar sentenced him to- suffer four year s imprison ment and a fine of one hundred Tomans to be paid to the next-of-kin ot the deceased, or in default further imprisonment for one year making a total ot five vears. Firuz was discharged having already suffered imprisonment for a few months. Another tragic event was the murder of an Anglo-Indian named L. Charles: an employee of the Anglo-Persian Oil Coy., Ltd., at Abadan. This C ei s was strangled by three Arabs and his body thrown into the Bahmanshir river where it was discovered three days later. It appears that Charles went on invitation to the hous ( e of one of the Arabs and after partaking of food tried to take liber ties with one of the three Arabs wives who was- not present. At the moment her husband entered the room and was so infuriated that he with the help of the other two strangled Charles with a rope and. threw his. body inUv the Tivor.. The Persian Police at Abadan did good work in investigating this case. Ihe Arabs are in custody and the case is still pending in the Karguzar s Court. Two unfortunate accidents, occurred at Abadan, which resulted in the death of two Persian labourers. In the first case Mr. Jones a European Refinery employee was driving his motor car when the labourer rushed across the load in front of it and was run over and killed. In the second Mr. Donaldson also a European Refinery employee was riding a motor cycle when a young Persian lad ran across the road and was knocked down and died of injuries received. Both cases, were settled by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company paying com pensation on compassionate grounds to the deceaseds' rrext-of-kin. Post and T el eg raph .'—-T11 e Persian Post Office carried on its work during the tear.- The 'Iraq Telegraph Office attached to the Vice-Consulate carried on its- work to the end of the year when in accordance with Departmental Orders it closed down. The British firms were anxious for an office to be opened on the Miaq side of the Shatt-al-Arab River opposite Mohammerah and a proposal W^as put up by them 7 to the 'Iraq authorities but it was- not sanctioned as it was thought that the handling of messages from Persia would give offence to the Persian Government. The efficiency of the Postal Service has been well maintained under the direction of Mirza Isa Khan Parsa. The new building was completed and occupied at the beginning of the year. Conmunicaiions.—Jn November the Postal Department under the signature of the Provincial Director of Customs notified the ptiblic that the Mohammerah- Khurrumabad-Teheran route was declared open and advised merchants and travellers from Mohammerah to use this route in preference to the two alter native routes, favoured, i.e., Ahwalz and Basrah. A comparison of cost and time occupied was given as follows : Route ; MohammeralK—Tehran. Time. Cost per Kharwar.- Days. Tomans. f Ahwaz-Isfahan 64 64 j F/'a ^ Basrah-Baglidad-Kermansliali 45 70—75' r ^Dkful-Khurramabad «. 34 52 Customs, —Mons. J. Cordonnier was Provincial Director during the year.- The Department worked satisfactorily during the year. The repairs to the Customs Quay sanctioned by the Ministry of Finance,, Teheran, in 1923, have at last been completed. New Customs Posts have been opened at Failiyah (above the Sheikh's, palace), Sabaq on the desert which is about a mile from the town on the Moham- merah-Basrah car route, Bahmanshir,. Shush and Howeizah.59 Nazmieh. —The local Police force continues to work satisfactorily under Sultan Mustafa Khan Elburz the Eais-i-Nazmieh in Khuzistan whose head- (juarters are at Ahwaz. He makes periodical tours of inspection. He is a smart and clever officer who makes it his business to keep on good terms with every body and particularly with this Vice-Consulate. He is keen on his work and keeps his men up to a fair standard of efficiency. Both the Rai-i-Nazmiehs at Mohammerah and Abadan are popular and capable officers and always appear anxious, to work in co-operation with the British Consulate. The town has been fairly free from crime. The Eais-i -Nazmieh of the Province is bent on making several improve ments in the Department but he receives little or no encouragement or support from Teheran and always complains of the Department's Budget allotment being inadequate. Adliyah. —This Department still ceases to exist and most of the petty cases are tried by the Military Governor. Baladiyah. —Agha Karun held the appointment of Rais-al-Baladiyah until the end of January 1925. Several complaints were made to the Military autho rities about his, unsatisfactory work and exactions of money. The Sheikh of Mohammerah even complained against him. He was eventually arrested by- order of the Military Governor General and sent to Ahwaz for imprisonment. Later he was released on security given by his father-in-law and he under took to settle all claims. On the 9th February he fled to Basrah. Before leaving Mohammerah he complained to H. B. M.'s Vice-Consul that he had been ill-treated by the Gov ernor General who had forcibly extracted a Promissory Note from him for Jvrans 70,000. The Karguzar and Military Governor tried hard to persuade him to return to Mohammerah but he declined to do so and sent them messages to the effect that he was prepared to settle all claims provided they were proved in the Basrah Courts, or else he would appoint two Advocates of the Basrah Courts as his Agents and furnish them with a Power of Attorney duly attested before the Notary Public. Agha Karun owns several houses and shops, in the town which have now been taken over by the Persian authorities. Tenants of houses were notified by the Military Governor to withold payment of rents pending instructions from Teheran. Several requests were made to this Vice-Consulate for steps to be taken to force him to return to Mohammerah, but H. B. M.'s Vice-Consul replied that in the matter of extradition application should be made through the proper channel and according to the method laid down in the agreement between 'Iraq and Persia. Agha Yousif ibn Abdi was appointed Rais-al-Baladiyah in place of Agha Karun but he was found thoroughly incompetent and transferred to Abadan where a few months later his services were dispensed with. The Department has since been under the control of the Military Depart ment and is far more satisfactory. Coffee shops and wooden huts on the River Front have been demolished, roads, have been widened and a few bridges built across creeks. The lighting and general sanitation of the town has improved. A proposal for bridging the Karun river and linking up with Abadan was put up to the Persian Government and sanctioned but the work has not been put in hand yet. Other schemes for laying out a public garden, erecting an electric plant and water pumping station have been discussed but there are no signs of any of these to date. The Persian merchants, of Mohammerah in order to facilitate their business formed an_ Association in March named the ' Ittehadeyah Tujjar (Merchants Union) under the chairmanship of Haji Abdul Nabi Behbehani, a wealthy Persian Merchant. Maliyah. —This Department was established in March and carried on its work during the year under Mirza Abdul Hassan Khan. He has an assistant vt Abadan. This Department's first business was to issue notices to the inhabit ants of Mohammerah and Abadan to the effect that all taxes would have to be paid in Persian money and not Indian currency which would not be accepted. A similar notification was issued by the Military Governor warning the public against dealing in rutiees.60 Consular Escort.—Two local Persians are maintained as guards during the day and four Arab Grhulams are maintained as night guaids. British interests.—The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Ltd., made consider able progress during the year. Abadan refinery.— The Construction Programme was carried on without interruption leading to more efficient production and handling ot all grades ot oil. . . The new bench referred to in last year's report was commissioned in February. Fourteen 24 Million Gallon Tanks were brought into use during the year', the total storage capacity is now approximately 1,000,000 tons. Amongst the many items on the Constructional Programme is one for recovering and u i iz- iiio- gas. Further improvements in the packed Oil Department have been carried out and a new and improved container will shortly be put on the mai ve^. The local market for fuel oil and bulk kerosene has been catered for y impiov ed depots and the provision of further depots is under consideration. The construction of bungalow accommodation for the European Staff has been carried on and the European Staff at the end of the year numbered 396. Clerks and Artizans, quarters have been constructed and 2,425 clerical and artizan employees are accommodated in modern and sanitary cjuar ers. The total number of employees of other nationalities at the end of vear was 12,811. The Company has given particular attention to public hcaiiii and in addition to other provision of quarters for skilled employees, suitable quarantine stations have been prepared. A campaign for the extermination of rats has been carried through with excellent results. Assistance has been given to the local authorities in matters connected witn the sanitation of the village and the work of providing pure drinking water .o the village is in hand. At Mohammerah the Company's Head Office has continued its work through out the year. Imperial Bank of Persia.— The Bank carried on its business during the year. Mr. W. N. Cuthbert, was Manager until the 21st November, when he pro ceeded on leave and was relieved by Mr. H. G. Couser from Ahwaz. Air Bulfield and Mr. Barry were Accountants for a few months during the vear and were transferred to Ahwaz and Masjid -i-Sulaiman respectively. Mr. Fuzzy arrived at Mohammerah in November and is, the present Accountant. The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Ltd. —Mr. L. S. Parsons was Deputy Manager of this Firm throughout the year. The African and Eastern Trade Corporation,, Ltd. This Firm with offices Basrah and Baghdad opened a branch m Mohammerah m November. Tae office is in the town and at present under the charge of a Jew named Saleh I ougi Saleh. The Firm deal in general merchandise and are Export Merchants, and has recently taken over the Agency ot the Hansa line of steamers. ^ r. i n ^ Quarantine and Health.— Surgeon C. H Lincoln, 0 ^; E - appointment of Qurantine Medical Officer Dispensary in the town continued to be well attended. About 3,80U outdoo patients were treated during the year. Nine case of small-pox occurred during the year. C. H. LINCOLN, H. B. M.'s Ag. Vice-ConsulCHAPTKE IX. Administeation Bepoet or H. B. M.'s Consulate fob Khuzistan for the year 1925. Personnel. —Mr. E. G. B. Peel, C.I.E. continued to hold the post of Consul till the 8th April 1925, when he proceeded on leave and was succeeded by Mr. E. D. Gr. Monypenny of the Levant Consular Service. Except for a month's absence on leave Captain C. C. L. Ryan continued to hold the post of Vice-Consul throughout the year. Adwinistration. —On the relief of Mr. Peel by Mr. Monypenny the Consulate was transferred from the Government of India to H. M.'s Foreign Office, London. The Vice-Consulate was, however, §till maintained throughout the year on the Government of India establishment. Local Government. —Sartip Pazlullah Khan was Military Governor General till May 4th, when he was recalled to Tehran and the Civil Deputy Governor Mirza Ahmad Khan Amarlu, a nominee of Sharif-ud-Dauleh, at that time Gov ernor General' of Luristan and Khuzistan, became acting Governor till his depar ture for Tehran on December 1st as a Deputy for Behbehan in the Constituent Assembly. At the end of the year he had not returned, nor had any one been appointed in his place. The Officer Commanding the troops in Khuzistan was acting as Governor in conjunction with Afgham-es-Sultan, who had been Mirza Ahmed Khan's assistant. Mr. H. Homan, one of Dr. Millspaugh's staff of American advisers, arrived in November and toot over charge of the post of provincial Director of Finance from Muffakham-es-Saltaneh, the Pishkar-i-Malieh. The latter is now working as Mr. Homan's assistant. The head quarters of the Adliyeh was transferred to Ahwaz from Shustar in December.' A local branch had been previously opened, but had been removed by the Military Governor. The Adliyeh now, however, appears to be established as a permanent institution, much to the chagrin of the Military authorities. On the departure of General Fazlullan Khan, the province was divided into two areas for the purposes of Military administration. The troops at Dizful and Shustar were incorporated in the Western Command, while the troops further to the South and the East remained in the Southern Army. SJmiMi of Mohammerah. —The year 1925 has been mainly remarkable for the final elimination of the Shaikh of Mohammerah and the consolidation by the Persian Government of their authority over the Province. At the beginning of the year the Shaikh of Mohammerah, though effectively shorn of his former pres tige and authority was still hoping for the fulfilment of the Prime Minister's pro mise that troops would be withdrawn and the Shaikh restored to power in the spring. This hope, however, was soon extinguished, and the Shaikh was reduced to a state of despair by the gradual encroachment of the Persian authorities on his private properties and the constant humiliation to which in various forms he was subjected. He had thus come to believe that the Prime Minister had'no in tention of taking any steps at all either to rehabilitate him or even to make any arrangement regarding his lands, such as would enable him at least to feel secure in the position of a more landowner, and leave him free to travel abroad. It was in this frame of mind that Mr. Monypenny found him on his arrival from Tehran with a special message _froi% the Prime Minister, to the effect that the Shaikh should either gratify his desire to travel by mkaing Tehran his first goal, or should send a suitable representative there with full authority to deal with the question of his properties, his ownership of which His Highness assured him he would do his utmost to regularise and confirm. The Shaikh, however, was unable to overcome his suspicion of the Prime Minister and refused to go to Tehran, notwithstanding the assurances of H. M. Minister as to* the sincerity of the Prime Minister's attitude and his general anxiety to put the question of the tenancy of the Shaikh's lands on a proper basis. While these negotiations were still in progress, in fact on the evening of the same day on which the Shaikh had intimated to H. M. Consul his inability to go to Tehran, His Excellency was arrested by the Governor-General, Sartip Fazlullah Khan r on his own ship the 61 Le586PD62 / ' IVY ' at Failiyeh, whither the Shaikh had come that day from Basrah to meet H. M. Consul. He was sent nnder escort to Dizful together with his son, Shaikh Abdul Hamid, and thence by the Khorremabad road to Tehran. His Excellency was still detained in Tehran at the end of the year. Apart from a purely local disturbance at the Failiyeh palace, which was suppressed by one of the Shaikh's sons, the Shaikh's arrest and forcible remov al were received 1 with apparent indifference, and it was not till three months later that the cumulative effect of further causes caused Arab resentment against the new regime to chrystallise into an outbreak at Mohammerah, where on the 24th July 1925 the garrison was surrounded and the town occupied and looted by a party of 400 armed Arabs. The insurgents were driven out by Persian troops the next day, but not before it had been necessary to ask for military assistance from Iraq. One British subject was unfortunately killed. This rising was undoubtedly part of a larger disturbance that was arranged to take place on a more extensive scale a little later on, and it was fortunate that the Muhaisin made this premature move, before the other tribes were ready to join in, thus 'enabling the Military to deal with them separately and inflict a defeat, which served as a salutary lesson to the remainder. Since the Shaikh's removal to Tehran, he has had no agent in this Province and the question of his title to his lands is still undecided. Bakhtiari. —Sirdars Zaffar and Jang have remained Hlkhani and Illbegi respectively throughout the year. Sirdar Zaffar proceeded to Europe for his health in July and returned at the end of the year. Sirdar Muazzim acted for him during his absence. In July a representative of the Persian Govermnent, Sultan Mirza Hussain Khan Mushiri who had been deputed with a force of some 50 men for this pur pose began the work of disarming the tribesmen. He was still engaged in this occupation at the end of the year. The Anglo Persian Oil Company, Limited. —The Fields Manager writes as follows :— ' Considerable progress has been made in improving areas outside the main Field and a number of new wells have been brought in. Pro duction and through put during the past year has been maintained at approximate the same rate as during the previous year. Exten sions are now being made to our pipe lines and pumping stations. The following additional accommodation has been completed during the year. 20 Bungalows, 3 Blocks—clerks' quarters. Considerable extensions and improvements have also been made to the Hospital. The general health of employees and population of the area continues good and no epidemics have been experienced ; this is undoubtedly due to the energy displayed by our Medical staff. There were no European deaths during the year. The Company continues its policy of replacing Indian labour as far as possible by local labour. During the year, 164 local apprentices were passed out as artizans and 528 apprentices are undergoing training at the present time. The number of Indian artizans employ ed at the present time is 532 which shows- a decrease of 91 on the year. The Railway from Dar-I-Khazinah to Fields has carried an average monthly tonnage of 2,827 tons. The scheme for pumping water from Godar Landor is nearing completion.' 7 Foreign Interests. —M. Batmanoff has continued to hold the post of Sovyet Consul throughout the year. The circumstances of the new regime have, how ever, provided him with comparatively little scope for the exercise of his faculty for intrigue. Early in the year a reaction began to set in, with the gradual realisa tion that his activities in this Province were directed solely towards the creation of trouble ; and with the establishment of effective Military control the tendency on the part of the officers to cultivate friendly relations with him became less marked than during the early stages of the Military occupation.63 His activities during the year seem to have been mainly directed towards attempting to collect information concerning the operations of the Anglo Persian Oil Company Limited for which purpose he avails himself of the services of the members of the disreputable element that rallies round him. It is a matter for satisfaction that he is engaged in such a comparatively innocuous occupa tion, to the exclusion of more sinister activities. The French archaeological mission continued its operations at Shush from Januray to March 1925. Lynch Road. —The average rate of mule hire from Ahwaz to Isfahan was krans 8.02 per shah maund (13 lbs.) as against 7.80 in 1924 and 9.50 in 1923. The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited forwarded 2,176 cwt. in 1925, compared with 2,947 cwt. in 1924 and 2,031 in 1923, Khorrermhad Road. —The Dizful-Khorremabad road was opened to traffic in June 1925. It is not yet possible to say to what extent this route will prove a rival to the Lynch road, as th'e security of the route was short-lived, the road being closed again in October owing to the unsettled state of the country. At the end of the year the road was still closed. During the short time that it was open, however, the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Limited forwarded 288 cwt. of goods from Ahwaz. The average rate of mule hire from Ahwaz to' Tehran was krans 9.58 per shah maund. Unfortunately one of the Corpora tions' caravans carrying goods to the value of about £3,000 was looted in Octo ber, 233 out of a total of 249 packages being robbed by marauding Lurs. To date only 30 packages have been recovered. ILLEGIBLE, Captain, for H. B. M.'s Consul for Khuzistan*CHAPTER X.. Administration Repoet or the Political Agency Muscat foe the yeae 1925. Personnel. —Lieut.-Colonel C. G. Crosthwaite, C.B.E., held charge of the Political Agencv and Consulate from 1st January to 23rd May 1925 when he proceeded to Bushire to officiate as Political Resident, handing over charge to Captain R. Gr. E. W. Alban, I.A. of the 7th Gurkha Rifles. Captain Alban held charge of the Agency and Consulate from 24th May to 7th October when he was relieved by Lieut.-Colonel C. Gr. Crosthwaite. Cap tain Alban returned to his Regiment and Colonel Crosthwaite remained in charge of the Agency and Consulate till the end of the year. Lieut. J. N. Madan, I.M.S. (T.C.), Military Medical Officer, officiated as Agency Surgeon, Muscat, from 1st January to 3rd May when he proceeded on 2 months' leave. He returned from leave on the 4th July and continued to officiate as Agency Surgeon till the end of the year. Mr. M. A. Fernandez, M.B.E., held the post of the Superintendent and Treasury Officer throughout the year. Foreign Consulates. —The French Consulate remained closed throughout the year. A watchman is still employed at the Consulate building. The Poli tical Agent and H. B. M.'s Consul remains in charge of American interests. Ruling Family.—Ris Highness the Sultan spent only just over three months in Muscat during the year under report. ,He left in H. M. S. ' Triad' for Dhofar on the 8th April and remained there for the rest of the year. He is build- ing a residence for himself at that place and seems to spend most of his time ridino- and shooting. He appears to be much attached to Dhofar, and since his Turkish wife and his infant son have gone to Cairo he has given up his house at Dehra Dun. It is not likely that he will resume his practice of summering iu India. His Highness''s eldest son, Saiyid Saeed, is still at Ajmere College where he seems to be very happy and is well reported upon by the College authorities. He spends his holidays at Muscat except for the brief vacation during the mon soon, when he went to Bombay with his tutor. During the last winter holidays His Highness the Sultan sent Saiyid Saeed on a tour through Muscat territory as far north as Sohar. _ The expenses of the tour, which were not inconsiderable, were defrayed by His Highness from his privy purse. The tour was most successful. Saiyid Hamad bin Faisal, the Sultan's half-brother, who is Wali at Sohar, is most unpopular with the neighbouring tribes owing to his exactions. The tribe mostly concerned is the Beni Kaab, a powerful tribe, and rebellion is openly discussed. His Highness the Sultan is aware of this feeling, but hesitates to take any action against his brother. Saiyid Hamad is a very pleasant person to meet. He is well educated in Arabic literature, and keeps an excellent table with Goan servants. He went to India for a month in November, chiefly for purposes of medical treatment, and visited Karachi, Poona and Bombay. u An incident, very derogatory to the Ruling Family, took place early during the year under report. Two of His Highness' first cousins, Saiyid Muhammad bin Saiyid Muhammad bin Turki and his brother Khalid had gone to the Trucial Coast on a round of visits, chiefly with the purpose of enjoying free hospitality. On their way back they were seized by some Bedouin On the ground that they were runaway slaves. On their protesting that they were cousins of the Sultai? of Muscat the Bedouin severely beat them for their presumption as they were in looks palpably negroid. The Bedouin sold them for Rs. 820 and Rs. 850 respectively. The Shaikh ■of Yunqul heard of their plight and money was advanced from the Muscat State Treasury to ransom them. His Highness was much annoyed at the incident, but Remarked in Durbar that even Joseph was sold in slavery by his brethren and that such accidents therefore occurred even in the best families. m65 Council of Ministers. —There has been no change in the personnel of the Council of Ministers and the general administration on their part has proceeded .amoothly. The Wali of Mattra, Saiyid Muhammad bin Ahmad, who used to be the Financial Minister has handed over charge of all financial matters to Mr. B. S. Thomas^ O.B.E. the new Financial Adviser, and is without a portfolio. He bears no resentment, and is probably pleased at being relieved of these duties as he is illiterate. He is however of great value on the Council as he has much experience, and his opinion is always worth hearing. Saiyid Nadir, half brother of His Highness, is President of the Council. •General report has it that he is on bad terms with His Highness and jealous of Saiyid Saeed, His Highness's eldest son. This may be the case, but such jealousy does not appear much on the surface. A certain amount of intrigue is always liable to exist. Finance. —During the year under report Mr. B. S. Thomas, O.B.E., joined the State service as Financial Adviser. He has acted with the greatest tact and has undoubtedly done exceedingly well; he appears to be generally much liked and respected by all with whom he is brought into contact. His chief difficulties lie in the demands made on the treasury by the junior members of the Ruling Family on account of their allow ances. The more important members of the Family were also accustomed to borrow money from the State with little or no intention to repay. They also spent large sums every year, ostensibly on repairing their State residences, but more frequently transferring such sums to their own pockets. It has been by no means an easy task to stop such ancient practices, especially when the ladies of the household are concerned. The finances of the State are, though admittedly exiguous, more than sol vent, and Mr. Thomas has been able this year to arrange for the purchase of a steamer for the State. This will enable officials to visit the subsidiary Customs Houses at the smaller ports, and it is not unreasonable to hope that the Customs receipts will be largely increased. Mr. Bower of the Imperial Customs Service was at Muscat on deputation during the year under report and left in April. He has put the management of the Customs office on good lines. It is highly satisfactory to report that he found no grave abuses, and this reflects credit on Iskander Effendi, the Egyptian Direc tor General of Customs, who had been in charge for some time before his arrival. Iskander Effendi has continued to do his duties most satisfactorily, and he com mands the confidence of all traders and business men. Separate reports on the financial position of the State are submitted half yearly, and it is unnecessary to go into details of the financial administration in this report. It will suffice to state that a balance of over one lakh of rupees is anticipated at the end of the present financial year—1st January 1927. An Oil Concession was granted by His Highness the Sultan to the D'Arcy Exploration Company, a Company working in conjunction with the Anglo-Per- siau Oil Company, the final signatures being affixed in May. The Company have lost no time m commencing work, and two geologists Messrs. Lees and Gray arnved at Muscat m November and have already spent two months in surveyina' tlie -batma Coast and as far into the hinterland as circumstances permitted. ^ Ln] Pi aikl i ISa bln Sa . 1 1 eh .? f Ka ^ il \ n the S}lar qhiya district of Oman was not iielprul and consequently the geologists were unable to Visit the vicinity of the moimUim, Jabal Akhdar. Captain G. J. Eccles, Commanding the Muscat In- sts ' ? nd . 11 was la ^ly through his tactful hand- h i ot the Arab Shaikhs that the geologists' journey was so successful as regards the extent of the area explored. It is understood that no oil was found in those paits which were visited but further exploration is to be made at Dhofar and in the tei i itones south of Muscat if the local Arabs are found to be amenable.

A ffmrs in Omo«.—During last hot weather the Amir of Hasa,_ who is a Dcdti I v Governor of Ibn Sand, sent a representative to the Barauni tract in Onum TWs representative collected ' Zakat ' a Government tax from certain villages on behalf of Ibn Sand. Eventually he found public feeling antagonistieal and he left the hinterland of the Trucial coast and returned to Hasa. This visit appears to have aroused the fears of the Trucial Coast cMrfs ot Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and the latter Shaikh sent two of ^pnews to Iva^. in Sharqiyah (south of Muscat) to get m touch with Isa bin galeh, the most m- HuGiitial Shaikh of the iViuscat hinteiland. The danger threatening Oman from Ibn Sand was discussed, and fbere is little doubt that Sulaiman el Banmi, the Tripoli agitator, who was spending U e hot weather with Isa bin Saleh, took a leading part m the deliberations. This Sulaiman el Baruni has given both the French and the Italians a great deal of trouble in past years, and was in fact detained as a political detenu by the French in Paris until about 18 months ago. As he was not permitted by either of these Governments to go back to any place on the Mediterranean seaboard of Africa he came to Arabia, visited Mecca, and then came on to Mascat. * . ,. 1 t . He is religious leader of the Ibadbi persuasion, which sect is strongest in Oman. During his stay at Muscat His Highness decorated him with trie Oidei of Sayidiya. _ . n x ^ -n The result of the deliberations was that it was decided to weld together ine Omani* tribes against Ibn Sand and to force those tribes suspected of Wahabi leanings, and therefore of friendliness to Ibn Sand, to comply with the wishes ot the majority of the Oman tribes. Accordingly in November Isa bin Saleh in conjunctkm with the Imam of Oman, who is in reality a mere figurehead and a puppet in the hands of Isa bin Sal eh,' collected their forces and marched northwards into the district or Oman known as the Dhahira. There are two main political factions in Oman, the Hinawi and the GhafirL and the Ghafiri tribesmen were suspected of leanings towards Ibn Sand. Isa bin Saleh's section is Hinawi. Before he set out on his march Isa bin Saleh succeeded in attaching to him- -self a powerful young Shaikh of the Ghafiri faction, one Sulaiman bin Hamyai, whose territory lies around Jabal Akhdar. All went well for some w T eeks with Isa bin Saleh's plans, and several places in the Dhahira acknowledged the supremacy of the Imam, or, in other words, of Isa bin Saleh,67 Leading Shaikhs, such as the Shaikh of Yunkul and of the A1 Nairn tribe of 1 )hank and south of Baraimi were summoned to meet him and piepaied to pay their respects. An important Shaikh,- the Shaikh of Tbri, surrendered his town and fort at the persuasion of his fellow Grhafiri Shaikh, Shaikh Salaiman bin Hamyai. '! }i(. latter promised that the surrender should be nominal and only for four days, when the fort and town would be handed back. As this was not done on the fixed period expiring, the Shaikh of Ibrl up braided Sulaiman bin Hamyar. The latter went to Isa bin Saleh and demanded thai he should keep his promise and hand back the fort. A quarrel ensued and Shaikh Sulaiman left Isa bin Saleh^ taking away his fighting' men with him. This defection had an instantaneous effect on Tsa bin Saleh s schemes, 'which immediately collapsed. He was forced to beat a hasty retreat back to Kabil in Sharqiyah, and the Ghafiri Shaikhs who were on their way to submit to him. Immediately returned to their homes. It is quite clear that if Ibn Sand wishes to invade Oman there is no one wk&gt; could make any stand against him. It is generally believed that Ibn Sand is pro-British, or rather that the British support Ibn Saud. Hence Sulaiman el Baruni's intrigues in this matter as he always takes the side of the anti-Europeans, El Baruni has been corresponding with Egyptian newspapers regularly since his entering the hinterland, and the burden of his reports is to the effect that the British Government, Ibn Saud, and His Highness the Sultan of Muscat havo made a secret treaty by which Ibn Saud gets the hinterland of Oman, while the British take the port of Dubai. It is not quite clear what His Highness the Sultan of Muscat is to get out of this secret pact. Arms Traffic. —No arms were imported into Muscat during the year under report and if any arms are imported into Oman it is by land routes. The geo logists of the Anglo -Persian Oil Company report that the Arabs in the interior were well armed with small bore rifles. Slave Trade.—B. unaway slaves from the Oman coast have frequently sought protection at this Agency. 31 slaves applied for freedom of whom 29 were manumitted after investigation of their cases. Two cases remained pending at the end of the year. Registration of British Subjects and their interests. —British subjects ^ and British protected persons have with few exceptions regularly registered them selves at this Agency. During the year under report 267 British subjects and 420 British protected persons were registered. Owing to the scarcity of ram for the last 7 or 8 years the interior of Oman has suffered seriously. Many date -roves have simply dried up for want of water and villages been deserted.^ The absence of rain in Oman has greatly contributed to the geneial depiession ot trade in Muscat. British subjects, who previously handled 95 per cent, ot the trade in Muscat, are leaving Muscat and returning to India. The fall in the prices of dates has been phenomenal this year. The aver age price of wet ' dates in 1924*was Us. 140 per Bahar'', i.e. 1800 lbs., while this vear it fell to only Rs. 75. The reasons for this drop were the very bad peariins- season and that there was no demand for dates at Dubai as in pre vious years. The price of a dollar veried from Bs. 159 to Es. 189 per $100 according to the silver market and local demands. The average price per 100 dollars was:-— January February March April May June 185 July ,, 168.7 181 August ,, 171.5 181 September .., 168.5 181.5 October ,. 167.8 183.7 November ,. 171.5 168.5 December ., 181• 68 Muscat Infantry. —Captain Gr. J. Eccles of the l|4t}i Bombay Grenadiers was in Command of the Muscat Infantry throughout the year. Captain Eccles' depu tation with the Muscat Infantry has been extended by a further period of one year till July 1926, The corps is efficient and is getting a good class of Mekran Baluchi. Saiyid Salim uin Faisal, His Highness's half-brother, resigned his commission as Sabedar owing to ill-health. Captain Eccles reported that his departure was fell by all ranks, as his expert knowledge of local conditions was a great help to the Corps. Visits of Officials. —The Hon'ble Lieut.-Colonel F, B. Prideaux, C.S.T., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, visited Muscat in January in P. I. M. S. 'Lawrence Mr. E. E. Gunter, O.B.E., Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, visited Muscat in the 1. G. T. S. ' Patrick Stewart ' in April. His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Squadron visited Muscat on the 6th December in the Flagship H. M.'S. ' Effingham ' and returned to Colombo on the 7th. Military officers of the Regiment -stationed in the Persian Gulf have visited Muscat on various occasions. The Persian Gulf and the East Indies Squadron following ships of the Persian Gulf Squadron visited Muscat during the year:— H. M. S. ' Crocus ' 12th January, 4th December. H. M. S. ' Triad '■ 23rd January, 20th November. it. M. S. ' Cyclamen ' 16th April, 4th November. H. M. S. 'Lupin' 10th November, 4th December. Missionary Enterprise in Muscat. —Dr. (Miss) Hosman proceeded on leave to America. Miss Lutton and Rev. Van Peursem and his family remained in Muscat except for the summer vacation which they spent in India. The Mission does not make headway, and as no school is maintained it is difficult to understand why the American Mission retain a clergyman here. Climate. —The total rainfall for the year amounted to 2.20 inches as against 1.04 inches of the previous year. The greater portion of the rain fell in October and the drinking water supply which had become brackish and bitter has greatly improved. The summer was on the whole mild as compared to the summer of the pre vious year. The absence of an electric installation in Muscat is greatly felt. The Government of India were prepared to instal electric plant but the neces sary charges were more than this Agency could afford to pay. It is hoped that some joint scheme by which the charges can be borne between the Muscat State and this Agency will be submitted for consideration in the near future. C. G.

Administration Report on the Trucial Coast of Oman for the year 1925. 1 Personnel. —Khan Bahadnr Isa bin Abdul Latif was Residency Agent throngliout the year Slave Trade. —During the year nine Negro slaves were manumitted, of whom no less than seven were owned by Arabs of Qatar and escaped from tbe boats in which they were employed. The other two were new importations into the Triicial Coast. Fourteen Baluchis, kidnapped from the Mekran Coast, Were also liberated. Pearl Fshery. —The Pearl Fishery was not good in 1925. In 1924 the market in Bombay was poor ; consequently fewer boats were fitted out, and the catch was also poor. A slight improvement Was noticed in the Bombay market at the end of 1925. Relations ivith Nejd. —Indications have not been wanting during the year that Ibn Sa'ud has been turning his attention towards the Trucial Coast of Oman. His agents have appeared in the Baraimi Oasis, part of which belongs to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, and have levied sakat and interfered in local affairs. Communications passed consequently (1) between the Naimi Shaikhs of Baraimi and the Trucial Chiefs with ^ro-Wahhabi sympathies, (2) between the two Maliki Chiefs of the Coast (Dibai and Abu Dhabi), and Isa bin Saleh, the Ibadhi leader in the Sultanate of Oman, who are definitely anil Ibn Sa'ud, and (3) between the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi representing (2) and a Naimi and the Chief of Umm-al-Qaiwain representing (1). An effort made by the Ibadhi Imam and Shaikhs of the Muscat hinterland later in the year to extinguish the proAXahhabi element in Yanqul, Dhank, Ibri and Baraimi ended in failure owing to a quarrel breaking out between the Hinavi and Ghafiri leaders of the Omanis. Shargah. —The err-Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad has settled down, temporarily at least, in Ras al Khaimah, and has not been the cause of any disturbances during the year. His successor. Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar, has not shaped as well as was hoped, being evidently under the influence of his father-in-law, Shaikh Abdur Rahman bin Muhammad bu Shamis, the headman of Hairah. On the 15th October 1925 an attempt was made to murder the Residency Agent at Shargah, and his cousin, Ibrahim bin Rajab was actually killed in his stead. The Shargah authorities acted extremely apathetically in the matter and made, no attempt to arrest any one. As the result of investigations made by the Resident's Secretary and the Resident himself, it was recommended to the Government of India that Shaikh Abdur Rahman, who Commanded the Chief's armed retainers, should be made the scape-goat and be deported from the Persian Gulf for four years. It is, indeed, very widely believed that this man, who was intolerant of the Residency Agent's' attempts to influence the Chief, is the actual instigator of the crime. It was further proposed that the young Shaikh should be fined and also made to pay blood-money to the deceased's family. The orders of the Government had not been received at the end of the year. At the beginning of the year, the headman of Fujairah, Hamad bin Abdallan, who bad been in open insurrection against Shargah for the past twenty- lour years adopted a defiant attitude in the case of a Baluch girl who had been iadnapped in Muscat and sold to him. When the Resident visited Fuiairah U ¥ 1 re f 1 US 0 e 1 d C0I ?

The latter arrived first, captured Humaid, and took him and his followers to Umm-al-Qaiwain. Messrs. Frank C. Strick &amp; Co. have intimated that they see little chance of exporting any further quantity of red-oxide from Abu Musa at present, as the quality has proved to be very inferior. In the meantime the Persian Gov ernment have laid claim to the island, but they have been informed that His Majesty's Government cannot recognise such a claim. Dibai. —All has been quiet in Dibai during the year, and there have been few or no complaints from the Bannias against the Shaikh since the Political Resident's visit in April 1925. On the 5th October a German Steamer of the Hansa Line visited Dibai, the first German steamer to call since the War. The Shaikh refused permission for cargo to be landed, and has subsequently main tained his position that he does not wish an agency for German boats to be established in Dibai. Abu Dhabi —The desultory skirmishing with the Bedouin tribes of the interior has continued, and two of the Oman tribes living round the Baraimi oasis, the Awamir and the Darn, are reported to have placed themselves under the aegis of the Wahhabi Governor (Amir) of Hasa. This has naturally led to bad feeling between the Shaikh, Sultan bin Zaid, and Abdallah bin Jiluwi, 4 1^ a ,— * 7 7 In December, peace between the Shaikh and the Bani Ivatab was also arranged by the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain and the headman of Hamriyeh, all claims for blood-money on both sides being dropped. , The Shaikh seems to have turned over a new leaf recently as old claims ot the Bannias and Haiderabadi Indians have nearly all been settled, and few iresh ones have been presented.

November 24th to December 31st by Major C. It. Daly., C.I.E. The Ruler of Bahrain and Al Khalifah family. —ghaik Sir '1st bin 'Ali has continued his attitude of passive resistance to the rule of Shaikh Hamad bin 'Isa but he displays little real interest in affairs and the death of Abdul Wahab Zaiyam, who had constituted himself Sbaik 'Isa's agent in Boltnbay having removed his principal agitator it is unlikely that he will find any one desirous of further pursuing his claim to be re-installed as the executive Ruler, ihe venerable Shaik appears now resigned to his lot and is in fact more con tented than when he had the cares of his state, which had manifestly become too great a burden for him in the latter years of his rulersbip. He still however stubboinly declines to accept any allowance from the state revenues, but is really amply provided for by the rents he enjoys from state lands still in his possession. He has one wife only, and most of his retinue draw allowances trom the state so that his personal expenditure is small. The attitude of the cn l( - 1 | ^ ^ ^ le Ruling family towards the new regime introduced bv ,, Ha ? nad 1 lias considerably changed for the better, and with the exception oi one or two hotheads among the junior members of the family, they are coming 0 Ioa lf e the improvements resulting from good government, and to take some little pride in the state. It is unfortunate that their complete lack of education and deplorable distaste for work of any kind renders it impossible lor the Deputy Euler to usefully employ them in the state. He is now slowly realising the increasing difficulties which will confront the state with the multi- p J ymg ruling family quite unequipped to earn a living, all of whom expect to be mam tamed, m complete idleness, from state funds. Shaik Hamad bin'Isa is genuinely desirous of improving his state and of governing well but he has no realisation of the value of money, and in the absence of careful advice and control would reduce the state to bankruptcy in a short time prosperous though it is, Even in regard to his private affairs 3 . s lma ; 3le t ? make 1 his expenditure bear any relation to his income and ex- punence Has shown that no matter what funds he has from the state revenues as his private income, he squanders all, and his position is in no way improved' He is not personally unduly extravagant, but allows himself to be fleeced by umei o us parasites, whose demands he appears unable to refuse. It is there- e inevitable that he will always plead poverty. If the state is to continue ou a soimd financial footing, the limit set to allowances from state funds to the inung famdy—which are very generous—must in the future be rigidly adhered to. Tins point will constantly arise and will need careful watching 1 ;' Sh ? ik ^ am iv a r d bin n ' T f a ' wi , th his br other Shaik Abdulla, paid a short visit MaSXeKW 7 The^t ^ being received -dience by J-aj -sty me ilmg.

In either case he can get little redress as the tenant is usually penniless. A possible solution of this difficulty would be that the Shaikhs should hire labour, supervise their own gardens and realise the proceeds thereof, as is done in Iraq. This, however, would entail a medium of activity and trouble for the owner, which no member of A1 Khalifah (who are incredibly lazy) would be prepared to take. Another, and probably the only feasible remedy would be for an expert assessment to be made of the annual rental values of the gardens and the maximum rent chargeable to be determined by the State by a system analogous to that in force in Iraq (on Tapu Estate) for the assess ment of revenue. It would be possible to greatly extend the date cultivation on the existing supply of water, with state supervision to prevent waste, and to provide for equal distribution. Bahrein State. —Improvements in the internal administration continue, and the relations between this Agency and Shaikh Hamad bin 'Isa have been most cordial. Although Shaikh Sir 'Isa bin 'Ali can scarcely be expected to appre ciate the rule of his son, or the Agency's support of the latter, his personal rela tions with the Agency have been quite friendly. In the diving industry the improvements initiated, and mentioned in the annual report for 1924, have been persevered with, and considerable progress has been made. There can now be no doubt that these improvements are on a right basis, and that the benefits derived therefrom are already being felt. One of the chief difficulties, in initiating the simple system of accounting, was the lack of clerks capable, of keeping the accounts in an intelligible manner. The local (xovernment therefore secured the services of a good Indian clerk with a knowledge of Arabic, and for a time subsidised a number of local clerks to undergo a course of training. On their passing an examination they were permitted to write up the accounts of any of the Nakhudas who desired their services, at a charge regulated by the State. I he majority of the Nakbudas took advantage of this convenience. There has been a marked improvement in the earnings of the divers since the intro duction of the accounting system briefly outlined in the annual report for 1924, notwithstanding that the pearling season of the year under report, was decidedly below the average. the boring of aitesian wells was undertaken with a view to securing a water supply tor the towns of Manameh and Mubarraq, and two experimental wells were sunk, one in each town. The Manameh well produced a plentiful supply of water, slightly brackish at first, but which has since greatly improved. The Muharraq well was a very marked success, it produces a good supply of perfectly sweet water. At the close of the year negotiations were in progress for the sinking of further wells in bom towns. A fine sbed was purchased in England for the Customs Department and Lis been elected on the landing jetty. This supplies a necessity for which the mei chants had for many years petitioned Shaik 'Isa without result. A trolley system has been installed connecting the import shed on the customs ietf' with the mam Customs Import sheds and is working satisfactorily. It enables the case. ^ eXpedltlousl y cleared from the jetty than was formerly rm rrhe Mmicipaiity of Manameh has continued to do much nspfnl wnrb visirL^beenma^ln ^ duly T^leted ^d'pr«- end of the Town in 1926.

The state Land Registry Office has, however, continued to operate succcssfulv and a con siderable number of complicated land disputes have been satisfactorily disposed . The elementary school which was started some years ago by Shaik 'Abdulla bm 'Isa and which is subsidised but not supervised by the State has lost much of its value through inefficient management and peculation. The Deputv Ruler is gradually accumulating an Education Fund, and when sufficient capital is available he proposes to take over the management of this school, which is situated in Muharraq, and to start a similar school in Manameh. In this con- nection he has asked whether it might be possible, when the time comes, for an officer of the Iraq Educational Department, who would have practical experience &lt; f the requirements of schools for Arabs, to be deputed for a short time to start &lt;the schools and advise how they should be continued and supervised. The chief difficulty will undoubtedly be that of securing the services of : siulable schoolmasters none existing in Bahrain. The masters who have ^^ el ?| p , e - MllhaTra &lt;J sch ool have been mainly Egyptians engaged by Shaik Abdulla bm Tsa, and have shewn a tendency' to interest profession 8 01016 ^ Polltl0al mtri g nes 011 ^ behalf, than in their legitimate A school for Persian boys was started in Manataeh in the sprine—the pupils number about sixty.

K.re ait sipns of this occupation reviving and some sixty Bahrami weavers have estab lished themselves in the village of Budaiyeh ; _ with judicious _ encouragement their numbers would be augmented. Another industry which might possibly be established, and for which the raw material is available, would be the manntac-, ture of mother-o'pearl buttons. At present a certain amount of mo ici- o'pearl exported to Germany for this purpose, but when the ajflount of waste marcr'-il on which freighl is paid, is taken into consideration,.it would seem tnat the export of the finished article should be a business proposition. Shipping. —The number of visits paid by ships to the port of Manameh during 1925 was as follows— British '• ' ' German ' ' /' i Greek ^ ' •' • . His: Majesty's ships visited Bahrain on six occasions. Koyal Indian Marine sLIpg visited Bahrain on six occasions,- The I. E. T. Ship 44 Patrick Stewart ' called once There was a regular weekly mail service from India and a fortnightly service from I raci to India. The unpunctuality of the slow Gulf mail service is the cause of much adverse comment and, piesuni- „ ably owing to the failure of steamers to wireless accurate advice of their arrival, or possibly owing .to miscalculation by the Agents of the time the steamer will require to remain in port to : discharge cargo, the mails are frecjueiitly called for twenty-lour hours or more before it is necessary. Judicial—The number of civil suits filed in the court of the Political Agent during the year was one thousand six hundred ami twelve four hundred and twelve criminal cases were disposed of. In addition several hundied misce laneous pelTtioiis were dealt with. These figures again show an increase over those of the previous year. There was also a considerable increase m the worit of the Bahrain Court which is presided over by the Deputy Ruler in person. Medical. —Assistant Surgson R. Holmes has been in charge of the Victoria Memorial Hospital throughout the year. He has also'acted as Medical Advisei to the Shaik m regard to the Levy Corps and Police forces and has administra tive charge of the hospital boat for the diving fleet and of the Dispensary in Huharraq. One hundred and sixty-eight indoor patients^ and four thousand seven hun dred and ninty-nine outdoor cases were treated m the V ictoria Memorial Hos pital during the year. Nine hundred and fifty seven patients weie treated at the Muharraq Dispensary which is being increasingly resorted to. The services of an Indian Sub-Assistant Surgeon were secured by the Bahrein State eany m the vear he accompanied the pearling fleet in the hospital boat during the sea son and'was in charge of the Muharraq Dispensary during the remainder of the year. The hospital boat made four trips to the pearl banks as under :— Voyage 1, from 20th May 1925 to 7th June 1925 cases treated 57 Voyage 2, from I2th June 1925 to 6th July 1925 cases treated 103 Voyage 3, from 10th July 1925 to 29th July 1925 cases treated 168 Voyage' 4, from 6th August 1925 to 29th August 1925 cases treated .v •' 144 Total 472 Sick divers were frequently taken on board the Hospital boat for short treatment until fit to return to diving. Six serious cases w^ere transferred to the shore HosDital The work done by this floating dispensary is of great value : former ly the many thousands employed in diving were out of reach of medical aid. Bahrein was free from plague during the year under review following the 4 gevere epidemic of 1924, but the unusually, early rains which fell before the hot weather had ceased were the cause of widespread malaria during the latter part ®f the year.75 Visits of Government Officials,—The Hon'ble the Political Eesident visited Bahrein on I5ll6tli of January and from 22nd October to 27t]i October. The Political Agent accompanied the Hon'ble the Resident to the Tracial coast in April. Climate^ —The hot season was normaL An extremely severe cyclone occur red on 1st October accompanied by heavy rain. The pearling ileet was unfor tunately still out and suffered heavily. Tne early cold season till the close of the year has been exceptionally mild and unhealthy. The S'ullan of Nejd. —Sultan Abdul 'Aziz bin Sa'ud was occupied through out the year in hostilities with the Hedjaz and as a result he seems to have had little time to interest himself in the internal affairs of those portions of his domi nions adjoining the Persian Gulf. This probably accounts for the tendency notic ed of late, for Ms local Amirs at Qatif, Jubail and Hasa, to exercise more power than they have hitherto displayed. Several cases have occurred in which Bahrein subjects, and in one case British Indian subjects, have been treated in a decidedly high-handed manner, when on the mainland. On protest being made the parti cular interference has usually ceased without, however, an explanation being afforded, from which it can be assumed that the acts complained of had been due to independent action on the part of the amirs. Reports from the mainland indicate that the trade of Hasa is continually declining, this is attributed to some extent to heavy taxation and frequent levies, both in cash and kind, exacted from the merchants for prosecution of the ' war ' with the Hedjaz. It is stated that many of the leading merchants would gladly leave the Sutan's dominions but they are unable to get away. To prevent such an exodus Bin Sa'ud has issued instructions that no families, i.e., women ailcl children, are to be permitted to leave Nejd. The inhaUl.-aitH (•! the coastal town of Qatif are almost exclusively Shiahs, they were originally Baharainis and some own property both in Bahrain and Qatif. They would probably now return to Bahrain in considerable numbers owingto the improved condition of their co-religionists in Bahrain under Shaikh Hamad's rule, but they are unable to do so fearing reprisals against their rela tives in Qatif and confiscation of their property there. It is certain that they suffer severe oppression at the hands of Bin Sa 'ud's amirs and that their lot is now more unhappy than when the Turks were in Hasa, at which time they were better treated than the Shiahs of Bahrain under the inefficient rule of Shaikh 'Isa. The i)awasir tribe who left Bahrain in 1923, continue to be settled at Bammam. When they were negotiating with the Sultan of Nejd to become his subjects, it is alleged that he promised them exemption from all taxation for ten years. For the first year they were not taxed, but a 4 Mamur ' has now been appointed to Dammam and full taxes are collected from them including forced contributions to the 4 war ' fund. Slave Trade. —16 Negro slaves were manumitted during the year 1925. Qatar. —Nothing to report. (Sd.) C. K. DALY, Major, Political Agent, Bahrain.76 CHAPTER XIIL Administration Beport of the Kuwait Political Agency for the year 1925. Personnel. —Major J. C. More, D.S.O., tield charge of the Political Agency throughout the year. Assistant Surgeon X W. Woodsell, M.C., I .M .D., was in Medical Charge of the Agency, and performed the duties of Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year. The Ruling Family. —His Excellency Shaikh ^hmad al-Jabir as-Subah, C.I.E., was absent from Kuwait from the 30th July to the 26th August on a visit to 'Iraq. l)uring his absence his uncle, Shaikh Hamad al-Mubarak as Subah. officiated for him. Condition of the ^Biplomatic relatoing between Kuwait and Najd remained good, nothwithstanding the fact that Ibn Sa'ud continued his policy of prohibiting his subjects from trading with Kuwait. On the 7th January over a hundred sheep were found in an exhausted condi tion to the west of Jahrah. They had been raided from the Zaiyad and other 'Iraq tribes at Umm ar-Rahl, 65 miles south of Nasiriyah, on the 26th December 1924 by a party of Ikhwan, and had abandoned t hem two days later, oil being bombed by British aeroplanes. The Shaikh ihen7looked after,' and eventually handed over to their owners. A raid took place on the 14th January between Yah and Abatih, about twenty five miles north of Jahrah, in which a party of Mutair, consisting of 17 horsemen and about 350 camel riders under Jazza' bin 'Ashwan and Mukhlif bin Jarbu', both of the Buriah section of the tribe, attacked the Atarimuh, a sub-section of the Ghiyadah section of the 'Awazim. They killed about twenty of the 'Awazim, including five children, and captured sixty camels and a large number of sheep, including some belonging to Shaikh Salman al-Hamud and Shaikh 'Ali al-Kha- lifah of Kuwait. Some of these were subsequently recovered. During the latter part of January extensive raids on the 'Awazim were car ried out by Najd refugees in 'Iraq. It appears that about 45 horsemen and over 50 camel riders originally set out, but a discussion arose as to where they should go, and the raiders split up into two parties. One of these, under 'AH abu Shuwairibat, of the Birzan sub-section of the Buraih section of the Mutair, raid ed the Mula'ibah, a sub-section of the (xhiyodh 'Awazim, at a place called Rish Xa'am, some 125 miles south of Kuwait, and carried off over 200 camels. The other paity, under Mahamnjan bin Qarashi and Hashr al-Mutalaqqim of the 'Ajman, and Dhaidan al-Fuqm of the Muwahah sub-section of the 'Ilwah section of the Mutair, raided the camp of Dhaidan ash-Shuwaimi. At first they were successful, but other 'Awazim came to the rescue and recovered everything. The raiders only retired for a short distance, and, as it was bitterly cold, and as they had captured no plunder and did not expect to be followed, halted for the night. The 'Awazim, however, sent word to Ibn Sa'ud's detachment, which at once started in pursuit. They surrounded the raiders at dawn the next morn ing, and killed all of them, with the exception of Hashr al-Mutalaqqim, who was saved by friends in the detachment. On the 1st February 130 sheep, which were being brought from Zubair to Kuwait, were plundred by twelve men near Jahrah. Of these, however, over a hundred were subsequently recovered and returned by Ibn Sa'ud's detachment. This was only one of a series of outrages perpetrated by a band of robbers— they could hardly be called raiders—, consisting partly of local 'Uraibdar and partly of 'Awazim from the main tribe, who had been terrorizing the country round Kuwait for several weeks. On the 14th February a patrol of fourteen men sent out by the Shaikh came upon thirty of these robbers near Jahrah, and, after obtaining help from the village, succeeded in dispersing the band and capturing eleven of them. These men, who included the ring-leaders, were imprisoned by the Shaikh, and no further trouble was ex perienced.77 On the 3rd May a party of Jiblan, a sub-section of the 'Ilwah section of the Mutair, under the son of Saihud bin Lami, attacked the Diyahin, a sect ot the Auiad \Vasii sub-section of the Buraih section of the same tribe, who had secede from the tribe and were encamped on the north-west shore of Kuwait .bay, some 18 miles from Jahrah, and, after a sharp tight in which each side lost tour men killed, captured everything they had. On the 8th May Ibn Shuqair and Haif al-Fuqm, both of the Muwahah sub section of the 'Ilwah Mutair, with a party of over a hundred camel udeis and some twenty horsemen, attacked a mixed camp of Diyahin and other sece eis from the Ikhwan about live miles north-west of Jahrah. They killed six men and captured nearly two hundred camels, and themselves lost one man killed and three wounded. The seceders wanted to take refuge m Jahrah village, but were refused admittance by the Shaikh's representative. The following day die Ikhwan sent a message to the Shaikh of Kuwait, saying that it they had inadveit- ently plundered anything belonging to him or his subjects, they would re am i.. The Shaikh thanked them, but said that nothing had been taken. On the 7th June a party of about thirty Ikhwan, mostly 'Ajman, who v ere returning from an unsuccessful raid towards Eumailah, arrived at Kar seven miles north-east of Jahrah. Here they met a raiding party 01 ioit\ seceders, who were returning from the Dahanah, after raiding forty camels neai Artawiyah. A fight took place, in which each side lost three or four killed, ine Ikhwan did not recover any of the plunder. On the 2 : 5th June 'Ali bin 'Ashwan, accompanied by Jazza' bin 'Ashwan, Mukhailif al-Jarbu', Salim al-Busaiyis, Dhaif Ullah bin Muhailib, Ibn Majid ad- I) a wish and Muhammad bin Munaikhir, with a force said to consist of over a thousand men, attacked the Dhafir at Habbariyah and Khanaqah near Abu Ghai r where the 'Araif and 'Askar sub -sections«and the Mosamir sect ot the bamic a 1 section, and the Kathir sub-section of the Butun section were camping together. The Dhafir were taken bv surprise and lost several killed. The Ikhwan, win? themselves lost three men killed, captured a very large number of camels an(_ retired via Tuqaiyid. The Dafir who were delayed by the fact that they hsd TDractically no camels in camp at the time of the attack, eventually sent out a pait r in pursuit, which succeeded in recovering about a hundred camels. Under orders from the Traq Government the seceders from the Ikhwan tribes of Najd who had taken refuge in 'Iraq, and had been disturbing the peace of the Frontier for so long, started to move towards the Northern Jazirah, m May and by the end of June the Frontier was free from them. Since then the country has certainly been more peaceful. In the beginning of September the Ikhwan detachment, which had been sta tioned near the southern frontier of Kuwait since June 1924, was disbanded by Ibn Sa'ud's orders. Its commander, Muhammad as-Suhali, went back to Hasa, and the men, who were mostly drawn from the 'Awazim, returned to their tribe. At the end of the month, however, another detachment, consisting of thirty camel riders under Hamad bin Hadfah, arrived. On the 1st October this detachment went to the Zaur Hills on the north-west of Kuwait Bay, and on the following day on their way back to Jahrah they caught ten men whom they suspected of being seceders from the Ikhwan. On their arrival at Jahrah they released seven of these on the assurance of the villagers that they had no connection with the seceders, and shot the other three. On the 6th October they left Jahrah and returned to Najd territory. Pearl Fishery. —About 285 Kuwait pearl divers left for Ceylon at the end of January, to take part in the Pearl Fishery at Marichchukkadi. They re turned in the beginning of May, bitterly disappointed with the result. The Kuwait Pearling Fleet started to leave Kuwait on the 20th May, but, owinc; to exceptionally rough weather at the end of that month, it was not till the beginning of June all boats had left. In all about 250 larger boats proceed ed to the main banks off Bahrain and Qatar, and some 225 smaller boats to the northern banks between Eas-al-Qulai'ah and Ras Mish'ab, including a few boats from Failakah Island and from the villages 011 the coast to the south of Kuwait. The fleet returned during the last week of September, after which a larger proportion than usual returned to the banks for a few weeks for the ' Raddah ' y or second dive. ' ' * liC586FB:78 The season was a remarkably bad one, the catch being small and the market bad. During the early part of the seas.on too, the divers suffered more than normally from colds and fever. Motor Transport concession.— In the end of April the Shaikh granted a Motor Transport Concession to Saiyid Hamid Bey an-Naqib, by which in return for making and keeping up the road from Jahrah to the 'Iraq frontier at Safwan, he has a monopoly of the carrying of passengers and goods by motor car for a period of fifty years. The making of the road will present no great difficulties, and, even without a road, a ear can get through without trouble by making slight detours from the ordinary camel track, and the journey from Zubair to Kuwait has been done in six hours. After obtaining this, concession from the Shaikh of Kuwait Saiyid Hamid Bey an-Naqib applied to the Government of 'Iraq for permission to improve the section of the road from Safwan to Zubair, and to run his cars thereon, but there was some delay before he obtained this. By the end of the year nothing further had been done, but Saiyid Hamid Bey had returned to Kuwait from Basrah, and was hoping shortly to go out into camp, and survey and lay out the road. Medical. —The health of the town was good during the year, except that there was an epidemic of small-pox during the latter portion. Only two_ cases of small-pox were brought to the Charitable Dispensary. Both were children, and when their parents were told that they were suffering from small-pox, they took them away and did not return. Three cas.es of suppuration of the elbow joints, due to small-pox, were brought to the Charitable Dispensary for treatment. Very few of the local inhabitants availed themselves of vaccination against small-pox. ' ' There has been no improvement in the sanitation of the town, which re mains distinctly primitive. 3,645 out-patients, including 799 women and 878 children, were treated in the Charitable Dispensary during the year, as, against 4,769 in 1924. 225 minor operations were performed. On the men's side of the American Mission Hospital 2,976 patients were treated, and on the women's side 3,516, making a total of 6,492, as compared with 6.457 in 1924. 566 surgical operations were performed, and 244 patients were admitted into the wards. No steamers or sailing vessels were placed in quarantine throughout the year. American Mission. —Dr. and Mrs. Mylrea were in Kuwait throughout the year, except that Mrs. Mylrea accompanied Miss Scardefield, who had been dangerously ill since November 1924, to America, leaving in June and return ing O alone in November. Rev. E. E. and Mrs. Calverley, with their children and their governess. Miss Robertson, went to India for three months during the summer, but were in Kuwait during the res.t of the year. Miss Van Pelt was present throughout the year. Dr. and Mrs. Harrison and children were in Kuwait from the beginning of the year until 19th May. Rev. D. Dykstra from 'Amarah visited Kuwait at the Shaikh's invitation at the end of January to install a new electric light plant for him in his house at Ras-al-'Ajuzah. He came again in the latter part of March in connection with the same plant. The Annual Meeting of the American Mission was held in Kuwait in the early part of November, and was attended by a large number of Missionaries from other stations. Khan Sahib 'Abdig Latif, the Director of Customs, put a house and garden of his situated near the Mission at their disposal. Visits. —Major M. A. Nicholson, T,M.S. ? Residency Surgeon and Chief Quarantine Medical Officer in the Persian Gulf, visited Kuwait in R. I. M. S. * ' Lawrence ' on 21st July. Captain E. J. Headlam, C.M.G., D.S.O., A.D.C., R.I.M., Director, Royal Indian Marine and Principal Naval Transport Officer, East Indies, visited Kuwait in R. I. M. S. ' Lawrence ' on 23rd November.79 Naval and Marine. —The only ships of His Majesty's Navy and of the Koyal Indian Marine which visited Kuwait during the year were :— H. M. S. ' Lupin ' from 5th to 7th January. H. M. S. ' Cyclament ' from 29th July to 3rd August. B. I. M. S. ' Lawrence ' from 26th to 27th February, from 23rd to 28th May, from 21st to 22nd July, from 15th to 18th October and on 23rd November. Royal Air Force. —Three aeroplanes, of No. 84 (Bombing) Squadron, Royal Air Force from Shu'aibah, near Basrah, landed at Kuwait on the morning of the 10th March, and returned te Shu'aibah the same afternoon. Kuwait Order in Council. —An Order in Council for Kuwait was finally ap proved by His Majesty in Council on 17th March. It was published in the Gazette of India on 22nd June, and brought into force with effect from the 1st October. Postal. —There was a weekly service of mail steamers from India through out tbe year, and a fortnightly service from Basrah. To supplement the latter, mails were also sent from Basrah to Fao on alternate weeks, and brought from there by water boat by a special postman. Exchange. —The rate of exchange of Maria Theresa dollars varied from Rs. 183-6-0 per 100 dollars in April to Rs. 158-6-0 at the close of the year. British Sovereigns and Turkish Pounds varied from Rs. 14-8-8, and Rs. 13-8-8, respectively in January to Rs. 13-3-0, and Rs. 11-10-0, in October. At the close of the year they were Rs. 13-4-3, and Rs. 11-12-0, respectively. Indian Currency Notes fluctuated considerably. At the beginning of the year they were at a premium of 10 annas, per Rs. 100 ; in April they were at a discount of 8 annas ; and at the close of the year they were at a premium of 5 annas. Climate. —At the opening of the year, and again during the last ten days of January, the cold was intense, the thermometer falling below freezing point for several nights in succession, and snow actually falling on one occasion. The summer was not a particularly hot one, the latter part of May and beginning of June being marked by very strong wind. In the autumn the rainy season started extremely early, the firs.t rain being registered on the morning of the 23rd October. On the afternoon of .the same day there was a heavy shower, accompanied by hail. On the 31st October there was ^n abnormally heavy fall of rain—one and a half inches being registered, thi making a total of 2.24 inches for the month. The total rainfall for the year was 4.67 inches. J. C.

Local Government. - n the Gul f —Mirza Jafar Khan Nuri (Movafaa ud Dowleh) was Governor, untif he proceeded on leave on the T i when the Karguzar acted for him He was a fripnHlv ti ^ of no great strength of character, and he left no mark in Bushi^H' tj 1 o tamed another post while on leave, and did not return. His perman^t2 successor, Ahmad Khan Nekpai (Mufakhan-ul -Mulk), arrived on the 19th November, and took over charge from the Karguzar. ,He is a tar abler man than either of his two immediate predecessors, and is determined to keep up his position, as opposed to the Officer Commanding Troops. He is pos sibly somewhat narrbw in outlook, but seems friendly to the British, lie is a gentleman and therefore more easily dealt with, and has travelled m England, and talks English well. He was m Bushire eighteen vears ago, as Mir Panj (Military Commander) and had the reputation oi being the one honest man in Persia, but a subsequent post m Is ahan pro vided temptation too strong to be resisted, and it is merely a question now of how many noughts there were in the amount he amassed. Karquzar. —Agha Muhammad Mirza Ali Khan, O.B.E., (Muntasir- ul-Mulk), was Karguzar throughout the year. He has maintained his good relations with the British, and has been agreeable and helpful. He offi ciated as Governor during the leave of Mirza Jafar Khan INun, and was popular among the merchants, w T ho wished him to be appointed permanently. His assistant, Muhammad Ali Khan (Sadid -us-Saltaneh), has not, as far as is known, relapsed into pro-Russian activities. Finance Department. —Hakim -ul-Mamalek was replaced in May by M. Yahya Khan, an Armenian; The former was said to have a deticit oi Tomans 2 000 in his accounts. His successor is an abler man m many ways, and speaks English. In February the Persian Government imposed a compounded road tax on all imports and exports. This was to take the place of all the petty taxes collected in the past along the road by munici palities. It has proved a heavy financial burden for Bushire, and not even a blessing to towns in the interior, in whose interests it was supposed to have been enacted. Maior M. Hall, one of the American advisers, was posted to Shiraz, as Finance Director for Fars and the Gulf Ports, during the year. He visited Bushire in December and toured in the district in ..connection with the revision of the revenue derived by the Government from land, and the methods of taxation, S ection 5. Military. Naib Sarhang Muhammad Quli Khan the Bakhtiari Sardar Bahadur and brother of the Sardar Asad, the Shah's supporter who has held posi tion in the Cabinets remained in command at Bushire throughout the year He distinguished himself by exacting heavy bribes from our old friend Haidar Khan, Zabit of Hayat Daud, collecting m all about Tomans 7 000. In June he arrested Haidar Khan's son, Allah Karam Khan, on a charge of interfering with telegraphic communications, brought him in to Bushire, and sent him up to Shiraz. There was no doubt of his innocence of the charge, but he was kept in imprisonment until after trial by a military court. ' When his innocence was established he was allowed out on bail, and ultimately freed. He reached Bushire on the 10th September on his way home. In June, owing to a clamour throughout the country against excessive militarism, orders were received for the abolition of the military regime and the substitution of civil government. The military governors of Bandar bilam and Dashti and Dashtistan were accordingly replaced by civilians. In October operations were started against the tribes in Dashti and Dash tistan. Naib Sarhang Atapur took 240 men from the Bushire garrison to Borazjun, and in December Naib Sarhang Muhammad Quli Khan, who had lately returned from several months' leave, took 50 more men and 2 machine guns. The Chief of Staff of the Division had also taken a large detachment of men from the Shiraz garrison down into Dashti further to the south -east. Negotiations for disarming the tribes were in progress at the end of the year with whomsoever the military could find.3 The disposition of the forces in the Bushire area was estimated to be roughly as follows at the beginning and close of the yean— 1st January. 31st December. Bushire 260 men 186 Borazjun 60 „ 240 Pehbehan ^00 „ 110 Dilwar 3 „ 3 L ngah 25 „ 21 Dashfci 50 „ Dilam ... ^ 15 „ 3 S ection 6. Aviation, The work of preparing the route for the Imperial Airways Ltd., service from Cairo to Karachi was continued. Colonel Shelmerdine, representing the Air Ministry, and Mr. Wolley Dod, representing Imperial Airways, Ltd., toured the Persian Gulf, selecting suitable aerodromes and propos ing improvements to those in existence. On the 26th March two Danish aviators. Lieutenants Botved and Her- chend, arrived from 'Iraq on their flight from Copenhagen to Tokio. 'They left the next day. On the 13th April Captains Loriga and Gallanza, Spanish aviators, passed through on their flight from Madrid to the Philippines. On the 16th May Lieutenant Herchend returned on his way back to Copenhagen, and left the next day. On the 13th July Mr. (now Sir Alan) Cobham arrived on his sea-plane flight to Australia, and left for India the next day. He passed through again on the 26th on his return flight to England. On the 26th December, Messrs. Stack and Leete arrived on their Moths en route to India. This was the first long distance flight on such small machines. S ection 7. The Political Situation. Politically, as regards Bushire, the year has been a quiet one. The Shah's coronation was celebrated at Bushire on the 24th, 25th and 26th April, when the town was gaily decorated and illuminated. There was not very much enthusiasm in the town over these celebrations, which were re garded very generally as. merely another excuse for a holiday. In the summer the Shah agreed to the replacement of military gover nors by civilians—more or less throughout the country. It is interesting also to note that about the same time the Amniyeh (Security) Department took over from the Military the issuing of licenses to persons wishing to possess rifles. The elections to the sixth Mejlis passed off quietly, with about the same amount of jobbery and corruption as usual. Shaikh Ali Dashti and Nizam us Sultaneh were elected by large majorities for Bushire, the sitting member, Mirza Ali Kazaruni, being the only other candidate to obtain many votes. Shaikh Ali Dashti is the editor of the Tehran newspaper 'Shafagh- i-Surkh,' and Nizam us Sultaneh is the son of the previous Governor General for Fars, and may be described as a local absentee landlord of little importance. The end of the year found nobody in Bushire very interested in poli tics, and the military in a somewhat less important position politically than they had been for some time past.S ection 8. Trade and Trade Facilities. Trade. —The harvest was not bad in the district, but trade was still stagnant, though showing signs of improvement towards the end of the year. The most notable event was a proclamation making rupees no longer current or legal tender. This is due to the new nationalistic spirit in Persia. Communications. —The Shiraz road became practicable early in the spring and remained so throughout the year. There were attempts made to improve the surface, notably at the foot of the Pir-i-Zan Kutal, where culverts were also being put in to carry off rain water. At present there is not nearly enough money actually spent on the road to ensure that the surface will not deteriorate from wear and tear alone. Security. —The insecurity of the Shiraz road, and even of Bushire itself, has been notorious during the year. In January and February rob beries were many in Bushire itself and the neighbouring hamlets. There was an attempt on a house of a European, as a result of which a small party oi troops was sent out to Tangistan to arrest the supposed .offenders, but they were turned back by the Tangistanis without result. In August and September there were repeated robberies on the Shiraz road, particularly between Ahmedi, and Kunar Takhteh, with the result thatihe Amniyeh closed the road for a few days, and the military sent down 50 cavalry and 100 infantry from Shiraz for protection purposes. There were also local disturbances between Angali and Shabankareh, and also between A^alu, Gilehdar, Kangan and Gabandi, which helped to unsettle th^ tribes of the hinterland. In March too, a party of geologists of the Anglo Persian Oil Company were robbed when out in the district near Iskanan. Postal facilities.—There is now a motor postal service between Boraz- jun and Bushire, which seems to run well. M. Arjumand, the Provincial Director, went on leave in August and was replaced by Haidar Khan Brah man, from Shiraz. The latter seems well-disposed and agreeable and is an improvement on his predecessor. Foreign commercial enterfrise.—Rerr Wassmuss managed to keep going on his farm owing to the good harvest at the beginning of the year, but he could not do much more. This year will be critical for him. Russian commercial activities in Bushire have been negligible. The rumours last year of Russian trade activity came to nothing. Opium. —7,894 cases were exported from Bushire, as against 6,227 in 1925. Part of the Commission of Enquiry appointed by the League of Nations to enquire into opium production in Persia visited Bushire in April. There is, of course, no opium grown locally. Appendix I M emorandum from M ajor M. A. N icholson , I. M .S., on the working of the R esidency D ispensary and C haritable H ospital, B ushire for the year 1926. ? ' Major M. A. Nicholson, I.M.S., was in charge of the Residency Dis pensary and Charitable Hospital during the entire year with Khan Baha dur Jemadar Maula Baksh, I.O.M. in subordinate charge. The better service instituted in the preceding year bore fruit in 1926 with a very lame increase in out-patient attendances and minor operations. These numbered 59,056 and 2,128 respectively. In-patient work is still hampered by want of facilities for their proper care and nursing. This defect partly resultstor the want of suitable accommodation for such a staff even if it existed. In ] 925 owing to the expenditure incurred on organising and equipping the institution there was an excess of expenditure over income of Krans 28,595 25 and Rupees 2,469-7-6. In 1926 the expansion of the Out Patient Attendances necessitated additional expenditure both on material and personnel with a resulting de- ficit of expenditure over income of Krans 13,398 65 and Rupees 395-6-0. Conditions have now I think become stabilised and moreover the Institu tion benefited by the handing over to it of a large quantity of useful and valuable stores from the Indian Military Hospital when it closed down. Bar articles of routine expenditure there is now an excellent stock of drugs of all kinds. It should therefore be possible in the future to keep the annual expen diture within the income.

Inspection. —The Chief Quarantine Medical Officer visited Mohamme- rah. Ahwaz and Masjid-i-Suleiman at the request of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in January. Epidemics. —Small pox was endemic throughout the year in the Garmsir but never reached any serious proportions; and the incidence was consider ably less than the previous year. The Gulf Ports were free from the occur rence of plague, cholera, typhus and relapsing fever. Imposition of Quarantine. —Owing to continued sporadic cases of plague reported from Karachi 'quarantine was imposed throughout the year on passengers therefrom at Bandar Abbas and Jask. Buildings. —All Quarantine Stations except Mohammerah are gener ally unsuitable and particularly lack means of isolating and treating cases- of sickness that might occur amongst those quarantined. The buildings at Lingah have become unserviceable and their re-erection is roughly estimated to cost krans 15,000. Disinfectors. —Except at Mohammerah, all require overhaul and re pair. The British Government have allotted a sum of £800 towards and undertaken the repair and overhaul of these apparatus. Transport. —The very unsatisfactory and wasteful state of affairs existing for the transport of Medical Officers making their inspections of shipping and for the transport of passengers to the Quarantine Stations from the ships, as well as the total lack of means of transport of any pos sible sick has been fully detailed in my No. 144, dated the 13th August 1925, to the Address of the President of the Sanitary Council. Nothing further has eventuated. Code of Procedure. —The code sanctioned by the President of the Sani tary Council in his No. 3576/974, dated 22nd Mehr 1304 is still working satisfactorily. Personnel. —During the absence of Mr. Lincoln from Mohammerah on leave between May and November his duties were carried out by Mr. Wood- sell who then relieved Mr. Guzen at Lingeh. Mr. Guzen proceeded to India on termination of his tour of duty. Mr. Hynes, Quarantine Medical Officer, Bushire, proceeded on study leave to the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine and his duties have been carried out-by Mr. Sweeney. Notification of Disease. —The Health Section of the League of Nations Epidemiological Bureau at Singapore send a weekly code cable of informa tion concerning various Indian Ports. In return we send a weekly sum mary by letter of items of epidemiological and meteorological interest con cerning the ports of Mohammerah, Bander Abbas and Bushire. We are also pledged to cable to the Bureau immediate intelligence of any outbreak of quarantinable disease and to keep them informed of the progress of the outbreak.9 CHAPTER II EVENTS AND CONDITIONS IN EARS. M arch 1926—M arch 1927. 'Marking time' perhaps best sums up the current of events and deve lopment in this province during the period: The new found mood for re vival and reform is holding its own, and nothing more: enthusiasm has abated, and some pessimism is abroad; but even what remains should be a cause for thankfulness. It is a truism, of course, that any noticeable change in this distant province from the condition of affairs six, or twelve, or twenty years ago is to be found in the few towns and townships : not in the districts. With the sole exception of more respect for the Central Government, and peacefulness the traveller would search long for signs of a new outlook, or comprehension of the need for a common ideal and effort by peasantry and tribespeople as well as townsmen, or even a desire for new conditions. Administration. —The Civil administration of Ears has ! remained* throughout the period in the intelligent and capable hands of Haji Nehdi Khan Nasir Isfandiari (eldest son of the ex-Minister of Einance, Haji Muh- tashim-us-Saltaneh) : His capacity for work; desire to arrive at a settle ment of difficulties, whether administrative or foreign, quick perception of points at issue, and diplomacy have enabled him to acquire respect in Shiraz, and keep the other government departments working in relative harmony with him. In June military governorships of the sub-provinces were abolished, and Chilians appointed, except for the Qashqai, and the Kuhgilu (where no suitable candidate would proceed under existing conditions). The conti nuance of the hereditary jurisdiction of Mirza Ibrahim Khan Qawam over Easa-Darab-Laristan and eastern Ears was the object of attack by a Tehran newspaper towards the end of 1926 ; the Press of Shiraz however not only defended it, but pointed out that, were it replaced by a crowd of ministerial officials from the north, the cost and oppression to the inhabi tants would be greater than it is now, and there would not be the same per sonal interest in their welfare. The election to the sixth Majlis terminated in May 1926. They were not free elections, in the sense as understood in Europe, and the list of can didates, who were to be successful, was more or less agreed by the central government, the Qawami interest in Shiraz, and the Military Command. In October 1926 there was a change of Karguzar, Mirza Ali Reza Khan Sa'idi Ansari being replaced by his brother-in-law, Mirza Abdul Karim Khan Pisiyan Sultani: in October too a new department—that of Public Health—was opened by the despatch of a physician from Tehran, and by several minor appointments to the chief townships of the province: and in January 1927 a Registrar was appointed to make a register of the popula tion, on the result of which the quota of conscripts would be drawn by the Director of Recruiting in all the South, who also reached Shiraz at the same time. A wireless station, erected by Russian engineers and mechanics, and opened in August, was handed over to the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs for the transmission of civil messages at the end of 1926. There has been some agitation for an extension of the local land lines to Easa, Jahrum, Lar and other provincial centres. Without having been threatened in any serious degree, secu rity has been none too good, and to a marked extent less satisfactory than in 1925. None of the outlying regions of the province, such as the Kuhgilu, the Rustam tribe of Mamasanni, the coastal region of Tangistan and Dashti, the Southern-eastern districts between the Eiruzabad-Jahrum-Darab line and the sea coast, or the Chahar-rahi tribes in the north east, have been brought under control of the Government. No further disarmament has10 taken place throughout the past twelve months in the areas men- tiooed, which include practically all the country east and south, and south east of the Shiraz-Bushire road; and, though from December 25th 1926 a force of some 250 soldiers has been stationary in Dashti, the latest news is that the headmen of that extensive district are still hesitating to surrender their arms, and have paid only a small portion—some 1,000 Tomans—of their arrears of revenue. A larger force of some 400—500 military, with a few guns, augmented by Qashqai levies, and under the command of the Chief of Staff in the South, has been since early in January making a pro gress through the districts of Qir and Karzin/Gilahdar, Khunj, etc., (in the hinterland of the port of Tahiri). There have been many instances of tribal fighting during the year, and many robber bands have victimised the countryside with more or less im punity. On February 13th 1926 a party of geologists of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was looted near Warawi, inland from the port of Asalu, after an attack on their caravan in which promiscuous firing took place: £777 worth of effects were lost, but the Company preferred not to make an official claim. The scene of the robbery is in no jnan's land, between the extreme southern limit of Mirza Ibrahim Khan Qawam's jurisdiction and Gilahdar : and likelihood of any of the actual property being recovered is small. A new and unpleasant feature of insecurity during the year was the holding up of motor-cars {a) on the Fasa road at the end of April, when one traveller was shot and killed, and cash carried off, (h) on the Fasa road in May, driver killed and two bales stolen, {c) near Jahrum in July, when a considerable sum of money was also taken and a man killed, {d) at the end of August on the difficult Eudak pass (Bushire-Shiraz road) when there was no bloodshed, but women stripped of ornaments, {e) about 30th Sep-, tember near Mukhak pass on Jahrum road, (/) in February 1927 near Gach Qara Quli, the site of the Anglo-Persian Oil Co.'s working in the Mailatun hills by Boir Ahmadis, when three European employees were stripped, and made to run a distance, {g) a few days later another car was fired on in the area of the Company's operations in Fars, (h) on February 15th, 1927 on the Jahrum road, near the scene of the other attacks, lire was opened on the car of a notable Kalantar by four men at close quarters, and a bullet passed through the cap of the Indian chauffeur; one assailant was killed and another wounded by the Kalantar. Through the Amnieh department of Fars the sum of Krans 1,694 was paid in compensation for the robbery of one bale of cambrics belonging to Messrs. Ziegler and Co., near Rahdar in the Kazarun plain on October 16, 1925. Bat British claims for Krans 4,050 and 2,000 on account of the rob beries in September 1925 and July 1926 of piece-goods, remain unpaid, despite numerous reminders. On April 7th 1926 a sanguinary affair took place at the important town ship of Jahrum, one hundred miles south-east of Shiraz, wfcere there is a district governor and small detachment as garrison. The Bahais, who are numerous there, were attacked by a fanatical crowd in th^ir houses and the streets: eight were bludgeoned or stabbed to death, and a number wounded and their houses looted. The primary cause was denunciations and inflam matory speeches in the mosque. Underlying the series of disturbances of the security and good order of the province five factors may be noted (i) insufficient numbers of troops in such a large province to deal smartly with any outbreak, (ii) a growing hesitation on the part of the General Officer Commanding and his Staff to vise force, bring to heel, and punish any offending tribal unit, or miscreants, a supineness appearing to the foreign observer almost callousness, (iii) failure to proceed with disarmament of the larger tribes and districts at a distance from Shiraz on the one hand, and on the other the disarmament in 1925 of the settled villages for a distance round Shiraz and along the main road from Bushire to Isfahan, has left the more peaceful section of4 11 the province a prey to the truculence of their wellarmed neighbours, (iv) the Amnieh roadguards and posts are too few to be able to track or follow up robbers : they are often drawn from undesirable local elements in touch with the local bandits, (v) oppression and extortion by military or civil subordinate officers have driven men in some cases into a life of revolt and outlawry. With all this, travel on nearly all the recognized roads of the province is infinitely safer than it used to be: both for caravans and for individual persons incidents are the exception. This is probably more due to a recog nition by the former bands, which terrorized them, that it is wiser to keep to their own limits and not get themselves into bad odour, than to any in trinsic merit in arrangements for guarding the roads. In the distant dis tricts, or mountain fastnesses, far removed from the roads, the position is different; there the tribesmen cherish their independence of any control, and particularly the possession of their arms and ammunition: and they watch closely the failure of the Military Command to get on with disarma ment, deal with outbreaks, or isolated cases of brigandage. The weaker military efficiency appears to become, the bolder they are; and those who hid weapons when disarmament began, are gradually getting them out again, or even buying them in Shiraz. It depends on the personal policy of individual Khans whether their districts and tribes remain quiet. Military Affairs. —Except for the period between July 26th, when some 580 men marched back from the Luristan expedition, to October 18th, at no time from January 1926 to February 1927 did the garrison in Shiraz, headquarters of the Southern Division, exceed 1,000 strong and it was often under 500 : this represents a diminution of some 800 men on the maximum strength noted in 1925. The decline in the morale and effectiveness of the troops in Fars lies largely at the door of Amir Lashkar Mahmud Aqa Khan Airam, and for the rest at that of the influence in Tehran which permits him to remain in such an important post. Personally mild-and conciliatory, and on excellent terms with everyone, enjoying his comfortable position in Shiraz, he is one of the old school who considers it is due to make as much as possible out of it, particularly out of the grant for the Southern Division. Monthly and regularly, from 75,000 to 80,000 odd Tomans are remit ted from Tehran through the Imperial Bank of Persia for the expenses of the division. Yet private soldiers have been kept without their allowance of 5 Tomans for periods of twelve to three months, and exist on the ra tions issued out to them: all the more scandalous considering that the total number to be paid is so small. Another example. When tailors where kept with the units, the unit commanders saw to it that their men got the three uniforms (or at least two), to which they were entitled annually. The Amir Lashkar has col lected the various company tailors into a divisional tailoring department: this enables him to arrange that only one, or at most two uniforms are issued yearly to each man, and to charge to his own credit the clothing not issued. With few exceptions officers are occupied in finding methods of mak ing the money, which they do not get in pay, and in enjoyment, caring little for their men. There are private feuds and jealousies among them. Worst of all is the example set by the Amir Lashkar himself in loose living. It is striking, so soon after 1920 and 1922, to hear really patriot offi cers, wearied and disgusted, say that their army administration will never be a success, until it is run by foreign military officers. Financial Department .—On March 13th one of the financial mission from the United States, Major Hall, D.S.O., arrived from Tehran to take over the position of Provincial Director in Fars and the Gulf Ports. He is personally liked among those Persian officials and members of society, whom he meets, but he is handicapped by a limited vocabulary in Persian in a place where few know European languages, and thus much in the12 hands of his senior subordinates and interpreter, and to the merchants and public having business with his department he is said to be rarely acces sible and little known. Though Haji Amanullah Khan Ardalan remained on as assistant to Major Hail, the latter brought with him to Fars, and posted as heads of sections, several notherners, who had served under him at Meshed, and in whom he placed all his confidence. As like him they were entirely new to southern Persian conditions, and as political and administrative con ditions in Fars are far behind those of Khurasan ^n development and smooth ness of working, it is not surprising that l)y Major Hall s own avowal in conversation, he finds things difficult, and that friction with the public and the other authorities has occurred at several points during the year. In the spring and early summer of 1926 a bad impression of the good faith of the local Finance administration was created by a grazing tax on all caravan animals being farmed out all down the road from bliiraz to the coast plain. This was not only a violation of the law recently passed by the Majlis, the 'Abolition of Road-Toll act,' which specifically forbade the taking of pasturage taxes; but on certain stretches of the road it was a new charge on trade, and local exactions of the nature had in the past two years been suppressed by the Road-guard department. Similarly Persian mer chants were indignant, and the newspapers voluble over the persistence of Major Hall and his staff in levying 'banderolle' taxes on opium, a 'per capita' tax on mules at Kazarun, and other exactions, orders for the cessa tion of which had been issued by the Ministry of Finance in Tehran : and this, in spite of repeated steps taken by the deputies for Fars in Tehran with the Ministry of Finance in having the orders publicly communicated to the Department in Shiraz. In other instances, concerning the proper ties and affairs of private individuals, settlements made by I)r. Millspaugh and his officials in Tehran with the parties, were ignored and set aside by the local administration in Fars. The Finance Department by their desire to increase revenue and their insistence on many demands for taxation, which were known to be irregular, e.g., the grazing tax, abolished by the compounded Road Tax Act, made themselves very unpopular in the Province. Next, in June and July, friction arose with the Amir Lashkar and his Chief of Staff over the taxation of the Qashqai clans, which are under a Military Governor. Major Hall and his non-Farsi advisers, having as certained from the Kalantars of the clans in an enquiry what sums were extorted from them by the rapacious Military Governor of 1925 (who had already been removed on account of complaints by the clans) wished the Kalantars to sign bonds to pay not only those sums against which they had protested, but in addition a sum as the assumed profit of the Kalantars in running the clans, instead of the 60,000 Tomans, the annual scheduled tax of the whole Qaslhqai tribe. This would have meant extracting 90 ; ,00(/ Tomans from it. The Military Command refused to allow any responsi bility by the Military {Governor for such heavy taxation being collected, on the ground that military pressure at the request of the Finance Depart ment might provoke disorders and an outburst. After the Kalantars had been kept waiting about the town for some three months, early in August Major Hall modified his demands to a sum, which came nearer the former schedule. All this, and other matters, coinciding with the campaign against the United States Advisers in Tehran, led to ''public disgust' (as one newspaper described it) with the officials of the Department, and plain hometruths as to the confusion and corruption in its administration being voiced in the local press in July and August. In the autumn began the surveys of landed properties in the districts nearer Shiraz for the re-assessment of land-tax under the new law at a 31 per cent- collection of average annual proceeds of four years' crops. Survey officials have been sent to the districts and villages, to check their information and form their own opinion as to their productivity, and assess13 the final basis of the new tax. This has on the one hand led undoubtedly to the demanding of money by these survey officials in consideration of their making low assessments, or to over-assessment of values, failing the receipt of 'douceurs'. One Persian Finance Officer, who had no reason to mis lead, informed the Consulate that a colleague had made, 5,000 Tomans in this way; and, as an old resident of the British commercial community put it 'with the exception of Major Hall and Haji Isz-ul-Mamalik, from the highest to the lowest, they are all robbing and extorting from the people, and taking bribes right and left, and none knows where to turn for re dress, as complaints to Tehran are ignored.' Recent quarterly reports of the Administrator-General give the num ber of employees of the Department in Fars as : 259 in September 1925, 314 in September 1926. As to the revenue obtained from Fars, in which is now included the Gulf Ports Province for purposes of taxation, all receipts are paid into the Imperial Bank of Persia, and expenditure made from the same account. In strict confidence, the following figures have been privately furnish ed, and are quoted because they give a better idea of the true state of affairs than the various separate tables in the quarterly reports of the Adminis trator-Gener ail. In March !1925-2Q Krs. 9,494,374 paid into 'ordinary account.' In March 1926—Jan. 15, 1927 Krs. 7,626,099 paid into ordinary account' which roughly means'^hat some 30,000 Krans {i.e., from 791,197 to 762,609) less per mensem have been collected in the current year by an increased staff. As to expenditure. —From December 1925 (when the separate disburs ing account of monies received for the purpose by telegraphic transfers from the Ministry of Finance, was opened) till March 21, 1926 the cost of administration was Krs. 810,365. From March 22 1926 to Jan. 15th 1927 it was Krs. 3,793,728. This represents an increased cost of administration (not inclusive of the salary of the Provincial Director from the United States) from Krans 270,171 yer mensem in 1925-26 to Krans 379,372 in 1926-27 \ or 100,000 Krans p. m. Ft aJ so implies that the monthly cost of administration in the current year is nearly 50 per cent, of the revenue collected. The result is not encouraging, and shows how difficult is the financial problem in the southern region. Trade and Economic Features. —From early in 1926 to September the unremunerative and unhealthy condition of trade was even more pronounced than in 1925. From September money began to circulate more freely with the revival of the opium trade (which had practically ceased to the Far Fast from absence of demand), this time by British and Dutch Colonial Governments. I hat the effect of the Sugar Monopoly Tax in (a) removing very large sums of the trading capital of importers (because prices to the consumer have risen little and the prime cost of sugar in the world market has been low), and (7/) driving the smaller importer out of business by reason of the considerable total in Customs and Monopoly duties to be advanced in cash on import, has damaged trade generally is clear. Moreover the smuggling along the Persian coast from the Arab ports has quite naturally, in view ol* the utterly disproportionate duties taken on the two coasts, the inability of the poor F ersian peasantry to buy dear sugar, and their large consump tion of it, greatly increased during 1926. A few isolated captures and confiscations of smuggled cargoes was a drop in the ocean: the lengtli of the I ersian coast-line and its difficult nature for a preventive service, coupled with the fact that the whole coastal population is hand in glove with the smugglers and benefits from their activities renders the Customs adminis tration helpless to cope with it. Moreover too, on all hands one hears of pe ty merchants buying smuggled consignments so that monopoly-paid sugar has to complete at a loss with sales of smuggled goods outside and inside the town, as far mlanci as Shiraz. J14 The imposition, in the spring of 1926, of the Road. Tax on the gross weights of all imports and exports only served to hamper traders, increase costs, and restrict trade still further. The south had been, relatively to the North and West, little troubled by the road-toll and octroi {nawaqil) dues taken at three or four points in the whole region. It now found itself bur dened with a tax 15 to 20 times heavier in its incidence on trade via the Gulf : and a tax, which was so carelessly framed in the classification of the schedule, that trade in certain heavy goods, or goods in heavy receptacles, was stopped dead. From March to December 1926, of a budget of 50,000 Tomans for the Public Works Department in the South (from the coast to the Isfahan border) only 22,000 Tomans (say £4,400) had been spent, and of that the office expenses at Shiraz amount to 11,000 Tomans annually. Yet the' figures in Dr. Millspaugh's 16th quarterly report for Road-tax taken at Bushire in the first six months of the year were Tomans 201,585 and aceord- ing to the law, and to the condition made by His Majesty's Government in accepting it, 50 per cent, of the proceeds were to be spent in the province where it was collected, or the provinces whose trade was dependent on the port or frontier post where it was collected. One remarkable feature of 1926 was the adaptation of routes from Shiraz to provincial centres, distant 100 to 200 miles, for light passenger motor traffic, e.g., Fasa, Darab, Jahrun, Lar. The tracks are poor, and the cost of labour was paid, not by the State, but by the Local towns people, villagers and property-owners for the most part. All through the year the local newspapers have lamented the economic impoverishment of the South, the paucity of exports, dearth of money, and lack of openings of employment. In this connection the drainage of the hundreds of thousands of Tomans from the pockets of the South into the National Treasury in Tehran on account of the sugar monopoly and road taxes has been severely criticized, not only by the local Press, but by traders generally: there are not wanting those who predict a general collapse of trade and the vanishing of liquid capital, if this drainage be continued many more years, certainly, without the revived opium export the situa tion and outcry in this respect would have been acute by the end of 1926. An interesting experiment, with the deliberate object of trying to in troduce fresh produce for export, has been the engagement by Mirza Ibrahim Khan Qawam, on a three years' contract, of a British agricultural expert with experience in Egypt to run a Model Farm, and employ machinery, if the experiment be starved for capital in its early years, it is bound to be a failure: and much too depends on the cost of transport to the coast, when the proposed new crops foreign cotton, sesame, flax, soya, beans and tobacco—are eventually produced. The ^reconstruction of the ancient dam on the Pulwar river for the irri^ gation of Ramjird district, where for decades there has been a desolation of some thirty ruined villages, has got no further owing to the failure of the Ministry of Imance to propose reasonable terms to the owners of these pioperties. Complaint is also levelled at this Ministry that there may occur withm a year or two great damage to their own land-tax interests, as we as to t e ciops of the people, unless they make an adequate outlay for the eradication ^ of ^ locust eggs from the soil of districts in Eastern Fars. , 0 e criticism against the present financial policy of the central m ee ? ? a ' * n the matter of the proposed Agricultural furfon lvplnS n .

Since the end of 1926 a series of remarkably outspoken articles have been written by the editor of the paper 'Istakhr' denouncing bribery and corruption in the Courts of Justice of Shiraz, and above all their failure to deal with litigation which has disgusted the people. Attention is called to the fact that the extra-territorial Courts of foreign treaty Powers exist because those Powers decline to expose their nationals to the bribery, in justice and incompetence of Persian tribunals, and further to Doctor Mill- spaugh having created (contrary to the iConstitution) a tribunal in the Ministry of Finance, and refused to allow employees of his department to be tried by the Adlieb Courts. This indictment, which has been received with general satisfaction locally, and supported independently by other newspapers of Shiraz under such headings as &lt;c The Finance Department is rotten : the Courts of Justice even more rotten' was spontaneous, and preceded the closing of the Court in Tehran in February 1927 by the new Minister of Justice. This local and national discontent with the system of justice, and the chicanery and bribery prevailing, is all to the good : it implies a stirring of the national conscience, and the longer it lasts and deeper it goes, the better for any future development of Persia, of which a fair administration of justice to all must be the chief foundation. CHAPTER III. NOTE ON EVENTS IN THE BIKARZ AREA DURING THE YEAR 1926. ... Naib Azizullah Khan has continued in charge of the Military detach ment in Mi shun and has been tractable and easily handled. Geda Khan has continued as head of the Kashkuli guard which has been reduced to 25 men. Haider Khan, C.I.E., has been responsible for the guarding arrange ments in Ganowah and his son Allah Karam Khan acts as head guard. Although all Hyat Daud guards are armed, the number has been reduced to fifteen and their rate ot p^y to Krans ninety-five per mensem. During the period Allah Karam Khan was imprisoned by the military his salarv was paid to. his father.

He was, on the whole, well disposed towards the British and on friendly terms with H. B. M.'s Consul.

Though outwardly friendly with this Consulate the present Governor is not popular generally. He is weak and inexperienced, addicted to opium and believed to be very currupt.

Linnah . —MIRZA AHMED KHAN (IKRAM-UL-MULK) held the appointment throughout the year. He is an amiable old man but weak and unfortunately is usually under the influence of opium. Finance Deipartment. Bandar Abbas. —MIRZA ABDUR RIZA KHAN the AMIN-1- MALYIEH after enjoying an uninterrupted innings for three years was relieved on the 27th October, 1926, by Monsieur MISRUP KHAN, an Armenian. MIRZA ABDUR RIZA is believed to have acquired a small fortune during his tenure of office and to have reaped a specially good harvest since the monopoly taxes on tea and sugar were put into force. The present incumbent is a quiet and friendly official. Ungah .— : Agha MOHAMED HASSAN KHAN, the Revenue Officer has completed his fourth year in office. He is supposed to have enriched himself by conniving at, if not actually participating in, the illicit trade in opium. Posts and Telegra-phs. Bando.r Abbas. —SliED JALAL-UD-DIN who had been Postmaster since 1921 was transferred to BUSHIRE in August. Although his ad ministration was efficient and his relations with the Consulate strictlv cor rect, he was given to political intrigue and believed to be anti-British at heart. Lingah.—The notoriously objectionable Postmaster SAYED ZAMOON was relieved in April by MIRZA ALI AKBAR the present incumbent, and a more satisfactory state of affairs has since existed at the Post Office. Police Department. 0 ® ces ^ 'Nazmieh' department were established at BANDAR ABBAS and LING AH. The police force at each of these places now consists of a MOIN NAIB and fifteen men of whom the majority have been enlisted locally. The class of police recruits is of a fairly low standard.

The contract for the constructional work has been given to a British Engineering firm at KARACHI. The necessary operations were commenced in December and it is ex pected will be completed by the end of April 1927. Persian Troops. In September, 1926, the troops stationed in the Bandar Abbas district hitherto drawn from KERMAN were brought directly under the Command of the Southern Army at SHIRAZ. YAWAR HUSSAIN ALI KHAN accompanied by four junior otlicers arrived at the end of August and relieved Naib I ALI ASGHAR KHAN. The strength of the Command was maintained at 320 Infantrymen and 8 sowars. Of these 195 foot soldiers were stationed at Charbar. The garrison of BANDAR ABBAS consisted of 70 nizamis and 8 mounted men. Small detachments were posted at MINAB and J ASK. It is intended to reduce the strength of the troops in the Bandar Abbas district to one battalion of about 240 men of all arms, and with this object in view men who are considered unfit for service are already being- discharged. There were a few instances in which excesses were committed by the Military m the bazaar, but there has been a marked improvement in the conduct and discipline of the men recently. Ling ah —The detachment stationed here was withdrawn to BUSHIRE on the 6th August. Condition vf the Country. Bandar Ahhas. —Although a regular police force commenced to func tion from Apri], there was no decrease in the number of thefts recorded in the town. On the contrary, these have appreciably risen. During the year, eight cases of theft affecting the property of British subjects have been reported to the authorities. The amount' involved is estimated at Rs. 6,000, no part of which has been recovered. In April, a murder was committed in broad daylight in the.house in the town of the head ferrash of the local branch of the^ Imperial Bank of Persia. The motive of the crime was theft, and the principal, culprit was accidentally shot in a scuffle with the police. ~ ^ - Minah.-.-'^I\th the exception of a few instances of petty thefts report ed the town and one of tooting in the adjacent villages in stigated by the out-law ABBAS KHAN who is still at large the town and country-side enjoyed a period of comparative peace and tranquillity This is to a large extent due to the elimination from that district, of the notori ous IBRAHIM KHAN, who was executed at BANDAR ABBAS in 1&lt;)25 and also of his principal confederates who had been arrested bv the militarv and are still under detention. ' ' ^ Biyaban . After a record of continuous strife and chronic unrest dur ing the past two decades this district was quiet on the whole and no militarv operations were necessary during the year under review v The chief enactor in this area in recent years MIR BARAK AT KHAN, appears to have been inactive except for a pettv'fiffht af KOW tqta A feJgfA* ' ABDUU - A 'HAN 1. 0 M P .b„ y „„ S19 Condition of the roads. The main Caravan route, BANDAR ABBAS to KERMAN rAa DAULATABAD and DAFT was open throughout and no robberies on this road were reported here. This satisfactory state of affairs is attributable to the vigilance of the AM NT EH department. Minab-Bandar Ahhas road. —This trade route was interrupted for a short time during the months of May and June. As the result of representations made J to the authorities, a military post was established in July. Arms Traffic. No cases of confiscation of arms were reported in the BANDAR ABBAS or LING AH districts.' Slave traffic. Bandar A bbas. —9 males and 3 females describing themselves as slaves took refuge in the Consulate; of these, 8 males and 1 female were manu mitted by the issue of certificates. Reports were received of the activities of BASHAKARDI tribesmen who were said to be kidnapping men and women in the BIYABAN and BASHAKARD districts for the purpose of selling them as slaves on the Arab Coasts. The local authorities were accordingly informed and re quested to taVe action. Jn February, a case in which two persons from Persian Baluchistan who had kidnapped and brought to BANDAR ABBAS a woman and a girl whom they intended disposing of as slaves, came within the cognizance of this Consulate. Both persons were arrested by the Persian authorities and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Lingah —Four slaves sought asylum in the Consular Agency of whom one received manumission papers, another was sent to BUSHTRE under orders of the Residency, and the remaining two cases are awaitino- dis posal. British Indian Troops. The Indian Infantry Detachment embarked 'for India on the 26th March, on the evacuation of the Persian Gulf Ports bin Indian Troops Imperial Bank of Persia. The Imperial Bank of Persia has continued its efforts to assist the Per sian Government in the clearance from circulation in this district of defec tive coin, and in doing so has met witttf not a little opposition in the bazaars. During the years 1925 and 1926, mutilated and light weight coin re presenting m value about 6,000,000 krans has been collected by the Bandar Abbas branch and sent to Tehran to be re-minted. The rates of exchange as quoted by the Bank during the year were as follows : — Highest sterling- rate Kraos 54 . . . , . p er • Lowest „ „ 44 . Average „ „ „ ^ ^ ' Highest rupee selling rate Krans 388 .... per Rs 100 Lowest „ „ n „ 836 . Average „ „ „ „ 371 . &gt;&gt; }} }&gt; Red Oxide of Iron. JI or muz Island. —There was a marked decrease in the output of the mines due to the small demand of markets in the United Kingdom.20 2,574 tons of this ore were exported on account of British firms, of which 250 were shipped to Calcutta and 2,300 tons to Bremen in a German steamer. Trade and Covimerce. The general depressed state of trade obtaining at the end of 1925, con tinued during the first half of 1926. r p]^0 strict enforcement of the surtax on tea and sugar and the intioduc- tion of the new Compounded road tax on the 18th of February added to the adverse conditions against which the Commercial community had to contend. Needless to mention, the new impositions gave a greater stimulus to smuggling. The total volume of the trade of the Bandar Abbas district during 1925-1926 (Persian Year 1304) the latest year for which statistics from the Customs Department are available, amounted to £1,697,405 of which the value of imports is estimated at £1,230,180 and exports at £467,225. Ling ah .—Imports £221,405, Exports £86,700 making a total of £308,105. These figures show an appreciable decrease both in regard to im ports' and exports, as compared with the preceding year. Shipping. Bandar Ahhas .~l§\ steam ships aggregating 326,446 tons entered and cleared the port, of which 155 were British and 6 German. 29 vessels brought merchandise from the UNITED KINGDOM. Of these 11 belonged to or were chartered by the Ellerman and Bucknall Steam Ship Company and 18 to Messrs. Frank C. Strick and Company Limited. Six ships of the German Hansa Line of BREMEN, called with cargo from HAMBURG and ANTWERP. Ling ah. —89 steamers (86 British and 3 German) with a total of 167,058 tons discharged cargo here. According to the statistics furnished by the Port authorities, 479 sail ing craft of all descriptions aggregating 14,152 tons also entered aud cleared during the year. Political. The old established policy of friendly and helpful sympathy towards the local administration and the Persian population was strictly adhered to, and no further remarks under this head are considered to be necessary. Elections to the sixth Mejliss at Tehran. —These gave rise to a certain amount of excitement but only amongst a very limited circle. Two Candi dates both alien to BANDAR ABBAS, contested the single seat allotted to this district, one of whom was the ex-Deputy for the constituency and a nominee of the Central Government. His rival was supported by the local Governor personally, and was successful in capturing the seat. The elections, if they may be so termed, continued to drag along be tween July and December and the polling was farcical. No interest what ever can be said to have been evinced in them by the man in the street. % Quarantine and Medical. Bandar Ahhas. —Assistant Surgeon D. L. MACKAY, I.M.D.. held the post of 'Quarantine Medical Officer of the port and remained in charge of the Consulate Dispensary and the town Charitable Dispensary through out the year. The attendance of out-door patients at the town Dispensary has in creased considerably and advantage has been taken by caravan men arriving from the outlying districts of the relief being afforded by that institution.21 Town Charitable Dispensary—Attendance. —Figures showing the num bers of outdoor patienls treated are furnished below for the past three years : — 19:U 4.419 1925 5,848 19£6 7,450 Year.

Deaths;—No deaths occurred amongst the patients that were treated at the Dispensary. Epidemics:—In spite of the insanitary condition of the town and its surroundings, there were no epidemics during the year, nor were any re ported to exist in the vicinity of BANDAR ABBAS. Lingah—Charitable Dispensary. —The Dispensary, as mentioned in the last report, is now housed in the Consular Agency Annex. The attendance for 1926 was 1,850 compared with 2,095 in 1925. Economic Conditions. Bandar Abbas. —There was a comparatively abundant rainfall in the surrounding districts. Crops were plentiful and the prevailing rates for supplies in the bazaars were normal. Lingah. —Similar economic conditions existed here. The pearl market was dull and stagnant owing to the competition of the artificially produced article—the cultured pearl. The boat building yards were idle during the greater part of the year and only about four small jolly boats added to the pearling fleet. Caravan traffic between Lingah and the inland town of LAR was fairly brisk throughout. CHAPTER V. His M ajesty's C onsulate, K erman. ADMINISTRATION REPORT FOR 1926. A. British Interests. 1. His Majesty's Consulate. —The post of H. M.'s Consul for Kerman and Persian Baluchistan was held throughout the year by Mr. H. D. G. Law, I.C.S. Khan Bahadur Abdul Alim held the appointment of Indian Attache to His Majesty's Consul throughout the year. Early in the year the Sarhad was transferred from the jurisdiction of H. M.'s Consul, Kerman, to that of H. M.'s Consul for Sistan and Kain. 2. Imperial Bank of Persia. —The refusal of the Bank in January to accept any 'defective' coins caused certain amount of difficulty in the bazar, especially for Hindus who were offered only defective coins by their Per sian customers. In March the Bank regularized the position by laying down clear conditions on which they would accept different classes of old and defective coins.22 3. Church Missionary Society and its work. (&amp;) Ihe Educational work was in the hands of the Rev. A. G. Ozanne (boys school) and Miss Woodroffe and Miss MacDonough (girls' school) throughout the year. Mr. Ozanne reports a decline in the number of boys—possibly owing to the in creased efficiency of the local Persian schools; but the number of girls taught continues to increase steadily. The curriculum for the girls is being gradually expanded and made more practical—and pupil teachers are now being instructed in proper Educational methods. (V) Dr. G. E. Dodson and Dr. Mary Price were in charge of the medi cal side of the Mission—which as usual did excellent work, ihe number of in-patients has risen to 621 from 581 in 1925, 565 in 1924 and 447 in 1923; wiiile 1,755 patients were attended to in tile course of Dr. Dodson's and Dr. Price's summer tour. The new men's Hospital was opened during the year. 4. British and British-Protected Firms. —The following are the British and British-protected firms working in Kerman :— The Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, Ltd., Kerman, Messrs. H. S. Tavshanjian. Messrs. A. and M. Karagheusian American Corporation for the Overseas. Messrs. B. Kazanjian and Co. Messrs. Costikyan and Co, Messrs. Wetli Co., Ltd. Messrs. Bardwil Brothers. Messrs. Atiyeh Brothers. In the course of the year the North-West India Trading Co., and Messrs. S. Telfeyan closed down. A new firm calling itself the ^Standard Carpet Company' has begun to do business in Kerman. The total value of carpets and rugs exported during the years 1925 and 1926 were as follows (approximately): — The Carpet industry this year, unlike last year, has had no political difficulties to contend with. But the frade is having a none too easy time of it. The whole question will be dealt with in detail in the Annual Trade Report. 5. Political Interests of the Consulate. —It has been a quiet and un eventful year—unlike 1924 and 1925. The complete detaclfynent of H. M.'s Consulate from local affairs and politics, such as the Elections, is now an accepted fact. But I think it may be said with truth that the prestige of the Consulate has not suffered in the slightest degree as a result of that. The queer and incalculable behaviour of the Soviet Consul who occasionally bursts into local politics, merely accentuates out position which if not so intriguing as that of the Soviet Consulate is at any rate more consistent, dignified and intelligible. 6. Communications and Security. —Except for a short period in the summer when traffic on the Kerman-Duzdab road'w^as suspended owing to the trouble in the Sarhad; and for some local disturbance in Narmashir in the autumn when a robbery took place on the Bam-Kerman road, there was general security for travellers and merchandize throughout the year. The failure of the Amnieh to pay the road guards on the desert track from Bam to Sipi has to be recorded. The men are constantly in arrears and discontented owing to the efforts of the Amnieh department to enforce some kind of discipline on them. Kerman • arpets and rug's Tribal rugs 1925. Krari^ 8,327,000 „ 422,000 1926. 8,948,01)0 385/ 0023 Post, —The Provincial Director of Posts, Kerman, invited tenders in the summer for a biweekly postal service to Ispahan to begin on October 6th, but nothing more has been heard of the idea. A speeding up of t e postal service in that direction is greatly needed. On the other hand the postal service between Kerman and Duzdab continues to function with wonderful speed and regularity^ Letters take as many weeks to reach Tehran as they take days to reach Duzdap. B. Local Government and Politics. 7. Local Officials. Governor-General. —The office was vacant at the beginning of the year. On February 22nd H. E. Mirza Nizam-u in Khan Hikmat took over charge. He never settled down in Kerman and soon involved himself in difficulties with the Officer Commanding and v e Central Government over the Elections. He left on the 29th April and was succeeded by H. E. Mirza Taqi Khan who remained in the appoint ment till the end of the year. He is a pleasant gentleman, but colourless; he has done nothing in Kerman except make money over the Elections. He has no standing among the local officials and is quite ineffective. Finance Department .—Mr. P. J. Fitzsimmons, who remained m charge of the Finance Department during the year, received material sup port in his campaign against corruption by the arrival of an Assistant Mirza Humayun Khan Sayyah in the month of May. Sayyah is reported to be efficient, energetic and absolutely honest. He and Mr. Fitzsimmons between them have succeeded in discovering many sources of corruption, and increasing the Provincial revenues by a considerable amount—possibly as much as 33 per cent. Employes of the department have been dismissed or suspended in large numbers; and those that remain, deprived of their former earnings, are hanging on till the day comes when the American Director goes and the old regime returns. Opium. —Mr. Fitzsimmons has waged energetic war against opium smuggling also, and 1 has delivered some shrewd blows to this tradesome of his victims being 2 of the newly appointed deputies (!) and a well known Mujtahid of Khabis. If this campaign continues with equal success the cultivation of opium is bound to decrease. The following interesting figures which I got from Sayyah, illustrate the extent of the smuggling business in Kerman and the appalling loss which it inflicts on Government revenues: State revenue for excise opium in Kerman town—20 Tomans a day at (roughly) kran 1 per misqal. That is 200 misqals pay duty. Amount of opium actually smoked (or eaten) in Kerman a day —approximately 12,000 misqals—which would pay duty of 1,200 Tomans a day if not smuggled. Daily loss to Government in Kerman town alone is therefore anything in the neighbourhood of Tomans 1,200 a d^y = say, at least £200 a day, or £6,000 a month. Survey. —Three survey officials arrived from Tehran during the year to conduct the revenue survey of the Province. They are hard at work and have nearly completed the survey of Kerman town, and Rafsinjan. Large increases in the Provincial revenues are already anticipated as a result of these operations. Mr. Fitzsimmons is personally popular with all classes, hard-working ? accessible, impartial. His attitude towards this Consulate has always been one of sincere friendliness. Karguzari. —Amir Yagana left Kerman on 4th April and was suc ceeded as Karguzar early in June by Muayid Huzur. The latter gentle man has proved himself so far to be a decided improvement on Amir Yagana, being more energetic, and less afraid of responsibility. He has been able to clear off many of the outstanding claims which Yagana had been reluctant to tackle effectively.24 Police.- -Yavar Ali Khan, the Rais Nazmieh, who had earned good opinion from everyone in Kerman by his unusual honesty and his refusal to mix in other jobs but his own, was recalled to Tehran in the summer. Justice. —No change from last year. Education. —Sayyid Tajuddin Khan, formerly Headmaster of the Government School, became head of Education and Auqaf department in the autumn, Ansari having left Kerman owing to ill health in August. The new Rais-i-Muarif seems to be an enthusiast, and has already sent teachers to open up schools in Jiruft, Rudbar, and Persian Baluchistan (Bampur itself being one of the places chosen). A mniyeh. —This department was in charge of Sarhang Kaivan Mirza for most of the year, and since he came Kerman has been part of a large area, including Yezd, Bandar Abbas and Duzdap, which is one administra tive unit. The men are fairly regularly paid. Telegraphs. —Mirza Hadi Khan 'Darwish' took over charge of this department at the end of March from Ghulam Ali Khan 'Kashi', who was a dishonest and corrupt rogue. 'Darwish' is pleasant and inoffensive. New Persian telegraph offices were opened during the year at Sirjan and Baft. The Telegraph Master received instructions from Tehran early in the year to submit proposals for constructing telegraph lines from Bam to Jiruft and Bam to Duzdap; and complied. But he has heard nothing more on the subject. Administrative Committee. —Early in the year orders were received from Tehran for the formation of a Committee composed of local officials to sit weekly and discuss matters of general interest and other matters referred to them by the Central Government. 8. Local Politics. Elections. —After scandalous delays, barefaced bribery, substitution of votes, burning of boxes, coercion, and every sort of intrigue, unparalleled (it is said) even in Kerman, the so-called 'free' elec tions for the 6th Majlis at last came to an end during the year. The suc cessful candidates were as follows :— Kerman town and environs . Haji Mirza Murfceza and Mirza Abdul Hueeain. Rafsinjan and Zerind . . Mirat-us-Sultaneh, son of Sardar Nusret. Sirjan, Aqta and Bardsir . . Nasr-ud-Dauleh Badr. Jiruft and Rndbar . , . Ata-ul-Mulk. Bam and Narmashir . . . Mukhtar-ul-Mulk. Baluchistan . . . Diwan Begi. The Shah. —The Coronation was celebrated in Kerman in the Spring with every outward appearance, if not of enthusiasm, at any rate of cordia lity. But by the end of the year, the public attitude towards His Majesty has undergone a decide 1 change. The hopes that were entertained one year ago, of progress of the people and the country have wilted and died. The general feeling now is one of disillusion and hopelessness, and of com plete uncertainty as to the future of the present regime. Reza Khan has been forgotten. The Shah is regarded almost with the same indifference as the Kajar Shahs of old. 1 he Pi ess. Rais-ul-Mutakallimin continues to produce his useful and well managed weekly paper, IstaqamcLt, with commendable resrularitv During the year 3 new periodicals of a more or less ephemeral character werestarted -.—the Nadd-i-Kermm, Sadd-i-Kerman, and Avma-i-Junub. The Bidan also appeared occasionally. The Habl-ul-Matin after a long period of welcome silence made its re appearance in Kerman towards the close of the year Its 'policy of spreading anti-British poison appears to be unchanged. But that l ind o f propaganda has nothing like the effect it had 2 years ago. 0. Health and General Wei fare.—Dr. Dodson of the C. M. S. Mission i eports that Kerman has been free from any extensive epidemic during the25 year—nor ha^ fche incidence of the endemic diseases such as typhoid, dysen tery, small-pox been greater than usual. It is encouraging to learn that the prevalent occupational diseases of rickets and tuberculous joint disease (which claim child weavers for their victims) are definitely less common than they w T ere a decade ago. I he standard of living, however, is deplorably low among the poorer classes: extreme poverty and under nourishment both in towp and country seem to be more marked than before; and the high cost of living due to increased taxation (especially of sugar and tea) has hit everybody. 10. Russian Activities, (a) Political.—M. Laktionoff has on the whole been very quiet during the year. He is said to have interfered a great deal on the Socialist side—(a forlorn hope)—during the Elections; and the Governor- General (Hikmat) likened him bitterly to a worm eating into a ripe apple. But the worm has not had much of a meal this year. He had his little hoar of triumph when the Kerman ''Wireless' installation (built under Rus- Man supervision but destined, I should imagine, never to be used) was erect- e m the autumn. Socially he came out of his shell in a remarkable way summer, and appeared at most public and semi-public functious Whenever we met thus, on neutral ground, M. Laktionoff was polite and inendly. He maintained his attitude of refusal to come to this Consulate. - ( ommerc/ia l- The Soviet Consulate did very little this year except m the autumn, to import large quantities of loaf sugar with the obiect it is i 1 -fl P T e i of un( | ei ' s e llln g the local market.

The relations between the Persians and Mir Din Mahomed were friend ly when the year closed. G wadur. Lai Khan was British Agent at Gwadur throughout the year. Visits. —His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, accompanied by his ad viser, Mr. Thomas, came to Gwadur for a short stay in the month of June 1926. Sikandar Effendi, Director of Muscat Customs came to Gwadur in Oc tober and after a fortnight's stay left for Muscat. He issued a notice to the effect that the Sultan's subjects should in future obtain Identity Cer tificates from the Customs or from the Wali of Gwadur and not from the British Agent. The matter was referred to the Resident and orders re ceived that the Identity Certificate so issued should be visaed by the British Agent and a fee of rupee one charged.

He appears to be anxious to please the Persian brovernment also. He paid 2,500 tomans in taxes this year, sending the money to Bandar Abbas. g ^ (2) J ask District. —Mir Mustafa Khan continues to control this dis trict, assisted by his son Mir Morad Khan. ri.

There are 27 riflemen of the Persian Army in the Jask fort, commanded by a junior Lieutenant. A detachment of 58 riflemen of the Persian Army, with one machine- gun, 3 horses, and four mules, arrived overland from Kerman on the 29th i ovember, to escort the Line Inspection party of the Officer in Charge, Jask feub-Lhvision from Jask to Charbar.

(3) The Dasht of the Bint District. —This district, from Maliki Chid- iri, t0 a i under Nagdi Khan, who is assisted by the sons of Islam llhan, Ayub Khan and Yah Yah Khan. The subsidies for the protection ot the lines are still drawn by Nagdi Khan and Ayub Khan. Since last year Nagdi Khan has been sending to Dost Mahomed at Bampur the taxes collected by himself and Ayub Khan. The Karawani tribes do not pay taxes, but are said to have agreed to assist Nagdi Khan and Avub Khan if they are attacked by any other chief. (4) The Dasht of the Geh District—This district from Balband to the 2 hills is still administered by Sardar Hussain Khan, who appears to be carrying on his affairs quite satisfactorily.

MM Agenc, a.d C.ute CSI'.,29 February when he was relieved by Major C. C. J. Berrett, C.S.I., C.I.E., who held charge till the 9th September. Mr. G. A. Richardson, O.B.E., H.B.M.'s Consul, Bunder Abbas, was temporarily in charge of the Agency and Consulate from 10th to 22nd Sep tember when he was relieved by Major G. P. Murphy, I. A., who conti nued to hold charge till the close of the year. Captain J. N. Madan, I.M.S. (T. C.) Military Medical Officer was Agency Surgeon, Muscat, throughout the year. Foreign Consulates. —The French Consulate remained closed through out the year. The Political Agent has remained in charge of American Consular duties throughout the year. Ruling family. —His Highness the Sultan returned to Muscat from Dhofar on H. M. S. 'Triad' on the* 31st January. He proceeded to India in July and returned to Muscat on the 22nd December. In May His Highness visited Sohar accompanied by Mr. Thomas in R. I. M. S. 'Netravati' returning to Muscat on 13th June. In July His Highness accompanied by Mr. Thomas proceeded to Gwadur by S. S. 'Bankura' and, spent a fortnight there before proceed ing to India. His Highness received the dignity of an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire on His Majesty the King Emperor's Birthday. Saiyid Saeed, His Highness' son, has continued his studies at the Mayo College, Ajmer, and has spent his College vacations in Muscat. In May he travelled overland to Sohar and joined his father there returning to Muscat in June. He has been well reported on by the College authorities. His Highness, however, intends withdrawing him from the Mayo College in April next and proposes sending him to some Arabic school. ' In December Saiyid Hamad, His Highness' brother and Wali of Sohar, paid a visit to the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast. He stated that his pur pose was to discuss with them the question of the slave traffic. At Shargah he was not a welcome visitor but in Dubai he was well received. Saiyid Nadir, His Highness' eldest half brother and President of the Council of Ministers, took 4 months' leave in June. He spent it in Muscat and did not return to his post after the expiry of his leave. He is unwil ling to resume his duties and wants an increased allowance. Saiyid Ali bin Faisal one of His Highness' half brothers and Secretary to the Council of Ministers is addicted to drink. On one occasion, whilst intoxicated, he made an attack on Saiyid Nadir who promptly had him arrested and confined in Fort Jelali. He was released after some days on the intervention of other family members and the Wali of Mattrah. Council of Ministers. —Saiyid N^idir President of the Council while on leave was replaced by Saiyid Mahomed bin Ahmed, Wali of Mattrah, who has continued to act in the post till the close of the year. Finance. —Mr. B. S. Thomas, O.B.E., has continued as Finance Minis ter throughout the year. On the whole the finances of the State appear to be in a satisfactory condition. The continued absence of rain in the interior is having an adverse effect on trade and thereby increasing the difficulty of Mr. Thomas' task to make both ends meet. The State Motor Cruiser £&lt; A1 Saiyidiyeh' which had cost about Rs. 60,000 was sold for Rs. 10,000 to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and a coal burning Steam Launch 'General Ellis' ^as purchased for Rs. 35,000 and has been renamed 'Al Saeed'. It is hoped that this launch will ensure a stricter control of outlying customs posts. J 530 Mr. Iskander has continued to hold the post of Director General of Customs. He was absent on leave for three months during the year. The Anelo-Persian Oil Company's geologists completed their survey in January. The results iippear to have been disappointing though their report has not been communicated here. The geologists experienced no trouble throughout their tour and were received and treated well every- Trihes of the Sultanoite. —No trouble of any importance was'reported from Sur during the year.. Major Barrett when he visited bur in April in H. M. S. 'Crocus' was not impressed very favourably and thought the authority of the Muscat State was very weak there. The ransom mbney of the Hindu Brahman cook referred to in the last year's report was paid by the Amir of Jaalan. The Hakmani is a power- iul tribe and evidently the Amir was afraid to enforce payment out of Affairs in Oman. —A reference was made in the last year's report to Ibn Sand and collection of 'Zakat' by him from Baraimi district. This year also he sent his Agent and 30 Fidavis to collect Zakat from the A1 Nairn, A1 bu Shamis, Bani Qutub and otjiers. It was stated that these tribes invited him to do this as they are afraid of Shaikh Isa bin Saleh the leader of the Hinawi tribe and as these tribes are bunnis and Ghafiris they are inclined to Ibn Sand for his protection. Sulaiman al Baruni the Tripolitan agitator referred to in last year's report returned to Muscat from Oman in March and in June he proceeded to Samail at the invitation of Imam Mahomed bin Abdullah. He has since remained with the Imam as Financial Adviser. There has been no indication of hostility between the Muscat Govern ment and the Imam and their relations have been carried out 4 in a cordial manner. Missionary Enterprise. —Dr. L. P. Dame of the American Mission visited the Batinah Coast and Samail during the year. He opened a tem porary dispensary at Sib where he was well patronised by patients from the interior. Arms Traffic. —-No arms were imported during the year under report except for the personal use of His Highness the Sultan and his Ministers. Slave Trade. —20 slaves petitioned this Agency for freedom during the year of whom 16 were granted freedom after investigation of their cases. Registration of British Subjects. —195 British subjects and 274 British protected persons were registered during the year. Date crop of the year though less in quantity was slightly better in quality than the previous year and the prices were higher by about 25 to 30 per cent. The price per Bahr of 200 Muscati maund of 1,800 lbs. was from Rs. 150 to 170 according to quality as against Rs. 75 of the previous year. Owing to a poor crop of dates from Basra there was a greater demand from India the Red Sea and America with consequent higher prices. The depreciation in value of the silver dollar has had a detrimental effect on trade. The rate of dollar varied during the year from Rs. 181-8-0 to Rs. 127-8-0 per $100. The average price per f 100 was as under:— where. them. January 179-0, February 156-9, July 147-0, August 143-0. March 143-0, April 142-8, May 149-0, June 150-0, September 144-13 October 132-11. November 135-3. December 130-0.31 Muscat Infantry. —Captain G. J. Eccles was in Command of the In fantry from 1st January to 15th May when he was relieved by Captain R. W, G. Stephens who continued in Command till the end of the year. An unfortunate incident took place in January when a sepoy ran amok and after wounding another sepoy ran away to the hills at night with his rifle and ammunition. He was traced the next morning and attempts were made to capture him when he opened fire and killed another sepoy. While he was thus engaged Captain Eccles bravely walked up to him from behind and having coaxed him took charge of his rifle and promising to save his life brought him to the barracks and put him in the quarter guard. He was tried by the Council of Ministers an y d was, at the recommendation of Captain Eccles, sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in the fort at Sohar. The Agency Indian guard detachment was withdrawn towards the end of March and has been replaced by a detachment from the Muscat Infantry. The corps is well disciplined. Climate. —The total rainfall for the year amounted to 2'86 inches as against 2 20 inches last year. CHAPTER VIII. ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE TRUCIAL COAST OF 'OMAN FOR THE YEAR 1926. Personnel. —Khan Bahadur Isa bin Abdul Latif continued as Residency Agent. Slave Trade. —Eight negro slaves were manumitted during the year. Two Baluchis kidnapped from the Mekran Coast were also liberated; and one Hedjazi, captured by Ibn Sa'ud's troops in a fight at Medinah, was sold at Qatar, and escaped from his master near Lingah, where he took refuge and was freed. Three Hindu boys, British Indian subjects, kidnapped from Karachi, brought to Gwadur and sold into slavery on the Trucial Coast, were re covered and repatriated. Criminal action is being taken in Karachi against two Mohammedan British Indian subjects concerned in the offences. Attempts are being made to trace a fourth Hindu boy reported to have been similarly kidnapped and sold into slavery. Pearl Fishery. —The bad fishery of 1925 and the poor market for pearls resulted in a scarcity of money at the beginning of the 1926 season, and the divers and haulers were with difficulty provided with the necessary supplies. A meeting was held at which it was settled that divers should receive Rs. 100 and two bags of rice and haulers Rs. 70 and one bag of rice, as against the normal figures of Rs. 400—600 for divers and Rs. 200—300 for haulers. The fishery started on the 4th July and, owing to a scarcity of pearls and no improvement in the market, was very baxl. An average boat's earnings were 40 per cent, less than in the previous year. Some divers, therefore, arranged to dive on the pearl banks of Sokotra Island, and Dahlak Island^ off the coast of Eritrea. Fourteen boats left Debai on the 21st November for the Red Sea, as the Italian Government notified that they had no ob jection. Relations with Nejd. —Ibn Sa'ud has not outwardly been so active in 1926 as in 1925 in encroaching towards Trucial 'Oman, but in February it was reported that the Amir of Hasa had sent out police to Shargah' in pursuit of a Nejdi subject, wanted for murder in Nejd. The man had, however, prudently fled elsewhere. The Nejdi slave dealers showed increased activity, and it was clear that the Trucial Shaikhs were afraid to tackle them.32 Isa bin Saleh negotiated a treaty with the Shaikh of Debai at the begin- iiing of the year, binding the latter (and allied Trucial bnaikhs.) to aid him if Ibn Sa'ud became aggressive. Relations with Muscat. —Saiyid Hamad bin Faisal, brother of the Sultan, Wali of Sohar, visited Trucial 'Oman with the exception of Abu Dhabi, in November and December to discuss and dispose of outstanding questions, e.g., the kidnapping of Muscat subjects by the Bani Kaab and Sharqivin tribesmen, who are technically under the Qawasim Shaikhs. He suggested to the Shaikh of Debai that he should post an agent in Debai to look after the affairs of divers from the Batinah district, but the Shaikh did not agree. Shargah. —On the 11th June the Senior Naval Officer went to Ras-ul- Khaimah to communicate the Government of India's orders in connection with the attempt to'murder the Residency Agent in the preceding autumn. The Shaikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah, however, refused to surrender Abdur Rahman for fear of the consequences to himself, and the Shaikh of Debai was then summoned to assist in the discussion, and finally Abdur Rahman surrendered himself on board H. M. S. 'Triad' unconditionally, and was sent to Aden. The orders of the Government of India were that Abdur Rahman, Headman of Hairah, should be banished to Aden for four years and maintained there-by the Shaikh of Shargah, and that the latter should also pay Rs. 3,000 to the Government of India as a fine, and 800 Maria Theresa dollars to the family of Ibrahim bin Rajab, the murdered man, as blood money. These orders were duly obeyed by the Shaikh. Ever since the bombardment of Fujairah fort in 1925 there has been trouble between the Headman of that place and the Headman of Kalba, the former accusing the latter of having instigated the British authorities to bombard his fort. The Residency Agent tried to get one Qazi after another to mediate, as both parties were nominally subject to the Shaikh of Shargah, but without success. Finally the Headman of Kallah appealed to the Wali of Sohar in Muscat. The Sutlan, who shortly afterwards toured on the Shumailiyah Coast, volunteered to arbitrate, and the Shaikhs of Ras-ul- Khaimah and Umm-ul-Qaiwain were called in to the discussions. Finally a deed of settlement was signed on the basis of bygones being bygones, and of no annoyances to take place from either side in future. In spite of this, some three months later, Fujairah reverted to its harassment of Kalbah, whereupon the Headman of Kalbah appealed to the Shaikh of Shargah to send him help, but the Shaikh does not know how to send reinforcements by land, as the Shaikhs of the interior, through which his men must march, are friendly to the Sharqiyin of Fujairah: to do so by sea would be against the Trucial Coast Treaty. Debai. —All has been quiet in Debai during the year. The Shaikh has been very helpful generally in dealing with the attempt on the life of the Residency Agent. Abu Dhabi. —On the 4th of August Shaikh Sultan bin Zaid invited his brother Saqar to supper. The latter on arrival shot the Shaikh dead. The reason given for the murder is that the Shaikh from the time of his accession paid no subsistence allowance to his brothers or sisters. Saqar also tried to murder the Shaikh's sons, but they escaped and took refuge with the Naimi (A1 bu Shamis) Shaikh of Baraimi. \Saqar bin Zaid was accepted as Shaikh and recognized as such by Government. The sons of the murdered Shaikh left Baraimi later and visited Debai and Shargah, and later Bahrain, no doubt with the idea of obtaining assistance to oust their uncle. The latter, however, arrested their maternal uncle, Shaikh Hamad bin Butti, Chief of the Qubiat tribe, and accused him of instigat ing them to cause trouble. Ras-ul-Khaimah. The attitude of the Shaikh was not good during the investigation following the attack on the Residency Ap-ent and he has been warned to mend his ways and cease intriguing, Umm-ul-Qaiwain. ) at Ajman j —Nothing to report.33 CHAPTER IX. ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHREIN FOR THE YEAR 1926. Personnel. —Charge of the Political Agency was held: — From January 1st to September 13th by Major C. K. Daly, C.I.E. From September 14th to December 31st by Major C. C. J. Barrett, C.S.I., C.I.E. ^ ' The Ruler of Bahrein and Al Khalifah Family. —The attitude of Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali towards the Political Agent is correct though not friendly. He paid a call on me on my first arrival and I returned the call. He called again on New Year's Day, when he was slightly more cordial than on the first occasion. Shaikh Sir Isa has now consented to receive the allowance made to him from State funds. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad's relations with his father have shown a distinct improvement, during the year. He relies very considerably on his brother Shaikh Abdulla's advice. The latter has been very helpful to the administration during the three and half months I held charge of the Agency. He is a man of considerable ability and it is a pity he is not more trustworthy. Some of the junior members of the Al Khalifah have been employed in appointments of lesser importance in the administration and it is hoped that the members of this family who now draw allowances without giving any return may, in the future, be employed in such posts as are found to be suited to their somewhat limited education. The relations of the Deputy Ruler himself with the Political Agency have at all times been extremely friendly. He never hesitates to apply to the Political Agent for advice in all matters of administration in which he feels that he may need it. This advice is freely given when asked, but it has been my consistent policy to make Shaikh Hamad stand on his own feet instead of leaning heavily on the Political Agent for support in all matters, as has been his tendency in the past. I think the excellent instruction re ceived from,Major Daly is bearing fruit and that in course of time Shaikh Hamad may develop into a really capable Arab Ruler of an Arab State, purged of the abuses, especially in relations to its Shiah subjects which dis graced Bahrein in the past. On the night of 13th October at 8 o'clock when His Excellency Shaikh Hamad was driving in his car to visit his wife at Bada, four shots were fired at him, but the would-be assassins missed their aim. A reward of Rs. 8,000 was offered to anyone who would give reliable information which would lead to the arrest of the culprit, but the offenders are still undetected. Shaikh Mohamad bin Isa Al Khalifah left for Bombay on 18th Nov ember for treatment of his eyes one of which had a bad cattaract while the other appeared to be affected. Bahrein State. —Mr. C. D. Belgrave arrived from England via Basrah on 31st March and took up the appointment of Adviser to the Bahrein State. He has been unceasing in his efforts to improve the various departments of the State under his supervision and as a result of the Deputy Ruler's wil- lingness to take the advice offered a g'eneral improvement of the adminis tration is noticeable. Relations between the Sunni and Shiah inhabitants of the islands con tinued to improve and about August the two hitherto irreconcilable sects combined to oppose the introduction of certain reforms in the administra tion of the Waqfs and Minor estates, which the Bahrein Government had deseed to effect. After consulting the Sunni and Shiah Qadhis Shaikh Hamad decided that the time was not yet ripe for the introduction of the retorms which, however beneficial in themselves were strongly opposed by the public opinion of all his subjects. 1 1 184 At its commeiicement the work of the Land met with considerable opposition as its object wa ® '^g been opposition has gradually been overcome and conside a P » ^ rrfif t] v made. A large* number of new title deeds with maps d f scale have been prepared and given to litigants m cases e 0 The year unfortunately proved a bad one for the pearling industry and some bankruptcies have resulted and there has been is ress amon a e poorer classes. Consequently in December the Bahrein Governmen issue a moratorium deferring the collection of debts due to the s op eepers y ivers until the commencement of the diving season of 1927. The Salifah Court, the abolition of which caused a certain amount of resentment in Bahrein and on the Trucial Coast, was re -established at the close of the year. Measures were taken, however, to prevent a return to the bad old system by which a single Nakhuda sitting as judge weighted he scales of justice in favour of his own fraternity. The Court now consists of four members one of whom, is himself a diver, with an intelligent mem er of the ruling family named Rashid bin Mohamad A1 Khalifa as presi en . It is hoped that this reformed Court which certainly possesses all the neces sary technical knowledge will deal out speedy and even handed justice m all diving suits. The work of boring to tap the underground supply of water was very successful and 14 wells have now been sunk, 7 at Manama and seven at Muharraq. These give a plentiful supply of drinkable water and are an immense boon to the inhabitants and a fitting crown to the labours of Major Daly in the matter. The work of continuing the sea wall to the east of the Customs pier has made fair progress and should be completed in the first half of 1927. No Municipality has yet been established in the town of Muharraq. The Persian school has made excellent progress and the boys are taking eagerly to football and other forms of exercise. The Arab school, bowevei', dcSs not show much progress. It is hoped that some time during 192/ the services of an experienced Educational Adviser may be obtained to place Arab education on a better basis. The girls' school maintained by the American Mission still attracts Jews and Indians. The average number of pupils attending during the year has been twenty-two. The American Mission also maintains a Boys school under the supervision of Mr. Hakken. The average number of boys attending has been 21. Bahrein State Levy Corfs and Police Force. —Captain T. H. Geake, Commandant of Levy Corps left for India on the 30th June to rejoin his regiment. On 1st August an attempt was made by members of the Police force to assassinate Haji Salman the Bahreini Head of the Police Force and on 4th August Ismail bin Shah Murad a sepoy of the Levy Corps shot at and wounded the Subedar Niaz Ali Khan and Havildar Noor Dad, both of whom subsequently succumbed to their wounds. The same man also wounded Major C. K. Daly, C.I.E., the Political Agent. As a result of these murders and the attempt to murder Haji Salman, the Bahrein Levy Corps, which was very largely composed of Baluchis was disbanded and the sepoys as well as the Baluchi members of the Police Force were repatriated during the month of August. Mr. C. D. Belgrave, Adviser to the Bahrein State left for India on 3rd November to supervise the enlistment of recruits for a new Bahrein Police Force which it was decided should have a strong nucleus of ex-sepoys and Policemen from the Punjab. The pay and terms of service offered had the effect of attracting many recruits and Mr. Belgrave returned on 11th De cember bringing fifty-four men with him, while 39 persons from the former Police Corps remained in the service at the end of the year. Captain L. S. Parke arrived on 13th November to take command of the new force.35 • The year has unfortunately been distinguished by a large number of murders and robberies. , After the murder of Subedar Niaz Ali and the consequent disband- ment of the Levy Corps a series of outrages on villages in the islands occur red. The perpetrators have not yet been brought to book, but the suspicion which at first rested on sepoys of the disbanded Levy appears to have been unfounded. The outrages appear to have been the work of a gang of Hasawi desperadoes, encouraged by the general feeling of nervousness en gendered by the incidents of 4th August, and the temporary disappearance of any armed and disciplined body from the islands. The arrival of His Majesty's Ships 'Triad' and 'Cyclamen' and the landing of Naval parties at the Agency restored a certain amount of confi dence which was increased by the arrival on 18th September of a Detach- ment of 3/16th Punjab Regiment under Lt. E. C. Robinson. The lawless ness however still continued and culminated in an attempt on the life of Shaikh Hamad on 13th October and a determined attack on Sanabis village on 3rd November in the course of which one villager was killed while one of the attackers who appeared to be a Hasawai was shot dead and one wound ed. As a result of this attack a small irregular force of Arabs for service outside the town of Manama was raised and. placed under the command of Ali Qumri at one time Amir of Manama. Since the institution of this force there have been no more outrages. Trade. —Trade has, in general, been depressed as a result of the fall in the pearl market upon which the prosperity of Bahrein almost entirely depends. Some bankruptcy and distress have resulted among the smaller traders. The import of motor cars continues steadily. There are in all about 140 cars including four motor Iprries plying in the islands. The majority of these are Fords but some merchants are contemplating the import of the more expensive higher power types, mainly American. An interesting development in native craft is the application of a British Marine Engine, the Kelvin, to the locally built craft. There are 14 such craft working commercially and several of these are engaged exclu sively on cargo work with the mainland. Shijypina .—The number of visits paid by ships to the port of Manama during the year was as folows : — British 103. German 7. There was a regular weekly mail service from India and a fortnightly service from Iraq to India. Judicial. —The number of civil suits filed in the Court of the Political Agent during the year was one thousand six hundred and seventy-seven. Three hundred and seventy-eight criminal cases were disposed of. In addi tion to this one hundred and eighty-six miscellaneous petitions were dealt with. The total number of petitions received during the year was two thousand two hundred and forty-one. Criminal cases were generally of common assault and theft. There was one case of murder and another of attempted murder. One man was deported during the year under the provisions of the Bahrein Order in Council. The cases of murder and of attempted murder were tried by Captain B. Stuart Horner, Additional Sessions Judge and Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The murderer Ismail bin Shah Murad was sentenced to death and was executed at 6-30 a. m . on 21st Sep tember by a firing party of 3/16th Punjab Regiment.

CHAPTER X. ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE KUWAIT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1926. P ersonnel. Major J. C. More, D.S.O., held charge of the Political Agency throughout the year. Assistant Surgeon J. W. Woodsell, M.C., I.M.D., was in Medical Charge of the Agency and Charitable Dispensary, and performed the duties of Quar antine Medical Officer from the beginning of the year till the 11th April, when he was relieved by Dr. C. S. G. Mylrea, O.B.E., of the American Mission. On 21st April Sub-Assistant Surgeon A. C. Malwade, I.M.D., took over the duties of Quarantine Medical Officer and Medical Officer in charge of the Charitable Dispensary. Dr. Mylrea remained in Medical Charge of the Political Agency until the end of the year, except from the 20th July till the 20th October, when Dr. E. T. Calverley, also of the American Mission, performed these duties.37 T he E xiling F amily. On the 29th June a son was horn to His Excellency Shaikh Ahmadal- Jabir as -Suhah, Ruler of Kuwait, by his cousin, a daughter of the late Shaikh Salim. Although they have been married for many years, this is the first son—and second child—born to them. The child has been named Jabir. Shaikh Jabir as-Subah, a brother of the late Shaikh Mubarak, died on the 24th September. The Shaikh visited Basrah by motor car on the 7th June, returning on the 9th June. On the 27th August he proceeded to Eao by launch to visit his estates on the Shatt al-'Arab, and returned on the 6th September. On both occasions Shaikh Hamad al-Mubarak officiated for him during his absence. najd, 1. The affairs of Najd naturally affect Kuwait very closely. On the 8th January the Sultan, Ibn Sa'ud, was elected King of the Hijaz. He declared however that the administration of it would be kept quite distinct from that of jSajd. 2. Soon after the fall of Jiddah at the end of 1925 many of the Ikhwan leaders returned to Najd. Some were bitterly disappointed that the Hijaz campaign had not offered better opportunities for amassing plunder. Notable amongst these was Eaisal ad-Dawish, the paramount shaikh of the Mutair tribe. No sooner had he arrived at Artawiyah, his headquarters, then he summoned his followers to prepare for a big raid against 'Iraq. Before he had time to set out, however, he received definite orders from Ibn Sa'ud forbidding him to proceed, and reluctantly disbanded his men. Ibn Eubai'an and Ibn^Shuqair also wanted to raid 'Iraq and Kuwait territory but were also forbidden. 3. In April Faisal ad-Dawish visited Sultan bin Humaid at Ghatghat. From there an invitation was sent to Dhaidan al-Hithlain of the 'Ajman, who joined them shortly afterwards. They then apparently took an oath binding themselves together for mutual support in the event of Ibn Sa'ud wishing to take punitive action against any of them. In the latter part of the year there was much talk about the strained relations between Ibn Sa'ud and the leaders of the Ikhwan, particularly the three mentioned above, who were much dissatisfied with Ibn Sa'ud's idea of organizing a civilized govern ment in the Hijaz and his prohibiting them from raiding across the frontier. One of their arguments was that if, as they maintain, the people of Kuwait, 'Iraq, etc., are not true Muslims, they ought to be allowed to fight against them; if, on the other hand, Ibn Sa'ud prohibits them from doing so, and says they are not enemies, he has no right to prevent them from trading with ^ em — as he still does in the case of Kuwait. A meeting of protest was apparently held in Artawiyah, and a deputation sent to Ibn Sa'ud, who sent back word that if they had any complaints they should meet him and discuss them when he came to Najd. 4. During the last two months of the year there were constant rumours that Ibn Sa'ud was shortly arriving at Qasim, where the meeting was expec ted to be held. The Shaikh of Kuwait wrote to him, saying that if he was making a long enough stay in Najd he would like to come and visit him, and asking him if this would be convenient, and if so where. His messengers went first to Qasim, where it was expected they would meet Ibn Sa'ud, but as he was still in Madinah they went on there. They arrived back in Kuwait on the 29th December, and said that when they left Madinah on the 6th, Ibn Sa'ud was expected to be leaving for Qasim via Hail almost immediately, and that a motor road was being prepared. In his letter to the Shaikh, however, Ibn Sa'ud said that at the moment he was occupied with certain negotiations with the British Government, but that when they were over, he purposed going to Eiyadh direct, and that he hoped to have the pleasure of seeing him before long either there, or in Kuwait, or on the Pilgrimage.38 5. The ostensible object of Shaikh Ahmad's proposed visit was to con gratulate Ibn Sa'ud on his success in the Hijaz, but the real object was to try and induce him to raise the embargo on trade with Kuwait. This embargo was strictly enforced throughout the year, and detachments were sent from time to time to prevent the order from being infringed, and to punish any Najdis caught doing so and confiscate their goods. Even so,, however, Najd tribesmen do still occasionally risk going into Kuwait for trade. It is rumoured too that the merchants of Qasim have petitioned Ibn Sa'ud for permission to trade with Kuwait, which is their natural port, as the embargo affects them almost as prejudicially as it does the merchants of Kuwait itself. C ondition op the C otjntrt. As a result of Ibn Sa'ud's prohibition against raiding the security in the desert round Kuwait was better than it had been for many years. On the 24th Eebruary a quarrel in which firearms were used occurred amongst thirteen members of the Hindal family of the Muhakkirah tribe of 'Iraq at Jalib ash -Shuyukh, a few miles from Kuwait, over the proposed marriage of a girl to a stranger. It resulted in the death of eight of the men, also of a woman who had nothing to do with the family, but was killed by a stray bullet. On the 17th June a party of raiders over five hundred strong, under Karab bin Hadhdhal (a nephew of Fahad Bey bin Hadhdhal) of the 'Anizah and Badr bin Mijlad, attacked the 'Uraif section of the Dhafir at Eumailah, some twenty eight miles west, north-west of Zubair. The 'Anizah drove off about sixty camels, but -themselves lost approximately the same number. Seven men who had formed part of the vanguard were cut off from the main body of the 'Anizah, and came into Kuwait and claimed the protection of Ibn Subah, to give the Shaikh of Kuwait his tribal title, on the strength of Ms 'Anizah blood. The Shaikh received them and gave them hospitality, and eventually dismissed them with the usual presents. On the 15th July these same seven 'Anizah, together with 'Ali Abn Shuwairibat and another man of the Mutair plundered seventy Kuwait camels while grazing at Quhaililah, twenty four miles west, south-west of Jahrah. When news of this reached Jahrah a party was sent in pursuit. It failed to come up with the robbers, but succeeded in recovering thirty of the weaker camels, which were unable to keep up. Of the others however, all except two which could not be identified were eventually recovered through the good offices of Karab bin Hadhdhal and Ibn Mijlad. . On the 11th, and again on the 13th August robbers fired on a party of workmen at Sabiyah who were collecting stone for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and loading it in boats for conveyance to 'Abbadan. On the second occasion they killed one man and wounded three. Two 'Awazim were subse quently arrested and convicted of participation in the crime. On the 1st August one Sulaiman al-Badawi attempted to murder Saiyid Hamid Bey an-Naqib between Jahrah and Safwan while on his way to Basrah in two motor cars, firing no less than eighteen rounds. Saiyid Hamid Bey and his party returned the fire, and the man eventually made off and escaped in the broken ground. He was afterwards arrested, and was found to be insane and ordered to be kept in confinement. On the 5th October a party of over two hundred men of 'Abdah Sham- mar refugees from Syrian territory under Shibrun bin Jabhan al-Waibar, 'Aid bin 'Aj'il and Mutni bin Jabrin raided Kabd, twenty-five miles south west of Kuwait, and got away with a large number of camels—the number was said to be 1,100, but this was probably an exaggeration. On their way back the raiders first camped at Busaiyah on the 6th October, where they were located by British aircraft on the morning of the 7th. The same day they proceeded towards Nuqrat Salman, but camped in the desert before reach ing there. They then split up into two parties under 'Aid bin 'Ajil and Shibrum bin JalDhan respectively. Both parties were attacked by aircraft on the morning of the 8th October, 'Aid lost about twenty men killed and was39 not heard of again until he reached his camp near Dair az-Zanr on the 7th November. Shibrum had four men and twenty camels killed. He then again divided his party into two, one under his own leadership and the other under Mutni bin Jabrin. The latter's party reached Nuqrat Salman that evening but were discovered and again attacked the next morning by aircraft, although they had tried to conceal themselves in the valleys near by, and lost t considerable number of camels. Shibrum's party took shelter in the bushes ten miles south of Nuqrat Salman and escaped detection. After the depar- aure of the aeroplanes Shibrum went on to Nuqrat Salman for water. There he found Mutni with only twenty men left, the remainder having been killed, or scattered for fear of the aircraft. Shibrum's party and the survivors of Mutni's party again joined forces and proceeded to the north-west. On the 16th October the Dahamishah, a sub-section of the 'Amarat section of the 'Anizah, waylaid them about a hundred miles to the west of Najaf. On the morning of the 20th October they saw two aeroplanes near Qulban al-Ma't (about 33° N. by 40° E.). Although the aeroplanes flew on towards Rutbah without attacking them they felt sure that they had been seen, and thought it wiser to split up into two parties again. One, under Shibrum retired some thirty miles to the east to the Wadi 'Amaj, while the other under Mutni con tinued the march. As they were crossing the Eutbah-Ramadi motor track, however, they encountered a mixed force of aircraft, armoured cars and police. Mutni with twelve of his followers fled, and the remaining nineteen surrender ed without fighting. The Government forces then went on to Wadi 'Amaj and called on Shibrum's party to surrender. Pour men did so, but the re mainder refused, and an engagement took place in which the raiders lost seventeen men killed. The remainder of the party escaped through the night. The raiders were again located and machine gunned on the 23rd October but there were few casualties. Later on Shibrum joined up with 'Aid bin 'Ajil again, but shortly afterwards the united party was attacked by the 'Uqaidat, a riverain tribe in Syrian territory, and lost over a hundred more camels and even their rifles. Altogether the raiders lost forty seven men killed, and twenty seven were captured. Over two hundred camels were restored to Kuwait. This vigorous action is already having a very great effect in the desert. M otor T ransport. The communications between Kuwait and 'Iraq were greatly improved during the year under review by the opening of a good motor road, and the establishment of an efficient motor service between Kuwait and Zubair. This has been done by the Kuwait—'Iraq Motor Transport Company formed by Saiyid Hamid Bey an-Naqib, to whom the Shaikh granted a concession in 1925 which gives him a monopoly of the carrying of passengers and goods by car for a period of fifty years. P earl F ishery. The Kuwait Pearling Pleet was timed to put to sea on the 21st May, but did not actually do so until considerably later owing to a strike amongst the drivers. Owing to the extremely bad season in 1925 the pearl merchants were short of ready money, and the financing of the fleet was a difficult matter. As a means of economizing, they proposed to give the men an im possibly small advance. After much talk it was decided to increase this to Rs. 120 per diver and Rs. 80 per hauler, and the Shaikh was reluctantly per suaded to fix this rate. The men, however, still refused to accept it, and a consi derable number absconded. Finally most nakhudas had to yield to the men's demands, and give larger advances. The season was quite one of the worst on record—there was no dearth of oysters, but few of them had anything in them. The pearl market too is extraordinarily bad, and at the end of the year the biggest merchant in Kuwait had two years' stock of pearls in hand. M edical. The health of the town was good on the whole, but tuberculosis continued to take its usual toll.

Farrell, A.G.C.I., A.M.I.C.E., Public Works Department, from 24th March till 26th November. Mr. E. T. Roch, Public Works Department, from 27th November. S ection 2. Foreign Representatives. French Consulate. —Monsieur le Commandant Trenga held charge. Norwegian Vice-Consulate. —The Political Resident was appointed to act, but his papers had not arrived by the end of the year. Russian Consulate-General. —The Consulate General remained closed throughout the year. Mirza Abdus Samad Khan, Assistant to the Consul- General for Fars, visited Bushire during the months August-September in connection with the repairs to the Consulate building. A certain Mirza Ismail of Bushire carried out the work of reporter to the Consul-General at Shiraz which place he also visited twice during the year. Dutch Consulate. —The French Consul remained in charge throughout the year. S ection 3. Local Government. Governor of the Gulf Ports. —Mirza Ahmad Khan Nekpai left for Bandar Abbas on a tour of inspection on the 4th of May and returned on the 6th July m410 (c) f&amp;pd/ \ 2 and shortly afterwards was recalled to Tehran for which place he left on the 22nd idem handing over acting charge to the Assistant Governor, Mirza Mehdi Khan Nashaki, who was relieved by the permanent incumbent, Mirza Guiam Ali Khan, Fntuhi, Muin-ul-Mulk, C.V.O., on the 21st September. The latter was Private Secretary to the ex-Shah and accompanied him to Europe on two occasions. He speaks French and some English, and, though a friendly and pleasant individual, is very weak in his administration. He has no influence with any of the heads of the other Persian Departments which he attributes to the fact of his having no official control over them; and this is to a great extent true. He has not been happy in his appoint ment here. Personally he is very amiable and has tried to please the Resi dency. Karguzar. —The Karguzari Courts were officially closed from the 7tli July and a separate Passport Office established for the issue of passports. Muhammad Ali Khan Muntassir, the Karguzar, therefore left for Tehran on the 22nd July and his assistant, Sadid-us-Saltaneh, was appointed as Pass port Officer. All work hitherto dealt with by the Karguzar's Court was transferred to the Governor's office, and until the end of the year there was no news of the re-establishment of the Adlieh Courts. Officer Commanding. —Naib Sarhang Muhammad Quli Khan Asad handed over command of the Bushire garrison to Sultan Ismail Khan and left for Tehran on the 13th July. Yawar Muhammad Ali Mirza from Shiraz assumed command on the 22nd August and he was again replaced by Yawar Aman- ullah Khan from Shiraz in the month of November. Finance Department. —Mirza Yahya Khan was replaced by Mirza Hassan Khan Farzad (Matin-us-Sultan) in October, the former having been charged with making various payments without sanction during Major Hall's visit to Bushire in December of the previous year. Matin-us-Sultan, who was educated in England, tried to keep on friendly terms with the Residency, but at the end of the year there were rumours of the Finance Office at Bushire being made independent of Shiraz to deal direct with Tehran, and of the appointment of a senior man. S ection 4. Military. The General Officer Commanding, Southern Division, passed through Bushire from Shiraz en route to Khuzistan in the month of January and returned the next month. In the month of March the Chief of the General Staff at Shiraz was report ed to have given out that he had arranged with the Dashti chiefs to surrender some 600 rifles, to take out licences for the arms remaining in their possession and to pay two years' taxation on their lands. He also claimed to have collected 2,000 rifles from the districts through which his column marched. Actually he appeared to have accomplished very little, and the only rifles surrendered were of old patterns. In the month of August 500 rifles which Shaikh Mazkur of Gabandi (Laristan) was said to have collected from his subjects were brought to Bushire; the rifles were all old. Early in April Fatullah Beg and Haider Beg and their followers at Daliki on tne Bushire-fehiraz road commenced to levy illegal exactions from mule teers and also wounded two Amnieh guards in the course of their activities. On the 17th a combined force from Bushire and Shiraz attacked and occupied Daliki and drove Fatullah and Haider Beg to the hills. In the month of June, however, Fatullah Beg was reported to have made his submission to the Military Commander at Borasjan and he was made Kalantar of Daliki. Haider Beg, with his followers, still remains in the hills. I he permanent feud between the Tangistanis and the Chahkutahis, in spite of occasional endeavours by the military to settle the dispute, continuedthroughout the year with occasioual attacks and casualties on both sides. In September the sons &lt; i the late Shaikh Hussain of Chahkutah murdere d their uncle Shaikh Abdullah with whom they had long been at enmity and whom they suspected of being in conspiracy with the Tangistanis. Shaikh Abdulla h's son was also killed. In December, however, Saiyid Murteza Ahrami, the notorious Mujtahid of Bushire, arranged a truce between the Tangistanis and the Chahkutahis. In the month of October the Mullahs c f Bushire received telegraphic requests from those of Ispahan and Shiraz to close the bazaars at Bushire as a protest against the enforcement of conscription. No action was, however, taken by them. The disposition of the forces in the Bushire area was estimated to be roughly as follows at the beginning and close of the j^ear :— Bushire. 1st January. 186 men. 31st December. 274 men. Chagadak .... 9 „ Borasjan 240 „ 11 „ Daliki .... .... 11 „ Behbehan 110 „ .... Dilwar .... 3 „ .... Lingah 21 „ • • • • and Dilam 3 „ Section 5. Aviation. Air routes. —In February the Air Officer Commanding, Baghdad, opened the question of a reconnaissance for a subsidiary air route along the southern or Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf. The Persian Government had not proved amenable with regard to the air route along the Persian coast and an alternative route was necessary, but the importance of a route which would not be subject to the caprice of the Persian Government or dislocation owing to war was obvious. In April th^ Political Resident nude a tour of the Persian Gulf in H. M. S. ' Triad.' Squadron-Leader Keith and Flight Lieutenant Switzer were appoint 3d by the Air Officer Commanding, Baghdad, to accompany him. Muscat, the Batineh coast, Khassab in the Mussandam Peninsula and the ports of the Ir icial coast were visited ; also the Island of Sar Bani Yas and Dohah, the port of Qatar. In May Squadron-Leader Keith with Flight Lieutenant Switzer and Dr» O'Brien of the Royal Air Force attempted a reconnaissance from Sohar on the Batineh coast of Oman to Abu Dhabi on the Trucial coast via Baraimi, a district in the interior. Mr. B. Thomas, the Wazir of Muscat, consented to accomp my them and the Sultan of Muscat gave them the necessary permis sion. The joarney promised well at the start, but local intrigues fostered by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and by Shaikh Isa bin Salih and El Baruni of Oman prevented full success being obtained. It is sbated that Saiyid Hamid, the brother of the Sultan of Muscat and Wali of Dohar, though outwardly very helpful, in private also intrigued against the project. The party when near- ing Baraimi w is pr3vented by the Baraimi tribes from continuing and had to take a line towards Mahadhar and finally came out at Shargah instead of Abu Dhabi. They however found an excellent aerodrome at Mahadhar. The Naimi of Baraimi have now come into Muscat and it is anticipated that there should be no difficulty if the attempt were made again. son at ?. - hIn November and December the Political Resident again proceeded on tour accompanied by Squadron-Leader Keith. On this occasion a recon naissance was made rather from a point of seaplanes than land planes. Ex cellent sea bases were found at Ras-al-Khaimah and Umm-al-Kowain. The lagoons at Shargah and Dibai, though suitable, are perhaps too much used by boats. The lagoon at Abu Dhabi would be excellent and there are other lagoons along the coast which would be suitable. The aeroplanes of H. M. S. ' Enterprise ' accustomed the tribes to the sight of aeroplanes and the Shaikhs who have seen them now have no objec tion to their returning. It is unnecessary here to deal more with the matter beyond stating that the Arab route has been shown to be perfectly feasible and only requires developing. On the political side, it is a matter for serious thought whether we should not tighten up our control in places on the Arab coast so as to provide an all red air route available at all times. Flights, —The Imperial Airways de Havilland Hercules aeroplane ' City of Delhi ' on its inaugural flight to India arrived at Bushire on the 3rd January carrying the Right Hon'ble Sir Samuel Hoare, Secretary of State for Air, Lady Maude Hoare, Air Vice-Marshal Sir W. Geoffrey Salmond, Mr. C. LI. Bullock, Mr. Woods Humphery, two pilots, mechanic, wireless operator, press photographer and batman. They left on the 4th and arrived at Karachi on the 7th having halted at Jask, Lingah and Pasni. The ' City of Delhi ' carrying the Secretary of State for Air, Lady Maude Hoare, with Sir Sefton Brancker also on board, on their return flight to England, arrived at Bushire on the 4th February and left the next day for Basrah. Messrs. Stack and Leete who arrived at Bushire on their Moths en route to India on the 26th December resumed their flight on the 4th and proceeded to Karachi with halts at Bandar Abbas, Jask and Charbar. Captain Sondermayer and Lieutenant Beydak, Servian Military aviators, on their return flight from India and on their way from Jask to Basrah, halted at Bushire for a brief time on the 3rd of May. A Dutch aeroplane from Aleppo landed at Bushire on the 3rd of October and proceeded to Karachi the next day. A Junkers aeroplane arrived from Tehran at Bushire en the 19th October on a trial trip in connection with air mail postal service between Tehran and Bushire and returned on the 22nd. The four flying boats comprising the Southampton Flight to the Far East alighted off Bushire on the 12th November and left on the 14th for Karachi with halts at Henjam and Gwadur. Captain W. N- Lancaster and Mrs. Keith-Miller on their flight to Australia arrived at Bushire on the 24th Novo mber. They were delayed by Magneto trouble and resumed their flight eastward on the 2nd December. Another Junkers aeroplane arrived at Bushire from Tehran on the 8th Pecember and returned the next day. S ection 6, Arrivals ^ Mirza Muhammad Ali Khan Faruki, Zaka-ul-Mulk, Minister of War, arrived at Bushire on the 9th April and left the next day for Shiraz. Sir Denys de Saumarez Bray, K.C.LE., C.S.I., C.B.E,, I.C.S., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, arrived at Bushire on the 2nd November and left for Bahrain the same night accompanied by the Political Resident and Captain Bazalgette. The party left Bahrain for Mohammerah on the night of the 4th where Sir Denya Bra^ caught the fast mail for India on the afternoon of the Qth,■*: 5|, si 5 S ection 7. Political situation. Politically, as regards Bushire, the year has been a quiet one. The anniversary of the Shah's coronation was celebrated at Bushire on the 25th April, when receptions were held in the morning by the Governor, Karguzar, and the Officer Commanding Troops, and in the evening the Governor gave a dinner followed by a display of fireworks. There was not very much enthusiasm in the town over these celebrations which certainly were on a much smaller scale than in the year 1926. The importance of the military also decreased a good deal during the year. No fuss was made at all by the Mullahs or others over the conscription ques tion, and the end of the year found nobody in Bushire very interested in politics. S ection 8. Trade and trade facilities. Trade. —This year the harvest was bad owing to locusts which did con siderable damage in Dashti and Dashtistan. In Ma'ashui and Hindijan the crops were untouched and so supplies for Bushire were assured. Trade generally was bad. This is in part due to the fiscal policy of the Persian Government in levying high customs duties and either accumulating the proceeds in Tehran or expending it in unproductive works in districts remote from Bushire with the result that the purchasing power of the people has considerably declined. In consequence demand has been very weak. This has had considerable effect on Bushire which is the distributing entrepot for a wide area. Communications. —The most noteworthy tendency of the year has been the increased participation of motor cars in the carrying trade on the Shiraz road. Rates of hire of cars have considerably fallen and cars have entered into competition with mule transport, which is suffering. Mechanical trans port is, however, not fully understood by Persians. In fixing their rates, the depreciation factor is often omitted and many will soon be faced with the cost of renewing their vehicles. Security. —South Persia is gradually becoming more and more insecure. Many robberies are reported from Bushire itself, while the Shiraz road is the scene of frequent robberies. On two occasions, possession of the village of Daliki has been in dispute between local chieftains and in consequence cara vans were held up. Several robberies of caravans took place just outside Bushire. It seems probable that the robbers were smugglers as this traffic has brought the tribal ' badmashes ' into closer relationship with the town. Postal Facilities. —Motor postal service between Borasjan and Bushire continued throughout the year and seemed to be well-run. Beyond Borasjan the mails were carried on mules to Shiraz. Haidar Khan Brahman, the Provincial Director of Posts, was relieved by Mirza Hussain Khan Shahruzi on the 8 th December; and the change is not an improvement as far as the Residency is concerned. Foreign Commercial Enterprise. —Herr Wassmuss has managed to survive the year, as the locusts left his farm untouched. He is, however, beginning to weary of his task owing to Persian obstruction. The German line (Hansa) has continued its service to the Gulf, but the amount of merchandise carried has not varied greatly. Despite continual rumours, the Russian steamship has so far not mate rialised. M410(c) f &amp;PD 1 liHitWIfcUpmMWIUfMOpium. —6,369 cases of opium were exported from Bushire in 1927, as against 7,894 in 1926 and 6,227 in 1925. Of the export of 1927, 3,559 cases were licensed and 2,810 unlicensed. With the measures taken for the suppression of opium traffic in India it is evident that greater purchases and therefore greater cultivation will be made in Persia. Enquiries are being made regarding supplies and unless real measures are taken in Persia to reduce cultivation there is little doubt that Persia will continue as a market for the illicit trade. The main traffic is in ships under the Chinese or Japanese flag. Appendix I. N ote on the working of the R esidency D ispensary and C haritable H ospital, B ushire, during the year 1927. Major M. A. Nicholson, I.M.S., was in charge till 1st May 1927 when ho proceeded on leave on termination of his tour and handed over to Major B. F. D. MacGregor, I.M.S. Major R. F. IX MacGregor, I.M.S., remained in charge till 2nd September 1927 when I took over on the former's transfer to Gilgit, Kashmir. Khan Bahadur Maula Baksh, I.M.D., was in sub-charge during the whole year. There was an increase of in-patient admissions during the year but the work is still hampered with the difficulties encountered by my predecessor, i.e., the want of suitable accommodation for the staff near the hospital. The out-patient attendances showed a small decrease. This may be accounted for by the fact that there were many changes in the Residency Surgeons, and also that Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh, I.M.D., was transferred to Shiraz for three months during the year. Financially the hospital accounts show an excess of expenditure over visible income of Krans 7,427*00. Tliis is a reduction on previous years' deficiencies and I am hoping to further reduce this figure during the current year and make the hospital finances stable. S tatement showing the expenditure and the visible receipts of the R esidency D ispensary and C haritable H ospital, B ushire, for the year 1927.

Report on the working of the Persian Quarantine Service in 1927. • • I. Inspection. —I inspected the ports of Bandar Abbas in November and Lingah in December 1927. II. Epidemics.— (1) Smoll-pox. —Sporadic cases occurred throughout the year, but not in serious proportions. (2) Cholera. —A small epidemic commenced at Basrah and spread to Abadan and Muhammerah. Another epidemic made its appearance at Minab, a town about 60 miles inland from Bandar Abbas, and spread to Bandar Abbas and thence down the coast to Lingah and its environs. A connection with the Northern epidemic was suspected but could not be proved. Basra. —Five cases bacteriologically proved on 23rd July 1927. Quaran tine was imposed on the same day. Abadan. —Oases of enteritis with deaths occurred in the Persian bazaar from 19th July 1927. Bacteriologically proved to be cholera on 24th July 1927. Quarantine was imposed on the same day. Total cases 281. Total deaths 239. Muhammerah. —First proved case occurred on 24th July 1927. Basrah was declared free on 12th November 1927. Quarantine was removed on the same day. Muhammerah and Abadan were free on 10th October 1927. Quarantine removed on 12th October 1927. Bandar Abbas. —Cholera reported at Minab on the 11th August 1927. First case is Quarantine Station among contacts arriving from Minab on 14th August 1927. Cholera inoculation commenced at Bandar Abbas on the appearance of the first case at Minab. Great difficulty was experienced in preventing influx of persons arriving by road from Minab. The Persian doctors from Tehran arrived at Bushire bv aeroplane on 23rd August 1927 and left for Bandar Abbas on 24th August 1927. Left for Minab on 1st September 1927 by sea. Epidemic at Minab suspected to be severe. No exact figures available. It is estimated that four to five thousand persons died at Minab (Annual Report of Quarantine Medical Officer). The cases at Bandar Abbas occurred amongst contacts from Minab and all were segregated in the Quarantine Station. The town was not infected. Total cases 19. Total deaths 15. Quarantine was removed on 28th Novem ber 1927. Lingah:— C &amp; sqs reported from a number of small coastal villages between Lingah and Bandar Abbas on 18th September 1927. Precautions taken. Land Quarantine established. First suspicious case at Lingah was on 12-13th October. Confirmed on 14th and quarantine imposed against the port of Lingah on the 15th October 1927. Cholera assumed grave proportions on the 15-16th October Great difficulty was experienced by the Quarantine Medical Officer with regard to notification of cases and deaths, segregation of contacts and anti-cholera inoculation. No exact figures available. Anti-cholera vaccine was promised by General Health Department Tehran, on 23rd July 1927, but arrived on the 23rd August 1927. A quantitv was also purchased from India to deal with the epidemic, pending the arrival of the above vaccine.8 Adequate funds were allotted by General Health Department, Tehran, to Mohammerah and the Chief Quarantine Meaical Officer for other ports to pay for all incidental expenses in connection with the epidemic. Accounts were rendered to His Excellency the Governor and the Malieh. Bushire and Remained free. Rumours of epidemics around JBushire were current. One such at Bulkhair, a port in Tangistan, was inves tigated. It proved false. III. Buildings.—Bushire. —Houses for 1st and 2nd class passengers require thorough repairs. A building for 3rd class passengers with arrange ments for segregation of batches and a place for women and children is urgently needed. At present they are being accommodated in matting huts. Attention was drawn to this by Major Nicholson in his No. 144 of August 1925 and again by Major MacGregor in his No. 266 of 6th July 1927. This station was inspected by Hakim A'azam from General Health Department, Tehran, in November 1927. He saw the urgent necessity for improvement. Lingah. —The Quarantine Station is a complete ruin. Krans 15,000 are required for renewal. During the last epidemic huts were used to accom modate sick and contacts. Other Ports. —Same as in 1926. Everything hinges on the question of adequate funds. There being no special allotment for ' Maintenance and Repairs of Buildings ' in the Quarantine Budget of 1302. IV. Transport. —The same unsatisfactory state of affairs as detailed in Major Nicholson's Note No. 144 of August 1925 is still in existence. No attempt has been made to remedy this. The question of a motor launch for Bushire was put up in Major MacGregor's Note No. 266 of 6th July 1927. V. Disinfectors. —At Bushire the Bowman Disinfector was thoroughly overhauled by the P. W. D. and is in working order. It was used during the epidemics. Disinfectors at Bandar Abbas, Lingah and Jask are not working. They are old and should be changed for a more suitable type. At Muhammerah the disinfector is working but has been condemned by the local A. P. 0. C. Ersgineers and should be changed. The case was put up fully by Major Nicholson in his No. 137, dated 3rd August 1926. VI. Code of Procedure. —Same as in 1926. Personnel, —Major Nicholson, LM.S., departed on leave on 1st May ' 1927 on termination of his tour. His place was taken by Major MacGregor, I.M.S. Major MacGregor, JJVLS,, was transferred to Gilgit on 2nd September 1927 and was relieved by me and I was in charge till the end of the year. Mr. E. T. Garthwaite, I.M.D,, departed on leave on termination of his tour on 1st April 1927. Mr. C. E. Hynes, I.M.D., reported on 16th April 1927 on termination of a course of study at the School of Tropical Medicine, Calcutta. VII. Notification of Disease, —The Health Section of the League of Nations Epidemiological Bureau at Singapore are now broadcasting a weekly bulletin of diseases. Through the courtesy of the Director, I. E. T, D., Persian Gulf Section, this bulletin is relayed from Bahrain when atmosphere conditions permit of its reception and transmission. A weekly report of health is received from Bombay and Karachi. How-! ever it is now arranged that the Port Health Officers send a telegraphic report when the number of cases of plague or cholera assume grave proportions at their ports. This obviates the delay which would otherwise occur if we only relied on the weekly reports. O^her reports as in 1926,.1 11 CHAPTER II. Note on events in the Bikarz Area during the year 1927. General.— military detachment has been satisfactory during the vear tinder Naib Azizullah Khan who is resident in Mishun. Following the demise of Gada Khan on the 5th June 1927 after holiding the appointment for 3J years, his brother Agha Khan was made head of the Kashkuli guards. As heretofore, the guarding arrangements at Ganawah under Haidar Khan, C.I.E., have been excellent. conse( l lience ^he holding up of Europeans at Gach Qaraguli on the ^l)th February 1927 by Qayid Givi raiders, it was deemed prudent to increase the guards at that centre to permit* of the establishing of two posts on the heights commanding the road from the Zuhrah River to the site of operations. Apart from this incident our operations have continued unhampered through out the area. . &amp; E. the Minister of War, Mirza Mohammad Ali Khan al Firughi' visited Ganawah in March. Political. —The long-standing friction between Asadullah Khan of Basht and his nephew, Ahmad Khan, continued until October when the latter was imprisoned m Behbehan where he still remains. Asadullah Khan remains completely under the control of the O. C. Behbehan. While friendly relations with him have been maintained we have, nevertheless, avoided unnecessarv correspondence. Sultan Abbas Khan Nik Bakht took over the Governorship of the Qash- qais during the summer. His mercenary nature has made him very unpopular and he has practically reduced the already impoverished Khans to penury. Of the Khans he favours Isfandiar, Ardeshir and Abul Fath, in consequence of which Hyas Khan was forced to share the benefits of the Kalantarship with Isfandiar. ^ The Kashkuli Khans have returned to the area for the winter and our relations with them are friendly and satisfactory. half-hearted measures against the Boir Ahmadis, in which the collec tion of fines and arrears of taxes seems to have been the sole aim of the autho rities, have been of little avail. A state of uncertainty exists in the Kuh-i-Gelu and Mir Ghulam and Lurasib continue to roam and pillage unchecked. Mishdn : (Sd). A. G. LAWSON. The 16th January 1928. CHAPTER III. ) , Administration Report for the Consular District of Bandar Abbas and Lingah for the year 1927. Personnel. Bandar Ahbas. -Mr. G- A. RICHABDEON, O.B.E., held the post of His Majesty s Vice-Consul with the personal rank of Consul throughout the year. Assistant Surgeon J. W. WOODS ELL, M.C., held charge of the duties of Consular Agent. 6 Foreign Representatives. Bandar Abbas —Nil. . Sahib HAJEE AHMED BIN YUSSUE KHAJA eonti- ''f i ;' aot as 4« e ' t for His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, although he has not been recognized as such by the local authorities.12 Local Government. Bandar Abhas, —Mirza ZAIN-UL-A'BIDIN KHAN EBRAT (MOTIMIN- UL-WAZAREH) who was relieved of his duties on the 4th August and recalled to Tehran owing to numerous complaints submitted by the local inhabitants to the Ministry of the Interior, justified his reputation during his tenure of office, as a weak and incapable official. He proved to be most . unreliable, extremely corrupt and indolent and passed his time chiefly under the influence of opium. He was succeeded on the 7th September by MIRZA ABBAS KULI KHAN ERAM (IQBAL-UL-MULK) who arrived from Lingah where he had held the post of Deputy Governor since May. He appears to be an amiable and friendly official, but has had no previous administrative exper ence. He was, for ^ome years, the personal servant of Ahmed Mirza, the ea;-Shah of Persia. Minah .—Although Syed Abdul Hussain was nominally Deputy Gover nor, the conduct of affairs of that place was virtually in the hands of the Governor IBRAT who*styled himself officially as Governor of Bandar Abbas and Minab. In the middle of July, MIRZA NASRULLAH KHAN HIKMET (BAHA-UL-MULK) arrived from TEHRAN and assumed charge. Whilst apparently well-meaning, he was unable to do anything to remedy the unsatisfactory condit ons prevaiLng in the district. Karguzarate. Bandar Abbas. —AGHA SYED HUSSAIN (HISHAM-UL-WAZAREH) held charge of the duties of Foreign Office Agent from the 18th January till the 6th April, when he was transferred to Mohammerah. This official was formerly Karguzar at Lingah whence he was removed as the result of representations made by His Majesty's Legation to the Ministry of the Interior in regard to his obstructive attitude against British subjects arid British interests generally. However, during his short tenure here, he had completely changed that attitude, and was most helpful and prompt in the disposal of cases filed by British Indians. Monsieur MISRUP KHAN, the local Finance Agent, officiated tempora rily till the arrival from Tehran on the 6th May of the permanent incumbent. The latter held charge till the 8th July when the post of Karguzar was suppress* ed throughout Persia. Mirza AZIZULLAH KHAN was reputed to be Bolshevic in his tendencies and decidedly anti-British and moreover lazy and incompetent, and perhaps the worst type of Persian official that has been sent to Bandar Abbas during jbjie past decade. Lingah. —MIRZA AHMED KHAN (IKRAM-UL-MULK) continued in office till the abolition of the post in July. He was an amiable old gentleman and very friendly although somewhat slow to act in official matters, and unfortuna tely addicted to opium. Finance Department. Bandar Abbas. —Monsieur MISRUP KHAN continued to holfl office throughout the year. His relations with H. M.'s Consulate have been consistently correct and friendly. Minab. —AGHA MAHOMED HASAj^ KHAN MUSTOUFI arrived on the 20th April from Lingah where he had occupied a similar post for over four years and whsre, incidentally, he had enriched himself, principally by trading in opium. It having been proved after departmentaLinvestigation that he had leased certain Government lands to MIR BARK AT KHAN for a bribe of 4,000 Krans, he was suspended and recalled on the 6th August. MIRZA MAHOMED KHAN, the Accountant of the Revenue Office at Bandar Abbas, replaced him temporarily.13 Posts and Telegraphs, Bandar-Ahhas. The local Postal Administration which promised well after the suppression of British Post Offices in the Persian Gnlf has during the pastye^r declined m efficiency, and its officials are considered to be unrelfable and untrustworthy as far as money transactions are concerned. One instance was recorded during the year in which two registered packets containing currency notes valued at Rs. 3,950 despatched by a British Indian bag re'ceivedft KarS ^ ' mi8Sing fr0m tlle re g istered KHAN be g u?a e tS rfosTof Th i e ti yea 0 r rdered ' investi g ation but Proceedings had not Lingah.-mmZA ALT AKBAR who has been in charge of the Post Office since April 1926, continued in office throughout the year His adminic tration has proved efficient and satisfactory. t * admims- Municipality.

Lingah, —There are no troops stationed here, Condition of the Country, Bandar .46to.—Thefts in the town continue, but there were no cases recorded in which the Police have recovered even part of property stolen. An important theft occurred in September when gold ornaments and cas belonging to a British Indian subject and valued at Krans 12,000 were off The Police have not succeeded in tracing the culprits or restoring P ^Minab. —Thefts in the village increased .during the year under review, but chiefly affected the property of Persian subjects. One murder was reported, the motive being apparently robbery. Except for some isolated instances of excesses committed by the followers of MIR BARAKAT KHAN, there were no cases of serious lawlessness 04 revolt by the tribesmen.15 Condition of the Roads, The steady improvement observed during the past two or three years in the maintenance by the Amnieh Department of law and order on the caravan routes leading from Bandar Abbas to Kerman received a great setback, owing to the inadequacy of the strength of the various posts. It was necessary to apply to the military for assistance and fourteen regulars under an officer have been stationed at SHAMIL since June for the protection of the road. Five robberies were reported on the TANG-I -ZANDAN route to KERMAN, and two attacks on caravans using the more frequented iA NOVERGOON route, where there are no Amnieh guards. Bandar Abbas-Minab Route.—Owing to disturbances, caravan traffic was practically suspended during April and again for some time during A ^Tn snite of repeated representations made on the subject by His Majesty's Consulate to the local Governor, no steps where taken m the matter and the situation was allowed to right itself eventually. ^ Road Construction. —The work of repairing the existing road in the vici- nitv of SIR JAN was in progress and the route leading to Bandar Abbas via the Rang-i-Zagh was being surveyed by a Persian and a Jugo-Slav Engineer. Lingah .—The route leading to Lar was safe throughout, and the caravan traffic fairly brisk. Slave Traffic. Three slaves from Persian Baluchistan sought asylum in this Consulate and were sent to the Karguzar who issued manumission papers directly to the concerned. * Linqah. —18 slaves including 8 males, 6 females and 4 children applied at the Consular Agency for their freedom. Fourteen obtained Certmcates ot Manumission and one was awaiting his papers at the end of the year. Two cases were reported in which young Indian boys were enticed away from their homes by the nakhudas of Persian buggalows and brought to the Persian Gulf where they were made to work as slaves. Both the lads managed to escape from their masters and seek protection at the Agency. Aviation. Since 1923, Bandar Abbas has risen into prominence as a halting station for aeroplanes using the Persian Gulf route from Europe to East and vice versa. It has a very good aerodrome which has been constructed at not a little expense by His Majesty's Air Ministry and has been available for the past eight or nine years for the use of all machines, British and foreign alike, Cairo-Karachi Air Mail and Passengers service. This was inaugurated early in January by His Majesty's Minister for Air in his flieht from England to India accompanied by Lady Hoare and a distin guished party in the air liner ' City of Delhi' of the Imperial Airways, Limited. Movements of Aircraft. 14 machines of all types, comprising 7 British, 2 French, 2 Dutch, 1 American and 1 German called at Bandar Abbas on either their eastern or homeward flights or both. Amongst the above were two Victoria Troop Carriers of the Royal Air Force that escorted the Air Minister from Baghdad to Indi^ and back. Four Royal Air Force Super Marine Flying Boats on their eastern cruise alighted at Henjam on the 14th November and left for Charbar on the 16%,% .16 Lingah. —The Air Liner ' City of Delhi' with the Right Hon'ble Sir Samuel Hoare, etc. landed for a few hours on the 4th January. The other aircraft that landed on the aerodrome were the ill-fated machine piloted by Flying Officers Cocks and Rowson in May and the ' Moth ' used by Mr. Dennis Rooke in his attempted flight from London to Australia. Visits of His Majesty's Ships. His Majesty's ship ' Triad ' with Captain R. Parry, D.S.O., R.N Senior Naval Officei?, Persian Gulf on board paid three visits during the year' and H. M. S. ' Enterprise ' visited between the 3rd and 5th December. H. M. S. ' Crocus ' anchored off the roadstead for a few hours on two occasions. Visits of His Majesty's Representatives. The Hon'ble Lieut.-Colonel L. B. Haworth, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf accompanied by Lieut.-Colonel A. N. Dickson, M.C., Residency •Surgeon and Chief Quarantine Medical Officer, Persian Gulf Ports, Captain R. L. Bazalgette, Under Secretary and Mr. C. H. A. Bagshaw, Personal Assist ant arrived on the 26th November in the S.S. ' Chakdara ' on his annual tour of inspection of the Persian Gulf and left the following morning for Heniam and Basidu. ' J Mr. G. A. Richardson, O.B.E., His Majesty's Consul and Assistant to the Resident inspected the Consular Agency at Lingah from the 18th March to the 25th March. He also paid three visits to Henjam during the year. British Interests. Indo-European Telegraph Department. The Office at Bandar Abbas worked satisfactorily. t . Mr V E - E - Gu,lter - O.B.E., Director of the Persian Gulf Section arrived in Indian Government Telegraph Ship ' Patrick Stewart ' on the 12th March on his annual tour. p, ^ I1 -N 0 v e m'ber, the Director of Customs at Lingah notified the Clerk-in- Cnarge 01 the Radio Office there that in accordance with instructions received rom iehran, the import of wireless stores intended for the station was pro- • niDited, except with the express sanction of the Persian Government. No similar restriction is being applied in regard to wireless stores destined for the Kadio fetation on Henjam Island. Imperial Bank of Persia. ' Wfw r ' M lftr ' d ™ in g over charge of this Branch of the Bank on the 20th June 1927 from Mr. A. V. Puzzey who was transferred to Ispahan. The Bank has continued to assist the Persian Government to improve its cmreney in this district by the removal from circulation of defective coins, of which a total of Krans 420,000 has been collected at Bandar Abbas during the year under review. &amp; C|uotatioi!S of the Bank for exchange on London and Bombav during 1927 were as follows :— London— Krans Highest . • . . Lowest . P er£ - Average . . ' • 47 - 75 P erf - Bcmbay- 50 - 37 Highest . . . . Lowest . t '-' r113 l00 - Average P er R*. 100. • SVS GS per Rs.lOO.17 Red oxide of iron. Hormuz Island. —There was a marked improvement in the output of the mines as compared with 1926. 6,535 tons of ore were shipped of which 2,100 tons were consigned to the United Kingdom (Liverpool), 2,100 tons to Germany (Hamburg), 2,000 tons to the United States of America (Philadelphia) and 335 tons to India (Calcutta). The bulk of the product, about 4,200 tons was transported by a German steamer. Trade and Commerce. Bandar Abhas. —The trade of this district which has been declining during the past few years continued on its downward course during the year. The total volume of trade for 1926-27 (Persian year 1305) the latest year for which statistics are available, amounted to £1,439,070, being less than that for the preceding year by £253,450 roundly. There was a decrease in both imports and exports, the former totalling £1,038,320 and the latter £400,750. The imports from India totalled £588,879 and consisted chiefly of cotton piecegoods, cotton yarns and cereals. The exports to that country amounted to £220,137 the principal articles comprising almonds, pistachio nuts, dried fruits, dates and raw cotton. Lingah. —The decline in trade is more marked in this district, the high Customs tariff and heavy taxes having driven trade to Dubai and Bahrein on the opposite Coast. The imports for 1926-1927 are shown as £140,885 and the exports as £66,370, totalling £207,255 as against £308,100 for 1925-1926, representing a decrease of 32 * 7 per cent. The bulk of the imports came from India which is also the biggest buyer of the Persian produce in the market. • Shipping and Navigation. Bandar Abbas. —143 steam ships aggregating 344,927 tons entered and cleared the port, of which 137 were British and 6 German. 29 vessels brought merchandise from the United Kingdom. Of these 10 belonged to the Ellerman and Bucknall Steamship Company and 19 to Messrs Frank C. Strick and Company, Limited. The six German steamers were of Hansa Line of Bremen and embarked their cargoes chiefly at Hamburg or Antwerp. Lingah.—S2 ships (77 British and 5 German) with a total of 183,118 tons entered and cleared with cargo. One shipping casuality was reported at the Consular Agency at Lingah in which a buggalow called ' PIR MAD AD ' under the British flag and owned by a Hindu merchant of Ramnagar, whilst bound from Mohammerah for Kutch Mandvi with a cargo of dates grounded near FARUR Island. Quarantine and Medical. (Personnel.) Bandar Abbas.—Lieut. D. L. Mackay, I.M.D. continued to hold the post of Quarantine Medical Officer of the port and remained in charge of the Consul- late Dispensary for the seventh year in succession. • A severe epidemic of cholera, probably imported from the Basrah area, occurred in August at Minab which was crowded with people from the oxr ■? lying districts and Islands, for the date harvest. A panic ensued and the terror stricken inhabitants scattered in all directions, carrving the disease with them. Unfortunately it was the hottest time of the year, and owing to a plentiful supply of water, the epidemic spread rapidly to the surrounding villt ges till it reached the suburbs of Bandar Abbas. M410(c) f&amp;pd18 The Persian Government immediately adopted preventive measures. Three doctors were despatched from Tehran via Bushire by air with a plentiful supply of anti-cholera vaccine. Over 10,000 persons availed themselves of inoculation in the Charitable Dispensary and Quarantine Camp and nume rous others in the adjacent villages and Islands. An observation camp was established at a distance of five miles from Bandar Abbas to prevent communi cation with the infected area. Thanks to the energetic steps taken by the Quarantine Medical Officer and Persian doctors of the Sanitary Department assisted by the Police and Military, cholera was warded off successfully from entering this town, only four cases of the disease being discovered amongst persons who had evaded inspection. It is estimated that the mortality at Minab and the outlying districts was between 4,000 and 5,000. Town Charitable Dispensary. —This continued to function satisfactorily and the gratuituous treatment afforded to the poor and the half-starved population of this town was gratefully appreciated. Attendance. —The total number of out-patients who availed themselves of this institution was 6,568 against 7,450 in 1926, the decrease being due to the land quarantine imposed during the cholera epidemic. Lingah. —Assistant Surgeon J. W. Woodsell, M.C., continued to be Quarantine Medical Officer and in charge of the charitable dispensary. Quarantine and Epidemics. —Lingah was also visited early in October by cholera in an epidemic form. 171 cases and 213 deaths were reported to the Quarantine Medical Cfficer by the local authorities, but no reliance may be placed on these figures. Twenty persons amongst those attacked by the malady and medically treated by the former, recovered. At first, there was strong resentment on the part of the Mujtabids to the anti-cholera measures put into force, but when the epidemic promised to run a severe course, this opposition disappeared and hundreds of the inhabitants flocked to get themselves inoculated. Weather. Bandar Ahhas. —Rainfall was below the average and the summer was comparatively mild. Bandar Abbas was subjected to frequent earth tremors, as many as 5 having been recorded between March and September. Lingah.— T \\ q weather was trying during the months of July and August. A meteorological observatory was erected during the year by the Indian Meteorological Department. The Observatory was placed in charge of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. Economic conditions. Bandar Ahhas: —Owing to the ravages of locusts and scanty rains, the harvest was not a prosperous one, and foodstuffs were comparatively dear. The situation was further aggravated by the date harvest season synchroni sing with the outbreak of cholera in the middle of summer. CHAPTER IV. Administration Report for Kerman, for the year 1927. 1. H. B. M.'s Consulate.—Personnel. —Mr. H. D. G. Law, C.I.E., I.C.S., handed over charge of His Majesty's Consulate at Duzdap on the 26th March 1927 to Mr. J. H. Davies, C.B.E., I.C.S., who arrived Kerman on the 30th March. Khan Bahadur 'Abdul 'Alim, L.K., held the post of Indian Attache till June 29th when he was transferred to Bushire. His relief Khan Bahadur Syed Allah Banda, M.B.E., assumed charge on the 4th July 1927.19 2. Consulate work.—The total number of cases settled by the Kargnzari and lyalati in conjunction with the Consulate in which the interests of Foreign subjects under the Consulate protection were concerned was 43 and the com pensation recovered amounted to Krans 37,575. 28 cases were pending in the lyalati at the end of the year. 69 British subjects were registered during the year, 3. Indo-European Telegraph Departments— A. L. Roberton, Assistant Superintendent Class VI went on leave on November 4th, handing over charge of the Kerman office to Mr. P. E. Dormer. Till the end of March there were two sub-divisions with headquarters at Kerman, viz., the Southern sub-division, [Kerman to Bandar Abbas with extension from Baft to Saidabad (Sirjan)] in charge of Mr. P. E. Dormer, and the Kerman division, (Anar to Bam) under Mr. C. E. Treadwell. On the 1st April as a tentative measure these two sub-divisions were amalgamated under the name of the Kerman sub-division and placed under the charge of Mr. C. E. Treadwell. The Dehaneh Baghi sub-division remained in charge'of Mr. May. There were six interruptions of a total duration of 36 hours in this section, and 11 interruptions of a total duration of 150 hours on the Bandar Abbas line. No new offices were opened. 4. Imperial Bank of Persia, Kerman. —In April Mr. S. Lee relieved Mr. F. G. T. Nelson who proceeded on leave. Mr. Lee went on leave on 21st December and was succeeded by Mr. C. A. Gardner. Mr. P. L. Rhodes took over charge from Mr. P. W. Douglas as Bank Accountant in the middle of May. The question of defective coin, which appears to be more troublesome here than in other provinces, created some difficulty in the bazaars. The Bank twice, in April and in November, announced that they would no longer accept defective coin even with a 10 per cent, deduction. On each occasion, however, protests from merchants induced them to. revert to the old practice after two or three days, and, at the close of the year, defective coin was still being accepted at the usual discount. 5. Church Missionary Society and its work.—(a) Education. —The Reverend A. G. Ozanne remained in charge of the boys' school, and Miss E. Macdonogh of the girls' school, throughout the year. Miss Gerrard joined the Girls school in January. The boys' school cannot unfortunately be considered a great success. Numbers continued to decline, though towards the end of the year they improved a little and the number of boys on the roll at the end of the year was 40. The girls' school on the other hand continues to expand and to do excel lent work. There are now 145 girls on the roll. Progress has been made with dress making, house keeping and cooking, and a company of Girl Guides has been started. (6) Medical. —Doctor Dodson and Doctor Mary Price were in charge of the medical work of the Mission throughout the year and continued to do excellent work. 6. British and British protected firms.—(a) Carpet trade. —The follow ing are the British and British protected firms trading in carpets in Kerman :— The Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, Ltd., Kerman^ The Standard Carpet Company, Ltd., Kerman, Messrs. Bardwil Brothers, Messrs. B. Kazanjian &amp; Co., Messrs. Costykian &amp; Co., Messrs. A. and M. Karagheusian &amp; Co.. The Wetli Company, Ltd., Messrs. H, S. Tavshanjian &amp; Co., Messrs. Atiyeh Brothers.■BnHnH 20 The total value of carpets and rugs exported during the years 1926 and 1927 was as follows (approximately) :— i 1 ^: I Kerman Carpets and rugs Tribal rugs Krs. 1926. 8,948,000 385,000 Krs. 1927. 9,000,000 1,500,000 The carpet industry this year has had no political difficulties to contend with but trade is poor. (6) General trade. —A branch of Messrs. S. Dorabjee and Co. (a British Indian firm) and six Shikarpuri Hindu firms traded in general merchandise, the most important articles being sugar and piece-goods. Business was dull. 7. Political Interests of the Consulate.- —The chief event of the year was the denunciation by the Persian Government on May 10th of the treaties on which the Capitulatory rights of Foreign Governments are based. This was followed by the sudden and rather premature abolition of the office of Karguzar on July 7th. The British policy of non-interference in Persia's domestic affairs con tinues to prove satisfactory to our position and prestige. Even educated Persians of good social position however still believe that the British Legation uses its influence to secure the advancement of those who are friendly to British Consulates. 8. Communications and Security—Jn the first quarter of the year there were sixteen robberies on the Kerman-Duzdap road and in Narmashir district A body of 140 Infantry and 70 Cavalry with some machine guns was sent to Bam, and from there detachments were sent to Narmashir, Rudbar and Jiruft. This has had an excellent effect. Several robbers have been caught and hanged and security has been re-established. Smce July there have been 6 robberies on the Kerman-Bandar Abbas road, two of them on a large scale. In one case a small militarv detachment was sent to assist the Amnieh but for the rest they have been left to their own resources which are inadequate. A certain amount of work, in the nature of repair rather than construc tion, has been done on the Kerman-Isfahan road during the vear. None of the 14 miles of new road constructed near Kerman will be fit for traffic until they are heavily metalled. Work on the long promised Bandar Abbas road was aetually begun in Nov ember, but it was discontinued after a few weeks as the money was wanted to complete the Burujird road. The trade of Kerman is starving for lack of this road which is a vital necessity to the Province. Posts —The Duzdap postal arrangements continue to be excellent maik arrmng regularly on the 5th day. In July a bi-weekly motor mail se™ ice was started between Isfahan and Kerman. It has functioned satisfoctorUv and mails are now received from Teheran in about seven days. t:lslactorll &gt; B-—Local Government and Politics. ' i.-i, 9 : Lo ^ al (?oTOmoj--Ge»em?.—His Excellency Mirza Taoi Kh a n Khajooi was relieved at the end of March by His Excellency Mirza Sulaiman Zlr to the t v S il graph after four da y s th e latter handed Khan 'Jam ' airived nn k 'Lv 16 ^' ^ OYemor 'G'eneral Mirza Mahmud erf the yea?. September 6th and remained in charge till the close the ^mtoiltoatton ^Th^jt 0 ' ' ^ Sulaiman Khan left no mark on tne administration, ihe latter was reported to have Socialistic svmmthies for bribery. 6 ^ partleular evidence of ^ here. He had a bad deputation His Excellency Mirza Mahmud Khan ' Jam ' is in an entirpW class to any Governor-General this Province has had for many yearsf Honest,21 hardworking, in a plodding rather than a brilliant way, and keen on effecting improvements, he has had a noticeable effect upon the spirit of all the leading men and officials in the Town, who now share some of his enthusiasm and hopefulness. His attitude towards this Consulate has been most friendly and helpful. Finance Department, —Mr. P. J. Fitzsimmons remained in charge of the Finance Department during the year. His assistant, Mirza Humayun Khan ' Sayyah ', on whom he was absolutely dependant, was transferred in August and this, together with the manner of Dr. Millspaugh's departure, destroyed most of Mr. Fitzsimmons' interest in his work. The new Assistant Mirza Hasan Khan 4 Nasir ' arrived in October. He appears to be honest and able. By his accessibility Mr. Fitzsimmons has reduced the corruption which was formerly so notorious in this department, to a fraction of what it was. The fact, however, that he has not learnt a word of Persian or moved a yard out of Kerman Town (except for one visit in his own interests to Teheran) during the 2J years he has been here cannot but have hampered his efforts to make the department really efficient. Opium.— M y , Fitzsimmons has given up hope of achieving any appreciable reduction in smuggling which continues on the scale mentioned in last year's report. Government loses some 4,000,000 Krans revenue per annum, a sum equivalent to about the third of the opium revenue for the whole of Persia. Survey, —The revenue survey of the Province was stopped in March after only two districts had been completed. The new assessment has been brought into force only where it is higher than the old assessment. Karguzari. —Mirza Asadullah Khan ' Daoodi' was Karguzar from the beginning of the year till he handed over to the Governor-General in August on the abolition of his office. His attitude towards the Consulate was helpful, and he handled the cases with reasonable despatch. He was not free from the taint of unobtrusive bribery. Police, —Naib Sarhang Ibrahim Khan ' Sheriff ' came to Kerman as Rais-i-Nazmieh in March. He has spent a considerable portion of the rest of the year in Tehran trying to secure his transfer from Kerman to Shir a z or Tehran. He affects European society and is more interested in that and in trade (motor cars. Cameras, wireless, etc.) than in his profession. Naib Asadullah Khan of the ' Nawabi' family of Shiraz, who was sent here in August, has been acting for him satisfactorily during his absence. The Police appear to be incompetent at detecting crime no doubt because it pays them to be so. Justice. —Having determined to attempt some reform in the Courts of Justice the Persian Government, in its usual Gilbertian manner, closed the 4 Adlieh' courts in March beforejthey had made any alternative arrangements for the administration of justice. Apart from certain comparatively unimportant changes in the number of ' A'za ' attached to the Istinaff and Bedayat courts and some speeding up in procedure it is understood that the new judicial administration will differ little from the old. The improvement in the pay of the judges is hardly sufficient to remove the temptation to bribery which has been the curse of this department, and many of the new men appointed are without judicial experience or are even, in some cases, of questionable integrity. Education. —Sayyid Tajuddin Khan ' Nahi' remained in charge of this department till September. His successor Mirza Hasan Khan ' Jowdat' from Teheran arrived on December 4th. Sayyid Tajuddin Khan's attempt to cleanse the Augean stables of the Auqaf department brought him up against powerful vested interests which secured his transfer. The attempt to introduce education into Persian Baluchistan, mentioned in last year's report, has for the moment failed. After some months trial Dost Muhammad Khan on various pretexts declined to allow the school masters sent by the Rais-i-Muarif to continue their work and demanded other individuals more to his liking. M410(o) F&amp;PD22 During the few weeks he was in charge before the close of the year Mirza Hasan Khan opened 14 primary schools in the villages and a girls' school in Kerman Town. Amnieh. —Sarhang Kaiwan Mirza remained in charge till September when he was relieved by Naib Sarhang Malikzada. Both these officers have done their best to cope with the robberies, details of which have been given above in paragraph 8. The strength of the Amnieh force is, however, quite inadequate for the defence of the Duzdap and Bandar Abbas roads in view of the fact that the Bahichis and the Bashakirdis have never been disarmed. The Baluch robber menace has been effectively held in check by the despatch of a small military force to Bam and Narmashir (from May till the end of the year), but the Bashakirdis have not yet been tackled. On the whole the force has been paid fairly regularly. Telegraphs. —Mirza Hadi Khan ' Daryush ' has remained in charge throughout the year. He is a pleasant man and friendly to this Consulate. At the end of the year four Persians arrived to take over the wireless installation from the Russian who had been in charge. The installation is now complete and will probably be brought into use very shortly. At the close of the year a telephone service was opened between Kerman and Yezd (218 miles). 10. Local Politics. —There is little of interest to record. The people of this Province seem resigned to the view that Kerman is a back-water which cannot hope to receive any consideration from the Central Government' and remain plunged in apathy as regards the future both for themselves and their country. They blame the Mejliss rather than the Shah for their neglect but they appear to have no great enthusiasm for the latter, though the rumour in the autumn that the Shah would shortly visit this Province roused some interest. In June a Bahai shopkeeper was murdered by two well-known Muhani-« madan bad-characters. The Mullahs did their best to excite religious svm' pathy for the murderers and nearly succeeded in causing riots. The militarv assisted the police, however, and order was maintained. ' 1 he only local paper published with any pretence of regularitv is the Istiqamat . Its Editor has in the past been on good terms with the so-called democrat party which is friendly towards this Consulate For some reason he quarrelled with the democrats in the summer and began to liirt with the Socialist party and the Soviet Consul. Of the other papers which appear at the most irregular intervals two, the ^ Aaeenah-i-Junoob and the Zikr-i-Haqayiq ' (a recent publication) are simply used as a means of blackmail; the other paper ''Sadaa-ve-Kerman' is an organ of the moderate political party. ecu 11 ' H , ealth and Gene J al Welfare.—In March Dr. Sayyid Ja'afer Khan Shamsa was appointed Rais-i-Sahiyyeh. He was relieved by Dr. Hasan ivnan Zamam early in December.

Vcrchakm was regarded as a quieter and mof P4 23 harmless individual. He went on furlough in November leaving the ^Russian Consulate in charge of an Armenian Vice-Consul who, with a Russian Doctor and his wife (who was also a doctor), joined the staff in October. Apart from the spreading of a few anti-British rumours, and an attempt to secure some influence in the so-called Socialist party which has met with doubtful success, there has been nothing noteworthy in the political activities of the Soviet Consul. The signature of the Russo-Persian commercial treaty brought the Soviet Consul a certain amount of popularity. The commercial activities of the Soviet Consul, which shewed a marked increase at the end of the year, have been dealt' with in a separate report. 13. Military Affairs. —The strength of the military forces in Kerman Province at the end of the year was 32 officers and 803 men. In consequence of the investigations begun at the end of 1926, Naib Sarhang Muhammad Khan was transferred in April 1927. There was of course no definite finding on the various charges of embezzlement and oppres sion made against him and he was shortly afterwards given the Sistan Com mand. His successor, Sarhang Ali Shah Khan who remained in charge till the end of the year is an officer of the best type of the old school. A strict dis ciplinarian, who strongly represses corruption, he has devoted himself ex clusively to his charge and has refused to meddle in politics or intrigues. He pays the troops himself and inspects their food daily. The detachment sent to Bam and Juruft paragraph 8 Communica tions above) has done very good work. 14. Persian Baluchistan, Jiruft and Rudhar. —Dost Muhammad remained quiet during the year and the Persian Government left him undisturbed. In August the Officer Commanding Troops Kerman sent a special messenger to Dost Muhammad to sound him. The messenger brought back certain pro posals from Dost Muhammad which were forwarded to Teheran. They prac tically amounted to a recognistion of his independence and no answer has been sent. Apart from the robberies mentioned in paragraph 8 above Jiruft and Rudbar have remained undisturbed during the year. Zargham-us-Saltana exercises a semi-independent rule in Rudbar and only pays a fraction of his revenue dues. CHAPTER V. Administration report of the Mekran Coast for the year 1927. Personal. —Mr. E. E. Gunter, O.B.E., was in Political Charge of the Mekran Coast throughout the year. Gun-running. —68 Magazine rifles and 12,800 rounds of ammunition were reported landed on the coast of the Persian Baluchistan during the year. Persian Baluchistan. —The country has been quiet on the whole. The chief events of the year were as follows — In January an American said to be touring in the interests of the Persian Customs accompanied by three Afghans, visited Bashakard, Gabreg and Bint and after making enquiries for Mir Dost Mohamed Khan of Bampur at the last place, was reported to have gone on to meet him. Mir Din Mohamed, Mir Dilawar Khan brother of Mir Durra Khan joint chief of Dashtyari, Mir Jalal Khan ex-chief of Gwetter and many others left for Sirbaz towards the m ddle of June to meet Mir Dost Mohamed Khan of Bampur. The results of the meeting are not definitely known. Claims. —None of the old claims brought by the British Indian merchants against the chiefs and people of the Persian Baluchistan in and after the Charbar meeting of 1906 were settled during the year. These claims have24 been brought to the notice of the Persian Government by the Political Resi- dent in the Persian Gulf from time to time. Foreign Subjects,— subject of a foreign European power resided at any port on the Mekran Coast during the year. Telegraph lines. —The telegraph lines between Jask and Charbar were interrupted during the year by wilful damage as follows . Hours. January February March April . May .

Fourteen slaves sought refuge in the office of the British Agent, Gwadur, thirteen of them stayed there and one was sent down to Karachi as a special case at Government expense. Several of the thirteen came to Karachi as soon as they earned sufficient money to pay for their passage.

Persian Garrison. —In the beginning of the year the strength of the Persian garrison under the command of Naib Amanullah Khan was 150 in-r fantry, two officers, one field gun and one machine gun. At the end of January 100 Baluchis recruited by the Persians at Charbar were ordered to proceed Bunder Abbas by overland route but they refused to leave on the grounds that they were enlisted for the protection of Charbar only. Some desertions also took place and the Officer Commanding stopped the rations and disbanded the Baluchis. Naib Amanullah Khan was relieved by Naib Mirza Ali Khan on 20th March. Major Aghay Yawar Husain All, Officer Commanding Troops of the Gulf ports arrived from Bunder Abbas on inspection duty on 2nd April and left on 12th.

His duties were performed by one Seyed Ahmed Effendi from Muscat. A law was promulgated by the State under which all merchants stocking liquors at Gwadur must take out licenses for which Rs. 50 per mensem are charged.

Thomson's report No. 52, dated 1st January 1928 on the condi tion of the country between Biyaban and Gwadur.27 Biyaban District. This district is still under Mir Barkat who is very friendly towards us and also on good terms with the Persian Government. I am informed that when Nawab of Kharan visited Sirdar Dost Mohamed Khan of Bampur about two or three months back, he, (Nawab) sent a messen ger to Mir Barkat and that on the return of the messenger to Bampur he took back several rifles and ammunition. There was also a gift of rifles and am munition from Sirdar Dost Mohamed Khan to the Nawab. Jask District. Mir Mustafa Khan continues to control this district assisted by his son Mir Murad Khan. No incidents of importance occurred in this district Jask to Maliki Chiddak which is administered satisfactorily. The tribesmen are friendly. A detachment of 60 riflemen of the Persian Army with one machine gun and six horses arrived from Kerman on the 11th November to escort the Line party of the Assistant Superintendent in charge of the Jask Telegraph Sub- Division from Jask to Charbar. The Officer in charge of this detachment is Lieutenant Mirza Ali Khan Sarbaz who travelled with the party by steamer from Bunder Abbas. Four animals came overland. Breakage of insulators and thefts of stalks still continue in the district . The Dasht of the Bint District. This district from Maliki Chiddak to Kund is under Mir Nagdi Khan w ho is assisted by the sons of Islam Khan, Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan. The subsidies for the protection of the lines are drawn by Nagdi Khan and Ayub Khan. The Karwan tribes pay no taxes but have agreed to assist Nagdi Khan or Ayub Khan in the event of either being attacked by any other chief. Taxes collected by either of the above-named chiefs are sent to Bam pur. There were 7 interruptions at and near Sadaich during the period January to May and the total duration was 484 hours. In May 1927 Khalifah Khair Mohamed cut the lines but all the other interruptions were caused by one Jan Mohamed and his brothers, but, since Jan Mohamed is in receipt of Rs. 25 per mensem (the cost being debited to contingencies m the line estimate) no further trouble has been caused by him. The Sirdars were warned that their subsidies would cease if better control was not maintained. Breakage of insulators and thefts of stalks still continue in the district. The Dasht of the Gaih District. This district from Balbund to the Tez Hills is administered by Sirdar Husain Khan who appears to be managing affairs satisfactorily. No complaints of misbehaviour have been received against the headmen of Bandini, Bir, Sirgan and Parag. The lines are not tampered with in this district. Gaih Pistrict. This district is controlled by Sirdar Husain Khan who it is reported went to visit Sirdar Mirza Khan at Rudbar recently. Dashtyari District. Sirdars Din Mohamed and Durra Khan are the chiefs of this district. Their relations with each other are quite friendly now. The former is thea» 28 \ most powerful chief in the district. The lines are not interfered with and both chiefs are friendly towards us. Durra Khan collects taxes in his own section of the district and makes it over to Din Mohamed who forwards same with collection from his section to Bampur. Bahu District. This district is under Mir Subhan and Mir Ahmed. It is rumoured that all taxes in this district will be made over to Din Mohamed for transmission to Bampur. Subsidies are paid to Mirs Subhan and Ahmed. General. Good rain has fallen in Biyaban during December and all fields have been ploughed and seeds sown. If the rain does not fail for the remainder of the rainy season, good crops are expected. The condition of the people, flocks, etc., is still very poor.

It is hoped that the State will make full use of her as a petrol ship for closer Custom's supervision. Mr. Iskandar has continued to hold the post of Director General of Cus toms throughout the year. Tribes of the Sultaucits Sut. —Said bin Saleh bin Ali, a Sheikh of the Arama section of the Janabah of Sur, was murdered in the street atSuron the 4th March. The murderer was not known but was suspected of belonging to the Mukhanna, one of the four sections of Janabah. The town stood to arms for some time but the trouble was inter-tribal and not ttTiii-Government. On 19th August Mr. Thomas proceeded to Sur, conferred with Sheikh Mohomed bin Nasir A1 Hamudah of the Bani Bu Ali, and discussed with the four sections of the Janabah the questions of paying their debts to Khan Bahadur Nasib and Ali Moosa Khan which amount to Rs. 3,00,000 and of pulling down forts which they had recently erected. Being dissatisfied with the attitude of the Arama section, Mr. Thomas, on departure in the ' A1 Saeed , seized one of their dhows, whereupon the tribesmen on the shore ed at the ' A1 Saeed The funnel and one boat were struck but no damage was done.

In December Sulaiman bin Sannan turned out Saif bin Amer and his son under threat of murder. Yunqul and its surroundings have thereby fallen under the influence of the Imam and Sheikh Isa bin Salih. Affairs in Oman. The relations between the Muscat Government and the Imam continued to be friendly. The Imam has formed a council in Nezwa consisting of-— * (1) Sulaiman Baruni. :(2) Saeed bin Nasir al Kindi.

This has been .carried out successfully, though resented by the inhabitants of Bestaq, JNezwa and Semail, particularly by the Bani Ruwaiha. msskmry enterprise-'The Rev. G. D. Van Peursem with his family, Dr. (Miss) Hosmon and Miss Lutton were in Muscat during the year leaving as usual for summer recess. In December Dr. Harrison of the same mission arrived at Muttra with his family and started medical work there. Foreign interests -On the 17th February, F. R. ' Diana ' arrived from the Gulf and left the same day, F. R. Sloop Antares ' arrived on the 27th November and left for Aden the same evening. Arms traffic. Iffo arms were imported during the year under report except tor the personal use of His Highness and his Ministers. M410(c) F &amp;PDSlave trade. —Fourten slaves took refuge at the Agency during the year of whom 10 were manumitted, after investigation of their cases. our cases are pending and are under reference to the Hon ble the Political Resident or the Local Government. Registration of British subjects. —One hundred ninety seven British subjects and 277 British protected persons were legistered during the year. Trade. —The wet date crop was greater in quantity and better in quality than the previous year. The dry date crop, though greater in quantity, was slightly inferior in quality to that of the previous year owing to rain and the absence of hot winds. The prices per Bahar—200 maunds or 1,800 pounds, of dry and wet dates were as follows :— Oman dry dates from Rs. 125 to Rs. 300. Batineh „ ,, „ „ 125 „ 180. „ wet „ „ „ 35 „ 70, Fard „ „ „ » 80 „ 180. There was no demand for dry dates in India during December and prices fell. Large stocks are held up in Muscat. The rate of dollars varied during the year from Rs. 126-12-0 to Rs. 133 per dollars 100. Muscat infantry, —Captain R. W. G. Stephens was in command of the Corps from 1st January to 12th May when he proceeded on leave to India. He returned on the 23rd of August and continued to be in command till the end of the year. The Muscat Infantry furnished the Agency Guard. The Corps has been employed constructing roads between Muscat and Muttra, and from Muttra towards the Batineh Coast. The Corps is well disciplined and has worked well. Visits of officials. —The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel L. B. H. Haworth, I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, visited Muscat in H. M. S. ' Triad ' r in March accompanied by Major C. C. J. Barrett, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain ; Captain C. G. Prior, Under-Secretary ; Squadron Leader C. H. Keith, R. A. F., Pilot Officer C. W. Switzer, R. A. F. Also in the S. S. ' Chakdara ' in December accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel A. N. Dickson, I.M.S., Residency Surgeon ; Captain R. L. Bazalgette, Under-Sec retary ; Squadron Leader C. H. Keith, R. A. F. Captain E. J. Headlam, C.S.I., C.M.G., D.S.O., R.I.M., Director, Royal Indian Marine, Bombay, visited Muscat in December. Mr. E. E. Gunter, O.B.E., Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, visited v Muscat on I. G. T. S. ' Patrick Stewart ' in March, accompanied by Mr. G. Burlingham, Postmaster-General, Sind and Baluchistan. Travel in Oman. —In May, a party of the Royal Air Force consisting of Squadron Leader C. H. Keith, R. A. F., Flight Lieutenant T. V. O'Brein, R. A. F. M. S. and Pilot Officer C. W. Switzer, R. A. F., accompanied by Mr. Thomas, Finance Minister, undertook a reconnaissance of the terrain bet ween Sohar and the Trucial Coast. The party left Sohar on the 12th May, accompanied by an escort of the Bani Kaab and Bani Umr. The A1 Naeem of Baraimi failed to send in an escort as requested, and would not allow the party to pass through their territory. The party passed through Mahadhah to Shargah instead of through Baraimi to Abu Dhabi as originally intended. Mr. Dowson of Messrs. Hill Brothers of Basrah arrived at Muscat on the 3rd June and proceeded to Semail on the 5th June, returning to Muscat on the 14th. A1 Baruni had granted permission to Mr. Dowson to visit Semail, taking him to be an American. On learning he was an Englishman, he was asked to leave immediately by the same route by which he had come. Climate. —The total rainfall for the year amounted to 2*92 inches as against 2 * 86 inches last year.31 CHAPTER VII. Administration Report of the Trucial Coast of Oman for the year 1927. General. —The Honourable the Political Resident visited the Trucial Coast ports in March and in December. Personnel: —Khan Bahadur Isa bin Abdul Latif continued as Residency Agent. Slavery. —Two enslaved Hindu boys were recovered from Abu Dhabi and two from Dibai and repatriated. Two Baluch divers were recovered from the interior of Ras al Khaimah, a Baluch woman and her son from Dibai and two Baluchis from a village between Hemriyah and Umm al Qaiwain. Enquiry shows that the traffic in slaves is almost wholly conducted from Persian Baluchistan where the authority of the Central Government is negli gible. Pearling. —The Arab merchants of the Trucial Coast found themselves in difficulties this year for lack of capital, which they were forced to borrow at high interest from Indian or Awazi lenders. Though the European and local markets showed an improved tone the earning of divers from the Tru'cial Coast was small and the season as a whole disappointing. Relations with Nejd. —There have been no marked attempts on the part of Ibn Saud or his agents to extend his influence on the Trucial Coast, but there is little doubt that the chiefs are nervous of his power, keep in indirect touch with him and are reluctant to do anything likely to offend him. It is certain that Shaikhs Shakhbut and Hazza were encouraged bv Ibn Jaluwi, Ibn Saud's Amir in Hasa, to s ize Dalmah (see later under Abu Dhabi), Shargah. —Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar was still sore over the deportation of his father-in-law to Abu Dhabi in 1926. His brother unsuccessfully attempted to ambush the Residency Agent at al JarUf (opposite Ajman) and it would appear more than likely that the attempt was made with the connivance of the Shaikh. Hostilities took place in June between Shaikh Sultan and Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad, the ea;-Shaikh, caused by the confiscation by the former, in viola tion of a previous agreement, of the private property of the latter. They were not of a serious nature and did not involve a breach of the maritime truce. At the instance of the Honourable the Political Resident, the Senior Naval Officer proceeded to Shargah and with the assistance of the Shaikh of Dibai and the Residency Agent, Shargah, arranged a settlement between the parties The Senior Naval Officer took the opportunity of warning the Shaikh- and his brothers before the assembled notables of the principality that any harm to the Residency Agent would be visited by the severest consequences to themselves, and obtained from them an undertaking admitting their res ponsibility in this behalf. The hostilities of last year between Fujairah and Kalba were renewed in the autumn of 1927. A request of the Shaikh of Shargah for permission to despatch assistance by sea to the headman of Kalba was refused as it would have involved a breach of the maritime truce Desultory fighting continued till November when, at the instance of the Honourable the Political Resident, the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, proceeded to Kalba and negotiated an agreement between the conflicting parties. Dibai. —This principality has remained undisturbed throughout the year. Shaikh Said bin Maktum has been most helpful in the interests of peace on the Trucial Coast and is now undoubtedly the leading chief on the coast. Abu Dhabi. —Shaikh Saqar bin Zaid, who had murdered his brother. Sultan bin Zaid, and assumed the chiefship in August 1926, managed to main tain his precarious position during 1927. In March Shaikhs Shakhbut and Hazza, sons of the late Shaikh, seized the island of Dalmah, belonging to Abu Dhabi, with the intention of making it their headquarters to raise a force to oust their uncle. They gave out that their action had the approval of Ibn Jaluwi, Ibn Saud's Amir in Hasa. On the despatch of a force by Shaikh Saqar they withdrew without any resistance32 first to Hasa and thence to Baraimito await a more favourable opportunity. As both the seizure of the island and the ejection of the intruders were breaches of the maritime truce the Honourable the Political Resident warned the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi as well as the other chiefs of the Trucial Coast that such conduct would not be tolerated no matter what the provocation. Apnan.— 1 Umm Al Qaiwain. — &gt;• Nothing ro report. Ecls Al Khaimah.— ) CHAPTER VIII. Administration Report of the Political Agency, Bahrein, for the year 1927. Preso nnel: —C harge of the Political Agency was held from January 1st to April 24th by Major C. C. J. Barrett, C.S.I., C.I.E., from 25th April to 2nd November by Captain R. G. E. W. Alban and from 3rd November to the end of the year by Major C. C. J. Barrett on return from Kuwait. The Ruler of Bahrein and Al Khalifa family .—The attitude of Sheikh Sir Isa bin Ali is correct. The usual calls between the ruler and the Britisht representative were paid and returned at the New Year, at the Id and on the King's birthday. Sheikh Isa also called on the Honourable the Political Resi dent on 26th February and 4th November and his call was returned. He called on Sir Denys de S. Bray, Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, who visited the island in November and Sir Denys returned his call. His Excellency Sheikh Hamad's relations with his father have continued to improve throughout the year. He relies more and more on the advice of his brother Sheikh Abdullah and settles no major problem without consulting him. Sheikh Salman, the eldest son of the Deputy Ruler, has worked through out the year as a member of the Bahrein Civil and Criminal Court. Sheikh Rashid bin Mohamed, the Deputy Ruler's nephew, was appointed President of the Salifat-ul-Ghaus (the Diving Court) but he was not a success in this position. Other cadets of the Al Khalifa family have been employed in minor capacities. The relations of the Deputy Ruler with the Political Agent have continued to be extremely cordial. He is relying far more on his own judgment assisted by the advice of Shaikh Abdullah and Mr. Belgrave and his appeals to the Agency have been much less frequent. It is our policy for the Agency to efface itself, as far as possible, and except for giving a lead in matters appertaining to Education and the Municipalities on one or two occasions during the summer this policy has been consistently followed. In this the Agency follows the policy detailed to it by the Honourable the Political Resident. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad visited Shaikh Abdullah bin Jassin at, Dohah during the summer and various minor Shaikhs and Bedouins visited Bahrein during the year to partake of Shaikh Hamad's hospitality. Bahrein State, —Mr. C. Dalrymple Belgrave continued to hold the post of adviser to the Bahrein Government throughout the year and his exertions have resulted in a notable improvement in the whole tone of the adminis tration. Relations between the Sunni and Shiah inhabitants have been good throughout the year. After a gross case of maladministration of property had come to light a department for the proper control and registration of Waqf property was instituted during the year. The department is under the management of the three Sunni Qadhis supervised and assisted by a Council of Shiah and Sunni notables, under the presidentship of Sheikh Abdulla. The Qadhis are not yet reconciled to the supervision and assistance of the Council. ' ' ^ -33 Tne Land Registration Department has done excellent work throughout the year and the opposition to it has now disappeared and its benefits are appreciated. 369 transfers of property were registered as against 200 in 1926. A large number of plans and reports regarding houses, gardens, etc., under litigation has been supplied both to the Agency Court and the Bahrein Court. Fifteen villages were surveyed during the year and Records of Rights and index maps prepared for 5 villages. The Department deputed one surveyor to Khasab for 3 months at the request of the Honourble the Political Resident. The year was an average one in the Pearling Industry the catch being about 20 per cent, better than last year. As a result the diving community had more money to spend and there was an increase in the import of piece- goods and miscellaneous articles. The Shalifah (Diving) Court functioned during the hot weather, but it does not appear to have been a great success. At present its duties have been merged in those of the Majlis al Urfi (Court for considering claims based on mercantile usage) and a new Court called the Majlis al Tajara (Trade Council) has been established. The Eastern and General Syndicate bored a few more water wells and then transferred their activities to Kuwait until December, when they re turned to bore a few more wells for the American Mission and a merchant named Ali Yateem. Khalil Kanoo a local merchant has imported a boring plant and bored a few wells at a very much less cost. The ' Marina ' has now been completed and was formally opened by His Excellency Sheikh Hamad on 27th September. It extends from al Nairn to the Government offices a distance of 1,500 yards. It is 30 feet wide and bordered on the outer edge by a stone wall and parapet. It is much appreciated both for its practical use and as a promenade after the close of work during the hot weather. The sea space between the ' Marina ' and the land is being reclaimed by private enterprise. The Ruling Sheikh's official residence was also completed during the year. It is the first building of cut stone to be erected in Manama. A considerable amount of work has been done on the upkeep of roads, especially between Manama and Sakhir, the Sheikh's favourite residence. An oil store has been built by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on the shore about half a mile west of the town and another store is in the course of erection by the Standard Oil Company. In many quarters stone and mud buildings are replacing mat huts. The Manama Municipality has done a remarkable amount of work- Several streets in the middle of the town have been widened and many houses and shops have been partly demolished and rebuilt in order to improve the streets. So far from decreasing the value of the buildings affected, their letting value has increased considerably owing to the increased trade brought by the improvement to the road. The Bazaar is much cleaner and less congested than at the close of last year. It has been decided to remove the fruit and fish market from the inside to a site on the edge of the town. A new meat market of cement and corrugated iron is being built to replace the present insanitary section of date palms. Trees have been planted along the main roads and the Municipal garden is receiving attention. Local rules have been made regulating the number of passengers travel ling in boats, registration of coolies, extermination of dogs, free vaccination, protection of food from flies, extermination of rats and other measures to improve general health and general cleanliness. In fact the Manama Municipality has proved itself to b a thoroughly progressive body. A Municipality under the presidency of Sheikh Abdulla was established in Muharraq during the year. It is subsidised by the Bahrein Government and collects revenue from a house tax assessed at a much lower scale than that M410(c) F&amp;PD34 of Manama. Since its inauguration there has been a considerable improve^ ment in the condition of the town. A small slaughter house has been built. There has been no outward opposition to the Muharraq Municipality but as it is a new institution the ultra conservative section naturally frown on it. The Persian school is well attended but it is not patronised by Baharaneh or local Arabs who look upon it as a purely Persian institution, an attitude of mind which is encouraged by the parading of Persian flags and the singing of Persian patriotic songs on every opportunity. The Arab schools have now adopted the practice of parading the red Arab flag. Arab education has received considerable attention especially from Sheikh Abdulla. The staff of the Khalifa schools, of which there are two, one in Muharraq the other in Manama has been augmented by several teachers from Syria. There is considerable feeling against the importing of foreigners, but there was no remedy as local teachers do not exist. A branch of the Khalifa schools has been opened at Rufaa and it is proposed to open another at Hidd. The wife of one of the new teachers has opened a class for girls in Muharraq, which is attended by a few daughters of the Ruling Family and children of well-to-do merchants. Meetings have been held to decide the question of opening a Shiah Arab school. All the leading Shiahs attended. It has been decided to build a Shiah school close to the ruined Shiah mosque at Suq-ul-Khamis, as being central for several Shiah villages. A public subscription list was opened and Sheikh Hamad informed the community that he would double the amount subscribed by them. So far Rs. 5,000 have been promised. One of the sons of Sheikh Ibrahim bin Mohamed al Khalifa has been sent to Beyrout University. His fees are being paid by the State. This event is of importance as showing a desire on the part of the Ruling Family to benefit by education. The girls' schools maintained by the American Mission reports its highest enrolment at any one time to be 60, with an average daily attendance of 25. The subjects taught were Reading, Writing, Arithematic, Geography, Sewing, Knitting, Calisthenics, Singing and Hygiene, English is taught as a language, but Arabic is the language used in all classes. The Mission Boys' school continued under the supervision of Mr. Hakken. The maximum enrolment was 54 and the average attendance 28. The older boys formed a Club furnishing a .room as a meeting place. The club has a literary programme every Friday afternoon and has Arabs, Baharaneh, Persians and Jews as members, Bahrein State Po^ce.—Captain L. S. Parke continued to be Commandant throughout the year. The strength of the Armed Police is 114 of whom 106 are P'unjabi Musalmans. The local Police consisting of Arabs, Baharaneh and Persians number 24. The detachment of the 3/16 Punjab Regiment remained in Bahrein till Sth February 1927 when it returned to India. No crime of a serious nature has occurred during the year. The popular tion have remained quiet and appear to respect and have confidence in the Police Force. The Commandant speaks very highly of the general behaviour of all ranks and the fact that not a single complaint has been made against any member of it reflects the greatest credit not only on the Police Force itself but also on Captain Parke's handling of it. One hundred and eighty criminals were admitted into the State Jail during the year and there were also 29 civil prisoners. Trade. —The pearl season was better than the previous year and conse quently an improvement appears in the Customs returns.35 The total imports were valued at Rs. 1,90,63,505 as against Rs. 1,86,04,280 last year an improvement of over 4^ lakhs in value and consider ably more in quantity owing to the drop in the, price of sugar and coffee. Exports show a decline which points to a greater consumption on the islands. There was a remarkable increase in the import of sugar and coffee. Owing to business competition between beet sugar and Java sugar the price decreased 20 per cent, while there was a drop of 30 per cent, in the price oi coffee owing to an exceptionally good coffee crop. The fall in price induced Bahrein merchants to buy. The import of Anglo-Persian oil Company's oil increased by 50 per cent, owing to the Company's Agents giving credit to purchasers. Owing to reduction in freight timber, coir and tamarind from Malabar is being imported by steamer instead of by native craft. The number of motor jolly boats has doubled since last year. The demand for locally built jolly boats has been better than last year. Sail cloth, grass mats and pottery are manufactured locally chiefly by Baharaneh but there is no export of these articles. Trade is generally good and the bazaars show a larger variety of goods than in previous years. Shipping. —The number of visits paid by ships to the port of Manama during the year was as follows :— , British 91 German ....•••• His Majesty's ships visite d t he port on six occasions. The French Government yacht ' Diana ' visited Bahrein on the 8th February 1927 and her Commander exchanged visits with His Ji.xceilency Shaikh Hamad. The Indian Government Telegraph Ship ' Patrick Stewart' ran aground on the Fash-i-Dabal when bringing the Director, Persian Gulf Section, Indo- European Telegraph Department, to Bahrein on his annual visi . Postal.—A branch of the Indian Post Office is established in the Agency at Manama, but it has not yet undertaken the duty of delivermg letters at addressees' residences. There is no record of the number of letters posted but the receipts from the sale of stamps were Rs. 11,700. The number of ordi nary letters'received for delivery was roughly 1,28,424 and ot registered , letters 3,894. The number of registered letters posted m Bahrein was 3,5b8. Parcels of all kinds received were 7,430 while 270 were posted. Cash Certi ficates purchased were of Rs. 10,555-8-0 in value. Rupees 23,183-4-0 were deposited in the Savings Bank and Rs. 11 ,400 were withdrawn British Postal Orders to the value of Rs. 611-12-6 were sold while orders to the value of Rs. 178-8-3 were paid. 4,317 money orders of the value of Rs. 2,13,724-11-0 were issued, the commission on which amounted to Rs. 3,380-4-0 win money orders to the value of Rs. 1,980-14-3 were paid. Judicial. —The number of Civil Suits filed in the Court of the Political Agent during the year was 1,557. Three hundred and thirteen Criminal Cases were decided. In addition to this 69 miscellaneous petitions were dealt with. The total number ot petitions received during the year was 1,939. Criminal cases were generally of assault and theft. There were no deportations under the provisions ot the Bahrein Order in Council. Khan Sahib Mirza Ali who was appointed Indian Assistant to the Political Agent took over his duties in the earlier part of the year. He took over a considerable portion of the judicial work. He has performed his duties in a very satisfactory manner and has enabled the Political Agent to have more time to attend to the other auties of his post. Medical. —Assistant Surgeon R. Holmes has been m charge tlw Victoria Memorial Hospital throughout the year. He is also Medical Officer to the Sheikh of Bahrein and is in medical charge of the Police _borce. Two hundred and two Indoor patients and 6,522 Outdoor patients were treated at the Victoria Memorial Hospital as compared with 165 and 4,971 during the previous year.36 Nine hundred and thirty-eight surgical operations were performed as compared with 559 during the previous year. The prevailing diseases have been Malaria 1,997 cases, Kespiratory Diseases 525 and Diseases of the Eye 691. The causes of the prevalence of Malaria are {a) Climate, (6) Numerous breeding grounds, (c) Absence of anti-malarial and prophylactic measures {d) Hundreds of fresh cases imported from the Persian coast yearly. The Municipality is attempting to cope with (6) by filling with street refuse the depressions in which rain water collects. Small-pox appeared during the last quarter of the year, and continued to claim a large number of victims until the close of the year. Bahrein was free from plague throxighout the year. Dr. Harrison was in charge of the American Mission Hospital for the greater part of the year. He was relieved by Dr. L. P. Dame in November. The hospital had 7,264 patients and performed 269 major and 274 minor operations. There were 35 obstetrical cases taken care of by the doctors or nurses and 515 calls were made to patients' houses. During the winter Qatif was visited and in the summer a visit was paid to Muttra. Visits of Government Officials. —The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel L. B, H. Haworth accompanied by Captain C. G. Prior paid a short visit to Bahrein on 29th January 1927, and again on 24th February 1927. On the latter occasion he stayed for 9 days. The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel L. B. H. Haworth and Sir Denys de S. Bray, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., C.B.E., accompanied by Captain R. L. Bazal gette visited Bahrein on 3rd November and left on 5th November. The Political Resident accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel A. N. Dickson M.C., Chief Quarantine Medical Officer, Captain R. L. Bazalgette and Mr. C. A. Bagshaw, Personal Assistant, visited Bahrein on 18th November and left on 19th November. Squadron Leader Keith and Flying Officer Swizer returned with Ma jor Barrett from his trip to Muscat and the Trucial Coast on 14th April. They left for Bushire and Baghdad on 17th April. &gt; Squadron Leader Keith again visited Bahrein in October and November. Major Barrett left Bahrein on 17th March and accompanied the Hon ourable the Political Resident on a trip to Muscat and the Trucial Coast. He returned on 14th April. He again accompanied the Political Resident on a trip to the Trucial Coast on 19th November and returned on 28th November. British Interests. —The Agency Guard supplied by the 3/16 Punjab Regi ment left Bahrein on 8th February on which date the Bahrein State Police took over their duties. German Interests. —Three Germans wished to disembark at Bahrein ex S.S. Bandra on the 18th June but the master of the vessel was informed that no Germans are allowed to land at this port. Again another German named Karl Lindner wished to land in Bahrein in connection with pearl shell business but he was not allowed to do so. Nejd. His Majesty Abdul Aziz bin Saud proclaimed himself king of the Hejaz and Nejd during the. year. On 5th November a party of Nejdis under Faisal bin Dawish attacked and destroyed an Iraq post at Busayah. Since that date the movements of Faisal have been the main preoccupation of Nejd. His Majesty the King detailed a force under Fahad bin Abdulla bin Jilawi, to deal with possible trouble in the Ajman territory and Fahad appears to have performed his task satisfactorily. Akhwan bigatory gave the Shiah inhabitants of Qatif cause for complaint during the middle of the year, but wiser councils have prevailed and the situa tion has been eased .very considerably.37 Qatar.—Hhe Honourable the Political Resident accompanied by the Poli tical Agent visited Dohah on 13th April and discussed the proposed visit of aeroplanes to Qatar with Sheikh Abdulla bin Jassim Ath Thani. The Sheikh was not disposed to welcome an air route through his territory, and professed his inability to resist the Wahabis, whose hostility he said would be inflamed against the aeroplanes. The Customs receipts of Dohah are only about one lakh of rupees yearly and the greater part of this is paid as a tribute to Bin Saud for protection. Sheikh Abdulla bin Jassim spends the greater part of the year hunting and leaves the administration of Dohah to a Negro Governor. Climate. —The hot weather was an average one. In November two Upper Air Observers of the Meteorological Department arrived in Bahrein to make observations for the London-Karachi Aviation Service. The records which they have kept from 3rd November show that the maximum temperature from that date to the end of the year was 94 * 7 while the minimum was 54*2. CHAPTER IX.

Malwade, I.M.D:, performed the duties of Quarantine Medical Officer and Medical Officer in charge of the Charitable Dispensary from the beginning of the year until the 23rd January, when Dr. C. S. G. Mylrea, O.B.E., took over these duties in addition to those of Medical Officer in charge of the Political Agency, which he had already been perform ing. On 3rd March Assistant Surgeon A. L. Greenway, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., I.M.D., took over all medical duties, and continued to perform them until the close of the year. Condition of the Country. Ibn Saud continued to enforce his prohibition against his subjects trading with Kuwait throughout the year. On the 11th January a Nejd caravan of nineteen men and thirty-five camel loads of merchandise, said to be worth Rs. 60,000 and to include fifteen thousand Maria Theresa dollars in silver, on its way from Kuwait to Qasim, was intercepted before it was clear of Kuwait territory by a detachment of forty-five men sent by Abdullah bin Jiluwi, the Governor of Hasa. The detachment confiscated everything, and took the men in chains to Hasa. On three or four other occasions detachments visited the frontier and the southern portion of Kuwait territory to enforce the prohi bition. When the leaders of the Ikhwan began to return to Nejd after the fall of Jeddah, it soon became evident that some of them were bitterly disappointed that the Hejaz campaign had not offered better facilities for amassing plunder. An increasing feeling of discontent against Ibn Sa ud himself began to manifest itself. They were much dissatisfied with his idea of organizing a civilized government in the Hejaz, and his prohibiting them from raiding across the frontier. Notable amongst these malcontents was Faisal ad-Dawish, the paramount Shaikh of the powerful Mutair tribe and a veritable firebrand of the Ikhwan movement, who in 1926 induced Sultan bin Humaid, paramount Shaikh of the Utaibah tribe, and Dhaidan al-Hithlain, paramount Shaikh of the Ajamn, to take an oath binding themselves together for mutual support in the event of Ibn Saud wishing to take punitive action against any of them. m410 (c) f&amp;pd38 Such was the state of affairs when, on the Persian Government refusing permission for the Imperial Airways to establish a service to India along the south coast of Persia, the suggestion was made that the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf might be followed instead, and Ibn Saud was approached in the early part of the year under review, with a view to obtaining his permission for the route over his territory to be used. As was to be expected, the very idea of such a thing was anathema to the Ikhwan, and Ibn Saud, acting on the very strong advice of Ibn Jiluwi, said that he could not agree. Next came the building of a Police Post at Baswah, or Busaihah as we usually call it, in the Iraq desert. The Ikhwan apparently connect it in their minds with the Air Route scheme, and think that it is destined to become a huge petrol dump, and a base for the Europeanization of their country— hence their aversion to it. So strong was this aversion that Ibn Saud was induced to lodge a protest against the establishment of the Post, on the grounds that it was an infringement of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol, an argument which a man of his acumen can hardly have believed in his own mind. Notwithstanding his taking this action, the existence of the Police Post certainly helped to widen the breach between Ibn Saud and his Ikhwan leaders, as Faisal ad-Dawish, who had now embarked on a regular campaign of propaganda against him, pointed to it as a proof of his contention that Ibn Saud had sold his country's rights to the British. The feeling against Ibn Saud was not confined to the Ikhwan tribes, however, as some members of the Saud Family even were against him—not to mention the Hejaz, where he has always been hated as a foreign conqueror of an alien faith. In the summer of 1927 a plot to murder his son, Saud, in Riyadh, and his cousin, Abdullah bin Jiluwi, in Hasa, was discovered and . frustrated only just in time. And there is little doubt that his own brother, Muhammad, and the latter's son, Khalid, were the instigators. An attack on the Police Post at Busaiyah was made at about 11 p.m . on the 5th November by a party of some forty Mutair, who took the garrison by surprise under cover of the darkness. One policeman alone made good his escape from an outpost, and gave the alarm at Abu Ghar. With the excep tion of one policeman who was found wounded, they put to death all the inhabitants of the Post, consisting of six police, one civilian official, twelve workmen and one woman. Air reconnaissance carried out over Busaiyah and southwards to the Neutral Zone between Iraq and Nejd on the morning of the 6th November failed to locate the raiders, who succeeded in making good their escape over the Nejd frontier. One result of this unprovoked attack was the indefinite postponement of a Conference which was to have met in Kuwait on the 20th November, between delegates of Iraq and Nejd under the presidency of the Political Agent, to draw up an agreement for the mutual renunciation of all outstanding claims by the tribes of each Government against the tribes of the other, and to discuss the procedure to be followed in dealing with future claims of this nature. This Conference was to have taken the place of the Special Tribunal provided for by the Bahra Agreement of 1st November 1925, which was found to be imprac ticable owing to the number of claims but forward, and both Governments had agreed in advance to renounce all claims. Shaikh Hafidh Wahbah, an Egypt ian in Ibn Sauds employ, actually arrived in Kuwait on the 18th November to represent Nejd at the Conference, but in the meantime the attack on Busai yah Police Post had taken place as stated above, and Ibn Saud had been informed that the Conference must be postponed until those responsible had been punished, full compensation had been given for the killed and wounded, and assurances given that adequate measures had been taken to prevent fur ther raids into Iraq territory. On the 26th November a report reached Kuwait that a small camp of ' Awazim near the southern boundary of Kuwait territory had been warned to move further to the south out of the way, as the Ikhwan were going to raid into Kuwait territory. All local Bedouin were promptly warned, and motor car patrols kept a sharp look out. Notwithstanding all precautions, however^ a party of four hundred Ikhwan under Turahib bin Shuqair and a son of Saihudbin Lami succeeded in raiding the Kuwait Uraibdar at Umni \Urmum, near Zaqlah, some seven miles north of Jahrat, on the morning of 4t&amp; December. As soon as news of the raid reached Kuwait which was not until the afternoon, a force of over a hundred men was collected and rushed out in cars, but arrived too late to intercept the raiders, who got away with a consi derable number of camels. The unsettled state of affairs in the desert, and the alarmist rumours which were current, caused much anxiety in Kuwait. The town wall was restored where necessary, and was manned nightly until the close of the year. Mercenaries were also enlisted to supplement the garrison of Jahrah, which was brought up to a strength of over three hundred men, not counting the Bedouin camped in the vicinity. On the morning of the 8th December Shaikh Hafidh Wahbah called on the Political Agent, and informed him that he had received a message from Ibn Saud, telegraphed from Bahrein, instructing him to tell him, for the inform ation of His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq, that very serious trouble had broken out in Nejd, and that he had heard to his regret that a force of Ikhwan was marching north contrary to his orders. He conveyed a similar warning to the Shaikh of Kuwait. On the morning of the 9th December three aeroplanes patrolling over the Neutral Zone between Iraq and Nejd were subjected to heavy rifle by a party of camel riders, 300 strong, in the vicinity of Umm-al-Abid, one Wireless Operator being wounded. The remaining machines of the formation imme diately attacked the hostile force with machine gun fire. Machines sent from Busaiyah on the same day located a force of about 600 men and camels at Jadaidah, also near Rukhaimiyah, moving rapidly south, and attacked them with good effect. Some hours previously this party had raided encampments of the Ghalidh section of the Muntafik and the Dhafir to the north of the Sha'ib al-Ummah. The raiders in this, as in previous cases, were Mutair. On the 22nd December Faisal ad-Dawish crossed the Iraq frontier in some force and raided the Iraq shepherd tribe of Zaiyad and some Abdah Shammar at Jaukhah thirty-one miles from Bir Ansab, inflicting heavy slaughter, particularly on the Zaiyad, He then moved north-west to attack the Dahamishah, a sept of the Amarat section of the Anizah, who fled before him and escaped. After this Dawish apparently moved south again, and his subsequent movements until the close of the year were shrouded in mystery. The fact that Faisal ad-Dawish and his Mutair have been raiding on such a wholesale scale not only without Ibn Saud's permission, but in defiance of his orders, has naturally given rise to the most exaggerated rumours as to what the real state of affairs in Nejd is, and some would appear to think thatother tribes as well, particularly the Utaibah, are defying his authority. According to the most reliable information available at the close of the year, however, it is only the Mutair who are actually out of control, and other tribes are quiet; and the general opinion amongst Arabs best able to judge is that Ibn Saud will soon re-establish his authority in the desert, but that he will do so by peaceful means, and would be unwise to attempt to punish the Mutair. Meanwhile, a force sent by Ibn Sa'uds orders from Hasa to keep the tribes in order was known to have reached Maraghah, 165 miles south of Kuwait, where the main body of the Awazim were, and another column was said to have been sent from Hail. Nejd subjects in Kuwait, On the 20th October Abdullah bin Hamad an-Nafisi, Ibn Saud's agent in Kuwait called on the Political Agent, and told him that Ibn Saud had sent him a supply of Nationality Certificates, forms of Application for Passports, and Passports, and instructed him to issue them to Nejd subjects if the Political Agent would agree to countersign and visa them. The Political Agent replied that he could not agree to do this without orders from Govern ment, as the late Shaikh Mubarak by an agreement with His Majesty's Govern ment had bound himself, his heirs and successors, not to receive the agent or representative of any Power or Government at Kuwait, without the previous40 sanction of His Majesty's Government, and the signing o passports by him would constitute him an official agent. Abdullah an-Nafisi said that Shaikh Ahmad had explained the situation to him, and agreed not to issue any passports or nationality certificates until Government sanction were obtained, but asked the Political Agent to refer the matter. Shaikh Hafidh Wahbah, who, as stated above, arrived in Kuwait on the 18th November to represent Nejd at the proposed Conference, brought the Political Agent a letter from Ibn Saud, empowering him to discuss the question of Nejd subjects in Kuwait with him. He said that if Ibn Saud were prevented by existing treaties from establishing a consul at Kuwait, he would like the Political Agent to look after the interests of his subjects there, and inquired whether this would be possible. The Political Agent replied that he thought His Majesty's Government would agree to his giving them his good offices, but that he would have to refer the matter before he could reply definitely. The question had not been decided before the end of the year. Peakl Fishery. The Kuwait Pearling Fleet, which was much smaller than usual, did not sail until the end of May. The season was considerably better than the two previous years. The number of oysters was small, but the yield was fairly rich. The pearl market had also improved. Artesian Wells. The Eastern and General Syndicate Limited having undertaken to sink artesian wells for the Shaikh of Kuwait, began drilling operations at the east ern end of the town in the beginning of May. For the first 140 feet nothing but sand was met with, and the work was then stopped by quicksand. A new bore was tried a few feet from the former one, but this also proved a failure. In August a bigger plant was brought and got into position on rocky ground near the sea, some 300 yards from the former bore. Work was started in the beginning c f September, but had to be stopped temporarily in December, pending the receipt of a further supply of piping from the United Kingdom. At the time of stopping work a depth of about 500 feet was said to have been reached. * Medical. The health of the town was satisfactory on the whole, as, with the excep tion of diseases of the eyes, ears and skin, there were no epidemics. The winter months, however, showed an increase in sickness, due principally to eye and skin diseases, which were very prevalent at the close of the year. Owing to epidemics of cholera in some of the Gulf ports and also in Iraq' quarantine restrictions were enforced from ti e end of July until the middle o* November. This was much more difficult to do than on the last occasion when it was necessary, owing to the motor traffic between Zubair and Kuwait which did not then exist. All cars, however, had to drive direct to the Qua rantine Station, and no one was allowed to enter the town until permitted to do so by the Quarantine Medical Officer. About 250 cholera inocula tions were done. Kuwait remained free from the disease. The work of the Charitable Dispensary consisted chiefly in the dispensing of medicines to out-patients, there being small scope for surgical work. 8,103 out-patients, including 1,932 women and 3,060 children, were treated during the year. At the American Mission Hospital 2,807 out-patients were treated in the men's side, and 5,626 in the women's side ; 480 surgical operations were per formed ; and 188 patients were received into the wards.41 Amebican Mission, Dr. C. S. G. Mylrea, O .B.E., and Mrs. Mylrea, Rev. G. and Mrs. De Jong, Miss Van Pelt and Miss De Young were in Kuwait throughout the year. Rev. E. E. and Dr. (Mrs.) Calverley, together with their three children and their governess, Miss Robertson, were also present throughout the year, except for a three months' visit, to India in the summer. Dr. and Mrs, Storm arrived from the United States in the end of October to take up work with the Mission. The American Mission held their Annual Meeting in Kuwait during the first fortnight in November, and, in addition to the above, nineteen member of the Mission from other stations in the Persian Gulf and Iraq attended it.

' Lawrence ' also came into the harbour for a few hours on the 26th November on her way from Basrah to Henjam. Aviation. The Imperial Airways' aeroplane 44 City of Delhi ' landed at Kuwait on the 18th November, having been chartered by Shaikh Hafidh Wahbah to bring him from Shuaibah Aerodrome on his arrival there from Cairo. It returned the same day. Ihe Air Officer Commanding in Iraq, accompanied by two aeroplanes of No. 84 (Bombing) Squadron, R. A. F., landed at Kuwait on the 1st December, and returned the same day.42 On the 7th December two aeroplanes of 84 (Bombing) Squadron, R.A. F.. visited Kuwait, and on the 29th December three aeroplanes, on each occa S1 on returning the same day. P ostal. There was a weekly service of mail steamers from India throughout the vear and a fortnightly service from Basrah. To supplement the latter, mans were sent from fifsrah to Fao on alternate weeks, and brought from there by water boat. E xchange. The rate of exchange of the Maria Theresa dollar varied from Us. 134-4-11 P er hundred dollars ^n February to Rs. 129-7-0 in November, the average being Rs. 130-13-6 British sovereigns and Turkish pounds a\eraged Rs. 13- &gt;-4 and Rs. il-5-8 respectively. , f „ Indian Currency notes were exchanged at par from t ,ie end of May to the beginning of October, and at a small premium during the rest o the year, 6 annas per Rs. 100 being the highest, which was the rate at the close of the year. C limate. The summer was an unpleasant one, as the or seasonal north-west 'wind which is supposed to blow for forty days from the 6th June, faded. The highest temperature was 118° on the 25th August Ihe autumn was mddei than usual, as too was the winter up to the close of the year Only 2 43 inches of rain fell during the year, of which 1 '61 inches fell in the latter part ot the year. This latter was well distributed, and, with the mild weather, there is every prospect of a good spring in 1928. gipd—m410 (c) f&amp;pd—16-8-28—38.Ot^y Ao. &amp; CONFIDENTIAL. /.Ac . 3^7 O- i- &lt;72-7 Feom the Hon'ble Sib F.

Norwegian Vice-Consulate.—The Political Eesiden't, the Hon'ble Lt.- Colonel Sir Lionel Haworth, K.B.E., till 1st November and the Hon'ble Sir Frederick William Johnston, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., I.C.S., from 2nd November acted as Norwegian Vice-Consuls.2 Russian Consulate-General.—Thz Consul-General paid a short visit to Bushire from. Shiraz in Jun© to attGnd th.G op6iiiiig ceremony of the Soviet firm named 'Xhe Russian Xraders for the East . Xhe Consulate remained closed for the remaining part of the year. 'The Russian Traders for the East,' Bushire, carried out the work of reporters to the Consul-General, Shiraz, and to Moscow. Dutch Consulate.—The French Consul remained in charge throughout the year. German Consulate. —The Consulate remained closed throughout the year. The ex -German Consul, Herr Wassmus, who is now conducting an agricultural farm at Chaghadak, about 12 miles outside Bushire town, is looking after the German interests efficiently though unofficially. Section 3. Local Government. 1. Governor of the Gulf Ports.—SAs Excellency Mirza Ghulam Ali Khan Fatuhi, Muin-ul-Mulk, C.V.O., held the appointment till 20th May, on which date he left suddenly for Tehran. The appointment of his succes sor was much delayed. Abdullah Khan, Munajjami, Provincial Director of Finances, was appointed to act as Governor in addition to his own duties from 26th May, and he carried on till 31st August, when His Excellency Sardar-i-Intisar Aqa Muzaffar Khan Aslam arrived from Tehran and relieved him as Gover nor. Sardar-i-Intisar is an ex-military offiicer of high rank and has seen much civil and military service in the North of Persia. He was a member of the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission of 1901. He is very fluent in French, German, Arabic and Turkish, and knows a little English and Russian also. His last appointment was at Kermanshah where he was Governor. As a man Sardar-i-Intisar is pleasant, easy to deal with, and is obliging so far as it does not clash with his ciffilcial duty. At the same time he appears to be a strong man. He takes interest in Municipal affairs and is pushing through the new reforms vigorously. He holds some influence at Tehran due to the fact that his brother Doctor Amir Khan Aslam is the Shah's physician. His relations with the Consulate General have so far been excellent. 2. Karguzar. —There was no Karguzar at Bushire during the year. Sadid-as-Saltaneh acted as Passport Officer till 10th May. Sadid-as-Saltaneh was appointed Assistant Governor of Gulf Ports from 23rd September. The old cases pending in Karguzari were referred to the Governor, but with scant satisfaction, as three Governors were appointed in quick succes sion during the year and none of them took much interest in judicial matters. 3. Officer Commanding. —Yaawar Amanullah Khan held the appoint ment till 19th August when he was relieved by Yawar Muhammad Taqi Khan Arab who served in the South Persia Rifles during the Great War, and knows a little English. He is well disposed towards the Consulate-General and prefers to be approached direct and not through the Governor. 4. Finance Department. —Abdullah Khan Munajjami arrived from Tehran and took over charge from Mirza Hasan Khan Farhad (Matin-us- Sultan) on the 18th March. His general attitude has been anti-British and at times he has gone out of his way to raise difficulties for the Residency. He is disliked by both Persian officials and non-officials on account of his boorishness, rough treatment, and the unnecessary hitches he raises in pay ing bills sanctioned by higher authorities. As long as Firuz Mirza is Fin ance Minister, Tehran, this protege of his is not likely to be removed from Bushir^,5. Police Department, —Yaawar Mustafa Khan Albruz, E/ais-i-Nazmieh, Bushire, was despatched to Ahwaz on the 6th April under arrest, to answer a charge of corruption. He returned on the 13th and left for Tehran on the 15th. Yawar Hasan Ali Khan Bayat arrived on the 15th April as Rais- i-Nazmieh and held the appointment till September, when he was recalled to Tehran. During his absence Ali Naqi Khan Sarim Nizam acted as Rais- i-Nazmieh. Yawar Hasan Ali Khan Sarim Mzam was, however, reposted to Bushire from the 25th November. His relations with the Consulate- General have been satisfactory. 6. President of the Courts. —Aqa Shaikh Muhammad Hadi Saduqi was appointed as Bais-i-Adliyeh, Bushire, in the beginning of January, but he did not arrive here till 13th February. He opened the Bifayeh Court (Court of the First Instance) with an official ceremony on the 18th. He held the post till the beginning of November when he was removed in consequence of cer tain complaints against him. During his sojourn at Bushire he acquired a sordid reputation generally as an opium eater and bribe taker. He stated to a friend on one occasion that the appointment cost him Tomans 900 in Tehran, and that it was necessary to make good his loss. His successor Mirza Nimatullah Khan Ashti, though a junior man in grade, is well spoken of. 7. Customs 'Department. —Monsieur Hunin, Inspector-General of Cus toms, relieved Mr. Stas as Provincial Director of Customs, Bushire, on the 4th May. The latter left for Enzali on the 9th May. Shahzadeh Wali Muhammad Mirza Nouban relieved Monsieur Hunin as Pro vincial Director of Customs on the 14th May. Monsieur Hunin has been friendly. The Shahzadeh has worked well and his relations with the Con sulate-General have been amicable. 8. Posts and Telegraphs. —Mirza Hussain Khan Shahruzi held the ap pointment of Provincial Director of Posts till October, when Posts and Tele graphs Department were amalgamated and he became the Director of Posts and Telegraphs. Mirza Sahatpur held charge of the Telegraph Department till the date of amalgamation, when he was posted as Deputy Director of Posts and Telegraphs. Mirza Husain Ali Khan Shahruzi made his annual lour of the Gulf Ports in May and June, and on return on 23rd June left for Tehran to make his report. He returned on the 9th September and resumed charge of his post. Mirza Shahruzi is a capable olffiicer and takes interest in his work, but his method of investigation in the Bandar Abbas case in which notes worth Rs. 3,450 were stolen from a letter despatched by a British subject was cer tainly open to criticism. 9. Health and Quarantine Department. —Dr. Abdullah Khan Moin tooK over from Lt.-Colonel A. N. Dickson, I.M.S., on the 4th August. Dr. Abul Qasim Bahrami relieved Dr. Abdullah Khan Moin in the end of October. Section 4. Military. Amir-i-Lashkar (General) Mahmud Agha Khan Airam, General Olffilcef Commanding in the South (Headquarters at Shiraz) arrived at Bushire on the 20th January and left for Mohammerah on the 23rd. He again visited Bushire on the 5th April and returned to Shiraz on the 10th. About 200 Infantry arrived from Shiraz and left for Mohammerah on the 4th January. Sartip (Brigadier General) Farajullah Khan, Military Governor-Gene ral of Khuzistan, arrived at Bushire en route to Ahwaz in the first week of February,\ 4 at the to Early in the year owing to the receipt of numerous reports that smug gling was on the increase the Olffiicer Commanding the Bushire Garrison ac companied by the Inspector General of Customs proceeded with 50 men m an armed dhow to Asaloo. Tangistanis fired on the party killing'the helms man. The dhow thereupon returned to Bushire. At a later date the Gene ral posted a few guards both at Dilwar and Asaloo. So far as is known the efforts of the local authorities to put a stop to smuggling have not been very fruitful. The Tangistanis still manage to smuggle sugar and tea m large quantities into the town of Bushire. Whenever the military or police have located and rounded up a party of Tangistani smugglers, the latter have generally escaped unharmed with their loads. Sarhang (Colonel) Husain Quli Khan, Hoshmand -i-Muzaffar Inspector General of Census, arrived at Bushire on the 13th August and left tor Mohammerah on 'the 17th. At the beginning of the year, the Officer Commanding the Troops Bushire received sanction to sell the present barracks, and to quarter troops outside 'the town at Bahmani village, but nothing could be done give effect to the sanction by the end of the year, as no good bids were onered for the present barracks neither were funds available with which to build new barracks. The present barracks are filthy and very unhealthy. In August the Army Headquarters for the South at Sbiraz were abolish ed, and three Brigade Headquarters were created instead, at Shiraz, Ahwaz and Kerman. According to the new arrangement Bushire and other North ern Gulf Ports come under Shiraz, Bandar Abbas, under Kerman and Mohammerah under the Ahwaz Command. About 250 Infantry arrived at Bushire from Khuzistan on the 3rd Sep tember and left immediately for Shiraz. The General Officer Commanding the new Shiraz area, Sartip Abul Hasan Khan, Fars, twice visited Bushire in the month of September. On the 23rd November S. S. 'Bahristan' of Messrs. Strick Scott and Company discharged for the Persian Government 500 cases of bombs and 80 cases of fuses shipped by Messrs. A. &amp; G. Valicki and Co., Marseilles. Sartip Nasir-ud-Dowlah arrived from Tehran during November to audit the military accounts. On the 25th November, His Majesty the Shah arrived at Bushire from Mohammerah accompanied by Sardar Asad, Minister of War, and Sartip Murteza Khan, Inspector General of Troops. The Sartip inspected the barracks on the 26th November and the whole party left for Shiraz on the 27th of November. By the close of the year, the Bani Taruf trouble at Huwaiza in Khuzis tan had practically been settled, but military operations were still in pro gress against Iman Quli Khan, leader of Mamasani and Amir Dost Muham mad Khan of Bampur. The distribution of troops in the Bushire Area was estimated to be roughly as follows :— Bushire .. Chaghadak Borazjan .

Neiv Air Routes, (a) The 'Junkers' Weekly Air Mail Service between Busmre and Tehran_ (under contract with the Persian Government) com menced its regular service on 21st April and has maintained a regular and highly efficient service since. The ordinary single propeller machine has been in use, and both passen ger and goods' planes are now regularly running. It is said that larger twin engined passenger machines are on order. At the commencement an aeroplane lef't Tehran each Friday arriving Busnire the same day six hours later and returned to Tehran the 'following morning. The arrangement did not give much time for replies to be sent to eiran. From the ISth October 'Junkers' wisely changed this. Now the mail aeroplane arrives on Thursday and leaves again the following Sunday. Ine public find this arrangement much more convenient. On Fridays and Saturdays the mail aeroplane makes special trips to Mohammerah and Bandar ADDas. As the tast up mail steamer arrives at Bushire on Wednesday and the down mail on Sunday, the new timings are especially convenient for overseas travellers. ^ j 1 n ^ le r ^ iran ' ^ le stopping places en route are Shiraz after l 4 nours, and Isfahan after 3^ hours. Junkers have maintained verv regu lar timings since they started their service and have had no accident. To eir credit, it must be said, they have established a great name for regula- ri y? civility and safety in Bushire, and they are deservedly popular. In September the Post Olffilce notified that it had established connection S . rS; 0pean If ternafclon al Air Services via Russia, and that the Persian ost Uimce would accept postal matter for foreign countries. Actually it is now possible for a passenger to travel from London to Bushire ma Berlin, Moscow, Baku and Tehran, though a fast through service has yet to be arranged. When this comes Imperial Airways Limited will n com P e ^ tor f or ^e 'Junkers' route will actually be the shorter oi the two. (Z&gt;) Negotiations between Imperial Airways and the Persian Government tor the through London-India service via Baghdad have made good progress during the year under review. &amp; r a Flights, British.—(a) A British aeroplane, the 'Princess Xenia' arrived in Buslnre on the 13th June piloted by Captain Barnard with the Duchess of Bedford on board. The aeroplane left Bushire for Karachi but after a short !i ,g oo re 1 tU . rn f d owm g' to engine trouble, and had to remain in Bushire until the iind of August, when it reached Karachi. The same aeroplane returned to Bushire on the 2nd September and left next morning for Croydon Captain Barnard's flight was one of 5,000 miles in U days. His various stoppages froin Karachi were Bushire, Aleppo and Sofia, whence he flew 1,400 miles to Croydon. (j) His Majesty's seaplane 'Iris' with Sir Phillip Sassoon on board passed over Bushire on the 16th October on its way to India. The machine was later held up at Henjam owing to a mishap to the engine. On its way trn C nKl o r0m TV, n w' t ^ e . I ? la ^ llne to land at Jask, again owing to engine . e y a Force, Karachi, rendered necessary assistance and eventually arranged a machine to convey Sir Phillip Sassoon and party back to England. The Ins' finally passed over Bushire on the 1st Nov ember on her way to Iraq. Although permission had been obtained, the machine did not land at Bushire. i-, * ^ C \ a f terno on of the 17th October, aeroplanes Nos. H.-22 and M - t ? ^ arrived fr0Tn Basrah, with nursing sister Miss K. East of the Civil Hospital on board to attend a serious case of sick-6 ness. As permission had been granted by the Persian Government for one machine to land only, permission for the second to leave had to be obtained from Tehran. This was received on the 19th October when both machines •flew back to Basrah. (d) The Royal Air Force aeroplane c 'Hinaidi' arrived from Jask on th^ 26th October with Sir Phillip Sassoon and Sir Denys Bray, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., C.B.E., the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, on board [see (b) above]. It left again after a delay of a few hours for Baghdad. (e) The Ryan monoplane ''Spirit of Australia' with Captain Frank Hurley, Flying Olffiicers S.J. Moir and H. Owen of the Royal Australian Air Force, arrived at Bandar Abbas from Karachi on the 14th November. The Persian military authorities detained the machine on the excuse that Capt. Hurley had no permit to land at Bandar Abbas, although he had permission to land at Bushire. At the request of the Political Resident, the Governor of the Gulf Ports wired to Bandar Abbas to allow the machine to leave and the Legation was also asked to make the necessary representations at Tehran. On the 18th November the machine was allowed to leave Bandar Abbas. It reached Bushire the same day and left for Basrah en route for England. (/) A Royal Air Force aeroplane No. Y.-7745, Pilot, Lt. D. F. Ander son, which was flying from Baghdad to Karachi, made a forced landing on Bahmanshir Island near Mohammerah on the 12th December on account of engine trouble. {g) The Royal Air Force 'Victoria' machine with Sir Denys Bray, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., C.B.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, on board arrived from Basrah on the 16th December and the same day left for India via Bandar Abbas and Jask. (A) Two 'Victoria' machines of the Royal Air Force, Nos. J. 7926 and J.-8919 in charge of Squadron Leader R. I. Chapman arrived at Bushire on Christmas Day and left for India via Jask. {i) Messrs. Vincent and Newall in two De Haviland nine 'A' machines arrived at Bushire and left for Karachi on the 23rd April with halts at Bandar Abbas and Jask. Dutch. — {a) Two Dutch mail aeroplanes arrived from Amsterdam during the month of September en route to Java via Karachi and Calcutta. {h) During the month of October three more Dutch mail aeroplanes passed Bushire on their way from Amsterdam to Java. {c) A Fokker Monoplane H. Naen, Captain Aler, arrived Bushire from Karachi with mails from Batavia on the 12th November and left for Amster dam via Iraq. {d) A Fokker Monoplane No. Ph. Aen of the Royal Dutch Airways carrying mails from Amsterdam arrived Bushire on the 22nd December and left for Karachi en route to Batavia. Swiss. — O d the 7th November a small Swiss aeroplane arrived from Basrah manned by a pilot an'd a mechanic. The French Vice-Consul looked after them as representing Swiss interests. The machine left for Karachi on the 10th via Bandar Abbas but was forced to land at Jask owing to engine trouble. It later proceeded to Karachi. German.—{a) A Junker's aeroplane arrived from Tehran on the 20th January and proceeded to Mohammerah to carry from there to Tehran ten wireless valves received from France for use in the Persian Government Station,.at the Capital. The first two batches of ten valves having been smashed in transit by road, this third set had to be sent by aeroplane. (&amp;) Junker's aeroplane D.-921 arrived from Tehran on the 5th March with two American passengers for Mohammerah for which place she left next morning. {c) On the 19th July a special monoplane of the Junker's Company D.- 921 arrived from Tehran with Persian Quarantine Doctors as passengers and proceeded to Bander Abbas. It returned to Tehran via Bushire on the20th. The same machine arrived from Tehran on the 24th July and con veyed more doctors to Jask and Bandar Abbas. It returned to Tehran the next day. {d) A German aeroplane No. D.-1198 Junkers W.-336/2506 arrived Bushire from Baghdad. As it did no't carry a permit from the Persian Government to pass over Persia, the military held it up from 21st Septem ber to 25th on which date it was allowed to leave permission having been obtained from Tehran. It left for Karachi, whence it was to proceed to Calcutta and Tokio and America. It was owned by Baron Hynefeld, Pilot Lindmer and mechanic Langerich forming the crew. (e) A German light single seater 2 cylinder aeroplane was expected from Tehran on the 24th September with Freiherr Koenig Von Und Zu Werthausen on board, but it failed to arrive, owing to a forced landing at Abadeh, a point between Isfahan and Shiraz. This machine with Freiherr Koenig on board finally arrived at Bushire on the 18th October. It left Bushire on the 1st November for Bandar Abbas, Jask and Charbar en route to Karachi. It landed at Bandar Abbas on the 2nd November and left for Jask the same day but was forced to land at a place 60 miles from Bandar Abbas. It returned to Bandar Abbas and finally flew to Karachi on the 5th November. This flight was really a remarkable performance if the minute size of the machine be taken into consideration. Section 6. Arrivals. (a) Prince Firuz Mirza, G.C.M.G., Minister of Finance, Tehran, arrived at Bushire on the 14th April from Shiraz and left for Mohammerah on the 19th. (b) His Imperial Majesty Reza Shah, accompanied by his Ministers, paid a visit to Khuzistan during the month of November and among other things declared the new railway and trunk road opened. The Cabinet Ministers accompanied by His Highness Taimurtash, Minister of Court, visited Mohammerah and Abadan on the 10th November and left for Tehran. His Majesty the Shah accompanied by Sardar Asad, Minister of War, Prince Akbar Mirza Sarim-ad-Dowlah, Mirza Ibrahim Khan Qawam, Sartip Murteza Khan and a few Majlis members visited Mohammerah on the 19th November and stayed there in the house of Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar, C.I.E., till the 24th November when he left for Bushire on board the British India Steam Navigation Company steamer 'Varsova'. His Majesty landed at Bushire on the 25th November. A separate report was submitted to Government about the Shah's visit. Section 7. ^Political situation. Conditions in Bushire probably differed little from those in other parts of Persia. The high tariffs on tea and sugar created a serious amount of economic pressure which was however substantially alleviated in Bushire and its neighbourhood 'by convenient smuggling. Conscription and a com pulsory form of head gear are not popular and there was certainly a notice able lack of enthusiastic display of loyalty on the occasion of the visit of His Majesty the Shah. There is probably however less interest in politics in Bushire and the coast towns, the population of which contains a larger strain of Arab, than in Persia proper. Local sanitary improvements are noticeable by their absence, probably due to the reluctance of Tehran to provide the necessary financial assistance, but the local olffi'cials have certainly been successful in maintaining law and order, and there is every semblance of working administrative machinery. A certain amount of desire by subordinate Persian officials to make things generally unpleasant, coupled with too zealous efforts to prevent smuggling, has created a situation of considerable difficulty on the Arab8 side, chiefly on the Trucial Coast, as the Arabs' maritime supremacy in the Gulf had resulted in Arab settlements and connections on the Persian Coast in places tha Persian sovereignty of which could not be denied. Section 8. Trade and Trade Facilities. Trade.—The harvest for 1928 was fairly good. Lack of rain in Feb ruary and March prevented the expectations of a bumper harvest, which were held earlier, from being realised, but there was no shortage of grain in the district and, compared to the last few years, the harvest may be consi dered as good. Trade generally continued to suffer from the lack of money caused by high customs duties, monopoly taxes and road tax, the proceeds of which the Government continues to accumulate in the Capital. A certain amount of this money is now being put back into circulation as the work on the railway advances, but this district does not benefit as the railway will not pass fhrough any part of it. The value of sugar imported showed a big decrease, but owing to a fall in world prices the weight imported remained about the same as last year. Imports of tea and cotton piecegoods showed a consider able decrease. The application in May 1928 of the new Persian Autonom ous Customs Tariff, which further increased customs duties on nearly all com modities, particularly luxury articles, proved another set back to trade. During 1928 the threatened Eussian economic invasion of the Gulf mate rialised and three Russian ships called at Bandar Abbas and Bushire—the S. S. 'Tobolsk' in June and the S. S. 'Michael Frunze' and 'Kommunist' in October and November. Their cargo consisted mainly of sugar and piece- goods. The effect of this re-entry of Russian trade into the Gulf has not proved so disastrous as was anticipated; the sugar imported did not sell well and the piecegoods, although popular on account of their cheapness, good design and exceptionally fast«colours, were not imported in suifficient quan tities to form a really serious menace to the pre-eminent position held by India and the United Kingdom in this market. Nevertheless the threat of competition and the low price of Russian goods undoubtedly had a disturb ing effect on the market while the continued infiltration of Russian goods down from the north to Isfahan and as far as Shiraz seriously affected the trade of Bushire as the distributing centre for imports to those towns and districts. Communications. —Motor transport continued to increase throughout the year and rates of hire fell until they were in the neighbourhood of one rupee per ton mile as opposed to approximately nine annas and a half per ton mile for animal transport. The Bushire-Shiraz road was maintained in tolerably good repair throughout the spring and summer and the road over some of the worst passes was widened and protected by parapets. The recent winter snow, however and the subsequent rapid thaw did a great deal of damage to the road sur- faces^, and this will take a great deal of time and money to put right again. Until the roads are properly metalled this damage will take place every rainy season. At present the Persian engineers content themselves with spreading loose earth over the bad portions of the road. No ramming or rolling in of stones is done. Very little work was done on the track across the Mashileh, the marshy tract separating Bushire Island from the mainland, and until such time as a better road is built over this soft, low lying ground which is subject to inundation, transport between Bnshire and Shiraz will be liable to interruption Tor some days after every fall of rain.1 \ lac !lt- Security.- Security was on the whole better than last year. During August there were a succession of robberies in the Mamassani area, perpe trated by the followers of Imam Quli Khan who was in open insurrection against the Government. Troops were however sent down from Isfahan and oiuraz and by the end of September security had been restored and remained good up to the end of the year. Smuggling .—In the town of Bushire itself smuggling was considerably reduced by the importation of fifth tufangchis from Kazeroon, who, not being friends or relations of the smugglers, were more willing than local tuiangchis to carry out preventive duty. This, however, had but little ettect on the general situation, as all the villages just outside the town con- tinue to sell smuggled goods and the townspeople now buy their supplies from these villages. Smuggling throughout the rest of the district and up- country showed a steady increase. The absence of robbery in the vicinity of Bushire such as occurred last year and were put down to smugglers, may in tact probably be attributed to the greater and more secure profits made in 'the smuggling trade itself. r Postal Facilities.—A motor postal service from Bushire to Shiraz oper ated with regularity throughout the greater part of the year. At the end of the summer the Junkers Aviation Company established a weekly air mail arriving Thursdays and leaving Sundays, between Bushire, Shiraz, Isfahan and lehran. This has made a great difference in the postal facilities to the interior as an answer can now be received from the Capital in five days instead of three weeks which is the minimum time for a reply by motor post. Foreign Commercial^ Enterprise .— R qyv Wassmus continues to farm at agnadak, or) ^ a ' r ^de of the Mashileh, but is not making much profit on his crops. During the winter months he supplements his earnings by hauling out motor lorries, which get stuck in the Mashileh mud, with his lord son tractor; he charges 20 Tomans per lorry. n i/w German Hansa line still runs a monthly service of steamers to the bult but German trade has not noticeably altered in volume. The Russian Steamship Service to the Gulf, mention of which has been made above, appears to have come to an end. Doubtless it proved too eco nomically unsound. r Opium. —4,730 cases of opium were shipped from Bushire in 192R t * against 6,369 in 1927 and 7,894 in 1926. a Of this number, 2,350 cases were shipped under license and 2,380 un- icensed. The apparent falling off in exports of Persian opium does not re present the true facts of the case, as the decrease is due to the Persian embargo on imported opium. Formerly, a large quantity of opium was impor ec into Peisia from India and remained in bonded warehouse until it was teshipped to the Far East, usually on false clearance papers showing the destination as India. The object of this was two-fold. Firstly to eet the opium out of India on clearances for Persia which then had no restric tions on import of opium ; and secondly to re-export it as Persian opium at a higher price as the morphine content might be expected to be larger than in the case of Indian opium. Persia has now forbidden the importation of opium and so put a stop to this trade. lW Th %u er i &amp;a . U ?T nmen ^ introduced an opium monopoly law in Julv 1928. The effect of this will probably be to raise the price of Persian XCnlv win h 1Ct prod ' ct '° n ' as . lt , ls ™likely that cultivation under the monopoly will be as profitable as it has been hitherto. According- to the r n 0 H 0P pnft ia T-' 0P1 T g ^ wers 'nst get permission to cultivate the poppy Oni.rn? ,l r T# an colleotlo n nrnst be supervised by the Government Upmm destined for consumption m Persia must be sold to the monopoly (imimstration and stored in Government warehouses. ^t Present opium for export must be prepared by the exporting let chants under Government supervision and is subject to a tax of -10 Tomans 200 per case. This tax is to be increased on March 21st 1929 to Tomans 250 per case. All previous taxes on exported opium are repealed The Government wants to extend the complete monopoly to opium for ex port as well as for consumption in the interior, but as yet they have not got the experts to prepare the opium properly and realise that they could not guarantee the morphine content. In these circumstances other countries are not likely to place contracts with the Persian Government. Conse quently the temporary expedient mentioned above has been introduced. It may be considered unlikely that the Government will ever really be in a position to carry out its desire and undertake the business of opium export ers. Section 9. Slavery. General. —During the year under review the following slaves were manumitted under orders from this Residency :— (a) Bahrein . {b) Muscat . (&lt;?) Lingah . [d] Bandar Abbas (#) Trucial Coast {/) Koweit • 11 males. 1 male. 1 female ^ N ote .—Through the f P. G, authorities, this Resi- Tdency also giving a Manu- 2 males J mission Certificate. 4 males. 3 females. 3 children. Nil. In addition to the above, 2 females and 2 children were rescued by the lioyal Navy from a dhow which arrived at Dabai from Wadam in Muscat territory on 9th December with 10 Baluchi slaves for sale. In spite of the Sheikh of Dabai rendering every possible assistance, six of the slaves (males) were spirited away into the interior before a British Warship actually arrived. The Sheikh was able, however, to seize the dhow and the two women and the two children mentioned above, and handed them all over to the Senior Naval Officer- The dhow was duly destroyed by fire as an example in full view of the town of Dabai and in the presence of the Admiral of the East Indies Squadron. APPENDIX I. Notes on working of Charitable Dispensary, Bushiri, during thb year 1928. Colonel A. N. Dickson, I. M. S., was in charge throughout the year. ^ Khan Bahadur Moula Baksh, I. M. D., was in Sub-charge of the Charitable Dispensary until the 22nd April and then proceeded to India on ,a&gt;ear s combined leave; he was relieved by Jemadar Mohammad Ali Najmi, I. M. D. ; .The number of patients admitted to Hospital during the year was a little less than the previous year, bedng 148 as compared with 156. The number of out-patients however showed a considerable decrease being 40,254 as compared with 47,298 for the previous year; this was due to the fact,11 that in September the Medical charge of the Customs, Post Office, and Finance Department was taken over by the Persian Chief Quarantine Medical Officer. The disease showing the highest incidence was as usual Malaria. The finances of the Hospital showed an excess of expenditure over income. The Customs department withdrew their contribution to the Hospital in September the Shahi voluntary tax was in arrears and averaged Tomans 110 per mensem which is about half the amount expected. The year conclurled with this tax three months in arrears. (Sd.) A. N. DICKSON, Lt.-Col, LM.S., Residency Surgeon, Bushire.

General. —The military detachment has been satisfactory during the year under Naib Azizallah Khan, who, since the visit to the area of the Mili tary Governor, Behbehan, in September has taken more active interest in his command. Agha Khan continues as Head of the Kashkuli Guards, which are now reduced to 22. Guarding arrangements in Ganawah continue excellent, thanks to the assistance and goodwill of Haider Khan, C.I.E. Kerim Khan, Bavi, still remains our Head Guard at Gach Qaraguli, and has given us every assistance during the year. Political. —Persistent rumours that Luhrasib and other Boir Ahmedi rebels intended directing their attentions to this area caused a certain amount of uneasiness during the summer months. Nothing untoward occurred, however, though at one time the O. C. Garrison deemed the situa tion called for reinforcements and ten additional nezamis were posted here for a few days. Though Taqi Beg, Kashkuli, and Boir Ahmedi rebels of the Chaq-i- Bazpa have continued their sporadic raiding, we have suffered no interfer ence- It is gratifying to record that the power of Taqi Beg has declined, and that the rebels were brought down from the Chaq in November and no longer endanger the area. The reappointment of Yawar Raksha as Ilkhani and Military Gover nor of the Qashqai in place of the mercenary and despotic Sultan Abbas Khan Nikbakht is generally approved of. As a consequence of this change, Isfandiar Khan dropped out of favour and although he still shares the Kalantarship of the Kashkulis with Tlyas Khan, the latter has now more influence in the Tribe. The Kashkuli Khans have returned to the area for the winter, and our relations with them remain friendly. In spite of the unsettled state of the Bavi Tribe, our operations N. of Zuhreh have continued unimpeded. Both Assad Khan and Ahmed Khan were summoned to Ahwaz in connection with Bavi affairs. Settlement has not yet been reached, the latest report being that Ahmed Khan is to share the Kalantarship with Assad Khan whose tyranny has been responsible for the disunity in the Tribe- Since the finding of oil in November, a keener interest by the Khans in our activities has become noticeable. The reason for this will be readily understood. Further feelers have been put out regarding the matter of compensation for land, etc. We have merely reiterated that the Central Government is the Authority to refer to. The main topic has been the activities of Imam Quli Khan and the Boir Ahmedi outlaws, and the progress of operations against them is being watched with interest. The reverses sustained by the Military and the Qashqai force have had a lowering effect on Government prestige, but it is generally felt that this is only temporary, and that with the arrival of ex pected reinforcements, the tide will turn in the favour of law and order. H. G. AUSTIN, M ishun ; The 10th January 1929,16 CHAPTER III. Summary of events and conditions in Fars during the year ended March 31st, 1929. Administratively the province of Fars has been drastically reduced in size and importance by (i) the Kuhgihi and Behbehan being taken away and placed under Sartip Farajullah Khan, the Governor of Khuzistan, (ii) Dashti and Dashtistan being taken away in September on the appointment of Muzaffar Khan A'lam as Governor of the Gulf Ports and confided to him (this is however by no means the first period when this area has been subordi^ nate to Bushire), (iii) the Central Government in March 1929 terminating the hereditary governorship of the Qawam over all the districts of eastern Fars from iasa to Darab, Lar, Sab'eh and the borders of the Bandar Abbas zone and the small Gulf Ports north of Lingeh, as well as of the Khamseh nomad tribes; and sending Sartip Abul Hasan Khan Zandieh from Tehran as Mmtary Governor of the whole with, as he states, independence of control by the Governor-General of Fars. His headquarters are to be at Lar, and the limits of his administration are exactly those held by Qawam.

Ibrahim Khan Nujumi, Superintendent of the Persian Telegraphs since 1922, a corrupt official and dangerous mischief-maker, who had used his post to be a spy and informer for certain persons while taking bribes from others, and who had worked against the Indo-European Telegraph Department in matters of building under the line, wilful damages, and other ways, met his deserts in August: when he was summarily put on the unemployed list: it is understood that he was considered to have misled the Government in Tehran by false reports mdnimizing or hiding the insecurity of the province, and abetting thus the Amir Lashkar. Though the Indo- European Telegraph Department had vacated the building in the telegraph garden in town since 1925, in order to facilitate the housing of the post- office in a Persian Government-owned building adjoining other local ad ministrations, Ibrahim Khan Nujumi had prevented the Post-office from occupying it till 1928. On the arrival in October of Ghulam Ali Khan Arbabi as Acting Director both telegraph and post offices were combined administratively under him, Haidar Khan Tiraz till then Director of Posts being retained as Assistant. Early in May the President of the Appeal Court and Director of the Judicial Department, Mirza Abdul Husain Khan Sadri, at his own request was transferred to Tehran, and in July Mirza Abdullah Khan Mustaufi (or Garakani) a former head of the tribunal of the Ministry of Einance, arriv ed in his place- In the same month the Director of Public Health, Dr. Sayyid Abdul Ali Khan Tibbi, was removed because of complaints as to his , bad conduct with patients and extortion : a certain Dr. Abdullah Khan has been appointed in his room. Two new provincial administrations were opened, and directors sent from Tehran : (i) in September Ali Naqi Mirza Nauban arrived in Shiraz to start an Opium Control, entirely independent of the Provincial Finance Department. Up till the end of the period under review however the affairs of the office were in confusion and receipts from the new excise duties far less that what was anticipated : in December too Ali Naqi Mirza left and no appointment has been made since : (ii) in August Sayyid Ali Akbar Khan Shaikh-ul-lslami, a Tabrizi who has made a good impression, came to Shiraz and in October opened a branch of the department for the 'Registra tion of Documents and Properties'. Applications for registration are coming in more plentifully that the department can settle, the whole pro cess taking about 5 months. Only the Provincial Director of Finance, Mirza Humayun Khan Sayyah, and of Education, Abul Qasim Khan Fiwuzat, were unchanged in the period : both continued to do good work. In district governorships, Zain-ul-Abidin Khan Mbrat, formerly a deputy-governor at Bandar Abbas, was appointed to Kazarun in April, but transferred in May to Narmashir in Kerman province. In July Fath Ali Khan Fani (known as Khan Baba Khan) from Abadeh was transferred to Kazarun. From Dashti and Dashtistan (Burasjan) Khadin Khan Hakimi was transferred in July to Niriz, Basir-ud-Dauleh (Rad) being sent from Istahbanat to Burazjan. In August Haji Mirza Husain, for over 30 years either French Con sular Agent at Shiraz or acting French Vice-Consul at Bushire, died : a successor has not yet been announced. Insecurity increased from the previous year, as the Military Com manded less and less respect, and, if the list of incidents and robberies is long and given in some detail here, it is so that the widespread character of the disorders and relative helplessness of the government forces to stifle them may be grasped. 7J.F&amp;PD18 In April one bale and one case of drugs were carried off north of Daliki shots being exchanged between the bandits and Amnieh. Numerous rob beries and raids were perpetrated in the Kuhgdlu, and one near Dehbid by Boir Ahmedi bands. In Qir and Karzin a, Kadkhuda was killed by a Margumari band (Qashqai). In May a car was attacked at the Mukhak pass on the road to Jahrum, and a man wounded. A detachment sent to pursue the assailants was itself in difficulties and 50 soldiers had to be sent off hastily to extricate them. In the same month above the Tang-i-Turkan pass between Kazarun and Kamarji a band from Banau attacked a car, rob bing two well known ladies of Shiraz in it, and a large stone hurled by one robber crushed the skull of a small child, whose father is in the employ of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Sixteen loads of sugar and cottons were carried off at Gunbid-i-Sabz, 8 miles north of Shiraz : while in the Firu- zabad district Qareh and bis band began pillaging the harvest and wounded several villagers- There was a bad robbery on the Shiraz-Niriz road about 1.6 miles the Shiraz side of Niriz, when a band of 35 descended on 3 motor lorries halted in a dust storm, relieving the passengers, under threats of death, if they moved, of some 7,000 tumans and 20 bales of cottons and bundles of ready-made clothing. By this time the Amnieh guards -were not allowing even mule caravans to pass at night between Daliki and Zinian. A soldier was shot dead at Rahdar by a robber and several petty robberies occurred between Kazarun and Kamarij at the end of June : on the Behbehan-Pazanan road the Bear Ahmedis attacked Military posts killing 2 and wounding 2 men. and three Amnieh guards on the Behbehan-Dilam road, besides carrying off flocks from villages in that region. In July more sweeping raids were made than at any time since the new Persian army came into existence. On the 9th the garrison at Kazarun stirred up a hornets' nest when with local levies they attacked Banau village hoping to catch the leaders of that band, but only infuriated the Banauis by killing two women and several villagers. On the 12th the telegraph wires were cut away for about 500 yards and insulators smashed four miles south of Kazarun : one iron standard was broken and thrown down the Kamarij kutal. On the 13th in the Tang-i-Turkan some 80 mounted Boir Ahmedis and 40 on foot led by the notorious Luhrasp, carried off 84 mules and their loads belonging to two caravans. Three days later a motor lorry was attack ed and burnt four miles north of Kazarun by the Banaui band. On the 19th July the Banauis carried off 25 mules with their loads from a caravan of tea and piece-goods at Churum (between Kunar Takhteh and Kamarij) : on the 29th a lorry carrying an Indian sowar of the Residency ran into a skirmish between the Banauis and Amnieh and military guards on the Rudak kutal and had to use his rifle in defence of the lorry- On the 31st the same band of some 60 men surrounded Kamarij village, which had to be relieved b^ troops being hurried from Kazarun and adjoining posts. Earlier in the month a deputation of farmers and peasants from Firuzabad district carae to complain of pilfering by Qareh and his band, with whom about the 20th a military detachment there had an unsuccessful brush. On the night of August 1st a lorry belonging to an 'Iraqi Jew residing at blnraz, en route to Yazd with merchandise, was shot up at Ab-barik, 17 mi es rem Shiraz on the main road to Isfahan, a French Syrian protege being Med outright, and the driver an 'Iraqi being mortally wounded On u 1 ona tel ® gra P h Wlr ? s were cut 7 miles north of Kazarun by the Banaui band 600 yards of wire being removed : while on the 4th a car, also owned and driven by an Iraqi, coming from Kerman with passengers was fired on by two men m the gorge 3 miles beyond the tomb of Sa'di outside Shiraz, the H w r 1 '' a ? othe f 1 Ira V la ^ having his lung and spine hit, and o afterwards m hospital. On the 10th: a car was attacked in the lang-i-Kaumz between Fasa and the Niriz-Shiraz road. On the 21st the -Banauis attacked a ruined caravansarai in the Dashti-i-Barm • while two ndles from 6 Shiraz 8° E SUrkhl trlbe 0arilied 0ff large flocks 111 Kwar 4519 In September, on the 15th the telegraph wire was again cut between the Tang-i-Turkan and Kamarij, while on the 14th at Ja'farjin on the road between Kamarij and Kunar Takhteh one brother of the Kalantar of Khisht district shot his nephew and another brother with 40 armed followers then looted the village, this leading to fighting between the latter and Amnieh guards. A large caravan of specie for the Bank had required an escort of 50 soldiers from Bushire, and great nervousness was shown by the military during its passage to and beyond Shiraz- On the 30th August, Sultan Abbas Khan Nikbakht, for a year and more Military Governor of the Qash- qai tribes, was arrested for a treasonable act by orders of the General, and kept in prison till December, during which period Sartip Nasr-ud-Dauleh from Tehran made a searching enquiry into allegations of great extortion and oppression put forward by tribesmen and chiefs against their Governor. (After the change of General commanding the brigade he was reinstated in January, but found the clansmen united against him and was unable to restore his authority or even reach Firuzabad. He was recalled to Tehran in March 1929 and replaced by a Sarhang Qasim Khan, sent specially from Tehran). The great event of September was however the concentration by the 30th at Kazarun of some 1,150 infantry, 280 cavalry, 2 field guns and 12 machinc-guns with gunners, in order to subjugate Imam Quli Khan, chief of the Rustam clan of Mamasanni, who had not only been anathema to the absentee owner of the Mamasanni trdbes, Haji Mu'm-ut-Tujjar of Tehran, for years, but was hejd guilty of having allowed the Boir Ahmedi brigands to use his district for their raid on the Bushire-Shiraz road of the 13th July: By the middle of October there had been two small engagements, in which the military lost 5 killed and 12 wounded, their local levies 7 killed and 10 wounded, the Rustam tribesmen 2 only : their chief fired his villages on the plains and retired to his forts in the hills at Naugak. On the 23rd Low-' ever the military suffered a heavy reverse as the result of infantry and machine gunners becoming entangled in a gorge in a rash pursuit of the tribesmen, who had been joined by % Boir Ahmedi bands and their Khans' 32 ranks were killed or captured, 3 officers killed, 2 made prisoners : 2 offi cers and 25 ranks wounded and sent to hospital at Fahlian, whither the force fell back : 2 machine guns were lost and much ammunition abandoned. 1 he General commanding the brigade then engaged several hundred Qashqai, whom he armed; but in an attack about November 16th on the outlying towers of Imam Quli Khan at Naugak the auxiliaries and soldiers supporting them again suffered a defeat, 25 soldiers, 40 Qashqai and 37 levies from other Mamasannji elements being reported killed. Phis expedition had already proved more costly than the whole of the Baluchistan operations : and, when the iShah reached Kazarun on the 27th ^, ov 1 e f n ^ p i r '. he deputed Sartip Murteza Khan and Sartip Muhammad Khan bhahbakhti (who had arrived with the armoured cars to escort His Majesty) to examine and report on the situation- Sartip Abul Hasan Khan was relieved of his command and replaced by the latter of the two first named generals : and some 400 men of the Rizapur regiment with 6 machine ffuns were summoned from Tehran and arrived on the 16th December at Shiraz the 28th January in Mamasanni. There at the camp in Fahlian this force of over 1,4 00 men remained inactive on the one side of the Zuhreh river (in flood for part of the time), while endeavours were made to open negotiations with Imam QuH Khan in the mountains on the other. The Governor of Khuzistan, Sartip Farajullah Khan, was brought up to Behbehan during February to try and obtain by diplomacy from that side the submission of the Boir Ahmedi chiefs, who are m his jurisdiction, and of Imam Onli' Khan. To save their face, which had been much blackened anions the tribes of southern Fars watching the result of this expedition, the military and civ 1 ! officials sedulously spread abroad statements that the Rusti™ chief had surrendered the rifles of his tribe, agreed to pay many thousand xumans as a fine and give hostages as also similarly the Boir Ahmedis But the truth is well-known in the surrounding region that by March 13th20 when the whole force was withdrawn from Mamasanni and hurried back to Sliiraz ^he miHtary had failed to get the better of Imam guh Khan, who remained unsubdued in his forts and villages. The impression on the tribal chiefs was not long in manifesting itself. Already at the end of October the blood-feud between the Angah Khans id Aqa Khan of Shabankareh had broken out on the coast-plain (though this improperly no longer part of Pars), and on the 31st December the Zabit v T^ncnQtm was attacked by a local headman at the head of a paitv and ? u f S of Shiraz in Baiza district in Noyember the Boir Ahmedi outlaw Mir Ghulam (see report for year ending March 1928) had plundered two villages, and had the effrontery to give a signed receipt for the land revenue' he had taken, while further depredations took place m other northern districts. ^ i_ j- j But it was in the Firuzabad region and districts round, where disorder became most ^pronounced- A new military governor of the Qashqai on his way there in November had to leave his baggage en route on account of 7isk of robbery. By January Mahdi, leader of the gurkhi tribe, with a band of several hundred men made up chiefly from small Qashqai clans, carried off a caravan for Maimand and blockaded another military official m a village of Khwajai district. On the 4:th March AH Khan Qashqai (half-brother of Saulai-ud- Dauleh), Who had left his village near Adadeh m north Fars and joined the Qashqai in their winterquarters, ostensibly with Saulat s connivance, some months before was announced to be at the head of various elements which declared they Would no longer tolerate military governors and would not go on the northern migration in the spring (when, according to talk there had been an intention by the government authorities to number and taxthe Qashqai flocks, as well as to settle these nomads m villages.) With a larce following he had arrived in Firuzabad district and was liberally distributing Saulat's stores of grain. On the 10th a band of 60 Surkhis carried off flocks from Lapui and Dudeh, villages near Zarqan on the isla- han road, and from Kalat northwest of Shiraz driving them back across the main motor road, 8 miles from Zinian, in open daylight on the 14th. n the 12th four separate villages in Kawar district had flocks carried oft, or were raided ; and on the 13th there was much excitement in Shiraz town at rumours that the insurgents were only 12 miles away and were drawing near Shiraz several hundred strong. Lorries were requisitioned : parties of conscripts from Isfahan (there were not more than 50 regular soldiers in. Shiraz from January till mid March) were sent in the night to posts com manding the town. Simultaneously the Governor-General was recalled to town, and Sartip Abul Hasan Khan arrived to take over the districts and tribes hitherto under the jurisdiction of Qawam-ul-Mulk. In such a troubled situation the troops hurried back from Mamasanni, the cavalry by a forced march, the infantry arriving on the 20th March 1929- During March too the situation in Jahrum district, 100 miles south east of Shiraz, was compromised. The Governor arrested a Jarkani Qashqai : the latter's brother, a notorious freebooter named Keiamars, stopped motorcars on the Shiraz-Jahrum road, held the occupants as host ages till the Jarkani in Jahrum had been released, then went off plundering a village near. On the 22nd a riot took place in this town over the wearing of Pahlawi caps, one Amnieh guard being killed and four townsmen. Hurriedly 100 infantry had to be sent out. 'Sartip Abul Hasan Khan has asked for 300 soldiers to be given him before he starts from Shiraz for Fasa- and Lar. Further incidents in this year of deteriorating security were : the closing of the bazars, in protest at the calling up of youths of age to be con scripted, from the 5th to 9th October, and a riot outside mosques, leading to the troops firing on the crowd. By the end of March 1929 however out of 600 youths from 21 to 24 years old marked down as not exempted only 220 had appeared, or been brought into the barracks. 'Elections' to the21 Medjliss were declared closed on August 1st, three of the past deputies for Shiraz being 're-elected'; but there was little or no genuine voting. Early and sudden melting of the snows on the mountains in north-west Fars at the end of February caused extensive floods in all the rivers and dry beds, especially between Pul-i-Khan and Zarqan 21 miles north of Shdraz, and at the Kara-agach bridge on the Bushire road, both routes north and south being closed to vehicular traffic for three weeks, and damage on the Bushire road alone being estimated at 100,000 tumans to repair- A Belgian engin eer arrived in March 1929 to make a reconnaissance on the route via Firuza- bad to Bushire. for which the Government is said to be allowing 100,000 tumans towards construction work. Telephone lines were opened bv the Telephone concessionary company to Jahrum and Darab and Lar, as well as Fasa: while in January this company authorized a sub-concessionnaire to run a line from Bushire to Isfahan, which was under construction at the end of the period. The economic situation became increasingly bad during the year, nearly all trade being hard hit by taxation and monopolies, a depression accentuated by the dumping at cut-throat prices of cotton-goods and sugar by Soviet trade agencies. A branch of the Soviet bank was opened in July. CHAPTER IV. Administration Report of the Consular District of Bandar Abbas and Lingah for the year 1928. Personnel. !. . ! i i Bandar Ahhas. —Mr. G. A. Richardson, O.B.E., held the post of His Majesty's Vice-Consul with the personal rank of Consul throughout the iyear. Lingah. —Assistant Surgeon J. W.

Bandar A hhas. —MIRZA ABBAS QULI KHAN ERAM (IQBAL- UL-MULK) proceeded on leave to TEHRAN on the 25th July and was relieved as Governor on the 5th October by AGHA SYED ABDULLAH KHAN MIR-I-FAKHRAI (MUDDABAR-UL-MULK), the local Post master and the Acting Rais-i-Nazmieh respectively performing the duties ad interim. The present incumbent AGHA SYED ABDULLAH KHAN was many years ago the Chief of Police at KERMAN. He is a quiet old gentleman and appears to be well disposed towards us. In October, AGHA MAHOMED ALI KHAN (SADTD-I- SULTANEH), the Assistant to the Governor of the Gulf Ports at BUSHIRE, visited BANDAR ABBAS between the 23rd October and 8rd December. Although ostensibly on inspection, the object of his visit is not known, as he did not intervene in administrative matters here. 71 F&amp;PD ' .22 His movements from and to BUSHIRE caused some suspicion. En route from LING AH he called at Persian BASIDU and on his return iourney from BANDAR ABBAS he tried unsuccessfully to touch at DUBAI. Minab. —MIRZA NASSURULLAH KHAN HIKMET, the Deputy Governor, handed over charge on proceeding on leave to TEHRAN on the 19th February to MIRZA ALI KHAN AZAD who also went on leave to SHIRAZ on the 24th September. During the remainder of the year, the Amin-i Malieh and SYED ABDUL HUSSAIN MINABI, the son-in-law of SADID-I-SULTANEH, nominally performed the duties of the post. Ling ah, —MIRZA REZA KHAN MUHAQAQ AMIN who had been Deputy Governor since the 7th October 1927, owing to trouble with his colleagues, abandoned his post and sailed secretly on the 8th June. On account of the same trpuble, he left in a sailing boat and came to BANDAR ABBAS in April but was ordered to return to headquarters by Tehran to whom he had complained by telegraph. REZA KHAN MUHAQAQ was a very weak administrator, being entirely under the intiuence of his Munshi. He was moreover idle and dis solute and practically useless for the post, and had had no previous admi nistrative experience. It is said that he had once been a servant in the per sonal employ of the ex-Shah. The Rais-i-Nazmieh officiated for a time. The permanent incumbent AGHA ABDUL SAHKUR? (MISHTAQ-ES-SULTANEH) arrived on the 1st November and i?emained in office till the end of the year. AGHA ABDUL SAHKUR? who has not properly shown his hand gives one the impression of being fond of pomp and ceremony. He is handicapped by the re-instatement of the old Munshi MIRZA HUSSAIN, who is believed to be notoriously anti-British and has the reputation of Joeing an evil genius. Karguzarate. Bandar A bbas. —The post has been in abeyance throughout the district teince July last year. The late incumbent MIRZA AZZIZULLAH KHAN SARKAR who on some pretext or other remained on here at last left for SHIRAZ on the ^th June. Finance Department. Bandar A bbas.—Monsieur MISRUP KHAN was recalled to TEHRAN and relieved of his duties as AMIN-I-MALIEH on the 7th March bein^ replaced by MIRZA ABDUR RIZA KHAN, a former Amin-i-Malieh, who remained in office till the end of the year. Minab . —MIRZA MAHOMED ALI KHAN KHURSHIDI, the Accountant of the Revenue Office, held the acting appointment for the greater part of the year. Ling ah. —MIRZA ABDUR RIZA on transfer to BANDAR ABBAS in Jsuiua.ry by MIEZA MOHAMED HUSSAIN KHAN o U K b oil/ADJiH who continued to hold the appointment throughout the Posts and Telegraphs. Bandar A bhas. SYED ZAMAN SAIF, who arrived from JASK in December 1927, was Postmaster throughout the year. In October he assumed charge of the J eiegraphs on the amalgamation of the two offices. His administration was satisfactory on the whole, but unfortunately he was given to political intriguer 123 In Jane, MIRZA HASSAN KHAN (SHAHRUZI), the Provincial Director of Posts for the Gulf Ports, arrived from BUSHIRE for inspec tion. He brought MIRZA ALI MAHOMED KHAN WAJDI, the ex-Post^ master, with him with the object of holding an enquiry into the circum stances of the disappearance of certain packets of Indian currency notes from the Bandar Abbas Post Office Registration bag for which WAJDI was believed to be responsible. No finding of the so-called enquiry has hitherto been announced. Telegraphs. Since May 10th, the Persian office has dealt with tele grams in foreign languages intended for places in Persia. The service has not proved quite satisfactory and mesisages are often considerably delayed in transmission. Moreover, the operators do not appear to be acquainted with any foreign language. Telephone. -The local merchants have subscribed for the construction of a telephone line connecting BANDAR ABBAS with the town of MINAB situated 48 miles to the east. It is expected that the service will be established in 1929 and adminis tered by the General Telephone Company in Persia. Lingah . —MIRZA ALI AKHBAR continued to hold the office of Post master during the year. His administration was satisfactory. Municipality. Some slight improvement was observed in the state of the town since the arrival of the new Governor AGHA SYED ABDULLAH KHAN. Ihe streets in the bazaars have been widened and arrangements made for ventilation. The old mat roofs have been removed to enable the sun to penetrate. The sanitation of the town generally has been entrusted to the Persian Quarantine Doctor, who is now in charge of the Health Department of the whole district. Meetings of the Municipal Committee are held twice weekly to discuss the affairs of the town. Lingah.- ~The sanitary condition of the town is deplorable. The Muni cipal board under the presidency of SYED MAHOMED AHMED ISHAQ ,HOODI only exists in name. i. Police Department. Bandar Ahbas. In July, the strength of the local police was brought up to &lt;50 men under the command of a Naib. Nevertheless, the establish ment of regular police here instead of Tufangchis has not as yet justified the innovation, and no greater security to life and property has been afford ed to the inhabitants. Thirteen men were recruited at Bandar Abbas and the strength ot the town police is now 1 25 men and one officer. , Hitherto no Amnieh guards have been stationed here but the Officer m command of the BAFT-BANDAR ABBAS section of the'road 1 irom KLRMAN used to pay occasional visits during the year. In October a post with eight men under a WAKIL BASHI was estab- lished. Education Department {Mu'arif). Bando^r A bhas. MIRZA ALI DASHTY was in charge of the depart ment throughout the year. It may be observed that greater attention was paid to the cause of education in this town and some improvement noticed in the state of the school and welfare of its pupils under the present director s superintendence, r24 V i Customs. Bandar 6to.—Monsieur A. Fourman, the Provincial Director of Customs, was transferred to MOHAMMEEAH and was succeeded by MIRZA ABDUL MAJID KHAN TADJBAKSH from LING AH. This is the first occasion since the reorganisation or rather establish ment of a regular Customs service in Persia under Belgian administration that a Persian official has been appointed permanently to the post. Monsieur FOURMAN, who was on three previous occasions Director at BANDAR ABBAS, was correct and just in hi % s dealings and was popular with both Persian and foreign merchants. The advent of his successor was hailed with strong protests on the part of the local Persian merchants who telegraphed to the Central Administra tion opposing his appointment but without result. ,His notorious antece dents at LING AH and elsewhere were too well known to the merchantile /community and his staff. He is decidedly anti-British and is moreover reputed to be Bolshevic in his tendencies. Simultaneously with the abrogation of the foreign Capitulations, the new Customs tariff was enforced. Consequent on the arrival of a settlement with the fugitive Shaikh of HENJAM, a new customs post was established at the Shaikh's village, mainly to serve as an observation post to prevent the smuggling of sugar and tea to the mainland. The customs motor dhow was engaged actively patrolling the coast, especially at the 6nd of the year. Lingah. —Monsieur NISSAN HAIM, a Meshed Jew, assumed charge of the duties of Director from Monsieur ABDUL MAJID KHAN T4DJBAKSH on his transfer to BANDAR ABBAS. The new director is not popular with the merchants. It is said that he is given to intrigue to which a great deal of trouble at this port has Been attributed. He is a weak official and is greatly influenced by his Inspector, a certain MIRZA HAIDAR. The coastal patrol launch effected a few captures! of contraband mer chandise and dhows engaged in illicit traffic, and suffered and inflicted some casualties in its operations. Nevertheless, that traffic is still rife, especially along the SHIPKU Coast where it is openly aided and abetted by the Shaikhs and subordinate customs officials. There was a tendency on the part of the customs patrol service to extend their operations outside their territorial limits. Persian Troops. —Yawar MAHMUD KHAN PARWIN was in com mand of the battalion of Persian troops stationed in this part of the Gulf which garrison the ports of BANDAR ABBAS, J ASK and CHARBAR and the MINAB district. There was a marked improvement in the discipline and morale of the troops under his command. Yawar MAHMUD KHAN, who is described as an honest and conscien tious official, is smart in appearance and is an efficient soldier. Lingah.- -Owing to continued friction with the local inhabitants, the garrison was withdrawn in August 1926. . y iew &gt; however, of the trouble with the local Shaikhs arising from t e 1 ^ 1 cit trade being carried on along the SHIPKU Coast with their conni vance, 16 men under the command of SULTAN ISMAIL KHAN were landed from the Gun Boat 'PAHLAVI' in April and have since been stationed there as a permanent garrison.25 Condition of the Country. Bandar A bbas. —Several thefts were reported to have occurred in the town, five of which were committed in the houses of British Indian traders, tlje aggregate value of the goods removed therefrom amounting to Krans 7,800. No part of the stolen property was afterwards recovered. One murder was committed in the heart of the town and the Head Cashier of the Customs wag arrested by the Police on suspicion. After pre liminary investigations were made, he was sent to BUSHIRE for trial. On the whole, the state of the district was fairly quiet and peaceful and no military operations were undertaken. In May, about 160 men with three machine guns under the command of Yawar MAHMUD KHAN PAR WIN embarked on the Gun Boat PAHLA\ I and two* customs launches for HENJAM to punish the Shaikh for the attack made by his followers on the Customs House in March 1927 in which the Customs Mudir was killed. On the approach of the Persian force, the Shaikh and his followers escaped in sailing boats to KASAB on the opposite Arabian Coast. The village at OLD HEN JAM was occupied without any opposition, and a detachment of troops under two Persian officers was posted on the island. Ling ah. —In January, one murder was committed in the town and another was reported in June to have occurred in the neighbourhood. The murderer in the latter case was arrested shortly afterwards with the assist ance of the Shaikh of MUGHU, but succeeded in stabbing one of his escort whilst being transported to LINGAH. Condition of the Roods. —Bashakardi tribesmen were again Hactive during the first six months of the year on the TANG-I-ZINDAN route of the KEIiMAN-BANDAR ABBAS road, during which they made four attacks on caravans snd succeeded in looting some merchandise being trans ported from KERMAN. In one of their attacks the weekly post was carried ofi but afterwards recovered. Later, they extended their activities to the i ANG-I-NOVERGOON route. The outlaw IBRAHIM KHAN SHAMILI also made two attacks on caravans from KERMAN passing through his district. He was arrested subsequently but released on giving an undertaking to desist from inter ference and to safeguard the passage of caravans through his territory. Bandar A hhas-Minah Road. —This was open throughout the year and was fairly safe. Only one petty case of looting was reported. Road Com*truction. —Some progress was made during the year in re pairing the road from KERMAN to BANDAR ABBAS via the TANG-I- ZAGH. It is expected that the road will be open for motor traffic bv the NAU-ROZ {i.e., March 21, 1929). Ling ah. —A project was under consideration for the construction of a motor road between LINGAH and EAR via the SHIPKU Coast. Slave Traffic.- -Three slaves from Persian Baluchistan sought asylum m this Consulate and were granted certificates of manumission. Ling ah. The Consular Agent experienced a great deal of trouble with the local authorities who took no action whatever in regard to fugitive slaves whom he handed over for the issue of manumission papers. The cases of eight slaves' Having Persian masters and one remaining trom the preceding year were transmitted to the Deputy Governor but not a single one was disposed of. The matter was reported to the Governor- General of the Gulf Ports through the Residency at BUSHIRE but the instructions issued by His Excellency failed to elicit any result whatever. Growing impatient at the delay experienced, six of the above absented tnemselves from the Consular Agency having sought emplovment or return ed to their former masters. The remaining three were still awaiting dh posal at the end of the year. ^ 71F&amp;PD ' ' ■26 In addition, two other slaves of Arab nationality were freed under the orders of the Hon'ble the Political Resident. A viation. Cairo-Karachi Air Mail and Passenger Service.—This did not material ise, owing to the objections raised by the Persian Medjliss who dec med to ratify the agreement previously entered into with the Persian Government. Movements of Aircraft. —Fifteen machines of all types comprising four British, 6 Dutch, 4 German and one Swiss alighted on the aerodrome on either their eastern or homeward flights. Amongst these was a Koyal Air Force machine with the Jlon'ble Sir Denys Bray, K.O.i.ii., I .b.l., C.B.E., Foreign Secretary, India, on board, who was ilymg irom BAGHDAD to India. &lt; The Royal Dutch Air Mail Company sent out five Fokker monoplanes from AMSTERDAM on experimental flights carrying mails to BAT A VIA. One of these made a return flight homewards. The Royal Air Force Flying Boat 'IRIS' with Major SIR PHILIP SASSOON, Bt., M.P., Under-Secretary of State for Air, called at HEN J AM'both on her outward and homeward flights from England to ITndia.

Cons'idate Guard and Escort. —Since the return to India in March 1926 of the detachment of the Indian Infantry posted at the Consulate, a Persian military guard consisting of one non-commissioned officer and from four_to six other ranks had been detailed every night to watch the buildings. In October all military and gendarmerie guards were withdrawn from Consulates in Persia, and His Britannic Majesty's Consulate at BANDAR ABBAS and the Consular Agency at LINGAH have remained without pro- jtection. The local authorities at both places have declined to replace the military guard by Town Police on the pretext that no instructions on the subject have been issued by the Tehran authorities. Cavalry Escort. —A scheme was sanctioned for the substitution of the Indian CaValry Escort of this Consulate that comprised a Daffadar and six Sowars by two Indian pensioners and two Persian Ghulams engaged locally. The Daffadar and Lance Daffadar and four other ranks at BANDAR ABBAS whose term of service had expired were returned to India, and at the end of the period under review there were one Indian Sowar and one Ghulam that had been recruited.27 Indo-European Telegraph Department. The office at BANDAR ABBAS worked siatisfactorily in spite of the strength of the staff having been reduced from three to two. The Indian Government Telegraph Steamer 'PATRICK STEWART' with Mr. E. E. GUNTER, O.B.E., Director of the Persian Gulf Section, on board, accompanied by Mr. G. E. O. DE SMIDT, Director-elect, and Mr. T. F. TEBETT arrived on the 7th April. The office was inspected by Mr. GUNTER. On the 28th April, the vessel Called again on her voyage to KARACHI, when Mr. DE SMIDT who had succeeded Mr. GUNTER as Director, visited the office. Three instances oi insulators being damaged by tribesmen on the BANDAR ABBAS section of the telegraph line going to KERMAN were brought to the notice of the local authorities. In one of these cases, com pensation for the damage done was recovered by them. Imperial Bank of Persia. Mr. V. H. GLENDENING remained in charge of the local branch of the bank throughout the year. The Imperial Bank continued its efforts in assisting the Persian Gov ernment to improve the currency of the country by the removal from circula tion of defective coin. It is estimated that a total of 315,000 debased Krans was collected during the period under review against 420,000 in 1927. Selling quotations of the bank for exchange on LONDON and BOMBAY were as follows:— London :— Highest Krans 50-25 per £. Lowest Krans 40-75 per £. Average Krans 48-29 per £. Bombay:— Highest Krans 370 per Rs. 100. Lowest Krans 348-50 per Rs. 100. Average Krans 360-34 per Rs, 100. The A nglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited. —At the latter part of the year, the Company despatched a party of six geologists under the leadership of Dr. HUGQ DE BOCKH, the eminent authority on oil, to make a survey of the country in the BANDAR ABBAS-LAR-JAHRUM-SHIRAZ area. It is intended to undertake further surveys in the cold weather of the two next ensuing years. Foreign interests. German. —Two German mining engineers on behalf pf the South Sea Phosphate Company visited BANDAR ABBAS in March for the purpose of mineral exploitation of the Persian Coast and islands in the vicinity. They inspected the possibilities of mineral exploitation at the islands of HORMUZ, LARAK and KISHIM and had a look at KHAMIR on the ima^land. Red Oxide of Iron on II or muz Island. The quantity of ore exported showed a marked decrease on the two preceding years.28 Only 3,500 tons were shipped to the United Kingdom and 50 tons to India. Trade and Commerce. Bandar A bhas. —Tijade on the whole may be said to have been dull, but there was some improvement, as is generally the case, during the cold Iweather. Foreign competition, particularly Russian, has been active and the reluctance on the part of merchants up-country to place fresh orders for goods until the situation became clearer at-times resulted in a considerable falling-oil' in the forwarding business, which is the chief occupation of local importers. The total volume of the trade for the year 1927-28 (Persian year 1306), the latest for which statistics are available, amounted to Krans 04,748 174 (£1,340,820) against Krans 69,944,089 (£1,439,070) during the preceding year. This district, it might be mentioned, comprises for Customs purposes the ports of BANDAR ABBAS, JASK, CHARBAR, TIAB (MINAB) and K1SHIM. There was a falling off in both imports and exports. The value of imports totalled Krans 47,095,910 (£975.272) of which merchandise worth Krans 42,302,147 (£876,000) or almost 90 per cent was introduced through the port of BANDAR ABBAS itself. The value of exports amounted to Krans 17,652,264 (£365.545) showing a drop of about ten per cent, on that for 1926-27. Hie principal commodities of the import trade affected were cotton piece-goods, yarn and soft and loaf sugar. The import trade from India was worth Krans 27,515,876 (£569,800) and consisted chiefly of cotton piece-goods and yarn. She held the'first place in these two lines in the local market, but will have to contend in future witli Russian competition, especially in cotton prints which are now finding great favour owing to their cheapness. The extent of India's purchases of Persian produce amounted to Krans 10,768,422 (£222,905) or about 60 per cent, of the total exports from rl^rsia. 1 he exports to India comprised chiefly raw cotton, carpets, pistachio nuts, dried fruits and dates. Ling ah. The trade of this port is fast declining. The total volume of trade ,^ c reased V 25 P er cent ' Her imports are shown as .vrans 5,697,452 (£117,985) and exports Krans, 1,726,266 (£35,750). r ^ e market for her purchases is India which furnishes about 8s 6 per centum of her requirements, viz., rice, flour, soft sugar, cotton goods, yarn, lace and embroidery.

No epidemic diseases occurred at the port during the year nor were any reported from the surrounding districts. Charitable Dispensary. —This* is housed at the Consular Agency. The attendance of out-door patients totalled 1,858 as against 1,838 in the preceding year. ! Weather. Bandar Abbas.—The rainfall was again below the average, and the heat in summer somewhat less intense than usual. There were three or four severe storms during the early part of the year and one in December. In one of the former, a great deal of damage Was done to harbour craft and to cargo discharged from lighters awaiting disembarkation on the Customs jetty. About half a dozen earth tremors of a few seconds' duration were re corded. Economic Conditions. Bandar Abbas.—-The crops in the MINAB and SHAMIL areas were practically destroyed by the ravages of locusts, which made several incur sions during the early part of the year. The Persian Governor despatched an agricultural expert to investigate the situation and to submit recommendations for measures required to be taken to combat the locust nuisance. G. A. RICHARDSON, His Majesty's Consul and Assistant to the Resident, Bandar Abbas. The 21st March 1929. CHAPTER V. Administration Report oi the Kerman Consulate for the year 1928. A .—British interests. 1. H. M.'s Consulate: Personnel. —Mr. J. H. Davies, O.B.E., I.C.S., held charge of H. M/s Consulate throughout the year. Khan Bahadur Allah Banda, M.B.E., Indian Attache handed over charge to Khan Bahadur Abdul Alim on the 29th September and proceeded on six months' leave preparatory to retirement. flit 31 2. Consulate work. —The total number of cases settled in the Governor- General's Court in coniunciion with the ConsnMte m which the interests of Foreign subjects under the Consulate protection were concerned was IS and the compensation recovered amounted to Krans 38,791. 12 cases were pend ing in the Governor-General's Court at the end of the year. On the abolition of the Capitulations with effect from the 10th May the Persian Government allowed a period of one year for the completion of cases then unfinished in the Governor-General's Court and also for the completion of all unfinished cases in Consular Courts. Every possible endeavour is being made to finish the present pending cases before the 9th May 1929. Since the abolition of Capitulations British and British protected parties have referred all new cases to the Adliyeh. Fifty-eight British subjects were registered during the year. 3. Indo-European Telegraph Department. —Mr. P. E. Dormer remain ed in charge of the Kerman Office throughout the year. Mr. C. E. Treadwell held charge of the Kerman Sub-Division through out the year. Mr. J. P. May remained in charge of the Dehaneh-Baghi Sub-Division throughout the year. The total duration of interruptions in this section was 36 hours. There were no total interruptions to traffic in the Kerman Sub-Division during the year. The branch line from Baft to Saidabad (Sirjan) was in terrupted for 139 hours in December owing to cyclones having caused 190 of the wooden poles to fall. This line is uninsulated and is simply for the use of the Persian Telegraph Administration but the Indo-European Telegraph Department have a mounted ghulam always stationed at Sir j an to keep the line in repair. The wilful breaking of insulators on this section also in creased considerably during the year under review. There were 32 insula tors broken in the Anar-Bam Section and 109 in the Iverman-Bandar Abbas Section against 7 and 2 respectively for the previous year. Mr. G. E. New, Director, Persian Section, arrived from Tehran early in April on a tour of inspection and returned to headquarters after a stay of two days. 4. Imperial Bank of Persia. —Mr. C. A. Gardner remained as Mana ger of the Kerman Branch throughout the year. Mr. P. L. Rhodes, acting Accountant, left Kerman on resignation on the 9th August and his place was not filled until the arrival of Mr. H. J. Douglas on the 24th October. 5. Church Missionary Society and its work. —(a) Education. —The Rev. A. C. Ozanne, Principal of the Boys' School left for England early in the year and his place was taken temporarily by Mr. C. L. Hawker of the Stuart Memorial College, Ispahan, who transferred the School to the new buildings. In September the Rev. R. Iliff was appointed Principal reliev ing Mr. Hawker who returned to Ispahan. The number of boys rose from 40 last year to 60 at the end of the year under review and the formal recog nition of the School by the Persian 'Ministry of Education, which brings with it all privileges enjoyed by Persian Government Schools, will, the new Principal hopes, result m further increase in the number of students. Under its new Principal who is young and enthusiastic the school has re gained much of the reputation it lost under Mr. Ozanne and it is doing good work. It has the best building and play grounds of any school in Kerman. Miss E. Macdonogh remained in charge of the Girls' School till the be ginning of December when she left for Ispahan on transfer, handing the charge over to M^iss J. F. Woodroffe who remained in charge till the closfj of the year. Miss Gerard, the only European assistant, left for Shiraz to open a school there in February. The Girls School continues to do excellent work and the number of pupils is 144 (the same as last year) including 1532 boys below the age of 8. The School is now recognized by the Persian Gov ernment and the pupils will in future sit for the Government examination as well as for the C. M. S. examination. Some of the young Persian teachers have in consequence given up teaching in order to work for the Vllth Class certificate, and the School is therefore short-handed on the Persian side of the staff. The company of Girl Guides under Miss Eardley is doino- solendid work and the C. M. S. hope very soon to enrol them cfficially. 0 (h) Medical. Dr. G. E. Dodson remained in charge of the Men's Hos pital till the middle of October when he proceeded to England on fur lough Dr. Mary Price remained in charge of the Women's Hosoital throughout the year, and also supervised the Men's hospital during the in Ti £ M e , ttede^vtnve oiDr. Dodson and the arrival of his successor Ur.

S. Dorabjee and Co. (a British Indian firm) and six Shikarpuri Hindu firms traded in general British mer chandise. The whole question of trade will be dealt with in detail in the Annual Trade Keport. Here it is perhaps suffilcient to note that the Russians have secured most of the piece-goods market and have upset the Sugar market. Money has been tight and trade, generally, dull. 7. Political Interests of the Consulate. —The chief event of the year was the abolition of the Capitulations with effect from the 10th May. It aroused considerable public interest, though there were few demonstra tions. At Bam the School-Master, Mudarris Zada, closed his school, read out a telegram he had received from Ruhi, the Deputy for Jiruft, in the bazaar, and gave an entertainment in the evening. A few shops were also illuminated. In Kerman the Parsee caravanserai and a few shops were illuminated and a small procession, which included school children, marched from the Juma Mosque to the Shah's Statue in the Khiyaban-i-(avenue) Sipah, where Hashimi, of the Adlieh department, made a speech. The chief participators in this demonstration were Sheikh Abul Kassim, Harandi, the Russian Oil Agent, and his Harandi friends. In accordance with a notice issued by the I. E. T. D. all inland tele grams have, since May 10th, been sent to the Persian telegraph olffice, in stead of to the I. E. T. D. office, for despatch. The value of the Adlieh Courts for the protection of the interests of British and British Indian traders is dealt with in Section 9, Justice, below. So far no cases, criminal or civil, have been filed in the Persian Courts against British subjects. In the month of October the Governor-General received instructions to settle all foreign pending claims in his Court before Nauruz (21st March 1929) so as to allow time for the disposal of any appeals preferred. He has however not yet received the official instructions for the special pro tection of foreigners which the Persian Government promised to issue last May. 8. Communications and Security. —During the year under review the Kerman-Duzdab road has been practically free from disturbance, but the Bander Abbas-Kerman road was infested with Bashakirdi robbers at inter vals during the first 9 months of the year. In all 10 important robberies were committed by the Bashakirdis. Much credit is due to the Amnieh guards for recovering the goods or animals stolen in almost all the cases. On five occasions they had fights with the robbers and in one instance they were able to release 27 men of Godar-i-Shorun whom the robbers were car rying away captive. This was not the only case in which the Bashakirdis carried off prisoners and confirmation has been received from other sources that their captives were being sold as slaves. The post between Bandar Abbas and Kerman was twice carried off by robbers. In one instance the Amnieh were able to recover the mails and the carrier; in the other case the robbers decamped with the parcel post. There were no disturbances on the Bandar Abbas-Kerman road after October. It is hoped that the Bashakirdis will be finally reduced to order after Baluchistan has been settled. In the month of July a carpet caravan was attacked on the Bandar Abbas-Kerman road 12 farsakhs the other side of Sirjan by a band of the Daragahi tribe. During the same month a caravan was looted between Sir j an and Rafsinjan. This year a credit of 70,000 Tomans was received for the long promis ed Bandar Abbas-Kerman road and a certain amount of work 'has been done. The formidable Tang-i-Zagh was not tackled in earnest till Novem ber and the estimate of the Engineer-in-Charge that the road will be open 71 F&amp;PDu for traiffiic in the spring should perhaps be regarded as optimistic. At the time of writing there were only about 300 labourers working on construc tion. Business people have great hopes that the opening of this road will bring prosperity to Kerman trade, particularly as it is said that a number of traders in Ispahan and the North are dissatisfied with Russian busi ness methods and intend to divert their business to the Bandar Abbas route. Posts. —During March something was seriously wrong with the Post Office in Duzdap as letters and newspapers arrived several weeks late and in certain instances were lost altogether. Otherwise the Duzdap postal arrangements continued to be satisfactory mails arriving regularly on the 5th day except for occasional delay owing to the severity of the wea ther in winter. The bi-weekly motor mail service between Ispahan and Kerman, started in July 1927, functioned satisfactorily and mails continue to arrive from Tehran in 6 or 7 days. In February the Persian Government sanctioned the opening of the following new Post and Telegraph Olffiices :— Post and Telegraphs , . . Dusari, the chief town in Jiruft, P, st . ^ . . . Eewar, Rabur^ Khabis and Fahrej neir Bampur. Till the end of the year however no funds had been provided for the purpose. A Junker's aeroplane arrived in Kerman from Tehran on the 14th Sep tember and returned on the 20th idem. The object of the visit was said to be to enable an opinion to be formed regarding the possibilities of arranging an aeroplane postal service between Kerman and Ispahan. No thing more has been heard of the proposal. Wireless. —The wireless installation in Kerman was completed by the Russian mechanic in the beginning of May and a four hours trial demon stration of receiving and sending was given. It is however out of order at present as some fuse has been burnt out for which they have had to write to Europe. The men here cannot work it properly. B.—Local Government and Politics. 9. L]ocal Officials.—Governor-General. —His Excellency Mirza Mah- mud Khan, Jam, who had been in office since September 1927 left for Tehran on February 28th to discuss with the Government the financial sup port that would be forthcoming in the next year's budget for the various elementary and pressing needs of this long neglected province. Before leaving he stated that if Government did not give his proposals reasonable support he would not return to Kerman, but would seek employment else where. The Government's attitude was not very helpful and, either on this account, or because it so happened that at that moment a new Gover nor-General was required at Meshed, His Excellency was appointed Gover nor-General, Khurasan. Though not perhaps very forceful he had gained the affections of all classes, during the few months he was here, by his kindly manner and wholehearted interest in the welfare of the province, and his transfer to Meshed was a real loss to Kerman. His attitude to wards this Consulate was very friendly. Rustam Khan, Isfandiari, (Rafat-ud-Dauleh) the Assistant Governor- General, acted as Governor-General till the arrival of Mirza Mehdi Khan, Naseer, (Haji Naseer-es-Saltaneh) on May 5th. Haji Naseer -es -Saltaneh lacks the straightforwardness and honesty of character of his predecessor. He came here with the reputation of belonging to the Socialist party and he certainly assisted them during the elections. He also had Atabaki re moved from the oiffilce of Rais-i-Baladiyeh and put in his place Agha Mehdi, the leader of the Socialist party who has held this office at various times since 1910. Otherwise His Excellency has not used his influence inthe struggles between the local political parties and he has throughout re mained on friendly terms with this Consulate. He has suffered a good deal, particularly during the first few months, from kidney trouble and though ready to take up any matter brought personally to his notice has left most of the Consulate work to his assistant, Rust am Khan Isfandiari. On September 20th he went to Tehran by aeroplane to discuss the pro jected expedition to Baluchistan with His Majesty. He returned to Ker- man on October 6th. His Excellency made considerable sums out of the Elections to the Medjliss and there is every reason to believe that he got his share of the money paid for the exemption of men called up for the Nizam-i-Wazifeh. Finance Department. —Mr. P. J. Fitzsimmons, Provincial Director of Finance, Kerman, handed over acting charge to his assistant Mirza Hassan Khan, Nasir, on the 17th March and after waiting for 3 weeks for the pay ment of his dues, which were held up by formalities at headquarters, left for the United States via Duzdap on the 8th April. Mr. Fitzsimmon's uprightness of character and amiable qualities were unanimously recognized but he left no permanent mark on the administra tion. The dishonesty of the subordinate officials was only driven under ground not eradicated. Within four months his successor, Mirza Hassan Khan, Nasir, was recalled owing to a scandalous case of corruption in the Tahdid section. The chief culprit was Seyid Yahya Khan, Shahlavi, Rais- i-Ayadat (head of the receipt office) who was also recalled. Nasir, though quite honest and of a pleasant and attractive personality, was too weak to suppress the dishonesty of his subordinates of which he received many warnings. He was relieved in July by Mirza Mohammed Khan, Nasiri, who remained in charge till the end of the year. The latter is personally a pleasant man and his attitude towards this Consulate has been satisfactory. Opium. —In July, in accordance with the recently passed Opium Mono poly Law, the bandrol tax on opium was increased from Krans 1*05 to Krans 2-50 per misqal. Orders were also received that a tax of Krans 80 per Man (lbs. 6-50) on exported opium was to be levied in the province of production in addition to the Customs duty at the port. On October 13th Tabibzadeh arrived from Tehran as Rais-i-Inhissar-i-Taryaak (Opium Monopoly) but he was recalled at the close of the year, and this new depart ment was again merged in the Malieh department. The above mentioned increase in the tax may in a few cases have in duced opium addicts to give up entirely or to restrict their use of opium but its general effect has been to increase the poverty of the thousands of addicts, mostly of the lowest class, who are unable to do without the drug. The only class that benefitted were the retailers of contraband opium. That Government has not benefitted is evident from the statement of a senior member of the Malieh Department that from the day when the Opium Mono poly was brought into force in Kerman till the end of the year not a single misqal of opium had been bought from the Government ambar. It is un derstood that the object of the Government in passing the existing law was to restrict local consumption without loss of revenue and without affecting export, and that they now realise that the law has been a failure and intend to review their whole opium policy. Survey. —The Commissions are still working and it is anticipated that it will take 2 years to finish the reassessment. Police. —In February Naib-Sarhang Mirza Ibrahim Khan 'Sharif,' the Chief of Nazmieh, Kerman, who was in Tehran at the end of last year trying to secure a transfer, was posted to Kermanshah and Naib Assadullah Khan continued to dffiiciate till relieved by Yawar Sayyed Nasir Khan, from Tehran, on the 10th April. This olffilcer was quite unfit for the post, being old, incompetent and a victim of diabetes. On August 30th he was re called to Tehran, presumably owing to the disgraceful state of his depart ment. Corruption was rapidly beginning to exceed all limits, the Yawar36 himself being one of the worst offenders. Burglaries were on the increase, women were insulted in the streets in broad daylight, an offiicial of the de partment was involved in an unsavoury affray connected with a prostitute; in some cases accused persons whilst under enquiry had escaped from Police custody. On the 9th September Yawar Mustafa Khan, Alburz (formerly chief of Nazmieh in Khuzistan) arrived from Tehran and relieved Yawar Sayyed Nasir Khan. Alburz is young and energetic and has a strong sense of discipline. During the short time he has been here he has effected great improvements in the discipline and organization of the Police Force. He is on quite good terms with the Consulate but he appears to be an invete rate intriguer with a keen eye to a bribe. Justice. —The reorganized Adlieh Courts were opened on the 4th Janu ary, and Mirza Abdul Rahim Khan, Rahanama, the former Rais-i-Adlieh, left for Tehran on the 22nd January. He was succeeded by Seyyid Abdul Azim, Shahidi, an Akhund who, though formally friendly, takes no part in local social life. Throughout the year the Istinaff (Appeal) Court has been without a Public Prosecutor (except for a period of 3 weeks in November) and one of its 'Uzvs' (Judges). It has not therefore been possible to try any Janayat (grave criminal) cases and some accused persons have now been in custody over two years awaiting trial. At the beginning of the Persian Year (21st March) the Sulhieh (Civil) Courts in the various districts of Kerman were abolished. They were how ever gradually re-opened later and there are now Sulhieh Courts in exis tence at Bam, Sirjan and Rafsinjan. In October the powers of the Sulhieh Court were raised from 400 to 500 Tumans. Most of the claims of the British Indian traders fall within this new limit and they complain of the inordinate delay in the settlement of their cases as well as biased judgments. Experience has shown that the effect of the compulsory Arbitration Law is to impede rather than facilitate justice. Almost all claims brought by Hindus or Carpet Firms are based on documents or written contracts and the default of the defendants especially in carpet cases, where hun dreds of similar contracts have been duly carried out by others, is merely always due to dishonesty or laziness. Such cases are not, properly speak ing, cases in which arbitration is required at all. Yet under the Law the defendant can insist on arbitration and two out of the three arbitrators must be Persians. The Persian conception of arbitration is, not to decide what is just, but to effect a compromise by extending the most ludicrous leniency to the defendant, and brow-beating the plaintiff into accepting an insignificant portion of his just dues under threat of getting nothing. A few months experience of this law has therefore convinced* British sub jects that it is better to cut their losses than to resort to the Adlieh Courts.

Democrat. Socialist. In Tehran. DereiTTiV) pt tli6 Governor-General, througli the Baladiyeli authorities, besran to construct a new Khayaban (avenue) 20 Zars wide, through the town from east to west, for which a credit of 25,000 Tunians has b66n promised next year. About 100 houses will have to be destroyed and work is already well advanced. Very little compensation has so far been paid for the houses destroyed. 10 Elections . —The Governor-General published the 'Han (notice) with regard to elections to the 7th Medjliss in April and on the 16th May thirty- persons of whom some 25 were Socialists were invited to Government House to elect the Anjuman-i-Nuzzar. Of the nine members elected to this Anjuman 8 were Socialists. The elections, which were, throughout, rigged from Tehran, dragged on from 16th May to August 22nd whilst a struggle was fought out in Tehran between Kazimi, who had secured the support of Taimurtache the Minister of Court, before the latter went to Europe in May, and Dargahi, who secured the support of Nusrat-ud-Dauleh, an enemy of Kazimi, who acted as Minister of Court during Taimurtache's absence. The following were eventually elected as deputies:— Kerman . . Dargahi ..... Socialist. Muyid-ul-Islam Rafsinjan . . Nusret-ul-Mamalik . Sirjan . . . Mirat-ns-Saltaneh Jiruft . . . Atta-ul-Mulk, Ruhi . Bam . . . Dr. Malikzadeh Parsis . . Arbab Kaikhusrau Shahrukh Candidates are not formerly proposed to the electors and no political meeting are held at which candidates explain their programme. One voter in a certain constituency informed me that he had, in perfect good faith, voted for a candidate who was standing in another constituency. The voting is simply managed by Government through certain local officials and much resentment was expressed by the political minded at the whole elections, which were a scandal throughout. 11. Local Politics. —The three local parties in Kerman are called, Democrats, Social Democrats and Socialists. These names however signify nothing as scarcely any one has the slightest idea of their meaning and no party has any clear cut programme or policy. This is probably due to the fact that centuries of autocratic rule and corrupt Government have atrophied whatever political instinct the people possessed, and the close control kept by the present Shah over the activities of politicians inside or outside the Medjliss effectively stifles the growth of liberal ideas amongst the people. The activities of the political parties in Kerman are almost entirely confined to imtrigues to secure the appointment of individuals of the party to various Government offices and, more particularly, to a seat in the Medjliss (election to the Medjliss being virtually a Government mono poly). With rare exceptions therefore self interest is the only political object, and corruption and intrigue the only political method the people know. It is for this reason perhaps that even our friends can scarcely be induced to believe that the British diplomatic officials no longer interfere in the details of Persian domestic affairs. They know that we did in the past, and they find it difficult to believe that this method-has been abandoned when it could still so easily be used to obtain temporary political advantage. Nevertheless the policy of holding aloof from such interference appears to be bearing fruit. From several quarters, other than those traditionally friendly with this Consulate, I have been informed that what Persia needs to-day is real sympathy and understanding between the f copies of England and Persia. Though it may be difficult to visualise how this could be brought about, it does indicate that there is a growing feeling in Persia that friendship with England is desirable and possible, and that it is no longer necessary either to struggle against the influence of the British power, or to submit to it with resentment tempered by personal advantage.39 The influence of the Mullahs, which has never been very strong in Kerman, appears to be diminishing. All except a few of the Akhunds have adopted the new Pehlevi hat, the campaign on behalf of which met with but little opposition. Only one instance of an attempt to work upon the fanaticism of the masses occurred ?n 1928 when in the beginning of February two Seyyids of Rafsinjan instigated an attack on the Bahais there, the pretext being that Bahai women should not be allowed to use the ordinary women's bath. A military detachment was despatched by cars to Rafsinjan to overawe the inhabitants and order was restored. In this connection it may be of interest to mention that Mirza Munir, a Bahai preacher, has now been in Kerman for the last two months and has gained a number of converts, mostly among the Zardushties. Both men and women of this sect now attend their place of worship without any hinder- ance. The Press. —The only local paper published with any pretence of regularity is the ff Istiqamat edited by Rais-ul-Mutakalimin, a Tabrizi, who professes to be friendly and has never written anything definitely anti-British. In the month of July, in consequence of a newspaper article casting reflections upon him, the Governor-General obtained permission from Tehran to censor all local newspapers before publication. A moderate, liberal paper which was begun only three months before closed down as a protest- * 12. Health and General Welfare. —The general health has been fair, though small-pox appeared in epidemic form in Kerman during the latter half of the year resulting in a number of deaths among children. The standard oflivi-ng of the masses continues to be diplorably low and extreme poverty and under-nourishment are noticeable in the town. Dr. Hassan Khan, Zamani, held the post of Rais-i-Sahiyyeh through out the year. He has no funds with which to effect any improvement in the very insanitary condition of the town. 13. Russian Activities. —M. Laktionoff, the permanent Soviet Consul, returned to Kerman from leave on the 28th March and took over charge from M. Ananikov, the Vice-Consul. On the 19th April the Russian Doctor and his wife (who also was a Doctor) on receipt of telegraphic orders proceeded to Tehran. 1 On the 13th November three members of the Soviet Trade Organiza tion arrived in Kerman to replace the Consul and on the 14th M. Laktion- off handed over the building he had been occupying to them, and lett tor Tehran accompanied by his staff. The Vice-Consul had already left for Shiraz, and the Soviet Consulate in Kerman was thus closed down. Two members of the Trade Organization after visiting Bam and Sirian returned to Ispahan in December. The one who remains here has given out that he has powers to work independently oi leiiran. Apart from spreading anti -British rumours, and an attempt to secure some influence in the so-called Socialist party, which no doubt met with some success, particularly at the time of elections, there has been nothing noteworthy in the political activities of the Soviet Consu . -, n ., , The Russian Consul -General at Ispahan visited Kerman from 19th to 24th December and it is said that he will m future remain m charge of Russian political interests at Yezd and Kerman. The commercial activities of the Soviet Consul till his departure which showed a marked increase throughout the year, have been dealt with in a separate report. It is learned on good authority that the Russians shortly intend to appoint a Trade Agent at Bam. 14 Military A if airs. —Sarhang Ali Shah Khan Rahimi, the Officer Commanding, Kerman, was promoted to ^® to ^'^^Teep 2 ' 410 Sartip 6 Jd^Shah proceeded to Tehran on 20 days' leave40 in the end of August, to obtain orders with regard to the proposed expedi tion against Dost Mohammed Khan of Bampur. He returned on the 6th September and on the 25th proceeded to Bam leaving his brother, Sultan Mahmood Khan, Rahimi, as Commandant of the Central Garrison in Kerman, which post he held to the end of the year. Sartip Ali Shah Khan is a strict disciplinarian who represses corrup tion amongst his officers and sees that his men are properly paid and fed. He has however been given a deserted village named Aliabad in Rudbar for conniving at the crimes of Saeed Khan, son-in-law of Zargham-es- Saltaneh. ^ The Kerman force at present consists of 1,448 rank and file, which includes 47 officers. This number excludes the new recruits from the Nizam-i-Wazifeh (see below). The force at Kerman is called Teep-i- Mustaqil and has Gurdans at Bam and Bandar Abbas called the ' Gurdan- i-Garmsirat ' and the ' Gurdan-i-Banadir '. Bandar Abbas, which was formerly under Shiraz, has, since the reorganization, been placed under Kerman. &lt; In January Karim Khan of Pusht-i-Gudar robbed a merchant of property worth 5,000 Tumans. He was arrested by the Commandant Bam detachment and released in June after giving an undertaking to pay com pensation. His relatives, however, a few days later, stole a number of camels and Karim Khan was re-arrested. On the 7th July he escaped from Military custody with a Baluch recruit who was in charge of him. They took away with them 2 horses, 2 rifles and 2 Mauser pistols. The pursued party failed to catch them and Yawar Nusretullah Mirza, the Com mandant Bam detachment, was placed under arrest and sent to Tehran. Naib-Sarhang Seyyid Shakar Khan, Rais-i-Nizam-i-Wazifeh (Cons cription), arrived Kerman on the 20th August. On the 7th October a Committee of 15 persons (5 officials, 5 Military officers and 5 notables) was formed with the Governor-General as Presidont to deal with the recruit ment. This Committee commenced work on the 6th November and although over 2,000 were called up from Kerman town only some 200 recruits were obtained. There was some agitation at the beginning but it was soon found that hard cash was more effective. There are good grounds for believing that much money passed to the Committee of whom all, from the, Governor-General downwards, except Naib Sarhang Seyyid Shakar Khan, received their share. In the result everyone is pleased; the public because so few wage-earners have been taken and the officials because conscription has passed off in Kerman without the riots that have occurred in other towns. 15. Persian Baluchistan, Jiruft and Rudhar. —In May Amanullah Mirza, Amir-i-Lashkar, Sharq, visited Kerman to discuss with the Officer Commanding plans for a concerted attack on Dost Mohammed Khan of Bampur. In July the Military authorities began storing the Government grain and fodder at Bam, Narmashir and Jiruft. The bulk of the Kerman troops were concentrated in Bam at the beginning of September and on the 25th Sartip Ali Shah Khan, Officer Commanding Kerman Teep, joined them there. On the 12th September the Governor-General, Kerman, issued a procla mation depriving Dost Mohammed Khan of the Governorship of Baluch istan. i In October the Kerman force moved to Rahmatabad (Rigan) 30 miles S. W. of Bam and some 150 miles from Bampur. Further advance was however postponed till the Khwash force had advanced as far as Magas. The Kerman force then advanced and occupied Bampur without opposition on 23rd November whilst the Khwash force occupied Fahraj. Dost Moham med fled without offering resistence; it is believed because of the fear inspired by the aeroplanes operating with the Khwash column. At the end of the year Dost Mohammed was in a fortified position at Sarbaz, South,41 of Bampur, and alternate negotiations and desultory fighting was proceed ing between him and Amir-i-Lashkar Amanullah Mirza. Sarhano- Monammed Ivhan was appointed Governor of Bampur. The Governor-General Kerman seems so far to have been left in any intention the Government may have regarding the future of Persian Baluchistan. Thanks largely to the location of a Military force in the neighbourhood Jiruft and Rudbar remained undisturbed throughout the year. 0 Zargham- es-Sulteneh still exercises a semi-independent rule in Rudbar. He at first evaded tne demano of the IVIilitary authorities for the supply of an irregular detachment to assist in the operations against Dost Mohammed but even- , tually complied when he found that the day had turned in favour of the Persian forces. „ , J. H. DA VIES, I.C.S., His Majesty's Consul, Kerman. British Consulate, Kerman, The 20th January 1929. CHAPTER VI. v?- - Administration Report of the Mekran Coast for the year 1928. Personnel. Mr. E. E. Gunter, O.B.E., was in political charge of the Mekran Coast up to 14th April on which date on relief by Mr. G. E. O. de Smidt, D.S.O., he proceeded to Europe via Iraq and Syria on leave pre paratory to retirement. Gun-running . 160 Magazine and 64 other rifles and 26,500 rounds of ammunition were reported to have been landed on the Mekran Coast during the }ear under review. Of these, 64 rifles and 2,700 rounds of ammunition were landed by an Arab in May for Mir Dost Mohammed of Bampur. While proceeding to Bampur with this consignment, he was attacked under the orders of Mir Din Mohamed of Dashtyari by Mir Dilawar Khan who captured 48 rifles and 2,700 rounds allowing only 16 rifles to -be taken to Dost Mohamed at Sarbaz. Mir Din Mohamed is said to have handed over the remainder of the capture to the Persian Government. Persian Baluchistan. —The chief events of the year were as follows : — Khalifah Khair Mohamed, an Afghan settler in the Persian Baluchis tan, who was responsible for the destruction of the telegraph lines between Jask and Charbar and who instigated a raid on the latter station during the Great War, died at Mogan Shabu towards the middle of December 1927. At the end of May 1928 Mir Din Mohamed of Dashtyari was formally appointed as Governor of Charbar and presented with a Persian flag before a large gathering of the merchants aind others at Charbar. The Persian military detachment attended and the flag was flown over Din Mohamed's house with full ceremonials. The Director of Persian Southern Post Offices in a speech said that a Governor had now been appointed where there was none before and that the Persian flag represented justice and equity. The post of the Governor 4 of Charbar and surrounding district carried a pay of 200 Toma?ns a month. This action by the Persian Government was obviously taken in order to detach Din Mohamed during the impending operations against his brother-in-law Dost Mohamed of Bampur. At the beginning of April 1928 Dost Mohamed Khan of Bampur made a tour of the Southern Baluchistan and in some cases was reported to have constructed small forts to be garrisoned by his followers. He summoned all the local chiefs to meet him at Kasserkand in order to obtain from them 71F&amp;PD42 a promise to pay him a part of the revenues of their districts. He also addressed a letter to the Director of the Persian Gulf Section, Indo- European Telegraph Department at Karachi to the effect that if all the telegraph subsidies were paid to him, he would undertake the protection of the telegraph lines passing through the Persian Mekran. A non committal reply was made after consulting the Political Resident to the effect that the matter had been referred to the authorities. At this period it was known throughout Baluchistan that the Persians were concentrating troops for an advance on Bampur from the direction of Bam and Duzdap. The meeting with Dost Mohamed at Kasserkand took place in the latter part of April and was attended by D?n Mohamed of Dashtyari who refused to surrender any part of his revenues. The meeting broke up on reports being received of military activities by the Persians to the North of Bampur. Dost Mohamed immediately left for Bampur with threat of armed action against Din Mohamed. In August Dost Mohamed was given an ultimatum by the Persian Military Commander Sarhang Mohamed Khan who had occupied Karwandar, the principal terms of which were; disarmament of the entire population of Persian Baluchistan and the maintenance of a Persian force at Bampur. As Dost Mohamed did not agree to these terms hostilities commenced in October. During the operations that ensued Dost Mohamed was defeated and Bampur and the adjacent districts were occupied by the Persians. Dost Mohamed fled to Sarbaz with his family and remnants of his forces and soon after the conclusion of the year he was granted an amnesty by the Shah and permitted to remain chief of Sarbaz with the revenues of Sarbaz and a part of Dizak and Sarawan districts. It may be noted that this has placed Dost Mohamed right on the British border but with considerably reduced power and influence. The Persian operations in Baluchistan combined with the earlier action against the Sheikh of Henjam have had a remarkable effect in improving Persian prestige in the Mekran and the effectiveness of the Persian writ. None of the subsidised chiefs of the Mekran gave any assistance to Dost Mohamed and affairs in the Mekran have been unusually quiet. As a result the Telegraph lines have been comparatively free from interruptions due to wilful damage. Claims. —None of the old claims brought by British Indian Subjects against the people and chiefs of the Persian Baluchistan were settled during the year. These claims have been brought to the notice of the Persian Government by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf from time to time. Foreign subjects.—No subject of a foreign European power resided at any port on the Mekran Coast during the year. • Albert Gesseler one of three German globe-trotters (of whom one was supposed to have died en route and the second gave up the attempt at Bandar Abbas) was landed at Charbar by the Commander of a mail boat in May. Refused a transit visa for India, he attempted to return to Bandar Abbas on foot but came back to Charbar after a few days' trudge. He left for Bandar Abbas by a mail steamer. While at Charbar he was accommodated by the Persians. Telegraph lines. —The telegraph lines between Jask and Charbar were interrupted during the year by wilful damage as follows January February October N ovember Total . 135 hours. 97 hours. H „ 5 „ 22 In the Karwan district alone the interruptions totalled 86 hours. The responsible chiefs (Mirs Ayub Khan and Nagdi Khan) were warned.43 Subsidies.— TY iq following chiefs were in receipt of telegraph subsidies during the year ; — » Annual telegraph subsidy.

A slave from Persian Baluchistan sought refuge in the office of the British Agent, Gwadur, during the year under report. He left for Karachi at his own expense. Wrecks. —In November dhow ' Ganjam Padarat ' from Cutch with a cargo of 2,000 bags of dried dates loaded at Al-Qatif arrived at Jask in a water-logged condition. The Officer Commanding Persian Troops ille gally disposed of some of the contents but a considerable quantity was recovered later by the Officer-in-Charge Jask telegraph sub-division. I he latter was instructed by the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to whom the matter was referred, to sell the dhow and cargo and to utilise,the proceeds thereof to meet the repatriation expenses, etc., of the crew who left for India by the steamer calling at Jask on the 7th Decembei. Visits. —Sir Auriel Stein, K.C.I.E., of the Indian Archaeological Department visited Gwadur and the neighbourhood in the month of January and left for Mekran. A bolition of the Capitulations. —Since the abolition of the Capitulations in Persia, the position of the British Indian traders and subjects on the Persian Mekran Coast has become very difficult. The only court available is that of Sirdar Din Mohamed, Governor of Charbar, which is not properly constituted. Din Mohamed himself is implicated in many of the cases and owes considerable sums of money to the British Indian merchants who fear reprisals if they apply to the court at Bandar Abbas. Moreover the treat ment of British Indian Subjects by Persian officials has undergone a marked change for the worse. A respectable British Indian merchant the head oi the local Punchayet was assaulted by a Customs Munshi, and an attempt was made to coerce and imprison one Peeral for alleged smuggling wit oj.it any proper enquiry. There is a general feeling that British iniluence ib dwindling and as a result great difficulty is being experienced m getting both Persians and Baluchis to honour their bonds and in other ways to come to terms with our subjects to whom they owe money.M The two cases mentioned above were represented to Tehran. Tour. —The Director left Karachi for a tour of inspection on the 3rd April and after visiting all telegraph and wireless stations in the Persian Gulf returned to headquarters on 4th May. He interviewed Mir Din Mohamed at Charbar and Mirs Mustafa Khan and Hoti at Jask. Mr. A. W. Halkett relieved Mr. H. A. D. Thomson on the 20th March as Officer-in-Charge of the Jask telegraph sub-division. His report on the condition of the country between Jask and Gwadur is attached. J ask. Mr. W. C. Janes was Superintendent in charge of the telegraph station up to 19th March when he was relieved by Mr. H. A. D. Thomson, Ihe latter was relieved in turn by Mr. W. C. Janes on 1st December. Persian officials. —No Deputy Governor has yet been appointed here. But the duties have been performed both by the Officer Commanding the Persian troops and the Mudir of Customs, which has caused a good deal of friction between them. Mirza Dahim was Mudiri of Customs up to 3rd October when he was relieved by Mirza Adamy. Mirza Dahim left Jask on 4th October to take up his duties as Secretary to the Provincial Director of Customs at Bandar Abbas. There is also a Persian Quarantine Medical Officer here. Persian garrison. —One non-commissioned officer and 25 infantry-men under one Naib Mohamed Khan form the total garrison at this place. Taxes. Members of the Indo-European telegraph staff do not pay customs duty as provided in the Jask agreement. Road tax however has been paid. The Persian Government during the year claimed customs duties from the telegraph staff but on the matter being represented, it was agreed to allow goods to be imported free of duty into the country pending final settlement of the case. A note of the goods imported by the members of the Telegraph Department is being kept by the Mudir of Customs. British Navy. —H. M. S. ' Cyclamen ' and ' Crocus ' visited the port during the year. Aviation. —A considerable number of aeroplanes landed at Jask during the year. The movements of aeroplanes in the Gulf are being telegraphi cally reported to Karachi free of charge by the Indo-European Telegraph Department. In the event of forced landings every assistance is being afforded and such measures as are possible are taken to ensure that planes are not molested. As a rule the subsidised chiefs are requested to supply guards. The Persian officials at Jask have put every kind of obstacle in the way of aeroplanes alighting there. This was most marked m the case of the ' Iris ' which made a forced landing at Jask on the 24th October, the Under Secretary of State for Air, Sir Philip Sassoon and the Secretary of the Foreign and Political Department, India, Sir Denys Bray being passengers. C harbar. Mr. G. A. Tomlinson was relieved by Mr. M. S. de Souza on 1st March. The latter remained in charge of the telegraph station throughout the year except for a few days. In May Mir Din Mohamed of Dashtyari was appointed as Governor of Charbar. Persian Customs. —Mirza Essa was the Mudir of Customs during the year under report. His treatment of the British Indian traders left much to be desired. For instance a Munshi of the Customs, under his instruc tions, assaulted the head of Charbar Punchayet whilst getting into a boat to go aboard a mail steamer on business. The case was reported to H. B. M.'s Minister at Tehran through the Hon'ble the Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf.The Persian Government removed the embargo on import of rupees at Charbar in July. This embargo had seriously affected trade. Wall. —Shahdad Abbas, a British Indian subject, continued to be Mir Din Mohamed's Wali during the year. Persian garrison. —The strength of the garrison was two officers (including a Medical Officer), one non-commissioned officer and 88 men with one field gun and one machine gun. The garrison was under the command of Sultan Akbar Ali Khan who relieved Naib Mirza Ali Khan in May. The latter was a strict efficient officer and held in great esteem by villagers and British Indian subjects. He had inspired great confidence by severely punishing any Persian soldier molesting the inhabitants. Since the arrival of the present Officer Commanding a laxity in discipline has been noticed, which is reflected in several cases of assault by Persian soldiers. In one instance a serious assault was made on one of the Indo-European Telegraph Department linemen. Complaints against the troops have been jignored by the Commandant. The troops have been put through an intensive course of physical drill and parades. They are accommodated in barracks of sun dried bricks recently built to the East of the telegraph premises at a distance of 800 yards. Aviation. —A considerable number of aeroplanes landed' at Charbar during the year. Diseases. —There was a mild outbreak of small pox in Charbar between 19th and 26th January. Two persons died in the village. A Persian Medical Officer was sent from Tehran to inoculate all villagers but none consented. As he could not prevail upon Mir Din Mohamed to compel them, he was recalled. Subsequently a Quarantine Medical Officer was sent to Charbar. I Owing to the prevalence of cholera in India mail steamers were not allowed to touch at any Persian ports below Bushire on the up trip. | f Gwadur. Mr. Lai Khan the former British Agent died on 28th October by hang ing himself with a rope while in a state of temporary insanity. His duties were temporarily performed by Mr. Abdur Rahim, a former Agent in retirement at Gwadur- He was relieved by Mr. Waris Ali, a clerk in the Bahrein Political Agency on the 25th December. Wali. —Ali bin Hamud was His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and Oman's Wali at Gwadur throughout the year. Police. —There are no police here. Several thefts of the goods of the British Indian traders have occurred in the past two years. No culprit has been traced in any of these cases. The Wali has 25 irregular Arab soldiers under him. Of them two work under the Collector of Customs and the rest take their duties by turns in the Sultani fort built against raiders- Sultan's Customs. —Seyed Ahmed Effendi was in charge of the Sultan's Customs throughout tlie year. Aviation. —A considerable number of planes landed at Gwadur during the year including the 'Iris' with the Under Secretary of State for Air as a passenger. Two observers of the Indian Meteorological Department are accom modated in the telegraph quarters at Gwadur. Local events. —Locusts made their appearance in the months of January and March and caused much damage to the harvest in Gwadur territory. Several earthquake shocks were felt here on three occasions in January. The one of tlth January was said to have lasted about 3^ seconds causing much damage to buildings- 71(c) f&amp;pd46 During the year 155 cases were settled to the satisfaction of the parties concerned without reference to the Muscat court. In 73 of these cases both parties were British protected persons, whereas the ramaining 82 cases were between British and Muscat subjects. Three petty criminal cases were also heard. There were two important semi-insolvency cases which were satisfactorily compromised shortly after the close of the year and one insolvency case affecting Gwadur merchants is pendiner in the court of the Political Agent, Muscat. The trade of Gwadur is mainly the export of dried fish to Ceylon, and of fish manure, fish fins and fish maws to London and Japan. Ourin^ the 3' ear about 50,000 packets of fish were exported of a value of approxi mate by Ks. 7,50,000. For the past three years the fish trade of Muscat has suffered from scarcity of fish and this has been reflected in a number of insolvency cases, in two of which about a lakh of rupees were involved. G. deSMIDT, Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, in Political Charge of Mekran Coast. Karachi, The 1st A pril 1929. Mu. A. W. Halkett's report No. 88, dated 1st January 1029, on the condition of the districts between JaSK and gwadur. Jask District. Mir Mustafa Khan continues to control this district assisted bv his son Murad Khan- • ^ b In April a small disturbance took place at Jask between the Mudir of Customs and Seyed Mohamed Saleh an influential Jask merchant supported by some tribesmen from old Jask. It appears that the Persian Postmaster was tampering with coi respondence handed him for despatch by the Syed and showing contents of the letters to the Mudir of Customs. It was found after those letters had been perused, that the Seyed was reporting the Mudir of C ustoms to Tehran for corrupt dealings, and the Mudir in a spirit of revenge, summoned the Seyed to the fort where the Customs Honqp is situated, and requested him to bring his fleet of dhows in front of the 'f &lt; 0I J P lea , tllat . the Seyed was engaged in smuggling. The Seved jefused to comply with the Mudir's request, whereupon Mudir arrested AMV if r 1Iji / &gt;I ' ma l tlon wa s conveyed to old Jask, whereupon Abdun arrived Jask with a following of about 80 armed Baluchis and de manded that the Seyed should be released.

On arrival of the launch firing commenced again, although there was not a single Baluchi in Jask at this time. It transpired that the local Officer Commanding Troops in order to show his superior onicer on the launch that his telegram for reinforce- ments was not an idle request, despatched four of his men with instructions to take up positions in the village and open fire on the fort. This, in his opinion ^ould show, that he was being attacked, and on arrival of the auncn the Bakichis had scattered. It was rather unfortunate for this 0 cer mat his men should have taken up positions alongside the houses of men employed by this Department. Throughout this fracas I kept in ouch mth the Baluchis through Mir Hoti, and as the tribesmen had assured me tnat the disturbance was not against the British and that they would respect the concession and British subjects. I saw no cause for alarm, as a 10 i Wa? P ure ^y a domestic nature. It has been reported that Seyed has been fined Krans 5,000 by the Central Persian Government ehran, for this affair, but has refused to pay, and has appointed a re presentative at lehran to fight his case with Medjliss. Although this Seyed 1 rom a hnancia^ standpoint is very influential, it does not alter the fact r! f £ \ S ^ S West t} J )e of Persian at Jask, and it is regrettable that the nritisn India Steam Navigation Company should have thought fit to ap point him their Agent for Jask. The local merchants have reported him by telegram to the Company at Bombay for refusing to permit them to ship jiieir goods in their own boats to the steamers, arguing tha,t his boats should be utilised tor this. If this man is permitted to continue the duties of Agent to the Company, the trade of Jask such as it is will be ruined. During the month of July six slaves, two women and four men ran away from Murad Khan at old Jask and sought the protection of the Officer ^ roo P s here - Murad Khan requested his Wazir to interview the Officer Commanding Troops and release them. Officer Commanding Iroops rexused to accede to the request of the Wazir whereupon Murad Khan stated he would attack the fort. A repetition of the incident which occurred m April was only averted by the Officer Commanding Troops reJeasing the slaves. &amp; } m .r 'Toi' Me d ioal Officer assumed charge of the duties of the Quarantine Medical Officer for the port of Jask on the 29th July.

Dost Mohamed Khan it is stated endeavoured to enlist the support of these chiefs to repel the Persian advance into his territory, but they both refused to lend him any aid, hoping that if the Persians succeeded in overthrowing Dost Mohamed Khan they may be favoured with lucrative appointments.

Sur is the port for Jaalan and the Eastern Provinces of Oman. It is the second largest port in Oman. It has always been a turbulent place and an entrepot for the slave trade and arms traffic. A weak administra tion, the undermining of the Sultan's authority through French Agency and a blood feud between the sections of the Jenebeh tribe who form the major portion of the population, are factors which have rendered it an easy prey for the Amir's machinations. In April, the Amirs established a new customs post in Aiqa and refused to furnish the Council's representative with any explanation re garding this customs post. Ihey then attempted to obtain mastery over the town by seizing Balad as Sur where the Wali resides and where the water supply of the town is situated. They were attacked there by the Arama and Fuwaris sections of the Jenebeh. Six of the Arama were killed in the engagement whilst the Bani Bu Ali lost ten killed and three wound ed. Sheikh Rashid, Minister for Shara, accompanied by Saiyid Shahab, brother of His Highness went to Sur to settle the dispute but. failed to accomplish anything. However, the Jenebeh finallv succeeded m buying off the Beni Bu Ali by agreeing to a payment of $20 on each of their boats for this year onlv and their Sheikhs calling,' on the Amirs. ' ©1-^ ^ m ^ rs wr ote to the Council demanding pavment of $&gt;10,000 expenses incurred in their action against the Jenebeh which they stated was taken at the request of Mr. Thomas, Finance Minister. In May. Abdullah bin Saleh, Secretary to Mahomed bin Nasir proceed- ed to Bushire to interview the Political Resident. He asserted the Bani Bu Ah did not recognize the Sultan's authority and attempted to obtain a ceitincate of identity at the Agency. He was directed to obtain a passport irom the Sultan's Government. ■ v, I ? ^ U ? y ' His Hi g hness the Sultan and the Council of Ministers fur nished their views on the situation at Sur and requested His Maiestv's (jovernment for assistance in dealing with the situation- t w ^ August 192 ®' tj 16 Amirs wrote to the Political Resident claiming that bur was a part of their territory, that the Sultan's Wali was there and customs collected with their permission, that the town and customs properT'me P rotectlon and everything would be accomplished in its On the 21st August, a party of about 15 Arabs chieflv of the Jenebeh boarded a Cutch Mandvi dhow- Delong ng to a British subject—Khimji Ramdas—which had arrived ^Ta^ofteTnd Rf ^1® crew with rifles and daggers and made off 'dth Nakhndp , -p ™ ^ e ' f P ersonaI Property belonging to the * x ' T - p Counci1 of Ministers arrested one of the gang in Muscat. stabbed th TV g W 0 H' th \V ^\ AUg i USt: the tW0 best ,lorses of t he Wali were ytabo^i. l^e Wall s Wahabi askaris were believed to be implicated in his, m conjunction with the Bani Bu Ali, and have been replaced The telepiione line between tne Wall's residence and the Customs was also cut uown and it has not been possible to maintain this line.51 About this time, a party of the Mashaikh tribe, who are now believed to be in league with the Bani Bu Ali, stationed themselves on the road between Sur and Balad as Sur looted all people coming into Sur and killed a number of donkeys. On the 15th September a robbery occurred in broad daylight from the shop of a British subject. On the 21st September, the Bani Bu Ali hoisted Ibn Sand's flag on a new flagstaff they had erected in Aiqa. On the same day, a caravan leaving tSur for Budiyah was seized by the same party of Fuwaris who had looted the British dhow. It was recovered subsequently. It left Sur again on the 29th September but was seized by a party of the Bani Bu Ali and taken to Aiqa. Mahomed bin Nasir wrote to say that his truce with the Hijriyin tribe was broken and he was stopping all caravans from Budiyah. The Bani Bu Ali also proposed charging anchorage fee and registering all dhows in Sur creek and Khor Jarama About this time, a block house formerly belonging to the Fuwaris but taken from them by Captain Alban and handed over to the Muscat author ities, was seized by the gang of Fuwaris mentioned above. This block house commanded the road between Sur and Balad as Sur. On the 13th October, letters were received by the Council of Ministers and by the Political Agent from Sheikh Isa bin Saleh objecting to the Amirs hoisting a foreign flag at Aiqa or to the Bani Bu Ali making any treaty with a foreigner and asking for the matter to be represented to II. B. M's. Government telegraphically. The Council of Ministers called on the Political Agent on the 13th and again on the 15th October. They laid much emphasis on the seriousness of the situation. They stated they were unable to deal with the Bani Bu Ali but proposed taking action against the gang of Fuwaris with the gun of the 'A1 Saeed' and 50 men of the Muscat Infantry. They asked for the moral support of one of H. M.'s Sloops. The Council of Ministers on board S.iS. 'Al Saeed', and the Political Agent on board H. M S. 'Crocus' arrived at Sur on the 23rd October. The block house occupied by the gang of Fuwaris was bombarded on the 24th October but the gun of the 'Al Saeed' was not powerful enough to do much damage. The gang evacuated the block-house but reoccupied it again after the departure of H. M. S. 'Crocus' and S.S. 'Al Saeed'. Fighting was reported about this time between the Bani Bu Ali and Bani Bu Hassan. An engagement took place at Nijood in which the former had five and the latter three casualties. On the 14th November the block-house mentioned above was bombard ed by H. M. S. 'Cyclamen' in the presence of His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief on board H. M. ;S. 'Effingham'. The Council of Ministers and the Political Agent being on board H. M. S. 'Cyclamen'. Amir Ali bin Abdullah left Sur for Jeddah via Aden early in Novem ber. In December, two askaris of the Wali were shot by men of the Makhana section. A ffairs in Sheikh Isa bin Saleh's and the Imam's relations with the Muscat State have been friendly throughout the year. Sheikh Suleiman al Baruni has continued in the service of the Imam His financial scheme was opposed by the people of Rustaq, Nizwa and Badiyah and fell through. The people of Semail however paid their taxes without opposition. Suleiman al Baruni's son Saeed who was with his father returned to Constantinople on August 21st via Iraq.

Some leading pearl dealers like Muhammad All Zainal Eeza and Monsieur Rosenthal visited Dibai and made purchases. Relations with Ihn Saud. —No direct interference by Ibn Saud in Tru- cial Coast affairs was noticed during the vear, although his agent for Baraimi is known to have visited some of the Trucial Shaikhs. During the summer the two sons of Saqar bin Zaid, late Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, who was killed on the 1st January 1928, paid a visit to Ibn Jaluwi, Amir of H. M. Kino- Ibn Saud in Hasa and presented him with 7 camels. On their return to Abu Dhabi, they gave out that Ibn Jaluwi was sending one Muhammad bin Mansur, a negro holding an important position, to Baraimi to collect taxes from the tribes of Al Bu Shamis, Daru, Awamer and the Manasir, who are on treaty terms with Ibn Saud, and to turn away from Abu Dhabi the Manasir Fidawis (body guard) of Shaikh Shakhbut, ruler of Abu Dhabi who had had a hand in the murder of the late Ruler. It may be remembered that in 1927, Shaikh Shakhbut and his brother Hazza both sons of Sultan bin Zaid, a previous Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, attempted to occupy Dalmah island, supposedly at the instigation of King Ibn Saud, and only withdrew when Shaikh Sapar despatched a force against them. Speaking generally, however, King Ibn Saud has maintained a correct attitude as far as the Sheikhs of Trucial Oman proper are con cerned. The interior tribes he has undoubtedly tried to bring under con trol, but the coastal communities he has left strictly alone. Shargah. —Ruler :—Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar-al-Qasimi. During the year the Ruler of Shargah, surrendered the village Dhaid to Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad, ex-Shaikh of Shargah in accordance with mutual arrangement. This was an old bone of contention. And the settlement was a most satisfactory one. Hostilities again broke out between the Shaikhs of Fujairah and Kalba on the Batineh Coast during the summer, but at the close of vear, a peace y had been patched up through the intervention of the Ruler of Ras-al- jKhaimah. As an act of clemency the Government of India at the recommendations of the Political Resident, who was impressed with the improved conduct and general balance of young Shaikh, on his visit, were pleased to reduce by one year the term of banishment of Shaikh Abdur Rahman uncle of the Ruler of Shargah. Shaikh Abdur Rahman will now return to his home in June 1929. Dibai. —Ruler :—Shaikh Saeed bin Maktum al Hashar. The Shaikh proceeded to Mecca on a pilgrimage in April and returned ,in June. He has continuously been friendly during the year and as a mark of appreciation, it has been proposed that his salute be increased from 3 to 5 guns. During the year the outstanding claim of the estate of a Persian Ghai- bullah Lari for Rs. 90,000 against the Ruler of Dibai was compromised for ,Rs. 34,000. The well-known Qawam of Shiraz, had interested himself on behalf of the deceased. Three Hindus, British Indian Subjects, had claims against one Arab Nasir bin Rashid, who in turn claimed Rs. 1,50,000, from a Hindu by name Damodardas Lalchand., It was considered impolitic that the Political Resident should force Arabs to pay up the claims of British subjects without making the British subjects pay the Arab claims. Difficulty arose when Damodardas Lalchand disregarded the Political Resident's orders. The case was however eventually compro mised between the parties but it emphasised strongly the necessity for defining clearly, the Political Resident's jurisdiction in Trucial Oman.55 Ajman. Shaikh Humaid bin Abdul Aziz, Ruler of Ajman (Trucial Oman) died on the 20th April 1928. son Rashid bin Humaid, a young man of 25 years succeeded his a ler, and has since been recognised by the Government of India, as the Ruler ot Ajman, on his giving the usual undertaking to abide by all treaties iind agreements. •' 4 /MaR—Shaikh Saqar bin Zaid, Ruler of Abu Dhabi, was murder- him ^ 1S ne P hew ' Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan succeed- d n n as Ruler and the Government of India recognised him as suth.

Nothing to report. General Remarks. —(1) It is daily becoming more difficult for the Resi- dency Agent, Shargah, to control efficiently the affairs of his very extensive charge. The remedy would appear to lie in the appointment of a Politi- Agenf 611 ' Trucial Coast or at least an Assistant to the Residency (2). Persian Government and Trucial Several cases came to the notice of the Political Resident, where the Persian authorities charged inhabitants of Dibai, the fee of 'Persian Tazkerah' on their landing at Persian Ports. The same applied also to subjects of Kuwait and Muscat. Persian Officials have from time to time attempted to visit Diba,i. For jnstance in November, the Persian Inspector of Customs Bandar Abbas en route to Bushire went across to Dihai, and tried into' the port on the plea that his launch required repairs. The Shaikh of Dibai however nnderstanding the real object, ordered him to leave at once and he com plied. The Henjam incident and the subsequent flight of .the Ruler of Heniam ^ lass!a ^ o n the Arab mainland, caused the greatest excitement aiontr the rrucial Coast, more especially among the Bani Yas elements who stretch from Dibai to Qatar. The Shaikh of Hen jam's sister is own mother to the Ruler of Dibai and ivery great efforts were made to get the whole Bani Yas confederation to assist actively and forcibly recover Henjam for the exiled Sheikh. The Shaikh of Dibai kept his head, however, and the situation was aWy controlled by the Residency Agent, Shargah, assisted by the ships of the Royal Navy. J 1 CHAPTER IX. Administration Report of the Political Agency, Bahrein, for the year 1928. Personnel. —Lieut.-Colonel C. C. J. Barrett, C S I C I E held charge of the Agency throughout the year. Khan Sahib Mirza Al'i was Indian Assistant from 1st January to 20th May when he wa&lt;j relipvprl K, Khan Bahadur Seyed Siddiq Hasan who held the post for the remainde^ of the year. Ruler of Bahrein and Al-KhalifaFamily .—The attitude of Shaikh Isa towards the Political Agent has 'been friendlv. He was particularlv gratified by the assistance given in procuring the cancellation of the orders which prohibited the return to Bahrein of his nephews Ibrahim and Sulai- man the sons of the late Shaikh Khahd. The relations between the Ruler .and the Agency may now be considered as satisfactory as the old Shaikh has tacitly accepted his position. The usual official calls between tb P R,,W and the Officers of the Indian Government were exchanged.53 In March owing to the claims to sovereignty advanced by the Persian Government, Shaikh Isa on behalf of himself and his islands gave His Majesty's Government authority to represent the Bahrain State, in rebut ting Persian pretensions, before the League of Nations. The relations between the Agency and Shaikh Hamad, the Deputy (Ruler have continued to be very cordial. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa has been of great assistance to the Bahrain Government, He is particularly interested in education and to his initia- jtive is due the entry of 7 Bahrain boys including one of his own sons and ^ son of his brother Mahomed at the American University of Beirut in October of this year, He has also continued to interest himself in the affairs of the Muharraq Municipality. He paid his customary visits to the main land for hawking. Shaikh Mahomed bin Isa visited Labanon during the hot weather and went to Lingah for a hawking expedition during November. He was still absent at the end of the year. Shaikh Sulaiman bin Hamad continued to perform his duties as Joint Magistrate and Judge of the Bahrain Court in a satisfactory manner, while other members of the Al-Khalifa family have been employed in appoint ments of lesser importance. Bahrain State. —Mr. C. D. Belgrave went to England on leave at the beginning of May and returned at the end of October. During his absence the duties of Adviser to Shaikh Hamad were performed by Captain L. S. Parke. The Ruler of Kuwait visited Bahrain by aeroplane on 31st August and returned to his State the next day. There has been a continual succession of Shaikhs from the Arab and Persian shores of the Gulf and from Muscat all anxious to enjoy Shaikh Hamad's hospitality. The relations between Sunnis and Shias have been satisfactory through out the year. In November Saiyid Adnan the Shiah Qadhi died. His post remain ed vacant till the end of the year, owing to difficulty in finding a suitable successor, acceptable to the two Shiah factions. The revival in an active form of the Persian claims to Bahrain has caused a considerable amount of discussion and there has undoubtedly been some Persian propaganda. There has however been no excitement. ' The Persian inhabitants although they would naturally welcome the inclusion of Bahrain in their Empire have remained quiet while the rest of the people have no desire to exchange the easy conditions under which they live for the rapacity of Persian Governors or the high taxation of the Persian State. During the early part of the year three geologists employed by the Eastern and General Syndicate made extensive surveys of the island, but no further progress in the gaining of oil is to be reported. Messrs. Khalil Kanoo and Mahomed Yateem have carried out several borings for water, with the result that the number of wells sunk is now 55 and Manama and Muharraq islands are very well supplied with water both for drinking and for irrigation purposes. ' The strength of the gush at Barbar in Mahomed Yateem's own garden is particularly remarkable. This gentleman has been experimenting in the growing of vegetables. Shaikh Hamad is causing a tube well to be sunk on Umm A1 Nasan island, on which he has released some deer. A new Court for the trial of Diving cases was instituted during the year. It consists of four leading personages connected with the pearl trade who give their services free. The other State Courts remained unchanged. An increase in litigation due to greater faith in the justice of the Courts is reported. Municipalities. —The Municipalities at Manama and Muharraq con tinued to do excellent work throughout the year. A large and sanitary5/ ha ® bee ' 0 P e ned at Manama.

Five classes besides f simnle Kindergarten were maintained. simple The mam features of the year's work were the opening of the olav ground and the library Through friends in America funds were ed for buying and installing a fine set of play ground equipment includW Swings, Sea-Saws, Trapeze etc. This play ground has proved' immenseW popular and while primarily for the girls' school the privilege of eW ing, t has been extended to the public at large. The boys who are permitted o use the grounds in the latter part of the afternoon and even men of all ages thoroughly appreciate the indulgence. The Library is entirely a school affair and while simple is proving a big factor m developing the girls' taste for reading. g Bahrain Police Force .--Captain L. S. Parke, continued in command of the Force throughout the year. The number of Indian Police was reduced to 98 while the Arabs numbered 24. The conduct of the members was S58 on the whole, though there was an undercurrent of unrest during July r which however subsided after the dismissal of the fomenters of trouble. The peace of Manama and neighbouring villages was disturbed during August and September, but the arrest of a gang of Persian robbers at the end of September put a stop to further trouble. A number of Hasawis who Are suspected to have been concerned in the troubles of 1926, including the attempted murder of Shaikh Hamad, were arrested in November. Trade. —The year was fairly good for the pearling industry and conse quently for trade generally. There is no duty on pearls exported so the value cannot be accurately ascertained. The sale of superior pearls showed an increase of 10—15 per cent., while the sale of those of inferior quality decreased by about 20 per cent. The turn over was much the same as in 1927. The import of motor cars shows a falling off as the island is now well stocked. The total value of trade amounted to £3,043,222 as compared with £3,012,980 in 1926-27, showing an increase of £30,242 or 1 per tent. The total value of imports amounted to £2,029,181 as against £1,897,551 in 1926-27, showing an increase of £131,630 or 6-9 per cent. The increase was chiefly in specie, rice, kerosine oil and piece-goods. Imports by native craft show a falling off, due partly, to dullness in the date and Chandal market, partly to steamer competition. The boat building industry is in good condition. 89 new craft were bi,iilt during the year. The canvas making industry has been steady. It has been able fully to oope with the local demand. New centres of the industry have opened at DARAZ, MARKH and BANI JUMREH villages. The workers are all Bahrainis. The manufacture of matting and pottery has remained steady. Shipping. —66 British and 7 German ships visited the port during the year. The B. I, S. N. Co. ships of the slow Gulf service called at Bahrain weekly on their way to Basra, and fortnightly on their way south. A weekly service to India and greater punctuality in arrivals would be much appre ciated by the merchants. To give further security to shipping certain improvements in local port lighting are being considered. A beacon at BAB-AL-HAD,HAR, which is of value to dhows and launches plying between Manama and Qatif was re built. The following visits were paid by His Majesty's Ships :— Postal. —A branch of the Indian Post Office is established in the Agency at Manama but it has not yet undertaken the duty of delivering letters at the residence of addresses. With effect from 1st November an extra postman was. engaged whose duty it is to deliver letters at Muharraq town, clear the letter box recently established near the Muharraq Customs pier and sell postage stamps to the public. There is no record of the number of letters posted and received for deli very. The receipts from the sale of stamps was Rs. 10,000. The number Arrived. Left. H. M.S.

Judicial. —The number of Civil Suits) filed in the Court of the Political Agent was 1,697 and that of Criminal Cases was 302. In addition there were 82 Miscellaneous petitions. The total number of petitions received during the year was 2,081. Criminal cases were mostly of common assault or theft, but the Sessions Court of the Political Agent tried 3 cases in which 8 persons were accused of grievous hurt endangering life, theft and attempt to murder. One man was sentenced to imprisonment for life, one man to 7 years' rigorous imprison ment, a third to 5 years' rigorous imprisonment, while 5 men were acquitted. Medical.- —Assistant Surgeon R. Holmes remained in charge of the Victoria Memorial Hospital from 1st January to 23rd July, and from 22nd. October to the end of the year. During the intervening period charge was held by Assistant Surgeon E. C. Hynes. The Assistant Surgeon is also in medical charge of the Bahrain Police Force and is medical adviser to the ^Shaikh of Bahrain. 233 indoor and 5,563 outdoor patients received treatment in the Victoria Memorial Hospital. Six deaths due to Pneumonia, Tubercle of the Lung and Fractures are reported. The prevailing diseases were Malaria, and Diseases of the eyes and Respiratory diseases. In spite of the sinking of many tube wells no in crease in Malaria is reported. There were no epidemics of plague or cholera but small pox prevailed during the early part of the year. A Municipal Vaccination Depot was opened, one male and one female vaccinator being engaged, but little progress in vaccination was made. There were only 369 vaccinations during the year. The Arabs believed that vac cinations during an epidemic is dangerous while it is unnecessary when small pox is absent from the island. The Medical Officer considers that the unskilled efforts of vaccinators from Iraq is, responsible for the low estimation in which vaccination is now held. The State is considering the proper steps to take against unqualified medical practitioners. The Hospital Boat made three voyages to the Pearl Banks during the year. 917 cases were treated by the Officer in Charge. Th^ prevailing diseases were Diseases of Respiration, Diseases) of the ear and Diseases of the skin. 15 cases of scurvy were treated but no case of fish bite came under observation. The American Mission maintains two hospitals, the Mission Memorial for men and the Marion Wells Thorns Memorial for women. Both hospitals have been busy all the year. Patients come from Nejd, Persia, and most parts of the Persian Gulf. The equipment of the plants is constantly being improved. The new well with its abundant water supply has proved a great asset as well as a benefit to the Mission's neighbours. 23,250 men and 8,996 women received dispensary treatment while 490 major and 297 minor operations were performed. 541 male and 147 female patients were received into the hospital as in-patients.60 Visits of Government officials .—The Hon'ble Lieut.-Colonel L.

Xhebe men decided that certain modern inventions such as motor cars and wireless telegraphy whose use Bm Sa'ud permitted in the sacred land were against religion and should be prohibited. laisal ad Dawish was the chief spirit in this movement. In order to create trouble for Bin Sa'ud who had not compensated him, as he considered he deserved, for besieging Medmah, whose governor he had hoped to become, he incited the Akhwan to attack the posts which the Iraq Government had too? foil ^ j ^ rolltler - T k e rai d was made on Busaiyah in November reif.fl TV y Se raids in most of which the Akhwan were suc- j* j a .i f, 1 ' 8 sl, l ccess .encouraged the other Akhwan who began to gather ronnd Ad Dawish in order that they might have a share of the plunder Bin Sa ud was not able at first to take effective action to check Bin Dawish's following who were raiding Iraq.

BIN LUAI and Sa'ud al AKFA dissuaded Bin Dawish and Bin Hnmaid, who were about to col laborate m a raid on Iraq, from making the attempt. Bin Sa'ud promised them that the posts to which they objected would be demolished Tnd their demands would be carried out. He suggested that the best course would be for the Akhwan to wait until he settled matters with the Iraq Government by negotiations. The Akhwan whose activities were curtailed in anv case by the advent of summer agreed to His MajestyVsuggestions. This was the situation until Bin Sa'ud who had been to Heiaz for the pilgrimage season returned to Riadh in September. He then invited all e chiefs to a meeting for the discussion of the general situation. The chiefs FaS Ad D™h S oTthe T e T^ Cepti0 ^ 0f Bin , Humaid of the Ataibah and Faisal Act JJawish, of the Umtair, who sent his son AZAIZ to renresent , m ' ^ conference decided that the action of Faisal ad Dawish and those who followed him was contrary to religion as they had acted without th^ previous permission of Bin Sa'ud; that modern inventions were not unlaw M and so were permissible; and further that the Amir Sa'ud bin Abdnlaziz bm ^a ud should be recognised as heir apparent.61 The prohibition of trade between Nejd and Kuwait continued and most of tne Nejd trade passed through Bahrain to the ports of Jubail, Oatif and XJqair. ^ The Wahabi influence increased in Qatar during the year and many presents of arms and ammunition were made by the Shaikh of Qatar to Bin Sa ud. Bin Sa ud has realised that he cannot depend on the foreigners employed by him. He has accordingly sent 7 students to Egypt for education. During the year foreigners were prohibited from holding land in Hasa. x)* Hindu traders living in Qatif were expelled by order of t v?'

On nth November the Political Agent visited Qatif and on 25th Dec- cember Mahomed bin Suwailim, Amir of Qatif returned his visit at Bahrain. • I clitical Agent and the Bahrain Government's relations with the neighbouring Nejdian Governors were good at the end of the year. The Deputy Kuler of Bahrain's inclination is to defer to Bin Sa'ud's wishes in every possible way. Qatar. The Political Agent paid two visits to Qatar during the year. Shaikh Abdullah s relations with Bin Sa'ud remained good throughout the year. The cordiality between them was marked by Bin Sa'ud's gift of a Georgian slave girl, who was sent to Shaikh Abdullah in July and bv costly presents valued at Rs. 50,000 presented in Riadh to the Shaikh of Qatar's relations, who were returning from pilgrimage. Shaikh Abdullah appears to have made return gifts of arms and ammunition. In spite of Shaikh Abdullah's denial, when questioned by the Political Agent, there is little doubt that slaves are imported from the interior and sold freely in the Qatar markets. Shaikh Abdullah himself treats) his slaves well and is probably anxious to ease the lot of the unfortunate blacks, but his influence throughout his principality and even in his own capital, where his brothers defy him, is small. The lot of the slave who has to dive for his master in summer and shepherd the sheep and collect firewood in winter is not a happy one. The import by sea of slaves mostly Baluchis is very small. There is no regular trade but 8 or 9 men and women may have been surreptitiously imported via Abu Dhabi and Dalmah. The Customs revenue for the year was about Rs. 1,23,000.

CHAPTER X. i Administration Heport of the Kuwait Political Agency for the year 1928. Personnel Lieutenant-Colonel J. C. More, D.S.O., held charge of the Political Agency throughout the year. Assistant Surgeon A. L. Greenway, M R.C.S., L.R.C.P., was in Medical Charge of the Agency and Charitable Dispensary, and performed the duties of Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year. The Ruling Family. Shaikh 'Ali as-Salim, the second son of the late Ruler, was killed in an action against Mutair raiders at Riqa'i on the 28th January. In the same engagement Shaikh 'Ali al-Khalifah, the Ruler's second cousin, was very severely wounded, and was not finally discharged from Hospital until the 9th August. His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Subah, C.I.E., Ruler of Kuwait, visited Bahrain by air on the 31st August in an Imperial Airways aeroplane chartered for the journey by a pearl merchant, and returned the following morning. His uncle, Shaikh Hamad al-Mubarak, officiated for him during his absence 111 feeling had existed for some time between Shaikh Subah an-Nasir, the Ruler's cousin, and his younger brother Shaikh 'Abdullah, a boy of seventeen. Matters came to a head in the beginning of December when Shaikh 'Abdullah, objecting to his brother disposing of an old car which lie thought he should have given to him, took it forcibly from its new owner. Shaikh Subah, who was out in camp at the time, wrote a letter to the Ruler63 reporting the matter and asking him to deal with his brother, but Shaikh Ahmad took no action. A few days later Shaikh 'Abdullah interfered with, his brother's chauffeur who had come into Kuwait to buy supplies, and thereby delayed ins return to camp. The next morning, the 14th Decem ber, Shaikh Sub ah came into Kuwait and told Shaikh 'Abdullah that things could not go on like that, and suggested that they should go together to the Ruler and get their quarrel settled. Shaikh 'Abdullah agreed, and they started oft' together to Shaikh Ahmad's Palace outside the east of the town in Shaikh Subah's car. Just as they were leaving the town, however, a fresh violent quarrel broke out, which resulted in Shaikh 'Abdullah, who having come in from camp had his rifle with him, killing Shaikh 'Abdullah. Shaikh Subah left his brother's body in the road and drove straight back to his camp, but was arrested the next morning and brought into Kuwait and put in prison. His chauffeur and servant, who took no action at all to stop the quarrel, were publicly flogged. Condition of the Country. Early in January messengers sent by the Shaikh of Kuwait with letters to Ibn Sa'iid, complaining of a raid on his subjects by Ibn Shuqair in December 1927, arrived back with a reply expressing regret and promising restitution. They had been told that a force under Fahd bin 'Abdullah bin Jiluwi which was being ordered up from Hasa would deal with Ibn Shuqair. The promise, however, was never kept, as Tbn Shuqair temporarily evacuat ed his village of Jaryah, and Ibn Jiluwi's force was withdrawn in February. On the evening of the 27th January news reached Kuwait that 'Ali bin 1 Ash wan, of the Aulad Wksil sub-section of the Buraih Mutair, with a force of 350 camel riders and 50 horsemen, had raided the Kuwait J Uraibdar at Umm Ruwaisat, 38 miles north-west of Jahrah, killing three men and carrying off a considerable number of camels and sheep. All available cars in Kuwait were at once commandeered and sent out to Jahrah the same night, with orders to proceed to Eiqa'i, 90 miles further to the west, south-west as soon as it was light enough to see, in the hope of cutting off the raiders' retreat. This they succeeded in doing, and at 4-30 p.m . on the 28th January fifteen cars out of twenty five which had left Kuwait arrived at Riqa'i a very creditable performance, seeing that there is no road beyond Jahrah and all the cars were grossly overloaded, some carrying as many as nine men. There they encountered the raiders and at once attacked them. Although only numbering seventy five rifles, the Kuwait force was very much better armed than the raiders, to whom moreover the motor car was an entirely new factor in war. The result was that the Kuwait force in flicted very heavy casualties on the enemy, and forced them to abandon a considerable portjon of the booty, their own casualties being light although they included their commander, Shaikh 'Ali al-Khalifah, who was severely wounded. After the engagement proper was over, Shaikh 'Ali as-Sdlim, a very gallant but hot headed youth who had been delayed by car trouble, arrived on the scene and was much galled at finding himself too late for theengage- ment In direct defiance of orders he insisted in pushing on, with the result that he and his party were trapped in the Batin, where they fought till they ran out of ammunition and were eventually butchered in cold blood. But for this regrettable incident, the action of the Kuwait force would have been ;an unqualified success. As it was the Kuwait casualties on the 28th January were eleven killed and eleven wounded, of whom one subsequently died, while the Mutair certainly lost over thirty five killed. Four Kuwait cars had to be tempo- rarilv abandoned but were brought in afterwards, and it is interesting to note that one which had fallen into the Tkhwan's hands was able to come in under its own power. They had tried to render it unserviceable but b' o n( l breaking the instruments on the dash board and wrenching ofi the doors, they had done little harm to it.64 On the 29t'h January British aeroplanes located the raiders fifteen miles north of Hafar al-Batin. The raiders opened fire on the aircraft, which replied with bombs and machine gun fire. They again attacked the raiders eight miles south of Hafar al-Batin on the afternoon of the 30th January, and inflicted some casualties on both occasions. On the 19th February some sections of the Juwarin, of the Muntafik confederation of Iraq, and some other tribes were attacked near Janshan in the Batin, some fifty miles south west of Zubair, by a force of Ikhwan estimated at a thousand camels carrying two men each and a large number of horse—probably 2.300 men in all—under Faisal ad-Dawish, the para mount shaikh of the Mutair, in person. The 'Iraq tribesmen had twenty- six men killed and eighteen wounded, and lost 130 camels and nearly 1,800 sheep. On the same day an aeroplane reconnaissance located two parties of raiders, a large one ten miles south of Janshan, and a smaller one near Riqa'i. A later reconnaissance on the same day observed parties in the neighbourhood of Janshan spread over a large area driving off plunder. All parties seen were attacked, and the aeroplanes were heavily fired on in return. One aeroplane fell in flames and the pilot was killed, but there were no other British casualties. On the 20th February the raiders were attacked from the air as they retired, and again on the 21st February, on the latter occasion the bombing being distinctly audible from Kuwait. On the morning of the 24-th February aeroplanes proceeded from the Neutral Zone between 'Irdqand Najd via Hafar-al-Batin to Lisafah (wrong ly shown on maps as Safah). Twenty miles to the north, north west of Lisafah a large camp of white tents was located, surrounded by camels, horses and flocks of sheep. Some of the aeroplanes dropped their bombs on this camp, and the remainder proceeded to Lisdfah itself and bombed it. though at neither place were the results as good as had been hoped. Faisal ad-Dawish had apparently been at Lisafah until that very morning, but had left there for Artawlyah shortly before the bombing took place. Reports were next received that Ibn Humaid, the paramount shaikh of the powerful 'Utaibah tribe had invited the other Ikhwdn leaders to meet him on the 7th March at Shaqra, ninety miles south of Artawiyah, for a huge combined raid. This was confirmed by a prisoner who was captured from a party of Mutair who fired on some British armoured cars at Hafar al-Bdtin on the 12th March, according to whom Dawish had suggested a combined raid after Ramadhan, which ended on the 22nd March, but Ibn Humaid had insisted on immediate action It was said that the raid was to be a very big one, and was to have Basrah as its objective. The raid did not materialize, however, and it was afterwards learnt that although Ibn Humaid actually left his village of Ghatghat according to p:ogramme, he only got as far as Shams, seventy miles west by north of Riyddh, when he was overtaken by Khalid bin Luwai, a member of the Sharifian family and one of the leading Ikhwkn of the Hijaz, who had arrived at Riyadh a few days earlier and now went to him on Ibn Sa'ud's behalf to try and induce him to return. He succeeded for the time being, as Ibn Humaid did return to Ghatghat, though leaving his standard at Shams. On the 21st March Ibn Humaid visited Dawfsh at Artdwfyah, and suggested that they should make their joint raid then. The Mutair how ever had had enough of fighting for the time being, and were unwilling to co-operate Accordingly, on the 24th March Ibn Humaid left Jarab, a few miles to the north west of Artawiyah, with a considerable force of his own 'Utaibah, intending to attack Salman Post. Ibn Sa'ud, however, who by this time had accepted the British invitation to discuss outstanding ques tions with Sir Gilbert Clayton, again succeeded in stopping him, this time by sending his relative, Sa'iid al-'Arafah, and the well known divine, the Shaikh al-'Anqari. They overtook Ibn Humaid at Ajibbah, and after some little trouble persuaded him to hold his hand and confer with Ibn Sa'ud.65 Accordingly on the 10th April Ibn Sa'ad left Riyadh for Buraidah, and on the 14th Dawish joined Ibn Humaid at Ja'lah, twenty-five miles to the north of it, both shaikhs having large forces of their tribesmen with them. Ibn Sa'ud invited both leaders to come into Buraidah together, but this they refused to do, and demanded that Ibn Sa'iid should come outside and meet them in the desert, but he in turn feared to agree to this. Thus no actual meeting took place, but a temporary agreement was arrived at through the instrumentality of Sa'ud al-'Arafah and Ibn Musa'ad, by which the Ikhwan leaders undertook to abstain from aggressive action against 'Iraq for the time being and give Ibn Sa'ud a free hand to negotiate with Sir Gilbert Clayton. Ibn Sa'ud left Buraidah for Hail en route for the Hijaz on the 28th April, and the Ikhwan leaders returned to their res pective headquarters. Meanwhile, on the 14th April a small raid had taken place a few miles to the south west of Wafrah in the Neutral Zone between Kuwait and Najd, a camp of the 'Awazim being attacked by a party of raiders from 'Iraq believed to have been commanded by Midbaj Abu Shuwairibat, a scion of that notorious family of the Birzan sub-section of the Buraih^Mutair which seceded from the Ikhwan and took refuge in 'Iraq and then caused so much trouble by raiding into Najd, until moved from the frontier by the 'Irkq Gov ernment in 1925. Another member of this family, 'Ali Abu Shuwairibkt, had tried to cause trouble the previous month by approaching a minor shaikh of the 'Ajman in the service of the Shaikh of Kuwait, and, represent ing himself as speaking on King Faisal's behalf, inciting him to raid into. Najd. He had been deported by the Shaikh of Kuwait. Ibn Sa'ud arrived at Jiddah on the 7th May, and conversations between him and Sir Gilbert Clayton took place between the 8th and 20th May, and again between the 2nd and 9th August, but on both occasions they broke down over the question of the posts at Busaiyah, etc., which 'Iraq had built in the desert. It was explained to Ibn Sa'ud that His Majesty's Government had to maintain the principle that both Governments were free to take what measures they thought desirable for the control and defence of the desert within their own frontiers, but he argued that the establish ment of these posts was a contravention of Article 3 of the 'Uqair Protocol and demanded that they should be demolished. Whether or not Ibn Sa'ud himself believes his own arguments, it would have been difficult for him to have taken any other line of action, as his tribesmen all feel so strongly on the subject of these Posts, which they look on as the thin end of the wedge in the penetration of INajd itself, that he could hardly have hoped to retain any control at all if he had agreed to the contention that 'Iraq was justified in building them. On the 8tli September Ibn Sa'iid arrived back in Riyadh, and at once sent messengers to all the leading men of Najd and chief shaikhs of the Ikhwan summoning them to attend a Conference in Riyadh at the end of September. All obeyed the summons except Faisal ad-Dawish, Ibn Humaid and Ibn Hithlain. Dawish sent his son, 'Abdul 'Aziz or 'Uzaiyiz as he is usually called, to represent him, but at first Ibn Sa ud refused to receive him, and demand ed Da wish's presence in person—as also that of Ibn Humaid and Ibn Hithlain The Conference was delayed for a long time in the hope that they could be induced to attend, but was eventually held without them the three defaulting shaikhs being 'deposed' from the chieftainship of their respective tribes-this, however, was a mere pretence which no one m Na^d took seriously. The Ikhwan put forward three demands (1) The abolition of the taxes which Ibn Sa'ud had recently been levying on the tribes in addition to the legal zakat. To this Ibn Sa'ud agreed. (2) The abolition of motor cars, wireless telegraphy, and other 'infidel' inventions. Ibn Sa'ud replied that he considered such things of real benefit to the faithful, but that even so, he 71f&amp;pd66 was perfectly ready to burn all he had and do without them for the future if they wished it, provided that they at the same time would burn all their arms and ammunition, which were equally invented and manufactured by infidels. The matter was discussed by the religious leaders, and it was eventually decided that both were equally lawful. (3) The demolition of the 'Iraq Desert Posts. This demand, with which it was obviously impossible for Ibn Sa'ud to comply, caused the most trouble, and the best that Ibn Sa'ud could do was to persuade the Ikhwkn to keep the peace and take no action against the Posts for a further period of two months, to enable him to make one final attempt to obtain their demoli tion bv friendly negotiation. Ibn Sa'iid had to promise, moreover, that if he failed in this attempt he would be with } them heart and soul in an attack on the Posts—a promise which there is little doubt he never intended to fulfil. Ibn Sa'ud on his side demanded that the Ikhwan would only trade with such places as he directed, and to this they agreed. This was of course largely to prevent trade with Kuwait, w T hich for monetary reasons he is unwilling to allow. Ibn Jiluwi had recently restricted trade with Jubail and Qatff in order to induce the tribes to come to Hasa, but this had resulted in their coming more to Kuwait, and by October the Mutair and other tribes were ignoring the embargo and coming into the town quite openly. This largely ceased after the Conference, and was further prevented by a detachment sent for the purpose by Ibn Jiluwi. On the conclusion of the Conference Ibn Sa ud distributed exceptionally lavish presents of money, arms, camels, etc., to 'Uzaiyiz and the other Ikhwfoi leaders. Ibn Sa'ud next informed the Political Agent, Bahrain, through his agent there, that he would like to meet him and invited him to come to Hasa when he himself went there. The invitation was accepted but shortly afterwards, on the 5th December, Ibn Sa ud sent word to the ro i tical Agent, Bahrain, that he was detained in Riyadh and could not come to Hasa at present, so no meeting between them took place. About Uie same time Ibn Sa'iid received a communication through the British Agent at Jiddah regarding the decision of His Majesty's Government regarding the negotiations between himself and Sir Gilbert Clayton and agreed in prin ciple to the proposal that the points under dispute between Irhq and JNa.id should be referred to arbitration. It was possibly this that induced him to change his plans, or it may have been certain disquieting symptoms ot un rest amongst his tribes which became evident. In the beginning of December rumours reached Kuwait that Ibn Lkmi, who had been somewhat insubordinate of late and had left the Kiyad Conference without permission, had been contemplating a raid, but ma Dawfsh had forbidden him to do so during the two months truce which had been arranged. Then a man arrived in Kuwait who had left Riyadh on the 9th Decem ber, and had heard a few days later on the way that Dawish had sent word to Ibn Sa'iid that he was preparing to go raiding—presumably on tlie expiration of the two months. On the 30th December information was received that a big raid was being planned : Ibn Hithlain had joined Fuqm at Jaryah, Dawish was advancing from Artawfyah almost immediately, and Ibn Lami had already moved off. The Shaikh of Kuwait sent out patrols, although he thought there was little fear ot any action against his tribes--except possibly by Ibn Hithlam in the event of his acting alone—and considered the Irdq Desert Posts a much more likely objective for all.67 A small raid on some Shammar in the Hajarah by Ibn La$ii apparently did take place, bat this is of little or no political importance, as nothing further happened. The explanation of this may be found in the report of a reliable man who left Riyadh on the 21st December, where he said there had been talk of impending raids for some time. According to him Ibn Sa'iid recently sent word to Ibn Humaid that, as he would not come and visit him in Riyadh, he proposed coming to see him at Ghatghat. Ibn Humaid replied that he would not agree to this either, but that he was will ing to meet him in the desert if he liked. Eventually it was agreed that a meeting should take place at Shauqi, ninety three miles north by west of Riyadh, and Ibn Humaid had invited Da wish and Ibn Hithlain to attend as well. Nothing more is likely to happen until this meeting has taken place, but whether or not Ibn Sa'iid can induce the Ikhwan to keep the peace after wards remains to be seen. He will presumably try to persuade them to do so until the arbitration is over. Defence of Kuwait. At the end of February the situation was so obscure that to guard against the danger of a possible attack on the town of Kuwait, H. M. Ss. 'Emerald'', 'Lupm' and 'Crocus' were ordered to Kuwait, and a land ing party was disembarked and maintained on shore. A temporary air base was also established, and a flight of aeroplanes and a section (later tem porarily increased to two sections) of armoured cars ordered to Kuwait. Meanwhile the organization of the Kuwait forces progressed satis factorily, and by the beginning of March every man knew his post. There were certainly over three thousand well armed riflemen in the town, not counting the garrison of Jahrah, which it was intended to withdraw to Kuwait on the approach of a large force. H. M. S 'Enterprise' relieved H. M. S. 'Emerald' in the beginning of April, but it was not until the middle of that month that any reduction in the number of ships was made, and at least one ship remained in Kuwait until the 4th Jane. The Royal Air Force detachments were finally withdrawn at the end of May. The Shaikh of Kuwait was allowed to purchase two machine guns and three Lewis guns, but these did not arrive until after the menace was over. Visits. Captain H. G. C. Franklin, R. N., Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf arrived in Kuwait in H. M. S. 'Emerald' on 23rd January and left on 30th January. He was again in Kuwait from the 17th February until the 4th April. Captain G. S. H. R. V. de Gaury, Essex Regiment attached Royal Air Force, Special Service Officer, Basrah, visited Kuwait on the 2nd Feb ruary and again on the 9th February. From the 2nd March until the 3rd May he was on duty in Kuwait as Special Service Officer. Squadron Leader A. H. Peck, D.S.O, M.C., R.A.F., visited Kuwait from the 16th to the 21st February. Air Vice Marshal Sir Edward L. Ellington, K.C.B., C.M.G., C .B.E,, Air Officer Commanding in 'Iraq, visited Kuwait by air on 25th February, accflmpanied by Colonel W.

A s stated above an air base was temporarily established at Kuwait from the end of February until the end of May, during which period aero planes and armoured cars, etc., were continually present in varying num bers. On 10th December two seaplanes arrived from Basrah and alighted on the Bay. As the sea was very choppy, however, they deemed it unwise to stay and returned almost immediately. C ivil A viation. Messrs. Vincent and Newall arrived in Kuwait in two aeroplanes on the 19th April and returned to Basrah on the 21st. During their stay they took people pleasure flights at Rs. 10 each, and a large number availed themselves of the opportunity. An Imperial Airways aeroplane, chartered by Mr. Rosenthal the pearl merchant to take him from Shu'aibah Aerodrome to Bahrain, landed at Kuwait to pick up passengers on the 3l3t August, and again on its return gn the 1st September. i , ,69 Pearl Fishery. Tiie Kuwait Pearling Fleet, which only consisted of a little over three hundred boats, was later than usual in leaving for the banks and less than half had sailed by the end of May. It returned on the 23rd September. A few boats had participated in the preliminary dive, and a few boats re turned to the. batiks after the main dive was over, but these were not very successful. The season on the whole was a good one, the catch being the best there has been for several years. The banks to the north of latitude 27 proved to be the best, particularly those known as Baldani, Abu Dhalam and Abu Khalalu to the east of Ras Mish'ab. Locusts. Flights of locusts in the early spring resulted in a very serious pl a gue of locusts in the hopping stage during the latter part of April, which did a great deal of damage to the market gardens and grazing. Postal Arrangements. With effect from the 1st May a motor mail service was established between Kuwait and Zubair under contract with the Kuwait-'Iraq Motor Transport Company There is at present a service three days a week m each direction. Mails to and from India and beyond are now sent by this service, which connects with the Fast Mail steamer at Basrah, a bag being also made up for Bushire. Medical. There were no epidemics during the year, and the health of the pop 11 , lation was satisfactory on the whole. Tuberculosis, diseases of the eyes and ears and abdominal diseases were the most prevalent, the hrst namecl accounting for a large proportion of the deaths amongst adults, and tne last named for those amongst children. There is no satisfactory hygiene amongst the inhabitants. In the Charitable Dispensary only out-patients were treated and minor operations performed. Altogether 9,471 out-patients were treated, as com pared with 8.103 in 1927. These included 2,070 women and 3,159 children. At the American Mission Hospital 2,046 out-patients were treated in the men's side, and 4,333 in the women's. 486 surgical operations were performed; and 332 patients were received into the wards. Meteorology. The summer of 1928 was abnormally hot for Kuwait, particularly dur- ing the latter part of June and in July, the thermometer reaching 123 F. on one occasion, and being frequently above 120°. 6 22 inches of rain fell during the year of which 3-69 inches were in the first three and a half months. No rain fell from the middle of Apn until the beginning of November, but 2-53 inches fell during the month o November, which Is when it is most wanted, so the prospects of a good spring in 1929 are extremely good. American Mission. t , pv v p. and Mrs. Calverley and their three children were in Kuwait throughout the year; as also was their Canadian governess. Miss Robertson, except for three months during the summer when she was on a holiday in Persia.70 Miss Van Peit was also present throughout the year, except for a three months' holiday in Persia in summer. Dr. C. S. G. Mylrea, O.B.E., and Mrs. Mylrea were present from the beginning of the year until the 26th March, when they left for Europe and the United States on long vacation. Rev. G. and Mrs. De Jong and Miss De Young (second year language students) were in Kuwait from the beginning of the year until November, except for a period of three months on the Lebanon in summer. On pass ing their final examinations in November, Mr. and Mrs. De Jong were post ed to Kuwait, and Miss De Young left for Basrah. Dr. and Mrs. Storm (first year language students) were in Kuwait from the beginning of the year until November, and Dr. (Miss) Tiffany from 9th Eebruary, when she joined the Mission. In November all three were trans ferred to Bahrain. Dr. P. Harrison, whose permanent station is now Matrah, was in Kuwait from the 11th August until the 30th September. Several members of the American Mission from other stations attended their Annual Meeting which was held in Kuwait in the beginning of November. A son was born to Rev. G. and Mrs De Jong on 8th December. Exchange. The rate of exchange for the Maria Theresa dollar averaged Rs. 128-0-5 per hundred dollars. It was highest in April at Rs. 131-3-0, and lowest in December at Rs. 125-7-0. British sovereigns and Turkish pounds averaged Rs. 13-6-2 and Rs. 11-14-11 respectively. J. C.

Foreign Rep res en t a tiv es. French Consulate.— Monsieur Luis Lucas held charge throughout the year. The French Consul here has little to do. A 7 orwegian Vice-Consulate.-— The Political Resident, the Hon'ble Sir Frederick Johnston, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., J.C.S., held charge, till the 28th April. The question of further charge has been referred to H. B. M.'s Minister, Tehran.. lc114FD2 Russian Consulate-General.—• The Russian Consul-General, Shiraz, M. Batmanoff, came to Bushire in September and stayed in the Eussian Consulate for a week. Again, in October, the Russian Vice-Consul, Shiraz, visited Bushire for a few days. During the rest of the year ' The Russian Traders for the East, Bushire ' who occupied the Russian Consulate continued to act as News Agents to the Consul-General, Shiraz. Dutch Consulate.— The French Consul remained in charge throughout the year. German Consulate.— The Consulate remained closed during the year, but the e^-German Consul, Herr Wassmuss, continued to look after German interests un-officially. S ection 3. Local Government. 1. Governor of the Gulf Ports, Islands, Dashti and Dashtistan. —His Excel lency Aqa Muzaffar Khan Alam, Sardar-i-Intisar, held the appointment throughout the year. He is an energetic tactful and popular administrator, and his relations with the Consulate-General—at a time when dealings with the Persian Authorities present no little difficulty—have been satisfactory and he has always been ready to assist it as far as he can. The fact that he is fluent in French, German, Arabic and Turkish, has had considerable experience of Europe, is an e^-military Officer of high rank, and has seen much civil and mili tary service in North Persia, endows him with a breadth of view rare in Pro- viucial Persian Governors. He is a hard worker and does not shrink from arduos, not to say dangerous touring. During the recent disarmament campaign of the tribes in Tangistan he has frequently visited the scene of operations. He is, however, somewhat hampered in his work by the fact that the heads of the local Departments—Military, Police, Finance, Customs and Justice,—act inde pendently of him, taking their orders direct from Tehran. His Excellency continued to take interest in Municipal affairs ; some bazars have been widened, and roads improved. The Assistant Governor, Aqa Muhammad Ali Sadid as Sultanah, Kababi, was suddently called to Tehran in April and placed under arrest. The exact nature of the charge has never come to light, but is believed to be political- At the close of the year he was still in Tehran. 2. Officer Commanding, Troops. —Yawar Muhammad Taqi Khan Arab re mained in charge till the 15th June when he left for Shiraz, having been appoint ed Military Governor of Lar. He has since been promoted to Sartip (Brigadier General). . 1 ^ 1 Yawar Qasim Khan Wajdani assumed charge from 10th July. His rela tions with the Consulate-General have been gopd, although he lacks the courage and independence of character possessed by his predecessor Yawar Taqi Khan Arab. 3. Finance Department.—Ks stated in last year's report, the anti-British official Abdullah Khan Munajjami held charge so long as Nusrat-ed-Doulah Firuze Mirza held the portfolio of Finance at Tehran. But soon after the arrest of Firuze Mirza Abdullah Khan Munajjami was summoned to Tehran to answer certain charges of embezzlement and he left on the loth May. He is said to have been dismissed from Government service. Temporary arrangements were made for some weeks. Shahzadeh Wali Muhammad Mirza Bouban, Director of Customs, holding additional charge. Mirza Husain Khan Mushiri, however, arrived on transfer from Seistan and assumed charge of the appointment on the 20th September. He is a friend of Colonel Biscoe who knew him at Meshed. 4. Police Department. —Yawar Hasan Quli Khan Biyat remained in charge throughout the year. He is a capable officer and keeps his men in order. This is an important desidemtum as it is chiefly from the Police that British subjects, with the abolition of the Capitulations, may expect trouble. At the close of the year, Police Stations were established at most of the small ports of the Persian Coastjf ■5. Customs Department. —Shahzadeh Wali Muhammad Mirza Bouban Mirza l omamed hi charge till the 26th October, when he was transferred to the Finance .Ministry at Tehran, being relieved by Monsieur Paul Wolters (Belgian) as Lfrfactorv Customs. His relations with the Consulate-General were 4 B ^ gian) re m aine d Inspector-General of Customs for the Southern Ports till February, when he proceeded on leave to Belgium and Monsieur M olters officiated m the appointment.

There have as yet been no cases of any importance in the Courts involving British subjects. It is impossible therefore to say how the Judicial safeguards work irpfactrce 16 accompanied the surrender of the Capitulations, will^ 8. Health and Quarantine Department.—Doctor Abul Qasim Bahrami a pleasant individual, whose qualifications as a medical man however are not verv apparent, held charge throughout the year. He is more interested in bacteriology than m operations, which are seldom performed, and in serious cases people refer to the Eesidency or I. E. T. D. Doctors. Doctor Bahrami has been supplied J a quarantine Launch ' Bin Sina and his quarantine arrangements so far as this Residency is concerned, have been satisfactory.

Gulf Ports from Military Service and offeringTheZe^ves for tt Cy^T'' Governor, fearing demonstrations similar to those in Shiraz, supported The4 request. In the meanwhile the Qashqai rising had commenced in Fars, and Tehran therefore sent orders closing the Recruiting Depot from the 17th March and the Recruiting Officer Naib Sarhang Ahmad Khan returned to Shiraz. 12. Arnniyah {Road Guards). —S-arhang Muhammad Husain Jahanbani, Chief of Staff, Amniyah, arrived at Bushire from Tehran on the 12th April and returned to Tehran after reorganizing the Amniyah guards on the Bushire- Shiraz road. These, however, did not prove efficient, as the road remained un safe throughout the summer and security was not restored till the arrival of the Expeditionary Force in November. Aviation. —Sartip Ahmad Khan Nakhjawan, Staff Officer, Aviation, Army Headquarters, Tehran, arrived at Bushire from Tehran to inspect the aero dromes in the Gulf Ports. He returned to Tehran after visiting Bushire and Jask. Navy. —Major D. N. Dezan and Captain P. L. Del Prato of the Italian Naval Mission to Persia arrived at Bushire in April and returned to Tehran via Mohammerah. Up to the close of the year the new Persian fleet advertised in the Persian newspapers had not yet materialised. In November about 1,500 troops of the Fouj-i-Nadiri with grins and two armoured cars arrived in the Bushire district under the command of Sarhang Ahmad Khan Moini in order to disarm the population of Dashtistan, Tangistan and Dashti. In December 400 more troops of the Fars Brigade arrived from Shiraz to augment the Bushire garrison which with this addition comes to about 760. By the end of December the Expedition had collected about 2,000 rifles from Borazjun and Tangistan. Half of Tangistan and Dashti which is preparing to put up a resistance, still remain to be tackled. The Dashtis can put 8,000 men into the field, if wanted, an unlikely contingency. S ection 5. 'Aviation. N ew A ir R outes. I. Germ an. —The German Company ' Junkers ' Air Mail, two days-a week r between Bushjre, Shiraz, Isfahan and Tehran, (under contract with the Persian Government) maintained a regular and very efficient service throughout the year. Junkers have had no serious accident since the commencement of the Service in April 1928. Their method of working is thorough and they have the confidence of the public. The Junkers service is now extending throughout Persia. During the summer when the Bushire-Shiraz road was insecure, and telegraph lines were out and Shiraz was beseiged, the Junkers service was the only means of communication between Bushire and Tehran. In addition to passengers the machines carried loaf sugar to Shiraz and brought opium to Bushire, as well as silver bullion. Junkers intend to introduce shortly^ bigger machines for passengers and goods. II. British.— {a) The Royal A.ir Force. —Several machines of the Royal Air Force passed through Persia en route from Basrah to Karachi. On the 8th .March Machine J.-8929 on its way from India to Basrah was forced to land at Galag Bandar near Rapch river 90 miles east of Jask. It was a complete wreck but no lives were lost. {b) The Imperial Airways. —The Imperial Airways, Ltd., started their ser vice between London and India in the Spring, and their first machine ' City of Baghdad ' arrived from Basrah on the 23rd March and left for Karachi via Lingah, Charbar and Jask. Since then they have maintained a fairly regular weekly Mail service, although sometimes a day or two late, owing to bad weather conditions in Europe. On the 5th September the ' City of Jerusalem ' on its way to India, crashed on landing after dark at Jask, and was destroyed by fire. One Passenger and one Imperial Airways staff were burnt to death. The pilot, Mr. Woodbridge, displayed the greatest heroism in rescuing passengers from the buriling machine and died as the result of injuries received in the course of his efforts to save others. The others escaped with injuries. III. Dutch.—The Dutch Royal Air Service. —The Dutch Royal Air Service between Amsterdam and Batavia has been run during the year with success and no accidents are reported. The French Consul looks after the service in Bushire.S ection 6. Arrivals. Sir Robert Clive, K.C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plempotentiarv at the Court of Persia, accompanied by his Secre tary, Sir Charles Hartopp, Kt., arrived at Bushire by Air from Tehran, on the 23rd October and left next evening on board H. M. S. ' Triad ' on a visit to Bandar Abbas, Henjam, Kuweit and Mohammerah. He returned to Tehran via Khuzistan. S ection 7. Political Situation. The Government measures. —The new Dress Regulations,—Compulsory Conscription, and Disarming are bitterly resented and opposed by the^ tribal elements. There was a general revolt among the tribes of Southern Persia, and throughout the year the Persian army was busily engaged in trying to put it down. Imam Quli Khan, leader of the Rustam clan of Memasani, had hardly ended his campaign by practically dictating terms to Government in January, when the Qashqais and Qawam's tribes of the eastern Fars rose, cut off com munications and beseiged Shiraz. There was also trouble in Khuzistan, and in the Bakhtiari country. Although beyond a little trouble in Borazjun, there was no rebellion in the Bushire District, and the Tangistanis were fighting among themselves, there was a danger that active disaffection might spread to Tang- istan and Dashti, and to save the situation the Governor and the Officer Com manding were frequently on the move in the district. The Persian troops failed to gain a victory over the Qashqais, and the Government had to make a com promise granting most of the terms of All Khan. The operations did not in crease the prestige of the military, but the tribes seem to have realized that Reza Shah is determined to enforce his will upon them. On the whole it may be said that the Government was partially successful, and at the end of the vear disturbances elsewhere had been suppressed to such an extent that it could' send about 2,000 troops to disarm Tangistan and Dashti. The people generally are suffering from economic pressure. While modern ways of life have raised the cost of living, there are no new sources of income, and poverty, therefore, is on the increase amongst the masses, and with it some discontent with the present regime. Reza Shah is feared but he is certainly not popular and is criticised in private for being a Dictator who has usurped the powers of the Constitution. Owing to Passport and other difficulties arising out of the Persia's claim to the Arab Coast, traffic between the Persian and Arab Coasts has been reduced to a minimum. S ection 8. Trade and Trade Facilities. 1 Trade. —From a commercial point of view the year 1929 must be reckoned a black one in the annals of Southern Persia. Despite a comparatively good harvest and a subsequent fall in the price of _ grain, the bazars remained dnll and inactive throughout the period. This evil state of affairs was pnmai ily due to the closing of the Shiraz road in late spring and throughout the summer owino- to the Qashgai revolt. Bushire was thereby isolated from Upper Persia and her merchants suffered from the locking up of their capital in goods 'which they could no longer forward to Shiraz or Isfahan for sale. But the root of the malady lav deeper as the latter months were to show. Increasing taxation (characterised in 1929 by the imposition of a Tobacco Monopoly Tax anxi an enhanced dutv on exported opium) still further affected the purchasing power of the country and money was even tighter than in 1928. &gt; Meanwhile extensive Government expenditure abroad, together with the failure to return tne A. P. 0. C. Rovalties into circulation was already affecting the Kran Exchange in the summer' In the Autumn months came the fall in the price of silver and the New York Stock Exchange crisis with its repercussions on Persian Exports of carpets, gums, and guts. As a result the Kran sterling late, o3 m Maich, soared up to 62.2 in the latter part of November and great damage was done to trade. Merchants either refused to accept their bills or were compelled to foresro their profits. Complaints became loud against the economic policy ot the Government, and especially the project of the Trans-Persian Railna}, which is of necessity unpopular in Bushire, whose decline it presupposes. Ine general feeling of the Bushiri is that the Pahlevi regime would do well to leave LclUFD6 economics strictly alone and it does indeed appear that the Central Government lias yet to learn the rudiments of political economy. If the year proved bad for things Persian, it had no better complexion from the point of view of British and Indian trade. Russian competition which had been foreshadowed in 1928, materialised in the visits of 5 Russian steamers io Bushire. As a result the piece-goods trade of Bushire, Shiraz and Isfahan passed almost wholly over to Moscow. Indeed, so cheap, so attractive, and so fastly dyed are the Russian cottons that the British product has been rivalled' in quality as well as defeated in price. The Russians had, in addition, by the end of the year secured a temporary monopoly of the sugar trade^ by a policy. of dumping. Although they grant extensive credits (2-3 months) in nearly all their sales, and although their goods are popular, their habit of undercutting, the local trader renders them unsatisfactory to deal with and personally un popular with the merchants. That their commerce is based on political rather, than economic motives is as true as ever and is thoroughly appreciated by the Bushiri. The Russians, whose steamers unloaded little but sugar and piece-goods, were not competitors in tea, and the market remained much as in 1928. It is, however, probable that the Customs statistics will show a falling off in imports of this commodity owing to the general economic situation. 2. Communications. —Means of communication have improved. Motor transport has been plentiful throughout the twelve month and Bushire is served by Imperial Airways, while the Junkers Air Service from Tehran is now bi-weekly in each direction. Both these latter services arrived on the whole regularly, though the Imperial Airways Service was often behind schedule. Motor transport was, however, immobilized for a period of 3-4 months by the Qashgai revolt and for a further period of one month by the damage caused to the Shiraz road by rain. As a result of the excess of transport in Bushire rates of hire fell even lower than in 1928 (T. 130 per Kharvar to Shiraz was quoted in April) and^ the fact that the North Persian market was already overstocked with motor vehicles ultimately led to heavy reshipments from this port. Animal transport preserved its precarious existence and came into its own again in December when the road was closed to motors. None the less there can be little doubt that the heritage of the camel, mule and donkey will in a few years time pass wholly to the motor, provided always that the present roads are not allowed to deteriorate. Little or no work was done to the Shiraz road and the track across the Mashileh remained as bad as ever. The journey to Shiraz by motor, now occu pying from 2-8 days could probably be shortened to 12 hours if a real attempt were'made to metal and regrade the kotals.. .Such an attempt appears highly improbable and until it comes, however, many motors are available, the ameni ties of transport will remain much as they are now. 3. Security, —The word ' Security ' has a bitter ring when applied to the Bushire district in 1929. Suffice to say that from May-July the Qashgai revolt disturbed the whole of Southern Persia and closed the Bushire-Shiraz road to all transport. Minor disturbances followed the settlement of the Qashgai ques tion and during the autumn months robberies were frequent in the neighbour hood of Borasjun, nor could the road be said to have become safe when the year went out. 4. Smuggling. —In the early part of the year smuggling was rife, and the Customs Preventive Service seemed unable to control matters. Later with the rise in the foreign exchange and the approach of winter a necessary decrease ensued and little was heard of the activities of smugglers in Bushire itself. 5. Postal Facilities. —These have improved. The bi-weekly Junkers aero plane service lias rendered communication with Shiraz, Isfahan and Tehran rapid and frequent, while Imperial Airways provide similar facilities between Bushire, Karachi, Basrah and~ Baghdad, though only once a week. The Persian Government maintain a motor postal service between 'Bushire and the North and mails leave three times a week. This service of necessity ceased to function when the Shiraz road was closed. The British India Steamers have not changed their service in any way. 6. Foreign Commercial Enterprise. —The outstanding foreign commercial enterprise is the Junker's Air Service. This service, worked by single engined all metal monoplanes and possessing little or no ground organisation, main tains a connection between Bushire, Shiraz, Isfahan and Tehran in all but the7 severest weather. As from the month of March the service was thrown open to all kinds of freight and newer and larger aeroplanes capable of lifting np to 2|3rds of a ton of merchandise were introduced. The new machines had in addition accommodation for upwards of seven passengers. Messrs. Junkers brought down several valuable loads of opium from Shiraz, and in the latter half of the year seats were only procurable with difficulty. The service is de servedly popular and is increasingly utilised for passengers and goods. The Hansa Line preserved their monthly sailings to the Gulf. They have an arrange ment wtih Messrs. Junkers whereby through bills of lading from any German town to any Persian town disserved by the Air lines, can be obtained. The Kussian Steamship Company maintained an irregular service and 5 steamers called during the year. There is no sign of Russian enterprise slacken ing off and it is possible that the strange methods of the Russian trader are more economic than would appear. The State trader can afford a heavy loss on the roundabouts, while his gains upon the swings may take place in a very different part of the world. A Dutch Air Service to the Dutch East Indies made a number of trial flights through Bu shire. They carried only mails. Herr Wassmus spent but little of his time in Chaghadak, dividing his acti vities between Tehran and Bushire itself. It is believed that his farming venture yielded little profit during the year and it was rumoured that he was endeavouring to sell out and leave. 7. National Bank. —The National Bank of Persia, which is German staffed, opened its Bushire Branch on February 17th. It has 2 German Officials and a small staff of local munshis. At first a policy of cut-throat competition was fol- lowed and much propaganda was spread abroad. Later in the year the new bank was less active. Although the I. B. P. is sensible of the competition caused by the presence of a second bank in so small a community, the deposit accounts of the British institution stand as high as ever. It seems that the Bushiri has not thought fit to transfer his confidence to an institution so savouring of con nection with the government. It is doubtful whether the Bushire Branch of the new bank has paid its way so far, and it is generally believed that the Persian Government itself pays all salaries. 8. Opium. —The year 1929 presented circumstances favourable to a large export of Persian opium, since the Turkish crop was a failure. As a result 6,812 cases were exported from Bushire as opposed to 4,730 in 1928. Opium production would therefore appear to be but little affected by the working of the Opium Monopoly Service. None the less the weak-kneed policy of the government is to be deplored. No attempt has been made to control the export of illicit opium, while on the other hand the vexatious restrictions of the Monopoly Service cannot but hamper the^ cultivator. The export tax per case was raised to Tomans 275 and is to be raised to Tomans 400 in 1930. In addi tion a scheme for placing the export pf opium in the hands of a Persian Syndi cate headed by the firms of Kazerooni and Behbehani had a shortlived existence in the summer. It is difficult to see where the capital necessary to purchase the whole Persian opium crop with would come from, but rumours persist that this scheme is not yet moribund. All these changes and counter-schemes inevitably exercise a disturbing effect on the trade and the Government might be wise to meddle less with this valuable crop. Of the cases exported 2,528 were for unlicensed consumption as opposed to 2,380 in 1928. The very flagrant case of opium smuggling occurred in connec tion with the S. S. ' Times Maru ' and it is to be regretted that greater pub licity cannot be given to the importance of Bushire as a smuggling centre. S ection 9. Slavery.

Note on the worhing of the Residency Dispensary, Bushire, for the year 1929. Lieutenant-Colonel A. N. Dickson, M.C., was in charge from January 1st to November 7th, 1929, on which date, prior to proceeding on leave, he handed over to Major H. J. H. Symons, M.C., l.M.S,, who held charge until the end of the year. Assistant Surgeon M. L. A. Steele, I.M.D., was in sub-charge of the dis pensary throughout the year and Jemedar Mohammed Ali Najmi was in sub- charge of the Out-patient Department throughout the year. The number of patients admitted as in-patients after February 9th was 54, and the number of out-patient attendances during the same period was 9,230. It is valueless to make any comparison of these figures with those of the previous year as the Residency Dispensary was removed from the Bushire Charitable Hospital to the Town Residency at the beginning of February and its statistics in previous years were always included in those of the larger institution. Con sequently from February 9th onwards the Residency Dispensary dealt only with the sick of the Residency Staff and their families, the employees and their fami lies of the Imperial Bank of Persia and the three European firms, the Mesopo tamia Persia Corporation, Messrs. Ziegler and Company and Messrs. A. and T. J. Malcolm. The disease causing the greatest number of attendances was Malaria, the most prevalent local cause of illness. In September 1928 the Rais-i-Malieh, at that time the Acting Governor of Bushire, verbally informed the Residency Surgeon that the Charitable Hospital should be handed over to the Persian authorities and shortly afterwards the Customs Department withdrew their contribution to the Hospital and directed those of their employees who fell sick to go to a Dispensary which had been instituted in the Customs House and which was staffed by Persian Doctors. Shortly after this the Post Office and Finance Department withdrew their con tribution and their sick in a similar manner. The Shahi voluntary tax which was the source of 50 per cent, of the Hospital's income had been systematically underlevied for some time and \\ab not paid at all during the last three months of 1928. There is no doubt that this was part of a system to cause embarrassment to the British connection with the Hospital and with bankruptcy impending and after some two mo'nths correspondence the British connection with the Charit able Hospital which had extended over a period of some 60 years was finally severed on February 9th at a general meeting of the Committee under the chair manship of Sir Frederick Johnston, at which the Committee accepted the resigna tions of the Consul-General as President and the Residency Surgeon as Secre- tary. The medical charge thereupon devolved on Dr. Bahrami, the Persian Chief Quarantine Medical Officer. At present Dr. Bahrami and his Assistant Dr. Ali Khan carry out the medical work. At one visit paid by the Residency Surgeon (m January 1930) at the request of the Governor of Bushire and in the absence on tour of Dr. Bahrami, it was noted that the Hospital was not conspicuously clean and that Dr. All Khan's learning was not of a very high order, m fact not even of mediocre standard. Considerable alterations and repairs have recently been carried out and externally, at any rate, the appearance of the Hospital has improved. On the withdrawal of the Residency Dispensary to the Town Residency from the Charitable Hospital the stock of medicines and surgical equipment was divided into two halves, one-half of which was removed to the Residency Dis- nensarv The operating theatre equipment is thus very incomplete arid there Fs little with which to deal with any serious emergency. Application has been made for essential instruments and it is hoped that the sum asked for will be forthcoming during 1930.11 CHAPTER II. bote on events in the Mishun Area during the year 1929. even^oMmDort^pp ^ Q 1111 rev ^ e w there have been no outstanding Limited.

CHAPTER III. Summary of Events and Conditions in Ears during the year ended March 31st, 1930. The abolition by the Central Government in March, 1929, of the Qawam-ul- Mulk's hereditary governorship over eastern Fars (Fasa, Darab, Lar, Sab'eh, and the small Gulf Ports north of Lingeh) and the Khamseh 'Arab tribes was effected right at the end of the previous year (March 1929). Its consequences became apparent at the very beginning of the year under review. The Qawam himself, surmising that his people would object to the change and that he would be suspected of fomenting them, promptly asked for leave to quit Persia. He went to Berlin, Paris and London, etc., and is now understood to have settled down in Bey rout, where his sons are completing their education. His foresight was justified : had he stayed in the country he would undoubtedly have shared with Saulat-ud-Dauleh the unpleasant experience of incarceration in a Tehran dungeon. 2. While the Qawam was on his, way to Europe, Sartip Abul Hasan Khan Zandieh, who had been appointed Military Governor of Fasa, Darab, Lar and the Khamseh Arab tribes arrived at Shiraz. Like the Qawam, he suspected that the people of his new Govemorate would not be well disposed towards, the new regime which he represented. He therefore asked Sartip Muhammad Khan Shahbakhti, Officer Commanding the Pars Independent Brigade, to give him an escort of 300 soldiers. This request Sartip Shahbakhti refused, and when the writer arrived at Shiraz in May the two Sartips were still at loggerheads^ Meantime the Qawain's men were not idle. The Khamseh Arab tribes, among whom the Baharlus were the outstanding element, in alliance with the people of Lar and Sarkuh and with the approbation of the settled population in Darab and Fasa, rose against the Persian Government. They drove the Persian Government officials out of Darab at the end of April, and advanced on Fasa, which they took on May 9th. 4, Sartip Abul Hasan Khan left Shiraz -with a small force on May 12th and proceeded to Fasa which he retook ; but shortly afterwards, the rebels rallied, and he was surrounded and besieged in Fasa. Sartip Shahbakhti with a large force went out from Shiraz to relieve him. Together they re-established order in Fasa for a time : but Darafb and Lar remained in the hands of the rebels. When the troops returned to Shiraz, the Baharlus again advanced on Fasa, which they retook on June 25th. Soon after they took Niriz and Istahbanat and began to approach Shiraz by two lines, via Sarvistan which they occupied on July 41 h, and via Kharameh which they took and few days earlier ; but they got no further, for at this juncture Sartip Abul Hasan Khan was recalled and Yavar Muhammad Taqi Khan Arab appointed Governor of Fasa and Lar. He left Shiraz with 1,000 men on July 30th and advanced towards Fasa, sometimes negotiating and sometimes, fighting. With the help of his influence over the Khamseh 'Arab tribes he was able to reach Fasa on August 12th. He was re inforced there by 700 men on August 21st. Early in September he advanced towards Darab, which he occupied after defeating a Baharlu force. The Baharlus then appealed to the rebels of the Sarkuh district for assistance, but the combined forces were caught between Yavar Muhammad Taqi Khan's army and a body of reinforcements newly arriving from Shiraz and suffered a severe defeat. Sheikh Has ( san Sarkuhi fled, but most of his followers surrendered. The Baharlus also tendered their submission. Later, in the winter, troops were sent to Lar itself and re-established Government authority there ; schools are being opened, taxes collected, and the rebels of yesterday are adopting Pahlavi hats and new style clothes, 5. The Government might have dealt with the rebellion in eastern Fars more promptly if they had not been engaged elsewhere. Unfortunately for them, the Qasjiqai tribes, alarmed by reports that Sultan 'Abbas Khan, the oppressive Military Governor who had fleeced them with a very heavy hand, had been re appointed, and that the Government intended to number and tax their sheep, deprive them of their rifles, and make them settle down in villages in northern Fars, broke out in revolt under the leadership of 'Ali Khan, the Saulat-ud- Danlah's half brother. The Saulat himself who was in Tehran, was promptly put into gaol by the Persian Government, who kept him in a damp cell too low to allow a person to stand upright in it. Nasir Khan, the Saulat's eldest son, was also kept in Tehran j but Malik Mansur Khan, the second spii, a scholar13 at the American College at Tehran, hastened to join the tribes and won the hearts of all by his gallantry and daring. 6. The imminence of a Qashqai outbreak caught the Persian Government officials in Fars unprepared and with divided counsels. The Grovernor-General, Prince Akbar Mirza Mas'ud, Sarim-ud-Dauleh, belieVed that the military forces in the province were insufficient to overawe the tribes, that no fresh forces could be obtained from Tehran, and that it was therefore imperative to temporise. He had a conference with Ali Khan, the Qashqai leader, early in May, and Received the tribesmen's demands, which included the release of the Saulat, recognition of Saulat or one of his sons as Ilkhani, no disarmament and no conscription. These were quite unacceptable to the Government, which accepted Sartip Shahbakhti's view that the Qashqais must be coerced without accepting the obvious implication that sufficient force must be provided to coerce them. The tribes migrating north, reached the immediate vicinity of Shiraz before anything had been done to appease or oppose them. In the early morning of June 4th the Qashqais closed the Bushire road and cut the telegraph wires. Two days later they blocked the road to Isfahan and cut the telegraph lines there also. Shiraz was isolated. 7. The isolation of Shiraz at last woke up the Central Government to the realisation that something serious was happening. The Amir Laslikar Habib- ullah Khan Shaibani was sent down from Tehran to take s ( upreme ^ charge of affairs in the province, both military and civil. He was met at Pul-i-Khan, 28 miles out of Shiraz, by a large escort and 2 armoured cars, but even so had difficulty in fighting his way into Shiraz against the opposition of the Qashqais, who were holding the hills on both sides of the road. He was lucky to receive fresh reinforcements from Shiraz who opened the road momentarily and brought him in on the night of June 6th losing over 50 men in the operation. The same night the Qas.hqais made a night attack on the aerodrome, which was guarded by a strong military detachment, and disabled two military aeroplanes. On June 9th, 10th and ilth there was heavy fighting at Chinar Eahdar, only 4 miles west of Shiraz, which the Qashqais took only to be driven out again by a counter attack. The military followed up this success by advancing towards Deh Sheikh, but lost so many men that they were glad to retreat to Chinar Rahdar again. The Amir Lashkar's first action when this lull in the fight gave him a momentary respite was to get the Governor-General recalled to Tehran, together with Sartip Fazlullah Khan Zahidi, the Officer Commanding, Eoad- Guards, throughout Persia, and Sartip Muhammad Hussein Mirza, son of the Par man Parma, thereby reducing from 5 to 3 the number of Generals in Shiraz. Sarim-ud-Dauleh and the two Generals were accused of wilfully concealing from the Shah the serious situation in Fars, and of being concerned with Prince Firuz, the Minister of Finance, in a Qajar plot to overthrow Reza Shah with the help of the tribes. They were also accused of being too friendly with certain foreign elements, 'i.e., the British. Sarim-ud-Dauleh had in fact been very friendly with Mr. Chick, H. M.'s Consul at Shiraz, and had _ asked his opinion on the tribal situation ; but the suggestion that he was working with the British against the Pahlavi regime was of course absurd, as was the suggestion made in Tehran that the British were supporting the tribes by supplying (or alowing them to be supplied) with arms and ammunition^ The popular rumour that Mr. Chick, instead of going on leave, had remained in Persia and, dressed as a dervish, was directing the movements of the tribes, was still more^ lacking in verisimilitude ; while the writer's request that guards should be provided for the houses of British residents in exposed situations outside the town was mis construed as an alarmist attitude designed to inspire lack of confidence in the Persian Government's, power to deal with the situation. Out of such scanty materials a supposed Qajar plot with British support was invented ; and on the charge of being implicated in it Sarim-ud-Dauleh was placed under open arrest, Sartip Muhammad Hussein Mirza Firuzi was disgraced, and Sartip Fazlullah Khan Zahidi was deprived of his rank and employment. 9. Meanwhile, after the Amir Lashkar had fought his way into Shiraz, the Government troops were left barely holding the crest of the hills just north of the town. Military and Road-Guard pos.ts on the Isfahan road were left to their own devices. The Amnieh post at Ab-i-barik near Zarqan was overcome and disarmed by the Qashqais. The post of 50 soldiers at Pul-i-Khan, 28 miles out of Shiraz, was attacked by night, and Malik Mansur Khan with a ba ad ot Darashuris rushed the post, killed the garrison to a man, and damaged -he important bridge so that motor vehicle^ could not cross it. LeIUPD14 10. The approach of Muharram brought a lull in the struggle, both sides having agreed to a truce for the period of the mourning observances. After the truce, the military authorities succeeded in reopening the Isfahan road about the end of June ; and to introduce disunion among the Qashqais an amnesty was proclaimed to all who would cease resistance. Very few Khans accepted the! offer, but under cover of the amnesty some envoys came in to negotiate. The Persian Government unable to overcome the Qashqais by force of arms decided to make s.ome concessions. They released the Saulat-ud-Bauleh from hig dungeon in Tehran and sent him to Shiraz by aeroplane on July 10th. He went out to Ardakan two days later to interview the Khans. The same day a forcor of 1,200 men left to reopen the Bushire rOad, accompanied by 300 Road-Guards to hold the posts on the road and 200 workmen to repair the bridges, etc., wrecked by the rebels. This party was not opposed. The road was open all the way from Shiraz to Bushire by the end of July. 11. There is no doubt that the Persian Government's, decision to make terms with the Qashqais was hastened by the Bakhtiari rising which broke out in the middle of July and which found the Isfahan province almost denuded of troops. Sartip Shahbakhti left Shiraz with a large body of reinforcements on July 17th to take part in the Bakhtiari campaign. He did not return to Shiraz. Early in 1930 he wag replaced as Officer Commanding the Fars Independent Brigade by Sartip 'Ali Shah Khan, formerly C. C. troops in Kerman. The Sartip has little power, however, while the Amir Lashkar Shaibani remains in the province with full powers, military and civil, over all the south. 12. After the recall and disgrace of H. H. Prince Akbar Mirza Mas'uct (Sarim-ud-Dauleh) no new Governor-General of Fars was appointed. For a time Ghulam Ali Khan Arbabi, Director of Posts and Telegraphs, was Acting Governor-General. He was recalled to Tehran on July 9th. Mahmud Khan Ghaffari was then sent down from Tehran as Assistant Governor General, while the Amir Lashkar exercised all the powers and functions of the Governor- General (drawing the salary included). Neither Habibullah Khan Shaibani nor Mahmud Khan Ghaffari had any direct relations with the Acting Consul or members of the British community during 1929 or the first two months of 1930. They doubtless kept in mind the troubles which had befallen Sarim-ud-Dauleh on account of his alleged friendliness with the English. 13. With the release of Saulat-ud-Dauleh, a policy of ' laissez faire ' was inaugurated as between the Government and the Qashqais. No peace was made, no settlement was negotiated. The fighting gradually stopped as the more bellicose Khans came under the Saulat's influence or realised that there was nothing to be gained by continuing. Also the Qashqais had exhausted their reserve of ammunition. ^ The Saulat, though not appointed Ilkhani, exercised all the powers of the Ilkhani. He organised the southward migration, which passed off with no more than minor breaches of the peace. He also arranged for the collection of the Qashqais' taxes, and a Persian Finance Official accompanied the tribes to their winter quarters and collected the revenue under the Saulat's eye, thus avoiding the exactions and extortions which had antagonised the Qashqais under the military governorship of Sultan Abbas Khan. At the end of the year under review, i.e., in March 1930, the Qashqais were quiet and peaceful everywhere ; nor do they have any idea of fighting this summer unless the Persian Government attempts to carry out its declared intention of disarming them. They lost so many young children and so much live stock last year, especially those sections which had to stay in the li garmsir ' (hot country) all through the summer, that they want time to recuperate before beginning the struggle again. Also they are still short of ammunition. 14. The Khamseh and Qashqai troubles being settled, Fars was at peace once more except for the depredations of the Boir Ahmadi tribe, which plundered unchecked as far afield as the Baiza district north-west of Shiraz and the Semiran district west of Qumisheh. They even crossed the Shiraz-Is ( fahan road near Abadeh and robbed villages in the west of the Yezd district. Their merciless barbarity horrified even their erstwhile allies the Qashqais. The Government had not been able to punish them at the end of the year. 15. In southern Fars also there was fighting, after the main trouble had ' ended, in the region of Borazjnn and Ahmadi, but this was faction fighting bet ween various, local elements rather than revolt against the Government. Ghazan- far-us-Saltaneh, Zabit of Borazjun, one of the chief disturbers of the peace, was reported killed on the 27th February, since which date the district has beenmore peacef ul. The Army has been disarming the Tangistanis and Dashtistanis in the opening months of 1930. 16. Naturally, with political conditions so disturbed, security was conspi cuous by its, absence on most of the roads in Fars. Car and caravan robberies-were far too numerous to recount in detail here ; but the attack on a car carrying members of the Church Missionary Society on the Bushire road in April deserves special mention : Mr. Proctor, driver of the car, and Miss Henriques, a lady doctor, were wounded by the brigands. The Bushire road was very unsafe in April and May, closed completely for June and most of July, opened inter mittently in August, September and October on payment of rahdari, and often closed from November to March by rain, snow, or floods, the winter being a particularly cold and wet one for Fars,. The road to Isfahan was kept open better after the troubles, but was closed to car traffic in January and February through severe weather. The road via Niriz to Kerman and Bandar Abbas was seldom open at all owing to robberies. The trade of Shiraz suffered very seriously from these adverse conditions. 17. The Indo-European Telegraph Department also had a difficult year. On May 13th one wire was interrupted 22 miles west of Shiraz by Darashuri tribes men, and many insulators were broken. On May 20th one line was interrupted 10 miles west of Shiraz. On the 24th a second line was interrupted. On June 4th the Qashqais cut all lines near Dasht-i-Arzan and refused to allow them to be repaired* All lines to Isfahan were cut early in the morning of June 6th ; one was restored on June 8th, the other two later. Between Dasht-i-Arazan and Kazerun, wilful damage occurred on a large scale ; many miles of wire were removed wholesale, poles uprooted, insulators broken, stalks removed, etc. Ghulams out on duty were repeatedly robbed, but bravely went out time after time to repair the lines while the authorities refused to give them an escort of military or road-guards. On June 25th all line were interrupted south of Konnar Takhteh, and on the 26th again cut north of Konar Takhteh. One line was reconstructed from Shiraz to Kazerun in the middle of July, but was again wrecked ten miles out of Shiraz on July 23rd, six spans of wire being cut out. Permanent repairs on the section Shiraz-Kazerun could not be effected by the Assistant Superintendent until October, when an escort was at last provided by the military authorities. The Ghulams who were robbed while on duty received no compensation from the Persian Government, nor did the Department recover the value of Government property stolen from its rest-houses and its servants. 18. As regards local administration, no great changes took place., The Opium Monopolv Administration ceased to be an independent concern, being placed under the Finance Department in April 1929. The Director of Finance, Mirza Humavun Khan Sayyah, found its accounts, in hopeless confusion on taking over. He himself was recalled to Tehran at the end of July, having refused to tolerate the interference of the Amir Lashkar Shaibani in financial affairs. Mirza Ghulam Ali Khan Arbabi, Director of Posts and Telegraphs and for a time Acting Governor-General was also recalled to Tehran in July for similar reasons He was replaced by Mirza Haider Khan Taraz, the Chief of Posts. Kazim Khan Mudabbir. a former Assistant Governor-General was, made Chief of the Census Department, and the whole of South Persia was placed under his control. Sarhang Humavun Khan Shahrdar, the Chief of Police, was transferred to Isfahan in August and replaced by Sarhang Fazlullah Khan Agakham, formerly Chief of Police in Isfahan. The Director of Education, Abul Qasim Khan Fiyuzat, remained at his post during the whole year, and his sphere was extend ed to cover the Gulf Ports and Lar. He showed considerable activity, travelling himself to Bushire, Bandar Abbas, Lar, Istahbanat, etc., for the inspection of existing Schools and the foundation ot new ones. 19. In the autumn of 1929 the Municipality of Shiraz was placed under the control of a military officer, who signalised the change by inaugurating street improvements on a grand scale. The avenue in front of the Consulate was widened to 54 metres, all protruding buildings being knocked down with the significant exception of the Government barracks,, and the road was metalled with loose earth which made it absolutely impassable all the winter. In the spring similar avenues were planned in other parts oi the town and the woik oi destruc tion commenced in twenty places at once, to the great impediment of traffic. While these changes may eventually improve the town, a vast number of pro perty owners, many of them quite poor, are hard hit by the destruction , and this, added to the distress following a civil disturbances and bad trade, has left the town as a whole much impoverished and by no means well disposed towards the Pahlavi regime.16 CHAPTER IV. 'Administration Report for the Consular for the year 1929. Personnel. Bandar Ahhas—Mx. G. A. Richardson, O.B.E., held the post of His Majesty's Vice-Consul with the personal rank of Consul throughout the year. Lingah. —Assistant Surgeon E. R.

Lingah. —Khan Sahib Ahmad bin Yussuf Khaja, a Persian subject, continued to act nominally for His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, but he is not recognized by the local authorities. Local Government. Bandar Ahhas. —Agha Syed Abdulla Khan Mir-i-Fakhrai (Muddabar-ul- Mulk) was Governor. lie proceeded on leave to Tehran via Kerman on the 5th April but did not return to his post. Major Mahmud Khan Parwin, Command ing the Troops, and later Agha Syed Khan Sadar, the local Postmaster, officiated as 0 Governor till the arrival of Agha Mirza Zainal Abedin Khan Ibrat (Motiman- ei-Vazareh) from Tehran on the 22nd August. The latter was s.till in office at the close of the year. Syed Abdulla was not very efficient but a kind and friendly gentleman of the old school. The present incumbent Mirza Zainal A'bedin had previously been Governor for a year in 1926-27. Whilst professing to be friendly outwardly, he is a weak and corrupt official and is not popular with the merchants, or the local officials. Mmafr—Mirza Ali Khan Azad, the Deputy Governor who is subordinate to the Bandar Abbas administration, returned off leave from Shiraz, in February and remained in charge till October when he was. dismissed from his post. He was succeeded by Mohamed Ali Khan Ashkani who arrived from Tehran on the 6th December. Lingah. —Agha Abdul Shakur (Mishqat-es-Sultaneh) who had been appoint ed Deputy Governor in November 1928, had a very short innings,- being dis missed in February. His successor, Agha Ali Asghar Khan (Basir-ul-Dowleh) arrived from Bushire on the 17th April. He died suddenly on the 28th July under suspicious, circumstances. Ba»ir-ul Dowleh appeared to be a good and capable administrator and was generally popular. Syed Abdul Hussain (Sherif Humayun) who also came from Bushire, assumed charge of the post of Deputy Governor on the 2nd August and continued in office till the end of the year. Visit of Governor of the Gidf Ports. His Excellency Muzaffar Khan Alam (Sardar-i-Intesar) accompanied by an Adlyeh official visited Lingah between the 10th and 22nd February. On arrival he relieved the Deputy Governor Abdul Shakur and his Munshi, owing to numerous complaints, having been received against them. He also suspended the Eais-i-Nazmieh and his clerk for having aided and abetted the Governor in the irregularities committed. The merchants and townspeople were elated at the visit as His Excellency appeared to take an interest in local affairs, promising improvements in sanita tion, the installation of electric lighting in the town and a proper fresh water supply. A branch of the u Red Lion and Sun Society ' was opened and subscriptions were collected. .17 On the 23rd February, His Excellency arrived at Bandar Abbas and immediately caused an investigation into the unsatisfactory state of the affairs of the Bevenue Department. A branch of the ' Red Lion and Sun Society ' was also established at Bandar Abbas and a sum of 1,700 Tomans collected in subscriptions, together with a promise by the merchants, to contribute five shahis per package on all goods imported or exported by them through the Customs House. Accompanied by the local Grovernor and the Officer Commanding the Troops, His Excellency paid a visit of inspection to Minab. The Governor left in the Customs Launch ' Gilan ' en route for Kishim and Hen jam, whence he sailed on the 13th March in the Iraq Government steamer u Nearchus ' for Bushire. On his return to headquarters the Governor of Gulf Ports caused a Commis sion of Enquiry to be despatched from Tehran, to investigate the unsatisfactory state existing in certain administrative departments at Bandar Abbas. The Commission under the presidency of Yawar Syed Riza Khan of the Tehran police and consisting of one official each from the Ministries of Justice and Finance arrived here on the 28th March and continued its labours till the end of April. Finance Department. His Majesty's Consulate now rarely comes into contact with this department officially. Mirza Abdur Riza Khan, the Amin-i-Malyieh, was, suspended from office as a result of the investigation made by the Commission referred to above in respect of the bandrolling of opium. He was recalled to Tehran in June and relieved by one Mirza Ahmed Khan Moghithi, who himself was replaced on the Slst October by the present incumbent Mirza Mustapha Khan. Minah. —Agha Mirza Abdulla Khan Minajjimi, Director of Finance of the Gulf Ports visited Minab via Bandar Abbas in February and caused the Finance Agent to be arrested and sent to Bushire owing to the discovery of a deficiency of Krans 14,000 on inspection of his, cash balance. Lingah. —Mirza Mohamed Hussain Khan Surushzadeh held the appointment cf Amin-i-Malyieh throughout the year. He is looked upon with suspicion by his colleagues owing to his reputed pro- British proclivities. * Posts and Telegraphs. Bandar Abhas. —Syed Ali Khan Sadr relieved Syed Zaman Saif in Feb ruary and held charge of Posts and Telegraphs during the remainder of the year. His administration of the postal services was quite satisfactory on the whole. A bi-weekly motor postal service between Bandar Abbas and Kerman and vice versa was opened in September and is working with fair regularity. Owing to the telegraph operators not being conversant with any foreign language or being able to even copy messages arriving in code, telegrams are delivered in a mutilated condition and are deciphered with great difficulty. Telephones. Communication with Minab by telephone was established during the year. Lingah. —Mirza Ali Akbar held the office of Postmaster throughout the year. A case was reported in May in which the covers of three insured letters con taining Indian Currency Notes to the value of Rs. 1,840 despatched through the Persian Post to Karachi by the Imperial Airways, were found torn open on arrival at destination and their contents missing. The postal peon was suspected and subsequent enquiries instituted in the matter failed to'bstablish his guilt. Later Monsieur Shahruzi, the Director of Imperial Southern Posts visited Lingah by air in this connection but returned to Bushire after a short stay with out eliciting any result. Lcll4FD -•'f18 ■ ' Municipality. Sotti6 slight improvement was observed during the year under review. Although municipal affairs are really uuder the Governor, a nominal Council recently appointed by him, holds meetings at various intervals. Being in receipt of a regular Budget allotment from Tehran some attempt has been made to sweep and clean the streets. At the end of the year about 50 electric lamps were installed in the town and it is, projjosed to put up another 150. Test wells were dug at some distance outside Bandar Abbas with the object of bringing in drinking water for the inhabitants. Lingah.—Bince the visit of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, more attention is being paid to the sanitation of this town. Roads are being constructed and the numerous reservoirs scattered through out the town and in the surrounding area have been cleaned and put into proper repair. Education Department. (Mu'arif.) Bandar Ahhas.—Uhza Ali Dashti was the Rais-i-Muarif till the 6th Novem- ber when he was transferred to Bushire and relieved by Mirza Hussam Knan Mudani. Progress continues in the state of the schools established at Bandar Abbas r Minab, Kishim and Hormuz Isjand. Lincjah. —There is no lack of interest in education in this town, which 111 spite of a diminishing population boasts of one Government and two national schools with over 125 pupils. Police Department. Bandar 465as.—The force under the Rais-i-Nazmieh Naib Abbas Quli Khan Safiri consists of one other officer, 40 foot police and 12 mounted sowars. Detachments of 20 men each under a non-commissioned officer recruited during the year have been posted at the village of Mmab and the Islands or lien jam and Kishim. The men are well drilled and smart in appearance but not having been trained in a proper school have very little idea about police duties. Unqah—^Q strength of the force which is commanded by Naib I Agha Sarum Khan has been brought up to 30 men and one non -commissioned officer. Passport Department. Bandar ylftfcas.—Although the Customs, authorities have hitherto considered theirs to be the Passport Control Department; the Nazmieh besides issuing pass ports, now claims to control such. Recently, in spite of permission being gran ef b v the Customs to certain British officials, or others to disembark here during the stay in port of the mail steamers in which they happened to be travelling, the Bais-i-Nazmieh, contrary to established practice has objected on the plea t a their passports were not visa-ed for Persia. He has also prevented persons resident in Persia from landing for a few hours, because their passports were not specifically visa-ed for Bandar Abbas. Great inconvenience was caused to members of the staff of the Imperial Aii- ways. Limited, at Jask and of the Indo-European Telegraph Department station ed at Jask, Chahbar and Henjam owing to their having to apply to the JNazmien at Bandar Abbas for exit visas. On several occasions it was necessary to refer to the Governor of the Gulf Ports before permission was obtained for them to leave Persia.^ The local autho rities owing to the claim of the Persian Government to Bahrein decline to issue passports for that place to their nationals in order to evade the necessary British visa thereon. Intending Persian visitors to Bahrein are advised to take out teskeras or permits for Dubai instead, - , ^19 r AmnieJi (Gendarmerie). The Amnieli post established here consists of eight men and one non~ Commissioned officer nnder Main Naib Mahomed Khan Pashahi. The Officer Commanding the Baft-Bandar Abbas section of the ronte to Kerman via the Tang-i-Zandan visited Bandar Abbas during the year. There are no guards stationed along the motor road leading to Kerman via the Tang-i-Zagh. Judicial Department. Bandar Ahhas. —A 44 Snlhiyeh Court was opened at the end of last year. The President MirZa Abdul Hasan Khan Jazairi was in charge throughout the year. Only petty civil suits were filed in this Court, minor police cases being dealt with by the Eais-i-Nazmieh. The commercial interests of this town s.uffer under a great disadvantage in there being no Adliyeh Court, since suits of any importance are required to be filed at Bushire. Lingah and There are no proper Courts established at either of these places and civil and commercial disputes have to be referred to the Deputy Governor for arbitration. Great dissatisfaction exists in consequence. Customs. Bandar Ahhas.-^Mitz^ Abdul Majid Khan Tadjbaksh, the Provincial Director of Customs, owing to numerous complaints preferred against him chiefly by this Consulate was recalled to Tehran in April. He was an ideal obstructionist and distinctly hostile to British interests generally. lie was not popular with his own s,taff and with the mercantile com munity. His successor, Mirza Quli Khan Ashraf, who came here from Bushire ha^ completely changed the complexion of the Customs administration. He is a capable and hardworking young man. Important alterations have been effected by him in the Customs House and greater facilities are offered for the operation of clearing goods. During the year visits of inspection to Bandar Abbas and Lingah were paid in January by Agha Kasim Khan Jala'ri (Turjuman-i-Sultan), an Inspector- General of Customs at the Central Administration, Tehran, and in June by Monsieur Hunin, Inspector-General of the South Persian Customs at Bushire. Owing to the fact of there being only a single revenue motor dhow to patrol the coast between Gwettur and Khamir, a stretch of about 430 miles of sea board, it was impossible to control the contraband traffic that is rife in these parts. The establishment of a new Customs post at the village of old Henjam has, however, acted as a deterrent to would-be smuggling dhows from the opposite Arabian Coast. Since the question of the suzerainty over the Bahrain Islands was raised by the Persian Government, the local Customs do not permit the discharge of mer chandise at this port for transhipment to Bahrain. All such goods landed for the purpose are required to pay customs duties in full and the compounded road tax in addition. Lingah. —Monsier Niss,an Hain was Director throughout the year. In January, instructions were received to maintain separate books for customs duties collected on goods imported from the Oman Coast, Muscat, Bahrain and Koweit. Later, orders arrived from Tehran to the effect that no import duties were to be levied on native produce from Bahrain, Tanb and Abu Musa Islands. Persian Troops. Bandar Ahbas. —Yawar Mahmud Khan Parwin was, in command of the ' gurdan ' (battalion) of troops garrisoning the Southern Gulf Ports (including Jask and Charbar) till August when he was succeeded by Sultan Lutfulla Khan20 Zaliidi from Kerman. The latter was relieved by Sultan Syed Hussain Khan Grhamami at the end of October. The local battalion was incorporated in the Kerman brigade in March 1928 and the troops serving at Charbar have been placed under the Sistan brigade since April 1929. 8 In Yawar Mahnmd Khan, the Bandar Abbas command had a most efficient and able officer. He was respected by both officials, and merchants and was popular with the inhabitants in general. There was a marked improvement in the morale and discipline of the troops. The conscription law has not been brought into force in this district. Towards the end of the year, the military authorities started to disarm the tribesmen m the vicinity. The small detachment under the command of Sultan Ismail Khan that had arrived m April 1928 remained here during the year. The conduct of the troops was satisfactory and no complaints were received irom the townspeople as in previous years. Suitan Ismail Khan is a smart and able officer, very favourably disposed Rifles S - Britlsl1 an(i ^ a record whilst serving in the South Persia Condition of the Country. Bandar Abbas Town.—This has, been fairly free from crime during the year there being only a single case of theft recorded in which part of the stolen pro- perty was recovered and the culprits arrested. In sympathy with the revolt in the Fars Province, a band of armed horsemen under Sheikh Abdul Hasan Khan Kuhistani took up a position near the ang i-Zagn, and although no activity was shown, the demonstrators blocked the motor road between Bandar Abbas and Sirjan during the hot weather, till dis persed and obliged to retire on the advance in September of a force of regulars from Kerman under Sartip Ali Shah Khan.

The routes leading to Kennan and other parts of the country were com- paratively sate during the year, except for a few cases of the looting of mer chandise goods reported on the Tang-i-Zagh road. Isolated gangs of Baharlu i oboers taking advantage of the political trouble in the Fars province wandered IW ^ SUeCe . eded . in l00tin 8- a few the Idiig-i-Zagh and Tang-i-Zandan routes from the Coast.

Bandar Abbas.-^ix slaves sought asylum at this Consulate. Three of these weie from I crsian Baluchistan and were issued Certificates of Manumission21 direct from fhe local Governorate to whom their cases were referred. The remaining three were from Aden and Zanzibar. As^ the locai authorities contended that these slaves were not Persian sub jects^ British papers were furnished to them under the orders of the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Lmgah. Five refugee slaves applied at the Consular Agency for manumis sion and three others had been awaiting the disposal of their cases from the previous years. One of the former, a Swahili, was, granted a Certificate of Manumission which was sent to the Consular Agent, the remaining four grew impatient and left the port and did not present themselves again at the Agency. A viation. Movements of Air Cmft. Bandar Ahhas. —Twenty-one air craft including fifteen under British Colours, four Dutch and two French called here during the year. BrifisJi. Of these, twelve wefe Victoria machines of the Royal Air Force, that alighted on^ the aerodrome on their outward and homeward flights from Baghdad to India and back for the evacuation of the Foreign Legations at Kabul. The remaining three comprised {a) A Vickers Yellore monoplane with Flying Officer Moir, on his flight from London to Australia, {I) The Fokker monoplane called '' The Southern Cross '' in command of Captain Kings,ford Smith in his attempt to establish a record flight between Sydney and England and (c) a Fokker monoplane conveying the American millionaire Mr. Van Lear Black to the Far East. Dutch. —Two Fokker monoplanes belonging to the Royal Dutch Airways engaged on an experimental air mail service passed through, flying from Amsterdam to Batavia and vice versa. Two flying boats of the Royal Netherlands Navy bound for the Dutch East Indies that touched at Hen jam in May, came on here to re-fuel. French. —A Farman Biplane with two French aviators flying from Paris to Sargon and back halted on both her trips to re-fuel. One Victoria Aeroplane of the Royal Air Force Kabul Flight (J. 8929) under the Command of Squadron Leader Brownsdon-Rice, on her return flight from India was forced to land at Bunder Galag near the river Rapch, 90 miles East of Jask, and had eventually to be abandoned and destroyed. 11 en jam. —Two Southampton Flying Boats of the Royal Air Force under the Command of Air Commandore Barnett alighted on the 9th May, proceeded to Muscat and returned with the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on board, whom they eventually conveyed to the Trucial Coast and Bahrain. Ling ah. —Since the inauguration in April of the Air Mail Service from England to Karachi, liners of the Imperial Airways alight at Lingah to re-fuel, both on their Eastward and Westward bound flights. The weekly service opened with the arrival on the 5th April from London of the ' City of Jerusalem ' having Air Vice Marshal Sir Vyabe Vyvyan as a passenger. The first Westward bound liner the City of Baghdad ' arrived from Karachi on the 8th April with Lord Chetwynd, Chairman of the Imperial Air ways,, Limited, the Hon'ble Miss Chetwynd, Air Marshal Sir Geoffrey Salmond, Air Vice-Marshal Sir V. Vyvyan on board. Amongst other air crafts that landed on the aerodrome might be mentioned (1) Two Junker monoplanes flying from Bushire to Jask and vice versa, conveying Sartip Mirza Ahmed Khan, the Persian Air Minister, (2) the Avroavian biplane Amoy ' (No. X-CRIA) with the Chinese aviator Wen Lin Tchen and a Danish Mechanic Johannsen, flying from Croydon to Nanking, and (3) a De Havilland Moth with Mrs. Cleaver and Captain Drew flying from England to India. Visits of His Majesty's Ships. Bandar Abhas. —Owing to the difficulties raised by the local authorities in respect of quarantine and passport formalities and their disinclination to permit LclUFD22 officers disembarking from His Majesty's Ships, only one ship visited the port during the year. This was His Majesty's Ship ' Triad ' with Captain H. Boyes, C.M.Gr., R. N., Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gnlf, on board. Ling ah. —None of H. M. 's Ships called here during the year, Basidu. A small Naval Guard from off one of the sloops, was stationed here throughout the year, and the port visited frequently by one or other of His Majesty's Ships based on Hen jam. • French Navy.—The armed Yacht ' Diana ' during her cruise in the Persian Gulf anchored at Henjam on the 2nd February and sailed for Muscat the follow ing evening. Visits of His Majesty's Representatives. Sir Robert Clive, K.C.M.G., His Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary at Tehran accompanied by Sir Charles Hartopp, Bart., First Secretary of H. M. s Legation visited Henjam and Bandar Abbas in October. The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel C. C. J. Barrett, C.S.I., C.LE., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, en route to Muscat on the S. S. ' Baroda dis- •embarked for a few hours and visjted the Consulate. He also landed at Lingah when passing through that port. The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel H. V. Biscoe and family and accompanied bv Captain A. A. Russell, M.C., Under Secretary, during his tour of inspection in the Persian Gulf, called at Henjam on the 19th December and left for Bushire the same night. Air. G. A. Richardson, O.B.E., His Majesty's Consul and Assistant to the Resident inspected the Consular Agency at Lingah from the 4th to the 10th April. He again visited Lingah between the 24th and 28th May to close down that Agency. British Interests. Consulate Escort. —This consisted of two pensioned Indian Sowars and two mounted Persian Ghulams recruited locally. Indo-European Telegraph Department. Bandar Alias— Indian Government Telegraph Steamer ^ Patrick Stewart ' with Mr. G. deSmidt, Director of the Persian Gulf Section on board called here on the 19th February for the inspection of the local office. Lingah. The Radio Station in spite of being unable to import its require ments in respect of spare parts and wireless stores, functioned satisfactorily throughout the year. Imperial Banlc of Persia. Mr. H. E. Walton replaced Mr. V. H. Glendening as Manager of this branch on the 3rd May. The bank collected 280,000 defective krans during the year on behalf of the Persian Government, - v The standard of coin in circulation in this district is .now very fair. The price of foreign exchange maintained a regular upward movement, until with the close of the year the highest rate ever recorded was attained. Selling quotations of the bank of London and Bombay were as follows ! London.— Highest . . .. ' Krans 62 per £1. Lowest . . — — ' Krans 48f per £1. Average — »• - - Krans- 53 per £1. Bombay.— nie'hest . / • • — • • Krans 460 per Rs. 100. Lowest »• - • ' - • Krans 3'69 per Rs,. 100. Average 1 — •- Krans 417 per Rs. 100.23 Red Oxide of Iron. Hormu£ Island. —The output of ore available for export amounted to 8,950 tons of which 4,950 tons were shipped to the United Kingdom, 1,500^ tons to India (Calcutta) and 2,500 to the United States of America (Philadelphia). The whole of the product was transported in British vessels. Trade and Commerce. « Bandar Ahhas. —Trade showed a steady decline during the year. . The import of goods was discouraged by the rising rate for foreign exchange and the business of local merchants which consists chiefly in forwarding merchandise to the interior has declined accordingly. The Russians have made steady progress in pushing the sale of their goods and steamers of the Soviet Mercantile fleet have called fairly regularly bringing Russian goods, chiefly loaf and soft sugar, cotton piece-goods, prints and matches. The Russians have to a large extent eliminated the problem of foreign exchange by introducing a system of barter. They have arranged to take ov(ir native produce such as pistachio nuts, dried fruits, and skins, etc., in exchange for sugar and manufactured cotton goods. The total volume of trade during the Persian year 1307 (1928-1929) the latest for which customs statistics are available, decreased by 14,465,000 Krans from that of the preceding year. Imports fell by Krans 14,494,000 but exports showed a rise of Krans, 1,472,000, merely attributable to the diversion through Bandar Abbas of the usual route by which carpets had previously been despatched from Kerman. Lingah. —The figures registered at the Customs House show that this trade continues to decline fast. The total volume decreased by 30 per centum in 1928- 1929 as compared with that of the preceding year. Shipping and Navigation. Bandar Ahhas. —164 steam ships aggregating 387,573 tons entered anxi cleared the port ; comprising 154 British, 6 German and 4 Russian. Thirty-nine vessels brought merchandise from the United Kingdom of which 26 belonged to Messrs. Frank C. Strick and Company, Limited, and 13 to the Ellerman and Bucknall Steamship Company. The s,ix German steamers were of the Hensa Line of Bremen and embarked their cargoes at Hamburg or Antwerp. The four Russian steamers belonged to the Soviet Merchantile Fleet and conveyed goods from Odessa. Ling ah. —85 ships (82 British and 3 German) with a total of 168,312 tons entered and cleared with cargo. One shipping casualty was reported during the year. A sailing dhow owned by a Muscat subject bound for the pearl fisheries was, wrecked near Lingah. Political. Politically, as regards Bandar Abbas, the year has been a quiet one. The Qashghai revolt in the Summer and the trouble in the Lar area did not have their counter part in this district, the inhabitants showing indifference to passing events in those quarters. Mir Barakat Khan and his Baluch followers watched the progres.s of affairs in the Fars province with not a little interest, but were quite inactive them selves. The anniversary of the Coronation of His Imperial Majesty Shah Pahlavi was celebrated on the 23rd 124th April. An official reception was held by the Acting Governor and attended by the Persian officials, His, Majesty's Consul, and the local and foreign mercantile communities. There was not very much enthusiasm shown, as is generally the case in these parts over celebrations of this nature.24 Quarantine and Sanitation. Dr. Mohamed Ali Khan Muayed Hikmet held the post of Quarantine Medical and Sanitary Officer throughout the year. He is a plausible official but is inclined to be mixed up in local intrigue. Some excitement was caused owing to the incidence of small-pox in Karachi during the Summer and later on the outbreak of cholera there and a few cases of plague in Bombay. British Indians resident in Bandar Abbas, in spite of an official protest, were forcibly inoculated against cholera by the Quarantine Medical Officer who objected to such inoculations being performed by the Consulate Medical Officer in the case of British subjects. No epidemics occurred in this district during the year under review. |v Town Charitable Dispensary. Assistant Surgeon J. W. Sweeney, I.M.D., held charge of this institution which functioned very satisfactorily. Although the Government of India places the services of a British Medical Officer gratuitously at the disposal of the Dispensary and allots a fairly liberal supply of medicines annually, the funds for its maintenance otherwise, are very low and unless the mercantile community comes forward with subscriptions, the question of closing down the Dispensary which has afforded medical and surgical relief in the past to thousands of the poor inhabitants of the town and adjacent villages and Islands may unfortunately arise in the near future. The attendance of out-patients was as follows, as compared with the two preceding years 1929 ...v .. .. 6,664 1928 .. t ... .. .. 7,620 1927 .. .. .. ., .. 6,568 Lingah. —The Charitable Dispensary was closed down on the 28th May on the abolition of the Consular Agency. Economic Conditions. •Plentiful seasonal rains fell throughout the district, especially at Minab and the Shamilat, but swarms of locusts destroyed most of the crops, especially the date crop at Minab. Earth tremors were not so frequent as in the preceding year. They were slight and of very sjiort duration.25 CHAPTER V. .Administration Report of His Majesty 1 s Consulate, Kerman for the year 1929. A.—B ritish I nterests. 1. II. M.'s Consulate : personnel. —Mr. J. H. Davies was absent from March 23rd to April 21st in India when he passed the Interpreter's test in Persian. A week after his return he was taken ill with pneumonia afid after an illness of a few days died in the Church Missionary Society Hospital on the 3rd May. Mr. Davies was a very popular %ure among Persians as well as Europeans. A long and appreciative obituary notice was published in the local press. Captain J. R. H. Tweed, M.B.E., M.C., of the 1119th Hyderabad Regiment who had arrived from India on the 12th April on a year's language leave assum ed temporary charge on the 5th of May. Mrs. J. H. Davies with her two children left for Europe overland on the 20th. Major E. W. C. Noel, C.I.E., D.S.O., on Special Duty at Bushire was appointed as Consul but was turned back by rebels at the Tang-i-Zagh 100 miles from Bandar Abbas on the 18th of June and had to travel via Karachi and Duz- dab. He reached Kerman on the 20th July and assumed charge on the 21st. In November he went to Duzdab and brought back Mrs. Noel and 2 children. Khan Bahadur Abdul 'Alim held the post of Indian Attache to H. M. 's Consul throughout the year. 2. Consulate Work. —Out of the 12 cases pending in the Governor-General's Court at the end of 1928, 4 were settled before the final abolition of the Capitula tions and compensation recovered amounted to Krans 15,557-50. The rest of the cases were either unimportant or irrecoverable. 56 British subjects were registered during the year. The u Qanat ' which supplies the Zirisf quarter in which the Consulate stands with irrigation water is owned by a large number of proprietors. Owing to this fragmentation of holding considerable difficulty is experienced in keep ing the ' Qanat ' in good order. A meeting of owners was called at the Con sulate and Tumans 1920 were subscribed to complete the arrears of cleaning and repairs. The work was still in hand at the close of the year. The water owners seemed only too pleased to find that H. M.'s Consul was prepared to take an interest in the matter. 3. Indo-European Telegraph Department. —In March Mr. C. E. Duggan re lieved Mr. C. E. Treadwell as Assistant Superintendent of the Sub-Division and Mr. A. Robertson relieved Mr. P. E. Dormer at the office and Mr. T. F. Lovell took over from Mr. J. P. May at Dehaneh Baghi. The Beam wireless has at present crippled the land line to India. In August traffic had] fallen to about 10 per cent, of the lines capacity and receipts would do little more than cover the linesman's pay. Instructions and circulars from the Board at home all pointed to economies and reductions in personnel 'which led to a corresponding feeling of uncertainty among the staff at Kerman where reductions have in fact already been started. The number of Armenian signallers now stands at 5 as compared to a previous average of eight and the services of the Indian mechanic have been dispensed with. The line to Bandar Abbas built as a war measure is now useless as far as commercial traffic is concerned. With a view to economy the annual inspection for the last two years has been carried out by the head Ghulam instead of the European Assistant Superintendent. The Amnieh guard at Dehaneh Baghi was reduced from 6 to 4 men, and in October it was given out that it would be withdrawn altogether unless the De partment contributed Tumans 6 per mensem towards each man's pay. After some correspondence this was agreed to and the Rais-i-Amnieh at Kerman was good enough to allow the Assistant Superintendent to pay the men the amount himself instead of through the Amnieh department as laiki down. In the course of the rebellion the Ghulam at Sirjan was looted when the town was captured. A claim has been lodged. LclUFD26 The following table shows the number of insulators broken per 100 miles of line during the past 5 years and is a useful indication of the state of security prevailing :— Kerman Sub- Division.

IwipcTial Bo/fiJc of Pcvsia aud Trade iu Gonerdl, —Mr. Q. Gardner con tinued during the year as Manager and Mr. H. J. Douglas as Accountant. The break in the Stock Exchange Market in New York is likely to prove the most important event of the year as far as the business of the Bank in Kerman is concerned as the export of carpets to New York will diminish in the near future and this set back to Kerman staple industry can but have important reaction on other trades. • 4- re ? no y^ ^ ie Customs dues on silver was also an important event in that it resulted in a considerable rise in the value of Foreign Exchange and thus most certainly assisted exporters at a time when their goods were at a discount overseas. This of course also has repercussions on the import trade but of ^ un _ tavourable nature. As the competition of goods sold by Eussia in the North and imported via Bandar Abbas in the South was already hamperino- the import trade from India and Europe it is impossible to assess the effects of the alteration m Exchange values in this connection. ^ Drought and the damage done by late frosts and locusts resulted in hiffh prices for food and wool and must be considered in any review of 1929 Finally of Persia WTk I v I ^ in f u §? iration or ^ branch of the National Bank ot Persia m Kerman m early September.

Church Missionary Society.~{a) Educational—Boys' /S'c/iooL—During the year 1929 the^ staff and 1 administration of this school have remained the same. Boys are admitted at the age of 7 or 8 and are taught in Persian up to the stand ard of the Persian Government Primary certificate and the end of the sixth class. 'In the 7th and 8th classes the teaching is largely in English to equip boys for work in European business firms such as the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Further co-operation with the Education authorities, and the success of candidates from the School in the Grovernment examinations of the past summer together with a fuller appreciation among Persians of the amenities of the new School building and football ground, have resulted in a satisfactory increase in numbers, which have doubled during the twelve months, and attendance of sixty having increased to one of an hundred and twenty. There is moreover a lame waiting list. Special attention is paid to gymnastics and games. The School football team was never beaten whether in competition with other schools or with teams irom the town. Girls' School. —The Girls' School has been moved to more spacious quar ters. The attendance rose from 144 last year to 204. The staff was not found sufficient to deal with this number and so it was reduced to 183. Of them 41 are in the upper school, 91 in the middle lower and 51 in the Kindergarten and Tran sitory classes. The company of girl guides has been registered officially at the Girl Guides Headquarters m London as the 1st Kerman Girl Guides Company At present 20 guides have been enrolled and although debarred from many forms of ser vice open to other guides, have shown a commendable spirit and have renderpfl valuable help in the 'Women's hospital as well as elsewhere. {h) Medical. —There have been numerous changes in personnel. At the end of the year the_ European staff consisted of Doctor Dodson and one Lady Doctor Miss Pigott, Mr. Iliff, Principal of the Bov'^ School, Mr. Oddie Electrician, Miss Woodroffe and Miss Herdlev at the Girls' School Miss Stratton for the Welfare Work, Dr. Westlake and Miss Thomas as evangelists and Miss Petley and Miss James as Nurses. Dr. E. F. Molony died of typhoid on February 20th. Dr. Dodson was at home on leave and the Lady Doctor Miss Hodgkinson refused to attend male patients A difficult situation thus arose to remedy which the appointment of an Assistant Surgeon from the I. M. D. as Consular Surgeon was proposed but at the last moment Dr. D. Carr one of the Veterans of the CMS who after 30 years' service had retired to England, volunteered to fill the gap and arrived m Kerman m June and stayed till Dr. Dodson's return in November. The value of the medical work has continued to increase and the benefits conferred are widely and deeply appreciated.

It was thought that with the road29 made passable for motors from Kerman to Kliabis and a bridge over the Rud-i- tohur motor traffic from Meshed to Kerman would be possible, in January a meeting was held at Kerman under the Governor-General's auspices at which the Khabis landlords promised to subscribe Tumans 10,000. However nothing further has since been heard of the project. Bandar Abbas-Kerman. —In March the Bandar Abbas motor road was opened. This road had been made into a motor track by the South Persia Rifles from Kerman to Gakum (215 miles) and Bandar Abbas to the mouth of the Tang-i-Zagh (88 miles). There thus only remained a section of about 24 miles of which 7 lay through the formidable Tang-i-Zagh. Work started on this sec tion in 1928 and altogether a sum of Tumans 1,00,000 is said to have been spent. The section through the Tang is very narrow with sharp turns. There is a precipitous drop and the foundations of the road are none too solid. The roadl is scarcely passable for lorries of more than 30 cwt. capacity. In addition to the Tang there are several places where there are short sharp gradients which necessitate the unloading of lorries and manhandling. In the autumn this road was washed away and remained closed for about 10 days. It is reported that the Persian Government has made a budget provi sion for 1930 for widening and improving the road. Kerman-Mahun. —A new alignment from Kerman to Mahun (21 miles) was completed in November. It follows the foot of the mountains to the North and thereby avoids the heavy sand and mud in the plain. The rain and snow in December washed this road out and it is unlikely that it will be passable till the spring. Baw to Duzdab. The Bam-Duzdab road remains in its usual unsatisfac tory condition. The Persian Government refuses to spend any money on this load appaiently with the hope that an alternative alignment can be found. Two suggestions have been made—one leaving the present road at Fahreh and making straight for Duzdab^'a Shuru and the other via Rigan and Shurab. Miscellaneous .—Sardar Mujallal, C.B.E., the most efficient of landlords in the Kerman province, has fully realized the importance of good communications and is gradually connecting up all his properties by motor roads. Among those he has recently made the following may be mentioned :— Rayin to Qariat-uI-Arab .. .. .. 27 miles. Rayin to Mahun .. .. # ^ 40 ^1^ Rayin to Bahramgird .. .. .. 39 miles. He is on the point of building a road from Rayin to Sarvizan (36 miles). Sar- vizan is situated South of Rayin in the' hills at an elevation of 9,500 feet and is said to be a pleasant spot with turf, running water and shade trees. Connected to Kerman by a motoi road it is likely to become popular as a summer resort. Road making in Kerman province is a cheap and simple affair. Sardar Mujallal's roads don't cost more than Tumans 15 a mile. In addition to Sardar Mujallal a syndicate of carpet manufacturers with looms at Rawar subscribed Tumans 350 and with this money have made it pos sible to motor to Rawar via Zerind and Tarz in a day. The distance its 110 miles. (b) Security on Trade Routes.— disturbances in the summer onlv affected the Bandar Abbas road. The motor road was closed from June till September and the caravan route was intermittently closed during the s-ame period. . . After the Bandar Abbas road was opened in September robberies occurred at intervals till the guarding of the road was made over to two powerful local men viz., Mohamad Khan Dnragahi and Rais Abdnl Karim Garmsiri since when the road has been safe. ' ' . ri } le Allowing is a list of the chief robberies which have occurred on the mam trade routes ine K erman-Dusda b—- September. Caravan carrying goods for Hindu merchants in Kerman robbed near Chah Dad Mohamed by Ismailzais.

Goods robbed included 2 loads piece-goods and 2 of loaf sugar belonging to a Jlindu trader, K e rm an-J i ruf t—- January to February. Boad closed by Abdul Hussein Kameran who com mitted a number of small robberies. August. Caravan carrying sugar, etc., robbed by Bashakirdis, Kerman to Yezd— No robberies within Kerman limits. Kerman to Meshed—- No robberies within Kerman limits. The Kerman-Bandar Abbas road runs for about 50 miles through Fars ter ritory, an obviously unsatisfactory arrangement, with regard to which the Governor-General has made representations to Tehran, (c) Posts. —Owing to the disturbances in Fars the Kerman-Bandar Abbas postal service became somewhat irregular but was never entirely interrupted. In September the postal route was changed to the new motor road ; the contract for a bi-weekly motor service being given to Arbab Eustam of Kerman for Tumans 460^a month. The chief conditions are that the service is to be bi-week ly and the time of transit 46 hours. Up to 50 batmans is to be carried free and any excess at half shahi per farsakh per Man. The contractor is using 4 Dodge lorries and one touring car. The Duzdab mail is now carried by car between Bam and Kerman thereby reducing the time of transit from 6 to 4-J days. This service continued to func tion except on one occasion in November when the whole post was robbed and destroyed 10 miles from Duzdab. (d) Wireless. —The wireless station erected by the Russians in 1926 five miles West of Kerman has never been in operation. It would appear that the station is falling into disrepair. There are no staff or operators and only a caretaker is in charge. {e) Aviation.—TFiie aerodrome has now been changed to a spot about 4 miles ^North-West of the town on the Zerind road. The surface is flat but after lain it is likely to^ remain unfit for landing for several .days and in the dry weather the dust is very bad. Two Junkers planes passed through Kerman in March on their way to Duz-^ dab to bring a party of American tourists to Kerman. B. — L ocal G overnment and P olitics. 8. Disturbances in Fars.—The first sign of the rebellion was the blocking of the Bandar Abbas motor road by a band of Baharlu sowars who occupied Hajiabad about the 10th of June. The leader of the insurgents was Sheikh Abnl Hassan Sarkuhi of Lar, whose men first occupied Niriz and then Sirjan July 13th. His following which numbered perhaps 1,000 men consistedchiefly of Khamseh. Arabs. However he had little control over them and none at all over numerous small bands of so-called rebels, but really nothing more than robbers. They came from the west and infested the vicinity of the JCeiman-Bandar Abbas caravan route between Baft and Daulatabad, Finding few caravans to rob some of them turned their attention to the villagers and carried off anything they could lay their hands on. On May 1st a number of these robbers penetrated into the district of Isfandiqeh where they looted some villages. This was the furthest east that the rebellion spread. To the North a few parties of robbers reached the Yezd road in the vicinity of Anar. If the rebellion was not formidable the counter measures of the Persian Government were almost as poor. At the beginning of July the local authorities were in the depth of despond ency and beyond the despatch of a few detachments to Baft and Sirjan had done nothing at all. When the news of the capture of Sir jan was received on the 13th it was generally believed that Kerman would also fall into the rebels' hands. Many Kerman residents had hired lorries ready for flight. Some of the Kerman firms had asked if they could deposit their rugs in the Consulate,. The Chief of the Police told H. M.'s Consul that the townspeople would assured ly cut his throat. However at this point the Officer Commanding Troops, Sartip Ali Shah Khan, Eahimi, was suddenly galvanized into action. He mustered all available men in Kerman, about 150 rifles, commandeered some 10 lorries and started for Sirjan. The rebels who before capture of the town had the sym pathy of the people threw away their chance by looting. With the townspeople against them they could not stand against the troops. After a few hours desul tory fighting they broke and disappeared as a fighting force. This proved the end of rebellion as far as Kerman was concerned but the news of Government reverses that leaked through from Shiraz and Isfahan gave rise to a subdued feeling of pleasurable anticipation of a change of Government and dynasty. At the beginning of August there were signs that the feeling was coming to the surface. With the news of the rebellion's collapse, which at first the people were loath to credit, Kerman soon sank back into its accustomed lethargy and indifference. In September the Sirjan garrison, about 800 rifles and 2 guns, sent a strong column south and in co-operation with a force from Shiraz carried out opera tions against the Sarkuhi tribes. On the 26th September an engagement took place at Khashmabad where a force of 400 rebels under Fatullah Khan Naitalkhi was defeated. The Government troops continued their advance towards Laizangan and occupied the house of Sheikh Abul Hassan who became a fugi tive with one or two followers. ^ At the close of the year the Government forces were in occupation of most Oi taiC Baharlu country but had not succeeded in restoring complete order. Movement between Sirjan and Lar is only possible under strong escort. More over fighting was still taking place in the south near Gerash. It is generally believed that the Arab tribes and their confederates are ready to try conclusions again with Government in the spring but are deterred by a shortage of ammunition, rr ^ 0 '! n ^ ss ^ on 0 f Enquiry. —The event of the year, transcending even the l eajou importance has been the visit of the Enquiry Committee. Kerman nas always been considered as a back water. The people are poor the country is and and these disadvantages have been accentuated by the neglect of the entral Government. In the old days the province was regularlv fleeced by a succession of Bakhtiari Governors. This has left its tradition which persists even m the present day. Persian officials have not been slow to live up to it uiled into a sense of security by the feeling that Kerman was out of sight and on ot mmd. However they went too far. Bribery and every form of corrup tion had become rampant and blatant. The Governor-General was wise to re- xFl i n September the appearance of the Enquiry Committee came fn f - i tt me s ^ x 0 ffi c i a l s were placed under arrest and sent to Tehran ni ^ a , f r - la ' . ndoubtedly a change of conduct, if not of code, has resulted. The W Q n A S T -i 1 ' 11 wil1 be P erman ent. Bribery has decreased not so much pnnt 11Se i l G .-Jl 6 ^ a ^ er ® are afraid as because the bribe givers have been en- tiraged to tighten their purse strings.32 The effect on the official class has been depressing in the extreme. With salaries inadequate to maintain a pleasant standard of life they used to supple ment their incomes from other sources. With those sources cut off they have retired into their shell, and gone are the convivial gatherings the little gamblin 0 * parties so dear to the Persian heart. 10. Loccil Officio/ls, cmd DGpciTtwicufs. — (jr0V6Tn0T-(j&amp;i/i6T(xl» —The Grovemor- Oeneral, Haji Nasir-us-Sultaneh found it expedient to resign in August, fearing that having fallen out with his accomplices over the bribes taken in connection with conscription, the Central Government might take cognizance of the com plaints that were sure to reach them. He was relieved by Mirza Abul Hassan Khan Pirnia. Nasir-us-Sultaneh was a pleasant person to deal with and had no liking for the Soviet. His successor is a colourless personality of mediocre ability which he endeavours to mask by a show of officiousness. In his dealins- with the Oon- sulate he is stiff and formal. Finance and Revenue. —With the disappearance of American control in 1928 the state of the Finance Department has deteriorated. A prominent official of the department has stated that 95 per cent, of the Government servants would be glad to have foreigners back in charge of the Malieh and other departments as they all realized that efficiency has been steadily declining since the Americans The Finance Department suffered like others at the hands of the Commis sion : the Director and two of his staff being put under arrest. ^ The reassessment of revenue of the Kerman Province continued under the direction of Qazil Ayagh till September when orders were received to suspend Revenue assessment. ostensl l bl 3 r owing to lack of funds., -i ,. i i i/» ji 11 18 somew hat difficult to credit this ex planation as only half the work has been completed and it has already resulted m a considerable increase in Government revenue. In some villages the new assessment is 3 to 4.times the old. Since the Monopoly law was brought into force in Kerman scarcely a miscal ot opium has been bought from the Government ambar. Government revenue Opi um from opium which used to be Tumans ^ ^ p ' . . 15 ^ 00 a year is now not more than 5,000. he reason for the failure is the antithesis of a restriction of local consumption and a maintenance of export revenue. An acre of land under opium will yield a crop which if sold as contraband fetches Tumans 100 to Tumans 150 whereas sold to Government only Tumans 30. The main movement of contraband opium into Kerman is from Fars. In March reports reached Tehran of extensive movements of smuggled sugar from Lar into the Kerman province. An enquiry was ordered which led Smuggling'. to ihe seizure of about 1,000 tons of sugar • i p ji xn' ta . ® 3 ' r i an ail d the implication of various officials of the Finance Department. The road tax and duty on this quantity rele'nfed th?' n I ' ave t a ™ 0 ™ lt 1 ed to 6,000. The Government eventually icleased the confiscated stocks on a payment of Tumans 15,000. Persian National Bank.— A branch of the National Bank of Persia was opened at Kerman on September 1st. con is 1 \ Ion !- 0 S . tailisla y SteImo a Czeeho Slovakian. The staff consists of 3 ersians, about 8 m number. A reference to the new Bank's activities will be found in paragraph 4 side^^'/?^ K * la ' Alb ^ »» ambitious young man of con- s aei a lut encrgj and strength of will, who had taken up the post of Chief of iutri^ier nnd T^in^tb 7 t7 1 ? ade } is pres f !ce markedly felt. He was a born V i ? ^ at fortune favoured him, lost his head, becomins- too uo i-handed and corrupt. When the Commission of Enquiry arrived in'Sep tember they received] dozens of complaints against him. The'worst was a case ! rape f* Y hlch 0 * e of ' hi . s subordinates had assisted.

Two minor burglaries in which British subjects suffered were cleared up and in one case the bulk of the stolen property recovered. Justice. The following Courts are now in existence in Kerman :— Istinaf (Appeal Court). Bidayat (Court of the First Instance). Sulhieh (Small Cause Court). _ ^ sa ^ t J ^ ie . work of the Courts has improved during the year 1919. ^ briLish subjects, however, have had little recourse to them chieflv owing to their diJatormess. It is found better to seek a settlement out of Court. The compulsory aibitration provisions to which there were serious objec tions have now been considerably amended. . 1 clegraphs. The administration of Post and Telegraphs continued to re- mam in chaige of one Director, ]\[irza Hadi Khan Dariush, till his departure re • f. n in ^eP^ember. Mirza Hussein Khan, Pir Muradi, his assistant held omciatmg charge till the close of the year. Xo new Post or Telegraph Offices were opened in the province during the year under review. Education.—The following figures will show the progress made in Educa tion during the year 1929 1927, 1928. 1929. Boys' Schools .. 34 51 63 Girls' Schools .. .. .. ,. 3 8 8 Boy Students 2,320 2,820 3,000 Girl Students .. .. .. ., 449 679 700 Teachers .. .. .. .. ., 193 307 320 The number of Schools in Kerman town is twelve which is the same as last year. Amnieh. —Yawar Sadiq Khan, formerly Officer Commanding Isfahan, took over charge of the Amnieh from Naib Sarhang Malikzad in February. The new chief appears to be an honest hardworking officer. He has proved helpful in all dealings with the Consulate. Kerman is the centre of the Amnieh Administration for the following roads :— No. of miles Total Amnieh along road (approximate) • Kerman to Duzdab 310 100 Kerman to Bandar Abbas via Baft and Daulatabad .. 270 150 Kerman to Sirjan 113 56 Kerman to Bambiz (Nain) 303 250 Kerman to Chahilpaya (Meshed road) .. 166 50 In headquarters and on detached duty .. 606 394 1,000 LclHFD34 Municipality. —At the beginning of the year a main artery road was cut through the middle of the town involving the demolition of about 100 houses. At first cash compensation was refused ; building sites in an old cemetery being offered in lieu. However, in May, owing to a stream of complaints to Tehran, Tumans 12,000 as compensation was sanctioned. The money was not forth coming till November. It is estimated that the value of the property demoli shed is Tumans 20,000 and so owners will only receive 60 per cent, as compensa tion. The Municipality administration has not been without its share of troubles in the matter of bribery corruption and general inefficiency. Mirza Mehdi who was in charge at the beginning of the year was removed by orders of the Central Government. His son Abdul Hussein was appointed by the Governor who had his own axe to grind. Abdul Hussein was soon in trouble owing to flagrant bribe taking and found himself under arrest at the orders of the Public Prosecutor a bitter enemy of the Governor. However the latter went to work and got the accused released on bail which in Persia means that the case is dropped). A com mittee was then appointed to run the municipality until a permanent incumbent could be found. At the close of the year Agha Mehdi who had been dismissed for incompet ence was Deputy Governor Eafsinjan, and Abdul Hussein is in Tehran where he has been for some months trying to ensure that the case against him goes no further. In October an Italian Engineer Mr. Visce arrived from Tehran as Municipal Engineer. At the close of the year he was still without salary or appliances and his work consisted of a rough design for a slaughter house. In November and December the Governor tried to control the price of wheat. His ettorts only led to a shortage and a deterioration in quality of such grain as was offered for sale. The Baladiyeh budget was raised from 5,000 to 11,500 Tumans. Hoppers made their appearance in April and caused considerable damage. Up till late September Kerman was invaded by flight of winged adults which Locust * also proved . destructive. The locusts penetrated to the tops of the highest mountains, viz., to over 14,000 feet and destroyed completely the grazing with the result that the tribesmen left on their downward migration a month earlier than usual. It is announced that 30 pupils from the Public Works Department are being sent in 1930 to Kerman to organize a campaign against these pests. Sajjil-i-Ahwal—The department extended its activities to Bam and Narma- shir in March. Oiders for a further extension to Baluchistan were received from Tehran in July but no action was taken owing to the lack of tents escorts and funds. In November the organization was extended to Jiruft The Committee of Equiry went into the work of the department and dis covered extensive malpractices. Two of the officials were arrested. It appears that their^method was to show those who paid bribes as being of non-military age while in order to give their returns a good complexion a number of the more well to do who refused to pay bribes wore shown as being of military age although well advanced in years. A local paper published some facetious verses describ ing how an old man sans eyes sans teeth was regenerated by the Seiiil-i-Ahwal into a young and lusty recruit. ii ^ &gt;0 ^ cs - The power of the Mullahs has continued to wane. Avat- uilan, the head of their community, has left Kerman for Eafsinjan where he has anded property, finding that he had little prestige left. Virulent anti-clerical articles have appeared m the local press. , T , Jkf PP 11 ? 6 ,,^ t J le be g innin g of the year conducted a vigorous campaign for tx * liat : se veral persons who proved remiss in the matter received rough treatment. The head of the Police then turned his attention to the T i ^gamlzed thertrical performances in the Government School attended by both men and women, the object being to popularize the idea of on These aSes ^ ^ 0f ^ tr0Uble ^ A ^ hanistan P ut a dam P er35 It was stated in the last year's report that Great Britain's policy of holding aloof was beginning to bear frnit. However, the disturbances in Fars gave a fresh lease of life to the belief that we are ever ready to interfere in Persia to obtain political advantage. On more than one occasion well educated Persians tried to enlist H. M.'s Consul's assistance and obviously did not believe the reply that it was a domestic matter in regard to which on action was possible. There are nominally four papers published at Kerman but only one of them appears with even a semblance of regularity. These papers subsist not so much by sales or genuine subscriptions but by donations from the leading personages of Kerman who find it advisable to pay an insurance premium against newspapet 'criticisms. H. M.'s Consulate subscribes to all the papers. Nothing objection able from the point of view of British interests has appeared in any of them. The ' Istiqamat the leading paper, published a very aympathetic obituary article on Mr. Davies' death. 12. Health and Central Welfare. —Measles in an epidemic form was preva^ lent in February and March and caused a number of deaths chiefly among 4 children. In August a notification was issued regarding the establishment of quarantine posts on the roads to Duzdab and Bandar Abtas. Travellers from India not holding inocculation certificates against cholera were supposed to be inocculated at these stations. Apparently no action was taken beyond the issue of the notice. The post of u Eals-i-Sahiyeh ' changed hands on several occasions, but without any effect on sanitation or public health for which there are no funds available. The general health has been fair in spite of the extreme poverty of the masses and their under-nourishment. Kerman with its arid climate and sandy soil is a healthy town. 13. Russian Interests.- —The Russian political and Consular interests at Kerman are in the charge of the Consul-General at Ispahan. He paid a visit to Kerman and Bandar Abbas in April. He stayed four days at Kerman where he called on all the principal local officials. A branch of the Vnieshtorg is maintained at Kerman under the charge of a Russian Trade Representative. M. Belooshapkin held the post up to May when he was relieved by a Tartar Mons. Bysiantsky who has shown himself more energetic and with a greater interest in political affairs. Belore the war Russia's import of goods represented about 20 per cent, of Kerman's requirements and came in almost entirely from the North. Russia has now by her sea imports through Bandar Abbas captured about 40 per cent, of the trade almost entirely at the expense of Hindu merchants whose share has sunk from 75 per cent, to 45 per cent. The Soviet goods in the way of textiles, sugar and matches are sold at prices at which other traders can scarcely compete. It would seem that the Hindus must either close down or become distributors of Russian goods. There are signs that some of them are contemplating this departure. The Russians have extended their organization to Bam where Russian goods including oil and petrol are now stocked. In the Kerman province the Russians hold 17| per cent, of the trade in Kero sene and 22 per cent, of that in petrol, the balance being done by the Anglo- Persian Oil CompanyThe higher figure for petrol is due to the Russian pro duct's admitted superiority. 14. Military—The number of troops in the Kerman command may be put roughly at 1,550 including about 700 conscription recruits. Normally they are centred at Kerman with small detachments at—• Bandar Abbas Bam Jiruft Sir jan and Baft.36 This year owing to the rebellion there has been considerable movement of troops chiefly by requisitioned mechanical transport and Sirjan became a more import ant military centre than Kerman. The state of the army is on the whole better than that of other Government departments. There have been nevertheless a number of scandals in connec tion with bribes-taking and high handed action on the part of Military officers. The most prominent cases were the gift of a village to Sartip Ali Shah Khan^ General Officer Commanding Kerman by Saeed Khan a well known robber on the Bandar Abbas-Jiruft-Kerman road and bribe taking at Bam in connection with requisition of animal transport. A Commission of enquiry arrived from Tehran in February to enquire into these matters. At Bam they awarded a sentence of 10 years imprisonment with hard labour to a Naib. They then went to Jiruft where another accused committed suicide rather than face a trial. It looked; as if the G. 0. C. would also be brought to book but by his energetic action against the rebels at Sirjan in June he saved his skin. The last conscription season from November 1928 to July 1929 yielded about '900 recruits out of 2,000 notified as liable. It was extremely unpopular : at least Military Conscription. 5 ^ oommitted suicide. In January one of the recruits set fire to himself with kerosene. He was rescued in time to be given a sound thrashing which ensured his death. The Conscription Committee took bribes right and left with the result that a commission of inquiry was seut from Tehran in April but apparently did not succeed in bringing any charges home. Conscription for the second year re-opened in October. The new Com mittee under the influence of the scandal connected with their predecessors^ ap plied themselves conscientiously to their task. Last year it was the Parsis'who had chiefly paid for exemption. This year it was they who were the first to be enlisted regardless of any claim to ^exemption. This year the total liable to military service was returned at 1,900 out of which 90 were taken. A considerable proportion of motor lorries in Eastern Persia are owned by Indians and as they are generally in a better condition than Persian, owned Requisitioning of motor transport by the V f^^ eS '^ 1 ^ ans been the- Military. chief sufferers m connection with the re- quisitioning of lorries for moving troops. Hie cmei complaints have been on the score of :— (1) Ill-treatment. (2) Not being given time to make necessary adjustments andi repairs. (3) Being kept on the road for long hours at a stretch. (4) Prolonged detention for which no halting allowance is paid. (5) Unfair discrimination in that Persian owned vehicles do not bear their share of commandeering. The Military have fixed a rate of 8 Krans a farsakh which is somewhat below the market rate _ but which would be willingly accepted if the general treatment received was more reasonable. On the other hand the Military justi fiably complain that many drivers deliberately put their cars out of action as soon as there is a rumour of requisitioning. 15. P e? sicrn Bdlucliistafi. This district has been under a military admi- nisti ation with Sarhang Mohammed Khan as Military Grovernor. Bost Mohammed, who at the beginning of the year was at Sarbaz with a i olio wing of about 1,000 surrendered in February and was sent to Tehran. Mohammed Khan has shown considerable ability in governing the Pro vince and in ensuring its tranquility all through the rebellion. His method was to play off the Baluch Sirdars one against the other and at the same time to extend Government's influence without provoking a crisis. Dost Mohammed escaped from Tehran in November but by the close of the year had not made an appearance in Baluchistan. 16. Rudhar. Ziargham-us-Saltaneh still exercises a semi-independent rule in Rudbar and during the rebellion kept his district quiet.. In August it offered the only safe route between Kerman and Bandar Abbas.37 CHAPTER VI. Administration report of the Mehran coast for the year 1929. Personal. —Mr. Gr. E. 0. de Smidt, D.S.O. held political charge of the Mekran coast throughout the year. Gun-running. —500.303 and 10 other rifles and 30,400 rounds of ammunition were reported to have been landed at Soorag and Kuh-i-Mubarak on the Mekran coast during the year. Of this number 500 rifles and 30,000 rounds were brought over by one Mohim bin Mubarak and were said to be destined for Afghanistan and the remainder by a Baluchi named Shahsowar of Chahan who took them to Lashar. Persian Baluchistan. —The province enjoyed unusual tranquility during the year under review. The chief events were as follows :— Soon after the amnesty was granted by the Shah to Mir Dost Mohamed last year, the latter was ordered by the Persians to proceed to Tehran. He set out for Bampur but returned to Sirbaz soon after being dissuaded by his father and brother and the journey was deferred for some months. He wished to take refuge in British territory and for this purpose he sent several messengers to the British Mekran authorities. At the close of the month of February Mir Dost Mohamed left for Duzdab en route to Tehran with the Officer Commanding Bampur. In his absence Persian troops occupied Sarbaz district. When Dost Mohamed reached Tehran, he was kept a political detenu. At the end of Novem ber information was received from Tehran that Dost Mohamed had escaped and was endeavouring to reach the Afghan frontier. The news caused some appre hension among the Persian troops at various places along the coast and pre cautionary measures were adopted in the event of a renewed rising. It was reported that Din Mohamed of Dashtyari was approached by the tribesmen who urged him to lead them against the Persians. Din Mohamed wisely refused. Towards the close of December Dost Mohamed was reported to have been recap tured and brought to Tehran. In March there was a serious disagreement between Sirdar Din Mohamed of Dashtyari and Mir Subhan of Bahu in connection with the recovery of imports from the inhabitants of Gwetter. Mir Subhan induced the inhabitants to remove themselves to Jiunri a neighbouring port in British Mekran. A general exodus took place ; the entire settlement comprising about one hundred houses headed by one Aziz Kolmir adandoned Gwetter and went over to Jiunri. Endeavours were made to persuade the inhabitants to return but they refused to do so unless Persian troops were stationed at Gwetter. Accordingly ten Persian soldiers under a non-commissioned officer were stationed there and subsequently increased to 24 men. The cause of the trouble, a tax of 10 per cent, in kind on fish levied by Sirdar Din Mohamed was eventually removed by orders of the Persian Gov ernment, and the inhabitants of Gwetter then returned to their homes. Several of the Persian Mekran chiefs including Sirdar Din Mohamed and Mir Subhan of Bahu approached the Director and requested permission to settle with their followers in British territory. They all endeavoured to prove that they were British subjects. They were informed that they were Persian subjects and that it was their duty as such to obey the Persian Government -and refer to them any matters regarding their rights and obligations. In June the Persian Commandant at Bampur summoned Sirdar Husain Khan of Gaih, Mohamed Khan of Fanuch, Hoti Khan of Lashar and Mir Ayub Khan of Bint all of whom had remained on good terms with the Persian authorities and abstained from taking active part against them, to meet him at Bampuri Sirdar Husain Khan and Mohamed Khan responded to the call and after interviewing the Officer at Duzdab returned to their districts. It was said that they were given authority to levy a tax of 5 per cent, on grain. About the middle of August a skirmish took place between two headmen Mir Khair Mohamed of Bandaini and Mir Shah Beg of Bir over a slave. There were about 20 men on each side. Mir Khair Mohamed was wounded and one of Shah Beg's men killed. Claims. —Two claims were brought against the Persian Government during the year under report. One was made by a British Indian^ sub ject residing at Charbar for taking possession of his two godowns by the Mudir of Customs. The other was preferred by an employee of this Department also stationed at that LelUFD3S place against the Persian military who are said to have demolished his huts and to have taken possossion of the land ano materials for th© constiuction of a now fort. These claims were brought to the notice of the Political Resident in the Persian Grulf for purpose of representation at Tehran. Telegraph lines.— The telegraph lines between Jask and Charbar were inter rupted durirg the year by wilful damage for 17 hours in the Karwan district. The chiefs concerned Mirs Nagdi and Ayub Khan were communicated with on the matter. Subsidies.—The following chiefs were in receipt of telegraph subsidies during the year. Annual telegrrph subsidy.

At the end of November last, a Baluchi negro slave reported to the Director that his wife and three children were owned by a British Indian subject living at Peshkan near Gwadur and were being illtreated by him. He begged mat they should be freed. They were accordingly relased and came 10 Karachi and applied for the grant of a Manumission certificate. The document was furnished by the Political Agent Muscat. In September two male slaves took refuge with the the Officer Commanding troops at Jask. The owners who belonged to the Karwan district, with ruiiy armed followers requested the Officer Commanding to release the slaves but he refused unless the slaves went of their own accord. The owners threatened that thev would carry off others in exchange if their slaves were not released. Thereupon the Officer Commanding handed the slaves back to the owners who are reported to have bribed him. Wrecks. —In the month of July a dhow belonging to subjects of the Shaikh of Dibai sprung a leak while anchored at Seraoo Khan near Bunji. The cargo consisted of 100 bags rice, twelve boxes silks and perfumes consigned to ports on the Arab coast. Nakhuda landed passengers at Seraoo Khan. The sons ot Mir Oimbar chief of the district took possession of the dhow and cargo on excuse of it being wrecked and claimed salvage. The Persian officials at Jask were k d to take up the matter and a verbal message was sent to Mir Barkat ot39 Biyaban to afford protection. No action was taken by the Persian officials »t'oo-ardin 0 ' the dhow the valuable cargo of which was disposed of by the captors. 11]/13 ark at who is a relative of Mir Qambar seemed reluctant to interfere in -the matter. It is probable that the cargo was intended to be smuggled into Persia. Aviation. —Many aeroplanes including British, French, German, and Dutch •machines landed at Jask during the year. Two Southampton boats landed at Gwadur on the 18th October and left for Karachi the same day. In March when two British Royal Air Force planes engaged in evacuating British and Foreign subjects in Afghanistan landed at Jask for oil fuel, there was some trouble between the Commander of the planes and the Persian Officei Commanding w ho refused the former permission to load petrol on the that the planes were in quarantine and had to wait pratique by the Medical Omcer who did not appear until the planes had left. The matter was represented to His Britannic Majesty's Consul Bunder Abbas. On 6th September the Imperial Airways air liner ' City of Jerusalem ' on her way to India, while making a night landing at Jask, crashed at the aerodrome and caWht fire. The pilot, a mechanic and one passenger died, 2 members ot the crew were injured and the mails were destroyed. The three victims were interred in the telegraph cemetry the following day. A court of enquiry into the accident was held bv Wing Commander Verney and Mr. Lane who arrived from Karachi on the 8th instant. yisifs. Colonel Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, visited Jask in December in I. G. T. S. ' Patrick Stewart '. In January the Chairman of the Junkers Company in Persia came to Jask in a monoplane and left for Bushire the next day. In the second week of March a Persian Surteep and a Captain arrived at Jask from Tehran in a Junkers plane. The Surteep left for Tehran next day in the same machine. Abolitions of capitulations.—The position of the British Indian traders and snbjeets eontinnes to be difficult. With the disappearance of Dost Mohamed there is now some prospect that the Persian Government will he able to establish itself firmly in the country and institute regular courts At present the on j court available is at Bunder Abbas and there is no possibility of enforcing m the Mekran any decree that may be obtained. Tour —The Director left Karachi for a tour of inspection on the 10th January and after visiting all telegraph stations in ^Persian Gulf returned to his headquarters on the 2nd March. He interviewed Sirdar Dm Mohamed at Charbar and Mirs Hoti and Mustafa Khan at Jask. . A memorandum on the condition of the country between Jask and Gwadur is appended. J ash. Mr. W. C. Janes was Superintendent in charge of the telegraph station throughout the year. Persian officials.— In the absence of a Deputy Governor whose appointment is still vacant, his duties have been carried on by the Officer Commanding^troops whose methods of administration were most despotic Several compa^ sent to Tehran against his action and it was rumoured that he was shortly removed Mirza Adamy was Mudir of Customs till 4th January when he was relieved by Mirza Ahmed. The latter held his office till 7th November when he was relieved in turn by Mirza Aziz. Besides the aforesaid persons, there is a Quarantine Medical Officer here. Persian qarrison.-TUs consists at present of 22 infantry under a Naib. Ot this number ten men have been sent, to old Jask for ^ Purple of wate hl „ g tl ie movements of the chiefs and the remainder is quartered m the Persian loit. Police —yawar Mustafa Khan and one Assistant arrived here on the 22nd November with the object of establishing a police force. Thejr intended to enlist locally 30 men but so far only 10 men have joined up. It is believed that the Officer has applied to Tehran to enforce conscription.40 British Navy. —H. M. S. ' Triad ' with the Senior Naval Officer on board arrived at Jask on 27th November and left the following day. French sloop ' Diana ' visited the port on the 4th February and left for Muscat on the next day. Taxes. —In the beginning of December, the Mudir of Customs demanded customs duty on all articles imported by the telegraph staff who are exempted from these duties under the Jask agreement. The matter was represented to Tehran. No decision was arrived at when the year closed. Charhar. • Mr. M. S. de Souza continued as Clerk-in-Charge of the station until 30th March when he was relieved by Mr. L. L. Harding. The latter was succeeded by Mr, A. W. Halkett, M.B.E., on 16th June for the remainder of the year. Sirdar Din Mohamed Khan has been nominally the local governor of Charbar on the part of the Persian Government. Early in June, with a few retainers he proceeded to Duzdab via Karachi to place his grievances before Sarhang Mohamed Khan who is in military command of Persian Baluchistan. The result of the interview has not transpired. He returned to Charbar in the middle of October. While at Karachi on his return journey he purchased a motor car which he took to Charbar for the purpose of motoring Sarhang Mohamed Khan about the district when he arrived. Sirdar Din Mohamed is considerably in debt to various British Indian traders, who notwithstanding repeated warnings in the past not to lend money to the chiefs and people of the country, are providing him with money. The chief has been promised a salary by the Persian Government but it is believed that nothing has so far been paid to him. The position of Din Mohamed and the other chiefs is difficult. They are forbidden to levy taxes, but have no other method of supporting their position. Shahdad Abbas, A British Indian Subject, continues to be Sirdar Din Mohamed's Wali at Charbar. Persian Customs. —Mirza Essa was the Mudir of Customs until 26th May when he was relieved by Mirza Ali. The latter was in charge of the Customs when the year closed. In April a notice in the name of the Shah was posted in the bazar that the taxes previously imposed by Sirdar Din Mohamed on goods going overland had ceased. At the close of September a complaint was made by one of the British Indian traders residing at this port that his sugar on which duty had; already been paid, was confiscated by the local customs department on the pretext that the article was smuggled into the place. The complainant produced the declaration before the Mudir but without success. The matter was eventually brought to the notice of the Provincial Director of Customs who issued instructions to the Mudir to return the sugar to the owner. Persian garrison. —The strength of the Persian troops is said to be 100 men under the command of a First Naib. Ali Akbar Khan was in command until 2nd August when he was relieved by Mohamed Khan. Ali Akbar Khan left for Duzdab via Karachi on 13th September. On the 5th November Sultan Ibrahim Khan arrived from Duzdab via Karachi and assumed command of the detachment. He is combining the duties of Governor with that of Officer Commanding the troops. Din Mohamed being disregarded. Shipping. —In August owing to the outbreak of cholera in Sind, the Persian Medical Officer prohibited the landing and exporting of cargo from Charbar. This caused considerable inconvenience to the people. But on the declaration of Karachi being free from the disease, the orders were cancelled. Gwadur. Mr. Waris Ali was the British Agent here throughout the year except for a short period when he proceeded on leave. Wall, —Ali bin Hamud was the Wali of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat at Gwadur throughout the year. Sultania Customs. —Seyed Ahmed Effendi continued to hold charge of the Sultan's customs during the year.41 The wall of the customs house which is situated on the beach was washed away by a storm in the summer and as no repairs have been carried out, the goods of the merchants were damaged to a certain extent by the heavy rain falls that occurred during the month of December. The relations between the British Indian traders and the Director of the Sultan's customs seem to have been cordial during the year. Police.—As' a result of there being no police force at (xwadur, four thefts were reported during the year. The victims in each case were British Indian traders. One Shakar Ali who during the riots stole some clothes, etc., from the house of a Khoja, was arrested in Pasni while disposing of them. For this he was tried by the Naib Wazir-i-Azam Kalat State at Turbat and subsequently sent to Gwadur. While in the Wali's custody he managed to escape to Ormara where he was re-arrested and sent to Muscat to be tried by the Political Agent there. Riots. —On the 24th March communal trouble occurred between iSunni sub jects of the Sultan and Khoja British Indian subjects over a Sunni mosque which had been desecrated. The Khoja community was blamed for this act and in the disturbance which ensued a Khoja died of a pistol wound, another Khoja was wounded by a sword and two others beaten by lathis. Three of the Sultan's subjects were arrested and placed in custody by the Wali and six Khojas were detained in the building of the British Agent Gwadur pending enquiry of the case by a Sultan's official. The Khoja community closed their shops and remained shut up'in their Jamaat Khana. The funeral of the deceased Khoja occurred without an incident. A number of levies were sent from Muscat to Gwadur and had a good effect in restoring confidence. A sharii court enquiry was held by a Qazi specially sent from Muscat for the purpose. He took to Muscat one Essa accused of shooting the deceased Khoja and also two women who were Sultan's subjects. The Khojas who were detained in the building of the British Agent were released. As the enquiry held by the Qazi was deemed inadequate, in the month of May, Mr. B. S. Thomas and Major G. P. Murphy the Political Agent Muscat arrived at Gwadur and made an exhaustive enquiry into the riots. They submitted their reports direct. Navy.—-IL M. S. ' Cyclamen ' called at Gwadur on the 25th November 1929. She left for Bombay after taking mail bags and pro-visions.. Bain-falls. —Heavy rains fell at Gwadur towards the close of the year with the result that many houses collapsed. The water that collected in the irrigation reservoir on the neighbouring hill broke its embankment and flowed into the sea, causing much loss of revenue.- Locusts.—A flight of locusts appeared both in British and Persian Mekran during the year and caused considerable harm to the harvests. Owing to the famine that followed, many people emigrated to India via Gwadur. M emorandum on the condition op the districts between J ask and G wadur. Jask district. Mir Mustafa Khan and Mir Hoti control this district but are practically powerless owing to Mustafa Khan's sons Murad Khan and Chiragh Khan who have a large following each, and seek every possible means of extorting money, etc., from the poorer and weaker inhabitants. The latter are entirely at the mercy of these arbitrary sons. The Officer Commanding Troops Jask has not been able to exercise any authority in their area. Biyahan district. This district is governed by Mir Barkat Khan whose attitude towards the British Government is very cordial, and he is also on good terms with the Persian Government. He has the reputation of managing the internal affaiis of his district much better than other tribal chiefs and he is very popular among the inhabitants. The Persian Government have now decided to disarm all the tribesmen and Mir Barkat has been called upon to surrender 600 rifles. This he is most reluctant to do and he is reported to have the intention of crossing over to the Arab coast. LclUED42 Bint district. This district is under the joint control of Mir Nagdi Khan, Mir Aynh Khan and Yahya Khan. None of these three chiefs appears to have any influence over their followers It was reported that the Persian General Officer Com manding Bampur had despatched a force to the Bint district and had occupied ta m® ^ d 3 oi ° in ^ yiUages. Mir Ayub Khan despatched a messenger to Sirdar Dm Mohamed asking him whether he should evict them and if he could rely upon him for support if he attacked the Persian troops. Sirdar Dm Mohamed is reported to have replied that he could not support him ut if he (Mir Ayub) was of the opinion that he was strong enough to drive t em out of the Bmt district, he could proceed. As is usually the case with the H I 8 / Baludnstan nothmg was done and the p ersian t g were enabled to consolidate their positions. Karwan district. It is nominally under the control of Mir Ayub and Mir Na^di Khan. The numerous petty chiefs of this district do not recognise either Mir Ayub or Mir man aS r ^ irc * ar - Each little village is apparently ruled by its, head- Gaih district. ,. }\is mder the control of Sirdar Husain Khan. He is the second strongest chief m Persian Baluchistan next to Sirdar Din Mohamed of Dashtyari. DasJityari district. It is under the control of Sirdar Din Mohamed who is responsible to the Persian Government now for the whole of the Dashtyari district. Minor chiefs under him are Mir Durra Khan of Dashtyari, and Mir Suhhan Khan and Mir imed Khan of Bahu. The last three chiefs prior to the appointment by the Persian Government of Sirdar Din Mohamed as Governor of Charbar, more or less controlled their respective territories hut now Sirdar Din Mohamed holds sw ay and the three last named chiefs take orders from him. It is one of the few districts that the Persian troops have not occupied but it was reported that during the winter of this year they intend marching troops ~gh it. Outside Charbar and Gwetter, there are no Persian troopl in this Bahu di The district is under the joint control of Mir Subhan Khan and Mir Ahmed Khan who are responsible to Sirdar Din Mohamed. These two chiefs are of little influence and nothing of importance occurred in this dietrict during the43 CHAPTER VII. Administration Report of the Poli Personnel^ The posts of Political Agent and H.

The Muscat Infantry was lined up at the top of the Riyam Pass where the procession of cars stopped and His Highness alighted and made a speech complimenting the Muscat Infantry on their work. His Highness has also taken a keen interest in the improvement of the town. The late Saiyid Muhammad bin Turki's house situated on the western end of the front of the town, which was in ruins, has been demolished and a few other unsightly buildings have also been acquired and demolished.

About the same time, a Baluch carrying water from Sanaislah to Sur was kidnapped by two of the Meshaikh. The man was rescued by a party of Bani Omar but the kidnappers escaped. One of the kidnappers was reported to be Ali bin Rashid who kidnapped the Hindu Kurshandas Lalji in 1925, and who has threatened to kidnap one of Khimji Ramdas's men or loot his shop in Sur. On the 4th February, Amir Muhammad bin Nasir of the Bani Bu Ali was killed in an affray with the Bani Bu Hassan. He was a man of considerable personality and his ambitions were at the root of the recent troubles. The Amir Ali bin Abdullah, who had left for Mecca in November 1928, was reported to have interviewed King Ibn Saud and to have left Jeddah for Massowa in July. From Massowa he proceeded to Egypt. He arrived in Aden in September and called on the Resident handing him a letter for the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, virtually demanding to be recognised as independent of Muscat. He returned to Jaalan in the beginning of November. Sheikh Said bin Sultan al Majaala who was appointed Tamimah Sheikh of the Jenebeh tribe by the Council of Ministers last year, came to Muscat towards the end of October in order to impress on the Council the necessity for dealing with Sur affairs. In November, a slave belonging to the Bani Bu Ali was killed by one of the Bani Omer. A party of Bani Bu Ali made a raid on Bani Bu Hassan territory and killed 4 slaves. The Bani Bu Ali wrote to Khimji Ramdas warning him not to send any caravans into the interior as they were about to close the road and fight the Baiii Bu Hassan. Gwadur.-^On the 25th March, bad feeling between the Agha Khanis and Baluchis at Gwadur, owing to the desecration of a mosque, culminated in a disturbance in which one Agha Khani was shot dead and various persons received minor injuries.

General. —The Hon'ble the Political Resident, accompanied by the Political Agent, Bahrain, and an Air Force Officer visited Ras al Khaimah on the 11th May, by air, and exchanged visits with the Ruler of the place. Thb Hon'ble the Political Resident made a tour of the Trucial Oman in July. He left Bushire by fast mail on the 21st July and transferred to H. M. S. ' Triad ' off Farur Island. Personnel. —Khan Bahadur Isa bin Abdul Latif continued to hold charge of the post of the Residency Agent. He was awarded the honour of the 44 O.B.E.'' for his good services in connection with the suppression of the slave traffic. Pearling. —The catch was inferior to that of last year, and the market low. Owing to financial difficulties, many boats did not put to sea, and pearlers like Muhammad bin Biyat and Muhammad bin Ahmad Dalmuk were on the verge of bankruptcy. Haji Muhammad Ali Zainal Reza had last year purchased on credit pearls worth several lakhs from various Pearl merchants on the Trucial Oman, but the pearls remained unsold in Paris. One of the victims was the pearler Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Dalmuk. Not receiving his money to equip his fleet he was obliged to raise about Rs. 2,00,000 from a Hindu merchant at an interest of 36 per cent. This prima facie is an exorbitant rate, but the risks of money lending on the Trucial Coast are extremely high. Relations with Bin Saud. —No activities of King Bin Saud's Agent at Baraimi in interfering in the Trucial Oman affairs have been reported during the year. This may be due to his good intentions or to his pre-occupation elsewhere, Sharjah. —Ruler : Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar Al Qasimi. The Manasir bedouins frequently raided the outskirts of Sharjah. Shaikh Abdur Rahman bin Muhammad, uncle of the Ruler of Sharjah, returned from Aden, the remaining portion of his deportation having been con doned by the G-overnment of India, on the Ruler's undertaking that the Sheikh would behave well in future. While the two Germans (mentioned under Dihai below) were being escorted by the messengers of the Residency Agent to Dibai, fidawis of the Ruler of Sharjah first fired on them, then seized them, and disarmed the party. H. M. S. Lupin ', however, appeared on the scene and the Shaikh was asked to punish the transgressors. A fine of Rs. 2,000 was levied on the culprits. Dibai. —Ruler : Shaikh Saeed bin Maktum al Hashar. The Shaikh has been friendly, although he has not as yet agreed to allow petrol being stored at Dibai for the Royal Air Force machines that visit Trucial Oman. Two German deserters from the Foreign Legation, Syria, reached Dibai on the 12th April in a sailing boat from the Persian Coast and landed between Dibai and Sharjah. They were eventually sent to India to be despatched to Germany. On the 15th April the nephews of the Ruler of Dibai engineered a mild cup d'etat in Dibai. They told Shaikh Saeed that they did not want him and apptoint- ed his cousin Mana bin Rashid as Ruler of Dibai. The matter, however, was amicably settled by H. M. S. ' Lupin ', and the Residency Agent, under instruc tions from the Political Resident, and Shaikh Saeed continued to hold his position as Ruler. Ajman. —Ruler : Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid. Owing to feuds between the Ruler and the Al Bu Shamis Beduoins, the latter raid Ajman territory from time to time. ^ Doctor Dame of the American Mission, Bahrein, at the request of some patients paid a visit to Ajman, Hamiyah, and Dibai in the month of January and made successful operations. Ahu Dhahi. —Ruler : Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan. Considerable correspondence took place with this Shaikh over a manumitted slave Farhan bin Sarfish, who held a Manumission Certificate from the Political Agent, Muscat, but was re-enslaved in Abu Dhiabi, and over a Baluchi woman and her son Ahmad bin Hassan, who were sold in the town. Eventually pressure being brought to bear, he delivered Farhan and the woman, but Ahmad bin47 Hassan is still at the end of the year a slave in his territory and efforts to get him released continue. The difficulty lies in the fact that Ahmad is in the hands of the Manasir bedouins over whom the Shaikh has no control. Ras al Khaimah. —Ruler : Shaikh Sultan bin Salim. The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah has remained hostile throughout the year in his attitude towards the Royal Air Force refuelling base in his territory. Temporary arrangements were made to keep the petrol in a dhow in the harbour. Hope is entertained that he may adopt a more friendly attitude in due course. On the 19th November a woman took refuge in the house of the Residency Agent at Ras al Khaimah, occupied by his sons Said and Abdur Rahman. On the same night the woman's brother with three other armed men attempted to kidnap her from the house. Said and Abdur Rahman resisted the attack and in the struggle the woman was stabbed with a dagger by one of the kidnappers. As the prestige of the British Agent was involved the Senior Naval Officer with the concurrence of the Political Resident had the affair investigated by the Commander of H. M. S. u Crocus who prevailed upon the Ruler to punish the culprits, and they were flogged. The woman recovered from her wound. Umm al Quwain. —Ruler : Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashid. On the 9th February, Shaikh Hamad bin Ibrahim, Ruler of Umm al Quwain was shot and killed in his fort by a slave, at the instigation, it is said, of his blind uncle Abdur Rahman who lived with him and of some third party. The next day the fort was attacked by the populace, who succeeded in breaching the wall and setting the building on lire. Abdur Rahman and the slave were killed. Ahmad bin Rashid, cousin of the murdered Shaikh Hamad was proclaimed as the Ruler of Umm al Quwain. He is a lad of about 18 years. He has been advised to treat the two sons of the deceased well. It may be mentioned here that Abdullah bin Rashid, brother of the new Shaikh, was murdered on October 10th, 1927, when the late Hamad bin Ibrahim became Shaikh. Hamiryah. —Headman : Shaikh Abdur Rahman bin Said. The Shaikh has adopted a friendly attitude and offered to make a dump for the petrol for the Royal Air Force in his town. The question of recognising him independent of the Sharjah Shaikh has been raised and is under consideration. General Remarks. —The Trucial Coast is extensive, its Shaikhs suspicious of Western interference and its people lawless and backward. Nevertheless, to the extent that British responsibilities and interests are involved, the chief^ of which is the suppression of Slave Trade, our present arrangements—the exist- ance of a Residency Agent at Sharjah working under the direct orders of the Political Resident—would appear to be adequate. Communication with the Trucial Coast, however, both personal and postal is not easy, the Resident can only visit that section of his charge at rare intervals and the possibility of the erection of a wireless installation at Sharjah or Dibai is being considered. Persian Government and Trucial Oman. —The Persian authorities in the Persian ports have continued to treat the Arabs of Trueial Oman visiting Persia as Persian subjects and to charge them the full fee of a Persian Tazkerah on landing ashore. TVhile leaving, they have been granted a billet- de passage , which is used for a journey from one place in Persia to another. In January Hamad bin Dalmuk and other Arabs of his party migrated from Henjam and settled at Ras al Khaimah.48 CHAPTER IX. Administration Report of the Bahrain Agency for the year 1929. Personnel. —Lieut.-Colonel C. C. J. Barrett, held charge of the Agency till the 28th April, when Captain C. Gr. Prior took over. Khan Bahadur Sayyid Siddiq Hasan was India Assistant throughout the year. Ruler of Bahrain and the Al-Khalifah Family. —Shaikh Sir Isa has been friendly in his attitude, and has not shown any disposition to question the pre sent regime. His truculent wife, the ' Queen ' Ayesha was absent on Haj for a part of the year and is said to have been much gratified by the notice taken of her there as a result of a letter of good offices given by Colonel Barrett, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa, the Deputy Ruler has been on the best of terms with the Agency througibout the year. His distaste of work in any form is increasing and it is becoming more and more difficult to get him to make a decision. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa has been of great assistance to the Bahrain Gov ernment. He has more push and go than all the rest of his family put together, and since he exerting his influence more and more on the side of good Govern ment, much is to be hoped of him in the future- Shaikh Muhammad bin Isa returned from Lingah in January and was obliged to part with his gold watch and other bribes to avoid taking out a Per sian jawaz. Later he went to India for three months and spent most of the time at Bombay. He was given a free trip to Rangoon by the B. I. S. N. Company which he much enjoyed. As President of the Manama Municipal Committee he is quite useless, more from mental incapacity than anything else. Shaikh Salman bin Hamad has been doing steady and useful work as Joint Magistrate and Judge of the Bahrain Courts He is hard working and sensible and will make a useful Judge when he has more confidence. Shaikh Rashid bin Muhammad, the father-in-law of Shaikh Hamad has be come President of the Majlis el Urfi, and is doing well. Certain other members of the Al-Khalifah family have been employed in posts of lesser importance. Bahrain State. —Captain Parke went on leave on the 21st March and re turned on the 12th October. In his absence, Mr. Belgrave carried out the duties of Commandant of Police. On the whole Sunni-Shiah relations have been satisfactorv throughput the year, but in Muharram it was reported that the Perisians in Muharraq had com menced holding processions, and were behaving in a provocative manner. The Political Agent requested them to desist and they did so. A result of the persecution of Bahama at Muhammerah has been to estrange Bahrain Shiahs from Persian Shiahs, and the two communities have little in common now. Ali bin Abdullah and Ali bin Jafar were appointed Shiah Qadhis, the former for the town of Manama and the latter for the villages. During Mav an agitation was set on foot to bring about the return of Shaikh Khalaf the ex-Shiah Qadhi, now at Kerbela. The agitation was ignored and eventually subsided. It will be remembered that the Bahrain Government attempted three years ago to form Waqf Committees but were obliged to give up the idea on account of the outcry raised. T!he Shiahs voluntarily decided to form one in May and it has_ done excellent work. Many unsuspected Waqfs have been discovered, and an income of some 50,000 rupees has already been secured. The outstanding event of the year in the internal affairs of the State were the trial of certain members of the Al-Khalifah family for offences committed * between 3 and 8 years ago. By a stroke of luck the Police had been able to lay their handis on a gang of men who had carried out many murderous attacks on Bahrain villages, and being foreigners, they had been sentenced in the Agency Court to life sentences. It was conclusively shown that they had been instigated to these acts by certain Al- Khalifah, and since it was most undesirable that the instigators should escape scot free, Shaikh Hamad was pressed to deal with them. This he was very loth to do, but ^ patience will subdue tigers and Numidian lions ', and he finally allowed the Bahrain Court to take up the cases. Shaikh Abdullah was added to the Court, and all three Al-Khalifah were found guilty.49 Shaikh Ibrahim bin Khalid was convicted of instigating the attempt o Shaikh Hamad's life three years ago, but Shaikh Hamad curiously too action on the Court's decision and the would-be assasm shortly afterwards wei } to live with him at Sakihir, _ ... . Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah al Ghattam was convicted of instigating an beino present at the attack on Farsia in which two of his tenants were murdered. He was made to pay Es. 7,500, blood money.

LciUFD50 The American Mission maintained two day schools, one for boys and tlie other for girls. The girls school suffered from the opening of a Government girls school and lost almost all its pupils. The Rev- Mr. Hakken also takes night classes in English. Bahrain Police .Force.—The members of the Indian Police dwindled to 85 y and Arabs were maintained at 24.- A force of some 150 naturs or night-watch men also exists. Public security has been g'ood throughout the year, exce'pt for a demonstration of 200 divers at Muharraq demanding increased advances and a riot at Hedd over two boys of easy virtue. There were 201 prisoners in the State Jail during the year, a marked decrease on former years. Trade. —The year was a poor one for the pearling industry. The catch was good, (one remarkable pearl worth over a lakh being found) but the leading buyers combined to keep prices down, and the slump in Wall Street had a dis astrous effect on sales after the season. Merchants who took their pearls to India are not believed to have sold half of them, and it is feared that condi tions may be worse next year. The total value of trade amounted to Rs. 4,04,45,915, as compared with Rs. 3,71,26,590 in the preceding year. The total value of Imports amounted to Rs. 2,67,51,467 as against Rs. 2,50,79,350 in the preceding year. The Exports amounted to 1,36,94,448 as against 1,20,47,240 in the preceding' year, but this figure is not accurate since few of the pearls exported are declared at the proper value, if declared at all. The prices have come down in the boat building industry, and a number of launches were made. Kelvin engines upto 72 H.P. are successfully put into locally made hulls, and appear quite satisfactory. 130 British and 10 German ships entered the port during the year, as com pared with 96 British and 7 German vessels during the past year. The increase in British ships is principally due to the more frequent arrival of Strick-Eller- man vessels, the Persian Customs difficulties having made transhipment at Bunder Abbas impossible. The change is all to the advantage of Bahrain, and though the Strick cargoes are not heavy, they will no doubt increase. The Government of Bahrain decided not to allow Russian steamers to call at Bahrain. The S.S. Barenfels of the Hansa Line ran aground on the Fasht AdhbaL This is the third stranding on this reef in three years, and a ^powerful light is urgently required either on the Fasht Adhbal or somewhere on the 10 fathom line to the nortlh 1 of it. The tonnage of the vessels entering Bahrain is a quarter of the tonnage of vessels entering the port of Basra (excluding Abadan) but though the Basra lights are innumerable Bahrain has but two. The matter is being represented. The following visit's were paid by His Majesty's Ships :— 14-16th January H.M.S. Triad. 1st April, H.M.S. Lupin. 18th April, H.M.S. Crocus. 1st June, H.M.S. Triad. 1st June, H.M.S. Lupin. 4th November, H.M.S. Triad. 4th and 6tih November, Crocus. The French Armed Yacht ' Diana ' paid a visit to Bahrain from the 30th to 31st January. Boyal Air Force. —The Royal Air Force mooring were laid on the 5th to 12th March, and the first flight of two planes took place on the 18th April. The Roval Air Force eventually decided to purchase the quarantine station as a Rest Camp, and have entered into negotiations regarding the aerodrome which have not yet been concluded. The negotiations were complicated by the fact that the Royal Air Force did not realise how extremely valuable land has become recently.51 , A nmnber of flights were made during the year, and Mr. Habib Rosenthal chartered an Imperial Airways Liner to bring him down from Basra on the 16th Augnst- Shaikhs IVtuhammad, Salman, Alubarak, and the Adviser flew out to a pearling bank. _ In December the Royal Air Force delivered four Wapitis at Darin for the Ilcjaz Aii I 01 ce and the pilots and mechanics were flown down in Southamp- tons. Post Office.—A branch of the Indian Post Office is established in the Agency buldmg, but it does not deliver letters at the residence of addresses. 3,987 re gistered letters were posted on 5,057 received and 346 parcels were posted and 8,122 received. Rs. 9,085 worth of stamps were sold. Cash Certificates to the amount of Rs. 12,570 were sold, and 655, worth discharged. Postal Orders to the extent of 768 were sold and 15|12 paid. Rs. 2,21,468 worth of money orders were issued and 8,909-8-6 paid. Savings Bank Deposits and withdrawals were 29,507 and 14,298 respec tively. The number of Civil Suits filed in the Agency were 1,527 and that of criminal 1309-MiiScellaneous cases numbered 113 and petitions 1,949. Criminal cases 'were mainly common assaults or thefts, but there were several Sessions cases * of murderous assaults, and one of murder. Medical. Assistant Surgeon R.

The former places little reliance on His Majesty's Government and pays a hand some retaining fee to Bin Sand yearly to be on the safe side. Slaves.- —27 slaves were manumitted during the past year. Climate. —The summer was cool for later than usual, but the autumn did not cool till later than usual. 2.10 inches of rain fell during the year. Owing to the rebellion and opening up of Nejd, the arrival of the Royal Air Force and the Hedjaz Air Force, and the multitudinous additions to the days work, the Agency has carried on with the greatest difficulty during past year. The staff is that of 1912, and the work has doubled. Representations have been made which it is sincerely trusted ill receive favourable attention, for failing some assistance work will inevitably come to a standstill. In 1912 the Political Agent complained that pressure of routine made it difficult for him to meet Arabs, and the situation is far worse now.54 CHAPTER X. Administration Report of the Kuwait Political Agency for the year 1929. Personnel. —Lieutenant-Colonel J. C. More, C.I.E., D.S.O., held charge of the Political Agency from 1st January 1929 to the 22nd May 1929, on which date he was relieved by Lieutenant-Colonel H. R. P. Dickson, C.I.E. Assistant Surgeon A. L. Greenway, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., I.M.D., was in medical charge of the Agency Charitable Dispensary and performed the duties of Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year. The Ruling Family.-^On the 8th April 1929 His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Subah, C.S.I,, C-I.E., Ruler of Kuwait proceeded to Basrah by a flying boat, and returned again on the 9th April also by air. On June 3rd 1929, the anniversary of H. M. the King Emperor's Birthday, His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Subah received the title of C.S.I. The conferring of this high honour on their Ruler gave very great satisfaction to the people of Kuwait, and was undoubtedly richly deserved. Shaikh Subah an-Nasir, cousin of His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Subah, C.S.I., C.I.E., who shot his brother Abdullah on 14th December 1928, as the result of a personal quarrel over a motor car, was released from prison by His Excellency the Ruler on 27th July, after having served a sentence of a little over 7 months' close imprisonment. The Shaikh of Kuwait was averse to releasing him, but great pressure was brought to bear on him to do so, by the other members of the as-Subah family and by the leading notables of Kuwait. Hiis Excellency bowed to the pressure of public opinion and ordered Shaikh Subah's release. Much rejoicing was observed in the house of the forgiven Shaikh Subah, and the poor of the Town were publicly fed at his expense for 'a week after the event. After his release Shaikh Subah retired into the desert with his camels and now spends much of his time with the Dhafir tribe of 'Iraq. This retirement was undoubtedly intended as a form of banishment by the Ruler to permit of the affair blowing over. General—The artesian well which the Ruler was having bored under the advice and control of Major F. Holmes of the Eastern General Syndicate Ltd., to the east of the Town, proved to be a failure and in February 1929 it was decided to abandon it. Major F. Holmes left for the United Kingdom on the 16th February. In March, the Eastern General Syndicate Ltd., presented to His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Subah, C.S.I., C.LE., a 20 h.p. six cvlinder Sunbeam ' enclosed Limousine car, priced at £950. The car was delivered on 24th March and gave much satisfaction. Mr. G. H. Armstrong assistant to Major F. Holmes remained behind in Kuwait* to watch the Company's interests.. He left Kuwait on the 24th June 1920. During February the L.T. ' Nearchus installed at the dangerous Ras al- Ardh headland, a proper disolved acetylene lantern with a sun actuating valve, on the Government Beacon existing there, in place of the old oil lamp. This has been an inestimable boon to shipping since. The field wireless set which was installed in Kuwait for the use of the Special Service Officer during his stay in Kuwait during the winter months was with draw on the 19th May but again installed on the 20th June on the return of the Special Service Officer to Kuwait- The Birthday of H. M. the King Emperor was celebrated on the 3rd June. The Agency Flagstaff and that of His Excellency the Ruler was dressed in honour of the day' Alms were distributed to the poor by the Political Agent in the morning, and in the evening he entertained His Excellency the Ruler and seventy of the leading notables of the Town to a banquet. During the month of June and when the Qashqai rebellion was at its height around Shiraz, Kuwait was accused by the Persian Government of supplying arms and ammunition to the rebelis. It is probable that the story was merely a fiction and ^ canard ' raised by the local Persian officials to account for their lack of success against the Qashqai tribesmen. His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait had little difficulty in proving the charge to be untrue. In June of the year under review confidential enquiries were made in Kuwait as to whether the Shaikh would allow the line of Russian steamers which plies in the Persian Gulf to make Kuwait a port of call. Later in the autumn55 a similar request was o'penly made to the ShaiMh. by a Persian firm which has its chief office in Mohammerah, the Ruler needless to say refused permission, after the dangers of so doing had been pointed out to him. On the 26th July the Special Service Officer finally left Kuwait taking with him his field wireless set. In August His Excellency the Shaikh was asked his views as to the intro duction of Passports for Kuwait. After careful consideration he replied saying he preferred, at any rate for the present, not to start such an innovation, as it mi 0 'ht end in many of his own subjects claiming foreign nationality. Certi ficates of Identity continue therefore to be issued by this Agency to persons desirino- to travel. Applicants in every case bringing a letter from the Ruler s Secretary, permitting their departure. The checking of persons arriving at Kuwait is still not satisfactory- It is hoped to improve matters m this direc tion during 1930. Condition of m Country and the Rebe Neji. —Early m January the situation in Nejd was extremely obscure, and various rumours diltered so mucli that it became difficult to sift the truth from the false. There could be little doubt however that the relations between Bin Saud and the Akhwan leaders were becoming more and more strained, and his task of preventing them from attacking the 'Iraq Desert Posts was becoming harder from day to day. Bm Saud had even found it necessary to issue orders for Jubail, Qatif, etc., to bo fortified and provisioned, as a precaution. On the other hand there were in dications that considerable ill-feeling existed between ibn Humaid and ibn Rubai'an the two most powerful Shaikhs of the great Ataibah tribe, which Bin Saud could be trusted to take the fullest advantage of. On January 21st Dhaidan ibn Hathlain the clever old Shaikh of the Ajman moved up into Kuwait with a mixed force ma theBatm with the intention m ; it Mnntnfin ^hpcD tribes ramped in the Northern portion of Kuwait. it!? £ ± m ' aai rs-' ,=? United States Minister in China, met a portion of the raiding party, with the result that their car was fired on and Mr. Bilkert was killed- Farlv in February it was learned that Faisal al-Duwish had gone to mediate his standard, 1 and awaited the coming of ibn Hathlain, al-Fuqm, and others to join Thp uncertainty of events about this time and the fear that something bi^ everywhere Ucamllsliul some sheep were stolen from tlie lot ' and recovered the stolen animals. of the oountry tlie KuW ait-Basrah road was closed for a montl ^at this^ieriod, and mails were sent and received by sea. On the 3rd March 'oad^lt firing being heard a short dista • ^ ^ Ban i Malik, an 'Iraq shepherd transpired that an encampmen neighbourhood of Basrah and Zubair, had tribe whose summer range is in the ne ^f b f x U ^ 0 dr ed Mutair raiders under ibn heen attacked at dawn by a P ar &gt; m nl viikh barely seven miles from Kuwait.

Thirty of f a^hes ^ - The losg of the raiders waa equal J if LTmore tlan that of the shepherds, and in the Royal Air Force56 pursuit which followod they suffered further casualties. The raiders however got away with all their loot. The raiders were away again before anyone from Ivuwait could help but the people of the Town treated the destitute tribesmen very kindly, raised money, food, etc., for them and eventually repatriated a portion of the survivors to the number of 150 in sailing boats to Khuwair on the 13th March. The remainder being sent on 14th March to join their compatriots to the north of Kuwait under Police car escort. On the 9th March a patrol of 'Iraq Police cars approaching the Kuwait Nejd frontier at Riqai, were suddenly attacked by 40 horsemen. The attack was beaten off with loss. The Police cars retired north being followed some distance by enemy horsemen. On the 14th March two flocks of sheep numbering 500 head, belonging to Kuwait tribesmen who were camped on the Mutlaa close to Jahrah, were carried off by a party of horsemen belonging to the Zaiyad tribe of 'Iraq. Through the instrumentality of Captain Grlubb, Inspecting Officer Southern 'Iraq Desert the animals were eventually recovered and the ringleaders punished. The above few examples illustrate the general lawless state prevailing in the hinterland about this period, and only important cases have been mentioned. About this time it became clear that Bin Saud who had moved up into Qasim determined to once and for all settle with his recalcitrant generals ibn Humaid and I aisal al-Duwish. He pitched his camp and that of his army in the immediate vicinity of the forces of these two leaders, and by daily conference endeavoured to bring about a settlement of their disputes with himself by means of the Religious Law. The third great Akhwan general ibn Hathlain with ibn Shuqair and ibn Lami by previous arrangement lay camp at the south end of the Shaqq depression near Jarriya, guarding the Akhwan left flank from a possible attack by Fahad ibn Jaloui whose forces were in north Hassa. The powerful Awazim of Hassa remained loyal to Bin Saud. ' In April reports reached Kuwait that after a final parley with al-Duwish, and an unsuccessful attempt to induce him and ibn Humaid to see reason ani come m, Ibn Saud without warning advanced from Zilfi, attacked the two Akhwan leaders at Sibbila on the morning of 29th March and inflicted a sharp dereat on them ; Faisal al-Duwish who it seems was under the impression that negotiations were still in progress was taken unawares and shot without fighting. Mis ^ ound was in the stomach and serious and he was sent to Artawiyeh by Bin baud's orders. Ibn Humaid who was not taken by surprise having a strong • fo ^ e with him made his way to Ghat Ghat but was followed by Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman ibn Sand's brother to whom he eventually surrendered without lighting. Later accounts of this rather mysterious battle showed Bin Saud up in rather bad light, for it appears certain that his sudden attack on both; al-Duwish and ibn Humaid, was launched after solemn promise had been made the previous night that they should meet once again and discuss matters according to Sharia. There can be little doubt that Bin Saud won the day by an act of ugly treachery, and the subsequent rebellion headed by al-Duwish, and which put Bin Saud to so much expense and trouble, was entirely due to the above breach of faith, for an Arab does not forget. - p was as mentioned above not present at Sabiliah and, as a result ot babilla regained the leadership over the whole of the Ajman. This veteran bliaikh had temporarily lost influence as a result of ibn Jaloui, the Governor of ilassa's intrigues. 2nd Farnan ibn Mashur ash-Shaalan of the Anaize another promi nent Akhwan leader and late favourite of Bin Saud, arrived at Subaihiyeh at tlie southern end of Kuwait with a large number of camels which he had plundered irom ibn Musaad, the Governor of Hail, as well as others taken from Shammar and the Dahamshah in recent raids. On the 4th of May he moved to Jahrah and was interviewed by His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait. He gave out that ne had leceived safe conduct from Bin Saud, and that he had sent messengers to mm to learn the terms Bin Saud would offer if he came in. Tne t-phaikh of Kuwait acting under orders of His Majesty's Government ordered him to leave Jahrah on 12th May, after supplying himself with the pro visions he required to take him and his party to Bin Sand's camp. He crossed the frontier at Qrain on the morning of the 14th, but instead of going to BinSand as \v$s thmight he would be proceeded to join the Ajman in middle Hassft. There is little doubt that he changed lus mind as a result of the incident men- tioiied in the Succeeding paragraphs P. 11 30t j 1 H 16 ^ ct of treachery by which Bliaidan ibn Hatli'Jain lost Ins li e and whicli definitely threw the Ajman into open rebellion against Bin Saud» . *^ a ^ () ^i a force camped at Awalna in Hassa, under his son Fahad* T f ^ 0 r i \ 1 - Vltec } ie Dhaidan to come and see him and dismiss a message he had to deliver from Bm Saud for him. He gave him a full safe Conduct in writing. On Dhaidan arriving with 3 attendants lie was received well but when lie subsequently desired to leave, he was seized and put in irons. The Aiman Who were camped close by, and who had opposed their chief's going in the first place, were incensed when they received the news of what had happened, parti cularly as they interpreted a volley which they heard from Fahad's camp as theii 4 leaders execution. A force started off at once under Hazam al-Hathlain and rushed r ahad al-Jaloui's camp in the early hours of 1st May. Fahad seeing the day lost, with his own hands cut the throat of Dhaidan, and then was himself slain by a young Ajmi who seized the bridle of his horse as he was trying to escape and shot him through the head. The casualties in Bin Jaluwi's force were very heavy. Practically all his men were townsmen of Hoffuf and these all were put to the sword. Some Bedouin irregulars of Ibn Jaloui's were not touched nor did they join in the fight. Naif al-Hathlain known as ' Abal Kilab was subsequently recognized aS paramount Shaikh of the Ajman. The news of the above events spread like wild fire and caused a deep stir throughout North Eastern Arabia, and local sentiment veered round against Bin Sand from this date. In the meantime, Faisal al-Duwish abandoned by Bin Saud in his village of Artawiyeh and believed to be dying, was slowly recovering, though he made out by a series of clever ruses to make the world believe that there was no hope and it was only a question of time for his death to be reported. Ibn Humaid was in prison in Riath. Early in May the Ajman under Naif ibp Hathlain moved up to and camped at Wafra with Farhan fbn Mashur. The Ajman now being in virtual rebellion the Shaikh of Kuwait was early in Mav instructed by H. M. (xovernment not to allow supplies to go out to them, as well as to Ibn Mashur's force. Nor were any members of their respective forces permitted to come into Kuwait. Oil 2nd June Bin Saud made strong protest to H. M. Grovernment, accusing Kuwait of supplying the rebel Ajman and ibn Mashur's force with food and ammunition contrary to the undertakings made to him by H. M. G-overnment. iCareful enquiries made by the Political Agent showed that Bin Sand's charges were unfounded though a certain amount of secret smuggling through the medium of relatives and well-wishers of the Ajman residents in Kuwait was shown to exist. That the Shaikh of Kuwait was loyally carrying out the wisheS of H. M- Government in this respect was clearly and abundantly proved. On 4th June ' Dhafir ' raiders made off with 100 camels belonging to Kuwait woodcutters close to Jahrah. One of the raiders was captured and he gave the names of his companions who all turned out to be 'Iraq subjects. As a result of representations made to the 'Iraq Grovernment the camels were recovered early in July and the culprits duly punished. On the 10th June His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait officially objected to 'Iraq Police Cars moving about his territory without reference to himself. The practice had grown up as a result of Akhwan raids the previous year, but was considered objectionable from many points of view. It was agreed that for the future no 'Iraq Policeman should cross the frontier without taking the previous sanction of the Ruler through the Political Agent. On the 14th June a large force of Ajman rebels left their camp at Wafra for an unknown destination in the South. On the 19th June Faisal al-Buwish, the famous raider and guiding Spirit of the Akhwan. now well, threw off ihe mask and threw in his lot with the Ajman, and on that date reached Jariya al Illya 80 miles from the Kuwait frontier. This LclUED# 58 defection of the lately severely wounded warrior greatly added to the strength and prestige of the Hassa rebels. Duwish's first act on arriving in Hassa was to invite the Shaikh of Knwait to throw in his lot with the rebels and recover his lost territories filched from Kuwait in Shaikh Salimi's reign. He followed up his letter by requesting permission to camp at Subaihiyeh and come into Kuwait and explain his plans as well as obtain supplies. His Excellency the Shaikh was immediately instructed by H. M. Government to place the Mutair in the same category as the Ajman, and forbid Faisal al-Duwish or any of his people from crossing the frontier. Should they do so, he wa« told, they would be bombed. On 23rd June the Ajman-ibn Mashur combination who had gone south attacked the Awazim at Kitha, close to Jubail. The Awazim were assisted by the Amir of Hassa's troops and were prepared for the attack. The rebels received a sharp check, their losses being 54, the Awazim casualties numbered only 15 killed including some women. No leaders were killed on either side, but the Ajman lost some warflags. The exaggerated accounts of the battle which was broadcast everywhere in Hassa and Hedjaz as a might victory was tipical of how things are stage-managed in Arabia. Faisal al-Duwish on receiving the news of the discomfiture of the Ajman moved to Hamudh in Hassa proper, and upbraided ibn Mashur and the Ajman leaders for their lack of preparation and method, and told them they deserved all they had got. On the 28th June Faisal -al-Duwish made renewed efforts to get the Shaikh of Kuwait to throw in his lot with the rebels, and sent various prominent Akhwan leaders including his eldest son Azaiyiz to try and- persuade Shaikh Ahmad to take the strong line. The letters of al-Duwish were couched in remarkable and picturesque language and his appeals made a deep impression on the Ruler of Kuwait and his people. Shaikh Ahmad was exhorted to play the role of ' a man ', and act as Mubarak would undoubtedly have acted. Supplies and ammunition he said were all the rebells required, and if Kuwait came in he al-Duwish would do the rest. Fortunately for everyone^ concerned Shaikh Ahmad remained loyal to the promises he made to the Political Agent, though the temptation to lead a powerful attack against the Sand dynesty and recover his lost provinces in the South, and more especially his lost tribes the Awazim, Ajman and Mutair, must have been well nigh irresistible. Had he joined the rebels and had H. M. Government stood aside and adopted a neutral attitude it is highly probable that Bin Sand would have been overthrown, for the Nejd fighting forces were on the side of the Rebels. On the 15th July the rebel Ajman, Mutair and ibn Mashur contingents moved their families and camels South from Wafra. This was laigely due to the untiring efforts of the Shaikh of Kuwait, whose object for weeks pre- viously had been to get the rebels away from the frontier, and the standing temptation of Subaihiyeh and the fine grazing that existed in its vicinity. On the 18th July came the news that parties of rebels had penetrated as far as Abu Jiffan close to Ritha and had cut the Hoffuf-Ritha road. About this period a stream of prominent Nejd refugees resident in 'Iraq and most of them in receipt of stipends from the 'Iraq Government began to arive in Kuwait en route to join the rebels. It became a matter ot some embarassment to the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Political Agent to know how to deal with these gentrv. The story one and all told was that they had been permitted bv H. M. King Faisal to go and join the rebels and try their luck. But as ibn Sand's agents in Kuwait kept the King informed of every tresi arrival and his everv movement, the matter became a most awkward one tor everv one concerned in Kuwait. Eventually 6n the matter being represented to the Tion'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, permission was obtained to arrest and send back any persons arriving Tom raq ai c suspected of wanting to join the rebel army. One of these persons by name All bm Shuaribat (of Mutair origin) made himself particularly prominent by m secret goings and comings between Baghdad and the Rebel^ camp ; There i_ little doubt that he was the bearer of much moral and material assistance and greatlv encouraged the rebels to continue their resistance. Ubaiyid bin of the Ataiba was another such person and acted as messeuger between FaiSc al-Duwish and Naif al-Hindi ibn Humaid the ^-chief of the Ataiba who fled from Nejd 3 years ago and now resides in Baghbad. On 1 Oth Aueust, H. E. the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Political Agent received lengthy letters from Bin Sand, thanking them for their efforts to keep supplies from going to the rebels.59 On lOtli August Mohomed al Khalid (Zab Saliman) a brilliant young Ajman leader cut up a Nejd detachment close to Nta in Hassa. On 15tli August news reached Kuwait that Amir Sand's (the King's son) baggage train, whilst proceeding from Ritha to Hoffuf had been attacked by the Ajman under Mohomed-al-Uthain and 14 motor cars destroyed. The news was confirmed on 22nd August 1929. Up to 15th August Duwish with the main rebel f orces lay camped in the Tawal al Janubi, the centrally situated rectangle formed by the Safa-Wabra-Qaraa and Haba wells. From this position he could strike into Nejd or Hassa at will. Actually on 2nd August he had made one of his lightening raids to Qaj a or Gaiyeh near Artawiyeh and destroyed a force of Sbei and Sahool tribesmen assisted by a small force of the King's. This raid spread consternation tar and wide, though no camels were actually captured. It resulted m the witli- drawal to Ritha of Bin Baud's advance troops camped at Hatar al Atz. A feature of this raid was the behaviour of the rebels towards their prisoners, it was examplary, and marked a welcome change from their old methods. August also saw the rebels everywhere successful, and Bin Saud acting on the defensive. The latter's avowed policy at this period was to hold the Town still the cold weather set in. This was obviously the proper stra egy but it meant losing more and more of his Bedouin adherents The great Ataiba were really the masters of the situation about this time, and both ie ^ mid King strove hard to get them on their side. They were the most powerful confederation in Arabia and it became clear that whichever side they joined would eventually win. On 22nd August ibn Mashur (alone) moved up to Kuwait and at an m er- view heH 8 miles from the Town with the Political Agent begged permission for the rebels to camp at Subaihiyeh. The request was refused and ibn Mashur was ordered to quit Kuwait territory at once. He tried also to be allowed to visit Baghdad, this request was also vetoed. On 20th August ' al-Bibai Bin Sand's confidential secret Agent arrived in Kuwait. , ^ t 1.1 On August ' al-Duwish ' moved to Hafar al Batm and won the grea^ Braih sectkm of the Mutair over to the rebels. .The Braih, some 400 tents thereupon marched into Hassa and joined al-Duwish s foice. n„ oqth Aueust some of the Braih entered Kuwait territory and camped at Jatoah' bu^on the representation of the Political Agent they were ejected.^ On ^Ofh August driven by the necessity of having to find fresh grazing pn-onnds for their vast herds of camels and sheep, the rebels suddenly invaded ISStJUw 'r «• s r' h a J°d II- -'■■I- 'I 'V .'rX,;;;:;,., I,, hi.-TO, «orntullj received.

The Awazim a strong tribe in Hassa were reinforced by regulars and ordered to move north and pin the rebels on the Southern frontiers of Kuwait. Another concentration (tribal) was formed at Haffar al Atz, and ibn Musaad collected a^force of 3,000 men at Ajibba S. W. of the Bashuk. The King himself was devoting his attention to the important Ataiba of whom a large section had at last raised the standard of revolt. He however managed matters in the west with consumate skill, and succeeded in creating open discord amoncr his adversaries. On the 5th October al-Duwish fell upon the Awazim at Ingair in central Hassa and won a complete victory. The Awazim surrendered on the 10th October, the rebel commander agreeing that the Awazim should proceed to Kuwait and remain there. The rebel losses in killed numbered 84 and that of the Awazim 250, both high figures for an Arabian battle. The rebels captured 8,000 of the Awazim camels and much other loot. Bin Saud's commander Mohomed al-Suhalli escaped from the field of battle with five attendants. ' Ingair ' gave the rebels the province of Hassa but as a set off to their victorv came the news that the King had also had an overhelming success in west Nejd' and had definitely eliminated the Ataiba from the contest. This was bad news for the rebels, as the belief that the Ataiba would eventually succeed had hitherto not been doubted. On 30th October Duwish sent in and asked to see the Political Agent and the Shaikh of Kuwait. He followed up his request by crossing the border and camping at Jahrah. A Acting on instructions al-Duwish was told to imme diately withdraw. It transpired he wished to ask the following three questions of H. M. Government which duly reached the Political Agent by letter : (1) If he moved into Nejd, and left his women and cattle in North Hassa would H. M. Government promise not to bomb them or allow 'Iraq tribes to attack them. (2) Should ibn Musaad attacked his women from west during his absence, woiild H. M. Government permit them to take refuge in Kuwait territory and remain under the Shaikh's protection. (3) If any of his people shot down an aeroplane of Bin Sand's manned by an Englishman, would H. M. Government hold the rebels responsible. On the questions being referred to H. M. Government, the Political Agent was told to give a rather vague negative answer to the first two, and a positive reply to the third. H. M. Government's attitude deeply disappointed the rebel leader, and he sent a message to the Political Agent and the Shaikh to the effect that as H. M. Government was clearly on the side of Bin Sand, and as he could not possibly invade Nejd proper and try final conclusions with the King, if his women, supplies, camels, and base generally would be at the mercy of the 'Iraq tribes and with the tacit consent of the British Government, he had no course left but to make as good terms as he could with the King. Undoubtedly the above reply of H. M. Government, may be said to have marked the collapse of the rebellion. From that day al-Duwish entirely disallusioned, not only made not the slightest effort to fight the King's forces, but openly advised and exhorted any one who so wished to leave him and make separate peace with Bin Saud. Though the rebels had a sufficient quantity of supplies and munitions to carry on a long war, the collapse of the Ataiba made it vitally necessary for them to invade Nejd and beat Bin Saud in the field. H. M. Government's veiled statement that they would not undertake to prevent the 'Iraq tribes from attacking his women and seizing his camels and supplies generally in his absence was accepted as tantamount to their saying they would encourage such action, so further operations against Nejd became obviously impossible. The lOtti November saw the rebel forces retire to the centre of the Garaa 70 to 80 miles from the Kuwait border, and their numbers gradually dwindle away.61 On the 19th November Shaikh Hafith Wahba Bin Sand's Minister in [London arrived at Kuwait and started an intensive anti-rebel propaganda. On 23rd November as rain pools in the desert had dried np certain rebel camels bagan to cross the fontier and water at Jahrah. Steps were at once taken to eject them and prevent the practice in future. On 25th November, Ibn Hathlain attempted to cross the border and visit Kuwait and see the Shaikh, but was prevented, and turned back by the Shaikh himself. On 29th November, threatening letters began to pour into Kuwait from Bin Sand, to the effect that he was approaching with a mighty army and that if the Shaikh allowed a single rebel to cross his frontier he the King would hold him personally responsible. Similar letters were circulated among the leaders and notables of Kuwait by Shaikh Hafith Wahba. On the 26th November His Excellency the*Shaikh formally complained that Shaikh Hafith Wahba was acting as a ^ Consul ' would, and requested that H. M. Government order him to cease his activities forthwtih. A warning was duly issued and matters improved somewLat. On 18th December Bin Sand's advance guard was reported at Safa, and on the same day 5 of his motor cars arrived at Kuwait with letter confirming the news. At the same time the rebel forces much reduced in numbers, and with leaders daily deserting to Bin Sand, or quietly making off South, moved down to the line of the ' Batin ' and camped more or less between Rigai and Haifar al Batin. Faisal al Duwish now started opening formal negotiations with Bin Saud, by means of letters. The Defence of Kuwait. The problem of the Defence of Kuwait State received considerable atten tion during the year. Kuwait has an undefended frontier line of 260 miles approximately— ot this 120 miles divides her from Nejd and 140 from 'Iraq. In the days of the great Shaikh Mubarak her frontier started from Jebel Manifa on the boast of Hassa, and included Nta-Safa and Haffar al Batin. But though her territories were almost 3 times what they are now, she had little to fear from the land side as she brought within her orbit the powerful Ajman, Mutair (Ilwa) and the Awazim tribes, than whom no finer fighting material exists in Arabia. As the territory of these three tribes fell within the then Kuwait boundaries, an attack or raid on Kuwait meant an attack on them, and vice versa and attack on them meant an attack on Kuwait. It was this strong i 1 system '' which Bin Saud went out to ' break ' after Mubarak's death. He finally succeeded in the early days of the present Ruler of Kuwait's reign, when he obtained a rectification of the frontier to what it stands to-day, and in so doing got transferred to Nejd the grazing grounds of the Awazim, Ajman and Mutair, and with them the tribes themselves. The Shaikh of Kuwait maintains that he has never yet agreed to the new frontier line, which was fixed up at the Ojair Conference of 1923, between H. M. Government and Bin Sand and without his being present, though his rival was. Certainly none of the three great tribes mentioned above were ever consulted or asked their views. By tradition and history thev belong to Kuwait, have had ' musabilah ' with Kuwait for centuries, and have always looked upon Kuwait as their mother city. In passing one may note that one of the chief objects of the Ajman and Mutair during the recent rebellion, was to throw off the Nejd yoke and once again come under the control of Kuwait. With the transference of her three great tribes in 1923 to Nejd, Kuwait became for all practical purposes defenceless. There is little doubt that much trouble and expense would have been saved all round if H. M. Government had after the Ojair Conference taken the bull by the horns, and guaranteed the defence of Kuwait's land frontier. Had this been done Kuwait would pro- bablv have been spared the last 8 vears cruel blockade by Bin Sand, and would certainly have been saved from the innumerable attacks and raids into her territorv (in some cases right ut ) to her walls) which have been mare bv t le regular and irregular forces of Neid during the same period. _ er f e ence ess state during this period cannot be better exemplified than by quoting tne62 amount of damage calculated to have been done to her by Nejd action. This comes to approximately Rs. 11,150,000. As things are, Kuwait possesses the following forces for her defence :— (a) Fidawiyeh. —Strength 300. These are paid men, all Bedouin and have their headquarters at Jahrah. Their particular charge is the camels, horses and sheep belonging to the ruling family. In winter the Fidawiyeh move about over the grazing grounds between Jahrah and the Batin. In the summer they all camp on the wells at Jahrah. The Fidawiyeh consist of Ajman, Mutai^, Rashaida, Awazim, elements, and have their own Amir. The Fidawiyeh can be counted on to repel any fairly strong raid on themselves, and can always follow up and deal with petty raiding parties. Their role however is rather to protect the Shaikh's property than guard the frontier. (h) Araibdar. —Strength 700. These are unpaid Bedouins who roam about the state with their camels and sheep in winter keeping always more or less near the ' Fidawiyeh ' for protection. They consist largely of Kuwait ^ Hathar ' Arabs, of Ajman, Awazim, Rashaida or Mutair stock who have settled in Kuwait during the past century. In summer they leave their camels and sheep in charge of a few men with the Fidawiyeh at Jahrah, and themselves engage in pearl diving. Their tents, women and children are- brought into Kuwait, and form the large camps which one sees round the walls of the Town and near the various wells in the vicinity. For the purposes of repelling organized raids or guarding the frontier, these Araibdar are of little use, though being well armed they can always defend themselves and their flocks at a pinch. (e) Town Defence-. —Strength 4,00015,000. This figure represents 'the number of riflemen who could man the walls of Kuwait Town in case of a grave emergency. This force would consist of towns men, shopkeepers, etc., pure and simple and would be called up by the Ruler if the town itself were menaced and the country side in the possession of the enemy. In no sense would such force be of use for defence purposes outside the city. A conference was held at Kuwait on 23rd June under the Presidency of the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Grulf, Bushire at which were present the following :— H. E. Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Subah, C.S.I., C.I.E. The Political Agent, Kuwait. Wing Commander D. A. Oliver, D.S.O., O.B.E., to discuss what further steps could be taken by the Ruler to improve the ' defensive ' arrangements of the State. On behalf of the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq Command, Wing Com mander Oliver laid down the policy that the Royal Air Force based on 'Iraq would come to the Assistance of Kuwait if she were ever in danger of serious attack, by strong and organized forces from the direction of Nejjd, and which she could obviously of herself not keep out, but that for dealing with all ordinary Bedouin Raids large or small and for patroling her frontier line she would have to depend on her own resources. For this purpose it was decided that a small highly mobile force of armed Ford cars would be the only satisfactory method of dealing with the problem. The Shaikh was therefore advised :— (a) To purchase 12 Ford Vannettes, and arm them with Lewis guns mounted on tripods. The Air Officer Commanding, Baghdad, agreeing to provide the necessary Lewis guns and ammunition on payment. (h) To purchase 2 complete wireless sets and mount them on Lorries as is done by the Royal Air Force Armoured Car Reserve force.' (c) To engage an e^-British Officer or N. C. O. to organize the above force. (d) To send at once 3 Lewis gun teams to Basrah to undergo a course f ■*, of training with the Armoured cars.! 63 His Excellency the Shaikh agreed in principle to the above arrangements, but pleaded that the state finances would not permit of his buying 14 cars at once. He was advised to do what he could and introduce the scheme slowly. By the end of 1929 the Shaikh had fully equipped— {a) Five Ford vanettes with Lewis guns. [h) One Ford Lorry with a Vickers gun. (c) A reserve of 1 Vickers gun and I Lewis gun. {d) Also had purchased 150,000 rounds .303 for above. (e) Also had purchased 200,000 rounds Mauser ammunition for the use ot his Fidawiyeh. (/) One complete Lewis gun team trained by the Royal Air Force at Basrah. The balance of his lequirements, the Shaikh has promised to purchase as funds permit. Though progress has been good as far as things go, it cannot be said that Kuwait will be m a satisfactory position to deal with attacks or raids from Ae f ]d oi anywhere else, until she has her full 12 arnied Fords, her wireless sets and her British officer or N. C. O. It would be unwise however to try and force the pace at present. Visits. . M r - G. H. Selous, H. B. M.

Note. —On every occasion the crews were entertained to lunch or dinner by the Political Agent, Civil Aviation. Two Imperial Airways Machines chartered by Abdul Rahman al-Qosaibi of Bahrain and His, Excellency Shaikh Hafith Wahba Counsellor to H. M. King Bin Sand visited Kuwait during the year. The possibility of running a feeder 'air line from Basrah to Bahrain to assist the Pearl Trade was again raised during the year. Both the Rulers of Bahrain and Kuwait pressed strongly for the service and showed great interest in the proposal. On the advice of H. M. Government however it was decided that the moment was inopportune, so the matter has been dropped for the time. Kuwait is particularly keen to see a biweekly passenger service started between Basrah and Kuwait and if the fares were reasonable there would be no end of applications for passages. Pearl Fishery. The Kuwait Pearling Fleet, which consisted of nearly six hundred boats left for the banks in the second half of May. The small preliminary dive (Khanchiyeh) consisting of some 80 boats, did well and the prospects of the main season seemed bright. The main perling fleet (al-Ghaus) returned on 20th September. A few small boats returned to the banks but were not very successful. T^o cjpnqon on the whole was a good one though the catch was perhaps 4- -L o-nod as that of 1928. The banks to the north of latitude 27° proved'the best particularly those known as Baldaur ' and ' Abu Khalau ' to the east of Ras Mish ab. WW has hit the local pearl merchants hard however has been the extra- What ^ ^ New York and Paris markets. There appears to be ordinary du pearls anvwhere, and the local big dealers were ' landed ' wit^their^pearl 8 f and most of them have still their 1929 catch entirely unsold.66 It is difficult to say where the cause lies, but one thing is certain, the big firms from Europe neither sent their representatives to the Gulf nor showed inclina tion to buy. Local opinion had it that ' the crash ' in New York earier in ^ year was responsible. Locusts. The Spring and Autumn of 1929 have been marked by the number and the vastness of the flights of locusts, which have ravaged the north east corner of Arabia. Grazing everywhere has suffered, more especially in the S. W. portion of Kuwait State. The Autumn rains of 1929^ appeared to have killed off myriads of these pests, but, they reappeared again from the direction of Hassa in still greater swarms in the winter. The spring of 1930 according to local opinion should see the arrival of the Dibba M or locusts in the hopper stage. This dreaded pest has only to be seen to be appreciated.^ Early in 1929 Kuwait Town suffered a visitation, and for a few days the inhabitants had to literally fight to save anything they had. There was one instance of a child having been eaten by them. The date gardens of the Qusur and Jahrah were stripped to such an extent that they had the appearance of having been burnt down by a great conflagration. What saved the situation finally was a violent southernly storm which blew the 11 hoppers ' into the sea. Postal Arrangements, The Kuwait Traq Motor Transport Company which started operations on 1st May 1928 has maintained on the whole a satisfactory service and mails have been delivered regularly except for the short period in the Spring of 1929 when the motor road was closed as a result of Akhwan raids. An annoying feature of the incident was the fact that while the Kuwait authorities were willing to reopen the roads, as soon as the raiders disappeared, at the 'Iraq end, the Police authorities insisted on delaying matters, long after the country side was declared safe. The Transport Company now maintains 3 mails weekly in each direction. The mails to and from India and beyond are sent by this service, which connects with the fast mail at Basrah, a bag being also made up for Bushire. Medical, Health. —On the whole, the health of the town and villages has been fairly satisfactory, apart from the usual spread and deaths from tuberculosis of the lungs. This disease is fairly widespread, not only among the townspeople, . but also among the Bedouin, as no precautions are taken and whole families are wiped out. Their habits and customs greatly help towards its spread. There are a few cases of Leprosy in the town and these will not come regularly for treatment, nor will they submit to any segregation. This is a grave danger and one that needs active and stringent measures to prevent its spread. Infantile diseases are another grave concern, as the parents are so callous and do not bring their children soon enough for treatment, with the result the mortality rate is very high. The common diseases are, skin, eyes, ears and bowels. Diseases of the eyes and ears being very frequent among the children, and cause considerable havoc owing to not being treated early, many therefore being one-eyed and deaf. Sanitation. —None. Water .—Brought in ^wooden tanks by boom from the river at Fao, and carried in Kerosine oil tins to the houses. Epidemics. —None during the year. Small Pox is endemic. Quarantine. —All ships and passengers entering the Port are inspected. Two buildings, outside the walls of the town, are used for Quarantine purposes.67 Charitable Dispensary. —The work done during the year exceeded that of last year, the attendances being almost 4,000 more. The numbers treated were :— Men .. .. .. _ .. 5,195 Women Male children .. Female children Total 3,451 2,225 2,039 12,920 There is only one Dispensary room which is quite inadequate, and its situation is a danger to the health of certain members of the Agency Staff who live in the same building. It is hoped that a better situation will be found for the Dispensary when the new Agency is completed. American Mission. Dr. J. C. Reasoner, D.M.D., returned to Kuwait on the 23rd January and took up his residence in the Safa Quarter of the Town. Mr. and Mrs. Yan Preussen arrived from Muscat on the 20th March and left again for Basrah on 30th Mach. Mrs. E. Calverly accompanied by her 3 daughters and Miss Robertson their Canadian governess left for Basrah on 30th March en route for America. Mrs. De Jong accompanied by her child left for India on the 26th June. Mrs. De Jong and child returned from India on 2nd October. Dr. J. C. Reasoner, D.M.D., left for India on 25th October. ^ Revd. and Mrs. De Jong and child left for Bahrain to attend the annual meeting of the American Mission on 13th November. The following members of the mission board from America who had attended the annual conference held in Bahrain, arrived in Kuwait in the first' half of December and after spending 3 days left for Basrah Dr. C. S. Gr. Mylrea, O.B.E., accompanied by Mrs. Mylrea, returned from long leave in the first week of December. Meteorological. As was anticipated by my predecessor the Kuwait Spring of 1929 was extremely good, and a fine hay crop was collected. The summer of 1929 was again abnormally hot. July and August were the two worst months. From 15th July to 15th August the average daily maximum was 118° F. On one occasion the thermometer registered 124° and on four other days it registered 121°. September was very damp and exceptional dews were witnessed. In May and June the steady north wind known as the Bareh ' blew with regularity and kept down the temperature. This wind was unfortunately accompanied by very heavy duststorms, every third or fourth day. The first rain which should have fallen during early October failed utterly and the first shower came during the first week of November This failure of the early rain was fatal to the grazing and the spring of 1930 should turn out a bad one from the hay point of view. The Mushroom and truffle season which follows on early rains, failed entirely and Kuwait had to go without this welcome delicacy m 1929. A total of 7.49' of rain fell in Kuwait during the year. Shipping', Ninety-three British and 4 Gernian ships visited the port during the year. The British India Steam Navigation Company's ships of the slow Gulf service called at Bahrain weekly and on their way to Basrah, and fortmg y68 CSAF® 1 on tlieir way south. A weekly service to India and greater punctuality in arrival would be much appreciated by the mercantile community. Exchange, The rate of exchange for the Maria Theresa dollar averaged Bs. 128-13-0 per 100 dollars. It was highest in May at Rs. 126-4-0 and lowest in December ^ with Es. 112. British sovereigns and Turkish pounds averaged Rs. 13-7-3 and Bs. 11-15-3 respectively, H. B. P. DICKSON, Lieut.-Col, .

French Consulate, Monsieur Luis Lucas until the 22nd March 1930. Monsieur G. Cassin, from 23rd March to the end of the year. The French Charge d'Affaires, and his Commercial Attache from Tehran visited Bushire by air in April 1930 and returned by car. They came to enquire into the causes of the decrease in French trade last year and its future prospects in view of the Persian restrictions on foreign trade, MC171FD2 Monsieur Rebel, Inspector General of tiie St. Louis Sugar Company, Marseilles, eame to Bushire via Baghdad in April 1930,, to study the local market conditions; with a view to finding a means of combating the Kussian competition in sugar. The French Yacht ' Diana ' with Admiral Deville on board arrived at Bushire in December 1930. The usual salutes were y after some trouble, arranged by the French Consul^ but when the ' Diana ' arrived compliments could not be exchanged as she had expended all her ammunition at Jibuti on the occasion of . the Abyssinian Coronation. Norwegian Vice Consulate. —The Honourable Lieutenant Colonel EL V. Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General remained in charge of the archives of the Norwegian Vice Consulate pending his recognition as Acting Norwegian Vice Consul by the Persian Government. The Norwegian Government are in correspondence with the Persian Government on this subject. Russian Consulate General. —The Soviet Eastern Trading Company^ Bushire remained in occupation of the Russian Consulate General throughout the year. They arranged accommodation for a branch of the Russo-Persian Bank which, it was given out by them, was to be opened in Bushire. There is, however, no sign of it as yet. A rumour was spread that a Soviet Vice-Consulate was to be opened here, but this also did not materialise. Greatly exaggerated accounts of the political disturbances in India were given out by the Russians in Bushire. They held two functions,, in October and Novem-- ber, to which only Persian merchants and traders were invited and there they emphasised the good relations between the two Governments. They continue supplying the Russian Consul-General, Shiraz, with news. M. Batmanoff, the Russian Consul-General, Shiraz, visited Bushire three times, by air and car during the year under review,, in connection with the cargoes brought by the Sharq Company's steamers to Bushire in January, March and October 1930. On the first occasion, when he stayed 10 days at Bushire, he exchanged cards with the Political Resident and the French Consul, Bushire. German Consulate. —Herr Wassmuss was sued by the sons of Shaikh Hussain Khan of Chahkutah for the sum of Ts. 11,881, due on account of promissory notes which he gave to them in 1915. Being unable to pay up Herr Wassmuss was for some time restrained from leaving Bushire and his property in the German Consulate attached by the Law Court. His appeal to the Shiraz Court having failed Herr Wassmuss appealed to the High Court at Tehran—where the case is still under trial. He is now in Tehran attending the proceedings of his case in the Sessions Court. The German Consulate in Bushire was occupied by pilots and mechanics of the Junkers Company. Ihctch Consulate. —The French Consul, Bushire, remained in charge of the Dutch Consulate throughout the year. SECTION 3. Local Government, Governor of the Gulf Ports, Islands Dashti and Dashtistan. —Except for a period of about 7| months when he was on leave and on special duty as Persian Repre sentative in the Perso-Turkish Frontier Commission, His Excellency MuzafEar Khan A'alam Sardar-i-Intisar held the post throughout the year under review. The acumen, tact and moderation displayed by His Excellency in guiding the military in their efforts to disarm the tribesmen of Dashti and Dashtistan, which lasted until the end of March, and in nipping in the bud a rebellion initiated by Muhammad Khan Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh of Borazjan which had threatened to become general, won for him the warm appreciation of His Majesty the Shah and marked him out for future promotion. His relations with the Residency were friendly, if not cordial and he was on the whole easy ^o deal with;.He obtained the approval of the Persian Government to various projects for the improvement of the town, harbour, etc., but up to the end of the year none of them had been put in hand. Acting Governor of the Gulf Ports, etc. —Husain Ali Khan Shahruzi, Director of the Provincial Posts and Telegraph Departments, Bushire, acted for His Excels lency the Governor from 12th May to the 22nd December. . He is a petty official, afraid to take the smallest responsibility and quite unsuited for the appointment of Governor. He made himself unpopular not only with the tribal chiefs but also with the townspeople in regard to whose affairs he shewed a lack of practical administrative ability. Assistant Governor of the Persian Gulf Ports, etc. —Mirza Ismail Khan Amir- Ibrahimi, from 2nd February 1930 until the 24th March, when he returned to Tehran. Muhammad Khan Zand, Deputy Governor, Lingah, was transferred to Bushire in September 1930 and remained in charge of the post throughout the year, tie has shown a friendly attitude towards the Kesidency and Consulate-General. Reference paragraph 1 section 3 of last year's Administration Report. Muhammad Ali Khan Sadid-us-Sultaneh Kababi returned in September 1930 from Tehran to Bushire after 17 months' imprisonment. He was told at the ter^ mination of the period, that he had been imprisoned as the result of a misunder standing, and, as a recompense for this unjust treatment he was made Deputy Governor, Lingah. Officer Commanding, Troops. —Yawar Qasim I£han Vejdani, from 10th July 1929 until 24th May 1930, Naib Sarhang Azimi from 24th May to 30th June 1930, Yawar Mahmud Khan Parveen from 30th June to the end of the year. He has proved a source of trouble to his colleagues in reporting to Tehran against them. Finance Department. —Mirza Hasan Khan Mushiri remained in charge until the 30th April 1930 when he was made Director of Finance for Fars, and Sayed Ahmed Khan Ashraufi held the post of Acting Director of Revenues, from 1st April until August 1930. Mirza Mehdi Khan Zahidi, Muqawwam-ul-Mulk, arrived at Bushire in August 1930 and remained Director of Finance for the Southern Ports throughout the re^ maining part of the year. Education Department.^—The Department of Education, Bushire, was made subDrdinate to the Education Department of Ears, Shiraz, in order to expedite its work but this arrangement has rather had the contrary effect. Sayed Muhammad Ali Fakhr-i-Dai left Bushire in June 1930 and Shaikh Husain Dashti was appointed Acting Director of Public Instruction, Bushire. He remained in charge throughout the rest of the year. Police Department. —Ya war Husain Quli Khan Biat remained in charge until the 28th April 1930 when he handed over to Yawar Ghulam Husain Behzadi who was in charge to the end of the year. Though not so efficient as his predecessor his attitude towards the Residency was satisfactory. The Police Force was clad in July in a new unifrom made of light blue Persian cloth with a hat which appears to be a copy of a French soldier's helmet. Customs Department. —Monsieur Paul Wolters remained as Provincial Director of the Southern Customs from 1st January until October 1930 when he was re lieved by Monsieur A. Stas and transferred to Bandar Abbas. Monsieur Wolters succeeded in making himself much disliked by the merchani/^ and traders and even by his own Belgian colleagues. During his tenure of office at Bushire and Bandar Abbas numerous complaints were made against him to the Central Customs Administration and the Majlis, but they appear to have beei) jgnored by the Central Customs Administration.M. Hunin, the Customs Inspector and Head of the Preventive Department, was transferred to Tehran at the end of March 1930 and was made Inspector General of Customs. The Preventive Department achieved considerable success during the year especially so long as the troops remained in Dashti and Dashtistan. Later there was some recrudescence but on a reduced scale, in the country as soon as the Force left. Sixteen Customs posts were established on the Persian Baluchistan frontier in May and in December Customs authorities requested Mir Barkat Khan to co operate with them in the efficient working of the Customs posts opened in Sadaich, Galag, Rapch, and Tank. Posts and Telegraphs. —Aqa Husain Ali Shahruzi held charge of these two Departments as Provincial Director until December 1930 when he went on leave to Tehran, his Assistant Haji Khan Sihhatpur acting in his absence. He was no more successful in this capacity than in that of Acting Governor and was on oc casions very discDurteous to the Residency. Judicial. —Mirza Muhammad Ali Pishwa remained in charge of his duties until the end of March 1930 when he suddenly left by air for Tehran where he settled the question of his own salary and that of the Public Prosecutor Nimtalluah Khan Aushti. None of his petitions and requests for an increase having previously had the slightest effect. He returned 3J months later having succeeded in getting his own pay raised to Ts. 250 and that of Aushti to Ts. 200 a month. Health and Quarantine Department. — (a) Dr. Abul Qasim Khan Bah rami remained in charge of this Department as Chief Medical Quarantine Officer and Health Officer of the Southern ports throughout the year. His quarantine mea sures, as far as this Residency is concerned, were satisfactory. (b) Lion, and Sun Society. —This institution was established 2 years ago by His Excellency the Governor and is being managed by the Health and Chief Qua rantine Medical Officer. It has since bought the old Turkish Consulate, Bushire, and converted it into a Maternity Hospital. The society remitted a sum of 5,000 francs to France as a donation in aid of the flooded areas in the Seine districts and another sum in aid of the Damavand vil lages ruined by earthquakes. Census Department. —Abdul Majid Khan Farrabi took charge from Mirza Muhammad Ali Khan Mufazzal in December 1929 and remained in charge through out the year. He is a poet and of the Sunni faith. Municipality, —Elections for a new Municipality were held in July and out of the 46 persons voted for whose names were reported to the Central Government, Tehran, 11 persons, comparative nonentities were approved for the Council. This new Municipality presided over by the former president Sayed Husain Behbehani Siadat elaborated a new budget of Ts. 24,000 per annum and suggested certain new sources of revenue to make up the amount. The Central Government, however, rejected the budget and authorised the following taxes to be collected for the Municipal revenues :— Weighing Fee at Krs. 2% Tabriz Maunds (8 lbs. each) on everything brought into the town for local consumption. 3% of the hire of rentables (in addition to the ordinary revenue tax). Krs. 1 per bottle on Persian liquors. Krs. 3 per bottle on foreign liquors. Krs. 20 to 60 a month on garages, restaurants or hotels. Krs. 15 to 50 on Electric and Ice Plants. / 10% of the nett income of Cinematographs and theatres. Krs. 1 to 10 per month on every shop of profession classes. Krs. 3 to 100 on the assessed value of houses worth Ts. 400 each. Up to the end of the year the Municipality had made little progress in collecting the taxes owing to the poverty of the people.SECTION IV. Military.- RecTuitYnents. \awar Khan Lar Khan Afshar, the recruiting officer, arrived at Bushire at the end of October and a month later notified the opening of the Recruiting Depot which was formally opened by the Governor. This year Dr. Abul Qasim Khan Bahrami refused to join the Recruiting Committee which con sisted of the Governor (or his assistant), the Officer Commanding, Troops, Bushire (or his assistant), the Recruiting Officer, the President of the Municipality, Civil and Military Doctors, the local Judge, the Director of Revenue, Chief of Police and four leading merchants of the town. Lists showing the names of 18,000 youths as eligible for service were posted and youths of 21 to 24 years were called up. Two hundred were exempted as bread winners, many fled and only 57 were collected and taken to the barracks for training. Seventy-six youths who had offered them selves for service in the Navy were exempted from military service. Conscription N measures continue to be very unpopular in Bushire and efforts are still being made to obtain general exemption for Bushire and the Persian Gulf Ports. Disarming Campaign. —The disarming campaign which was taken up in November 1929 was completed by the end of March 1930 when according to official news 9,000 rifles had been collected in Dashti and Dashtistan. The actual number however is probably much less than this figure. Amniah (Road Guards).—The strength of this Force was brought up to about 500 by the end of the year and consisted of men engaged locally on Ts. 6 a month with a daily allowance of Krs. 2 each. They were paid regularly for two months when their wages and allowances were suddenly reduced by the Commandant to Ts. 7 per month. Some of the guards began to beg and thus matters came to light. The Yawar was apprehended and has since been dismissed from service. The Officer Commanding the Amniah at Aham was brought to Bushire to answer charges of bribery and maltreatment brought against him. His case is still going on. At the close of the year it was rumoured that the garrison of Bushire would be replaced by Amniah guards but so far nothing has been done in this connection. Aviation. —A Persian Government aeroplane arrived from Tehran on the 12tli January but while coming down hit the wireless mast at the aerodrome and was wrecked, the Russian mechanic being hurt. Navy.—Ak the end of November two Persian officials named Captain Ibrahim and Salim Pio left for Port Said via Baghdad to bring in the ' Chalchilah a launch bought by the Persian Government for Ts. 20,000 from Germany. As she is only about 53 feet long it is doubtful whether she can reach Bushire under her own steam. There is still no sign of the gunboats stated in the Persian press to have been ordered from Italy. SECTION V. Aviation^ German. —Except in January when weather conditions prevented their aero planes from running regularly, the Junkers Company have maintained an efficient and punctual service throughout the year and there have been no accidents. In March alone they ran 14 extra trips between Shiraz and Bushire and brought 56 cases of opium to Bushire. They deservedly enjoy the confidence of the general public. Imperial Airways, Limited. —Imperial Airways, Limited, maintained a weekly service throughout the year. During the summer months the service is very regular and punctual, but delays are common in winter owing chiefly to bad weather conditions in Europe. Butch. —The fortnightly Dutch Royal Air Mail service between Amsterdam and Batavia was discontinued during the summer, but resumed in the autumn^ The service was not very regular. M0. 171 FT).6 SECTION VI. Political Situation. Government measures, —In the beginning of the year, Mirza Muhammad Khan Ghazanfar-us-Snltaneh of Borazjan rose in open rebellion against the Government Troops as a result of the Disarming Campaign which has been commenced in Dashti and Dashtistan in November. He robbed caravans and flocks of sheep giving receipts for what he took and his gang increased in numbers-daily. Encouraged by this rising and the defeats which the Government Troops received at the hands of Mehdi Surkhe and his following about Firoozabad, a few of the Khans of Dashti followed in the footsteps of Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh. This state of affaiis threatened a general rising of the tribes and even a recurrence of the Qashqai revolt. The tact of His Excellency Sardar-i-Intisar however saved the situation. At his instance, it is said, Shaikh Abdur Rasul Khan, son of Shaikh Hussain Khan of Chahkutah, shot down Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh and his following were, some killed and the rest dispersed. The Dashtis then also received a defeat after some brief fighting and gave up their arms. Shaikh Abdur Rasul Khan and Haji Ali of Chahpir were given medals for the assistance they rendered in the disarming of the tribes. Conscription, disarmament, the new dress regulations and the increased land revenue (which has been raised by 60%), continue to keep the peasantry and tribes discontented. The mercantile classes and traders are also disaffected as they are almost completely prevented by the Foreign Exchange Law from importing goods from abroad and are harassed by increased customs duties. By the end of March the Dashti and Dashtistan and Mehdi Surkhe's trouble had all been brought to an end and peace restored. The resumption of operatioi^s . against the Mamasani and Kuhgilaviah tribes which commenced in the middle of the year proved that the Government were resolved to enforce conscription, dis- armamemt and New Dress Regulations all over the country. The defeat of these tribes, especially of the Kuhgilaviah tribes, proved the supremacy of the Govern ment. The Nadiri Regiment having finished the Disarming Campaign in Dashti and Dashtistan came and camped 4 miles from Bushire. It marched past the town and was received by the populace with shouts of ' Long live the Shah '. No com plaint was made of any misbehaviour on the part of the troops. The elections for the eighth Constitutional era were effected according to the orders of the Government and their nominees elected namely Shaikh Ali Dashti, Editor of Shafq-i-Surkh, and Haji Muhammad Reza Behbahani, Bushire. Criticis ing the Shah the general public consider him a usurper of the people's constitutional rights. ' SECTION VII. Slavery. During the period under review the following slaves were manumitted by order of the Political Resident : Henjam .. .. .. .. 8 Shergah .. .. .. .. 12 , &lt;' SECTION VIII. Trade and Trade Facilities. Trade. —The year 1930 must surely be considered one of the worst that British trade in Persia has ever experienced, It opened with the continuation and accentuation of the fall in the Kran Sterling rate due to the fall in the price of silver, itself a sufficiently disturbing factor, which would doubtless have led to a very considerable reduction in business, even if the Persian Government had not taken upon itself at the end of February to introduce hasty and ill-conceived measures for the control of the exchange rate, which precipitated and accentuated the crisis.With a view to arresting tlie depreciation of the Kran tlie Government decided arbitrarily to fix the rate of exchange, and transactions at other than the official rate were made illegal. From the very inception however of Government control Foreign Exchange proved unobtainable at the official rate of 60 to £, except by resort to clandestine and illegal methods and it became quite impossible for either the Imperial oank of Persia or tiie National BanR to obtain sufficient exchange even to meet the requirements of merchants with outstanding commitments. These latter not unnaturally in the majority of cases pleaded foTcc TytdjcuTe and refused to honour their commitments abroad. Goods continued to pile up in the customs already full to overflowing and foreign trade was at a standstill. The Government, whose motives in attempting by drastic measures to maintain the ya^ue^ of the Kran may partly have been due to misguided pride, but were also attributable to the desire to avoid any curtailment of their purchasing power abroad, soon found however that no foreign exchange was coming in and that it was quite impossible to check illegal transactions in the bazaars. It was presume- ably for this reason that the original exchange control law was modified in July when it was decreed that exporters of the more important Persian products—opium, gum, carpets, also demonetized silver—would be obliged to sell 90% of the foreign exchange proceeding from their sale to the Government. Exporters of other produce were to be exempted for six months from compliance with this rule so long as they could prove that the proceeds were to be devoted to the liquidation of pre vious engagements, or alternatively, were to be allowed to retain 60% of their exchange for the importation of goods not figuring in the exchange control commis sions' list of articles (motor vehicles, luxury articles, foodstuffs, alcoholic drinks, etc.) for the importation of which, from the outset, foreign exchange was not to be made available. This amendment may have had the effect of easing the exchange situation for the Government slightly. On the other hand, it led to an acceleration of the rise in price levels and in the fall in the Kran Sterling bazaar rate, since, owing to the lack of demand for Persian produce in foreign markets, exporters were forced to sell at a loss and endeavour to recoup themselves on the enhanced prices of their imports or the bazaar Kran rate obtainable for the foreign exchange acquired on their exports. By the end of August the Government were in a very bad way financially,. The Banks' purchases of exchange were only averaging some £20,000 monthly instead of some £50,000 exclusive of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's sales of exchange, while revenue was short and the pay of ordinary civil servants in Tehran in arrears. There was talk of endeavouring to ease the situation by allowing the rate to go to 80 and of the Government putting £500,000 of their gold reserve on the exchange market. However, other counsels prevailed, and it was decided to borrow three million tomans from the National Bank instead. Towards the autumn the position became worse and worse. The de facto Kran rate diverged further and further from the official rate. The eagerness of importers to join the export trade and so obtain sterling caused all exportable com modities to soar in price, while their price on foreign markets continued to depre ciate in sympathy with the world trade slump. Meanwhile the price of all im ported goods was rapidly rising and economic pressure making itself acutely felt by all sections of the people. Still the Government refused to take any appropriate steps to remedy the situation. It's pet projects—the railway and the introduction of the gold standard—were still obstinately adhered to, while there was no thought of returning the Anglo-Persian Oil Company royalties into circulation. On the contrary a large proportion of them was expended on the purchase of military equipment. Apart from a further modification in the law, introduced in Septem ber, whereby exporters of opium, etc., were to be allowed to retain up to 20% of the proceeds, to be devoted to the purchase of imports, and exporters of inferior produce up to 90% on similar conditions, no attempt was made to help the trade of the country to its feet. The fact of the matter was that high-placed officials were drawing far too much benefit from the existing state of affairs to wish to see them altered, while the German and Belgian advisors, of whom the Exchange Control Commission was largely composed, were naturally loth to suffer a decrease in their salaries paid in8 Krans which any reduction of the official rate necessarily entailed. If to such practical considerations be added the acute national prestige complex, which at present actuates all Persian policy, it is not altogether surprising that this state of affairs should have continued so long, nor in fact that it should continue for some considerable time to come. The Persian is notoriously long-suffering, while the .Government can always point to world trade depression as the cause of all their troubles.. The combined effect of the fall in the price of silver, the slump in trade through out the world and the injudicious methods adopted by the Government to deal with the situation have resulted in a drop of the exchange rate from 65 in January to 120 in December ; a heavy increase in taxation; an enormous rise in the cost of jiving ; a total disorganization of trade ; and a consequent falling off in revenue in spite of the new taxes imposed. As regards the particular effect in Bushire of the Government's activities in the field of economises, there is little to be said. Month after month the market remained dull and depressed. Small traders were forced to fall out of foreign trade which tended more and more to become the monopoly of the biggest mer chants having holdings of foreign exchange abroad. These latter devoted them selves to an ever increasing extent to the import of tea and sugar, which by April were showing a considerable advance in price which continued progressively to the end of the year when, sugar prices were some 40% and tea nearly 90% above January levels, and by the middle of the year speculation in tea and sugar became the dominant factor in the bazaar.. The uncertainty prevailing was much enhanced by the policy of the Russians who alone would appear to have derived benefit from the general situation. Eight Russian ships visited Bushire as compared with five the previous year and large quantitites of sugar and piece-goods were imported, as a consequence the Sharq Companies' control of the market increased. Sometimes selling for sterling only, at other time for Krans, now extending credit, now withholding it, their chief policy seemed to be to upset the market as much as possible. In the main, how ever, they were obviously desperately keen to obtain foreign exchange, only selling for Krans when in need of currency to finance their exports of gum, almonds, etc. If the present state of affairs is to be continued it seems inevitable that their position, at least relatively r will be enormously improved. Persia cannot afford to adopt too unbending an attitude where Russia is concerned. The latter, thanks mainly to their system of barter, were from the first exempt from selling any exchange on account of their exports in the North, while there seems every reason to believe that they parted with no foreign exchange in respect of shipments from the Gulf. Last year, imports of cotton cloth through Bushire totalled 23 million krana of which the Russians were responsible for 3 million. This year, on a total of 22 millions, they imported for 4 • 3 million krans. In order to give these figures their true significance it must be borne in mind that Bushire, while the natural port of entry for Indian and British piece-goods r is far from being so for the Russians.. Furthermore, the Russian quota actually* represents goods imported during the year, whereas in the total figure a very considerable percentage is made up of goods ordered during the previous year and not cleared from the customs for many months, thus appearing in the J 930 figures. One big importer of Manchester piece-^oods alone cleared £30.000 or some 2 million krans worth in this manner and there were many others. Thirty ra ther than twenty per cent would probably more- truly represent the Russian share. As regards the total import figures, of 98 million krans as opposed to 117 millions in 1929—a drop of 19 millions—the above factor must be taken into account and allowance made for the fall in exchange rate (which has had the effect of increasing all customs kran figures for 1930 by some 15%), if anything like a true picture of the state of affairs is to be drawn from comparison. If 10% therefore is deducted from the 1930 figures, to allow for their being swollen by the shifting of the customs rate of calculation from 55 to 60, the drop of 19 million krans becomes 29 millions, equivalent to a drop of nearly 25% on the 1929 figures. Furthermore a percentage must be deducted from the 1930 figures and added to ihe 1929 figures in respect of goods which normally would have been cleared and9 recorded as entering during tliat year, but which merchants refused to take up on the krans fall in the autumn, and finally did clear when the rise in price levels made it worth their while to do so in the spring and summer of 1930. That these goods amount to a considerable figure seems highly probable, as may be gathered from the illustration afforded by piece-goods quoted in the preceding paragraph, and it may be reasonably inferred that the actual reduction in imports is more like 35% than 25%. The export figures tell a similar tale ; the 1930 total is 54- 5 million krans as against 79 million, showing a decrease of approximately 32%, but they cannot be considered at all reliable, because on the one hand, the effect of the exchange law has been to encourage exporters to underdeclare the value of their goods as much as possible and so reduce the amount of the sterling which they were bound to sell to the Government at 60, while on the other hand, the customs were empowered to add 10% to all declared values of exports to counteract this ten dency. The immediate future holds out little hope. With the purchasing power of the population being daily decreased by the imposition of new and increased taxation, the incidence of which falls in greatest measure on the poorest sections of the community, a continued shrinkage in all but the most inelastic market seems inevitable and when at length there is a return to more prosperous conditions much of the ground lost by British interests would seem likely to prove irrecoverable. The Russians appear bent on a policy of increasing their activities in Southern Persian markets, while signs are not wanting that the Japanese are only waiting for a favourable opportunity to enter the field. The success which has of late attended the latter's activities in the Arab coast markets has been most marked, and the ground has been gained almost entirely at the expense of British and Indian inte rests. Commimca^'cws.—Means of communication have remained much as in the previous year. While motor transport was less plentiful, it was available in excess of the trade requirements and rates remained low in spite of the heavy new tax on motor vehicles and increased cost of living. The firm of H. S. M. R. Kazerooni inaugurated a transport service of their own in the middle of the year and by the close were operating a fleet of some thirty trucks of from 3 to Ij tons. This venture although begun under the handicap of depressed trade has proved so far an unquali fied success chiefly, no doubt, owing to the fact that Messrs. Kazerooni have gene rally had enough merchandise of their own to forward up country, but also in no little measure to the very high standard of efficiency with which the scheme lias been organised. In spite of the very heavy taxation now imposed on motor vehicles no work worthy of mention was done on the Bushire-Shiraz road, the surface of which, in the kotals, is appalling and rapidly becoming worse. In January and February the Mashileh proved impassable to wheeled traffic but the road remained otherwise open for the whole year and, apart from isolated cases of brigandage, was safe. With the continuance of low rates of hire and restrictions imposed on the import of motor cars it seems inevitable that much of the notable progress made in transport facilities in 1928 must be lost. Security. —Security may be said to have been good. The tribal disturbances of the summer were confined to areas distant from the Bushire-Shiraz road, while individual cases of highway robbery were few. Smuggling. —With the imposition of a 20% customs surcharge at the beginning of the year added inducement to smuggle was presented. That this state of affairs will continue seems almost certain, for profits involved are high. The c. i. f. price of a bag of Marseilles sugar at Bushire is approximately 15/- while the wholesale price in the town was brought by revenue and other charges up to 180 krans per bag- in December—equivalent at the then bazaar rate to £1-15-0 or £ 3 at the Govern ment rate. Against this however must be put the fact that the Government have extended their control in Laristan and other districts in the interior, and while there is no great difficulty in landing goods on the Persian coast,^t is by no means so easy to transport them to the interior where the chief market lies. There was in conse quence much less smuggling during the year under review than formerly. MC171FDPostal Facilities. —These have remained as in the previous year. The Dutch K. L. M. aeroplane service made further trial flights through Bushire and the French Air Union service to Indo-China was inaugurated in December, when the first plane passed through. Foreign Commerical Enterprise. —The Junkers service maintained its excellent record of the previous year and ran punctually and regularly. A special freight plane was kept at Bushire during the latter part of the year, and was frequently chartered to bring down loads of opium from Shiraz and take up sugar. The Hansa line maintained their monthly sailings to the Gulf while eight Russian steamers visited the port during the year with cargo and one in ballast. There is talk of an American line shortly starting a monthly service of direct sailings to the United States, while the Japanese are also understood to be contemplating running ships to the Gulf. Herr Wassmuss, owing to financial troubles, was obliged to suspend his farming activities at Chagadak and there seems no likelihood of their being continued. He left for Tehran about the middle of the year. National Bank. —An arrangement was come to early in the year whereby rates of discount were jointly fixed by the Imperial Bank of Persia and the National Bank in order to put a stop to uneconomic cutting of rates which was profiting only the merchants. Business has been necessarily dull throughout the year, and if the Manager of the National Bank has been kept extremely busy it is to be attributed to the inadequacy and inefficiency of his staff, rather than to any heavy volume of business done. The majority of Bushire merchants naturally feel that it is safer to deal with the Imperial Bank of Persia and have not transferred their deposits. Opium. —It was only natural that opium, one of the most lucrative and impor tant of Persia's exports, should have been the object of the Government's special attentions in its search for sources of revenue and foreign exchange. As had been previously announced, the tax was raised in March to Tomans 375 per case and again in June to Tomans 400. On the other hand selling prices fell by approxi mately 15% from Rs. 2,300 to Rs. 2,000 per case while the purchase price increased slightly towards the close of the year. In point of fact, however, both the fall in price and increase in tax would seem to have been largely counteracted by the fall in the real Kran rate. The crop proved plentiful generally, and export figures, if lower than in 1929 when conditions were especially advantageous, were neverthe less surprisingly high, the total being 5,686 cases as compared with 6,812. It is observable that of these 2,823 were in respect of illicit shipments (a further 802 cases just missed inclusion in the 1930 figures) as against 2,338 in 1929, the reason for this increase being attributable to the fact that profits in the illict trade are higher, an advantage which heavier taxation and reduced selling price has tended to accentuate. There seems little doubt that the Persian Government have no intention of making any effort to reduce the area under opium cultivation. If they have increased taxes it is rather in the spirit of the owner of the proverbial goose, than on account of any sincere desire to reduce the crop. The scheme for placing the export of opium in the hands of a syndicate material ised in November in the form of a monopoly granted to Haji Amin-ut-Tujjar. The terms of the agreement were, to say the least, surprising. Haji Amin was to undertake to export, or at least to pay tax on 6,500 cases yearly. The period of the concession was to be five years, the amount of the tax to be £83 per case the first two years, £100 in the second two and £117 in the last. Furthermore 40% of the exchange proceeds of sale were to be sold to the Government and Haji Amin pledged himself to sell £150,000 to the Government at 60 in the first year. It was proposed to float a company to exploit the concession, but it was fairly obvious from the first that the big merchants interested in opium export did not consider the scheme practicable under the conditions imposed and refused to partici pate. At the end of the year Amin had as yet failed to induce anyone to join him and it seemed highly improbable that anyone would, unless the terms of the mono poly were much modified in his favour.11 The inference at first had been that illicit shipments would cease. Doubts were soon dispelled however. The very first shipment made by Amin was the 515 cases by the Toyo Maru J^o. 6 in December. It remains to be seen whether the latest policy of the Government, while actuated purely with the idea of obtaining more revenue and more exchange, will not in practice lead to a considerable reduction in the opium crop. On the one hand the price in the country has fallen so low that a shrinkage in the area put under poppy cultivation in 1931 seems inevitable, while on the other hand it is stated that Anatolian opium can apparently be prepared in a manner suitable for the Far East markets at approximately £100 per case c. i. f. a price with which Persian opium as at present taxed could not hope to compete. Should this indeed prove the case, limitation of the Turkish supply would appear the only factor to prevent Persian opium from losing its present market, at least as regards the legitimate .trade.12 APPENDIX I. komon the working gp the residency dispensary, bushire, for the year 1930. Major H. J. H. Symons, M.CL held cliarge of the appointment of Residency Surgeon fhroughout 1930. First Class Assistant Surgeon M. L. A. Steel was in sub-charge of the Dispensary and Jema dar Mohammed Ali Najmi was in sub-charge of the out-patient department during the year. Following a winter of comparatively cold weather with a rainfall slightly above the average, the beginning of the summer was noticeable for cooler weather than is generally experienced^!! Bushire. A prolonged spell of northerly winds for nearly three months appeared to be res ponsible for an increase in malaria, as during those three months a considerably larger number of mosquitoes than usual were prevalent in and around the town. There ware a number of severe cases of malaria at that time with many of cerebral type. The number of in-patients and out-door attendances are tabulated below being shown in comparison with those for 11 months of 1929. The Residency dispensary started its existence as a separate institution on its removal from the Bushire Charitable Hospital early in Febmarv 1929• In-patients, Out-patients. Operations. 1929 ... ... ... _ 54 9,230 85 1930 •• •• •• ... 67 9,346 235 Although the attendances do not show any increase in those for 11 months of 1929, there was a considerable increase in the number of operations and a decided increase in those operations classed as ' major operations The number of cases of malaria was 2,300 as against l s 900 in 1929. Tuberculosis of the lungs shews a drop to 28 as compared with 77 for the previous year. In both these diseases greater .accuracy in diagnosis has been secured by the systematic use of the microscope in examining blood smears and sputum. Under present conditions anyone requiring surgical treatment or operation has either to come to the Residency dispensary or go to Bahrain, Basrah or India. In this way a number of interesting cases have been dealt with, in most instances with success. The limited accommodation has been a drawback and has necessitated delay in dealing with many operable cases, so much so that there is a fairly large number on the waiting list. The surgical equipment of the operating theatre has been augmented with about £56 worth of instru ments and appliances, imported from England and the theatre is now reasonably equipped to deal with most emergencies. It may not be out of place here to mention a few points which have been noticed and which have been reported by Persian patients seen by the Residency Surgeon and his staff on the treat ment they have received at the hands of the Persian staff of the Charitable Hospital. One patient reported that there are no medicines available with the exception of Eno's fmit salts locally purchased which is issued to all and sundry, one teaspoonf ul at a time. Another reported that if any more elaborate treatment than this is required, a prescription is written which, on presentation at a local pharmacy,, is made up on payment of a sum of money. It is also stated that Bah rami ^ the head of the Charitable dispensary staff, is more than part owner of this pharmacy. He and his staff are genuine apostles of the hypodermic syringe and cheap German ampoule, with which the bazaar is flooded. A number of cases of scandalous misuse of this type of treatment have been personally en countered by the Residency Surgeon and his staff: to mention only two ; a case of ruptured spleen, obviously undiagnosed, treated with repeated injections of strychnine and caffeine resulting in death of the patient: and a case of acute gonorrhoea treated with vacines from the outset with neglect of local treatment, with the res alt that the unfortunate victim developed a violent acute arthritis attacking 7 joints simultaneously. APPENDIX II. Report on the working of the Quarantine Service gn the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf 1930 Inspection—The Residency burgeon visited Muscat and Bahrain in March 1930. Epidemics. —There were no epidemics of quarantinable diseases.in the Gulf during the year. Buildings. —These are in the same condition as in 1929, with the exception that a new quarantine site has been selected at Bahrain on a peninsula off Muharraq island and accommo dation for 2nd and 3rd class passengers has been provided. Excellent buildings have been erect ed with cook-houses at a cost of some Rs. 15,000. The whole peninsula is protected by a. barbed wire fence. Transport—The means of transport is the same as in 1928 and 1929. Disinfectors are in the same condition as in 1929, Code of procedure is the same as heretofore. Personnel. —Captain D. L.

Inter-tribal jealousies coupled with disarmament operations have been the cause of the state of unrest that has prevailed in the Southern Area, chiefly amongst the Boir Ahmedi factions, for most of the year under review. In March last Assad Khan, the Kalantar of Basht, was murdered at the insti gation, it is believed, of Ghulam Hussein Khan, Boir Ahmedi, and the ensuing confusion in the local affairs of that area, which had its repercussions amongst other tribal elements, caused the Company, on the advice of the Government, to withdraw the geological party then working in the vicinity of Behbehan. A very serious situation arose in June of the year under report. Just before dawn on the 25th of that month a party of about 300 Boir Ahmedi Sarhaddi tribes men raided the Company's camp at Gach-i-Pokak. The raid appears to have been designed in the first instance against one Qaid Habibullah, Chief of the Qaid Yusufi section of the Bavi tribe, whose flocks numbering several thousands were carried off by the marauders. They then turned their attention to the camp, which they proceeded to loot very thoroughly. Everything portable was removed and much of what remained was wantonly damaged. The European members of the Staff suffered no bodily harm, although their lives were frequently threatened during the raid and they were left with nothing more than the clothes they were wearing at the time. Military reinforcements, consisting of 2 officers and 130 men, were rushed to the scene of the incident from Ahwaz and Behbehan in transport provided by the Company and the situation quickly returned to normal. Military operations have continued against the Boir Ahmedi, the striking forces gradually closing in on tribal strongholds, and Basht, the centre of the dis order, was attacked and captured in August. It became increasingly evident, however, that complete disarmament of the Boir Ahmedi would not be effected without stubborn resistance and that the military authorities were faced with a prolonged and arduous task in enforcing their measures in Kuhgiloo territory where the difficult nature of the terrain is all in favour of the refractory tribesmen. The disaffected region is far removed from the Mishun Area, and the situation had long ceased to contain any threat to the safety of the Company's operations when it was decided in November last to curtail work at that centre, due to a change in the Company's drilling policy and not because of any political reasons. Evacua tion of Gach-i-Pokak, Gach Qaraghuli and Mishun has accordingly been carried out and only one European has been left in charge of such personnel and pro perty as remain in the Area on a suspended basi^.15 CHAPTEE III. Administration Report of the Consular District of Bandar Abbas and Lingah for the year 1930, Personnel. Bandar Abbas. —Mr. G. A. Richardson, O.B.E., held the post of His Majesty's Vice-Consul with the personal rank of Consul, throughout the year. Medical Officer. —Assistant Surgeon J. E. Sweeney, I.M.D., was in Medical Charge of the Consulate till the 10th August 1930, when he proceeded on leave to the United Kingdom. The post was then reduced to that of a Sub-Assistant Surgeoncy and Jemadar Abdul Rahim, I.M.D., appointed to relieve him. Foreign Representatives. Bandar Abbas. —Nil. Lingah. —Khan Sahib Ahmed bin Yussuf Khaja, a Persian subject used former ly to represent His Highness the Sultan of Muscat. Latterly the local authori ties declined to recognize him in that capacity, and in xiugust last called on him to surrender all correspondence with the Muscat Sultanate in his possession. It was learnt incidentally that Ahmed Khaja had been dispossessed by the Rais- i-Nazmieh under instructions from the Deputy Governor of the insignia of the title of Khan Sahib conferred on him by the Government of India, but no official report to that effect has been received from him. Local Government. Bandar Abbas. —Agha Mirza Zainal Abedin Khanlbrat (Motiman-el-Vazereh) continued to hold t.he F post of Governor of Bandar Abbas throughout the year. It is not clear whether the post is that of Governor or Deputy Governor. The present incumbent signs himself as Governor of Bandar Abbas and Minab. He is a weak and corrupt official, and addicted to drink and opium. Whilst pretending to be well disposed towards the Consulate he is fond of intrigue and can not be trusted. Agha Mirza Zainal Abedin is by no means popular with the merchants or with the other local officials, Minah. —Agha Mohamed Khan Ashkani represented the Governor of Bandar Abbas till the 7th July when he was relieved of his duties on the reappointment by Tehran of his predecessor Mirza Ali Khan Azad. Lingah. —Agha Abdul Hussain (Sheriff Humayun) the Deputy Governor left for Bushire on leave in May but did not return to his post. He was succeeded in June by Amir Shaukat Zand who did not remain long in office, Agha Mohamed Ali was appointed to relieve latter and arrived from Tehran on the 30th October. Popularly styled Sadid-es-Sultaneh, the present incumbent is well known in the Persian Gulf—where he has served for many years both at Bandar Abbas and Bushire in the capacity of Karguzar. Although he has always professed to be well disposed towards British officials he is reputed to be addicted to intrigue. In 1917 and 1918 he represented Russian interests at Bandar Abbas and is said to have corresponded with Soviet officials, after the war. In April 1929 whilst Assistant to the Governor of the Gulf Ports he was sent under arrest to Tehran charged with some offence of a political nature and was detained there under observation till his appointment at Lingah. Finance Department. Bandar Abbas. —His Majesty's Consulate now rarely comes into contact with this department officially but maintains friendly relations with the Amin-i- Malieh. The present incumbent is Mirza Mustapha Khan Bartar who held charge throughout the year. The affairs of the Finance Department appear to be running smoothly now. Minah. —Owing to disagreement with his chief, Amanullah Allahyari, the Finance agent, was replaced in August by a certain Mirza Mohamed Khan from Tehran, who was himself relieved by the appointment from Bushire in October of Faizullah Khan Mohtadi.16 Posts and Telegraphs. Bandar Ahhas. —Syed Ali Khan Sadr was Director tkrougliout the year. His administration was efficient. He is both reasonable and obliging in his dealings and is popular with the merchants. Since October, under orders issued by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs special postal bags hitherto made up at the Bombay and Karachi post offices for His Ma jesty's Consulate are required to pass through the local Persian office—where the bags are opened and their contents inspected before delivery. The bi-weekly postal motor service with Kerman and other places in the in-' terior functioned fairly regularly in spite of the insecurity of the road in the vicinity of the Tang-i-Zagh. As mentioned in the previous report telegrams arriving in code are delivered in a mutilated condition owing to the telegraph operators not being conversant with foreign characters and incompetent to even copy messages thus arriving. The present Director is hardly responsible for this unsatisfactory state as' apparently no attention has been paid to his representations in the matter by his 1 ^ chief at Bushire. Communication by telephone with Minab established in 1929 was main tained. Lingah. —No complaints were received in regard to the postal service which apparently worked satisfactorily under Ali Akbar Khan Farah. Municipality. Further improvement was observed in the condition of the town on the whole. A municipal board of six merchants elected by the townspeople was formed in July and some interest is being evinced in town affairs. A project for the introduction of drinking water into the town from one of the adjacent villages was taken in hand and test wells dug for the purpose. The work was in progress at the close of the year. Owing to the decision of the Central authorities to withdraw their annual grants hitherto earmarked from the ' Compounded road tax ' fund to Municipa lities in the provinces, there will be some difficulty in finding funds in future for the administration of the ' baladyia A scheme is under consideration whereby the necessary revenues will be raised by levying imposts on all packages of merchandise passing through the Customs house and recovering license fees from coffee houses, restaurants and liquor shops. It has not yet received the approval of Tehran. Red Lion and Sun Society. This movement that was fanned by the Governor of the Gulf Ports during his visit in 1929, has gradually waned since, and may be now said to have died a natural death. % The subscriptions promised by certain merchants have not been paid and the townspeople generally having lost all interest, have decided not to contribute. Lingah. —The Municipality has been re-organized on similar lines to that at Bandar Abbas under the Chairmanship of the Deputy Governor. Education. Bandar Ahhas. —The Rais-i-Mu'arif Mirza Syed Husain Khan Mudani pro ceeded to Tehran in February and did not return. The charge of schools was held by the Rais-i-Sahieh till October when the present incumbent Aghai Habibi was appointed. Two small Government preparatory schools were opened in the interior at the villages of Takht and Shameel. Lingah. —In addition to two national and one Government school, a pre paratory school has been opened at the village of Kung under Government auspi ces.17 Police Department. Bandar Abbas. —The force under the Rais-i-Nazmieh consisted of one other officer 40 foot police and 12 mounted men. Detachments of twenty men each under a non-commissioned officer are posted at Mi nab and on the Islands of Hen jam and Kishim* NaTb Abbas Kuli Khan Safiri was in command till the end of May and was succeeded in August by Syed Asadullah Khan Fakiri from Isfahan. The work of the police has been fairly efficient in general but some dissatis faction arose owing to the irregularity of the payment of their salaries in the Islands. A new helmet was introduced as the official head dress of the Police. Ling ah, —The force is now commanded by Naib II Salahi. Passport Department, Bandar Abbas. —The Police authorities now grant permission to British Poli tical Officers and the Commanders and the Officers of mail steamers parsing through out Bandar Abbas to disembark during the stay of their vessels in port. No difficulties were raised in granting exit visas to foreign subjects leaving J ask and other ports where there is no regular passport office. Amnieh (Gendarmerie). The Amnieh post here consisted of eight men under a non-Commissioned officer. Colonel Haji Baqir Khan, Commanding the Amnieh at Kerman, made two visits of inspection of the Kerman-Bandar Abbas road during the year, and the Baft-Bandar Abbas section thereof via the Tang-i-Zandan was inspected on one occasion by the Officer in charge. A few guards are now posted in each of the villages along the motor road leading to Kerman. It is proposed to establish Amenieh posts along the Coastal route between Mohammerah and Charbar where it is intended to construct a motor road. The survey of that route was undertaken during the year by two Russian officials from the Ministry of Roads. The Rais-i-Amnieh of Bushire visited Bandar Abbas in May in the Customs Motor Launch calling at the small intermediate ports where posts will be ultimately established. Judicial Department. Bandar Abbas. —It is inconceivable that the town and the district of Bandar Abbas have no proper Courts. Commercial interests labour under a great draw back in consequence of the absence of an Adlieh Court, suits of any importance being required to be filed at Bushire. The Sulhieh Court that was established at the end of 1928 has been closed Since the 18th August when its President proceeded on recess, Tehran. Ling ah and Minab. —There are no courts of any description at these places and the merchants complain that no satisfaction can be obtained by referring their Civil and Commercial disputes to the local Deputy Governors for artbitration. Customs. Bandar Abbas. —Mirza Riza Quli Khan Ashraf was Provincial Director of Customs throughout the year. His administration was efficient and satisfactory to all concerned. During his absence on inspection in November and December, a Belgian Monsieur Paul Wolters from Bushire officiated for him. He fully justified the reputation acquired prior to his arrival here of being an obstructionist and was successful in causing friction with local merchants who, while refusing to have any dealings with him, complained the Tehran about hia arbitrary and uncompromising attitude generally. It was proposed to widen the masonary end of the present MC171FD18 Customs pier but tlie project did not fall in with the views of merchants and importers who had been asked to contribute towards the cost of construction. The latter contended that, in spite of trade depression, Customs taxation was already excessive and intolerable. Owing to the inadequacy of the local preventive service only a single capture of contraband merchandise was effected. In this case, the Customs Launch ' Azer baijan ' on her way from Bushire to Bandar Abbas confiscated and brought in 54 £acks of sugar and 12 chests of tea taken from a dhow off the Shipku Coast, Ling ah. —Monsieur Nissan Haim continued to be Director throughout the year. He is a quiet and friendly official and anxious to afford facilities. Persian Troops. Bandar Abbas. —Sultan Syed Hussain Khan Ghamami was in Military Com-, mand of the Southern Gulf ports until relieved early in October by Sultan Allahyar Khan. Colonel Abbas Khan Alburz Commanding the Kerman Brigade inspected the troops in June. The improvement in the morale and discipline of the troops observed during the two preceding years continued to be maintained. The control of the troops stationed at Charbar has been transferred to Seistan, those at Bandar Abbas and Jask being still under the Kerman Brigade. No Military operations of any importance were undertaken during the year under review. There were no serious steps taken to disarm tribesmen in the interior, but an order was received from Tehran to prohibit the import of sporting guns and ammuni- ■ tion. A large quantity of both found in the possession of merchants at Bandar Abbas was confiscated by the military authorities and several consignments that had been received in the Customs House had to be re-exported to the respective firms in England and Europe whence they had been shipped. The Conscription law has not as yet been enforced in this district. Lingah. —Sultan Ismail Khan was transferred to Dashtistan in February and Naib III Mohamed Khan assumed command of the small detachment stationed here. A Sultan with 350 regulars detached from the force operating at Lar was deputed in January to disarm the tribes inhabiting the Shipku Coast, but without appreciable result. Condition of the Country. Bandar Abbas.—The establishment of a police force in 1927 is having a good effect. The town is fairly free from crime, only a couple of cases of petty theft having been recorded during the year. The corpse of a man was washed ashore near the Customs pier in April. Foul play was suspected, but no arrests were made in this connection. District. Biyaban. —The Chiefs of the Taherzai tribes complained to both the local and Central authorities of the excesses being committed by the followers of Mir Barakat Khan, but no action was taken against the latter. A few skirmishes ensued between the contending factions. Lar.—The rebel leader Zadun Khan continued to harass the troops and was a source of anxiety to the Persian Government during the summer. He actually re-captured that town in July but after sacking the place was compelled to beat a hasty retreat on the advent of a superior force of regulars, making good his escape eventually. The Commander Major Mohamed Taki Khan was killed in the fighting incident tal to the re-occupation. Condition o f the Roads. The routes leading to Kerman by the motor road via the Tang-i-Zagh and also by the caravan road via the Tang-i-Zandan were rendered insecure during the year on account of the frequent depredations of Farsis and Bahaloo robbers in the case of the former and the raids made on the latter by the semi-savage Bashakardi tribesmen who rove about the neighbouring districts.19 Bandar Abbas-Kerman Motor Road. This was practically closed from October to December owing to the activities of the highwaymen whose stronghold is at Mazajan in the Fars area. Ten attacks on the lorries transporting goods to and from the interior and on donkey caravan using that road were recorded during the year. A considerable quantity of merchandise belonging to Persian traders was robbed, two motor drivers killed and three of the Amnieh guards posted on duty wounded. Bandar Abbas-Kerman Caravan road via Tang-i-Zandan. Three instances were reported in which attacks were made on camel caravans and merchandise looted. Lar-Bandar Abbas Road. —-The caravans were interfered with on two or three occasions in the months of January and June during the activities of the followers of the rebel Zadun Khan. Road Constructions. —Nothing in this direction was undertaken during the year, notwithstanding the fact of the big revenue accruing to the Government from the taxes collected at the Customs houses at the ports under the head of the ' Co- pounded Eoad Taxes '. Motor traffic with Kerman was suspended during the greater part of January as the road was impassable on account of the fall of snow ; and again in July when heavy rains washed away a part of the track near the Tang-i-Zagh. In March the Armenian inspector in charge submitted an estimate to the Ministry of Roads for repairs to the motor road but as no credits were sanctioned, the necessary work was not -carried out. Lingah. —In January a survey was carried out of the proposed motor road from Lingah to Lar but project has been dropped as no further steps have been taken in the matter. Slave Traffic. —Vague reports are sometimes received of the kidnapping in the Biyaban area of men, women and children by Bashakardi tribesmen, who transport their captives in dhows to the opposite Arabian Coast, where they are sold as slaves. No slaves sought asylum at this Consulate with a view to receiving their manu mission during the year. In April, it was reported that four fugitive slaves arrived at Hen jam from the Arab Coast and were disposed of by the Persian authorities at that place. Aviation. Bandar Ahbas.- —The aerodrome here is still maintained although it is falling into disuse, owing to aircraft not being allowed to descend at this port, except with special permission from the Persian Government. Movements of Aircraft, British.—Vom machines arrived during the year :— (1) The ' Gipsy Moth ' piloted by Miss Amy Johnson flying solo from England to Australia arrived from Baghdad on the 9th May and left the following morning for Karachi. (2) The ' Puss Moth ' under Captain Matthews in his flight from England to Australia arrived on the 21st September and took off the next morning for Karachi. (3) The ' Gipsy Moth ' piloted by flying Pilot J. Grierson of the Royal Air Force from England to Karachi halted for a few hours on the 11th ! October and continued the flight later to Charbar. (4) The ' Gipsy Moth ' flown by the Indian aviator Mr. A. Murad compet ing for the Agha Khan prize for a flight from India to Cape Town arrived on the 29th of December and took off the same afternoon for Lingah. Italian . Captain Marino Savino in a Seaplane, attempting a flight from Italy to Australia, arrived from Bushire on the 11th July alighting in the vicinity of this roadstead. He left the following day for Karachi but was compelled to descend20 at Cliarbar wliere his macliine was slightly damaged owing to a rough sea. Having decided to abandon his flight to Australia he returned from Karachi on the 15th August and continued the flight to Basra on the following day. Lingah. —The Air liners of the Imperial Airways Limited conveying mails continued to refuel here weekly both on their westward and eastward bound flights. The machines of the recently inaugurated Dutch Air Mail services to and from the Dutch East Indies also use Lingah as a re-fuelling station. Visits of His Majesty's Ships. —These have not been as frequent in recent years as they used to be, owing to the discourtesy of the Persian authorities and the obstacles placed in the way of one of His Majesty's Ships. These difficulties have, however, to a great extent been obviated, since representations on the subject were made by His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, (1) H.M.S. ' Crocus ' arrived on the 28th January with His. Majesty's Consul on board, returning off tour. (2) H.M.S. ' Cyclamen ' escorting the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on board the Indian Government Telegraph steamer arrived on the 22nd November and sailed for Henjam the same even ing. Hen jam. —H.M.S. ' Effingham ' flying the flag of Naval Commander-in- Chief, East Indies Station, visited Henjam on the 24th and 25th November. Basidu. —After transferring his flag to H.M.S. ' Triad '' the Commander-in- Chief visited the Station on the 26th November. The small detachment from one of His Majesty's Sloops in the Persian Gulf that had been posted on the Island since 1928, was withdrawn in June. Visits of His Majesty's Representatives. —The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel H. V. Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf^on board the ' Patrick Stewart ' in the course of his winter tour inspected the Consulate on the 22nd November and called at Henjam on the 23rd. Mr. G. A. Richardson, O.B.E., His Majesty's Consul and Assistant to the Re sident visited Lingah between the 17th and 25th January, and Henjam on the 26th and 27th January. British Interests. Consular Escort. —This consisted of two pensioned Indian Sowars and of two ghulams recruited locally. Under instructions from His Majesty's Minister, the escort was disarmed during the year. Indo-European Telegraph Department. Bandar Ahhas. —Mr. G. DeSmidt, D.S.O., Director of the Persian Gulf Section of the Indo-European telegraph Department, arrived on board the (£ Patrick Stewart ' on the 19th March for the inspection of the local office. Lingah. —In spite of being inadequately equipped owing to the order of the Persian Government prohibiting the import of accessories and wireless stores, the Radio Station functioned as satisfactorily .as was possible. Imperial Bank of Persia. —Mr. F. H. Johnson relieved Mr. H. E. Walton as Manager on the 22nd May but on the former's resignation and departure for the United Kingdom in October Mr. E. M. Murray officiated temporarily. The present incumbent is Mr. I. Macrae who took over charge on the 21st November. Owing to general trade depression, and the establishment locally of a compet ing bank, the transactions of this branch were greatly restricted, and were practi cally at a stand-still since March, on the introduction by the Government of the ' Commission of Control of Foreign Exchange The Sterling and rupee rates of exchange were then fixed at an absurdly low figure and remained so till the end of the year. Needless to say it was not possible for the Bank to transact any appre ciable business under these conditions.22 The economic pressure in general and the heavy increase in taxation coupled with irksome restrictions in trade afford him sufficient pre-occupations. The introduction of the Pahlevi head 'gear and the enforcement of the Persian dress regulations which are not popular in a^y part of the country caused a deal of heart-burning both at Bandar Abbas and at Lingah. Quarantine and Sanitation. —Dr. Mahomed Ali Khan Muayed Hikmet held the post of Quarantine Medical and Sanitary Officer till November 21st when he was transferred to Kermanshah and succeeded by Dr. Ali Khan Amedi from Bushire. Dr. Mahomed Ali Khan was very attentive to his duties and tactful in his medical inspection of British ships. Some improvement was observed in the sanitation of the town during his regime. No epidemics were reported in this district during the year. Town Charitable Dispensary. —^Assistant Surgeon J. E. Sweeney, I.M.D., held harge till the 10th August, when he proceeded on leave to the United Kingdom. He was releived by Sub-Assistant Surgeon and Jemadar Abdur Rahim, I.M.D. The Dispensary functioned satisfactorily but in view of its poor financial con ditions its closing down in the near future appears to be inevitable. Essentially a philanthrophic institution and maintained by voluntary subscriptions, we can hardly expect very much from the few leading merchants who have hitherto supported it generously, owing to adverse trade conditions combined with excessive taxation. The dispensary cannot now be said to be political asset it was when the idea for its establishment was originally conceived. In my opinion the Persian Govern ment is being encouraged to evade its obligations to the local community to whom no medical aid is afforded as a ' quid pro quo ' for rates and taxes paid. No contribution is ordinarily made by the local Municipality for its up-keep. The attendance of out-patients during the period under report was as follows^ as compared with the two preceding years :— ,. 1930 .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 7,432 1929 .. . • • • • • • • • • .. 6,664 1928 .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 7,620 The prevailing diseases were malaria, diseases of the eye and disorders of the digestive system. Economic Conditions. —The rain fall in the district was up to the average but the ravages of locusts were 'reported everywhere. The damage to the crops was considerable especially at Minab and the Shamilat. Two earth tremors, slight and of short duration, were recorded. Anti-Locust Campaign. —The Persian Government have at last awakened to the fact of the seriousness of the locust scourge in the provinces of Persia. A commission from the Ministry of Economics to enquire into and deal with this question was despatched to Kerman in March from which a small staff was deputed for anti-locust measures in the Bandar Abbas district. A quantity of arsenic admixed with barley flour was scattered over various open spaces in the Gachin, Kashar and Shamil areas, and the villages in the vicimly of Minab, but from reports received, does not appear to have had much effect on the locust invasions in those parts. The operations, nevertheless, were gradually extended to Daulatabad and Ginau and later in the direction of Sirjan and con tinued till the end of May. G. A. RICHARDSON, His Majesty's Consul and Assistant to the Resident^ Bandar Albas,23 CHAPTEB IV. ADMINISTRATION REPORT. His Majesty's Consulate, Kerwan. for the year 1930. A.—B ritish I nterests. 1. His Majesty's Consulate : personnel. —Major E. W. C. Noel, C.I.E., D.S.O., remained in charge througliout tlie year. In February he visited Bandar Abbas and in September-October travelled to Tehran and back. Khan Bahadur Abdul Alim, L .K., held the post of Indian Attache to His Majesty's Consul, throughout the year. 2. Consulate ]Vork.^{a) 57 British subjects were registered during the year. {b) When I arrived at Kerman in the summer of 1929 I found the qanat which waters the Consulate Garden badly silted and giving only one-third of its proper flow. 1 was told that owing to the fragmentation of ownership the problem of collecting funds to put the qanat in order was beset with great difficulties, but that if the British Consul took the matter in hand something might be done. I agreed to do so and now after 15 months and the collection and expenditure of nearly T. 6,000 the water has increased by 200 per cent, and the qanat owners and users are genuinely appreciative. I have welcomed the work as it has provided opportuni ties of seeing large numbers of Persians of all classes who, under present conditions in Persia, avoid the Consulate. There have been frequent meetings lasting many hours at which the attendance has been over forty. Now that the work is nearing completion I have been approached by other qanat owners asking me to take over all the qanats of the Kerman district. At one time I had some fears that the authorities might view my activities as a cloak to something else, but the Governor-General has on more than one occasion afforded me assistance in recovering moneys due from defaulters. (c) Kerman and Yezd import about 400 tons of cotton yarn every year from abroad, although cotton of more than double this quantity is grown locally. The question converting the local cotton into yarn was discussed with the merchants and landowners who expressed their readiness to embark on the enterprise provided they felt sure that the local cotton could be spun into yarn of 20 counts which forms the bulk of the imports. To decide this question a sample of local cotton was sent to Bombay for spinning. At the close of the year it had not returned but the export from the Mill indicated that it had proved satisfactory for conversion into No. 20-S yarn. In September I visited Tehran and obtained an interview with the Minister of Economies who promised the full support of Government. In November when His Majesty visited Kerman I took the opportunity to bring the proposal to his notice and he was pleased to commend it and even held out hopes of investing his own money in the enterprise. {d) The American car and lorry is so well established in Persia that it is diffi cult for a British make of motor vehicle to invade this preserve by ordinary methods of competition. A method which, however, suggests itself is to take advantage of the uses to which 6-wheelers could be placed in Persia. The majority of Persian roads must remain unmetalled tracks for many years to come and as such become impassable in winter for periods running into weeks. Moreover there are still many towns connected by tracks not passable for 4-wheelers but which could be used by 6-wheelers with an expenditure of a few Tomans. An example is Kerman- Khorasan. There is a considerable pilgrim traffic between these two centres which at present has to follow a roundabout route either via Duzdap or Tehran. The direct route across the Lut to Birjand would effect a saving of nearly 300 miles. In December I reconnoitred the Kerman end of the route and found an alignment which could be made passable for 6-wheelers at a cost of a hundred Tomans. 3. Indo-European Telegraph Department. —Mr. C. E. Duggan was in charge of the Sub-Division throughout the year and Mr. A. Robertson continued to hold the post of Asisstant Superintendent, in charge Kerman Office. Mr. Bottomley re lieved Mr. T. ff. Lovell as Assistant Superintendent, Dehaneh Baghi, on the 27th September. From the time of H. M. the Shah's arrival at Duzdab in November until his departure from Kerman a special through wire was placed at the disposal of the24 Persian Telegraph Aflmmistration for His Majesty's telegrams.

Generally it may be said that the School is progressing satisfactorily. Girls' School—There has been a noticeable readiness with which the people of the town are sending their children to this school : in fact the parents demand with msistence the admission of their children. In the year 1929 owing to insufficient the number of pupils was reduced from 204 to 183. At the close of 1930 there v. ere 214 children on the school books with an average attendance of 200 • further 70 to^T VlT empJoyed and a new class opened for small children. About (I ?

There are 3 patrols, but as the Com-25 pany lias grown to 29 members it is hoped in the near future to open a 4tli patrol. Miss J, F. Woodroffe is in charge of the School. (c) Medical—There was no change in the stai? of the Medical Mission during the year, although new Persian assistants had to be taken to replace those who had left during the preceding year. Despite the appalling filth of the town the general health of the place, kept fairly good, but for an outbreak of typhoid fever m the spring in the adjacent village of Sar-i-Asiab. The welfare work which is year by year being increasingly appreciated by the towns-people of all classes and more stan is needed for this branch of the work. Miss Stratton is in charge. Dr G. E. Dodson remained in charge of the Men's Hospital and Bliss Pigott of the Women's Hospital. r ^ The value of the medical work has continued to increase and the benefits conferred are widely and deeply appreciated. The number of patients treated this year and the last year were as follows : - 6. Europecm Cemetery. A sum of T. 360 was collected by subscription from the European Community and the existing cemetery which had become very dilapi dated was extended and put in good order. 7 • Carpets, —The following are the firms trading in Carpets :— The Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, Limited ..

The export of carpets and tribal rugs expressed in thousands of Krans in 1930 and three preceding years was as follows The increase in the figures of 1930 is the reflection of the boom year of 1928-29. The Kermani carpet is over a year on the looms and there is therefore a consider able lag between the state of the market and that of the weaving industry. Howr ever, in spite of these figures, the situation at the end of the year was a serious one. One thousand of the 4,000 looms were idle and it is calculated that in another 6 months only 1,000 looms will be working. As 75 per cent, of Kerman's exports are carpets and she scarcely grows enough foodstuffs for her own consumption, the outlook is indeed black and a period of acute distress is in store.

Buyers in America are demanding a reduction in price consonant with the depreciation of the Kran not realizing perhaps that what is spent on weaving and dying a carpet in Kerman is but 20 per cent, of its retail selling price in the States. 8. Communications and Security—{a) Communications. —No new roads have been made during the year under report, and little has been done to improve exist- ing routes. The Bandar Abbas motor road has proved unreliable as the Southern Section which can boast scarcely a single bridge or even culvert is subject to serious wash-outs in the winter. Moreover the Tang-i-Zagh which had been reported against as an alignment in 1920 by British Engineers is subject to interruption by land slides. As the result of the Shah's visit in November the question of a settled road policy and programme came to the fore. Kerman was made the centre for road administration in South-East Persia which includes Lingah, Yezd and Birjand. The programme so far put forward is to build a Coast road to the vicinity of the frontier of British Baluchistan and to construct two arterial lines of communi cation from Bandar Abbas, one to Tehran and the other via Jiruft to Khurasan, The Army, however, is in favour of the development of Charbar as a port and the construction of a strategic road to Bampur. This alignment has been surveyed and the estimate worked out at T. 800,000. (6) Security. —Law and order has on the whole been well maintained with the exception of the South-West corner of the Province where robbers from Ears and Lar have continually been robbing traffic on the Bandar Abbas motor route. To wards the end of the year there was a recruidescence of Baluch raiding in the western fringe of theLut but in the majority of cases the Amnieh intercepted the robbers and forced them to abandon their spoils. It would not seem that this flare up of former activities has any real significance. (c) Posts. —Owing to the unsettled condition of the Bandar Abbas-Kerman motor road the mails on this section have been irregular, but no actual robbery of mails took place. The post which is supposed to take 46 hours for the journey has, in many cases, taken over three weeks in transit. During September the mails from Bandar Abbas travelled via Bushire and Ispahan for 3 weeks. The Duzdab mail has been working satisfactorily. Owing however to the bi-weekly service of trains having been made into a weekly one, the letters take more time in transit than before. (d) Wireless. —The wireless station, which had never been in operation since its erection by the Russians in 1926, started functioning before the arrival of H. M. the Shah in November. Since then it has been in working order, but as each operation cost the Telegraph Department T. 6 and there is hardly any work, the station remains to all intents and purposes closed. (e) Aviation.—Three flights from Tehran to Kerman of Junker's planes carrying passengers, took place during the year under review. No improvement has been made to the aerodrome to the North-West of the town. B.—L ocal G overnment and P olitics. 9. Condition of Country. —The good order and security introduced by Reza Shah is undoubtedly appreciated especially by the villagers and those who suffered at the hands of raiders such as the Baluchis. On the other hand the Shah's popu larity on this score is to a great extent discounted r and especially in the towns, by the heavy taxation and the depreciation of the Kran both of which are placed to his account. 10. Commission of Enquiry. —The Persian Government in its campaign to raise the standard of their public service frequently sent commissions from the Capital to investigate the work of Local Officials on specific complaints made against them. Undoubtedly the policy must, through the element of fear, produce results, but they tend to be superficial.27 The following is a smnmary of the Commissions of Enquiry that have visited Kerman :— Months. Nature of Enquiry and result as far as known. January- February July .. September October Do. December Representatives from Ministries of Interior, Justice, Finance and Army. Do. do. • Mirza Hussein Khan Umeed of Ministry of Justice. Do. do. Sultan Ali Akbar Khan Azad of the Police Department. Sertip Azizullah Khan Zarghami of the Amnieh. Mirza Hussein Khan Umeed and Shahshehani. Provincial Director of Finance arrested and sent to Tehran. Clerk arrested on charge of peculation. Governor of Khabis suspended for misappro priation of Government funds. Six arrests of officials made on charges of corruption. Mirza Kassim Khan and 3 officials of Sejjil-i- Ahwaal Department sent to Tehran for trial on charges of corruption. Investigated complaints against officials of the Nazmieh. Result not known. Reduced an Amnieh officer to the ranks for incapacity. Investigated complaints against officials at Baft. Result not known. 11. Local Officials and Departments—Governor-General. —The Governor- General, Mirza Abul Hassan Khan, Peernia, quarrelled with Furuzan, the acting Provincial Director of Finance, and was recalled to Tehran in June and replaced by Tadayyun. The latter is a much pleasanter person to deal with. The Governor-General, the majority of officials and the leading notables have been ready to cultivate friendly relations with His Britannic Majesty's Consu late, but there is always the latent fear that their attitude may be misrepresented at the Capital. In July a pleasant luncheon party was arranged by Nusret-ul- Mamalik in his country place which was attended by many Persians and English- The Chief of Police is said to have sent a sensational account to the Shah men. and since then the Governor-General, who at first was very friendly and mixed in the social life of the European community, has adopted a more reserved attitude although in private he has asked me not to judge by outward appearances, and at the same time assured me that his inward feelings remain the same. Finance and Revenue. —The visit of Inspectors from Tehran, referred to under the heading ' Commission of Enquiry ', and their trial of several of the Malieh officials resulted in a few of these being suspended and, in some cases, removed. This caused great resentment and inaction among the other officials of the depart ment, and added to the deterioration of the state of the Finance Department which began with the disappearance of American control in 1928. The arrears have increased in spite of several circulars from Tehran urging the Finance authorities to action. The new laws passed by the Medjliss in March with regard to the increased registration fee on vehicles and income-tax caused some consternation. Some owners of private cars have already stopped using their vehicles. The reassessment of revenue of the Kerman province which was suspended in September 1929 has to be taken in hand Revenue Assessment. again in the beginning of new Persian year (March 1931), and necessary orders in this connection have already been received by the Finance Department. Opium. —Smuggling has continued as in previous years but towards the end of the year contraband opium from Ears decreased owing to the disturbances in that province. The total fines collected on account of contraband during the' year amounted to only T. 3,500. The Malieh authorities made several attempts, mostly unsuccessful, to induce the individual consumers of opium to buy a regular monthly supply of taxed opium from the Malieh godown. searching of houses of all classes of the inhabitants increased in the latter months of the year. Ihe income of the Department from opium which in 1929 had fallen from 1. 15,000 to T. 5,000 has further decreased and in 1930 it yielded T. 4,000 only, excluding the fines.28 Persian National Bank. —Mr. Stanislav Stelino was removed from tlie Managership of the Kerman branch early in the year for acting too much on his own initiative. His successor Herr Meyer, influenced by his predecessor's fate, went to the opposite extreme. In fact Persians using a well-known expression said that he had to refer to Tehran before he could even have a drink of water. This practice has continued and the resulting delays which attend the simplest of transactions engender a feeling of contempt among the public. In April the National Bank was authorized by Tehran to collect defective silver coins under certain conditions. The National Bank opened a branch at Rafsinjan in September and the question of opening branches at Bam and Sirjan also came under consideration during the latter part of the year but has been turned down for the present. Police. —-Yawar Seyyid Sadiq Khan was the Chief of Police at the end of the year. The Police force in Kerman is too small in number to cope with the require ments of the province. The only important event concerning this Department was the change of their uniform which is commented on infavourably by the public. Justice, —The Istinaf (Appeal) Court was duriig the year allowed to act as a Court of Tamiz (High Court of Appeal) for cases decided by the Bidayat Court (Court of the First Instance). The Sulhieh (Small Cause) Court has only one Judge, who, though well reputed, is unable to cope with the large amount of work accumulated. The Sulhieh Court hears civil cases up to a limit of Tumans 500 and also criminal cases of small importance and it is therefore to this Court that the majority of cases go. The British subjects and firms also suffer delay in settlement of their claims on this account. Posts and Telegraphs, —New Post Offices were opened during the year at Jiruft and Rudbar. Education. —The following figures will show the progress made in Education during the year 1930 :— Boys' Schools Girls' Schools Boy students ,. Girl students ,. Teachers At the time of the Shah's arrival in November all the School boys had turned out in new dresses lining the road leading to the Government House and cheered the Shah who, however, paid no attention to them. All requests to the Shah to visit the schools or give an audience to a representation of the Education Depart ment were also ignored. Amnieh. —Sarhang Haji Baqir Khan, Karaghuzlu, has been in charge since May. He has avoided communication with the Consulate. The Amnieh force in the province which in 1929 numbered 1,000 has been raised to 1,400 as per following distribution 1928. 1929. 1930. 51 63 67 8 8 11 . 2,820 3,000 3,100 679 700 775 307 320 348 13 compared with 12 in 1929.

E. Peernia, recom mended the transfer of Waziri, the Chief of Municipality in Kerman, to Khabia29 as Deputy Governor, and suggested as relief the name of his protege, Eafat-un- Nmm, formerly an assistant m the Nazmieh for many years. In March the change was sanctioned but Rafat-un-Nizam shortly afterwards fell out with the acting Financial Director which eventually resulted in the recall of the Governor-General and Furuzan and the removal of Eafat-un-Mzam himself azin was recalled from Khabis and he remained in charge till the end of the year. In June the Municipality Committee was formed in accordance with the new regulations ana was set to the task of finding new sources of revenues to replace the previous grant from the road tax fund. It is stated that the new taxes, if carefully collected, will yield from T. 40,000 to T. 50,000 per annum.. The members of the Committee, however, complain that while they are consulted in proposing and levying new taxes, they have no say in their disposal. In addition to the new taxes, a house tax of 3 per cent, on the calculated annual rent is to be levied from the new Persian Year (March). This will be over and above the 5 per cent, collected by the Finance Department. The whole income on tins account will in future go to the Municipality chest. The mam artery road which was cut through the middle of the town last year, involving the demolision of about 100 houses, was improved during the latter part of the year under the superintendence of an engineer from Tehran, who is said to be an Afghan. At the time of writing further houses were under' demoli tion to straighten the road as far as possible and an allotment of T. 20,000 had been sanctioned for the work. It is not expected that the owners of demolished houses will be compensated to any appreciable extent or that the sum of T. 20,000 will all be actually spent on the work. M. the Shah inspected this Ivhayaban one early morning, when on visit to Kerman last November, and was certainly not pleased with its conditions or the aspect which the demolished houses presented. The Baladiyeh have not yet taken up the question of improving the existing roads through or round the town which are in miserable condition, but they have improved the lighting. Locusts.- The jurisdiction of liis Majesty s Consulate, Kerman, extends over an area of 70,000 square miles, in which postal and telegraph facilities are few and far between, and the machinery of administration is nebulous. It will thus be understood that it is difficult to obtain detailed or accurate estimates of locust movements and habits. During the months of February to June locusts visited Kerman nine times and did slight damage on two or three occasions. They also visited the various districts causing damage in which the district of Bardsir suffered the most. Since 1896 this was the seventh year in which locusts visited the province, but for the last four years (1927 to 1930) they have visited the province conse cutively. ^In 1930 the direction of flight was generally from South and South- West to North and North-East. It would seem that swarms tend to fo low the foot of a mountain range, sending columns up the valleys to lay their eggs and then rejoin the main stream. At the beginning of May I was on the mountain range to the East of Kerman which runs North-West and South-East and is about 11,000 feet in elevation. Swarms of locusts could be observed trying to cross the moun tain, but being turned back by the opposing wind. Enquiries whether any return of locusts from the Persian plateau to the South had been observed show no evidence that any such return flight takes place, and I am inclined to think that none of the locusts which invade the Persian plateau in spring and early summer, or for that matter any of their descendents, ever return to the land of their origin. Mirza Mahmood Khan, Fateh, the chief of the ocust campaign organization in Persia, accompanied by an Armenian Assistant and 25 pupils of the School of Agriculture, Tehran, commissioned for the Kerman Province in connection with the destruction of locusts, arrived from Tehran in February. Fateh sent out these ' pupils in batches towards Bandar Abbas, Bam, Narmashir and Jiruft. Locusts had, however, already appeared and the mission had brought with them insufficient poison to cope with the requirements of the whole Province. Their method was not popular as the peasants lost some of their live stock that grazed MC171FDao on the pastures on which, poison had been scattered. In the month of May the anti-locust staff exhausted their budget of T. 16,000 and Fateh left for T hran after visiting Duzdap and Baluchistan. He left a representative in Kerman by the name of Qaveh. An article appeared in a local pape in May arguing that the allotment of T. 16,000 could have been better spent in paying the villagers for locusts' eggs and hoppers. It was asserted that villagers would be willing to bring in 5 batmans for a Kran, and that this besides being cheaper than the poisoning of hoppers would put some money in the pockets of cultivators who are notoriously the poorest in Persia. The total damage by locusts in the Province during 1930 was one-third of the total crops. Sejjil-i-Ahwaal {Census) Department. —Owing to various cases of corruption having been discovered and severely dealt with, the Sejil-i-Ahwaal Department is now carrying on its work more efficiently. In the month of September the head of the Kerman office of the department and 3 other officials were sent up to Tehran for trial. The department extended its work to the remaining districts of the province which had not been dealt with till the end of 1929. 12. Local Politics. —The year 1930 has been uneventful in the political sense for the Kerman province. At the beginning of the year the last echoes of the rebellion in Fars had died away and Kerman had sunk into its usual apathy. The elections to the 8th Medjliss began on the 24th August and were completed in October. In all cases except one all the previous deputies were returned in accordance with the instructions received from the Capital by the Governor- General. The exception was in the case of Sirjan constituency from which Dr. Ahya-ul-Mulk, aprotegeofSardar Assad, the War Minister, was returned in place of the former Deputy, Mirat-us-Sultaneh, son of Sardar Nusret, C.B.E. Hashimi, the editor of a local paper ' Bidari ' who during the 1927 election had been the head of the Anjuman-i-Nuzzar (Election Committee) and holds communistic views, was left out this year with the result that he fell out with the Governor-General on whom he made a number of veiled attacks in his paper. The Governor-General at once issued orders for the collection of copies delivered and the paper remained under suspension till the elections were over. The public showed little enthusiasm since they knew that the deputies nom- nated by Tehran must in any case be returned. In the case of two deputies for Kerman town the number of votes was increased by the Municipality sweepers being ordered to vote twice a day. H. M. the Shah visited Kerman in November but was apparently disgusted with its backwardness and poverty. This gave rise to a rumour that the status of the Province was to be reduced from that of an Ayalat to that of a Vilayat but nothing has so far transpired. The visit of His Majesty came on the whole as a disappointment. The absence of any pomp or ceremony chilled any latent enthusiasm that may have existed. On the road to Kerman the Shah sat alone in his car sometimes a mile or two ahead of everyone else. The villagers refused to believe that it was the Shah who had passed. Arrived at Kerman and the Istible over. His Majesty scarcely appeared during his two days' stay. He did not even inspect the new Military barracks. His only appearance was to visit the Military wireless station, erected by the Russians in 1926, but which had never functioned till a few days before his arrival. His Majesty, while in Kerman, refused practically all presents, saying that he had not come to Kerman to make money. He promised to re-visit Kerman in two years time, and in the meantime see if something could be done to ameliorate matters. Press. —Nothing objectionable from the point of view of British interests has appeared in the local Press. There are at present nominally four papers published at Kerman.31 V 13. Health and General Welfare.- —Alarming but unfounded reports of cliolera at Taktit-i-Kliuslikuyeli near Bandar Abbas were received in April when the Health Officer proceeded to Bandar Abbas to make necessary enquiries. He reported on return that the cause of the epidemic was a surfeit of locusts. In the month of June the Health Officer received instructions from the Capital to establish quarantine posts against cholera, which had appeared in Jallalabad (Afghanistan). He proceeded to Bam to see if any posts could be established above Bam in the direction of Persian Baluchistan and Sistan, but returned with out achieving any object. There were a few cases of typhoid at Sar-i-Asiab, a village 3 miles to the East of the town, in February, otherwise the general health of the town has been fair in snite of the extreme poverty of the masses and their under-nourishment. 14. Russian Interests. —The acting Soviet-Consul General, Ispahan, visited Kerman in the middle of August and paid a call on His Majesty's Consulate which was returned. In the month of September three Bolshevik agents, Predit Echensinj, Yoori Bezrofoff and Yoori Wdrksi arrived from Duzdab with the intention of proceeding to Persian Baluehistan. They called themselves locust experts and expressed a desire to visit Jiruft and Purdbar. The Governor-General arranged for them to be accompanied by the Kerman representative of the Locust Department. They tried to visit Bandar Abbas also, but the condition of the road in September forced them to return from Sirjan. They eventually left for Tehran. Early in the year the Bureau Perse advertised in the local paper the opening of their branches in Kerman, Sirjan, Bandar Abbas, Kafsinjan, and Yezd for forwarding goods from Bandar Abbas to the interior and vice versa. They also offered to ship goods to any part of the world from Bandar Abbas by Kussian steamers. M Bysiantsky, the Eussian Trade Representative in Kerman, was replaced bv M. Belooshapkin who had been in Kerman before. He is assisted by one Bussian assistant and a Persian interpreter. The Russians decreased their commitments to a great extent during the latter half of the year. In the Kerman province the Russians hold 18 per cent, of the trade in kerosene and 22 per cent, of that in petrol, the balance being done by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, Limited. 15 Military. Sartip Rahimi, the Officer Commanding Kerman Teep, was transferred to Shiraz while on short leave in Tehran in January. His brother, Yawar Rahimi, acted for him till relieved by Sarhang Abbas Khan, Nauzari, in the end of February. The Sarhang immediately on arrival asked the Military Inspector from Tehran, Sarhang Ghulam Hussein Khan, who had already arrived in Kerman for the purpose, to inspect the Qushuni accounts with the result that within a week's time Yawar Rahimi was put under arrest. As he was first reluctant to obey the order of his arrest, he was roughly handled by the new Officer Commanding, who continued in his endeavours to discover cases of corruption Q Rartin Rahimi (Ali Shah Khan). In June he confined to barracks Dr. Yawar Seyid Mohamed Khan, the Principal Medical Officer of the Brigade. The v 0 wnr who served in the South Persia Rifles, had made himself very popular. He was known to be a rich man and a close friend of Sartip Ali Shah Khan. It annears that Yawar was told that if he wished to escape a charge of lunacy, he must either pav up or give evidence against the Sartip. However, he found an alternative by slipping his guards and jumping down a well where he was drowned. In the morth of April the Military authorities in Kerman arrested the two notorious brothers, Darwish Khan and Mohamed Khan, sons of late Agha Haji Durasahi Mohamed Khan had for some time been put m charge of the Sirjan- Tonrr i 7 n (r1i section of the Kerman-Bandar Abbas motor road. Both brothers wptp rbarLd of helping Sheikh Abul Hassan Sarkuhi during the 1929 rebellion. Mohamed Khan had just married the daughter of Rafat-ud-Dauleh, Isfandian, the assistant Governor-General in Kerman, who too was dismissed shortly after- wards.32 In August tlie two brothers were sent to Tehran where they still are. Rafat- ud-Dauleh, who followed them to Tehran to work for their release, met with the same fate and was committed to a dungeon for an alleged charge of supplyino- them with ammunition. &amp; Owing to a recrudescence of disturbances 750 men from the Kerman garrison were moved to Lar early in July. Owing to various robberies on the Bandar Abbas-Kerman road mentioned elsewhere there were constant movements of troops from Kerman during the latter half of the year at the close of which there were in headquarters only enough men to guard the Military barracks, arsenal, etc The number of troops in Kerman command may be estimated at about 2,000. with detachments at Sirjan, Bandar Abbas, Jiruft and Rudbar. The Camel Corps at Bam was disbanded at the close of the year and a number, of men were either taken over as regular soldiers or enlisted in the Amnieh. Conscription. —In September a Conscription Committee was formed to start its third year s work, iheir activities were rather mild in comparison to the former two years. The conscription is still very unpopular, particularly in the distant districts. In July when I made a short tour to the Jabal Bariz, accom^ panied by Captain Tweed, we caused a stampede while approaching a tiny hamlet. We were mistaken for Census officials bent on the preliminary registration, the precursor of conscription. When confidence had been restored it was curious to note the dread which the possibility of conscription inspires. 16. PsTsidu Sarhang Mohamed Ivhan, the Military Grovernor of Persian Baluchistan, accompanied H. M. the Shah to Kerman and called at His Majesty's Consulate before returning to headquarters. He spoke of the desir ability of having a British representative at Khwash. It seems that Sarhant Mohamed Khan has done good work in Persian Baluchistan as the Baluchi raids across the Lut have practically ceased. 17. RudbciT. Zargham-us-Saltaneh has remained a semi-independent ruler of Eudbar throughout the year, though he is now paying up his revenues more iegularly. On the disbanciment of the Camel Corps in Bam at the close of the year, a detachment of the Military from Bam was posted in Rudbar and Jiruft. B kitish C onsulate, K erman ; E. NOEL, Major, I.A., 26th February 1931. His Majesty's Consul, Kerman,33 CHAPTER V. Administration report of the Mekran Coast for the year 1930. Personal. —Mr. G. E. 0. de Smidt held political charge of the Mekran Coast throughout the year. Gun-running. —No arms and ammunition were reported to have been landed at the ports of Persian Baluchistan during the year under review. Persian Baluchistan. —Mir Ali Mohamed father of Sirdar Dost Mohamed Khan of Bampur who had been imprisoned at Tehran, fearing reprisals by the Persians who were advancing on Sirbaz, crossed into British territory with 300 armed Baluchis on the 7th February at Mand where they were disarmed by the Mekran Levy Corps. The chief members including Dost Mohamed's wife were kept under surveillance in Panjgur and later were allowed to proceed to Karachi. In the early part of the year Mir Barkat Khan chief of Biyaban received orders from Tehran to hand over 600 rifles promised by him when Sirdar Dost Mohamed was captured. Mir Barkat prepared three dhows at Sirik to convey himself and his household to Kalbah on the Arab coast from where he intended to proceed overland and settle at Braymeh. But in the middle of February he arrived at Jask and a settlement was arranged at a meeting with the Officer Commanding Troops. In the middle of February Sarhang Mohamed Khan arrived from Duzdap at Mian Bazar 7 miles North of Naubandian and interviewed Sirdar Din Mohamed of Dashtyari who had been acting as Governor of Charbar. Thereafter with the active assistance of Din Mohamed the whole Dashtyari district was disarmed. Sirdar Din Mohamed not being satisfied with his subsequent treatment by Sarhang Mohamed Khan wired to the Shah for an interview in Tehran. Permission was granted and Din Mohamed was preparing for the journey when he was arrested by the Persians and sent to Tehran under escort, where he is still detained. Claims. —All British Indians who made claims against the Persian Subjects were told to take them to the Persian courts. Telegraph lines. —-The telegraph lines between Jask and Kir were interrupted during the year by wilful damage for 154 hours. Subsidies. —The following chiefs were in receipt 6f telegraph subsidies during the year. Annual telegraph subsidy. Name of chief. Habitat. Sons, Charbar Jask line. Saldjikaur (Suntsar) Charbar line.

Two slave-girls took refuge in the office of the British Agent, Gwadur. They were allowed to reside at Gwadur as free women. Wrecks. —In January a dhow while proceeding from Salaya (Kathiawar) to Basra in ballast was wrecked at Kuh-i-Mubarak west of Jask during a storm. The crew who were set upon and robbed by the Baluchis of their private belongings, reached Jask telegraph station in a distressed condition. They were repatriated to India. Some articles belonging to the dhow were removed by followers of the chief of the district and every effort made to recover the looted articles has proved futile. In the same month owing to very rough weather several native crafts were totally wrecked near Gwadur and some of the crews were reported to have lost their lives. Aviation. —The Imperial Airways service has operated throughout the year. The K. L. M. Dutch air mail stopped their fortnightly service between Amster dam and Batavia in January and recommenced in September 1930. All machines passing through stay at Jask the night. Australian Aviators Piper and Kay landed at Jask and started for Karachi on 19th February. When only a few miles out, they made a forced landing on the beach 8 miles from the station. The machine was repaired and left for Karachi on 21st February. Imperial Airways liner ' City of Basra ' from Karachi force landed at Charbar on 9th July. Although the Pilot produced a clear bill of health, the machine and passengers were placed in quarantine by the Persian Medical Officer. After three hours parleying she was allowed to proceed. One of the passengers on board was a King's messenger on his way back to London. Foreign Subjects. —Two German journalists Jacobstall and Evertz arrived at Jask from Bushire on 30th July. They left for Muscat by dhow on 4th August 1930. An Austrian named Arthur Ferdinand Klemen who was shown as a miner in his passport arrived at Jask on 19th June having come by foot from Bushire. He eventually reached India via Pusni. Navy. —H. M. S. ' Lupin ' and ' Cyclamen ' called at Gwadur during the year. Visits. —The Honourable Colonel H. V. Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf visited Gwadur in May. He gave interviews to the Sultan's Wali, and the leading Khojas and Hindus. Abolition of capitulations. —No change has occurred in the position of British Indian traders and subjects during the year. At Charbar where business is carried on chiefly by British Indian traders, no proper court has been instituted. It is impossible to get the Military governor to do anything unless a substantial sum is paid by either party. The traders are harassed in every way and are forced to hand over to Persian officials, goods on credit and when accounts are submitted, the latter refuse to pay. Great difficulty has also been experienced by merchants in remitt ing money to India owing to an order from the Persian Government prohibiting remittances. Tour. —The Director left Karachi for a tour of inspection on the 2nd March and after visiting all telegraph stations in the Persian Gulf returned to his headquarters on the 1st April. A memorandum on the condition of the districts between Jask and Gwadur is attached. J ash. Mr. W. C. Janes was in charge of the telegraph station until 30th July when he proceeded to England on leave. He was succeeded by Mr. C. F. Murray. Persian officials. —The Postmaster, Mirza Ahmed, was appointed Governor on 12th September. Although appearing very friendly towards all British subjects, yet he is known to have anti-British tendencies. He is not on good terms withS5 the Bais Nazmieh and they report each other to the Government at Tehran on every possible occasion. On 3rd January a Persian Military Inspector arrived from Bandar Abbas to hold an enquiry into complaints made by local Syeds against the Rais Qashoon, Aziz -Ullah, as a result of which a new Rais Qashoon by name Ammeen Zadeh, was sent to relieve him on 31st January. The latter was relieved by Mohamed Khan on 2nd July. Customs. —The Customs Mudir, Mirza Aziz, Was relieved on 30th April by Mirza Ali. From the 20th April; an increased tariff of 20% was imposed on customs duty, road and monopoly taxes. The Director of Customs, Bandar Abbas, passed through Jaskon 10th Decem ber. He has established customs posts between Charbar and Bandar Abbas on the coast at Kunarak, Goordeen, Tank, Galeg, Sadaich and Bunji. Persian garrison. —This consists at present of 21 Infantry under a Rais Qashoon. Of these 15 men are quartered in the Persian fort and six stationed at old Jask for vigilance. Taxes.- —As the result of representations made last year at Tehran against cus toms duty which was paid by the telegraph stall from 28th November 1929, the same was refunded on 29th March. Since then the staff has been exempt from this duty. Telegraph Concession. —In the early part of the year the Nazmieh prepared a football ground within the concession where games were played. Soon after the arrival of a new Nazmieh, one post of the fencing was removed so that the men might march into the concession in fours and parade there. This only ceased after several protests. In October the Persian School-master got three posts removed so that the school children could play on the flat ground. Complaints were made to the Nazmieh but proved of no avail. The matter was represented to the Governor who asked for two Copies of the Jask agreement which were supplied to him. He for warded them to Tehran for orders. In the meanwhile each time the posts were removed, they were replaced. Except for the above the staff at Jask have been on friendly terms with Persian officials. Charbar, Mr. A. W. Halkett, M.B.E., was Clerk-in-Charge of the station throughout the year* If ^Shahdad Abbas was Wali acting under the orders of Sirdar Din Mohamed Khan. On the arrest of the latter, he fled to Dashtyari and from there to Gwadur. Persian garrison.—The strength of the Persian garrison was 100 men under the command of a third Naib, Seyed Azizullah Khan. Yawar Ibrahim Khan was in command of the detachment up to May 1930 when he was transferred to Duzdap via Karachi. Sirdar Din Mohamed —N&amp;ih Ali Akbar Khan Ghaffary, Brigade Adjutant from Miriawa arrived at Charbar in June 1930 having travelled overland to Bandar Abbas and thence by steamer from the latter port to Charbar. Soon after his arrival, he requested Din Mohamed who happened to be at Mir Bazar in Dashtyari at that time, to come to Charbar and receive a Sword of Honour 'presented to him by the qxi Affpr some delay Din Mohamed arrived at Charbar and on 13th June at a dinner where all the Persian officials of Charbar and the chief followers of Din Mohamed were present, the sword was handed over to the latter. After Din bad thanked the Adjutant for the sword, that officer replied that he was or^eTby the Shah to arrest him and immediately took back the sword and lodged Din Mohamed in the fort occupied by the Persian troops. A detachment of troops was despatched to the fort of Din Mohamed to occupy it. The house of Wali Rhphrlfld Abbas in his absence was also forcibly entered and his son about 17 years old was arrested and lodged in the Persian fort. Some of his goods were seized bv the Persians The following day Charbar was placed under martial law and All Akbar Khan Ghaffary proclaimed himself as Military governor. The British Indian subjects were ordered to hand over any arms in their possession to him withm 24 hours Din Mohamed Khan and his fellow prisoners were taken by All Akbar Khan36 to Bushire en route to Tehran by the steamer which left Charbaron 12th August, Shahdad Abbas' son was later released after payment of a heavy fine. ^Din Mohamed's family hearing the news crossed the border and took refuge at Gwadur with the concurrence of the Muscat authorities. No resistance was made by the tribesmen of Din Mohamed on the arrest of the chief. Persian customs. —Mirza Ali Dashti was in charge of the Customs up to April 1930 when he was relieved by Mirza Gulbazi. The latter was in charge of the Customs when the year closed. During the year under report, the Persian Gov ernment have established customs posts at Ramdan and Bahu in an attempt to put down the smuggling which was rampant between Gwadur and Charbar. In November Mirza Ashraf, Provincial Director of Customs at Bandar Abbas came to Charbar on inspection and left by motor launch to establish customs posts at Tank, Galeg and Sadaich. Mir Subhan of Bahu and Mir Shahbeg of Bir who each received a subsidy from this department have taken up appointments with the Customs department on a salary which is stated to be krans 200 per mensem. Assault case. —A regrettable incident occurred in December when a British In dian subject was flogged by the orders of the Military Governor for refusing to hand over to one of his men a portion of a camel-load of wood he had bought and paid for. The matter was naturally regarded seriously by the British Indian community who invaded the telegraph compound in order to despatch telegrams to the British diplomatic authorities. The matter was reported to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf who was asked to insist on an example being made of the Persian official concerned in order to give British Indian subjects a feeling of security in future. The Military Governor posted troops in the bazar and these were not withdrawn for some time. Gwadur. Mr. Waris Ali acted as British Agent, Gwadur, until 9th June when he was relieved by Subedar Sultan Khan, a pensioner in retirement. The former left for Bushire on 23rd June on transfer. Wali. —Seyed Ali bin Hamud was Sultan's Wali at Gwadur up to June when he proceeded to Muscat on leave. He resumed his duties in August, In his absence Qazi Dad Mohamed performed his duties as Wali. Sultaris Customs. —Seyed Ahmed Efrendi was relieved by Salem bin Rashid Effendi in March when the former left for Muscat. After some months the latter fell sick and was relieved by Seyed Ahmed Effendi in October. The customs receipts are said to have amounted to one lakh of rupees at the close of the year. Desecration case. —On 3rd August a case occurred at Gwadur of desecration of a building in the Khoja burial-ground about a mile outside Gwadur. As there was considerable excitement among the Khojas through this act, every possible action was immediately taken in conjunction with the Political Agent, Muscat, who was at that time in Karachi, to ensure the protection of the British Indian Subjects and the detection of the offenders by the Muscat authorities. The headmen of various communities were made to give an undertaking not to break the peace. The Muscat State orderd the Wali to take necessary measures pending the arrival of a member of the Muscat Council of Ministers. Accordingly Sheikh Zubeir was deputed to Gwadur by the Sultan's Government. He stayed at Gwadur for a fortnight during, which enquiries were made by him. He left for Muscat on 1st September, The Political Agent, Muscat, also visited Gwadur on 27th October. He saw the representatives of the Khoja community, visited the Khoja Jamat Khana and graveyard and left for Muscat the same date. The reports received from the British Agent made it appear that nothing untoward had happened between the Baluchis and Khojas in this connection when the year closed, Rainfall. —In the early part of the year there was heavy rainfall at Gwadur which damaged many houses. Such heavy rain had not been experienced for the last twenty years. Locusts. —A flight of locusts appeared in January and caused some harm to the harvest. A large portion of them died through the rainfall.37 Trade. —The trade of this port Las been very dull during tlie year. Among tlie chief causes may be mentioned the establishment of customs posts by the Per sians along the Mekran border, payment of duties on Mekran imports at several places, and a great decrease in the fish caught. The latter is the chief business of a large number of traders. The market rate for dried fish at Colombo and Hong Kong where it is generally exported, was also low throughout the year and as a result a number of traders suffered heavy losses. S. de SMIDT, Director, Persian Gulf Tdegnvphs, In Political Charge of Mekran Coast. M emorandum on the condition of the districts between J ask and G wadur J ask D istrict. It is controlled jointly by Mir Mustafa Khan and Mir Hoti. These two chiefs have practically no pow T er and the district is run by Mir Mustafa Khan's sons, Murad Khan and Chiragh Khan. Through an accident six months ago Mir Mustafa Khan broke his left arm. He is almost an invalid and rarely leaves his residence. Murad is a hot-headed man. He has a fairly strong following and is ready to fight with the local Persians at any time. When the Governor of Jask recently ordered that all persons-entering Jask must wear Pehlevi hats, Murad Khan re taliated by stopping the entry of firewood into Jask, which hit the Persians very hard. The order regarding the wearing of Pehlevi hats was rescinded in a few days. Biyaban district, Mir Barkat governs this district. His attitude towards the British Govern ment is always very friendly. He is more powerful than Din Mohamed of Dash- tyari and no rupture has so far occurred between him and the Persians. But the 600 rifles he was called upon in 1929 to surrender have not been handed over, and most of his followers are armed. Gaih district. This district is ruled by Sirdar Husain Khan who has headmen at Kir, Sirgan and Parag, He is friendly towards the British Government and is on good terms with the Persians. He proceeded to Bampur a short time back to interview the General Officer Commanding the Persian troops. The condition of his district is good and he appears to be able to keep his tribesmen in order. Dashtyari district. This district was under the control of Sirdar Dm Mohamed Khan until he was arrested by the Persians. Mir Dilawar Khan, is now supposed to be m cnarge. He is assisted by Mir Dura Khan, his brother. Many of Sirdar Din Mohamed's tribesmen fled to British territory after the arrest of their chief. Bahu district. It was under the joint control of Mirs Ahmed Khan and Subhan who were acting under the orders of Sirdar Din Mohamed. There is nothing of interest to report in this district during the year. Mcmri) K arachi ; 20th March 1931. jss * CHAPTER VL A dministration R eport of the P olitical A gency, M uscat, for 1930. 1. Personnel—M^oT G. P. Murphy, I.A. r held charge of the Political Agency and Consulate from the 1st January to 14th June when he was relieved by Major T. C. Fowle, C.B.E., who continued to hold charge of the Agency and Consulate till the end of the year. 2. The post of Agency Surgeon was held throughout the year by Captain D L Mackay, I.M.D., and that of Sub-Assistant Surgeon by Mr. G. B. Yemkanmardi. 3. The post of Treasury Officer was held by the following officers during the year :— Mr. M. A. Fernandez, M.B.E., from 1st January to 30th June. Mr. L. C. deSouza, from 1st July to 4th November- Mr. T. M. Nicholas, from 5th to 16th November. Mr. M. J. Gazdar, M.B.E., from 17th November till the end of the year. 4. Agency Hospital, —The Hospital grows in popularity despite the fact that there are two hospitals maintained by the American Missionaries. In addition to the local inhabitants of Muscat and Matrah the hospital is much used by Arabs from the interior. . During the year 8,311 outdoor and 125 indoor patients were treated, showing an increase of 897 outdoor and 41 indoor patients over 1929, and 21 major and 683 minor operations were performed. 5. Public Health and Sanitation. —There were no epidemic during the year. unfi Local sanitation is bad. Tanks for the storage of drinking water drawn from sk wells afford ample breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Moscjuito larvge are conveyed lar^ into the town and continue their cycle of breeding in open earthenware pots where water is stored for domestic use. It is hoped that in the course of time by educating Ali- the public in anti-mosquito measures, and in sanitation, the Council of Ministers latt will be able to improve the general health of the town. the 6. Foreign Consulates.—-The French Consulate remained closed during the year eleI but a watchman remains in charge. of a 7. The Political Agent remained in charge of American interests. 8. Biding Family. His Highness the Sultan accompanied by Mr. B. S. pos Thomas left for Dhofar on 2nd January in the State gunboat ' A1 Saidi ' and int: returned to Muscat on 4th March also on board ' A1 Saidi 5 '. m 9. His Highness left for Dehra Dun on 21st March and remained absent till ^ the end of the year. Ali 10. His Highness informed the Hon'ble the Political Resident that he did not f S1 intend to return to Muscat. The matter has been referred to the Government of India and remained under consideration at the end of the year. ^ 11. Saiyid Nadir bin Faisal (His Highness' brother) took no active part in the State affairs throughout the year, but as noted in the last year's report has been present on official occasions. 12. Council of Ministers.—The composition of the Council throughout the year was as follows :— President. Said Saiyid, the eldest son of His Highness the Sultan, occupied the post of President throughout the year. ' i a J %( The other members were :— ^ 13. Finance Minister. —Mr. B. S. Thomas, O.B.E., from 1st January to 27th ^Pl December. Mr. Thomas left Muscat for Dhofar on 5th October ^ 0 ] on 6 weeks leave. The ' A1 Said ' left Muscat for Dhofar on the | ^ 30th November to take the Wali of Dhofar back to his post, and to av i bring Mr. Thomas back to his. The A1 Said ' returned to Muscat ^ on the 18th December without Mr. Thomas, but with an application from him to the Council asking for one month's further leave without | ^ pay. As there is no regular communication with Dhofar which is , N Wc39 feome 600 miles from Muscat no reply could be sent, as Mr. Thomas had left Dhofar for an unknown destination. It was subsequently as certained that he had started off to cross the Ruba-el-Khali. Said Saiyid performed Mr. Thomas' duties until the 27th December when Mr. S. E. Hedgcock, the new Financial Adviser, arrived. 14. Minister of Justice. —This post was held throughout the year by Shaikh Zubair. 15. Finance.—- T \ iq financial situation of the State at the close of the year, as appraised by Mr. Hedgcock, was serious, as can be seen from the following figures :•— Rs. Rs. Due to local merchants and others .. .. .. .. 1,16,577 Due to officials and others as pay for December .. 48,470 Cash in hand .. .. .. .. .. 29,168 Net deficit .. .. .. .. .. .. 19,302 Total outstanding on 31st December 1930 1,35,879 Various measures to deal with the financial situation crisis are under consideration. Districts. 16. Sur. —Affairs at Sur gave cause for some anxiety throughout the year until the winter. Sur is one of the most prosperous ports in' Oman and the State should derive a large revenue from it in the shape of customs dues. (By far the largest source of State revenue is derived from such dues.) The local tribes, how ever, chief of whom are the Jenebeh, actually occupying the port, and the Bani Bu Ali—further inland—are of a somewhat truculent disposition, particularly the latter, and for some time past had claimed to be independent of Muscat, and hoisted their own flag, in a small quarter of the town—Aiqa—which certain of their elements occupy. Dissension amongst the Jenebeh which reduced Sur to a state of anarchy, enabled the Bani Bu Ali to take sides with certain sections of the Jenebeh against others, and to interfere with the internal administration of the town. A general policy was adopted, in conjunction with the Council of Ministers, of com posing the differences of the Jenebeh, so that they might form a block against the intrigues of the Bani Bu Ali, and of inducing the latter at any rate to lower their flag in Aiqa as a mark of obedience to the State. The Hon'ble the Political Resident visited the town in August and interviewed the Jenebeh Shaikhs as well as Ali bin Abdullah, the chief Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali. As a, result of his visit the Jenebeh promised to settle their differences and the Bani Bu Ali hauled down their flag and flew that of the State. In September Said Saiyid also paid a successful visit to the town during which he composed-—at least temporarily—- the differences of the Jenebeh, and in November the Political Agent likewise visited Sur. As a result of these personal visits peace was established in this town, which at the beginning of the year was the scene of constant disturbances. Further measures are under consideration with a view to consolidating the authority of the State at Sur, and increasing the revenues derived from this port. 17. The Batineh. —The Batineh coast remained quiet during the year. 18. Ruus-al-Jabal.—In March surveying p»arties from H. M. S. ' Ormonde were prevented from landing at Khasab by the Shaikh of that place. Shaikh Hassan who further refused to obey the orders of the Muscat State on the subject, cut off supplies from the Wali of Khasab—the representative of the State—and generally adopted an openly rebellious attitude. Both in view of the local situation at Khasab itself, and also on account of the general effect which the Shaikh's attitude was having on the rest of ' Oman, the State sought the support of the British Govern ment in suppressing the revolt and authority was granted to the Senior Naval Officer to issue an ultimatum to the Shaikh calling on him to surrender, and if he refused to take the necessary measures to enforce its terms. As the Shaikh refused to surrender H. M. S. ''Lupin ' and ' Cyclamen ' in company with the State gunboat ' A1 Said', commenced operations on the 20th April. Khasab was bom barded, and later the Muscat state declared the port closed to dhow traffic. I ■IHHl40 On the 5tli May the Shaikh surrendered and was made a State prisoner at Mus cat. A new Shaikh was appointed and since then all has been quiet at Khasab. The success of the operations had an excellent effect through the rest of the State. The more satisfactory situation at Sur towards the end of the year can certainly be attributed in part to the action taken at Khasab. 19. Gwadur. —Affairs remained normal throughout the year except for the defilement of a Khoja graveyard outside the town during the night of 4th August &gt; which naturally caused not a little resentment amongst the local Khoja community r who are on bad terms with the local Baluchis. Representations were at once made to the Muscat State who instituted vigorous enquiries, sending over a member of the Council of Ministers to assist the Wali in his investigations. The graveyard is situated some miles outside the town in an isolated spot, the outrage might have been committed by any mischief maker, and as was only to be expected the perpe trator was not discovered. In spite of this the Counc l of Ministers took drastic action imposing a collective fine on the Baluch community and expelling one Isa Dilmurad, a local bad character who had been implicated in a disuurbance in March 1929 (for which he had served a term of imprisonment), and who the Khojas feared would stir up further trouble against them. No further incidents occurred. In October the Political Agent on his return from recess in Karachi took the opportu nity to visit Gwadur where he found everything quiet. Excluding past grievances all that the Khojas now complained of in their treatment by the Baluchis was that the latter were sometimes uncivil to them. 20. Imam's territory.* —The treaty made in 1920, with the assistance of the Political Agent of that time, between the Imam and his adviser Shaikh Isa bin Saleh on the one hand and the Muscat Government on the other, still works well and friendly relations have continued between the two parties throughout the year. 21. J^lissionary JVorJc . —The following members of the Dutch Reformed Chiirch of the United States of America carried on their customary activities throughout the year: the Rev. VanPeursem and family. Dr. (Miss) Hosman andDr. Harrison and family ; the last named was succeeded by Dr. Storm and family. 22. The Mission has acquired from the Muscat State on 99 years lease a large plot of ground in Matrah on which to build a hospital. There is already a woman's hospital in Muscat under the charge of Dr. Hosman. 23. A Mohammedan family consisting of husband and wife who were alleged to have been converted to Christianity was the subject of controversy between the Missionaries and the Muscat State during the month of December. When the man died the question of his burial arose but ultimately Moslem rites were performed. Then arose the question of the adu (prescribed mourning) by the widow, the mis sionaries contending that its performance would imply renunciation oi Christianity. This thorny question was finally solved by the woman returning her personal pro perty to her late husband's brother, and going into ' purdah ' for the prescnoed period in the house of Miss Hosman. This affair was a source of some anxiety to the Political Agent who as already ^oted—-is also in charge of American interests, and who had to act as the friend and adviser of both sides who both applied to him for support. It was mamly due to the sensible attitude adopted by Said Saiyid, the Presiuent ot the Council of Ministers, that the matter was amicably settled. 24. Visits of Government Officials.^t January—12th February, SthMarch-- 1st April, Captain R. L. O'Connor, Officer on Special Duty from Army Head quarter, India, who visited both Sur and Sohar. 25. 21st—26th March, Major H. J. M.

Aviation. —Flying Boats visited Muscat on the following dates ;—- 1st—2nd January. 31st March—1st April. 11th—12th April. 7th—9th, 12th—15th September. 17th—20th October. 12th—16th November. Lt. A. J. H. Dove, R.E., arrived from Baghdad on 22nd February, construct ed an engine room in the Royal Air Force rest-house, a petrol shed at the Coal Depot and cleared the ground for a landing ground at Bait-u-Falaj. Flight Lieutenant A. R. M. Rickards arrived and prepared a landing ground at Ras-al-Hadd in May. 32. Climate.- —The total rainfall registered for the year amounted to about 12 inches and the Summer was less trying than usual. 33. Communications. —Communication by car has been opened up with the Batinah Coast through the construction of a motor road between Muscat and Matrah, and its extension some 15 miles beyond Matrah, by the Muscat Levy Corps under their commandant Captain A. R. Walker. Cars can now run some 200 miles up the Batinah Coast to Kalba, and a motor bus runs daily to Sib some 30 miles from Muscat. 34. A rough fair weather motor track has been constructed by Khan Bahadur Nassib to Sawakim about 50 miles from Muscat. It may be possible to continue this track to Sur. 35. Muscat Infantry. —Captain A. R. Walker, I. A., was Commandant through out the year. The Agency guard was furnished from this Corps. The Corps con tinued its very useful work in road making (see paragraph 33 above). 36. Slave Traffic. —Twenty slaves took refuge at the Agency during the year all of whom were manumitted after enquiry. 37. It should be noted that there is no question of the slaves—while with their masters—being kept in durance, shackled with chains, etc. On the contrary they are generally used for work far removed from the houses of their masters in date gardens, pearling and so forth. This means that the great majority of the slaves have ample opportunity for leaving their masters should they wish to, and for seeking manumission at this Agency, and the fact that such manumission can be obtained is now widely known throughout the State. T. C. FOWLE, Major, Political Agent and H. B. M.'s Consul, Muscat. MC171FD42 GHAPTEK VII. A dministration E eport for the T eucial C oast of O man for the year 1930. General—The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel EL V, Biscoe, Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, visited tlie Trucial Coast four times during the period under review, namely, in February, May, June'and November, On the first occasion he spent about a week on the coast, and was accompanied by Air Vice Marshal Sir Robert and Lady Brooke-Pophaim The visits in May and November were also of about a week's duration, all the Shaikhdoms being visited. The visit in June was to Ras-aLKhaimah and was paid in connection with the negotia tions for the establishment of a fuel depot there for the Royal Air Force, On this occasion the Political Resident spent 13 days there. Personnel, —Khan Bahadur Isa bin Abdul Latif held the post of Residency Agent,. Shargah, throughout the year. Pearling. —In consequence of losses sustained last year fewer dhows were equipped for pearling than usual, ' 4 This year too has been an unfortunate one for pearlers ; the catch was meagre and prices 50% below last year's. As a result there is much distress and in many cases Nakhudas have found themselves unable even to pay for food supplied to their divers. Relations withlhn Saud. —No interference in the affairs of the Trucial coast by King Ibn Saud's agents in Braimi is reported. Ahu Dhabi. In September 1930 one Rashid^son of Habrash y a personal guard of Shaikh Shakhbut bin Salim, was suspected of conspiring with the sons of the ex- Shaikh Saqar bin Zaid to kill him, Rashid, however, obtained the intervention of the Shaikh's uncle with whom he had taken refuge and left Abu Dhabi. He then joined a gang of the Awamir al Bu Shamis and Khawatir bedouin, stole 60 camels belonging to Shaikh Shakhbut and sold them inShargah and Ajman. The latter sent his brother Hazza ? at the head of about 500 men to punish the robbers and to recover his property. The ruler of Umm-al-Qaiwain supplied Razza's men with food and the Bani Katab and others joined in offering him assistance while the ruler of Ras-al-Khaimah assisted Rashid secretly. The ruler of Dubai wasonthe point of attacking the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah but he gave up the idea on receiving a message from the Political Resident through 11. M. S. ' Folkestone ' that it was inadvisable for him to do this. The, robbers were ultimately defeated and peace established in October. Ajman. —Ruler : Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid. A Persian boy Ahmad bin Hasan who remained in slavery up to the end of last year was released in June and handed over to his relatives. The state remained quiet throughout the year. Debai. —Ruler : Shaikh Said bin Maktum-al-Hashar. In April the Ruler of Debai notified Persian residents in his territory that they were not to wear the Pahlavi cap. He subsequently explained, that his order only applied to Persians permanently domiciled in Debai, whom he regarded as his own subjects. In May news was received at Debai that some Hindu creditors who had already been paid Rs. 80,000 by one Abdullah son of Yusuf bin Abdullah, a respectable pearl merchant of Debai, against his father's debt to them had secured his deten tion by a decree from the High Court of Bombay. This incident caused some excitement in Debai and the Ruler threatened to arrest all the Hindus in his terri tory in retaliation. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf asked H, M, S, Lupin ' to watch developments and advised the Ruler to take no action against British subjects. Ultimately Abdullah was released and it is hoped that the case will be amicably settled without further reference to the Indian courts. On the 1st of August 1930 some Awamir Bedouins carried off 30 camels from the.- vicinity of Debai, but most of them were ultimately recovered..43 Sliaikli Said bin Maktum has been very friendly during the past year, and his co-operation and assistance can always be counted upon. He is much the most intelligent of the Trucial Shaikhs. Hamfiyah. —Headman : Shaikh Abdur Rahman bin Saif. This chief continues friendly. He was one of those who endeavoured to mediate when difficulties arose with the Shaikh of Kas-al-Khaimah. Ras-al-Khaimah. —Buler : Shaikh Sultan bin Salim. During his visit to the Trucial coast on the 1st May 1930, the Hon'ble the Political Resident informed the ruler of Ras-al-Khaimah that the British Govern ment intended replacing a dhow containing fuel for the Royal Air Force which had been moored in the creek for more than a year past by an iron dhow. The Shaikh did not at the time raise any serious objection. On the 21st May therefore H. M. S. ' Cyclamen ' towed the barge to the creek. The Shaikh however refused to allow it to be brought up the creek and collected some bedouins from the interior with a view to offering a forcible resistance. Some of the other Trucial Shaikhs came to Ras-al-Khaimah to endeavour to effect a settlement but without result, and finally the Shaikh informed the Residency Agent that he would not accept any- further responsibility for his life. The latter therefore took refuge on board one of His Majesty's ships. The Hon'ble the Political Resident arrived at Ras-al-Khaimah on the 1st June by flying boat and transferred to H. M. S. ' Triad '. Shaikh Salim refused to call on board the ship and the efforts of other Shaikhs to make him do so were unsucces- ful. Pressure was ultimately brought to bear upon the Shaikh by detaining 8 pearling dhows belonging to his town and by cutting off food supplies to Ras-al- Khaimah by sea. The pressure was increased by a spontaneous threat by the Shaikh of Dibha to attack Ras-al-Khaimah if he would not come to terms with the British Government. Finally after protracted discussions extending over nearly a fortnight, during which period the Shaikh refused to visit the Political Resident and negotiations were carried on chiefly through his cousin the Shaikh of Shargah, an agreement was signed by the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah under which— (i) he agreed to the petrol barge being located in his creek for a period of one year during which subsequent arrangements for the storage of petrol would be discussed ; (ii) The Royal Air Force were to be entitled to refill the barge whenever necessary ; (in) the Shaikh accepted full responsibility for the safety of the Residency A^ent. The Shaikh's brother also agreed to compensate the Residency Agent for any damage that might have been done to his date gardens. In November, owing to the Shaikh having again refused to call on the Political Resident, the iron barge was moved about a mile further up the creek of Ras-al- Khaimah and moored opposite the Residency Agent's house. In November a Haiderabadi's shop was broken into and money and articles removed. The Shaikh has so far failed to trace and punish the culprit. Shargah. —Ruler : Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar. An oppressive and unpopular ruler, whose conduct of late both towards the British authorities and his own people has been very unsatisfactory. He certainly encouraged the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah in his opposition to the barge while the following incidents are typical of his conduct towards his subjects. He became enamoured of the wife of one of his subjects and more or less compelled her husband to divorce her and then married her himself. An Arab pearl dealer of Shargah having failed to pay his liabilities was imprisoned by the Shaikh : when his subjects protested against this treatment he took Rs. 6,000 from the man and released him. In September a dispute arose between Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar and his brother who was living in straitened circumstances. To avoid bloodshed the Shaikh sanctioned payment of Rs. 700 per annum to each of his brothers, Rashid and Hamad, sons of Saqar.44 Small raids by bedouins are reported from Sbargak Umm-al-Qaiwain. —Ruler : Shaikh Ahmed bin Rashid. The ruler suspecting his cousin' Abdullah bin Nasir of treasonable designs banished him from Umm-al-Qaiwain. He demolished his house which overlooked the sea fearing that it might fall into the hands of his enemies and prove impregn able to him afterwards. Shaikh Ahmed bin Rashid has pursued a friendly policy and was one of those who endeavoured to mediate at Ras-al-Khaimah. His territory was raided by bedouins and in July some 30 camels were carried off from the suburbs of Umm-al-Qaiwain. General remark.—The Shaikhs of the Trucial coast have throughout the year maintained their opposition towards providing any facilities for the Royal Air Force. Their attitude is based on a rooted fear that these facilities will involve a greater measure of British interference in their affairs. The Persian Government and Trucial 'Oman. —Arabs of the Trucial coast travelling to Persia are still treated by the Persian authorities in Persian Ports^ as Persian subjects and are being charged the full cost of passports when they land. On leaving again they are given 44 billets de passage45 X CHAPTER VIII. Administration Report of the Bahrain Agency for the year 1930. Personnel. Captain C. G. Prior held charge of the Agency throughout the year. Khan Bahadur Saiyid Siddiq Hasan proceeded on leave to India on the 1st April 1930 and returned on the 3rd November 1930. Mr. M. J. Gazdar, officiated during his absence. Ruler of Bahrain and the Al Khalifa Family. —Shaikh Sir bin Isa has been moie friendly in his attitude whether through good will or senile decay it is hard to say. He is slightly deafer than before but otherwise time leaves no mark on him. Shaikh Hamad has been on excellent terms with the Agency throughout the year. He has showed signs of being more able to stand on his own feet, and needless to say has received every encouragement to do so. His health suffered a relapse partly owing to the absence of Dr. Holmes, Dr. Todd being less successful in persuading him to take his medicines, Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa has rendered useful services to the Government as Minister of Education and the brunt of the agitation in the schools fell on his shoul ders. He showed however, an inclination to take hunting trips to the mainland leaving the Adviser to grapple with the more arduous problems. He was nearly drowned on returning from one, his launch being caught in a storm- Shaikh Muhammad bin Isa took the customary summer holiday to the Lebanon. He feels unable to take this holiday without explaining his decaying health for weeks beforehand, now saying that one side of his face has become larger than the other, now saying that if his skin is indented by pressure it retains the mark, both of which he considers very serious symptoms. If he were not President of the Manama Municipality his futility would be of no interest, but his incapacity is a serious drag on the usefulness of the premier public body. Shaikh Salman bin Hamad continues to do useful work as Joint Judge in the Bahrain Court. Allegations are occasionally heard against him but the Adviser has a high opinion of his integrity. Some of the merchants are beginning to allude to him openly as the ' Heir Apparent ' though he has not, of course, been recognised as such by His Majesty's Government. Shaikh Rashid bin Muhammad has done well as President of the Majlis al Urfi. ' ' Shaikh Mubarak bin Hamad has been made Joint Magistrate on the Lower Bahrain Court and shows promise, and if he can overcome his laziness will do well. Shaikh Abdulla bin Hamad was taken by the Political Agent to India to have his eyes attended to. It was discovered by his Indian tutor that he was on the point of going blind through want of attention, and the provision of proper glasses has made a marked difference to him. Shaikh Plamad's callous indifference to his son's obvious disability was a regrettable feature and some pressure was required before the boy was allowed to leave Bahrain. The Political Agent arranged for him to make a short tour in Rajputana, and he was much impressed by what he saw. He was surprised that Government did not hang Mr. Gandhi, and on being pressed to buy khaddar said ' Why should I buy inferior cloth ? My father is a Shaikh I ' Bahrain State. —Mr. de Grenier, Director of Customs, proceeded on leave on 1st April and returned on 1st October. A serious quarrel arose between Mr. de Grenier and the Amir of Manama for which the latter was mainly responsible and peace was restored with some diffi.- culty. Captain Parke took leave on urgent private affairs to settle his father's estate, starting on 9th December and returned on the 3rd March 1031. Mr. Belgrave performed the duties of Director of Customs in addition to his own duties. Bahrain Police Force. —The Indians had dwindled to 70 and the local police increased to 39 at the close of the year. There is also a force of naturs or night watchmen, numbering 65 and 40 respectively and there are also a few at R.fa'a. MC171FD46 There is a defence scheme in existence against an outside raid, and the arrange-' ments apparently consist of withdrawing all Police to the Fort, leaving the Foreign community to have their throats cut by the invaders. Sunni-Shiah relations improved, and owing to the cessation of complaints from the Bahama at Muhammera the relations between the Persian Shiahs and Bahama more or less became normal. Shaikh Abdulla and Shaikh Ali bin Hasan continued to be the Shiah Qadhis and \^he three Abdul Latifs the Sunni Qadhis. A young Alim, Muhammad al Madani, a former clerk of the late Shiah Qadhi Muhammad al Madani aspires to the position of Qadhi and has unfortunately been allowed to practise rights which are the exclusive privilege of the appointed Qadhis. There was some agitation for the return of Shaikh Khalaf but it was ignored and subsided. The sentences on the three Al Khalifa mentioned in last year's report have un doubtedly had a good effect and have done much to strengthen the hands of the Bahrain Government and the Bahrain Court. It may be taken that the power of the Al Khalifa to commit serious crime with impunity has been, let us hope, broken for ever. Oil Concession. —Major Holmes arrived on the 15th April and was followed by two American geologists, Messrs. Taylor and Davies, a month later. They left again on the 21st of July, and without making any definite statement, for obvious reasons, but are understood to have been optimisfic in the possibilities of finding oil at Bahrain. The Political Agent detected a clause in the Oil Concession that gave the Com pany power to indemnify themselves for any losses of whatever nature by deducting them from payments due to the Bahrain Government. The injustice of this clause was pointed out and the Political Agent requested that the Shaikh should be ad vised not to agree to the Assent transferring the Eastern and General's concession to the American interests until this clause had been modified. He was supported by the Residency and the Colonial Office obtained a letter modifying the clause from the American combine. Artesian Wells. —A check has been put on the indiscriminate sinking of arte sian wells but far too much water is still being wasted. Shaikh Hamad has sunk a very successful well near the sea-coast at Qarzekhan on the western shore of the island, but it will be a long time before all the water can be utilized. The Government sank a well on the open ground near 'Ali but the water was sulphurous and two other attempts failed. It is unfortunate that the only un claimed land near Manama is unsuitable for artesian wells. Agriculture. —On the recommendation of the Political Agent an agriculturist was engaged from 'Iraq. He appears exactly the type of man wanted, and all the big date garden owners consult him freely. He gives lectures at the schools and takes the boys out for practical training. In the days of Ibn Batuta Bahrain was famous for its cotton, and there is no reason why it should not be grown again. The Bahrain dates are apparently of good quality but badly tended. At present the Island is entirely dependent on the pearl trade for a living, and if agriculture was properly developed it would prove a valuable second string, but until some opportunity is given to the shamefully rackrented peasantry to enjoy the fruits of improvements made in their holdings, progress will be difficult. Customs Revenues. —The total Customs' collections for the year amounted to Rs. 7,90,107. Municipalities. —Revenue has fallen off, apart from halving the subsidy paid by the Government to the Manama Municipality, and all suggestions for raising the house rates (which were recently reduced by half) were met with no enthusiasm. The councillors are almost all owners of house property and are averse to any form of taxation on buildings, or indeed any tax that affects them personally. Much street widening has been done in both Manama and Muharraq, and some town planning has been done to the south of the former.Despite the strict proMbitioii on all forms of intoxicants, liquor is constantly finding its way into the towns, and is usually distilled from dates. The Police made several important captures, but so long as the demand exists there will be a supply. The offenders are mostly all Iraqis. Public Works. —No large works were undertaken owing to the necessity for economy, but some work was done on the Manama-Muharraq causeway, mainly as a form of outdoor relief. The road was originally planned to be forty feet wide, but !as the Political Agent pointed out that it would be completed in half the time and cost nearly half as much if it was made twenty feet wide, without materially detracting from its usefulness, the width has now been reduced to that figure. Education. —The new Inspector of Education has been a great success, but undoubtedly showed too great a tendency to model the schools on the Beirut system, and introduced English into all except the very lowest forms. The Political Agent drew attention to this and suggested that the schools should model themselves on Baghdad and Basra, and not on Beirut, and, since the indigenous boy is not very intelligent, urge that time should not be taken up with English until he had ob tained a good grasp of his own language. Effect had been given to his suggestions, but unfoitunately in early February the abuses that had been discovered by the Inspector determined the two head masters of the Manama and Muharraq Sunni schools to provoke a crisis and get rid of him at all costs. Without warning, they suddenly dismissed the boys after making most objectionable and subversive speeches, and closed the schools. Next day when summoned by Shaikh Abdulla, the Minister of Education, they did not appear but sent a list of demands, which included requests that the Inspector should have no authority to inspect schools, and that no changes should be made in the staff's pay, and that appointments should be permanent. They were informed that no discussion could take place until they returned to work, but they replied that until each demand had been granted they would remain on strike 4 The other masters and the boys paraded the town, causing considerable excite ment, but after the dismissal of the headmasters peace was restored. On the re turn of the headmasters to Syria they immediately launched a venomous campaign against the Agency in the pressj no doubt considering it better copy than abusing Shaikh Abdulla who actually ordered their dismissal. The masters had been emboldened in their attitude by the open Support of Yusuf Fakhru and Khan Bahadur Abdul Aziz Qusaibi, and part of the propaganda employed was to say that religious instruction was being displaced in favour of English. Actually the number of forms in which English was taught had just been reduced and the religious teachers themselves admitted that no alteration had been made in their curriculum. Neither the Hadd or Rifa'a schools took part in these disturbances, and all the Shiah's held aloof. The Government girls schools are doing well, and altogether some five to six hundred boys and girls are receiving free State instruction. All the boys at Beirut University were withdrawn at the end of the school year. It will be recalled that they were sent there without any selection on either mental or moral grounds, nor had any undertaking been taken that they would work for the Government on their return. They appear to have profited nothing by their stay at Beirut, in fact a less suitable place could scarcely have been chosen for boys from a primitive place like Bahrain, and on their return they refused point blank to work for the Government with one or two exceptions, who mentioned some ex orbitant figure as the least remuneration they could accept. They have learnt very little and show no sign of gratitude for the large sums spent on them and all the State has to show for an expenditure of over half a lakh is a few young men with wind in the head. The American mission maintained two schools. The boys school had a maxp mum enrolment of 76, and also held night classes, and the girls school a maximum enrolment of 107, though about half this number would be the average attendance. The new Government girls' school has not affected the attendance at the Mission's girls' school, in spite of the fact that they have contributed most of its pupils and48 a teacher. The American Mission deserve every credit for the pioneer work they have done for female education in Bahrain, The Revd. Mr. Hakken's ardent evangelism caused some excitement and the Political Agent advised him to abate his zeal if he wished to remain in Bahrain. Trade, The year proved disastrous for the Pearling industry and conse quently for Bahrain, pearls reaching some 30% of their 1929 value, The catch was above the average but there was next to no buying. Practically the whole of the season's catch remained unsold except for the cheaper qualities which were bought fairly freely, and the year's sales amounted to only some 28 or 30 lakhs. Next year's prospects are even gloomier, The reforms in the diving industry continue to exercise a most beneficial influence and there is little doubt that a far greater proportion of the divers now understand the advantage of keeping out of debt. Even Qatar has been obliged to follow suit and institute divers books, and since the obscure ramifications of diving finance oblige many divers and boat owners at Qatif and Damman to take all their advances from Bahrain, they have to bind themselves to Bahrain terms and rules. The total value of the trade of the year amounted to Rs. 2,53,00,480 as com pared with Rs. 4,04,45,915 in the preceding year. The total value of imports amounted to Rs. 1,60,37,490 as against Rs, 2,67,51,467 in the preceding year. The exports amounted to Rs, 9,26,29,990 as against Rs. 1,36,94,448 for the preced ing year. The figures for exports are not accurate since few of the pearls exported are declared at their proper value if declared at all. Boat Building. Eighteen new motor launches were built in Bahrain of which six were exported, and six old craft were fitted with engines. Fifty-five new sail ing boats were built in Bahrain of which four were exported. The engines used are almost invariably Kelvins. One hundred and twenty-three British ships and eleven German ships en tered the port as compared with one hundred and thirty and ten last year. The Strick vessels are bringing more cargo than before, and Bahrain now fills the place of Bandar Abbas as a transhipment port for the Gulf, Electric Light. —The Electric power station was opened by Shaikh Hamad on the 12th May. Bankruptcies. —Two very large bankruptcies took place in the year, that of the A1 Baqar Brothers and Khan Bahadur Muhammad Sharif who absconded to Persia leaving debts of over three lakhs, two lakhs being due to the Hansa line whose agent he was, and whom he had swindled by allowing himself and his son to take delivery of goods without retiring the bills of lading. A suggestion was made for the establishment of a Chamber of Commerce but the idea fell through owing to lack of support from the Shaikhs, Royal Navy. —Several visits were paid by His Majesty's Ships, and on the 27th November, Rear Admiral E. J. A. Fullerton, Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station arrived for a two days visit. Shaikh Hamad invited him to go hawking and both weather and sport combine to make his visit a success. Admiral Deville paid a visit in the Diana arriving on the 30th December and leaving on the 2nd January. Royal Air Force. —The Royal Air Force entered their new Rest House in June, and the negotiations regarding the aerodrome have been concluded. The Political Agent made a number of flights with the R. A. F. during the year, including crash amongst his experiences. Work on the petrol tank at Yas was begun towards the end of November, but owing to various circumstances the project was not completed before the year closed. The Hedjaz Air Force. —This ill-assorted body arrived at the close of the pre ceding year, and by March began to be a thorn in the side of the Political Agent, A disgraceful orgy resulted in the dismissal of one pilot after prolonged unpleasant ness, and the timely removal of the force to Jedda in August alone prevented an other pilot and two of the mechanics sharing the fate of the first pilot. By their49 actions, this Force did an immense amount of liarm to onr prestige, and their de parture was hailed with profound relief by the whole of the British community. Post Office. —This Post Office does not deliver letters at the residence of ad dressees. During the year 4,499 registered letters were received and 4,097 des patched a slight reduction on last year's numbers. 4,991 parcels were received and 489 despatched and Rs. 9,055 worth of stamps sold. Cash certificates worth Rs. 775 were sold and none discharged. British Postal Orders of the value of Rs. 705 were sold and Rs. 3-5-0 paid. Savings Bank deposits amounted to Rs.34,936 an advance on last year, and Money Orders for Rs. 1,69,250 were issued and Rs. 4,379 paid. Judicial.—The number of Civil suits filed in the Agency were 1,957, an increase of 25% on last year, and criminal cases 350, an increase of over 15%. The total number of petitions registered were 2,584 as compared with 1,949 during the past year. The year was a record one both from the point of view of cases heard and fees collected, and the latter more than pay for the whole of staff except the Political Agent. An extra clerk has been applied for to cope with the extra work, and with out his assistance it will be impossible to carry on. Medical. —Assistant Surgeon R. Holmes proceeded on leave and was replaced by Dr. N. C. Todd. Mrs. Todd died on the 11th September from heart failure. The total number of cases were :— 1930. 1929. Outdoor patients .. .. .. .. .. 9,153 7,289 Indoor patients .. .. .. .. .. 257 276 Major and Minor operations .. .. .. 435 787 An influenza epidemic raged in the first part of the year, and further deaths occurred at Galali from malaria. Some progress was made with vaccination and the population seem to becom ing aware of its advantages. Dr. and Mrs. Holmes returned on the 14th December. Dr. Holmes is very popular and it is entirely due to his influence that Bahama women are beginning to make use of the hospital. They are Shiahs and will not go to the Mission hospital if they can possibly avoid it. The American Mission maintains two hospitals, one for men and one for women. In spite of the frequent absences of Dr. Dame the former had 31,884 cases, including 481 in-patients and 366 and 439 major and minor operations respectively. The women's hospital had 8,308 cases 255 in-patients and 125 major and minor operations. The departure of Dr. Rothchaefer had a bad effect on this hospital as the new Lady Doctor does not inspire the same confidence. Visits of Government Officials. —The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel H. V. Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, accompanied by Major T. C. W. Fowle and Air Vice-Marshal Sir Robert and Lady Brooke Popham arrived at Bahrain on the 4th February, leaving by the Patrick Stewart the same day. Colonel Biscoe also visited Bahrain on the 31st June and 17th July, in the first case by Southampton and in the second by the Cyclamen. The Cyclamen received a severe buffeting on her way from Ras-al-Khaimeh to Bahrain. He paid a final visit to Bahrain from the 8th to 11th November accompanied by Mr. Blanch in the Patrick Stewart and the Senior Naval Officer in the Patrick Stewart. Captain R. L. O'Connor, officer on special duty, paid two visits to Bahrain staying about five weeks with the Political Agent. Captain Prior paid two visits to Qatar in the year and also visited the main land. Two Persian Shaikhs, Shaikh Muhammad al Hurm and Shaikh Madhkur of Gaobandi visited Bahrain during the year. The former came to borrow money off Shaikh Hamad and the latter to collect debts due to him. Both asked the Political Agent for British help and both were told that nothing could be done to help them. ]\1 C 171 F. D.50 Keid - Tlie outstanding event of the year was the visit of His Majesty King Ibn Sa'ud to Bahrain. He left Ras Tannrah on the 20th February and landed at Bahrain on the 25th after the conclusion of the Lupm conference. He received an amazing ovation on his arrival, the Shaikhs having gone out to imct him as soon as the steamer was sighted. As luck would have it the Political Agent received a message from the Residency announcing that he was not coming and specially went to Shaikh Isa, who was awaiting him at the Palace to tell him so. As Bm Sa'ud landed almost immediately afterwards a most unfortunate impression was created Altogether, from the point of view of the British connection the visit was a dinaster, and nothing could have demonstrated more exactly the tenuity of our hold on Bahrain. The Political Agent visited Qatar on the 22nd January and returned on the 24th. The Amir, Muhammad bin Suwaihm was friendly and useful results wer. obtained. It was clear that the accounts received m Bahrain of the oppression o Bahama had been exaggerated, and even the subsecpient reports of other atrocities were found to be in most oases untrue. The situation continued to be delicate, however, and Bahrain, and strangely enough, the Shaikhs who take little mteres in Shiahs were much excited over our apparent inability to protect Bahrain - terests. As a result of the Political Agent's negotiations with the Amir and pro- bablv as a result of discovering that His Majesty s Government were only interest ed in genuine Bahama and had no intention of ascertaining any protection over those who had no claim to Bahrain nationality, the Nejd Government finally ap peared to accept the situation. In May, a genuine Bahrain! named Ahmad bm Abbas who had been imprisoned by them was released, an act which called forth the gratitude of his relatives to the British Government, whom they considered responsible. Continued efforts were made to find water by boring at Ras Tanurah but fortunately sand was encountered which defeated all efforts. If water were t found there, it would be a comparatively simple matter to establish a port an large proportion of the Bahrain trade would be diverted. The Qusaibis were in an even stronger position at the close of the F®'' ^ so long as they continue to do the lion's share of the mainland trade, tne favou of their roval master will have little effect on their great and growing power in Bahrain. On two occasions, they took advantage of the Political Agent s absence to commit arbitrary acts which showed unmistakably the position they would assume if they were allowed to become Bm Baud's official representatives m Bahrain, or if the hold of the Agency weakened. Bin Sa'ud wrote a most objectionable postscript to a letter he sent to Shaikh Hamad in which he complained of the injustice sub J ect s the Shaikh with the wrath of ' his friends no doubt referring to His Ma esty s Government. Shaikh Hamad and the Ruling Family were f^ e ^ at J®^ led f h J this letter, and Shaikh Hamad replied equally brusquely that he had heard of no complaints from Bin Sa'ud's subjects and invited him to say what they were. Bin Jiluwi recovered sufficiently to take over the Governorship of Hasa and in August made an attempt to get Shaikh Hamad to send him for decision a case of theft which occurrred in Bahrain harbour. In October Muhammad at Tawil's commission arrived and proceeded to tighten up financial control to the intense annoyance of the Qusaibis and Ajaps. The Political Agent was able to avert the impending quarrel between Shaikh Abdulla bin Jasim at Thani and Shaikh Hamad over Salaita. 8hal t h W as persuaded to return one who had some claim to Bahrain nationality so that he might regulate his debts and at the same time the Political Agent secured an um official guarantee that'the man would not be harmed. Bahrain, ^h its good Government and increasing number of capitalists, acts as a lodestone to labour in the smmunding terntone^and there is no doubt that others will leave their homes and migrate to Bahrain whether their rulers like it or not. Shaikh Abdulla bin Jasim exerted himself to rescue a young Persian Baluch who had been caught by slavers and brought to Qatar for sale. He was sent to Bahrain and repatriated to his home near Bandar Abbas.51 Qatar stares tlie prevailing depression to a greater degree tlian Bahrain, and customs have dropped by 50%. Shaikh Abdulla showed some signs of desiring a greater degree of protection from His Majesty's Government but finding no enthusiasm for closer contact on their part has not pursued the matter with vigour. Slavery. —Eighteen slaves were manumitted during the year. A traffic in women from Malabar to Bahrain came under notice during the year. Some women were repatriated and others assisted to find husbands. Steps fiave iZtaken to check this trade. Difficulty is experienced m dealing ^h ^ tims as very few persons here speak their language and recent arrivals know no Arabic. . . . Climate —The year was a hot one, and the cold weather very late m arriving. 1 • 93 inches of rain fell during the year. The close of the year found the Agency English office in a state o£ ol f ow '^ to the shortage of staff, the extra English office clerk asked for m June 1930 arriving till January 1931. In fact, but for the immense energy and devotion o duty of Mr. Gazdar, both as Head Clerk and officiating Indian Assistant, the English office would Have ceased to function. It is now the turn of the Vernacular office to re ^ ir \ assi ®\ a f ^ rlprk has been asked for to help with the increasing work. The number ot cases hqs increased bv 25% and at the close of the year it was found impossible to keep ™ wXpolHica 5 ! work The closing stages of the Nejd rebellion provided a great deal of work, and a great deal of time of the staff was taken up « th e Purdy ^ec a ^ cal work of decoding messages, one ten page message from the Colonial U Bin Sa'ud occupying the Head Clerk and Eirst Munshi for two whole days owmg to corrupt groups and the necessity for an accurate translation. If the extra vernacular clerk is not provided chaos will ensue. An Assistant Political Agent will also soon be needed, if the Political gem is to have any time to meet Arabs. The close of the year saw British prestige higher than the jear ^ ^ ® the year would have been satisfactory. C. G. PRIOR, Political Agent, Bahrain.53 tribesmen as a wliole were locally looked upon as subjects of Kuwait wlio were engaged in a struggle to escape from forced allegiance to Nejd. It may be recalled that prior to 1921 the Southern frontiers of Kuwait stretched from Hafar al-Batin to the sea near Jabal Manifa and included not only the wells of Safa, Haba, Qaraa, Jarriya Ilya, Jarriya Sifli and Nta, but also the main tribal areas of the Mutair, Ajman and Awazim tribes. The Ojair conference of December 1921 presided over by Sir Percy Cox, then High Commissioner in 'Iraq had however decided on the rectification of this frontier and had forced it back to the line as it stands to-day, transferring in the process, the above tribes, to Nejd. This decision was never really accepted by the Mutair and Ajman, and their leaders frequently urged during the rebellion that the Shaikh of Kuwait was their real ruler and overlord. It was however against the policy of His Majesty's Government that Kuwait should mix herself up in the rebellion and the Shaikh, inspite of great pressure from his people, loyally stood by his undertakings to His Majesty's Grovernment, and steadfastly refused to com mit himself. He did more, for by imposing a strict and close blockade against the rebels and by preventing all food and ammunition reaching them he was primarily responsible for the eventual collapse of the rebellion. It is fair that this fact should be placed on record, also that it was no defeat or reverse inflicted by the forces of the King which brought the rebellion to an end. (6) For his services during this trying period, the Shaikh received the K.C.I.E. in June 1930 (His Majesty the King's Birthday), the insignia of the order being presented to him on the 4th November 1930 by the Hon'ble the Political Kesident in full Durbar, at which also the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf and staff were present. For the occasion two British warships were present in Kuwait harbour, and a Naval guard of honour under a British Officer was landed, and drawn up out side the great Durbar Hall where the investiture took place. (c) Following established custom, His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait and members of the ' Al-Subah ' family dined officially at the Agency on the 1st January 1930, and again on 3rd June 1930, in honour of His Majesty the King Emperor's Birthday. (d) On the 22nd January, His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait, accompanied by his Senior relations Shaikh Abdullah al-Salim al-Subah, Shaikh Alial-Khalifa and Shaikh Salman al-Hamud proceeded by air in a ' Victoria ' machine to visit His Majesty King Bin Saud at Khabari Watha. Here the latter had camped with his force pending negotiations for the return of the rebels who had surrendered to the Royal Air Force (see paragraph VII below). The party returned to Kuwait on the 23rd January. Before they left, His Majesty King Bin Saud gave the customary presents to the Shaikh and his relatives, and suitable return presents were made by all, the Shaikh's contribution being 12 hawks, several mares and £500 to the junior members of the King's family. (e) Shaikh Abdullah al-Salim al-Subah throughout the trying period con nected with the rebellion gave loyal assistance and advice to the Ruler, and assist ed the Political Agent on more than one occasion with his advice. Shaikh Ab dullah is the most intelligent and well read member of the al-Subah ruling family, and possesses considerable strength of character. Normally he interests himself in education, and to better his younger brother's prospects and assist him in taking up a career he recently sent him to the American College at Beyrout. Shaikh Abdullah in politics is inclined to be pro Bin Saud and would likely nothing better than to be the means of satisfactorily settling the ' Blockade ' question. Shaikh Abdullah visited Basrah twice during the year namely on the 19th September and the 14th October. Whilst there he devoted his time to studying the various local educational establishments and their systems. (/) Shaikh Hamad, the favourite son of the famous ' Mubarak^' is the senior member, after the Ruler, of the ' Al-Subah ' House, and always acts, should the Ruler be absent from Kuwait. He is a well meaning but quiet person, and has little ability. This probably is due to the fact that his mother was a tribal lady of the Hathlain family. MC. 171 F.D.54 {g) It is unnecessary to enter into descriptions of the other members of tlie Kuwait ruling house, since there is no outstanding personality among them. III.— General and Local. (a) Relations with the Ruler. —These have been of a cordial and friendly nature,- and have continued so throughout the year. (h) Customs. —On the 1st January the Political Agent presented the local Director of Customs Abdul Latif al-Abdul Jalil, with the insignia and ' Sanad ' of Khan Bahadur which honour had been conferred on him for general good service during the tenure of office of Colonel More. This unfortunate individual was how ever arrested and convicted for forgery in June 1930 at the instance of Khan Bahadur Mirza Mohomed, C.I.E., Agent to His Excellency the ar-Shaikh of Moham- merah, and suffered dismissal and disgrace. Owing to his long and faithful services under three separate rulers, the Shaikh took a lenient view of his case and was content to let the man retire into obscurity. Three of his five properties in Kuwait were sold to pay sundry debtors, including the ea?-Shaikh of Mohammerah, the Shaikh himself buying two of them. The ex-Director of Customs left Kuwait for the Hejaz on 3rd August via 'Iraq, Syria and Egypt. He is now with His Majesty KinP' Bin Saud but so far has not been appointed to any official post. One Yusuf bin Yacub now holds sway as Director of Customs, and promises to be a success. He certainly has brought about a marked improvement in the port ' Lighter ' service, and to-day few complaints are received from masters of ships calling at Kuwait. From a ' Eevenue ' point of view, the year 1930 was a disastrous one for the Principality for not only did Kuwait's trade suffer like that of the rest of the world but the state was heavily hit by the failure of the 1930 pearl trade, and the conti- ■ nued blockade of ISTejd. (c) Blockade. —There was no real relaxation of this during the year 1930,. although after the rebellion a few Nejd tribes including the Mutair, Ajman and Awazim, were permitted to go up to Kuwait m small parties and purchase supplies. That Bin Saud was forced to allow this to happen throughout the summer of 1930 was apparently due to the threat of famine. The late rebels in particular were m very bad way owing to having lost most of their live stock, and found it quite impossible to fetch supplies from Hoffuf or Jubail as the King would have liked them to do. The trade which Kuwait is anxious to recover, is of course, the heavy caravan traffic that used to ply between the coast and the Nejd province of Qasim. This is the one trade that will bring recovery to the Principality, not the supplying of the Bedouine with their petty needs of dates and rice. Matters to-day are serious and unless something is done soon Kuwait will find itself in desperate plight. It is hoped that representations will be made to King Ibn Saud on the subject at an early date. Kuwait has a bargaining counter in the shape of her £100,000 claim against Nejd for damage done by Nejd forces during the past 9 years. If Ibn Saud would ease the blockade, she would willingly forego all these claims. {d) Municipality.—Kuwait, up to the beginning of 1930, possessed no munici pality in any sense of the word. Nature fortunately had endowed her with a sandy sub soil, so that her streets never looked really dirty, even after the heaviest rain. For these being covered with a sandy surface almost immediately absorbed any water that did not run into the sea or was drained away. There were however in different parts of the city many large heaps of accu mulated rubbish, which were very unsightly and offensive to the nostrils. There were also in various quarters of the town some fifteen deep and unsanitary pits resembling enormous ' shell ' craters, excavated in the first place to obtain build ing material, but never filled in. These had become the recognised latrine areas for the poor, in those portions of the town, in which they lay. Moreover the pits were breeders of swarms of flies in summer, and filling up in the winter season with65 rain water, gave out an obnoxious smell, and became tbe breeding ground for mosquitoes until nature dried tlie water up. In addition to the above, tlie dirty state of the fisli and meat markets, and the unsanitary condition of the town slaughter house, were always sources of anxiety. It was useless for the Political Agent to attempt any sudden reforms, as expe rience has shown that among conservative, not to say fanatical, communities such as exist in Kuwait, attempts to bring about sudden changes usually rebound on the reformer, and are quickly seized upon by hostile elements, only too ready al ways with their accusations of British interference, etc., etc. The Political Agent decided that by taking the matter quietly and educating the leaders, reforms would come of themselves. His policy in this and other matters has been to make the people themselves clamour for improvements and not to try and force his views on them. This policy has been justified by results—and whereas only two years ago he got the reply a propos of the question of street sweepers, ' God has always kept the city clean and healthy by giving us a sandy soil, dry climate, and hot sun, why therefore trouble yourself about sweepers,' to-day there is such a desire for improvements abroad, that if anything it requires checking. On 9th April, a red letter day for Kuwait, and as a result of prolonged and friendly discussions be tween the Political Agent and the Ruler^JHis Excellency the Shaikh issued a decree ordering a Municipality to be introduced for the town with staff as below:— One Rais el-Belladiyeh, ^ One Secretary, )-paid. One Mudir, and J 10 members, unpaid. His Excellency informed the Political Agent that to enable the necessary start to be made he had given Rs. 5,000 from his privy purse. This decision to start a municipality was the more praisworthy, as it meant the levying of further taxes on the people already feeling the effects of the depressed pearl market and bad trade. The principal municipal taxes ordered to be levied, were— House Tax, Boat Tax, Motor Car Tax, Slaughter House Tax, Arthiyeh (ground) Tax, Shop Tax. To-day an almost unbelievable change in the cleanliness of the town is apparent and among the principal improvements effected may be mentioned the following :— The removal of approximately 5,000 tons of street refuse in the shape of rubbish heaps. The appointment of street sweepers and the introduction of refuse and water carts. , The placing of circular metal recepticles at street corners, for rubbish. The widening of certain congested portions of the main Bazaar. The opening up of two new streets to motor traffic, and the widening gene- - rally of the motor car roads running along the water front of Kuwait. Approximately 5,000 houses have been numbered and to-day pay House Tax. When it is realized that in the past, there existed no form of municipal control and the public had been allowed to cast refuse anywhere they choose in the street, and that there had been no attempt to repair, sweep or light the streets, the boon conferred on the town has to be seen to be appreciated. To-day the most conservative of Arabs has been converted to the idea of sanitary improvements, and the need for cleanliness.Tlie introduction of an electric light plant and an ice factory sufficient for tlie needs of the city is now being discussed. It is hoped something may result some day though here again the Political Agent beyond giving advice, is not pushing the matter. (e) Abolition of the Arab Cloak or ' Abbah' —A curious and not so popular reform was the sudden decision of the Ruler to give up wearing the ' Abbah This took place in November and was intended primarily to assist the poorer classes of the town. The ' Abbah ' is an expensive garment and it was considered that a man would be greatly helped financially, if he could dispense with it and not feel disgraced. In deference to public opinion the Shaikh decreed that though he himself would no longer wear the garment, no one was to consider this dress re form as an ' order '. Things therefore remain much the same as before. (/) The Eastern and General Oil Syndicate, Limited. —Major F. Holmes of the above Syndicate arrived in Kuwait on 4th August and informed the Political Agent that the object of his visit was firstly to arrive at a settlement with the Shaikh in matters dealing with the Syndicate's water boring contract, and secondly to renew negotitions for an oil concession covering the whole of Kuwait territory. On receipt of this communication, both Major Holmes and the Shaikh were remind ed of His Majesty's Government's wishes that any company or corporation to whom an oil concession was given, must be a wholly British concern. Major Holmes left for the United Kingdom on the 20th August via 'Iraq. He was followed by his expert borer Mr. G. H. Armstrong on the 29th August. Major Holmes stated before he left that he hoped to arrange things to the satisfaction of His Majesty's Government when he got to London, though he admit- ' ed to the Political Agent that the Company behind his syndicate, namely the Am p,, rican ' Gulf ' group headed by Mr, Mellon, would be disappointed at the turn of events. That oil exists in Kuwait is certain, for the Political Agent has found and examined two places in the desert where the mineral comes up in a slow ooze and looses itself in the sand, but whether it is in workable quantities, remains for experts to decide, (g) Motor Launch Building. —This is the one industry tlfat to-day is in flou rishing condition. Some 10 large motor dhows for ' Yawash ' purposes have been built during the year, and as many more smaller sea going launches. Kelvin engines were mostly used in the above. His Excellency the Shaikh has supported the industry by ordering for himself a large dhow designed on European yacht lines. It is to be engined by Messrs. Thorneycroft, Limited, who are under order to send a 100 horse power 6 cylinder engine (oil or petrol) costing £900. The yacht is 65 feet long and has 3 cabins and is entirely decked in, Though the boat industry generally is flourishing as regards numbers of craft on the stocks, prices are far below average, and a good 50 feet dhow of any design can be purchas ed for Rs. 2,000 brand new (excluding masts, etc.). (h) The Civil Disobedience Campaign in India, and its effects in Kuwait.— The development of the civil disobedience movement has aroused much comment from time to time among better class Arabs of Kuwait. Those holding pro British views consisting of the Ruler and leading mer chants of the town have expressed astonishment and surprise, that the Government of India have not dealt more sternly with agitators. Anti British opinion on the other hand perhaps the more vociferous, has not tired of quoting government's inactivity as an instance of England's growing inability to rule Eastern Nations. Comment became so open at one time, that the Ruler in May was constrained to rebuke certain persons in open Majiliss or Durbar. He particularly dealt with those who went about spreading the story that the British would shortly be driven out of India, and that 'Iraq and Arab states generally would do well not to be behind hand. (i) Drug Store. —In June a praiseworthy attempt was made to start a proper chemist shop in Kuwait under the auspices of Seyed Hamid Beg al-Naqib, Basrah, deputy in the 'Iraq Parliament. For this purpose Dr. Puran Singh of Basrah, a well known and popular Indian practitioner was sent down from Basrah. After arranging all details, the matter unfortunately fell through for lack of money.57 0a ' ed Kw ™ ai t ^jects Mohammerah -ln &lt; l Uestl&lt; f f t 0 Aether Kuwait subjects who owed money to the ex- , ' to make payment in cash, would be allowed The Hon'We S P rt T^!? 8 ' h0U T P ro P ert y caused some anxiety to the Ruler, the Hon ble the Political Resident, whose advice was sought, referred the matter to His Majesty s Government, who at the end of the year decided that it would be wrong or house property m Kuwait to pass into foreign hands in this fashion. The Shaikh was instructed accordingly, he being at the same time urged to do everything possible to assist m the settlement of debts on a cash basis. IV.— Locusts, + i J n iJl lst h ! lf 1 of FeWl T' alarming stories of the approach of locusts from the kouth began to be current, this was followed by reports from the neutral area near the Southern border of Kuwait that very many sheep had died as a direct result ot the country-side being denuded of fodder. On 25th February it became certain that Kuwait State would have to with- stand a visitation of the dreaded ' Dibba ' or locusts in the ' crawler' stage, ic b jaikh made plans for an organized campaign against the insects should they t 01 ! i 1 - 6 t0 ^ n 'i ? 10t]l messengers from the South brought news of the hatciiing of the dreaded ' Dibba ' everywhere. Qn 28th March avastaimy'of black 'crawlers' was reported 15 miles South o the town. While other armies were reported to be converging on Jahara the oasis 20 miles West of Kuwait. On 7th April the Political Agent visited and ex amined the Dibba area to the South of the town and found crawlers advancing on a 4 mile front with depth of 2 miles. The country over which the insects had passed ^was stripped quite bare, and where bushes had previously been seen nothing but bare desert sand remained. Even thick stalks of large bushes 3 feet high were entirely devoured. On 11th April the Political Agent proceeded to Jahara to see what could be done to help the Shaikh's officials in the serious situation that had arisen there. He found the sett lenient in process of being attacked and overrun by a vast horde of ''Dibba'. The villagers were making a gallant fight, by means of trenches, fires, and covering the walls of their gardens with newspapers, strips of tin, and glazed paper brought from Kuwait. These latter prevented the insects from climbing. Put the efforts of the people were unavailing and the gardens round Jahara were all overwhelmed. The Political Agent estimated the attacking army to have a 5 mile front with unknown depth, there being two forms of insects, the black one of 2 weeks' growth, and the black and yellow of a month's growth, None of them had wings. On the 22nd April myriads of ' Dibbas ' reached Kuwait town, and in spite of all the Shaikh's plans to combat them, swept over the city walls into the town, and destroyed every garden in the place. The ravages of the creatures and the persis tent way in which they swarmed over every building and into the innermost appartments of houses, had to be seen to be believed. The Agency building endur ed a five days attack, and in spite of gauze doors and windows a great many got in side the public rooms, where they did much damage to carpets and furniture. On 28th April relief came, and there was an easing off of the plague as the locusts in the meantime had grown wings and learned to fly. In the process millions fell into the sea. By 1st May none were left South of the Bay of Kuwait, though the flying horde continued its depredations towards the North. Y—Pearl Season. The 1930 Pearl Season was a complete failure as far as the sale of pearls was cpncerned, though the actual catch was up to average. This coming on top of the disastrously bad 1929 season and the continued failure of Kuwait to come to a trade agreement with Bin Saud resulted in one of the most serious situations that Kuwait has as yet had to meet. The arrival at Bahrain of Monsieur Rosenthal and other well known Paris dealers in September for a short time caused hopes to rise, but when these finally left without buying, matters looked bad indeed. By the end of the year we had the spectacle of wealthy pearl merchants so poor MC171 F. D.58 that they could not pay naukhodas or divers their shares of the previous season's' ; catch, even though they had their safes full of pearls. The divers would take no excuses and demanded money to keep them alive. Things became so acute that the Ruler had to step in and force merchants to find money somehow to relieve the distress. The principal sufferers were of course the diver community and to-day their lot is not to be en vied. One can only hope that the 1931 season willbe'a better one, for Kuwait's very existence depends on the Pearl Market so long as the land blockade continues. The pearl season opened on 15th May (Rakba) and closed on 20th September (Guffal). VI.— Condition of the Country {Law and Order). This has been more satisfactory than at any period during the last 9 years. These good results were due to two things— {a) The successful operations of the King of Hejaz and Nejd against the rebel Akhwan tribes which ended in their surrender and subsequent punishment early in February which have had a very healthy effect on the Bedouin of Arabia generally. (h) The better defensive arrangements made by the Ruler of Kuwait as a result of the introduction of his armed Ford car desert force. This force following the successful methods adopted in the 'Iraq Southern desert has brought any point on the frontier line of Kuwait within a day's march of headquarters, and on the slightest rumour of a raid or incident, cars rapidly move out to the scene of trouble deal with it and return all in the matter of one day. Results will be even more satisfactory when Kuwait is able to bring her armed car strength up to 12 as is the- eventual objective. The following tribal incidents were dealt with during the year :— (a) On 1st March 5 'Iraq robbers were caught red handed stealing sheep in Kuwait territory. They were duly apprehended brought into Kuwait and handed over to the Commandant, 'Iraq Southern Desert Police for punishment. (h) The above incident was followed up early in March by an epidemic of' robberies in several cases accompanied by violence, on the part of the 'Iraq shepherd tribes camped in the Northern part of Kuwait. Things came toja pass when the Kuwait tribes and their Ruler asked for permission to retaliate. The Political Agent decided that the best course was to call in the 'Iraq Commandant of Police Southern Desert and get him to control the shepherd tribes by posting a force of Police with them. The Commandant himself to come and assist in the settlement of complaints and the restitution of property. The plan worked well, and after 10 days' streneous work among the Kuwait and shepherd tribes during which period the Political Agent, the Commandant of Police and a representative of the Shaikh laboured in closest harmony, all claims were settled, and disturbers of the peace duly punished. fc) Early in May 'Iraq Dhafir raiders carried off six camels and 2 mares from the Shaikh's Fidawiyeh. These were recovered through the instrumentality of Captain Glubb,. Inspecting Officer, Southern 'Iraq Desert. (d) On 28th May reports were received that 64 camels had been raided by the Dhafir from one Daas al-Kuthairi and 16 other Kuwait subjects, also that six camels belonging to Subah al-Nasir had been subse quently stolen. Complaint was at once made to Captain Glubb but the animals have not yet been recovered. («) On 25th September a small raiding party of Harb rounded up and drove off 16 camels belonging to one Faleh ibn Khudaiyir of Kuwait and shot the man in charge. The owner accompanied by the Shaikh's men vigorously pursued, caught up the raiders in the 'Iraq Neutral Zone, 150 miles away and brought back 5 of the raiders and 4 camels. Negotiations are still proceeding with the Nejd authorities for the recovery of the remainder.59 YII.— Akhwan Rebellion (Final Phase). In this Agency's Administration Report for 1929 a detailed account of the Akhwan Rebellion and the subsequent combined operations of Bin Saud and the Royal Air Force againstthe rebels was given step by step from the battle of Sabilla down to the end of 1929. In order to complete the story of this desert drama which was so closely connected with Kuwait, it is proposed below to continue the account from the point left off in December 1929. When the rebel forces lay camped on both sides of the Batin depression from Hafar up to Rigai, the point where the Kuwait-'Iraq frontiers joint at their Southernmost extremity. At sunset on 28th December Muhsin al Firm, Commanding Bin Sand's Western force Or left wing, advanced from Shaib Fulaij with a strong mixed force of Harb, Shammar and Dhafir tribesmen, and fell upon the rebels at dawn on 29th Deoember. The latter reduced to a shadow of their former strength by desertions to the King were completely surprised. They had been expecting to receive letters- from Bin Saud offering them terms of peace in reply to Faisal al-Duwish's messengers who had several days previously gone in to the Royal camp, begging to be allowed to surrender. They had therefore stupidly taken no precautions against and attack from the West, Not much harm was done, however, for thejrebels quickly rallied and drove off the attackers. They however sustained 50 casualties and lost some 4,000 camels. The attack was made without orders from the King, but nevertheless ha^ been made out to be a great battle and the decisive victory of the campaign, by Mecca- historians. On the 30th December, the Mutair who had borne the brunt of the attack joined the Ajman at Um Amarat al-Mahazul, a point just inside Kuwait territory, and there met the chief staff officer, Royal Air Force, whose force was concentrated near Rigai, its rule being to prevent the rebels crossing into 'Iraq or Kuwait.. The Chief Staff Officer ordered the rebels to surrender and be interned, or recross the border. On 31st December, Ibn Ashwan and the Braih group of the Mutair tried to escape South Fast round Bin Saud's right flank. They were intercepted South of Musannat ridge and destroyed. On 3rd January after prolonged conversations the rebel leaders decided to move South across the border, after rejecting the Chief Staff Officer's terms. They had no news of the near proximity of the King's army at this period, but only that Muhsin al Firm had retired to the West again. On the 5th January Bin Saud appeared at Rigai and the rebels changed direc- tion Horth East again and made for Jahara by forced marches, leaving several thousands of sheep and camels dying by the way. On 6th January the Royal Air Force combined armoured car and aeroplane force overtook the rebels near al-Atraf 10 miles West of Jahara, and found them completely disorganized and fleeing in all directions. They obviously feared an immediate attack by Bin Saud's army and were not aware that the latter could not cross the frontier. On 7th January the rebels moved to Jahara, where they were promptly pinned in by means of bombs dropped from the air round the village at regular intervals. On the 8th January some Jiblan and Rashaida sections of the Mutair, also a few Ajman attempted to make a dash South, and reach Jarriya in rear of the King^s force. They were intercepted by Bin Saud's car force and nearly all destroyed in the Shaqq South of Manaqish. On 8th January, Faisal al-Duwish handed over the women of his household including his wife,. 3 sisters, two small children and 27 other ladies of the Dooshan clan for safe keeping to the Political Agent, who throughout these latter operations had kept in close touch with the rebel leaders, and had latterly brought all his * influence to bear to get them to surrender to the British. All the ladies were taken into the fort at Jahara, and subsequently to Kuwait where they were carefully cared for at Government expense. On 9th January, the Political Agent persuaded Naif ibn Hathlain to surrender to the armoured car column, and he was followed by Faisal al-Duwish and Ibn Lami60 on 10th January. All 4 leaders were sent by air to Basrah and placed on a British, warship. llie remnants of the Mutair rebels (mainly Dooshan and Diyahin) and the greater part of the Ajman tribe were instructed to move north to the Jarishan Rothatain area of Kuwait state where they remained under guard of the Royal Air Force armoured cars until finally handed over to Bin Saud. During the period of their incarceration they suffered somewhat from attacks by the Dhafir and other Iraq tribes, who thinking them fair game and in revenge for past raids and attacks did their utmost to steal their camels and the remnant of their sheep. On the 20th January it having been decided that a mission should proceed to Bin Saud's camp (now at Khabari Watha, 90 miles South West of Kuwait) to discuss ways and means of surrendering the rebel leaders and their followers, the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf accompanied by the Political Agent Kuwait and the Chief Staff Officer^ Royal Air Force, left for the King's camp by air. The rebel leaders in the meantime were brought to Kuwait on H. M. S. ' Lupin '. On 22nd January, H. E. the Shaikh of Kuwait and members of the al-Subah family proceeded by air to the King's camp to pay their respects. They returned on the 23rd January. On 26th January^ after considerable bargaining, the Hon ble the Political Resident was able to extract the following terms from Bin Baud in return for the surrender of the Rebel Leaders and their tribesmen. (1) He would spare the lives of the leaders and their followers. (2) Any punishment he might award would be tempered with kindness and mercy, though he reserved the right to recover from the rebels, any loot they might have taken from others. (3) He promised categorically to prevent raids in future by the Ajman, Mutair and other Nejd tribes on either 'Iraq or Kuwait. Should such occur he would effect a settlement without delay, under the provisions of the Bahra agreement in the case of 'Iraq, and in the case of Kuwait, to restore immediately anything plundered in ac cordance with customs aurrent between Nejd and Kuwait. He was ready to negotiate any agreement with Kuwait on Bahra agree ment lines, should the Shaikh desire. (4) He promised to settle all past claims with 'Iraq under the terms of the Bahra agreement, and with Kuwait in accordance with current practice, provided that all Ajman and Mutair with their followers and property in hands of the Royal Air Force were returned to Neid territory. • ' (5) He agreed to pay £10,000 as compensation to tribes in Kuwait and 'Iraq, in anticipation of a final settlement of accounts. (6) He would appoint representatives to a tribunal under the Bahra agree ment at anytime, one month after receipt of a request to do so. On 27th January the surrender terms having been duly signed by both Bin Saud and the Hon'ble the Political Resident, the mission returned to Kuwait. On 28th January the 3 rebel leaders were landed from H. M. S. ' Lupin ' and taken by air to Bin Saud's camp under charge of Lieutenant-Colonel H. R. P. Dickson, C.I.E., the Political Agent, and were there personally handed over to the King. On 29th January the Rebel forces were ordered to commence their return journey to Nejd in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The Armoured Car column of the Royal Air Force controlled their Southward movement along the route selected shepherding them towards Manaqish. r On 4th February, all rebels were handed over to Bin Saud's emissaries on the border at Manaqish. On 12th February Bin Saud moved to Hamaidat al Qata near Jarriya after having arranged for the removal of the rebel leaders to Riath, and the confiscation of some two-thirds of the rebel live-stock.61 On 16tli February, Bin Said left Jarriya for Ras Tanurah, from where lie Btibsequently embarked for his meeting with the King of 'Iraq (the Lupin Conference). While this is not the place to go into exact details of the eventual punishment meted out to the rebels, the following short summary of what was done may not be out of place. (a) From Faisal al^DuWish were taken all his personal camels, including the famous ' Shurruf ' or black breed—also all his horses and mares. (b) From the ' Dushan ' or chiefly clan were taken only loot taken from other people which worked out to about two-thirds of their property. Private property was untouched. (c) From the rank and file, were taken all riding camels, horses and mares as well as property looted from others. {d) Neither Ibn Shiblan nor Ibn Majid, the well-known Mutair leaders, were required to give up anything as a reward for surrendering volun tarily, and not through the Royal Air Force. (e) No rifles were confiscated. The Aj man's treatment was identical with that meted out to the Mutair. Thus ended the story of the famous Faisal Al-Duwish, than whom Arabia never produced greater warrior nor Bin Saud more devoted follower until ingratitude drove him to rebellion. VIII.— Relations with Nejd. (а) The collapse of the Akhwan rebellion, and the final surrender of the rebel leaders and their tribes may be said to have ushered in a new era of peace and good will between Nejd and Kuwait, as far as attacks, raids and other frontier incidents were concerned—only one small and insignificant raid took place, namely on 25th September 1930 [see paragraph VI (e) of this report] to mar relations, and at the time of writing there is every reason to suppose that full restitution will be made by the Nejd authorities. When it is recalled that for the last nine years, Bin Baud's Akhwan raiders have carried fire and sword right up to the walls of Kuwait, and have generally rendered life for the Kuwait tribes intolerable, this unaccustomed state of affairs have given the deepest satisfaction to all, from Ruler down to meanest peasant. (б) It is true that during February 1930, first Barjas ibn Othman and then Mohamed ibn Sultan, two of Bin Saud's lieutenants, acting under orders and ac companied by a force of mounted men in each case, endeavourd, with that ar rogance so typical of the Nejdi warrior, to cross the Kuwait border and search for cer- tam missing rebels and their camels, without obtaining previous permission. Their activities did not last long, for the Political Agent met them and quetly ordered them to remove themselves. This action had a good effect, and the two men immediately changed their tone, 'and so apologetic did their attitude become, that the Ruler advised by the Political Agent allowed them to again enter the state with a small escort and examine all Kuwait camels. In each case they were accom panied by the Political Agent or a deputy. In this way the search was carried out in friendly manner, and on correct lines. In all 129 tents 456 camels and 32 sheep actually belonging to rebel parties who had escaped the notice of the Royal Air Force were found in Kuwait terri tory, as well as 53 camels which had been sold by rebles to Kuwait tribesmen. The former were duly handed over, and full acknowledgment taken, while the latter were retained pending receipt by the purchasers of the money which they had paid for them, this was in accordance with the tribal law of' Arafa', which the Sheikh of Kuwait and the Political Agent insisted should be applied. Bin Saud's emissaries made a gallant attempt to secure the camels by ' bluff ', threat ening all and sundry with the King's anger and long arm, but the Kuwait authorities remained adamant. After somewhat lengthy correspondence Bin Saud admitted the right of the Kuwait tribes to be paid their money, and quite recently brought the matter to a successful ending by sending the full sum demanded to Kuwait (c) Following on the terms arranged between the Hon'ble the Political Resi dent with the King (see paragraph VII), it is hoped that a simple agreement will MC171FD62 shortly be ratified between Kuwait and ISTeid ffivinff bofli ^fafoa fV»Q indication tliat tlie amount will soon be received. ' ■ ^ IX. —Relations with 'Iraq. These have remained uniformly friendly throughout the year in spite of two h^np? an i) &lt;1 iI eS l 1 i 0n ^ a r alt settle:alellt between the two states. These it is n? W ' M • s ^ o y tI y be brought to a satisfactory conclusion through the good offices of His Majesty s Government. For ready reference they consist of :1 (a)The question of taxation of the Shaikh of Kuwait's date gardens on the Shatt al-Arab. (b) The question of the 'Iraq telegraph line in Kuwait.

By treaty the Shaikh of Kuwait is debarred from allowing a foreign power to place a post or telegraph office in his state. ^ ^ X.— Relations with Persia, .... ^ . Tlle ?e have been good, and no untoward incident has arisen. That Persia Still claims Kuwait as part of her empire is shown by the fact that her Passport officials continue to issue ' Dm-o-Khabars ' to travellers visiting Kuwait, on which g written in French For travellers proceeding from one Persian Port to another Jrersian P or t. The Shaikh's attitude is one of amused toleration and all that happens is that a Persian traveller has his papers taken from him and a British Oertmcate of Identity is given in its place at a cost of Rs. 2. j-i. during the Qashqai rebellion, that a hardy annual,' the accusation, at arms were being run from Kuwait to Persia for the use of the rebels was brought up, but the local authorities had little difficulty in refuting the charge. XI.— Political Agent's tours. During the year under review the Political Agent went all over the Shaikhs territory by car, visiting practically every important point on the Kuwait-'Iraq fron tier line, and also the Kuwait-Nejd frontier. In addition separate journeys were one along the whole Southern frontier line itself, at a time when it was necessary to deny Kuwait territory to the Nejd rebels. ... The main object of the Political Agent in making these tours was to familiarize nimself with the hinterland, the various wells, caravan routes, grazing areas, and the lines of the annual migrations of the Kuwait and neighbouring border tribes. In one respect these trips were found to be of inestimable value, for the Political Agent got to know the Kuwait tribes thoroughly and their Shaikhs, as well as most63 of the Shaikhs of the Ajman, Mutair, Awazim and Shammar tribes of Nejd who at different times come up to Kuwait and camp on or inside the border. XII.—Postal Arrangements. ( l l T ^ e Ira q Motor Transport Company which started operations in 19] 8 has maintained on the whole a satisfactory service, and mails have been e vered regularly from Basrah which have connected with the fast mails to Europe and India, as well as the various air mails. ^ /ke transport service has maintained one official mail in each direction per week, though if passenger cars happened to run on other days, a mail bag was usually made up and sent with it also. S Rll JV . S v ea ; ■ KuW fI t 7 as servei3 b y the weekly up slow mail steamer from xJasraii and the bi-weekly down steamer. XIII.— Medical. (1) Health of the town. This has been fairly satisfactory during the year. (а) Tuberculosis has taken its usual toll, and there is no abatement in its spread among families in the town and even among the Bedouins. The habits and customs of the poeple are such that the spread of any contagious or infectious disease is great ly facilitated. Energetic steps, however, were taken in a recent case of leprosy imported from Persia and the sufferer was sent back. (б) Infantile diseases were as bad as ever, with the addition of whooping cough which was bad during the year. This state of affairs will continue as long as the mothers are ignorant of the first principles of Infant Welfare and Hygiene. (c) Common diseases are those of the skin, bowels, eyes and ears, and the ulti mate results of the two latter is evidenced by the large number of one-eyed and deaf in the town, all of which are due to lack of early treatment. (2) Sanitation.—In previous years there has been none. This year a Munici- pality has been formed which is doing good work in cleaning of rubbish heaps, fill ing m evil smelling hollows, establishing dust bins at suitable spots, and clearing away the rubbish m carts. &amp; Narrow lanes are also being widened and drains dug for drainage. (3) Water. As in previous years this is brought by dhows in wooden tanks from the river at J?ao and distributed to houses by means of kerosine oil tins. (4) Epidemics. —None. (5) Quarantine. There have been the usual precautions such as inspection of all passengers and ships arriving at the port. Quarantine of passansers when necessary takes place in 2 buildings situated about a mile outside the wall of the town. (6) Charitable Dispensary. —The following numbers by classes were treated during the year. Men ., Women 4 . 4 Male children.. Female children 4,717 4,965 3,007 2,056 Total .. 14,745 At present the dispensary needs better accommodation and more room. It is hoped to arrange this improvement very shortly and a four room building for the purpose has been earmarked which only awaits doing up, when it will be handed over to the medical officer.

(a) As was anticipated in the Administration Report of this Agency for 1929, the Kuwait Spring of 1930 was a bad one from the ' hay crop ' point of view. (I)) The summer of 1930 was again abnormally hot. The months of July and August were the two worst months. From 15th July to the 31st August the daily a verage maximum temperature was 112° F. with almost continual dry hot winds from the desert varied by very heavy dust storms every third or fourth day. The highest temperature recorded was 118° F. in the Agency on August 2nd. But much higher temperatures were recorded away from the sea front. (c) September ushered in a sudden change in the temperature, the 2nd Sep tember showing a drop in the maximum to 105°, accompanied by a S. E. wind from the Persian Gulf of great humidity. This wind continued more or less through out the month, and was more unpleasent to bear than the high drv temperatures of August and July. (d) The first rain should have fallen in early October, but this failed utterly and rain did not fall in the vicinity of Kuwait till well into December. One hundred and fifty miles to the South and South West however good rain fell in November ; plentiful rains fell in Nejd also but was somewhat later than usual. ( e ) Up to the 31st December 1930 Kuwait had a total of 4-81 inches of rain or 4 inches below the average : the shortage of rain in Kuwait state proper is very serious and the spring of 1931 will hit local shepherds very hard indeed as there will be no grazing for flocks based on Kuwait town and the neighbouring villages of the Qusur.
