The original treaty of 1891 was given a term of twelve years, which was extended at regular intervals afterwards, initially for several years at a time and later on an annual basis. In 1939 a replacement treaty was signed between the two parties.The file concerns the impact on the new treaty of the recent constitutional changes in India and Pakistan. The correspondence covers the following: the appointment of consuls by the British Government on behalf of India (as stipulated in the 1939 treaty), and whether this arrangement will continue once India becomes a republic; the question of whether the new dominion of Pakistan automatically remains a party to the treaty; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman's [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] intention not to renew the treaty, which is due to expire in February 1951.The file features the following correspondents: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the United Kingdom's High Commissioner for India; officials of the Foreign Office and the Government of Pakistan.Included with the correspondence is a copy of an order issued by Governor-General Mountbatten of Burma [Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma] on 14 August 1947 – an agreement regarding the devolution of international rights and obligations upon the dominions of India and Pakistan</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Pakistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat (1939)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM High Commissioner to India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000021#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000021#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
