Most modern in construction and beautiful in appearance—some thing quite new in the line, with many advantages over the usual run of Secateurs. wnn the usual type or Seca teurs, the branch is gripped between the two blades and the branch is crushed and severed by the blades pressing into it from both sides; this action naturally leaves a bruised edge, hurting and damaging the t^ee to a certain extent. i THE WONDER ROLLER” SECATEUR is constructed with what is called the Rolling Motion which cuts with a clean, even edge such as is impossible with a direct cut and secondly requires much less power and force to operate. Hence it is an “ Ideal ” Secateur for ladies’ use. ft is easy to manipulate and does not hurt or tire the hands. Its action is remarkably smooth. Model No. 5 is with broad blades and No. 4 with narrow, pointed blades. (See catalogue second page for further particulars.) ° ’ No. 5 Price Rs. 8 . No. 4. Price Rs. 7. Spare Blade Re. 1.

Sir, I have the honour to say that I am anxious to study the conditions under which agriculture is carried on in the Islands of Bahrain with a view to devising schemes for the improvement of the conditions of the unfortunate peasantry somewhat on the lines of the action which has been successfully taken in the matter of the dairy industry. ^^^a^ears to me that the simplest method of acquiring this A would be to buy a date garden and study the conditions of the employment of labour upon it and their remunerations for a i least a year. Rule 10(1)(c) of the Government servants conduct rules now reads,however,'that no Governmenl servant may acquire any immobeable property without the previous sanction of the Governor General in Council'. Bahrain is not a territory so specified but there is little doubt that the same principle is applicable here. I would be grateful therefore if the Government of India could be approached with a view to sanctioning the purchase of a date garden. garden would would be as small as possible for the purpose and I would buy it in open auction so that no uestion of any favour in accjuiring it will possibly arise. u 4 ! * 1I trust the llon T ble the Political Resident will a^ree that there is no objection to my acquiring a property for this purpose and will see his way to approaching and recommending the proposal to Government. I would be glad to receive as early a reply as is possible. I have the honour to be Zir, Your Yost Obedient Servant Political Agent, Bahrain.N.B.

Negotiations were, however, successfully concluded with an Arab garden owner who agreed to supply your requirements. There is a reluctance at this time of year to part with them. 2. The plants have been placed in five wooden cases and each case contains five plants. The labels on the cases give the particulars of the colours. At the time of removing the plants from their present boxes care should be taken that the boxes are cut open by means of a saw so that the roots oi the plants are not damaged inany way. 5* -he cases containing the plants were handed overover in person by a member of my staff to the Commander of the s.s.

Yours sincerely,Terms of Business if As plants are perishable and likely td be injured in a long (or return) journey, it is necessary that atleast half the price of the plants must accompany the order. The balance will be recovered by V. P. P. Wherever possible, the plants will be sent by passenger train, securely packed in baskets. But for distant places like Ceylon and Burma, they could also be sent by post, packed either in specially made baskets or three-ply wooden boxes. The inland postage is 4 annas per pound upto 20 pounds. Though every care will be taken to see that all the plants we send out are true to name and description, we do not hold ourselves responsible for thorn. On account of the very nature of the plants and the disturbance to their roots during the journey, a small percent age of them are likely to die for which some allowance must be made and naturally we cannot be held responsible for any loss. The packing of the plants will be done with great care amd every precaution taken to ensure their safe arrival. The packing and freight or postage charges will be charged at cost. Mention nearest railway station while ordering. PESTONJEE P. POCHA &amp; SONS, Seed Merchants, 8, Napier Road, POONA. January lOStt.ROSES BUDDED ROSES (Standards.)

In India, due to climatic variations, it is very difficult to store foreign seeds for a longer time, and we have in a great measure to depend on these foreign seeds for a good quality of yggQ-^o^^QS many country vegetable seeds do not yield good vegetables. We have drawn up a scheme for your benefit, it is as follows:- The seeds we will supply you will be of the very best quality both imported and acclimatized. These will be posted six times in the year, and at the proper time for sowing, this will ensure germination, and supply of vegetable from your garden will be continuous, and your Mali will have no excuse for non germina tions or being without seeds for sowing at their proper season. This scheme of ours will not only be useful to the general public, but to schools, hotels, and boarding houses, and we supply the same under three different headings. For a small kitchen garden RS: 10/- for a large kitchen gar den RS : 20/— and an extra large kitchen garden Rs: 35/— Over leaf you w j_]_l find the quantity of seeds we will supply under each heading.

We remain. Dear Sir or Madam, Yours faithfully, N. COOPER Ct- CO. WARRANTY Complaints made that seeds are not good, should quite as often be attributed to other causes, as to the quality of the seeds. There are contingencies continually arising to prevent the very best seeds always giving satisfaction, such as sowing too deep too shallow, in too wet or too dry soil; insects of all descriptions destroying the plants as soon as, or before they appear, heavy or continuous rains, cold weather, frosts, chemical changes in the seeds induced by tem perature etc. Soil preparation for the reception of seeds is very important, if not properly done seed with very high germination is bound to perish. For all these reasons it is impossible to guarantee seed under all circumstances, and WHILE WE EXERCISE THE GREATEST CARE TO HAVE ALL SEEDS PURE AND RELIABLE, we give no warranty, express or implied, as to description, quality, productiveness of any other matter of any Seeds or Bulbs we send out, and we will not be in any way responsible for the crop. If the purchaser does not accept the goods on these terms they are at once to be returned. WE TEST ALL OUR SEEDS BEFORE SENDING THEM TO OUR CUSTOMERS, as it is perfectly clear to all who give it a thought that it is to our best interest to send out only such stock as will not only grow well but will give entire satisfaction. ♦ ♦ ALWAYS DIVIDE THE PACKETS AND SOW SEEDS AT DIFFERENT TIMES. ♦♦ In case of failure you can then give them a second or third trial.

Bill for grass seeds (Rupees 402-0-0 ) • * I am afraid we will not be able to pay this bill from our Office Allowance Grant, ^here was a balance of Rs.109/5 on the 31st of December in the C.A. and we have asked for an additional grant of Rs. 3,000/- to cover the excess over the sanctioned grant (Rs. 15,100/-). There are three months (January, February and March) and I think with strict economy we will be able only to meet our O.A. expenditure from the additional grant. T'ay this bill be paid from the Unofficial Funds at present and debited to C.A. on the 1st of April i.e. in the next financial year, please?

Papers relating to the maintenance of the garden include correspondence relating to the recruitment of a gardener from India, water and electricity supply, and damage to a garden water tank.Other items in the file include:a price list of flower and vegetable seeds supplied by Sutton &amp; Sons and imported by Bliss &amp; Company of Karachi, received at the Political Agency in September 1930 (ff 58-59);an illustrated brochure of Christmas gifts for gardens, produced by Pestonjee P Pocha &amp; Sons, received at the Political Agency in November 1930 (ff 73-80);a brochure advertising new year offers for roses, cannas, chrysanthemums, fruit trees and other plants, produced by Pestonjee P Pocha &amp; sons (ff 115-120);a price list of Arthur Yates &amp; Company’s Australian flower and vegetable seeds for 1935/1936, supplied by Bliss &amp; Company (f 172);correspondence dated 1936/1937 between Nora Loch and the curator at the Royal Botanical Gardens in Edinburgh, Roland Edgar Cooper, concerning seeds and plants for the Agency Garden (ff 226-229, f 232);a list of cuttings and seeds planted in the Political Agency garden.
