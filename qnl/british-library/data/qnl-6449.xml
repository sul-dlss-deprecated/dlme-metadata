PERSIA, HERAT, AND SEISTAN. ! Note .—This Abstract is submitted in con tinuation of Political Secretary’s Note, of 1st December 1879, on Persia. From Foreign Office, 14th Jan. 1879. Consequent upon certain despatches received from Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran in the autumn of 1878, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, early in 1879, took into his consideration the ques tion of the relations between England and Persia, and addressed this Office in the following terms:— a The despatches noted in the margin, which have been communicated to the India Office, will have brought to Lord Cranbrook’s notice the fact that the relations of the Shah of Persia with England are very much occupying His Majesty’s mind and that of his advisers at the present time. To Mr. Thomson, Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, he expresses a great anxiety to stand well with England, and gives assurances that he is under no engagement with Pussia. In his conversations with the Turkish Ambassador at Teheran, the dominant feeling, on the other hand, seems to be a fear lest the growth of English power on his western frontier should threaten his independence. The feelings of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs appear to be uniformly more favourable than those of the Shah, and, from the information conveyed to this Department by Sir H. Layard, the same leaning in our favour is observable in the Persian Ambassador at Constantinople. “ I am directed by the Marquis of Salisbury to request that you will point out to the Secretary of State for India that it appears, from the indications afforded from these and other sources, that there is a party at the Persian Court which is anxious to cultivate the alliance of England as a safeguard against the menacing approach of Fussia, and that this party includes the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The opinions of the Shah are less favourable, but his refusal of supplies to the Prussians during their late expedition beyond Chat, which appears to have been carried so far as to entirely baffle General Lomakine, and force him to retreat, shows that he has by no means surrendered himself wholly to the influence of llussia. The same inference may be drawn from the fact that the Russians have lately made the utmost efforts to conciliate His Majesty bv costly presents and other demonstrations of good will. His state of feeling, indeed, seems analogous to that of Shere Ali, whose position in many ways resembled his own. He distrusts both Poweis, but to him the Russian is the nearest, and therefore the most dreaded of the two. “ The language consistently held by the Persian Minister in London points also to the conclusion to 3627. L171. A i fiwhich these considerations would lead, that any advance on the part of England would be recipro cated at Teheran, and might secure, for a time at least, the possession of a sensible influence over the Persian Court. “ The recent communications of the Kussian Ambassador at Teheran appear to imply that the acquisition of a commanding power over the Turcomans by an advance in the direction of Merv, is a policy largely occupying the thoughts of the party of action in Russia at this moment. There is every reason to believe that no such expedition could meet with even a temporary success unless it were provisioned by Persia. Any counteracting influence at the Persian Court means, therefore, the loss of the essential condition of a Russian advance along the Attrek, This consideration alone appears to Lord Salisbury to establish the advantage of a good understanding at the present time between England and Persia. Lord Salisbury has directed that these matters should be brought to the notice of Lord Cranbrook, because the impending settle ment in Afghanistan offers an opportunity which may not speedily recur of establishing a hold upon the goodwill of the Shah, on easy terms and in an efficacious manner. The passion for an increase of territory, which is strong with all Oriental Sovereigns, is believed to have a special power over his mind, and accounts for the bitter disappoint ment which, in common with Shere Ali, he felt at the award of the Seistan Arbitration. If a rectification of frontier in his favour were made one of the conditions of the approaching peace between this country and Afghanistan, an advan tage would be gained which would be qualified by no sensible drawback. Our relations with Afghan istan are likely in future to be too solid to run any risk from the _ feelings with which a small portion of the population might view such a measure. The Shah would not only be conciliated, and give us the benefit of whatever influence gratitude may be supposed to exercise over his counsels, but he would obtain an extension of territory which the loss of our favour would seriously imperil. Abutting, as it would, upon Khelat and the country of Candahar, and containing a turbulent population, it would be an insecure possession which the British Government might with little cilort at any time make untenable. ' It is not pro bable that he would have self-restraint to refuse such a gl f t if it were offered to him ; but in accept! ITecmitvTor 11 }!- ln reallt V e P i acin S in °ur hands a security foi his own good conduct. “ if these considerations recommend themselves to Lord Cranbrook, it will be possible to give effect to the policy recommended by them at the present juncture But it is not probable that the oppor rumty wdl happen again; and it may very weU be that at a later period the imperious exigeneies of her position towards Russia may f„? C e unon England the necessity of securing at the cost offar greater sacrifices the alliance or ttie neutrality ot leisia. Ihe question, therefore, vhich is sub mitted for Lord Craubrook’s consideration is one of the deepest gravity.” Although Lord Cranbrook took this matter into careful _ consideration, the condition o? affairs in Afghanistan precluded an. immediate reply on the important subject above treated being sent. It consequently lay for a time in abeyance. On the 26th of January, Mr. Thomson addressed the following communication to the Marquis of Salisbury: — I have the honour to inform your Lordship that I received on the 24th instant a telegram from His Excellency the Viceroy of India, inquiring whether, if the war should eventuate in any territorial changes of the Afghan frontier, there was in my opinion any point which might be considered with advantage, with the object of improving the rela tions between England and Persia. His Lordship mentioned that this had been suggested for con sideration in London, and having also expressed a wish for an early reply to his inquiry, I the next day answered him by telegraph that if the other portion of Seistan were ceded to Persia and her claims to Kohuk formally recognized, her obliga tions to Russia for having procured for her the retrocession of Kotur would be neutralized, and our relations here would doubtless be established on a better footing. “ I added that Persia had always complained that the division of Seistan in accordance with Sir E. Goldsmid’s award was a mistake, and that she was the loser by that arrangement, especially as it put into the hands of the Afghans the sluices of the canals by which her territory was irrigated. “ With reference to Kohuk, I said that Persia has since 1874 occupied that territory, but Her Majesty’s Government has never recognized her right to do so. “ In the fear of, at some future period, becoming involved with Afghanistan, Persia has always re fused to sign the revised Mekran arbitral de- cision. ii I ventured further to remark that, though good results would accrue from these concessions, we must also, if we wished to reap their full advantage make up our minds to assume a firm attitude to wards Persia, whenever it was a question of our lawful interests; that when the Persians understood that they had something both to gam and to tear from us, we should, in my opinion, be m a more satisfactorv position, and should be able,^ not on y to have prompt attention paid to our just com plaints, but also to hold, at least, our own agains , j us t as I had finished this telegram Nasoulak Khan, the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, called on me, and by direction of the Shah read me an autograph letter, which His Majesty had ad-dressed to t\e Minister for Foreign Affairs. In this letter His Majesty refused in very arbitrary and peremptory terms to entertain the wish of Her Majesty’s (xovernment for the opening to steam navigation of the Karan river, a request which I have been for some time urging. He further de clared his intention of not acceding to the represen tations which, in obedience to your Lordship’s instructions, I had made, to prevent the employment of Russian officers to drill the Persian cavalry. “ His Majesty then went on to say that the per tinacity with which Her Majesty’s Government urged the opening of the Karan aroused his suspicions; that Persia was not like Afghanistan, hut an indepen dent power; that, if his leave were asked to navigate the river, he refused to give it; that if England intended force, that was another thing, etc. “ In communicating this to the Viceroy of India, I have remarked that His Excellency will judge whether or not the Shah’s action and language ought to affect the correctness of the opinions which I had at His Excellency’s request ventured to ex press in my previous telegram.” On the 9th of February following, the Marquis of Salisbury received a telegram from Mr. Thomson (dated 8th idem) communicating a further opinion as conveyed by him to the Viceroy of India, in reply to a telegram from His Excellency on this subject. He said,— “ Though Russia has lately been using every means to increase her influence here, and that influence has always been essentially detrimental to England, there is nothing sufficiently alarmino* at this moment to necessitate any immediate de cision as to cession of Afghan territory, and I think with Your Excellency that it would be better to allow the position to develop itself. The Persians are not moving, nor do they show any signs of so doing, and any cession made this moment might he attributed to a desire on our part to keep them quiet, and thereby lose its good effect. “ I consider that nothing that we could offer Persia would permanently exclude Russian in fluences opposed to our Asian policy, but the ces sion of Seistan, if accompanied by a resolute atti tude, would bring about such satisfactory relations as would enable us to contend against them. The cession of Herat even would, in my opinion, not only not exclude Russian influence permanently hut prove an additional source of dan o'er. To secure ourselves against Russia, we must absolutely dominate Herat, but the Persians are so untrust worthy, and are so exposed to Russian seduction and coercion, that their presence there would in evitably end in opening the door to Russia. No cession, therefore, should, I think, be made that would put Persia m apposition by which Russia might ultimately benefit, for, though we mi (flit gain a temporary advantage, the Russians would probably secure real profit. Our policy is, more- From Foreign Office, 10th February 1879.5 18 ?™ F&lt;&gt;reigD ° ffice ’ 17th F *ruary over, apt to be fitful, whilst that of B • • From Foreign Office, 28th February 1879. ^ for Foreign Affairs th tlle Minis ^ Majesty’s Government to oTeup^HemfCdCf m the spring, His Highness, oi the 13 th ?n a C bU versation, requested officially to bo informal what were the ultimate intentions 0 f H P r^f- ! *' Government with respect to Herat H He M n JeS i ty 1 for her communication, which he sairf wn^f ! confidential character, referring to Pn! „ J , S deprived Persia nf TTo 4 - v 1 Fogland liavms cause alone C lat te^ww to thS England; he susgeS that tf cord,ah 7 ^ards now arisen to do”C v with that 0 ?

Persia, he said, was too weak to remain without a friend; she had no wish to become a dependent of Russia, but she required assistance from England to enable her to resist Russian schemes of en croachment. “ Malcom Khan told me that he had special authority to speak and negotiate for this purpose, 3627. Band that the Shah was anxious to offer to England an entire preponderance in his councils, and to place the whole of his foreign policy under her guidance if Her Majesty’s Government were ready to give His Majesty on this occasion a pledge ot their good will. « The policy pursued by England, Malcom Jinan continued, was bringing about the annexation of Merv by Russia. This was a measure which Persia could prevent, but to do so she must have the assistance of England. The first and most obvious mode of rendering such assistance was by placing Herat in her hands. With respect to that place, he observed that Persia had much cause to complain. She was in possession of it in 1857. England had gone to war with her to force her to abandon it, and she had done so by a treaty, by which it was surrendered to Afghanistan, on the understanding (which was clearly implied by the words employed) that Afghanistan was to remain independent. This independence, Malcom Khan said, we were now preparing to limit, if not to extinguish, without in the least consulting Persia. Persia naturally felt cold and mistrustful of a Power which treated her in such a manner; but these feelings might be converted into those of entire attachment if we would acknowledge the title of Persia to Herat, and we might demand for that concession whatever con ditions we pleased. “ I stated in reply that I was not familiar with the language of the Treaty of 1857, and could not on the spur of the moment discuss the point which he had raised in respect to it. But I said that Herat was regarded by Indian authorities as a point of great importance, and that they would look with misgivings at the occupation of it by a Power which might not be able entirely to throw off the control of Russia. I asked him what other ways there were, besides the cession of Herat, in which we could strengthen Persia to resist the advance of Russia. “Malcom Khan said, ‘II y a mille mani&amp;res,’ but he only specified one,—the provision of money to enable Persia to obtain more effective armaments. “He dwelt much on the certainty of Russia advancing to Merv, if nothing were done to prevent her, and of the danger to the English position in India which such an advance would involve. He assured me that he had a power over the councils and resolutions of the Shah possessed by none of His Majesty’s Ministers, and that he could ensure the acceptance of any conditions I might propose. He repeated again and again that this was the critical moment, the point from which the policy of Persia must definitely turn either towards Russia or towards England, and that the responsibility which would rest on Her Majesty’s Government, if they allowed it to pass by in mere neglect, would be very great. “ I replied that the considerations which he had laid before me were far too grave to admit of an8 This letter was replied to on the 8th idem * by a letter from Mr. Stanhope, in which it was stated:— “ Sir Julian Pauncefote’s letter f of the 1st instant not having invited any expression of opinion from Lord Cranbrook, His Lordship, in answer, deemed it only necessary to observe that the tone of the Persian Minister’s communication seemed open to comment, and that the measure announced in it would be a direct breach of the Treaty of Paris. “ A telegram embodying the purport of Malcom Khan’s Note, was at the same time addressed to the Viceroy of India, from whom the enclosed replyj has been received. &lt;£ Lord Cranbrook concurs generally in Lord Lytton’s view, and is of opinion that such an answer should be sent to Malcom Khan as will reserve complete freedom of action to Her Majesty’s Government, and will guard them from being supposed to acquiesce in the intended Persian occupation of Afghan territory, or in the assumption which is plainly expressed in the Persian Minister’s Note, that the Shah’s acceptance of General GoMsmid’s arbitral decision is not binding on His Majesty under present circumstances, and that some rectification of the Seistan frontier of Afghanistan in favour of Persia must in any case be made. Lord Cranbrook has in mind the remarks on the latter point contained in your letter of the I4jth January last, but he is of opinion that the decision of Her Majesty s Government in regard to it must, to a great extent, be dependent on the course of events in Afghanistan, and, further, that should any concession ultimately be made to Persia it must be conditional on the conclusion of a satis- iactory understanding with the Shah’s Government in regard to its future relations with that of Great -Britain. A 1 '® follo '' i! i? are the words of the Viceroy’s reply§ to the Secretary of State’s telegram, em bodying the purport of the Persian Minister’s INote, and referred to m the foregoing letter • c' 1 Pc !' sia occu pies Seistan with our permission m face of our accepted award, this will inevitably toTfff 0I : U 'P rofess J ons of good faith and friendship offered tTvoV lf ld -i 1 ? e S 0tlatl0ns on basi s already tercd to Yakub will become extremely difficult for Caoul will hardly yield territory on east and west simultaneously, or surrender cha'rge of foreign relations, if we allow Persian occupation. therefore, unless we are able, in event of Persian invasion, to assure Yakub that, if he accepts our basis he shall not lose Seistan, negotiations will bernpermed and hostilities may be pSon^d “ it ho finally refuses, we are free.

They must venture to point out that the award delivered by Major-General Sir E. Golds- mid in regard to the Seistan boundary was formally and fully accepted on behalf of the Shah by a Note from the Sadr Azim, of the 16th July 1873, and they are not aware of any faets~whMi would bear out the statement made in your Note that the award was f imposed upon Persia under exceptional cir- 4 cumstances.’ 4 4 In the Note of the Sadr Azim, to which I have just allnded, it is stated that His Majesty the Shah counted upon the assurance of Her Majesty’s Go vernment and their influence with the Amir of Afghanistan to secure the Persian territory from the depredations of the Belooch tribes on the Afghan side of the frontier. Her Majesty’s Go vernment, however, have not of recent times received any complaints from the Persian Govern ment of such depredations. 44 The representations which have been received by His Majesty’s legation at Teheran have referred only to the presence on the Afghan side of the frontier of certain disaffected Persian subjects and to the disturbances which might be apprehended if they were not removed. 44 Similarly in Article YI. of the Treaty between Persia and England, signed at Paris, on the 4th March 1857 it is stipulated that, in case of differences arising between the Government of Persia and the countries of Herat and Afghanistan, the Persian Government engage to refer them for adjustment to the friendly offices of the British Government, and not to take up arms unless those friendly offices fail of effect, while the British Government engage in that case to 4 use their best endeavours to com- 4 pose such differences in a manner just and honour- 4 able to Persia.’ 44 No such appeal, however, has on this oc casion been made to Her Majesty’s Government by that of Persia, and I do not understand from the terms of your Note that the complaints which 3627. C10 have on this occasion reached the Persian Govern ment have come from the subjects of His Majesty the Shah, but rather from the inhabitants of districts lying within the frontier assigned to Afghanistan. “ Her Majesty’s Government can understand the inconvenience that may result to Persia from the present unsettled state of Afghanistan, and they trust that this condition of affairs may shortly be terminated, and an opportunity may be given for the proper consideration of any well-founded grievance of which the Persian Government may have to complain. But in the meanwhile they must express their earnest hope that the Persian Government will limit their action in Seistan to the cases provided for in Article VII. of the Treaty of Paris, that they will not undertake any military operations except for the repression and punishment of actual aggression, and that any military force of the Shah which may cross the frontier for the above-mentioned purpose shall retire within its own territory as soon as its object is accomplished.” It would seem, from the following telegram from From Foreign Office, 23rd April 1879. Mr. Thomson, dated 22nd April, that Malcom Khan’s communication was somewhat premature “ On the 7th instant, the Minister for Poreign Affairs informed me that, having received through Governor of Persian Seistan a petition from the Chief of Lash and Jowein, soliciting the occupation of his districts, he had instructed Malcom Khan to communicate with your Lordship, with the object of obtaining the consent of Her Majesty’s Govern ment to this. Malcom had replied, he said, that your Lordship, was not averse to this proposal. His Highness at this interview made no allusion to any disturbances in Seistan or on the frontier, and stated that he had strictly instructed the border authorities that no movement could be authorized without the previous consent of Her Majesty’s Government. After the receipt of your Lordship’s telegram, No. 2 of yesterday, I saw His Highness, and in reply to my question he stated that no disturbances had lately occurred, and he repeated that the frontier authorities could not move any troops into these districts without special authority, and that no such authority had been given. Malcom Khan’s statement conveyed to me in* your Lordship’s Despatch, No. 20 of 19th Pebruary as to his own power over the councils and resolu tions of the Shah may be received with much reservation.” itie matter then dropped for a few months, on account of the settlement of relations between England and Afghanistan; but the Shah revived the queshon, so soon as the aspect of affairs had been a. ered by the massacre of the British mission at Labul on the 3rd of September 1879. Mr. Thom son wrote on the 13th September: * “I have the honour to inform your Lordship that at an interview which I had on the 10th instant with * Mr. Thomson to Lord Salisbury, 13 September 1879. From Foreign Office, 21st October 1879the Minister for Foreign Affairs, he handed me for my perusal, an autograph rescript addressed to him by the Shah, in which His Majesty, doubtless in consequence of information which had reached him. of the altered aspect of affairs in Afghanistan, instructs his Minister to appeal to Her Majesty’s Government to set aside the Seistan arbitration award, and to assign the whole of that territory to Persia. “ I remarked that the Persian Government were- aware of the treaty of peace existing between Afghanistan and England, and that it was not to be supposed that under these circumstances England could deprive Afghanistan of a portion of her territory in order to make it over to Persia. His Highness said that he quite understood that, this would not be possible, but that, in the event of any fresh arrangement being made between England and Afghanistan, the Persian Government hoped that their representations on this subject would receive the favourable consideration of that of Her Majesty.” Her Majesty’s Government having taken under consideration the request of the Shah for the cession “ Her Majesty’s Government have had under consideration the request of His Majesty the Shah for the cession of Seistan. In view of the friend ship happily existing at this moment between the two monarchies they are disposed to entertain it This telegram was supplemented by a despatch bearing the same date,J which more fully set forth the views of Her Majesty’s Government, in the following terms:— “ Her Majesty’s Government have had under their serious consideration the autograph rescript addressed by the Shah to his Foreign Minister, and sent home with your despatch, No. 221, of the 13th ultimo, in which His Excellency is instructed to obtain the assent of this country that the Seistan arbitration award should be set aside, and the whole- of that territory assigned to Persia. &lt;{ You have now been authorized by telegraph to inform His Majesty that, in view of the friendship which at this moment happily exists between the two monarchies, Her Majesty’s Government feel disposed to entertain the proposal favourably, and that their views have accordingly been communi cated to the Viceroy of India for consideration m relation to any future arrangements which may have to be made consequent upon the recent events * 22nd October 1879. of Seistan, sent the following telegram* to Her From Foreign Office, 22nd October Majestv’s Minister at Teheran :— 1879. ^ , n 4. 1879. t Telegram to Viceroy, dated 27th October favourably, and have communicated j* their views to the Viceroy of India.” § From Foreign Office, 22nd October the subject oi ncrat, me ~ - 1879. Communicated to the Viceroy, 28th Octo-12 panded in tlie following despatch* (22nd October) addressed to Mr. Thomson:— “ The more recent occurrences at Cabul, subse quent to the signature of the treaty of Gundamak, terminating in the massacre of Sir L. Cavagnari’s special mission, and the capture of the city by the English troops under General Roberts, has again raised, the question of the disposition of Herat, and is at this juncture engaging the serious attention of Her Majesty’s Government. “ It appears to them that the abdication of Yakoub Khan, and other circumstances, may render it impossible to unite the whole territory hitherto held under the sway of the Ameer under one head, and that, in any future combination for the settle ment of the country, it may be more prudent to entrust Herat to the Shah of Persia than to leave it to the chance guardianship of some petty Chief who may be accessible to the influence of Russian bribes. The control which could be exercised by this country over Persia would probably be greater than any Her Majesty’s Government could have over such a Chief. “ But before any decision can be taken upon this, it will be necessary to know upon what conditions Persia would be disposed to accept so important a trust. “ On their side, Her Majesty’s Government would have to insist upon the right of occupation by British troops as a precautionary measure in case of danger of the place falling into wrong hands, and also a right to have a certain number of British Officers permanently employed in the garrison, in order to ensure that every precaution shall be taken to ensure its effective defence. “ It might also be expedient, at the same time, to secure the navigation of the Karun river, and some amendment of the commercial relations between Persia and this country. “ I have, therefore, sent you instructions this evening, by telegraph, to sound the Persian Minister for Poreign Affairs cautiously upon this subject, taking for your basis the overtures which were made to me early in the year by Malcom Khan, and which were communicated to you in my despatch, No. 35, Secret, of 31st of March. “ When you have done this, I should wish you to communicate the result to me, also by telegraph, giving me, at the same time, a resume of your own views with regard to the question of policy involved in the cession of Herat to Persia.” Mr. Thomson replied on the 28th October :— . . . “I have the honour to state that I con sider that, provided safety be ensured, the transfer of Herat to Persia would be an expedient measure. “ Our nominee would be dependent on us for his position and tenure of office. We could dictate * From Foreign Office, 29th October 1879. From Foreign Office, 29th October 1879.our own terms to him at the outset, the fulfilment of which we could, from our position at Candahar exact. We should thus have indirect control over the country, and retain liberty of action as to any future arrangements which the possible occupation of Merv by Russia might necessitate; but the prospect of gaining the goodwill of Persia would, if unattended by danger to ourselves, justify some sacrifice. To cede Herat, however, to Persia per manently and absolutely would, in my opinion, be a hazardous measure. Persia, having obtained all that we could give, would feel no gratitude, and we should have lost our hold upon her; she would then be more open to Russian advances, in a better position to serve Russia, and her services would be worth a higher price. Russia would, moreover, he entitled, under treaty, to place agents at Herat, if transferred permanently to Persia, which would in itself make a hot-bed of Russian intrigue. These objections would be removed by effecting a tem porary arrangement, and by making the continued occupation of Herat by Persia entirely dependent on her faithful fulfilment of her engagements ; and in sounding the Minister for Poreign Affairs, I have confined myself to the contemplation of that eventuality. “ The points to which I have alluded in my con versations are:— “ 1. The provisional transfer of Herat to Persian guardianship, her occupation to continue only so long as she had the confid%rce of Her Majesty’s Government. “ 2. A British right of military occupation, should there be danger of its falling into wrong hands. “ 3. England to decide what garrison should be maintained. “ 4. British Officers to be employed to instruct the garrison, and superintend defensive arrangements. « 5. Persia not to allow any foreign agent or travellers, excepting English, to reside at “6. Persia to take steps, with the moral support of Her Majesty’s Government, to prevent the occupation of Merv by Russia. “ 7. Persia to do all sbe possibly can to check the advance of Russia in the Turcoman country; to object strenuously to the passage of Russian troops through any territory belonging to, or claimed by, her; and to afford no assistance to any military expedition advancing eastward from the “8.

The construction of a wagon road from Bushire to Teheran, and from. Ispahan to Shuster, in connection with free steam navigation on the Karim; and finally, that in the event of any of the above conditions being unfulfilled, of its being found that the continued occupation of Herat by Persia was incompatible with the security of our Indian frontier, or of its being deemed requisite, in consequence of the possible occupation, of Merv by Itussia, that the arrangement should cease, it should be set aside, and Persia would then revert to her stipulations with England under the Treaty of 1857. My conversations with the Minister for Foreign Affairs have had no official character, and he does not suppose that I am speaking about Herat under instructions from your Lordship. I am to see His Highness again, I believe, but it may take some days before I can ascertain the definite views of the Shah on the subject.” On the 29th October Mr. Thomson sent a further telegram* on this point to the Marquis of Salisbury. He said:— &lt;f I have had an interview of over three hours with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. His Highness informed me that the Shah accepted the eight numbered conditions in my telegram of yesterday ; the others, he said, he had not yet referred to His Majesty. He, however, re-discussed the whole subject, proposing in No. 1 to insert that the temporary occupation should be 4 with a view 3 to its being ultimately confirmed permanently, when the con fidence of Her Majesty’s Government should have been acquired. He objected strenuously to binding the Persian Government to c be guided ’ by our advice, but agreed to consult and advise on im portant questions. He further objected to its being specified that, in the event of the Persians bavin 0 * to withdraw from Herat, they should revert to their 1857 treaty engagements. This objection was pro- bably based on the supposition that this arrange ment would definitely supersede the old treaty arrangements.

Cranbrook observes, however, that by the fast Article of the Separate Compact, relative to commerce, &amp;c., concluded between Russia and Rersia in accordance with Article X. of the Treaty ot i urkomanchai between those Powers, it is pro- Moed not only that Russian subjects shall ‘he ‘ allowed^ to trade throughout the whole kingdom o eisia, but also that they shall be permitted P™ cee( ^ States adjoining the said king- cc In the face of this provision it seems to His Lordship to be very doubtful whether, without risk of grave complications with Russia, it would he possible lor the Persian Government to exclude Russian travellers from Herat, and whether, there fore, that city could be secured from becoming a centre of intrigue by the adoption of the course suggested by Mr. Thomson. “ In Lord Cranbrook’s opinion this point should receive very careful attention before any decision is arrived at on the general question. His Lordship further considers that, in the event of an arrangement with Persia in regard to Herat being eventually concluded, the right of the British Government to station a Resident there should be distinctly stipulated. “ I am directed to add that Lord Cranbrook has requested the Viceroy of India confidentially to express his views on the question, and that they will be communicated in due course for the infor mation of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs.” Mr. Thomson had previously,* 26th October 1879, intimated the Shah’s intention to open the Karun river to foreign trade and navigation in the event of his request for the cession of Seistan being com plied with. On the 27th of October,f the Marquis of Salisbury addressed a further despatch to Mr. Thomson, giving in full an account of a conversation with Malcom Khan, the substance of which was sent in a telegram, of the same date. The despatch ran as follows :—. “ The Persian Minister called upon me to-day, and asked, he said, by special orders from the Shah, whether it was the intention of Her Majesty’s Government to annex the whole of Afghanistan, and especially Herat, or whether they purposed' to place that town in the hands of an independent Chief. I told Malcom Khan, in reply, that England did not contemplate any extensive annexations in that quarter, and that, at any rate, it was highly improbable that we should annex Herat. I added, that the information which had been received from General Sir F. Roberts was not yet suflicieiitly complete to enable Her Majesty’s Government to form any definitive conclusions. The conversation then turned upon the proposals with respect to16 Herat which he had made to me in the spring, and with which you are already acquainted. “ I said that the suggestions he had then made had been carefully considered by the Cabinet. Our relations, however, at that time with Yakoub Khan had offered an insuperable obstacle to any further negotiations upon the subject with the Persian Government. It was felt, moreover, that there would be no guarantee that the officer who might be placed by the Shah in command of Herat would be faithful to his charge in the face of the temptations with which it was too probable he might be confronted. I casually remarked that a remedy to this danger might perhaps be found in the permanent establishment of a certain number of British Officers in the garrison. This sugges tion appeared to be favourably viewed by Malcom Khan, who continued the discussion upon this point somewhat eagerly. I said, however, that the views of the Government of India had not yet been fully expressed upon this subject, and that for the moment, therefore, the matter could not be con veniently pursued further. “ Before leaving, Malcom Khan expressed his earnest hope that any negotiations upon the sub ject might be carried on in London in preference to Teheran “It appears likely that an understanding may be arrived at with regard to the cession of Seistan to Persia, and the facilities for opening up the navigation of the Karun; it might be desirable that a short Convention should be drafted, the pre cise terms of which you should telegraph to me and to the Viceroy of India before anything is signed.” Mr. Thomson accordingly drafted the text of a Convention with Persia, which he communicated to Lord Salisbury in a telegram dated 30th October.* * From Foreign Office, 31st October 1879 It ran as follows :— “ Article I. Whereas, according to the arbitral decision of the British Commissioners for the de limitation of boundary between Persia and Afghan istan^ delivered on the 19th August 1872, a portion of Seistan was allotted to Persia,and the remainder to Afghanistan, Her Majesty’s Government now agree that the whole of that portion of Seistan which then became the property of Afghanistan shail be transferred to Persia, and will, in future, be considered to form a part of the dominions of His Majesty the Shah. “ Article II. The Persian Government, in order to mark their sense of obligation for the above con cession, hereby agree to open the Karun river to the commerce of all nations, and to grant permission that, from the date of the signature of this Con vention, mercantile ships of all nations, whether steamers or sailing vessels, may freely navigate the £ aul Karun river for purposes of commerce. “ Article III. The present Convention shall be«7 * Dated 28th October 1879. f Telegram, 29th October. X Telegram, 1st November. § Telegram, dated 4th November.

Give me your personal opinion on subject, m view of your Despatch, 2nd July 1877. Q.ues- tion perfectly open.” The Viceroyf inquired whether the proposed en gagement was to include Seistan as well as Herat, and having been answeredj in the negative, His Excellency replied in the following telegram, dated 3rd November :— “ Secret and personal. Your personal telegram 1st November. Seistan. I deprecate any project for dealing piecemeal with territorial redistribution of Afghanistan. My reasons, are, first, all such questions are necessarily depending on circum stances, and must be treated collectively. Persian possession of Seistan may affect Herat question, and her possession of Herat would certainly affect Seistan and Afghan Turkestan. “ Secondly, I consider settlement of our perma nent position in Eastern Afghanistan and Kandahar should precede, not follow, arrangements for Western Afghanistan, and that the former question governs the latter. “ Thirdly, whilst recognizing probable advantage of future arrangements to increase influence in Persia and strengthen her against Bmssia, about which I will telegraph fully in a few days, I much fear strengthening Persia with Afghanistan terri tory or forts, now virtually at our disposal, without previous practical guarantees for control over her policy, or until other possible arrangements from Afghan side have been examined and rejected, “ I have telegraphed to Thomson my view of his draft convention, communicated by Foreign Office instructions.” In reference to the above, the Secretary of State telegraphed§ to His Excellency as follows : “ Telegraph as soon as possible your views as to future arrangement to increase influence m Persia and strengthen her against Bussia. “ Time is very important.” Subsequently the Viceroy sent the following tele gram |j to the Secretary of State, in reference to his telegram of 28th October : — “ Herat and Seistan. Assuming Parliament does 3627.

I at the same time gave His Excellency a resume of that portion of my telegram, No. 57, bearing exclusively on the possible transfer of Herat to Persia. “ I yesterday received the following telegram from His Excellency :— Your draft convention about Seiotan.

The right of -eisia, indeed, to grant any such exclusive privilege would doubtless be contested by other foreign lowers under the most favoured nation ” clause. In t lie absence of exact geographical know ledge, I confined myself in my draft convention to what had been recognized by us as Seistan territory. Seistan, as understood by the Minister for Foreign Affairs comprises that tract formerly under the hereditary chiefship of Taj Mahomed’s family, which, from his description, 'does not extend far up the Helmund, but, should any cession be made, I quite agree with your Excellency that the frontier cannot be too closely defined. ‘ c ■ W ith reference to concluding clause of your Excellency’s telegram, I would mention that neither the Herat nor the Seistan question was raised by me, and that the opinions which I have expressed on these subjects were offered under instructions from the Eoreign Office.’ ” On November 6th,* Mr. Thomson telegraphed to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the fol lowing account of a further conversation which he had held with the Persian Foreign Minister on the subject of the conditional occupation of Herat. He said:— “ His Highness, whilst holding to his previous acquiescence, endeavoured, as was natural, to modify certain points, especially that abrogating, at the option of Her Majesty’s Government, the arrangement, in the event of the occupation of Merv by Prussia. I maintained this point, how ever, as I consider it of great importance, bringing about as it will an identity of interests, making it as much Persia’s object as ours to keep Russia out of Merv. He then desisted from pressing this and the other points. “I hope shortly to obtain a statement of their views in writing.” In continuation of the above, a further telegram was received from Mr. Thomson on the 7th No vember as follow’s :—f “ The Minister for Foreign Affairs showed me this morning a paper, autographically accepted by the Shah, in which all the conditions enumerated in my telegrams, Nos. 57 and 58,J w r ere embodied.r i f 20 He will send to me an officially authenticated copy of this paper this afternoon or tb-morrow. “ Still further conditions, if thought desirable, might, I think, possibly be obtained/’ this the telegram £ 1 were ollowing day The papers mentioned in received by Mr. Thomson on (November 8th).* On the 11th November the Secretary of State addressed the Viceroy by telegraph, in the follow ing terms “Foreign Office feels that events make decision as to Persian proposals important. Danger of Persia drawing off to Bmssia. We know little of Herat and its Government, or inclinations of the people. Can you let us have Stewart’s and St. John’s opinions by telegram ? “ Foreign Office has sent following telegram to Thomson, which shows urgency of the case:— “‘The proposals which you have made to the Persian Government, and which have been accepted by them, have been considered by the Cabinet. “ ‘ The Cabinet entertain very friendly sentiments to the Shah, and are not indisposed to reconsider that clause of the Treaty of 1857 which concerns Herat. But they do not possess in sufficient detail the procedure which the Shah contemplates fol lowing. Supposing that the British Government were willing to waive the treaty on the conditions agreed to by the Shah, how would he propose to deal with Herat ? Does he propose immediately to occupy it by Persian troops, and, if so, what proba bility is there of his being able to occupy it without resistance ? ’ ” To this telegram the Viceroy replied* thus :— “ Secret. Yours 11th. Opinions of Stewart and St. John in accompanying telegrams. “ From Stewart. Begins. Your telegram, 12th. It may be well to stipulate that under given cir cumstances Herat will be liable to be resumed, but I think that Persia should not be expected to do more to retard Russian advance on Merv than refuse direct or indirect assistance. It would be a mistake to spend more money on defences of Herat, as city cannot be held against modern artillery. “ Unless England is prepared to make the seizure of Merv a cause of war, I do not see how we can legitimately prevent her going there eventually. It is only a question of organization and money. The simplest way of meeting these difficulties is to come to an understanding with Russia, telling her the precise points to which we mean our influence to extend; but no advantage is to be gained by claiming more than we know we can hold in case of need. “ With Persia as our neighbour in Herat, the Gandahar provinces would be more easy to manage than if held by a weak semi-independent Chief.

The opening ol Shuster route and construc tion of a road from Bushire would increase material piosperity of south, which is English in sympathy, and tend to confirm stability of relations while enabling us to exert increased pressure on Court of Teheran through Gulf, “I do not think that occupation of Herat by Persia would necessitate annexation of Candahar, or would materially alter position here, provided pure Afghan districts of Eurrah and Lash Jowaiu were excluded.

Proposed transfer will greatly increase power and position of Persia, and Her Majesty’s Government will decide whether practicable gua rantees are obtainable from Persia for fulfilment of of precautionary stipulations suggested, but in default of such guarantees we should regard Persian acquisition with distrust, unless accompanied by satisfactory understanding with Russia. 44 We still anticipate embarrassment from dis memberment of Afghanistan before our Indian 3627. Frelations with other parts, especially Candahar, are near settlement. Precise information of extent ot territorial cession involved with Herat and Scxstan very desirable.” In the meanwhile, Malcom Khan had, on the 10th November, addressed a Note to the Marquis ot Salisbury, giving, in the following terms the con tents of a telegraphic despatch, which he had received from the Persian Minister for foreign Affairs :—* . “ Toutes ces propositions dures que vous connaissez nous les avons arretees aujourd’hni avee le Mmistre Anglais, et nous leur avons donne notre assentiment.

Je lui ai fait savoir aussi combien vous nous pressez de nous mettre d’accord avee lui et de finir cette affaire telle qu’il le desire.

Le seul point sur lequel je crois devoir insister encore, c’est que si Ton vent reussir on ne doit pas perdre une seule minute.” On the 11th of November, the Marquis of Salis bury addressed two telegramst to Mr. Thomson, the substance of which was more fully given in the two following despatches which bore the same date; X the first ran as follows :— “ Her Majesty’s Government have had under their consideration the proposals which you have made to the Persian Government regarding the transfer of Herat to the Shah, and which that Government has expressed a willingness to accept. Entertaining as they do the most friendly senti ments towards His Majesty the Shah. Her Majesty’s Ministers are not indisposed to re-con- sider Article VI. of the treaty between Great Britain and Persia of the 4th of March 1857 which concerns Herat; but before going any further, it is necessary that they should be informed in greater detail as to the mode of procedure contemplated by the Shah. Per instance, supposing they should be willing to waive the Treaty of 1857 on the condi tions which have been accepted by the Shah, they would be glad to learn in what manner His Majesty24 On the following flay (November 14th)* Lord Salisbury addressed a telegram to Mr. Thomson with reference to this Memorandum. This telegram was supplemented by a letterf bearing the same date, to the following effect: — “ Malcom Khan came yesterday to the Foreign Office to urge that some decision should be taken without delay by Her Majesty’s Government upon the proposals made by the Persian Government with a view to facilitate the proposed transfer of Herat to the custody of the Shah, of which pro posals you have sent home a summary by telegraph. He left with me a memorandum of telegraphic communication which he had received to that effect from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and of which a copy is enclosed herewith for your information. “ I informed him that the matter had been laid before the Queen and the Cabinet, who did not look unfavourably upon the policy which had been pro posed on the part of his Government; but it was a rule, I said, from which the Queen’s Government rarely, if ever, departed, that Oriental questions of this gravity should not be decided by them before they had the opportunity of hearing and considering the views of the Viceroy of India. “ The despatch containing them was now on its road to England. “ Malcom Khan appeared to be satisfied with the reply I had given him.” .... On the same dayj Mr. Thomson telegraphed to to the Marquis of Salisbury as follows :— “ In a further conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday. His Highness authorized me to state that the Persian Government would be prepared to modify or adapt, so as to meet the views of Her Majesty’s Government, the terms of the proposals already accepted respecting Herat. They would, for instance, engage, in the event of Russia occupying Merv, to ‘ withdraw ’ from Herat, and to revert to the stipulations of the Treaty of 1857. He added that they would also be prepared to come to terms on any additional conditions which Her Majesty’s Government might think indispen sable^ I gather from His Highness’s conversation that, in the event of the transfer being made, Persia would be ready to occupy Herat with her own troops, and that lie did not anticipate that there would be serious, if any resistance.” . In a further telegram, dated the 17th November.. Mr. Thomson informed the Marquis of Salisbury of the following telegrams which had passed between the Viceroy and himself :—§ From the Viceroy.—“ In any arrangement about Herat ^ I attach great importance to Persian co operation in railway from Candahar to Herat, which is ^ the ouly practical guarantee for Persian good laith. Persian offer to guarantee Resht transport railway, and her rejection of this condition, would therefore imply untrustworthiness.” * From Foreign Office, 15th November. f From Foreign Office, 20th November. 4 f From Foreign Office, 14th November. § From Foreign Office, 17th November.* In a subsequent telegram (dated 26th November), Mr. Thomson reports that the Viceroy has telegraphed to him as follows :— “ I think Persia should be required to guarantee interest on capital cost, not ex ceeding 1,000,000/., of so much of the pro jected railway as travels territory ceded to Persia.” Mr. Thomson replied“ The opinion I had the honour to express in my telegram of 30th ultimo, boro reference specially to your Excellency’s inquiry as to whether Persia would contribute towards cost of railway from. Candahar to Herat, and was based upon the fact that she is without money available to subscribe any sum appreciable in such an under taking. She might, however, possibly be brought to guarantee a portion of the line, though, in all money matters, poverty and avarice render her very intractable. If your Excellency could favour me with an idea* of the form and extent of the guarantee desired, I might be preparing the ground. ‘ ‘ The bond fide character of the Kesht railway concession appears doubtful. The Erench con- cessionnaires have four months left to conclude the survey, form a Company, and provide funds; and the Minister for Eoreign Affairs has lately informed me that if, as he expects and as appears likely, this is not done within the time specified, he would cancel the contract at once.” f From Foreign Office, 22nd November. On the 21st November a telegram*|’ was received by the Marquis of Salisbury from Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at St. Petersburg, relative to our negotiations with Persia. He said:— “ I hear from trustworthy source that secret intelligence has reached the Russian War Office from London that Her Majesty’s Government have concluded secret arrangements with Persia, fcy which latter Power is to he placed by England in. possession of Herat, to govern it under British influence. “ This has caused much excitement at War Office, but no decision will be come to until return of Emperor.” Consequent on this intelligence, Lord Cranbrook f Telegram to Viceroy, 25th November. telegraphed^ to the Viceroy on 25th November, thus:— “ Persian negotiations are becoming known at St. Petersburg. The matter, therefore, presses for a very early settlement. If we let the matter drift now, Persia may be against and not with ns. Let me know your opinion on the following proposal, viz.,—To waive, not cancel, the Treaty of 1857, and allow Persia to occupy and administer the city of Herat.

I thin that in any future permanent cession ol territory boundary should be demarcated by India, ant Persia required to guarantee interest on capital cost of that portion of railway passing through tei i itoi \ ceded to her.” The Marquis of Salisbury had at the same time telegraphed! to Mr. Thomson to inquire whether he had &lt;( any grounds for thinking Russians aie &lt;e working at Teheran against our Herat proposals, J to which he received the following reply: § “ From a long conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning, I am of opinion that the Russians have as yet taken no steps to thwart the Herat proposals. He assured me earnestly that no communications of any sort had passed between Persia and Russia on the subject of Herat. He said that, in explanation of my frequent interviews with him, he had told the Russian Minister that he had been in communication with me, and in London, as to the future of Afghanistan, the only result of which had been a declaration from both quarters that nothing had yet been decided by Her Majesty’s Government as to what should be done with that country. He further said that, in view of the possible conclusion of the arrangement, he had already, by order of the Shah, stated to the Russian Minister that His Majesty considered Merv as his territory, and that he therefore now declared that, if Russia made any movement upon that place, Persia would not only protest, but do all in her power to prevent it. “ The Russian Minister had disclaimed any intention on the part of the Government to go to Merv, but, that being a personal opinion, he said he would telegraph the Shah’s communication to his Government, and communicate the reply. His Excellency seemed surprised when I told him that the proposal had been divulged. He said there were only three Persians here who knew about them,—the Shah, himself, and his confidential secretary.” On 3rd December, the Marquis of Salisbury ad dressed the following telegram, |j No. 27, to Mr. Thomson:— “ The Cabinet are favourable to the principle of permitting Shah to occupy city of Herat, but a * Telegram from Viceroy, 27tli November. f Telegram to vember.

With reference to your Lordship’s tele gram, No. 27, Persia, once in nossession of Herat would probably make a difficulty about terms to which she would not object previously; and I would venture to suggest that, while leaving the definitive agreement for the final settlement of Afghanistan, I should, before Persia is authorized to occupy Herat, obtain from the Minister for Foreign Affairs a formal preliminary document, signed by him under the Shah’s authority, in which should be set forth all the terms already agreed upon, with any others that Her Majesty’s Govern ment may now desire to add.” The following telegrams then passed between Lord Cranbrook and the Viceroy of India:— “From Viceroy, 22nd December 1879. “ Secret.

To this end it therefore discusses the pros and cons of ceding Herat, Seistan [Sīstān], or other Afghan territory to Persia.A narrative (from 14 January 1879 to 1 January 1880) of these diplomatic exchanges is outlined through extracts from correspondence (largely telegrams), and through recollections of conversations, between British and Persian officials. This then develops into more detailed proposals on the terms by which the British might be willing to cede, and the Persians willing to accept, Herat. Parts of the narrative are in French; presumably the original conversation/correspondence was in this language.The memorandum is signed by Owen Tudor Burne of the India Office.This narrative is continued in IOR/L/PS/18/C29/2.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Minister to the UK</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Minister for Foreign Affairs</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Shah of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Herāt</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Seistan</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000067#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
