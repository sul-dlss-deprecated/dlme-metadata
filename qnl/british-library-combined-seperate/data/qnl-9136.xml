(cost, insurance, and freight) value of goods imported by them into Bahrain. The issue arose from the company's contention that the cost of air freight was in most cases out of all proportion to the value of the goods. The papers show that there was initial resistance to the proposal from the Director of Customs and Port Officer, Bahrain, because Imperial Airways had not up to that point paid rent or landing fees for the use of Bahrain Aerodrome. However, agreement was reached in 1934 by the British authorities and the Government of Bahrain that the state should thereafter take into account only one-third of the cost of air freight in the assessment of customs duty on the value of imports.The abbreviation in the file title appears to stand for 'Question'.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Customs and Port Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Air freight</topic></subject><subject><topic>Customs duty</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000166#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000166#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000166#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
