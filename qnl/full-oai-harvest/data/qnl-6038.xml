The companies involved are: the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC); the Shell Transport Company (STC, also referred to as the Anglo-Saxon Oil Company), led by chief negotiator John Steven Cowans; the Standard Oil Company of New York (SOC). The correspondence covers: Cowans’s trip to Mesopotamia on behalf of STC; reports of SOC geologists to Mesopotamia; the British Government’s decision that all oil exploration and efforts at obtaining concessions in Mesopotamia should be stopped while the country remains under military administration; the retention of STC experts for oil exploration for military purposes; APOC exploration in the Pasht-i-Kuh region of Persia, and the company’s negotiations with the local Vali (or Wali), rather than the Persian Government; the refusal by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to authorise visas to British SOC representatives wishing to travel to Mesopotamia; suspicions amongst British Government officials that SOC were supporting and financing anti-British sentiment in Mesopotamia; the withdrawal of oil representatives and geologists in Mesopotamia from August 1920, in response to the social unrest and anti-British sentiment spreading across the country (the 1920 Iraqi revolt).The volume’s principal correspondents are: the Civil Commissioner in Baghdad, Arnold Talbot Wilson; Foreign Office officials; India Office officials.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Mobil</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Iraqi Revolt (1920)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Civil Commissioner, Mesopotamia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Dutch Shell, oil company</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Mesopotamia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Visas</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military occupation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Resources exploration</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Iran</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Iraq</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001c3#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001c3#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001c3#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001c3#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
