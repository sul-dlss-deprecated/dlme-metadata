Political and Secret Department, India Office, 1st January 1888.[Thig Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [February 27.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [ 9415 ] No. 1 . Sir A. Hirtzel to Mr. Parker.—(Received February 27.) My dear Parker, India Office, February 26, 1913. BY Lord Crewe’s instructions I enclose a statement of a possible basis of compromise as regards Koweit. His Lordship hopes that it will not be used except in case of real necessity, since the sheikh will certainly regard it with suspicion, and will (Cox anticipates) already be greatly disappointed by the loss of Um Kasr, Safwan, and Musallamiya, to say nothing of Anta’a. As to this last, Lord Crewe suggests without pressing it—that if opportunity offers for obtaining a rectification of the southern limit so as to include Anta’a (as shown in green on the map enclosed) it should be taken. I enclose some extracts from an earlier report of Knox’s which show the strength of the sheikh’s claims. It should in any case be pointed out to Hakki that all our claims are based, not on the sheikh’s unsupported statements, but on the evidence collected during the last five years by our own officers, who have personally examined the whole frontier. As regards the Turkish request for a right of way for their troops, Lord Crewe is at a loss to understand why they should want it, seeing that they apparently have easier means of access to Central Arabia (either by way of the Hedjaz, or from the Persian Gulf via Ojeir and Hofuf, where they already have garrisons). He would, therefore, be disposed to refuse, unless it is strongly pressed for. If conceded it should be guarded by a strong proviso that no posts or garrisons are to be established along the line of march or elsewhere. You will have noticed that the Government of India ask that if the compromise is adopted they may have time and opportunity to explain the nature of it to the sheikh before news of it can reach him from Turkish sources. Lord Crewe attaches importance to this. Yours, &amp;c. A. HIRTZEL. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Statement. THE limits of Koweit and of the tribes subordinate to the sheikh are as defined in annex 4 to the British note of the 18th July, 1912. That is to say:— 2. From the coast at the mouth of the Khor-es-Zubair the line proceeds in a north-westerly direction up to and past the walls of the port at Safwan to Jebel Sanam and the Ar Ratq ridge. From the latter point it runs in a south-westerly direction along the Batin to, and including, the wells of Hafar, whence it turns to the south-east between the districts of Summan and Dabanah, till it reaches the route from Wabrah to Riyadh. From that point it runs north-east to the Na’airiyah till at the north-west corner of Radaif, and thence to the coast at Jebel Manifah. 3. The islands included in the limits of Koweit are those mentioned in the annex above referred to. 4. Within the limits specified a circle shall be drawn with Koweit town as its centre and a radius of approximately 60 English miles, including Warba Island and the mid-channel of the Khor Abdullah to the north, Qrain Hill to the south, and Kubbar Island to the south-east. Within the territory thus circumscribed the complete autonomy of the Sheikh of Koweit shall be guaranteed, as defined in the British note of the 29th July, 1911. 5. Outside this circle and within the wider limits described in paragraph 1, the existing status quo shall be maintained, i.e., the sheikh shall continue to levy titles, [2808 dd~l]2 and there shall be no direct Turkish administration, and no Turkish garrisons ; and further, the Turkish Government shall agree to take no action, military or other,' within those limits without previous arrangement with us. 6. Provided that there shall be a right of way for the passage of Turkish troops by the recognised caravan routes across Koweit limits in the direction of Nejd, without, however, the right of establishing posts and garrisons as above mentioned. Enclosure 2 in Xo. 1. Antaa. Extract of letter from Major S. G. Knox, Political Agent, Koweit, dated the 23rd May, 1908. IT does not appear, so far as my information goes, that Anta’a is in any shape or form a portion oi the Walayat of Bussorah. It was a halting place thirty-five years ago for the Turkish expeditionary force that took A1 Alisa and, since then, only one Turkish official has ever visited it, and he formed the solitary Turk in a raiding party of fhe Ajman tribe on^the Umtair. Che inhabitants declare themselves to be subjects of Sheikh Mubarak-as-Subah, and this is supported by the statement of the sheikh, but it would seem that the de facto suzerain at present is Muhammad-bin-Hithlain, Sheikh of the Ajman, who was imprisoned last year by Sheikh Mubarak. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Extracts from Major Knox's Report. ■ THI E. P ', li , ti ^ 1 was unfortunately bound by his own voluntary undertaking given to oiieikh Mubarak that he would not proceed further south than Anta’a villages, and so nothing better than a short excursion to the hill of Midr a, which permitted of the return in one day, could be attempted, but the Wadi-al-Amya promises to repay further examination. It does not appear that the lurk has ever established any effective occupation there, and to elicit this fact alone has amply repaid the political agent for his journey. • t? 6 A n t a a maintained, without leading questions, that their relations with Koweit were of the most friendly and binding nature, and that they considered the Sheikh of Koweit as their suzerain rather than the Amirs of Riadh or the Turk at El Ahsa. Sheikh Mubarak looks upon Anta’a as within the Koweit boundaries, and the fact i th ® Welc ? me rec f ved h 7 the Political agent, and the possibility of his travelling the lot) miles to that point without the slightest molestation of any kind, lends support to the view, and enables one to form an estimate of the hold that the Koweit Sheikh has obtained over the surrounding country. I oreign visitors have, up to date, been only Turkish. The first was one A1 Eakhri, who had with him soldiers in the time of Ibrahim Kasha, who took Addir lya, probably an Egyptian. Then came a Turkish commandant with soldiers about thirty-five years ago PI at the time of the Turks’ entry into El ’Ahsa. After this visit came another, Brahim rassa, unaccompanied by soldiers this time, and apparently raiding with the famous Ajman chief, Raikan, on the Umtair. Phis gentleman is said to have formed a pioject for building a fort here for the Turkish Government, but it came to nothino-. Apparently, the people of Anta’a do not pay tribute to anybody except the akhawat to the Bedouins, neither to Bin S’ud, nor to Bin Subah, nor to the Turks. tv a- s rights are one-tenth of produce of village, but no other rights whatever. Uimcult cases are brought to Koweit for shara’ settlement.3 Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Extract of letter from Captain W. H. J. Shake spear, Political Agent, dated Koweit, the 23rd March, 1910. ACCORDING to Bedouin information, it would seem that my route ran for some days along what is recognised as the boundary of Sheikh Mubarak’s territory. It may be of interest to note that this territory would be included by a line joining Jasirat-al-Amayir (or Jinna ?) on the coast with Anta’a, thence to As Safa, A1 Hafar, following A1 Batin to Ar Ratk, whence east-south-east to the Khor-um-Kasr to just south of that fort, and the sea on the east. Some doubt seemed to exist as to whether Warba and Bubiyan Islands could be included, but Falaikha certainly is. Enclosure 5 in No. 1. Extract from Captain Shakespear’s Diary, dated the 25th February, 1910. MARCHED at 8'25 and struck a bit south-west to make the high road between Jahara and Safwan, which runs almost perfectly straight between the two places, and not as shown on the map. Were sniped at for some time by Thukara, who refused to be convinced by the waving of cloaks that we were peaceable travellers. Finally, had to go and threaten them with Mubarak’s wrath before they would desist. Captain G. B. Brucks, 1829.—“ From Grane to Khore-el-Kuffagee along the Arabian coast the authority of the Sheikh of Grane is partially acknowledged by the Bedouin tribe, who are mostly of the A1 Ali, and a branch of the Beni Kalid, and some wandering parties of other tribes; also some few straggling camps of the Montifie tribe, who come this way at certain seasons.” (Bombay Selections, XXIV, 576.) “ Khore-el-Kuffagee Here ends the authority of the Sheikh of Grane, and that of the Sheikh of Katif begins.” (lb., page 574.)</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00026c_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/D85</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00026c</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/D85</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Asia.
