(a) A memorandum giving a description of Fateh Ullah Khan’s Zindivah Bequest is enclosed. (6) The information asked for will be found in the statement attached. Annuity of Fatehuilah Khan, otherwise known as Zandiyah Bequest. In the year 1822, while on a visit to India, a Persian prince named Fatehuilah Khan, son of Lutf Ali Khan, expressed to the Supreme Government a wish to deposit a certain sum in the Treasury, his object being to provide against the possible sequestration or extortion of a portion, at all events, of his fortune in the event of his falling into disfavour in his own country. The Supreme Government were disposed to meet his wishes, and eventually, on January 24, 1824, he paid a sum of Its. 40,OIK) into the Treasury at Bombay, assigning the amount unconditionally to the Honourable East India Company. In return the Company undertook, in a document of which a translation is annexed to this memorandum, to pay the sum of Rs. 2,400 yearly, being interest at 6 per cent., to Fatehuilah Khan during his life-time, to his mother and sister after his decease, and, on the death of these, to the “ Mujtahid of all the priests at the ‘ sacred tomb ’ (i.e., Karbala), for the use and benefit of poor pilgrims and the indigent dwellers about the hallowed region ”. Translation of a paper presented in the name of the Honourable the Governor in Council at Bombay to His Highness Prince Fatehuilah Khan on the 24th day of January, 1824, by way of receipt for certain monies delivered by His Highness into the Honourable Company's Treasury. This writing is to certify that an agreement has been made on the part of the Honourable Company’s Government to pay yearly, and so long as their authority shall last, the sum of Rs. 2,400 Bombay rupees to His Highness the Most Noble and illustrious Prince Fatehuilah Khan, etc., etc., and whereas this illustrious Prince is without progeny and the number of his heirs is confined to two, namely, his mother and his sister, the property and disposed of the above-mentioned yearlv sum is hereby secured to him during his life time, with reversion after him to his mother and sister'; and on their deaths to the Mujtahid of all the Priests residing at the sacred tomb to be employed by him for the use and benefit of poor pilgrims, and the indigent dwellers about that hallowed region. The above is written by way of document authorizing all the Agents of the Honourable Company residing in Persia, whether at Baghdad, or at Bushire, or at Bussora, when they shall have perfectly comprehend its contents and the object with which this paper has been written, to pay the sum therein specified, year by year, and without any delay or evasion either to the* Agent of the above-named illustrious Prince or to the Agents of His Highness’ mother and sister ; and after them, to the said Moojtahid as above-mentioned, on receiving a proper receipt from such person or persons. It is necessary also briefly to notice that if by accident it should happen that the issue of any portion of th*e above-mentioned yearly payment should be stopped, interest shall be allowed by the Honourable Company’s Government at the rate of 6 per cent, from the date on which such issue ceased to be regularly made.

It is true that his brother Maulvi Kalbe Mehdi of died on the 23rd/liovember last and that a vacancy has thus been created on the Charitable Committee at Karbala which it is desirable to fill. But I am advised that Maulvi Syed Muhammad Mahdi has no strong claim for consideration, although he has indulged in a great deal of propaganda in order to obtain nomination, he is not particularly *liked nor respected in Karbala, nor, X am told, is he a Mujtahid. un the other hand, A.
