Dated the 13th .Taiiuary 1934* Lt.-Colonel H.H.P.Dickson, C.I.E., I.A., Politiciil Agent, Kuwait; The Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B u s h i r e . Mr. Will jam son 1 s Political Note on Q,atar. Sir, With reference to your telegram Ho.T/23, dated the 13th January 1934, I have the honour to forward herewith copy of a note by Mr.vYilliamson (Haji) of the A.P.O.Co Ltd., on ' ^atar ^, together with a Family Tree of the house cf Ath Thani, dated the 14th January 1934. 2. Mr.Williamson gave me his note in pencil, so I had it typed out for you, for convenience sake, together with 4 spare copies. 3. Mr.Williamson’s note is a clear and accurate statement of fact and agrees with what I myself know of Qatar and its history. 4. I did not know that the exact boundary line, as claimed by Ibn Thani ran as Mr.Williamson says it does: I was under the impression that it started from S&amp;lwa fort, and ran south to ANBAK wells and then turned due East to the Sea, south of the Khor ODAID• As Mr.Williamson knows the geography of Qatar far better than I do, I think we must assume that what he says in this matter is correct. 5. Incidentally, and as I have already mentioned in another letter which I sent you sometime back, the existing Government map (Million Sheet) gives the depth of the Bay of Salwa quite wrongly. It runs much furtherfurther south than marked in th4 fact the true position of Q,asr Salwa, is only a little north of an East and West line running through Khor al Odaid. The best existing map to consult that I know of is that prepared by Mr.Philby and which accompanies his book ' The Empty Quarter *« although even he does not mention Jebel al NAKSH a conical hill a little north of ^asr Salwa.. I understand also that Mr,Cox of the A.P.O.C., Ltd,, was able to make a sketch map (hf the hinterland of Qatar, which could be studied with ad/antage. 6* As regards the political situation existing bet ween His Majesty King Bin Saud and the Ruler of Qatar: I agree with every word that Mr.Williamson says, and it is bom out by what I have heard in Kuwait during the last year or so. In my opinion Bin Saud definitely claims the Qatar peninsular, and will go on doing so, so long as we do not move with the times and adopt a policy there. All the in formation that I have been able to get from Riath, from time to time bears out exactly what Mr.Williamson says in this respect. It is practically certain that Bin Saud warned the Shaikh of Qatar on the latter’s recent visit to the Capital that he expected him to give any Oil Concession that might be going, to his friends, the Americans and not the British. He went, I believe, further, and told him, in a diplomatic way, of course, that only DOHAH could be con sidered as belonging to the Ibn THAN!’ family and that the rest of the peninsular was his. Certainly all the Bedouins of Hassa look upon the Qatar desert (Bar al Qatr) as belong ing to Bin Saud, and I only got this confirmed 3 days ago (lb. 1.34) by an Ajman Shaikh, who is now in Kuwait. 'When I asked him guardedly, if he knew the boundary between Saudiyeh and the Shaikh of Qatar’s territory, he promptly replied, 'There is no boundary, Bin saud rules ’Bar al Qatr’Qatr 1 (the desert of ^atar), and Ibn Than! ru3-es Doha'. ?• Bin Baud’s contention in the pest has always been that he alone rules the Bedouin Nomad elements in Arabia, for the simple reason that, as he says, only he can get at them and keep them quiet', hence all territory form ing the habitat of Tt Nomad tf Arabs he ipso facto claims to be his* 8* Bin Baud even went so far, some years ago, as to claim all ’Iraq nomad tribes, as well as all Kuwait Bedouins up to the walls of Kuwait, until the Gjair 6on- feranco of 1923 put a definite boundary line between him and his northern neighbours and forcod him to drop these ideas. To this day, however, in any public utterances he makes to his Nejd Bedouins, Bin Baud tells them that all the Bedouin of Arabia (Badia) are his, and his neighbours only hold the Towns* This is a regular trick of his to gain their allegiance and impress. 9. As regards the question of how to bring it home to Bin Baud that we consider Qutar State to be independent of Saudi Arabia, and that we will not stand by and see Ibn Thani coerced in any way, where Oil or other questions are concerned: I do not consider the problem presents many difficulties, but we must tackle it at once , other wise the Americans will get into Qatar for a certainty, and that principality will pass under the suzerainty of Bin oaud. 10. In my opinion the procedure should be as follows: His Majesty’s Government should without further delay add ress a friendly but firm note to Bin Baud embodying the following points (a) That he was definitely told by Bir Percy Cox at Ojair in 1923 (I was present at the interview) when Major Holmes tried to include Qatar in his Hassa Oil Concession with his, Bin- 4 - (f /) Bin Baud’s, approval, that C^atar was an indepen dent State under our protection. (b) That he, Bin Baud, was further told by Sir Percy Cox that he had no rights in ^atar what soever and so could not give away what did not belong to him. (c) That as he never raised any objection at the time or since to Sir Percy Cox’s pronounce ment, His Majesty’s Covernment considered the matter as definitely settled. (d) That in^view of His Majesty’s Government the time had now come to officially demarcate the frontier line as between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as had been done with Transjordan, ’Iraq and Kuwait and to that end invited him, Bin Saud, to admit the correctness of the boundary and Neutral Zone as claimed by the Ruler of Qatar by an exchange of notes. 11. Bin Saud could reply in three ways. Either (a) he would agree out of hand, or (b) deny that Ibn Thani’s boundary was the right one, and ask for a boundary com mission to fix the boundary: or (c) he would deny our right to interfere, and claim the whole of Qatar as having come to him when he drove the Turks out of the Hassa Province, Qatar having formed part of that province according to the Turks. In any case Bin Saud will have to show his hand and His Majesty’s Government will know how to make the next move. 12. It is of great importance that a copy of the letter which we send to Bin Saud, should be given to Ibn Thani, and that he be given to understand that we mean business and that having settled his boundary officially with Bin Saud for him we mean to assist him if necessary by force to defend it against all aggression. This must- 5 - This must be thoroughly got into his mind, and be backed by a written promise on our part to afTorci such support, with the present development of our Air Force, there should be no difficulty in doing this. ISo Knowing Bin Saud as I do, I believe that when he is clearly made to realize that we intend to defend Qatar’s land boundaries in case of necessity, he will ac cept the situation at once as he did in the case of ’Iraq and Kuwait. 14. What we must not do - and this is the crux of the whole matter - is to leave the situation as it is now, that is to say unsettled and in fluid state. If we do, the astute Bin Saud will at once take full advantage of our laissez fairs attitude and by means of bluff and bombast where we are concerned, and by secret pressure and tribal r^dlo into ^atar (he denying responsibility all the time) where Ibn Than! is concerned, will gain all his points, and | force Ibn Than! to acknowledge that he is the power that counts, and can do things, whilst His Majesty’s G-ovemment is not. Ibn Than! will then, whilst outwardly ’keeping in’ with us, surrender his hinterland to Bin Saud and give any » Oil Concession that may he going to Bin Baud’s proteges, the -Americans, on the plea that theirs was the better offer. | 15. Sven if we are successful by diplomatic methods in keeping the Standard Oil of California out of Oatar, the Shaikh of that State will never give the concession to the I.P.C., or A.P.O.C., unless we can give him an as surance that we intend defending his land frontiers, and will see him through any and every quarrel that Bin Saud may choose to pick with him in the future. 16. It should not be forgotten - and I state this as a well known and curious fact - that everyone of the Arabian Coastal idairates in the Persian Gulf, have got it deeply fixed in their minds that in some way or other Bin6 Bin Baud can bring undue influence to bear on His Majesty’s G-overnment and get His Majesty’s Government to back him and settle any differences in his favour, if it is a case of Bin Baud or themselves. They are all suffering from a Bin Baud inferiority complex today, and we will not succeed in bettering matters, until we eradicate this idea and make them believe that we are prepared to stand by them, whatever form aggression from their f, ’big’ brother takes. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, be Lt.-Colonel Political Agent, Kuwait.notes on Qatar. / dr) The ruling family of Qatar are Al Thani* They came from Central Arabia somewhere about the year 1750 A.D. and are Bin Tammim by descent. Of the family there are now sixty two males living. The paramount Shaikh is Shaikh Abdallah ibn Qasim ath-Thani. Shaikh Abdullah was made Ruler over the heads of his two elder brothers, Thani and Khalifah and his uncle Ahmad. This appointing the Ruler from a younger son seems to be a custom in the Thani family. Shaikh Abdullah has appointed his son Hamid over the elder brother Aly. 2 « THEIR RULE &amp; POWER. Shaikh Abdullah claims the whole of the Qatar peninsula bounded on the south west by a line drawn from NAKHSH towards the East, al Gabal, Wadi al Gaiban to the Sabkhah, and coming out on the East coast on the northern shore of Khor ODAID* Beyond the frontier mentioned is a neutral zone of several miles in breadth, one part being bet -ween Qatar and the Oman tribes on the south east, and the other part being between Qatar and the Saudi territory on the south west. The Neutral Zone and the frontier between Qatar and the Oman tribes is recognised by all, but that between Qatar and the Saudi Government is only recognised as on sufferance from IBN SAUD. Ibn THANI is a merchant prince, he derives his power from wealth accumulated by his father and grand-father from pearling and trading. These Arab merchant princes loan out ^money to their relations and to others who are settled in their district, collecting only a percentage on the profits and bearing the losses in most cases. In return the} receive the service and allegiance of these merchants, who are all more or less indebted to them. Ibn THANI other than the sixty odd members of his2 own his/family, has no tribe which he can claim ae, his own in i^atar. There are a few scattered semi Nomads of the NAIM tribe on the peninsula dating back to the time of the BINI MUSLIM who were the rulers in C^atar before the fhani family. Ibn THANT depends for his fighting force on men drawn from the BINI HAJAR and the BINI MURRA, two of the three tribes pasturing along the border of t^etar. The third tribe is al-MONASlR. Ibn THANI is definitely dependant on the good will of Ibn Saud and his HASSA Governor, Ibn JaLLOUI, for the safety of his lands from the raids of the Nejd tribes, especially from the MANASIR. I believe it irks Ibn THANI to be so much de pendant for his safety on Ibn Saud, but to strengthen himself by hiring a body of mercenaries from the tribes of BINI RAjtJAR and AL MURRA, other than the few dozen men he has at present, would cost him much and more than he coulc well afford. The income of Ibn THANI, as I have said before, is derived from pearling, and from monies lent out to traders on the n percentage from the profit ' basis. This percentage varies from 5 a to 25 a. Generally if on the 5 fo from the trader makes good any losses from the capital lent; but if on the 25 basis the lender suffers any legi timate loss to the capital. Ibn THANI draws a small income from Dohah Customs but not enough to cover the upkeep of the Government and Town guards. Customs charged are 4 $ ad valorem. No income is derived from the grazing and the Bedouin tribes of BUNI HAHAR, MURRA, and MANASIR graze as they wish, except in one or two areas, which are set aside for the herds of Ath Thani. 5, TUANS. The towns of C,atar are as follows; On the west coast WAKRA governed by the sons- 3 - sons of Abdur Rahiaan. DOHAH . the Capital. Here the Ruler has a large castle, but spends most of his time at RIYAN, where he has a garden. RIYAN, about eight miles inland from DOHAH, has very sweet and plentiful water at a depth of about 6 ft. Most of the Bedouin Fidawi of Ibn THANI live at RIYAN. DHA 1 AIN . Ruled by ohaiich aLY and his sons. Shaikh Aly will take no customs dues from his people, nor money from the clivers. K.HQR QL MAHADHADAH. This Town has a Governor elected by the Thani family. The towns at the northern point and east coast are all (so they claim) independent of the THANI family, paying no taxes nor customs and appointing their own Governors. The principal of these are ROU’US ABU ADH DHUHIF and A3HAIRIJ. ZUBARA was at one time larger even than DOHAH with whom it was constantly at war. It is now a ruin without one inhabitant. Ibn THANI, during the Turkish regime held the title of ^AIMAKAM and ^atar came under the MUTASARIFIAH of HABBA. nt one time he drew a small subsidy from the Turks. | 4. POBITION WITH RBG^RDS THB SAUDI GOYBRNMI^NT. | Ibn THAI\ r I, as I have mentioned is dependent on the f good will of the Baudi Government for the safety of his state from Bedouin raids. Lately when he visited Ibn Baud at Riyadh, it is said that he was told that 'tatar was part of the Saudi Kingdom, and that he only held DOHAH, and the adjoining towns on sufferance of Ibn Baud, also that the Saudi Government looked upon the idea of a British company having an oil concession in %atar with disfavour and if anyone was to be given a concession in ^.atar it must be the Americans. The foregoing is the least Ibn Baud was reported4 reported to have said to Ibn THANI. It is almost certain in view of Ibn Sand’s claim over Ibn T HAN T and Qatar that if Ibn THANI is allowed to give the oil concession to the Americans, it will be tanta mount to acknowledging Ibn Sand’s definite suzerainty over Qatar* If Ibn THANI were promised protection of his country from Ibn Sand and especially from raids from the Bedouins on his borders, i feel that he would be incline in fact be very glad to be an independent ruler and to be in a position to act as he thought fit with regards to the concession, especially as under the present circumstances, no matter to whom Ibn THANI gives the concession Ibn Saud will expect a large share of the proceeds for protecting Qatar from his own Bedouins* 3d* A*iF. 7/illiamson.

Dir, ■ 2- \ ! Ck \ With reference to Foreign Office letter No. 2 7290/487/25, dated the 7th December 1933 to the India Office, with enclosures, which were, forwarded under your Printed Confidential Letter No.l999-S, dated the 30th December 1933, I have the honour to report the substance of a private and informal conversation which I had with His Excellency the Shaikh on 17 th January last, which I think may be found of some interest. 2. During #iole talk the Shaikh was remarkably communicative, probably because of the fact that the trying Pamadhan fast was to end the next day. In any case he spoke more freely on Oil matters than he had done for many month s. 3* I started the ’ball rolling’ by enuuiring if he had ever heard of one Mr .Abdul Ghani # Adlabi of Manchester (not Ydlibi as mentioned in Foreign Office letter referred to above). The Shaikh immediately replied that he knew all about the person. He was a well known Syrian who had adopted European ways of living.2 Mr.Adlabi had large business connections in India, Egypt and Turkey and had of late years supplied His Majesty King Bin Baud with much of his f, Stor©s n requirements, both military and civil and only recently had purchased tents for his Asir campaign. The King was under a great debt to Mr,Adlabi, added the obaikh, literally and metaphorically, and in order to show his gratitude and no doubt to prevent him presenting his 'Bills'' prematurely, was reported to have appointed him his accredited Agent to deal with any Oil companies, who might be desirous of getting fur ther concessions in Saudi Arabia (exclusive of Hassa), On my enquiring from where he, the Shaikh, had got his information, he replied, 'from Mohamed Yatim and quite recently'. This latter person, as you know, is Major Holmes' 'jackal' and visited Egypt in December last, where I strongly suspect that he met his employer and received instructions for a new campaign in Kuwait. O.C. ) 4. I next made a guarded reference to Q,atar and QATAR ») enquired from the Shaikh how he thought the A.P.O.C. were getting on in their negotiations with Shaikh Abdulla ibn Thani. The Shaikh smilingly replied that although he did not like to state it as a 'positive fact', all news and other indications that reached him from Riath showed that Bin Saud had definitely warned the Shaikh of Qatar that he was not at liberty to give any sort of Oil Concession to the A.P.O.C. or other British concern, and that if he had the temerity to do so, it would be at his peril. He, the Shaikh, believed the above to be the true facts of the case, and as far as he was concerned he was quite certain that the A.P.O.C. would fail to get the concession they were after and that the next step would be that Bin Saud would inform the Shaikh of Qatar thet he must give Oil Concession to his proteges, the Standard Oil Company of California. (In thisthis connection see my despatch C-17 , dated the 18th January). His Excellency then went on t o say that this unsatisfactory situation was entirely due to our failure to instil a ' feeling of confidence ^ into the mind of the Shaikh of Qatar. The latter clearly (and the same, said the Shaikh, applied to every other Shaikh on the Arab Coast) felt today that we (Hi&lt;&amp; Majesty’s Government) were a 'broken reed' and not to be relied on. $e talked a great deal about the importance of treaties where they affected her own interests, but apparently were not out to remember our obligations to our friends #10 were in treaty relations with us, when strong persons like Bin Saud, who we wanted to keep in with, exerted pressure on them. The latter had only to bully and threaten, and his victims despairing of getting any but verbal backing from us, whom they looked to for active support, naturally took the line of least re sistance, and secretly agreed with Bin Saud to do all he asked of the*\ This, of course, entirely suited the King’s policy. He did not come out into the open and so had no occasion to cross swords with His Majesty’s Government. I next enquired from His Excellency how he would deal with Qatar ek situation if he himself had the managing of it. His reply reply was quick and to the point: 'I should immediately warn Bin Saud that Qatar was entirely independent of Saudi Arabia and under my protection only; that I considered the boundary to be so and so, between the two States, and that being the case, he, Bin Saud, shodld be careful to see that none of his Bedouin tribes committed any acts of aggression against Qatar territory'. Bin Saud, said the Shaikh, would perfectly well understand the threat behind such letter. 'At the same time', added His Excellen cy, 'I would send a copy of my letter to the Shaikh of QatarQatar and inform him that in future I would assist him to defend his land frontiers against aggression from all comers and would give him a letter to that effect. I would then remind him that by his treaty with me he could give no Oil Concession to any one whom I disapproved of. This is how I would act and this is how His Majesty’s Government ought to act, if she wants to save Qatar. A laissez faire attitude will no longer do f ’. ’’You must at all costs”, added the Shaikh, 'show Ibn Thani that you mean to be his friends, and give him proper support against the King, and you must do so quickly; half measures will not do”. 5. As the Shaikh said all this I wondered how far 3AUD ) he intended to road me ’a parable’ where his own state was NEUTRAL) E. ) concerned, so taking a shot at random, I asked whatwas there to prevent Bin Baud trying his Qatar game on the Kuwait Neutral 2^one. The Shaikh replied quickly that he did not think the King would or could do so without first y\/ debouncing the whole ’Neutral Zone Agreement’, to himself and to His Majesty’s Government jointly. He relied on His ivlejesty’s Government to see that Bin 3aud did not do this, or start trifling in the matter. I asked him if he had anymen or retainers camped in the Kuwait Neutral Zone to give him early news should any American geologists suddenly motor across its border and begin prospecting. He replied that he had none, but would think of the advisability of sending a small watching party there. I very strongly advised him to do so. 6. Lastly I nay mention that I myself have got a special Agent ready to go out at a moments notice, whose role will be to watch the limerican geologists, should they move into North Hassa. The man will inform me the moment (if ever) they cross the Neutral Zone line. Should that happen, I propose at once going out by car, meeting them and/5 and informing them that the Neutral Zone is forbidden ground; this by order of His Majesty T s Govermaent, acting on behalf of the Hha ikh of Kuwait. The latter is aware of what I propose doing and concurs with the idea. x \ \ \ I have the honour to be, hir, Your most obedient servant, UJ Lt .-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait. /' cTelegram G-.T.C.

IZth DecemBor, 1933. dear Warner, With reference to my letter to you Ho.3835/353/78 of the 38th Hoyemfcer last, relative to the Rasa Oil Concession, I mentioned the matter of the unpublished annexure to the Standard Oil Company*s of California # s concession to Philby on the 6th December shortly after his return from Egypt. I found him quite helpful. He stated that although he did not possess a copy of the secret agreement, he was present in an unofficial but advisory capacity at the 'Cabinet” meeting that finally examined the concession, clause by clause and approved it. He had also something to do with the verification of the translation. lie thought he could remember most of the Secret clauses and promised to look through his papers. He w s then about to leave for Mecca and promised to let me know soon but he is again in Mecca and it may be a week or two before I see him next, I give you hereunder, however, the points he mentioned to me off-hand in conversation, as forming part of the secret agreements- 1. Fin nee , Ihe 835,000 gold recently paid by the Company to the Government consisted of £5,000 gold as rent and £30,000 gold as loan, (Comments fhe missing sum in Article 3 is perhaps £30,000 gold and that in Article 4, £5,000 gold.) After a period of several months (I think 6), the Company was to pay a further £80,000 gold, making C.F,A,Warner, Esq.., £50,000/ Eastern Department, Foreign Office*£50*000. Upon oil being struck in pacing quantities, the Company was to make a further loan of £50,000 gold - total £100,000 gold. PMlbj also stated he had an idea there was a provision forthe payment of a further £50,000 gold at the end of tv^o years. (Commentj fhere is no mention of tills in the agreement $ unless it all form© part of the sum mentioned in Article 3* She sum mentioned in Article 8 * £50,000 - one year after dicovery, another £50,000 to be paid). Aeroplanes . There is a clause permitting the Company to operate y planos in Hasa. (Comment: Article 19). 3. Kuwait Heuwrtl done . Thera is a clause on this subject which, Philby thought, ran as follows: The Sa f udi Arab Government promised to use their influence vdth the Sheykh of Kuwait to got him to agree v/ith them to give the Com* uny the concession for the whole of the area. Un the event of this proving impossible, the Sa f udi Arab Government would try to get the Sheykh to agree to making identical terms with the Company to whoa he (the Sheykh) eventually gave a concessioi in hie sphere of this son© with the terms Ibn Sa*ud made v/ith the Standard Oil Company of California. The latter would therefore be at no disadvantage competitively. (Comment: Ho reference in concession.) 2.

Mr.Eraser of the a^P.O.C. asked yesterday if he could come for a private end Informal talk about oil arrangement# in Koine it in connection with the discussions which were proceeding with tie American company interested in that area. Mr# Walton and X saw him this morning* 2&lt; it mas made clear to Mr. Eraser that while tne India Office were responsible for coordination in this matter tuey were only one of four departments concerned end that any discussion which took place must therefore be entirely non committal in character. Mr. Eraser agreed that this was the ease and said that his object in asking for the interview had been to explore the ground, so that he might know what line it was best to take with a view to securing British interests in his discussions with the Gulf Oil Company. 3. A greement with tile Gulf O il Company. Mr. Eraser said that the 50/50 arrangement had now been ratified by the Gulf Oil Company, who were apparently well satisfied with it. The effect would be that the 50/50 would * extend to holding, marketing, sale and Blreotors. (For exploitation see para.7 (b) below). The Chairman would have no easting vote, and would be merely a Director. He would In alternate years normally be a British and a U.S.subject. Any single Director could, in the absence of the other directors who represented the interest to which he belonged, use the proxies/ # lproxies of those Bireotors* The Company would, however; he British company, registered in Great Britain and would itself operate the concession. It would probably be known as the Koweit Oil Company and steps for its immediate registration would be taken* a 4* ^ vms pointed out to Mr, Fraser that the discussion which had been provisionally arranged between Sir John Cadman and Sir Louis Kershaw on the question of the approval stated to have been given by H«M»G* t© a 50/50 arrangement had not yet taken places that it would be essential in the first instance to clear up the position as to the granting 01 tiie concession regards this, and that tne approval of H.LUG^could not yet be assumed. Mr, Fraser stressed great concern at the thought of anything developing which would upset the arrangement which had been reached. The A,P*0.C. had kept their Government Directors fully in touch wi h what was going ©n and had had their approval. It was agreed that this matter should be left for the discussion between Sir John Cadnan and Sir Louis Kershaw^which was to be arranged without delay. But Mr, Fraser was also informed that so far as oil in the Gulf sheikhdoms was concerned (as distinct from oil in Persia) the India Office were now the coordinating authority, and must in future be consulted effectively in that capacity before any decisions were taken affecting those Sheikhdoms* -separably'*-..- He said he appreciated the position. 5, Future procedure . Mr. Fraser said that he xiad discussed the situation generally with Ma^or Stephens, who represented the Gulf Oil Company. He was anxious to take soundings as to the position so as to know how best to keep Major Stephens on the right track so far as British interests were concerned (consistently. ' of course, with his loyalty7-/ t© Mm as a coilaagu©) • H© felt tiiat it was most important t© reassure ilajor Stephens, as there was, consequent on the past history of the Keweit concession, a certain suspicion that we might wish t© discriminate ©gainst imerioan interests# He thougiit that, if n© objection was seen (and he had suggested this t© Major Stephens) the best course would be that here, as in the case ©f ;&amp;tar. Major Stephens and he should discuss the situation frankly with the departments concerned* He was anxious, however, in the first place tiiat Major Stephens and he should discuss the position informally and non-committally with the India Office before a formal meeting ©f departments took place. Mr. Fraser was informed that no ©bjection was seen t© an arrangement of this nature. It would, of course, be understood that the other departments concerned must be kept in full touch. 6. Mr. Fraser indicated that the Company were preparing or had prepared a draft concession vihich they would wish to submit to the Sheikh ©f Keweit. In the drafting ©f the concession he had done his utmost to give full weight t© the various criticisms which had been made on behalf of H.M.H. @f the draft atar concession. He had, however, thought it better to avoid the important points of in connection with the Qatar concession Mr. Fraser was informed that while it was impossible to principle raised^ on behalf of H.IvUG^) make any statement on the subject without consultation with the other departments interested, it was probable that th© special safeguards which H.M.G. had indicated t&amp;eir desire to secure in connection with the Qatar concession would with certain modifications be thought equally desirable in the case ©f Keweit.

The A.P.O.G. had ori^inallv thought British interest© might be a erred Lr, of 1 a British subject to negotiate. And they understood too that Major holmes had great local influence and knowledge. In negotiation he would, of course, be kept under Ms (hr.

Fraser enquired whether we had rather see. an American used as negotiator on behalf of the American in were ate than i^anjor Holsaes. He was informed in rajhly that, while we could not say so definitely without further consideration, it was not impossible that this migiit be the ease. Major Ho.jaes’s record in Bahrein had been very unfortunate and it would b© d, moult to repose confidence in him. There had also been difficulties in Kmmlt owing to Ms endeavours to short circuit the I.a. Mr. Fraser suggested that if this was the case we xaight at the meeting with Major Mephena say frar/ly that certain difficulties had arisen in the pas*, with Major Holmes which would make us regard Ms nomination in the present instance as an unfortunate one, and tnat we should, if this view was accepted by the interested Beparti^nts, e,s&amp; Major Stephens whether he could not suggest some alternative nomination. Could he not, for instance, go Mmself, or perhaps nominate some ijaerioaa rspresent&amp;tive of the Company?

Cadman suggested, and it was agreed on Denali oi trie India Office, that from the previous discussions regarding the Koweit concession there was sufficient reason j-or tne Anglo Persian Oil Company to assume that a 50/50 arrangement with the Gulf Company would not be objected to nis ^3 © sty T s Government. It was agreed, however, that oms aid not mean that His Majesty's Government were committed in advance to approval of the grant of a concession by the oheiiOi o.l Koweit unless they were satisfied that British interests were adequately safeguarded - notably in regard to the question of the nationality of the personnel actually operating the concession. The opportunity was taken to discuss in a preliminary way certain points which had been mentioned in a previous informal discussion with Mr. Fraser on 3rd January, vis ., the following:- jjtiLy^lh.2. 0 . c , a 1 pc rS-Qnrie 1 . The Anglo Persian Oil Company will do their utmost to get the Gulf Company to agree to this, and nave hope ox succeeding if the matter is put to Major Stephens, their representative in London, in the right way. It could be pointed out that the Bahrein Petroleum Company nave agreed that as many of their employees 'in Bahrein as is consistent/ 30 PY SENT TO.consistent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking shall at all times he British subjects, or subjects of the Sheikh of Bahrein'. Mr. Fraser thought that the fact that a company under American control has agreed to this condition would carry weight with Mr. Stephens. It could also be explained to the latter that trie motive of our desideratum is not any desire to discriminate against Americans, but to safeguard the interests of the undertaking and its personnel,* the peculiar conditions in the Gulf Sheikhdoms necessitate caution in regard to the admission of Europeans and Americans, and great caution is necessary in the case of non-British subjects, both because these might not understand so well as British subjects the desirability of following the advice of the political authorities, and also because, if they should get into trouble with the local or neighbouring populations, the case might involve international complications, instead of being merely a domestic matter for the British Government. There is no special reason to suppose that the Gulf Company will wish to employ Americans; it seems likely that they would prefer that English staff should be employed, as this is cheaper and can be readily provided by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Provided no objection is raised by the Gulf Company to an arrangement on the lines of the clause in the agreement with the Bahrein Petroleum Company, a clause of this character could be inserted in an agreement to be made between His Majesty's Government and the Koweit Oil Company, for it will probably be desirable to adopt in the case of Eoweit the same procedure as in the case of Qatar - i.e., to have two agreements one, covering commercial matters, between the Company and the Sheikh/3. Sheikh, and a second one, covering political questions, between the Company and His Majesty's Government. (ii) The questions of local refining and of -preem pt ion in time of v/ar were left over for discussion with the Admiralty. (iii) The question of the method of negotiating the concession w i th the Sheikh of Koweit . It was agreed that the commercial side of the negotiations might he conducted hy the representatives of the Anglo Persian Oil Company and the Gulf Company with the Sheikh direct, provided that the Political Agent was kept in close touch with the negotiations and was immediately informed of all developments. There will be parallel consultation between Mr. Fraser and His Majesty's Government at this end. One argument in favour of direct negotiation with the Sheikh on commercial questions is that the negotiations by the two companies while they were competitors were in fact conducted with the Sheikh direct, and if the Sheikh finds that they are suddenly switched into the channel of the Political Agent now that the two companies are combined (and he may consequently have perhaps to put up with less attractive financial terms), he may attribute the less attractive nature of the offers which are now received to the intervention of the political Agent. As regards political questions, these will be mainly negotiated in London between Mr. Fraser and His Majesty's Government, and may not arise, save incidentally, in the local negotiations of the Companies' representatives with the Sheikh. (iv) The question of the person to represent the Gulf Company in the local negotiations . Their own proposal was to employ Major Holmes, and Mr. Fraser had originally supposed that/that, since Major Holmes is a British subject, this plan would be agreeable to His Majesty's Government. Sir J.Cadman fully appreciated the difficulties regarding Major Holmes resulting from his conduct at Bahrein, the fact that, as is generally known in tne Gull, he has been removed from his post by the Bahrein Petroleum Company, and the fact that he is nob persona grata witn the local British authorities* Nevertheless, Sir J. Cadman who was fully aware of Major Holmes' capacity for mischief, pointed out that, from the point of view of securing the success of the negotiations, it might be better to accept the Gulf Company s proposal ra oner than asm them to employ someone e 1 se (presumably an Ame rican), beeause, if Maj or HoIme s neie excludea at tnis stage, his capacity and opportunities loi intiigue might Du much more dangerous than if he were employed as a negotiator under the eye of the Anglo Persian Oil Company especially as it is anticipated that the real conduct 01 tne negotiations will be in the hands of the representative of the Anglo Persian Oil Company, and that Major holmes's role wi11 be quite secondary. If he showed signs of giving trouble, Mr. Fraser gave the assurance that he would have no hesitation in removing him. It was agreed that there was great force in Sir J. Cadman's view that it would be better to take Major Holmes along with us in a position in which he could easily be supervised, rather than exclude him and drive him into hostility. i28/4/8*) jttroet from letter fro® .»r.

Whitehall, 5.W.I. 10th January 1934. Mr. Fraser, of the Anglo Persian Oil Company brought Mr. Stevens, his collaborator of the Gulf Oil Company, to the India Office on Monday afternoon to introduce him. I was rather favourably impressed by Mr. Stevens, who has a pleasant and straightforward manner. to procedure and on certain other points which had already- been explored in the conversations at the India Office on 3rd and 4th January, and for the most part appeared to carry Mr. Stevens with him. He suggested that there should be two agreements, one between the new Company and the Sheikh covering the commercial questions, and the other between the Company and His Majesty's Government covering political questions, and that the first should be negotiated by local negotiators, on behalf of the Company, with the Sheikh direct. He agreed that the Political Agent should be kept in close touch with the negotiations, and be immediately informed of all developments. I agreed that we could concede direct negotiations on this understanding. The Company's negotiators would be Mr. Chisholm, of the Anglo Persian Oil Company, and Major Holmes for the Gulf Company. Mr.Fraser at this interview said nothing at all about Major Holmes's position in the negotiations being in anyway secondary; the whole implication of his remarks was that the two negotiators would be on an equal footing. It seems clear, therefore, that Mr. Fraser put forward the suggestions in regard vi s is-a-vis/ .C.Starling, Esq., Petroleum Department, Mi ne s D e par tme at, Dean Stanley Street,vis-a-vis the Gulf Company and in discussions at which their representative is present, the Anglo Persian Oil Company think it necessary to acknowledge the equal status of the two'negotiators. Yv r e must presumably accept this ostensible position, in the expectation that it will not affect Mr. Fraser’s assurance to us that if Major Holmes gives trouble, he will be able to secure his removal. I enclose copy of a p )e ^ so nal letter which I have sent to Mr* Fraser on this point. Mr. Fraser hopes to be able to produce shortly the first draft of the commercial agreement with the Sheikh. When we receive this, we will send you a copy of it, with a view to its early examination, first interdepartmentally and then at a meeting at which Mr. Fraser and Mr. Stevens could be present. After it had been vetted in this way, we would send out copies to the Political Resident and the Political Agent, and Messrs. Fraser and Stevens would instruct the local negotiators to begin negotiations with the Sheikh. We agreed that consideration of the agreement between the Company and the Government could also start at once. Mr. Fraser will let me have his suggestions, to be based on the points indicated in Laithwaite’s letter to Mr. Hearn of 29th December, in regard to the Qatar agreement between the Anglo Persian Oil Company and the Government, so far as these are applicable. The question of the nationality of the local personnel oi&gt;erating the concession was discussed in an informal way. As was anticipated, Mr. Stevens made considerable difficulty about this. The object of our desideratum that the local personnel should be British or Koweiti/Koweiti was explained to him on the lines suggested in the previous conversations at the India Office, and the relevant clause in the agreement with the Bahrein Petroleum Company was read to him. It was clear that he had expected that it might be possible to employ a considerable number of Americans, but in.the end he gave some indication that he might be prepared to accept a clause on the lines of the Bahrein clause, if the words 'as many as is consistent with the efficient carryi on of the undertaking' were further qualified by the word 'in the judgment of the Company'. This is a point which we shall have to consider. Copy is enclosed of a letter which I have sent to Mr. Fraser. I am sending similar letters to Kendel and Seal. fSd.) J. 0 . WALTOM*’er&amp;onal and Conj;iaGiitial i India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l 10th January, 1933. Ihere is one point in connexion with our talh on Monday not mentioned in my other letter to you today. Nothing v as said in the oonrersation about the douhts felt as to the suitability of Major Holmes for the joint negotiations 7/ith the Sheikh or about our hope that in practice Mr* Chisholm would do most of the work. The reason why I did not say anything as to this, is taat since we have decided to take Major Holmes along with us so long as he does not give trouble, it seemed unnecessary to raise any question of his suitability with Mr. Stevens, and we are satisfied with your assurance that you will be able to secure Major Holmes^ replacement if he shows signs of giving trouble.

I. 10th January 1934. Thank you very much for introducing hr, Stevens on honday afternoon. It was a great pleasure to meet him, and useful to have a preliminary talk regarding the project for obtaining an oil concession from trie sheikh of Koweit. On receiving the draft which you end he are now going to prepare for an agreement with the sheikh covering the commercial slue of the proposed concession, I will communicate it to my colleagues in the other Departments chiefly interested, namely, the Foreign Office, Petroleum Department and Admiralty, ana we will examine it as quickly as possible and then, I hope, have a meeting with you and hr, Stevens. You said that you would simultaneously draw up suggestions regarding points to he included In the parallel agreement between trie new Company and His Majesty's Government, taking as your basis, mu tat 1 a mu tana i s . the points indie a tea in paragraphs 5 to 8 of Mr. Laithwaita's letter to hr. Hearn of 29th December (read with the enclosure to that letter) on the suoject of the contents oi the proposed agreement between the Anglo-persian Oil Company and His Majesty's Government regarding 0,atar. The main headings, so far as they are applicable to the case of Koweit, appear to be the following (a)/ iser, Esq., C.B.S., Deputy Chairman, Angio-Persian Oil Company Limited, Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, E.C. 2.(a) The nationality of the employees of the new Company in Koweit. we attach great importance to their being British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh of Koweit. The clause in the agreement with the Americanrcontrolled Bahrein Petroleum Company 'which I mentioned runs as foflowsr 'As many of the employees of the Bahrein petroleum Company, Limited, in Bahrein as is consistent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking shall at all times be British subjects or subjects of the sheikh of Bahrein.' Political conditions in Koweit are in some ways more difficult than those in Bahrein, and while wa might be willing to accept a clause on th^so lines in the case of the Koweit Oil Company, we could not, I think, concede substantially more. But I will certainly see that hr. Stevens's suggestion for the insertion after the words 'as is consistent' of the words 'in the judgment of the Company' is most carefully considered, (b) On- of the superior British local -mployees of the Company to be designated, subject to tno approval of His hajesty’s Government, chief local representative of the Company, and to be responsible for the Company's local relations with the Koweit authorities which should be conducted through the political Agent. (c) provision that the Company ~na all its local employees will undertake to give due deference at all times to. the wishes of th- Shaikh and the advice of the political representatives of His Majesty's Government. (a) provisions to secure that any sites which may b- s^luctod as aerodromes, aeroplane or seaplane buses, or in connection with the development of harbours or wireless and telegraphic installations will be available for these purposes, and that wireless ana telegraphic installations,3 it any, erected by the Koweit Oil Company will not he such as to interfere with such installations as may he established under arrangements approved by the Sheikh or His Majesty’s Government. (e) Some provision in regard to the arbitration of disputes as to the interpretation of the agreement between the Company ana the Sheikh to the effect that, if the arbitrators chosen by each party cannot agree on the selection of a third arbitrator, they will accept a third arbitrator nominated by the Political Resident. (f) Trie question of local refining. (g) The question of pre-emption in time of war. .An agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government covering these and any similar points (which I have, of course, stated only in the broadest outline) will require very careful examination. If you aid Mr. Stevens can, in conjunction with the India Office, sketch out the rough draft of a document, we can then all examine it in consultation with the other Departments concerned with a view to getting it into shape. We will uo our utmost to expedite consideration of the drafts both of the commercial agreement and of the Government agreement, but, as you understand, the procedure of consultation which I have indicated is necessary, because in a matter of this sort there are so many different departments of Government concerned. I enclose the relevant extract from the British treaty with Koweit which I mentioned. fSdj J. 0. WAI/TOK,BKI1A.NMC HOUSE, / .j FINSBURY CIRCUS, LONDON, E.C.2 11th January, 1904.

I feel sure that we shall soon emerge from our discussions with a clear entente regarding a satisfactory form of procedure and the general substance of the Agreements which we are trying to secure in ths Grula. p/ith respect to the question raised regarding Major Holmes, you will remember that during the discussion at which Mr. Stevens was present, he himself volunteered the statement that, in the event of any trouble arising due to Major Holmes, he would take steps to withdraw nim.

YI . 1y^' P.a. 303/1934 Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, London, E.C.2. 11th January 1934 Bear Mr. Walton / T K U 'W AI T I h§,¥e to acknowledge your letter of the 10th instant (P.2.233/34) and tun glad to inform you that we shall be able to send you a draft covering the commercial side of the proposed Concession, tomorrow morning (12th January). In preparing this draft we have given due consideration to the suggestions made from your side with respect to the somev/hat similar Qatar Concession and I hope and believe that, on examination, you will probably find little, if anything, in it which you will feel it necessary to criticise from your point of view. However, whatever comments you may wish to make will, of course, be most carefully considered by us. With respect to the parallel Agreement between the new Company and His Majesty’s Government, I would suggest that time might be saved if Mr. Stevens and I, or, in my absence, my colleague Mr. Hearn, were to sketch out the rought draft of a document at the India Office in conjunction with you, ; as you suggest in the ante-penultimate paragraph of your letter. I do not anticipate much difficulty in respect to the majority of the points you mention and have little doubt that we shall succeed in finding a formula, even in iregard to these other points the import of which is at present not entirely clear to us. Incidentally, the point regarding the nomination of the third arbitrator by the Political Resident has been incorporated in the/ .Walton, Esq., C.B., M.C India Office, WHITEHALL, S.W.l.the Commercial Agreement, so that this will heed no further discussion. It is possible that you may feel it desirable, in order to expedite procedure, to discuss the preliminary draft of the Government/Company Agreement for Qatar on the same occasion as that for Kuwait comes under discussion. In that case I think we might so arrange it that Mr. Stevens arrives after we have had time to settle, in broad outline, the Qatar principles. Such a settlement 'would also, as I think you will agree, materially facilitate a settlement of the points which relate to Kuwait, since, in general, the principles govering them are much the same. I quite appreciate the fact that the necessity you are under of arranging for inter-Departmental discussion in respect to the drafts in question involves more time than would be necessary if the subject came within the sole competence of the India Office, but I feel sure that you will do everything that is possible to facilitate an early settlement, having regard to the desire felt on our side to put our negotiators into the field at the earliest possible moment.

With reference to Laithvjaite ' s letter of 9th January, P.Z.154/34, you may like to know the present position in regard to the grant of oil concessions in Qatar to the Anglo Persian Oil Company and in Koweit to the Koweit Oil Company (controlled in equal shares hy trie Anglo Persian Oil Compsny and the Gulf Company of the United States of America). It has been decided in each case that the commercial side of the xarcposed concessions should be embodied in an agreement between the Company and --ne brieiIn^ concerned, which would not come into force until parallel agreernents between His Majesty 1 s Governinent and the Cornpany concerned have been concluded. The safeguards of British interests which we require will be emoodied in these Gov ernme nt agre erne nt s. The commercial agreements are already in drait. and some progress has been made in discussion of them with the Companies. I enclose copy oi Article / in the diafo commercial agreement respecting Qatar, end o±. Article a in the draft commercial agreement respecting Koweit. With a view to safeguarding, inter alia, the position in regard oo future requirements of air facilities, we contemplate that each Government agreement should contain clauses on the following lines ” 5 ./ rrmande r W . A.Me Claughry, P.8.0., M.C., D.P.C., ir Ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway, W.C.2.TT 5. Notwithstanding anything contained in the agreement between the Company and the Sheikh of Qatar K owe ft ••••*« the Company shall not have the right to use or occupy, and shall not include in the areas selected for the purposes of its operations, any sites which may have been selected by or on behalf of the Sheikh or His Majesty’s Government as being required for aerodromes or for aeroplane or seaplane bases, or in connection with the development of harbours, or for wireless and tele graph in st allaticns. 6. The operation of wireless, telegraph and telephone installations, if any, maintained by the Company shall not interfere with the operation of such wireless, telegraph or telephone installations as may be established under arrangements approved by the Sheikh or His Majesty’s Government”. I imagine that the question of possible future air requirements may be more important in Koweit than it is in Qatar, but, subject to your views, a clause on the above lines ought sufficiently to safeguard the position, presumably, however, it will be necessary to select alternative sites for possible future requirements before the Company commences operations. With reference to the last sentence of Article 5 (a) in the Koweit commercial draft agreement, we propose to suggest the addition of a qualifying clause to the following effect: 'Subject to any regulations of general application for aircraft made by the Sheikh', in order to safeguard the position under the aircraft agreement which3. vie are proposing to the Sheikh of Eoweit ('see oar letter of 11th August P.3.4434/33 and connected correspondence).

The first is an uncertified Arabic translation of a power of at iorney executed in a usual form before a Notary Public in London. The powers are conferred by the Arabian Development Syndicate Limited represented by three (or four) Directors, includirg Mr. Janson and the Secretary, pn Mr, Ydlibi. The first clause refers to the acquisition of rights of property etc., including concessionary rights, and the remainder gives to MxxXXiiMMr# Ydlibi wide rights of management, legal action and entering into contractson behalf of the Syndicate. v The night Honourable ^ir John Simon, G.s.g.j., K.Ci.V.O. e to., e tc ., e tc .' V 4 • x’he second document, printed in English and Arabic, is the draft of a concession of seventy years duration , to be granted jointly by Ibn Sa'ud and the Sheykh of Kuwait to enable the Syndicate to prospect for and exploit pei^oleum and gognate products, but not other minerai/Tls/ in the neutr^ , Z.nne . ^he proposed agreement consists of a preAmble and thirty five articles fhe first defines the scope of the concession* Provision is made for an initial payment within ninety days of signature, a subsequent annual rental and a royalty per ton, to Replace the rental, as soon as oil is discovered in commercial quantities* All sums under these heads are left to be filled in adater* The Syndicate seeks in draft very extensive Fights in regard to the construction of roads the establishment of means of communicating by tekegrapfe, telephone and wireless, and the construction of harbours, pipe lined etc® 5* The area to be conceded is to be the whole of the Keutral Zone having an approximate are of 1,700 square miles, bounded as follows, in accordance with a Sketch map attached to the draft On the north by the souther&gt;1 boundary of the territory of Kuwait laying approximately between Ibek longitude 47 •lb* east and longitude 48 .SO* east and ending at Ras-al Q,ualiyah on the coast t on the south by a^Line running due west along Parrallel 28.20* xzJufci north as far as its intersection with longitude 47.45* east; on the t)L*M by the coast between the points already indicated; and on the west by a line running south from the north-west is o LI Tit rte-rth.

I think I have Reproduced this defiuation accurately, but I am not clear as to how far it agrees with that in the Kuwait Lejd Boundary convention of December 2nd, 1922. 6. You will see by the ^closed record that iwayni stated categorically to me tha&amp; Mr. Philby v/as working in the interests A of standard Oil of California. Mr Ph|ilby 1 s contacts v/ith all concerned have teen numerous but I have no reason to accept thiB j^tdcular statement and I should be very sorry^to take Awayni f s unsupported woifilfor it. It is perhaps more important to know bo v/hat, if any, American interests the Eastern and General Syndicate Zone is now committed in -respect of the Keutral jdanand what is the role of/ jioH ^ Xu ^of Major Holmes* Awayni made no mention of the latter in his conversations with me but Faud Bey was positive that Awayni had represented the connexion betv/een the syndicate and Major Holmes n , ^ as severed* I dare not add anything further by way of comment to w] v^hat I aaid in my telegram under reference* 7. I amsending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the Political Resident at Bushire together with a copy XKXXtex3aix*xjd£X&lt; of the last three pragraphs of my telegram under reference, under cover of a despatch a copy of v/hich I enclose* I have the nonour to be v/ith the highest respect, bir. Your most obedient, humble servant, AHBREW RYAN.FUWAIT KBTJTRaL ZCI^B OIL CONCESSION. 1. Hussain Al Awayni came to see me by appointment, at his request, on January 9th. He produced for perusal and return two papei viz. the Arabic translation of a power of attorney appointing Mr, Ydlibi the attorney of the Arabian Decelopment.Syndicate Eiiiaifcted in C and a draft concession for oil etc,anoiK the Kuwait mtral Zone, whicl he had already submitted to Ibn Sa*ud. 2. I understood from Awayni that the Arabian Development syndicate represented a combine between Mr Ydliblj and the Eastern and General .... .... ... . - • . - ' , Syndicate. It was, he explained, a purely British concern and his/i instructions from his principals v/ere to keep me informed of everythiiig he did. The GompaJ^y had already obtained the approval of the Sheykh of Kuwait for the proposed concession. (He modified thj * * 3 4 this subsequently by sayi g that they had come to terms with he Sheykh officieusemen t only). He had been well received by Ibn 3a&amp;ud during his recent trip to Riyadh. His Majesty, he said in great kxxffj confidence , wished to giye any further concession to a British com- pany. ^he KiKlg v;as bound by his agreement with Standard Oyl of Gal- ifornia to give that company the preference on equal terms ijiregard ’ to his r ights in the Heutm Zone, but he v/i shed to arrange mat ers i so that that concession shouc|l/ go to a British group. I asked whether the King had said a British company or the Arabian Developments Dyndicate. Awayni intimated, not too categoriaally, that the terms of the proposed concession^greeaole ub Ibn Sa’ud. 3. Awayni also said that the has authorised standard Oil of California to send a geologist prospect the petroleu,. area U between Yanbt* and Mawayla but v/ithout any commitments as regards giving them a concession t^ere, if they found oil. ^s a matter of fac£ he v/i shed to give that concession also to a British concern aiid I gathered that the Arabiaji Development Syndicate would be inter, ested• 4. Awayni has no pxk&amp;axx professed object except to keep me au courant in accordance with iihs instructions, -“-e begged me to keep anything he said about the King’s views as secret, I replied that I halt no personality apart from HI s Majesty’s Government. I must tell them anything I heard even in secret, unless the information were to bfe sterile, but if I were t*ld anything in confidence, I&amp; a- confidence I could undertake ;hat it would be kept within nivernment circles, b.peaking generally, I said that anything concernim g the Keutral Zone v/as a matter so delicate that I would express no viev/s without reference to His Maj esty * s gKKgyiqkx. Government • Xs f^r the YaiiDp* Muwayla area, the proposition of which least ^ad been baa heard for some time past, the 3a*udi Government were unfettered. 5. arising out of what has pa^ ed aoout secr tcy, vwa; ni said that there ./ns o e ccrr i ai e].y Mr, PMlby who had i^e u ered and was still serving the interest e£ the Standard Oil Company . He had rec- eived fromthem a substa tial sum of money, d avoided definite comment on this but suggested that, while it would not be discreditable * for a British su T ct to work with American interests, T had no reason to suppose that Mr Philby was working. AwaMni assured me tnat he was speaking, not lightly, but by the b®6k. I did not pursue the subj ec t. 6. 1'he whole unexpressed trend of Awayni T s statements about the Neutral Zone was that the Arabian Develppment Syndicate had got both the Sheykh of Kuwait and Ibn Sa*ud pret ry well in their pockets aim.' * I already and that only the blessingsitf His Majesty* s Government was needed for the deal to go tharough. He said that they could have got the Hasa concession but had not had the courggt. His suggestion, in reply to a question ,was that they had not had enough encourage ment from His Majesty's Government to proceed. 7. Just after I saw Awayni, I'uad Bey Hamza mentioned the subject of a possible Neutral Zone concession as one About which he wished to speak to me, We discussed i t at some len^E^ on January 10 th. I said that IE supposed he knpw that Awayni has been to see me, but I did not disclose *4hat Awayni had said. Paud Bey said that he knirw all about Awayni, who was his close personal friend. What his u overVment wanted to know however was (a) what His Ma esty's Government thought of the standing of tne Arabian Development Synd- icate, and (b] the view taken of them by His Majesty's Government, They would also like to know (c) how to deal with the Neutral Zone concession, as regards the interests of the Sheykh of Kuwait • Awayni had so far got nothing definite from the King who had referr ed the whole subject to a committed of which he xxxxsxacx, Faud,S’aud, and Sheykh Abdullah Suleyman we re members : j 8. I said that ahy matter affect! g the heutral Zone vras such th that I c uld not pursue it without reference to His Majesty»s Government As regards the Arabian Development Syndicate I observed that I knew nothing against Ydlibi, except that he ^arha^s v/as xjQsaLi: inclined to represent his progress iyv any particular quarter as $r ( greater than it had {pen, when pursuing his efforts in some other &lt; quarter, e.g. he had ^iven people in London in understsad some time agO that he had shown the Legation here a document from Ibn Sa r ud whereas Mr Hope (Drill^ on whom he had called had certainly ssan no such document. He had also tried to create the impression ixi Sa’udd circles that he had been disouraged by His Majestyls government, who had in fact merely answered his enquiries in a r arded way, (l observed that Faud Bey oouuld certdinly not expect His f^aj e sty ’ s'government to give positive encouragement to eap- ; tahj invent money in this country, v/hen the Saudi government had done s&lt; so much to destroy their own cerdit, Faud Bey T m-reyxTgAfrfcftfrgxxfrx received this meekly. As for the Eastern aGeneral Syndicate I believed it to be a reputable concern with extensive connexions but its proceedings might not always/agree able , to His Majesty 1 s Government* I let fall the name of Major Holmes. Faud Bey said that, according to awayni, Major HoDkes had severed his connexion with Eastern and General, This I said was news to me, though I knew that Major Holmes had vacated his special position in regard i to the Bahrain Petroleum Company, It would, 1X1 said be of great ixks 1 xx&gt; interest to me, ibscaagh of some interest to my government and perha. s of interest to the .iSau’di Government, to know, whether Major Holmes v/as in fact out of the picture. ® Faud Bay said that Awayni was categorical on the subject. I gathered from this part oi of the conversation that Ion Sa’ud *3 hostility to Major Holmes «erti still persists. 9. Faud Bey said quite definitely that the King, althou^che had given the Hasa concession to an eminently reputable American Concern , did not wihh to give them more ana wanted to dealj as regards any other concessions, with British i terests, witness lids approach to me last June about a passible Aslr concession.ed ; Stf( •• » ij6 ( » 3 't* told Fuad Bey that I must suomit the whole matter to His Maj esty's Government but that it was too complicated tfc be dealt with by telegraph. He said that it would be of -reat ^ fj k advantage to have an early reply on points (a) a^d (b) in tz. paragraph 7 above, I promised to do what I could about this, Fuad Bey made no reference throughout to the Yanbu 1 Mu way la area. ii .r.. * [£ U ' 'T9JS*' If J+O°oniidential Te legram» Extract from 3ir Andrew Ayana telegram No.4 to Foreign Office of Hanuary i3th, ±934. 1 -ese bew developments seem to necessitate revision of theory suggested in penultinate sentence of mytele gram No. 10 Saving og last year and elaborated in enclosure in Political Residents despatch No 39 of Colonial Office, Unless Ibn Sa f ud is playi g unusually deep game he now seems genuinely anxious to interest British capital in Neutral Zone concession but this wish is probably qualified by mi struct both of ^nglo-fersian oil ^ompa y wh have not been mentioned in conversations here and of Holmes.

My lords consider that the policy ox H.M. Government should be h o - to insist upon these stipulations as the minimum, and to point out to the Anglo Persian Oil Company that these are ieitUiixts which would have to be met by any company of whatever nationality operating in Aoweit. It is also very important, that the re finery should be not merely in British territory, hut either in Koweit itself (which is for all practical purposes the same tiling) or at some port east of Koweit, e.g* Karachi or some other Indian port. 3.

It is suggested further that you should consider the need for safeguarding any flying boat aohorage© now used or likely to be required at Koweit, though subject to your comments', and in view of the fact that provision is already being maae for land or to accommodate a flying boat squadron at Bahrein we do not consider additional land need be safeguarded at Koweit on this account. 4.

T• 1* 15th January 1934* My dear Warner, I have now had a chance of seeing Janson and asking him to clear up the natter dealt with in your letter E 4/4/25* of January 4th about oil matters in the Persian Oulf# What he said is as follows:- 2* When the old Eastern and General Syndicate had been turned down by the British oil interests whom they had approached with regard to their oil rights in Bahrein, they took them to the Gulf Oil Company of America. That Company, however, were parlies to what is known in oil circles as the 'Red Line'* agreement, and owing to their obligations vis a vis the Tux‘kish Petroleum Company, were not able to operate in Bahrein. The Gulf Company (which is Mellon’s concern) referred the Eastern and General to the Standard Oil Company of California with whom* as you know* the Eastern and General were working closely until quite recently* 3./ sr Esq*5#/ 3 • Then, however, the Eastern and General had discovered, to their intense indignation, that the Standard uil Company of California were negotiating for the fiasa concession through Philhy and Twitchell behind their backs and in express contradiction of their agreement with the Eastern and General Syndicate. It was lor that reason, namely to try and undo as much or the harm already done by Phiiby and Twitchell, that ajcr Holmes was recently sent to Oedda* 4* This episode, according to Janson, had decided the Eastern and General to have nothing more to do with the Standard Oil Company of California. I think, from my knowledge or Janson, that his indignation with the Standard Oil Company was quite genuine. They, therefore, decided to form a new syndicate called the Arabian Development Syndicate with a nominal capital of £5,00t, and of which YdlTbi is a par tner, i or the express purpose of exploiting oil properties in the Koweit Neutral Zone and of forestailing the Americans. Janson pointed out, as stated in paragra h 3 of your letter under reply, that the j| Koweit Neutral Zone is not divided into 'spheres” but that i the concurrence both of Ibn Saud and of the bheikh of Koweit is necessary before any concession could be granted therein. Now he hopes to obtain the consent oi the Bheikh by means of the good relations which he claims already exist between himself and the Sheikhs- while the reason for the importation of Ydlibi is that he has very stron ; reasons for thinking that Ydlibi is in a position to obtain the concurrence of Ibn Saud. In this manner he hopes to forestall the efforts oi the Standard Oil Company of California in this region.5* He added that a^ter is treatment 'by the Standard Oil Company of California, his group had definitely determined, if they were successful in this rrea, to offer their rights only to a British oil company and had, so I understood, already had talks with Eraser of the Trap Petroleum Company over this matter* Janson said that after the Hasa episode, he was now ddinitely M through” with the Americans* 6# I said that, looking at it from a commercial point oi view, I supposed that he was satisfied with the standing of Ydlibi with regard to whom, on a priori gro nds* it seemed reasonable to proceed with a certain amount of caution (I added that I knew nothing personally to his disiavour). He said that Ydlibi was only in the syndicate for the purpose explained above and would be remunerated strictly by results - that is to say Ydlibi would not get his money until the syndicate had got their concession* 7* I am sending copies of this letter to Laithwaite at the India Office aid Starling at the Petroleum Department with the hope that the latter will forgive any technical inaccuracies in the nomenclatuxe or relation of these companies of which 1 may have oeen guilty above* It is possible that Janson may go and see Starling, to inform him of later developments* Yours, &amp;c* # (Sgd*) CECIL C.

D.O.No.C-84. My dear Fov/le, The following are the results of an interview which I had with the Shaikh on 25th February 19 34 on the question of n Oil n . 1* I opened the talk by saying that I understood that he, the Shaikh, had received the Kuwait Oil Company’s new Draft Agreement and presumed that he had read it. 2. The Shaikh at once flared up and said he was going to see Holmes and Chisholm on Tuesday (27th February) and was going to ask them what they meant by treating him like a child. How had they imprudence, he asked, U to offer him Rs.200,000/- (on the signing) when Holmes had offered him Rs.250,000/- last year and Sir John Cadman had offered as much as 4 lacs. Surely if his Concession was worth 4 lacs to the latter, it was still worth that to the Kuwait Oil Company. 3. The Shaikh continued and said, that he was going to tell Holmes and Chisholm to ’’clear out and M leave Kuwait” unless they could see their way to talk sense, that there were many other Oil Companies in the world who would no doubt be willing to offer a fair and decent price. Y/hy, even Bin Saud had not so long ago made it known that if he, Shaikh Ahmad, followed his lead and gave the Kuwait Concession as well as that of the Neutral Zone to the Standard Oil Company of Californie he, Bin Saud would take it as a very friendly act. 4. I then asked Shaikh why he had not accepted Cadman’s offer, as it really had been good. His reply The Hon’ble Lt.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, 'I 3 POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT.his reply was that previous to Cadmar^s arrival, Holmes had told him that anything that the A.P.O.C. offered he, Holmes, would be able to beat, so he had begged him to give him the chance of outbidding A.P.O.C. in any offer they made. He, the Shaikh, had promised to do this. The Shaikh went on to say that Holmes had added that should there come a time when hsi company could not beat the A.P.O.C.’s offer, then he, Holmes, would say so and the Shaikh could go ahead and deal with A.h.O.C. unhampered by him, Holmes. Before Cadman made his offer, Holmes* offer had reached Rs.250,000 (on signature). After Cadman’s offer had been made and you had come here and seen him, he, the Shaikh, had not asked Holmes to bid again, for he had decided to pot pone all netotiations (as he did). 5. The Shaikh again said that unless the Kuwait Oil Company played n fair n and made a decent offer, he was going to tell them that there were many Oil Companies in the world whom he could get to bid agcinst them and he fully intended to frighten the Kuwait Oil Company in this way. But he was determined that if they did not 'play up' they could go. 6. I here agreed that he had every right to get the best he could out of the Kuwait Oil Company, but told him that as roan to man I proposed giving him a piece of private advice. This, I emphasized, had nothing to do with anyone but myself and him. It was to the efTect that as I knew His Majesty’s Government had 'no use' for the Standard Oil Company of California, who had got into Hassa recently, he must be very careful indeed not to allow them to come into the field, as bidders against Kuwait Oil Company. The Shaikh smiled at my remark, and sai4 'Leave that to me. I give you my word of honour that in whatever way I manoeuvre with the oiwait Oil Company or whatever I say by way of threat to themthem, I shall never give a concession to any Company that is not approved of by your Government. You must iL* however let me go about getting Kuwait Oil Company to come to reason in my own way w . 7. Before leaving the Shaikh begged me to say nothing at all of what he had said to the Kuwait Oil Company’s representatives (Holmes and Chisholm), as I might spoil all for him. He desired to deal with them hiw own way. 8. I think the Shaikh is really roused against the Kuwait Oil Company’s low offer of Rs.200,000 as against Holmes’ and Cadman’s offer of last ye r. He, of course, only has himself to blame, but we must not forget what we want too . In my opinion the Kuwait Oil Company ought to get on with things and act ' big ”. They can surely afford to spend money. They will, I fear, get anywhere if they start haggling over small figures. If I were them, I should either 'go all out' and offer Cadman ’r figure of four lacs (on signature) or else ask the Shaikh now and without delay what he wants , and then either agree out of hand or work downwards. The point is that at present they (K.O.C.) have a clear field and no competitors. But they soon will have if they don’t watch it • Forgive this hurried scrawl, but I wanted you to know'how the Shaikh had reacted to Kuwait Oil Company’s first offer.

Mr.Stevens and Mr.Fraser agreed that the paper c cmmun i c at e d to them would serve as a, satisfactory basis for discussion, but said that there were certain clauses of considerable difficulty which would have to be considered. Mr.Fraser emphasised that the Company had to look at the matter fran a purely commercial point of view. Sir Louis Kershaw reminded him of the point of view of H.M.G. who would have to undertake considerable responsibilities if a concession were granted to the Company in Koweit. He enph&amp;sised that His Majesty’s Governmenthad' than the' fidei beini This with he hi sugg had a su'IM 2 . had to consider this question from a political rather than a commercial point of view. It V 7 as agreed that the various clauses should be considered by the meeting one by one. CLAUSE 1. M r.Stevens suggested that the clause might be widened to admit of any transferee or subsidiary company being registered in any part of the British Empire. This might get over certain difficulties in connection with taxation in the United Kingdom. Asked whether he had any other advantages in mind in making the suggestion, he said that no other specific advantage had occurred to him and he agreed that the forming of a subsidiary was not contemplated at present. Mr. Fraser said, that United Kingd cm taxati on was a severe obstacle to Companies which included foreign interests having their headquarters in this country, and alluded to the case of the building of the I.P.C. pipe line, where the Canpany undertaking that operation had to be made Canadian, so that American, Dutch and French interests should be free from United Kingdom income tax. Sir Louis Kershaw said that he saw the point of Mr.Stevens’ suggestion and that H.M.G. would consider it sympathetically in the case of transieree and subsidiary canpanies. CLAUS3 2- The Company's representatives agreed to tms clause. They also agreed that provision might be included in the agreement to guard against the3 possibility of the 50/50 basis of the Koweit Oil Company itself being altered. CLAUSE 5, first paragraph . Mr. Eraser said that the Company would like some modification of this clause, and Hr. Stevens suggested that the 50/50 basis of Clause 2 might be introduced also in Clause 3, to allow of the employment of drillers, geologists, etc* of American or other foreign nationality, and that employees other than the Sheikh of Koweit’s subj e cts mi ght b e 50Jo British and 50) : o foreign. Sir Louis Kershaw said that the limitation on the employment of foreigners was suggested purely for political reasons, since if, for example, any employee of the Company were murdered or got into any other kind of trouble in Koweit, it would be easier for His Majesty’s Government to deal with the case if tne Company’s employees were British. If, for example, the employee 'were an American citizen, there might be diplomatic difficulties with the American Government. Sir Louis Kershaw pointed out that even in Bahrein the Standard Oil Company of California had accepted a provision that as far as possible only British peisonnel should be employed and that in Koweit, with its tiibd hinterland the situation was much more difficult than m an island such as Bahrein. His Majesty's Government were, however, quite willing to allow the employment of foreigners if necessary in exceptional cases. VjX. Fraser suggested that the Company should be allowed to judge whether it was necessuiy in any cu.oe to employ foreign personnel. The Company should be ableto call on the services of the best men, whatever their nationality. He suggested the following redraft of the clause: - !T, I2ie employees of tile Company in K owe it shall at all times he British subjects or subjects of tne Sheikh of Koweit, provided that with the consent of nis Majesty 1 s Government such persons of other nationality as are in the judgment (or «pinion ) 1 e - C o rap any required for the efficient carrying on of the undertaking may be employed, n The consent of His Majesty 1 s Government would still be necessary to the employment of any foreigner and they would, in the last resort, have the last word. Mr.„ Stevens said he saw no objection if the interposition of His Majesty's Government were directed against the unsuitability of any particular person, otherwise than on grounds of nationality, but he remained of opinion that, subject to this proviso, the Company should be able to employ non-British personnel of any nationality up to 50p. Sir Louis Kershaw said that the employment of foreign personnel should be subject to the general proposition that if suitable British subjects were available these should always be employed, but Mr. Stevens thought that the Company should be able to employ other nationalities even if suitable British personnel were available. The possibility was considered of limiting the 50/50 arrangement proposed by Mr. Stevens to the technical and directing staff of the Company, but bothSir ,Lo,ui. G - xvex^biiavv and ...ir. .bTaser preferred to avoid any hard and fast percentage arrangement SA X . -^rsiiaw suggested the following redraft:- 'The Company undertakes that so far as is consistent with the successful carrying out of the undertaking their employees shall he mititon subjects or subjects of the Sheikh of Koweit. His Majesty 1 s Government may object to any employee and in the case of such objection being taken such employee shall not be employed'. The Company's representatives entirely agreed that Eis Majesty's Government should be able to object in any specific case to the employment of any person whom they regarded as unsuitable and M r. Fraser recognis :a the reasons for His Majesty's Government's anxiety that the Company's personnel should be mainly British, in view of political complications, but Mr. Stevens still objected to the general proposition that British personnel should be employed save by way of exception. The Bahrein agreement was again referred to. Mr. Starlin g and Mr. Laithwaite said that the Bail rain claus^ had not been entirely satisfactory in practice. In spite of the undertaking they had given the Banrein Company had at first employed almost entirely non-British technical staff though they had recently agreed to increase the Britisn proportion. Mr. Walton said tnat a rather stronger safeguard was required in Koweit where the risks were quite different. It was not reasonable to limit personnel enfciiely to British/Britisn subjects out Aiij* increase ox non-British employees v/ould increase at the same time the political risk and a 50$ non- British element might be much too large. His Majesty’s Government were not concerned with the nationality from the point ox view ox the working of the Company, but purely irorn the political standpoint. It was necessary to satisfy the Company’s desire for efficient working but at the same time to reduce political risks to a minimum and the latter desideratum involved the limitation of foreign parsormel. Mr. Fraser said that for the efficient working of the Company to might conceivably be necessary to bring in even 75$ of foreign personnel and he preferred the redraft of clause 3 which he had already suggested, but Mr. Stevens still objected to basing the employment of foreign personnel upon the necessity of efficient working. He would agree, however, to the clause in the Bahrein agreement with a modification to provide that the Company should be allowed to be the sole judge from the commercial point of view of the necessity for employing foreign personnel, subject of course to H.M.G.’s overriding power to object in any specific case on personal grounds, but not on grounds of nationality. Ho agreement was reached, Mr. Fraser’s proposed redraft being the most promising solution suggested. It was agreed that the matter should be further considered. CLAUSE 5. second -paragraphCIAUSS 4 . ^ r * elevens agreed that the designation of the Chief Local Hepresentative should be subject to the approval of but lie objected to the proviso that he should necessarily be o± British nationality, and Mr. Fraser asked whether there would be any objection to appointing an American if he happened to be the most suitable man* Sir Louis Kershaw said that he would see no objection to missing out the word 'British” in the first line of the clause if the Company satisfied His Majesty’s Government’s desiderata in respect of Clause 3, and it was agreed that this point might be left over for consideration along with clause 3. CHOUSE 5 . The following rear aft suggested by Sir Louis Ke r sh aw to meet the views of the Company’s representatives was agreed:- 'The Company undertake at all times to pay due deference to the advice of the Political Agent and the Political .Resident in the Persian Gulf and subject to the terms of the concession to the wishes of the Sheikh of Hoveit'. Chub SB 6 * Sir Lq uis Kershaw agreed to the substitution of the words 'may have been selected' for 'may be required' after the words 'any sites which' in line 5 to meet the wishes of the Company’s representatives. Mr* Laithwaite said his assumption was that the Company would first of all select certain areas i or their operations ana that then, perhaps considerably later, further areas might be selected .and that K*M.G. would naveuliG rignt 'bo CxioosG f 1 r g six sitJGs for bl'icii* own pnrposGs 'before the Company made any such further selection, Mr. d 'Gevans agreed with this interpretation of the clause. CImlISS 7 . £&gt;±i' Louis Kershaw said that the .object of the clause was twofold, first to prevent technical wireless interference, and second as a precaution against the possibility of the Company’s installations being used for commercial messages not connected with the Company’s operations. His Majesty’s Government had no idea of interfering in an arbitrary way with the Company’s domestic telegraph, wireless or telephone installations. Mr. Stevens and Mr. Fraser said that they would like the article redrafted to make this clear, but they recognised that Government interests should of course be over-riding. It was agreed to await suggestions from the Company. CIAUSE 8 . Mr. Eraser said that it ?/as quite impossible for the Company to accept this provision. He admitted that ideally and from the purely economic point of view oil should be refincdx as near as possible to the point of production. Unfortunately the oil trade was not conducted on economic lines in a number of countries but in accordance with certain nationalistic ideas and if these nations decided that, refining should be done in their own territory and placed substantial tariffs on the importation of refined products, the deman a would be mainly for crude oil. This was the present tendency in the oil trade and if the tendency developed it would not in the course of a few years be a commercial proposition to refine at Koweit. Sir L. Kershaw said that the clause did not confine the Company to Koweit and suggested thatthe Koweit oil might he refined in India. Mr. Frase said this v/ould 'be all right if they could supply the Indian market, hut in fact the Indian market was protected. The Anglo—Persian Oil Company and the Shell Company had agreed because of indigenous production not to put oil into India unless Indian production failed to meet local requirements. Sir h. Kershaw said that indigenous production could not supply the whole of the Indian market. Mr, Starling suggested that the Company under the suggested clause could also refine oil in Australia or in New Zealand. Mr. Fraser said that the Company might v/ish to refine in Koweit or in British territory but that they could not bind themselves to do so The principle of Clause 8 was so difficult that they could not possibly accept it. Mr. Starling reminded him that the Company Vv r as only asked to refine half their production in Koweit etc. The rest might be exported anywhere in its crude state. He said that local refining had in his view recently saved Trinidad from a serious situation since they were able to market their refined products when the importation of crude oil into the U.S.A. was prohibited, Mr. Stevens enquired the purpose underlying the clause. Mr. Starling explained that the intention was to make refined oil products available in the Briuioh Empire as widely as possible especially iu vie n of the small available supplies of Empire oil and agreed that in the last resort it was framed in order to meet a state of emergency. Mr. Stevens said that they were being asked to put up a refinery which the commercial situation might in certain circumstances render quite useless an Mr, Fraser added that the Company wanted the greate possible freedom to take advantage of the market. Sir L. Kershaw asked whether if we could assume thatthe present conditions of the commercial situation would be permanent, the Company would then see no objection go xne Clause, but 1Si\ Fraser said that even under present conditions it might be objectionable. The eosu 01 oil and the cost of refining were small m comparison with the cost of transport, loading and unloading of the oil and suppose their market were in China foi example, it was unreasonable to expect them to transport the oil first to India for refining. Ho agreement was reached and the Clause was left over for further consideration. CLAUSE 9. The Company*s representatives, subject always to their objection to Clause 8, accepted the principle of the Clause but said that they wished to suggest certain modifications in the terms of Annexure B. In answer to a point raised by Mr. Walton in connexion with the Commercial. Agreement vrith the Sheikh, Mr, Fraser and Mr. Stevens agreed that the concession did not cover the Koweit Neutral Zone and said this was clear from the map they had made of the area of the concession. The x-^sitmon as a result of the meeting was that general agreement had been reached except on the two clauses dealing with British local personnel and refining. It was agreed that the latter should be further considered in consultation with the Admiralty. It was proposed to have another meeting as soon as possible to settle outstanding points in the Government Agreement and at the same time to consider the Commercial Agreement. The latter was generally satisfactory from the point of view of His Majesty's Government but they11 . ndgilt have certain amendixients to suggest. Mention was made of the necessity of sooner or later adding a clause suspending the operation of the Commercial Ap-reement until the Government Agreement was concluded and mailing the former subject to the latter. flie India Office hoped to be able to let the Company have the official views on the commercial agreement as soon as possible, so that a meeting might then be held with a view to reaching agreement on all points before the Company commenced negotiations with the Sheikh which they were now anxious to do at the earliest possible time. T’ne points regarding the Government Agreement in respect of hatr had to oe lext over. *CONFIDENTIAL. No. ■A 205-S of 19S4.

Mr. Hearn « • Anglo-Persian Oil Company Mr. Yfakely said that Mr. Fraser and Mr. Hearn, of the A.P.O.C. had, he understood, been good enough to offer to attend a meeting at which they could explain to the interested departments ; the position and policy of the A.P.O.C. in the Gulf. The Company were of course aware of the general position, which was that the Sheikhs concerned were precluded from granting any oil concessions |without the prior concurrence of H.M.G. who had, while paying Special attention to the interests of those Eulers to consider | applications for concessions from all points of view. A statement irom the Company would, he felt, he of much assistance. Mr, Fraser explained in the lirst place that in Gyitar the A.P.O.C. were precluded from acting on their own benalf and could act only as the agents of the Iraq Petroleum Company oince Qatar was within the area covered by the I .P. C. Convention. Any concession would, however, if granted by the Sheikh, oe in the name/p-'' 11 2 . fCT^t I | / x the’A.P.O.C. 'fhey had reason to believe that the Standard Oil Company of California, a purely American Company who had already obtained a footing in the Gulf at Bahrein and at Kasa, were also interested in Qatar. The Sheikh of Qatar had entered into on agreement with the A.P.O.C. expiring in August 1934 during the currency of which the A.P.O.C. had the right to apply for concession “S giving them sole rights to work oil in Qatar and the Sheikh had undertaken not to consider the grant of an oil concession to anyone other than the A.P.O.C. This would not prevent the Standard Oil Company of California from making suggestions to the Sheikh meanwhile and thus making things difficult for the A.P.O.C. in their negotiations. Those negotiations had proceeded some distance this autumn, and Mr t Chisholm, the A.P.O.C. representative, had returned home to report progress in November. The Sheikh had, however, now suddenly and quite spontaneously intimated that he wished to see the A.P.O.C. representative by the 14th of this month for the purpose of further discussion and Mr.Chisholm was already on his way out to Qatar by air with a revised draft concession, ihe Political Resident would, of course, be consulted regarding the terms of the concession but the A.P.O.C. were anxious if possible to avoid the delay which would result if the Political Resident had to refer home for instructions on every point which might arise during the negotiations. Mr.Fraser suggested that a great deal of time might be saved if H.M.C. would consent to give their blessing in advance to the general terms of the revised concession subject to any reasonable modifications which they might desire to make, end which could be the subject of informal discussion ^ ier j|^ &gt; p^ aS er .,5 IMr, Fraoer then circulated copies of the draft concession ^which Mr. Chisholm was t aiding out to Qatar, Mr, Wakely suggested that the draft could best be considered department ally in the first instance, and this was agreed, Mr, Fraser, however, emphasising the anxiety of the Company that it should be dealt, with as expeditiously as possible, Mr. Fraser then turned to the activities of the A.P.O,C. in Koweit. Here the position was diiferent since Koweit was outside the area covered by the I..P,C, Convention, For some time past the A.P.O.C, and the American Gulf Oil Company had both been negotiating for a concession in Koweit, but hitherto the A.P.O.C. had been unable to reach any agreement with the Sheikh. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company were most anxious that there should not be a rival foreign oil concern in Koweit on the flank of their own operations in Persia and this was why they had themselves wanted to obtain a concession in Koweit. They had all along felt themselves at a great disadvantage in negotiating at Koweit in competition v/ith the Gulf Oil Company, a very wealthy concern, owing to the danger that by granting too favourable terms to Koweit they might involve themselves in difficulties with the Persian Government who might also accuse them of frittering away their energies outside Persia, ?hey had therefore considered it desirable to endeavour to make an arrangement v/ith the Gulf Oil Company. An arrangement of a nature which fully safeguarded the interests of the A.P.O.C,, to work jointly with them for a concession through a new Company to he formed on a 50/50 basis, had been signed, and now only awaited ratification, a decision as to which was expected this week. T he negotiations with the Sheikh if the agreement in question ratified would be carried on by Mr. Gass, acting on behalf of the A.P.o.C., and assisted by Major Holmes, on behalf of the Gull4* /67 ( ff7 Oil Company• Ii© poinuGd on'! tnici'b 'tli.c Gnlx Oil GompEiny w&amp;s one of the parties interested in the I.P.C. through the American portion of the shares of the latter, while the Standard Oil Company of California was not. On this point Mr. Fraser explained that the A.P.O.C. felt that they had a legitimate grievance against the behaviour of American oil interests in this area since the war. When, after the War, the Americans and the French were admitted to participation in the I.P.C. the A.P.O.C. had understood that the American oil interests would then be satisfied with their share in the I.P.C. This, however, had not been so, since the Standard Oil Company of California had later appeared and obtained oil concessions in Bahrein and Has a; they now threatened to come in also at Qatar. The Standard Oil Company of California (now established in Bahrein and Hasa) was an entirely different Company from the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (interested in the Iraq Petroleum Company) but there vfere occasions when these large American groups appeared to worb in sympathy with one another • Mr. Fraser suggested that the position would be very much simplified and delay avoided if the same procedure could be followed here as he had suggested in Qatar, i.e. if H.M.G. would he good enough to examine the draft concession at this end and make suggestions beiore it was presented to the Sheikh. He sinceiely trusted that the Company could look for the support of His Majesty's Government. Mr. Fraser then offered to give further explanations/explanations on any points in connection with either Qatar or Koweit which the meeting might wish to raise. j\£r. Wahely said that subject to the opinion of the meeting he thought there might be advantage in informal discussion such as the Company had suggested of the terms of draft concessions. This procedure had been adopted with advantage in the case of Bahrein. But it was important not to short-circuit the authorities in the Gulf. Mr. Walton and Mr. Laithwaite said that H.M.G. and the Resident both felt that they had been kept rather in the dark regarding the details and the course of the A.P.0.C.negotiations with the Sheikh of Qatar. In particular they had no clear idea of the financial terms which were being offered to the Sheikh for the concession. Mr. Fraser said that it was difficult to arrange the financial terms at this end and thought that this side of the matter could best be settled in the negotiations between their representative and the Sheikh of Qatar. He could assure the meeting, however that the financial terms were likely to be not ungenerous to the Sheikh. They might indeed have to be rather too generous from the A.P.O.C .point of view, since the Standard Oil Company of California had paid a very large sum for their concession in Hasa and this could not be without effect on their own negotiations. Mr. Starling said that the Petroleum Department would favour the adoption of Mr. Fraser’s suggestion for informal preliminary discussion in London of points arising out ox the draft Qatar concession but that if they were to give their opinion about any concession whether in Qatar or Aoweit they would of course have to have some idea of the financial terms since in some cases it was impossible to form an opinion whether the terms of a concession were fair without having tnis information. Mr. Hearn rA.P. 0 .Creminded the meeting that Ramazan started/6. started on the 17th December, The a.P o c representative was due to arrive in rv t . lu Q^-tar on the 14th so that if the Sheikh really intended to make progress with the negotiations for a concession there would be very little time to spare. tnwaite said that it was relevant that the Company's application for a concession in ^atar raised certain political issues which coulci not be disposed of without consul oat ion with India and the Resident, which would take time, e.g. the issue of jurisdiction, which with the Company the sheikh had already raised/ and the bringing into force of certain dormant articles of the Sheikh' s Treaty. kr. Fraser said the Company had no intention of agreeing to the exercise of jurisdiction by the shaikh over their employees. Mr. genae l suggested that on this point it might help the A.p.O.C. in their negotiations in Qatar vis : -a-vis the standard Oil Company of California or any other competitor if His to majesty’s Government were now/point out to the sheikh that certain conditions as regards jurisaiction over employees would apply in the case of any concession which he might grant, fir. Hearn saia that the A.P.O.C. understood that the Sheikh had lately asked the political Resident about the procedure to he followed if a second Company came along in search of a concession, which seemed to imply that there was a real danger of the standard Oil Company of California coming in at Qatar. • M?. 7/aiton referred to Article 12. of the draft concession circulated by Mr. Fraser which provided for the transfer of the concession from the A.P.O.C. to another party and asked what the position was as regards assignment and what the Company hau in mind. Mr.Fraser explained that this provision had been inserted oecause any/any concession would have to he handed, over to the I,p*C*, (in which British interests were represented hy the A*P*O.C. and hy the British element in the shell group). If a subsidiary company were then formed the A.P.O.C. would claim and would have a percentage of interest in it not less than the percentage (25*) of their interest in the Iraq petroleum Company. Such a company might, indeed, contain a larger British element than the I.P.C. if, for example, the French interests represented in the latter aid not wish to share in the new operations at Qatar. The A.P*O.C. of course wanted any new company to be as British as possible and he reminded the meeting that the alternative, that is the standard Oil Company of California, was a purely American Company. He mentioned that nobody knew how the Standard Oil Company 7 of California intended to market the oil which it obtained from Bahrein or Hasa, since the various Standard groups had never yet been known to compete with one another in marketing /N.B. 'The Petroleum Department state that there are several Standard Groups/ Mr. Laithwaite asked whether, il tne Qatar concession were handed over to the Iraq r'etroleum Company the exploitation of the concession would still be British. We attached much importance, eotn on general grounds ana because of the difficult question of jurisdiction that might arise, to i\oaping exploitation here (ana in Koweit) wholly in Brutish hands. i\fr. Fraser , said that the personnel of tne I.P.C. in Iraq was mostly British, since tnis hv*u teen found convenient by ull parties concerned, though in theory the other participants in the I.P.C. could insist/8. insist on personnel in proportion to their share interest in the Company. He mentioned that, over 52% of the material for the Iraq Petroleum Company pipe line had been ordered from the United Kingdom. He suggested that there was in practice no need for apprehension on the point. It would be better to avoid making specific provision in the concession, since that might lead other nationalities represented in the I.P.C. to claim the percentage to which their holdings entitled them. Turning to Koweit, Mr.Wakelv said he understood that the A.P.O.C. and the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate had first of all been negotiating against one another for a concession and that the latter had resigned their interests to the Gulf'-Company. The position now was apparently that the A.P.O.C. had entered into an agreement which was signed and merely awaited ratification to obtain and work a concession jointly with the Gull Oil Company on a 50/50 basis which would extend to exploitation as well as to distribution. Mr, Eraser said this was the case and that his Chairman, Sir John Cadman, had particularly asked him to emphasise at the meeting in case any criticism was raised that this 50/50 airax-gemenu with the C-ulf Company had specially received the blessing of , before the Company had entered into it. wr. Wakely said that the India Office had no knowledge of any such approval having been given. Mr.Rendfil said he understood that the A.P.O.C. had had discussions with certain members of the Foreign Office but that the Foreign Office had understood that the 50/o0 arranga.nnt was to cover distribution of the oil only s-'-'-i exploitation. Mr.Fraser reiterated that the idea/C-vJ. -U Q, iibument to extend to exploitation Iiaa teen specmcali? approved by H.M.G. He would If necessary write a letter giving further details if ripqiraH ^ ^ lx a ebirea. The arrangement vath the Gulf oil company had been forced upon uie n.r.u.c. because it was embarrassing for them to offer large sums of money in Koweit (where perhaps there was no oil) m view of possible reactions on the Persian Government. Moreover they understood that the sheikh himself wished for an international Company. He added that the A.P.O.C. naa also found that throughout their negotiations the uulf oil Company through whatever source were kept miormea of ail the A.P.Q.C. offers to the Sheikh and hcui in their possession full copies of the correspondence tnat had passed, while the A»P.O,C. received no similar information about the offers made D &lt;/ mie Gulf ail Company* In answer to a question from Mr. vV&amp;kely, Mr .Fraser oaia that if they succeeded in reaching an agreement with the Gulf oil Company the latter might easily allov. pci iooniidl at Koweit to oe even 100/6 British, but tnat it would not be politic for the A.P.O.C. to suggest any arrangement about personnel to the Gulf Company at tnis stage, since it would only lead to a counter claim on their part. The A.P.O.C. (as in the case of Aatar) thought it best to have no provision about personnel in their agreement with the Gulf Company. With regard to the employment of Major Holmes, wn °? rl s understood, was not entirely persona arata to h *M.G., Pa. Fraser assured the meeting that their own representative, Mr. Gass, would take the chief part in the/tiie negotiations with the Sheikh ana that Major Holmes vviio would, useiui on account of his local knowledge and influence with the Sheikh, would merely assist. He would he well looked after by the A.P.O.C. representative and in any case the alternative to Major Holmes would be an American. mr» haitiiwaioe said tnat it would be necessary to consider this Question separately, it would, he thought, be desirable that all negotiations at Koweit should be conducted solely through the Political Agent. This procedure had now been laid down in Bahrein in the negotiations between the Bahrein Petroleum Company and the Anglo-persian Oil Company on the one hand and the sheikh of Bahrein on the other, fir. Fraser said that he hoped this procedure would not be insisted upon in Qatar and Koweit. Indeed he thought tnat under these conditions the sheikh of Koweit would refuse to negotiate for a concession at all. The A.P.O.C. would of course gladly keep the political authorities fully in touch with what was going on. Hr. haithwaite said that there was no Political Agent at Qatar and that so long as this was the case there could be no objection &gt;o direct negotiations between trie A.P.O.C. -and the Sheikh, but he reminded Mr. Praser that this would A so apply to any competitor who appeared in Qatar, aid that we could not discriminate in favour 01 the i.P.O.C. in Koweit, where there was a political Agthit, die position was different and he dr a not see that mierlean interests could object so long as we did not discriminate against them. Direct negotiations might .ead to serious difficulty on certain points. He 'eminded Mr. Praser tnat the Sheikh was not able togrant, a concession without the consent of h.M.g. ot.ia that hitherto the Americans and the Sheikh had been allowed to negotiate direct and that if that policy were now changed it would have ami cXuremely oad enect both on the Gulf oil Company and on the Sheikh, hr. Wakely, said that H.M.G. could not commit themselves on this point and that the Department concerned, would have to consider the matter. asked whether, men the arrangements with the CrUlr Oil Company had 'been completed, the A.P»O.C. would inlorm of the position, hm. Fraser said that If Mr. Walton meant that the A.P.O.C, should show H.M.G, a copy of their agreement v/itn tlie Gulf Oil Company the A.P#O.C. would have no objection but he thought that this might be embarrassing for H.M.G., who, as Mr. Wakely had explained, had to consider the interests of the Sheikhs. In making their agreement with the Gulf Oil Company the A.P.O.C. had had in mind the protection of their own interests (in which they had, he thought, oeen very successful) and not those of the Sheikh of Koweit and it might embarrass H.M.G. in advising the Sheikh if they had previously seen the agreement reached between the A.P.O.C. and the Gulf Oil Company. Prom our standpoint it would no doubt be satisfactory if the sheikh received a substantial yearly sum, irrespective of whether the concession was actively operated or not. Any draft oil concession would, of course, be shown at once to H.M.G, In conclusion Mr. Fraser again emphasised the anxiety/anxiety oi the A.p.C.C. that nothing shoula, if pOboiDic, oe allowed to delay their negotiations at -^atar, ana asked wnether the Departments concerned coula aii opinion ubout tioe rovise-ci A.P#o C arait concession a s soon as possible. He hoped that fi.ivuh., subject to any reasonable amendments that might oe agree a iiere, woula feel able to instruct uie iceoidsnu to regard it with a favourable eye, fc.?,jyakely. said that certain major points had oeen raised which would have to be carefully gone into; out this would be done as expeditiously as possible. Every effort would also be made to examine the revised draft Qatar concession without delay, liio amendments desired by the Departments concerned could then oe discussed with Ivr. Praser by the petroleum Department and India Office. He wished to repeat that it was the concern of H.M.G. to safe guard the interests of the sheikhs; but that subject to this and to consideration of their own special interests and obligations in the Gulf they were naturally anxious to give any assistance properly possible to British concerns, hr. Fraser expressed the hope that all possible assistance would be given to the A.P.O.C., and added that he was anxious that the discussion which had taken place should he treated as strictly confidential. This was agreed.

As regards additional facilities to meet possible future requirements, the attitude of the Koweit Oil Company is, I think, an important factor. In their conversations with us they have emphasised their desire that we should, so far as possible, have selected any areas we may wish for defence etc. purposes in advance, and while the suggestion made by you in connection with the Qatar facilities, that the phrase 'any sites which may/ Commander W.A. lv:c Claughry, D3G. , MC., DFC., Air ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway, W.C. 2.may have been selected'* in Clause 5 of the Government Agreement snoula be strengthened, e*g, on the lines 'any oites which may be required' ? was discussed with tiioiii a few days ago, they took the line that the revised mordin &amp; vvoulu plane tnem in an impossible position# UruoSo, trio x ax ox c, the Air ivlinistry see strong objection, we uhin k it would d« desiraoie to take immediate steps to select the actual sites which will, in the Air Officer Conm&amp;nding’s opinion, be required near Jnaira odiu oUDaihiya. Once the sloes nave oeen selected the desirability of acquiring them ana also the site described in (a) of the Air Officer Commanding* s telegram of £6th January, as an Insurance against the future, could be considered. Pending a decision on this point it will probably be desirable not to let it become generally known locally that we may be requiring certain sites in the near future, since if the areas referred to by the Air Officer Commanding are not Government land the effect may be to put up the price against us. 4.

Mi. Jans on and Major Holmes came to see me this afternoon. They said tnat their object was to explain the present position in regard to an intercession by the K owe it Neutral Zone, as they thought it might be of interest. Major Holmes said, however, that before coming to the question of the Neutral Zone he wished to raise a personal question. The Eastern and General Syndicate had a private arrangement with the Bahrein Petroleum Company under which tney received a shilling a ton loyalty. In connection with the relations of the Syndicate with the Company it might be necessary for him to go to Bahrein some time in the summer if, as he now understood, there was a probability of considerable production by next June. He trusted that exception would not be taken to this. He would, of course, in no way be representing the Bahrein Petroleum Company or having any dealings with them save in respect of the separate affairs of the Eastern and General Syndicate. I said that I did not see that we could take exception to his visiting Bahrein on his private affairs. 2./K owe it Ngjutr al Zo ne 2* nifci y be recorded with reference to the remark made on this subject by Mr. Janson and Major Holmes that the suggestion has been made in correspondence received officially that the Arabian Development Company were in touch with the A.P.O.C. in regard to the Koweit Neutral 2 0ne ' -' ir * Cuarling has ascertained from Mr. Fraser that he has had no direct contact with Mr. Janson (beyond a telephone introduction of Major Holmes); that the A.P.O.C. (and so the I.l.o.) remain of opinion that it would be preferable if possible to sterilise the Neutral Zone, but that if it is hot to bo sterilised they would .•do their utmosl to secure a concession for it. Major Hplmes had in the last lew days sent Mr. Fraser a copy of a concession stated to have been submitted by Ydlibi to Ibn Saud together with some miscellaneous connected information. Mr. Fraser (who was naturally anxious not to give the Eastern and General Syndicate any excuse, in the event of the A.P.O.C. - I.P.C. securing a Neutral Zone concession, for claiming that the business had been introduced by them and so demanding a commission) had replied that he did not understand why this communication had been made to him, but that he wished to hake it clear that Major Holmes could be sure that if there w as any question of a concession for the Neutral Zone that the I»P.C. would certainly be competitors for it/ Mr. Janson said that the position was that one Ydlibi had obtained a letter from Ibn Saud in substitution for repayment of an obligation of £10,000 giving him authority to apply fop oil concessions in rotpcct of Saudi territory ether than that covered by the Hasa Concession. Ydlibi/3 Ydliln, who was working with one kwnyni had prepared a draft concession in respect of the Neutral Zone and had submitted it oo Ibn Sana. He hoped to receive his approval in the very near future (influential persons in His Majesty s entourage were interested) - possibly within a month. His intention was^ once Ibn Saud's approval had oeen ootained ? go raise the matter with the Sheikh of Koweit (who I gathered had not yet been approached) with a view to securing his consent also. Ydlibi's corporation was the Arabian Development Syndicate * The E. &amp; G.S. had a small interest in this corporation and so were interested in the fate of the concession. It was important lor them moreover to recoup themselves for their previous losses in respect of the Hasa concession^ which amounted to some £16,000 paid over to Ibn Saud, over a period of years, without any return. 3. Major Holmes followed this statement with a rather involved explanation, the gist of which was that he was anxious to make his personal position clear. He had discussed the position of the Neutral Zone with Mr. Eraser of the Anglo Persian Oil Company about a year ago. (The Zone fell within the Red Line of the Iraq Petroleum Company agreement, and could therefore be taken up by the Anglo Persian Oil Company only on behalf of the Iraq Petroleum Company) „ But the matter had not been pursued because it fad been necessary for Major Holmes to concentrate in tne lirst place on the negotiations for a Kuwait oil concession, and thereafter to return to his post in Bahrein, which he fad left in circumstances of which we weie aware. He hod remained in ignorance of any developments in regard to th Neutral Zone until quite recently, when, finding that Ydlibi' s/ iIdliM’s negotiations had proceeded as far as they had ? and iii the interests of avoiding any suspicion on the part of the Anglo Persian Oil Company that he had told them less than he knew when he saw Mr. Fraser ? he wrote to Mr. Fraser sending him a copy of the draft concession which had been submitted by Ydlibi ? and explaining rather fully the position as he now saw it. His sole object was self explanation. Mr. Fraser’s reply had been to the effect tnat he aid not know why this information had been sent him, but had also left the impression that the Iraq Petroleum Company were likely to be active competitors in the event of any concession being granted. The one idea of Major Holmes^of his friends was that as the Anericans had been allowed so strongly to entrench themselves elsewhere in the Gulf, British interests should secure the Neutral Zone concession and any assistance they could give towards securing this end would be gladly given. The E. and G.S. was wholeheartedly British. They had been accused in the past of having let the Americans in at Bahrein etc. That was unjust, since they had done everything possible to interest British Capital and had been forced for financial reasons to fall back on the Americans since no British concern would interest itself. Major Holmes added that at the time of the negotiations last year between the Standard Oil and Ibn Scold he Saudi Government had originally proposed to include the eutral 3one in the area of the Hasa concession. He had trongly represented to them the folly of action on these ines and the effect it would have on H.M.G. and understood hat as a result of this the Neutral lone had been excluded, e further stated that Ibn Saud would now have nothing to do 1th him (Major Holmes) in respect of any concession for the eutral Zone or elsewhere. In the first place, he though5. that Majar Holmes and the Syndicate had behaved dishonestly towards him in hailing to continue payment under their original Hasa concession, ignoring the fact tnar they had maintained those payments until they had spent £16 ; oOO in all without securing any return 6 secondly that when Xbn Saud had telegraphed to him to c0Rie 'kc 5 Jodda 1 ciS spring and had gone to the 'pains specially to invite him, Major Holmes, owing to the illness ojl his wife, had had to return to Koweit at very short notice without waiting for the King’s arrival. The King had resented 'this and regarded it as an act of rudesness and disrespect on Major Holmes’s part. Major Holmes was therefore in His blank books and could look for no support or countenance from him as things were. In any case Mr. Philby was entirely onthe side of the Standard Oil and would do anything possible to assist them. I thanked fir, Jans on and Major Holmes for their information in regard to the Neutral Zone. They said they would gladly keep us in touch with any developments and let us have any further information that they thought might be of interest to us. 4. .Relations with the Standard Oil . Both Mr. Janson and Ma jor H o lmes spoke in the strongest terms of the manner in which they had been dealt with by the Standard Oil. It is unnecessary to record the conversation on this point. The information given was consistent with that already received by us officially and did not add to it. 5./Qatar Major Holmes talked at length nr^ + ^ biie J Qatar c onoe s s i on . The ^ oa o t r ?^ e r 00n f u se ^ly xne gisu ot ms remark p? wo a about tE c v U « W B BAU a. Tne gisx or Ms remarks was that he did not know how far the ..nglo Persian Oil Company had so far proceeded; that he himself thought that he might he a v r eiy iioetiil a^eiit m securing any ooncession for thein^ but that there had been no indication of interest on their part in such a possibility; that so far as he could judge they would have the utmost difficulty in securing any concession 5 and that he thought their chances were at the moment exceedingly poor. The Standard Oil had made up their minds to get this concession at any price. Any financial offer put up by the Anglo Persian Oil Company would at once be capped by the Ameiican interests. (I understood him to say that royalty figures of Rs.7 or 8, and a lump sum down of a million rupees had been mentioned or hinted at to the Sheikh on behalf of the Standard Oil) . The Sheikh, when he discussed oil with Major Holmes at an earlier stage, had said that he would give the concession to yhiomever the British Government advised him to give it - in other words the Iraq Petroleum Company. Subsequently his attitude had quite changed, largely as the result of the activities on behalf of the Standard Oil of Mr. Skinner, the present Chief Local Representative of the Bahrein Petroleum Company in Bahrein, whose instructions were to leave no stone unturned to secure the concession for the Standard Oil, and who had not only one or two local agents in Qatar, but who, by judicious entertainment of members of the ruling family in Qatar, including certain of the Sheikh’s sons, ha,a eoC-blioh&amp;d himself with them. 6. The Sheikh of Qatar was an extremely obstinate and difficult old man and the son most likely to succeed mm «»a rather similar qualities. He was well-off, but nau to pay substantial sums (estimated at £10,000 a year) to Ion oaua.7 * Having intermitted payment of this rent to Ibn Send two years, he had heen sent for by His Majesty to Riyadh last sinlinei and, Majoi iiolmes gathered, had been warned to oe careful in disposing of his oil concession. 7. The Sheikh stood in great fear of Ibn Saud and would certainly be much swayed by an instructions or requests he received from him. Ibn Saud on his part kept the Sheinh in his place. As we were no doubt aware the uiieijin of Coital o southern ooundary was rather uncertain, and Ibn Saud had given him clearly to understand that there must be no activities on behalf of Q.atar such as investigations by the Anglo Persian Oil Company geologists south of a line which Major Holmes indicated on the map and which appears to be approximately that marked as the south boundary of A a tar on the Iraq Petroleum Company map of which copies have been circulated. He added that the eastern boundary of the Hasa concession ran south from a point approximately at the head of Dohat as Salwa to the 23rd or 24th parallels, v r hen it turned at right angles to the East for some distance. (Any such boundary would of couise be inconsistent with the line indicated to Ibn Saud by Sir P. Cox in 1922).Bahrein 3. Major H olmes was very emphatic that we had done ourselves a great injury by allowing an American to hold the post of Chief Local Representative. It was the object of common Arab comment. The Arabs were afraid of the Anglo Persian Oil Company as a Government organisation. They had no objection to a sprinkling of Americans. But they did not want any large percentage of American personnel* and the effects on our prestige of letting in Americans * and in particular of appointing an American Chief Local Representative in Bahrein were very serious^ The Sheikh of Koweit had commented to him on it and he understood that in Qatar also the appointment of an American was regarded as a definite victory for American interests and a sign that His Majesty's Government no longer interested themselves and wished to stand out. We should be well advised to secure Mr. Skinner's replacement, particularly as he was completely untrustworthy so far as oil negotiations went, and it would he impossible to keep track, for instance, of his relations with the Sheikh of Qatar.

The Mr. following point Stevens raised s were also discussed:- objection to Clause 2 of the Points for the Government Agreement. He said that the would conflict with the agreement 'between the Gulf Oil clause Company and the A.P.0.0, under which, if the A.P.O.C. decided to withdraw from the undertaking, tne Gull Oil Company would have lirst option on the A.P.O.C. share in the Koweit Oil Company. The point was left nor further consideration. 2. The Company's representatives were anxious that it should be made clear that the selection of sites for aerodromes by His Majesty's Government under clause 8 would not involve any alienation of oil rights, i.e. that His Majesty's Government's surface rights would not give them the right to drill or to authorise others to drill for oil. They were reassured on this point. 3* The India Office Legal Advisers had suggested a clause in the Government Agreement providing that the English Courts should have jurisdiction to determine all disputes relating to the agreement. Sir Louis Kershaw doubted whether any dispute could arise under the agreement which could be brought before any Court oi Law and the meeting was inclined to think that a clause of the kind suggested was unnecessary. This point was left for further examination by the India Office The necessity for a clause in the Commercial Agreement to pro vine that that agreement should not take efiect until the conclusion of the Government Agreement and snould be subject to the terms of the latter was also left for further examination. ^ The Company's representatives agreed that it was forHis Majesty's Government to determine to what extent the Sheikh shoii_i_d oc inj-Oimed oi the terms ot trie Government Agreement ana also uo determine trie time and manner of so informing him.f 2 or iota February 1934.

T'.W.l. 25th January, 1934 My dear teal. We had the meeting with Messrs* Fraser, Hearn and Stevens this morning, and put our case for suggestions 8 and 9 (refining and pre-emption). We found, however, that the Companies ? representatives were not prepared to meet us at all in regard to the suggested refining clause, which they stated was quite impracticable from a commercial point of view. Their argument was that of which you are already aware - that as a result of the extreme nationalism of governments in commercial matters nowadays, the tendency is for each country to seek to refine within its own borders the oil which it consumes by setting up tariff barriers, etc,, against imported refined oil; consequently, the Companies fear that if they have to refine 50% of their oil locally or in British territory, they will not be able to find adequate markets for it. clause, they were prepared to agree in principle about pre-emption in time of war or emergency. On the refinery clause, however, Mr. Fraser went so far as to state that, so far as the iinglo-Persian were concerned, they would have no interest in the concession if it was made subject to the suggested condition. consequently left over for further consideration. ^his gives an interval in which you can bring your influence to bear on the A.P.G.C. (the opposition came from them just as much as from Mr. -tevens). Perhaps by this means you will succeed in arriving at some mutually Subject to their objection to the refinery We did not yield at all on the point, which was satisfactory/satisfactory arrangement, and if so, we could then hare another meeting to register agreement. We were, as a matter of fact, considerably impressed by the commercial point of view on this matter as set out by the Companies' representatives. It has to be remembered, moreover, that we are not now dealing with the question of a concession in a British colony, where it is easy to insist on such a clause. But what is really important is that it certainly seems that if we insist on the clause, the present negotiations will break down. ibis would be most uhfortunate, because it would be far better to grant concessions to the K owe it Oil Company in -Coweit and to the A.P.O.C. in „atr than to leave these fields open for other applicants, which would almost certainly be entirely American companies. &lt;e certainly should not be able to secure their agreement to the refining clause, and should have the greatest difficulties in obtaining adequate British safeguards of any kind at all. It is therefore extremely important not to allow the present negotiations either in regard to (oweit or Qatr to break down will be possible to reach some agreement with the iuig lu ' Persian regarding refining. bhen you approac,. them you may wish to explore the possibility of some compromise. The following formula has occurred to us as possibly if we can possibly avoid it. hope, therefore, that it providing the basis of a compromise:- '8. fhe Company shall be left free to decide whether the oil won at Koweit shall be disposed of in the fora of crude oil or of finished products, but should the Company decide to establish a refinery to deal with Koweit oil. _ ft t _ * ^ shall be left free to decide whether the oil won at crude oil or of finished products, out . n uiid decide to establish a refinery to deal witi that refinery shall be established in ^weit that refinery shall be established in Koweit or in Br and shall be capaoie 01 p* and shall be capaoie 01 p* with the specification set out in ^imexure with the specification set out in ^nnexure Perhaps/Perhaps you would like to consider the above. The decision regarding refining which was reached in 1930 applied, I think, only to British territory (colonies and protectorates), and it has always been recognised that quite different considerations arise in respect of the independent Arab sheikhdoms under our protection in the Persian Gulf. I am sending copy of this letter to starling and Warner. (Sgd). J.C.

WAkFER* Walton Esq., C.B., K.C., India Office,INDIA OFFICE, WITEHALL* S*W* 1 , 30th January, 1934. d' Vie have now completed our examination, in consultation with Mr. Starling, of the draft of the commercial agreement concerning the ho we it concession. We have the following suggestions to make. Preamble and throughout : - Substitute 'Sheikh' for 'Government'. Article. 2;~ Add new sub-clause (C): 'The Company shall supply an annual report to the Sheikh of its operations under this agreement.' Article 4 :- Add at the end of the last sentence 'with the exception of such figures therein as he may be required by law to publish'. Article 5 (a );- Add after line 12 'the inhabitants of the State of Koweit are not prevented from taking their usual requirements of these materials, ana that'. Add at the end of 5 (A) (as a qualification of transportation/ raser, Esq., C.B.E., eputy Chairman, Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited, Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, E.O.&gt;/4 transportation by air communication or operation) the words 'subject always to any general regulations for aircraft made by the Sheikh”. Article 5 ..(13) : - Add after 'national emergency' '(as to which the Sheikh shall be the sole judge)”. Y, r e doubt the necessity of Article 6 (B). ho doubt in practice the Sheikh will appoint somebody to deal with the local representatives of the Company in regard to matters of a more or less routine character such as looking after the supply of information which the Company will render to the Sheikh, and if necessary checking measurements and statements of oil sold or exported on which royalty is payable. The provision in the Government Agreement that the Company's local relations with the Koweit authorities shall always be conducted through the Political Agent will not, of course, be interpreted as precluding direct dealings between the representatives of the Sheikh and the Company on such matters as the above. Article 7 :- We would like to reinsert in line 10 the words 'food supplies' before the words 'personal goods'. Three/Three lines from the end, after the word 'shall” before 'pay” insert 'in addition to the payments provided for in Article 3”. End of Article 9 ;-- (a) Insert 'with the consent of' before 'on conditions to be arranged'; (b) substitute 'the terms of such purchase or lee.se shall not be' for the words 'at rates not'; (c) add sentences such as appear in Article ? of the Q,atr draft, viz .; 'The Company shall acquire only such land houses and buildings as are necessary for its operations under this Agreement. The Company shell inform the Sheikh from time to time of the land houses and buildings which it requires to occupy for its operations, ana land houses and buildings previously acquired by the Company from the Sheikh but found no longer necessary lor its operations shall be returned by the Company to the Sheikh free of cost.' Article 11 (c) :- Substitute 'If the Company shall be in default under the arbitration provisions of Article 18.' Article 12 (B) (a). :- Add 'Producing wells oirmamm’wrz nr borings at the time of such termination shall be handed over in good order and repair and fit for further working.” jjojp - Substitute lor ”such working condition as the property then is” the words ”good order and repair and fit for further working'. Article 13: - Substitute for ”such working condition as the property then is” ”good order and repair and fit for further working 31 . It will be necessary to add at some stage before the agreement is concluded a clause to provide that it shall not come into force until the parallel Company- Government Agreement is concluded, and that its provisions shall be read as subject to the provisions of the latter agreement. As regards Article 3, the financial terms to be finally included will of course depend on the course of the negotiations with the Sheikh. But we understand that, as the Political Agent is to be kept in close touch with the negotiations and to be immediately informed of all developments, he will be informed of/ a Jof the proposals first made by the Company regarding the xinaneial berms, and of subsequent developments in the negotiations regarding them. Could we have a meeting on Friday, 2nd February, at 11 o 1 clock in Sir L« Kershaw’s room here to discuss the suggestions made above? Mr. Starling could come at that time. We could perhaps discuss the outstanding points in the Q,atr Commercial Agreement at the same meeting. Your»s sincer*e!y, (Sd.) J. C.

Mr. Walton's letter of 30th January to Mr. Fraser, No.P.2.723/34). Preamble and througnout . The Company agreed to substitute 'Sheikh 11 for 'Government'. Article 4 . The Company agreed to add at the end of the first sentence the words 'and a report of its operations under this agreement during 2nd year' and at the end of the last sentence the words 'with the exception of such figures therein as he may be required by law to publish' Article 5 (A) . The Company agreed to add after line 12 'The inhabitants of the state of Koweit are not prevented from taking their usual requirements of these materials, and that'. It was agreed that the clause providing that the use of transport by air by the Company should be 'subject always to any general regulations for aircraft ^de by the Sheikh' should be transferred to the agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company. Article 5 (Bj/JW&gt; 5 &lt; B) • « was agreed that the clause ^ providing that the Sheikh should be the sole judge whether a national emergency existed should be transferred to the a o ve rnme nt agr e e me nt. Article 6 (3) In view of the fact that the article would be qualified by Clause 4 of the Government agreement the Government representatives agreed to this article wi oh tne addicion at the end of the words M to the Sheikh’ 1 . I c was agreed that a sentence should be added in Clause 4 of the Government agreement to the effect that the arrangement contemplated in the second sentence of the Clause would not prevent the Sheikh's representative from dealing direct with the Company on minor routine matters. Article 7. The Government representatives agreed not to press for the re-insertion in line 10 of the words 'food supplies”. Some discussion took place on the question whether something should be paid by the Company for exemption from taxation before the time when commercial production was declared, but it was agreed that no payment need be made by the Company under this head on the understanding that the value of the exemption was taken into account in fixing the amount of the dead rent in Article 3 (b) . Tne Company's representatives explained that they proposed go offer the Sheikh 65 thousand rupees per annum (Article 5 \b)j before and 200 thousand rupees per annum after (Article n (e)) commercial production was declared. Article 9 . The Company agreea. (a) to insert 'with the consent of' before 'on 7] (b)/ conditions to be arranged”.o. (b) to substitute 'the terms of such purchase or lease shall not he' for the words 'at rates not'. (c; and bo add at the end of the article:- 'The Company shall acquire only such land, houses and builuings as are necessary lor its operations under this agreement. The Company shall inform the Sheikh from time to time of the land, houses and buildings which it requires to occupy for its operations, and land, houses and building previously acquired by the Company from the Sheikh but found no longer necessary for its operations shall be returned by the Company to the Sheikh at a irrice not greater than the price previously paid by the Company for them'. Article 11 (o) The Company agreed to substitute for this clause the words 'If the Company shall be in default under the arbitration provisions of Article 18'. Article 12 (B ) The Company agreed to substitute at the end of (a) after 'free of cost' and before 'but' the sentence 'Producing wells or borings at the time of such termination shall be handed over in reasonably good order and repair', and to substitute the same sentence in (b) for the words 'in such working condition as the property then is'. Article 13 . The Company agreed to the same alteration here as in Article 12 (B) (o). The Companynagreed that before the signature of the Commercial Agreement with the Sheikh a clause should oe added either in the Commercial Agreement or m the Government Agreement, or possibly in both, providing that the Commercial ;reement/ A ry*Agreement should not take effect until the Government Agreement had been concluded and that the terms of the Commercial Agreement should be subject to the terms of the Government Agreement. It was decided that meanwhile His Majesty's Government should seek legal advice as to the agreement in which this clause should appear and whether the Sheikh would have legal grounds for objecting to the Commercial Agreement if it were in some manner qualified by a Government Agreement of which he did not know the terms The Company agreed that the Political Agent would be kept in close touch with their negotiations with the Sheikh and immediately informed of the result of all meetings and of all developments including any alteration in the financial terms offered. II. The following are the conclusions of the meeting as regards the agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Kov/eit Oil Company. 1. Sir Louis Kershaw said that he would agree to tne substitution of 'British Empire' for 'United Kingdom' m this clause subject to agreement on clause 3. 2. This clause was agreed. 3.

It was pointed out to the Company's representativesthat the Air Ministry had raised objection to the substitution in line o of the wends n haYe been previously selected” for the words 'be required”. Mr. Fraser and Mr. Stevens strongly represented the difficult position in which the Company might be placed if this alteration were not made, since* under the article in its present form* they might he called upon by His Majesty's Government to vacate an area on which they had already commenced operations. It was agreed that the matter should be further considered with the Air Ministry. Subject to the concurrence of the Admiralty it was agreed to add after 'harbours” in line 11 ”as may be developed by the Sheikh or His Majesty's Government' and to add at the end of the clause the sentence 'Harbours developed y the Company shall be for its exclusive use'. ♦ The following redraft of this clause was agreed abject to a reference to the Communications Sub-Commit tee i the Committee of Imperial Defence 'telegraph, wireless and telephone installation^* i any, maintained by the Company shall be for use only in ts business and as provided in the concession* and shall e so constructed and operated that their operations snail ot interfere with the operations of such wireless, telegraph r telephone installations as may be established by tne beikh or His Majesty's Governinent' . • The following redraft was agreed: - 'The Company declare that it is their inteumc! , twuld they consider that commercial conditions ° erect a refinery at Kovveit.
