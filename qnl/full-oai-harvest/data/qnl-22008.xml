Dow also states that William Bruce has reportedly left Bombay with six vessels, for the purpose of the points in dispute between the Honourable Company and the Arab Government at Mocka. Dow also reports that a considerable reinforcement of troops has lately arrived at Bussora [Basra] from Bagdad [Baghdad], which he predicts will restore order and tranquility to that place. Dow concludes by relaying news that a revolution has taken place at Naples.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054291.0x00006a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
