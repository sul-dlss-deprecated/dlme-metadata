I’tela-us-Saltaneh, a cousin of Mushir-ed-Dowleh, is a nonentity, who has served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the interior, and the Persian Legation at Vienna. He was Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s “ chef de cabinet ” during the latter’s last premiership. Musaddigh-us-Saltaneh is a son of Vazir-i-Dafter and of a sister of Farman Farma. He was hostile to his cousin, Nusret ed-Dowleh, and to Vosough-ud-Dowleh. He is also a half-brother of Hishmet-ud-Dowleh. He was formerly Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Finance. He has taken a law degree in France, and this is perhaps his only qualification for the Ministry of Justice. He has no political influence, and does not appear to enjoy much popularity. He left Tehran in 1919 to see his children in Switzerland. He recently endeavoured to return to Tehran by the Caucasus, but, owing to Bolshevik progress, was unable to proceed further than Tiflis. Thence he appears to have returned to Paris. PERSIA. [August 30.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 3. [C 5122/82/34] No. 1. (No. 106.) My Lord, Mr. ’Norman to Earl Curzon.—(Received August 30.)

H. C. NORMAN. [4044 gg —3][This Document is the Prop erty of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.} PERSIA. [January 11.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [E 541/541/34] No. 1. Mr. Norman to Earl Gurzon.—(Received January 11, 1921 ) (No. 161.) My Lord, Tehran, November 16, 1920. AS I had the honour to report in my telegram No. 745 of the 14th instant, Sipahdar-i-A’zam presented his Cabinet to the Shah on the previous day. The time which had elapsed since the resignation of the previous Government had been longer than a fortnight, the chief reason of the delay having been the desire of the new Prime Minister to be sure of receiving enough financial support to enable the Government to carry on the administration of the country for a month or two after the funds already at his disposal would have been exhausted. The choice of his colleagues was also necessarily the subject of a good deal of discussion between Sipahdar and myself, and during the course of our conversations on this question I impressed on him the importance of including in his Cabinet at least two or three individuals who enjoy the support of the democratic element and command influence in the Medjliss. The following is the list of the new Cabinet (where numbers occur after the names they refer to sections of Mr. Churchills “ Biographical Notices of Persian Statesmen and Notables,” edition of September 1909):— 1. President of the Council and Minister of Interior: Sipahdar A’zam (507, where he appears under his former title of Sardar-i-Mansur). Having been a member of several Cabinets ending with that of Vossough-ed-Dowleh, in which he was Minister of War till a short time before its resignation, his qualities and career are too well known to His Majesty’s Government to require a detailed description. He is not highly educated, nor a person of remarkable ability or strength of character, nor does he enjoy very great prestige, but he is straightforward, financially honest and a convinced supporter of an understanding with Great Britain. He is most agreeable to deal with. 2. Finance: Amin-ul-Mulk (Dr. Ismail Khan), like the Sipahdar, is a native of Ghilan. He spent many years at Paris studying for the profession of an oculist. H«y has been a deputy and Minister in several Cabinets, and has always been on good terms with His Majesty’s Legation, to which in the past he has rendered great services. He is Liberal in politics, and is respected by moderate men. He is said to be honest. 3. Justice: Mirza Suleiman Khan. He is one of those whose hostility to Russia threw him into the opposite camp during the war, and who fled to Constantinople in [date omitted]. He is, however, a convinced supporter of the agreement, and is likely to be a useful member of the Cabinet owing to his great energy and the support which he enjoys from the Democratic Party. He has been several times an Under- Secretary of State, but never previously a Minister. He played a leading part in the revolutionary Amgumans during the first Medjliss, and, while Under-Secretary for War, began serving out Government arms to the people just before the coup cTEtat of June 1908. For that reason he was arrested by the Shah before the coup JEtat and kept a prisoner at Bagh-i-Shah for nearly a year. He is a dependent and intimate friend of Mustafi-ul-Memalik, and his presence in the Cabinet may help to gain the neutrality of the latter towards the present Government. His private means are small, and he is not above suspicion in financial matters. 4. War: Amir-i-Nizam (498, where he appears under his earlier title of Sardar-i- Akram, now held by bis younger brother, the son-in-law of Vossugh-ed-Dowleh). He is head of the influential Qaragozhe family of Hamadan. He has not previously held office as a Minister, but was Governor-General of Kermanshah, in which post he did well, and of which he was only deprived to make room for Sarem-ed-Dowleh when the latter resigned the portfolio of Finance in Vossugh-ed-Dowleh’s Cabinet. He is not a person of strong character, but he is very honest and sincere and universally respected. Having been educated in England, he has always maintained intimate relations with this Legation. 5. Public W orks, Trade and Agriculture : Prince Abbas Mirza, Salar-i-Lashkar, son of Prince Farman Farma, who is well known to His Majesty’s Government. This [5330 Z-—2]2 appointment will not be popular owing to the great distrust and dislike felt by all sections of opinion here for Prince Farman Farma and his family, and to the reputation for dishonesty and rapacity which lie shares with his father and brothers. T thought it better, however, to include him in the Cabinet partly because, if no^ member ot the family had received a post, they would not have ceased to intrigue against the Govern ment, and Farman Farma himself, who is shortly to arrive at Tehran, would have used all his money and influence to bring about Sipabdar s resignation. This view was shared by the Shah, who is afraid of Farman Farma and his sons and by Sipahdar himself It was also necessary to take into consideration the services rendered by the family to His Majesty’s Government. In this connection I may observe that none of the brothers ever visits me without alluding to their attachment to Great Britain and to their fidelity to British interests during the war, and it may not therefore be out of place to mention that their devotion has by no means been so wholehearted as they pretend, and that it has already been exceedingly well rewarded. All the sons have held and profited by lucrative appointments, while Farman Farma himself, thanks to British influence, remained for nearly five years Governor-General of Fars, from which, though it is the richest province in Persia, he contributed nothing to the public treasury during his term of office, but, on the contrary, constantly demanded and received financial help from the Central Government, with the result that, by the time that his oppressive and merciless spoliation of the population had given rise to complaints so universal as to necessitate his recall, he had added to his already ample fortune a sum commonly estimated at 1,500,000/. While constantly professing to the Legation his zeal for the British cause, he represented himself to the Government as the sole defender of Persian interests against our aggression in the South. He also entered into an arrangement with the notorious Nizam-es-baltaneh whereby, if Germany proved victorious in the war, he and his family were to be protected from the consequences of their support of the Allies, while, in the contrary event, he was to render a similar service to the other party to the bargain, an undertaking which, however, he has been unable to carry out. A prominent and respected member of the British community here has seen the corre spondence embodying this agreement. Salar-i-Lashkar himself is the son-in-law of Nizam-es-Saltaneh and, when the Turks invaded North-West Persia, threw in his lot with his father-in-law and with them and left his own country for Bagdad. The other members of the family, however, remained constant in their support of the Allies. Sipahdar originally intended to offer to Salar-i-Lashkar the post of Minister of Justice, because, as he quaintly said, since there was nobody in that department who was not a thief, the new Minister would find himself in his element. I opposed this suggestion because I felt that the appointment would afford Salar-i-Lashkar too frequent opportunities for peculation, and suggested that he should become Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. Sipahdar, in his turn, rejected this proposal, saying that it would be too dangerous to have a member of Farman Farma’s family in control of the telegraphs, which offer great facilities for mischief and intrigue. 6. Posts and Telegraphs: Sardar-i-Mulamid (510).—He is a cousin of Sipahdar, who insisted on his inclusion in the Cabinet in order to content their family who, he asserted, would otherwise not allow him a moment’s peace. I opposed the appointment of Sardar-i-Mutamid because, though he is most friendly to Great Britain and I have a great personal liking for him, he is a man of small capacity and without influence of any kind, so that his presence in the Government will gain no support for them from any quarter. I gave way, however, on this point because the Sipahdar showed so much goodwill in accepting my suggestions in other respects that I felt that further resistance would appear ungracious. 7. Public Instruction: Vahid-ul-Mulk.— I insisted very strongly on his inclusion m the Government on account of his energy, his influence with the Democratic Party which will enable him to be of the greatest assistance in furthering the cause of the agreement m the Medjliss, and of his strong British sympathies. He was for some time assistant to Professor E. G. Browne at Cambridge, has acted as correspondent of the Times ’ at Tehran, and has been a deputy, in which capacity he strongly supported the financial reforms of Mr. Shuster. He was also one of those opponents of Russia who fled to Berlin or Constantinople during the war. I begged that he might be placed in the control of the Ministry of Public Instruction, partly because education is his speciality and partly because I felt that he could be depended upon to frustrate the attempt which I suspect the French Legation of making to obtain tho control of that .Department. I have no reason to doubt his honesty. nh witJ }out Portfolio : Nasr-ul-Mulk. —He is a member of the well-known Mukhber family, which has always been conspicuous for its friendship with Great Britain3 the only exception to the rule having been formerly the defection during the war of Mukhber-es-Saltaneh, owing to his hatred of our Russian Allies. Nasr-ul-Mulk has been nine times a Minister, but, he is not a man of very vigorous personality. Opinions differ regarding his honesty. Sipahdar originally destined him for the Ministry for .Foreign Affairs, but the heads of several sections of that department threatened to resign if the appointment were made, alleging (though this was not their real motive) that Nasr-ul-Mulk was not a person of sufficient importance to be accepted as Minister for Foreign Affairs in spite of the fact that he had made his career in that- department. It was therefore decided to make Nasr-ul-Mulk Minister without portfolio and to leave the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in the charge of his brother, Fahim-ed-Dowleh, who has been Under-Secretary of State there since Mushir-ed- Dowleh’s Government came into power. He will, therefore, for the present be acting Minister. I advocated this solution because Fahim-ed-Dowleh is both capable and friendly, and it seemed to me preferable to have to deal with him rather than with Ftela-ul-Mulk, an incompetent person whom it would have been necessary to appoint in the absence of a really suitable candidate. 1 must admit, however, that this arrangement has not availed to prevent the resignation of the above-mentioned officials, who supported the candidature of Etela-ul-Mulk. 9. Assistant to the President of the Council: Adib~es-Saltaneh. —He was Under secretary of State at the Ministry of the Interior in the last Government, who intended eventually to offer him a portfolio. He is a Democrat and has a reputation for honesty. He was also one of the so-called Muhajerin. 10. Vice-Minister of the Interior : Adl-ul-Midk. —He is a member of the Democratic Party and was Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of the Interior during a part of Vossugh-ed-Dowleh’s term of office, but quarrelled with the latter, who banished him to Kasvin, whence he went to Europe. He is believed to be honest. Sipahdar was anxious to include in his Cabinet some of the exiles of Kashan, and up to the last moment it appeared probable that Motashem-es-Saltaneh would accept the portfolio of Foreign Affairs, and Mumtaz-ul-Mulk, who became Minister of Justice in the last Cabinet only a few r days before its fall and was doing very well in that capacity, would be appointed Minister without portfolio. Both, however, refused office, the former because, havdng lately been threatened with blindness and being still unable to use his eyes, he feels unequal to the task ; and the latter because, having been a member of a Government which resigned on the question of the dismissal of Russian officers, he finds it difficult to serve under a chief whose first act of which has been to carry out that policy. I did not oppose the suggested appointments, because I felt that the support which the two persons in question could have gained for the Government was well worth having, and because, as I have already explained, the four exiles, with the possible exception of Musteshar-ed-Dowleh, are not, as His Majesty’s Government still .appear to imagine, hostile to Great Britain. They were, indeed, strongly opposed to the methods of Yossugh-ed-Dowleh and no doubt intrigued against his Government up to the time when he sent them to Kashan, but when once he had fallen their motive for thwarting British policy disappeared. Sipahdar and I were agreed on the necessity in obtaining for the Government the greatest possible amount of support in the Medjliss, and early in our negotiations I suggested to him that, with fhis object, he should offer a place in his Cabinet to Sardar-i-Mu’azzam, one of the deputies for Khorassan, who commands considerable support in the Assembly and is a person of much energy and courage. Sipahdar, unfortunately, approached Sardar-i-Mu’azzam before consulting his colleagues, and when he found that several of them opposed the appointment (for Sardar-i-Mu’azzam has many .enemies) he withdrew the offer, with the result that Sardar-i-Mu’azzam, considering himself slighted, announced his intention of doing all in his power to upset the Government as soon as the Medjliss met. The matter, however, was finally settled through my mediation by an undertaking on the part of Sipahdar to admit Sardar-i- Mu’azzam to the Cabinet as Minister without portfolio in a fortnight’s time, an arrangement which the latter reluctantly accepted. The Government of Sipahdar deserve the fullest support of His Majesty’s Govern ment, but the majority of observers do not predict for them a long term of office, and it is possible that, in spite of all the help wBich I can give them, the Medjliss may refuse them a vote of confidence. If that happens, my present intention is to advise the Shah to send for G ava 'm-es- Saltaneh, who for some time past has occupied with conspicuous success the post of4 Governor-General of Khorassan. He is a younger 1 ’ ro ^ 1 ^^ 0 ^snlayed^n W Ws’ best shares many of the remarkable qualities k S a is \ carce i y better than that of days, but unfortunately his record for financial integrity is scarce y the that if Q avam .es-Saltaneh had been on the s P ot » T His Majesty to summon him at once instead of entrusting o e P iourney forming a Government, but the delay which would have been nvoW m his^ jomne^ from Meshed might have proved injurious to the welfare of the c ^ ^ moreover have been necessary to negotiate with him befoieha y ^ g ^ - f a would not only have prolonged the interregnum, but would have bee “ unsatisfactory more especially since, as I understand, his relations -b - k ' gene^wrently^pointed ar^ not of the best, so that it would have been ddEcult to use the latter as an intermediary.

He was Governor Elect of the G-ulf P°Hs. , Nayyir-ul-Mulk was in the last Cabinet of Mushir-ed-Dowleh (see my despatch No. 106 of the 8th July, 1920). He was appointed with a view to conciliate Mukhber-us-Sultaneh, Governor-General of Tabriz, to whom he is closely elated and the influential family to which he belongs. His appointment like that of Mudir-ul-Mulk, is also very agreeable to the French Legation. He is holiest and friendly.

Some reside winter and summer near Ram Hurmuz and on the banks of the Jarahi River ; others are in Fars, during winter in the Buluk-i-Sabah, Rudan and Ahmadi districts, during summer in Bunat, Runkuri, etc. The members of the tribe speak Persian and Turkish. This tribe is subdivided into two prin cipal branches or sub-tribes, Jabbarah and Shaibani, the Jabbarah having twenty- eight branches, and the Shaibani twenty-three. The Jabbarah Arabs are also known as 'Arab Quchi. From ancient times until 1881 the Chiefs of the 'Arabs were of the Shaibani branch, and frequently the Basari tribe was also under them. In the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Chief was Mir Isma’ilKhan Saibani; he was succeeded by his son Mir Mahdi Khan, who served Nadir Shah and was also Chief of the Basaris. Under Karim Khan Zand, Mir Salim Khan, son of Mir Mahdi Khan, succeeded his father as Chief of the 'Arabs, while his brother, Mir Shafi Khan, became Chief of the Basaris.

In 1907, the charge of the tribe was taken away from Qavam-ul-Mulk by Mu'ayid- ud-Daulah and made over to Mu'tamid-ud-Divan on which the tribe unanimously protested and Amir Aqa Khan, Mansur-us-Saltanah, mentioned below, was appointed. In 1908, Mu'tamid-ud-Divan was re-appointed by H. I. H. Zill-us-Sultan and immediately murdered, after which Nasr-ud-Daulah was re-appointed with Mansur-us-Saltanah as his lieutenant.'' From 1837 until 1868 Ali Quli Khan, son of 'Abbas Khan, was Chief; he was killed in the latter year, near Darab, by some of his own people whom he was pursuing in order to recover some horses which they had stolen from Darab Khan Qashqai.

Burazjan.—Khan of—Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh—some years ago took over the government of Burazjan from his aged father. He and his father acquired great wealth from blackmail on the caravans passing through Burazjan, especially from monopolies of the sale of grain to animals. He had to take to the Gisakun mountains when Ijlal-ud-Dauleh, the Wazir of Ears, attacked the chief of Dash- tistan, but returned later. He is married to a daughter of Isma’il Khan of Shaban- kareh, but the bitterest blood-feud reigns between him and this Khan on account of the district of Zira, which formerly was farmed by one of the Khans of Buraz jan, but has for 15 years been let by Nizam-us-Sultaneh to the Khan of Shaban- kareh. Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh has repeatedly tried to have his father-in-law evicted and himself given the lease. Constant bloodshed goes on between Shaban- kareh, Zira and Burazjan on these accounts, and raids are common. A further cause of hostility was his seizure and imprisonment in the autumn of 1911 of his cousin Mirza ’Ali Khan and the latter’s sons on a charge of conspiracy : Mirza ’Ali Khan’s sister being wife of Isma’il Khan of Shabankareh. Ghazanfar-us- Sultaneh has been noted for his oppression of caravans, and for his hostility to the British in 1909 and again in 1911, when he was actively stirring up agitation both before and after the passage of the Central India Horse. Outwardly fair spoken, he is a difficult man with whom to deal; he is the most noted buyer of and dealer in smuggled arms and ammunition among the headmen of the Bushire littoral and hinterland. In 1913 co-operated with gendarmes in stopping rahdari. In March, 1915, reported to have joined with Khans of Shabankareh and Chah Kutah, and Pvais ’Ali of Tangistan against Haidar Khan of Hay at Davud (q. v.).21 Mirza Muhammad Khan.-Ghazanfar Sultaneh of Borasjun.

Bushire District (Khans of)— Angali.—Ahmad Khan, son of 'Abbas Khan, aged about 30, is the here ditary Khan. He pays revenue of 10,000 Qrans to the Governor of Bushire. Ahmad Khan is a stout supporter of the Shif route from Bushire inland, as the caravans proceeding that way pass through his territory and he can levy toll. He is usually hard up. Bandar Rig.—Haidar Khan, son of Khan 'Ali Khan, is hereditary Khan* His two brothers Muhammad Khan (aged about 35) and Husain Quli Khan (aged about 30) are the Khans of Hayat Baud and Rudillah respectively. The three brothers pay a revenue of 17,950 Qrans to the Governor of Gulf Ports for the three districts. Haidar Khan takes an active share in the arms traffic and is said to have made a large fortune thereby. Burazjan.—Mirza Husain Khan is Khan at present. He pays a revenue of 65,000 Qrans; sometimes his district is under the Gulf Ports Government and sometimes under Fars. He is said to have amassed a considerable fortune principally by the levy of Rahdari and other illegal imposts on caravans ; he is believed to have invested some 10,000 Tumans with the Bushire firm of Haji Ghulam 'Ali Buraz- jani. Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh was the Khan of Burazjan in 1911-12, Was very anti-British, and at the bottom of much of the trouble.Chakutah.—Shaikh Husain, son of Shaikh Ahmad, aged about 45 to 50, is the hereditary Shaikh and belongs to the Arab tribe Dovasar. He is in constant feud with Ahmad Khan, Angali, chiefly on the merits of the Shif and Ahmadi routes inland from Bushire. Shaikh Husain is naturally strongly in favour of the latter route which passes through his territory. He has made a good deal of money by levying illegal dues “ 'Allah,” etc., on caravans also by keeping a depot for arms for the use of arms smugglers. He is reputed to be worth some 20,000 Tumans. Speaks a little French. Dashti.-Jamal Khan, aged about 60, son of Haidar Khan, is hereditary Khan of this district, and his brother Ah Khan is Khan of Boshakun. Jamal Khan is supposed to pay Qrans 10,500 to the Persian Gov ernment. Sometimes his district is under the Pars Government and sometimes under the Gulf Ports. Either local Government finds it difficult to recover revenue from Jamal Khan who is a tur- bulent person. Owing to lack of rain for several years he and his people are very hard up; numbers of the poorer classes have had to emigrate. Jamal Khan is fairly powerful and does not fear the Local Government. He has given the Residency a good deal of trouble by harbouring pirates and other offenders. His two sons Haji Khan and Haidar Khan assist him now in the administration of his district. ,,, Tangistan.—The principal Khans are Zayer Khadir and Haidar Khan of Ahram. The former has recently made himself the principal Khan in the district. He is supposed to pay 25,000 Qrans revenue to the Bushire Local Government, but it usually has to be collected at intervals by means of a punitive expedition. Haider Khan ot Ahram (aged about 45) has little power and only rules over a small part of Tangistan in the neighbourhood of Ahram and Khaviz. Caldwell. —American Minister at Tehran.

Hashmat (Amir).—The Amir HeshmaL whose name has been mentioned several times of late in connection with the fighting between the Kurds and the Russians in Azerbaijan, is a famous fedai, and has had an adventurous career. Three years ago he fought stoutly against the Russians in Tabriz, and when things got too warm for him there, he fled across the border into Turkey. Then, in the first Balkan War he joined the Ottoman forces and fought against the Bul garians. During his sojourn in Constantinople he was made much of both by the Persians and by the Turks; and I am told by one who knows him personally that he really is a very fine man, a real patriot, and fond of adventure. I gather,' howeverj that he is apt to think more of the “ fame and glory ” than of the real interests of his country, which, just now, at any rate, certainly ought at all costs to avoid “ seeking the bubble reputation . . .at the cannon's mouth.' It was undoubtedly for glory that the Jedai fought against Bulgaria. And now, doubtless encouraged and supplied with funds by the Turks and Germans, he has returned to Persia, and appears to have taken an active part' in the fighting round Urmia. Four or five years ago, by the way, he was Governor of that city, and it was reported that he “ amassed a fortune of 30,000 tomans in two months.' So, evidently, he is a man of parts.

They were allotted lands in the Jam and Bakharz districts, and their chief, Yusuf Khan, was given the rank and pay of a Sartip, with a service of Hazarah Sowars. After a short time about 2,000 families returned to Kala Nan, and the Persian Government did not consider it advisable to leave the remaining families on the frontier. They, therefore, moved them to Isfarain, where they remained some years. From Isfarain they were moved to Kanah Gushah, a village near Meshed. In 1877 Yusuf Khan was appointed Governor of Bakharz, where he built the village of Muhsinabad, on the Herat frontier, and settled a number of the families there. His son, Ismail Khan, remained with a number of the families at Kanah Gushah. Yusuf Khan died in 1885, and was succeeded by his son, Ismail Khan, Shuja’-ul-Mulk (q.v.). The Hazarahs in Khurasan now number about 1,200 families, who live in Kanah Gushah, Kanabist, Kalta Chanar, and Muhsinabad, in the Meshed and Bakharz districts.

Was attacked while With a column of Gendarmes on the Kazvin-Hamadan road by the Shahseven tribe, and was killed during the engagement; The Gendarmerie suffered consh derable loss and 200 men with 2 guns deserted to the attacking tribesmen. (Letter from His Majesty's Minister) Tehran, to Sir Edward Grey, dated 80th October 1915.) Hisam-lid-Daulah— Appointed Governor of Tabas, Khaf Gunabad and the Mahvilat of Turbat. The Governor-General of Meshed was annoyed at this interference in his province by Persian Government and submitted his resignation threatening to leave Meshed if it is not accepted. Has been informed that he will replace Shaukat-ul-Mulk, who has been recalled by the Prime Minister. Russian Vice-Consul did his utmost 2 years ago to dissuade and save him from going to Tehran. Russians are anxious he should be appointed Governor of Kain. His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Sistan, does not think he can be trusted. He is * closely related to the Baluchis and has influence in Sarhad. Not as much influence in Birjand as Shaukat-ul-Mulk. Governor of Sistan and Kain has sent a message to Sardars Purdil Khan and Khudadad Khan to raise forces and await further instructions, and if necessary send it with Haidar ’Ali Khan to Kain, and the maintenance of Sistan will be entrusted to them. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain does not like his message to the Baluchi Sardars, he considers if he robs the Deputy Governor of his patrimony and will not be friends with him, it will be better to trust the Governorship temporarily to the Karguzar who is hostile to Shaukat. Explains that he does not mean to trust the Governorship to the Sardars. They have only to help keep order, giving any support required. Servant of his visited Isma’ilabad and announced that their master favoured the Germans and that the villagers should not help the British,Hisam-ud-DauIah (Mir Ali Akhbar Khan).—Known as Hashmat-ul-Mulk until 1908, when he received his present title. Belongs to an old family of ’Arabs. The present generation is the eighth in descent from the founder of the family, Mir ’Ali Khan, of the ’Arab tribe of Khuzaima, which is said to have been forced to emigrate from ’Arabia to Khurasan in the time of Khalifa Harun-ur-Rashid, in the beginning of the ninth century, and was settled in the Kain district as a check on the turbulent natives of that district. The tribe remained wealthy flock-owners, and gradually increased in power till Mir ’Ali Khan, their Chief, became Amir of Kain about the seventeenth century. His son, Mir Ma’sum Khan, is said to have been in Nadir Shah’s service, and his grandson, Mir ’Alam Khan, is said to have been the man who deprived Shah Rukh, grandson of Nadir Shah, of his eyesight at Meshed in 1748. In the disturbances that subsequently ensued, Mir ’Alam Khan gained power and proclaimed himself Amir of Khurasan, but was forced to leave the country by Ahmad Shah Abdali. It is said that he was succeeded as Amir of Kain by Mir Isma’il Khan and the latter by Mir ’Alam Khan II, the grandfather of Mir Alam Khan III, Hashmat-ul-Mulk, father of the present Chief of Kain, and of the present Chief of Sistan and Tabas, who died in Meshed in 1891. On his death the title of Hashmat-ul-Mulk was given to his elder son Mir ’Ali Akhbar Khan; and a new title, Shaukat-ul-Mulk, was conferred on his second son, Mil Isma’il Khan, who like his brother Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, is by a different mother. In 1891 the Governorship of Sistan was given to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, and Kain to his half brother Shaukat-ul-Mulk. A family feud has existed ever since between them, connected probably with the partition of their father’s estate. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk acquired the reputation of being an Anglophile and to the Shaukat-ul-Mulk a leaning to Russian interests w T as attributed. These reports, hownver, arose primarily from their enmities to one another. The dispute over water rights which arose between the Afghans and Persians on the Sistan border, and Colonel MacMahon’s Commission to adjust the difference, brought matters to a head in 1902-03 when the political antago nists of both the Hashmat and Shaukat, working upon the suspicions existing in the Court at Tehran as to their loyalty, brought about their summons to Tehran, Both did their best to evade the Shah’s orders and the Shaukat-ul-Mulk died in 1905 still evading the summons ; but the Hashmat arrived at Tehran in July 1904, leaving his son Mir Ma’sum Khan as Deputy Governor of Sistan. After protract ed negotiations Muhammad Ibrahim Khan obtained his brother’s title of Shaukat- ul-Mulk and the Governorship of Kain in May 1905, which the Hashmat-ul-Mulk had endeavoured in vain to obtain. Resided at Tehran from 1904 to 1908 and tried very hard to obtain the Governorship of Kain from his younger brother which His Majesty’s Legation opposed unsuccessfully. He obtained the post in October 1908 by heavily bribing the Grand Vizier and others; but was dis missed by the Nationalist government in August 1909. Has two sons : In 1913 still in disfavour summoned to Tehran in August 1913 but refused to go : Shaukat went, while Hisam retired to the country, physically indolent.

(Robat, Diary A o. 38109, dated 9th Feburary 1916.)Jamshidi Tribe of Khurasan. —During the reign of Shah Kamran, the Jamshidi tribe numbered about 12,000 families and were settled, under their chief Zaman Khan, son of Qara Khan, in the Badghis district of Herat. Zaman Khan's cousins, Mir Ahmad Khan, Abdulla Khan, and Mahdi Quli Khan (sons of Jabbar Khan, son of Mahmud Khan), who were also Jamshidi Khans, were inimical to him. From Badghis the tribe migrated to Marv and afterwards to Urganj ; about 2,000 families, however, remained and settled at Kurrukh, and Khan Hazrat, the Amir of Urganj, appointed Mir Ahmad Khan as chief of the tribe settled in that district. Abdullah Khan was appointed chief of the Jamshidis in Herat, but he fled to Maimanah, where upon Allahyar Khan, son of Zaman Khan, took his posi tion. About this time disputes arose between the Urganj and Yamut tribes, and during these disputes Mir Ahmad Khan was killed. The Khan of Urganj then appointed Mahdi Quli Khan, chief of the Jamshidis, and conferred upon him the title of Khan Aqa. During the disturbances in Urganj, Mahdi Khan, who was anxious to return to his former residence, escaped and went to Andkhui. Herat was, at this time, being besieged by the Persians under Hisam-us-Saltanah, Sultan Murad Mirza, who, acting under the orders of his Government, persuaded 2,000 families of Jamshidis to migrate to Khurasan under their chief Allahyar Khan, and 'settled them in the Sar-i-Jam district. After Hisam-us-Saltanah s return from Herat, the Jamshidi families in Andkhui came back to Herat and settled in Badghis, under their chief Mahdi Quli Khan, Khan Aqa who was afterwards murdered by Sardar Ayub Khan at Herat. His son Yalangtush Khan, who succeeded him, was killed by Amir Abdur Rahman Khan. The Jamshidis who had migrated to Khurasan remained in Sar-i-Jam for six months, but, as the Turkomans frequently raided that district, they migrated to Kanah Gushah and Qarabuq ah, near Meshed, whence a large number of the families were sent back to Herat by their chief : and on this becoming known to the Persian authorities, Allahyar Khan, the chief, fled to Herat. On his flight, the remaining families were placed under the Raoti chief Isma’il Khan. The Jamshidis were then moved to Qushkhanah, in the Quchan district, where they remained for a few years with the Raoti families. Afterwards they were brought back to Kanah Gushah and Qarabuq ah. In the meantime Allahyar Khan, being displeased with the treatment he received at Herat from Sardar Ya’kub Khan, fled to Meshed, and became chief of the Jamshidis in Khurasan. They then numbered about 300 families, but this number was subsequently reduced to 150 by a famine which occurred in Khurasan. Allahyar Khan died at Qarabuq'ah and was succeeded as chief by his son Yulfiqar Khan. In 1885, half of the Jamshidis were sent to Paskamar, and the rest joined them three years afterwards. At this time they only numbered about 80 families, which is their present strength. In 1889 Zulfiqar Khan opened negotiations wi the Russians, whereupon he and the tribe were sent back to Qarabuq ah - He then fled to Russian territory, and his younger brother Muhammad A zam Khan was made chief. The tribe is now settled in Jalalabad and Raza Abad, near Shahan-i-Garmab, about ten farsakhs from Meshed. Zulfiqar Khan returned to Meshed, and settled at Shurjah, near Paskamar, where he lives at present. Aboqt 50 families of Jamshidi fled from Herat to Khurasan m 1893, and are at present in the Zurabad district under Sa’id Ahmad Beg. Tne Jamshidis have a service of 50 -owars. In 1906, all the Jamshidis, with very few exceptions, fled to Herat. They have been given land on the Persian frontier near Kuhsan. Ut their former chiefs, Muhammad ’Azim Khan is dead and Zulfiqar Khan is m Kandahar, the present chief is Qilich Khan who has a service of 50 sowars m Afghanistan. The remaining Jamshidis in Khurasan are under Isma il Khan Sistani, whose head-quarters are at Sarakhs.

Has several financial enterprises on hand ; namely, a banking business in Tehran called “ Shirkat-i- 7 Umumi,” the Ears Trading Company in Shiraz which issued bank notes, and a road concession between Astara and Ardabil on the North-West frontier. None of his undertakings have, however, so far turned out to be very satisfactory. The “ Shirkat-i-’Unrami ” is practically bankrupt, and the “ Ears Trading Company” had to withdraw their note circulation in consequence of the protests of the Imperial Bank whose concession they infringed. Is in the habit of tramping up claims against his friends, sometimes high officials, when they are in low water. When the late Amin-ud-Daulah was Prime Minister in 1897, the Malik was exiled to Ardabil. When Amin-us-Sultan returned to power in 1898, the Malik was allowed to return to Tehran, and claimed a large caramnsami in the middle of the central bazar belonging to Amin-ud-Daulah of which he obtained possession. Went on a pilgrimage to Meshed, and while at the holy shrine of Imam Raza proceeded un mercifully to dun Prince Naiyirrad-Dauiah, against whom the Sadr-i-A’zam (Amin-us-Sultan) had a grudge ; and who had been forced to take refuge at Nisha pur where he has lands. Besides appropriating to his own use the funds sub scribed to the “ Shirkat-i-’Umumi ” Company he transferred to a Russian subject named “ Vartmanu ” the concession for the Astara-Ardabil road which belonged to the Company a clause of which prohibited its transfer to a foreigner. He was impeached for this by the National Assembly in April 1907.

After prolonged inquiry judg ment was given against him. He was arrested in July 1907 but on his way to town bolted and took “ bast ” at the Russian Legation.

Mansur-ul-Mulk is friendly to Europeans and a pleasant man in himself, but is not in the prosperous circumstances he should be. His family have been from time immemorial rulers of the Guran tribe. His daughter is married to Daud Khan, which alliance has assisted him in maintaining his power.

Baba Khan became a favourite of Nadir Shah and accompanied him through his carm paigns. He was rewarded by Nadir Shah with the Governorship of Herat and subsequently of other provinces in Persia. He was killed at the siege of Bukhara. His nephew, Badbud Khan one of the commanders of Nadir Shah’s troops in Bukhara, was Governor of Abivard, but was killed by a Turcoman. Badbud Khan’s son, Aqa Muhammad Khan, who succeeded his father as Governor, occupied the valley of Daragez. He and his family have since maintained them selves against the Turkomans, and have remained hereditary Governors of the Daragez district. The present Governor succeeded his elder brother, Allahyar Khan, about 15 years ago, and has since then retained his position. The above Allahyar Khan is still alive, and has often tried to oust Muhammad ’Ali Khahfrom his position and to get himself reinstated Governor, but so far he has been unsuccessful.

Eldest son of Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah. Succeeded to the throne January 8th, 1907, crowned on the 19th of the same month and deposed 16th July 1909. It is needless to recapitulate the circumstances in which Muhammad Ali found the country when he succeeded to the throne. Parliamentary institutions had become a fiat accompli only a few weeks before, and the question was how would he deal with the situation. He had been brought up at Tabriz, under the Russian tutelage. He had governed the province of Azarbaijan shamefully, was addicted to success ive greed and duplicity and among other vices was a drunkard. The recent events in Persia have answered the question. He endeavoured by all means in his power, not even shrinking from the most repelling atrocities, to extinguish the popular movement for liberty. He began by employing courtiers of the type of Qaim Maqam and ’Ala-ud-Daulah for his reactionary purposes. He then turned to such types as Sa’d-ud-Daulah and Amir Bahadur and finally descended to giving direct orders to the roughs of the city. The murder of Amin-us-Sultan in August 1907 was attributed to his instigation, and he was only prevented from using violence upon his Prime Minister Nasir-ul-Mulk by the intervention of His Majesty’s Legation in December of the same year. He signed 107 elaborate addi tional articles to the constitution on October 8th, 1907, and took the oath of allegi ance to the National Assembly at his State visit on November 12th of the same year and a month later attempted the coup d’etat (December 15—20) which failed only to be followed by that of June 1908. Took refuge at the Russian Legation July 16th, 1909, and was deposed. Left Tehran for Russia September 9th, 1909, the new Government having agreed to give him a yearly pension of £20,000, and after he had transferred all his personal estates to the Government which also took over his personal debts to the Russian and Imperial Banks, the former amounting to some £300,000.

He was key-bearer of the Shrine at Karbala ; but having quarrelled with the Ottoman Government, he emigrated to Meshed, Is very friendly to Europeans but has no great following.Najjafi, A^a (Mujtaliid of Ispahan).—This Mujtahid is the terror of the “ Bihai ” sect and has more than once caused many of their numbers to be put to death by fanning the fanaticism of the “ Shiahs ” against them. The brutal and inhuman outbreak in Yuzd and Ispahan during the summer of 1903 was caused by Aqa Najafi and his followers. He was summoned to Tehran in 1904, and shortly afterwards was allowed to return to Ispahan. These proceedings very much resembled those of 1890, as described in the Biographical Notes published in 1898, which are quoted below. (Biographical notices, 1898). Aqa Najafi continued his fanatical activity in Ispahan after his return there in 1904, and will probably always give trouble to the Government, and be a source of perpetual menace to the peaceful population of Ispahan. Has received a present from His Majesty’s Legation in return for an undertaking to abstain from preaching against English Missionary work at Ispahan, of which he has always shown himself a violent enemy. From 1905 to 1908 Aqa Najafi did not take a very prominent part in Ispahan affairs ; but his brother Shaikh Nurullah gave much trouble. He brought about the dismissal of the Zill-us-Sultan from the Governorship of Isfahan in February 1907 and having again made friends with the Zill-us-Sultan intrigued with him in 1908, but made no effort to support the cause of the popular party which he pretended to espouse when the ex-Shah effected the coup d’etat in Tehran on June 23rd, 1908. Aqa Najafi, Shaikh Muhammad Ali; Shaikh Nurulla, his brother. These three brothers are Mujtahids of Ispahan, and sons of the late Haji Shaikh Muhammad Baqir, who was a very influential man. The first named has great influence and many followers. He interferes in almost every public affair and in many private ones. After the Zill-us-Sultan he is prob ably the richest man in Ispahan. He is the great ememy of the Babis, and has caused many of them to be killed. In 1889-90, he had a number of Shaikhis killed, although they were under the protection of Government troops. For this, at the instance of Her Britannic Majesty’s Minister, he was brought to Tehran, but was treated with so much honour, that when he returned to Ispahan his fame and power were largely increased. He and his brothers have more than once inter fered with Biritish merchants, to the latter’s detriment. They also twice caused European goods to be boycotted in the bazars of Ispahan. They are fair repre sentatives of the fanatical party of Persia. They have given much trouble to the British Legation at Tehran owing to their persecutions of the Jews. Raihanullah, Aqa, Saiyid (Mujtahid, Burujirdi—born about 1825).—Is the leader of the anti-Jewish party. Persecuted the Jews in Hamadan, 1896, and Jed that movement against them in Tehran in 1897.

(1892).—Eldest son of the late Mukhbir-ud-Daulah, Ali Quli Khan. The family, which is said to trace its descent to the poet Shaikh Kamal Khojandi, is well known in Persia, and a short account of it is necessary. It came into prominence with the present Mukhbir, ud-Daulah's grandfather, Raza Quli Khan Tabaristani, a son of Muhammad Hadi- Kamal, who was a Chamberlain of Aqa Muhammad Khan, the*first Qajar Shah. Raza Quli Khan was born in Tehran in 1800 and having resided for some time at Barfurush, in the old district of Tabaristan,took the surname of Hidayat-i-Tabaris- tani. When about twenty years of age, he went to Shiraz, where he served the Farman Farma, Husain Ali Mirza, son of Fath 'Ali Shah, and afterwards the princes Faridun Mirza and Firuz Mirza (sons of Valia'hd 'Abbas Mirza).

Has translated some European educational works into Persian but for private use. Elected deputy, October 1906. Took sanctuary at His Majesty's Legation with Sani-ud-Daulah on March 26th, 1909. Is appointed Master of Mint by the present Government. JHukhbir-us-SuItaneh.— Commandant of the Persian forces at Kirmanshah in April 1915. Went to Qasr-i-Shirin on behalf of the Governor-General, when that place was occupied by the Turks.I 281 Mukhbir -us-Sultaneh. —Governor-General of Ears. He was some years in Berlin and is very pro-German. In early part of 1915 he backed Wassmuss and the Gendarmerie against the British. Mukhbir-us-Saltaneh (Mahdi Quli Khan).—Brother of Mukhbir-ud-Daulah, q. v. generally known as Khan-i-Khanan, was some years in Berlin, and on his return thence was appointed Chamberlain at Court. Received title in August 1897. Speaks German, French, and little English. In 1903 he accompanied Amin-us-Sultan, Atabak-i-A'zam, on his tour round the world and travelled with him to China, Japan, America and then proceeded to Mecca, where he performed, the pilgrimage and became a “ Haji. ,, Returned to Tehran in December 1904* He is intelligent and well-read and plays chess remarkably well. Appointed in 1904 Director of the Military College. Took a prominent part in election orga nization in October 1906. Was appointed Minister of Education in March 1907, and Minister of Justice in October 24th, 1907. Reappointed to the same post after the crisis of December in tlie same year. Was appointed Governor-General of Azarbaijan in April 1908 ; took leave of the Assembly on April 28th and left the following day via Baku and Tiflis. Left Tabriz for Europe after the coup d’etat of June 1908, having proved a very good Governor-General. Reappointed Governor-General of Azarbaijan in June 1909, and arrived at Tabriz from Europe on 26th August 1909. Has marked German proclivities and is anti-Russian. Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh is perhaps not an ideal candidate for the post of Governor- General as he is rather too civilized for so turbulent a province as Ears. His nomination does not appear to have been received optimistically by Persians here, and impression of weakness has been given by his telegrams to local notables. My experience of him at Tabriz leads me, however, to believe that he is on the whole sensible and impartial, though inclined perhaps to overcautiousness. He is less lavish with public money than any other Persian Governor I have known. If I remember rightly, when he was at Tabriz he was slightly anti-Kawami, but if not pressed by Tehran, I believe he would be guided by honest judgment of the local situation rather than by prejudice. I see no objection to his appointment, in the absence of the old fire-eating type, none of whom I understand will come to Ears ; he and I were always on friendly terms. Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh’s family owns the greater part of Mashad-i-Murghab district: it will in consequence be of importance to him to be in the good graces of the Kawam’s Arabs who infest the district. It is obvious that a Governor-General who was not a land owner would be more independent but that ground scarcely seems adequate to warrant an objection against his candidature, which in other respects seems suitable.282 ftfukbhir-us-Sultan (Nasir Quli Khan—bom 1875).—Son of rtibar-us-Saltanab* General Isma'il Khan (related to the Aqa Khan of Mahallat), by a sister of Mukhbii- nd-Daulah.

A determined intriguer. In (1902 ?), he ap peared at Isfahan, and it soon became evident that he had not come there out of philanthropy to the Persians. Forsaking medicine, he devoted himself to the study of economic questions in Isfahan. He soon discovered that the chief cause of discontent was the unsatisfactory system of land tenure, and that the best method of extending influence was to work for a satisfactory solution of this problem. He accordingly commenced to farm the rents of the peasant’s lands in this neighbourhood, guaranteeing them undisturbed tenure under the protection of the German Minister at Tehran. He has occupied a house at Isfahan for the last ten years {about 1912). He started a motor, the first in the district, in which he tours extensively, among other places, to Shiraz. Pugin established some German Commercial Agencies in Meshed in 1913. Tried to establish himself as German Consul at Isfahan in 1915. On 4th February, 1915, Doctor Pugin entered Isfahan. His carriage was escorted by about 15 sowars from Naib Husain, 30 Juzdani sowars on his own pay, and a detachment of about 40 Gen darmes headed by a Persian officer. There was a considerable following of carriages but few persons of importance in them. He proceeded to a large house over which the German and Turkish flags were hoisted. By evening, the Ger man flag was torn to ribbons and has not been seen again. This fact has struck the Persian imagination. The Doctor gives out, it is reported, that he will drive out the British and Kussian Consuls and cause the Karguzar’s dismissal for fail ure to receive him officially. He was much chagrined by the refusal of the Governor-General to return his visit. Information from Ahwaz states that he had left Isfahan for Shiraz, and was then at Qumesheh (12th March 1916). At Siahsakht, about 40 miles from Semeran on border of Kashghari territory.

M. guns and 12 maxims, and Would send a considerable force to join Von der Goltz when the latter moved as he was shortly to do, on Kirmanshah from Baghdad. In 1912 he visited Mr. Lorimer, Resident at Baghdad, who described him as anxious minded, not a man of ability or force of character. Now in winter quarters at Badrai, several informers report that he has ordered his own levies for mobilization at short notice, also stated that he has warned the tribes of Luristan. Diverse motives are attributed to him some suggest collusion with the Turks. Others state that the Shah has ordered him to undertake certain operations. A mes senger sent by Lorimer to him was robbed on the way of his reply. He reports that Vali s present attitude is pro-Turk, he has been visited by Turkish emis saries and receives constant news of present operations, and is hoping for the success of the Turks, and also £70,000 and 7,000 rifles which the Turks have promised him.

Qarai Trible of Khurasan. —The Qarais are Turks, and a large number of their families were removed from Turkistan to Syria by one of the Mongol kings, whence they were brought to Fars by Amir Timur, and eventually from Fars to Khurasan by Shah Ismahl Safavi. They remained in theMerv and Herat dis tricts for some time, but afteiwards settled in the Turbat-i-Haidari district, which was in an almost independent state ill the early part of the nineteenth century. At that time they were a very powerful tribe, but gradually their number declined. This decline was the result of rebellion, continued persecution from the Turko mans, and famine. Ishaq Khan Qarai, who was then chief, gained great power and was in open rebellion during the reign of Fath 'Ali Shah. In 1815, he and his son Hasan Ah Khan were killed at Meshed by Muhammad Vali Mirza. The second son, Muhammad Khan Qarai, then rebelled, but was coerced by Hasan Ali Mirza, Shuja -us-Saltanah, in 1819. In 1829 he again rebelled and took pos session of Meshed ; he was subdued, however, by the troops of Ahmad 'Ali Mirza, son of Fath Ali Shah and Governor-General of Khurasan. He then remained in a semi-independent state, and never properly acknowledged the authority of the Qajars. After his death the chiefs of the Qarai tribe lost their former in dependence, and gradually the heteditary chiefship was abolished and the tribe was put under the Governor of the Turbat-i-Haidari district. Their leading Khans are Ali Naqi Khan, Shaji-ul-Mulk, a descendant of Ishaq Khan.353 Qarisbmar Tribe o( Khurasan.-The tribe is also called Fayui and Gliarih- zadah; but is generally known as Qarisbmar in Khurasan.

They are gipsie“ and iHs said that about 12,000 families of them were brought to Persia from’ India bv Bahram-i-Gur to act as singers and dancers. They are scattered all over Khurasan and number several thousand families. The whole of this tribe is under the Shah's Shatribashi, who collects their taxes and governs them through his deputies m each province. The chief in Khurasan is 'Ali Akbar Khan Sartio Meshed 11 ^ 1 Hashlm Khan5 n0W dead ’ a relative of the Shatribashi who lives at Qashqai Tribe (Qashqai chiefs of Fars).—The Qashqais have sprung from the great Turkish Khalaj tribe which settled in Asia Minor during the middle ages At the end of the fourteenth century, when Timur removed the Khalai from Asia Minor to Central and Eastern Persia, a great number of them ran away and settled in Pars, and from this “ running away ” (in Turkish Qashmaq) the part of the Khalaj which settled in Fars was called Qashqai, i.e., fugitives. They now number about 25,000 families sub-divided into 66 tirah (branches) each with a kalantar or kadkhuda. The chief of the tribe is the Ilkhani' and his deputy is the Ilbegi; the former generally resides in Shiraz as hostage for the good behaviour of the tribe, while the latter is with the tribe. The last Ukhani was Darab Khan (born 1829), son of Mustafa Quli: Khan, Sardar, of the Shahillu branch. His ancestor Isma'il Khan (son of Jani A'qa, son of Namdar Aqa, son of Muhammad Aqa, son of Safar A'li Aqa, son of Jani Aqa, son of Qazi Aqa, son of Amir Qazi, who flourished in the beginning of the sixteenth century) and his brother Hasan Khan were much trusted by Karim Khan Zand, and were chiefs of the tribe, but Karim Khan’s successors blinded Isma’il Khan and cut Hasan Khan’s hands off. After the death of Isma’il Khan, his son Jani Khan became Ilbegi, and in 1819 was made Ukhani. He died in 1824 and was succeeded as Ilkhani by his second son, Muhammad ’Ali Khan (born 1793), who died in 1851. Muhammad ’Ali Khan had married a daughter of Farman Farma Husain ’Ali Mirza in 1826, and left three sons by other wives, viz. (a) Jahangir Khan (born 1815), Ilbegi, who married a sister of Muhammad Shah and was commander (Sartip) of the Qashqai Infantry Kegi- ment until 1849, when he was appointed Governor of Darab. In 1851, on his father’s death, he became Ilbegi and was appointed Governor of Kazirun. He died in 1871. His son Muhammad Hasan Khan was Sarhang of the Qashqai Infantry, and some time Governor of Abadih, and lately Governor, of Bunat. His second son was Lutf ’Ali Khan, who was Sartip of the Qashqai Regiment from 1851 until his death in 1856, and left a son—Haji Muhammad Sadiq Khan. His third son, Haji Nasrullah Khan (born 1840), was Sartip of Qashqai Regiment from 1856 to 1878, when he became Ilbegi and Governor of Kamfiruz and Chahar- dangah. He died some years ago and left a son, Sultan Ibrahim Khan Sarhang, Asad-us-Saltanah (born 1870), who was Ilkhani for a few months in 1907. He visited Paris in 1908 and is now (1909) Ilbegi. His sister is the wife of Qavam- ul-Mulk and the mother of Intizam-ul-Mamalik. The eldest son of Jani Khan Ilkhani was Haji Hussain Quli Khan, who being of a quiet disposition, was thought to be incapable of succeeding his father as Ilkhani and settled in Kam firuz where three of his grandsons—’Abbas Khan, ’Ali Akbar Khan, and Baqir Khan—are now living. The third son of Jani Khan, Ilkhani, was Murtaza Quli Khan, Ilbegi; he died in 1833 of a wound which he received in an engagement with Government troops sent out to seize him.

His and his son’s Nasir-ud-Dowleh’s property has been taken over entirely by the Finance Department at Shiraz. He asked Saulat for men and ammunition but was refused. New Governor-General of Ears. Eldest son and successor to the title of the late Qawam-ul-Mulk, who was murdered at Shiraz in 1908. The family is very influential in the pro vince of Ears and the Qawam is the head of the “ Arab ” (that is of Arab origin) tribes in Ears. His brother was murdered by Saulat-ud-Dauleh (q. v.) and Nizam-us-Saltaneh (q. v.). In October 1911, on Nizam’s departure, he left the Consulate and became Acting Governor-General of Ears until the arrival of Mukhbir-us-Saltaneh (q. v.). From a note received from him on January 8th at Bandar Abbas, he asks for our assistance, he requires 4 maxims with instructors, £50,000 in cash and the following ammunition, 500,000 mauser presumably 7 m-m, 100,000, Martini Henry, 200,000 for gendarmerie pattern rifles (8 m-m mauser), also some dynamite and men to use it. He is sure with this assistance he can defeat the gendarmerie. Is descended from Haji Ibrahim I’tmad-ud- Daulah, Fath Ali Shah’s Prime Minister, who helped Aqa Muhammad Shah to overthrow the Zand Dynasty by throwing open the gates of Shiraz to the invading forces of the Qajar conqueror, but suffered death in 1801 by being thrown into boiling oil by order of Fath Ali Shah. The late Qavam-ul-Mulk had great influence and power in the province of Ears and the Governors-General appointed by the Shah encountered great difficulties if his interests were opposed to theirs. In 1902 Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah’s son Shu’a-us-Saltanah was obliged to fly from Shiraz owing to the late Qavam-ul-Mulk’s unfriendliness. He was, however, summoned to Tehran and then banished to Karbala for a short time. The family is still very influential in the province of Ears.

The other.Romanovsky.—Quarrel between the Russian Vice-Consul and the Governor —Monsieur Romanovski, entirely without justification, has written a most offem sive letter to His Excellency accusing him of having a secret Understanding with the British Consulate and of ignoring the existence of the Russian Vice-Consu late ! This because, on the 2nd instant, when Monsieur Romanovski was dining with him, His Excellency had received a note from me enquiring whether he had heard of a rumour, said to be current in the town, to the effect that a number of ghazis had reached the Frontier and a mullah was preaching jehad in a Baluch vil lage. His Excellency had not communicated the same to himself (M. Romanovski) and the latter had learnt on the following day that I had distributed all my armed guards about the grounds of the Consulate and Bank for the night. The simple reason for His Excellency's silence had been that he had refused to credit the story and that he had replied to me in a pencil note to the same effect, promising to make full enquiries in the morning. The Governor wrote back, to M. Romanovski, refusing to discuss the matter except through the official channel —the Karguzari—and suggesting that Monsieur Romanovski could not have been in full possession of his senses when he wrote so discourteously. The Karguzar is now trying to patch up the quarrel under orders from Tehran. Proved to have taken bribes.

Naus, at the present time Director of Taxes and Customs for the province of Brabant. M. Theunis, Inspector of Customs at Antwerp, and Mr. Priem, Controller at the same port, are the two other members.” In 1905, however, the Sa’d-ud-Daulah was M. Nans' most dangerous opponent. Speaks French and Russian. Born about 1840. Owns a large house in Tehran near the Mukhbir-ud-Daulah's town house. Was exiled in 1906 to Yazd at the instance of Mons. Naus who was supported n 0 | by the Russian Minister, and took refuge at His Majesty's Vice-Consulate where he stayed several months. His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires with considerable- trouble obtained from the Persian Government a note, dated August 25th, 1906, giving a formal assurance of safety for the Sa'd-ud-Daulah's life and property and permitting him to reside anywhere in Persia excepting Tehran. He there upon left the British Vice-Consulate. He returned to Tehran in November 1906 and took his seat as a member of the National Assembly. During December and January he led the Anti-Belgian Campaign in the Assembly which culmi nated on 10th February 1907, in the dismissal of Mons. Naus. He then started a campaign against the President of the Assembly with whom he had an old family quarrel, but not being able to dislodge him, retired from the house in May and placed himself, at the ex-Shah's disposal for the purpose of dissolving the Assembly. Two days before the Atabak's assassination the principal Mujtahid Saiyid 'Abdullah publicly denounced him as a traitor. If he was not actually an accessory to the murder of that statesman, as many confidently assert, he certainly knew that the murder was going to take place. He was appointed Foreign Minister a fortnight later, but on account of the strike of all the Foreign Office employees, who refused to work under him, he was dismissed fifteen days later. He continued to intrigue in the ex-Shah's interest for the overthrow of the Assembly, and was, to a great extent, responsible for the ex-Shah’s attempted coup d’etat of December. The people demanded his expulsion and he took refuge at the Dutch Legation in December 24th, 1907. In June 1908 the ex-Shah gave only guarantee for his life, person, property, and honour. He remained at Zarghandah, it tli$ near the Dutch Legation, for a few days and then left. Entered political arena with in December 1908. Was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs, 5th January was 1909. Dismissed, 30th April 1909. Was reinstated in consequence of strong nt, a pressure brought on the ex-Shah by British and Russian Legations on 9th May Khan 1909. Took sanctuary in the British Legation with Mukhbir-ud-Daulah on 16th He July 1909, and subsequently obtained protection of the Russian Legation. Left Qglisl Tehran for Europe under Russian protection in September 1909. Has a firm character but is not above peculation. Proposed by Russia as Regent, September 1912. That the return of Sa’d-ed-Dowleh to Persia would be greeted in Tehran with anything in the shape of universal rejoicing was hardly perhaps to be ex pected. Sa’d-ed-Dowleh is a politician with what his enemies describe as a somewhat shady past. Early in his political career he was exiled from Persia, and on his return in 1916 he entered Tehran in triumph and proceeded at once to the Assembly to preach so-called Extremist views and to create an organised opposition. The children of Revolution, however, are always suspicious of one another, and the more extreme Sa’d-^d-Dowleh became the less apparently was to be trusted by the representatives of the People. Soon all manner of hard things began to be said about him, and when later he definitely threw in his lot374 with the Royalist party it seemed as if the popular prejudices had some founda tion in fact. It is not always easy to see beneath the surface of the troublous seas of Persian politics, but it seems more than probable that the sudden change that took place in Sa’d-ed-Dowleh's political creed was due to nothing more than a realization of the hopeless incapacity of the loud voiced champions of Liberty, Fraternity and Equality whose cause he had at first espoused. He went into exile with his Imperial Master in 1909, but he does not appear to have shown any sympathy for the ex-Shah’s attempts to regain his lost throne. Herein, perhaps he displayed his patriotism—or his astuteness ; the opinions of his friends and his enemies will naturally differ on this point. But that Sa’d-ed-Dowleh possesses good qualities is proved by the fact that the invitation sent to him to return to Persia was despatched by Samsam-es-Saltaneh with the approval of both Russia and Britain. Extract jrom the Pioneer November, 30th, 1912, Saad.— On May 1st, 1914, Sir W. Townley said he was an able and energetic man; but has no friends beyond one or two insignificant office-seekers.

Held this appointment several times from 1887 on. Became Governor of Luristan in 1895, where the method of his procedure met with the disapproval of His Majesty's Legation.

Public Works, Trade and Agriculture: Prince Abbas Mirza, Salar-i-Lashkar, son 0 f Prince Farman Farma, who is well, known to His Majesty’s Government. This appointment will not be popular owing to the great distrust and dislike felt by ^alT sections of opinion here for Prince Farman Farma and his family, and to the reputation for dishonesty and rapacity w hich he shares with his father and brothers. T thought it N' better, however, to include him in the Cabinet partly because, if no member ot the family had received a post, they would not have ceased to intrigue against the Govern- ment, and Farman Farma himself, who is shortly to arrive at Tehran, would have used all his money and influence to bring about Sipahdar’s resignation. This view was shared by the Shah, who is afraid of Farman Farma and his sons and by Sipahdar himself. It was also necessary to take into consideration the services rendered by the family to His Majesty’s Government. In this connection I may observe that none of the brothers ever visits me without alluding to their attachment to Great Britain and to their fidelity to British interests during the war, and it may not therefore be out of place to mention that their devotion has by no means been so wholehearted as they pretend, and that it has already been exceedingly well rewarded. All the sons have held and profited by lucrative appointments, while Farman Farma himself, thanks to British influence, remained for nearly five years Governor-General of Fars, from which, though it is the richest province in Persia, he contributed nothing to the public treasury during his term of office, but, on the contrary, constantly demanded and received financial help from the Central Government, with the result that, by the time that his oppressive and merciless spoliation of the population had given rise to complaints so universal as to necessitate his recall, he had added to his already ample fortune a sum commonly estimated at 1,500,000/. While constantly professing to the Legation his zeal for the British cause, he represented himself to the Government as the sole defender of Persian interests against bur aggression in the South. He also entered into an arrangement with the notorious Nizam-es-^altaneh whereby, if Germany proved victorious in the war, he and his family were to be protected from the consequences of their support of the Allies, while, in the contrary event, he was to render a similar service to the other party to the bargain, an undertaking which, however, he has been unable to carry out. A prominent and respected member of the British community here has seen the corre spondence embodying this agreement. Salar-i-Lashkar himself is the son-in-law of Nizam-es-Saltaneh and, when the Turks invaded North-West Persia, threw in his lot with his father-in-law and with them and left his own country for Bagdad. The other members of the family, however, remained constant in their support of the Allies. Sipahdar originally intended to offer to Salar-i-Lashkar the post of Minister of Justice, because, as he quaintly said, since there was nobody in that department who was not a thief, the new Minister would find himself in his element. I opposed this suggestion because I felt that the appointment would afford Salar-i-Lashkar too frequent opportunities for peculation, and suggested that he should become Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. Sipahdar, in his turn, rejected this proposal, saying that it would be too dangerous to have a member of Farman Farma’s family in control of the telegr aphs, wh ich offer great facilities for mischief and intrigue. _»*• '■'‘ w ' 3S7 Salar-i-HIuayid (Mirza Mushin Khan).—Son of 'Ala-uI-MuIk.

On June 16th arrived at Karachi from Chahbar under escort on the 12th instant. On June 6th, the clerk in charge at Chahbar reported that he had obtained possession of a letter written by one Salih Muhammad, an Afghan who had been residing in Markan for several years, of late years in Chahbar itself, to Sirdar Din Mahammad saying that a man who arrived from Jask by warship intended going to Dashtyari. He warned the Sirdar to be careful as to what he said to this man, not to believe what he said, that he is not one of the Kalifah’s men as he gives out, but he was an informer of the British Government and his object in going to Dashtyari was to obtain information for Government. He went on to describe his dress and concluded by asking the Sardar to destroy the letter after perusal.

Ultimately rail Khan undertook to Induce a man 'named Muhanunad Khan, a Mujtahld from Tehran, to commit the 'murder. The revolver used by Muhammad Khan was obtained by 'Wall Khan from Fakhar-us- Suitanen • Earlier in 1915 he obtained the assistance of the Gen- darmerle/darmerie officers to bombard Kumarlj and expel the Anglo phile chief Quli Khan. Owing to the relations between Mr .Mackertich, a clerk in the I.E*T.D., and the Kumarij chiefs, Fakhar-us-Sultaneh was the primary cause of Mr. Maokertich^ barbarous execution in November 1915. The above British authority states n At the trial of Mackertich 'by the Gendarmerie officers they were inclined to be 'lenient, persuaded chiefly by the warnings and intercess ion of Qawan ul Mulk IV, but Fakhar-us-Sultaneh was present 'and urged his execution”• He was a prominent member of the 'Committee iviuhafizimi ls tiqal -i-Iran*, which had the British colony arrested and deported. The Hikmat family v«ere regarded as upstarts by the Q.awamis and the opposition met by Fakhar-us-Sul taneh when a short time Governor of Niriz in 1914 he attributed to the late Qawam-ui-Mulk. The attack by the Gendarmerie on the late Qawam-ul-Mulk in December 1915 had his acquiescence and the sack of the Qawami quarter which followed brought him the deep enmity of the present Q,ewam—ul—Mulk ^ and his family* In April 1916 when the tide turned, and the Gendarmerie officers were arrested by Fath-ul-Mulk and his party, Fakhar- us -Sul taneh went into hiding for some weeks in Shiraz, then escaped to Kumarij, and finally joined Soulat-ud-Douleh, with whom he remained till in 1917 he got to Tehran. (His brother Mushar ed D^uleh had been one of the 1 Muhajann with Nizam us Sultaneh.). By 1920, through the instrumentality of Mr.Smart, the brothers effected a reconciliation with the Legation. In 1922, when Sardar Fakhar was a candidate for Abadeh, Qawam ul Mulk regarded it as a personal affront, and through Prince Nusrat us Sultaneh had Qawan us Saltaneh elected instead. Later in the year, as the seat was not taken by the latter, and Qawam ul Mulk^s fortunes had waned, Sardar/Sardar Fakhar was returned unopposed. In August 1923 his return to the 5th Majlis was secured hy Nusrat ul Mamalik, the Governor, his friend. His politics during the 4th Majlis are better known to the Legation: but In a ring consisting of Mirza All Kazarunl, Soulat ud Douleh and Hajl aiuln ut Tujjax* he has had a baneful Influence on Fars affairs and appointments made.

I opposed the appointment of Sardar-i-Mutamid because, though he is most friendly to Great Britain and 1 ia\e a great personal liking for him, he is a man of small capacity and without influence of any kind, so that his presence in the Government will gam no support for them rom any quarter. I gave way, however, on this point because the Sipahdar showed so much goodwill in accepting my suggestions in other respects that I felt that further resistance would appear ungracious. _ _————-— 2 —- ' it 1t-» 7 -LS T •-* ■403 Sardar Muzaffar.— See Daud Khan, Sardar-i-N'usrat I (Rahim Khan Chalabianlu).—A Karadagh robber chief and a favourite of Muhammad 'Ali Shah.

Sipahdar, unfortunately, approached Sardar-i-Mffnzzam before consulting his colleagues, and when lie found that several of them opposed the appointment (for Sardar-i-Mu’azzam has many enemies) he withdrew the offer, with the result that Sardar-i-Mu’azzam, considering himself slighted, announced his intention of doing all in his power to upset the Government as soon as the Medjliss met. The matter, however, was finally settled through my mediation by an undertaking on the part of Sipahdar to admit Sardar-i- Mu’azzam to the Cabinet as Minister without portfolio in a fortnight’s time, an arrangement which the latter reluctantly accepted. ~ » — 1 — — - . — 3c^r-t405 Sardar Mikri.

He is practically independent of the Persian Government, and as he is only asked to pay a very small revenue and is not interfered with, he remains loyal. His independence and the resources at his command make him the most conspicuous figure in the tract enclosed by Burujird, Kirmanshah, Qasr-i-Shirin, Badrai, and Dizful. In 1903 and again in 1907 he was summoned by the Salar- ud-Daulah to assist him in the administration of Luristan, and he, engaged in military operations against Nazar Ali Khan on the first occasion and the Bairan- vand tribe on the second.

The boundary line at the south-west corner of his domains is disputed by the Turks, who in 1907 endeavoured to effect a forcible occupation, but the force despatched by them was defeated and broken up by the Vali. The Vali contributed no contingent to aid the Shah in 1908 against the Constitutional party and has held entirely aloof from the political struggle which has been in progress in Persia since 1906. The present Vali is a man of intelligence. He has shown himself friendly to British and other European travellers.

He was 14 years in Burma m the employment of a British firm at Rangoon and married a Burmese wife, a British Indian subject, by whom he has several children. In 1901 he returned , 0 i -ni nA^ ai rr ^ ^ director of Imperial Customs at Shushtar which e eld till 1907. He gained a position of considerable influence with the towns people which he latterly sacrificed by devoting himself to the interests of the overnor, the Sardar-i-Mukarram, whose tool he was. Accused of being engaged in various nefarious practices. On the Sardar-i-Mukarram's departure his position' ecame untenable and m the end of 1907 he obtained a transfer to Ahwaz, where e has since remained in charge of the Customs.

Residing to the south and south-west of Dizful. Head-quarters usually in Husainabad tract in neighbourhood of Shush. There has been a long-continued antagonism between Shaikh Haidar and Shaikh Farhan Asad, which reached a climax in 1904, when Haidar was defeated and plundered by the latter. On this occasion the Sag- vand completed the work commenced by Farhan, but Haidar has marriage relations with the Sagvand, and as a rule can count on them for some amount of assistance. After a chequered period of misfortune, during which he had to reckon among his enemies the Sardar-i-Mukarram and Shaikh Khazal, he re-established his fortunes in 1908. In that year with the aid of the Sagvand, and the moral support of the Shaikh of Muhammarah, he thoroughly defeated Farhan, and regained the support of his own tribe, who had largely desired his cause. Shaikh Haidar bears a good reputation among ’Arabs for his personal qualities. He is lacking, however, in force of character, energy and initiative. He has 8 sons. The eldest, Shaikh Hasan, is of no practical merit. The next,’Abbas, is a friend of the Ahwaz Consulate, and has on occasions given practical proof of his friendliness. SI Shaikh Handhal Khan (Born about 1867).—Son of Shaikh Muhammad, by ^ ai Persian Mother, brother of Shaikh Khazal.

He has an ill- Razaat defined jurisdiction in the surrounding district towards the Jarrah-i-to Shakha, resided: to Band-i-Kil, and some distance down the Qarun. His powers are, however, Isapii strictly circumscribed by the distrust of Shaikh Khazal without whose orders he literatu can take no step of any significance. He is the only surviving relation of Shaikh and pi Khazal, always excepting sons, who is of sufficient position or ability to be possibly Ismto regarded as a potential rival. He is pleasant mannered and on the whole has tote acted well by all Britishers, but his free will and actions are sometimes affected 3m by tools of Haji Rais and his uncle, such as Haji Saiyid Husain, whom he has to \dji pay regard to as spies ready to misrepresent his least action to Skaikh Khazal. He has one son Shaikh Sultan, a boy of some 10 years. Commander-in-Chief to Shaikh of Muhammareh. Governor of Ahwaz till 1909, whence he was removed owing to suspected complicity in a plot against the Shaikh.

A son and heir was born on April 22nd to his wife- Reported by Hissam-ud-Dauleh to have begun intriguing in Tehran. Shaukat-ul-Mulk (Muhammad Ibrahim Khan—born about 1882).—The present generation is the eighth in descent from the founder of the family, Mir 'Ali Khan, of the 'Arab tribe of Khuzaima, which is said to have been forced to emigrate from Arabia to Khurasan in the time of Khalifa Harun-ur-Rashid at the beginning of the ninth century, and was settled in the Qain district as a check on the turbulent natives of that district. The tribe remained wealthy flock-owners, and gradually increased in power till Mir 'Ali Khan, their chief, became Amir of Qain about the seventeenth century. His son, Mir Ma’sum Khan, is said to have been in Nadir Shah’s service , and his grandson, Mir ’Alam Khan, is said to have been the man who deprived Shah Rukh, grandson of Nadir Shah, of his eyesight at Meshed in 1748. In the disturbances that subsequently ensued, Mir ’Alam Khan gained power and proclaimed himself Amir of Khurasan, but was forced to leave the country by Ahmad Shah Abdali. It is said that he was succeeded as Amir of Qain by Mir Isma’il Khan, and the latter by Mir ’Alam Khan II, the grand father of Mir ’Alam Khan III, Hashmat-ul-Mulk, father of the present Chief of Qain, and of the present Chief of Sistan and Tabas, who died in Meshed in 1891. On his death the title of Ha^hmat-ul-Mulk was given to his elder son, Mir ’Ali Akbar Khan, now Hisam-ud-Daulah, and a new title, Shaukat-ul-Mulk, was con ferred on his second son. By this the family was split up into two, and the power of the old Amir proportionately reduced. The Persian Government has now dropped the title of Amir and designates the sons as “ Hukmrans ” (Governors)427 of Qain and Sistan. He had no children, and appointed his younger brother, Mir Muhammad Ibrahim Khan Sartip, his heir. On the death of the above in 1905, Mir Muhammad Ibrahim Khan received the title as well as the Governorship of Qain notwithstanding every endeavour on the part of Hisam-ud-Daulah to prevent it. He was, however, turned out by his brother in October, 1908, but was reappointed by the Nationalists in 1909. Is a capable man and most friendly to His Majesty's Consuls. Major Kennion was very anxious in 1908 that his Majesty's Legation should strongly urge the Persian Government not to dismiss him ; but Hisam-ud-Daulah's bribes were too powerful an argument against us.

He is, however, a convinced supporter of the agreement, and is likely to be a useful member of the Cabinet owing to his great energy and the support which he enjoys from the Democratic Party.

In 1914 stated to be in America. Taqi Zadah (Saiyid Hasan). The most prominent figure in the first National Assembly. A young man under 30 years of age who represents the forward Azar- baijan party. He was the object of Muhammad ’Ali Shah’s particular hatred and fear. During the first Majlis his speeches, and his alone among the babel of voices at the Baharistan, were always sensible, judicious, and directed straight to the point at issue. He often called his fellow deputies to order for digressions or for pointless discussions on matters properly outside the scope of the duties of a Parliament. When early in 1907 the Cabinet Ministers were reluctantly forced to attend the House, he lectured them on their responsibility to Parliament and gradually brought the succeeding Cabinets to recognize this responsibility. His great ability and fearlessness is undoubted. Took refuge in His Majesty’s Legation on 24th June 1908 on the day after the coup d'etat. Tne ex-Shah demanded his delivery into the hands of the authorities, which was naturally refused.

Anti-British.Timuri Tribe of Khurasan. —The Timuris are said by some to be of Tartar origin, but this is not certain, as they have neither a tribal history nor the distinc tive Tartar features. It is, however, beyond doubt that they originally came to these parts from Syria, and therefore they may be ’Arabs. About 20,000 families of these people are said to have been moved from Syria to Turkistan by Amir Timur, hence their name. Amir Timur settled them in the Balkh district, which gave them as a dowry to his daughter who was married to Mir Saiyid Kalal, a saint of ’Arab descent living on the banks of the Oxus, who was Amir Timur’s spiritual guide. On Mir Saiyid Kalal’s death, the tribe was distributed among his sons. One of these sons, Saiyid Mir Shahid also called (Mir Shah Khan), got about four thousand families and removed them from Balkh to the Herat district. He was very con siderate and kind to his people, and his amiable qualities attracted the majority of the families remaining in Balkh, who also joined him and settled in the Herat district. When Muhammad Shah Qajar beseiged Herat in 1838, he moved about eight thousand families to Khurasan under their chief, Qilich Khan, a great-grand son of Mir Saiyid Kalal, who gained great power and became the ruling chief of the districts of Jam, Bakharz, Khaf, and Zurabad, with the title of Amir. About two thousand families of Timuris are said to be still in the Herat, Sabzawar, and Farah districts of Afghanistan. The Timuris of Khurasan number some six thou sand families. They are scattered in the Meshed, Jam, Bakharz, Zurabad, and Sarakhs districts and are divided into two sections, the one under Nusrat-ul-Mulk, the son of the late ’Ali Mardan Khan, and the other under Shaukat-ud-Daulah.

His parentage on the mother’s side (the ’Iffat-us-Saltanah not being a Royal Princess) always stood in the way of his being declared heir to the throne : this position thus fell to Muzaffar-ud-Din, who, born of Royal parents on both sides, was declared Valia’hd, and was accepted by the people as possessing all the necessary qualifications. He received the title of Yamin-ud-Daulah in 1860, and his present title in 1869. Married the daughter of Mirza Taqi Khan (Nasir-ud-Din’s first Prime Minister) and Nasir-ud-Din’s sister, the lzzat-ud-Daulah, by whom he had his eldest son Jalal-ud-Daulah, Sultan Husain Mirza.

At one period during the life time of Nasir-ud-Din Shah he held the joint Governorships of Ispahan, Pars, Trak, Yazd, and ’Arabistan and maintained a forcfe of some 15,000 well-trained and disciplined soldiers. This force was disbanded in 1888 by order of Nasir-ud-Din Shah, who had become jealous of the reputation and the position occupied by his son. [See Sir A. Nicholson’s despatch No. 27 (Secret) of February 28th, 1888.] The Zill-us-Sultan was then gradually reduced to the position of an ordinary subject, and at the death of Nasir-ud-Din Shah in May 1896, was Governor of the province of Ispahan only. His power was still further curtailed on the accession of Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah. He behaved very well on the death of his father, and maintained good order in his province, and at once expressed his allegiance to475 his younger brother. He is very rich, owning villages and property in Persia worth, it is said, about £250,000, and has investments in Four Per Cent.

Resided in Tehran for the rest of the year. In December when the Shah incurred great unpopularity by his attempted coup d’etat the Zill-us-Sultan was openly spoken of as a candidate for the throne, and it seemed that at one moment he Was ; indeed, endeavouring to seize the throne. Received orders from the Cabi net to quit Tehran and appealed to the British Legation to protect him under the terms of officially written promise of protection given to him by successive British Ministers. Appointed Governor of Pars, March 1908, which post he held until July of that year when he was dismissed after his house in Tehran had been sacked during the coup d’etat of June 23.

Has placed his extensive properties at Isfahan under Russian protection. Resides at Nice. The Zill is a man of firm character and is a good Provincial Governor.
