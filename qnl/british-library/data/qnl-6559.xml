C. 113.' This Document is the property of the Secretarij of State for Lidia. Memorandum on the Note of the Persian Government, dated 22nd February 1906, embodying their objections to the Seistan Water Award. The Scistan water problem in itself possesses intricacies of a technical nature. Its settlement is further complicated by the diversity of the interests concerned in its solution. 2. The distribution of the water of the Ilelmund river directly concerns Persia and Afghanistan, the two principals in the case. The first essential of any arbitral award is obviously a distribution equally fair to both parties. 3. Any award regulating the distribution of water, involves per se f the question of its future enforcement. The responsibility of this rests in the present case with the British Government in regard to Persia and the Indian Government in regard to Afghanistan. It has been necessary, therefore, in framing the award, to restrict its provisions to the limits within which those Govern ments are willing to accept the responsibility of tbeir subsequent enforcement. 4. Thus there have been in the settlement of this case not two but four parties to consider, while yet another, a fifth party, Russia, whose agents both instigated the local disputes which lead to this arbitration and endeavoured to impede tbeir settlement, is, in the position of counsel to one of the principals, the author of some of the objections raised by Persia against the Award. It is necessary to mention these facts in order to explain certain matters, of which a proper understanding is essential for the final settlement of this difficult case. 5. Before dealing with the specific objections now raised by Persia, I will endeavour to explain briefly the salient features of the Seistan water question and the principles underlying my award thereon. Very lull details of the whole question will be found in my Memorandum of the 25th September 1904 and my Despatch of 15th April 11)05. I will restrict my present observations to a brief general statement ot the case. 6. Persian and Afghan Seistan depend upon the Helmund river for irrigation. The Helmund flows through Afghan territory up to the pointwhere the Perso-Afglian boundary line runs into it at Band-i-Kobak (also known as Band i-Seistan). The Helmund is a large river, and the water in normal years is more than amply sufficient for the present needs of both countries. Both take all the water they want for existing requirements, and no serious difficulty has ever arisen in the past about the distribution of it. Owing to long and very abnormal drought the water failed in 1901, and for a short period neither country could get enough for irrigation. This lead io disputes which, although not serious in themselves, were made so by the instigation of Russian agents and resulted in the present arbitration. i 7. Persia insisted that the Arbitral Award should be in accordance with the terms of Sir Pied. Goldsmid’s Award of 1872. That award briefly disposed of the water question in the following words:—“It is to be well understood “ that no works are to be carried out on either side “ calculated to interfere with the requisite supply “ of water for irrigation on both banks of the “ Helmund.” Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Alfairs, in his capacity of final confirming authority of that award, further laid down in 1873 that the above clause should not be understood to apply either to existing canals or to old or disused canals that it may be desired to put in proper repair, nor would it interfere with the excavation of new canals provided that the requisite supply on both banks is not diminished. In other words, both sides were allowed to do what they liked in the matter of taking water from the Helmund as long as they did not interfere with the supply requisite for the other side. 8. Very little consideration of the question will show that the only award which it is possible to frame in accordance with the above award must take one of two forms. It must either be merely a restatement of that award, or comprise some definition of the term “ requisite supply ” of water. To be of a lasting and permanent character and lo obviate future disputes regarding the distribution of the Helmund water supply, the award should obviously include that definition, and thereby lay down the share of water to which one or other of the parties may be entitled as their “ requisite supply.” 9. The question then arises as to whether this definition of 4 ‘ requisite supply ” should be based on present requirements only, or on possible future and greater requirements. To be of a permanent nature it is obvious tliat the award should provide for the supply requisite not only for present requirements, but for all possible future contin gencies in the matter of extension of irrigation and cultivation on either side.10. The only method of calculating the amount of water requisite for irrigation is to ascertain the amount of land capable of irrigation and culti vation. The 11 el mu nd river at the present time divides itself 111 keistan into three branches. 1'hese form one delta, and to this delta is confined the whole present inhabited and cultivated portion of Seistan, Persian and Afghan. Putting aside for simplicity of explanation the small amount of Afghan culti vation along the river banks above Band-i-Kohak, we may define the above delta as that portion of Seistan irrigable by the Helmund and its brandies from Band-i-Kohak downwards. This delta is coloured green in the map attached. 11. If for a moment we consider this delta only, we find that on the Persian side the area of culti vable and irrigable land available requires for both present cultivation and possible future extension of cultivation only one-third of the whole normal volume of the Helmund river, even during the low river season when water is most required for agricultural purposes. 12. Besides, however, the delta now used by the Helmund, there are two other and larger deltas, each of which has in times past been used by the river. These are (1) the Tarakun-Ramrod- Hauzdar tract (coloured yellow on the map), and (2) the Sar o Tar-Amiran tract (coloured pink on the map). The first is half in Afghanistan and half in Persia, the second wholly within Afghanistan. Both these deltas are now deserted, uninhabited, and waterless tracts. 13. Our local researches and observations have pro^ ed that both these tracts, covered with old ruins and traces of ancient canal beds, have been in the past thickly populated and richly cultivated, ?ind that it is possible to construct canal systems from the Helmund to irrigate and cultivate them once more. 11. Moreover I found that it would he possible at more than one place above where the Helmund now enters Persian Seistan to direct the whole river to one or other side into Afghan Seistan, and prevent any water ever reaching Persian Seistan My award had therefore to safeguard Persia from the danger of her water supply being cut off, and if future possibilities of cultivation are to be taken into consideration, to provide for the possible future cultivation of both the above disused deltas. 15. I need not now go into the exact details of the respective areas of the Tarakun, Ramrod, and Sar-o-Tar deltas. Suffice to say that, taking Seistan as a whole, we find that of the gross areaof Seistan, 4,160 square miles lall within Afghan territory, and 2,850 square miles within Persian territory. Of this area the cultivable and irrigable portion is fairly equally divided between the two countries. About half lies in Persia aud half in Afghanistan. The area actually cultivated in present times is only a small portion of the area capable of irrigation and cultivation. The area of present Persian cultivation largely exceeds that of Afghanistan. 16. A careful calculation of the normal volume of water of the Helmund river has resulted in the establishment of a somewhat remarkable fact which sreatly simplifies the question of distribution of that water. This is that the volume of w'ater available for irrigation agrees with the area capable of cultivation. It suffices to irrigate the whole cultivable area of Seistan, and the following distribution provides for the adequate requirements of each component tract, i.e. :— I One third to Persian Seistan in the present inhabited delta. One third to Afghan Seistan on the right bank of the Helmund, and including the Sar-o-Tar delta. One third to the Tarakun-ltamrod-Hauzdar delta. Of this one-third, one half would meet the requirements of the Afghan portion and one half those of the Persian portion of that delta. In other words the supply of Helmund water requisite to meet all the possible future require ments of Persia and Afghanistan is, in each case, one half of the whole volume of the Helmund river. 17. By the term “ whole volume ” of the Helmund is meant the volume of the river measured at some point above wherever water is diverted from it on to Seistan lands. As canals or diversions to irrigate Afghan Seistan or deprive Persian Seistan of water can be made to leave the river above the point where the Helmund itself enters Seistan, it is necessary to define the point at which the volume of the river is measured for purposes of distribution in such a way as to provide for the contingency of that point moving higher and higher up the river. I have, therefore, in my award defined this point as follows, viz., “the point where wmter is “ first taken off from it (the Helmund) to irrigate “ lands on either bank situated at or beloAv Bandar- “ i-Kamal Khan.” It should be noted that that point is at the present moment somewhere near Rodbar, i.e., w r ell within Afghan territory and outside what is now known as Seistan. It may hereafter move a little further up the Helmund, and, consequently, further into Afghan territory. This fact should be remembered5 * Seistan Series, Part V., No. 2 ■ ft ter on in connection with Clause VII. of my award, where provision has been made to provide for Afghan susceptibilities on this matter. 18. It now remains to explain the manner in ^hie!i my award deals with the distribution of the water itself. From what I have already said it will he clear that I considered Persia, if her future as well as present requirements are to be considered, entitled to one-iialt of the whole Ilelmund, i.e., one-third of the river, lor the cultivation of her portion of the present delta of that river, or in other words, 1 cisian Seistan, irrigable at and from Handi-i- Koliak downwards, and one-sixth of the river for the possible future irrigation of the Persian portion of the Tarakun-Ramrod delta. 19. Unfortunately this latter tract can only be u 11 gate.I by making canals from or above llaudar- i-Kamal Khan and leading them through Afghan territory. To give Persia the benefit o? the 'one- sixth of the Helmund allowed for this tract, which it must be remembered is an allotment of water quite useless to her elsewhere, it was necessary to include in my award some provision enabling Persia hereafter to obtain water through Afghan territory. 1 accordingly made this provisio n in Clause 5 of my Draft Award C., and Clause 4 of Draft Award D. 20. Any such clause, however, largely iucreases the scope of the responsibilities which fall noon the British Grovernment and Indian Gfoverument in the matter of the subsequent enforcement of my award, in the case of Persia and Afghanistan respectively. I could not commit either Govern ment to responsibilities greater than they might be willing to accept, and the provisions contained in this clause formed one of the various points which for a similar reason I was obliged to refer to the Governments concerned. These points I embodied in a series of draft awards. 21. With my Memorandum* of the 25th September 1901 on the Seistan water question, 1 submitted for the consideration of Government four draft awards, A, B, C, and D. All four drafts were based on one and the same piinciph, hut they were progressive in character and each exceeded the preceding one in general scope. Award A was merely a restatement of Sir Fred. Goldsmid’s award, with the addition of the Secretary of State’s ruling of 1873 thereon. Dmit B went further, and defined the amount ot water requisite for Persian requirements from and below the Band-i-Kohak, and gave Persia one-third of the whole Ilelmund for those requirements. Draft C went still further, and provided for the possible future irrigation of the Ramrod-Hauzdar S. 16. jbtract, and the grant to Persia of an additional one-sixth of the river in the event of that tract being brought under irrigation. Draft D tackled the whole question boldly as a whole, and gave Persia one-half of the whole Helmund, whether the Ramrod-Hauzdar tract were irrigated or not, but at the same time pro vided for the possible irrigation of that tract by canals through Afghan territory. 22. His Majesty’s Government, after obtaining the views of the Government of India and His Majesty’s Minister at Teheran, selected Draft B, and T was instructed to deliver that award, with a few veybal alterations which need not he referred to here. 1 he selection of Draft B and the rejection of Draffs C and D on the part of the Government of India, were based on the principle that it was undesirable* “ to do anything that might give birth “ to any idea that the Persians have any claim “ to restrict irrigation by channels to be constructed “ through Afghan territory.” The Government of India appear also to have considered that any such provision would not be in accordance with the Goldsmid award. * Vide Telegram No. 4257 F., of oth November 1904, from His Excellency the Viceroy to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India ,—Seistan Series, Part V., No. 7. 23. Before delivering my Award, 1 made a further reference on the above point to the Government of India in the followingf words :— “ Doubt has recently been weighing on my mind whether the following point has been fully considered and decided by the Government of India. Please see paragraph of my Memorandum of 2oth September. . . My Award B, as now agreed upon, provides only for the irrigation of Persian land irrigable from and below the Band-i-Kohak (vide paragraph 77 of my Memorandum and Clause 2 of Award), i,e., for the irrigation of existing Persian cultivation and extension thereof. This has no connection with the Tarakun and Ram rod-Hauzdar tracts (vide paragraphs 78 and 79 of my Memo randum), the larter of which does not come under the head of existing cultivation and extension thereof. Has Government definitely decided that under no future circumstances will Persia be allowed water for the irrigation of the Ramrod- Hauzdar tract even if such be found possible by Afghans reopening the Tarakun canal system? Persia will be certain to raise this question when my Award is delivered, and therefore it is well to consider it now. Unless something to the contrary is placed on record in a letter to the Amir, the Alghans will be justified in contending hereafter that the present Award precludes any further reopening of the water question. I cannot help thinking that Government, although desirous to avoid giving Persia any reason for thinking she has a voice in the river above Kohak, yet would be willing hereafter, when the time came, to consider the Persian right to one-sixth of water which has t My telegram. No. 909, of 2na March 1905, to the Foreign Secretary, Calcutta.— Seistan Series, Part VI., No. 18.been allowed for the Ivamrod-Hauzdar tract in my Memorandum and my wider Awards C and D. If this supposition is correct, will it not be necessary, when communicating the Award to the Amir, for Government to inform him that the Award, though referring onty to Persian lands irrigable from and below Band-i-Kohak, does not preclude the con sideration of Persian right to water tor Rnmrod- 1 lauzdar lands, should their irrigation hereafter come within the scope of practical politics ? It Mould remove all reasonable ground for Persian appeal if some assurance to that effect be given to the Persian Government at the same time. If thought preferable the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as confirming authority in this Arbitration, might perhaps add a ruling to the aboAe effect. I venture to bring this point to notice in case it may have been partially overlooked in the general consideration of this complicated question.” * Telegram Xo. 894 F. of 9th March 24. To this I received the following* renlv - 1905. from Foreign Secretary, Calcutta.— TU , • • i t 0 1 * ' Seistan Series, Part VI., Xo. 19. . , lie P omt raised by you was fully discussed, and it was considered undesirable to do anytllin ^ &gt; , that might give rise to the idea that the Persians had any claim to extend irrigation by canals to be constructed through Afghan Territory. The Amir would never consent to this; and in view of the insistance of the Persian Government that the award should he confined to Goldsmid’s Award, which refers only to existing cultivation, it was held preferable to exclude Tarakun and Hauzdar tractsfrom consideration.” f Vide paragraph 23 of my Despatch, Xo. 3,004, of loth April 1905, to the Government of India. — Seistan Scries, Part VII, Xo. 16. 2o I accordingly carried out my instructions and delivered the Award, i.e., Award B. When explaining its terms to the Afghan Commissioner endeavoured to meet, as far as lay in mv power tumre contingencies by clearly statingf* to him ^ lat if the irrigation of the Bamrod tract by I erhia ever became practicable I presumed that „ ‘‘‘f s'JPP'y of water for it would, then and then only become a question for settlement between the two countries.” oitatemeni was i i , , clHCl W 3S thoroughly understood by the Afghan Commissioner, mt hav e no means of knowing for certain whether nc complied with my request and communicated it, together with my replies to other questions raised on my Award, to the Amir. , L , n . e . ers ian Government has now raised several objections against my Award, among which the question ot the Persian share of water naturally takes the most prominent place. J / 7 * 1 ^ lese objections seriatim. I understand that they have been put forward in an informal manner and do not constitute a formal appeal.Persian Xote. Para. 1.—Although Colonel MacMahon restricts his Award by Clauses 5 and h to General Goldsmid’s Award in respect of water, he refers in the 7 th Clause to the Goldsmid Award, and quotes the interpretation given to it by the English Foreign Office, and the former arbitration, to which the Persian Commissioner has strongly objected. There is no doubt that the interpretation referred to is prejudicial to the Persian Government, since it recommends the repair and construction of the old unused canals and does not prevent the excavation of new ones, provided that the water is not diminished. This ties our hands, and we have to be content with the present state of the district, which runs the risk of a dearth of water in the future. The reason is that the old and unused Persian canals begin to run from the Helmund in Afghan territory, and con sequently a large extent of the Persian lands, which could be cultivated by irrigation, will be left waste. On the other hand, the Afghans will be free to irrigate their unused arable lands by the old and unused as well as by the new canals. Para,. 2.—All the peasants and inhabitants of Seistan, as well as fishermen and owners of cattle, used to take great advantage of the Seistan, Rudi Parian, and other streams flowing from the Helmund, and only a small portion of the water formerly flowed into Afghanistan. After Colonel MaeMahon’s decision there has been a change in the division of the water, and according to Clauses 2, 3, and 4, the Persians have to receive one-third, but the Afghans two- thirds. On what ground, and for what reason the water has thus been divided is not known. According to Mac Mahon’s information, there were 500,000 acres of arable lands, and one- third of the Helmund water is sufficient to irrigate 200,000 acres. It therefore appears that our share of the water is not sufficient to irrigate one-half of our arable lands, whilst, if the whole water of. the Helmund River were used for agricultural purposes the arable lands of Persia would be much more than 500,000 acres, because the Hamun and Naizars would be dried up. Para. 1.—The ruling referred to is quoted in my paragraph 7 above. It was given by His Majesty’s Secretary of State in his position as the confirming authority of Sir Fred. Gold smid’s Award. That ruling amounts, therefore, to an integral part of that Award, and the Persians cannot object to my treating it as such. As a matter of fact, the definition of rights therein stated applies to both Persia and Afghanistan. Persia is also entitled to open up old and construct new canals, but this permission obviously does not extend to Persia opening up canals in Afghan territory, any more than to Afghanistan doing so in Persian territory. The root of this objection lies in the absence of any provision in my Award allowing Persia here after to benefit by the construction of Afghan canals through the Tarakun tract. Para. 2.—Persia here seems to depart from her insistance on my rigid adherence to the Goldsmid Award, and claims a division of water based on existing custom and not on the Goldsmid Award. Persia has approximately 500,000 acres of cultivable land, irrigable from and below the Band-i-Kohak. The one-third of the Helmund, now awarded, suffices to irrigate annually about one-half of this area, i.e., 250,000 acres for spring crop cultivation alone, and much more than 250,000 acres for spring and autumn crop combined. She only now cultivates about 133,000 acres of spring crop. Under no cir cumstances could more than one half the whole cultivable area be put under crops each year, as Seistan lands as a whole require to be left fallow at least every other year, if not more. My Award, therefore, gives Persia far more water than she now wants, and enough to meet all future possible requirements in the tract under consideration. The contingency suggested, i.e., the drying up of the Hamun and Naizars, may be treated as being too remote to need consideration, as far as my Award is concerned. It can only become possible by the proper regulation and distri bution of the Helmund river at some point above Seistan. This can never be done either by Afghanistan or Persia, eioher separately or conjointly. It could be effected by ourselves or some other civilized power, and such providing, ipso facto, would first necessitate a joint understanding on the Seistan water question.S. 16 . c It the water is to be divided in proportion to the cultivation of both sides, two-thirds of it should belong to Persia. Para. 3.—The water of the canals running to the south of Bandar-i-Ramal Khan and north of Naizar have so far been sufficient for the cultivation on the bank of the Helmund. Now Colonel MacMahon allows the old canals on both sides to be repaired and new ones to be con structed. This arrangement has certainly been made in favour of Afghanistan, because its share of the water is two-thirds, and it is also allowed to excavate new canals, and in a short time it will be able to bring the lands on the right bank of the river, as well as the lands recently assigned to it by Colonel MacMahon, under cultivation, while a great extent of the Persian lands will be left uncultivated. Para. 4.—According to Clause 7 of Colonel MacMahon’s decision, the rights of the Persian Government to the Helmund water are very much restricted, but, on the other hand, the Afghans are entirely free, and they can even themselves divide the water of the river. The restriction which prevents Persia from alienating its rights on the water to any foreign Govern ment without the consent of Afghanistan is unreasonable, because the Persian Government, who know for certain that the water is not sufficient for their Seistan lands, will not alienate it to a second party. If Colonel MacMahon wishes to put any restriction on Persia he should have done the same with Afghanistan, in order that the latter should not be able to alienate to a second Power, without the consent of Persia, the important part of Seistan (and its waters), which, at the time of the former arbitration, were the property and in the possession of Persia, and which, according to the Goldsmid Agreement, the Persian Govern ment assigned to Afghanistan, withdrawing its garrisons from the important points of Kaleh Fath, Nad-Ali, &amp;c. The restriction in question should equally apply to the two parties, because it has affected the Persian Government in its honour and superiority, which it was the object of Article VII. of the Treaty of Paris to uphold, which Treaty initiated these arbitrations and interventions. Tins water belonged to Seistan, the whole of which belonged to Persia, and the part ijiven to the Afghans by former Agreement should be restricted by the condition in question, in order that the Afghans should not be able to alienate it to another Government. In the &lt; riginal Goldsmid Agreement no reference was made to the point in question. which would include provision for the irrigation of the Persian Ramrod-Hauzdar tract. M ater has for reasons stated in my para graph 10 above, not been divided in proportion to cultivation, but in proportion to cnlturable areas. This does not entitle Persia to two- thirds. Para. 3.—This is a repetition in different words of para. 1 of the Persian note. Para, 4.—This rambling and illogical objec tion to Clause VII. of my Award is easily answered. As shown in para. 17 of this memo randum the place where Persia’s share of water is to be calculated has, in the interests of Persia and to safeguard her from diminution of her proper share, been fixed at a point in Afghan territory. The Afghans are debarred thereby from doing all they might desire to do with the water of the Helmund for some distance within Afghan territory. Afghan susceptibilities on matters of this nature are very acute, and it is certain that the Afghan Government would have objected to such an amplification of the Goldsmid Award without some adequate quid pro quo in the form of some other amplification correspondingly favourable to Afghan interests. To understand how Afghan interests are con cerned in this matter one has only to imagine the substitution of some other ownership, say that of Russia, in the place of Persian ownership in Seistan. This would at once raise the ques tion of personal representation in some form or other at the point where shares of water are calculated. This would prove intolerable to Afghanistan, and Clause VII. has been drawn up to safeguard Afghan interests in the same way that Persian interests are safeguarded by fixing the point of water measurement in Afghan territory. This clause is no more a departure from the Goldsmid Award than that portion of Clause III. which necessitates it. It is important to note that the objection here raised is not a genuine or spontaneous one as far as Persia is concerned. This clause of my Award was approved of by the Persian Government. Sir A. Hardinge, in his telegram* of the 25th April 1905, says that the Persian Foreign Minister “found no fault with the “ clause about non-surrender of Persian water “ rights to a third Power.” Again, on the 27th April he telegraphedf that the Persian Government, after receiving * Vide Telegram No. 78 of 25th April 11)05. Seistan Series, Part VII., No. 12. f Vide Telenram No. 79 of 27th April 1905. Seistan Series, Part VII., No. 14.10 Para. 5 .—Colonel MacMalion has not only disregarded the Gohlsmid Agreement, and has not acted according to it, but he has introduced some innovations which are favourable to Afghanistan and injurious to the Persian Government. For example, his decision excludes (from Persia) the Helmund waters which were formerly in the possession of Persia, gives one- third to the Persians and two-thirds* to the Afghans. The Helmund water should naturally irrigate all the arable lands of Seistan, but the present division of the water, giving one-third to Persia, is unnatural and unjust. Besides this fact, the object of accepting the arbitration was for the removal of the present differences which have arisen on account of the actual cultivation, and not for the consideration of emergencies which may arise in the future. From Bandar-i- Kamal Khan downward, all the cultivated land on either side of the river, i.e., all Seistan, is irrigated by the river in question. If we were actually to divide the cultivation, two-thirds of the whole would be in Persian territory, and the whole of the Afghan cultivation in Seistan would be even less than one-third. Therefoie, the water should at least be divided in the same proportion. It is clear that the English Commissioner, m dividing the water quite in an opposite way, and basing his Arbitral Award on anticipations of the future, and of bringing the barren lands in Seistan under cultivation, disregarded the necessity of the time and the object of his invitation. According to the present Award, a* is already mentioned, Persia suffers to the advantage of Afghanistan at the seasons both of the rise and fall of the river. According to the permission it has fov the repair or the old and the construction of new canals, Afghanistan will improve the unused lands on the left bank of the Helmund River, and undoubtedly will attract thither the inhabitants of Seist-m, which has been left without water. It is inserted in Clause 1 that both sides have the right, within their own territories, to maintain existing canals, to open out old or disused canals, and to make new canals from the Helmund. This decision would he con sidered a very just one if from Bandar-i-Kamal Khan to Naizar all the lands to the west belong to Persia and those to the east to Afghanistan. The case being otherwise, it is desirable that Persia should at least be able to repair its old and unused canals, should it consider it necessary to do so (when the Afghans begin the work), from above Kuhak Dam (Band-i-Kohak) to Bandar Kamal, at anv point from whch it can get water from the Helmund for Seistan. According to Clause 1, the Persian Government can only improve the lands below the Kuhak Dam and all the lands of Amrud, Kauda, the criticisms of the Persian Commissioner on my Award, “ do not raise any objection to the pro- “ hibition of the transfer of water rights to a “ third Power, which the Mushir-ed-Dowleh “ says, strengthens their position.” The authorship of the objections now iabed against this clause is obvious. Para. 5.—This amounts to nothing more than a repetition in varying terms of the objec tions stated in other parts of the Persian note, and already dealt with by me. It is interesting, however, to notice the similarity between this portion of the Persian note and the contents of the letter of 20th July 1905 addressed by the Russian Legation in Teheran to the Valiahd. Amrud, Kanda, and Houzdan, should be read Ramrod, Kundar, and Hauzdar.Houzdan, &amp;C., which cover a length of 10 farsakhs, and a width of more than one-half of that distance the whole way, and which are separate and have nothing to do with the lands below the dam, must, when necessary, be irrigated by the waters above the dam and below Dek, Dileh, and Rudbar. Although ostensibly the two parties are allowed to improve the unused and barren lands, in reality the Persian Government have been deprived of this right. lor Dek, Dileh, read Dak i-dila, which is a place on the left bank of the Helmand near Bandar-i-Kamal Khan. Para. G.—One of the innovations in the present Arbitral Award is the introduction of a permanent engineer for the future execution of the Award, although no reference to that point was made in the Goldsmid Agreement. If the arbitration were final and in accordance with the previous Award, there would be no necessity for a permanent engineer. In view of the above considerations, as well as a few other objections to the stipulations of Colonel MacMahon’s Award, the Persian Government cannot but consider the A.ward in question prejudicial to its interests, and wish to make a distinct protest. Para. 6.—I was quite within my rights as Arbitrator to prescribe some means of ensuring that the terms of my Award should be carried out in the interests of both parties. The neces sity for a permanent engineer for the purposes noted in my Award is too obvdous to need further remark. I Concluding Remarks. 28. The observations I have made in this memorandum on the Seistan water question, and on the objections raised by Persia against my award lead to the conclusion that the Persian Government have been able to raise against my Award only two objections that merit further consideration. All the other objections can, I think, be summarily dismissed. What Persia does really object to, and what underlies all the other objections she has made, is the absence in my Award of any provision for the future irrigation of the Ramrod-Hauzdar tract. My Award only provides for the irrigation of the present inhabited portion of Persian Seistan, the present delta of the Helmund River, 29. The second of the two objections I have referred to, is, that Persia only gets one-third of the Eelmund, or to put it more exactly into Persian words, that Afghanistan gets two-thirds, while Persia only gets one-third of the Helmund. I feel sure that the Persians realize in their own minds that one-third of the whole ilelmund is enough for the lands for which it is awarded. They also know, although they affect to ignore the fact*, that the share of the river which I have given them, at Band-i-Kohak is in reality considerably more than one-third of the whole river at the point of measurement above Bander-i Kamal Khan. To enable the equivalent of one-third at that point to reach Band-i-Kohak, considerably more than one-third has to be allowed to pass that point to make good the loss by evaporation and absorption on the way between that point and Band-i-Kohak. S. 16. DI carefully explained this fact to both Persians and Afghans. The real reason underlying the Persian claim for more than the one-third share I have given them is their desire to provide for the future irrigation of the Ramrod-Hauzdar tract. 30. Both objections thus resolve themselves into one. In other words Persia claims the right to irrigate the Ramrod-Hauzdar tract if that be found possible hereafter, and demands that a further share of water be awarded to her for that purpose. The one and only question for decision, is whether that claim is a valid one or not. 31. Idle same question has already been con sidered by Government, and decided before my Award was delivered. It was then put in another form, i.e., that stated in my telegram of ibid March 1905 (vide paragraph 23 above). That decision was based on the argument that the Goldsmid Award refers only to existing cultivation, and therefore my Award should be restricted to the same. I feel considerable diffidence in expressing further opinions on this point under these circum stances, but I have been called upon to do so, and will comply. 32. I need only say that I much regret that Government arrived at the above decision on this point, and I consider that it was in some respects an unfortunate decision. No award can partake of a permanent nature unless it provides for more than merely existing conditions. I think that provision ought to be made for future contingencies, and therefore for the possible future irrigation of the Tarakun* Hauzdar tract. 33. The award does not (and it w r as my object when framing it to word it so that it should not) necessarily debar the future consideration of Persia’s right to water for the Ramrod-Hauzdar tract, because it clearly states that the share of water now given to Persia is the amount “ requisite “ for the irrigation of Persian lands irrigable from “ and below Baud-i-Kohak.” The absence in my Award of any reference to other Persian lands in Seistan would justify Persia in claiming at any future time that the con sideration of the requirements of those lands does not come under the head of “ res judicata.” On the other hand, unless something to the contrary effect be now placed on record, Afghani stan may hereafter contend that my Award has given them all the Helmund water that remains after supplying one-third of the river to Persia, and that therefore the actual distribution of the water being “res judicata,” Persia cannot raise the question of a further share. Afghan logic in thismatter might not admit the argument I have stated in the first part of this paragraph. I think there fore that something should be placed on record now that will simplify matters hereafter. 34. The undesirability of giving Persia reason to think that she has a right to extend cultivation by canals constructed through Afghan territory, is obvious, if it means the admission of Persian right to construct canals through Afghan territory. But what about future Afghan canals through the Tarakun tract, and the possibility, remote though it he, of a joint Perso-Afghan arrangement for extending those canals into the Persian Itamrod- Hauzdar tract? Is it right or politic that the present settlement should, even if it does not actually debar such an arrangement, leave such difficulties in the way of its accomplishment as to make it practically an impossible one ? 35. To alter the Award itself is highly un desirable and impolitic, but there are other ways of placing on record a ruling on this point which will have the same authority as the Award itself. 36. In communicating the decision of His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the Persian Appeal, it might be intimated to the Persian and Afghan Governments by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and the Government of India respectively, that my Award being restricted to the Goldsmid Award, is based on existing conditions and requirements, and applies only, as far as Persia is concerned, to Persian lands irrigable from and below Band-i-Kohak; that the irrigition of the long disused Persian Itamrod-Hauzdar tract by canals constructed through Afghan territory is a question that could not he dealt with in the present arbitration, and therefore remains a matter for settlement at some future time. 37. Or again, His Majesty’s Secretary of State, as the confirming authority of my Award, could add a corollary to my Award and lay down some thing to the following effect: — that should the irrigation of the Persian Bamrod-Hauzdar tract hereafter become possible through mutual understanding between Persia and Afghanistan in the matter of necessary canals through Afghan territory, the future consideration of a further share of the Helmund amounting to one-sixth of that river, for the purpose of such extension of Persian cultivation, will not be de barred by anything contained in this Award. The whole Persian share of the Helmund not to exceed one-half of the river. 38. It may be argued that Afghanistan will be the less likely in the future to come to any mutual agreement with Persia on this point because shewill thereby lose one-sixth of the river. On the other hand it must be remembered that Afghanistan has no need of that one-sixth for her own use. More over the Afghans realise how difficult it is for them to divert enough water from the Helmund to irrigate either the Tarakun or Sar-o-Tar tract without running the risk of diverting the whole river into a new channel, and thus depriving not only all the existing Persian hut also Afghan cultivation of water. 39. Not onlv the extension of cultivation in * the Hamrod-Hauzdar tract that Persia so much desires, but also the extension of Afghan culti vation in the Sar-o-Tar and Tarakuit tracts, depend on the construction of irrigation works, which are beyond the power of present Afghan engi neering science. The success of these works depends on skilful maintenance and supervision beyond the possibilities of either Afghan or Persian administration, acting either separately or conjointly. 40. If some means of meeting these difficulties could be provided the benefits gained would more than recompence Afghanistan for the additional share of water sriven to Persia. Prom our study of the country we know that ^ve could easily construct and maintain the irrigation works required for the proper regulation and distribution of the Helmund river, and thereby bring some three million acres of rich land into use, and irrigate and cultivate annually no less than one million acres of that land. 41. Mutual arrangement between Persia, Afghanistan, and ourselves on this matter is the only way of giving Persia the rights she now- claims, and of giving both Persia and Afghanistan their proper share of the natural w r ealth which the Helmund river offers to them. My Award, if either of the suggestions given in paragraphs 36 and 37 be adopted, opens up a way of arriving at some future time at a mutual arrangement beneficial to both parties. A. H.
