Shaik Hamad has asked me to coromunicate with you with a Vftew to making definite arrangements for the work to proceed. He is anxious to know whether one of the companies with which you are f x ^ associated will undertaken the boring of artesian wells &amp; ihe necessary work in connection with a water supply for the two towns mentioned. It wa,s Shaik Hamad's intention to go into this matter personally when in London,bt/t circumstanc s have arisen &lt; which make it impossible for Shaik Hamad to visit England this year f &amp; he is anxious that there should be no delay in starting the scheme which he w ishes to be carried out during the next cold season. Dr Heim lays some stress on the advisability of the work being carried out under the smpervisionof an expert geologisT &amp;&amp; the Shaik considers this of importance would request that i*&gt;v connection with any proposals you would put forth you should indicate who would be the geologist under whose supervision the work v/ould proceed &amp; describe his qualifications for the work o-9 Telegram- commercial codes dated October 2Snd 1934 from Eaegeneynd to Political Agent. # In reply to your telegram October 2lEt, Letter forwarded October 8th via Baghdad glvee detaile.Qne lac rupees covers total cost two wells including nececpary casing &amp; apparatus to control water. Yes,both wells will be absolutely complete for use. Without the experience to be gained from the sinking of the experimental wells it is difficult to give exact price per foot for subsequent wells but approximate price will be £S-10 to £4 per fobt which price would include expert geological supervision in locating &amp; supervising well,necessary casing &amp; placing water under control as with experimental wells.

Our Engineer has made all arrangements with regard to the drilling rig, tools, and expert drillers to carry out the actual well 'boring, further, the services of the v/ell known Geologist, i^'ir.-•. C/.^iaGgwick, have 'been secured to undertake the supervision of tne work 'both fro., a practical and technical side. I enclose a resume of ^ir* iviadgwick's professional Cctreer, «nd you will see from it that he has a large experience in locating and drilling artesian wells. Referring to your letter of 27th. July 1924, (iSO. 176 /9 /9*) our representative in Bahrein, joi Frank Holmes, is fully aware of the importance of thetwo preliminary bores, ancl has gone into the question with experts in this work, and he feels confident that the -'ork is 'being placed into most capable hands. The Plant, if our terms are &lt;ftfcepted, that will 'be sent out to Bahrein, is a new one of the latest Calyx ilotary tjipe, and will ^ield jim\j •te core 5' A diameter, casing is being supplied sufficient to line the holes, tr e first 200 ft. of each from the surface. The experts suggest that 100 ft. of lining in each hole would be sufficient, but in order to be perfectly safe from pollution of the Artesian water and extra 100 ft. for each hole is being supplied. The Plant will be sent out well su plied with tools and spare parts, and should complete the two holes in from four to five months from date of arrival on the .'/ell site. The terms upon which this; Syndicate is prepared to sink the two experimental holes to a maximum depth of 600 ft or imtil water be struck in sufficient quantities at any les depth than the 600 ft. mentioned above y is Rupees 100,000 this to be the total expenditure to be incurred by the Bahrein Government in respect of the two experimental holes.

Holmes, Eastern &amp; General Syndicate, Ltd., 19, St» Swithin's Lane, E .C. 4, Dear Major Kolmes, At your request, I have pleasure in furnishing / the following resume of my career.- After gold mining in West Africa, I entered the oil 'business in Baku and remained there from 1903--1906, getting field combined/and geological experience. I then stayed on in Russia doing mining geological work until the end of 1908 when I joined the geological staff cf Messrs. S. Pearson &amp; Sons, Ltd. Oilfields Department in Mexico, whose service T left sfter one year to take charge of the Oil Geological Department for Messrs. Thompson &amp; Hunter (who have since dissolved partnership) and examined oil properties in various parts of the United States, Mexico, West Indies, South America, Roumania, Galicia and Russia until the outbreak of war when I had just finished a two years' survey in Eastern Bolivia, Including test drilling. During the war, I was attached to the staff of the Director of ¥orks in the Dardanelles, Salonika and Egypt, operating well drilling plant for water supply purposes. ThisITaj . 'F. Holmes. - 2 - 7tix Octo'ber, 19£4. was principally in Salonika, where about 120 wells were drilled to depths ranging from 3C0' to 700*, apart from an equal number of tube wells. 1 was seconded at the request of the Government of Egypt to undertake Petroleum Research in that country from the end of 1917 and resigned this work in 1920 to become Professor of Petroleum Technology in Birmingham University, after first making an examination for oil in the Kejaz. In 1922 T resigned 'the Chair and have since devoted myself to private practice, carrying out investigations in St. John T s Island in the Red Sea, in Egypt and in Peru, Just recently I have advised an important Government Department about a 77ater Supply. Yours fa ithful1y, EB/.JTranslation of letter No t34 /9/9 date5 28th October, from Political A^ent Bahrain to Shaik Hamad Bin Saea C .S .I. A.C. I have tifei honour to inform Y.E. that in accordance with your request I comuniBated with the Eastern General Syndicate regarding sinking wells for your towns of Menameh &amp; Muharaq &amp; they replied that they were prepared to undertake the work,As further explained to Y.E. I again communicated with them and asked for further details &amp; they have intimated that their terms wojild 'be as follows- They propose to sink two wells,one in Menameh 4 one in Muharra approximately at the places you know of &amp; will sink them to a d pth of six hundred fefet unless sufficient water should be reached before that depth. &amp; they will complete tne wells in accordance with the requirements of engineering to mike them entirely ready for use. They will charge for this work a sum of one lac of rupees which they would require to be paid in tw instalments « fifty thousand rupees on acceptance of the agree -ment &amp; the balance on completion of the work. It is understo that the entire expentidure of providing the apparatus &amp; carry aing out the work is to be borne by them for this price. As arranged with you Your friend also enquired of them what price per foot of depth they would charge in case Y.E. should desire more wells after tne two first.Tney reply that as the nature of the ground to be bored cannot be known till they mmake the first experiments it is difficult for them to fix a price but that it would be between 50 &amp; 60 rupees per foot including completion of the well. They say that if you accept they can send the machine &amp; engineers at once, I shall be gl^t if Y.B will inform your friend wkether you wish to make such an agrement with the company or not.If you decide to do so &amp; are anxious to get the work started this winter I wouldUTS TASTW JUID GTBrRHAL STflDI 0A'iT3, LIl!!

Major C.K.Daly, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrein, Dear Major, I have looked /the rough calculations regarding possible water distribution which you asked me for and they are as follows. Without a careful survey, particularly in the matter of levels, over the ground where it is proposed to distribute it would oe unwise t-o embark on any scheme of gravity flow relying solely upon the static head of the well. A slight rise might completely block the rlow if it were far enough from the starting point. However, let us assume that a practicable route lies from the well past the Persian School to the corner of the main street running south west to the Baaar, and that here we divide and oroceed north east and south west. A rough estimate of the length of the main line is .; / &gt;) feet, that northwards 1500 feet and the other 2250 feet. It is obvious that the northern branch would have to keep north of the hill between the Mission and the Wireless. Now, a likely velocity of flow would be 1 foot per second, and anything less than 4 inches would be an insufficient ahrein agents: M. YATEEM BROS. kble address: ;ensynd, Bahrein,' je —BroomhallsMaj. C.K.D. 2. 29/5/25. diameter for the trunk line. A veloerity of 1 foot oer second means about gallons per hour. The loss of head would be 4 .9 feet. Similarly, the longer brench might have a larger abater than the shorter in order to balance and keeping to the same velocity we should find that a ^ inch pipe would pass 1100 gallons per hour and for the shorter branch a 2v inch pipe would pass 770 gallons oer hour, a total of 1870 sufficiently near to that of the trunk line, any difference being used up by a station at the junction. The loss in head in the two branches would be ^.9 feet and 2.9 feet respectively and we should therefore be on the safe side of the available total head of about 10 feet. The larger branch might be reduced to 2-J- inch after the first station. Suppose we compare these figures with those for a pumping outfit. A 5 inch trunk line with a 7 foot per second velocity, and two 2% inch branches with 5 foot velocity, roughly equivalent in combined capacity to the trunk line, would only need a head of about 4^0 feet - not a great pumping proposition. Please do not take these calculations as other than ap proximate. I have no library with me or any hydraulic tables. I trust however they will be of some slight service.

The water is similar in quality to that of Adhari spring, the well has a depth of T98 feet and the principal source lies a few feet above this.

The sane applies to I'uharrai at perhaps slightly greater do ;th. As it vn.a the v.ish of my Directors that I advise your Exoellency upon the best method of utilising these boreholes, I recoiaiaendjthat, rather than attempt an elaborate pumpin t; and distributing pilint, you drill similar wells at convenient oentrns m the two towns and, ma ^ith a head such as the present well shows, there should be no difficulty in making each a self contained unit of distribution through medium of a simple assemblage of taps. ; i t have given much attention to the Heneni wells and their probable water source and find that the superior quality of water is probably due to a large admixture of rain water from the adjacent catchment area towards Jebal Dukhan This formation does not appear capable of yddlds comparable with that from the horizon already atruch in depth beneath the town of Uanamah.

With reference to the correspondence ending with this office telegram No. 54, dated the 6th February 1925, regarding the water-horing operations in Bahrain by the Eastern and General Syndicate, Ltd., Major Daly, during his visit to Bushire in March, 1925, informed Colonel Prideaux that the bore had not progressed beyond a depth of 100 feet, where it was piercing hard rock. 2. The departure of Hr. Madgwick, the Syndicate's geologist, for the United Kingdom on the 22nd June, was reported in Bahrain News, paragraph 100, o-ated txie 9th July 1925. 3. No later information appears to have been received of the Syndicate's operations, and the Hon'ble the - p oliiical Resident would be glad to receive a report on the progress made and the degree of success attained.

I have w ust had a long talk with Major Ho in e a on tlie subject of water and oil in Bahrain, lie arrived here on the 8th instant, and called on me at once, wing to a pressure of work at the end of the diving season, I had no opx)ortunity of discussing these questions thoroughly until today. as you know, the geological conditions in Bahrain are such that these two matters, water and oil, ..re somewhat inter mixed. The 'spring'' area is however apparently limited to that portion of the main island north of a line drawn due Kast and west through Rafaa Ash aharqi, and includes the x &amp; X xjr islands of Sitrali and Muharraq. ^ccordin^ to . ajor Holmes, it is only close to the above line or anywhere south of it that oil drii-ling operations could be safely carried out, without interfering with the spring water supply. ~e bases tiiis supposition on the theory that the spring water comes original-iy from the Persian side of the Guli, flowing between two layers of impervious rock, v/hich emerges at the suriaoe along a clearlj defined belt roughly paraltil wit., tne coast, similar springs to those in Bahrain being found in tyatif on 1 '• the main land. Thus any we Is drilled to the so th or mam land side of this belt should not interfere with the flow of thewater. In regard to the two experimental Artesian wells H/hich the iiastern and Gene, al Syndicate are now in the course jQt drilling, I explained in my letter Ho,do, 9^9 d^ted tiie 4ti October 1925 that after reaching water in the i-anamah ..ell, 1 the Syndicate had transferred their plai t to ^anaiiaq. Colonel F.B .Prideaux, c.I.i'., Political Resident in the .ersian Guli. &gt; %II. after drilling lor a iew da^s only, they liave already reached a, depth- of aDout. thirt y ^.ecb. as the water encountered in the Manamah we 1 is apparently the same as that from which the principal springs on the island are derived, and as the veil is located sli^htl,, to the ttorth of IL kslzjl the line of springs, support would appear to be given to the above- mentioned theory that the source of the water must be looked for on the Persian side of the Gulf. In regard to the quality of the v/ater found and the prospect of finding fresher water at a freater depth, Major Httlmes had much to say. He waLi convinced in the first place that the salt found in the water when it was first struck has now been reduced more than 50% (and with this, after tasting the water today, I agree J, and he considers in the second place that there is danger of polluting the whole v /ater supply of Bahrain by dril-iing deeper through the lower layer of impervious rock, where there might just as likely be sait as fresh water. He is however quite willing to do ^o as far as the contracted depth of 600 feet, but only on written instructions from the Sheikh in re^ly to a letter from him indicating clearly the risxs involved. 1 have aaiced him to address such a letter to the ^heikh, but, 1 would not consider it advisable to instruct hiia to bore deeper, until the water at present flowing from the wexl has seen puoperli tested, and further t ina order to reduce the risk to a manxmum) antxl a well has been drilled outside the spring area, and indicat- -ions have been found of the probable geological conditions below the lower layer of rock. This would be possible if the Syndicate were to obtain an oil concession in .. at r Major Ho lines argues however that there never was any ' real prospect of striking any other t-.an the local spring I Mr. Madgewick is. he says, the best geological expert that the Syndicate have, and his considered opinion is that the Haneni w^lls are purely rain seepages. I was rather amused by a remark i-ajor Holmes madeIII. wliil® on the subject of the relative possibilities of water and oil in Bahrain, lie said, 'the wealth of iaiirain lies in the water'! This seemed an extraordinary remark from a man who has come to negotiate an oil concession, which is a far more valuable proposition for ' is Syndicate than arij amount of Artesian well dri-iingl He was ax lading of co rse to the va-ue of this water for irrigation purposes, if properly controlled and distributed over the island. Major Holmes is sure that time will show that the wUl water encountered in the llanamah well^eventually satisfy the highest aspirations of the people of Bahrain for a good and plentiful supply of drinking water, but he is ready within a reasonable time to dril- deeper, if Sheikh ila ad is ready to take the risk. This seems to me to be a fair deal. For the sake of convenience, I will deal t 'ith the question of oil in a separate let^ex.

Reference your Memorandum Ho. 102/9/9, dated the 4th December 1925. . 4 The question of the Water Scheme seems to be mainly a ^ State matter, only affecting the Government of India if the financial condition of the State is unduly strained. It seems to me that^ until the benefits of the two existing bores have been clearly demonstrated, care should be taken against preparing too amoitious a scheme. I would advise that first an efficient scheme be ^ prepared and carried out for the distribution Ox the water, now running to waste, at Qadhaibya (outsiae Manama) ana in Kuharraq town.

To what extent can this be allowed, and, if the right is denied, on what grounds can it be refuted ? isb stated above, I would lilce to see the chief energy of the State now devoted to the organization of efficient arrangements to dispose of water now produced by the two bores already sunk. It might be advantageous to the State to invite the Executive Engineer, Eushire, over to Bahrain for, say, a month to look into the subject technically and advise on general lines Major Holmes has informed me that he has agreed to a rate of Es. 15,500 per well sunk.

His Excellency is desirous of making a final inspection of both mells as soon as he hears from you that they are in every respect complete in accordance with your contract. There is one point however which His Excellency wishes me to bring to your notice^ and in view of which he does not feel prepared to recognise that the letter and the spirit of your contract in regard to these wells has been carried out. You are ^doubtless aware that one of the main conditions of the contract was that both wells should be completed during last cold weathe Mid your Syndicate further guaranteed continuous work from arrival of the plant in Bahrain. His Excellency feels sure that you will a^ree that neither the condition nor the guarantee furDeen fulfilled. Under the oiroumstanceB he is of opinion that hie State ie entitled to norne reasonable compensation from your Syndicate for the delay in completion of the wells, particularly in view of the fact that the expectations of his subjects in Moharraq were severely disappointed by having to undergo the hardship of another (and a very trying) summer without a proper water supply. Hie Excellency will be glad to hear from you in writing that you accept his point of view in this matter 9 in which case he has asked me to discuss with you some equitable arrangement by which the contract may be finally concluded.

The last occasion upon which I saw Colonel Prideaux a^ the Agency and in your presence it was suggested by him I belie-'e that I should go into the question of distributing the water from the wells sunk by us. I agreed to do this but am in some doubt as to how far His Excellency wishes me to go in the matter.

Dear Sir, We understand t hat the sinking of a well and erection of a water tank on the Customs Pier is contemplated 'by the local Authorities and if such is really the case and this site has actually 'been decided on, we 'beg to protest most strongly against such a scheme, and request you to 'be good enough to loolc into the matter with a view to getting the proposed site charged as we consider the one, we have - been told of is most unsatisfactory so far as our interests are concerned. There is already considerable congestion on the pier v/ith Import and Export cargo and the Mainland and Moharaq. traffic and the erection of a well and v/ater tanjf- on it will only increase the congestion and the risk of and •» difficulty in preventing pilferage and theft of cargo which we are compelled to laiid on the Pier, where it lies at our risk until it is convenient for the Customs to take over same,, \If the Customs are prepared to take delivery and assume responsibility for cargo immediately it is landed on the Pier as should 'be, then of course we have nothing to say 'but otherwise we protest most strorgly against a public well 'being erected on the pier and which will tend to increai the congestion already existing there. A well in the vicinity of the Custom House - would undoubtedly be a boon and very convenient for craft requiring water, but we submit that if the well was erected on the shore nearby instead of on the actual Pier it would be equally convenient for boats and would certainly be much more convenient for supplying the Bazaar and dwelling houses in the vicinity of the Custom House.

I unaerstood from you that you objected to this permission as contrary to the terms of your agreement with the Bahrein Government whereby you obtained the sole right of exploring for oil etc., and that you inter preted your agreement witii Shaikh Hamad, as precluding anyone from boring for water outside Municipal limits. I informed you that I did not agree with your contention, as your monopoly was to search for oil etc only and I was oi opinion that it did not prohibit other persons from Obtaining water for agricultural and other private purposes. as you still held your own opinion 1 thought it would be as well to see Khali 1 Kanoo about the matter. He has written me a letter in which he states 'my boring will be confined to private^ lands, and if oil or any signs ol it is lound in any of my wells, I would at once inform the Government in case the above licence i^ concerned with it 1 . He has also assured me verbally that he has no connection with the ivnglo Persian ar any other oil Company and is concerned only with the production of water as a commercial proposition in the same way as he bought motor boats and motor cars to Banrem as a commercial venture. He claimed that Shaikh Hamad had stated publicly in open *.a u lis that so far from objecting to his bringing water boting plant he would welcome it as benefial to his people. This I know to be true.

The principal correspondents in the file are the Political Agent at Bahrain (Major Clive Daly until September 1926, Lieutenant-Colonel Cyril Barrett thereafter), Major Frank Holmes, representative of the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited, F. Madgwick, geologist, and Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah, deputy ruler of Bahrain.After the forced abdication of Shaikh ‘Īsá bin ‘Alī Āl Khalīfah in 1923, public works projects in Bahrain, such as the sinking of artesian wells for the municipal water supply, were able to go ahead under the instigation of Shaikh Ḥamad (folios 28-30). The Eastern and General Syndicate Limited (London), represented by Major Frank Holmes, was awarded the contract to sink two wells in Manama and Muharraq to depths of 600 feet, in search of fresh water. The total expected cost of this first phase was 100,000 rupees (folio 5). A total of 300,000 rupees had been set aside by the Bahrain Government for the implementation of a water supply in Bahrain (folio 76). The Manama well struck good-quality water at 200 feet, and although Shaikh Ḥamad was keen to continue drilling to 600 feet, Holmes convinced the Shaikh against further drilling (folios 63-68). In the wake of the first two wells, water tanks capable of holding thirty tonnes of water were installed, and new contracts between Holmes and the Bahrain Government drawn up for the sinking of a further twelve wells, with the installation of the necessary pipework and tanks (folios 79-80, 82-83).A minor diplomatic incident was avoided when, in December 1924, the
                           Baghdad Timesreported that Holmes was travelling to Bahrain with drilling equipment. The Secretary of State for the Colonies wrote to the Resident, reminding him to in turn remind Shaikh Ḥamad that the British Government recognised the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's exclusive right to negotiate concessions for the exploratory drilling of oil in Bahrain (folio 39). The Resident replied to the High Commissioner in Baghdad that Holmes was interested only in sinking wells for water (folio 42). A later disagreement in 1927 arose between Holmes and the Bahrain merchant Khalil Kanoo, over the sinking of water wells in Bahrain. Holmes, who had by this point signed a concession to drill for oil in the state, objected to Kanoo's proposals to sink his own water wells in Manama (folios 108-14).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern and General Syndicate Limited, oil company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Khalīfah (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Water supply</topic></subject><subject><topic>Economic reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Political reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Law reform</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000367#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
