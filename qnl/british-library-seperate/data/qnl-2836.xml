The early correspondence relates to setting up suitable arrangements to fill Belgrave’s role in Bahrain while he took six months leave in the summer of 1934.The rest of the file is predominantly concerned with general discussions regarding the alteration of Belgrave’s terms of service, covering his pay and leave, as well as specific arrangements for his leave in India in the early 1940s.In the final folios of the file, the correspondence discusses increasing opposition to Belgrave within Bahrain in the late 1940s. Of particular interest are folios 124-126, these being an anonymous letter from ‘the people of Bahrain’ to the Minister of Colonies in London, expressing their discontent with Belgrave’s position of power. Folio 137 is an English translation of an article that appeared in
                           Arab Worldmagazine, condemning Belgrave. The Arabic original is contained on Folio 150.The file also contains a limited amount of correspondence (in Arabic and English) between the Political Agency in Bahrain and Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah regarding Belgrave's contract and pay.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00016a#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00016a#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00016a#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00016a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
