I am naturally anxious to do national service, particularly in the country that I know best, and if a commission in the Indian Army is still open to me I should have no hesitation in accepting it. The mention of French as one of my languages was made in my letter to the Commander in Chief in view- of the possibility, as I supposed at the time, of operations through French Somaliland.

Sir, In the event of forces being sent from India for operations in Ethiopia, I have the hono rr to offer myself for service. For many years I was Governor of the State Bank in Addis Ababa, and I have frequently passed through the country between the coast and the capital. I speak and write French with complete ease, and I have a sufficient smattering of Araharic, although little of the peasant and nomad languages (Galla, Harrari, Dankali etc.) I confess to being beyond the regulation military age, but I am lean and fit for a campaign. T happen to be in India on a business trip (there seemed to be no service that could use me at home) and am free to move at any notice. Being a close friend of the Emperor Haile Sellassie and still possessing hosts of friends in Ethldpia, my presence would be wel come there, and useful in easing first contacts. I have the honour of being a C.M.G., and am well known to the Foreign Office in London. In Simla I am known to the Finance De partment (in connection with Maria Theresa thalers, which inciden tally would be required in quantity'for a campaign in Ethiopia), and to Major Tarver whom I recently met -there; in Peshawar I am known to Major Robinson, and in Kabul to our Legation.

In view of circumstances explained under (h) in paragraph No.2, we agree that it would be somewhat unfair to Collier to endeavour to persuade the Afghan Government at this late stage not to iclude a deal with him. We still hope however Uniat no transaction will go through involving the purchase of unsuitable armaments 0 ^ cu / Ll 'fb-y 7 1 p 1 - 3. If, as is believed, the Afghans wish tc ^•turn to us for assistance in equipping and organising ' their army with a view to meeting a possible threats C. from the (? omission), they could not, we think, reasonably regard our advice in a matter of this nature as unwarranted interference. '• *Conf 1ND Dear Crombie, In response to your request for our views on the points raised in Fraser-Tytler T s telegram TT o.76 of the 13th April about Mr, Collier’s proposal to establish an agency in Kabul, we feel that it would be best if the Minister could avoid saying anything further to the Afghan Government about Mr. Collier. They have already been told that he has no official backing whatever and it seems to us that it would be inconsistent with this to say anything further which might be interpreted as a recommendation. It is equally undesirable, seeing that he has been allowed to proceed to Kabul, to tell the Afghans anything to his detriment. If the Minister has to say anything it might be that he has no information about Mr. Collier’s present commercial standing. 2. We have no reason to suppose that Mr. Collier would not do his best to carry through any transaction entrusted G.E. Crombie, Esq. RECd. POL. DEPt. i ^ APR 940 INDIA OFFICE% entrusted to him, for failure to do so would presumably have an adverse effect both on his pocket and on his reputation. As a former Manager of the Bank of Ethiopia he no douot has, or could soon establish, any necessary ousiness contacts in London, but we have no means of judging whether business firms would be prepared to rely upon him. As you know, v/e have found him unreliable in certain respects and this fact is bound to undermine our confidence in him. !e should not like to recommend in any way to the Afghan Government a man who might at some stage let them or us down. 3. ,/e agree with the Minister that there might be some advantage in having a really reliable Englishman in Kabul to act as agent for firms in the United Kingdom, but in view of Mr. Collier f s previous connexion v/ith Ethiopia and of the fact that His Majesty's Government have declined to give him official backing (which some 1irm represented by him might eventually require), we do not feel that he is in present circumstances suitable as an agent. We cannot presumably take any steps to prevent his establishing an agency in Kabul, if he can do so entirely on his own responsibility.4. Whatever it may or may not he desirable to say to the Afghan Government, we should he glad if the Minister could he told for his own guidance, if you agree, that Mr. Collier is certainly not reliable. A recent example of this was his recent visit to Cairo, where he contrived to go in spite of the fact that his passport had been endorsed ’'not valid for Egypt'. 'fhile there he seems to have made some sort of proposal to the Egyptian Government in regard to the supply of arms and ammunition by a Greek firm. /file copy v.z. 2166 _!£±aJ JMj C- Allotted to Political Department , Copies to Foreign Office . 2765.

Mr. Collier who arrived in Kabul in February in connection with Briquetting machinery is still here. He is negotiating about arms and is also trying to pidk up business with the Public V/orks Ministry. He talks vaguely of establishing -j an agency in Kabul. I have made it clear to him and the Afghan Government that he has no official backing whatever. At the same time I should like to be in a position to inform the Afghan Government if necessary how far they can rely on him to carry through any transaction with which he may be entrusted, whether he is really in touch with business in London, whether he is really reliable, etc. Can you advise me on these points ? 4. You will realise that there might be considerable advantage in having a really reliable Englishman here at present : o act as agent with firms in Britain, but an i nreliable man might do us a lot of harm. I hear good reports of Collier and he impresses me on the whole favourably, but I should like to know something more about h:m, and how he is looked on by you and the Foreign Office. Ends.

Apai-t from the above ammunition this factory can turn out ammunition of any calibre, as well as shells of any diameter. It is no use quoting Sot diameters which may not interest them, and if you will let me know by cable what are the diameters which would be of interest to them, and for what type of guns these shells are destined, I can ob tain prices and rate of delivery by cable and send you on this inform ation, also by cable. The above firm can however give immediate delivery of the following Artillery shells if the diameters of these should be suit able for Afghanistan: 40.000 Artillery Shells for 105 m.m. guns 20.000 Artillery Shells for 155 m.m.guns.

I am en closing the original letter which the manufacturers of this material L ve sent me and which speaks for itself. I think that in view of the fact that immediate delivery can be given the authorities should find this offer a very attractive one, moreover the terms of payment by which 50 # of the value of the goods could be paid in one and two years or in raw materials should also be very attractive.
