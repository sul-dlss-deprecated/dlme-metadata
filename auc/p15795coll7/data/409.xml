A three-year resident of an apartment on Mohamed Mahmoud Street near Tahrir Square, ###### remained in Cairo after other foreign AUC students and neighbors departed. She attended the January and February 2011 protests at Tahrir Square daily, taking photographs and videos to document events for friends in the United States. ###### says friendships with activists offered insight into the role of young upper and middle class participants and Facebook and Twitter commentators, but highlights the important part played by the young and poor men fighting against state security forces. She emphasizes the spirit of unity despite the diversity of participants, and relates interactions with conservative Muslim men. ###### witnessed a number of violent incidents (including snipers shooting from the roof of AUC buildings) and noticed people infiltrating the university along with demonstrators protecting the campus and defending shops from looters. ###### also describes the role of the military on January 28 and beyond. She describes the medical field clinics set up to treat injured protesters and other organized aspects of the Tahrir demonstrations, such as the provision of food and a lost-and-found area. ###### offers the perspective of a foreigner active in the protests, mentioning her sense of inclusion and safety in Tahrir. Despite this she reports that on February 4, in the wake of state television broadcasts prompting suspicion of foreigners, she was arrested and turned over to the military police, repeatedly accused of espionage during her 20 hours of detention. ###### covers events after the initial 18 days, including the attack on Coptic Christians at Maspero in October 2011 and the December 2011 demonstrations against the Supreme Council for the Armed Forces (SCAF) that turned violent, and discusses activists’ tactics such as the Kazeboon movement to expose abuses by the military. ###### also joined women’s rights groups in anti-SCAF protests and other rights activism in late 2011 and early 2012. She critiques AUC’s support efforts for students during the uprising and addresses the impact of the revolution at the university, including strikes on campus, drawing a comparison with other schools in Egypt.</dc:description><dc:date>2012-03-15</dc:date><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:identifier>20120315</dc:identifier><dc:relation>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution</dc:relation><dc:source>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution oral histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2012, American University in Cairo.
