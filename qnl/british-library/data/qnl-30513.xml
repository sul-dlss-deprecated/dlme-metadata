TRIBAL. 15. Reference paragraphs 188 to 130 of 1950. It is reported that the Imam has ordered three hundred men of Yal &gt; 7 ahibah and a hundred of El Kubus to go to Dhahirah to put a stop to the kidnapping and selling of slaves. The force vd.ll be upder two leaders named Said bin Hamed, Mali of Avabi, which is between Nakhl and Rostaq, and Safyan bin ' ohammed bin Abdullah al Amiri, The Imam has also instructed Mohammed bin Salim bin Zahir El Ruqaishi, ali of Ibri, Adam and Izki to assist them, and to stay in Ibri and bring to book any one under suspicion of kidnapping, whether A.mir bin Saleh Waled al Hatawa oir the bani Qitab or anyone else. Should they fail in this attempt he is said to be contemplating going after the culprits himself, TOUR S - _Agency Surgeon. 16. On the 30th and 31st Decp^M«r the Assistant Agency Surgeon and First Munshi of this ConsiO at- ■ ^nt ou. on a. tour of Sib, Ghala and Boshar, with the concurrence of the Musew Government. 17. On their arrival at Sib they called on the Mali, Saiyid Mohammed bin Ahmud, and ■ ave him their letter of introduction from the Muscat Gcv^rnmont, The Mali was very glad to meet the Doctor as he was himself suffering from eye trouble. He also showed considerable interest in the war in Korea. On the subject of the recent kidnapping he stated that Sib was too strong a place for the raiders to tackle. He thought that many of the bedouins of Oman were responsible and not onlyO *1 -3- not only Amir bin Saleh 1 7aled al IIatav 7 a ; at v/hose door mosb oases v^ore laid ovdng to his having gained certain notoriety. 18. Several patients v/ere treated for eye trouble and malaria, but as the Mali's askaris had been lazy in giving out the news of the doctor’s arrival, there were fewer patients than might othen T /ise have been the case. At Ghala and Boshar the T ali, Saiyid Hilal, v/hose hone is Waddi Samail, received them, and he appears to have been on good terms with a former Political Agent, Pajor Hickinbotham, from whom he had received a case of cartridges. 20. He declared that the reports that Yahya had been nominated to succeed the present Imam were nothing but rumours and insisted that selection could only be made after the death of the Imam. He would hazard no guess as to what might happen. 21. Some patients were treated, but the v7ali asked for more notice to be given on another occasion. It seems that touring doctors or portable dispensaries would be well received and a general scheme on these lines should be within the scope of the Pus cat Government if they could train up a few compounders with sets of simple remedies and instructions to advise more serious cases to be brought to Kuscat* Such an effort would certainly have a good effect among the people, and far more information about the conditions in the interior ’would beecne available. It is hoped to be able to spare the Assistant Agency Surgeon for other tours of a similar nature. GV7ADUR NEI7S . 22. i essers Hoodbhoy &amp; Bros, the local E,I.
