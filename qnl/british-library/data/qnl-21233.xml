The Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir s ( I hare the honour to enclose for the information of the Hobble the Political Resident the contract which it is proposed that His Rxcellency Shaikh Hamad should grant to Hr. . William Benjamin Steele as State Engineer. 2. In mj opinion since Bahrain is an independent ^rab State a fact which has fre aientlj been stressed.the matter does not require the concurrence of the Government of India and if the iIon f ble the Political Resident/maj be settled forthwith. In our capacity of protecting foreign interests in Bahrain we are interested to see that a British subject receives fair pay according to his qualifications. On behalf of the State we are interested to see that the appointment is necessary,that the salary proposed is a reasonable one and that there is no State subject who is capable of filling it. These conditions are fulfilled but in case the Hon f ble the Political Resident decides to make a reference to the Government of India I will briefly recapitulate tne circumstances in which Mr.Steele was engaged. 3. When the electric installation was completed by Messrs * Callenders ? Cable &amp; Construction Company it was part of the agreement that they should supply an engineer to run it for 6 ~ months or a year if required to do so by the Bahrain Government. The engineer originally in charge of the wzwk was Mr .Jordan, but last cold weather it was necessary to divert him e&amp;sewher and the work was completed by Mr.Steele. Mr Jordqn,however retui.returned to run the plant for the Bali rain Government and Mr.Steele proceeded on leave. 3. Since no suitable Muslim could be found to run the installation and His Excellency Shaikh Hamad was averse to employing 1 a foreigner who was a non-British subject it was deciaea to engage a European engineer who would be a State servant and release Messrs Callenders T Construction and Cable Company from their obligation to run the plant. In addition to running the plant he was to be State Engineer,an arrange- % mant which would benefit the State greatly for such a man could be acquired for less than they were paying Messrs Callenders 1 and at the sametime find- a person qualified to undertake any other engineering work in which the gtate wmtler require^the need of skilled assistance yesd;. 4. It was originally proposed to engage Mr.Jordan but he was not found satisfactory ana ^r.Steele,who curing his short time in Bahrain,had worked to the full satisfaction of the State,became a candidate for the post. V/hilst on leave Ir.Belgrave settled the terms with him to which Shaikh Hamad gave his consent. Mr Steele thereupon resigned his post with Messrs Callenders 7 and came out to Bahrain. The matter was pe^cipitatea by the fact that it was considered advisable to dispense with Mr.Jordan 7 s services as soon as possible and I did not find it possible to refer the whole matter to the iion 7 ble the Political Besident before Mr.Steele 1 arrival as I did not have sufficient data to go on. 5. The contract has not yet been signed j^y His Excellency Shaikh Hamad but Mr.Steele has arrived and has undertaken the work and is giving full satisfaction. His contract is reasonable and is on the same lines as that of Mr.Belgrave. I propose,therefore,that I should be empowered to inform His Excellency Shaikh Hamad that the Hon 7 ble the Political Resident has no objection to his engagement and that the contract may be signed by him without further delay.——- • 7 6 . I am aware that objections exist to importing more Europeans into a State like Bahrain but neither Mr.Belgrare nor mjrself hare been able to find an/ alternative. A properlj qualified Muslim cannot be found and since a non- Bahraini would have to be emplo/ed the Arabs would prefer a person like Mr.Steele to an/ other qualified engineer who ma/ be found. Moreover,the State has alread/ had experience of Mr.Steele's work, which is a ver/ important things and the expense of his salary can be fully met by the receipts from the electric light undertaking. 7. I propose that the contract should be subject to the arbitration of the iion T ble the Political Resident as is done in the contracts of other European State servants.

Dated the 27th November1940. Dear Belgrave, It is very difficult to hear well on our telephone, voices are so indistinct as to b e almost and says that it is almost boneless to try and use it between the Air Liaison Officer, Naval Base and Cable and Wireless office. I think Steele is responsible for this and I would be very grateful if you could kindly instruct him to have the matter put right. inaudible. Hallows also complains about his connection Yours sincerely, B. O. Alban. C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire, C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain.D*0* ! T o# C/61 'Dated the 18th January 1941* I have ventured to send to you from time to tirae copies of correspondence exchanged between myself and Delgrave in which I have been drawing attention to the general feeling amongst all classes in Bahrain that electrical charges levied by the State Electric Department are excessive and endeavouring to show that there Is justification for this complaint. I have also pointed out that individual consumers like this Agency did produce, and could now without any douot again produce, their own requirements of electricity at very much lower costs than they arc now paying to the &gt;tate. Both Belgrave and Eteele have now given up trying to argue to the contrary since the point, in view of the figures which I gave in my last letter, cannot be seriously disputed. Various excuses have also been advanced to try end show that Bahrain has to charge more for its current than Basra or Karachi. 1 have, however, been fortunate enough to be able to quote some ^ figures showing that the electric plant at Kuwait is producing current at a caeaper raue than in Manama although the number of consumers is only about 400 instead of 1300-. 1400 as in Manama and Muharraq. Even this however is dismissed by Steele as being merely a small plant run by an Arab in a cheap way. 2. I followed up my last letter to Belgrave by a discussion with him in which I attempted to discover how the sum of fe 1,05,596 quoted by him in paragraph 4 of his demi-official letter No. 1778/9A-SE dated the 19th December 1940, which was said to be toe cosu ox generating current, had been spent. (This figure is the same as that given on page 50 of the last I \ The Hon* ble Lieut-Colonel Dahrain/- C. G. Prior. C. I. E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire2 Bahrain Annual Report for the year 1358). I was however unc oxe to obtain infor/nation on the subject although the accounts are kept in the Adviaerate* We were unable to find out anything about fuel costs, stores, amount of staff emp loyed, salaries, depreciation etc. It was not possible to discover anything about the sum of nearly P~ 30,000 on account of depreciation i,e, the articles on which it is charged, the date of commencement of depreciation on each article and the date when the cost of each item has been recovered in full. Before leaving therefore, I asked Belgrave for another meeting at which Steele should be present and at which full details of the different items of expenditure might be produced, 3. On the 15th January Belgrave and Steele arrived at the Agency but I was much disappointed to find that they had no papers of any value. Belgrave produced a file from his office which purported to contain statements of expenditure on various items of fuel, salaries, stores, depreciation. Hut on going into the question we found that it contained a mass of odd papers, some undated, some unsigned, some type written, others evidently Jottings by some clerk scrawled all over the paper. The papers for one year could not be found. Depreciation on old machines bought ten years ago is said to have been charged at the rate of 12p per cent per annum and the full cost to have been recovered. But as the plant is good for many years more service, depreciation is continuing to be charged so that in course of time the consumer will have paid for the plan ce over, but the figures shown do not throw any light on the matter as old purchases and new pur chases are all lumped together and depreciation charged on the lot. With regard to personnel a list of personnel was handed to me but when we proceeded to go through it Steele became confused over the duties of the various employees and whether /-3 - whether their pay is really debitable to the Electric Depart- ment or not* 4. I am afraid that a state of confusion prevails and that neither Belgrave nor Steele really know^ where they stand or where the enormous expenditure of over one lakh of rupees per annum is really going to* The plant itself is of course good and the actual cost of fuel to oroduce electricity works out at some very small figure (about farthings per unit perhaps) while ©11 the rest represents expenditure on personnel, stores, depreciation and other indeterminate items* A large amount of Indian staff is still being employed, i*e* Superintendent, Assistant Foreman, station Fitter, and two out of three drivers are Indians, as well as higher paid electricians etc. These men ere also given house allowance totalling ! 3,000 a year. There are also various items which strike the eye such as State engineer's car (he gets free ear), petrol, his driver (Ks 50 a month), workshop expenditure (Fs 135 a month for a motor mechanic), enormous outside staff costing Ks 11,640; overhead salaries of Ps 16,000: and the amount of the State Engineer* s salary of about K 1000 a month which is also debited, though I was previously, wrongly, assured by Helgrave that it was not being debited. I enclose a copy of the pay roll of the Electric department as handed to me by Belgrave* I am afraid however that the whole thing is in a very chaotic state. I understand from de Grenier that when he looked into the stores while Acting Adviser he found that store ledger was never inspected and it appeared very likely that the stores ware not being kept under careful supervision. 5. I am afraid that the most urgent need for reforms lies in the State Electric Department which appears to b e in a worse state than the Police Force about which we already have Hallows’ Report. The fact th?rt the State Electric Department is a commercial department supposed to be under an- 4 - 'V an enginaar where one must expect the engineer in charge to know where he stands and where the most careful accounts should be kept, makes matters worse in this case as compared with the Police. The position appears to b e that when Steele wants money he goes and gets it from the Treasury and the Treasury then note this down as expenditure under the Electric Department. There is nothing to show whether the money has been properly spent on electricity or whether it has been used for some other State services. I am convinced after much enquiry that if we had a responsible mnn in charge of the State Slectric Department the plant could be run at an economic and reasonable cost as the makers intended that it should be# At the present moment the door is open for every sort of abuse and I should be much surprised if abuses were not taking place every day. 6. I understood from Weightman when I took over in Karachi that Steele’s services would have been terminated had not the war broken out. ha also told me that the situation was un- satisfrctory and he has noted this in the last Annual deport ot this Agency. Furber is now making strenuous efforts to leave the State and join the Army and during a conversation with him recently I asked his opinion as to v/hether the State Electric Department could not be run more economically. Fe said that in his opinion there was no doubt that it certainly could: that it was undoubtedly over-staffed and that the public on account of the high charges are reducing their consumption of electricity by buying cheap Japanese bulbs and by using very little light in their homes. 7* In my opinion Steele is lazy ©nd has no aptitude for his present work although he might possibly have been good m the past when he was a subordinate under proper supervision by his Company. Here, he has been content to muddle along any how, to engage staff here there and everywhere without much /-- 5 - niuch regard as t*o whether t,he need v/ae Xagit.iina'td or not** supervision is very l*&gt;x and my enquiries shov; that the work of one day is charged up for two or three days even* The excuse that in other towns power is eonvsumed on factories etc* is not valid because the man, Hussein Yateem, v/hc actually did taxe State power for his ice plant was driven to buy his own generating set which is now working at &amp; profit* He was incidentally T believe treated in a somewhat dis courteous manner by the State Rlectric department at the time* Arabs and others who wish to see the State Engineer to discuss problems etc*, are not seen by him but told to go and see tne Head &lt;^lerk* i do not remember meeting anv official so disliked ooth by Arabs, Indians and Europeans as ateele an! I think that in view of his record his presence in charge ct Che Electric department is undesirable, and might be terminated as soon as can be arranged* fortunately, his contract can be terminated at throe months* notice by either side without the necessity of giving any reasons; but if any reason is required there is no doubt that he is in competent and is ruining his department. The State had also had to suffer losses in the past which I personally think 1 i could have been avoided had thore been a reasonably efficient man in charge. Other branches of the Engineering Department are in the same condition; there is general dissatisfaction over the telephone system for which we have to pay heavily and in return for which we have an inefficient service which is constantly breaking down, antique telephones bought up as second hand junk discarded by the Indian Posts and Telegraphs department, I believe. There is no automatic exchange to this day although it has been talked about for some years (vide page 35 Bahrain Administrative Report for the years 1926-1937). I have also been pressing the matter without apparent effect. 8 /- h i- 6 - B* j.U seems that British employees in the service of the State are engaged only with the approval of Government and should you consider, in the light of the remarks made in this letter, that his services should be disoensed with it might probably be sufficient for me to inform Belgrave .. ,, s fia$ tnat Government withdrawn its approval of the appoint ment oi Gtsele in the services of the Bahrain State and that his services should therefore be ten.inated according to the terms of his contract* As regards a I’elief, Belgrave would presumably arrange that Furber should take over the work on probation with the prospect of being confirmed if satisfactory after, say, one year. The situa tion is rather complicated now by the fact that Furber has renewed his efforts to leave the Btate as he says that his present work as Assistant State Engineer could be done by anybody of lesser qualifications and with this I am inclined to agree* The military authorities however have already kepi, him waiting for nearly a year without giving a satisfactory reply and so I thin)' he probably will still be available for another month or so. It is possible of course that he would refuse to accept the pest of State Engineer or that Belgrave might refuse to have him but this hardly seems likely* If however Furber’s services were not available steps could at once be taken to obtain a capable man of the right qualifications from India or elsewhere. Yours sincerely,Confidential (OvcfU'oJt oJ -'/’■ ^4-, V/3-4. D.0 .Ho .106-S The Residency, Bushina, the 30th January 1941. Dear Alban, V/ill you please refer to your demi-official letter No.C/61, dated the 18th January 1941, on the subject of the i Bahrain State Electrical Department ? 2. Before taking any drastic action against Steele it will be advisable to have some facts and figures on which to base it. So long as we rely on Steele to produce them it is obvious that they will not emerge and as the matter is tech nical it is difficult for laymen to express an opinion however convinced one may be of his inefficiency. 3. 1 think the best way of dealing with the matter will be as follows (a) The Oil Company should be approached confidentially and asked if they could spare an electrical engineer and, if necessary, an accountant, who would be capable of overhauling the Electrical Department and expressing an authoritative opinion as to its efficiency or the reverse, and make suggest ions for improvements in its working. (b) If they are preoared to assist, you should inform Belgr-ve that the dissatisfaction of the Bahrain public with the Electricity Department has grown to a point where it reflects seriously on the administration, and that i would be glad if he would arrange for an expert or experts from the oil Company to overhaul it and report on its administration. This investigation would naturally be at the expense of the Bahrain ? Government, and Steele would have to place himself and his Major B.G.E.vY. Alban office /- Political Agent, ' Bahrain.sasfc^. privately from Furber whether he would be prepared to remain if he was given the post of State Engineer. An Indian assis tant for the electrical side would probably meet all requirements for the present. (d) If the answers to (c)(i) and (c) (ii) are in the affirmatives, the question of giving Steele notice can be referred to me. If however Furber will not remain the matter will require further consideration as a European State Engineer will be hard to find in war time, and Steele is better than nothing. 4. Since the question of Steele’s appointment was referred to the Government of India it will be necessary to make a reference to t! em before we can recommend that he be given notice. My personal opinion has always beenthat the retention of inefficient but well paid Europeans in States under our control is a great mistake and has serious political repercussions. 5. 1 am sending a copy of t v is letter to Eeightman, and have already sent him copies of your above mentioned letter and your Printed letter No.71-6/13 of the 13th January 1941 and its enclosures.

Steele, who haa not been on home leave ^or over six years and has had during that time very little local leave, has applied formleave in June. \ Owing to certain reasons I think it is desirable that he should go. He is due about a year’s leave and by the end of that time he will have nearly reached retiring age. Steele does not wish to return. He feels, 1 think rightly, that he has more chance of finding a :ob at home during the war than if he waited until after the war. It would o -0 course suit us better i? he. worked here till the end. of the war and then left but I consider that it would be unfair to insist on this, even if it were possible. I believe Sir Geoffrey’s idea was that he should continue here till the end of the war and then we should, find some one else. ibis as Steele sees it, would be against his own interest. I think Steele should be allowed to go in June which means that we shall have to find a substitute by then. This will be difficult. I am making enquiries ^rom Messrs. Callender’s Cable and Construc tion Company, Limited, who have often helped us in the past and l should be obliged if an enquiry could be made from the Government India as to whether they could lend any one as a temporary arrangement till the end of the war in Europe when-3- when 1 think it would be possible to obtain a suit able man. increased since the war and it is essential that we should avoid any breakdown, in the electric supply which is now providing power ^or various war services. Steele manages transport and oil gauging as well but the latter could probably be undertaken temporarily by a man ^rom the Bahrain Petroleum Company. 1 would have suggested employing Purber, who till he joined the army was assistant here to Steele, but 1 know that he has agreed, to serve dor a year a^ter the end of the war. Before taking any active steps in the matter I should be grateful i^ you would acquaint Sir Geoffrey Prior with the position.

My dear niekinbotham, bteele, who haa not been on home leave for over aix yearo and has had, during that time, very little local leave, has applied for home leave in June. uwing to certain reasons I think it is desirable that he should go. fte is due about a year *s leave and by the end of th t time he will have nearly readied retiring age. Steele does not wish to return. He feels, I think rightly, that he has more chance of finding a job at home during the war than if he waited until after the war. It would of- course suit us better if he worked here till the end of the war and then left but I consider that it would bo unfair to insist on this, even if it were possible. 1 believe Sir Geoffrey* a idea was that he should continue here till the end f the war and then we should find someone else. This as Steele sees it, would be against his own interest. I think diode should be a!levied to go in June which a means that we shall have to find a substitute by then. This will be dificult. I am making enquiries from Messrs. Callander Cable and Construction Company, Limited, who have often helped us in the past and I should be obliged if an enquiry could be made from the Government of India as to whether they could lend any one as a temporary arrangement till the end of the war in Europe when I think it would be possible to obtain a suitable man. The importance of Steele’s work has greatly increased since the war and it is essential that we should avoid any b breakdown in the electric supply which is now providing power for various war services. Steele manages transpo t and oil gauging as well but the latter could probably be undertaken temporarily by a mm from the Bahrain ^etroieum Company. I kh would have suggested employing Curber, who till he joined the Armyw^s Assistant here to Steele, but I know that he hascoNPiniarriAL 10th February 1940.

Callender’s Cable and Construction Co., Ltd., Bombay, to my telegram and Steele’s letter asking them if they could recommend a relief ^or Steele. 2. 1 do not know exactly in what capacity Furber is working, but his address is 'Navy House, Port Said'. As it is probable that Furber would not relinquish his present post of his own accord would it be possible ^or the naval authorities either to second him -for duty with the Bahrain Government as State Engineer, Bahrain, or to release him from his present post under orders to resume 3 his duties with the Bahrain Government. 5. Should it be possible to second him ^rom the navy I presume that we should have to pay his present pay with additional allowances. When he left Bahrain he was drawing Rs. 750/- p.m., rising by increments of Rs. 50/- to Rs. BOO/- and thereafter by increments o^ Rs. 25/- to Rs. 1000/- with usual housing, leave and passage conditions. If on the other hand he was re leased ^rom Service employment he would resume employ ment on his previous agreement with some addition of pay.

Although it is highly desirable that Mrs. Steele should leave Bahrain as early as possible I really do not consider that we should be in any way justified in asking for an n A' priority for her and two of her children. Nor do I think that Steele himself is deserving of special consideration. It is quite possible for the family to travel overland to Cairo or they could take their chance of being able to get air passages without any particular priority. If you consider that they are deserving of special treatment then I suggest that an attempt be made to obtain a 'B' priority for them as far as Cairo.

Suresh Hanjan Khastglr joined the Engineering College, Benares Hindu University in the session 1927-28 as a Diploma Student. He passed the first year Diploma Examination successfully and stood fourth in order of merit. In the session 1928—29 he got himself transferred to the Degree Course of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. He attended the Mechanical Drawing classes for three sessions. In the first year Diploma and also in the ilvsz year Degree class he received training in Practical Solid Geometry and Machine Drawing of simple kind which he completed very satisfactorily and secured 77% marks (average marks) for his sessional Drawings and hand-sketches. I found Mr. Khastgir a very intelligent and diligent student in the class, and was one of our best students during that session. Throughout his second year career, in the Mechanical Drawing class I always found him a very earnest, painstaking and hardworking student who always tried to make bis drawings and sketches complete and as perfect as possible and that he never hesitated to cancel his nearly finished drawing and start a new one, if necessary, in oraer to improve the design and draughtsmanship. I always admired him for his painstaking nature He improved very much at the end of the Second Year Drawing Session and secured 84% marks (average marks) for his second year sessional drawings in Mechanical Engineering.I can recommend Mr, Khastgir as a very neat and accurate draughtsman, capable of making working drawing for worksho P and 1 am confident that the workman will not find any difficulty in making the object from his drawing. As a man I know Mr, Khastgir bears a very high character, possessing a cheerful disposition and always ready to oblige his comrades and chiefs. His behaviour towards his teachers and fellow students within the class and outside was excellent, I shall be glad to hear of his success in life. SD/~ A. T.

T ' oth December 1944* My dear Belgrave, As a result of conversetlon^^Tth Leigh and Miss Ellson Sir Geoffrey understood that they had been much inconvenienced by being told by the India Office that they could obtain everything here whereas in fact they huve been able to buy very little indeed* He therefore cc&gt;en a riic ted with the India Office whose reply Is to tba effect that the s atotients are totally • xifoundod. Che nurses were not interviewed at the India Office whose advice to the Overseas Murslag Association was that the nurses should take everything with them. As regards Leigh they say that they spent their time impressing or? him the desirability of taking things fr England. I shall be grateful to kno T ^ whether the persons con cerned have any comments or explanations to offer. ,J(r ours sincerely, C. P&amp;lrymple Belgravs, Ksq., Adviser to the Bahrain Gov .rrmaent, Bahrain.GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. D.O.No.&lt;?y-/o A / / Bahrain, January 3, 1945. With reference to your D.O.No.c/1773 dated 16th December 1944, there appears to have been some mis understanding about who gavd inforamtion about Bahrain to Miss Ellson prior to her coming out here. She was interviewed by an official at India House, not at the India Office but I think when speaking to Sir Geoffrey she referred to the India Office by mistake. Leigh says that he met Sir Geoffrey a day or two after he arrived here and at that time he knew nothing whatever about conditions here so he did not discuss the question of whether he had been advised to bring anything with him from home, but he did talk about the delay in Cairo which was caused by his not having been warned to obtain visas for the journey on from Egypt to Bahrain. ^ Major T.

No.15 (below) t that prices of many commodities had fallen after V.J.Daf/ but I do not know whether these commodities are article^ in general consumption and fall has not been felt to date by public. Messrs. Wakelin, Willey, and British Police form precedent for asking for Naafi facilities, but it seems rather late to do so, and from seeing Group Capt. Leigh at Naafi I had gathered he was using Naafi facil ities, probably indirectly. Questions under the agreement should be referred to P.R. ~ 11/9/45. ♦ . • i t+sj/l lx Untu (uSl* ]) ^T' 4 —* ^</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003c5_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/230</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003c5</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/230</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 6/6 W B Steele - State Engineer; (2) Group Captain H P G Leigh State Engineer'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1931/1945</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-05-19T22:02:10</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (179 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 181; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
