To - H.E.Siiaikli Ahmad al-Jabir as-Subah, C.S.I. ,C.I.E. Ruler of Kuwait. No. 678. Dated 4th December 1929. After compliments etc. I have the honour to inform Your EEeifcllency that in accordance with orders passed by H.M’s Secretary of State for Colonies a conference was held at Basrah at 12 noon on 5rd December 1929 between the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and myself, to devise what steps could be taken to prevent any large Bedouin camps being near the Southern frontier of Kuwait, or any large numbers of camels which might give rise A. to reports that certain of the Akhwan had taken refuge in Kuwait territory or were again attempting to water their camels at Subahiyeh, Tawil or Jahrah wells. At the conference the following arrangements were decided upon as being tho* least likely to interfere with the arrangements already existing in Your Excellency’s territories. 1. that the Kuwait Bedouin tribes should not graze south of a straight line stretching from Um Russ - Um Amarat Mahzul to al-Batin, but that they should be entirely free to move everywhere they ehose to the North of this line. 2. That in the southern area of Kuwait territory, that is to say in the area south of a line drawn from the town of Kuwait to where the Kuwait boundary crosses -the Shaqq (a few miles west of Manaqish), shepheards, wood cutters, grass cutters and all persons connected with bringing of supplies and necessaries for the daily life of the people of Kuwait, should be allowed to continue- 2 - their occupations as before and not be interfered with in any way. It was not considered practicable pr $pssible to clear this area on which the economic life of Kuwait town so largely depends. That as regards the Awazim who are now camped round about. Wafra. These may continue to draw supplies from Kuwait and Sabil to the town as they have been doing up to date, but should they elect later to enter Kuwait territory with their families and their camels, they should be ordered by Your Excellency to proceed north of Jahrah and not graze their camels or move south of the line mentioned in paragraph 1. above. 4. That for the next flew days and till it was certain there was no immediate prospect of Bin Baud’s forces attacking the Akhwan, a few armoured cars would be station ed at Jahrah. 5. That on the 5th Mevembeir, the Political Agent Kuwait would visit the point where the Kuwait frontier crosses the Shaqq in the South, accompanied by the armoured cars. 6. That from time to time aeroplane reconnaissances would examine the southern frontier line' of Kuwait territory, but information of their coming would always be conveyed to Your Excellency and Your Excellency’s approval taken before hand. As regards the measures proposed in paragraphs 1., 2., and 3., above, I have been instructed to convey these to Your Excellency without delay, and to express the Hon’ble the Political Resident hopes that Your Excel lency Yfill agree to them. He has further asked me by telegram today to express his great regret if any incon venience is caused to Your Excellency or to Your Excellen cy’s subjects by the carrying of such measures, but he has every hope that the necessity for them ?/ill be of very short duration. In conclusion I append copies ibfl Arabic of a telegram sent to the Secretary of State by the Hon’ble the5-3 © * Political Resident in the Persian Sulf yesterday, and one from the Hon’hie the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf to me, which will enable Your Excellency to understand the situation fully.

Political Beaident, “Patrick StQwart“ Fo-reign and Politidal Dept., New Delhi Dated the 8th December 1929 # My telegram No.1205 of 28th NovemDer. I offer following comments on Colonial Office letter. In view of moral responsibility recognised as resting upon His Majesty’s Government I trust it will he possible to press Koweit claims and method proposed would seem suitable. Customs Duties. This is chief bone of contention and in view of fact that as far as I am aware Bin Saud has not established customs posts on frontier of ’Iraq, Qatar or Trucial coast ports it is clear that he is subjecting Koweit to differential treatment which is difficult to explain except on ground of personal animus. Position at Koweit differifrom Bahrein. There goods in transit are consigned to Nejd^do not break bulk^and have to be exported within 20 days. At Koweit all goods are consigned to Koweit merchants who take delivery and subse quently sell to caravans from the interior. Koweit customs duty is only 4$: as Najd customs duty would presumably not be less proposals in para 5 would not seem to be feasible. I personally can-not see why solution proposed by Sheikh should not operate satisfactorily. In summer there would be no possibility of evasion since caravans must water daily. In winter a caravan leaving beaten track would probably encounter serious difficulties but Sheikh would nai certainly agree to any reasonable extension of posts on frontier, andand manifest system proposed lay him would seem to provide still further against possibility of e¥asion. Finally I would emphasise that caravans taking goods to Nejd are not tribal caravans but camels and goods belong to Nejdi merchants. Bin Saud therefore can inflict severe punishment on offenders. Question of caravans really presents no difficulties but Bin Baud’s real object is, I think, to prevent Bedoii in tribes having access to Koweit for their ordinary supplies, which of course is different question. ?ost copy to the Political Agent, Kuwait.

To Sir, The Hon’ble the Political Resident ‘in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to report that Shaikh Hafith Wahba in a letter dated 7th December 1929 reported that he had heard a rumour that the following rebel minor leaders Ibn Mashur (Anaze) Khalid al-Mohomed (Zab Sahman) j Ajman ) Mohomed al-Uthain ) intended making an attempt to enter ’Iraq v/ith their families, and requested that I should inform the ’Iraq authorities accordingly. 2. The same story reached me on the 7th December when I was out reconnoitering the Southern border near Manaquish with the armoured cars, and emanated from an Ajman shepherd who happened to know Salim al- Mahyus, the Shaikh’s principal Rashidi scout and messenger who accompanied me. 3. On further enquiry I find that the man Salim al- Mahyus also reported the story to Shaikh Hafidth Wahba, so the originator of the tale is the same person, a shepherd • 4. I personally think the information to be unreliabl. and an invention as all reports place the three persons referred to with the rebels, the first being with al- Duwish and the other two with Ibn Hithlain.

Aviation.CORETDENTIA Political Agency, Kuwait, No, 653, Dated the 9th December 19 From Lieutenant-Colonel H,R.P.Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, Kuwait, To The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, Shaikh of Kuwait’s point of view vis-a-vis H.M.King Bin Baud, and his fears of a coming attack on his territories by the latter. Sir, I have the hono&amp;r to refer you to Jeddah’s telegram No. 172 dated 25th November 1929 to the Foreign Office, which was repeated to Bushire and Kuwait under his No, 226 of the same date. You will doubtless have observed that H.M’s Representative suggests that H.M.King Bin Saud intends making an attack on Kuwait at no distant date to revenge himself for the Shaikh’s so called perfidy,and that the force which H.M.King Bin Saud may try and place near the Kuwait frontier to intercept rebels attempting to enter ’Iraq or Kuwait, may itself suddenly decide to chastise Kuwait. 2. Without entering into the question as to whether such contingency is possible or when it is likely to happen, I think it my duty to report that by a coinci dence, the rebel leader Shaikh Faisal al Duwish suggested the probability of the very same tiling happening,^as soon as he submitted^)-in his verbal message of 24th November to His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad (see my telegram No, 644 dated 25th November 1929), also His Excellency himself paid me a special call on 28th November last to warn me that such coming attack was a certainty. He went further and urged me with great emphasis to warn H.M’s Government through you of H.M.King Bin Baud’s ecming intention and- 2 - ' * ^ tendered the following advice as to how to x^event « King Bin Saud carrying out his plan* (See also my telegram % Ho.672 of 50th November 1929)* This was to the effect that on the first hostile act(such as a raid etc) being committed against Kuwait territory, even though H.M.King Bin Saud immediately denied knowledge or even disowned the tribe that raided, H.M’s Government should at once present H.M.King Bin Saud with an ultimatum. By this method and this method only,said the Shaikh,would H.M. King Bin Saud hold his hand* Should H.M’s Government not act in this manner he the Shaikh of Kuwait prophesied a repetition of the incidents of the last few years against f Iraq only this time it would be his territory that would suffer* 3. The Shaikh spoke with great emotion as he told me all this, and appeared deeply dejected at the situation generally He again and again emphasized that he had done his best to treat the rebels strictly according to the orders given him by H.M's Government, and that in spite of the fact that both the Mutair and Ajman were once Kuwait tribes, and were related by the closest blood ties to his house, he had steadfastly refused to give them supplies and assistance, or afford them the obvious facilities of his port. In so doing jtfhe had incurred the odium of his own subjects to a degree he had never experienced before. 4. The Shaikh went on to say that apart from H.M. King Bin Saud’s many acts of perfidy and ingratitude towards Shaikh Mubarak in the later years of that Huler’s life and taking only period of his own reign, H.M. King Bin Saud for the last 7 years had imposed his cruel strangle-hold on Kuwait and had shown his unforgiving enmity by every form of hostile act short of open war. 'This 7 years blockage alon§ had reduced Kuwait f s customs revenue from 7 lacs to and had all but ruinod his people. All this H.M.Kin ; Bin Saud had done and more through a personal dislike of his house and to satisfyhis sworn ambition, oft stated, of never resting till he had planted his standard over the Kuwait customs building and made his, the Shaikh of Kuwait’s small kingdom, an appanage of Nejd. 5* His opportunity, continued Shaikh Ahmad, to throw off H.M.King Bin Baud’s throat-grip, and free Kuwait, and his people had six months ago presented itself when Faisal al Dipwish left Artav/iyeh for Hassa to lead the present rebellion. Al Duwish then invited him offi cially by letter and influential mission to throw in his lot with the rebels, and lead them himself, (reported at the tirae by me), but he had preferred to obey H.M’s Government’s commands and trust her counsels rather than follow those of his own advisers, or the dictates of his own conscience. This refusal to take the advice of his own people to study his own interests and not those of H.M’s Goverment, was now about to lead him into still greater trouble and perhaps disaster, unless H.M’s Govern ment came to his assistance. 6. He solemnly warned H.M’s Government that no state bordering on Nejd would know peace till H.M.Bin Baud the 'bully” and ’’tyrant” of Arabia was overthrown, he now asked H.M’s Government to carry out her treaty engagements with him, and see that Kuwait came to no harm, and by this he said he did not merely mean the protection of Kuwait town, but the whole area of his State. In fairness, he said, this was due to him since it was H.M’s Government alone who had tied his hands, and forced him to adopt a neutral attitude in the present struggle between al-Duwish and II.M.Bin Baud. 7. The Shaikh asked H.M’s Government to picture what would have happened had he placed all the resources of Kuwait at the rebels’ disposal from the start. He ventured to think that by now H.M.King Bin Baud would have been ?/ithout a kingdom and a refugee, for it was the fighting material of Nejd that had revolted and nothing-4- could Ixave prevented success if supplies and munition had flown in regularly. That the reverse had happened, and that H.M.Bin Baud had been able to bring about the Ataiba tribes’ collapse, and was on the high road to bring about the early submission of the Hassa insurgents under al-Du- wish was entirely due to the action of H.M’s Government. The closing of Kuwait’s port and landward gates feaving been the immediate means of bringing about such a result. 8» The least H.M’s Government could now do in re turn, continued the Shaikh, was to force H.M.Bin Baud to to behave properly to himself and/his people, and for all time to cease from his intrigues and bullying tactics, and above all to ccmpel him to remove once and for all the blockade he had imposed on Kuwait for the last 7 years. 9. He, the Shaikh of Kuwait, could not understand how H.M’s Government had apparently changed her methods in the last few years. In the olden days H.M’s Govern ment was renouned among Arab people for supporting the weak against the strong. Today they appeared to take the line of least resistance, and the one most convenient and to support the strong as a matter of set policy. What had Kuwait done to deserve H.M.King Bin Baud’s treatment of her, or deserve the 7 years ruination,which ^ d c H.M’s Government could have stopped anytime had she pleasec 10. Perhaps H.M’s Government did not quite realize, added the Shaikh, that the insurgent Ajman and Mutair who today were fighting to free themselves from H.M. Bin Sand’s thraldom were the very forces employed by H.M.Bin Baud to blockade Kuwait for so long. Did H.M’s Govern ment know that the crime of these people today was that they had enough of H.M.Bin Baud’s crooked and treacherous dealings and merely desired to return to their ancient fealty and once more be under the Ruler of Kuwait? Did H.M’s Government know that they had been weaned away by money and the threat of an overwhelming attack by the NejdAkhwan, when H.M.Bin Saud first started that movement and when he was at the pinacle of his religious power and influence? As fear and cupidity had led them to Nejd, . now disgust and contempt for their erstwhile Imam had fired their desire to caae hack to Kuwait. 11. H.M.Bin Saud had 'bluffed” K.M f s G-overnment, said the Shaikh, into allowing him to have things 'both ways'. For just as when H.M.Bin Saud’s forces were block ading Kuwait and ruining her, no help was afforded by H.M’s Government, today when the blockading army, having expressed its dislike of H.M.Bin Baud’s policy desired to open trade between Kuwait and themselves, as well as the interior; at the instance of H.M.Bin Saud, he the Shaikh of Kuwait was ordered by H.M’s Government to blockade himself, and continue the ruination process, by closing his port and frontiers to his old subjects, the so called rebels. d The situation wou;d be ludicrous, were it not so sad, said the Shaikh. 12. H.M’s Government had recently suggested that all Kuwait’s claims against H.M.Bin Saud both as regards subjects killed, and property looted, should be examined by a commission, and a bill presented to H.M.Bin Saud. Did H.MSs Government, asked the Shaikh, intend to include in the bill the Rs 42 lacs,* comprising the approximate loss of trade done to Kuwait during the past 7 years? He ventured to think this would be no unfair claim to make. 13. Though much more on the above lines was told me, I do not propose to attempt' to continue further the Shaikh’s summary of his point of view, especially as he himself explained his case at length to you on your recent visit to Kuwait on 5th December 1929J I have reported enough I think to give a picture of the worried state of the Shaikh’s mind today. 14. The Shaikh undoubtedly believes that H.M’s Government■6 Government has not accorded him the support they might / have done during the period of his reign, both at the time of the Ojair Conference of 192S ^hen the former Kuwait boundary {Turkish) was altered and thrown back by Sir Percy Cox to the general detriment of himself and his State, he not being present to fight his bat tles while his rival was; and during the 7 years of blockade which followed, which latter he says, befell, because he did not agree to His Majesty Bin Sa’ud plac ing an official to collect his Customs in the heart of Kuwait itself, and so make Kuwait a vassal State of H.M. Bin Sa f ud in the eyes of the Arab world, 15, That Bin Sa f ud f s vindictiveness is a purely personal one, the Sheikh, I think, has pretty well proved, \tien it is realized, as he himself points out, that H.M* Bin Sa’ud possesses no customs posts against •Iraq, Qatar or the Trucial Coast ports, all of which A sen^ trade into Hejd nor has ever suggested such. As / he said himself, why was Kuwait singled out for a cus toms policy? Why not Zubair, Nasiriyah, Samawah, Hejef not to mention Dohah in Qatar ? 16, Though the above report was drafted two days before your recent visit to Kuwait end the Sheikh him self has told you a good deal of ?;hich I have written, I am submitting it in final form, as I think you ought to know exactly ho?; His Sxcelleney the Sheikh feels about things in general at the present time. That he has got it into his head that in the contest between himself and H.M, the King of Hejd, His I.Iajesty's Govern ment has and is taking the side of the strong, is I 6m afraid too true. Though I daily endeavour to preach the ridiculousness of this view, nothing will shake him in his belief, and he quotes as irrefutable evidence of the correctness of his view, the fact that both he and his people to-day are looked upon by His Majesty’s Government with the greatest suspicion because they are-7 not ashamed to avow that their sympathies are entirely wtoh the rebels at the present time. The continual flying over his territory by the Royal Air Force and their so-called 'protective tactics' by armoured car end other form of reconnaissance ; at the present time is also instanced as a proof of this view. These movements are not done, he' says, to protect him from H,M * Bln Sa'nd, from whom there is no danger so long as the rebels are in the field, but to prevent him aot his people having communication with the rebels or sup plying them with foodstuffs, which it is obvious, he is believed to be doing in spite of all his assurances, and all the pains he has taken to fall in with His Majesty*s Croveminent’s wishes.

Reference your second query as you are aware Bedouins and sheep tribes not con nected with immediate economic life of Kuwait were to go north of this line and no restriction was placed on their grazing any where, nor does Shaikh with whom I have discussed Howes T report, air report and your telegram propose defining any special areas for them# It is quite impossible therefore to say where Shaikh’s tribes actually are at moment’s notice, especially as they continually changing ground.

Dated 4th December 1929. After compliments etc., I have the honour to infom your Excellency that in accordance xri 1 h orders passed by His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Colonies a Conference was held at Basrah at 18 Noon on 3rd. December 1989 between the Air Officer Commanding, ’Iraq, the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and myself, to devise what steps could be taken to prevent any large Bedouin camps being formed near the Southern frontier of Kuwait, or any large numbers of camels collecting near the boundary, which might give rise to reports that oer- tain of the Akhwan had taken refuge in Kuwait territory or v?ere again attempting to water their camels at Subaihiyaii, Tawil or Tahrah ?;ells. At the Conference the following arrangements were de cided upon as being the least likely to interfere with the arrangements already existing in your Sbccellenoy 1 s terri tories;- 1 . That the Kuwait Bedouin tribes should not graze south of a straight line stretching from Umm Russ - Umm ’-onarat Mahzul to Al-3atin, but they should be entirely free to move everywhere they chose to the North of this line. 8 . Tljat in the southern area of Kuwait territory, that is to say in the area south of a line drawn from the tom of Kuwait to v/here the Kuwait boundary crosses the Shaqq ( a few miles west of Manaqish), shepherds, woodcutters, grass- cutters and all persons connected with bringing of suppliesand nooessaries for the daily life of the people of ' Kuwait, should be allowed to continue their occupations as before and not be interfered with in arjy way. It was not considered practicable or possible to clear this area on which the economic life of Kuwait town so largely depends, 3, That as regards the ’Awazim who are now camped round about Wafra, These may continue to draw supplies from Kuwait and tt 5abil w to the town as they have been doing up to date, but should they elect later to enter Kuwait territory with their families and their camels, they should be ordered by your Excellency to proceed nepfc north of Jahrah and not graze their camels or move south of the line mentioned in paragraph 1 above, 4, That for the next few days and till it was cer tain there was no immediate prospect of Bin Sa’ud’s forces attacking the Akhwan, a few armoured cars would be station ed at Jahrah. 5, That on the 5th Dec (saber, the Political Agent, Kuwait Kuwait would visit the point where the/frontier crosses the Shaqq in the South, accompanied by the armoured oars. 6 , That from time to time aeroplane reconnaissances would examine the southern frontier line of Kuwait terri- % tory, but information of their coming would always be con veyed to your Kxcellaicy and your Excellency’s approval taken beforehand. As regards the measures proposed in paragraphs 1 , 2 and 3 above, I have been instructed to convey these to your Excellency without delay, and to express the Hon’ble the Political Resident hopes that your Excellency will agree to them. He has further asked me by telegram to-day to ex- press his great regret if any inconvenience is caused to your excellency or to your Excellency’s subjects by the carrying of such measures, but he has every hope that the necessity for them will be of very short duration.In conclusion I append copies e# Arabic of a telegram sent to the Secretary of State by the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf yesterday, and one from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to me, which will enable your Bxoellenoy to understand the situa tion fully.THAN SUIT ION of a LEYxm.

We understand Kuwait frontier zone which is being cleared depth extends for about 15 miles along whole length direction Kuwait - Nejd frontier to Neutral zone. Please confirm this, and report by telegraph when evacuation has been completed. As regards remainder of frontier zone realize impractibility complete evacuation any area on which economic life Kuwait depends, but you will have seen from Foreign Office telegram 134 to Jeddah November 30th that Bln Saud has been informed definitely and categorically that instruct ions have been given for removal of all Kuwait sheep tribes from the vicinity frontier. Fact that frontier area east of north west corner neutral zone( approximately half total frontier and including important well of Subaiyeh ) has not been cleared is thus inconsistant with formal assurance which has been given and to which it is essential for sake of our good mame to adhere to if possible. Otherwise effect may be embarrasing on our relations with Bin Saud. If it is quite impossible impliment assurance, a further explanation will have to be sent to Bin Saud with out delay, in hope forestalling possible accusation from him of bad faith on the part of which it would in the circumstances be hard to counter.2 . Please therefore telegraph immediately full particulars in un - cleared area, and especially whether Isolated shep herds and wood-cutters only or entire population have been allowed remain in it. If latter, every effort should be made partially to impli cate assurance given Bin Saud by removal of all elements not essential to economic life Kuwait to distance of at least 10 miles from frontier? As regards Awazim, no further communication will he addressed Bin Saud until reply of Awazim to ultimatum reported in your telegram of December 8 th is known; but the situation is delicate and an ^ devei °P®ent should be immediately reported by tdegram. It is important moreover that there should be no misunder standing as to question of allegiance of Awazim. His Majestys Government have hitherto only approved grant to them by Sheikh of tempory shelter, ( see my telegram November 1st, repeated Baghdad as 340 ) If Sheikh shows any disposition to regard present admission of Awazim as constituting the permanent transfer to him of their allegiance, ( see your telegram 54 of October 31st.) further consideration will be necessary , Foreign Office are doubtfull whether legitimately and expedient of such transfer of allegiance in present circumstances. Please ascertain and report what is situation. You should make sure in the meantime that nothing is done prejudicial. Repeated Baghdad 395 Kuwait and Jeddah 142. SECER.Telegram (G.)

Biscoe, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Budiire, The 16th Rajab t548 (18th December 1929}• We have received your Excellency’s letter No. 1604 dated the 3rd. Rajab, 1348 (5th December 1929} including the British Government’s reply to our letter dated the 15th Jamad-II. We tank the British Government for its having con ceded our demand, and express our confidence in the British Government’s intentions, and its keeping its promise with us. We never intended to cast doubt, in our previous letters on the efforts or actions of the British, officers, nor on the British Government’s inten tions, but we made a point of mentioning and still do mention with thanks and praise the assistance which tte British Government showed in selling to us firearms and aeroplanes. The one thing that we complained of and which took place was the not forbidding the rebels from taking their supplies from Kuwait or entering into it without hindrance, and their camping on the watering r places^ so many days long without any steps being taken to prevent them, vtihich was well known to all, and not a secret matter but exposed and seen by everybody in Kuwait. The British Political Agent at Jeddah had in fact already acknowledged that there v/as some 'Musabalah” (going and coming). As regards the promises which tiie rebels received and the encouragements which they had, from the throne of Baghdad, we believe that if the British Government make a deep investigation, it will come to know of the truth of what we related to it. For the present we see no use'in discussing too much this matter, but the important thing is to help each other and bring these c ire urns tance scircumstances to an end in a reasonable way. We thank the British Government for its orders that the rebels should be forbidden and turned out from the Kuwait territories, and for taking the necessary prededures on the frontiers of ’Iraq and Transjordania, which if thoroughly carried out there, will render it unnecessary for our forces to enter into the territories of these neighbouring countries. Further in accordance with the suggestion of the British Government we have sent other letters with this by four motor cars to Kuwait to infom the Amir of Kuwait and the British Political Agent there that we are now camped at al-Lusafa. We had heard that ad-Dawish^ was camping on it, but found that he fled from it on hearing of our coming texag and we have sent trackers to follow him and when we have ascertained his whereabouts, we shall attack him by the power of God and His strength. We wish all the British forces to be aware of this on the frontiers so that they may fulfil the British Government’s promise in preventing the rebels, ad-Dawish and his followers and the ’Ajmsn (ibn Hithlain and his followers) from fleeing for refuge or escaping. In case of occurrence of anjfc fresh news here, we shall inform the nearest military station on the frontiers of what will be required as soon as possible. We think it important also to draw the attention of the British Government to the orders and arrangements men tioned in paragraph 2 of your Excellency’s letter which read as follo?/s:- ” (2) Orders have been issued for all ’’the tribes of Kuwait and the ’Awazim refugees to move from 'the boundaries etc., etc.,'. We have no info mat ion that any of the ’Awazim fled for refuge even to the Kuwait boundaries, and it is quite impossible that w-e should ever allow ary of our subjects to seek shelter, especially at the present moment in any of the countries bordering on us. we protested against this question formerly, and now we re questtruest that the G-overnnieiit should issue orders forbidding any of our subjects from taking refuge at the present time, because such could result in nothing but trickery and deceit. We, hov^rever, have confidence that the British y Government will redouble its orders which are so necessary and take the strictest steps to prevent the rebels from taking any refuge in, and from receiving any assistance from the neighbouring countries. Usual Ending. /TRANSLATION of a LETTER Prom - H, M., King Ibn Sa^d, , To - H.E*, Mr* Dickson, Political Agent, Kuwait, Dated the 16th Rajah 1548 (18th December 1929}* You will find enclosed herewith a letter to His Excel lency the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf which please send to him as soon as possible. In accordance with the suggestion of the British s Government that we should infom the neighbouring authoritie of our military movements we send these letters by means of four motor cars of ours to Kuwait for the information of our brother Sheikh Ahmed and your Excellency to tell you that we are at present camped at Al-Lusafah (Safa), because we heard that ad-Dawish was also comping there, but v/e found that he had fled and we have accordingly sent men to track him. When we find out his whereabouts we shall, please God, do what may be necessary to bring about a decision and destroy him by attack. Ad- Dawish has already written to us asking for pardon and security, and we have given him the promise of his life and have demanded from him the return of all the plunder d which he has to date taken fi'ora everyone, but he has refuse this offer. We, therefore have decided to ask the help of God against him. We have further come to know that a person named ’Ali abu Shuwairibat arrived at ad-Dawish’s camp and alleged that he was sent by King Faisal from Baghdad to !r»vit invite ad-Dawish to enter into the territories of ^raq, this news is also borne out by a statement we have seen in ad-Dawish T s letter and also by the statement of the person who visited us from him, namely Sultan ibn Muhailib.

To The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the P-ersian Gulf, Rushire \ Sir \ In continuation of my No* 7IS dated 18th December 1929, I have the honour to forward you a translation of a statement made by the surrendered rebel leader Sultan A al Muhailib (Braih, Mutair) to H.11.King Bin Saud on his submission (about 9th December 1929). 2. This statement was actually taken down in Bin Sand’s presence, and the original has been sent me by the King through Shaikh Hafiz Salih a, along with al-Duwish’s letters forwarded under my Ho. 720 of date. \ 3. Paragraph 2 of the statement is particularly in teresting from my point of view as immediately after the Jahrah incident if you recollect al-Duwish sent me a verbal message by Hillal al Mutairi that he was d* finitely leaving for Haffar having found out he had no friends, he further gave his word to this effect. I accordingly informed you and H.E. the High Commissioner for ’Iraq, Baghdad, of this in my telegrams No. 623 dated 12th No vember 1929 and my Nos. 638 &amp; 639 dated 22nd and 23rd November 1929. After a period of 10 days or so, I sud denly found Duwish had returned to Hamatiyat on the Kuwait border, and could not make out why he had changed his mind about Hafar etc. The present story of Ali al- Shuwairibat gives us the much needed explanation, I think. I have the honour to be, 8ir, Your most obedient servant Political Agent, KuwaitCopy of Statement mad© to Bin Baud by Bultan ibn Muhailib (Uutair Chieftain) who was sent by al-Duwish ?/ith letters to this idng and who at the same time submitted to the latter* (fh© above statement was sent to the Political Agent, Kuwait by Bin .,aud for information). 'With regard to al-Duwish f s future movements, he is a man who is 'going', and who has no intention whatso ever of submitting to you, unless you 0 oliaikh make a reasonable demand from him of such things as horses, riding camels and milch camels* Should you do this he will submit* You should know that people hair© frightened him properly, and tell him continually that Bin Baud overcame the Ataiba and left no remnants or survivors, and that h® has no hop© ©except in ©scape* These are the xfords of all in the Akhwan councils* £♦ I Sultan, myself think that King Faisal (A1 Sharecf) has invited al-Duwish (to ’Iraq), for at the time when Abdullah ai-Bubah came to Jahrah and told him that the Consul (Colonel Dickson) had ordered him to remove himself from Jahrah, under pain of arrest, and when he al-Duwish obeyed the order and left and was o$ly two marches away All al-Bhuwaribat com© to his comp with a letter freta the i Shareef (King Faisal), which, it is said invited him (and his people) to com© over to him. I cannot actually say myself wksdfckio: what were the contents of th® letter. 3. With regard al-Duwish, he is innocent of all intrigues, but he is an 'afraid' man, and dare not come and throw himself on your mercy, except you send him a letter of 'safe conduct' or th© Bhailch (th© Chief Alim of Nejd) does this. My advice is, 'Give out, what actual!/ you require of al-Duwish', 0 Bin Baud,' and 1st the man trust you, for his entrails-ar© torn out with fear'. 4* As regards those who have decided to com© over from al-Duwish and join you, the following ar© their names:- (a) I Sultan first with my people the Albji Samkh. (b) Al-Fuqm and his brother. (c) Majid al-Asga with a party. (d) Ibn vVatban and narty* (©)* (®) Mohamed bin iiajid (alone)# 5.

After Compliments, i Your letter has been received, and that which you v/rote has been understood in every detail, but up till now we are not satisfied with the terms offered by you and we expect O’ Abu Turki, something more thm Trtiat you have mentioned to us, Sultan ibn Muhailib is coming to see you, and G-od willing we want you to offer us peace (Amn) without looking into the past {i.e 0 , forgive us and forget). The rest of your reply will be communicated by him personally and will be more clearly understood by you. Usual Ending and SalaamsFrom - Faisal ibn Sultan ad-Dawish, To * ’Abdul *Aziz bin ’Abdur Rahman al-Faisal, Bated the 6th Rajab (?) 1548 (8th December 1929). After Compliments, The letter has been received axil we have understood its contents. As to your statement that our ' ! bolt hole” has been stopped for us, by God if we had desired to find a ’’bolt hole” besides that of Islam, verily every door would have been opened to us, as it was openod to others of your own people (Shxnmar etc.) but 0,’ ’Abdul ’Aziz 2 fear God in dealing with Moslems, do not force them, to be unfaithful after they have tasted the flavour of the true ”Din” of Islam. We desire first from God and then from you, 0 2 Abu Turk! 2 to bury and forget whatever has taken place between us and the people of Nejd; as well as shedding of blood and the plunder of property, because the greater sin in this respect rests with you not us. We ask God to guide you, and put out the flames of this trouble amongst us, save us Muslims from internal strife, using you as His instrument. You have stated that we had an object in our previous letter but we had no object at all, except the desire of getting closer to the true Islam and Muslims. I aslc God to set aright the affairs of Islam and us Muslims. Usual Binding.Translation of a supplement to ad-Duwish’s letters dated 8th December 1929. At present it appears that you write in your letter to that all ways are stopped up in our faces, that we have no escape, and that we have of necessity to submit to you, but God save you, the reverse is the case by the power of God and his strength, and were it i not for your personality and friendship which are dear to us, we could obtain anything we wepat. Be it known to you that everyone invites us and we can proceed in any direction and nothing stands in our way except as I xstoxtoH mentioned above your valuable friendship. We do not like the ways of infidelity. Be assured of this and fix it in your mind, and do not have any doubt that were it not for my hatred of the infidels and my anxiety never to be under their control, I would not have sent you any messenger. To be under infidel control is hateful to me and I speak only the truth. Your letter which I received signifies that you still doubt me and my messengers, you know that I am a plain man who holds not by deceit or fraud. For the sake of God do not force us to return to infidelity, (by joining the khafirs). God is our requital and He is the best that can be trusted etc.Telegram (C.)

From Lieutenant-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.K., Political Agent, Kuwait. To The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, In continuation of my telegram No. 731 dated 271h December 1929, I have the honour to report that I received a visit from Shaikh Hillal al Mutairi, the aged millionaire merchant of Kuwait and relative of Duwish. On the excuse of coming to offer me Xmas greetings h© informed me that he had heard from al-Duwish that a reply had been received from Bin Saud by him to his various letters stipulating that before he would listen to any talk of surrender, ho al-Duwish should give the following two undertakings to him Bin Saud:-^ (a) To sjStyr® by oath of God to obey all his orders to the letter in future. (b) To proraise never again to allow any of his people to visit Kuwait for the purpose of purchasing previsions or hold any further communication with Kuwait. Shaikh Hillal, who I have found very trustworthy in the past, stated the above as a fact, I report it for what it is worth. I am inclined to believe the story. 2. Shaikh Hillal then went on to blame His Majesty’s Government for not understanding the real nature of the Kuwait-Nejd dispute, and censured me for not having properly shown up the 'villain of the Piece' Bin Saud in his real and true colours to His Majesty’s Governmento 'Cannot your Government see', he said, 'that if they allow the Ajman and Mutair to settle peaceably in Kuwait and return to their old allegiance now, the days of peace and prosperity will once more settle down on Kuwait, and we shall never again hear of another raid or attack from Nejd. Bin Saud will certainly make a lot of noise- 2 - \i^ and write myriads of letters, but he will neither dare - nor have it in his power to do Kuwait any further harm. With supplies at their disposal and a port on the sea, the Llutair and Ajman with Shaikh Ahmad behind them, will present an impenetrable obstacle to all Bin Baud’s intrigues and ambitions to make Kuwait a vassal state of his fT . He urged me to present the other side of the picture to His Majesty’s Government before it was too ft '• r, late. The Ajman and Liutair, he said, must submit soon but disaster to all and a long period of bloodshed and misery for the people of Kuwait could be averted, if only His Majesty’s Government would understand Kuwait’s case. The old man was wonderfully eloquent and deeply ernest. And allowing for the fact that he is a Mutairi and re lative of Al-Duwish, I could not help agreeing with much of what h© said. I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant Lisut-Colonel Political Agent, Kuwait.■D.0. NO * 685-S. The Residency, Bushire, 27th Decemher 1929.

You can assure the Shaikh in course of conversation that I am fully alive to his difficulties that I have already brought them to the notice of His Majesty's Government and as a matter of fact 1 have already consulted the Air Officer Commanding as to the measures which we should take.

After a few common place politenesses the shaikh excitedly broke &amp;ut into a tirade against i is ajesty’s Government saying that they did nothing but order him to carry out every fam of measure detrimental to ia own interests and those of his state, and to make matters worse he was never asked his views on any orders so given, but just told to obey like a child* Hurthcrmoro i o Government were in most unfair manner taking advantage of hi® loyalty to tie his hands and prevent him resisting whenever any unfair order was passed. At the same time H. ’s Gwemmont were granting ovory To The Hon*ble Lieutencmt-Colonel H*V,Disco©, iolitiocd Bestdent in the .ersian Gulf, B u s h 1 r eevery request preferred by his rivtil Bln Baud, even * when suoh concerned his own interests and his own peoples To crown all H. *8 (’oveminent had forced a friend ly Awazim who might have boon made most useful defenders of Kuwait and who had expressed a desire to return to thoir allegiance, back into the ene^ny*s camp and had deprived him of his rightful and 1 utair assist ance so oft offered. Just because foresooth Din oaud had declared them to be his tribesmen after stealing them away from Kuwait, having thus rendered him the Jhuikh of Kuwait quite holploss against his powerful 01105 y, and at the bidding of that self same oneroy H.u f s Government left him in the awkward situation of having to beg theta to be responsible for the defence of his Town, tribes, frontiers, end subjects generally, whether from heavy attack or petty raid: 'A nice situ ation for the grandson of ubarak’, ho said. 4^ftor I had calmed the -haikh down some what with several cups of coffee, he returned to the attack, and asked how it was that Mr. ihilby could do things on behalf of Bin Baud, and I was unable to got anything done for him with my Government. Bin Scud, he said, had merely to express the smallest wish to i r. .. hilby the latter got 1. 's Government to comply * 1th sots. 'eithout doubt”, ho said, 'kr. Uiilby was guiding H.l *s Govamment’s policy today where bin Baud was concerned .and guiding it well”. Hie shaikh then stated that he was going to England to lay his case before Ting George in London. f If Shaikh 1 ubarak had be^m alive, he would never have acted as foolishly as I have done”, ho added, 'He would never have refused supplies to the rebels, and would hove opened his port to them from the first, nay he would have led them in person against bin Baud and chastised that upstart for his ingratitude', lot allni ell the orders of .*olitioal gents, he opined, would have prevented lit a grand father £ro?i Yrerking for the /( interests of hie State* His present troubles and de fenceless state wore of course duo to his trying to Before leaving at a rather late hour, shaikh . heuad recovered himself sufficiently to apologia© for haring forgot ton himself acid spoken so openly, but said ho had been compelled to speak out, in order to ease the fires of his mind* The Bhaikli’s outburst contained nothing really now as you will observe, but coupled with the rather interesting* te, of course, is firmly convinced that tho Awaaim raids wore oesmtitted under orders of Bin baud and are merely tho precursors of a big attack,as soon as the rebels arc dealt vd di. In this I do not think he is very far wrong, unless we stop it* ut that he appears to have decided on a policy of not co operating so freely with me as ho used to do, gives cause i.us: thought, for X think it proves that he is getting into tho hands of those undesiroblos in tho town who are for over preaching that tho English are not really friends and will sell his city on the first opportunity if it suits their policy. This new attitude of mlhu is exemplified by shaikh Ahmad*s recent obvious lack of keenness in dealing with t o mjman, whom his chauvinistic advisers are straining every norve to keep on or just inside tho frontier on the plea that they will be uwa.itU salvation when the snook’* comes, and * *s Oovommcnt finds a convenient oxouas to back out of their promises. Of course, X am doing my boat, by almost daily visits, to put heart into the ahaikh, and never cease encouraging him to continue to put his trust in H* 'b Bovemmcnt, and in particular to come and take ny advice whenever some of his so called friends have upset him pi ease « f n Oovorrauent attitude v;hich ho has adopted of late ishim v/lth too xauoh of thoir oynloal and anti-English talk* Charming though the Shaikh io, X fear he is not as strong as he might bo.

H.M.Q-ovt. learn from Political Resident Bush ire that Your Majesty has in a recent letter to him made a further protest to action of H.M.Govt. in regard to Awazim tribe. They cannot but believe this protest is based upon a missapprehension which the following message will remove. In reply to your Majesty's letter of November 17th, in which anxiety was expressed lest Your Majesty's rebel subjects when pressed should escape by mixing with tribes in adjacent countries, and in which request was made that these tribes should be removed from vicinity frontier. His Majesty's representative infomed your Majesty that measures would be taken to this end. Being under the impression that the Awazim had already entered, or were about to enter Kuwait in order to seek sanctuary, H.M.G-ovt. gave instructions that they as well as Kuwait tribes should be ordered to move into interior of Kuwait. Subsequently however H.M.Govt. learnt Awazim had not availed themselves of permission given them to move into Kuwait territory, but remained in neutral area. On the reciept of this information, in order that doubtfull position of Awazim might be cleared up, and assurances given Your Majesty regarding clearing of frontier fully implicated instructions2 . instructions were given tha$ a message should be sent to Awazim to the effect that they must either move at once into interior of Kuwait, or alternatively they would, be treated, as part of contending forces.

Regarding disposal Ibn EASHHUR and his i ' ■ . following: they are not Nejdis but belong to RLJTALIAH tribe from Syria. Undertaking given by His Majesty’s government and T Iraq_ Government to Ibn Sa’ud does not therefore appear to apply to them. Moreover I (bn) M(ashhur) states Ibn Sa’ud has excluded them from offer of terms made to rebels on the ground that he doeskot want ’Iraq &gt; them. I suggest therefore that/Govemment having settled their own account with them should let them return to Syria • Fie as e telegraph whether I may advise ’Iraq Govern ment accordingly. As regards rebel Mutair and Ajman: rebels on Kuwait \ ’Iraq frontier with women and children are now refusing to recross Kejd frontier even under threats of ’Iraq Police cars, Royal Air Force armoured cars and aeroplanes. Mutair fugitives also with women and children may be expected to cross into ’Iraq near RIQAI and adopt same altitude. The situation has therefore arisen of which Bin Sa’ud was warned by British ^Jeddah irjparagraph 5 of his letter of 16th October ana which ton Sa’ud has apparently taken no steps to avert. .in the circumstances it is clearly impossible to bomb or shoot down the rebels and alternatives are (a) as first proposed by ’Iraq Government to expel them to foreign territory e.g., Syria, and (b) to accept their surrender, arrest leaders and disarm and intern remainder, the only, condition being that they are Bon Sa’ud against their will. I have informed ■ not hen fled over totlie Prime Minister that (a) vjould not be acceptable to Mis Majesty’s Government and must be ruled out, (b) accord^with demand 4 and 5 contained in aide-memoire enclosed in Jeddah Despatch Mo. 306 dated 30th Move mb ea? and ’Iraq Government ✓ have not agreed to^this procedure. Since situation admits no delay local Police and Royal Air Force commander have been instructed to take action accordingly. If rebels, surrender *as anticipated leaders will be imprisoned and remainder escorted to JARISIIAN on ’Iraq Kuwait border where adequate i grazing exists. ’Iraq Government can then settle account with rebels who have raided ’Iraq in the past and subsequently negotiate for their ultimate disposal, with £bn Sa’ud.
