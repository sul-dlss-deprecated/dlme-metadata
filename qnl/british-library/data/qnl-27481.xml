The aforesaid persons have no desire but to settle with him in a manner by which he will get his right and no harm will be caused to them. By putting their property in auction at this time, it will be oi harm to all of them. I am sure that you have no desire but to protect the rights, the fact which should be cone in a manner of which no harm will result to both parties but by which he will be able to get his rights and at the same time no harm will result to them. This is what should take place between us ana you ana between the subjects of all of us. I have written to the brothers, Shaikh Hamad and Shaikh ^baullah about the manner which will be satisfactory to all. The property which was put to auction in the name of Ahmad, does not belong soley to him but there are several shares in it which were kept in his hand ana in the hand oi his co-partners. I am surprised how it was put to auction without getting a Shara f or tUrf ruling. I nave written to. the brotners, Shaikh Hamaa ana Shaikh f Abdul. l ah, about the manner in which they were delivered. As regards Shahin, ov/ing to the traae depression ; when the property mortgaged to f Ali is put to auction it will not fetch four out of ten of its price. I hope, therefore, that you will settle the matter between them ana T Ali in a good and satisfactory manner. That part oi the property mortgaged may be valued ana given to him in payment ana that owing to the present state of affairs their case may be consiaered, such as the payment by instalments, as I ao not waht to report to the King except wnat will pleases him about the good treatment of his subjects by you, which we are prepared’ to do for you.

Letters of thanks were exchanged after the visits took place.The Political Agent, Bahrain and the Saudi Emirs also exchanged petitions on behalf of some locals of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia respectively. The petitions were mainly regarding the claims of debts, properties, or stolen boats. Debtors from Saudi Arabia fled to Bahrain, hence the Saudi Emirs wrote to the Political Agent, Bahrain, requesting for those who fled to be seized. The Political Agent in turn replied with the available information about the named subjects at his end. The same procedure was done with the Bahraini debtors who fled to Saudi Arabia. The file also includes some letters from merchants such as Abdulaziz al-Qusaibi, informing the Political Agent about their intentions to travel to Qatif to visit a certain notable, to recover some debts, or for trade purposes.Most of the correspondence in the file is in Arabic.
