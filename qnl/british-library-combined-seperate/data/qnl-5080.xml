Each case has its own header page, but there is no index sheet for the cases at the front of the file. The cases are arranged in chronological order, from the earliest occuring case at the beginning of the file, to the latest at the rear. Within each case, correspondence and other papers are arranged in similar chronological order. Office notes relating to each case can be found after the case correspondence. Any numbered items in the office notes refer to the internal numbering systems used within each case.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 301; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio. Additional foliation sequences are also present in parallel in several sections of the file; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled. The sequence includes two foliation anomalies: f 207A and f 224A.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file is comprised of twenty-four manumission application cases numbered 58 to 80, and is a continuation of the Bahrain Agency file 'File A/11 IV Slave cases Trucial Coast' (IOR/R/15/2/1853). The file contains a total of ninety-three individual manumission applications, made to the Residency Agent at Sharjah ('Abd al-Razzaq Razuqi) and submitted to the Political Agent in Bahrain for authorisation from the Political Resident. All of the manumission statements are included in the file in both English and Arabic, along with correspondence from the Residency Agent to the Bahrain Agency, and the Bahrain Agency to the Political Residency. All of the cases were straightforward in that manumission was unconditionally granted by the Political Resident.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Slave emancipation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Slave trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00024d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00024d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
