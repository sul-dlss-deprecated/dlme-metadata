MINES AND MINERALS. ^3) uil Fields in the Gulf outside Muscat territory. From To previous number. 191, 163.D^O.P.Z. 7762/35♦ I1©IA OFVIGE, By Air Mail&gt; Loridon, S.W. 1* 4th Uovember 1935* My dear Jfowle, Ae regards oil in the Persian Uilf, 1 write with reference to my telegram of 28th October to k t you know that Sir Bdmund Davis first postponed said then cancelled his appointment. The reason is explained in the letter from Holmes of 24th October of which copy has gone to you by air mail. On 23rd Octofcer Skliros and Lefroy called here and made a proposal which is briefly recapitulated in the former's letter of 24th October* of which copy has also been sent by air mail. J&lt;urther points which arose in the interview with Skliros and lefroy are stated in the letter of vdiich l enclose a copy, and which has been addressed to Starling, Kendel and Seal. Could you kindly let us know whether you concur in the proposals which are also made in the letter to the other Departments concerned ? As regards paragraph 7 (c) of that letter, it seems sufficient to inform the Company in these terms of the preliminary condition to be required of the Shaikhs, though in addressing the latter this condition could be made full and precise in the manner suggested in your note of 3rd October which you recorded here . I am sending copy of this letter and its enclosures to Metcalfe. Yours sincerely, 3d. M.J. CLAUSOH, (for J.C.Walton).Copy. P.2. 7763/35. IMPORTANT. India oflice, Whitehall, S.W. 1. 1st flovegiber 193 5. I enclose copy of a letter frorr) Mr. J. Skllros, Managing Director of the Iraq Petroleum Company, regarding a proposed procedure for acquiring options, and suosequently possible concessions, for oil in certain areas in the Persian Gulf* Certain points in this letter were more fully explained at an interview which 1 had with Mr. Skliros and Mr. Lefroy of the Anglo-Iranian oil Comapny on 23rd October. 2. 'The reason for forming a company - Petroleum Concessions, limited - separate from the Iraq Petroleum Company, is, I understood, merely hat the latter company has an Iraqi Government director, and it is not considered necessary or desirable that he should particupate in under takings solely concerned with the acquisition of concessions in countires outside Iraq. 3. As regards the Kuwait neutral zone, Petroleum Concessions, Limited, are aware of the position of deadlock resulting from ibn Saud , s comnitment to the Standard Oil &lt; of California, but they think that by the offer of an arrangement to fecilitate the marketing of the .Bahrain Petroleum Company* s production they may obtain the necessary leverage to induce the California company to relinquish their stronghold on Ibn Saud , s jart-interest in the Kuwait neutral zone. 4. With reference to the unallotted area of .Bahrain, nr. Lefroy did not think that thiswould be of value to ar^rone, but Mr. Skliros was inclined to think that it might be worth while to obtain an option wi th a view to its examination. ?.

So■M .y »•&gt; * See papers Vncioeea with India Office printed letters P.Z,5960, dated 2nd September 1935, and P.Z.7001, dated 3rd October 1935, respect ively: 3 - 2 - so far ae i know, we have not entered into commitments with anyone regarding this area, so that it is presumably open to any company which desires to do so to apply to tjh« Shaikh lor a concession (subject, of course, to His Majesty’s Gov e xiamen t • s approval) • 5* On the Xrucial Coast the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (or the D*Arcy .exploration Company) have, as you know, already obtained two-year options, subject to His Majesty's Government’s approval, at Has al Khaimah and Sharjah.# Mr. Lefroy stated that they have just obtained a similar option at Dubai, they are also in the field for options at Abu Dhabi, Ajman and umm al Qaiwain. ihe Anglo-Iranian Oil Company would go forward with their pending negotiations, but any concessions for which they have acquired or may acquire options on the rrucial Coast would be negotiated and taken by Petroleum Concessions, Limited. 6. The reference to the Pirate Coast is a geographical misunderstanding* Petroleum Concessions, Limited, might interest itself in the possibilities of Muscat, where we have not committed ourselves to anyone ani the field is consequently open. 7 * 1 stated that certain preliminary conditions to the approval of options on the Trucial coast (which had been discussed with K'owle during his deputation) would be required by His Maj esty’s Government, vizi Vis a vj s the Company (a) that any geologist or employee who visits any of the fruci *1 Shaikhdoms for the purpose of exploring or surveying the area of the option should be of British nationality; (b)(b) that the explorii-g party in their travels would be definitely guided by the views of the Ke si dent as to where they should go* frla a vis the Shalkht- (c) that the Shaikh concerned should give a definite guarantee in writing that he would be responsible for the safety of the exploring or surveying party* I added that another condition to the approval of an option would be that further approval by Hi s “aje sty # s Government would be recessary before negotiations fcr an actual concession were entered into with the Shaikh concerned* 8* The question of our future policy on the xrucial Coast, which was discussed by the Middle East Qommittee on 24th September, has, of course, a certain r elevance to the question whether in this backward surd uncivilised area the acquisition of oil concessions by any company, of whatever nationality, ou^it to be encouraged or permitted* The result of t he meeting in regard to general policy was somewhat inconclusive, but there is, I think, nothing in the conclusions, such as they were, to A suggest that we ought to arrive at a definite decision to sterilise the Trucial Goast so far'as oil is concerned, indeed, the trend of the discussion was rather in the opposite direction, and kowle himself, though he is averse from any new pronouncement of general policy, has always taken the view that in regard to oil we can hardly Impose an absolute veto on concessions which the Shaikhs may wish to grant, though specially careful conditions to safeguard the interests of His Majesty^ Govern ment and limit our commitments would be necessary* in any case, by stipulating that the actual commencement of negotiations for a concession, apart from the conditions on which it shouldbe granted, will be subject to Hi s *aj esty *8 Governroe nt # s approval, we shall, so far as is now practicable, ensure that each case is kept open for decision by His Majesty's Govern ment, when the time comes, in the light of considerations of general policy and of the degree of commitment which the grant of any concession would involve# 9# On the question of nationality, it will be seen that the national complexion of Petroleum Concessions, Limited, i identical with that of the Iraq Petroleum Company# It was explained to me that Petroleum Concessions, Limited, would probably beget separate companies to exploit the several areas in which they mit£it be successful in obtaining concess ions, but that such are the ra tional jealousies on the part of the non# British elements in the Iraq Petroleum Company that there is ro chance of such companies being formed on a basis of a larger proportion of -Brirish ownership thah that in the Iraq Petroleum Company itself# As, however, the areas mentioned ^apart, possibly, from the Kuwait neutral zone) are within the hed Line Agreement, it seems necessary ta&gt; be content with the Iraq Petroleum Company»s proportion of British shareholding, since no British company outside the Iraq Petroleum Company has shown a serious interest in these areas# Holmes has indeed been angling during the last few months for the interest of &lt;21 all-British group (which, however, had no experience of oil concessions), but I have now heard from him that his negotiations have definitely broken down# 10* If the Petroleum Department and the other departments concerned and the rolidical Kesident in the Persian Gulf agree, we would propose to inform Petroleum Concessions, Limited, as followss- (a) On the crucial Coast, subject to the conditions stated above, His m ajesty*s Government approve the options already• 5 - already granted by the Shaikhs of Has al Khaim ah , Sharjah and Dubaif and any options that nay be granted by other Shaikhs* if it la desired during the currency of an option to enter into negotiations with the Shaikh concerned for a conceaeion, the prior approval of His ^€yesty # s Government will be required before such negotiations are opendd* in the event of such approval to the commencement of negotiations being given, the conditions to safeguard Government interests which would have to be attached to any concession obtained would be considered and would have to be accepted by the com pany before an actual concession w as approved* (b) in Bahrain and Muscat there is no objection to Petroleum Concessions, Limited, applying to the rulers concerned, on the understanding that any concession granted would be subject to the conditions considered necessary to safeguard Government interests* (c) As ragards the Kuwait neutral zone, application may be made to the Shaikh of Kuwait for an option for his part-interest in the zone, on t he understanding that, if it should later become possible for the Odnpany to seek a concession from him and Ibn S a ud jointly, the prior approval of Hi s i&amp;j esty ? s ''ovemment would have to be sought before the company entered into negotiations with those rulers, and any actual concession eventually granted would be subject to such conditions (which might b® 61 Special character, in view of the peculiar juridical position of the zone) as were considered necessary to safeguard -British political interests* 11* It will be observed that the company propose to employ Holmes for the negotiations of actual concessions* Mr* Skli ros explained that this proposal was made faute de mieux. 6 - (3 f mleux * it is of course primarily the business of the tfoinpahy whom they employ and, subject to Tov/le^s views, we do not think that we need make any obje ctioru i-**• If petroleum ^onceasioijs Limited should make the / •* application, ofi^hich the possibility is forseen in the penultimate paragraph of Mr. Skliros's letter, for special permission for Mr. Baker to vi si t areas on the ixucial Cfcast, we could condiser in concultation with Fowle the question of ..*aking an e^rception in that particular case from the general rule suggested in paragraph 7 ^a) above. 13. I am sejding a similar letter to Rendel and Seal and a letter, of taiiich a cipy is enclosed, to Air Vice Marshal Courtney. We should be grateful if you could let us lave an e arly reply as we should like to let petroleum Concessions Limited have a reply to their enquiry as soon as possible. Yours sii®rely, Sd. J.C.
