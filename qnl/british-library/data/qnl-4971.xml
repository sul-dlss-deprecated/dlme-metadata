As it is notorious that Persian Government has no money, and Minister of Telegraphs is under Russian protection, responsibility of Russian Government is plain.

There is no objection to construction of line if we have a pledge that it is not [? to be] constructed under Russian control, with Russian signallers, but this is almost certainly condition of loan. Our refusal to provide poles would cause delay in construction, as cost of carriage of wood poles would be prohibitive.

According to what [? appears to me] trustworthy information, Minister of Telegraphs, who is deeply in debt to Russian Bank, is receiving loan for the purpose of constructing telegraph line from Seistan to Robat, and second wire from Tehran to Sharud. He has ordered his subordinates to ask Indian Telegraph Department as to cost of Robat telegraph [? #ork]s, and the departmental officials have been asked to put up second wire from Tehran to Sharud for use of Russian Legation, which sends notices that way to St. Petersburgh. If posts are provided from Robat, they will be used for extension to Meshed-Seistan line under same conditions as before, i.e., Russian control. Persian Telegraph Department and Consul at Seistan report increased Russian inter ference with telegraph administration on this line. Result of arrangement is that Minister of Telegraphs receives a private loan from Russians for construction of line to Sharud and frontier of Seistan. Russians will no longer want Tehran-Meshed line, as they will have connection via Sharud and Astrabad. [? Virtually] they will also have complete control as far as Baluchistan frontier.

In making above proposal to Persian Government you should point out extremely cheap rate at which material would be charged for. Confidential. Advantage of above arrangement is tha Persian Government are not likely to be able to repay cost for a long time and un til they do line will be under direct con trol of Telegraph Department.

I am. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,With reference to my note, dated the 3rd June,1907, on the construction of the proposed line Kohat to ITasratahad, I have to report that I have received a telegram, dated the 21st instant, from the director of Telegraphs at Teheran to the following effect :- your proposals any proposal to involve cash payment Toy Persia to us, but endeavour to effect a recovery of charges by reduction of amount due by us to Persia, and spread payment over prolonged period. In my note I recommended that the line should be constructed by my department for the Pers ian Government and that when this Government paid the bill for tine cost of its construction the line should be made over to its control, the probability being that a long time would elapse before the bill was paid. However, as the British Minister at Teheran considers it would be more advisable to try and arrange for payment of the cost of the line by keeping back some portion of the subsidies that have^under the Telegraph Conventions^ to be paid to the Persian Government, this alternative is one that should receive careful consideration. The objection to it appears to me to be that the Persian Government would claim control of the telegraph line from the first as being their own property to be paid for by instalments. Whereas, under my proposal the line would remain under direct British control until such time as the payment for its construction had been made in full. ritish Minister, Teheran, says do not include inNote on the construction of the proposed line Robat to Hasratabad. N In connection with, the question of stores for the line to Xasratabad from Robat, it has to be noted that the line from Meshed to Masratabad is constructed cheaply on wooden poles of indifferent quality. The Persian Government would therefore consider a similar line quite sufficient for the extension from Rasratabad to the frontier at Robat, and they would have no wish to construct it with the expensive permanent material that is now stored at Robat. The telegram shows that this material at the rate list value is worth Rs.36250 (£2416), and that it has cost Rs.104233 (£6948) to deposit it at Robat. I think we may take two thirds of the freight charges as having been incurred in transporting the stores from Quetta to Robat, and that to convey the stores back to Quetta would require some equivalent expenditure. It is evident therefore that as the Stores are at Robat the only useful purpose they can be put to is for the construc tion of the line to Hasratabad. should they not be used for this purpose they will have in ordinary course to be carried back to Quetta to be used at all, and the cost of this carriage back will be more than the value of the stores when they get there. As a mere question of expense it appears to be better to find a purchaser for the stores at Robat and to part with them there at the rate list price, than to carry them back to India. The/V The Government of India state that one solution of the question might be to let the Indo-European Telegrs Department take over the materials at cost price plus carriage, and add the cost to that of the Central Persia line on terms of that line. This proposal seems to mean that tne line to h asratabad should be constructed as a branch of bhe Central Persia line. If the proposed arrangement were come to^ the Indo-European Telegraph Department would have to pay an annual rental of one per cent of the capital cost of the line to the Persian Government for objyears, when the line would become the property of that Government. The Persian Government migh possibly agree to this arrangement as it is entirely in their favour, seeing that they would have a line constructed and maintained for them free of cost, a rental paid them for it, and the line eventually handed over to them without any payment for it on their part. I do not think this proposal should be put before the Persian Government except possibly as a last resource to obtain the line. If the proposal was made and agreed to, the line would form a part of the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s system, and the jndian traffic carried by it would come under the Joint Purse arrangements, but the Government of India in their telegram point out that they particularly desire this should be avoided. subject to certain conditions they would agree to sell the telegraph material at pobat without charging for the The Government of India finally state that costcost of carriage. If therefore the material, can he ob tained at this price, the Government of Persia may see the advantage of taking it. The Persian Telegraph Adminis tration has asked for assistance to put up the line to Uasratabad from the frontier at Robat. The best v/ay of dealing v/ith the case would now appear to be to take action similar to what was done in the provision for the Persian Government of the line from Henjam to Bunder Abbas. After pointing out the extremely cheap rate at which the stores would be charged for, our offer might be to provide the Persian Government with the engineers and materials for the construction of the line by the Indo-European Telegraph Department as a Persian Crown line at a price not exceeding the expenditure, which an esti mate previeusly prepared would show was necessary^ to construct the line, to make it over to the Persian Tele- ' /l graph Administration as soon as it was completed and the charges for it had been paid. A condition to providing the line on these terms should be, as required by the Government of India, that the Persian Government will pledge itself that the control of the line will never be made over to any foreign Government or company other than British, and that none but Persian and British employes will be allowed on the line and in its offices. The Persian Telegraph Administration should maintain the line after it was taken over by it^and the Persian Government should guarantee the payment of the bill for the cost of the line. Persian Government may object to the use of telegraph material of the Indian pattern in Persia, but mtat, if they accept the offer of it as proposed hove, there is not nuch probability of their paying the bill of charges for a long tine to cone, and until they do the line would ce under the direct control of the Indo- European Telegraph Department, and would he obtained on better terms than if it were a branch of the Central Persia line. 3rd.

In view of prevalent feeling against foreign concessions, it would be difficult to arrange construction and control by Indo-European Telegraph Department. Besides, there would be no revenue, as Department [group undecypherable : ? derives] no profit on messages inside Persia. I suggest following : cost to the Persian Government of wooden poles would be about 8,000 tomans, and value of material now lying idle at Robat with [?] carriage is about double. In reply to Persian inquiry, Department might reply that they would hand over their iron posts at same cost as wooden ones, and also offer expert assistance. Once line is constructed, Department, who have men on the spot, could maintain it at small cost. (Addressed to Foreign Office ; sent to India.)Z&lt;??/ m V It appears the Persian Telegraph Department pro poses to construct the line from the Indian frontier at V Rohat up to Kasratabad geistan, and has asked the British Telegraph Department in Persia for assistance in providing material. There is no telegraph material available for the work in Persia, and as it must therefore be sent out from fsJh. u. 1 1 hi^l home there would be much delay about getting it to Robat. But the Government of India have in store at Robat all the material needed to construct this line, and it would be advisable that this material should be used. The Persian Government have already objected to the use in Persia of s telegraph material of the Indian Department's patterns, so that the pattern of the material at Robat will probably be put forward as a difficulty to its use. An attempt should certainly be made to induce the Persian Government to V^ J entrust the construction of the line to the Government of India,seeing that the stores for it '’nave been brought at much expense to Robat, and to carry other material there would mean useless expenditure and much delay'. If the con trol of the line, when constructed can also be arranged, for, it would mean much greater efficiency in its working. It is probable however that the Persian Government will want the terminus of the line oft the Persian side of the frontier • at Robat / and to be connected with thefcl^ office there on the Central Persia line. to * • 2nd May,1907.ib^ 7 -5?^ In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote no. 13880. and address— * The Under-Secretary of State, ! ^ Foreign Office, London.

Your most obedient humble Servant v&amp;d~\ 10 a.m. 5 FEB 1907 The Under Secretary of State, India Office.2(d o-j [This Doeument is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Governj THE Russian Minister has on two occasions lately approached me with regard to the Meshed-Seistan telegraph line, and informed me of the proposals which, as I understand from you, have already been made officially by the Russian Government. He stated that M. Isvolsky thought that a discussion between the Russian and British Ministers here would greatly facilitate a settlement. I informed M. Hartwig, in reply, that 1 had received no instructions on the subject, and that I had reason to believe that in your view any discussion here Avould only lead to further complication. I agreed, however, to communicate to you privately the views which he had expressed, together with any personal observations which might suggest themselves, arising out of information supplied by the local British telegraph officials on the spot. With such considerations the Indian Government is already familiar. They amount' to this : that an alternative line to the India frontier, via Meshed and Seistan, under European supervision and control, would greatly facilitate telegraphic communication, hut that it would be more economical in the end to construct the line with iron posts, especially if they could be imported via Batoum and Baku. With regard to the forest of cypresses as to which the Russian Government proposed to obtain a monopoly from the Persian Government, and as to the exact locality of which I was unable to obtain information, it appears to be most probable that reference is made to cypress woods on the Khorassan frontier, as no cypress forests are known to exist south of Pul-i-Katun. There are, however, fir plantations south of that point, but they are necessary for the shelter of the villages from the prevailing winds, and their destruction would lead to serious popular discontent. In view of the attitude adopted here by M. Hartwig, and by M. Isvolsky at St. Petersburgh, that the question of the control of the line is of purely technical importance, I venture to submit a short summary of what actually has taken place between the Russian and Persian Governments on the subject. In the loan negotiations which took place in 1902 one of the conditions proposed by Russia was a Russian telegraph line from Meshed along the Afghan frontier to Seistan. This proposal was modified by M. Witte, who agreed that the line should be constructed and worked by the Persian Government out of the proceeds of the loan. A verbal promise was at the same time given by the Shah that the services of Russian signallers should be used on the line, and that its Seistan line should not be connected with the Central Persian or Indian telegraphic systems (Sir Arthur Hardinge’s Memorandum of the 23rd December, 1905). The Persian Government, although it first allowed the employment of the signallers, insisted that they should be recalled. But on the eve of the Shah’s departure in May 1905 the Russian Government renewed its pressure, and the Shah allowed their temporary appointment pending discussion of the question with the Emperor of Russia. This concession was, in Sir Arthur Hardinge’s opinion (his No. 116 of the 24th May, 1905), wrung from the Shah by a desire to please the Russians on the eve of his visit to St. Petersburgh. It subsequently appeared that an additional concession had been obtained, namely, that of a telegraphic line from Kuchan to the Trans-Caspian frontier, thus linking Seistan with the telegraphic system of Russia (Sir Arthur Hardinge’s despatch No. 127, of the 10th June, 1905). In June 1905 the working and control of the line was in the hands of the Russians, and thirteen Russian engineers and telegraphists were employed on it. In September 1906 the Grand Vizier admitted that orders had been given that the instruments at Meshed should be transferred from the Persian to the Russian office, but denied that any further concessions w r ould be made. This particular concession had been made by order of the Shah in compliance with a written demand made by the Russian Minister (Mr. Grant Duff’s No. 239 of the 13th September). It appeared, however, that the Persian Ministry of Telegraphs had been instructed by the Persian Foreign Office to hand over the control of the whole line to the Russians, including the Seistan end; and CONFIDENTIAL.

[2261 aa—10]the instruments at Nasratabad were actually removed to a Russian office, giving the Rnssians the nower to cut off communication at will. It is remarkable that this new concession, whfch must have been due to the influence of the Mushir-ed-Dowleh coincided with the reported attempts made by him at the time to seeuie a loan from Russ . It appears, therefore, that the design of Russia to obtain control of telegraphic communication between Seistan and Astrakhan has been the subject of repeated demands on the Shah and on the Persian Government, and that it has only been finally, accomplished after negotiations lasting since 1902. It is also significant that the Sha appems to have been given to understand that the Emperor ot Russia himself attached spS significance to the demand and that his reception in St. Petersburg!! would be affected by the nature of his reply. ^ haye &amp;c , T T T'fc TT* T 'XT3 fah- ,( ~f [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] ' \ PERSIA.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 31 of the 2nd February last, I have the honour to report that the Mushir-ed-Dowleh confidentially informed me that the Russian Minister was pressing the Persian Government very hard to give the Russian Government complete control of the Meshed-Seistan telegraph line. M. Hartwig argued that most of the principal telegraph lines in Persia were in British hands, and it was only fair that Russia should have her share. I pointed out to his Excellency that Russia already controlled five telegraph lines in Khorassan, viz., Astrabad to Chikishlar, Astrabad to Gunbad Kaboos, Meshed to Askhabad, Meshed to Sarakhs, and Meshed to Artek, and that His Majesty’s Govern ment claimed the right to post signallers on the Meshed-Seistan line identical in number with those employed by Russia. His Excellency replied that he was quite aware that what I said was correct, hut the Persian Government were in a very difficult position. They were still, however, resisting the Russian demands to the best of their ability. As I have already had the honour to report, it appears certain that the Russian Government has for some time practically controlled the Meshed-Seistan line, and the efforts of the Persian Government to oust the Russian signallers will probably fail.

Assurance by Russia that she would raise no obstacles to our establishing a special line from Nasratahad to Koh-i-Malik-Siah hardly meets our objections, since apart from those arising from inevitable extension of Russian influence as far south as Nasratabad, an influence which would be extended and strengthened if she secures monopoly of cypress forests, such negative support as she is apparently prepared to give would not necessarily secure us the concession from the Persian Government. See Spring-Rice’s telegram of 26th November 1906. Moreover, the informal pledge said to have been given by the present Shah that he would not allow our lines to be joined with the Seistan line would not presumably bind his successor, and on his demise we ought perhaps in any case to secure this concession. If, however, Russia undertakes to give active support in obtaining this con cession forthwith, we are of opinion that failing any of the three courses suggested in my telegram of 7th September, for which we gather His Majesty’s Government are not now prepared to press, the proposals made by Isvolsky might be accepted, but only, as he first suggested, as a modus vivendi pending a general settlement of our mutual relations regarding Persia. But as a preliminary measure it seems desirable to arrive at a satisfactory understanding on the three following points:— Pirstly, as to disposal of income derived from messages sent by British wire between Seistan and Meshed. In view of probability that the line may eventually become part of through line of communication between India and Europe this point is of considerable commercial importance. Secondly, we think that it should be stipulated that any facilities given to Russian telegraphists or Persians paid by Russia, to inspect and repair Meshed-Seistan line, should be extended equally to our employes in respect of the wire reserved for us, otherwise our wire would never be in working order. Thirdly, if the placing of second wire on the Meshed-Seistan line is impossible, as reported by the Consul-General, Meshed, under present con ditions, we would urge replacement of existing poles by stronger poles should be effected immediately, and not gradually as is proposed. Information as to number of messages passing over line will be sent when received.Minute Paper. SECRET DEPARTMENT.

ISVOLSKY to-day expressed to me his regret that he was not yet in a position to give me a reply to the latest proposals which I had communicated to him for a settlement of the question of the Meshed-Seistan telegraph line, hut he was in consultation with certain Departments on some sanitary matters relative to guards and cordons, which would he involved in coming to a decision on the subject. He hoped shortly to he in a position to give me a definite reply. I trust that the reference which M. Isvolsky made to the sanitary cordons and guards indicates an intention of accepting our proposal for an exchange of the Meshed- Tehran line for that to Nasratabad. 1 am inclined to think that an exchange in the eyes of the Russian Government would be preferable to recurring to the status quo ante, as the return of the instruments to the Persian offices might be regarded as a surrender to our demands, while the exchange would be interpreted as a fair bargain. The chief objections formulated by M. Isvolsky on previous occasions to the exchange were dictated by a fear that it would prematurely disclose the bases on which an eventual arrangement between the two countries in regard to Persia might be made, but owing to recent revelations in the press these objections must be considerably modified. I did not press M. Isvolsky for any elucidation of the reference which he made to sanitary questions, as he very possibly would not have given them to me, and it is preferable to await the concrete proposals which, I trust, he will shortly communicate to me. y.

Tehran-Meshed Telegraph Line. THE connection of the Indo-European Telegraph Department with this line arose in 1885 out of the necessity for rapid communication between the Government of India and their Commissioner for the delimitation of the Afghan frontier. In the first instance, the Indian Government obtained the permission of the Persian Government to send a signaller to Meshed. The line had been up to that time a purely Persian line, constructed and worked by the Persian Government. It was soon found that the line was in such a bad state of repair that, unless something was done to it, it would be useless for the purposes of the Government of India. That Government, therefore, proposed to the Persian Government that the line should be repaired by the Indo-European Department at a cost of 20,000 rupees out of Indian revenues. Out of this arrangement grew the present arrangement, under which the Indian-European Department undertake to spend annually on repairs a sum not exceeding 20,000 rupees, the Persian Government contributing also 15,000 krans a-year towards the same object. The line is a single-wire line, 568 miles in length, supported on wooden posts. Por the purposes of maintenance of the line and offices the Indo-European Telegraph Department employ an Assistant Superintendent to inspect and report, the work being carried out under his supervision. Line guards, paid by the Persian Govern ment, are employed for the protection of the line. Both at Tehran and at Meshed the offices of the Persian Telegraph Department, with its own instruments, and the Indo-European Telegraph Department, with its own instruments, are in one building ; at Meshed the Russian telegraph office, with its own instruments, is also in the same building. The Indo-European Telegraph Department employ a signaller for this line at Tehran, and another (recently two others) at Meshed to deal with messages between the Legation and the Consulate-General. At intermediate stations the signallers are Persians. Both at Tehran and at Meshed the wire terminates in the Indo-European Telegraph Department Office. When the British signaller has finished his work, he gives the wire to the Persian office by means of an instrument called the commutator. It is not known whether at Tehran the Russian signaller goes to the Persian office to work with Meshed, or whether by means of a commutator the wire is given to a Russian office. At Meshed the Persian office gives the wire to the Russian office by the commutator. They each have stated times for working with Tehran. Meshed-Seistan Telegraph Line. In May 1901 we first heard that the Persian Government were contemplating extend in o' their telegraph system from Meshed to Birjand, and that the local Kar°'uzar was pressing for an extension to Seistan. In September 1901 ne hearu. that the ^Persian Government had sanctioned a grant of 70,000 tomans for a line from [2173 u—T]2 Meshed to Seistan. The line was inaugurated in April 1902, the Russian Consul- General taking a prominent part in the proceedings. He told Colonel Trench that he hoped to arrange a junction between the Russian and Persian systems, so as to have a continuous line from Askhabad to Scistan. The line was constructed by a Russian engineer. It was completed to Nasratabad on the 21st December, 1903, but in the previous July, when it had only reached Neh, it was reported that the Russians had announced. their intention to post military signallers along the line under the orders of an officer whose head-quarters should be in Seistan. One of these signallers had already been sent to Birjand in May 1903. In October 1903 another Russian signaller was posted at Shusp. In luly two more arrived, one to be posted at Meshed, the other at Birjand. By October 1901 live more signallers arrived at Meshed, destined for Birjand (two), Kain, Sarbeshir, and Bandan. The Persian Government at first made a show of resistance to the admission of these signallers to their offices; but finally, on the eve of the Shah’s departure for Europe,'he agreed to their “ provisional ” admission. The Persian Government were compelled to admit our theoretical right to similar treatment, and signallers were sent from India to be posted at Nasratabad (Scistan), Birjand, and Turbat, though the Persians in practice for a long time resisted their admission. Nothing is accurately known of the exact status of the Russians on the line ; hut, besides their signallers, they are believed to have two Russian inspectors and six mechanics. The inspectors control the line guards and are in charge of repairs, &amp;c. They are believed to be paid partly by Prussia and partly by Persia, and it is believed that Russia has, at least in part, paid for repairs. The line is a single-wire line, about 520 miles in length, supported on wooden poles. At Meshed the Seistan wire, until recently, terminated in the Persian office; and at stated times the Persian signallers, by means of the commutator, gave the wire to the British and Russian offices respectively. It may he that what has happened recently is that the wire lias been taken to a commutator in the Russian office, enabling them to give it to the Persian cr British offices at their discretion.f ,v 3 7 9 r ( 4 &gt; / In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote no. 40332. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

He gave me, however, heads of proposed agreement as follows :— Russia to retain control, but to substitute Persian guards for Russian; to renew posts, obtaining for that purpose concession of monopoly of cypress forests ; to give us separate wire for us to work ourselves ; to withdraw opposition to line from Seistan to Ivi i-h i -Malik-Siah. I said that if he wished I could communicate proposal privately to you, with the opinion of the English telegraph Director here, but I warned him that such commu nication would have no official character. Director’s opinion, from a purely technical standpoint, is that alternative route to India via Meshed would be of great value, but that it would be more economical in the end to employ iron posts. I learn from a sure source (1) that Russian Minister has already applied for monopoly of cypress wood on Meshed—Seistan line, which, if granted, would of course entail considerable power of control; (2) Persian Governor of Seistan has recommended construction of Persian line from Nasratabad to Ku-hi-Malik-Siah in order to forestall British action. I venture to suggest that no answer should be returned through me. ft'®ltes compromis int de T f\ IUY ernenieDt' meme proii- un arran^- rs at avant le un v-n/v Jy yS~~ ni * [This Docnmeat is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] T PERSIA.

WITH reference to Mr. Grant Duff’s telegram No 257 of tbe 24th ultimo, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a note which Mr. Grant Duff addressed to the Persian Government on receipt of the intelligence that the Russians were tampering with the Seistan end of the Meshed-Seistan line. No answer has as yet been received to this note. As the whole question is being discussed at St. Petersburgh, and as any action here might be prejudicial to our interests should the line pass eventually into our hands, I propose not to press the Persian Government any further at present. I may mention, however, that there has been a noticeable delay in the delivery of messages addressed to this Legation from Seistan since the line passed into Russian control, and that His Majesty’s Consul at Turbat-i-Haidari has complained of the difficulty of getting connection with intermediate stations. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL SPRING-RICE. Inclosure in No. 1. Mr. E. Grant Duff to Grand Vizier. AT an interview I had the honour to have with your Plighness recently at Rustemabad, you assured me that the Persian Government would on no account give the control of the Seistan end of the Meshed-Seistan line to the Russian Government. I learn from His Majesty’s Consul in Seistan that on the evening of the 20th September the Russian telegraph officials at Nasratabad cut the connection leading to the Persian office and took the line into their own office, which is now separate. The wire now goes to the Persian office from the Russian office. It would appear that the local authorities had received positive instructions from the Sipahdar to oppose any such action, but that no steps were taken. A report from a reliable source has also reached me that the Russian telegraph officials are taking control of all intermediate stations between Meshed and Nasratabad where their signallers are posted. I have the honour to request your Highness to be so good, in view of your recent assurances, to favour me with an explanation of the action of the Persian Government in this matter.

Should Russia decline to accept alternatives now offered her, His Majesty’s Government may perhaps wish to take measures to secure construction of link as means towards equalizing in some measure our position in Seistan, though real solution of difficulty is the exchange already suggested to Russia by His Majesty’s Government.

Isvolsky yesterday afternoon in regard to the telegraph line between Meshed and Seistan, and I told him that His Majesty’s Government earnestly desired to see this question settled without loss of time. I pointed out to his Excellency that the transactions which had recently occurred at Meshed and at Nasratabad constituted, in the opinion of my Government, a disturbance of the status quo to the disadvantage of British interests, and I felt sure that, if matters were allowed to remain as at present, there would he constant frictions and troubles, wdiich it w r as especially at this moment the desire both of my Government and I knew of his Excellency also to avoid. I had proposed, under instructions from you, a very fair and reasonable arrangement which would obviate any difficulties in the future, and I was convinced that the exchange of our respective controls over the Tehran-Meshed and the Meshed-Seistan lines would offer a satisfactory solution of the matter. I impressed on his Excellency that my Government attached importance to the matter being settled in the way I had indicated with as little delay M. Isvolsky begged for a little time to examine the question, and he repeated to me the arguments wdiich he had employed on a former occasion, and especially parties, and disclosing to them, in a measure, the methods by wdiieh we proposed to arrange our mutual relations in Persia. I told M. Isvolsky that my Government did not share his apprehensions on this point, and, indeed, it seemed to me that the solution which I had suggested would appear to all as a perfectly simple and natural one. Ko other country hut ourselves—• Persia, of course, excepted—had any interests either in Khorassan or in Seistan, and while I was ready to admit that Russian interests predominated in the northern section, it was equally clear that British interests predominated, I might almost say exclusively in the Seistan districts. As matters stood it seemed illogical that Russia should control a line in Seistan while we exercised one over a line in the north. I proposed, therefore, a mutual concession, to he carried out in a spirit in harmony with that wdiich inspired the new departure we were both taking in respect to Persian affairs, and which would clear the ground of a question which I feared, if allowed to remain in its present situation, would prove a troublesome and thorny one. The details concerning the transfer would he extremely simple, and I could not conceive that they would cause any excitement or misunderstandings. M. Isvolsky said that he w T as not opposed to the transfer in principle, but that he must ask for time to examine the question more carefully. I said that I did not wish to extort from him a reply at our present interview, hut that I trusted his examination would he concluded vdth as little delay as possible. As it v 7 as his Excellency’s weekly reception, and as many others w-ere waiting to see him, I could not unduly prolong our interview, hut on my return home I recapitulated in a private letter the arguments which I had employed, and again impressed upon his Excellency the urgency of a settlement.

CONFIDENTIAL. [34606] [October 15.] Section 3. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received October 15.) (No. 663.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, September 29, 1906. 4 I TOLD M. Isvolsky this morning that I wished to speak to him seriously on a question which, I feared, unless promptly settled, might become a troublesome one. I alluded, I said, to the Meshed-Seistan line; and 1 observed that, since I had last spoken to him on the subject, further steps had been taken, and that now the Seistan end of the line had been brought into the Russian office at Nasratabad, which was a separate room, whence connection was led into the Persian office. This, therefore, gave control over that end of the line as well as over the terminal line at Meshed to the Russian authorities. This was a condition of affairs which was extremely unfortunate. I said that I had proposed to him a very fair and reasonable compromise, to be effected by an exchange of our supervision over the Tehran-Meshed line for the Russian control over the Meshed-Seistan line. The Tehran-Meshed line might be of use to the Russian authorities, while the other line was of little value to them, and, as matters at present stood, there would be constant causes for trouble and incon venience. I was, therefore, instructed to repeat my above-mentioned proposal and to express the hope that it would be immediately carried into effect, and before we discussed further the question of making a joint payment of the second moiety of the advance to the Persian Government. M. Isvolsky repeated to me the arguments which he had used on the former occasion, and said that he would be prepared to study my proposal, but he feared that the transfer of the two, lines would make a noise (“retentissement ”) throughout Persia, and awake the curiosity of other parties. Was it wise for us, he asked, to disclose prematurely to the watchful eyes of third parties any portion of our cards ? Should we, before we had advanced very far in our general negotiations, afford to others an insight into the aims of our discussions ? He thought we should be very careful in this respect. I said that I did not see why more ‘ c retentissement ” should be caused by the step I had suggested than by the fact of our making a joint advance. His Excellency observed that the Persian Government might be alarmed at so striking an evidence of our co-operation, and I replied that I did not think that this would be a disadvantage. M. Isvolsky said that it might induce the Persian Government to turn to a third party; but with this view I did not agree, or attribute great importance to it. His Excellency said that Germany had no political interests in Persia, and was unable so make her presence felt there in the way that Russia and England could; and, in these circumstances, Persia might regard her as an disinterested friend to whom she could apply for advice and assistance. He did not wish to hasten this possible intimacy before our general arrangement was concluded. I maintained that it was of importance that all causes of friction between us should be removed, and I foresaw possibilities in the near future of trouble and annoyance if the Russian authorities retained their hold over the Seistan line. His Excellency said he would examine the question, though he confessed he did not see the urgent importance of it. r 11 n vp p (Signed) ' A. NICOLSON. [2173 p-3] i fI, ■ ... CONFIDENTIAL.

Meanwhile, Consul-General at Meshed submits following objections :— The wooden posts on both lines are unequal to carrying another wire. Plan might work on the Tehran line, which is well looked after, but on the Seistan line it would be impossible. There would inevitably be difficulties regarding maintenance, as, unless we share responsibility equally for everything, we could touch only our own wire on the Seistan line. Consul-General suggests possibility of costly alternative of metal posts for two wires, or new lines of wooden posts for British wire. Burden of expense would be unequally distributed, as Government of India pay almost all maintenance of Tehran line, whereas Russians pay little or nothing on the Seistan line. Russians will still control Persian traffic on Seistan line, and political _ importance of position on Afghan frontier will be more valuable to Russia than a similar position in North Persia to us. Construction of Kuh Malik Siah extension would improve our position, but would not make it equal to Russian.» In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

His Excellency gave me the Memorandum when he had finished reading it, and I said I would communi cate it to you by to-morrow’s messenger. Monsieur Isvolsky said that he had studied the question very carefully, and felt assured that it would he inopportune to carry through an exchange of the two telegraph lines not only on account of the reasons men tioned in the Memorandum, but also because it would raise prematurely the resistance with which ho would have to contend, to bring to a successful issue our negotiations hu Right Honourable Sir E. Grey, Bart., M.P., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.negotiations in respect to a general arrangement of our mutual relations regarding Persia. I made no observations on these remarks, beyond saying that I trusted he would succeed in overcoming any opposition he might meet with during the course of our general negotiations. I thought it would be pru dent to abstain from discussing the compromise which he suggested, firstly because I was unwilling to prejudge any views you might have on the subject, and secondly, because a discussion on the eve of his departure on a holiday could lead to no useful result. Moreover my memory as to the history of the establishment of the Meshed-Reistan -line was not sufficiently fresh to en able me to refute or admit offhand the accuracy of the history of events as given in the Memorandum. Assuming that the establishment of special wires is practical, it seemed to me, on first impressions, that the solution did not remove one of the chief objec tions to the Russian control of the line which existed in the presence of Russian telegraphists and other em ployes in the Eastern Persian districts. It is, how-howavar, for His Majesty’s Government to decide whether the compromise suggested by Monsieur Isvolsky will serve as a provisional arrangement pending the conclusion of a final agreement on the whole Persian Question. Monsieur Isvolsky then read to me a telegram which he had received from Count Benckendorff, giving, His Excellency assumed, a summary of a memorandum which had been communicated to the Ambassador by Sir C. Hardinge. The summary was in English and was almost in identic terms with the substance of the telegrimi No. 381 which T had the honour to receive from you on the 3rd. in stant. Monsieur Isvolsky said he had no exception to take to-the terms of the communication, but he would wish to remark to me that the views he had communicated to me were merely personal to him, and that he had only accepted the principle of the sphere of interest which was indicated by the line Birjand Bunder-Abbas. I re plied that I had at the time explained that the vie ws he had been good enough to express to me were merely personal, and that I was sure that there had been no misunderstanding on that point. Neither my Governmentnor myself had taken them as an official expression of opinion on the part of the minister for Foreign Affairs speaking on behalf of the Russian Government, and I had, I added, acquainted my Government with the ob stacles which he anticipated in the way of carrying through the proposed agreement. T was a little puzzled at the apparent emphasis Monsieur Isvolsky laid on his having been in favour of the Birland-Bunder Abbas line in principle only, as on previous occasions he had expressed his own opinion very clearly on the subject, and it seemed to me as if he wore now disposed to make some mental reservations. I did not think it necessary to question him on the subject at this stage, as he is wall aware that we shall not modify our proposals in that respect, and I attribute his apparent hesitation to a fear that we might take the frank expression of his personal view as a binding engagement on him as Minister for Foreign Affairs before he has boon able to win over all his colleagues and the General Staff to his opinions.

ISYOLSKY handed to me this afternoon a Memorandum, of which I have the honour to transmit a copy, in regard to the Meshed—Seistan line. The Memorandum traverses most of the statements which I had recorded in my Memorandum of the 12th instant, but, as I reminded M. Isvolsky, I had already informed him that the information which had been supplied in that document was subject to modification in the light of further explanations which I had received subsequent to my communica tion. I asked him if he wished to discuss the matter at present, but he replied that it would perhaps be preferable to defer our conversation on the subject until we were in a position to treat of the whole situation in Persia. I said that it seemed to me that this would be the best course to follow, but that I could tell him that I was prepared to propose a compromise which would, I thought, satisfactorily settle the difficulties of the two telegraph lines of Tehran-Meshed and Meshed-Seistan. I was, I said, in a position to suggest that if we ceded our control or superintendence over the former line, the Russian Government should make a similar concession to us with respect to the latter line. His Excellency said that this was certainly a proposal worthy of examination, and that we might go into the matter when we resumed our discussions on Persia. I would point out that the Russian Memorandum discards as without any foundation the report that the Russian Legation at Tehran was endeavouring to obtain complete control over the Meshed-Seistan line.

LA question du telegraphe Mesched-Seistan telle qu’elle est posee dans I’aide- memoire de I’Amhassade Britannique en date du 30 Aout (12 Septembre), annee courante, necessite des 6claircissements et des rectifications importantes. L’assentiment du Gouvernement Persan a relier les fils telegraphiques de la ligne directement aux appareils Russes a Mesched et a Nousretabad a ete deja obtenu en principe depuis un temps assez long.

Le moment de I’application de cette derni^re sur les lieux ddpendait necessairement de considerations techniques. A la conuaissance de la Legation Russe aucune protestation n’a ete soulevee contre le fait meme ni sur les lieux ni a Teheran, et ceci semblerait d’autant plus naturel que la suppression des abus et desordres signales sur la ligne Mesched-Seistan, et la regularisation du service teffigraphique, ne peuvent presenter que des avantages pour toutes les parties interessees. L’affirmation que toute la communication telegraphique entre Teheran et les provinces orientales de la Perse se trouverait sous le controle des employes Russes parait etre pour le raoins prematuree, non seulement en presence d’autres lignes teffigraphiques reliant Teheran aux provinces orientales, et au Seistan en particulier, mais aussi parce que le terme general “contrdle” ne saurait etre applique au service des employes Russes sur la ligne Mesched-Seistan, tant qu’il ne sera pas etabli que ce service est fait en dehors des r&amp;glements existants et des instructions de TAdministra- tion superieure Persane, ou bien au detriment d’interets quelconques.

IN my telegrams No. 225, 226, and 227, I liad tlie honour to give yon a full account of the cession to the Russians of certain privileges on the Meshed-Seistan telegraph line and of the representations which were made to the Grand Vizier on the subject. I have little to add to the information contained in these telegrams, but I saw’ the Grand Vizier yesterday and taxed his Highness 'with having given further concessions to the Russians in respect of the Seistan end of the line, in accordance with informa tion I had received from His Majesty’s Consul at Seistan (see my telegram to you No. 240 of the 12th September). His Highness denied that he w r as in any way responsible for concessions beyond those which had been accorded under the Shah’s “ Dastkhatt,” which was in the form of a Minute on a note from the Russian Legation asking for the removal of the instruments at Meshed to the Russian office there. Nothing had been said in this note about the Seistan end of the line, and his Highness assured me that the orders which he had issued to the Minister of Telegraphs applied only to the Meshed end. He promised to make inquiries and to give strict orders to the Minister of Telegraphs that nothing must be conceded to the Russians beyond vffiat they had asked for in their note and beyond what the Shah had approved in his Minute. I myself have not seen the Russian note, but the Grand Vizier’s son brought it to Mr. Ividston, who assures me that the Russian demands, as approved by the Shah, v’ere confined to the removal of the instruments at Meshed to their office. The Grand Vizier has promised to furnish me with a copy of the note and of the Shah’s “ Dastkhatt.” I have the honour to inclose a copy of the note which I addressed to the Grand \ izier on the receipt of the telegram from Seistan reporting that the Russians appeared to be tampering with that end of the line. With regard to our status on the Meshed-Tehran line, it w r as pointed out in my telegram No. 226 of the 30th ultimo, that neither end of the line w’as in our office. This statement was made on the authority of the Director of the Indo-European Telegraph Department (Persian Section), but he informs me, on further inquiry, that it must be modified. The wire, both at Meshed and in Tehran, passes first to our instruments, which are in rooms occupied by the officials of the Department, though situated in buildings belonging to the Persian Government.

I HAVE the honour to inform your Highness that I have just received a telegram from His Majesty’s Consul in Seistan stating that the Russian telegraphists there are now arranging for a separate room in the telegraph office instead of sharing a room in common with the Persian and English operators as heretofore. It is further rumoured that the batteries and instruments are to be moved into the Russian office and that the line will be led through it. I have already warned your Highness of the very serious view which His Majesty’s Government take of the concession already made to the Russians with regard [2173 a—1]to tlie Meshed end of the line, and I strongly urged that no further concessions should he made, especially in respect of the Seistan end. # nr • + +1 qu i I have been given to understand that the Rescript of His Majesty the Shah, m view o the existence of which your Highness maintained that you were powerless to resist the Russian demands, applied only to certain modifications in the arrangements, at Meshed and that nothing was said in the Russian note of any change at Seistan. It was, therefore, with great surprise that I heard that there was any mten ion of/ altering the statu, quo in Seistan, and I earnestly trust that your Highness will be able to send me an immediate reply in writing to the effect that there is no truth in the rumour. 1 trust also that your Highness will warn the responsible official^ who, if the report which has reached me is true, have doubtless acted without your H g ness authority, that there must be no further modifications in the status of the line save tifiosc already sanctioued at Me&amp;lied. &lt; . . -i • i xj- I cannot sufficiently impress on your Highness the serious view which His Majesty’s Government take of this question, and I have the honour to request that 1 may be favoured with an early reply, in order that I may reassure Sir E.

Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed me a Memorandum to-day setting forth point of view of Russian Government on the subject. Memorandum repeats formally arguments against immediate exchange of two lines, and proposes following com promise : io add a special wire on the Meshed-Seistan line, to be worked by English instruments, and to add similar wire on Tehran-Meshed line, to be worked by Russian instruments.

His Excellency leaves to-morrow, and will be absent for three weeks. He explained to me again that he had considerable resistance to^overcome on the geneial question of arrangement as to Persia, and he was anxious to avoid arousino - this resistance prematurely over what he still considers a point of detail. I made no remarks, as I thought it best not to prejudice any view you may take of his proposed compromise. He read me a telegram from Russian Ambassador in London, reporting a conversation with Sir C. Hardinge and the remarks made by latter, which were identical with terms of your telegram No. 381, and^ which I had already communicated to him. He wished, he said, to point out that his views were merely personal, and. that he was in principle in favour of our proposed scheme. I told him that I had carefully explained that he had given me his personal views, and that they were not to be taken as a formal expression of views of Russian Government. ^ v 20—50][31322] No. 1.

AFTER that we had terminated our conversation in regard to the negotiations respecting a German advance and loan to the Persian Government, M. Isvolsky said that there was another matter on which he desired to speak to me. He then read to me a telegram which he had received from Count Benckendorff, reporting a conversation which his Excellency had had with Sir C. Hardinge, and in which the latter had expressed some surprise that the Russian Government had sanctioned the transfer to Russian authorities of the control over the Meshed-Seistan telegraph line, as this manifestly was a disturbance of the status quo, and would call for a demand by His Majesty’s Government for a counter-concession. (E may not have quite accurately recorded the exact words of the telegram, as it was read to me a little hurriedly.) M. Isvolsky added that Count Benckendorff had been told that I should be instructed to speak to him on the subject. His Excellency said that he wished to anticipate what I might have to say to him by assuring me that the telegram from Count Benckendorff was the first intimation he had received of any project concerning the Meshed-Seistan line. He had inquired in his Department what had occurred, and he was informed that M. Hartwig had recently sent a despatch concerning the substitution of some Persian telegraphic apparatus by a more improved Russian apparatus ; but that as the question was merely a minor technical matter, it had not been considered necessary to submit it to him. His Excellency said that he had not fully understood the technical details, which were accompanied with drawings, but that he had requested further information to be supplied to him, and he had also given instructions that all matters, however trivial, concerning Persia should be submitted to him. He asked what information and instructions I had received. I told his Excellency that Sir C. Hardinge, in a letter which I had received this morning, had informed me of the conversation which he had held with Count Benckendorff, and that I was expecting a telegram, on which I intended to speak to him. I did not mention the instructions which had been conveyed in your telegram. No. 274, as I was not sure that they constituted final instructions, and, moreover, the explanations offered by M. Isvolsky somewhat altered the case. I further told M. Isvolsky that, according to my information, and which was the same as that received by my Government, a concession had been given, or was about to be given, to the Russian authorities to take over the whole control of the Meshed— Seistan telegraph line, and that this had naturally caused surprise, as it would constitute a disturbance of the status quo. His Excellency replied that he was the last man to entertain any idea of making a change in the status quo, and that he had never heard of any project such as I had mentioned. I told him that I would telegraph to you the explanations which he had been good enough to give me, and that when I had received a reply I would come and see him on the subject. M. Isvolsky begged that I would do so, and in the meantime he would collect what information he could on the subject, and we could then discuss the question. I am convinced that M. Isvolsky was speaking in all sincerity ; and as he asserts that he desires to do nothing which would affect the status quo in Persia, I would suggest that I should request him to send instructions to the Russian Minister at Tehran to abandon any idea, should he have conceived one, of obtaining control over the Meshed-Seistan telegraph.

Sir:- I called on Monsieur Isvolsky this afternoon, and said tnat I should be glad to renew my conversa tion with him in regard to the Meshed-Seistan line. His Excellency informed me that since our last conversation he had received a memorandum drawn up in nis Department on the subject, and he would like to read it to me: - The memorandum which was not a lengthy document, \ gave a sketch of the history of the line, and stated tnat recently it had been found that much delay and inconvenience were caused by the wire being attached to the Persian instruments, and that at the request of the Persian authorities it had been arranged that tne wire should be placed on to the Russian instru ments, as was the case with the Teheran-Meshed line where tne wire was on British instruments, The mem- % orandum Grey, Bart. M.P. &amp;c. • *memorandum further stated that there were a few Rus sian technical officials on the line see tliat it was kept in proper working order. His Excellency said that I would see that no change had been made, beyond a mere technical detail for the purpose of improving the service; and that the Department had considered the matter to be of so little moment that the question had not even been submitted to him. I asked His Excellency to permit me to make a few observations on the subject, as I thought I could show him that the matter was not so innocent and simple as might appear on the surface. In the first place, I thought that the memorandum was in error in supposing that the Teheran-Meshed line was under the control of the British Telegraph Office. I remembered that when I was at Teheran, the Teheran- Meshed line worked most unsatisfactorily; telegraph posts were continually being knocked down and wires broken, and as there was considerable traffic over it, owing to the Afghan delimitation commission, the delays and interruptions were most inconvenient. Atmy request tne Persian Government permitted the olfi- cials of the Indian Telegraph Office at Teheran to keep the line in good order, and this we did at our expense. I believed that now the custom was to allot a subsidy of some 40,000 francs to the Persian Gov ernment to keep the line in order, and all that we did was to request the Persian authorities to send orders to the Persian officials at the intermediate stations to repair damages. We ourselves had no officers on the line; and I doubted if the terminal lines were in our offices at Teheran. I was almost sure they were not. In regard lo tiie Meshed-Seistan line, I would observe that early in June the battery and wire of the line were moved from the Persian into the Russian office, but that by the end of June they were re transferred to the Persian office. Now we had re ceived information that under pressure from the Rus sian Minister, the battery and wire were again to be brought into the Russian office, and moreover that Monsieur Hartwig was requesting that the complete controlcontrol of the line was to he handed over to the Russian authorities. His Excellency interrupted me hy saying that there was not a word in the memorandum as to any in tention of obtaining control over the line, and he did not really see what importance could be attached to placing the terminal line on to the Russian instru ment . J I replied that if no control had been requested and would not be requested, I would not press that point; but I pointed out that if the terminal lines were in the Russian office complete control would be held over all telegraphic communication between Teheran and the eastern portion of Persia; and this might prove a serious matter. What I wished to ask His Ex cellency was that matters should be replaced on the footing on which they were before June, certainly in regard to the location of the terminal lines. I did not want for the moment to discuss the presence of Russian telegraph officials on the line,that was a point to which I might have tb refer later; but I beggedbegged His Excellency to send orders at present to die Russian Legation in Teheran to allow the ter minal lines to remain in the Persian office. Monsieur Isvolsky confessed that he was really puzzled. He would tell me frankly that he had no otiier information on the subject than that which was contained in the memorandum which he had read to me, and beyond that paper he had not seen a document on the subject. He saw that it would be necessary for ■ him to read the whole dossier. He noticed that I al ways spoke of 'offices', and he would like to know whether the Persian and Russian offices at Meshed were separate, or whether, as he understood, the Rus sian and Persian batteries and instruments were in the same room. I told him that I had no information as to these points, but as all the reports which I had received spoke of offices, I imagined that they must oe separate rooms. This, hov/ever, was not of great moment. The question, to my mind, was that the Seistan telegraph line was to be under the control of HilKIRussian telegraphists, and that I earnestly trusted that he would send instructions which could enable matters to remain in the same condition as they were before June last. We could discuss the general ques tion of the Seistan line later. His Excellency said that he must first study all the papers, as my infor mation differed from that which was contained in the memorandum. He added that perhaps his Department had not given both sides of the question and he must look into the matter very carefully. He repeated his assurance that he had no desire to alter in any way the status quo, and that he wished to abide by the - country should take any steps pending a general agree- stance of what I have mentioned to His Excellency and will send it to him to-morrow. I did not allude to any compromise in the shape of giving the Russian authorities control over the Teheran-Me shed line in understanding between the two Governments that neither ment on Persia. I intend to consign in an Aide-memoire the sub- exchange for our exercising a similar control overtne Meshed-Seistan line, as I have some hopes, if matters have not gone too far at Meshed, to induce Monsieur Isvolsky to despatch the Instructions which I have suggested. If I find that I cannot obtain this, I will then discuss with His Excellency the alternative proposed by the Government of India. I have, &amp;c.. (Signed) A.

Connection is given to Persian offices during certain fixed hours, and through them to Russians, who have separate room and instruments of their own in Tehran. Line is maintained at British expense, with a small contribution from Persian Government, and maintenance is under British, for which purpose there is permanent establishment of Gholams. These technical questions, however, do not affect main issue, which is purely political. Control over Meshed-Tehran line is of no political significance, and we have no employes at intermediate stations, whereas Russians have employes at many intermediate stations on Meshed-Seistan line, control over which, from its geographical position, is of great political and strategic importance. Instruments at Meshed have already been moved into Russian office.

He read to me a Memorandum prepared in his Department on the question, which made out that all that had taken place was connection of wire on to the Russian instruments in order to insure rapidity and correctness of transmission of messages, and that this was merely following example of Tehran-Meshed line. I explained to his Excellency that the matter was not a mere technical improve ment, and that Memorandum was in error as to line adopted in Tehran-Meshed line.

Object of His Majesty’s Government is to maintain status quo pending future negotiations with Russia as to whole Persian question. _ I would, therefore, strongly deprecate any idea of regarding situation either wit panic or as occasion to be used aggressively for securing political advantages. Similar considerations apply to question of possible joint Anglo-Russian loan. See my telegram of 11th instant reporting instructions sent to Grant Duff. It must be obvious that in present state of discussions with Russia, should Persian financial embarrassment render loan unavoidable, His Majesty’s Government can have no intention whatever of making such a joint loan the occasion for attempting to obtain political concessions as against Russia.Sir A.

You should take an early opportunity of pointing out to M. Isvolsky that if the news of the transfer of the Meshed-Seistan telegraph line to Russian control is confirmed, an important modification of the status quo which we have been so careful to maintain recently in Persia will have been created. We can hardly believe that such a step can have received his authorization, but, if so, it will become necessary to consider what counter-concession we may be compelled to demand. The Meshed-Seistan line runs so close to the frontier of Afghanistan that a change in its control will require some step on the part of His Majesty’s Government to secure their interests, unless the matter can be adjusted by discussion with the Russian Government; in this connection I would draw your attention to suggestion 3 in Viceroy’s telegram of 3rd September, which seems a possible solution.FOREIGN SECRET TELEGRAMS. Secret Department. From Viceroy, 3rd September 1906. {Repeated to Tehran.) Foreign Secret. Grant Duff’s telegrams Nos. 324 and 328, dated 29th August and 30th August. We trust every possible endeavour will be made to prevent final grant to Russia of concession, which would be opposed to repeated assurances of Persian Government, and might affect our security for Persian loans of 1903 and 1904 which in second case are secured on Persian posts and telegraphs. Russian possession of lines with consequent increase of Russian telegraphic officials in East Persia would be immediately detrimental to British interests there, and wild nature of country would form excuse for construction of road and posting of Russian guards which, as line flanks undemarcated section of Afghan frontier, would be open to special objection, and in view of our obligations in connection with that frontier and our interests in Seistan might involve us in costly measures of protection. Kennion’s telegrams Nos. 187 and 193, dated 29th July and 8th August, to Grant Duff, show that Persian Cossacks instead of goint? to Seistan have under de facto control of Russian officers been stationed along whole Persian-Afghan frontier as far south as Barabad; and not being wanted for quarantine purposes seem intended to be permanent. Existence of these posts has led to strengthening of Afghan posts and some excitement locally. We suggest adoption of one of the three following courses. First, that Persia and Russia may be urged to maintain status quo ante Turbat-i-Haidari {sic) Russian cordon. In this connection we are about to address His Majesty’s Government with a view to acceptance by Britain and Russia of self-denying ordinance which would stop perpetual consular rivalry in these regions. since it has been recognised throughout discussions on our respective spheres in Persia that active Russian influence should not extend south of line from Khanikin to Kain, we recommend, if Persia must give over control of this line to foreign Power, division of control of telegraph at northern border of Kain, whole of the portion north going to Russia and south to Britain. Third, if Russia consents to neither of above we might ask Persia to transfer to Russia control of whole line from Meshed to Tehran in exchange for control by us of whole of Meshed-Seistan line. Line from Meshed to Tehran is Persian line worked by Indo-European Telegraph Department for sum of Rs. 20,000 annually. Third course would apparently meet all M. Hartwig’s objections and furnish Russia with telegraphic connection between Meshed and Tehran entirely under her control. It would also get rid of one perpetual source of worry on Persian-Afghan frontier. We earnestly hope that in any event even temporary Russian control of Southern part of Meshed- Seistan line may be averted, as it would probably have most injurious effect on Afghans and would seriously diminish value as far as India is concerned of any entente with Russia.OONEIDENTIAL. v Mr. Grant Duff to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received September 1, 6*45 P.M.)

Grand Vizier yesterday admitted to me that orders had been given to transfer instruments at Meshed from the Persian to the Rmssian office, but denied that there was any intention of making further concessions. I pointed out to His Highness that His Majesty’s Government would view with surprise and regret fact that his first act as Grand Vizier had been to hand over to Russian control a line [?] conducting down to our Indian frontier, and said that we should most certainly demand a quid pro quo, and that it would probably be a large one. Bis Highness was evidently much concerned at this view of the matter, and protested that Shah’s signature had been given long before he had become Grand Vizier. Subsequently he sent his son to me with the original Russian note and the Shah’s Minute in order to prove that the matter had been arranged before his access to power. I promised to tell you this, hut pointed out that it in no way affected actual position. I took the opportunity to explain to the Grand Vizier’s son, with the aid of a map, that the control over the line would enable Russians to place a whole string of agents along Afghan border right down to our Indian frontier. I also showed that, in the event of trouble between Persia and Afghanistan, Persians had by their own act put it in the power of the Russians to cut off at will all telegraphic communication between Tehran and whole eastern frontier of Persia. This was the one line of all others that the Persians ought never to have let out of their hands. The only remedy, I said, was the linking up of Seistan with the Central Persian system, or, in other words, concession of Kuh-Malik-Siah extension. He seemed impressed with this argument. I finally urged him not to make any further concessions to the Russians on the line, and, above all, not to let Seistan end pass out of their hands. I think that Grand Vizier is thoroughly alarmed, and if His Majesty’s Govern ment will impress on Persian Legation that they regard matter very seriously, I believe that we might now press for the Kuh—Malik—Siah extension with fair hope of success. I have, of course, not indicated that His Majesty’s Government would consider extension alone to be adequate compensation.

Mr. Grant Duff to Sir Edward Grey .— (Received August 30, 6 P.M.; (No. 226. Secret.) Tehran, August 30, 1906, 2’38 p.m. MY telegram No. 225 : Meslxed-Seistan line. Persian Ministry of Telegraphs has been instructed by Foreign Office to hand over control of line to the Russians, but Minister of Telegraphs professes himself unwilling to do so, and has sent secretly to the Director of the Indo-European Telegraph^ Depart ment begging him to secure intervention of His Majesty’s Government, and saying that he will suspend action on his orders for two days. He says he wishes to keep control in Persian hands, but would, in the last resort, prefer British control to Russian. Russians represent that they only want such control as we exercise on Meshed- Tehran line, and if their influence could be confined to that probably no great harm would be done, but they already claim that the terminal posts must be in their offices. This is not the case with the Meshed-Tehran line, and we also have no employes at intermediate stations, while Russians have signallers at several points on Meshed- Seistan line. I understand that our control merely consists in sending orders to the Persian officials at intermediate stations through Persian office, and complaining to Persian Administration if they are not carried out. I shall endeavour to secure postponement of execution of cession, but failing this I propose to inform Grand Vizier that we shall expect to share on the Meshed-Seistan line in equal measure with the Russians any privileges granted to them there in excess of those granted to us on the Meshed—Tehran line.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 31 of the 2nd February last, I have the honour to report that the Mushir-ed-Dowleh confidentially informed me that the Russian Minister was pressing the Persian Government very hard to give the Russian Government complete control of the Meshed-Seistan telegraph line. M. Hartwig argued that most of the principal telegraph lines in Persia were in British hands, and it was only fair that Russia should have her share. I pointed out to his Excellency that Russia already controlled five telegraph lines in Khorassan, viz., Astrahad to Chikishlar, Astrabad to Gunbad Kaboos, Meshed to Askhabad, Meshed to Sarakhs, and Meshed to Artek, and that His Majesty’s Govern ment claimed the right to post signallers on the Meshed-Seistan line identical in number with those employed by Russia. His Excellency replied that he was quite aware that what I said was correct, hut the Persian Government were in a very difficult position. . They were still, however, resisting the Russian demands to the best of their ability. As I have already had the honour to report, it appears certain that the Russian Government has for some time practically controlled the Meshed-Seistan line, and the efforts of the Persian Government to oust the Russian signallers will probably fail.

I have the honour to inclose correspondence on the subject with the Mushir-ed- Dowleh. His Excellency informed me verbally that if the negotiations now in progress for the withdrawal of the Russian signallers proved successful, the Persian Government would expect His Majesty’s Government to remove any British signallers working on the line. I confined myself to stating that I would report what his Excellency had said to you. and to reminding him that on the 19th November, 1904, I had, by Lord Lansdowne’s instructions, addressed a note to the Persian Government, stating that, if the Russian signallers were allowed on the line, His Majesty’s Government would demand an equal number of British signallers. 1 notice that in the Mushir-ed- Dowleh’s communication of the 16th Eebruary, translation of which is inclosed, no mention is made of any condition.

February 19 ) (No. 34.) T tja-^u Tehran, February 2, 1906. I DAVE the honour to transmit copy of two despatches from His Majesty’s Consul m keis an, trom which it would appear certain that the Russian Government has practicahy obtained control of the Meshed—Seistan telegraph line. Since the return of the Shah from Europe in October last, l have made repeated efforts to discover from the Persian Government whether the Grand Vizier when at St. Peteisbuigh demanded the withdrawal of the Russian telegraphists posted on the me. I have always been met by the answer that negotiations tor their recall were still in progress and likely to result in a manner satisfactory to the Persian Government. Knowing the Persian character as I do, I think it most improbable that in the midst of t e brilliant festivities at Peterhof the Grand A izier, and still less the Shah, would have raised a question which they well knew was displeasing to the Russian Government. From Inclosure 2 in Sir Arthur Hardinge s despatch to Lord Lansdowne No. 200 of the 9th September, 1905, you will see that His Highness was duly reminded of the matter. In the India Office letter of the 23rd June, 1905, the dispatch of two British signallers destined for Turbat-i-Haideri and Birjand was announced. On hearing of their arrival at Nasratabad, I wrote to the Minister of Telegraphs requesting him to give orders for their admission in the offices at their respective stations. After some delay his Excellency referred me to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, to whom I wrote making the same request. I have as yet received no written reply ; but as I had the honour to report in my telegram No. 33 of the 31st ultimo the Mushir-ed-Dowleh has proposed to allow the two signallers to be posted at Turbat-i-Birjand, provided that His Majesty’s Government undertake to withdraw' them should the Russian Government withdraw' their telegraphists on the Meshed-Seistan line. This Concession the Mushir-ed- Dowleh stated the Persian Government had decided to refuse, on the ground that negotiations with the Russian Government for the withdrawal of their employes were still in progress. But if His Majesty’s Government would permit the Urmi Mollah to return home it would be granted. I pointed out to his Excellency that he had himself admitted to Sir Arthur Hardinge that whatever privileges were given on the Meshed- Seistan line to Russian signallers would also be given to an equal number of British signallers. I drew his attention to the fact that in the autumn of 1904 I had, by the instructions of Lord Lansdowne, formally claimed the right of His Majesty’s Govern- mont to post signallers on the line identical in number with the Russian employes. His Excellency, in reply, again stated that the Russian signallers were only temporarily on the line and would, he hoped, be shortly withdrawn. It is, I think, unlikely that the Russian Government will in this respect meet the views of the Persian Government. Although the rights of His Majesty’s Government are quite clear the Persian Government will, I am convinced, place every obstacle in our way, and to save time I ventured to recommend that the Mushir’s proposal be accepted. This will not in any way compromise the right already claimed and may make it easier to post other signallers, should this hereafter be considered desirable. The Urmi Mollah is old and in bad health. Mr. AVratiskw thinks that he has had a lesson, and will certainly help to keep the turbulent elements at Urmi quiet. If His Majesty’s Government permit his return, the Shah and the Valiahd, who are very keen to get him away from Tabreez, will be pleased. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh informed me last week that the Shah had decided to refuse the Nasratabad-Kuh-i-Malik-Siah extension. His Majesty’s chief reason, which seems a frivolous one, was that we already had a telegraph line (the Central Persian) to the Beluchistan frontier. I told his Excellency that 1 thought His Majesty’s refusal of what was a very small concession, would give considerable offence to His Majesty’s Govern ment, who were well aware of the telegraph concession made to Russia in the north. I took a map with me to his Excellency last Wednesday and explained carefully the reasons why His Majesty’s Government desires the ,Kuh-i-Malik-Siah extension. [1845 19JHe promised to show the map to the Shah and make a farther attempt to change His Majesty’s mind. . i ± ^ In these circumstances, a concession bj His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Mollah may, at this moment, influence His Majesty’s decision; I mav add that I have called the Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s attention to the mclosures m Captain Macpherson’s despatch No. 11 of the 12th December, 1905, and his Hxcellency has promised to inquire into the matter. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) EVELYN GRANT DUEE. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul Macpherson to Mr. E. Grant Duff. (No. 11.) gj r Seistan, December 12, 1905. I HAVE the honour to transmit, for your information, with reference to corre spondence ending with your telegram No. &lt;0, dated the 9th December, 1905, icgaiding the control of the Meshed—Seistan line by the Russians (1.) A copy, with translation, of a telegram from Kniaz Vavchadze from Kuchan to all Persian telegraphists on the line, ordering them to assist the Russian constructors to repair it. (2.) An original letter, with translation, signed by Tukhoreli, the Russian Inspector at Shusp, to the Persian telegraph-master at Bandan, threatening to dismiss certain Persian ghulams if the orders communicated to them in his letter were not complied with. (3.) A copy of a telegram, with translation, from the Russian Inspector at Shusp, to the Mechanic Tersimionantz, informing him that he had received instructions from Tiflis to assist him in the line repair work. 2. I would also invite attention to the entries in my diary, of which copies (Inclosures Nos. 5 and 6) are attached herewith for ready reference. 3. It should be noted, in connection with the above, that the orders for the repairing of the line originally issued from the Ministry of Telegraphs through the Kniaz Yavchadze, who, according to the recent admissions of the Persian Government, vide your telegram No. 61 of the 17th October, was dismissed from its service over two years ago. It follows therefore that either the statement of the Persian Government is inaccurate, and that Kniaz YTivchadze is still in its employ, or that the control of the line has now been definitely handed over to the Russians. There seems to be little doubt that the latter is the correct solution. Copies of this letter are being forwarded to the Government of India and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorassan. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. D. MACPHERSON, Captain, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Kniaz Vavchadze to all Telegraph-Masters on Seistan Line. (Translation.)

(After compliments.) _ [Undated.] TW 0 months ago 1 ordered Hussein Ali Khan (Telegraph-master, Shusp) to telegraph (to all stations) from Sehdeh to Seistan and inform the ghulams that they should inspect the line once a month, and wherever a post Lad fallen to set it right.^ow, it is intimated that eig’ht posts between Banda,n and Lab-i-Bairing have fallen, and no one has seen to repairing them ; therefore, immediately on receipt of this, send both ghulams fioni Bandan to Lab-i-Bairing to set right the nosts which have fallen, and, after their return, send Mahomed Ah to inspect the line from Bandan to Ahabad, to repair it wherever there may be any defect. If any delay occurs, I will dismiss both ghulams. Indeed, a ghulam should g'o along the line once a month Both the ghulams should now take one horse between them, although the custom is that each ghulam should keep one horse. For the present one horse will do for both ghulams. If, when I come to Seistan, the horse is not present, I shall expel both ghulams. WFenevei a Grovernment nazir comes from Seistan along the line repairin°* materials should be kept ready, so that he should not be delayed. In closure 4 in No. 1. M. Tukhoreli to M. Tersimionantz. (Translation.) (Telegraphic.) Shusp [undated]. A TltLEiGKAM has been received from Tiflis that I may also come for constructing the line and work from Sehdeh to Seistan. You should also come with me to Seistan, and on arrival at Birjand make ready quickly one ladder and two tents. Inclosure 5 in No. L. Extract from Seistan Diary for November 21, 1905. WITH reference to diary entry for the 6th November, Fazl Rahman has sent me information that Tukhoreli, the Russian Inspector at Shusp, received 440 tomans from the Khabir-us-Sultaneh at Meshed for line-repair expenses. Mr. Howson reports from Birjand that the Resi of Telegraphs there had informed him that Kniaz Yavchadze had wired to him that Russian constructors would shortly be coming to repair the line, and that he should send his ghulams to co-operate. A similar telegram had been sent by the Kniaz to all telegraph-masters on the line. The Khabir-us-Sultaneh had also sent him orders to assist the Russian constructors. In reply to a direct question from Mr. Howson, the Reis stated that the Persian ghulams were certainly under the orders of the Russian staff, who exercised the same control over the Meshed-Seistan line as the British did over the Tehran-Meshed line. It is difficult in the face of the above to see how the Persian Government can contrive to deny that the Russians do not exercise effective control of the line. Inclosure 6 in No. 1. Extract from Seistan Diary for November 30, 1905. WITH reference to diary entry (2) for the 21st November, Tukhoreli has admitted to Mr. Howson that the Persian Government were paying the cost of the repairs to the line, which he estimated would amount to 400 tomans, but he did not know whether his own (the Russian) Government would subsequently reimburse this amount or not. He further informed Mr. Howson that he had received his orders to undertake the work from the Mukhbir-ud-T)owleh in Tehran. Inclosure 7 in No. 1. Consul Macpherson to Mr. E. Grant Duff. (No. 12. Confidential.) Sir, Scistan, December 24, 1905. ] HAYE the honour to report, with reference to my telegram No. 37 of the 23rd December, and in continuation of my letter of the 11th December, that the4 Persian Postmaster at Jfeii has shown me the original postal receipts of the 440 tomans paid to Tukhoreli, the Russian Telegraph Inspector at Shusp, from which it is clear that this money was received by him from the Russian Consulate-General at Meshed, and not, as previously stated, from the Khabir-us-Sultaneh. Copies of the receipts have been taken and can be forwarded if necessary. The Postmaster further stated that when he first paid over the money to the Russian Inspector the latter did not know for what object it had been sent, but , that some five days subsequently he received letters from the Khabir-us-Sultaneh and ^ the Kniaz Yavchadze, when he immediately gave out the money was for the repair of the line. The above fact, coupled with the general information given in my previous letter, would appear to offer almost conclusive proof that the control of the line has, in spite of assurances to His Majesty’s Legation to the contrary, been definitely handed over to the Russians. Copies of this letter are being forwarded to the Government of India and His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. D.

I mentioned this to my Russian colleague to-day. He seemed to think that his Government might raise objections, though I fail to see on what grounds, as Seistan is in the British sphere. I should be glad of your early instructions, as the present Persian good-will might evaporate if we do not strike while the iron is hot. (Addressed to Foreign Office ; sent to India.) [282—45]Copy of a letter No.814,dated 31st October 1912,from the Director- in Chief, Indo-European Telegraph Department to the Director, Persian Section, Teheran. With reference to your letter No.729,dated 14th October 1912, I have the honour to state that the question of the construction of a telegraph line between Kuh-i-Malik Siah and Seistan is one that you should refer to the British Minister at Teheran, and obtain from him instructions as to how you should act. If the case can, subject to the Minister's instructions, be dealt with as a purely telegraph matter between the Persian Minister of Telegraphs and yourself, it will possibly be more easy to arrive at some settlement of it with the Persian authorities. Telegrams No.91 dated 8th April 1910 and No.80,dated 6th July 1907 which were addressed to the British Minister by the Foreign Office give the conditions on which at that time this Department was to be permitted to construct the pro- posed line. When Major O'Connor, the Consul for Seistan, was at home lately on leave he assured me the route along the border of Afghanistan would be as safe a one for the line to follow as a route more in the interior of Persia. If this frontier route is followed the line might be carried down to the Robat telegraph office and then back to the Persian telegraph office at Kuh-i-Malik Siah. This would allow of the proper control and testing of the proposed line and the Persian office could be joined over to the Seistan office at Robat as required. The Government of India do not v/ish the arrangement to be made that the traffic ofthe line should he carried over this Department’s wires for communication with India, as it would then have to he dealt with under the Cis-Indian Joint Purse Agree ment, and there would he difficulties in establishing local rates for the traffic. However it is for you to obtain instructions from the British Minister how you should move in the case, and you should keep me informed how the case proceeds. It may still 'be considered undesirable to move in the matter until the Seistan-Khaf line has been transferred to British control. i // (No. 384.) Sir Edward Grey to Sir W. Townley (Tehran).

(No. 501.) gi rj St. Petersburgh, September 14, 1909. I HAD the honour to forward by post a copy of the aide-memoire which I received from M. Sazonow to-day in regard to the Eussian authorities undertaking repairs on the Meshed-Nasratabad telegraph line. The intention of the Eussian Government to execute these repairs is it is true not in accordance with the assurance given in the aide-memoire of the 5th March, 1908, “ Qu’aucune reparation ne sera faite par les employes russes sur la section Khaf-Seistan ” : but according to the information which they have received the execution of repairs is urgently required if a breakdown of telegraphic communication is to be avoided. Moreover the Eussian Government in 1908 expressed their readiness to agree to any measures which His .Majesty’s Govern ment might propose with a view of maintaining the telegraph line in proper working order, and I am unable to discover that any proposals were put forward in response to this suggestion. As more than a year has elapsed since this offer was made on the part of the Eussian Government, it would be difficult, it seems to me, for us to object to the necessary repairs being executed by the Eussian Government, especially as I presume our officers are maintaining the Tehran—Meshed line in an efficient condition. I made no remarks when M. Sazonow handed me the aide-memoire, beyond an observation that I personally much regretted that it was considered that the opportune moment had not yet arrived for effecting the exchange of the two _ telegraph lines. M. Sazonow enquired whether the two administrations could not of their own initiative effect the exchange, and thus present the Persian Government with an accomplished fact. I replied that this course could hardly be followed. The lines were not the property either of the British or of the Eussian Government, and all that the two Governments were entitled to do, unless I was mistaken, was to maintain t e up mep o the line; and even their right to do this much was, so far as I was aware, not acknow ledged and embodied in any formal agreement with the Persian Government. 1 related to bis Excellency the origin of our control over the Meshed line, as it had been initiated during the time I was charge d’affaires at Tehran, and I expressed my belief that the right of the Eussian Government to supervise the Seistan lines was n ot more precise and definite than was ours. We would, therefore, have to approach the _Persian Govern ment on the subject, and, so far as I recollected, it had been the opinion of oui two legations that the question could be more conveniently and more innocently broached by the two telegraph administrations than by the official representatives of the two Governments.

If there is no great objection to the fact that the Russian signa,13.ers might use a recording instrument for this improper purpose, then it is unnecessary to refer to the pattern of instrument, which is to replace the faulty one. Should the possible employment of a recording instrument for such a purpose be considered undesirable, the reply on this point might simply be that there was no objection to the faulty instrument being replaced by an efficient one of the same pattern. We should then learn if a recorder was to be used, and should this be the intention we could suggest, if thought desirable, that the recording portion should be removed as unnecessary and to prevent any improper use of it by the signallers of the three different nationalities. c c \ -V ' i C) 1N h' ^ ..;vo&lt;4 n fIn any further communica tion on this subject, please quote no . 34768 / 09 . and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

Foreign Office, Sir, 30tli January 1909. I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, in which you forward a despatch from the Government of India respecting the financial arrangements involved in the proposed transfer of the Tehran-Meshed and Khaf- Nasratabad telegraph lines. Sir E. Grey observes that, provided the exchange is effected in accordance with the proposals of His Majesty’s Government, it is estimated that, apart from any initial outlay, the annual cost of main taining six offices and keeping the line in repair from Ediaf to Nasratabad (350 miles) will amount to 3,100Z. as against a maximum charge of 1,2&gt;331. a year for the maintenance of two terminal offices and the upkeep of the line from Tehran to Meshed (570 miles); and the hope is expressed in your letter that the sanction of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury may be obtained to an arrangement whereby, in future, any expenditure, for purely political purposes, on telegraph establish ments, &amp;c., in Persia, over and above a sum of 1,333Z., to be borne, as hitherto, by India alone, should be equally divided between the British and Indian Exchequers, in the same manner as all other expenditure in Persia of a political character. I am to state, in reply, that in view of the adverse decision of the Lords Commissioners in 1891, to which you allude, and of their Lord- ships’ recent expressions of opinion as to the curtailment of expenditure in Persia, Sir E. Grey does not consider the moment opportune to make an application on the subject; that he would suggest the advisability of postponing further consideration of the matter until the exchange of lines has actually been effected ; that the Persian Government might then be invited to contribute, as he understands is the case with regard to the Tehran-Meshed line, towards the cost of maintenance; that if no such contribution proves to be forthcoming the Lords Commissioners might then be approached with a view to the additional cost, involved by the transfer of the lines, being borne by the British and Indian Exchequers in the proportion of five to twelve, on the analogy of the distribution of the total cost prior to 1891. With regard to the final paragraph of your letter under reply, I am to state that, in view of the information contained in Sir A. Nicolson’s telegram No. 32, of the 26th instant (of which a copy has already been furnished to your Department), Sir E. Grey considers that the recom mendations of the Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European lelegiaph Department in regard to the working of the line may be adopted. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State Louis Mallet. for India. , Enclosure No. 2. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, gir 12th May 1909. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1163, dated the 30th January last, as to the financial arrangements involved m the proposed transfer of the Tehran-Meshed and the Khaf-Nasratabad telegraph lines.In reply I am to say tliat Viscount Morley appreciates the difficulty felt by Secretary Sir E. Grey in approaching the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury at the present stage, when the result of the negotiations is not certain, and when no definite estimate of the expen diture involved can he formed. At the same time, Lord Morley sees no reason why, in the case of any increase of charge consequent on the transfer, the principle of equal division between the two exchequers which has prevailed since the Welby Commission should be departed from, and he would be unwilling to sanction any expenditure from Indian revenues on the administration of the lines after the transfer, except on this condition. I am, therefore, to express the hope that Sir E. Grey will see fit to submit the matter to the Lords Commissioners with a view to the recognition of the principle of division laid down in my letter of the 6th January last. It seems possible that, if the matter is not sub mitted to the Treasury till after the negotiations for the transfer are concluded, the Lords Commissioners may take exception, on the ground that they were not consulted at an earlier stage. With regard to the reference made in your letter to the decision of the Lords Commissioners in 1891, I am to point out that it is not proposed that any expenditure which the Lords Commissioners refused to share then should now be shared by them, and, further that the decision in question was due to a difference of opinion prevailing at that time regarding the incidence of expenditure in Persia generally, a matter which is now governed by the Report of the Royal Commission. V\ ith reference to your letter of 12th May, relative to the financial arrangements involved in the proposed transfer of the Tehran-Meshed and Khaf-Nasratabad telegraph lines, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith copy of a letter which, in accordance with the wish expressed by you, he caused to be addressed to the Treasury, proposing that any increase of charge consequent on this transaction beyond a sum of twenty thousand rupees a year to be borne, as hitherto, by Indian revenues alone, should be equally divided between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers. .1 an j, a ^ s0 to transmit copy of the reply returned to this communi cation^ from which Viscount Morley will perceive that the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury sanction the proposal in principle pending the conclusion of such an agreement with Persia as wiff enable definite financial proposals to be made.

The India Office propose that any increase of charge consequent on the transfer over and above a sum of 20,000 rupees per annum, to be borne, as hitherto, by India alone, should be equally divided between the Imperial and Indian exchequers in the same manner as all other expenditure in Persia of a political character. I am to explain that on the ocaasion of the signature of the Anglo- Russian Agreement of 1907 as to Persia, the British and Russian Governments also concluded a separate arrangement providing in substance for the handing over, subject to the approval of the Persian Government, of the telegraph line from Tehran to Meshed from British to Russian Administration, in exchange for the transfer of the Khaf- Nasratabad telegraph line from Russian to British Administration. Copies of this arrangement, as well as of the Anglo-Russian Agree ment itself, are enclosed for the Lords Commissioners’ information. A perusal of these two documents will show clearly that the proposed exchange of telegraph lines, though not mentioned in the principal agreement for reasons of diplomatic propriety, constitutes in reality a considerable item among the questions in regard to which a settlement was then effected with Russia ; and efforts have been made by both parties ever since the conclusion of the arrangement to carry out this provision. For various reasons, among which maybe cited the disturbed state of Persia, the proposed transfer has not yet been carried out, but it is possible that now that the situation has improved the settlement of this matter may proceed with more expedition. Sir E. Grey concurs in the view that it would be fair to divide the contemplated expenditure between the two exchequers, and he trusts that, in view of the importance of the matter, not only to India, but to the rest of Empire, the whole of which should benefit by the settlement of this troublesome question between this country and Russia, the Lords Commissioners will agree to the principle of division as suggested by the India Office pending the conclusion of such an agreement with Persia as will enable definite financial proposals to be made. I am to invite their Lordship’s attention to the observations contained in the last paragraph of the India Office letter of the 12th instant. With regard to the incidence of the possible charge to Imperial revenues it may be observed that the cost of maintaining a telegraph line would not in any case fall on the Diplomatic and Consular Vote, and that a decision will be necessary as to the manner of meeting the expenditure. I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury Mr. Mallet’s letter of tlm 26th May last (No. 18,119), and the enclosed copy of correspondence with the India Office, in regard to the financial arrengements involved in the proposed transfer of the Tehran- Meshed and Khaf-Nasratabad telegraph lines.

Report on the Condition of the Telegraph Line from Nasratabad to Bandan (February 15 to 26, 1909). AS the physical features of the country through which the line passes are very different, I have divided the line into two sections, viz., (1) Nasratabad Lab-i-Ba g (2) Lab-i-Baring-Bandan. . the line crosses 2. Section 1. («.) Alignment.—For the first 4 miles rrom me ° ^ F the “ put,' thence to Afzalabad, a distance of ? 2 miles, over inundated countiy. Afzalabad to Mil-i-Baring across the naizai. [2266 k-The alignment from the city to Afzalabad is faulty, as during the winter season that portion running across the inundated country is maintained with great difficulty, if at all. At the time of my inspection there were three posts heeling over so much that their tops were barely a foot above the water, and but for the support given by the wire itself, would undoubtedly have fallen. I brought this to the notice of the^ Ghulam Bashi at Bandan, but he informed nm that owing to the depth of water nothing V could be done at present. Two important points seem to have been overlooked in the construction of this section, viz., facility for inspection and repairs, and erecting posts in firm, solid ground. Wfien ground liable to inundation cannot be avoided, special measures to ensure liability should have been adopted. If the construction of the line from Robat is sanctioned, it would be advisable to divert the line from Afzalabad to the city slightly south to meet this line, and thence onward to the city on the same supports. The alignment across the “ naizar ” would appear the best that could be taken. If special measures, such as liberal cross-staying, bushing, planting the supports in barrels of stones, &amp;o., be adopted—as this part of the country is liable to inundation— there is every reason to hope that the line will remain stable. (b.) Posts .—Except for a couple of miles from the city, the posts on this section are in a bad condition, for besides the majority being below the standard dimensions (the diameter at the base being barely 4^ inches), and their bases ant-eaten, there are no less than 50 no higher than 8 feet. In a country like Persia, where the camel abounds, the lowest headway should not be less than 12 feet. In this connection I would draw attention to the following : the Ghulam Bashi informed me that recently an interruption occurred by a camel getting entangled in the line wire, and in trying to extricate itself pulled down two or three supports. (c.) Wire .—The common fault is “tying down.” This is due to two causes: firstly, when the wire was first erected the correct working strain was not given, as looking at it now it is much too tight; and, secondly, owing to the number of short posts, the tops do not follow even curves, that is, they suddenly rise and fall, this causes the wire to be tied down to the insulator on the low posts instead of the insulator supporting the wire. As undue strain is thus thrown on the insulators, they must crack or break, and, consequently, the insulation of the line, on which so much depends, is considerably reduced. (d.) Insulators .—Several cracked and broken. This fault I noticed frequently occurred at severe angles and where the wire was tied town (please see the preceding paragraph). 3. Section 2. (a.) Alignment .—From the Mil-i-Baring the line crosses the “ dasht ” to Bandan. This alignment is good. (Ik) Posts. There are as many as sixty short posts on this section. Other conditions are much the same as those described in 2 (6). (c.) Wire. —In the same condition as 2 (c). {d.) Insulators .—In the same condition as 2 (d.) 4. General. The Ghulam Bashi at Bandan informed me that no thorough repairs om 6 !

No Russian inspector or feub-Inspector accompanied the party. No poles have been changed since the line was originally constructed; those anu ea en a e ^se weie simply cut down and re-erected, hence the large number of short supports.

Sir Major Kennion in the Seistan diary of December 9th last reported that the annual repairs on the Khaf Seistan line which are usually effected in the autumn, were evidently not to be undertaken that year and that the line would conse quently be in thoroughly bad condition when handed over to us.

Drey, Bart.,1 A n I ?} ^ i ‘ The argvnents of the Foreign Office in favour of postponing consideration of the question of the incidenes of cost are not, I think, convincing. In another and recent case (that of the pay of the officers of the Ahwaz Oil guard) the Foreign Office stated their reluctance to approach the Treasury, hut yielded on pressure and the Treasury accepted the liability proposed* The decision of the Treasury in 1891 has little hearing on the point at issue, as in the fir'st place toe are not proposing that the expenditure which the Treasury refused to share then should now be shared by them, and, secondly, their deci si on, as pointed out in the note by this Department of the 13th November last, was due to a difference of opinion with this Office regarding the incidence of expend11urn in Persia Generally, a matter which has since been PL ** t, tL P-j 'p pop 1 4L. ■ }k -’ lo C-J.

So long as settlement remains jor-ce the Treasury cannot object to our as kina that any expenditure in Persia of a diplomatic nature upon which the Foreign Office and India Office are agreed shall he shared equally. In the present case the exchange of lines has been agreed upon 9 and the working arrangements to be adopted when the transfer is effected have also, I understand, been discussed and practically settled. I do net therefore see that anything is to be gained by postponing application to the Treasury for their formal consent to share the expenditure which the transfer will cause, less any part of it which the Persi an Go vermment may agree to bear. As r&amp;gards this point, I understand from Mr*Kirh that when the Khaf-Nasratabad section is working -under the new c ondi t i ons the Pe rs i an Go vemmen t may poss i bly be induced to make a. small contributi on towards the maintenance of the line (in addition to providing Persian signallers as at present), but this is nott o by any means certain, and amount of the contribution would probably be small. That which they make at present towards the maintenance of the Tehran-Meshed section (in addition to providing Persian signallers) is only 15,000 krccns a year, about &lt;£250 . I understand from MrJOirk that they do not at present make any contribution i n money towards the maintenance of the. Khaf - Nasratabad section.

Sir E.Grey observes that, provided the exchange is effected in accordance with the proposals of His Ma jesty's Government, it is estimated that, apart from any initial outlay, the annual cost of maintaining six Offices and keeping the line in repair from Khaf to Nasratabad (Three hundred and fifty miles) will 3,100. amount to Three thousand one hundred pounds as against 1,333. a maximum charge of One thousand three hundred and thirty-three pounds a year for the maintenance of two terminal Offices and the upkeep of the line from Teh- R \° Mesliea ( Five hundred and seventy miles); and the 10 1 FEB. 1909 INDIA OFFICf' be Under Secretary of State, ’ India Office. l( 1163 / 09 ) the hope Is expressed in your letter that the sanc tion of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury may he obtained to an arrangement whereby, in future, any expenditure, for purely political purposes, on tele graph establishments etc., in Persia, over and above a sum of One thousand three hundred and thirty-three pounds to be borne, as hitherto, by India alone, should be equally divided between the British and Indian Ex chequers, in the same manner as all other expenditure in Persia of a political character. I am to state, in reply, that in view of the ad verse decision of the Lords Commissioners in 1891, to which you allude, and of Their Lordships* recent ex pressions of opinion as to the curtailment of expendi ture in Persia, Sir E.Grey does not consider the moment opportune to make an application on the subject; that he would suggest the advisability of postponing further consideration of the matter until the exchange of lines has actually been effected; that the Persian Government might then be invited to contribute, as he understands is( 1163 / 09 ) is the case with regard to the Tehran-Meshed line,to- wards the cost of maintenance; that if no such con tribution proves to be forthcoming the Lords Commis sioners might then be approached with a view to the ad ditional cost, involved by the transfer of the lines, being borne by the British and Indian Exchequers in the proportion of Five to Twelve, on the analogy of the distribution of the total cost prior to 1891. With regard to the final paragraph of your letter under reply, I am to state that, in view of the infor mation contained in Sir A.

It will be seen that it is proposed to postpone a decision on the definite steps to be taken for the working of the Khaf-Nasratabad section until it is known whether the Russian Government will agree to the working arrangements proposed in Mr. Kirk’s draft Memorandum of the 18th September last, and that the general question has been raised of the division between the two exchequers of any future, additions to existing expenditure, for political purposes, on telegraph establishments, &amp;c., in Persia, over and above the Rs. 20,000 per annum now borne by India alone.

Note by Mr. Kirk, dated 8th Oetober L908, on Government of India, Foreign Department, Despatch No. 166, dated 10th September 1908. If the Persian Government agree to the working arrangements over the d eheran-I\feshed-Seistan lines as shown m the memorandum I sub mitted on the 18th September last, a British telegraphist will have to be retained at Meshed, Turbat-i-Haidari, Khaf, Birjand, and Seistan. There are telegraphists from the Indian Telegraph Department at all these stations except Khaf. But the telegraphist of the Indo-European Telegraph Department at Meshed can work the lines to Teheran and to Seistan as he did until lately. This will release the Indian Telegraph Department telegraphist at Meshed, and he can be transferred to Khaf. As to the charge ol the line from Khaf to Seistan, the officer in charge of the Teheran-Meshed line will be free to proceed at once to take over charge of the Khaf-Seistan Section immediately the transfers of the lines which would be made simultaneously, are carried out. With this arrangement it would be unnecessary to put the Sub- Assistant Superintendent at Seistan in charge of the line, and it will not be necessary to provide one Indian Sub-Inspector. There is a tele graphist at Seistan in addition to the Sub-Assistant Superintendent there. It might be taken into consideration whether the latter officer could not be recalled to India when the transfer of the line takes place, in order to reduce expenditure. The Government of India ask that the extra expenditure involved by the payments of the salaries of the Persian line staff amounting to Rs. 600 per mensem may be sanctioned provisionally. There appears to be no way of avoiding the payment of this charge on the transfer of the line, though it may be possible later to induce the Persian Telegraph Administration to meet the whole or some part of this expenditure from the traffic receipts of the line. Perhaps the answer to the Government of India Despatch might be kept in abeyance till it is known whether the Russian Government agree to the proposed working arrangement on the lines after transfer. With reference to Mr. Campbell’s letter of the 23rd September last as to the arrangements to be made with the Russian Government for the exchange of the control over the Tehran-Meshed and Khaf- Nasratabad telegraph lines, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to enclose copy of a Despatch, with enclosures, from the Government of India No. 166, dated 10th September 1908. As regards the question of the incidence of the cost involved in the exchange of the control, it will be remembered that in 1891 an arrangement *See letter of Treasury to Foreign con trolling the Tehran-Meshed line, Office, dated 16tl. November 1891. ^ ^ est f mated maximum cost of Rs. 20,000 (1,3331.) a year, was shared between the Indian and British 8th October 1908. H. A. Kirk. Enclosure No. 2. India Office, 6th January 1909.

On the other hand, if the proposals of His Majesty’s Government,! as to the t See Draft Memorandum of Director- arrangements to be made for the in-Chief, dated 18th September 1908, exchange ^ ox the control over enclosed in despatch to His Majesty’s the two lines, are accepted by the Ambassador at St. Petersburg, No. 805, Russian Government, it has been dated 30th September 1908. estimated by the Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department that the resulting cost of maintaining six offices at Tehran, Meshed, Turbat-i-Haidari, Khaf, Birjand, and Nasratabad, and also of keeping the line from Khaf to Nasratabad (about 350 miles) in repair, will amount to Rs. 46,500 (3,100k) a year. This expenditure is independent of any initial outlay that may be required to put the line, when it is handed over to us, into an efficient state. The cost to India of controlling the Meshed-Tehran line was not included, presumably by an oversight, in the statement of charges on which the award of the Welby Commission was based, although account was taken of the treaty allowance paid to the Persian Government in respect of the telegraph line through Mekran. Lord Morley has no desire to disturb the settlement then arrived at, and he wonld not propose that a moiety of the existing expenditure of Rs. 20,000 per annum on the Meshed-Tehran line should be borne by the British Exchequer. But Lord Morley trusts that Sir E. Grey will agree that any expenditure for purely political purposes, on telegraph establish ments, &amp;c., in Persia, over and above a sum of Rs. 20,000 per annum to be borne, as hitherto, by India alone, should be equally divided between two Exchequers, in the same manner as all other expenditure in Persia of a political character, and that lie will obtain the sanction of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury to the adoption of this course. As regards the arrangements to be made for the control of the Khaf- Kasratabad line, when the transfer is effected, and before the line is permanently taken over by the Indo-European Telegraph Department, I am to enclose copy of a notef by the Director-in-Chief of the Indo- i Dated 8th October 1908.

QODLE APPROVED OOUNUiL ‘INOTE BY FINANCIAL SECRETAPY. We ought certainly to claim from the Treasury that they should pay us in future years ther (a) On,e half of the total amount expended in Persia on telegraph establishments, for pol i ti cal purposes, or (b) Half of the future o/lditions to existing expend iture of th i s nature . hfy own inclination is in favour of alternative (b) but in order to make clear my reasons it is necessary to refer to the history of the Tehran-Meshed section In 1887 expenditure wcs undertaken on this section up to a limit of Rs.20,000 a year. The disbursements were made in the first instance from Indian revenues, and the Imperial Government agreed to bear a portion of the cost, thus admitting that thev had. an interest in the line• ey actucl 1 y cont?dbuted ceased to do this Office expend! ture towards the cost for some years, but so owing to a difference of opinion with regarding the incidence of political in Persia generally. Th,is Office submittedsubmitted to the withdrawal of the Imperial contribution, and the irfiole expenditure thereupon became an Indian change. It was open to us subsequently, when Lord Wei by , s Commission was sitting, to point out to the Commission that we were bearing the charge, and, if we had done so, the Commission would probably have decided that it,like all other* political charges in Persia, should be borne in equal shares by the two Governments. But we failed, presumably through inadvertence, to draw attention to the existence of the charge, which therefore still continues to be borne by Indio,. Th,e award of the Royal Commission regarding the incidence of all charges in Persia that were being borne in 1900 was accepted, in due course by the Indio, Office and the Treasury. If it were now open to us to claim that the Commissi on 9 s award should be modified, owing to the discovery of defects in the claim which we submitted to them y we could ask that the charge of Rs.20,000 which we have hitherto borne should be( S shared by the Imperial Government, and this would he effected if we now made a claim on the Treasury on the lines of alternative (a) above instead of on the lines of alternative (b). In my opinion, however, the award of Lord. Welly's Commission must be adopted as final and conclusive i respect of the expenditure that was being incurred when the Commission reported, because, when it was accepted by the two offices, no reservation was made en abl i ng e i th er Cove mmen t to cl a i m that it shoul d be varied in the future in respect of minor errors which might have been, but were not, di scovered at the time of the report and of its acceptance. If my view is r'egarded as correct, and alternative (b) is proposed, to the Trsa&amp;ary and agreed to by them, the incidence of telegraph expenditure incurred for political purposes in Persia will be as follows:- Bs. 20,000 of s ch expenditure will be borne entirely by India. The balance will be equally shared between the two Governments.I should naturally have preferred to recommend al temotive (a), so that, if it were accepted, the whole of the expenditure in question might he shared between the two Governments; but, having regard, to the history of the settlement that was reached, as the result of the Wei by Commi ssion's report, I think that the course which I have suggested is the right one. I suggest that the case should, be put before the Treasury now. It would scarcely be reasonable to include the additional expenditure in our future annual statements of exp enditure in Persia wi thout having obtained the previous concurrence of the Treasury./ U,ihf' ( fo^'’ oSr 2V w. Note/on Question of a claim being made teethe Treasury to contribute towards cost of maintaining the Khaf-Seistan line. With reference to the question of making a claim on the Treasury to bear some portion of the expenditure that will be incurred to keep up the Khaf-Seistan line, I find that at one time the Treasury paid a part of the Rs.20,000, the amount that is allowed to be spent in the up-keep of the Teheran-Meshed line. When the control of the Teheran-Meshed line was first taken over all charges were debited to the Afghan Boundary Commission. This Commission started on its return to India in September 1886, and the Government of India ordered that the cost of the Meshed telegraph line should be borne by the Indo-European Tele graph Department with effect from 1st.October 1886. In a despatch no.24 Telegraph, dated 14th December 1886, the Government of India reported that in their opinion the Meshed line should be maintained and remain in the hands of the Indo-European Telegraph Department even if it costs the maximum estimated sum of Rs.20,000 a year. On receipt of this despatch a letter, No.P.W.5 dated 26th January 1887, was addressed to the Eoreign Office, asking that the Treasury should be called upon to share the expense equally with India of maintaining the Meshed line, the estimated maximum cost of which was Rs.20,000 per annum. The Treasury agreed to contribute but on condition that the division of the cost was to be the same as adopted at the time in regard to the expenses of the Teheran Mission,viz.,Indian sharen Sfe rt share 12, British share 5. This arrangement might he re considered in not less than 5 years from October 1386. On 15th November 1391 the Treasury informed the Foreign Office that as the Government of India had repudiated the basis of division of 5/l7ths-British and 12/l7ths. India for the expenses of the Persian Mission, and were now going to contribute a fixed sum that was considered far from ade quate, the ground on which the Teheran-Meshed telegraph contribution was agreed to had ceased to exist, and the contribution would be discontinued. The Treasury contribution was thereupon stopped, and the Government of India, when informed of this, were a^l.ed if ^he v .- considered it advisable, in view of the small amount at issue, to make any alteration in the mode of ad ministering the Teheran-Meshed line. Their reply was they considered it would be inadvisable to discontinue the main tenance of the line by the Indo-European Telegraph Department and they agreed to the entire cost of maintaining the line being met from Indian revenues. As the Government of India had ordered in 1886 that the cost of maintaining tne ixne was to be charged to the Indo-European Telegraph Department, all expenditure in connection with it is shewn in the Budget Estimates and accounts of the Department in the same way as any other Departmental outlay. The only condition is that the Department must not spend more than Rs.20,000 per annum on charges connected with the line. It has been decided, when we obtain possession of tiem } \ tlie Khaf-§eistan line, that it has to he maintained, as soon as this can he arranged, hy the Indo-European Telegraph Department* In the case of the Meshed line we maintain 570 miles of line with two terminal offices at a cost of Rs.20,000 (£1333) per annum. Our proposals on the transfer of the lines, which however have not yet heen accepted hy the Russian government, are to maintain 6 offices namely at Teheran, Meshed, Turhat-i-Haidari, Khaf, Birjand, and Seistan, and also the line frcm Khaf to Seistan about 350 miles in length* The cost of this I estimate will amount to Rs.46500 (£3100) per annum, and it may he expected that there will he considerable extra initial outlay to get the line into an efficient state* In considering these figures it has to he noted that the Capital Account of the Indo-European Telegraph Department now amounts to one million pounds less £3000, and that the Department earned last year a net profit on this sum of £33312. If these figures were supplied to the Treasury it seems open to doubt whether they would consider favourably any claim to share in the cost of maintaining the Khaf-Seistan line* jn addition to this as India has accepted the withdrawal of the Treasury contribution for the Teheran-Meshed line, it appears doubtful whether a claim could w r ell be made, when the exchange of the lines takes place, for a contri bution for the Khaf-Seistan line, which lies much nearer to the Indian frontier. The Government of India in their despatch no.165, dated 10th September 1908 have sent a statement showing expenditure.•S expenditure on Diplomatic and Consular Establishments in Persia foi 1905 to 1907 * Under the Seistan Consulate charge the sum of Rs.4484 is shewn for Telegraph establishment, being expenditure in connection with signallers sent from India to offices on the seistan line. I understand that the Treasury will be asked to contribute half of all charges shewn in the statement, so that the question of a contribution from the Treasury for expenditure in connection with the Khaf-seistan line will be raised by the presentation of the account as received from India. The position however will be different when the line is taken over from the Russians, and, as I have shewn, it seems to be doubtful whether any claim of the kind can then well be made on the Treasury. 28th October 1908[Uj [/v- 74.^ ^ ^ v - Kote^on Government of India.

There appears to be no way of avoiding the paymeitt / of this charge on the transfer of the line, though it may be possible later to induce the Persian Telegraph Administration I to meet the whole or some part of this expenditure from the traffic receipts of the line. Perhaps the answer to the Government of India despatch might be kept in abeyance,till it is known whether the Russian Government agree to the proposed v/orking arrangements on the lines after transfer. /■MB I ■■■ AX-7^3 No. 166 op 1908. GOVERNMENT OP INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. Frontier. To The Right Hon’ble VISCOUNT MORLEY of BLACKBURN, O.M., Eis Majesty's Secretary of State for India. April last, agreeing that, in the event of the consent of the Persian Govern ment being obtained to the proposed exchange of telegraph lines in Persia between Great Britain and Russia, the Indian Telegraph Department should accept the initial transfer of the Khaf-Nasratabad section of the Meshed- Seistan Telegraph line and carry on work until such time as the section is taken over permanently by the Indo-European Telegraph Department. 2. In his letter No. 50 C., dated the 23rd February 1908, a copy of which is enclosed, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain discusses the additions which it will be necessary to make to the existing telegraph staff when the transfer of the line is effected, and proposes inter alia (a) that Mr. McManus, Sub-Assistant Superintendent at Seistan, should be placed in charge of the section as Inspecting Telegraph Master with a charge allowance of Rs. 100 a month in addition to his present salary; (6) that the entire Persian line staff should be taken over; (c) that one.Indian Sub- Inspector should be added to the existing staff on a salary of Rs. 50 a month; and (d) that a British signaller should be posted to Khaf on a salary (inclusive of allowances) of Rs. 332 a month. 3. With reference to proposal (d), we apprehend that, in the event of the withdrawal of the British signallers from Meshed and.Turbat-i-Haidari, it will be possible to appoint one of them to Khaf on his present pay and allowances. The appointment of an additional British signaller for Khaf will not, therefore, be necessary. As to proposal (&lt;?), we have ascertained that it will be impossible to obtain the services of a suitable Sab-Inspector for less than a salary of Rs. 100 a month, with a fixed travelling allowance of Rs. 30 a month and a horse allowance of Rs. 20 a month, which cannot be considered excessive in view of the high cost of living in Persia and the responsible nature of the work which he will be required to perform. With these exceptions, we accept Major Kennion’s recommendations. 4. The extra expenditure involved in these arrangements amounts to Rs. 850 a month or Rs. 10,200 a year distributed as follows :— (1) Charge allowance to Mr. McManus ... ... Rs. 100 per mensem. (2) Pay of one Indian Sub=ffnspector (with travelling „ 150 „ allowance and horse allowance). Simla, the 10th September 1908.

From—MiJoa^R.JL Kenkion, I.A., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan To-The Secretary to the Government o£ India in the Foreign Department. •n Ih a v ® tlle, ' fmor *&lt;&gt; request a reference to the Government of India’s Despatch No. 16, dated Kith January 1908, to His Majesty’s Secretarv of State for India on the subject of the telegraph lines from Meshed to Tehran and Seistan. 2. In the 4th paragrapli of the abore cited paper, it is mentioned that the Government of India are in possession of no very definite information regard ing the system and number of employees on the Khaf-Seistan Section. I submit in this connection a, copy of a note recorded by Mr. How son Sub- Assistant Superintendent of Telegraphs, which I trust will be found to supply the details required. r J 3. It will be noted that the list of the Russian staff on the line given in Mr. Marling’s Confidential Despatch No. 250, dnted 2nd December 1907, is correct, with the exception of the inclusion of the Mechanic Constantinow, who worked on the Meshed-Seh Deh section, and who has since been with drawn. 4. As regards the cost of upkeep, the enquiries I have made elicit the fact that no money is handed over by theTocal Governors of Seistan and Kain for this purpose. The Director of Customs, Seistan, has also told me that no money is paid from Customs revenues. The ghulams, and line staff are, it seems, paid direct by the Russians; and if the latter are reimbursed at all, it is probably from telegraph receipts at Meshed or Tehran. It may be noted that the ghulams on the Southern Section of the line have recently been complain ing of not haying received their pay. The inference may perhaps be drawn that the Russians, haying failed to obtain reimbursement of sums previously spent on this account, and in view of their connection with the line being severed, have discontinued payment. 5. The following are suggestions as to action which it w r ill be necessary to take when the line is handed over to us :— (a) At Nasratabad, Seistan, there are three rooms in the same Tele graph building, set apart for the Persian, Russian and British offices. At the present time, the British office is only used for the storage of material, our signaller doing his work in the Persian office. The line goes, first to the Russian office whence it is given to the Persian office by means of a commutator. The steps to be taken will be to remove the present terminal pole to outside the British office and to so connect the wires as to place the control of the line in our hands instead of as at present in the hands of the Russians. Or else—and this would he prefer able as attracting less attention—for ourselves and the Russians to exchange rooms. (5) At Birjand, British, R.ussian and Persian signallers have hitherto worked in the same office. If this arrangement continues, no alteration of the wire will be necessary, though when occasion offers, an endeavour should be made to obtain the use of a separate room and so to arrange the wire as to give our signaller the control of the line. If however, in the meantime, the Russians succeed in obtaining a separate room for their tape instrument, either with or without the control of the line, we should I presume expect them to transfer the privilege to us on the agree ment being brought into effect.2 The latest infortna'ion I have received on this subject is that orders have been reeled ^ Tehran not to alio* the line wxre to go first to the Russian’s room. (r] AtKhaf it will be necessary to arrange for a Telegraph building ( &gt; and quarters for the signaller The reqms.te instruments, m nrdpr to carry out the proposal ot separate offices and com- mutators^wild also have to be sent. TTxis point will be further touched on in connection with line stall. (d) Although Mr. Howson’s note shows that the line is ill constructed, ( } it would not seem necessary to undertake its reconstruction immediately. This could be done gradually, and the batteries, insulators and other fittings could he replaced as they become worn out. An immediate inspection of the line with the view of making estimates for the future and the submission of indents would be advisable. (e) The introduction of telephones on the line, which has been suggested by Mr. Howson, would seem advisable on all grounds. (f) The only addition to the Bdtish Staff on the line which now v/ ’ J stands as shown m the mar- 2 Sub Assistant Snperinlendents. would be a signaller 1 Signaller. f or Khaf. Both Mr McManus and Mr. Howson, who are the Sub-Assistant Super intendents at Seistan and Birjand, respectively, have experience of construc tion work and the deputation of a special Inspector from India to look alter the line would be superfluous. It would, however, be necessary to give a special allowance to the individual selected lor the chaige of the line. At present, as Mr. Howson is doing very useful political work in Birjand, it seems that the best and most convenient arrangement would probably be for Mr. McManus to have charge of the line as Inspecting Telegraph Master, with his head quarters in Seistan, whence he would make an annual inspection of the hue m the autumn. I should prefer,’however, that a final decision on this point should be left pending a settlement regarding the Birjand Vice-Consulate. As regards Ehaf, it may be expected, when the exchange of lines takes place, that the Kniaz Vachadze will be transferred from this place, and a Russian signaller sent in his place. In any case it would seem advisable that the British signaller sent to Khaf should have some experience of the country and be able to speak the language, so that—as his telegraph work will be small, he may be of use as a news Agent. The post, however, will be an isolated one and should, I think, carry with it a special allowance. In this connection I would point out that it does net seem really necessary for either the Russians or ourselves to have a signaller at Khaf. A mutual agreement, not to keep British or Russian signallers there would not, so far as 1 can see, prejudice our political interests in any way, while there would be a material saving of expense. This, however, is a question on which Major Sykes is better qualified to express an opinion. As pointed out by Mr. Howson, an Indian Sub-Inspector, to take the place of the Russian Mechanic, will be indispensable. The line staff of ghulam bashis and ghulams should be taken over as they stand. Their pay is adequate and their numbers sufficient. As Khaf will be a terminus, as far as our supervision of the line is concerned, it should be theoretically possible to manage with one ghulam at this post instead of two, hut in view of a signaller being posted to this place who would require a peon, I would prefer to waive the question of this trifling reduction. 6. Since the line will remain the property of the Persain Government it would be convenient that its control and maintenance should be carried out under the general superintendence of His Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Khan ; and in these circumstances, if it is decided to k&lt; ep a signaller at Khaf, he would, I presume, be under the same controlling officer. This sugges tion should not 136 read to imply a recommendation that Khaf, which is at present in the Turbat Consular district, should be included in that of Seistanand Kain. This question would naturally depend on the ultimate decision arrived at regarding the Vice-Consulate at Birjand and Consular arrangements generally in Eastern Persia. 7. A statement showing the annual cost of the suggested telegraph and line establishment is appended. 8. Copies of this letter with enclosures are being sent to Tehran, Meshed, and Turbat.

B. Sowson, Sub- Assistant Superintendent of Telegraphs, Birjand. Line stoees at peesent in use. Wire — Gauge. In mv opinion the gauge is as near as possible to, if not identical with, Indian Telegraph Iron Wire Gauge No. 12, weighing 300 lbs. per mile. The Russian Inspector informed me that the diameter of the line wue was 4 millimetres. This would he identical with Indian Telegraph Wire Gausre No. 14 weighing 350 lbs. to the mile. This point, however, could easily be decided by sending a sample piece of wire to the Telegraph Store Yard, Calcutta. , ± Wire—Faulty construction. In many places I found the line wire, even in summer time, stretched nuite tauT between the supports. Notwithstanding the short spans at present fflg thL must resuf/in a great strain on the wire, pariicularl^ during the winter mouths, when occasionally the temperature goes places to zero.” • \ 4 Joints. “ Twist” and not “ Britannia ” joints are in use. Fosts — Kinds. These are of Poplar and Pine (vernacular names “ safida ” poplar, and “ naju” sometimes called “ sarv, piue). Tost — Dimensions. The posts average 20 feet in length and are buried 3 feet in the ground. The average girth at the top is 9 inches and at the base 19 inches. j&gt;osts—Where obtainable and rate. Both kinds of posts are obtainable at Rhaf at the rate of Krans 20 (Rs. 5-14) each, and a limited number of poplar posts in the Sunmkhana District at an averege rate of Krans 10 (Rs. 2-15) each. Posts — Cost of transport. The cost of transport per post from Khaf to Seistan is Krans 80 (Rs. 23-8-6), and that of poplar posts from Sunnikhana to Seistan would be about Krans 35 (Rs. 10-4-5) each. The posts are carried down and distributed shortly after cutting whereas, f they were allowed to dry where cut, the cost of transport would be much less. . The number of poplar posts obtainable in the Sunnikhana district would be sufficient for our yearly requirements for the portion of the line from Sihdeh to Seistan and' it will only be necessary to indent on Khaf for the North ern section. Posts—Number per mile. The Russians have adopted 16* posts to the verst which wmrks out to 24 15 per mile. The reason for such a high proportion is due to the prevalence of white ants which freely attack the portions of the posts buried. It will be readily under stood that the nearer the pos r s are to one another, the less likelihood there is, when a post breaks off, of the wire sagging so near to the ground as to be within reach of camels. Posts—Average life. I should set down the average life per post as seven years, though the Russian Inspector seems to think it onl v v five years. It is interesting to note that the posts situated in the Hamun last much longer than those on dry land. Insulators and Brackets. The Insulator (see Diagram II) is an ordinary porcelain cup and is fixed by means of cement to one end of a curved stalk the other end of w r hieh is screwed into the post. I have found these insulators and stalks answer the purpose very well. If, however, the same pattern is not stocked by the Indian Government Tele graph Department, it could be replaced, as occasion demands, by the kind used in India (in Kashmir for example). In this case of course brackets and backs would also have to be supplied.5 Circuit. All the offices are joined up for ordinary “ Open-Circuit ” working. Instruments. Each office is fitted up with a Morse set, consisting of Relay (Resistance 500 ohms), Sounder, Key, and Galvanometer fitted on a board. Also a two- plate Lightning Discharger and a four-bar Switch or Commutator. All the instruments are by Messrs. Siemens Brothers, London. Switch. Of all the above-mentioned instruments, the Switch is the only one which calls for particular mention on account of the part it plays in the “ tapping ” of messages. This Switch, vide diagram No. 1, is used for joining the line “direct” or for “ K. 0.” i.e.i keeping open. 'With plugs inserted in holes 3 and 4 the line is joined direct and with plugs in 1 and 2 both sides of the line are con nected with the instruments. When, however, a station is working with one side, the plug connecting the other side to the instruments is removed, and that side remains “ insulated ” until such time as the plug is re-inserted or the line joined “direct.” It is very easy to interpolate the “ receiver ,5 of an intermediate office by simply connecting a wire between the screw at one end of Bar C and the earth screw of the receiver and at the same time throwing off the earth con nection. The plugs inserted for this interpolating would be 1 and 4 or 2 and 3. By interpolating the “ receiver,” an intermediate office can easily “tap ” any telegrams that may be exchanged between an office on one side and another on the other side of the intermediate office. Batteries. The Battery in use at present is the “ Medinger,” a variety of the “ Daniell.” This class of Battery has been introduced by the Russians in place of the &lt;e Minotto ” battery formerly used by the Persians. In my opinion the “ Minotto ” is, if anything, preferable, as it requires less supervision and cannot be so easily tampered with by the Persian Tele - graphists, the majority of whom know very little about Technical Telegraphy. Should the Ci Minotto ” Battery be adopted by us, the necessary sawdust is obtainable in Meshed. A limited quantity of sawdust (inulbery and walnut) is also procurable in Birjand, but I think that, if an order be placed in advance with the local sawers, sufficient could be collected for all the offices on the line. The extra cost of carriage from Meshed would thereby be saved. Bine Staff .— 'Persian Line Staff. Tables 1 and 2 show the present distribution of the Persian line establish ment. Persian Line Staff. Their Salary. The Rusians pay the Perisan line staff at the following rates per mensem :— Ghulam Bashi. Krans 170 (R50). Ghulam „ 100 (1129-6-7). The above rates cannot be reduced compatibly with efficiency ; and x propose that the same rates be retained by us. The salary of the Ghulams includes the up-keep of a horse. 5894 P. D.6 Russian Inspectors. TW hive their headquarters at Khaf and Shusp respectively : their section being from Meshed to Sehdeh and Sehdeh to Seistan (Sehdeh is situated almost midway between Kain and Birjand). It will he seen that the Russian Inspectors have selected as their head quarters places almost centrally situated in their sections. I heir reason for the same is. obviously, to more efficiently supervise the hue. Tfnnninoh TVt.QYi Pf'.tn'Y'. I think one British Inspector would be able to supervise the whole line from Khaf to Seistan ; but he should be allowed one Sub-Inspector : to whom I shall allude in a separate paragraph. British Inspector.—Sis Duties. The duties of the Inspector would he to arrange for a supply of posts, the submitting of indents and supervising the annual repairs of the line and the technical arrangements of all Telegraph Offices. i Sub-Inspector.— Why necessary. An Indian Muhammadan Sub-Inspector would, I think, be absolutely necessary to carry out the annual maintenance repairs under the supervision of the British Inspector. He would also instruct the Ghulam^ bashis and Ghulams in the preparing and maintaining of batteries, the making of joints, and, in fact, in all the routine work necessary for them to know. British telegraphists.—Sow they may be utilized to assist the Inspector. The British Telegraphists at Seistan and Birjand could when necessary issue orders, on an interruption occuring, to the Ghulams of the office nearest to the fault, to proceed on the line. Miscellaneous. Telephones. As the Ghulam bashis Buniabad and Bandan are unable to signal on the Morse instruments, it is absolutely necessary that they should be supplied with telephones to ascertain the state of communication ; and it would conse quently be necessary for the Inspector, Sub-Inspector and British Telegraphists to be also supplied with similar instruments so as to be able to communicate with the Ghulam bashis. Telephone. — Battern. The most suitable Telephone in my opinion is that by Ericson of Stockholm, the same as is used by the Indo-European Telegraph Department on their Kirman-Bobat wires. W. E.

The Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury request you to bring to the recollection of the Marquis of Salisbury Sir Julian Pauncefote’s letter of the 10th Lecember 1887, signifying his Lordship’s concurrence in a suggestion by this Department that the arrangement for an Imperial contribution towards the expense of maintaining the Tehran-Meshed telegraph should be reconsidered in not less than five years from October 1886. The arrangement in question was that the actual cost of maintenance within a maximum of Es. 20,000 per annum should be divided between the British and Indian Government in the same proportion as that in which the expenses of the Persian Mission were then assumed to be divided, viz., y 5 T ths British, |fths Indian. The Secretary of State is aware that the above basis of division for the expenses of the Persian Mission has since been repudiated by the Government of India, which is now going to contribute only a fixed sum of an amount which, in my Lords’ opinion, is far from adequate. Such being the ease, the ground on which the Tehran-Meshed telegraph contribution w^as agreed to, has ceased to exist; and as the period for which it was agreed to has expired, my Lords request that you will move the Secretary of State to cause the necessary steps to be taken for discontinuing it. * ' I am, &amp;c., G.

With reference to this intimation of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, I am directed to state that Viscount Cross observes, from a letter addressed by Sir J. Paunccfote to the Treasury on the 26th November 1887, that the Marquis of Salisbury was in favour of making a contribution from Imperial funds to the proper maintenance of the line, and that this was accordingly done. The Secretary of State for India in Council was therefore not prepared for the withdrawal of the Imperial contribution, and trusts that the Marquis of Salisbury has seen no reason to modify his previously expressed view r s on this subject.
