It includes accounts of meetings between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant Colonel Sir William Rupert Hay) and the Sultan, discussing the Sultan's efforts to increase his influence among the shaikhs of the Omani tribes.Much of the correspondence discusses future British policy regarding the Trucial states and central Oman. Of particular note is a letter from Geoffrey Warren Furlonge of the Foreign Office's Eastern Department to the Political Resident (ff 30-35), discussing several policy issues, including the following: whether the Trucial shaikhs should be encouraged to extend their authority over those tribes that may be considered as owing them allegiance; whether the British should enter into direct relations with the shaikhs of central Oman; proposals from the Political Resident for the creation of a Council of Trucial Shaikhs and the establishment of a separate Political Agency on the Trucial Coast.Other related matters covered in the correspondence include the following: reports of Omani shaikhs asserting their allegiance to neighbouring states, such as Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia; the issuing of identity certificates by the Political Officer at Sharjah to Omani tribe members, following earlier accounts of tribe members travelling to Saudi Arabia without certificates and being issued with Saudi travel documents.The file also includes Arabic and English copies of letters received by the Sultan from various Omani shaikhs. Other notable correspondents include the following: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Agency, Bahrain; the Political Officer, Sharjah.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office, Eastern Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><subject><topic>Travel documents</topic></subject><subject><topic>Tribes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00001a#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00001a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
