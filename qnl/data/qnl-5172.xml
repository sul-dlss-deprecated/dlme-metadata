The petition was raised by a Saudi Arabian resident in Bahrain called Muhammad bin Abdulla bin Hasan Al-Bu ‘Ayenen to the Political Agency in Bahrain. The petitioner was asking for the recovery of the title deed of some land he purchased in the past at 'Askar.After investigation, the Land Department, in agreement with the Ruler of Bahrain and the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain (Charles Dalrymple Belgrave), agreed that only the cultivated piece of land at 'Askar was the property of the petitioner, and that the rest of the land should be taken into the possession of the Government and defined as Government wasteland.The main correspondence is between Muhammad bin Abdulla bin Hasan Al-Bu ‘Ayenen, the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain (Charles Dalrymple Belgrave) and the Bahrain Political Agency.The file’s core correspondence covers the period 1940 to 1947. However, the earlier start date given for the file is a result of an attached translation of the aforementioned land’s sale deed (f 10), itself dated 3 Shaban 1339/ 12 April 1921.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Register of deeds</topic></subject><subject><topic>Land titles</topic></subject><subject><topic>Title deeds</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000289#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000289#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000289#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
