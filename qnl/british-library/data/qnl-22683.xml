The question has been further considered by the Government of India who have now come to the Conclusion that a systim of destinatirnal quotas ?&lt; would not be to the interests either of the consuming countries of the •/ Indian Tea Industy. The Government of India have therefore decided not to continue the desinational quote system when the ban on private exports of tea is withdrawn from January 1, 1947.
