O.O.No. C/646. 1584 1 Muscat, the 9 The Omanis suffer from a fear that Iran has deal ns on their country* They have, suffered from this phobia for a long time but normally it la domant only coming to light when external political circumstances occur which are beyond their comprehension* filtered through into Oman and once again the Omanis cure thinking of the problem of Iran and the possibility of that country taking advantage of the pre-occupation of greater nations to attack this country* remarkable letters* The first from Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi offering aid and his services should the Iranians attempt anything against Muscat. The second from U an adviser of Sheikh Suleiman bin Haaiyar of Jebel Akhdar suggesting that the Sultan should receive a visit from the Sheikh with a view to discussing the world situation* The third from Obaid bin Salim, a Qadi and confidant of the Imam, suggesting that he came to Muscat after the Ramadan fast as the Imam’s accredited agent to discuss the International Situation in as far as it affects Muscat* The Suited discussed these letters with me at a recent interview and asked my advice about how he should answer At last news of the course the war has taken has2 V his offer and be told that there was no question of! effective action against Muscat y and that ^ulekuanil Obaid bin Salim should be told that their visits would be welcome, the Sultan agreed and said that he would write reassuringly to all three of his correspondents making it clear that he personally has no fear of any action by Iran for he said he did not wish the Omanis to get the impression that His Majesty's Government was too pre-occupied by world events to look after the security of Muscat should Iran consider the time had come when she could with safety launch an attack on his country. X am inclined to think that it is not only the Omanis who are susceptible to invasion nightmares. The Omanis are worried and to a lesser degree the Sultan is worried and has y so I ettyfer tells a8 y been discussing the possibility of air attack from Russia and Russia*s attitude generally. This fear on the part of the Omanis may bring them into closer contact with the Sultan's Government and as far as that goes no ham will be done in fact the reverse^but fear is a dangerous element and is liable to get out of control unless checked in time and then no one can forte 11 what will happen. The Sultan himself is worried, exactly to what extent 1 find it difficult to decide as he is remarkably good at disguising his feelings, and I think that it is time that he was able to see for himself that there are still British ships of war afloat and in the ereian Gulf. The absence of British Ship of War from Muscat waters is largely responsible for the Omani attitude and a visit even for a few hours would have a soothing effect on their nervous system. I realise that the Navy have many and responsible duties to perform in these days but I do request that the Senior Naval Officer be asked to try and arrange for a ship to visit Muscat occasionally even if it bt for only an hour. If Muscat is too far south then I ®ugge3t one of the Batinah towns such as Sohar or Musannah. If X could be imoi’mad of the intended visit I would make a point of being present.
