Britisn Embassy, Rome. 22nd September, 1933. Reference to previous despatch: To Foreign Office: No. 696 (39/57/33) of 14th September 1933. Description of Enclosure# ,Name and Date Subject From: Dispute between King Ibn Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Saud and Imam Yahia# Rome'V Translation 1 Urgent I NoiSSS396/118 MINISTRY OF FOREIC^? AFFAIRS, NOTE VERBALS In their Pro-memoria No* 39/14/33 of July 15th H.B.M. Embassy drew the attention of the Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the state of the relations between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahia as being one calculated to result in the outbreak of an armed conflict, and added that, with a view to avoiding the outbreak of hostilities the British Government had already, and in strong terms, urged counsels of moderation on the Saudi Government, and th^r trusted that the Royal Government would for their part, in accordance with conclusions (l) and (2) of the Rome Conversations of 1927, proceed similarly with the Imam, and take all possible steps to ensure that neither the Imam himself nor the followers of the Idrisi snould receive assistance and encouragement of any kind from territory under Italian sovereignty. In a further Pro-memoria, No. 39/26/33 of August 3rd, H.B.M. Embassy stated that the Government at London had received information that the Imam had prevented the Saudi delegation at Sanaa from leaving the Yemen or from communicating with King Ibn Saud; and they requested the Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make urgent representations to the Imam with a view to the latter restoring their liberty to the above-mentioned delegation. Finally, in their Note Verbale No. 289 (39/46/33) of August 30th last, H.B.M. Embassy, while stating that the two Arabian monarchs were again in telegraphic communication, represented that, according to a report received from the British Charg4 d*Affaires at Jedda, the Imam had demanded of King Ibn Saud the cession of Nejran and the postponement of the other questions at issue; that, according to the Saudi interpretation of an agreement concluded in 1927 between the —the two States, Nejran and northwards was to belong to the Saudi Arabian Kingdom, while Wayla and southwards was to belong to the Yemen; tnat the Imam had accepted this settlement except where it related to the Idrisi territory: and that the Imam’s recent request would therefore appear to constitute a repudiation of the agreement in question. H.B.M. Embassy finally asked what was the Imam’s version of the dispute regarding Nejran and the above-mentioned agreement of 1927. 2. In reply to the above communications, the Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs have the honour to inform H.B.M. Embassy as follows: The information in the possession of the Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs is to the effect that there was no question of any detention of the Saudi delegation at Sanaa, such as that described in H.B.M. Embassy’s Pro-memoria of August 3rd. This ^— information was implicitly confirmed by a Saudi official communique, published in the semi-official Jedda paper Umm-al-Qure of August 11th, which makes no mention of such a detention, and states that the Saudi delegation had left Sanaa, as the illness of the Imam did not permit him to continue the conversations already begun; the communique added that, as was stated in H.B.M. Embassy’s Note Verbale of August 30th, Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahia were continuing to maintain telegraphic comimmication, with a view to reaching a settlement of the questions outstanding between the two States. 3. In accordance with the request contained in H.B.M. Embassy* s Note Verbale of August 30th, the Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs have already taken steps to ascertain the Imam's point of view regarding the agreement said to have been concluded between him and King Ibn Saud,in 1927 in regard to the frontiers between the two States. Pending, however, the receipt of this information tne Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs deem it useful to submit to H.B.M.H.B.M. Embassy certain observations on the existence of such an agreement. in the first place, the fact remains that neither during the Italo-Britisn Conversations held in Rome in 1927, nor in the correspondence subsequently exchanged between the Italian and Britisn Governments regarding the relations between the Yemen and Saudi Arabia and the general situation in the Arabian peninsula, was mention apparently ever made, or recourse ever had, to the agreement referred to above. In the second place, the Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs are able to communicate to H.B.M. Embassy the following information, which recently reached them from an authoritative and entirely reliable source at Sanaa, at the very moment when the negotiations with the Saudi delegation there were commencing. The latter delegation did in fact refer to an alleged agreement regarding the frontiers, concluded some years ago between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, but the Yemeni Government represented to the Saudi mission that this agreement did not in fact exist, and that all that had taken shape was a mere draft, prepared by the Amil of Midi with some Saudi delegates on the occasion of the dispute regarding Jebel Ayir - a draft which was never approved by the Imam. The Saudi delegation were invited by the Yemeni Government to produce the text of this agreement, but they were never able to do so* In the third place, it is known that during the months previous to last May the Iman^s eldest son, Seif-el-Islam Ahmed, undertook a military police expedition in Ne^ran to subdue certain tribes. These operations in a territory which, according to the alleged agreementcf 1927, was under the sovereignty of Ibn Saud, did not prevent the latter from subsequently sending a delegation to Sanaa to negotiate with the Imam. This suggests that the possession of Nejran by the Saudi Arabian Kingdom was atat any rate not clearly stipulated in any agreement between the Yemen and Saudi Arabia. The Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, however, may have occasion to communicate further information as a result of the enquiries which they have already set on foot. 4. The Royal Government is in agreement with H.B.M. Government in considering the present tension between the two Arabian Kingdoms as being of a grave character; and, with a view to contributing their share towards the maintenance of peace in that region, they consider it incumbent upon them to submit, in the same spirit of frank and friendly collaboration as that which marked the Rome Conversations of 1927, the following further considerations to H.E.M. Government. The principal question which divides the two Arabian Kingdoms is that of the sovereignty of Asir, a territory in which King Ibn Saud has, since 1926, exercised rights of occupation and possession, thus modifying the pre-existing situation to tne detriment of the interests of the Yemen. September, 1931, the Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs had occasion to recapitulate the past history of the question, setting forth in detail the subsequent interventions of King Ibn Saud in that territory, first by the imposition of a Saudi protectorate (in 1926) and then by the transformation of the protectorate into an annexation (October 1930). As mentioned in the above Note Verbale, the de facto situation created by King Ibn Saud in Asir resulted in an In their Note Verbale No. 232445/140 of the iJth exchange of views between the Italian and Britisn Government, which agreed to postpone any formal or direct act of recognition of the sovereignty of King Ibn Saud over Asir. The Royal Government have already had occasion to represent to H.B.M. Government that this action of King Ibn Saud in Asir might provoke natural and comprehensible reactions on the part of the Imam, and accordingly to indicate thethe desirability of restraining King Ibn Sand from proceeding on the path on Trtiich he had set out# The Foreign Office replied that they saw no possibility of an outbreak of hostilities between the two Arabian kingdoms, and that they did not consider that there were for the moment any grounds for preoccupation* Since then the situation has been aggravated# As a result of the recent revolt of Asir tribes against the Saudi Government (a revolt during which the Imam maintained a correctly neutral attitude), King Ibn Saud completely eliminated the family of the Idrisi from participation in the government of Asir and transformed that territory into a mere province of the Saudi Arabian kingdom. 5# In considering the present situation, the Royal Government, as they had occasion to state in their Note V e rbale of the 10th September 1931 referred to above, are of the opinion that it is impossible to disregard the foregoing events, since the situation itself originated in the absorp tion of Asir by King Ibn Saud against the will of the local population and without taking into account the vaunted rights of the Imam# The attitude of absolute intransigence characterising Saudi policy in regard to Asir was illustrated in a conversa tion which took place last May between the Royal Minister at Jedda and Fuad Hamza, the Saudi Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in which the latter categorically stated that w Asir is an integral part of the Saudi Arabian terri tory and kingdom, whose ownership thereof is not open to question’ 1 • 6. The Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs must further draw H*B.M* Embassy’s most serious attention to the fact that, while negotiations between the Imam Yahia and Ibn Saud are stillstill proceeding, the latter has taken the initiative in warlike preparations which leave little doubt as to his intentions• He is, in fact, concentrating considerable forces on the Yemen frontiers, reinforcing the base at Jizan, enrolling troops in Nejd and Tehama, transporting troops and war material into Asir (availing himself among other things of the steamers of Besse and Co«, of Aden), acquiring arms and munitions and distributing arms to the tribes* It is natural that such steps should provoke the Imam to take the necessary precautionary and defensive measures* 7* The Italian Government are confident that the British Government are in agreement with them as to the necessity of avoiding at all costs a conflict between the two States* The origin of such a conflict would be found in the suppression of the buffer-state, the existence of which was held by the Rome Conversations to be necessary for the very purpose of preventing acute friction between the two Arabian kingdoms* The conflict would, it is unnecessary to state, hold the possibility of grave consequences and disorders throughout the Arabian peninsula* 8* The Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs are disposed to regard as a satisfactory consequence of the British action at Jedda and the similar Italian action at Sanaa the fact that, despite the return to their country of the Saudi delegation which were despatched to Sanaa, negotiations between the Imam and King Ibn Saud have not been broken off, but are continuing by means of telegraphic correspondence between the two Arabian sovereigns* The Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs have the honour to assure H.B.M. Embassy that, in accordance with the conclusionsconclusions of the Rome Conversations of 1927, they have taken urgent steps to use fresh counsels of moderation at Sanaa* The Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs nevertheless having regard to paragraphs 1 and 2 of the conclusions of those Conversations and to the indications contained in the previous paragraphs of their present Note, consider it necessary that fresh counsels of moderation should also he urged upon King Ihn Saud, having due regard to the de jure and de facto elements in the situation, so as to induce him, on the one hand, to suspend his preparations for war, and, on the other, to recede from the instransigent attitude which he has adopted, so that, hy recognising the necessity of finding between the parties an equitable settlement of the question of Asir, the necessary atmosphere may be created for the successful progress of the negotiations* Rome, 21st September, 1933 - XI'NDEXED mication on tms subject, please quote to any person by name, but to— In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. and address —not to i “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i.

WITH reference to your Royal Highness’s secret note of the 7th Rabi ath-Thani (the 30th July) last, relative to the situation between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen in regard to Asir, I have the honour to inform your Royal . Highness that I at once communicated with His Majesty’s Government in the sense indicated in the note, and am now instructed to inform your Royal Highness in reply that the Italian Government have assured the British Ambassador at Rome that they would act as desired by His Majesty’s Government and would urge counsels of moderation on the Imam Yahya. It was further stated by the Italian Government that, according to their information, the Imam had no desire to pick a quarrel with His Majesty King Ibn Saud. 2. I am to emphasise that this clearly shows that the Italian Government are prepared to act in the spirit of their understanding with His Majesty’s Government, that both Governments should refrain from intervening in conflicts in Arabia and should exert their influence in the cause of peace. 3. Apart from other considerations (which would, however, lead them to the same conclusions) His Majesty’s Government are bound by this undertaking to urge upon His Majesty King Ibn Saud the importance of adhering to his welcome and statesmanlike decision to avoid hostilities with Imam Yahya if possible, and they are under an obligation, if hostilities should unfortunately break out, to maintain an attitude of strict neutrality.

WITH reference to my despatch N&lt; the 1st instant, relative to the J present situation between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of two further notes from the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs of the 5th and 6th August respectively, a summary in each case having been telegraphed to you on the 6th and 7th instant. 2. At the time of writing I have no further information regarding the situation of the delegation at Sana beyond that contained in the second enclosure. The pretext first advanced by the Imamic delegates to delay the departure of their guests, according to my Saudi informants, viz., that negotiations could be resumed upon the recovery of the Imam from his present sickness, was, indeed, i a postponement to too remote and indefinite a date to be acceptable. Imam Yahya’s illness seems not only genuine, but serious, and you will doubtless be already aware of the reports that the King of Egypt and the King of Iraq have each sent two of their private physicians to his aid. 3. With regard to the attack the Saudi Minister in London states the Imamic forces are expected to launch on Badr, referred to in your telegram i/T 3 ^ No. 100 of the 3rd instant, I have had no mention of this actual locality made to me so~ far in mv conversations with Sheikh Abdulla Suleiman.

Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs to Mr. Calvert. (Translation.) (Confidential.) The Honourable Charge d’Affaires, Taif, August 5, 1933. WITH reference to your two confidential notes dated the 10th Rabi-ath- Thani (the 2nd August) and the 11th Rabi-ath-Thani, 1352 (the 3rd August), I request you to be good enough to communicate the following to the authorities concerned in His Britannic Majesty’s Government: — 1. We are very grateful for the reply of the British Government indicated in the two notes under reference relative to the situation between the Government of His Majesty and the Yemen, and their attention to this case for the cause of peace and friendship. 2. The intention of approaching His Britannic Majesty’s Government in this respect is for three matters only :— (a) The firm friendship existing between us and His Britannic Majesty s Government causes us to lay before them all difficulties which may confront us either with the Arab Governments or with the other Governments, for consultation between two friends, for exchange of views and for knowing the attitude of the British Government towards those difficulties. [879 aa—3](b) In view of what we understand about the agreement between the British Government and the Italian Government by which they have undertaken not to interfere in the Arab coast, we find that the Itcilian colonies on the African coast have become an asylum to the Idrisi party, and that he receives money and arms from that place, and this is contrary to the known attitude. We therefore wish to enquire from the British Government whether any change has happened to^ this agreement, to cause the Italian colonies to become the centre of such action. The reply of the British Government shows that this agreement still remains outwardly, but the fact is that we have become certain that hostile actions still continue. We therefore wish to know the advice of the British Government in respect of this suspected attitude on the part of the Italian Government. (c) We explain to the British Government hereunder the attitude which we will follow with the Imam Yahya in respect of his repeated aggressions, and if he agrees to and accepts them it will be as desired, otherwise God may excuse us; people and humanity may acquit us of meeting him with the same :— (1) We will request him to make apology and to give necessary satisfaction to us in respect of the treatment with which he treated the Saudi Arab delegation at Sana preventing them from communi cating with us, detaining them as though they were criminals and preventing them from returning to us. This fact cannot be tolerated by the honour of any nation all over the world and cannot be allowed by the general rules and laws of Governments or tolerated by (manly) self-respects. (2) His treatment of and assistance to the Idrisi and placing him in the extremities of the frontiers is contrary to the treaty which was concluded between the Government of His Majesty the King and him (Imam Yahya), and which was signed by the representatives of the Government of His Majesty the King and his representatives, and was ratified by His Majesty the King and by him. His insistence upon the stay of the Idrisi in the extremities of the frontiers clearly shows the intention of taking evil action, picking quarrels and c “g disturbances. We are therefore compelled to request that t e Idi isi may be delivered to us in pursuance of the treaty or he may be deported far from the extremities of the frontiers. (3) We cannot agree to keep silent till the end in respect of ajran an t e entry of the forces of Yahya within our frontiers, but his advance and aggression should be stopped, and we may then h 0 rl an , Un K derStandln f ab ° Ut the delimi tation of the frontiers which If hp n / 6n a £ I ® ef u P on an d confirmed to us by the Imam Yahya. the nositirm k t0 i an un d ers tanding in this connexion, portion will then be difficult and should not be neglected. him for fhp ' f° ( i e J lmit i n g ad the frontiers between us and m tor .he purpose of comfort and tranquillity. and we expllin ifto ^'T' 1 fr T Imam Yah y a at the present time aware that we do not desire hostdity u^any S ° that they may be observations,'we^are prepared to listen Ma -i esty ' s Government have any existing between us.

Section 1 . 1933 , [E 4700/759/25] No. 1. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—(Received August 16.) (No. 237.) ^ ' ^ r ’ __ Jedda, July 26, 1933. WITH reference to my telegram No. 140 of the 20th instant regarding the present position between Saudi Arabia ancTThe Yemen, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies, in translation, of the confidential note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and of a document, purporting to be a telegram sent from Riadh by King Abdul Aziz to Amir Feisal at Taif, both of which were left with me by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, Minister of Finance, upon his visit of the 20th instant, the nature of which was recounted in my telegram under reference. The absence of Fuad Bey Hamza at Jerusalem has left the Ministry for Foreign Affairs with no really responsible and capable official, so that it is not a matter for surprise that Ibn Saud should have instructed his son to entrust his appeal to His Majesty’s Government for advice to so experienced a Minister as Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman. 2. I do not propose to retrace the conversation, which has already been, I think, sufficiently outlined in my telegram under reference, save to record the exceptional earnestness with which the Minister described the very delicate relations now subsisting between this country and that of the Imam Yahya. He reiterated the charge of bad faith and of a deliberately provocative policy which, if pursued much further, would soon leave Ibn Saud no alternative but a resort to force. Ibn Saud’s policy was pacific, but any encroachment upon his territories would be resisted “ until not a man is left alive.” 3. The claims for the restitution of territory that have so thoroughly upset the Saudi Government are defined in the telegram from Ibn Saud to Amir Feisal as “the territories of the Idrisi and the districts of Qahtan and Hamazan in Asir.” I am not clear that this is a cool demand for the evacuation of the whole of Asir, but it unquestionably means a very considerable slice of that province. Qahtan is a little obscure, and Hamazan I have so far been unable to identify. The Handbook of Arabia, vol. I, Chapter V, on Asir, p. 132, states “in the south-eastern interior of the region live the six Qahtan tribes, each an autonomous unit, and none of them to be confounded with the nomad Qahtan of the south western region of Central Arabia.” Yet no mention of the Qahtan is made in the list of inland tribes at p. 134, though they are referred to at the foot of p. 137 as breeders of horses and the most enterprising traders of the interior. It would therefore seem likely that the perturbation of Ibn Saud arises from attempts of the Imam to suborn these tribes from their nominal, and perhaps divided, allegiance to King Abdul Aziz. I have recently received reports, in which I do not at present place much reliance, that Imam Yahya, through the intrigues of his eldest son, by subsidy and by the taking of hostages, has, indeed, established himself strongly with the tribes of the Najran. 4. Copies of this despatch are being sent to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome, His Majesty’s High Commissioners for Egypt and Transjordan, to His Majesty’s Chief Commissioner at Aden and to the senior naval officer in the Red Sea sloops, and a paraphrase of my telegram under reference is being sent to His Majesty’s High Commissioners for Egypt and Transjordan.

The fHAvilThe honM^to inform you of the following requesting that you would be good enough to communicate it as soon concerned in His Britannic Majesty s Government. The ^ ^ year continuous news has been received by us regarding the export of arms and ammunition from Asmara, but we are not certain of their souice various rumours have been current latterly regarding the arrival of quantities to the Idrisi from Massawa in consecutive consignments, and that there is a hope that arms will be forwarded from the Italian colonies and we have confirmed this through persons who are in the country of Imam Yahya, from Massawa and from news we receive from Jizan. This matter must not be treated lightly. is ac was further confirmed to us by the change of the Imam Yahya during his negotiations with our delegation, as explained to you by our representative, Abdullah-al-Suleiman, and it appears that the Imam lahya wishes to provoke us and to excite us to oppose him. We have therefore decided to discuss the matter very frankly with the British Government, believing that they are interested in the matter, whether on our part for the sake of our friendship with them (His Majesty’s Government), or for the sake of the Yemen, or for other parties whose intentions and desires the British Government aie not aware of, and if the matter interests the British Government as we think, we therefore ask them two things :— First: To agree with them (His Majesty’s Government) upon the case of the Yemen, and we will give them (His Majesty’s Government) under takings in respect of certain affairs which interest them, and they to give undertakings to us in respect of affairs which interest us. Second : To seek their (His Majesty’s Government) assistance in every case in accordance with the friendship which exists between two friends. The supplies and ammunition which have been supplied, and will be supplied, to the other parties cannot come except from two sources : either from the Italian Government or from certain Amirs of the Islam and Arabs and who have certain intentions and desires. If this matter interests the British Government, we should like to know to what extent the British Government will assist us in this case. The position is critical, and what should be avoided will occur shortly, as it seems to us, if God wills, and we must take the necessary precautions and preparation. Our preparation will be only to oppose Yahya and the Idrisi together, but we cannot do anything with foreign parties, so long as the friendly communications and relations existing between us and the British Government are as we know them. As the matter is important and urgent, I request you would be good enough to furnish me with the reply as soon as possible regarding the opinion of the British Government in this connexion. With highest respects, FEISAL, Minister for Foreign Affairs. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. (Translation.) Saud to Amir Feisal. My son Feisal, j u i y 16-17, 1933. WE have received the following telegraphic message from the delegation at Sana and forward it for your information :— A1 Amri and A1 Mitahhar came to us on Monday, deputed by the Imam Yahya as representatives, to enter negotiations with us, and after the exchange of compliments we started discussion. They said to us that they had somethingto say concerning the frontier, and we asked them to explain their intentions clearly so that we may know them and understand their meaning, but they requested us to postpone this till the next meeting. The second meeting was held to-day, and after a long preliminary discourse on the good faith of the Imam Yahya, and that he does not like misunderstandings between the two countries, they (the representatives) informed us with shame in their faces that they want the restitution of the Idrisi’s territory amTthe diktrictTof ”Qahtan and Hamazan in Asir to their original home (country), because they are part of the territory of the Imam Yahya. They added there is no difference between both parties, and that His Majesty the King did not enter the Idrisi’s territory until after the Idrisi had taken refuge with him. Now the Idrisi is completely routed, so that there is no reason to prevent His Majesty the King from restoring the said territories to their original country. They also proposed other trifling matters. We answered them that we definitely do not agree to discuss anything connected with the territory (? Idrisi) and Asir, and that to go more deeply into the matter would cause misunderstandings between us, and that this would be of no advantage, and we could see no necessity for discussion in this respect. They appeared to be annoyed at this, and informed us that they would communicate our speech to the Imam Yahya and would give us a reply. We also wished to discuss with them the question of the Idrisi remaining at Zohb Ha jar and his misdeeds, but they did not answer this. It seems that our negotiations with them will continue no longer, because it appeared from the beginning that there is no good faith here to enable an agreement to be reached. The above is the summary of the telegraphic message sent by the delegation; therefore Ibn Suleiman should proceed to Jedda at once to inform His Britannic Majesty’s Minister about this, and to inform him that we dislike evil, but people provoke us to do it. In view of the friendship which exists between us and the Government of Great Britain, we communicate this fact to them for their information and to let us know their (His Majesty’s Government) opinion in this respect, specially after we have become certain that certain Governments have already supplied, and will supply, arms and ammunition to those coasts, and we should like to know their (His Majesty’s Government) opinion in this respect.'Hi INDEXED In any further communication on this subject, please quote ^ N °- \ ZS — and address —not to any person by'name, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. / THE Under-Secretary of State for - Affairs presents his compliments to VWs.

[E 4711/759/25] ^ otj O August 1^ 1933. \ C - Section fcr No. 1. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—{Received August 16.) (No. 248.) Sir, Jedda, August 1, 1933. &gt;‘3W WITH reference to my printed despatch No. 240 o f the 27th July last, relative to the present situation between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a further note from the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs, which, like its predecessor, the enclosure to my despatch No. 237, was handed to me by the Minister of Finance. 2. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman had not left Taif when the special messenger sent from Jedda with my note No. 109 (the enclosure to the despatch under reference) arrived, so that he had already seen the communication and was aware of the nature of the advice offered by His Majesty’s Government when I called on him on the morning of the 30th July. 3. Our conversation on this occasion was of a general nature. As I reported in my telegram No. 146 of that day, he declared the situation in the Najran V* 2 'district continued materially unchanged; that the Saudi delegation remained, unwillingly, in the Imam’s capital, a suggestion to resume negotiations on the recovery of the Imam having been made by the Imam’s representatives; that the desires of Ibn Saud remained steadfastly pacific and that he would not be the first to start hostilities, but that, nevertheless, there was a limit to a policy of patience. I strongly impressed on Sheikh Abdullah the great importance attached by His Majesty’s Government to a studiously unprovocative attitude on the part of Ibn Saud, and alluded to the dangers which an armed clash between the two parties would arouse. He rejoined that Ibn Saud’s own inclinations fell in with the counsel of His Majesty’s Government in every respect, but forbearance would be construed by the King’s enemies as weakness. He handed me the note as I was taking my leave. 4. Sheikh Abdullah’s visit to me of this morning, in which he informed me of the enforced detention of the Saudi delegation at Sana, the prevention by the Imam of communication between the delegation and its own Government, and between Hamad Suleiman, a member of the delegation, and his brother, the Minister himself, has, I think, been sufficiently reported in my telegram No. 149 of to-day. 5. 1 have been at some pains to ascertain, as far as may be possible, the extent of the territorial demands of Imam Yahya, in view of the declaration of the Saudi Minister in London that the restitution of the whole of the Asir had been the opening bid of the Imamic delegation at the abortive conference at Sana. Little seems to be known, with precision, by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, or, as already reported by Sir Andrew Ryan, by Fuad Bey Hamza either, of the o-eo°Taphv of this somewhat Caledonian country, and the Ministei of I inance has had recourse to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for information he admits he at present does not possess. He is, however, clear that the whole of Asir has not been demanded, although the territories to which claim is laid, the tormer territories of the Idrisi, or, roughly, Tihamat Asir, with the districts ot the Beni Qahtan and Hamazan, form the lion's share of the province. Hamazan remains obscure, but Sheikh Abdullah states that it is a district inhabited by a number of tribes, adjoining that of the Beni Qahtan. A perusal of recent press reproductions of parts of Fuad Bey Hamza's book, m so far as Asir is concerned, fails to shed more light, but I think it may be agreed that the approximate territorial demands of the Imam now stand out with sufficient distinctness ioi practical^purpos^ ^. g despatch and enclosure are being sent to His Majesty s Ambassador at Rome, His Majesty’s High Commissioners ^ Jgypt and Transjordan, His Majesty’s Chief Commissioner, Aden, and to the bemoi Naval Officer in the Red Sea sloops. ^ k aye &amp;c aV A.

This h- been confirmed to uS d We have learnt from another source that Soviet ships earned aims ana ammunition to the Yemen coasts. Will the British Government remain neutral in this matter lament of the Idrisi ta kes place in the future, it cannot be regarded as internal movement, because we previously on the hist occasion considered it to be of this nature, but after we granted pardon to the Idi isi in accordance with the request of the Imam Yahya and his undertakings to prevent him (the Idrisi) from taking any hostile action. In this present case of hostile action by the Idrisi in the future, it would mean that he would undoubtedly be encouraged and assisted by the Imam Yahya and supported by the second paitv. We could not keep silent about the source supporting and encouraging this action. 4. We overlooked the incidents of Najran and the violation by the fniam Yahya of our frontiers, and took no action in respect of such aggressions, and all this was by the might and power of God and not through our weakness or failure, but due to our hope to reach a satisfactory solution through our representathes sent to the Yemen. Yahya adopted a disgraceful attitude towards our representa tives and used all manner of rudeness, insolence and excess in his demands. We wish now to take no action before we are certain as to the advice of the British Government and the limit of the connexions they may entertain with incidents which may occur in future. We still await their advice in this connexioL 5. The inability of the Government to repay to the British Government the cost of arms is not due to our negligence or failure, but unavoidable circumstances and general economic conditions are the main reasons for this. We fully believe that the excellent disposition of the British Government is greater than this in view of the friendship existing between us. I therefore request that I may receive as soon as possible the advice of the British Government in respect of the fore going, together with the information which they may have received regarding the attitude of the Italian Government in this connexion.

[E 3612/2/25] No. 1 . Section 2. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—[Received July 4.) (No. 186.) Sir. Jedda, June 18, 1933. WITH reference to my despatch No. 120 o f the 18th April, relative to the situation in Asir, I have the honour to state - that the Umm-al-Qura recently announced the arrival of the Amir Abdul Aziz-bin-Musaid, after completing the organisation of Asir Tihama, or Tihamat Asir, as it appears now to be called for choice. According to a later report he reached Mecca on the 13th June. 2. The Umm-al-Qura devoted a good deal of space to Asir in its numbers of the 9th and 16th June. The article in the issue of the 9th June is worth summarising. The writer reproaches the foreign press with confusion of language in speaking of the theatre of the recent revolt as Asir. He distinguishes between what has hitherto been officially called the Idrisi territory, i.e., Tihamat Asir (so named on the analogy of other tihamas or coastal regions) and what he calls either Asir tout court or Asir-as-Surat. The latter name is unfamiliar to me, but “ Surat” occurs, apparently as a place name, in another recent article in the same paper, which touched on the boundary between Saudi Arabia and Yemen and which I have brought to your notice in a separate despatch. 3. The writer explains that Tihamat Asir corresponds to what was known in Turkish times as the districts of Sabya, Jizan and Abu Arish. He defines it as being bounded on the north by the districts of Qunfida, Birk, Muhail and Rijal-al- Ma (a tribal name, as you know), on the east by Asir-as-Surat or Asir and on the south by the districts of Medi and Haradh; and as having a coastal extension from Qahma to Musim, near the Wadi Ta’shar (cf. my despatch No. 113 of the 14th April). After enumerating the principal localities in the area and the tribes inhabiting it, he refers to the past existence of the two Amirates of Abu Arish and Sabya, the eviction of the Sherif of Abu Arish by Muhammad-al-Idrisi, the eventual appointment of the latter by the Turks as Kaimakam of Sabya, Jizan and Abu Arish and the later disputes which ended in the triumph of the late Idrisi Hasan over his nephew Ali, who was given asylum by Ibn baud. 4 . All this leads up to a brief account of the relations between Ibn Saud and Hasan-al-Idrisi since 1926 culminating in revolt which the Government repressed “without great trouble and without taking strong military measures. The writer refers to knavish suggestions that certain persons may be trying to stir up a further movement. There is no sign, he says, of anything of the sort, as is proved by the return of Ibn Musaid, the demobilisation of the baudi forces, the organisation of a new Administration and the appointment of Amirs. He goes on to say that Tihamat Asir, comprising the three districts already named, is to be governed by an Amir, assisted by a council consisting of the officer commanding troops, the Amir in charge of finance, the Qadhi and seven notables. The baudi Amir at Abha will have a right of supervision. 5. The Umm-al-Qura article of the 16th June is historical and may be intended to be followed by others. It is based mainly on the relevant portion of a general w’ork recently published by Fuad Bey Hamza in Arabic, undei the title, ‘‘ The Heart of the Arabian Peninsula.” It deals at some length with the obscure history of the Sherifs of Abu Arish and the old rivalries between the Turks the Imams of the Yemen and the Bauds for ascendancy in that area. The article i contemporary interest, except in so far as it tends to support the distinction ^ . •u, • .l A out’ T-vywrior arm [851 d—2]elimination has been justified by the revolt of Hasan-al-Idrisi, after he had voluntarily delegated his rights to the King. It will be necessary to bear this thesis in mind in following further negotiations between Ibn Saud and the Imam regarding their frontiers. Both rulers have pretensions in Nejran and Beni Yem area and there have of late been various rumours, unsubstantial, but not lightly to be rejected, of armed activity in that remote region. 6 .

On the 7th Rajah 1346 (1927) when our representatives (Ibn Mady and Ibn Duleim) met those of Imam Yehya in Sanaa, our representatives proposed that the Eastern Frontiers be settled thus - Najran and northwards to belong to King Abdul Aziz and Wayla and southwards to belong to the Imam and that the southern frontier of Assir from inland to the sea was to remain as it was. In the meeting held on the 9th Rajab the Imam’s representatives accepted this settlement except where it related to the Idrissi territory. 2. In a letter from Imam Yehya to King Abdul Aziz in Rabi Than! 1350 (1930-1931) in which the Imam claimed Jebel Aro, he based his claim on the agreement reached with Ibn Mady and Ibn Duleim regarding the irontlers. g. Xn his cable of the 18th Shawwal 1361 (1933) to King Abdul Aziz, the Imam asked that there should be no interference with the Yam, again basing his request on the agreement made with Ibn Mady and Ibn Duleim. 4. The people of Najran have been the subjects of King Abdul Aziz for some time. They *ere also the subjects of his ancestors and still hold the documents they granted to them. These documents have been submitted to King Abdul Aziz and confirmed by him. Indeed ss late as Ramadan 1551 (January 19SB) the people of Najran sent a deputation t IbnXbn vasaid in reari^iruing t-heir submission and renewing their assurances of loyalty. 5. The people of Najran never had any connection with Imam Yehya or any dealings with him until his recent occupation of their land. I may add that His Majesty King Abdul Aziz has just received a cable from his delegation at Sanaa saying that Imam Yehya still insists on being given the Idrissi Territory and that it is their firm belief that he Imam Yehya is bent on agression. Such being the case. King Abdul Aziz awaits the opinion of the British Government. Yours sincerely, (signed) Mahmood R. Zada.a£D «■ . , iwmmi f &gt;Z.

Foreign Office, July 27, 1933. ’ THE Minister of Saudi Arabia, at an interview at this Department on the 21st July, made representations regarding a possible outbreak of hostilities between King Ibn Sand and the Imam of the Yemen, on the same lines as those made to you by the Saudi Arabian Minister of Finance and reported in your telegram No. 140 of the 20th July. 2. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba explained that King Ibn Saud had come to the conclusion that a conflict between himself and the Imam was inevitable. The Imam had opened the negotiations with the Saudi delegation recently sent to Sanaa by demanding the whole of Asir, not for the Idrisi, but for himself. King Ibn Saud was also convinced that the Imam and Italian sources were supplying the Idrisi with arms and munitions preparatory to an attack on Asir, which would be supported by Yemeni troops. The Imam s plan in that event, according to Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, would be to take over Asir from the Idrisi, in the event of the Idrisi’s attempt being successful. An attack by the Idrisi on Asir would thus involve hostilities between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, and in that case King Ibn Saud was determined that it should be in a fight to a finish. &amp; 3. In these circumstances, Sheikh Hafiz Wahba had been instructed b\ King Ibn Saud to ascertain what would be the attitude of His Majesty s Govern ment He realised that there could be no question of FIis Majesty s Government involving themselves in hostilities with the Imam; but King Ibn Saud was anxious to know how far he could count on the moral support of His Majesty s Govern ment and whether it would be possible for them to give him assistance by mean^, for example, of a loan or of the supply of arms on favourable return Kina' Ibn Saud would be prepared to treat all British interests, both in Saudi Arabia and in the Yemen, if he should conquer it with ^ he f f Though he did not say so in so many words, Sheikh Hafiz Mahba appeared desirous of implying that King Ibn “Saud might, in addition to giving His Majesty’s Government satisfaction over British interests generally, be willing offer special^com*^ Wah |, a als0 en q U i re d whether anything could be done to nrevent the Imam and the Idrisi securing arms from Italian sources and to discourage the Italian Government from giving them support in oilier directions, s fhe M nister was informed that the whole situation which he envisaged appeared still quite hypothetical. . The ^^Tlme'd XYE united ill hi^ ronntrv was known to be impoverished; it seemed pnma facie umine t !i!’f n d ^mhark nt this moment on so hazardous an adventure as a war Important that King Ibn Saud should exercise great patience and should do all possiMe to hostilities^ the Italian Government and Italian 6. bo tai as it i n entitled to sell arms and munitions to the private manufacturers were ie to ai ; f e s Imam. It was indeed well considerable influence SeTtfSS InfwLtfer their .ntervention, ^ intervene.^ould to^x^g^mte^ the'important ^'rumours of° Italian assistance to the Imam or to the Idrisi. [851 dd—1]2 \ lW?3 7. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba was informed, in reply to his enquiry as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government that it did not appear possible for them to give King Ibn Sand any material support which would be of use to him, with out themselves becoming involved in hostilities with the Imam, which (as the Minister himself recognised) was out of the question. Moreover, if King Ibn Baud desired His Majesty s Government to exercise then influence with the Italian Government to induce them to observe an attitude of neutrality, it wa ' dear that His Majesty’s Government must themselves remain strictly neutral. 8 . Throughout the interview every opportunity was taken to urge counsels of moderation upon the Minister. It was also suggested to him that an incursion by the Idrisi into Asir, even supported by Yemeni troops, could well be treated bv King Ibn Baud as a rebellion in his own territory and thus as an internal matter,'and that actual hostilities with the Imam might by this means be avoided. 9. 5 At the conclusion of the interview, Sheikh Hafiz Wahba was assured that, while the situation seemed too hypothetical to make it possible for His Majesty’s Government to make any definite pronouncement as to their attitude, the whole question would be most carefully considered and instructions would be sent to you as soon as possible regarding the reply which you should make to the Emir Feisal’s memorandum and to Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman's representations. Subsequently, I addressed to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome my telegram No. 181 of 1 the 24th July, which was repeated to you under No . 93 , and . . *1 , , i n i • /'■'i _ _ J * instructions as to your reply to the Saudi Government were embodied in my .4^7? telegram No. 94 of the 26th July. 10. On the 25th July, the Saudi Arabian Minister again called at this Department. He said that he had reported to King Ibn Saud by telegram the result of his previous interview, and had now received a reply from His Majesty, disclaiming any intention of taking aggressive action against the Imam and containing instructions to convey to me the following supplementary information. 11 . As His Majesty’s Government w^ere aware, an agreement had been reached between King Ibn Saud and the Imam in the winter of 1931-32 regarding | their common frontier, under which His Majesty had abandoned to the Imam | the Jebel Arwa and all the territory to the south of it, retaining the area known as Nejran and all the territory to the north of it in Saudi Arabia. Somewhat later, a further Saudi mission had been sent to the Yemen to negotiate a general treaty settlement. The Imam, on an unconvincing plea of illness, had kept the mission waiting for thirty-five days without receiving it. Meanwhile, the Asir rebellion had broken out, and the Imam began a gradual occupation of Nejran. This Saudi mission had achieved nothing; but, after the suppression of the Asir rebellion, King Ibn Saud had agreed with the Imam to pardon the rebel leaders and to allow the Idrisi to remain as a refugee in the northern Yemen on the condition that the Imam undertook to prevent his intriguing against Saudi Arabia. A third Saudi mission had then been sent to the Yemen to try to reach a general settlement. It was then that the Imam put forward a demand for “ all the Idrisi’s dominions.” This claim was no doubt purposely vague, but King Ibn Saud interpreted it as a demand for the whole of Asir. 12 . There were now two danger points. The first was in the coastal area, where the Idrisi was collecting supporters in Yemeni territory, whence he might at any moment make an incursion into Asir; Sheikh Hafiz Wahba did not, how ever, seem to regard this danger as seriouslv as on the previous occasion. The other danger-point was inland in Nejran; the greater part of Nejran was now occupied by the Imam’s forces. 13. King Ibn Saud regarded Nejran as having been definitely allotted to Saudi Arabia by the frontier arrangement of 1931-32, even though this arrange ment was not a formal treatv. He was now receiving appeals from the people of Nejran, who were suffering from the Yemeni occupation and definitely objected to Zeidi rule. King Ibn Saud could not ignore these appeals, and, unless he took action, Yemeni aggression was likely to continue He therefore felt that he must “ defend ” Nejran and turn out the Yemeni troops. It was preparatory to taking such action that he desired to know the views and attitude of His Majesty’s Government. 14. This latest information communicated by the Saudi Minister appears to put the matter in a somewhat new light. The frontier arrangement of 1931-32 ^ was apparently a vague one. and it is not clear, either from the information supplied by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba or from that given to Sir Andrew Ryan by Fuad3 (S&gt; Bey Hamza and reported in Sir Andrew’s despatches Nos. 168 and 193 of the 5th June and the 23rd June respectively, that King Ibn Sand’s claim that Nejran is definitely to be considered as Saudi territory can necessarily be accepted as indisputable. It is to be observed that no reference to a settlement on this point is contained in the official Saudi proclamation regarding the results of the negotiations of 1931, a translation of which was enclosed in Sir Andrew Ryan’s 4 ^patch No. 486 of the 19th December, 1931. Nor does it appear, from the information at my disposal, that Nejran had in fact been in the effective occu pation either of King Ibn Saud or of the Imam in recent years. It is, therefore, not absolutely clear that King Ibn Saifd, in contemplating the ejection of the Yemeni troops from Nejran, can in fact be considered to be defending what is indisputably his own territory in the same way as would be the case if it were a question of resisting a Yemeni or Idrisi incursion into territory in his effective occupation. It may, indeed, be that it would be more correct to regard such action by King Ibn Saud as an attempt to occupy territory, the ownership of which has hitherto been doubtful. Without further information, however, as to the status and recent history of Nejran it is somewhat difficult to express an opinion on this point. 15. Before taking his leave. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba reverted to the enquiries which he had made at the interview recorded in the earlier part of this despatch, as to the assistance which His Majesty’s Government might be able to give to King Ibn Saud. He explained that His Majesty had in mind an understanding “between himself and His Majesty’s Government—which should, however, be kept strictly secret—by which His Majesty’s Government would promise him their moral support and he, on his side, should guarantee all British interests in the Yemen should he prove successful against the Imam. In reply to this statement, the Minister was informed that the arrangement proposed would be something very like an alliance between the two countries. 8 heikh Hafiz Wahba replied that King Ibn Saud did not expect armed assistance from His Majesty’s Government, but only desired material help in two directions, namely, a loan and the supply of arms. 16. The Minister was informed that, as he was aware, the question oi a loan to the Saudi Government was most carefully and sympathetically examined last vear, when the matter was raised here by the Saudi mission headed b\ the Emir Feisal, and that it had then been found impossible to accede to the Saudi Government’s request. The position in this matter was unchanged. As regards the supply of arms, there was no reason, as Sheikh Hafiz \\ ahba knew, why the Saudi Government should not buy arms from the manufacturers whenever and wherever they wished. It appeared, however, that King Ibn Sau ac suggesting that His Majesty’s Government should arrange the supply to him ot arms on especially favourable terms (to this the Minister agreed); this suggestion appeared to amount in fact to a request for financial facilities m a i ere &gt; and the reply of His Majesty’s Government could only be the same as that w they had been obliged to make to the Saudi Government s re ff 1 ^ a JOHN SIMON.I*©-. % 40Ta/7B0/B6, 1,1 I 5 .

Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman stated that negotiations ao Sanaa finally conrnenced July 17th but excessive demands of Imam delegate for restitution of Idrisi territory led to immediate rupture, though not to withdrawal of Saudi delegation. Ibn Sand, disquieted for some time by hostility of imam forces against local tribes in Neyran, has utmost distrust of Imam, whom this message and note accuses ox baa faith and wilful provocation* Sh^'kh Abdullah Sileiman whilst alluding to inrisi activities, strongly hinted at 'outside influence' at work arid stated that arms and supplies had recently been landed 'from abroad' on Yemen coast.

Sir \ r ith reference to paragraph 4 of ay despatch Ho. 162 of June 2nd, I have the honour to state that I ascertained from ?uad Bey Hamza in conversation on June 4th that the mieston which is supposed to have settled in principle the frontier In the interior between T Asir and the Yemen was in fact that which I had in mind. I find that I was mistaken in saying that It had been sent early in 1938. It would appear to have gone to San f a in the summer of 19£7, as will be seen by reference to paragraph 10 of the m/t' Jedda Report for June 1927. 2. The Jedda Report just quoted speaks of the mission as having been composed of Abdul- alihab Abu Malha, Said ibn Abdul-Aziz ibn Musheyt and *♦ Abdullah ibn Turk! ibn Mahdl. w Fuad Bey tells me that the late Muhammad ibn 3&gt;ileym was also a member of the mission and that the person who was described as Abdullah ibn Turk! Ibn Mahdi is identical with the Turk! ibn or al Mahdi, who has recently been employed in ’Asir and is a member of the present mission to San 1 a. 3. I have attached importance to clearing up this matter because of the stress laid by the Sa’ddi Government on their contention that the frontier inland was settled in principle eev ral years ago. It is worth noting that ihe 19.7 mission, if Fuad Bey’s information is correct, included two important tribal chiefs, viz. ,ibn Dileym (or The Right Hon urabl© Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., K.C.V.O, , etc., etc., etctaair xl 9X14 rei aiMr Mail wet « ,V3€I (op iton .i)hulei* t ps he ie called In Personalities, Arable, 1917, q*v # at p# 36) and ibn Muahagrt (do.pp.^ and 96).

Turk! al Madhi was already enmloyed as Inspector General in f Asir and shared the misfortu ies of the Governor when the rebels took Jlz&amp;n in November. The mlasl n may be regarded as a fairly strong one, as Khalid al arqani, an ex-rebel In Tripolitania who has been in the King's service for some three years, is said to be a man of ability and characterj Hamad Suleyman is brother to the Minister of Finance; and al-Ma di would appear to be a specialist in ’Astr and Yemen affairs# 3e An official commmicua of May f4th, published in ' the ’GnM-al-Qura' of May 6 th, specifically states that the object of the mission is to negotiate a Treaty of Friendship and Bon Voisinage. This is of some interest in view of reports Lght Honourable Sir John Bimon, G.C.S.X., K.C.V.- ., etc. , etc. , etc*report* from San’a that the Imam regarded the agreement of December 15th, 1931 as a mere local understanding, whereas the Ba*udi Government have always represented it as a regular treaty of friendship, Bon Voieinage and extradition. 4. nisi is more important, however, is the evident fact that on this occasion the Imam is out for a frontier settlement and may, owing to his dissatisfaction with the recent course of event* in v A*fa, want more than Ihn sa f ud is prepared to concede. 1 need not trouble you with the whole of the article in the M Um- al- ura of May ^th to whieh I have referred in ay Savingraa und r reference. The explanation given of the omission in the previous issue of February 17th of a material passage in the Imam T s letter there quoted is lame and shows great anxiety to placate. I enclose a translation of the concluding portion which gives the Sa'ftdl version of previous arrangements in regard to the frontier. Reference is a^ain made to the former mission in which the late Muhammad ibn Dileym and al-Madhl took part. I am now inclined to identify this with the mission sent by Ibn Sa^d to San* a early in 1988 but I am uncertain on the point as my account* of that mission do not mention ibn Dileya. The other reference to previous negotiation* is les* obscure, a* the settlement of the Jebel Area dis ute in December 1931 is still a matter of recent memory. That settlement is evidently held to have implied a determination of the frontier inland from the coast betw ea Jlz&amp;n and Medi, although in the Treaty signed at Abu Arish immediately afterwards no reference was made to frontiers. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to His Majesty 1 s Gommlssi ner at Aden and the Senior Naval Officer in the Red Sea Sloops? also, with copies of my SavingramSavingram under reference, to Hie Majesty*• High Coaralsstonere at Cairo and Jerusalem, I have, etc,, (Sd,) AHDT1CT RYAN.

It might be thought that these were important dismtes on the question of frontiers, but the plain fact is that there acre nothing of this sort, and the question of frontiers was a few years ago settled in orinciple. Frontiers from Sur&amp;t to the interior were limited when the delegation of His Majesty the King visited San*a presided by Ibn Deleya and Turfci al Madhi* It was t .ea decided that the Yemen frontiers extended north to the end of the territories of Kh&amp;l&amp;n ash-Shfim, and that the frontiers of the Sa’ftdl Arab Kingdom extended from there to the north. As regards Tihama there was no difficult dispute also. The frontier line has finally been accepted after His Majesty 9 s arbitration in the matter of f Arw* The parts lying south of it belong to Yemen and those lying north of it belong to the Sa’udi Arab Kingdom* The &lt; uestion of the frontiers in the letter of the I man Yahya was only mentioned as far as we believe, to express the necessity of specifying the places through which the frontier line passes on the ground, so that there will be no room for any doubt about the ownership of any tribe, valley or mountain to either side* l e therefore beg to reassure all our Arab brethren* (COPY (E 3747/769/25) I No. 193.

He referred to report* of military activity on the Yemeni side and appeared to think that the Yemenis were active in the Beni Yam country- His Government, he said, had no confirmation of other reports which had appeared in the press to the effect that the Yemenis were active in Nejran. 3. Fuad Bey ex lained that the settlement effected when an earlier Sa’udi mission vent to San’a in 1927 gave the Beni Yam or the bulk of them to the Imam but gave Nejran to Ibn Sa’dd* On my remarking that I had difflcjulty in grasping the relative meanings of the word hejran, which I understood to be a geographical name and the words Beni Yam, which I understood to be the name of a ght Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., K.C.V.O., etc., etc., etc*f ( . 7 n t Ot i.n ribe # he said that the geographical area aBBOciated ^Ith the Beni Yarn was J&amp;uf. 4, Fuad Bey 1 b placing of the Beni Yam does not seem to agree with that In the Handbook of Arabia, but if the dispute between Ibn Sa f fld and the Imam relates to the two geographical areas of Nejran and Jauf as described in page 176 ff. of Volume I of that work, the matter becomes more Intel igible. Fuad Bey repeated what has been said so often about the apparent correctness ol the la&amp;m but he was obviously worried by the rumours of his activity in He^ran. He intimated that if the Yemeni activities did In fact extend to that area the situation would be serious* There may be something in these forebodings having regard to the references to the inland situation in recent report?^from Aden.

Sir, Jedda, Ayril 18, 1933. 3 WITH reference to my telegram N o. 68 of the 17th April, I have the honour to transmit herewith translations of two communiques about Asir, published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 31st March and the 14th April. You will see by the second that the question of the disposal of Hasan-al-Idrisi has been settled in a manner very favourable to him. When speaking to me on the subject on the 15th April, Fuad Bey expatiated on the King’s longanimity and generosity. I admitted the justice of these praises, adding that the King had also shown qualities of statesmanship, of which generosity was a part. This was not insincere, but the fact remains that His Majesty’s display of statesmanship on this occasion indicates readiness to go to great lengths to avoid a quarrel with the Imam. It is also possible that he believes, on reflexion, that Hasan-al-Idrisi will be less dangerous as an exile in the Yemen than if he returned under any conditions which left him free to tamper directly with tribes in Asir. 2. Fuad Bey emphasised the point that Asir would not be governed as before, but as “ Asir Tihama,” meaning that it would become a province under that name. He added, confidentially, that the King s cousin, Abdul Aziz-bin- Musaid, would not remain there permanently, as was at one time expected, and that it was intended to make Turki-as-Sdayri, at present Governor of Jauf-Skaka, Governor-General of the whole of Asir, to reside at Abha, with a subordinate Governor at Jizan. . . , 3 . The second of the enclosed communiques expresses the expectation that Abdui Wahhab Idrisi, the brother of Hasan and one of the prime movers in the revolt in Asir. will return with other ex-rebels to Saudi Arabia I doubt whether this expectation will be fulfilled, but I can hardly suppose that Ibn baud having yielded in the case of Hasan, will quarrel with the Imam over Abdul Wahhab, &amp;c. It looks (a) as though the situation m Asir had been stabilised at anv rate for the time being, and {b) as though any danger of conflict m the near future between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen had been averted 4.

Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Extract from the Mecca Umm-al-Qura of April 14, 1933. Official Communique from the Press Department. (Translation.) THE Government have previously announced that no traces of the insurrec tion which was fomented by conspirators still remain in the Asir Tihama, may praise be to God. The fugitive tribesmen have returned to their own districts, the situation has been restored to normal and the markets of the tribes have been opened as usual; orders have therefore been issued to the additional military forces to return. The Amir Abdul Aziz-bin-Musaid will shortly return to Abha after completion of the contemplated administrative reorganisation. His Highness the Imam Yahya has approached His Majesty the King with a view to obtaining pardon from him for Seyyid Hasan-al-Idrisi, and His Majesty had agreed to this. His Highness has again approached him to get permission for Seyyid-al-Hasan to choose a place to settle in, according to his wishes. Despite the explicit terms of the treaty concluded between His Majesty the King and His Highness the Imam Yahya, which require that Seyyid-al-Hasan and others should be handed over, His Majesty the King has taken account of the sincere friendship existing between him and His Highness the Imam Yahya, and has desired not to refuse his request, His Highness having given an understanding to His Majesty the King that As Seyyid will behave well and will remain under his supervision and control. Furthermore, in consideration of the rank of the Idrisi’s family and the long-standing connexions which have existed between that family and the Saudi family, His Majesty the King has not wished to coerce them, especially as His Majesty by the might of God has no fear of Seyyid or anybody else, whether he stay in his territory or elsewhere. For these reasons His Majesty has accepted the undertakings of His Highness the Imam Yahya, and has given him right to choose whatever place he thinks fit for Hasan Idrisi to settle in. His Highness the Imam Yahya has asked His Majesty the King to be kind to the family of the Idrisi, as they are in a state of destitution, and to grant them a certain competence. His Majesty has therefore issued orders to pay Seyyid-al-Hasan-al-Idrisi a pension of 2,000 riyals monthly for his livelihood. It is expected that Seyyid Abdul Wahhab-al-Idrisi and all his companions will submit and return and that none will stay with A1 Hasan except his family, in view of the general amnesty which has been granted.In any further communication on this subject, please quote N °. /r and address —not to any pers, null wll mia auujCdj |liCclbC ty person bynAie, but j “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign (Jfice, London, S.W.

IN paragraph 5 of my despatch NqJ 23 of the 17th January, I stated that, so far as I could make out, the frontier between Azir and the Yemen appeared to abut on the sea at the mouth of the Wadi Tashar and to run inland in a dilection which I proceeded to indicate. On re-reading the relevant papers I find that 1 was probably too guarded as regards the terminal on the sea. Although it is quite uncertain whether the frontier has been agreed as regards its whole length and certain that it has not been delimited, the Saudi official communique published on the 6 th January and forwarded with my printed despatch No. _ld_of—the 8 th January, speaks definitely of the Wadi Tashar, to which the Saudi troops claimed to have advanced, as being the furthest district on the coast. It may therefore be assumed that the mouth of the Wadi in question is the boundary point in the eyes of the Saudi Government and the Government of the Yemen probably take the same view. 2 . I think it worth while to draw attention to this point, even though it is unlikely to have escaped you, as it may be important for naval purposes to have a definite indication of the coastal point at which Saudi Arabia ends and the Yemen begins. In this connexion I may add that I now learn privately from the commanding officer of H.M.S. Penzance that the Island of Ashik, which I mentioned in paragraph 5 of the enclosure in my despatch No. 104 of the 9th April regarding naval visits to the Farsan Islands, &amp;c., lies off the coast 30 miles south of Jizan, 11 miles north-north-west of Medi and about 2 miles south of the mouth of the Wadi Tashar. 3.

HIS Majesty’s Minister at Jedda presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit to him copy of his minute of the 26th instant respecting a conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza on the subject of the rebellion in Asir. Jedda, December 29, 1932. Enclosure in No. 1 . Minute by Sir A. Ryan. FUAD BEY HAMZA called this morning for the first time since my return. After politesses of some length, I asked about the news from Asir. He said that all was well north of a line inland from Madhaya, a small port some 25 kilom. south of Jizan. It had been necessary to administer punishment to the Njua tribe (presumably the Naj’u described in Handbook of Arabia, I, 441), some hundreds of whom had been killed. I understood Fuad to be confirming what Hafiz Wahba had told me on the 23rd December, namely, that the troops had reached Sabya after fighting. These are the troops of Khalid-bin-Luwey’s column, but Fuad said that Khalid himself had died (of illness, he said) on the march from Abha. Fuad said that the country from the above line southward to the frontier had still to be pacified owing to the uncertain activities of the Masariha and other tribes in the Abu Aris region. Hasan-al-Idrisi was with the Masariha. On my mentioning Ibn Musa’ad, he said that he was still at Abha. He was to be appointed Governor-General of the whole area and would be replaced in the Governorate of Hail, which was at present held by an acting man. 2. Fuad said that he had never attached any importance to the Asir rebellion, which would simply end in the death of several hundred tribesmen and the widowhood of as many women, but he wished to speak of another aspect which might be of more interest to me, viz., the attitude of the Italians, with whom His Majesty’s Government had an understanding about Arabia. He said that on Wednesday, the 21st December last, an Italian sloop, the name of which he could not give, had put in at Jizan without previous notice of any kind. After some hesitation over the establishment of contact in those conditions, the local Governor had seen the commander and had pointed out to him the impropriety of the visit. On this the sloop left on Thursday afternoon, but only to go into other territorial waters, those of the Farsan islands, and thence to a small island off Madhaya, where it spent the night. Next day, Friday, the 23rd, she visited Madhaya twice at an interval of some hours. The Saudi Government regarded their proceedings as a gross breach of international practice and had taken the matter up strongly with the Italian Minister here, who was in communication with Rome. Signor de Peppo had expressed the view that the proceedings of the sloop had not taken place under authority from his Government. If this proved to be the ^ would diminish without destroying the importance of the affair. Fuad said that he had the King’s instructions to communicate the facts to me. I said I would note them and convev the communication to His Majesty s Government, but could not comment on the action of friendly foreign authorities. 3. Fuad Bey spoke at some length of other external activities behind the Asir affair and, replying to a question by me, said that they were an important factor in it. He did not openly accuse the Italians of complicity, but what he [683 s—1]2 In said was obviously directed against them to a large extent. He spoke, inter alia, of the role of Seyyid Marghani-al-Idrisi, who had been an Italian agent in the Ihe past, had helped the Saudi Government in traming up the treaty with Asir in 1926, and had subsequently reverted to his role of Italian agent. He spoke in the same connexion of the Ad Dabbagh machinations, and mentioned various people whose names are familiar to us, including that oi Abdun auf-as-Sabban, who had attended a meeting of the principal conspirators at Amman last May, and Muhammad Amin-ash-Shanqiti, who he told me was a man of Moorish origin, ^ formerly resident at Mecca. 4 . ' I told Fuad Bey that I had been concerned about the activities of the Ad Dabbaghs since early in the year, when Sheikh Yusuf Yasin had first spoken to me about the procedings of Husein-ad-Uabbagh. At that time it was only a question of publications, and I had made reservations regarding the invocation by Sheikh Yusuf of article 2 of the Treaty of Jedda, but had taken the matter up with Aden. It had been discovered that the Ad Dabbaghs were in fact engaged in subversive schemes and, as he already knew, action had been taken to eliminate them from Aden. I understood also, I said, though I could make no official communication, that Abdurrauf-as-Sabban, who seemed to have been in communication with the conspirators, had been dismissed from his post in Trans jordan. Having just come from London, I said, I wished to assure Fuad Bey, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the King that there was no change in the policy of His Majesty’s Government, which was to prevent, as far as they were concerned, any use of their territory as a base of hostile activities. I mentioned, as a further instance, that I had taken advantage of my recent visit to the Sudan to assure myself that the conspirators were not making use of that country. 1 repeated that Fuad Bey would not expect me to offer my comments on anything he had said about the Italians. As for myself, my principal interest in the matter was a desire that nothing should stand in the way of the object that he ^ and I had at heart, namely, the establishment of a sounder position between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan. I was anxious that the situation should not be clouded by an “ atmosphere of suspicion,” stressing this phrase as meaning that /y&lt;j 2&gt; I was not prepared to endorse the Saudi view that there were grounds for more than suspicion, but that the mere existence of such an atmosphere was detrimental ? to the purpose which His Majesty’s Government were pursuing steadfastly, even though recent events might complicate matters. 5. Fuad Bey said he had arranged to return to Mecca in the afternoon, but hoped to return to Jedda early in Ramadan. I said that I was glad to have had a general discussion with him, but that I had not yet had time to study all my files, and that I also wished to consult His Majesty’s Government on one or two points. It would suit me very well, I said, to continue our conversation any time after the 1 st January. December 26, 1932. A.

He said that the King had told him to inform me privately of what had passed with the Italian Government. The latter had explained that they were confronted with contradictory versions of the position in Asir . The Idr..si had made public announcements that he had reestablished his g'v&gt; The Right Honourable, Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I.^-b.V.G*,, etc etc*, etc *internal Arabian oongarn. They admitted that there had been a breach of international practice in the natter of the sloop but asked that in the circumstances It should not be pursued« The Xing did not wish to make a fuss, so in view of the explanations afforded, friendly relations had been restored and the incident was closed. The Italians had raised a question of compensation for two Italian subjects but had dropped this* 3, Fuad Bey’s language was not precise at all points and I did not wish to question him. I think, however, that the preceding paragraph sums up fairly accurately what he said* He made no reference to any expression of vievi/s by the Italian Government regarding Ibn da 8 ud # s rights in f Aslr but his language implied that they had at least not questioned them. 4, I expressed pleasure at the liquidation of the incident. I repeated that I preferred not to offer any comments but said I should like to refer to two matters of fact. My attention had been drawn (by the Italian Minister, 1 added in confidence) to reports that a British warship had visited Jisan and that early in the revolt British aeroplanes had flown over u A.slr. From the outset x considered the first reoort impossible, as I knew the movements of the only two British sloops in the ned Jea, and I considered the second simply fantastic. I had never~ theiess thought it worth while to check the reports and had ascertained, as I expected, that they were unfounded.

E 79/2/25] No. 1 . Mr. Hope Gill to Sir John Simon.—(Received January 4, 1933.) (No. 480.) Sir, Jedda, December 17, 1932. WITH reference to my telegram No. 220 of the 1 st December regarding the rebellion in Asir, I have 'the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a lengthy extract from the Umm-al-Qura of the 2nd December entitled “ The Jizan Affair ” and of a short communique published in the same paper’s issue of the 9th December under the heading “ News of Events at Jizan.’’Q These documents bring up to date the history of the Asir revolt as seen from the point of view of Saudi publicity. But there is a mass of fact and motive behind them which is at present hidden. Some I have been able to gather from other sources; the rest can only be conjectured. The present is a suitable moment to attempt an interim survey. 2. The Province of Asir has for some years been commonly regarded as a likely source of trouble for Ibn Saud, but generally in connexion with the Yemen and the steps which the Imam Yahya might be expected to take to recover a territory which some have supposed to have been filched from him. Trouble has but seldom been foreseen in connexion with the tribes of Asir itself and never yet in connexion with the attitude of its present ruler, the Idrisi. He and his tribesmen could have been likened to fat trout in a pool, lorded over by a not-too-voracious pike, but both watched by a hungry old pike No. 2 lying in the border reeds. 3. The expected has not yet happened and, as far as I at present know (though there are increasing rumours to the contrary),^ pike No. 2 is still motionless. It is the trout who are up in arms and pike No. 1 is busy trying to eat them up. It is difficult to say just what roused them. Asir is a relatively thickly populated country (say, 1 million) and moderately rich in agucultuie, lying as it does in the northern fringe of Arabia Felix. It has been the fashion in flip TTpiny and pvpti A.monffst its more disgruntled inhabitants, impatient o (O printed. [683 d—21» in 2 1 about September last, having either completely failed to make headway earlier in the year or having been forestalled and thrown out of gear by the untimely opening of the Ibn Rifada show. I lean to the former view, supposing that had they made any headway they might well have expedited then pi ogramme during the two months for which Ibn Rifada lasted, but that internal conditions in Asir were not sufficiently favourable then. However that may be it is clear from the various sources of information that the Dabbagh branch of the Hejazi Liberal »arty has had a considerable hand in the present revolt. It may have been the^ prime mover, but it is more likely only to have supplied opportune assistants who were in a position to introduce a certain directive force, a few aims and a little money (though it is said that Asir has no need of arms), the promise of much more and encouragement to look for moral support and perhaps future freedom from the Amir Abdullah ; whether or not his name was taken in vain there is no present means of judging. But it is to be noted that the Imam Yahya has, so far. either had nothing to do with this revolt or has hidden his tracks very cleverly. I suspect, the latter. , „ • . 5.' Turning to the attached papers, which are chiefly interesting for the light they throw on Saudi methods and mentality, one finds that in the “ Introduction, pp. 1 and 2, the writer (who may be Sheikh ^ ussuf \asin) is at pains to convince that any revolt against Ibn Sand is a revolt against Islam and the Arabs, but he was premature in stating that the Idrisi had already come to his due end of “destruction apd annihilation.” In the ‘Beginning of the Affair,” pp. 3 and 4, he stresses ad nauseam Ibn Sand’s magnificent patience, which might, however, from the evidence here given, be more properly qualified as criminal negligence, a point to which I will recur later. Passing over for the purposes of this despatch the writer’s account of the “ Conspirators’ Objects and Plan,” pp. 4 to 6 . we find at the bottom of p. 6 what was apparently the Saudi Governor’s first note of warning of trouble in Asir in a telegram to Ibn Saud dated the 26th September. He makes here the only unfriendly reference to the Imam Yahya which is made throughout the exchanges of telegrams which now follow, reporting that he was said to be mobilising troops to send either against Jizan or the Beni Hasan (one of his own tribes). (But the Imam seems to have been always mobilising troops these past three years; to have kept people guessing.) The Governor is also suspicious of a change of heart in the Idrisi. “since before the Ibn Rifada rebellion,” but this last may be an editorial interpellation; the whole series of telegrams shows, to my mind, signs of having been heavily edited for publicity. Ibn Baud’s reply of the 29th September, for instance, on p. 7, is much too good to be true. Down to “ so I ask you to be kind and gentle to the Idrisi ” was almost certainly written ex post facto, but the final “ If he has evil intention, God will cause him to be defeated, while if what is said is false, it is in the nature of most rumour ” rings true. 6 . For a month after this exchange of warning and precept there seems to have been no further cause for alarm, so far as can be judged from the one-sided evidence here given, but on the 27th October began a rapid exchange of telegrams pp. 8 to 13, comprising increasingly serious reports from Saudi officials at Jizan, which end on the 5th November with the words “ we have enough water for some days and upon God we rely,” when they were besieged, and uniformly placid replies from Ibn Saud, of which that of the 1st November is typical; “ Accept the Idrisi s apologies and show him the greatest respect. Facts must become known. Be very careful to show him respect and regard.” (On the 6 th Jizan capitulated to the Idrisi). It is difficult to understand Ibn Sand’s attitude, unless it was due to extreme caution bred of fear that any warlike preparation on his part might bring the Imam openly into the field against him. His telegi ams as published show him to have been pacifist to a degree which allowed the initial stages of revolt to develop unchecked. If they are apocryphal, as seems probable, the fact remains that he appears to have taken no action to forestall the trouble so clearly foreseen and reported by his officials. Fie had ven few troops in Asir, it is true. About the 25th October his armoured car detach ment, which had been stationed in Asir since the Jabal Arwa trouble of last year, had actually returned to Mecca. If as much attention was not paid as prominence has been given to conspiratorial activities in Asir, Ibn Saud must bo accounted either as a very negligent commander or as fearful of rousing the Imam or as inviting revolt for ulterior purposes of his own.3 7. Before leaving the telegrams on pp. 7 to 13, two exchanged between Ibn baud and the Idnsi may he noted. The latter’s, of the 28th October is brief and asks why his nephew. Ah, had left Mecca. Ibn Sand’s long reply of the 29th October explains that Ah is a danger to his uncle and that therefore Ibn baud was keeping him with him as one of his own sons and had taken him to Riyadh. 8 . It was not until the 5th November, the day Jizan was attacked, that the mission, comprising Sheikh Hamad Suleiman, Under-Secretary of Finance, and Khalid Be\ A1 Qarqani, a 1 ripolitan exile, who is anti-Italian and has long had friendly relations with the Idrisi, set out from Jedda to investigate the Idrisi's complaints, although it seems probable from internal evidence that these complaints had been made to Ibn Saud some time previously. It was not until the 6 th November, the day Jizan fell, that the first reinforcements left for the south, by car by way of Jedda and the coast road. It is a bad track and some 450 miles to Jizan. At the same time Shereef Khalid-bin-Luwey set out from I uraba for Abha, accompanied by a nephew of Ibn Saud, his sister’s son, Abdul Aziz-bin-Musaid, and collecting tribal contingents under their war standards on his way to an estimated total of about 5,000 camelmen. He apparently did not reach Abha until the 25th November, or even later. The crow-flight distance is 200 miles. About the 25th November a similar force left Riyadh under the Amir Khalid-bin-Muhammad, eldest son of Ibn Saud’s elder brother. From the 6 th November to the end of the month some 2,000 reinforce ments continued to flow through Jedda, composed mostly of regular troops from the town garrisons, but with some street-loafer mercenaries too, and accompanied by several hundred lorry-loads of arms and ammunition. Some of the earlier contingents went by dhows and two Government launches, and one of the last by a specially-chartered German ship, which spent ten days for its pains on a reef off Jizan. On the 17th November the coastal corps retook Jizan, also Sabya. On the 23rd, there seems to have been a general counter-attack by the rebels, of the results of which reports are still very contradictory. The revolt, meanwhile, seems to have become widespread and general, and the Saudi columns have made very slow, if any, progress. The last communique, dated the 9th December and attached atp. 22 , stated that the column “ charged with the liquidation of any vestige of insur rection in the coastal region of Asir ' was then at full strength and at Jirzan and Sabya; there are, I think, no more regular troops that can be spared, the last contingent of all which passed through Jedda in early December having been composed of tribesmen from Nejd. The communique placed Shereef Khalid-bin- Luwey still at Abha and stated that letters had been sent to all the tribes and the Idrisi himself, inviting them to surrender within six days. In spite, therefore, of the tenor of the telegrams exchanged between Ibn Saud and the Idrisi and given on pp. 14 to 17, the latter had consistently been deceiving Ibn Saud, had made his hay while the sun shone, and was still at large. The communique made no mention of the force from Riyadh under the Amir Khalid-bin-Muhanunad. Such information as I have regarding it is non-official, though reasonably reliable. 1 am inclined to think that it may be the nucleus of a much larger Nejdi force destined to strike at Sana from the east if and when the Imam Yahya shows his hand. 9 . The last point to which I would draw attention in this despatch is the curious exchange of telegrams between Ibn Saud and the Imam Y ahya, repro duced on pp. 18 and 19. The Imam’s telegram of the 15th November was either very corruptly received or has been rewritten for publication, for its Arabic is poor and ungrammatical and is well below his normal standard. 1 he Imam tells Ibn Saud that the Saudi Governor of Jizan had taken refuge at Midi whence he had given orders that he should be driven out. The next issue of the t mm a - Qura tries to put things right by explaining that the telegram was corrupt an that what the Imam had really said was that the Idrisi had taken at 1 J*; 1 ’ and that he (the Imam) had given orders that the Saudi Amir should, it possible, be released; which explanation holds no water, for Jizan was not retaken un i two days after the Imam sent his telegram, if its date is conecthy given, o i i £» T »n fuk otiil in iVip THrisi’s hands. Be that as it may. tne Imam goes on to preach patience to Ibn Saud reminding nim inai nasue i* m uir devil, and warning him against the “ deceits of foreigner^, with speeia men ion of the fate of four places which the French now hold, fez, Tunis, Algiers an't fi Syria and of one in the Yemen which Aelius Gallus took in the days of Cssar Augustus: so tactful is the old Imam and so careful to avoid direct reference to the English and the modern Italians If nis telegi am is a masteipiece, so also islbn Sand's reply sent after the retaking of Jizan. He equally tactfully reminds the Iman that it was the Idrisi who, in the first instance, sought his, Ibn Sand's, protection, that Asir, in fact, is a Saudi protectorate and that his concentration of forces is purely precautionary, tor use against just such foreign interference, in fact, as that to which his brother nad referred It cannot seriously thought that these two rulers really feai a Bntish or Italian landing. They use this fantasy as a comely veil to their rival skirmishes for position. It may be taken for granted that they are watching each other very carefully. A false move on either side might lead to wai.

II I do not spealc frankly His Majesty^s Government may be suspected of secret hostility or at least of waiting on events in Asir possibly in collusion with Italiansc As Saudi Government already know from other sources of action taken at Aden I mentioned it to Fuad as proof of determination of His Majesty's Government to prevent use of British territory for subversive activities. I added unofficially that I believed Abdurrauf Sabban to have been dismissed. I assured Fuad that attitude of His Majesty's Government towards Ibn Saud was unchanged. I sm disappointed to learn from High Commissioner's 1 31 egrems Nos. 169 and 170 how greatly lack of strict legal evidence stands in the way ox really effective action against principal persons hostile to Ihn Saud e.g. Shamr and Hamid al Wadi who though now possessed of Transjordan nationality are of Hejaz and Iraq origin respectively. I should have thought there was enough against than to justify dismissal from posts even if legal considerations precluded deportation. Assuming however that nothing more/2 . rccrs can be done I ask for authority when I see Fuad to make the most ot measures taken in Aden as regards Debbaghs and in Transjordan as regards Sabban and Beni Atofya leaders. I attach Importance to my being placed in a position to act as above notwithstanding High Commissioner's confidence in improbability of Akhwan invasion and in certainty of victory if it should take place. I do not myself think such invasion is imminent danger so long as situation in the South remains doubtful but the King if completely dissatisfied might resort to it later. Events of last summer proved that he can colie-o lar &amp; e forces Akhwan when it suits him. and that nothing would appeal to them so much as to be allowed to cross the frontier.In any, further communication on this tubject, please luote — No £(3 and address —not to any person bypiame, but to— The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

December 7, 1932. CONFIDENTIAL Section 1. 6455/5839/25] No. 1. Mr. Hope Gill to Sir John Simon.—{Received December 7.) (No. 450.) Sir, Jedda, November 17, 1932. WITH reference to my telegram No. 204 of to-day regarding the situation in Asir, I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a memorandum which the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs handed yesterday to me and, I think, to my Italian colleague, and possibly to other colleagues also. It will no doubt be published in the Mecca press. 2. It recalls the steps by which the entire administration of Asir was eventually handed over by the Idrisi to Ibn Sand in 1930, affirms that since then peace and prosperity have reigned, but admits that friction has recently been caused between the Idrisi and Ibn Saud’s Amir or Governor. The friction is stated to be purely personal, however, but so intense as to have caused the Idrisi to appeal to Ibn Saud, with protests of loyalty, to change his Amir. The memorandum concludes with the information that a committee of enquiry has been ordered, and by expressing the hope that there will be no need for military operations. 3 . If neither the Imam Yahya nor armed and moneyed Hejazi conspirators of the Dabbagh gang are behind the Idrisi, these hopes may well be justified, for strong Saudi reinforcements have been despatched by sea and from the interior. The former are standing by at Qunfida by Ibn ^aud s orders, the latter, under Khalid-bin-Luwey, are further inland, while the committee of investigation, comprising Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman’s brother Hamid and the Tnpolitan Khalid-al-Qarqani, are approaching Jizan. The garrison of this place, undei Ibn Saud’s Amir, is thought to have now surrendered to the Idrisi alter being besieged, waterless, in the old Turkish fort which overlooks the town, but their wireless station has apparently been damaged and the Government have no certain news of them. , . , ^ 4 . 1 , 4.

[655 g-1]2 of the old anarchy. No complaint was made against the dispositions of the Amirs and officials who, in accordance with the Royal instructions, have had all possible regard for the position and honour of Sayyid-al-Hasan. It appears that personal friction has come between Sayyid-al-Hasan and the present Amir, Fahd-bin- Zuair, caused, according to the allegations of the former, by the fact that the latter thinks little of him, and does not appear before him with due respect nor dutiful to his person and position. 3. It seems that some who have selfish objects and wish to fish in troubled. &gt; waters took occasion of this personal friction to intrigue between Sayyid-al- Hasan and the Amir, that both of them, according to the documents which it has hitherto been possible to obtain, now regard each other with very different eyes, and that the Amir has tried to interfere with Sayyid-al-Hasan in matters not mentioned in the text of his instructions. The Sayyid has protested and complained of the Amir’s ill will towards him in the following matters First. —Ill-treatment by the Amir, in that the Amir does not show the respect due to his position, and that he does not speak politely to him. Second .—That the Amir places obstacles in the way of the regular payment of Sayyid-al-Hasan’s allowances, and that he does not help him when he complains. Third .—That the Amir opposes his meeting certain tribesmen who f belong to him. Fourth .—That the Amir forbade mention of the name of Sayyid-al- Hasan in the Friday prayer. Fifth .—That the Amir prevents the Sayyid from flying his private flag. Sixth .—That he refuses to consider the question of reducing customs dues in the port of Jizan in response to the general financial crisis. 4. The Government of His Majesty the King being desirous to put things right before harm is spread and before rogues blow the fire of insurrection, have thought it best to be ready for emergency, and to place at the disposal of the authorities in that locality the military forces required to keep peace and restore order if necessary, pending the completion of close enquiries into the complaints referred to above. It now seems to them that they need not be worried, and that i the matter is much simpler than they first thought. 5. Sayyid-al-Hasan-al-Idrisi telegraphed to His Majesty the King on Friday last to confirm his loyalty and that of all inhabitants of his territory, and to say that the matter is only a personal one with the Amir and his attitude, that ^ none has ever dreamt or thought of making a disloyal movement or rebelling against the present jurisdiction or separating from the body of this kingdom. He urgently requested His Majesty to depute a new Amir, upon whose arrival everything would be restored to order. Orders have been issued for a reliable body to investigate the matter thoroughly. The Government of His Majesty the King hope that there will be not the slightest need for militarv operations or . the like.

The lady stated that the King had ordered 800 camels to be moved south to Riyadh from hi a reserve which gra*e permanently In the pasture land about Hafar al Atz (North Northeast of Riyadh in the Dahana region). That al 600 . ii-i-.'-ii-'i* Ml hwirl—tt la ttaV9&gt; had iwt/M KWh Nov«nber and that 300 more were to follow early in December. According to the lady also, the situation about Kbha where the King's forces were reported to have been defeated, was looked upon as serious, and the Mutalr who had gone south at the command of the King were lull of gloom and had no etoraachfor a war eo far distant from their homes. (b) The above information was conflrmt djby the shaikh of Kuwait and nls cousin Abdullah as*Salim on 8th December 1933. Both regard the Asir rebellion as a much bigger and more serious businessbusiness than that of ibn fifate* Both are of opinion tn&amp;t tii?' imain of Yem^n is behind the trouble and was secretly assisting seyed Abiul webab al Idrisi the leader of tne rebellion. (c) On 13th leceraber 1933 a Mutairi tribesman arrived from Burs Ida, and reported that Bin Baud was collecting a large force at Klyadh for service in Asir, All the Akhwan had been ordered to furnish contingents including the k &gt;hanmmr, Harb, Ataiba (ibn B&amp;bai’an) and many other tribes. imilarl&gt; the various towns of hejd were turriishing contingents. on completion of the concentration at Uly&amp;dh ibn ^u’saad Governor of hail was to take command and march to Fbha. The coming campaign according to the informer was already very unpopular. General uneasiness prevailed among the Akhw&amp;n throughout Hejd and tneir respond to the King 1 ® call to ana® was entirely halfhearted; Their objections to fight could be summarised under three heads (1) The distance was too great (2) Fvea if victorious they would get no cornel loot out of the Asir mountaineered) They no longer held the belief that if they died fighting for Bln Gaud, they would attain immediate heavenly bliss. (d) On 15th December 1932 a Mutairi tribes man visited Kuwait from Artawiysh. he brought the news that the •Broih” section of the . utair and other contingents of the Ban! Abdilla, had been ordered to concentrate at Klyadh and that many of them tod marched under Ibn l usalyis. The Northern Vutair (Mu&amp;to) had not however teen asked*s)ce&lt;l t.o furtdsh any ,, o^ias!n^■ or raiders, e.a tae ring did not trust them. The informer added that half ibn vasald uhalich of Artawlyeh ted been ordered to proceed to Riyadh with the Artawlyeh ‘Alchwan* but that he had eo far refused From the above, and much other desert gossip which continues to filter into Kuwait, it is clear that the coming campaign in Aslr which Bin baud is preparing for, on a somewhat large scale, is entirely unpopular among tne Bedouin and people of Nejd, andit is likely that if the ! iy&amp;dh force ever gets as far as Ebha, it will be roughly handled, for *no man's heart is in the business*, according to the BedouinU' mAHA JVI &gt;;. l 1 ‘t 0 » ,a ' W J 4 ,,* • :swJo ri?iSB bn* ,»v«| &gt; vl « 9 UflW»iW JtoW* Qt 8 ® 0 S » &gt;««, »£ii r«t^ T«9X? 8 Jt . | J'.; Q- ll J ®' ,tC »rJ;i*Q£-'Jq 3i t ' ui It^sqau 9* • 9 *•-■'*' ffil ll »X i 1 J Utof ii . «t&lt;* • •* * IBt 3; * m s ‘n -3 • T€ ,Xs». la^cei cm 'tsd'S (E J^Tasnls^nsi^i :&gt; fll tt* .Stti I La 3«* '9 : ^ V^TtO di* - l ^ $£&gt;!}$$• Jtfe ^ u ‘ ' , &gt;■ 4, ^ iw 0i/oiio4^1v ft P. h Sftv a xd iu ii.. s im g b liiow 4^1 ilJ J aw@ft fetWfttO ft • [ *0ft 1Notes.

So drastic a step as the removal of the Amir Abdullah was considered unaesirable for the reasons given in para.3 of the Foreign Of;ice letter at P.Z.7300, but the High Commissioner was asked to 'consider the possibility of really strongrepresentations to the Amir' and, if possible, to take drastic action against susoected members of his entourage, particularly the Amir Shakir (P.Z.7326). From the account now received of Sir A. Wauohope’s interview with Abdullah, he seems to have taken, m the circumstances, a somewhat gentle line with rum. Abdullah was his usual plausible self and denied having written any letters to people in the Hejaz for/— :/or a long time, and all knowledge of All Dabbagh. Sir A. Wauchope had already + elegi'aphed (^Olj -hat there seemed no direct evidence to justify t irm action against Shakir, but he made Abdullah proniae to give him a warning'. The authorities in Transjordan all consider the danger of incursions by Ibn Sand's Ikhwan to oe remote, in any case not a formidable ono* Abdullah's general account in para.7 ol' P.Z.7437 of his feelings towards Ibn Saud (and of the latter s unpopularity) is interesting but does not accord well v,ith the 'fairly reliable' information at P.Z.7308 concerning his recent meeting w r ith Feisal, when the latter is said to have reproached him for his clumsiness in helping Ibn Rifada but to have approved his intrigues against Ibn Saud in principle. A reply will now presumably be sent to the Saudi memorandum on the lines suggested in para.5 of the Foreign Office letter at P.Z.7300, but it is unfortunate, though perhaps natural, that the Transjordan authorities and the Legation at Jedda look at this question from such widely different angles. » »- •UjfUu+U- , mA -Aa -4 H*. vw ^ ctz, ^ y - 4 ^ A ^ u. *uzt. -=&amp;£r w..

Lir.A.Ii.Kirk'bride acting as interpreter. 2, T said that lasi-^trivaer Abdullah had said in his opinion Ibn Fifada would bo utterly defeated but oven so he thought'fitat trouble woild late? on arise in Southern Hojaz. 1 was grateful that (e.^groups) his two prophecies had proved correct. Did .Mullah think that troubles nor/ going on in Southern Hojaz were serious (2 corrupt groups) replied that he would be always ready to give ne information but on fcis subject he had very little knowledge. I replied; I do not think that troubles this year were very serious. I then said that I fully accepted and 1 relied on promise that Auir had given to me that he would give no support in cay fora to anyone ..no might cause disturbance in either the nor Ji oi ^auh of . Hejaz. !. T ono the loss I would aake a definite request to mmsh that he would hold no communication for the present with people in Hejaz. Abdullah saxd that written no letters for a long time to the Hejaz and he would not write any while disturbances were going on. Part 2 begins. 3 t said that a report had reached me that aletter from Abdullah had been found at Jizan Ja 17 th November addressed to Ali Dabbagh. Abdullah said again that he had written no letter for a long time, that he knew no man of that naiae but that he knew members of that family. 4 . I said that B^ni Atiya had caused certain troubles during last feu won the and I recognised that Abdullah had given every assistance to the British Resident in removing bulk of Beni Atiya from Trans Jordan to the He jaz. 1 however considered that Sheikh Selim Abu Dooeik paramount Sheikh of Beni Atiya was one who possibly might foment trouble and I therefore considered Ahu Domeik should leave Trans Jordan for the present and live in Beeraheba district until (corrupt group) are quiet in Hedjaz. I also cooaiderod Karayin Ibn Atiya who I am now informed is another Sheikh hostile to Ibn Saud and in close touch with Amir should also leave Trans Jordan and reside in Palestine. 5. Amir replied that he had always agreed to carry out any wishes of Hiu ujajeety^ Government which I had put to him although ho personally saw no reason to mistrust Abu Doweik ox Karayin he would be quite ready to give orders that they should live in Palestine for the present. The British d esident and Captain Glubb would see that his orders were carried out, 6. I thon said there wore rumours that Amir Shaker was in touch with disturbers oi* tl po Hodjas and 1 requested Abdullah to tell Shaker that he must be most careful to show that ho would give no support to any such people. The Auir willing to speak to Shaker to this effect bui. ts Shaker's family was roaidont in Hedjaz would not do anything unwise as that would only lead to his family gettinggetting into trouble. Part 3 beginso 7o I asked Abdullah for his views on present situation in Saudi Arabia 6 He said his views rea&amp;ined unchanged, namely that Ibn Saud was unpopular that ShfvUrl r&gt;f T ;nr/P.i k f the family of Ibn Rashid and people of Asir were all anxious to achieve overthrow of Ibn Saud, that it was natural for Ibn Saud in this difficult time to believe that some of intrigues • were due to Abdullah and that it was even possible for enemies of Ibn Saud in order to strengthen their position, to say that Abdullah was worldng for them but that this was untrue. He knew his interests lay « with the British Government he had given his promise not to work against Ibn Saud and he would keep that promise* It was true that Ibn Saud had behaved very badly to his family but people of Saudi' Arabia had not asked him to go into that country and he had no inclination to mix himself in their politics* He had in fact agreed to recognise Ibn Saud. I said that I was sure that he would realise the serious nature of our conversation and I would inform my Government that I fully accepted Ids promise of good faitho 8, The British Resident told me yesterday that the Executive and Legislative Councils wished the Amir to demand considerable changes in the Agreement of 1928. Realizing the seriousness of the subject which we had been discussing the Amir put forward no request regarding the Agreement. 1 consider the time unsuitable for making any material changes in the Agreement* 9. I agree with Colonel Cox and Captain Glubb in thinking llifesthinking the possibility of large body of Akhwan % • crossing the Trans Jordan frontier to be extremely remote. I agree with Air Officer Commanding that i they cross the frontier we shall be able to drive them back with little difficulty. His Majesty's Government need have little apprehension on this score.

Addressed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies No.169 repeated to Jeddah No.179. Your telegram No. 164. I suggest that it would be desirable to support general assurance by following instances of support given by Amir to the policy of His Majesty's Government: (a) during Ibn Rafada's revolt:- (1) he issued orders at the end of May prohibiting participation in Ibn Rafada's movement. (2) He assented to a law prohibiting the export of foodstuffs in June (3) He signed proclamation in July estaolishing prohibited on frontier. (4) He issued orders to Arab Legion m laUer part of July expressing 'our desire that no person or party should give assistance to Ibn Rafada and those with him and that we are against those who have such an idea . The declaration prohibited zone and other measures informally effectively stopped traffic of supplies to the rebels and preve.ioea tribesmen other than 70 Beni Atiya from crossing frontier into Saudi Arabia. (fc) Since Ibn Rafada'a defeat: - (1) en 6t.i Octo r definite assurance that he aould do nothin? to aasiat any ris.nss ,, x • v,+ ,™nr (2) With concurrence of Ibn against Ibn Saud that might occur, u; • j 4 . noni At.iva having been unsatisfactory Saud owing to conduct of Beni Aoi^a nav bulk of tribe was not allowed to remain in Trans -Jordan m view of possibility that they might attempt hostile action using territory of Trans -Jordan as a base. &lt;3) Mohamad Ibn Farhan isundergoing one year's imprisonment. 2. With regard to your telegram No.163 and my reply No.168. (a) Salim Abu Domeik is in Trans Jordan having lived at Kerak District for over 5 years past. On S9th November Amir informed British Resident that at time the Beni Atiya were being moved into Hedjaz he told Abu Domeik that he and his tribesmen must disregard any instructions to rise against Ibn Saud whoever might give them and that it was Amir’s conviction that any action against Ibn Saud would be harmful to himseli and Beni Atiya because it was contrary to wishes of His Majesty's Government. Possibility of putting Abu Bomeik under police supervision or of removing him to Palestine is being considered. Combination between him and Nuri Shalan is not considered lively. (b) Mahmud Ibn Farhan brother Mohammet has not yet complied with order to leave Trans Jordan. If still in Trans Jordan after to-day he will be brought before Bedouin control board. (c) There are no other important members of tribe in close touch with Amir. 3. Reference to letters from Williams to Young of 86th October and from Parkinson to me of 14th November, (a) Abdul Raouf Sabban has been dismissed by Amir and ordered to go to Baghdad. (b) It is difficult to produce concrete evidence on which toir might be required to dismiss Amir Shaker and Ha,ad Pasha Elwadi. They are Trans-Jordan nationals and there are no legal grounds for ejecting them from country. (c) There are no proofs on which action could be taken against Shanqiti or Obeid Kabariti who are Trans Jordanians. Hamid Kabariti might be removed from post as Mayor of Akaba but I do not recommend this as he is sometimes of use.

Saudi Government have handed to Charge d 1 Affaires, Jedda long memorandum of evidence in their possession as to past and present activities of alleged conspirators against Ibn Saud in Palestine, Trans-Jordan, Aden, Iraq. Memorandum refers specifically to present trouble in Asir, and request is renewed to His Majesty's Government to take steps to prevent their territories being used as base for anti-Saudi activity. It may be preferable to leave memoranaum unanswered and Charge d'Affaires is being instructed merely to reply that it has been forwarded to His Majesty's Government. But general assurance in regard to present situation mil have to be given and it may be found desirable to support that by instances of action, e.g. steps ta^en by Aden Authorities. It woula, however, be awkward to mention action by Aden authorities unless action by Trans-jordan authorities can also be cited, and with view to considering what, if anything. Charge d'Affaires is to say in this connection, it would be convenient if you could let me have early reply to my telegram of 25th November regarding activities of Beni Atiya.

His Majesty's ChargS d*Affaires at Jedda reports to following effect. Begins, Saudi Government^ 8 latest memorandum shows definite eigne of being inspired by Ibn Sand personally, and although no reference is made to captured correspondence between Abdullah and rebels (see paragraph 7 of Jedda telegram No.4-4) it may well be based upon such correspondence since it is clear that evidence is sufficiently serious to make Ibn Sand feel justified in hinting at peeeible action by Akhwan. Combination of spread of Asir revolt obviously supported from abroad, and of disquieting news from north (e.g. possible combination of Ihmeik and dun Shalan) appears to have convinced Ibn Saud that intriguers m Transjordan are again active and that Abdullah is planning yet another vicarious aggression. Ibn baud, who is alreavy exasperated by apparent inability of His Majesty's Government to control these intrigues, now seems likely &gt;&lt;o f-res^all ai. further incursion by having Akhwan ready to naaa. Lates ” looal information is that Ibn Musaad of Hail has now been placed in command, of Akhwan concentrations. Ends. 2. Present situation, in which Akhwan with or without Ibn Sand's tacit approval, take the law into their own handshands by attacking Transjordan, is one of serious danger. Continuance of position in which His Majesty’s Government cannot deny accusations of hostile activities which Ton Sand has made against Abdullah and his associates in Transjordan, is embarrassing and ignominious. In any case, unless radical steps are taken to remedy situation in near future, relations between His Majesty’.: Government and Ibn Baud are likely to become so difficult as not only to lead to increasingly serious friction on Transjordan frontier, but to prejudice British interests throughout Middle East. 3* In these circumstances I shall be glad if you will ] consider possibility of really strong representations to Mir drawing hie attention to rumours of his alleged complicity in Asir rising arid urging upon him with all force at your command necessity of complete cessation of any communications which he or his associates may still be holding with persons involved in rebellious activities against Ibn Baud. 4. It also seems desirable that immediate drastic i action should be taken against those in Transjordan in the case of whom there is definite evidence of complicity in plots against Ibn Saud,) more especially if possible those in iiEisdia-te vicinity of Aciir, and in particular Amir Shakir. Such action, if sufficiently severe would provide His Majesty's Goveinitisnu with some material for reply to memoranhim summarised in Jedda tolegnsm No.215 to Foreign Office, and might prevent situation from becoming even more dangerous. 5. Assuming that you are able to take action in accordance with the above suggestions. His Majeuty'a Government contemplate reply to Saudi Government on following lines: (a) They will hold Saudi Government responsible for consequences ofr' W apy hostile activities againet Tra^ejordan by Akhiran, and will UB8 aii ..:i 3 a.'.e iae.inE to repel them.

On 10th October H.H. the Amir Abdullah gave a dinner in King Faisal^ honour at the summer camp in ADJLOUH. After the departure of the guests King Faisal, H.H. the Amir Abdullah and a certain Mohammed El Onsi (an ex-Chamberlain) remained together in the tent. 2. The topic of conversation was the Ibn Rifada affair and the following extracts from it are considered worthy of notice. (a) King Faisal blamed the Amir for being hasty in his efforts to foster the revolt. because of this (he said) several important men have been killed and a considerable financial loss has been incurred. (fc) King Faisal said that half the blame should be attached to Hand El Wadia and Abdul Raouf Sabban because he was convinced that it was solely on their advice that the Amir had acted prematurely. (c) King Faisal said that the Amir Shaher had told him that he was against the Amir Abdullah s schemes from the outset and had on that account declined to hold any communication with the Pala e for week; that although the quarrel was ultimately patched up he had carried out his instructions in connection with the revolt with the greatest misgiving. Id)(d) King Faisal told H.H. the Amir that he was convinced that the British authorities still suspect him (Ahdullah) to he intriguing against Ibn Saoud* (e) Finally # the King rated the Amir in words to this effect;- 'It was absolutely childish of you to encourage a mere 1,000 men, of whom only one third bore arms, to fight against Ibn Saoud* You should have ts&amp;en my advice about it. You should first of all have made arrangements with the tribal oheficiis on the ‘Iraq and Syrian frontiers to strike at Ibn Saoud simultaneously with Ibn Rifada. Ibn Saoud would then have been invaded on three sides and in all probability would have collapsed. Anyhow | the time is coming.

It was, however, decided whon the poeel* bllity of remodying this situation was considered in connexion with the amir's suspected complicity In tfcd Ibn Rlfada rebellion and on the receipt of King ibn Baud's secret m«r^randu* of the 6th Aut;uEt, ta copy of which was enclosed in Foreign Ofilco l^ttor ho. 8 4394/1 f41/26 of the 10th October,) that such a drastic step as tlie rer'cval of tlie arlr fro* hlo posi tion os ruler of TrunaJordan was undesirable on other grounds, at any rata at the prsseot stage, and that in any case ouch action should not be takSB as a dlr. ct result of preesure from King ibn baud nor in a*::suit of direct evidence of the truth of the accusations mwde against hi* by that ' onarch, which codld be published.

Mr .Hope-Gill has ^^f^non&gt;rimrTTrrfaudis have capturea letters from Abdullah himself to Ali DaBbagh - in other words that he is implicated in the Asir revolt (P.Z.7204). Ibn Saud appears to be seriously alarmed at the prospect of more trouble in the North, and has addressed'ti H.M.G. a memorandum exhorting them to bestir themselves against the conspirators in Transjordan and threatening them with the uncontrolability of his Ikhwan (P.Z. 7203) [V / which he intends apparently to move north wards. - a step, which, if not already taken, would**EdinosT' certainly result in dangerousincursions into Transjordan* Mr .Hope-Gill thinks that the King is genuinely alarmed and suggests that the time has come for H.M.G* to take a strong line about Abdullah, who will, in his opinion, be unable ever to live at peace with Ibn Baud. 1-t is understood that the Departments concerned are awaiting/positive proof of his complicity before considering the line they will take. Meanwhile, in Asir, the insurgents seem to be holding their own. The Idrisi has withdrawn into the Yemen but the Imam, though his troops are concentrated on the frontier, is not yet openly supporting; him. The Idrisi's emissary, having failed to induce the British Administrator at Kamaran to give him any encouragement or material help^ has proceeded to Eritrea v/ith the apparent intention of appealing to the Italians (P.Z.7145).97721/3(2 Pt.

Memorandum summarised in my telegram No* 206 was probably luad’s and entered as caveat aga.a.nst probable Dabbagh complicity, directly the Idrisi snow fight; it may be regarded as timely routine movement based on old evidence® Latest memorandum however shows definite signs of having come from Riyedh. It claims to be based on evidence from three sources, namely persons from Transjordan, reports from frontier and events in Asir. No mention is made of any capture of recent correspondence with.Amman but possibility of tnis cannot be discarded for it is clear that something sufficiently serious has transpired to melee Ibn Seud threaten His Kajesty's Government with uncontrolcbility of his Ikhwano I take it to be simultaneous effect of bad news from the south ( e.g. widespread nature of revolt itself, backing in arms and money from conspirators and perhaps attitude of Iman or his son)^ and dis-o o combination) combined with His Majesty's Government's apparent unconcern. In Ibn Gaud's own view, as I see it, he is faced with Abdullah's second vicarious aggression in progress and third in prospect, while His Majesty’s Government he probably holds to have shorn insufficient consideration for his (to him) complete frankness and truthful exposition of August 5th; in reply they nave upheld Abdullah and shown no disposition to control him or his agents any more effectively than in the past. Ibn Scud probably sees history repeating itself and is determined to forestall and pursue any third incursion by having Ikhwan ready to hand and being role to say aftorvards that they gou out of hand and I told you so. (My latest local infomat/ion in this connexion is that Ibn Musaad of Hail has been pieced in command)o If Ibn Seud has really begun to concentrate Ikhwan northward I doubt v/hether anything we can now say will suffice to restore his confidence to the extent necessary to check it. Only radical action on our part would take effect, inis would natuidly n..ve to be undertaken before threat to frontier peace actually developed: thereafter we should be committed to uttering grave warnings and strengthening frontier defence without any serious prospect of preventing 'uncontrolled' incursions end bloodshed, endless recrimination would follow.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 251 of the 18th December, I have the honour to forward herewith a translation of the Hejazi Government's communique of the 14th December, relative to the negotiations between Hejaz-Nejd and Yemen regarding the Asir frontier, with special reference to the recognition by Ibn Sand of 'the Imam's right to Mount Arwa. A copy of this communique was forwarded to the Legation on the 14th December, the date of issue, under cover of an unnumbered memorandum of a purely formal nature. 2. Mount Arwa has been mentioned on previous occasions in connexion with the frontier dispute. The name would appear to apply to the position or positions occupied bv the Imam last August or early in September, when, according to Fuad Bey, his troops advanced at Jabal Razih. The locality may, presumably be identified with the Arua, shown in the contoured 1 : 253,440 map of South-West Arabia, “Saada” section, as a village lying 12 miles up the valley in which Sada is situated, and definitely on the southerly side of a water shed.' which may well mark a de facto boundary between Y emeu and Asir. Razih, which is shown on some maps as a mountain, here appears as a village near the crest of Khaulan-ash-Sham and on what would appear to be the \emem side ot it. The maps show this massif as standing 50 miles from the sea and due east ' 3 1 am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to His Majesty's representative at Rome, the Secretary to the Government of India in the and Political Department, and the Political Resident at Aden, with copies ot my telegram under reference and an explanation of the reference.

On the 11th March the Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote officially to the Legation asking that, as Sabiyan and Jizan were not covered by the agreement between the Hejazi Government and the Eastern Te egr p Company (which agreement precludes the former from using other means o telegraphic communication with the outside world), arrangements should be made to establish wireless communication between Jizan and Aden ^ “rml purposes.

It did not prevent the discussion of other business but t necessitated the postponement of various questions and imposed caution in th handling of others lest an already tense situation should be aggravated On th 6 1st April Sheikh Yusuf Yasin sought an interview with Sir A. Ryan un( | 6 the King’s instructions, with the express object of expressing the perplexit' created in Ibn Saud’s mind by the recent severity exhibited by His Maiestvi Government and the rigour of the Minister’s own language on certain subieci notably the questions of the Eastern Telegraph Company’s cable account Sir A. Ryan explained that there was no change in His Majesty’s Government's fundamental attitude towards Ibn Saud, but said that they dealt with questions on their individual merits. The Transjordan question was one of such capital importance that it might affect general relations. The Eastern Telegraph Company question was not on the same plane, but the Legation had taken a strong line because it had become a scandal. The Minister gave examples of the efforts made to prevent an admittedly acute situation from being still further envenomed e.g., the avoidance by His Majesty’s Government of all publicity in connexion with the Transjordan crisis and the restraint which he has himself exercised in dealing with the question of chauffeurs (paragraphs 9 to 13), although he felt very strongly about it. 37. All passages of arms notwithstanding, relations remained as friendly as could be expected throughout the two months. In spite of the electrical character of Sir A. Ryan s audience on the 2nd March to discuss Transjordan, the King united him to a second audience on the 4:th M^arch to discuss more ordinary business. Various social courtesies helped to limit the area of tension notably the Legation dinner on the 8th April in honour of Nuri Pasha. At the time of and after the pasha s visit, friendly pergonal communications passed between Sir r. Humphrys and Ibn Saud. They related partly to a gift of two wireless sets, which, after various accidental delays, were offered by the High commissioner to the King on his own behalf, and that of His Majesty’s Govern ment as a souvenir of the Lupin Conference. The message addressed to His ajes y on the occasion of their delivery contained a formal expression of the goodwill of His Majesty’s Government in addition to that of Sir Francis’s personal sentiments.

My Lord/ Jedda, September 30, 1931. ^ 1 HAVE the honour to report that Mr. Philby, or rather Hajji Abdullah St. John Philby, has returned unexpectedly from Riadh, and in the course of several conversations has given me some interesting sidelights on the internal situation in this country. 2. There seems little doubt but that Ibn Saud and he get badly on each other’s nerves. He left with all his baggage and instruments in two cars running on a three-quarter paraffin mixture. In full desert they ran out ol even this modest admixture of benzine, and Mr. Philby subsisted on dates and insufficient water until relief came from Taif. Arrived there, he learned of the misappropriation of the whole of the Standard Oil Company s benzine stock at Jedda, for which he is agent. Although he pretended on his arrival here that the seizure was the result of previous arrangement by mm with the Director-General of Finance, he confessed to me last night that he had been faced with a fait accompli and that all he could do was to write it up with the other debts owing to him by the Hejazi Government Ihese, he said now amount to some £50,000, £12,000 of which represent the value of this and previous consignments from Standard Oil. He holds no drafts on customs nor even promissory notes. If the Government swims he hopes eventual y ^ be paid^ If it sinks, he fears that he must sink with it. He has staked his all on 1 StlUd 3 This makes it all the more striking that he should criticise him so unfavourably to a third person.

Dear i,ir.Hope Gill, I informed you when I was speaicing with you by telephone yesterday that I would send written confirma tion of the message which I communicated to you on behalf of Kis Majesty the King, and of his approval of what I had already expressed to you in connection with the strong desire of His Majesty to avoid that which might disturb his relations with the Imfim Yahya, and his continual care to prevent causes of hostilities and to the resolve all problems in a friendly peaceful and diplomatic way. I have since received from His Majesty an urgent order to inform our friend the British Government that his Majesty indeed esteems their xriendly advice at its true value and expresses his gratitude for it. He furthermore wishes to assure them that he is one of the greatest upholders end invoKers of peace, and one of the most ardent in pursuing it by every means, far more so than the lm£m Yahya. When His Majesty was informed of the advance of the Imfim 1 s soldiers to the frontiers of his territories, he issued orders for the stoppage of all retaliatory action until communication should be completely estaolished with the ImSm Yahya by diplomatic means and he accordingly ordered his Amir in JlsShn to communicate with the authori ties of Yemem. His Majesty also telegraphed direct to the Infim Yahya informing him of the fact and adjuring him in the name of neighbourliness and peace not to be the cause of bloodshed. I begged him to be moderate and to hold his/his hand but nothing was received from the Im&amp;m Yahys. to show his desire for peace. His Majesty telegraphed again to him, as I informed you at the time, and we are still awaiting his reply, on which depends the warlike or peaceful solution of the matter. I send you herewith copies of the letters exchanged in this connection and also copies of the telegrams to and from the Im&amp;m, from which you will see that his intentions are not good and do not seem peace and tranquility. His Majesty therefore considers it necessary to call the whole civilised world to witness to these realities and proclaims so that he hates war and curses it and dislikes to enter with anyone into war or conquest or aggression; hut in spite of all, he is hound to defend his territories and the territories in his charge. His Majesty will stand in this case as in others, a defendant pressed to defend himself and his lands. In this connection I send you not only the communications relating to the latest developments out also all the communications exchanged since the Idrisi province was joined to the territories o± His Majesty, so that you may he informed of the good intentions of His Majesty from the beginning of the matter. With highest respects, Yours sincerely, HUAI BALM A.ENCLOSURE NO.I. TENT OF TELEGRtNPEIC MESSAGE SENT BY EIS MAJESTY TEE NING TO TEE IMAM YAEYIA, DATED 23.6.1349. (14.11.1930). Your Excellency is aware of what we are bound to in the Idrisis* territories in accordance with our agreement with them, hut there have recently occurred movements to break the peace and causing harm to our frontiers and in the interior of the Idrtsis 1 territories, compelling us to warn the Idrisi to administer the affairs of his country himself and that he would be held responsible for peace. But he informed us that he is unable to do this and he asked us to carry out this duty We had no choice but to accept his request and we have taken upon our shoulders the charge of all the administration of his country. As we fear that enemies may counterfeit the truth of all that has occurred and give false explanations thereof, we wish to inform you by telegram and have written to you full details by letter.

We have informed our generous brother of what is between us and the Idrtsis and have mentioned the reasons for our care in informing you thereof at once, fearing that evil ones might explain it contrariwise to the truth. We wish on tfcis occasion to mention to our brother that stoppage of communications and exchange of news between us may give occasion to enemies to tattle and enable them to intrigue an create hostilities between the sons of one nation. Your Excellency Anows that almost the only defects which are found in this Islamic Arabian Nation come from the disunitydisunity of its word, which entices enemies to wish for disunity. We know with sorrow that those who are striving for the disunity of that word are those who also pretend that they are Muslims and Arabs. If we would see a sword cutting the tongues of the disturbers of peace and humiliating the enemies of Arabs and Muslims, we must do our best to agree between us and proclaim it to the people, so that the seducer may quit the error of his ways and the rope of hope of every enemy who wishes ill to our countries may be cut. We wish our generous brother to believe that we are entirely prepared to our test for union and agreement and that there will he no reason for hostilities, God willing. We are confident that this feeling exists between us and that you desire agreement and union even as we desire it. We await the reply of our brother as to the way which he prefers, with a view to satisfying the existing need, praying that the Almighty may help all of us to obtain that which he wishes and which affords the respect of Islam and the Muslims.

The ftoyal Govemaent wamly tlianks His Britonnic Majeety’s Governmtmi for having, in conformity with the understanding reached in the conversations i» om© of January and February, 1927, ^ at which both parties agreed that it was desirable that the two govern’ u ^ a remain in contact regarding all questions aficcting tlie Red oa and Southern Arabia - asked the opinion of the Italian aovorament in regard to a que tl m of aaich importance and delicacy, which might have repersusaioas on the maintenance of pacific relations between the Ardb potentates of the Ked ioam It is a question, moreover, in consider!^; which the Royal :ovemment cannot but take account of the inters to of the Yemen, in /lew of the special Treaty and tlxe relations of friendship ishich, is well known to the British Government, bind the kingdom of Italy with the Imam of the Yemen#3. The particular interest which the Italian aovernrnent attritmtea to the question of Aeir has already heen fhlly explained to the British repreeontativea d?aring the convortationa at Rome of January and February, 1927* It la opportune to recall the declarations which on that occGBion were nade in t iia regard. At the sitting of the l£th January, 1937, the Italian representative showed how the irotoctorete Treaty concluded in ©pteaber, 1926, between King Ibn and and the Amir Idries of Aelr had modified, but had not simplified, the situation. I Aeir could ueefully serve ae a buffer etate between the Redjas and the Yemen, eo as to avoid frontier friction which sooner or later could be a causa of conflict between the two Arab States. The Italian representatives added that the Treaty of 1926 clearly could not be recognised by the Inaa Yahia, all the more that it referred to the boundaries of air, as fix d in 1931, whereas the Imam Yahia had not only already rc^talMi * pCMCi alcm of one part of the territory then occupied by ASir and which reached as far m Hodeida, but also claimed other territories. The Italian representatives therefore drew attention to the desirability, olflfo t» t;-:.. col awra&amp;onM-t'*^ Ito ^' ^ that the attitude of Italy should not he dpealy eontrar;/ to the aspirations and to the Utweate of the Y era on, a* would have occurred had any recognition in whataoever aanner hoen given to the validity of the Treaty hetveen the Hedjaa and A.lr, which th. Italian aoveiment therefore co-aid not roeo^iae. The British representativee saw tr.e fore.. &gt;• th « atatenent aade ty their Italian collea^ea and realised that the new Treaty had in part modified the situation, they finally declared that they would a* London how the Treaty had been interpreted there*. At the aut)sequent meeting of tho Slat January the British representatives—&lt;^S7 repMfiontatives , aftde It oaown that the Government of London did not propose to take tictiv© atepa for the reeogAltlon of tht? Treaty between the Hodja* and /.air, but that they could not return a refusal. In the event of Ibn ^ud, with whom the British aovornment was in the process of concluding a Treaty of Friendship, asking them to take act of the Treaty, since a refusal would have compromised the conclusion of the Treaty under negotiation, to which the British Govermaent attached great importance. In any event, the British Government declared ' that the r^couiiitloh of, ffcff ’ would not htv.- al.am-:. ruco.^lt^ on on thel£,^rt p£„„m * frontier, of sir and that ■j.var:; torylte 1 ,^ wftfi •’ re,-ai'Clau ua an I nternal . r&amp;b ffilsatlWt. ,ife lcn Ml nntor« t the eielUat i apyernaenV'. ^ Italian reprcaonta- tivee objected that the Treaty between the Hedja* and sir had regard only to territorial tjueatlons, laaaauoh ae it a a mi red to the Iledjaa the to tec t orate over 'air. The Hedjftz would, on the contrary, hare beli vod that in Tirtue of the ngliah recognition they were authoriaed to attribute to themeelvea also the poeaeoaion of T.haaa, claimed by Aair aa their own territory. 4. The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs thought it important to recall in detail the contents of the procas verbaua of the conversations of Rome, inaamu«..i as It beliovae that whilat the situation dojats 1108 not 1,6011 changed in any way, the situation de,faS.to baa b^n agrrewated through the action of the Kedjas in coneeuuonce . a. v. vim?

The annexation performed by King Ibn Baud therefore aggravates the conflict between the two Arab ootentatea and increases the danger of grave consonances which it le the common interest of the British end Italian Governments to avoid by all the means la their powar. This danger has already been broajtot by the Soyal Govern-:ont, throush tlwslr trabaeay In London, to the attention of the British Government; and the Royal Government recalls these warnings made in the spirit of mutual and trustful collaboration established since the Rome conversations of 1927, because in their opinion they should be borne in mind when considering the question oi the r cognition of the situation created by the Hedges i» ■’’***• B.

The Italian Govommont must consider that these declaration© still have their full value* in view also of the fact that the territorial questions arising from the ottoman succession in the territories of the Arabian Peninsula belonging to the ex- mpire, were solved only partially internationally by the Treaties of Peace and the rslatire Agyssmemts. The Italian Government considers* however, that the juridical international situation must be taken into account in examining and eventually solving the questions concerning the /rabian Peninsula. 6. In the idi -M&amp;ioire left by the Snfeaasy of His Britannic Majesty it is pointed out t at the Italian Government would presumably recognise the situation created by the Hedjax in / sir at the moment whan the negotiations ai\ concluded for the Treaty which the Eoyal Government is negotiating with King Ibn Scud* The Royal Ministry of Foreign iff sirs desires to declare to the British oovemmont that the Italian Government does not intend the recognition of Ibn Jaud as King of the Hodja* and of Nojd and fepondeneioa to prejudice the territorial gueatlone concerning sir. r. in conclusion the Italian aororaaent, deairoua, as always, to proceed in tbla, a» in all other cues Ilona, taped ally regarding the political cituatt n of the ten 3e», in a aplrit of fran’t and cordial collaboration with the , t iT&lt;id to cell attention witli the British Government* feels obli ,aa /greatest sgreatest f^ren^nese and Xryalty to the repercussion* on the pacific relatione between the Bedjaa and the Yemen, which might flow from the act of recognition which the former of these two States solicits in regard to sir; repercussions which might he still more dangerous if, as the Italian representatives said at the Home conversations, the Hodjas desired to interpret such rooognition a© an acceptance, not only of the ennexation of Asir to the Hodjas, hut also of the Hedjaz claim to Tehama. An eventual and deplorable conflict between the two States concerned would at the moment be all the more grave for the reason that, as His Britannic Majesty's Kabasay commentated in their note of Jlaly 6th, 1926, the British aovernaent has felt obliged to allow, within the limits of the Convention of the Traffic of Arms of 1926, the free importation of arms and munitions into the Hedja* and Italy ha© followed an analogous course for the importation of arms and munitions into the Yemen# On all these rounds, which the Italian Government have thought It their &lt;*ity to consider, they hope that the British OOTcmnent will suspend action in regard to the request for recognition, in the Interest of the maintenance of peace between the two potentates of the iun peninsula, the principle aim of the conversations of Rome, which Italy has done and 1. doing everything possible to achieve. Romo, 25th Juno, 193i.COp? (37Ai/&amp;D By an arrangement concluded last October and embodied In treaty form the Idrlsi of Aalr eatraated King Ibn iaud vlth the Internal administration and financial organisation of hla country* which will henceforth be governed b r an Amir and a Financial Director appointed by King Ibn Baud with the help of an * elected legislative council. By the Treaty of Mecca of teptember 1926 the Jdrlsl had already handed over the control of his foreign relations. In the cour ie of the Rome conversations of 1927 His Majesty 9 s Government undertook not to volunteer, but to postpone as I ng as possible, recognition of this Treaty and in any case to defer recognition of its territorial provisions and implications. But the situation has materially changed since the date of this undertaking as a result of the complete surrender by the Idrlsi of all his powers of internal govenamwnt to King Ibn Baud and the resultant change in the status of eir which, it seems clear, can now only be regarded, tvom thu point of view of international law, as a part of the lat ter's dominions, having, for practical purposes, b can ceded in full sovereignty# His Majesty's Government are in receipt of a not© from the Hejasl Government which assume© their acquiescence in what must, in their opinion, b^ regarded as the do facto and de jure status of Asir. It is Impossible indefinitely to abstain from replyingto this communication or to refuse to comaunicato with the Hejazi Jovoniaont regarding Asir. In theue circumstances Hie l ajeety’s cioTemment would propose forthwith to roco rnise the effects oi the new arranganent between King Tbn Saud and the Idriel, but before doing no they would be glad to receive the observation® of the Italian Oov rnm nt. ’They trust that they nay « receive an early and favourable reply on the matter, more especially as the complete absorption of Aeir into King tbn Srud* dominions is a fact which the Italian Oovornment themeelvea will presumably have to accept If the treaty which they ar* about to negotiate with Ibn Send is to be concluded. BP ITT OH MBA OT, ROME# 30th May, 1931.No* 892 FOREIGN OFFICE, S. .1. 17th July,1931. /' (E 4449/1098/26) Sir, I have considered the note from the Italian Government regarding the question of the recognition of the new status of Asir, a translation of which was enclosed in Your Excellency’s despatch No. 485 (37/16/31) of the 29th June. 2. It appeals that the Italian Government are under some misapprehension as to the contents of the note of the 11th March addressed by the Hejazi Government to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda* which has necessitated consideration of this matter. The Italian Government’s note was evidently written under the impression that the Hejazi Government’s communication was a direct request for the formal recognition by His Majesty’s Government of the incorporation of Asir in the dominions of King Ibn Gaud. You will be aware from the summary of that note contained in the telegram from Sir . Ryan, a copy of which was enclosed in my despatch No. 554 of the 11th May, that this was not the case, and that the note, in fact, merely requested His Majesty’s Government to enter into arrangements for the / establishment of communications between certain places under British administration and the Asiri port of Jizan. 3. In these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government in the « United Kingdom are glad to be able to meet the views of the Italian Government expressed in their note referred to above, by deferring any formal and direct expression of their recognition of the sovereignty of King Ibn Saud over Asir, although they remair of s Excellency The Right Honourable Sir Ronald Graham, G.C*M*G., G.C.V* *, etc., etc., etc., Rome.of the opinion that in consequence of the recent agreement between King Ibn Saud and the Idrisi, Aeir has, de facto and de .jure become an integral part of King Ibn Saud's dominions. 4 . On the other hand it is clear that as vas explained in ay despatch No. 554, His Majesty's Government cannot refuse to reply to the Hejazi Government’s note of the 11th March and cannot abstain from corresponding, when necessary, with the Ilejazi Government in future regarding matters connected with Aelr. Indeed, their delay in replying to the Hejazi Government's communication has already pieced His Majesty's Government in a position of some embarrassment. Instructions for a reply are therefore being despatched to Sir Andrew Ryan. 5. I shall bo gl d if you will address to -the Italian Government a communication in the general sense of the preceding paragraphs.

Signor Grandi is absent from the Ministry and will only return after making his speech in the Senate on June 3rd. Signor Guariglia promised an official reply in due course, but he said at once, speaking unofficially, that his Government were not disposed to take the same view or the same action as His Majesty’s Government. ne did not definitely declare that they would expect us t abide by our undertaking of 1927 and it was not deemeu politic to put this point to him. 2. He stated that he considered recognition of the new arrangement and its implications uc be impolitic, un necessary and dangerous as being likely to increase tne likelihood of a conflict between Ibn Saud and tne Imam. Moreover his 'Government were committed to tne Imam just as His Majesty's Government were to Ibn Saud.

As Sir A. Ryan points out, the request contained in the Hejazi Government’s note assumes the acquiescence of His Majesty’s Government in the newly-modified status of Asir. Consequently, whatever reply may be returned to that note will imply such recognition, unless the contrary is explicitly stated. 3. On the other hand, it will be remembered that an undertaking was given to the Italian Government in 1927 (as mentioned in paragraph 6 of the Foreign Office letter under reference), that His Majesty’s Government would not volunteer recognition of the Treaty of Mecca, and that, while it might not be possible indefinitely to defer this recognition, they would in any case withhold recognition of the territorial provisions and implications of that Treaty. It seems clear that this undertaking would a fortiori preclude recognition of ^ the The Under Secretary of State, India Office.the new status of Asir resulting from the later arrangement recently made between Ihn Saud and the Idrisi* 4. Mr. Henderson considers that it would he difficult to abstain from returning an answer to the note from the Hejazi Government referred to in Sir A. Ryan’s telegram, and to other communications affecting Asir which may be received in future, and that it would be undesirable to refuse explicitly to recognize what must now be regarded as the &gt; de facto and de jure status of Asir. In these circumstances, he proposes that, subject to the concurrence of Lord Passfield and of the Secretary of State for India, the position should be explained to the Italian Government by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome who would inform them that, having regard to the change in the situation since 1927 and the practical obstacles in the way of refusing to communicate with the Hejazi Government regarding Asir, as exemplified by the present case, His Majesty’s Government propose, subject to any observations which the Italian Government may wish to offer, officially to recognize the effects of the new arrangement made between the Idrisi and Ibn Saud and the new status of Asir. It may be remarked that the complete absorption of Asir into Ibn Saud’s dominions is a fact which the Italian Government may themselves possibly be obliged to accept if they conclude the treaty with Ibn Saud, which they are believed at present to be actively negotiating* 5# Mr. Henderson will further be glad to be furnished in due course with Mr. Benn’s views regarding the proposal of the Hejazi Government that postal communication should be established between Kamaran and Jizan.—Decode exid Decypher D.

Sir, V.’ith reference to Foreign Office letter ^ E o583 / 4o ’ 2 / 9 l the 26th November,^1930, relative to the assumption by King Ibn Saud of the control of the internal administration of Asir, I am directed by Hr. Secretary Henderson to transmit to you, to be laid before the oecretury of State for India, the accompanying copies of two despatches from His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Je&amp;da, enclosing translations of a 'Green Book' on the sub jest issued by the Government of the Hejaz-Nejd and to sodte that Mr. Eenderson has had under consideration the effect of the arrangements described in the Green Book on (1) the present status of xxsir, and (2) the Treaty of •/f r// 7- concluded between His Majesty’s Government and the Idrisi. 2. As regards the nresent status of Asir, it will be remembered that by the Treaty of Mecca of 1926 between Ming Ibn Saud and the Idrisi, the latter handed over to King Ibn Saud the entire control of his foreign relations, but retained the independent control of the internal affairs of his territory. By the new arrangement, changes are introduced by agreement under which King Ibn Saud now possesses control also over the internal government of the Idrisi territory. The Idrisi apparently still retains the position of head or ruler of the Idrisi territory under King Ibn Saud, although the actual government of the L territory is entrusted to a direct representative appointed by the King, called the Amir,- who is assisted by an elected legislative Under-Secretary of State, India Office.legislative council* The Idrisi seems to possess a power of veto over the decisions of the Amir and the legislative council, though it appears that in the last resort King Ibn Saud can over-rule the Idrisi. 3* It will be noticed that this arrangement establishing the nresent T^osition of the Idrisi is the result of an agreement reached between the representatives of King Ibn Saud and of the Idrisi, but that the conclusion of this agreement was preceded by a complete surrender by the Idrisi of f all his powers of internal government to King Ibn Saud; and the actual legal basis of the present arrangement seems to be a decree, or order, of King Ibn Saud made in the exercise of the complete and untrammelled power v/hich he had acquired as a result of this surrender. It may be, therefore, - although, in the absence of sufficient information, Mr* Henderson is not in a position to express a definite opinion on this point - that King Ibn Saud would in future be legally free to change the order which he has thus arranged by his own decree, and to put an end to such rights as are given to the Idrisi under it • 4. Whatever is the exact relationship of King Ibn Saud to the Idrisi and his territory as the result of the new measures, it seems clear that this relationship is henceforward a part of the internal arrangements of the Hejaz-Nejd State, and that from the point of view of international law the Idrisi’s territory is included in the dominions of King Ibn Saud. The Idrisi has, in fact ceasedceased to exist as an international person, and no longer possesses any status in international law. A- Jjth-f r * 5. It seems desirable now to examine the effect of the new arrangement upon the Treaty of 1917 between His Majesty’s Government and the Idrisi. This Treaty consists principally of an engagement by His Majesty's Government to protect the independence of the Idrisi and his territory from the intervention of any foreign power, (it will be remembered that His Majesty's Government subsequently declared that this engagement did not apply in the event of aggression by an Arabian ruler), and an agreement by the Idrisi not to cede, mortgage or surrender the Farsan Islands or places situated on his seaboard to a foreign Power. It may be possible to argue that the engagements in this treaty were made in the circumstances of the existence of the Great War, and in particular a war between His Majesty's Government and the Idrisi and Turkey, and therefore cannot be regarded as operating after the termination of the circumstances with respect to which they ^ ^ rre “i were made! Assuming, however, that this is not the case, fill. i Tr &lt;/&gt; L it seems that now, at any rate, the treaty could be regarded as having lapsed, owing to the disappearance, as an ^ '7 ^^.international person, of one of the parties. In this case the only question for consideration would be whether, upon the assumption by King Ibn Saud of the control of the Idrisi territory, the benefits and obligations arising from the treaty pass to him as the successor of the Idrisi. As at present advised, however,Mr. Henderson inclines to the view that this treaty is not of the type which is considered/ 4°i U J. 4- ■ / ; considered to pass in this way by succession. 6 . In this connexion, however, I am to recall the fact that in the course of the conversations held at Rome in 1927, between His Majesty 1 s Ambassador at Rome and the late Sir Gilbert Clayton on the one hand and representatives of the Italian Government on the other, relative to British and Italian interests in Southern Arabia and the Red Sea, the British delegates gave an undertaking not to volunteer recognition of the Treaty of Mecca; to postpone its recognition as long as possible; and in any case to withhold recognition of the territorial provisions and implications of the Treaty. I am to refer in this connexion to Foreign Office letter E 376/22/91 of the 22nd January, 1927, enclosing copies of the draft instructions to Sir Gilbert Clayton at the time of the conversations. 7. In view of the undertakings referred to above, Mr. Henderson proposes, subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State for India to instruct Sir Andrew Ryan that he should not commit His Majesty's Government to recognition of the absorption of Asir into the territories of King Itin Saud nor take any action which could oe regarded as implying such recognition without first seeking instructions. 8 . If this course is adopted, it may be possible to leave the position as regards the lapse of the Treaty of 1917 between His Majesty's Government and the Idnsi undefined; and having regard to the possibility that upon the death of King Ibn Saud the Asir might regain measure of independence and that in that case circumstances mightmight arise in which it would be valuable to be able to appeal to the provisions of the Treaty, Mr. Henderson considers that there would be advantage in so doing. 9. I am to enquire whether Mr. Benn has any observations to offer on this matter. 10. A similar letter is being sent to the Colonial Office and copies of this letter are being sent to the Air Ministry and Admiralty. I am.

I thank your Majesty for the advice you have given to my country and for the care you have shown towards our interests and the organisation of our affairs, in a way that will maintain our honour and comfort. In compliance with your suggestions and friendly advice, with which I agree, I sent round for your Majesty's deputation, and discussed with them the matters you referred to, of which the principal ones are the administration and the adjustment of the finances of the country. The decision agreed upon is the one communicated to your Majesty in the letter of my council. So there is nothing left undone on my part or on that of my people regarding the measures which have to be undertaken towards the country and its improvement and concerning consultation with your Majesty. I pray God may grant success to all. “ I wish to draw your Majesty’s attention to the fact that I, on my part, have proved my friendship and connexion with your Majesty, and I believe that I have increased your Majesty’s inconvenience, that is to say, I have laid upon your Majesty s shoulders my task and my hopes for the protection of my honour and the comfort of my country, trusting that your Majesty’s endeavour for me in this connexion is better and more hopeful (than mine own). I am therefore confident that your Majesty will act in this respect as you would do for the interests v'Ou cherish most, and by this means I would attain the end that I desire and expect. In truth your Majesty will realise that our connexion is not of recent date, and it is full only of the faithfulness and the noble character registered in the white pages of your Majesty’s prestige.3 I swear by God, the only God, that I am keeping faithful and loyal to your Majesty outwardly and inwardly. I have never thought of anything contrary to friendship. Anything attributed to me contrary to friendship and courtesy is false and groundless. Here I am registering in history an obvious ^ proof of the truth of what I have said by entrusting the protection of my country, my subjects, my comfort and my honour to the charge of your Majesty’s honour, and by making your Majesty responsible for all of this. I am quite sure of your noble and pure character and honour. I await your reply to reassure me as to that which I expect, namely, the maintenance of my rights and my honour, and the regard of my private people and relatives and the appreciation of their connexion with and services to me, your Majesty will then be entitled to whatever facilities the aim and helps the realisation of the desired end. Notwithstanding that I am sure of all this, nevertheless, as A1 Khalil (Abraham) said, I want my heart reassured. God is the best witness to what we say.” The letter of the Legislative Council:— “ His Majesty the King of the Hejaz, Nejd and its Dependencies, Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdurrahman-al-Faisal-al-Saud. May God help him ! “ Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. “ After enquiries about your health and comfort, we hope, please God, that- you, your noble sons, and all your friends, are quite well, enjoying the best of health and complete happiness every year. If you ask about your servants, we are, by the grace of God the Almighty and your kindness, as well as you may wish; there is nothing but prosperity and good health. We have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your noble letter of the 15th September, 1930, which we gladly read out from, and from which we were delighted to learn of your safety and good health, may you ever live in happiness and prosperity. As regards the discus'sion with your Majesty’s delegation concerning the things necessary for the improvement and organisation of our country, we have immediately conversed with these friends in the presence of the Imam As Sayyid A1 Hasan and agreed upon the decision forwarded to you herewith. The Imam telegraphed at once to you accordingly. The friends, your Majesty’s delegation, will certainly inform you of this fact. All other of the country’s affairs are explained in the letter of the Imam addressed to your Majesty. “ Hoping that you are in the best of health and happiness, please God. may you live long protected, our Master. “ Legislative Council, Sabia. “ October 10, 1930.” Copy of the Decision of the Council.
