The Sultan’s statement that the highest offers which he has so far received from the Burma Shell Company are Rs.50&gt;000 on execution of the Agreement, Rs. 1500 per mensem during the currency of the Agreement, and Rs.150,000 on taking up the concession, seems most surprising in view of the terms of the draft Agreement v/hich the Burma Oil Company sent to us on the loth September 1938 and which they said had Been submitted to the Sultan. A copy of this Agreement was sent to you on the 22nd Novernier. In Articles 2, 5 and 7 of that draft the relevant figures are given as Rs.75?000, Rs.2,500 and Rs. 150,000 respectively.

Information received from London representative of Indian Oil Concessions Limited indicates, that this Company has obtained a prospecting lease over Kalat territory surrounding Gwadur, though execution of formal agreement has been delayed as result of Company's desire to safeguard their position financially in case they should wish to proceed later to mining lease. I should be glad if you would confirm and keep me fully informed of developments. 3./2 . 3* If this information as to the Kalat concession is correct, I shall be glad to have your views on the suggestion made by Political Resident in paragraph 4 of his letter, which is supported by the Petroleum Department, that the Sultan should be informed of His Majesty's Government's preference that concession should be granted to the Durmah Oil Company, should their terms suit him equally well. Please in particular give your views on the quest! ,n of the desirability of two separate companies holding concessions on the two sides -f the Gwadur-Kalat frontier. ,^s Cult an was asked to consider postponing a decision, until .it was known which Company had obtained the Kalat concession, in view of the undesirability of having two Companies operating in these areas, he might consider our advice somewhat contradictory if now told of our preference for Burmah Oil Company, when it is known that their rivals have secured Kalat concession. 4.

Dear Gihson, Your letter r.Z. 8035/38 of 19th Decenfoer about oil concessions in G-wadur. Since you wrote that letter you have sent us (with India Office printed letter P. 1.8346/38 of 24th December) a copy of a letter from /atts dated 29th November. The first point I would like to make is with regard to some apparent discrepancies in the financial terns actually proposed by the Burma Oil Company for the concession and those reported to 1'atts by the Sultan as having been offered by them. I enclose a table comparing the various offers as actually mo.de and as reported by the Sultan. The important point is that the Sultan’s version of the B.O.G. terms ((4) of table) is appreciably less f .v air able than their terms embodied in the draft Agreement sent by the Company to you on 16th September last which they stated had been submitted to the Sultan (P.2.6467/38 and (3) of table). I assume that a copy of this draft agreement was sent to Fowle. /[he draft Agreement with I.O.C. sent to us by Watts embodies (see paragraph 3 of 'Watts’ letter) the Sultan’s own demands ((1) of table) rather than what he says I.O.C. are offering ((2) of table), which lies between B.O.C.’s actual offe: and their offer as represented by the Sultan/. It rather looks as if the Sultan is actually using the terms of the B.O.C. offer to push up the I.O.C. offer, and the former Company may, therefore, not be getting o fair run even/ g. Gibson, Bsq., India Office, Phite ha11, S. 7. 1.2. even from the purely commercial point of vie*;/. \7e feel that this matter ought to be looked into at once by your ^eople on the spot, In so far as it is v/ithin their power to do so. On the more general question we do not think that any particular disadvantage would be likely to arise from the fact that, if I.O.C. get the Kalat concession and 3.O.C. get Gwadur, there will be two companies operating in adjoining territory. On this point and the more general issue of British versus foreign concessionaires, we agree with Fowle’s view', quoted in paragraph 3 of your letter of 19 th December, that any disadvantage that might arise from the operation of rival companies in Gwadur and Kalat would be more than off-set by the fact of a British Company obtaining the Gwadur c oncession. Our view, therefore, is that (1) steps should be taken to ascertain whether, to speak bluntly, the Sultan is giving the B.O.C. a fair show and (2) that he should be told that H.M. G. would prefer the concession to go to 73.0.G. Yours sincerely, (3d.) F. C. Starling.© / C4L P.Z.8035/33 India Office? tv vTliitehall ? S . 7-f . 1. 19th December? 1938 Dear Starling? We sent you on the 9th Decernoer (India Oaj. ice le cter No. P.Z.8035/38) a copy of an express letter dated the 26th ilovember from the Political resident m tne nersian Gul f on the suhrjcct of oil Concessions in Guadur. 2, You will have seen from it that? as suggested hy the Government of India (Paragraph 5 of express letter aaoed tne 27th June? copy sent to you on the 4th July under cover of India Office letter ITo. P.Z.4666/36), the undesirahility of having two rival companies operating side oy side in Kalat and Gwadur has 'been pointed out to the Sultan? to \;lio.n it has heen suggested that before giving a concession in Gwadur he might wait to see which company is successful in Kalat. 3. powle now expresses the view that any disadvantage that might arise from the operations of rival companies m Gwadur and Kalat would 'be more than offset by the fact of a British Company obtaining the Gwadur Concession, and suggests tnau the Sultan might be informed that if there is nothing to choose between the terms offered by the two companies His Majesty/ p.C. Starling Esq.? Petroleum Department? Dean Stanley Street? S.W.l.a r\ 2 . Majesty's Government would naturally prefer the concession to he given to a wholly-British Company. s 4. This suggestion would however face the Sultan with a dilemma 9 since ; as I understand from Ballantyne ; Indian Oil Concessions Ltd. have 'been promised concessional rights in the adjoining territory by the Khan of Kalat, though the details of the agreement have not yet been finally settled. We should therefore be grateful if you could let us have your views (a) on the opinion expressed by Kowle ; and? if you agree with his view, (b) on his suggestion that the Sultan should be told of His Majesty's Government's preference. In view of the action already taken in pursuance of the Government of India's view of the undesirability of having two companies operating side by side in Gwadur and Kalat ? we shall also require their views before orders are sent to the Political Resident. 5. We think that the governing considerations in this case are first that we should not on the grounds of nationality try to influence the Sultan against giving the concession to the applicant v/hose terms suit him best financially? (especially as Muscat finances are none too good), and secondly that it would be inconvenient to have different concessionaires in Gwadur and neighbouring Kalat territory.qs&gt; - ll The 'best course therefore seems to he not to address any communication to the Sultan for the moment hut to ascertain from he Government of India whether the Khan of Xalat has granted or is likely to grant the Xalat concession to Indian Oil Concessions Ltd. or to the Burmah Oil Co. 6. The Political Agent, Muscat, in the enclosure to Fowle's letter, refers to the Admiralty view that it is very desirable that the Gwadur concession should go to the Burmah Oil Company. I understand that the service consideration is less the nationality of the controlling interests in the Company than the need to ensure that the Company’s products are subject to rights of pre-emption by Government, the former being of importance in so far as control over a purely British Company is more secure. From the Admiralty standpoint there may not be so much to choose between the two Companies competing in Gwadur, since Indian Oil Concessions Ltd. is legally a British Company, registered in India, and will be required, if it gets the Gwadur concession, to enter into an agreement with His Majesty’s Government which will cover the matter of pre-emption. Ballantyne is aware of this, and assures us there will be no difficulty about it. These considerations might be taken into account/. n 4. account in deciding whether the Sultan should he given a lead in favour of the Burmah Oil Company notwithstanding the disadvantages, such as they may he, of having another Company operating next door to Gwadur. 7. I should add that it seems possible that the matter will be deeided by purely financial factors.- since we have had some indication that the Burmah Oil Company are not disposed to improve or. their present offer and will thus probably be outbid hy the rival Company. 8. I am sending a copy of this letter to Jarrett at the Admiralty and Eyres at the Foreign Office. Yours sincerely, ($Sgd&lt;} p, QSBSO^CONFIDENTIAL. 7 .

Dear Mr. Ballantyne* The Sultan of Muscat, with reference to the negotiations for the grant of an oil concession in Gv/adur which are being carried on i.ith him by Indian Oil Concessions Limited, has suggested that the Company should be asked to give him a written statement to the effect that their offer for a concession is made on the understanding that any agreement between the Company and the Sultan would be contingent upon the approval of His Majesty’s Government. I am accor ingly desired to ask that the Company may be moved to take action on these lines, which incidentally will render unnecessary the tentative paragraph on this point which was shown as deleted from Article 27 of the draft agreement of which you sent us copies on the 28th April. With regard to the terms of the draft Agreement I am asked to say that the reference in Article 7 to the finding of crude oil in commercial quantities is felt to be open to objection, and, as there is no apparent necessity for reference to a declaration of commercial production as an alternative to a declaration of intention to take up the mining concession, I am to sugge t that the words 'that it has found petroleum Crude oil in commercial quantities or’’ might be omitted. A consequential alteration in the same Article would be the substitution of rt in which case' for 'in either of which cases'• I am also to suggest that the v^ords 'subject to his approval of its constitution' migh^ be added to Article 22, relating to the transfer of the concession to another Company, H.R.Ballantyne, Osq.

Dear Gibaon, May X offer aoi^e coi^ente on your letter of 19th j^eoeiiiber, F« u .d0d6/3B to Starling, about the Swadur Oil Oonceaeion, with a view to making more clear the Admiralty's attitude towards tne grant of this concession to Indian Oil Joncesaiona or the Bumah Oil Company. E. as the basis of a consideration of this question we accept (1) that Indian Oil Concessions are prepared to outbid substantially the Burmoh Oil Company, (£) that Indian Oil Conceosione have obtaix;ed a concession over kalat. If either or both of these aoauLiptioiia proved incorrect, it might be necessary to mouify our view. 3. &gt;«e have previously expressed a preference for the Burmah Oil Company on grounds of nationality. In view, however, of the two new factors mentioned above, we would be prepared to withdraw our preference and leave the Sheikh a free hand, provided that (1) suitable provisions are made for ensuring that Indian Oil Concessions retains its nominal British registry, and continues to satisfy the requirements which we gatner are laid down under present Indian law for the maintenance of 50&amp; British share capital, (k) Indian Oil Concessions enters into a Political Agreement on the Debai model, with a pre-emption agreement to the Admiralty's satisfaction, (3) if it proves practicable, the Company enters into refinery agreement, which might take account also of/ J.i. Gibson, Esq., India Office, ■•wws'moil to bo won tnm the Kalat conoeosion as reg!irdB f for example 9 the miniitum produotion figure at which a refinery could be demanded. If theue requirements oiui be satisfied^ we are inclined to think that the advantage of having the British company in would be offset by the disadvantages of the reduction involved to tiie bultan'e revenues and the existence of competing companies in the neighbouring territories of Gw&amp;dur and Kalat* The last-mentioned factor would be of eome importance if it is true that oil from kaltit would have to be shipped through dwadur* Economy and efficiency would in that case be beet served if one company operated both territories, and there would thus be more chance of our getting a refinery* 4* tilth reference to India Office letter of £4th December, i *2*^44/30 forwarding the draft of the Indian Oil Ooncessions agreement, w# would suggest that consideration might be given to inserting in article El speciflo provision for the maintenance of the 50 British interest in scoordanoe with the suggestion in my letter of the 37th June, 1^30* 5* $e assume that in article 1, line 18, words such as 'shall not include' have boon omitted after ,, Ooiapany , s operation'* Also Subsection (g) of Article 7 might commence with the words '’Except as provided in Article 1'. 6. 1 am sending copies of this letter to isyres (Foreign Office; and starling (Petroleum Department;.

Information regarding K&amp;lat concession mentioned in paragraph 2 is correct. Indian Oil Concessions Limited have obtained concession in Mekran Area. (Papers on this subject are being forwarded to you separately). 3. With reference to paragraph 3 of your Express letter, we do not agree with the suggestion made by the Political Resident in paragraph 4 of his letter No. 639-S, dated 26th November 1938. Indian Oil Concessions Limited are bound under their Articles of Association to maintain their predominantly British character and if they obtain the Gwadur concession our desiderata in an emergency should be adequately safeguarded by the Company f s agreements with the lultan and His Majesty’s Government, le are also strongly of opinion that the Gwadur concession should be given to the same Company as has obtained the Mekran concession viz. Indian Oil Concessions Limited. Gwadur,-1 — 2 Grwadur territory is only a very small enclave on the Mokran coast and if the Burma Oil Company were/to obtain the concession for it, it would probably only have a nuisance value to them. On the other hand, if the concession is given to Indian Oil Concessions Limited they can use Gwadur as a port for the shipment of oil from Mekran without the possibility of meeting with obstruction from a rival firm and there will^no urgent necessity to demarcate the Gwadur-Kalat boundary unless oil is located in its immediate vicinity. (Difficulty is likely to arise over this demarcation as the Khan of Kalat who claims sovereignty over Gwadur will probably refuse to cooperate.) Finally it is undesirable as you point out, to give the Sultan advice which is directly contradictory to that which has previously been given to him and also to endeavour to persuade him not to give the concession to the Company which he favours and which is oxter ing him better terms, except for very strong reasons such as are not apparent in the present case. We would recommend therefore that no attempt should be made to persuade the Sultan to give the concession to the Burma Oil Company.

Subject:- Mining concessions in the Kalat State. Official intimation has now been received from tne Political Agent, Kalat, regarding the negotiations, that have so far taken place between the Kalat State and tne Burnah Oil Company and the Indian Oil Concessions Ltu., in the matter of oil concessions in the Kalat State. 2. The general outline of the preliminary agreements reached is as follows. Subject to final agreement on the terms of the necessary prospecting licenses, which are under discussion, and their approval by Government where necessary, the Burmah Oil Company will be granted the concessions applied for by them in the Bolan and Kachhi areas, and the Indian Oil Concessions will be given the concession applied for by them in Mekran. In consideration for these concessions, each of the two companies will pay to the Kalat State, in addition to the annual acreage feefa referred to hereafter, an initial non-recurring payment (’•Salami’*) of Rs.two lakhs and annual recurring payment of Rs.one lakh * the latter sum will be utilised for expenditure on education in the State. As acreage fee, the Burmah Oil Company will pay annual fees of eight annas per acre for their •♦selected areas’* in the Bolana and Kachni / ext end i ng2- extending to about 187.35 square miles, and two annas per acre for the large area of the Kachhi plain extending to about 4,600 square miles. The area covered by tne concession to tne Indian Oil concessions is approximately 17,000 square miles in Mekran, and the annual acreage fee will amount to about Hs.four lakns. r\ Under this arrangement, tne Kalat State will get about Rs. 5,28,000 from the hurmah Oil company and its. five lakns from the Indian Oil Concessions Limited annually. 3. Both the companies are anxious to ensure tnat tne draft terms of the prospecting licenses should contain some provision to ensure their being able to obtain mining leases subsequently on reasonable terms. The Kalat State however, take their stand on the British Indian procedure and hold that they should not be required to give any more definite assurance than what is contain ed in the British Indian models. It is believed tnat this question will soon be settled between the negotiating parties. 4. The Kalat State authorities are being reminded that Government reserves to itself the right to approve of the terms of any prospecting license granted even in State-administered territory, and that the terms of any prospecting license should therefore be communicated by them as soon as possible. This is also being brought to the attention of the two companies. In view of the administration of Bolan vesting in the Government of India, the Burmah Oil Company are being further informed that administrative approval of the Political Agent should be obtain ed before any operations are taken in hand.

So far as Kalat claims enter into the matter we see no reason why your Company should hesitate to sign an agreement with the sultan.

The claim was rejected by the Government of India. It was also stated by the local authorities in this connexion that the Gitchkis cannot have any claim apart from that of the Kalat State. The Government of India's decision is not necessarily the last word since the Khan has the right to appeal to the Secretary of State. But we have received no indication that the State intends to exercise the right, nor is it at all likely that if they did the Government of India’s decision would not be upheld. Yours sincerely.

MQ^/WAG 15th June, 19 59 Dear Mr. Gibson I understand! that the origin of the connection between Muscat and Gwadar was that a former Khan of Kalat • permitted an ancestor of the present Sultan ? who was fugitive from Muscat 5 to reside at Gwadar and enjoy its revenuesj but I am unable to discover whether this arrangement was ever formally regularized. In any case ; at the time when it originated there was presumably no question of any revenue from minerals. It seems ? therefore, that there may be a possibility that the Sultan's right to dispose of the petroleum rights and to receive the royalties thereon might be disputed by the Khan of Kalat, - or by the Gichkis, who, I believe, are entitled to a share in the revenues of parts of Mekran. Before we sign any agreement with the Sultan, we shall need to be assured that the mineral rights have been definitely ceded to him or that they will be so ceded when the settlement of the boundary is made. Gan you reassure me on this point ? Meantime we are awaiting the Sultan's reaction to our latest proposals, and it is not yet certain whether we shall come to terms with him. Yours sincerely, (Gd.)

DEAN STANLEY STREET, MILLBANK, 5 ) j LONDON, S.W.l. 27th April, 1939 Dear Peel Your letter P.3.1780/39 of the 3rd April about oil concessions in Gwadur. 2. Prom the Government of India's express letter of the 15th March enclosed with India Office letter 1.3.1780/39 of 25th March and the Memorandum 0/53(35) of the 27th January from Quetta enclosed with India Office letter P.3.1999/39 of the 5th April I note that, subject to final agreement on the terms of prospecting licences, the present position in the State of Kalat generally is that the Burmah Oil Company is to be granted the concessions applied for ^ by them in the Bolan and Kachi areas and that Indian Oil Concessions have been promised a concession in the Mekran area of Kalat, part of which adjoins Gwadur. 3. 7Yhile we think that the Sultan of Muscat has not treated the Burmah Oil Company altogether fairly in respect of Gwadur, it would be useless now to enter into any further discussion of the various offers and counter-offers which have been made. I am writing to say that in all the circumstances, and in view of the opinions expressed by the Government of India and of the Admiralty, we do not wish to press any further the claims of the Burmah Oil Company in so far as Gwadur is concerned. From the penultimate paragraph R.T.Peel, Esq., M.C., India Office, Whitehall, d.VT.l.2 . of your letter, Indian Oil Concessions themselves are apparently not altogether happy about the dultan of Muscat’s attitude. 4. Apart from Kalat and Gwadur, the Burmah Oil Company are also, I understand, interested in that part of the Mekran coast which comes under the sovereignty of Las Bela. ih^ Company have in fact told us privately that they have applied for certain specifically defined areas in the Las Bela Mekran, which they have selected as the result of much careful geological work. T .Ye believe also that Indian Oil Concessions have put in a ;T blanket TT application for the whole of this area in the hope of embracing within it the particular areas in which the Burmah Oil Company are interested. 5. 7fe would like to suggest, therefore, for the consideration of your Department that, if the .Burmah Oil Company forego their claims to Gwadur (and thus make the path of Indian Oil Concessions easier as regards securing a concession in Gwadur and tnc use of Gwadur as a port for the shipment of oil from Kalat), the Government of India might be requested to support the Burmah Oil Company’s applications in the Las Bela coastal area. I presume that the Government of India would prefer to have a portion of the Baluchistan developed by the Burmah Oil Company rather than that this largo area should be entirely controlled by a Company which is apparently going to be financed by foreign capital. 6.

As Indian Oil Concessions have obtained a concession for the adjacent Kalat territory, we adhere to our previous view that they should also be allowed tc have the Gwadur Concession, although they have not, apparently, outbid their rivals by any substantial margin. Ne still consider, however, that the consent of 11,d. Government to the Concession should be conditional upon the requirements set out in paragraph 3 of Jones' letter M. 07598/39 of 11th February, though we recognise, «f course, that the Company may not agree to the proposed refinery agreement.

We note that your Company have decided to withdraw their application for concessionary rights in Gv/adur, and that it is proposed to offer the Sultan an ex gratia payment of Rs.75,000. v/e do not think that this generous treatment of the Sultan on the part of your Company could in any way embarrass the Government of India.

You may care to have this note of latest developments for your file record. 2. On 15th August I told you that we had now no further interest in Gv/adar (the hinterland of Kalat having gone to another oil company) and that provided that our withdrawal would not embarrass the India Office or the Government of India in any way we would prefer now to break off negotiations with the Sultan. You were able to confirm that you could see no objection to our doing so and in this connection you mentioned that the boundary difficulty, while not an insuperable one and therefore not a determining factor? was such that an arrangement which left both Gwadar and the surrounding hinterland in the same hands from the point of view of oil development would be least likely to cause trouble. 3. We have now definitely decided to withdraw our application for any concessionary rights in Gwadar and as you will see from the attached draft letter v/e have decided to offer to pay to the Sultan ex gratia the amount of the ’salaami' which we would have paid to him on signature if the draft agreement recently under discussion had been carried to completion. You will probably think this at least quixotic? and I hope that it will not embarrass the Government of India in any way. Our action has been determined by the fact that while v/e v/ill in no circumstances make any underhand Peel? Esq.? M.C.? or/ India Office? Whitehall? S.W.l.or secret payment to any Ruler,, or to any official in any State + or Province, we attach great importance to our reputation for the fairest possible dealing in open negotiations, and we do not care to incur the slightest risk of a suggestion - v/hich would of course have no foundation, hut that is not the point - that ■ in continuing discussion with the Sultan during the last few months we have been guilty of any moral breach of faith. 4. Perhaps you would be good enough to pass on this information to India, as we promised to keep the Resident in the Persian Gulf fully informed of development Yours sincerely, (Sd.) W.E.V. Abraham. +and for your information we lost a concession in India last year rather than break this ruleReply to be sent by Agent, Burmah Oil Company, Ltd., Karachi to the Representative of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. We have the honour to thank you for your letter of 12th July 1959 and to say in reply that while we think it probable that the points of difference now remaining between us could be settled amicably we do not now wish to avail ourselves of the option which (in effect) His Highness has expressed willingness to grant us for a concession over his Gwadar territory. The chief reason for this is that our geologists have now advised that while they were willing to recommend exploration of His Highness’ Gwadar territory in conjunction with similar exploratory work v/hich we had hoped to be allowed to carry out in the adjoining Kalat territory they are not prepared to recommend such work on the isolated Gwadar territory alone now that the Kalat territory is not available for us. We have the honour therefore to withdraw our application for any concessionary rights in His Highness' Gwadar territory. As a mark of our good faith, hov/ever, and in appreciation of the fairness with which His Highness has dealt with us during these negotiations, we are willing, if His Higness so desires, to make to His Highness an ex gratia payment of Rs. 75,000, this being the amount of the ’salaami' v/hich we v/ould have paid to His Highness on signature if the present draft agreement had, after mutual arrangement in respect of points of difference, been carried to completion.P.Z.6708/39, ■H Britannic Bouse, Finsbu^ Circus, L on b on, E.
