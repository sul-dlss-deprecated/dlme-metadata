The onomatopoetic Egyptian name was \"miu\" (mjw) for the male, and \"mit\" (mjjt) for the female cat. Egypt's economic base was agriculture and therefore rodent- and snake-hunting felines were very much appreciated. In terms of religious beliefs the male cat was connected to the sun-god, and the female cat to Bastet. Particularly in the Late and Greco-Roman Periods representations of the goddess as well as cats and cats with kittens became very popular to symbolize fertility and renewal. \r\n\r\nThis amulet displays a seated female cat with a kitten in front of her. This kitten is facing the right and has the same posture as its mother. The amulet has a rectangular base and a loop on the back of the cat.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/6840", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "30th-early Ptolemaic Dynasty", "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-29T12:36:16.28", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1554_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1554_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1554_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1554_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1554_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1452865, 1543485", "ExhibIDs": "2172", "Images": "CUR_48.1554_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_48.1554_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_48.1554_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_48.1554_Lft_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_48.1554_Rt_DD_RS2009.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
