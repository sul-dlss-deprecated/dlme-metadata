Fowle's view is that it was undesirable to have any such treaty at all, until the Government of Saudi Arabia raised the issue, and this view is endorsed in subsequent correspondence and minutes from the Colonial Office, the Foreign Office, the India Office, and the Government of India.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Deportation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00017e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
