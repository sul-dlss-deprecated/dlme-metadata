The file therefore contains occasional references to political developments within China, and her diplomatic relations with Japan. The file also includes correspondence regarding an aviation agreement signed between France and Siam [Thailand], and related agreements between the British and Siamese Governments.More direct routes are also explored in the file, in particular a route via the Southern Shan States and French Indo-China. A report by Frederick Tymms, Director of Civil Aviation in India, on a reconnaissance flight between 25 and 26 April 1937 has been included: see folios 165-168. For the conclusions of the survey: see folios 190-192. An appended report on the landing ground at Loikaw can be found on folios 169-171. Three maps accompany the report: see folios 172-173 and 193.For further information a copy of a report by Georges Winckler of an exhibition through Laos and Upper Burma between 8 and 17 February 1936 has also been filed: see folios 174-186. The purpose of Winckler's exhibition was to explore the possibilities of a direct route between France and French Indo-China [Vietnam].An additional sketch map outlining possible overland routes between Burma and Hong Kong can be found on folio 260.The main correspondents are officials of the Air Ministry, the Foreign Office, and the India Office. A significant amount of correspondence with the Government of India – Department of External Affairs and the Department of Industries and Labour – and correspondence with numerous British representatives across Burma, China, and Siam, have also been included.The French language content consists of a single letter (folios 253-254) from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated 10 March 1936.The file includes three dividers (folios 2, 95, and 131) which gives a list of correspondence references contained in that section of the file by year.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>China National Aviation Company</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Civil Aviation in India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eurasia Aviation Corporation</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Indochina</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Airways</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Industries and Labour Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Economic Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Yunnan Province</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Siam</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Burma</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>China</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Airlines</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000230#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000230#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000230#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
