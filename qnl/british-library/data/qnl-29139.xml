His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz is being told that this need not upset any payments in Sterling for fees such as those described in paragraph 5 of Chancery’s letter Jtfo. 670 /II /39 of the 13 th .December to the Consular Department. trust that this extension of the arrangements made in the enclosure to Mr. Roberts’ despatch No. 377 of the 4 th December will meet with Your Lordship’s approval. It was decided on for two reasons. In the interval the official rate of exchange had on the one hand moved against sterling, thus increasing the loss entailed by bringing into account at the black rate fees that had been collected at the official rate. On the other hand the nominal nature of this official rate had been even more definitely admitted in a letter of the 23rd December from the Ministry of Forei.gj Affairs to my American colleague to the effect that the American Consulate here was now entitled to benefit by the sale of exchange at the black rate and that therefore permits for the purchase of exchange could no longer be / issued Honourable Viscount Halifax, N.a., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.jS., etc., etc., etc., FOREIGN OFFICEissued.

A1 (8/12/40). 7th February 1940. !vly Lord, n With reference to my despatch No. 9 10th January lest, I have the honour to report that His Majesty*s Consul-General at Meshed has informed me of a difficulty which has arisen in his district in regard to the collection of Consular fees at the current black rate of exchange. 2 . This difficulty is connected with the arrange ments in force at Zahidan for the grant of long-term visas to British Indian drivers on the Zahidan-Nuk-Kundi road. The practice is for the local police to collect fees from drivers at the same rate as that charged by His Majesty*s Vice-Consulate. If therefore the rates vary from day to day , to keep pace with the present rapid fall in the rial, difficulties are likely to ensue. Mr. Squire has reported that in the circum stances, he has instructed His Majesty's vice-consul at Zahidan to adopt for all such transactions the monthly rate fixed by His Majesty's Consul, Tehran, in his capacity as Treasury Officer of the Government of India, for the payment of pensions and other disbursements from Government of India funds. Mr. Lquire further suggests that, for the sake of uniformity, all Consular posts in his district of East Iran should use this rate. / 4- The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, jC«G., G.C.b.i., G.O . .1 • E • , etc., etc., etc., FOREIGN OFFICE.4 . As the loss to His Majesty*• Government, in view of the small amounts involved, is not likely to he considerable, I have provisionally approved Mr* Squired action in regard to Zahidan and also his suggestion that the other posts in his district should adopt the same procedure* I trust that this action will meet with Your Lordship’s approval.

The head office of the Imperial 3anic of Iran in Tehran has o tained official authority to buy sterling at the market rate from His '/.ajeaty’s Legation for distribution to importing merch ants. You should therefore consult with the lo^al nun ^^r of that bank as to what arrangements can best be made for the sale of your bills on the Foreign Office and your personal cheque*.

Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Kden to state for the information of the Secretary of State for India that he has had under consideration the question of the desirability of purchasing Iranian currency at unofficial rates of exchange, having regard to the increasing disparity between the official rate of exchange (80 rials = £1) and the purchasing power of the currency. 2. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has now been authorised to purchase currency at unofficial rates to meet the official requirements of His Majesty’s Legation and the personal requirements of individual members of his staff, but as will be seen from the enclosed copy of correspondence it is not at present possible to extend this facility to Consular Officers in the provinces.

I see no objection to inclusion of local requirements of Office of Forks in this scheme (and I am mauing arrangements accordingly) but I would prefer at any rate for the time being to exclude his Majesty's Consular officers in Iran apart from His Majesty’s Consul here, ky reason for this is that Iran Government have lately considerably tightened their restrictions and watch on foreign Consulates and I am anxious to avoid anything which might give excuse to Iran Government to follow recent example of ooviet Government in demanding so-called parity in Consular establishments. Position of ‘'Indian' Consulates is of course considerably more delicate than that of 'Levant' Consulates.

Circular Despatch No. 18 (116/30/37) Sir As you are aware, Article 16 of the regulations for the application of the foreign exchange law of the 1st March, 1936, provided that the banks aultorised to engage in the purchase and sale of exchange might sell a limited quantity of foreign exchange for the purchase of books and the payment of subscriptions to newspapers etc., without the necessity of making applications to the Exchange Control Commission. 2. Early this year it was learnt, however, that the Imperial Bank of Iran had been instructed by the Exchange Control Commission that such sales of exchange might not be made to foreigners but only to Iranian Subjects. I accordingly enquired of the Commission whether any change had been made in the regula tions and was informed in reply that experience had shown that the facilities accorded by Article 16 of the regulations had resulted, when taken in conjunction with Article 15 (c), in a number of foreigners remitting out of Iran more than 50/£ of their total salaries. It had therefore been decided that exchange could not be granted to foreigners under Article 16 without con sideration being taken at the same time of any applications which they might have put forward under Article 15; and the discretion given to the banks under Article 16 was accordingly withdrawn. At ';he same time, however, the Commission have an assurance that licences would always be issued in respect of sums required for the purchase of books, papers etc., by His Majesty’s Legation and Consulates. /3. His Majesty’s Consular Officer1957 j •&lt; — —' 3. The Gommission have since agreed that facilities under Article 16 may continue to he accorded to His Majesty’s Legation in respect of the foreign exchange required for the purchase of hooks etc., for their official needs, since in this case no question of 50% of any figure arises. They have not, however, agreed to my request that similar facilities should he extended to His Majesty’s Consulates in respect of their official re quirements. I am naturally willing to renew this request , if necessary, hut judging from the number of applications which have reached the Legation from Consulates, it would appear that in most cases His Majesty’s Consular Officers have been able to make their own arrangements for such payments and that reference to the Commission is in practice seldom necessary. It therefore does not seem worth while pursuing the question of special facilities further unless experience shows that the present system is causing any real inconvenience. special 4 . You should note that such^facilities, if obtained would in any case only apply to the purchase of foreign ex change out of official funds for hooks, newspapers etc., pur chased for official purposes. The Commission’s present require ments make it necessary for all individuals, whether occupying an official position or not, to make special application to the Commission when they require foreign exchange for their own personal needs under this head; and you should regard the terms of my Circular Despatch No. 4 of the 16th January last as being amended accordingly. 5.

With regard to the meaning of Article 7 of the Exchange Law, we agree that the extreme interpretation suggested in paragraph 3 of your letter to Kelf-Cohen No. h 75/20/34 of the 29th January ie so absurd that it could not be enforced in practice. Nevertheless we suspect that if approached, the Iranian Government would say that this ie their interpretation of it. At any rate we have found that one British Lubject, Badhni, who has a sterling contract for the maintenance of the Legation electire light plant, ie afraid to taxe payment in sterling outside Iran, although he badly/ K. .uaggallay Lsq., The Foreign Office S.W.l.bsdly needs it far insurance premiums etc. *e thintc that he ia perhaps unnecessarily cautious, ana n the aoeence of any statement fram the Iranian Government that Article 7 of the Law is to bear the extreme interpretation you suggtet, we do not thine we need oe deterred by that Article from paying official debts to British Subjects in sterling or rupees out&gt; iae Iran. 4. As it is clear from the correspondence enclosed in your despatch No.47 that it will not be possible to bring private non-commercial remittances by British Subjects within the scope of the commercial negotiations, we do not think that th^re is any use in asking the Iranian Government for any special arrange ents for British Subjects.

I have therefore carefully considered the possibilities of helping such people and am now addressing a circular despatch to all His Majesty’s Consular Officers in Iran Instructing them how to proceed. When British subjects who desire to continue to reside in this country find Auch difficulty in obtaining per- mission to remit even small sums abroad, there Is a real risk in applicants who desire to remit all their assets abroad unless it is certain that they are ready themselves to leave the country* Were a successful applicant to export hie capital and then to re main on in Iran himself, the only result would be to prejudice his more deserving brethren in the eyes of the Kxchange Control Commission. In my circular despatch, of which a copy is enclosed herein, I a® therefore asking all Hia Majesty’s consular Officers only to request my support in oases which they have every reason to believe are genuine. Should the policy of supporting individual requests not meet with success, it may prove necessary to make general representations once more. But in view of the reluctance of the Exchange Control commission to moke any general promises, I consider that more is likely to be gained at the moment by pressing each case separately. 4* A separate despatch is being addressed to you with regard to the present position undsr the exchange law of British subject who are continuing to reside in Iran but who desire to remit occasional or regular sums abroad. I have the honour to be with the highest respect. Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, (S^igned) H.J. Seymour.OX:.OuLAH H Nq, 3 (116/2/37) Sir, When the Exchange control Law waa passed on the 1st March last, reports were received from some of His Majesty's Consular Officers that a numher of British Subjects resident in their dis tricts, and more especially Indians, had decided that the outlook for foreigners doing business in this country was no longer attractive# They therefore desired to liquidate their businesses leave the country and export their capital or savings# 2# As there seemed to be a widespread desire in this sense and as neither the Exchange Control Law nor regulations made any provision for the export of capital in such circumstances, Mr# Butler addressed a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs drawin, attention to the position and expressing the hope that British Subjects who desired to leave the country would be given faciliti either to export their capital in the form of cash or to export Iranian produce without the obligation to sell to the Exchange Control Commission the proceeds of the sale of such exports# Mr# Butler further requested that he might be informed of the views of the Iranian Government in this matter in order that he might be in a position to offer advice to the British Subjects concerne 3# The reply received to this note was to the effect that the authorities concerned could not take any decision without having full particulars in each case of the amount of capital involved, the nature of such capital (whether in goods, cash, land etc#,), the proposals of the applicants with regard to the conversion of their assets into cash and the period and manner in which they wished to remit their capital abroad. The Iranian Government /therefore Hie Majesty's Consular Officer- 2 - therefor© requested that His Majesty*e Legation should forward a list of the property of all British Subjects concemed t mentioning all the above details, in order that the matter might be further considered. 4. This reply is disappointing in that it gives no idea whether the Exchange Control Commission are prepared in principle to give sympathetic consideration to such cases; and the request that the Legation should make themselves responsible for correctly drawing up and forwarding all applications is clearly inaceeptable. Such a task would not only involve an amount of work which the Legation staff could not perform, but it might also be impossible for the Legation, in some cases, to accept full responsibility for the accuracy of the statements made by the applicants. At the same time it is reasonable that the Exchange Control Commission should requiri to know full details in each case and some encouragement may be derived from the fact that the Iranian Government have not stated that applications of this nature cannot be entertained. I also appreciate that the applications of British Subjects&gt;are more likely to receive a sympathetic hearing of they are backed by the support of His Majesty’s Legation. I have accordingly given the matter careful consideration in the light -if the position as revealed above and I have decided that, while British subjects must continue as at present to bear the responsibility of drawing up and submitting their own applications, official support may be given to individual applications which are recommended to me as deserving if and when it becomes apparent that the British Subject concerned has been unable to obtain any satisfaction from the Commission as a result of his own end avours. 5. I shall therefore be glad to receive from you, whenever occasion may arise, full details of any outstanding applications from British Subjects who have left or desire to leave the country and who wish to remit all their assets abroad. You should quote all the particulars mentioned in paragraph 3 above and should1 — 3 — also forward f whenever possible, an English translation of the letters exchanged between the applicant and the Exchange Control Commission* If for any reason you are unable to forward a trans lation, you should supply a summary of the correspondence with dates and, if possible, reference numbers* I should further be glad to Imow in each case whether the applicant has already left this country or whether he merely proi-joses to do so if he can obtain the necessary foreign exchange* 6 * You will appreciate moreover that I am reluctant to support any applicant who desires to remit the whole of his assets abroad unless there is every reason to believe that he will leave the country if his application is successful. If he then merely re mits his money abroad and himself remains in Iran, the result can only be to prejudice the chanceAof other more deserving appli cants* I should accordingly be grateful xm if you would only re quest my support to applications which appear to you to be genuine* 7 . I am dealing separately with the question of non-commercial remittances by British Subjects who do not desire to leave this country in my circular despatch Jfo* 4 of to-day*s date* I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, *1661 r\ Ti t 16th January, 1937. Ho. 16 (116/6/37) Sir, In his despatch Ho. 253 of the 18th May last Mr. Butler had the honour to forward to you copies of a note which he was addressing to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that sympathetic consideration might he given hy the Exchange Control Commission to applications from British Subjects, who desired to transfer abroad money for the support of their dependents or for similar private purposes. 3. I now have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This note does little more than recapitulate the provisions of the exchange regulations, though it goes beyond them at one point by stating that all foreign firms and individuals engaged in commerce here will be allowed to transfer abroad a proportion of their profits; whereas Article 15 (b) of the regulations only makes provision for the transfer of the profits of firms and individuals in direct business relations with ,f &amp;tabli 8 sements public 8 ' , • The conclusion of the note is, however, disappointing in that it implies that applications for which no special pro enter , despite the fact that vision is made cannot be &lt; rtained complete discretion is given to the Exchange Control Commission by the final clause of Article 15 of the regulations. I also enclose copies of Mr. Butler’s reply to this note which was designed to clear up certain obscurities which still existed but /which The Right Honourable Anthony liden, M.C., M• J?• t etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office, London,- 2 - Mich raised no questions of principle; no answer to it has yet been received. 3 . I have since considered the position in the light of this correspondence and of the attitude of the Exchange Con trol Commission as revealed in practice; and it now seems to me that the better policy for His Majesty’s Legation to pur sue is to press individual cases with the Commission rather that to argue the matter in general terms with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the first place the Commission are not absolutely consistent in refusing applications for which no explicit provision is made in the regulations; and secondly it is known that new regulations are being drawn up to deal with the requirements of individuals and there is some hope that the vigorous representation of existing hardships of may have some influence on the drafting of these regulations. I also consider that it is most desirable to insist on the dis cretion which the commission already possess in virtue t* 1 ® final clause of Article 16 of the regulations. I am therefore pressing somewhat as a test case the application of an Indian British Subject from Bandar Abbas who has been refused per mission to remit annually to India the comparitively small sum and of Rupees 640 for the maintenance of his dependents,'“the pay ment of his life insurance premium* A copy of my letter to the Exchange Control Commission is enclosed herein. I have also drafted a despatch to all Consuls, outlining the position and instructing them how to proceed when British subjects apply to them for advice or assistance. I have the honour to enclose herein a copy of this despatch and venture to think that it is self-explanatory. 4. The present position is undoubtedly unsatisfactory and much hardship is being occasioned to British subjects and more especially to Indians. At the same time I am not without hope_ 3 of eooe amelioration® The head of the Exchange Control Commission was by no means unsympathetic when His Majesty's Consul called on him recently to support the applications of various British Subjects, and was emphatic about his desire to meet our requests* It was clear from what he said that not the least part of the Commission's reluctance to grant permits to individuals arose from the fact that they were Inundated by applications from persons of all nationalities in such vol ume that they could not hope to consider each individual case; but he admitted that the British occupied a special position inasmuch as no restrictions existed for foreigners in the United Kingdom or India and he promised that fair treatment would be given to individual applications which received the backing of His Ilajesty's Legation* 6 * I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India without its first two enclosures, which have already been forwarded to them under cover of my despatch £fo* 268 of the 26th December last* I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, { SljMl) H*&lt;r* HafMB r * P.S* Since the above was drafted, I have received a letter from the Exchange Control Commission, enclosing a permit for the British Subject at Bandar Abbas, mentioned in the third paragraph of this despatch, to remit Rupees 40 per month to hie dependents in India* I am therefore encouraged to hope that applications of this nature, if supported by me with the Commission, will now meet with greater success than they have done in the past*Translation of a Note-Verfcale from the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affaire (Third lolitioal Department) to Hie Majesty Legation* 19th Shahrivar, 1315 (10th September, 1936)* HO. 26890/2727.

In accordance with the exchange law and the relevant regulations, foreign subjects resident in Iran, can, should they be employed In public Institutions, obtain exchange permits for the equivalent of half their salary, wages and other in come In Rials provided the employing institution certify their service and amount of their pay and that they (competent authorities) have made sure as to the accuracy of the amount of their wages* Similarly, foreign subjects and institutions or resid nt in Iran, should they be engaged in commerce''directly in commercial transactions with public institutions of the country, will apart from the fact that their exchange applica tions will be accepted in accordance with commercial regulation?; obtain permits for the transfer of their profits (income ?«) to some extent. These Institutions and subjects can, therefore, meet the expenses which they may have abroad out of the sums of money which they have obtained through one of the above means and which they transfer abroad. Any further assistance would contravene the object (??) and would be against the alms of the exchange law.

His Majesty’s Legation present their compliments to the Director of the Exchange Control Commission and have the honour to invite reference to correspondence ending with the latter’s letter No. 29702 of the 4th November last, regarding the applica tion of a British Subject named Kanthar Nagjee to be allowed to remit to India (a) Rupees 40 per month for the maintenance of his dependents, and (b) Rupees 159-8 per year to pay his life insurance premium. 2. The Commission have refused this application on the ground that only persons employed in Government institutions are allowed to remit a proportion of their pay to foreign countries. In reply His Majesty’s Legation would point out that according to their understanding of the Exchange regulations this privilege is ex tended to persons employed in public institutions and not merely in Government institutions (Article 15 (c) )• They only mention this in passing, however, as it is admitted that Kanthar Nagjee is not employed either in a Government or in a public institution. He is in fact by profession a goldsmith and is not covered by section (a), (b), (c), or (d) of Article 15 of the regulations. His Majesty’s Legation would, however, point out that that article concludes by laying down that M in other cases the Exchange Control Commission is free to reject, accept or reduce applica tions”. It would thus appear that there is nothing in the regu lations to prevent the Exchange Control Commission from granting applications of the present nature should they desire to do so. 3. His Majesty’s Legation would further point out that there are many British Subjects resident in Iran who are neither employed in public institutions (Article 15 (c) ) nor yet in direct busine* relations with public institutions (Article 15 (b)). Such persons necessarily need to remit occasional sums to their own country, whether for the educational expenses of their children, the support of dependents, the payment of insurance premiums or similar claims upon them. The total of such suras is in the aggregate small, as in the present case where the applicant desires to acquire2 no more than Rupees 639-8 per annum. His Majesty’s Legation cannol but feel that the granting of applications for such small amounts could make no appreciable difference to the exchange position of this country; on the other hand the adoption of a more generous attitude towards small applicants by the Commission would un doubtedly help to alleviate a considerable amount of personal hard ship. His Majesty’s Legation liave no reason to believe that the case of the present applicant is either more or less deserving than those of many other British Subjects resident in this country. It is in fact typical of many and the applicant’s request would seem to His Majesty’s Legation both reasonable and deserving of sympathetic consideration. In view of the wording of the final clause of Article 15 of the Exchange regulations they understand it to be within the power of the Commission to grant such requests] and they would accordingly be most grateful if the Commission would have the kindness to reconsider favourably the present application in the light of the considerations set forth above.No, 4 £1.16/5/37) CIRCULAR DESPATCH 16th JANUARY, 1937, CONFIDENTIAL Sir, The experience of several months has now made it possible to gauge with some accuracy the attitude of the Exchange Control Commission towards applications from British Subjects who wish to remit money abroad. In the present despatch I propose to endeavour to elucidate for your information and guidance the position as regards what may be termed non-conmercial remittances, namely sums transferred abroad as savings, or for the maintenance of dependents, the payment of insurance premiums, the purchase of books, newspapers etcetra, 2, Leaving out entirely the question of applications for ex change for strictly commercial purposes, applications for per sonal requirements may be broadly divided into four categories: (a) Applications from persons who wish to purchase or subscribe to books or periodicals. Such applications are covered by Article 16 of the exchange regulations and applicants ought to be able to obtain such small sums as they are likely to require direct from one of the authorised banks without applying to the Exchange Control Commission for sanction; (b) Applications from British Subjects employed in 'itablissements publics' who may be given permission under Article 15 (c) of the regulations to remit up to 50% of their salaries abroad. The Exchange Control Commission are inclined to that this privilege only applies to persons whose contracts expressly pro vide for it; but the regulations themselves contain no such qualification and I should be glad to learn of any case where an application from a British Subject in this category is refused on the ground that his contract makes no provision for the remission of money abroad. His Majesty’s Legation have feKKR re quested fey the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide them with a definition of the phrase 'etablissements publics'; but subject to any reply which I may receive, I think it is possible to interpret this phrase as /covering His Majesty’s Consular Officer at O O 0 « « ,•»»«0 - 2 ~ '/•_ . ^,5v af&amp;nj covering all Government Departments and administra tions, such as the railway, all Iranian public com panies, foreign companies established in Iran, such as the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, the Imperial Bank of Iran and the Consortium Kampsax, and foreign con tracting firms engaged on railway construction or other public works; in these cases ax^plications have to be made in the first case through the employers. Applications from institutions or individuals who are in direct business relations with 'etablissements publics*® Such institutions or individuals are to remit their (a) allowed by Article 15 (b) of the regulations abroad their profits ut&gt; to 10$ of the sumnoi transactions (N.B. NOT 10$ of their profits). This clause should assist in particular persons such as contractors to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, sub contractors working for firms engaged on railway construction etcetra* It is t6 be noted, however, that no provision is made for the transfer abroad of any portion of the salary of employees of such institutions or individuals; and Applications which do not fall under any of the above categories but which the Bycharge Control Commission have authority to accept under the final clause of Article 15 of the regulations® This category covers the great bulk of the cases with which His Kajesty’s Legation and Consulates are concerned and include applications from ( 1 ) // ■ it 1 *4 r British Subjects who desire to leave the country and export the whole of their assets'(I am dealing separately with such persons in my circular despatch No® 3 of to-day^s date), and (2) British Subjects who own private businesses or are employed by persons or firms which are not regarded as '^tablissements publics*, and who wish to remain in this country and at the same time to remit abroad part of their salaries, profits or other savings,^ money for the support of their families or for the payment of insurance premiums etcetra, or perhaps merely occasional small sums. 3. Not long after the introduction of the exchange restrictions Nr. Butler addressed a note to the Ministry of foreign Affairs requesting thatsympathetic treatment should be accorded to applications for relatively small sums from British Subjects who fell under no category for which special provision was made in 4 ^' the regulations,such as those mentioned in category d (2) above. To this note a reply was received which stated inte r alia that /’’foreign‘‘foreign subjects and institutions resident in Iran, should they 'be angaged in commerce •«••••• will, obtain permits for the transfer of their profits to some extent’*. 0 This phrase, as you will observe, covers a wider category of persons and firms than that mentioned in Article 15 (b) of the regulations; and I am led to hope that any British Subjects engaged in commerce in this country will now obtain sanction to transfer some of their profits abroad, though possibly not to the same extent as the special category covered by Article 15 (b) of the regulations* The above-mentioned note from the Ministry o r Foreign Aj-iairs also makes reference to the provisions of Article 15 (b) and (c) of the regulations and then proceeds to state that “any further assistance to (British Subjects) would contravene the object and would be against the aims of the exchange law”. The obvious implication to be drawn from this statement is that t.he Exchange Control Commission only propose to exercise their discretion in favour of foreign subjects and institutions engaged in commerce and that applications from employees, unless they are engaged in “£tablissements publics', will not be entertained. This supposition is unfortunately confirmed by practical experience of the attitude of the Exchange Control Commission; but it has been possible to note an occasional exception to the generax rule and the head of the Commission has stated that new regulations are being prepared which will provide for the requirements of individuals* Meanwhile it is his advice that firms should help their employees by earmarking for the latter’s requirements a portion of their transferable profits. 4. I fear that nothing more is to he gained at the moment by general discussion of the problem with the Iranian (Government; but partly in the hope that the continued representation of the existing state of affairs will lead the authorities to see the necessity of issuing more liberal regulations (and there is /greater- 4 - V - ' Sy greater hope of exercising some influence before rather than after the promised regulations are published) and partly because I consider that it is desirable to insist meanwhile on the dis cretion already given to the Exchange Control Commission by the final clause of Article 15 of the regulations, I have decided to press a selected number of the most deserving applications brought to my notice* I cannot hold out great hopes as to the direct outcome of such action but trust that at least the Government will be led to see that the publication of modified regulations is urgently desirable* 5. It results from the above that applications falling under categories (a), (b) and (c) above can and should be pressed as of right* If therefore you hear of any such applications from British Subjects proving unsuccessful, you should inform me, giving full details, in order that I may refer the matter to the Exchange Control Commission* At the same time you should advise all British Subjects who may consult you of their rights under the regulations and of the grounds which it is open to them to adduce in support of their applications* Considerable doubt exists as to the manner in which applications under category (c) should be submitted and I have requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to furnish me with full particulars,, I shall inform you on the receipt of their reply* Meanwhile I can only suggest thatxEprpizKsfciJazxx applicants should give full details of their gross business turnover, with a proper profit and loss account, ajid should forward with their applications such document m,s as may be necessary to support their statements* For the success on the other hand of applications under category d (2) it is necessary to rely on the benevolence of the Commission and, as I have stated, the only applications which would appear to have much hope of success are those emanating from persons or firms engaged in commerce* Such persons or firms should be advised to proceed in the same manner as persons or firms in category (c)&gt; /though10% profit and will certainly not be allowed to remit more* I should be glad to learn fron you if any such applications are rejected; and I should^be glad to learn of any other cases under category (d) which may appear to you to be genuinely deserving. Y/hen I can see any utility in so doing, I will support them with the Commission to the extent of my ability; but you will appreciate that it is physically impossible for His Majesty T s Legation to take up every individual case and I therefore rely on you/ to use your judgement to refer to me only those cases where a really good claim in equity can be made out on behalf of the applicant. I shall naturally require the fullest details in each case and you will appreciate that no case can be taken up here until the applicant has taken all possible steps open to him on his own behalf. 6. I do not desire by these instructions to preclude you from reporting to me, whenever occasion may arise, on the general position as it affects British Subjects in your district. Such reports are indeed most useful and enable me to form a better picture of the situation than would otherwise be possible. But I trust that the present despatch will afford you some guidance as to how to proceed in individual cases; and if there are any points on which you still remain in doubt, I shall be glad if you will communicate with me. The present despatch leaves, of course, unaffected the instructions as regards official re mittances by His Majesty*s Consulates and private remittances by Consular Officers and members of their staff, as laid down in Mr. Butler*s circular despatch No. 23 of the 30th May, 1936.

Your Express Letter No.D*7450-N/36 of the ^rd December. 1 . proposed answer to part (b) of the question is correct,it being understood,however,that the purchase or sale of foreign exchange is only illegal if it conflicts with the provisions of the Exchange Law of March 1st,1936. 2. With regard to part (c) of the question,Article 16 of the Exchange Regulations provides for payments for news papers etc. But the regulations contaira no provision what ever for remittances by foreigners in Iran for the education expenses of their children etc. It is true that paragraphs (b) and (o) of Article 15 provide for the remittance abroad of profits up to ten per cent and of fifty per cent of salaries,but these provisions only apply,in the case of profits,to those rt qui sont en relations directes avec des etablissements publics', and in the case of salaries to those 'qui sont au service des etablisseraents publics”. Unless reference is made to these important qualifications, the proposed answer would,I think,give aa unduly favourable impression of the position. It is true that in paragraph 2 of Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ note No.26890/2727 of the loth September {a copy of which is enclosed in my despatch No.268 of today’s date by this bag) the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seem to imply that the right to transfer ten per cent profits is enjoyed by all ft&gt;reigners engaged in coamerce,whether or not they are 'engaged directly on commercial transactions with public institutions”. But the position is obscure,and no reply has yet been received to a /notenote dated the 3rd October (a copy of which is also enclosed in my despatch under reference) in which His Majesty's Legation attempted to obtain some clearer state ment of the position. 3 . I would therefore venture to suggest that the answer to part (c) of the question might run as follows;- 'Government have no knowledge of the 'official decree' referred to by the Honourable Member. Regulations for the application of the Foreign Exchange Control Law were made by the Iranian Government,and a translation is placed on the table of the house. It will be seen that under Article 13 (b) foreigners 'who have direct commercial rela tions with public institutions' are entitled to remit abroad their profits up to ten per cent on any transaction,and that under article i5{c) foreigners 'who are in the service of public institutions' are entitled to remit abroad fifty per cent of their salaries. The exact meaning of the term 'public institutions' is uncertain. His Majesty's Legation at Tehran have made enquiries on this point and have also enquired how applications for permission to remit profits should be submitted; and a reply from the Iranian Government is now awaited. With regard to the importation of news papers and periodicals,provision is made for the purchase of a li lited amount of foreign exchange for this purpose under Article 16 of the Regulations. Ko express provision is made in the regulations for any remittances for childrens' educational expenses etc.,but the final clause of Article 15 allows the Exchange Control Commission full discretion in regard to the grant or rejection of applications for such purposes. 4 . Lith regard to part (d) of the question,the position would appear to be that considerable difficulty and delay is being experienced by most private traders,whether L ranian or /foreign- 3 - o - foreign,in obtaining foreign exchange for commercial purposes; that the Foreign Exchange Commission has in most cases granted exchange for the remittance of fifty per cent of the salaries of foreigners directly or indirectly employed by the Iranian Governraent; but that hitherto no case has come to the knowledge of His Majesty 1 legation in which the Commission have used the discretion ary power granted to them by the last sentence of Article 1j of the regulations to uccept in full applications in cases for which specific provision is not made. In view of the great difficulty.however,in giving a precise answer to this question,! suggest that it should be rather generally worded on lines such as the following; ’’jtfumerous aoplicaticns have,of course,been granted but in others difficulties and delays have been experienced. His Majesty’s Legation are naturally giving their full support to the interests of all British Subjects^. 5. No detailed information is available in His Majesty’s Legation with regard to the position in connection with che remittances of Indians in Iran,but there is no doubt of the fact that a large number of Indians in Iran have had great difficulty in making their usual remittances for family expenses,life insurance premiums,eto.,and it seems probable that many have been unable to make any remittances at all. The answer might perhaps run; 'While detailed information is not available,it appears that in a large number of cases the position is as stated by the Honourable Member”.No. 94. v'Wian c wptck 9 a.w.i. 8th ffcrch, 193^.

Dear Rendel, I am writing with reference to your letter (E.6311/61/34) of 3rd December to the legation at Tehran regarding the question of providing foreign exchange for certain British subjects in Iran from official sources. 2. I can see no immediate way of helping British subjects in Iran who are either employed there and wish to remit funds abroad for the support of their families or who wish to leave Iran and take their capital with them except that of taking up each case with the Exchange Control Commission and the Ministry of foreign Affairs. /presumably the Legation are taking full advantage of Article 15fc) of the Regulations governing the application of the exchange Control Law which provides for the issuing of exchange permits for the payment of one-half of the salaries of the employees of public institutions in Iran^y 3. In considering the question of exchanging the Legation's sterling funds into rials for the benefit of these two groups of British subjects, I presume that regard will be had to Article 7 of the Exchange Control Law which provides Rendel, i^sq., C .M. 0. Foreign Office, S.W.l.that ’’all persons who, alter the promulgation of the Law,((3) obtain foreign exchange otherwise than from the exportation oi merchandise are required to sell it to an authorised Bank three days after they have received it”. presumably sterling obtained from the Legation would have to be surrendered to the exchange Control Commission, or has the Legation made special arrangements on this head? 4. As regards the question of making some arrangement with the Iranians in the course of commercial negotiations, it is difficult to envisage a payments Agreement for regu lating commercial relations, that could provide for the requirements of traders who wish to close down their businesses and transfer their assets abroad. It is, moreover, largely a question for the irovernment of India who seem prepared to take fairly strong measures since they have already suggested that the Iranian govern ment might be given a hint, through H.LI. Minister at Tehran, ’’that the Coveminent of India are not prepared to see the elimination of British Indian subjects from the mutual trade of the two countries and at the same time to continue to Iranian subjects and Iranian goods the privileges which they now enjoy in India”. 5. On the other hand we cannot be content to make an arrangement whereby invisible payments to the United Kingdom from Iran, such as the transmission of Insurance premiums,oould only be met if the Legation have the necessary (§) sterling available. Apart from the objections that the Legation themselves have mentioned (extra v«ork for their staff and the danger that the exchange Control Commission might expect them to satisfy all applications from British subjects for sterling for non-comaercial purposes), the question of ,T invisibles ,! will undoubtedly have to be dealt \,ith as a whole in the course of commercial negotiations and it would seem preferable to try to persuade the Iranians to give some undertaking as regards invisible payments to the United Kingdom in virtue of the general balance of payments between the two countries, the exchange being allocated through the Exchange Control Commission in the normal v;ay. Any such undertaking would not of course include remittances by British Indians or the capital that traders wished to take out of Iran though there might be arrangements for consultation between the two Governments to deal with exceptional demands for sterling.

Thanking you in anticipation &amp; hope to be excused for encroaching upon your most precious time. We beg to remain, Dear Sir, Yours truly,His Excellency, The Governor General and Viceroy of India, New Delhi Sir, We the British Indian Subjects, at present residing in Abadan and Khorramshahr and engaged in business and private service, most humbly and respectfully venture to approach Your Excellency through the medium of this petition explaining our grievances with a view to finding a redress at Your Excellency's generous hands, trusting confidently that adequate means would be forthcoming to save us from the present precarious sitratioru Most of our community are resident in this country for the past 20 years or so* Many of them are leading merchants some of them private medical practitioners and some are engaged by us from amongst us as employees* And every one of us is honourably earning his living* Iran is pacing rapidly with its advancement towards industries, railway construction and organization, and European civilization, enacting new laws under the most illustrious regime of its present ruler, His Imperial Majesty Reza Shah Pahlavi. We all agree to this that whatever is being done is Being done in his country he for the welfare and the good of his subjects, although it does give a little brusing ill effect on the foreign element who peacefully like to earn their honest bread in his progressing country. One of the recent laws for bidding the priveleges of free foreign exchange, that has been previously enjoyed by all of us in this countr/, has especially affected the foreign national so gravely that it has made all of us highly concerned and has crippled our trade, hence this ybvent of feelings before Your Excellency. We beg to request Your Excellency to do the needful in the matter, relieving us from these uncalled for worries by which are now faced. All legal channels to obtain foreign exchange have been officially closed by law, under which law one has to undergo imprisonment ranging from three months to three years and in addition the imprisonment a fine is also payable, if one isfound in the act of buying and or selling foreign exchange. The law, in question, in nicely worded and reads that facili ties will be afforded to foreigner in the purchase of exchange for the importation of news papers and periodicals, for remit- tance abroad for expenses of children’s education, for remit tance of employees wages and for expenses of the dependents at home. No doubt within the province of this law we ought to have been allowed to the foregoing facilities, but with great regret we have noted in a number of cases that almost every Indian applicant for the foreign exchange has received a very disappointing reply from the Exchange Commission in Teheran* which shows that there is no likelihood of our requests to be granted in this respect. It, therefore, leaves us in a state very pitiable, and it has become so difficult that one cannot find means to send money home to one’s dependants. Where one must need immediate remittance to India or elsewhere to pay for children’s educational fees, home-allotments on account of employees, and premia on insurance policies. Every item is already overdue by several months. It is assumed that Your Excellency is well aware of our families position in India without funds and also the just needs of Your Excellency’s subjects abroad. For want of foreign exchange we have all been placed in a precarious condition. Our trade is suffering greatly . This all needs Your Excellency’s immediate help to pull us out of our present difficulties. We trust, therefore, that something would be done^y Your Excellency, for which we shall remain grateful. Apologizing for the trouble given, and thanking always We beg to remain, Sir, Your Excellency’s most obedient and loyal servants.

INDIANS IN PERSIA. 0 *6 had occasion to ventilate the grievances of Indian settlers in Iraq and now we are under the painful necessity of describing the helpless position of Indian settlers in i'ersia. There is a small colony of British Indian subjects residing at Abadan and Khorramshahr in Persia who are mostly engaged in carrying on trade. Many of them have got their families and dependents in India for whose maintenance they have got to remit funds regularly. The Persian Oovemment under a recent decree have controlled the foreign exchange in such a manner that it has of late been impossible for them to remit funds to tneir dependants in this country. wriiy recently a petition signed by no less than 124 British Indian subjects, residing in Persia, has been sent to H.h. the Viceroy of India, narrating the hard plight of those settlers as a result of exchange restrictions. All legal channels for obtaining foreign exchange have been officially closed by law under which one has to undergo imprisonment ranging from three months to three years, and in addition a fine is also payable if one is found in the act of buying or selling foreign exchange. Although it has been distinctly mentioned in the official decree that 'facilites will be afforded to foreigners in the purchase of exchange for the importation of newspapers and periodicals, for remittance abroad, for expenses of children's education, for remittance of employees' wages and for the expenses of dependants at home, ’ it is a matter of great regret to learn that the Commissioner of Exchange does not grant the necessary facili ties for obtaining exchanges even for the aforesaid objects. In reply to an application praying for the necessary permit for the purchase of rupees to remit to India for themaintenance of the family of an Indian settler, the Commissioner of Exchange replied that the applicant must state the reason of his family’s staying abroad. Evidently the licence for the purchase of rupee exhange was not granted to him on this frivolus pretext. In another case the licence to remit funds for the payment of the salary of an employee was not given. It has been pathetically mentioned in the petition, 'There is no likelihood of our requests being granted in this respect. It, therefore, leaves us in a state very pitiable, and it has become so difficult that one cannot find means to send money home to one’s dependants, where one must need immediate remittance to India or elsewhere to pay for children’s educational fees home allotments on account of employees and premia on insurance policies. Every item is already overdue by severa! months. '* Under the regime of its Illustrious ruler, His Majesty Reza Shah Pahlavi, Iran has made rapid progress in all directions. The trade between India and Iran has enormously increased. In the pre-War days the average annual trade was estimated at 120 lakhs of rupees per year. Imports from Iran amounted to Ks. 65 lakhs per year and our exports amounted to Rs. 55 lakhs which left a balance of &amp;.10 lakhs in favour of Iran. In the year 1934-35, our total exports to Iran amounted to only Rs,35 lakhs whereas we imported from that country goods worth Rs.208 lakhs leaving a net balance in favour of Iran amounting to Rs.173 lakhs. It is, therefon evident that Iran derives enormous advantages from her trade relationship with India and as such the Indian settlers in that country deserve a very generous treatment by the G-ovemment of that country. Apart from trade relationship there is an inseparable bond of culture which has kept the people of these two ancient countries united from time immemorial. We/We are really at a loss to understand why such an enlightened ruler as His Majesty Reza Shah Palhavi should be so short-sighted as to place the Indian settlers in his kingdom in such straits• It is a matter of great regre&lt; that Indian settlers are being humiliated in^oreign lands while the people of those countries are thriving at the cost of this country. It only reminds us of our utter helplessnesss as a dependent nation. Could the G-ovemment of Reza Shah Pahlavi, we ask frankly, dare treat the nationals of any other free country, giving them an annual trade balance of 173 lakhs, in this manner? They know well that the foreign policy of India is not guided by the nationals of this country and, consequently, trake undue advantage of the situation. We can do nothing more to help our brethem in distress in Iran than to appeal to H.E. the Viceroy to take early steps for the removal of thdir grievances.No.F.3B6-N/36 # To The Deputy Secretary to the Horemment of Indie in the Foreign and Political Department!

(E 6311/61/34) * British Legation ■GrUlhek No. 5 ft »/ll9/36 GONBIWTIAL 19th Septemher, 1936 My dear Rendel, I enclose a copy of a letter which I an sending hy this hag to Metcalfe, about the question of providing from official sources foreign exchange for British Subjects. It is quite self-explanatory. 2. The quest! on on which we should be most grateful to have your ruling in due course is whether it is proper for the Legation to help British Subjects in this country to obtain foreign exchange by accepting rials from them and giving them in return sterling or rupee drafts cashable outside this country. Such action on our part would clearly be quite contrary to the provisions of the Exchange Law and its most obvious disadvantages are fa) that we should most probably be found out and (b) that there is no knowing where we could fix a limit other than that dictated by the extent of our rial requirements. Thus, while we should be only too glad to assist e.g. British Subjects desirous of leaving the country to liquidate their assests here, there w uld appear to be, to say the least, very serious objections to our doing so. 3. There is perhaps just a chance that the forthcoming commercial negotiations might provide us with an opportunity of reaching some form of agreement with the Iranians on the subject./ T. Kendel Esquire, C.M.Gr., foreign Office, London.* subject. But Simmonds, with Y/hcr I have been discussing the matter, agrees that the Iranians would lost probably refuse to listen to any proposals which we might put up to them and would merely reply that the provisions of the law make it impossible for them to agree to any exchange transactions being carried out except through the authorised banks. All the same we feel that the possibility of suggesting some such agreement to the Iranians is at any rate worth considering. Ordinary commercial debts, which will presumably be covered by any clearing agreement, would probably have to be excluded; but we might perhaps suggest that British Subjects desirous of leaving the country or of making remittances abroad for non-commercial purposes fe.g. for the support of their families, the payment of life insurance premiums, etc) should be allowed to transfer their rials to the legation or Consulates in return for which we would provide them with sterling or rupees outside this country. Vfe might further undertake to furnish the Iranian Government at regular intervals with full details of all such transactions. 4. I am afraid that until we know your views we do nut feel able to make any more concrete suggestion; and even the above idea has obvious disadvantages. For one thing it would involve us in a lot of extra work; for another the Exchange Commission, who are stingy enough as it is, would probably cease altogether to issue permits except for purely commercial purposes and would claim that all requirements must be met through us. 5. We feel that, exchange restrictions being the rule rather than the exception in the world to-day, you must have ample/■» ample precedents in this matter; and we shall not he at all surprised to hear that you would regard it as improper for ^ us to have any dealings in exchange, except through the authorised hanks. But, whatever your answer, we should he ver glad to have some definite ruling for our future guidance. 6. In this matter we are, of course, far more concerned with Indians than with Englishmen, the latter for the most part being employed on a fixed salary of which they get a proportion paid to them in England. Indian merchants, lorry drivers etc., are generally speaking in a much more difficult position and at the moment are getting practically no change at all out of the commission. 7. This being so, I have suggested to Metcalfe that he should let the India Office have his views in the matter for communication to you. I hope you will excuse our having written to them direct on a matter of principle that can presumably only he decided in London; hut the situation of many of the Indians here is becoming so critical that we felt that the great thing was to avoid delay. 8. All this comes from me because Mevile is away; but I discussed the general lines of this letter with him before he left ana he agreed that I should write to you as above. Yours ever, (Sgd.) Peter Loxley. P.S• Simmonds, who has seen this draft, suggests that, if we reach some agreement with the Iranians, we should presumably have to accept rials at the official rate; but that if we go ahead without telling the Iranians, it is worth considering whether we should not charge some fee in the form of a premium. The black bourse rate is incidentally in the region of Hials 100 to the pound. (Intlld.) P.N.L.COPY British Legation, Ho.394/118/36 COHi’IDi^TlAL Copies to:- Mr.Rendel 19th September, 1936. ■GrULHhK. Colonel Laly Lear Sir Aubrey, Laly, when he was here last week, spoke to us about a certain Berber! British subject, by name Bahmadullah, who retired from the Army (I suppose his regiment was the Hazara Pioneers) with the rank of Subadar Major, and came a few years ago to live in Meshed. 2. Last year at the time of the Meshed riots, he was /uO one Berberi officers whom the Iranians suspected of harbouring the notorious Sheikh Bahlul, and for some while he had consequently to suffer the attentions of the police. Afterwards he was allowed to live in peace for a time but Laly says that he is now being spied upon again in various ways by the police, probably because local rumour has it that the Shah is going to visit Meshed in October. Anyway the wretched fellow is now thoroughly fed up and wants to return to India; and as he fears (and Laly agrees) that, if he does not go of his own free will, he is likely one day to be deported by the Police as an undesirable, he is anxious to go while the going is good. 3. The difficulty that arises is, of course, that of getting his money out. Apparently quite a good sized sum is involved as he has property in Meshed. We might be able in time to get a permit for him from the Exchange Control Commission to remit all his assets to India; but there is no certainty that we shall succeed and at best there are likely Sir Herbert A.F. Metcalfe K.C.I.E., C.S.I., M.V.O., to/ Simla.to be considerable delays. ^ 4. V/hat Daly v/as wondering was whether in this special case it would be possible for him to take over all this man* s rial assets and to send a supply bill for the rupee equivalent to some authority in India to be paid over to him on arrival there. The transaction would not of course, be a private one between Daly and the fellow concerned but would figure in the official accounts of the Consulate-General. 5. The arguments in favour of this suggestion are that the man had a distinguished career in India and is now the victim of quite unwarranted police suspicion and, if we do nothing to help him, is likely to be placed in a difficult financial position. 6. On the otner hand his position, unfortunate though it is, is nut fundamentally different from that of a number of other more or less worthy British subjec-ts who have had enough of this country and want to leave; and if we once agree to a transaction of this sort, I don T t know where we shall ever be able to draw the line. 7. A further point is that the transaction would clearly be contrary to the provisions of the Exchange Contio 1 Lav/, which lays down that dealings in foreign exchange may only be carried out through one of the authorised banks. Moreover by accepting rials here and paying for them in sterling or rupees outside this country, we should clearly be cheating the Exchange Control Commission of that amount of foreign exchange. 8. There is also the possibility that we should be founc! out by the Iranians. If this man and others leave the country without making any attempt through the proper channels to be allowed to take their money with them, the authorities may/nay well make enquiries and at any rate come to suspect us, even if they have no proof. There might he means of getting round this by only agreeing to accept part of a man*s rials and by making him apply to the Commission for a permit to remit the rest, in the hope that the latter might not realise that the proportion covered by'the application for a permit was only a proportion and not the entirety of a ma^s assets. But it would seem a risky business all the same and there is, of course, the further risk that this or some other j-avoured person might tell his friends, who would tell their friends, till finally the Iranians got to hear of it. 9. A much safer plan in our view would seem to be to try to make some arrangement with the Iranians, possibly in connection with the forthcoming commercial negotiations, by which they would agree to let us purchase rials for our official requirements from British subjects in return for rupees or sterling payable in the United Kingdom or India. if they consented, we could go ahead openly and the arrangement would probably benefit a number of people. But I fear all the same that they would not agree, as they would want to retain the power to dispose of the foreign money themselves. They would most prooably merely say that such transactions were contrary to the exchange lav/. 10. We are now writing to the foreign Office to ask for their views on the general question of the propriety or otherwise of using official funds to help British subjects and firms to acquire foreign exchange. I think there are now something like twenty-eight countries with exchange restrictions, so His Majesty’s government must have jtenty of precedents/, . I * •precedents. They may he opposed to the whole business, in which case we should have to stick to our present practice of only cashing through the banks, but on the other hand they may see ways and means by which we couxd help british subjects to the limit of our official requirements. 11. Until, however, a decision is reached on the question of principle, we feel here that it is only likely to land us in trouble to start helping individual cases in the manner suggested by Daly. I see from your telegram N0.771-A of September 8th to Sushire that your present ruling is that TT supply bills should on no account be sold to any but 'Government servants'; so I imagine that you probably agree with us. 12. As for procedure, it seems to us that the best plan would perhaps be if you could let the India Office have your views on the general question so that they could then go into it all with the foreign Office, and, as regards the particular case of the Subador llajor, perhaps you could send Daly instructions by telegram. I think he wants to leave pretty soon. 13. I should have said earlier that this letter is being written by me because Butler is away on a visit to Isfahan. But I discussed the whole question with him before he left and he agreed that I should write to you as above. 14. I am sending copies of this letter to Mr. Hendel and Colonel Daly.

OVER a hundred Indian residents of Persia have petitioned the Viceroy about their hardships due to lack of exchange facilities for them in Persia. It would appear that they were in the enjoyment of such facilities but that a law forbidding the privilege of free foreign exchange has recently been enacted in Persia. This law prescribes heavy penalties in the case of those found buying or selling foreign exchange but affords protection to foreign residents in the pur chase of exchange for remittances to their homelands for the payment of subscriptions to newspapers, for the maintenance of their dependents and employees, etc. If so, it may be asked what is the grievance of our countrymen ? ■* So far as can be understood from their petition, their complaint seems to be that the protection given to them by the law fails to materialise in actual practice. This view is borne out by the replies sent by the Commissioner of Exchange to two Indian appli- | cants for the rupee exchange which are appended to the petition. In one case the applicant was asked to enlighten the Commissioner with the reasons why the applicant chose to separate himself from his family and in the other case the request was pointblank refused without assigning any reasons, sound or ? unsound. This is how the statutory protection .. guaranteed to our countrymen in Persia turns out to be quite illusory in practice. THE resulting hardships may be easily imagined by the reader. The withdrawal of these necessary ex change facilities, in addition to inconveniencing those wishing to make remittances to India, leaves their dependents here without the wherewithal to carry on their existence. -CcCopy (E 6864/61/34) No,459 ( 580/7/uC* 12 October, 1936. Sir, J ' . /&gt; , r % r o ~~y ~y i b955 : !9'36 j I have the honour to inform you that it had come to my notice that there appeared to be no uniformity of practice among frontier customs officials in this country in applying the exchange regulations to travellers entering and leaving Iran. I therefore thought it well to obtain from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs a complete statement of the regulations affecting travellers. The information furnished is set out in the note, a copy of which I have the honour to transmit herewith. 2. It will be seen that the Regulations are reasonable enough and follow closely the lines of those in force in other countries. If they are properly observed by all customs houses, no difficulties should arise. I saw my- selj. recently that they are in fact carefully followed at Pahlevi, wliere the traveller on arrival is given a printed declara tion form clearly worded in French on which he declares his foreign exchange. But it appears that there are many Customs Houses where either no declaration is yet required at all, or if made, it is not entered in the passport of the traveller. His Majesty's Consul-General for Khorassan has reported to me the case of an Indian traveller of good position who entered Iran at Julfa with a letter of credit for a large sum, and about £.70 sterling in cash, which he It was not entered in his passport, and when he was/ declared. The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc. , etc. , etc. , The Foreign Office.was leaving Iran at Kariz on the Afghanistan frontier, the whole sum was seized and he was detained for a considerable time, suffering great inconvenience and was only finally released on paying a fine of £.40 to the Customs. I am taking this case up with the Iranian Government. N 0 other case of the kind has come to my notice, but it is clearly very important that travellers as well as the customs officials, should be familiar with the regulations, and I should therefore be very grateful if such steps may be taken as may be possible to bring the information contained in the enclosure to this despatch to the notice of travellers proceeding to Iran. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Depart ment of Overseas Trade (unnumbered , to the Foreign Secre tary to the Government of India N 0 .232 and to all His Majesty's Consular Officers in Iran, Circular Despatch No. 38. I have, etc., (Signed, Nevile Butler.NOTE ON EXCHANGE REGULATIONS FOR TRAVELLERS. 1 . The export and import of Iranian currency is prohibited, but travellers entering or leaving Iran may carry with them in Iranian currency a sum not exceeding Rials 200. 2. On entering Iran a traveller must declare in writing at the frontier customs house all foreign exchange in his possession, whether in coins, notes, cheques, travellers cheques, letters of credit, shares or any other form. If no foreign exchange is carried, this must be stated in writing. The information given by the traveller will be entered in his passport. 3. A traveller who wishes to obtain Rials should sell his foreign exchange or such part of it as may be necessary to one of the two banks authorised to deal in foreign exchange, namely the National Bank or Iran and the Imperial Bank of Iran. The Bank will furnish a certificate that the traveller has sold foreign excnange, and this should be carefully kept and pro~ duced at the frontier when leaving Iran in order that the customs may allow the export of any exchange which the traveller may still have in his possession. 4. If n traveller has bought more rials than he requires in Iran, he may buy exchange on leaving the country. But to do so he must first obtain the permission of the Exchange Commission in Tehran, which it will probably take at least a week to obtain. 5. The permit to buy exchange issued by the Exchange Commission will be valid for twenty days only, and the traveller must leave Iran within one month of making his purchase of ex change. The amount of exchange bought by the traveller and the date of the purchase will be entered in his passport by the bank selling the exchange, which will also give him a certificate of purchase of exchange. 6. A traveller who has bought foreign exchange while in Iran must carry the whole sum with him when leaving the country, and must/must produce at the frontier the certificate of purchase of exchange given to him by the selling bank. This certifi cate will be cancelled by the Customs at the frontier and returned to the traveller. 7. Pending the enactment of further regulations, a traveller may take with him when leaving the country a sum in foreign exchange equal to, but not in excess of the amount of foreign exchange which he brought into Iran.'/ / / British Legation, r? f \ r &gt; QkJ 'i O Tehran, $ l !

The only persons with these intentions about whoa I have any information at present are British Indian traders; but it is not impossible that, In view of zhe existing exchange regulations and the increas ing monopolisation of trade* a number of Kuropean British Subject* in business in a small way may equally decide to sell their assets and leave Iran. At present Indian traders are finding considerable difficulty in liquidating their affairs here* as the Exchange Control Commission are extremely reluctant to sell foreign currency and as the alternative method of exporting Iranian unsatisfactory inasmuch as exporters are obliged to hand over the proceeds of the sale of such exports to the Commission. 3 * 1 therefore thought it well* without entering into the details of Individual cases to address a note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs* a copy of which is enclosed herein, outlining the position in general terms and requesting /sympathetic The Eight Honourable Anthony Eden* M.C.* M.P.* etc.* etc., etc.* The Foreign Office.sympathetic consideration for British India Subjects who wish to liquidate their assets in this country and renit the proceeds to India* I mentioned this in advance in conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs recently and atted for his personal and sympathetic attention to this and other subjects affecting British Indians in East Persia, but I am by no means optimistic that a satisfactory reply to the note will be forthcoming* My idea in approaching the Iranian Government is rather to test their attitude on this question and to endeavour to extract from them some statement of policy. At present it is extremely difficult to fathom the principle on which the Commission are working and therefore well-nigh impossible to give advice to the large number of British Subjects who appeal to His Majesty’s Legation for guidance. 4.

It lollova from this that, before liquidating their assets, they are anxious to know whether and in what fora they will be permitted to remit the proceeds to India. 2. In order to do this, it would be necessary for them either to obtain permits to convert their rial balances into rupees or to be allowed to export Iranian produce to India* The feasibility of this latter method is, however, conditional on their being granted exemption from the obligation to sell to the Kxchange control Gommis* sion the proceeds of the sale of such exports. 3* I do not desire In this note to enter into the details of any in dividual eases) my object is rather to /invite His Excellency Monsieur Knayatollah Goaty Minister for Foreign Affairs.invite the attention of the Imperial .

A $ I have the honour to inform you that considerable difficulties are being experienced by British Subjects and especially British Indian subjects in obtaining permits to remit money abroad for the maintenance of dependents. During the past two months,numerous appeals for assist ance have been received by Kia Majesty’s Consular Officers,but despite such help as it has been possible to give them applicants have,I think invariably.remained unable to obtain foreign exchange for the maintenance of their families abroad. Certificates given tc them by His Majesty’s Consular Officers to the effect that their applications were regarded as reasonable, seem unfortunately to have proved unavailing and applicants have 4 d|her (a) received no reply at all, (b) been told to furbish a certificate to be obtained from the nearest Iranian Consular Officer to the place of residence of the dependents concerned,or (c) been informed that no foreign exchange whatever can be issued for remittance to families abroad (with the possibly exception of limited sums for the payment of the educational expenses of children). 3. In the circumstances I have thought it well to request the assistance of the Iranian Government in the matter,and now have the honour to enclose copy of &amp; note whioh I am addressing to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. fhis note deals solely with the question of the remission abroad of money for the A $ 1 ?he Sight Honourable /payment Anthony Kden M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc.. Th. Foreign Off!.*payment of family expenses,including life insurance policies. I am continuing carefully to watch the situation as regards the provision of foreign exchange for traders,travellers,etcetera hut, though the applications of such persons usually encounter considerable delay, X have not yet obtained enough evidenceto show that general representations on their behalf are desirable. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India iio.122 and copies of the enclosure to all His Majesty’s Consular Officers in Iran. I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) nevlle Eutlerr . * \ , i ^ British Legation, Tehran, 16th Meor, 19S6, ninjas ( 394/84/36) Monsieur le Minietrv. I have the honour to inform Your Kxcellency that my attention has he on drawn to the difficult lee which are being experienced by British subjects resident in Iran, and par- ticulorly to British Ipdian subjecte, in obtaining foreign exchange required by taem for the maintenance of dep endents abroad* that many British subjects resident in Iran hove children who are being educated in the United Kingdom and India and elsewhere, while others arc obliged to make regular remittancee abroad fear the support of other mem bers of their families, for the pay ment of life Insurance premiums and for si ill or family experts €©• The British subjects concerned hare in many oases obtained from British Con sular officers certificates that the sums for which application was made were reasonable and were in fact /requirea His Kxcellency Monsieur Inayatollah s amiy, Minister for Foreign Affaire*2 i$V reguired for family purpose b # I under stand however, that in none of the cases which have been hr ought to my notice has the application for exchange heen grahted. In some Ci^ses no reply has heen received from the Kxchange Control Commission. In others British Indian Subjects have received the reply that a certificate must he obtained from an Iranian consular authority in India, while in one case the applicant has heen informed that there is no provision under the foreign exchange law for the purchase of ex change to provide for the support of dependents abroad and that in conse quence his application is refused. 3. I am confident that the Imperial Government have no desire to impose on British Subjects resid nt in Iran the hardships which must inevitably result ifthey are unable to obtain the exchange required for* the mainterance of their dependents abroad. The ments required are in all cases small and I cannot but believe that they are balanced by similar remittances to Iran from the numerous Iranian subjects established in India. I am satisfied that in the cases which have been brought to my notice the sums for which application has been made are reasonable and such as would normally be required Ayby the applicants. In view of the great distances involved in India, it is in the great majority of cases exceedingly difficult or even impossible for the applicants to obtain certificates from Iranian Consular officers in that country. But I need not assure Your Excellency that His Majesty* s Consular Officers in Iran will in all cases exercise the greatest care before furnishing certifi cates that the sums applied for are reasonable and are in fact required for the support of dependents, I earnestly trust therefore that the Imperial Government will be able to cause instruc tions to be given to the Exchange Commi ssion to issue permits for the purchase of exchange required for the maintenance of dependents abroad on the production of a certificate from one of His Majesty’s Consular Officers in Iran, 1 would add that the attention of all British subjects who apply to His Majesty’s Legation for assistance in obtaining exchange for remittances to their families abroad is being drawn to the notice 11 o, 156o4 of the Exchange Commission dated 9th May (19th Ordibe- hesht, 1315) stating that full informa tion regarding foreign subjects employed by any institution should be furnished to the Commission before the 5th June (15th Khordad, 1315), next.6 . I should be very grateful if Your Excellency would be so good as to infora me as soon as possible whether the Imperial Government have been able to issue instructions in the sense indicated in the preceeding paragraph* I avail myself of this opport^xnity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration* (■: ig»ed/ &amp; t- vi It: But. ler *</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00003b_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3500</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00003b</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3500</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 28/94 ‘Iran.
