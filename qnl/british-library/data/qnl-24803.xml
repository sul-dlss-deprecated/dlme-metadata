It will be seen from this paper that the Russian Government are unwilling to accept the proposal of Hxs Majesty's Government that each Power should withdraw all its employes from the line controlled by the other and put forward instead the suggestion, apparently based on technical grounds, that each should withdraw all its mechanicians and inspectors but that Great Britain The Under Secretary India Office. of State,Britain should retain her signallers at Tehran and Meshed and Russia hers at Birjand and Nasratabad. Though Sir E.Grey would have preferred to see the question settled in accordance with the proposal of His Majesty's Government there appears to him to be little likelihood that the Russian Government could now be induced to withdraw their objections to it,and he is accordingly disposed to agree to the solution of the difficulty on the lines of the compromise now suggested which approximates to the arrangement pre ferred by His Majesty's Charg5 d'Affaires at Tehran, Consul-General at Meshed and Consul in Geistan and, originally, by the Government of India also. It is further to be observed that the Russian Government have now appointed a Military Attach^ to their Consulate in Seistan whose presence, in which His Majesty’s Government are obliged to acquiesce, so much more objectionable to them than that of the Russian signallers as to render the retention of these last a comparatively trivial matter. Io I am to request that, should Viscount Morley con cur in the view above expressed, he will cause to be prepared and forv/arded to this Office a draft ar rangement to give effect to the exchange on the lines now proposed, which would be transmitted to Sir A.Nicolson for discussion with the Bussian Govern ment in accordance with the suggestion contained in the penultimate paragraph of His Excellency's des patch. With reference to the last paragraph of that despatch, I am to state that Sir E.Grey has addressed a telegram to His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires at Teh ran enquiring what progress has been made in obtain ing the consent of the Persian Government to the prin- ciple of the exchange.

Mr. Marlinq to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received June O.) /&gt; ^ (No. 118.) ; l\]o'&gt;3/o« Sir, Tehran, May 20, 1908. IN accordance with the authorization conveyed to me in your telegram No?78 of the 11th ultimo, I consulted the Russian Minister on the question of broaching to the Persian Government the proposed exchange of the respective control of the British and Russian Telegraph Departments on the Tehran-Meshed and Khaf-Nasratabad telegraph lines, and after some deliberation it was agreed that we should request Mr. Barker and General Heisler to inform the Persian Telegraph Administration of the proposal. After consultation between these gentlemen, the matter was accordingly broached to the Persian Telegraph Administration by the latter verbally, and by Mr. Barker in a letter dated the 30th April, the draft of which I had previously shown to M. de Hartwig. A day or two later M. de Hartwig told me that he had hopes that the matter would go through without difficulty, as when the Sartip (General Heisler) had mentioned it to his Persian colleague no objections had been raised. I said that Mr. Barker, whose long experience with the Persian Telegraph Administration should give his opinion considerable weight, had also been sanguine of success, but for myself I was not so confident, as I feared the inveterate suspicion of the Persians of anything like joint action by the two Legations, and I doubted whether the Persian Telegraph Administration would take the responsibility of acquiescing in the exchange without the sanction of the Ministers. In any case, the rdle for us to assume was one of complete disinterestedness, leaving the whole matter to the two Telegraph Super intendents. The same afternoon Mr. Barker received a reply, dated the 2nd May, from Assadullah Mirza stating that the matter was one of too great importance for his decision, and that it should he treated by the two Legations with the Minister for Poreign Affairs. The Ministerial crisis which occurred at this moment made any further action impossible, but on the reconstruction of the Cabinet it was agreed upon between M. de Hartwig and myself that we should mention the matter verbally to Mushir-ed- Dowleh at an early opportunity. The appearance of a somewhat violent article in the Medjliss newspaper on the 18th instant representing Great Britain and Russia as treating Persia with scant ceremony in arranging such a question without first consulting her, furnished me with a pretext for bringing up the question, and when I saw Mushir-ed-Dowleh the following day I asked him why so much animosity should he displayed against a perfectly innocent proposal, and one which certainly could not possibly do Persia any harm. His Excellency said he had not seen the article, nor had he yet heard of the proposal that Russia and Great Britain should exchange the obligations they had assumed in respect of the telegraph lines, but the tone of it was of course the expression of the popular belief that the Anglo-Russian Agreement was only the first step towards the partition of the country. I said that I hoped his Excellency would do what he could to dispel these absurd notions, and represent the present suggestion in its true light. The Indo-European Telegraph Department had for the past few years taken on itself the maintenance of the Tehran-Meshed line at a cost considerably in excess of the Persian contribution, and now that they proposed to make a change which, while throwing no additional burden on the Persian Telegraph Administration, was one of considerable convenience to themselves, they were being accused of discourtesy, if not of far worse motives. What could it matter to the Persian Government whether the small staff required to keep the line in order was composed of English or Russians ? I hoped his Excellency would see that the matter was arranged between the Telegraph Administrations concerned, and save himself and me from a wearisome discussion over a matter which neither of us was so competent to deal with as the experts. His Excellency, whose conversation betrayed that in spite of his denial he had previous knowledge of Mr. Barker’s letter, said he would look into the matter and tell me his views when I next saw him.

I have the honour to request a refer ence to the telegrams marked in the margin on the subject of the proposal that the Seistan line should be handed over to the Indo-European Telegraph Department.As it seems that one at least of the statements made in my telegram cited was incorrect, and that the general conclusion drawn was also erroneous, I would beg to be allowed to submit the following explanation:— ( 1 ) The refusal of the Indo-European Telegraph Department to accept tele grams on political matters from Persians is, it seems, based on reasons connected with our general interests in Persia. My idea that our interests suffered to some extent was, I must admit, founded on purely local considerations. Here, the Russians are freely resorted to by Persians wishing to send telegrams whose con tents they do not wish divulged, and if the Russians retain signallers on the line, there will be, so far as I am aware, nothing to prevent their continuing to send Persian messages as they do now. Our signallers are debarred from accepting such messages and the fact undoubtedly loses us a certain amount of local influence. ( 2 ) As regards the use of chits, the following circular telegram was issued by Mr. Tanner, Assistant Superintendent of the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment, on 8 th July 1907, to all stations on the Seistan line :— “ Please note and communicate to all whom it may concern that Meshed end of the Seistan line being at present subject to the rules of the Indo- European Telegraph Department, chits are inadmissible unless signed by the senior Telegraph Officer of the originating station and addressed the care of the Senior Officer at the terminating station. This will be strictly enforced in future. No chit can be accepted on public or official matters.” It seemed to me that, looking at the matter with a view to our own inter ests, a system which allowed chits was preferable to one that did not. The instance I specially had in mind was that of communications between Seistan and Birjand. At present I receive daily reports of all events by chit. When the line is made over to the Indo-European Telegraph Department, either the Consul at Seistan will lose a valuable means of knowing all that occurs from day to day in Birjand, or telegraph expenses will be very largely increased. In the circumstances of the line being handed over for our use daily during a fixed num ber of hours, and of the signallers employed during these hours being paid by. us, it did not appear to me that the use of the chit system for messages which were not required to remain on record was incompatible with honesty towards the Persian Administration. The argument seemed to me to apply a fortiori in the case of lines partly maintained by ourselves. ( 3 ) As regards the question of telegrams being handed over to the Persian Telegraph Administration, I much regret that I should have been led into making an incorrect statement. I would say in explanation that while I was officiating for His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed in 1906,1 was informed by an officer of the Indo-European Telegraph Department that all telegrams that passed through their hands were at the close of each month handed over to the Persians at Tehran. Pro. Nos. 56 and 59 in General A. (Con- As far as my recollection goes, I stated fidential), Nos. 54—63 of 1907. this as a fact in a letter sent from Meshed in reply to the Government of India’s letter on the subject of cipher telegram, No. 2543-E., dated 9 th August 1906. In this, however, I may be mistaken. 2. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India, Foreign Department, and His Majesty’s Consul-General, Meshed.

I would mention following disadvantages due to control by Indo-European Telegraphs of Meshed-Tehran line. (1) Telegrams from Persians are not accepted. (2) Communication by log messages between Consular Officers is useless. ( 3 ) Originals of all telegrams handed in are made over to Persian Tele- graph Administration.

In further continuation of my letter No. 31-C., of the 19th March 1908, re the Meshed-Seistan line, I recently received a telegram, No. 6 of the 28th March, irom His Majesty’s Charue d’Affairesat Tehran who had been asked from the Foieign Office, London, whether the information given by the Persian Dilector of Tele graphs as to the division of expenses was correct. Of this I attach a copy. 2 As the question is one of considerable importance, I asked the Director for further d tails and he informed me that when the line was completed, there were five thousand poles, one hundred and ten coils of wire, and five thousand insulators over, which were kept by Kniaz and have since been utilized by him for rep ah s. All labour, amounting on an average to twelve hundred tomans^ annum, has been paid by the Russians, as also the wages of the ghulams, viz., 2,400 tomans, annually. 3 . Jalil Mirza states that he pointed out to the Sipahdar that, whereas the Russians formerly paid in about 201 tomans 'per mensem for messages, they now only paid in about one-quarter of that sum. In reply, he was informed that the Russians were allowed conti ol cf the line as a set-ofi to the Rritisn management of the Tehran-Meshed line : and that he must not raise any diffi culties. 4 . In conclusion, Sir, I am convinced that, so far as Jalil Mirza is concerned, the information in this and my previous letter is quite reliable. It is, how- ver, possible, but hardly probable, that the Russians adjust accounts secretly at Tehran with the Sipahdar. If so, it would be somewhat of a new departure. 5 .

[15995] tiqu [May 11.] Section 13. Le#/\y fe^uT^ 5 oi Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 11.) (No. 98.) Sir, Tehran, April 23, 1908. SINCE the receipt of your telegram No. 78 of the 11 th instant I have been in constant communication with the Russian Minister as to the steps to be taken to broach the question of our control over the Meshed-Tehran and Khaf-Nasratahad telegraph lines to the Persian Government, and we are agreed that the least friction will he caused by leaving the matter entirely in the hands of the Superintendents of the two Telegraph Administrations, and confining ourselves to simply mentioning the arrangement to the Minister for Foreign Affairs as one in which the Legations take a very secondary, and certainly no political, interest. Mr. Barker is disposed to think that by taking this line there is quite a reasonable chance that the Persian Telegraph Administration will see the matter in the way which we wish, and will raise no difficulty over it. M. de Hartwig and I are not so hopeful, but we are both agreed that the more aloof the Legations remain from the question the better chance there is that we shall avoid arousing serious opposition to the exchange. Mr. Barker and General Heisler are about to consult as to the nature ot the communications they will address to the Persian Telegraph Administrator. As regards the question whether the Rhaf—Seistan section he placed ultimately under the control of the Indo-European Telegraph Department or the Indian Telegraph Department, I notice that His Majesty’s Consul at Seistan, who appears to have been consulted by the Government of India, is strongly in favour of the latter course, on the around that the Indo-European Telegraph Department is tied down in many respects hv its agreements with the Persian Government. I cannot say whence Manor Kennion gets this impression, which, so far as I can learn from Mr. Barker, is an entirely erroneous one. It is quite true that the Indo-European Iclegraph Department does not accept messages in the Persian language unless they are written in Roman characters, and that they refuse all messages of a political nature; this is not however in consequence of any arrangement with the Persian Government, but merelv as a precaution to prevent the Department’s employes getting entangled in political squabbles which do not concern them, and also in pursuance of our general nolicv to avoid all appearance of interference m internal affairs. Two other points that he has raised are that “log” messages, i.e., private messages sent gratis as a matter of favour, are not allowed by the Indo-European Telegra,ph Department, and that originals of all telegrams are handed over to the Persian Administration. The second of these points, Mr. Barker informs me, is quite inaccurate, and as to the former, he assures me that such reasonable facilities for “log” messages are given as are consistent with common honesty towards the Persian Administration. His Maiesty’s Consul-General at Meshed takes precisely the contrary view, m which I entirely concur, viz., that the control should be vested m the Indo-European Telegraph Department. He points out, with truth as it seems to me, that, if e cnntroT P is taken over by the Indian Administration, considerable suspicion may be aroused Loa the Persians who are accustomed to deal with the Indo-European mi &gt;1 'npnHvtmpnt and have ffreat confidence in it. Io this I would add that it Telegraph ^®P alt ™ , ’ ., ? f us t0 obtain the Robat extension if the Persian Grlvemment know that it will pass under the control of the Indian Administration.

[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] correspondence respecting the Birjand telegraph office, I have the honour to quote the following extract from Major Kennion’s weekly summary from the 8 th to the 14th March which has now reached this Legation:— *« The Russian doctor asked the Telegraph Sertip at Birjand for a separate room and for certain improvements for this room. A proposal was also, it seems, put forward that the line should he taken first to the Russian room, as at Seistan. The request was transmitted by the Telegraph Sertip to Meshed, with the result that he received orders not to allow the line to be taken through the Russian room, hut sanctioning 20 tomans on account of repairs presumably for the new room. So far the * tape instrument ’ has not arrived, and no attempt has been made to put a separate room for the Russians in order.” In his next weekly summary Major Kennion writes:— “The Telegraph Sertip at Birjand has sent a telegram to Serdar Mansur, in which he states that the room wanted for the Russian telegraphist, for the repairs of which 20 tomans had been sanctioned, was a different room from that used by the Persian signaller. He goes on to explain that the owner of the house, the lease of which had expired, now washes to raise the rent from 2 tomans to 5 tomans per mensem. The Sertip asked sanction to rent the building for 3 tomans per mensem and to carry out the repairs after the lease had been signed. . r . “ It may he noted that all the telegraph offices on the Seistan-Khaf line are rented from private individuals, except those at Seistan, Bandan, and Shusp. The incident is now considered as closed, but I quote the above extracts as, although I do not doubt the good faith of the Russian Minister, he may have been misinformed by his Consul, who, being ignorant of the proposed exchange, may well have wished to gain credit for zeal.

His Excellency wishes, at the same time, that a copy of the Telegraph Convention of 1872, so that he may see what rights and obligations would he attached to the transfer. The 1872 Convention deals chiefly with the Tehran-Bushire line, and Article XVI mentions that it would equally apply to the Khanikin section, should the British Director wish to resume charge over that latter line. I doubt if the above Convention would give all the information desired by M. Isvolsky, as Article XVI states that a tariff would have to he arranged for the Khanikin section, should it re-enter under British Administration ; and I think that he would wish to be informed of the date on which the line was handed over to the Persian Government, and the reasons for this transference. I am unaware how the Persian Government would view the transfer on our part to Russia of rights which had been suspended for over thirty years, and it would, perhaps, have been more convenient if the Khanikin question had been treated separately from the exchange of the other two lines. At the same time L think that the Russian Government would wish to see the matter settled as soon as possible, as they are no doubt at present nervous as to Germany acquiring some right of pre-emption after the termination of the Concession in 1925. Moreover, Russia^ has agreed to offer no opposition to the prolongation of the other Telegraph Concessions, on the understanding that the transference to them of our above-mentioned rights should he effected, so that it would not he desirable to afford them any grounds for supposing that, so far as we were concerned, we wished any delay to arise m carrying out the arrangement. # .

He would accord ingly propose, if Mr. Morley concurs in this view,to reply in that sense, to Mr. Marling*s enquiry. I am further to state that, in Sir E.Grey’s opin ion, the terms of the memorandum communicated hy His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg to the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs on June 23rd last make it abundantly clear that His Majesty’s Government sur render their rights over the Tehran-Khanikin line in consideration of a promise on the part of the Russian Government that they will not oppose the prolongation of the British concessions for the telegraph lines from Jask to Bushire and from Jask to Gwaddur and of i the Central Persian telegraph line to Eobat. It is for His Majesty's Government to judge of the moment at which it would be opportune to apply to the Persian Government for the prolongation of these concessions and they can hardly insist on the grant of this pro longationprolongation being simultaneous with the transfer to Russia of their rights over the Tehran-Khanikin line. All, therefore, that remains to he done at present is for the Russian Government to obtain from that of Persia their recognition of the transfer of those rights. Sir E.Grey proposes, subject to Mr. Morley's concurrence to telegraph to Mr. Marling in this sense. As regards Sir A. Nicolson’s telegram, I am to enquire Mr. Morley's opinion of the desirability of making to the Persian Government an explanation in the sense proposed by Monsieur Izvolski^and I am to ask whether he sees any objection to Sir A. Nicolson's ma king to His Excellency the communication which he sug gests. Should Mr. Morley see none,I am to request that Sir E.Grey may be supplied with copies of the two Conventions referred to for communication to Mon sieur Izvolski. Sir E.Grey agrees with Sir A.Nicolson in consi dering that it would be more convenient to deal with the question of the exchange of the Meshed-Seistan and2 The latest information I have received on this subject is that orders have been received from Tehran not to allow the line wire to go first to the Russian’s room. (c) At Khaf, it will be necessary to arrange for a Telegraph building and quarters for the signaller. The requisite instruments, in . order to carry out tbe proposal of separate offices and com- \ mutators, will also have to be sent. This point will be further touched on in connection with line staff. (d) Although Mr. Howson’s note shows that the line is ill constructed, it would not seem necessary to undertake its reconstruction immediately. This could be done gradually, and the batteries, insulators and other fittings could be replaced as they become worn out. An immediate inspection of the line with the view of making estimates for the future and the submission of indents would be advisable. (e) The introduction of telephones on the line, which has been suggested by Mr. Howson, would seem advisable on all grounds. (/) The only addition to the Btitish Staff on the line which now stands as shown in the mar- 2 Sub Assistant Superintendents. gin, would be a signaller 1 si g Dalier * for Khaf. Both Mr. McManus and Mr. Howson, who are the Suh-Assistant Super intendents at Seistan and Birjand, respective!v, have experience of construc tion work and the deputation of a special Inspector from India to look after the line would be superfluous. It would, however, be necessary to give a special allowance to the individual selected for the charge of the line. At present, as Mr. Howson is doing very useful political work in Birjand, it seems that the best and most convenient arrangement would probably be for Mr. McManus to have charge of the line as Inspecting Telegraph Master, with his head quarters in Seistan, whence he would make an annual inspection of the line in the autumn. I should prefer,^however, that a final decision on this point should be left pending a settlement regarding the Birjand Vice-Consulate. As regards Khaf, it may be expected, when the exchange of lines takes place, that the Kniaz Vachadze will be transferred from tins place, and a Russian signaller sent in his place. In any case it would seem advisable that the British signaller sent to Khaf should have some experience of the country and be able to speak the language, so that—as his telegraph work will be small, he may be of use as a news Agent. The post, however, will be an isolated one and should, I think, carry with it a special allowance. In this connection I would point out that it does net seem really necessary for either the Russians or ourselves to have a signaller at Khaf. A mutual agreement, not to keep British or Russian signallers there would not, so far as 1 can see, prejudice our political interests in any way, while there would be a material saving of expense. This, however, is a question on which Major Sykes is better qualified to express an opinion. As pointed out by Mr. Howson, an Indian Sub-Inspector, to take the place of the Russian Mechanic, will be indispensable. The line staff of ghulam bashis and ghulams should be taken over as they stand. Their pay is adequate and their numbers sufficient. As Khaf will be a terminus, as far as our supervision of the line is concerned, it should be theoretically possible to manage with one ghulam at this post instead of two, hut in view of a signaller being posted to this place who would require a peon, I would prefer to waive the question of this trifling reduction. 6 . Since the line will remain the property of the Persain Government it would be convenient that its control and maintenance should be carried out under the general superintendence of His Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Khan ; and in these circumstances, if it is decided to k» ep a signaller at Khaf, he would, 1 presume, be under the same controlling officer. This sugges tion should not be read to imply a recommendation that Khaf, which is at present in the Turbat Consular district, should be included in that of Seistanand Kam. This question would naturally depend on the ultimate decision arrived at regarding the Vice-Consulate at Birjand and Consular arrangements generally m Eastern Persia. 5 7.

R. ILowson, Sub- Assistant Superintendent of Telegraphs, Birjand. Line stores at present in use. Wire — Gauge. In my opinion the gauge is as near as possible to, if not identical with, Indian Telegraph Iron Wire Gauge No. 12, weighing 300 lbs. per mile. The Russian Inspector informed me that the diameter of the line wire was 4 millimetres. This would be identical with Indian Telegraph Wire Gauge No. 14, weighing 350 lbs. to the mile. This point, however, could easily be decided by sending a sample piece of wire to the Telegraph Store Yard, Calcutta. Wire—Faulty construction. In many places I found the line wire, even in summer time, stretched quite taut between the supports. Notwithstanding the short spans at present existing, this must result in a great strain on the wire, particularly during the winter months, when occasionally the temperature goes down in some places to zero.£ it■ Joints. “ Twist ” and not “ Britannia ” joints are in use. Posts — Kinds. These are of Poplar and Pine (vernacular names “ safida ” poplar, and “ naju ” sometimes called “ sarv,” pine). Post — Dimensions. The posts average 20 feet in length and are buried 3 feet in the ground. The average girth at the top is 9 inches and at the base 19 inches. Posts — Where obtainable and rate. Both kinds of posts are obtainable at Khaf at the rate of Krans 20 (Es. 5-14) each and a limited number of poplar posts in the Sunnikhana District at an averege rate of Krans 10 (Es. 2-15) each. Posts — Cost of transport. The cost of transport per post from Khaf to Seistanis urans 80 (Es. 23-8-6), and that of poplar posts from Sunnikhana to Seistan would be about Krans 35 (Es. 10-4-5) each. The posts are carried down and distributed shortly after cutting whereas, if they were allowed to dry where cut, the cost of transport would be much less. The number of poplar posts obtainable in the Sunnikhana district would he sufficient for our yearly requirements for the portion of the line from Sihdeh to Seistan and it will only be necessary to indent on Khat tor the JNorth- ern section. Posts—Number per mile. The Eussians have adopted 16* posts to the verst which works out to 24T5 per mile. The reason for such a high proportion is due to the prevalence of white ants which freely attack the portions of the posts buried. It will be readily under stood that the nearer the posts are to one another, the less likelihood there is, when a post breaks off, of the wire sagging so near to the ground as to be within reach of camels. Posts—Average life. I should set down the average life per post as seven years, though the Eussian Inspector seems to think it only five years. It is interesting to note that the posts situated in the Hamun last much longer than those on dry land. Insulators and Brackets. The Insulator (see Diagram II) is an ordinary porcelain cup and is fixed by means of cement to one end of a curved stalk the other end of which is screwed into the post. I have found these insulators and stalks answer the purpose very well. If, however, the same pattern is not stocked by the Indian Government graph Department, it could be replaced, as occasion demands, by the kind used in India (in Kashmir for example). In this case of course brackets and backs would also have to be supplied. Technical. A list of the Telegragh Offices on the line will be found in the Tables attached.

Indian Telegraph authorities will do what they can, but point out that as Khaf-Nasratabad section is cut off from telegraph communication with India by the gap between Robat and Nasratabad, much difficulty will be involved by control from India. It would seem better, if Indo-European Telegraph Department have spare staff available from Tehran-Meshed line, which they are no longer to maintain, that that Department should undertake the reponsibility for the control of the Khaf-Nasratabad section instead of the Indian Telegraph Department.

AT a dinner given at the Dutch Legation on the 8th instant, the German Minister asked me what was the arrangement between ourselves and Russia for the cession of all British Concessions in Northern Persia. I asked where he had got this extraordinary story, and he replied that he understood it to be a part of the recent Agreement that all British Concessions in the North should he transferred to Russia and. in particular, that we were about “ to exchange our telegraph lines in the North for the Russian line.” I said that there had been some talk of Russia’s undertaking the maintenance of the Meshed-Tehran line instead of ourselves, hut 1 did not know what would come of it; it was a matter which interested the Telegraph Department, and was no part of the late Agreement. Probably some exaggerated version of this proposal had reached him. Count Quadt then turned to the question of road Concessions, and asserted two or three times that he knew for a fact that negotiations for their transfer were proceeding in London. I again asked him where he got this information for which there was not even the slight foundation that existed for the story about the exchange of telegraphs, but could get no reply, as at this point the Minister’s attention was occupied by his other neighbour, nor did he again revert to the subject. Our conversation did not last more than three or four minutes. Prom inquiries that I have since made, it seems that for the last three or four days it has been known in the bazaars that some kind of exchange connected with telegraphs is in contemplation, and probably it is thence that the German Minister got wind of the contemplated arrangement. But how the rumour reached the bazaars I am unable to say. I am inclined to think that Count Quadt was anxious to assure himself as to the state of affairs as regards the Khanikin line, but no mention whatever was made of it; it seems difficult to see what other interest he could find in the exchange of control over the Meshed-Tehran and Khaf-Nasratabad lines, unless it is to arouse the opposition of the Persian Government to the proposal. He appeared to be far more interested in the question of road Concessions, and, as I have said, insisted that negotiations on the subject were in progress in London. The Russian Minister, to whom I communicated the conversation I had had with Count Quadt, could not any more than myself account for the latter’s knowledge or surmise of the contemplated exchange of lines, but he thought that the circumstance made it desirable to hasten the exchange.

NICOLSON’S despatch No. 193 : Exchange of telegraphs in Persia. Inform the Russian Government, in reply to their Memorandum of 12th April, that, though Sir A. Nicolson’s communication of 23rd March did not specifically mention the admission of Russian signallers to the use of the line on the Khaf- Nasratabad section at specified hours, His Majesty’s Government had no intention of attempting to deprive them of this privilege, which would naturally belong to them in consequence of the grant to British signallers of a similar privilege on the Meshed- Khaf section and Tehran-Meshed line. His Majesty’s Government have, however, now submitted the whole question of the exchange of lines to a further examination, and have reached the conclusion that the best solution of that part of it which (concerns signallers would be the complete withdrawal by each Power of its employes from the sphere of the other, as was originally proposed in his Memorandum, handed to the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs on 15th April, 1907, and the conclusion of an Arrangement by which each should undertake to instruct its own employes on the lines within its sphere to transmit with due accuracy and dispatch all messages sent by agents of the other or in the interests of its subjects.

Following telegrams from Seistan and Meshed. From Seistan :— “No. 106 0. Your telegrams 217. It would be desirable that Russian signallers should be withdrawn from Seistan-Khaf section, but if this can only be secured by our withdrawing our signallers from Meshed and Teheran it would be in my opinion preferable that Russian signallers should remain ; otherwise Meshed and Turbat-i-Haidari would be entirely dependent on Persian signallers. The linking up of Seistan with Central Persia lines would not help matter as regards Meshed and Turbat-i-Haidari, as our control would only commence at Khaf. “ Provided that after exchange has taken place Russian privileges on Seistan line are strictly limited to those we have now, and we, on the other hand, are put in full possession of their rights, the presence of Russian signallers would not be a serious evil. “ I would point out that our position on Tehran-Meshed line is now to some extent prejudiced by signaller at Tehran being subject to Indo- European departmental rules, and not Government employe like those on the Meshed-Seistan line ,—vide my diary of 28th January 1907. If we maintain signallers at Meshed and Tehran after exchange has taken place, it would be preferable that the signaller at Tehran shall be directly under Legation, and free from restrictions referred to.” From Sykes :— “ No. 50 C. For many years Russians have maintained their employes on Meshed-Tehran line, which we controlled, without any noticeable dis advantage to us. If our men be withdrawn from Tehran-Meshed-Turbat- i-Haidari, communications from all Consulates much weakened and cyphers most difficult. Perhaps it is not fully realised that at Kerman I was unable to send cypher until British telegraphist arrived If Russia intends to observe Convention, there is, in my opinion, less objection to Russian signallers at Seistan than to the isolation of our Consulates and Agencies. Fully concur in Seistan telegram 106 C. Also I think Russians will consider retention of telegraphists by both Powers as reasonable, if not necessary, owing to Persian incapacity.” Practical objections urged by our local officers have considerable force and will perhaps be considered in consultation with Marling, to whom both telegrams were repeated. Subject to his opinion, however, we concur in view that it is desirable on general grounds to arrive at a settlement on basis of excluding signallers of either Power from zone of the other.* &gt; In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote no. 15378. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. Sir:- Foreign Office May 12th, 1908. &lt;- With reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo on the subject of the exchange of telegraph lines in Persia between Great Britain and Russia, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you here with copies of telegraphic correspondence with His Ma jesty^ Charg4 d*Affaires at Tehran relative to the withdrawal by each Power of all its signallers from the sphere of the other. Since, from the last of these communications it is now clear that Russian signallers on Persian tele graph lines are not prohibited by any specific regu lation from forwarding British messages, it appears ' erf The Under Secretary of State, to Sir E.Grey that the last objection to the proposed withdrawal is removed and that, from the point of view of His Majesty^ Government, all that is now required to India Office.to ensure the due transmission of such messages on the lines controlled by Russia in Persia is the con clusion with the Russian Government of an arrangement whereby each Power should undertake to instruct its employes to accept all messages sent by the agents of the other. Sir E.Grey is accordingly disposed to approach the Russian Government without further delay with re gard to this proposal and I am to transmit to you draft of a telegram conveying the necessary instruc tions on the subject to His Majesty’s Charg§ d*Affaires at St. Petersburg.

This arrangement might be con cluded by an exchange of notes. Such a solution appears to His Majesty's Govern ment to conform more strictly not only to the spirit of the Anglo-Russian Convention which aims at the re moval of all possible causes of friction between the two Powers as was so fully and clearly expressed in the Aide-Memoire of the Russian Government of June 13th, 1907, but also to that of Articles 1 and 2 of tne Agreement of August 31st, 1907. The 'same conditions' mentioned in the above Articles were understood at the time as being the conditions which affected the main tenance and repair of the lines and relations with and obligationsobligations towards the Persian Government, and His Majesty*s Government were indeed guided by that view in consenting to the continuance of Puss!an con trol over the Meshed-Kha± section.

It is assumed, in your telegrams Nos. 103 and 104, that after withdrawal of signallers of each Power from the line controlled by the other, we should be entirely dependent on Persians at Meshed and Turbat-i-Haidari. Are there any grounds for this ? Russians would presumably instal their own men in place of ours, and they would transmit British messages, as is the case elsewhere.jThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.1 this Embassy communicated on the 23rd ultimo, relative to the mode in which the transfer of the telegraph lines between Tehran and Meshed and Khaf and Nasratabad might he effected. consequence of the provisions of Article 1 of the Arrangement of the 31 st August last, and it demurs to any change being made in the allocation of the signallers on the Meshed-Seistan line, as Article 2 of the same Arrangement specifies that the existing. In short, the Russian Government wish to retain all their signallers at the terminus at Nasratahad and at intermediate stations, with access to the line at specified hours. I would beg leave to submit that the interpretation given by the Russian Govern ment to the meaning of Articles 1 and 2 of the Arrangement of the 31st August is an incorrect or, in any case, a very strained one. Throughout the negotiations concerning the Agreement as to Persia the object which was chiefly held in view was the removal of all causes of friction, and one of the principal elements of discord was precisely the question of signallers. Having that question in view, the original proposal of the British Government was that all Russian signallers should be removed from the Meshed-Seistan line and all British signallers from the Tehran-Meshed line, and this- proposal was embodied in the Memorandum presented to the Russian Government in April of last year. M. Isvolsky at the time did not much like the form in which the British proposal was cast, but I do not remember during the course of the negotiations gny indication being given that the signallers should remain when once the lines had been transferred. X think that the views with which both paities were animated on this point could not he better expressed than in the aide-wnemoire communicated by M. Isvolsky on the 13th June last, a copy of which was inclosed in my despatch No. 317 of‘the 14th June. In the Arrangement of the 31st August the c; same conditions undoubtedly were intended to refer to the conditions affecting maintenance _ and repair, and the obligations to and relations with the Persian Government. I think that there can be no doubt on that point. . . ^ ~ It must be admitted that the desire expressed m the Embassy Memorandum of the 23rd March that British signallers should be admitted to the use of the line at certain fixed hours at Tehran and Meshed does weaken the case as presented above, and would, doubtless, lead to the maintenance, if desired, of a^ Russian signaller at the Nasratabad terminus. But whatever may be the ultimate wishes of His Majesty s Government on the above point, I would submit that a firm stand should be taken on the question of removing Russian signallers from the intermediate stations on the Khaf-Nasratabad section. „ . ,. +i t&gt; • • * I have ventured to make the above few observations on the Russian aide- memoire, but I trust on my approaching arrival in London that I may be permitted to discuss the whole question more fully.

Isvolsky this afternoon that I wished to speak to him in regard to the exchange of the control which the British and Russian Governments exercised over the Tehran-Meshed and Meshed-Seistan telegraph lines respectively. It seemed, I said, desirable that the question of the mode in which the Persian Government should be approached should be left to the two Representatives at Tehran to arrange, and I understood that both M. de Hartwig and Mr. Marling were now of opinion that perhaps the two Telegraph Administrations should broach the subject of the exchange, the two- Legations remaining for the moment in the background. His Excellency said that it did not appear to him at first sight that there was any objection to the two Representatives coming to an agreement between themselves as to- the best method of presenting the question to the Persian Government. I observed that while the Persian Government were being approached at Tehran, it appeared to my Government desirable that he and I should arrange certain details in respect to the transfer, and I had prepared a Memorandum, which I should leave with him, in regard to the arrangements which might be made. I have the honour to inclose a copy of that paper. I thought it best not to mention in the Memorandum the information which has been obtained as to the mode in which the Russian control is exercised over the Meshed-Seistan line, and as to the disbursements which are made by the Russian Administration. Our information on those points is not very full, and it seemed to me that it would be preferable for the Russian Government themselves to give complete details on the subject. 1 also considered that the question of a Russian signaller remaining at Nasratabad need not be mentioned in the Memorandum, as it is possible that the Russian Government may not care to retain one at that terminus, and there appeared to be no necessity to take the initiative in alluding to the matter. Should M. Isvolsky raise the point, I would then state that no objection would be made by His Majesty’s Government. M. Isvolsky did not read my Memorandum, as he understood that it chiefly dealt with details ; but I will inquire of him in a few days’ time what are his views on the subject. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A.

EN attendant le resultat des demarches qui seront faites par les deux Representants a Tehbran pour obtenir le consentement du Gouvernement Persan h 1’Arrangement signele 18 (31) Aout, 1907, concernant les lignes telegraphiques entre Teheran-Meshed et Khaf-Nasratabad, ’le Gouvernement Britannique pense qu’il serait opportun de regler certaines mesures de detail y relatives. Pour ce qui concerne les demarches a faire aupres du Gouvernement Persan, le Gouvernement Britannique est d’avis qu’il serait mieux de laisser la mode de procedure aux deux Representants sur les lieux. Pour ce qui concerne la ligne Teheran-Meched, les arrangements actuels sont les suivants : A Teheran et a Meched le hi telegraphique se termine dans les bureaux de I “ Indo-Euro pean Telegraph Department,' mais a des heures fixes les employes Russes y ont acces pour se servir de la ligne.

Les gardes sur la hgne sont payes par e Gouvernement Persan, mais le Gouvernement Indien, pour aider an paiement des [2872 gg 4]2. As a part of the telegraph line between Meshed and Seistan crosses the above- mentioned zone, this line is divided into two sections at Khaf ; the section north of this noint is under the inrisdiction of the Russian Administration, and the section to the south of the same point is under the jurisdiction of the British Administration, on conditions, as far as the two sections of the line are concerned, similar to those to which the telegraph line under the jurisdiction of the Russian Administration is at ^ 3 As the management of a telegraph line by a mixed Administration is attended, as experience- shows, bv numerous disadvantages, two commutators will be placed at Khaf one for the Russian line and the other for the British line. In order to avoid delay in the service of telegrams, in view of the fact that the single line from Meshed to Seistan is thus divided into two distinct and independent lines, the Russian 'Commutator may be connected with the British commutator. 4. All the rights, obligations, and expenses connected with the maintenance, inspection, control, and repair of the lines under the jurisdiction of the British Administration shall revert to Great Britain, and those connected with the lines under the jurisdiction of the Russian Administration to Russia, It is of course only a question of the total amount of rights, obligations, and expenses which at present accrue to Great Britain or to Russia from the respective lines between Meshed and Tehran and Meshed-Seistan. . n -r, 5.

Isvolsky to-day the draft of the note concerning the transfer of the supervision over the telegraph lines in Persia between Tehran and Meshed, and between the latter place and Nasretabad, of which I had the honour to inclose a copy in my despatch No. 132 of the 13th March, and the terms of which you were good enough to approve in your telegram No. 48 of the 13th instant. M. Isvolsky read the document and said that he must examine the proposal before giving a reply. He further observed that he presumed that the Persian Government would have to be approached on the subject; and I replied that probably this course would have to be adopted eventually and after we had come to an agreement on the subject, but that this need not delay our closing the question so far as the two Governments were concerned. I may mention that M. Poklewsky stated to me yesterday that he had heard one point raised in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in connection with the question of the telegraph lines, but that it had not been submitted to M. Isvolsky. The point was that as the terminus of the Seistan line was in Meshed, which would be in the Russian zone, it might be desirable that the British supervision should only commence from Turbat-i-Haidari. I told M. Poklewski that at first sight it seemed to me it would be most inconvenient and undesirable that the British supervision should .not extend over the whole line. I do not know if M. Isvolsky will be inclined to adopt the above view, and Turbat-i-Haidari is equally with Meshed within the proposed Russian zone. Should M. Isvolsky adopt the view which apparently is afloat in his Ministry, I would propose to inform him that the transfer must be complete and cover the whole line, and not be limited to that portion of it which is outside of the Russian zone. It is quite possible that M. Isvolsky will not mention this special point to me. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. NICOLSON.

Isvolsky seemed to he quite _ in accord with such an arrangement, and said that he hoped to he very shortly in a position to communicate a reply to the observations which I had handed to him on the Russian draft Convention. He added that the military authorities were examining the question as to the Russian line terminating at Zulficar, but he did not appear to consider that there would be any difficulty in arranging that point in accordance with the desires of His Majesty’s Government. I venture to submit, for your consideration, a rough draft of an annex to the Convention with respect to the transfer of the control over the two telegraph lines between Meshed and Tehran and Meshed and Nasratahad.

Tehran, March 26, 1908. WITH reference to my telegram No. 82 of the 26th instant, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of Major Kennion’s detailed report regarding the system and number of employes on the Khaf-Seistan telegraph line. Appended to the report are an estimate of the cost per mensem of the telegraphs and line establishment and a report on the condition of the line prepared by Mr. W. R. Howson, Sub-Assistant Superintendent of Telegraphs. It is to be presumed that this despatch will furnish the information, or most of it, required by your telegram No. 66 of the 23rd instant. I would point out, with reference to the inference drawn by Major Kennion in the concluding sentence of section 1 of his despatch, that M. de Hartwig has informed me more than once that the local Russian Telegraph Department is in ignorance of the proposed exchange of lines. From other passages in his despatch (notably section 5 (a), (b), and (/), paragraph 2) it would almost seem as if Major Kennion anticipated that after the exchange has been effected Russia will still retain signallers on the line in the same position as that now occupied by the British signallers. I should be glad to learn whether this is in accordance with the arrangement contemplated by His Majesty’s Government. It would certainly seem desirable that the Russian signallers should be entirely removed, and I submit that it is a condition we may well require, seeing that no British functionaries of any kind will remain on the Tehran-Meshed line. On one other point I would venture to offer an observation. In section 6 Major Kennion suggests that it would be convenient that the control and maintenance of the Khaf-Seistan section should be carried out under the general superintendence of His Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain. I can well conceive that this arrangement will have advantages so long as this section remains en Pair as regards the other British telegraph lines in Persia; but if, as is hoped, it should at some time be connected up with the remainder of the system by an extension from Seistan to Robat, the Director of the Indo-European Telegraph Department at Tehran will probably prefer to have the management of the line under his exclusive jurisdiction. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. [12646] (No. 72.) Sir, In closure 1 in No. 1. Major Kennion to Government of India. Sir, Seistan, February 23, 1.908. ^ I HAVE the honour to request a reference to the Government of India’s despatch, /uj dated the 16th January, 1908, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India on the / subject of the telegraph line from Meshed to Tehran and Seistan. 2. In the fourth paragraph of the above-cited paper it is mentioned that the Government of India are in possession of no very definite information regarding the system and number of employes on the Khaf-Seistan section. I submit, in this connec tion, a copy of a note recorded by Mr. Howson, Sub-Assistant Superintendent of Telegraphs, which I trust will be found to supply the details required. 3. It will be noted that the list of the Russian staff, on the line given in Mr. Marling’s onfidential despatch dated toe 2nd December, 1907, is correct, with the exception of the inclusion of the mechanic Constantinow, who worked on the Meshed-Seh Deh section and who has since been withdrawn. 4. As regards the cost of upkeep, the inquiries I have made elicit the fact that no money is handed over by the local Governors of Seistan and Kain for this purpose. The Director of Customs, Seistan, has also told me that no money is paid from customs [2913 n—91 B %2 revenues. The gholams and line staff are, it seems, paid direct by the Russians; and if the latter are reimbursed at all, it is probably from telegraph receipts at Meshed or Tehran It may be noted that the gholams on the southern section of the line have recently been complaining of not having received their pay The inference may perhaps be drawn that the Russians, having failed to obtain reimbursement of sums previously spent on this account, and in vieiv of their connection with the line being severed, have discontinued payment. . . . M1 , . , , 5 The following are suggestions as to action which it will be necessary to take ^ when the line is handed over to us :— (a) At Nasratabad, Seistan, there are three rooms in the same telegraph building, set apart for the Persian, Russian, and British offices. At the present time the British office is only used for the storage of material, our signaller doing Ins work in the Persian office The line o-oes first to the Russian office, whence it is given to the l ersian office bv means of a commutator. The steps to he taken will he to remove the present terminal pole to outside the British office, and to so connect the wires as to place the control of the line in our hands instead ot as at present in the hands ot the Russians. 0 r e ] se and it would be nreferable as attracting less attention tor ourselves and the (b.) At Birjand, British, Russian, and Persian signallers have hitherto worked in the same office. If this arrangement continues, no alteration of the wire will he necessary, though, when occasion offers, an endeavour should be made to obtain the use of a separate room, and so to arrange the wire as to give our signaller the control of If however, in the meantime the Russians succeed in obtaining a separate room for their tape instrument, either with or without the control ot the line, we should, I presume, expect them to transfer the privilege to us on the agreement being brought into effect. . , . , The latest information I have received on this subject is that orders have been received from Tehran not to allow the line-wire to go first to the Russians room. (c.) At Khaf it will be necessary to arrange for a telegraph building and quarters for the signaller. The requisite instruments, in order to carry out the proposal ot separate offices and commutators, will also have to be sent. This point will be further touched on in connection with line staff. , . ,, {d.) Although Mr. Howson’s note shows that the line is ill-constructed, it would not seem necessary to undertake its reconstruction immediately. This could be done gradually, and the batteries, insulators, and other fittings could be replaced as they become worn out. An immediate inspection of the line with the view of making- estimates for the future and the submission of indents would he advisable. (e.) The introduction of telephones, on the line which has been suggested by Mr. Howson, would seem advisable on all grounds. {f.) The only additions to the British staff on the line, which now stands as shown in the margin,* would be a signaller for Khaf. Both Mr. McManus and Mr. Howson, who are the Sub-Assistant Superintendents at Seistan and Birjand respectively, have experience of construction work, and the deputation of a special inspector from India to look after the line would he superfluous. It would, however, he necessary to give a special allowance to the individual selected for the charge of the line. At present, as Mr. Howson is doing very useful political work in Birjand, it seems that the best and most convenient arrangement would probably he for Mr. McManus to have charge of the line as Inspecting Telegraph Master, with his head-quarters in Seistan, whence he would make an annual inspection of the line m the autumn. L should prefer, however, that a final decision on this point should be left pending a settlement regarding the Birjand Vice-Consulate. As regards Khaf, it may he expected, when the exchange ot lines takes place, that the Kniaz Vachadze will be transferred to this place, and a Russian signaller sent m his place. In any case, it would seem advisable that the British signaller sent to Khat should have some experience of the country and be able to speak the language, so that as his telegraph work will he small—he may be of use as a newsagent. Lhe post, however, will be an isolated one, and should, I think, carry with it a special allowance. In this connection i would point out that it does not seem really necessary for either the Russians or ourselves to have a signaller at Khat. A mutual agreement not to keep British or Russian signallers there would not, so far as I can see, prejudice our * 2 Sub-Assistant Superintendents, 1 signaller.political interests in any way, while there would be a material saving of expense. This, however, is a question on which Major Sykes is better qualified to express an opinion. As pointed out by Mr. Howson, an Indian sub-inspector to take the place of the Russian mechanic will be indispensable. The line staff of gholam-bashis and gholams should be taken over as they stand. Their pay is adequate and their numbers sufficient. As Khaf will be a terminus, as far as our supervision of the line is concerned, it should be theoretically possible to manage with one gholam at this post instead of two, hut in view of a signaller being posted to this place, who would require a peon, I would prefer to waive the question of this trifling reduction. 6 . Since.the line will remain the property of the Persian Government, it will be convenient that its control and maintenance should be carried out under the general superintendence of His Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain; and in these circum stances, if it is decided to keep a signaller at Khaf, he would, I presume, be under the same controlling officer. This suggestion should not be read to imply a recommendation that Khaf:, which is at present in the Turbat Consular district, should be included in that of Seistan and Kain. This question would naturally depend on the ultimate decision arrived at regarding the Vice-Consulate at Birjand and Consular arrangements generally in Eastern Persia. 7.

Numbers per Af.fe-The Russians have adopted from information received from the Russian inspector, 16 posts to the verst, which woiks out to 241 Th^ reason for such a high proportion is due to the prevalence of white ants, which freelv attack the portions of the posts buried. It will be readily undeistood that the nearer the posts are to one another the less likelihood there '^ 'hen a post breaks off, of the wire sagging so near to the ground as to be within reach of camels Posts: Average Life.—I should set down the average life per post as seven years, though the Russian inspector seems to think it only five years. It is interesting to note that the posts situated in the Hamun last much longer than on dry land Insulators and Brackets.—The insulator (see Diagram No. 2*) is an ordinary porcelain .cup, and is fixed by means of cement to one end of a curved stalk, the othei end ot which is screwed into the post. n u* I have found these insulators and stalks answer the purpose very weh. it however, the same pattern is not stocked by the Indian Government telegraph Department it could be replaced, as occasion demands, by the kind used m India .m Kashmir, for example). In this case, of course, brackets and backs would also have to V&gt;e ^Technical. —A list of the telegraph offices on the line will be found in the tables attached. . Circuit. —All the offices are joined up for ordinary “open circuit woi king. Instruments. —Each office is fitted up with a Morse set, consisting ot relay (resistance 500 ohms), sounder, key, and galvanometer fitted on a hoard. Also a two-plat ig i nmg discharger and a four-bar switch or commutator. All the instruments are by Messis. Switch.—Oi all the above-mentioned instruments the switch is the only one whicli calls for particular mention, on account of the part it plays in the “ tapping o messages. * Not printed. (This switch, vide Diagram No. 1 ,* is used for joining the line “direct” or for K.O., i.e., keeping open. With plugs inserted in holes 3 and 4 the line is joined direct, and with plugs in 1 and 2 both sides of the line are connected with the instru ments. When, however, a station is working with one side, the plug connecting the other side to the instruments is removed, and that side remains “ insulated ” until such time as the plug is reinserted or the line joined “ direct.” It is very easy to interpolate the “ receiver ” of an intermediate office by simply connecting a wire between the screw at one end of bar C and the earth screw of the receiver, and at the same time throwing off the earth connection. The plugs inserted for this interpolating would be 1 and 4 or 2 and 3 . By interpolating the “receiver” an intermediate office can easily “tap” any telegrams that may be exchanged between an office on one side and another on the other side of the intermediate office. Butteries. —The battery in use at present is the “ Medinger,” a variety of the “Daniel!.” J This class of battery has been introduced by the Russians in place of the “ Minotto ” battery formerly used by the Persians. In my opinion the “ Minotto ” is, it anything, preferable, as it requires less super vision, and cannot be so easily tampered with by the Persian telegraphists, the majority of whom know very little about technical telegraphy. Should the “Minotto” battery be adopted by us the necessary sawdust is obtain able in Meshed. A limited quantity of sawdust (mulberry and walnut) is also procur able in Birjand, but I think that if an order be placed in advance by the local sawyers sufficient could be collected for all the offices on the line. The extra cost of carriage from Meshed would thereby be saved. Line Staff: Persian Line Staff. —Tables 1 and 2 show the present distribution of the Persian line establishment. Persian Line Staff : their Salary. —The Russians pay the Persian line staff at the following rate per mensem :— Gholam-bashi, 170 krans (50 rupees). Gholam, 100 krans (rupees 29 : 6 : 7). The above rates cannot be reduced compatibly with efficiency, and I propose that the same rates be retained by us. The salary of the gholams includes the upkeep of a horse. Russian Inspectors. —These have their head-quarters at Khaf and Shusp respectively, their sections being from Meshed to Seh Deh and Seh Deh to Seistan (Seh Deh is situated almost midway between Kain and Birjand). It will be seen that the Russian inspectors have selected as their head-quarters places almost centrally situated in their sections. Their reason for the same is obviously to more efficiently supervise the line. British Inspector. —I think one British inspector would be able to supervise the whole line from Khaf to Seistan; but he should be allowed one sub-inspector, to whom I shall allude in a separate paragraph. British Inspector : his Duties.- —The duties of the inspector would be to arrange for a supply of posts, the submitting of indents and supervising the annual repairs of the line, and the technical arrangements of all telegraph offices. Sub-Inspector : why Necessary. —An Indian Mahommedan sub-inspector would, I think, be absolutely necessary to carry out the annual maintenance repairs under the supervision of the British inspector. He would also instruct the gholam-bashis and gholams in the preparing and maintaining of batteries, the making of joints, and, in fact, in all the routine work necessary tor them to know. British Telegraphists : how they may he Utilized to Assist the Inspector. —The British telegraphists at Seistan and Birjand could when necessary issue orders, on an inter ruption occurring, to the gholams of the office nearest to the fault to proceed on ttie line. Miscellaneous. Telephones .—As the gholam-bashis at Buniabad and Bandan are unable to signal on the Morse instruments, it is absolutely necessary that they should be supplied with telephones to ascertain the state of communications, and it would be consequently Not printed.Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received May 4, 6’30 p.m.) (No. 118.)

This is an argument of considerable force in favour of the retention of British and Russian signallers as at present, and is one which the Consul at Meshed thinks the Russians Viill employ. Apparently the Consuls take it for granted that Russian signallers cannot, or will not he allowed t0 » transmit British Government telegrams, or possibly the&gt; consider that it would be unsafe to use this agency. It might perhaps be well to have this point cleared up, as the information would be useful in considering the caseTj However the views of the Government of India on the subject have still to be received.

As this question is now under consideration by the Government of India and as Sir A. Micolson will shortly have the opportunity of consulting with Sir E.

In view of these considerations and of the fact that the settlement of the details of the exchange by negotiation at St. Petersburg is not in itself a matter of great urgency so long as the consent of the Persian Government to the transaction can be obtained at Tehran^ Sir E.

Foreign Office, April 15, 1908, 6-55 Exchange of telegraphs.* • ♦CONFIDENTIAL. 1 (No. 71.) As regards Meshed-Seistan line, Memorandum observes that our proposals in regard to withdrawal of Russian employes from section south of the Khaf are not in conformity with Article 2 of Arrangement of 31st August, although said withdrawal is compensated by proposed removal of British employes north of Khaf But the Memorandum argues that as the line is to be handed over by the Russian Administration on the same conditions as at present exist, and as British employes are at present allowed to use the line, Russian employes should therefore be equally allowed access when the line passes to the British Administration, especially as the Memorandum of 23rd March admits the same principle in regard to the Tehran-Meshed line in respect to British employes having access to it when it passes under Russian control. Memorandum considers that the most equitable arrangement would be therefore for British employes to ha've access at fixed hours to section north of Khaf, and Russian employes to have similar access to section south of Khaf, as has been proposed in Memorandum of 23rd March for the Tehran-Meshed line. 1 do not think that the Russian interpretation of Articles 1 and 2 of Arrangement of 31st August is at all a correct one. The “ same conditions ” signified conditions as to upkeep, &amp;c., and the arrangements with the Persian Government, and in no way contemplated retention of signallers. )CJ would point out that in our original proposals t* ' C (see my despatch No. 132 of 13th March, 1907, iuclosures) I suggested withdrawal of r all employes, and idea always was, and I certainly considered it was, shared by the Russian Government, that signallers should be removed as being one of the causes of friction. In this connection I would draw attention to Memorandum from Minister for Foreign Affairs, inclosed in my despatch No. 317 of 14th June, and especially to the first three paragraphs of his Memorandum. 'JP I am afraid that our case on this point has been weakened by suggesting in Memorandum of 23rd March retention of British signallers at Tehran-Meshed. ^ As this point is, however, under discussion with the Government of India, and as I shall be able to consult shortly with you personally in London, 1 would propose to enter into no discussion on the subject.

It seemed, 1 said, desirable that the question of the mode in which the Persian Government should be approached should he left to the two Representatives at Tehran to arrange, and I understood that both M. de Hartwig and Mr. Marling were now of opinion that perhaps the two telegraph Administrations should broach the subject of the exchange, the two Legations remaining for the moment in the background. . Excellency said that it did not appear to him at first sight that there was any objection to the two Representatives coming to an agreement between themselves as to the best method of presenting the question to the Persian Government. I observed that while the Persian Government were being approached at Tehran, it appeared to my Government desirable that he and I should arrange certain details in respect to the transfer, and I had prepared a Memorandum, which I should leave with him, in regard to the arrangements which might be made. I have the honour to inclose a copy of that paper. I thought it best not to mention in the Memorandum the information which has been obtained as to the mode in which the Russian control is exercised over the Meshed-Seistan line, and as to the disbursements which are made by the Russian Administration. Our information on those points is not very full, and it seemed to me that it would be preferable for the Russian Government themselves to give complete details on the subject. I also considered that the question of a Russian signaller remaining at Nasratabad need not be mentioned in the Memorandum, as it is possible that the Russian Government may not care to retain one at that terminus, and there appeared to be no necessity to take the initiative in alluding to the matter. Should M. Isvolsky raise the point, I would then state that no objection would be made by His Majesty’s Government. M. Isvolsky did not read my Memorandum, as he understood that it chiefly dealt with details ; but I will inquire of him in a few days’ time what are his views on the subject. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A.

Sir E.Grey is not aware that there is, at the present time, any objection to this plan from the point of view of His Majesty's Government, while both Mr. The Under Secretary of State, India Officeii Mr. Marling and the Russian Minister at Tehran consi der that the request made hy the Persian Government may offer a favourable opportunity for approaching them with a view to obtain their consent to the ex change of the lines. Sir E.Grey would be glad to receive an expres sion of Mr. Morley's views on this point. No step, however, can in any case be taken by the two Representatives at Tehran until the Russian Gov ernment have signified their assent to the course pro posed to them by His Majesty's Government that the time and manner of approaching the Persian Government on this subject should be left to the Representatives' discretion and until they have sent instructions to Monsieur de Hartwig in this sense. Sir A. Nicolson has therefore recalled this point to the attention of the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs. Sir E.Grey is disposed, with the concurrence of Mr. Morley to approve the terms of Sir A.Nicolson's communication to Monsieur Izvolski as reported in his telegramtelegram and to inform him that His Majesty’s Govern ment share his view that no action as to the details of the exchange should he taken at Tehran until the reply of the Russian Government to his memorandum of the 23rd ultimo has been received. It must at the same time he remembered that, if Mr. Morley agrees to the proposal put forward in my letter of the 7th instant, that neither Power should retain signallers on the line controlled by the ouher, it will become necessary to inform the Russian Govern ment that the views set forth in that memorandum have been, to that extent, modified. I am accordingly to state that Sir E.Grey hopes to learn Mr. Money's opinion on this proposal with as little delay as possible. The last two sentences of Mr. Marling*s telegram were of course, written in ignorance of the sugges tion above referred to. I am.

Messing. Sir:- I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to ac knowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st. in stant, relative to the exchange with the Russian Govern ment of the Tehran-Meshed with the Khaf-Nasratabad telegraph line. With regard to the proposed retention of British signallers at Tehran and Meshed on the former line in return for which the Russian Government would probably demand the retention of a Russian signaller at Nasrata- •&gt;.• ... tad on the latter, I am to offer, for the consideration of Mr. Secretary Morley^ the following ohservations which are the result of a further examination to which India attach great importance to the presence of Bri tish signallers at Tehran and Meshed because, in their 1W that question has been submitted in this Department Sir E. Grey understands that the Government of absence be Under Secretary of State, India Office.absence, British messages might be unduly delayed and inaccurately transmitted and opportunity might be given to the Russian telegraph administration to tamper with British cyphers. Taking first the latter point, I am to observe that a similar opportunity already exists on all the lines under Russian control over whose wires British messages nov/ pass. The addition to their number of the Tehran-Meshed line would therefore not sensibly increase the danger referred to from which, moreover, no great harm appears so far to have resulted. The possibility of delay and incorrect transmis sion of British messages does not appear to Sir E.Grey to constitute an objection of such importance as to outweigh the disadvantages to British interests which, in his view, are to be feared from the retention of a Russian signaller at Nasratabad and the objection will disappear altogether if, as is believed to be not un likely, the Russian Government decide to entrust the management of the Tehran-Meshed line to the Indo- European Telegraph Company who would introduce business likebusiness-like and efficient methods of management. The retention of a Russian signaller at Nasratabad appears, on the other hand, to he open to grave objec- tion jnot only on the general ground that the presence of such an official in the British sphere of influence is in any case undesirable, but also,and more particu larly in view of the proposed extension of the Meehed- Seistan line to Koh-i-Malik-Siah, whereby the Persian telegraph system would be linked up with the Indian line running through Nushki and Robat. On the realisation of this project the exclusion of all possibility of foreign interference with tele graphic communication would become of paramount import ance to British and Indian interests. For these reasons. Sir E. Grey would propose, sub ject to Mr. Morley’s concurrence, to instruct Sir A. Nicolson to withdraw the suggestion made by him to the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs for the mainten- i ance of the British signallers at Tehran and Meshed. As regards the last paragraph of your letter and the second note by the Director in Chief of the Indo- European# Indo-European Telegraph Department which refers to it, I am to call attention to my letter of the . in stant (10734) forwarding copy of a despatch from Sir A. Nlcolson which contains the suggestion that His Majes ty's Government should not make any corimunicati on to the Russian Government relative to the conditions over the control exercised by the latter over the Meshed- Seistan line, but should await the receipt from them of the necessary particulars. Sir E. Grey will await Mr. Morley's views on this suggestion before proceeding further in the matter and hopes that he may be favoured with them without delay. I am Sir Your most obedient humble ServantHote on Foreign Office letter Ko .10734 dated 4th April 1903. The Russian Government have now been placed in possession of the views of the British Government with regard to the arrangements to be carried out on the Teheran-Meshed telegraph line after its transfer. They have been informed of the proposed retention of the British signallers at Teheran and Meshed. With regard to this proposal they may reply that, from the agreement for the transfer of the Janes, it, was not understood by them that British signallers would be retained at Teheran and Meshed, and that they had not contemplated that the Russian signaller at Nasratabad should remain there. If this should be the reply given, I think it would be necessary to put the case before the Government of India with the inquiry whether they would be prepared to agree to the removal of the British sig nallers an Teheran and Meshed in return for the withdrawal of the Russian signaller from Hasratabad. On the other hand the Russian Government may accept the view that British signallers should work at Teheran and Meshed, and the -rtUssiah signaller remain at ITasratabad• In ih-is case, if experience showed that the presence of the Russian signaller at Rasratabad was detrimental to British in terests, the question could be raised later about his with drawal, in return for the removal of our men from the Teheran and meshed offices. Sir A.lTicclscn will presumably in a few days be made acquainted with the views of the Russian Government on the memorandum he has placed before them. I do not think wewe should move further in the ra&amp;tter until it is known what the Russian views are.

V With reference to your letter of the 19th of Feb ruary relative to the steps to be taken to give effect to the arrangement with the Russian Government for the exchange of the Tehran-Meshed and Khaf-Nasratabad telegraph lines, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before Mr. Secretary Morley, copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Ambassador at St. Petersburg reporting the action which he has taken in fulfilment of the instruc tions conveyed to him by Sir E. Grey’s despatch No. 85 of the 18th ultimo, copy of which was forwarded to you in the letter from this Office of the following day. Mr. Morley will observe that Sir A.Nicolson, in the memorandum which he handed to the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject, omitted all mention of the information in the possession of His Majesty's Government The Under Secretary of State, India Office. /Government with regard to the manner in which Russian control is exercised over the Tehran-Meshed line,and as uo the disbursements made on this account by the Russian Administration. Sir E.Grey is disposed to approve Sir A.Nicol- son's action in this respect not only for the reasons given by His Excellency in his despatch but also be- f cause the information on the subject furnished by the Crovemment of India is, on some points, in contradic tion with that supplied by His Majesty's Charg6 d'Af- faires at Tehran so that the true facts of the case i are not yet certainly known to His Majesty's Govern ment . Sir E.Grey would also approve Sir A.Nicolson's proposal not to raise the question of the retention of a Russian signaller at Nasratabad after the ex change of the lines has taken effect, though it ap pears to him to be unlikely that the Russian Govern ment will consent to forego this right in view of the desire of His Majesty's Government to retain British signallerssignallers at Tehran and at Meshed. This latter point is not, it is true, specifically mentioned in '-is memorandum, hut tnat His Majesty’s Government attach importance to it appears with sufficient clear ness from the last sentence of the penultimate para graph of that paper. Sir E.Grey would he glad to learn whether Mr. Morley sees any ohjaction to the proposed approval of Sir A. Nicolson’s action and of the terms of His Ex cellency’s memorandum.

I info lined Monsieur IswolskM “this afternoon “tha u I vVished to speak to him in regard to the ex change of the control which the British and Russian Governments exercised over the Teheran-Meshed and Meshed-Seistan Telegraph lines respectively. It seemed, I said, desirable that the question of the mode in which the Persian Government should he ap proached should be left to the two Representatives at Tehran to arrange, and I understood that both Monsieur de Bartwig and Mr. Marling were now of opin ion that perhaps the two Telegraph administrations should broach the subject of the exchange,the two Legations remaining for the moment in the background. His Excellency said that it did not appear to him at first sight that there was any objection to the two Representatives coming to an agreement bet ween themselves as to the best method of presenting the question to the Persian Government. Sir E. Grey, Bart., M.P., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.I observed thet while the Persian Government were being approached at Tehran, it appeared to my Government desirable that he and I should arrange certain details in respect to the transfer, anc I had prepared a memorandum which I should leave with him in regard to the arrangements which might be made. I have the honour to enclose a copy of that paper. I thought it best not to mention in the memoran dum the information which has been obtained as to the mode in which the Russian control is exercised over the Meshed- Seistan line, and as to the disbursements which are made by the Russian Administration. Our information on those points is not very full, a.d it seemed to me that it would be preferable for the Rus sian Government themselves to give complete details on the subject. I also considered that the question of a Russian signaller remaining at Nasratabad need not be mentioned in the memorandum, as it is possible that the Russian Government may not care to retain one at that terminus,, and there appeared to be no necessitynecessity to take the initiative in alluding to the matter. Should Monsieur Iswolsky raise the point, * I *vould then state that no objection would be made by His Majesty’s Government. Monsieur Iswolsky did not read my memorandum as he understood that it chiefly dealt with details; but I will enquire of him in a few days time what are his views on the subject.

With respect to the exchange of the control over the Tehran-Meshed for that over the Khaf-Nasratabad line, the letter of the Government of India inclosed in the India Office letter of the 19th ultimo gives full details of the manner in which they would propose to effect the transaction, and I am fully in agreement with all their suggestions except their proposal that the matter should be settled informally between the two Governments without any reference to the Persian Government. This course would, I consider, be likely to produce an unfavourable impression on opinion in Persia so soon as the arrangement became known, and to inspire mistrust both of Great Britain and Russia, especially at the present moment, when jealousy of foreign interference is exceedingly active throughout the country. Your Excellency will perceive that the Government of India express themselves in favour of the retention of British and Russian signallers at terminal stations ; and the Director-in-chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department considers that the presence of British signallers at these stations is essential to the satisfactory trans mission of English messages, and that the advantage derived therefrom therefore outweighs any possible drawback which might result from the presence of a corre sponding number of Russian signallers. On the other hand, it is proposed to remove all British signallers from intermediate stations on the line controlled by Russia, and, correspondingly, all Russian signallers from similar stations on that controlled by Great Britain, since in that case the presence of British signallers is held to confer but slight advantages, while that of Russian signallers on intermediate stations on the Khaf-Nasratabad line is considered very undesirable. In spite, therefore, of the importance attached by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed to the continued presence of a British signaller at Turbat-i-Haidari (see the copy of his letter to the Government of India inclosed in the India Office letter of the 25th February), the India Office are of opinion that His Majesty’s Government are not in a position to press for his retention, and in this view I concur. I also transmit to your Excellency herewith copy of a telegram from Mr. Marling, dated the 16th March,| setting forth the financial obligations now discharged by the Russian and Persian Governments respectively in the manage ment of the whole line from Meshed to Nasratabad. In his second note inclosed in the India Office letter of the 19th February, Mr. Kirk expresses the opinion that the demand of the Russian Acting Consul at Birjand, reported in Mr. Marling’s telegram No. 44 of the 13th ultimo, for a special and separate room wherein to instal a new tape instrument, should be resisted, and points out that this could be done on the ground that such an arrange ment would constitute a violation of the status quo.

This course would I consider, be likely to produce an unfavourable impression on opinion in Persia so soon as the arrangement became known and to inspire mistrust both of Great Britain and Russia es pecially at tho present moment when jealousy of for eign interference is exceedingly active throughout tho country. Your Kxceilencv will perceive that the Direetor- in-Chiof of the Indo-European Telegraph Department in the first of his two notes enclosed in the same let ter, expresses himself as in favour of the retention of British and Russian signallers at terminal sta tions. It is considered that the presence of British signallersI • ■■■■I signallers at these stations is essential to the sa tisfactory transmission of English messages and that the advantage derived therefrom therefore outweighs any possible drawback which might result from the pre sences of a corresponding number of Bussian signallers. On the other hand it. ip proposed to remove all British signallers from intermediate stations on the line con trolled by Russia and, correspondingly, all Pussian signallers from similar stations on that controlled by Great Britain, since in that case the presence of British signallers is held to confer but slight advan tages while that of Russian signallers on intermediate stations on the Khaf-'I; .sratabad line is considered very undesirable, in spite, therefore, of the import ance attached by His Majesty's Consul-General 1 Bo shed to the continued presence of a British signaller at Turbat-i-lt idari (see the copy of his letter to the Government of India enclosed in the India Office letter of February 25th) the India Office are of opinion that His Majesty's Government are not in a position to press for his retention and in this view I cor cur.I also transmit to Your Excellency herewith copy of a telegram from Mr. Marling, dated March 16th, setting forth the financial obligations now discharg ed by the Russian and Persian Governments respective ly in the management of the whole line from Meshed to ■ Jasratabad. In his second note also dated February 14th, copy of which is enclosed in the same letter (that of February 19th), hr. Kirk expresses the opinion that the demand of the Russian Acting Consul at Birjand, reported in hr. Marling*s telegram Mo.44 of the 13th ultimo, for a special and separate room wherein to in- stal a new tape instrument, should be resisted and points out that this could be done on the ground that such an arrangement would constitute a violation of the s tatus quo . Your Excellency has already, in ac cordance with the instructions conveyed in my telegram Jo.64 of the 2nd instant, called upon the Fusci n Oov- ernnant for an explanation on this point and as this may very well involve a withdrawal of the Acting Con- &gt;ul ■ s demand it seems better at present to t ke no ac tion•» acMon which may subsequently prove to have been su perfluous. The mutter, in any case, is not one which need prevent you from opening negotiations with the Russian Government on the general question but it would be well to remind them of the request which has been conveyed to them and to inform them that His ? ajosty’s Government trust that it will receive at tention fit as early a date as possible. Ghould it be agreed, as His Majesty’s Government desire, that all signallers at intermediate stations are to be removed, the arrangement would of course ap ply to the Russian signaller at Birjand and upon his removal the demand for a separate room there would fall to the ground of itself. With reference to the cession of the British rights over the Tehr&amp;n-Khanikin line, his despatch r o.B7 of the 26th ultimo Mr. Barling, in , refers to a sug gestion made by the Russian Minister at these rights, now vested in the Indo-Eu Department should, when surrendered to Tehran ropean Russia that Telegraph be taken overovtii on hor bolialf by t-ho Inclo-Europoan Tslegraph Corn- pany which is under Hubs ian protection, and, with reference to this suggestion, he reports a proposal rnade by the local manager of the Company, that, should the cession take place, the Company, instead of taking over the existing wire, should construct a new line from Kaavin to tamed an anu take over the existing wire from thence to Khanikin. In Mr. Kirk*8 opinion as expressed in his note copy of which is end- sed .i.n the India Office letter of th ; 11th instant, Monsieur de Hartwig*s suggestion, if carried into effect, would be advantageous to Bri tish interests.

Morley agrees in the view of the Secy, of State for Foreign Affairs that the discussion of the details of the transfer at Si. Petersburg need not delay the steps to be taken at Tehran by the Russian and British represent atives to obtain the consent of the Persian Government to the exchange; and that the question of the transfer to Russia of the British rights over the Tehran-Khanihin line need not be raised immediately. As regards the question of the signallers at the terminal stations of the two lines, Mr. Morley is of opinion that it will be best to attempt to obtain the consent of the Russian Govt, to the retention of British signallers at Meshed and Tehran, even if that should involve the retention of a Russian signaller at Nasratabad. Neither Government presumably will claimgPViMItfMfeJ* claim to retain signallers at the inter mediate stations situated in the zone of the other.

Mr. Morley would suggest that this sno ala be pointed out to Mr. Marling and that he. should be instructed to procure locally all the available information ana submit it in a tabulated form.

The Government of India show in their despatch that they want British signallers to work over the Teheran-meshed line even though it entails the Russians keeping signallers at Nasratabad and Khaf r to work over that section. But if Sir A.llicolson can obtain the removal of the Russian signaller at Kasratabad so much the better. British signallers would also work between Khaf and Meshed over the Russian section, seeing that they would ■be stationed at both these places.

Sir:- (V With reference to your letter of the 20th instant and previous correspondence relative to the proposed modification of telegraph arrangements in Persia conse- Quent upon the Anglo-Russian Convention of August 31st 1907 ., I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before Mr. Secre tary Morley, decypher of a telegram from His Majesty's Ambassador at, St. Petersburg on the subject of the con ditions of the exchange of the Tehran-Meshed and Khaf- Nasratabad lines between His Majesty’s and the Russian Governments. Sir E. Grey sees no objection to Sir A. Nicolson*s proposal to inform the Russian Minister for Foreign Af fairs that the discussion at St. Petersburg of the de tails of the transfer need not delay the steps which His Maj e sty's and the Russian Representatives at Tehran may 3 Under Secretary of State India Office.s may decide to take to obtain the consent of the Persian Government to that transaction. Sir A. Nicolson appears to have interpreted cor rectly the wishes of Hie Majesty's Government as to the removal of the Russian signallers from the Intermediate stations on the Khaf-Nasratabad section and the reten tion of the British signallers at the terminal stations on the Tehran-Meshed line. With regard to the penultimate paragraph of this telegram. Sir A. Nicolson has now explained, in a fur ther message, that, if Monsieur Izvolski shows no desire to retain a Russian signaller at Nasratabad, he ■ proposes to endeavour to obtain the removal of that of ficial at the same time as that of the Russian signall ers at the intermediate stations on the Khaf-Nasratabad section. Sir E. Grey considers that such an arrangement would he, in itself, very desirable but that the Rus sian Government are unlikely to consent to the removal of the Russian signaller at Nasratabad unless His Majes ty's /Maj 0 sty'e Government on their part are willing to re-' linquish the right to maintain a British signaller at Tehran or at Meshed to whose presence, he understands, Mr. Morley attaches great importance to ensure the correct transmission of messages in English. Sir E. Grey concurs in Sir A. Nicolson’s view that it is tetter not to raise the question of the transfer to Russia of the British rights over the Teh- ran-Khanikin line while, as reported in His Excellency’ telegram No. §lf, of the instant, it is still under the consideration of the competent Department of the Russian Government. Sir E. Grey is disposed to reply to Sir A. Nicol son’s telegram in the sense of the foregoing observa tions hut would he glad, before taking any action, to be favoured with an expression of Mr. Morley’s views on the subject. I am. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,Sb A. ?\icolson to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received March 22 , 4*30 p.m.) I presume I should be right in telling Minister for Foreign Affairs that our discussions as to details of transfer need not delay steps which the two representatives at Tehran may take for obtaining the consent of the Persian Government to the tiansaction. He should make no difficulty as to the removal of signallers, &amp;c., from intermediate stations on lyhaf—Nasratabad section, and I trust he will raise no objection to British signallers remaining at terminal stations on Tehran—Meshed line. I understand we are willing that Russian signallers should remain at T Ch af. I will endeavour to obtain removal of a Russian signaller at the former place [sic] if I see that he is well disposed and not disinclined to do so [sic]. I think I had better not raise at present question of Khanikin section, as it is still under consideration of the competent Department here.

In Slr A.Klcolson's letter No.487 dated 21et September 1907 he wrote to the foreign Office that M.Isvolsky had reported that the Persian Government had tacitly consented to the Russian Administration undertaking the upkeep of the Meshed Seistan line, and in enclosure No.2 of that letter the staff employed and the cost of repairs are shewn. The annual repairs are said to cost from £600 to £1000, and the yearly pay of the native line staff to he £657, Mr.Marling*s information is that cost of telegraph and line establishment is Rs.2102 per mensem, which is equivalent to £16 80 a year. By telegraph it is presumed he means the repairs of the telegraph line. The information given by the Persian Director at Meshed that he pays the rent of offices and the wages of Persian signallers, and that the Russians pay all other charges seems likely to be right, but the correctness of these details can only be found out locally^ and no assistance can well be expected from this side in the matter. The payments by the Governors of Seistan and Kain may have been made for the construction of the line, and not for its maintenance.

The British maintain the Teheran-Meshed line for the Perstan Government under an infernal arrangement, which either side can put an end to whenever i-f ™ nenever 11 may desire to do so. The Russians maintain the Mesheri.aei=+ es&gt;ied -Sei S tan line on much the same con ations. Tften the question of the exchange of control over the lines is brought before the Persian Government, it i B possible they may object to having any change made, or may decide that their own Telegraph Administration should maintain the lines. It has been reported that the feeling in the Persian national Assembly is at present strongly in favour of Persian affairs being managed by Persian officials. It is thought that the question of the transfer should therefore, if possible, be made a mere telegraph, and not a political matter, and to effect this both the Russian Minister and Mr Marling consider it should be raised by the British and Russian Telegraph Departments with the Persian Telegraph Administration, the Legations not moving unle„„ it is found to be absolutely necessary. This pro cedure appears to be a sound one to adopt, if the question can be shewn to be one of telegraph administration only, and is accepted as such by the Persian Government, it would without doubt be more readily settled in the way that we wish. The British Signallers on the Seistan line belong to the Indian Telegraph Department, and this is why Mr Marling points out. that the Indo-European Telegraph Department is not directly-ect ly concerned in the transfer. H e things this need not e ctn obstacle to the Indo-European Telegraph Bepartaent acting the matter, and I thin, this may be agreed to. Th e aovern- oi India are most anxious to get the control of the Seistan line into British han^*, ' ’ hand£ ” and are l^ely to accept anv procedure that will bring this about. The line Meshed to Teheran io Kao ieheran is 568 , and the line Meshed to Seistan 5 23 miles long. The proposed arrangement is that the British should maintain the section from Khaf to Seistan only, Khaf being some 150 mil pc. + „ 4. miles distant from Meshed. Wien this comes before the Persian Government tha • lfent &gt; the inquiry seems likely to be made why the whole section is not to -so * , i-'iun is not to be taken over by the and it win be difficult to keep the political element oui of the answer, it is quite possible that the Persian Govern ment may have proposals of their own to make. However by putting the question of the transfer forward as a telegraph matter information win be obtained as to the view the Persian Govern- ner '' take ° f and U may be treated with less suspicion than ^ it had come before them from the two Legations. Mr Marling-s Proposals might therefore be accepted as put forward by him in his telegram* 9th March 1908i In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. 7969, and address — The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

Howson is being told hy me to do nothing pending receipt of your instructions# Ends# Repeated to Major Sykes.Note on Foreign Office letter no.6680 dated 4th March 1908. 3 ■ The most important point brought to notice in Mr. Marling-s despatch is that the Russian Minister at Teheran appears to think that, as the Indo-European Telegraph Compan; is under Russian protection, his Government will he satisfie, if the British rights over the Teheran Khanikin line are mad. over to the Company. If it is found that the Russian Govern- ment approve of this arrangement, it seems to me it would be good policy on our part to give every assistance towards carrying it out. The Company is one on which the British Government could apply pressure, if necessary/ hut I have found the Company always anxious to meet the wishes of Govern ment m regard to telegraph questions that have arisen in connection with Cis-Indian Joint Purse matters. I have no as0n ^ think that tnis attitude would he changed 'by any concession that the Company obtained in Persia. However an arrangement of the kind for the transfer of the line would seem to he one for the Company to settle with the Russian Government, as if any direct concern is shewn on our side, that the Company should get the concession, it may not help to promote this object, if the Russian Government propose tne arrangement we could then render assistance in carrying it out. Mr .Marling’further states that the Manager of the Indo-European Telegraph Company considers that the Company should nottake over the line from Teheran to Hamadan, hut shouldShould construct a new line from Kazvin to Hamadan, and take over the line from Hamadan to Khanekin. I do not think this arrangement is one that there need he any objection to. The company knows that any section of the line that is taken over will have to he reconstructed. The distance from Teheran to Hamadan is about 170 miles, and the distance from Kazvin to Hamadan is about 125 miles. But the Company's line irom Kazvin already runs for about 25 miles along the Kazvin- Hamadan road, so that the Company under their proposal would have to erect only about 100 miles of new line. This would be done at less cost than reconstructing 170 miles of the Persian line, and it is no doubt for this reason that the pro posai has been put forward* 5th March 1908.wmrnmm mmmrnmBZ and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

It is not, however, a point on which you should insist.

In any case Hr. Horley considers it loould be desirable to represent to the Russian Government the advantages to then of postponing vii actionFot gn Office letter, 13 February,No . 4508 . (n[n U'&lt;6 1- I think the Secretary of State may concur in the opinion that it would be more convenient to deal with the question of the exchange of the Meshed-Seistan and the Teheran Meshed lines separately from that of the transfer of the rights over the Nnanekm line. In the fonner case the proposal is one for an alteration of certain working arrangements on telegraph lines, while in the other case the question is one of the transfer of recognised rights over a line. 2. With regard to the transfer of the rights now enjoyed by Great Britain over the Teheran- Khaneism line, the exchange that took place in St. Petersburg of the memoranda, referred to\the Foreign Office letter, appears to have settled the question as between the British and Russian Governments. 3. The telegram No. 25, dated, St. Petersburg, 9th February 1908, puts forward certain proposals for approaching the Persian Government regarding the transfer of the control of the telegraph lines named therein. These proposals appear to me to be sound, except as regards raising the question at the present time of the transfer of our rights over the Khanekin line. It appears to me the objection to raising the question of the transfer oj' the Khanekin line is this. Our hold over it rests on the 1872 Telegraph Convention, which, under renewals that have been agreed to, remains in force untiluntil 1925, Bat we are about to approach the Persian Government for a further renewal up to 1945, If therefore the transfer of the line is arranged after this further renewal has been obtained, the Russians will gain control of the line till 1945 instead of 1925, which would presumably be more desirable than for the shorter period. An arrange* ment, by which the question of the transfer of the line was to remain in abeyance until the question of the renewal of the British Concess ions had been settled wi oh the Persian Goveiwnent, might possibly enlist uhe active assistance of the Russian Govern ment in our favour in the matter, seeing that they would also gam by the renewal, The delay would not be great by this course being adopted, and the advantage to the Russian Government might be considerable, 4* The telegram of the fifth February, further f asks when the Teheran-Khanekin line was made over to the Persians, and for what reason this was done. This line was originally constructed to form part of a connection between Bagdad and Teheran, It was believed that the line between Bagdad and Fao would not be allowed to work owing to the unruly state the country it passed through was in, and therefore it was necessary to provide an alternative route through Teheran and Bushire for messages between Europe and India vid Turkey. It was found, however, contrary to expectation, that the route between Fao and Bagdad worked comparatively well, thus rendering the route through Persia of little value. On the latter line the perpetual disturbances on the Turco-Turco-persian frontier, and the mutual jealousies of the Turks and Persians, interfered with communication. The Russian route to Julfa, the alternative to the Turkish route, had been improved in speed and accuracy of working, and the Julfa Teheran line had been strengthened by the introduction of a few European signallers. Finally it was thought that the concessions obtained by Messrs. Siemens, for what is now the Indo-European Company's line, would provide an efficient line between England and Teheran. Accordingly in March 1868 the Khanekin line was made over to the Persian Administration to be worked by their own officials. From that time to this it would not have paid us to rebew our control over the line, and we have not done so. 5 ' It be useful to add that on the 14th June 1906 the Persian Government signed an agreement with the Indo-European Telegraph Company that they had no objection to the Coinpany taking over the Khanekin line from the British Government, and, in the event of this being done, that the conditions for its Looming were to be settled by a Convention between the Persian Government and the Company. This shows that m 1906 the Persian Bovemment were not averse to the transfer of the British rights over the Khanekin line, and it only seems necessary for the Russian Govemmerb to obtain from the Persian Government the recognition of the transfer to them of the British rights. But as I have pointed out in a previous part of this note, it appears advisable to avoid raising the question ofOf this transfer until it is settled whether the Persian Government will renew or not the British Tel eg raph Cone ess ions. L ’ Marling's telegram, No. 41 of the 8th February 1908, he asks by whom now proposed that, Russian obligations ii ould be formally accepted, by the Indo-European Telegraph Department o? u y the Indian Telegraph Department. As the only Ime to be transferred to us is the Khaf- Nasratabad section, and, as there are three signallers of the Indian Telegraph Department employed on the section, the simplest arrangement is for that Department to take over charge of the line. xt might be stated, however, that the charge of the line might eventually be made over bo the Indo-European Telegraph Department, as it is desirable for administrative purposes that all the telegraph lines, with which the British are connected m Persia, should be in the care of the Department with its headquarters at Teheran. It would be premature to discuss the details of the arrangements to give effect to the exchange of the two lines. This can be done when the consent of the Persian Government to the exchange has been obtained.

Me Sykes, Major, Hia Britannic Majesty 1 a Consul General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan2# ?(/{— Government of India Secret Despatch, No. 16, 16th January, 1908. d - The Government of India make certain proposals as to the employment of British signallers on the Teheran-Meshed line after its transfer to Russian control. The proposals are that both Great Britain and Russia retain their signallers at Teheran and Meshed as at present . The Indo- European Telegraph Department is to transfer the termination &amp; both at Teheran and Meshed to the Russian office. The Russian office can then give the use of the wire by a cormutator to the British and Persian offices at stated times, just as is done by the British office mutatis mutandis at present. As to the working of the Khaf Seistan line after transfer to British control, the proposal is that the terminal at Seistan should be transferred to the British Office, and at the Khaf end the line from Seistan should pass through the British office and thence through the Russian office. Taking into consideration the converse case of the Teheran Meshed line, it would be difficult to claim that Russian signallers should be removed from the terminal stab ions, but the Government of India consider that as the management of the line is to be transferred to the British, with the express object of preventing friction along the Perso-Afghan frontier, Russia cannot justifiably claim to retain any signallers at intermediate stations. I understand that the British signaller at Khaf would work through to the British signaller at Meshed at statedstated times by a similar arrangement to that proposed for British working between Teheran and m Meshed. It might be useful to find out what the views of the Russian Government are on these points* I hove been told by the Indo-European Company that it is not unlikely the Company will be asked by the Russian Government to undertake the working of the 1 eh eran-Me shed line after its transfer. As the Indo-European Telegraph Company is one on which the British Government can put pressure, if necessary, its taking cnarge of the line does not appear to be against British interests, but rather in their favour. R* It would appeario be premature at present to deal with the proposals of the Government of India. This can be done, if necessary, when the result is known of the application about to be made for the formal transfer. l$th February, 1908.2 n? ^ In any farther communica tion on this subject, please quote no. 5051. ) I and address— The Uftder-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

To The Right Hon’ble JOHN MORLEY, O.M., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Port William, the 16th January 1908. Sir, We have the honour to address you on the subject of the arrangement signed by Sir A. Nicholson and M. Isvolsky on 31st August 1907, respecting the telegraph lines between Meshed-Seistan and Meshed-Tehran. In his telegram to the Foreign Office, London, No/301, dated the 21st October 1907, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran, reported that the Russian Minister at Tehran had informed his Government that he considered the present moment unsuitable for approaching the Persian Government regarding the telegraph line agreement. Mr. Marling concurred in this view. As it seems likely that no favourable opportunity will present itself at an early date for giving formal effect to the arrangement that has been decided on, we would suggest for your consideration that the object aimed at in the understanding might be sufficiently secured if Great Britain and Russia transferred informally to one another the control which they now exercise respectively over the two lines in question. The transfer could be effected in each case by the withdrawal of the employes of one Power and the substitution of a similar number of employes of the other Power in lieu of them, as we shall attempt to show in the following paragraphs. 2. The Tehran-Meshed line. —Information regarding our present control over the Tehran-Meshed line is given in the letter from the India Office to the Foreign Office, dated the 14th October 1906, and in the extract from the ^'Meshed*Diary for the 8th'September 1906, of which a copy is enclosed for facility of reference. It will be seen that the arrangement is quite an informal one, which grew out of the measures found temporarily necessary in 1885 to secure rapid communication between Sir W est-Ridgeway’s Boundary Commission in Afghanistan and the Government of India. The Indo-European Telegraph Department spend annually on repairs a sum not exceeding Rs. 20,000 : while the Persian Government contributes krans 15,000 for the same purpose. The line guards are paid by the Persian Government, except for a contribution from the2 Tndian Government of Vrans 200 per mensem to tlie pay of 20 Glmlams, and the SS&amp;Z&amp;r** “rr RS the Persian Goveinm , managed by the Department, British Telegraph Ministry.

There need apparently he no formal reference to the Persian Government about this. The Indo-European telegraph Department could continue to receive krans 15,000 per annum f roL the Persian Government; and could pay it over privately to the Russian Government. The Department could withdraw their Assistant Superintendent ; and allow his place to be taken by Russian. (6) Signallers and line guards.-lhe signallers at mte^ediate stations V and line guards would remain Persians and would be podby t Persian Government as at present, but Russia instead of Great Britain would have to contribute krans 2 () 0 per mensem to the pay of the ehulams. Both Great Britain and Russia would retain their own signallers at Tehran and Meshed, as at present. ((f) Termination of line.—The Indo-European Telegraph Department ( could transfer the termination both at Tehran and Meshed to the Russian office. The Russian office could then give the wire &gt;y a commutator to the Persian and British offices at stated times, iust as is done by the British office mutandis at present. It would seem unnecessary to consult the Persian Goyernmen about this, and it could probably be done without attracting much attention. Id) Administrative control, excepting repairs.— TXxh would remam ^ under the Persian Telegraph Ministry, as at present (mde Meshed Diary already quoted). 4. The Meshed-Seistan line.—The Russian arrangements regardmg this - , re indicated to some extent in Sir A. Nicholson’s telegram No. 201, dated the ' ’ 21st September 1907, to Sir E. Grey and Ins despatch No. 1906, September 1907 ; and also in the Meshed Diary of the bth September iy , already quoted. Revairs .—Russian superintendence was only tacitly accorded y the Persian Government, and is for no fixed term. Ine me the property of the Persian Government. It appears Irom on Consul’s reports that the Russian Kniaz Yavchadze practica y controls the line ; but there is no very definite account ot the system, or of the number of employes. The Meshed ^iary st that repairs are carried out under the supervision ol the RussianKmaz Yavchadze, but it is believed that the cost is defrayed by the Persian Government by means of orders in favour of Russian telegraph officials on the Local Governors of Seistan and Kain Hie inspecting and repairing establishment employed by Russia m September 1906 was 3 Inspectors, 2 Sub-Inspectors, 4 clerks and 1 mechanic. * (b) Signallers and line guards.—Ihe line guards are paid by the Persian Government. Their number is unknown As to the signallers, there are Persian, British, and Russian signallers, both at the terminals and at intermediate stations. The precise number and distribution of the British and Russian signallers at the time of the signature of the Convention is reported to have been as follows :— BriUsh —l with His Majesty’s Consul, Seistan, in camp ; 1 at Nasrata- bad, 1 at Birjand Russian —Shusp, 1 Inspector ^on leave but has since returned); Khaf, 1 Inspector, 1 Sub-Inspector; Nasratabad, 1 Sub-Inspector, 1 signaller; Birjand, 1 signaller whose post was then temporarily vacant, but has since been filled. (n) Termination of line.— Both at Meshed and Seistan the line now terminates in Russian offices. (d) Administrative control, excepting repairs .—This is nominally under the Persian Telegraph Ministry {vide Meshed Diary of the 8th September 1906) ; but seems latterly to have fallen into the hands of the Russian “ Kniaz ”, 5. Regarding this line, the following steps seem necessary to give the British the same degree of control below Khaf which the Russians at present possess : (a) Repairs .—The Russians could instruct the “ Kniaz ” to withdraw from all interference south of Khaf, and also to withdraw his Inspectors, Sub-Inspectors, clerks, and mechanics from that portion of the line. The present British signallers with some assistants could then take their place. jNo formal reference to the Persian Government would apparently be needed: but it would pro bably be hard to arrange at present that the Persian Government should pay for repairs, as it now does, and the British Govern ment would have to bear this charge, pending further arrange ments. (5) Signallers and line guards .—As in the converse case of the Tehran- Meshed line, it would be difficult to claim that Russian signallers should be removed from the terminal stations; but it would seem that, as the management of the line is to be transferred to the British, and with the express object of preventing friction along the Perso-Afghan frontier, Russia cannot justifiably claim to retain any signallers at intermediate stations. (c) Termination of line .—The terminal at Seistan could be transferred to the British offices without reference to the Persian Govern ment in the same manner as control was taken over by the Russians; and at the Khaf end it might be arranged that the line from Seistan should pass through a British office and thence through a Russian office. 6. Recent reports received since the conclusion of the Agreement regarding Persia show that Russian control is now being still further extended over the Meshed-Seistan telegraph line; and as we consider it to be greatly to our interest that this control should cease at an early date, we{ ... -U r^ncQi’hlp to brinsj into force without delay the ttnder^anding I1 ^^a,rdmg the ^exchange of telegraph lines by the adoption of measures such as we have indicated above.

This is, in fact, the change made by the Russian Telegraph Inspector without authority in June last, and which was reversed at the instance of this Consulate-General. In order to communicate with seistan and intermediate places, it will now be necessary for the Persian— and through it the British-office to work through the Russian commutator. Ihe Russian office in Meshed has thus an identical position on the Seistan line with that of our Meshed office on the Tehran line. As it is understood that the Russians are claiming for themselves the same privileges throughout on the Seistan line, ns we enjoy on the Tehran line, I give below a brief statement, in parallel columns, showing what the latter privileges are, and also those now enjoyed by the Russians on the Seistan line Maintenance.

Control. At Tehran and Meshed ends, wire is taken into British office first, and given, through the commutator, to the Persian office, and through it to the Russian office. Under the recent concession, Rus sians control the wire at the Meshed end.2 Hi Ir ill IIP ! l ? ' i ; ‘ Receipts. Receipts for all classes of messages on both lines are paid into Persian Telegraph Ministry. Although time-tables exist on both lines governing the use of the wires by the different offices, they are not always adhered to, other arrangements, as may he mutually convenient, being made in their place. It should be noted that lor six hours daily Meshed is cut off (at Shahrud) from Tehran, while tlm latter place is in communication with Astrabad. The only privileges which the Russians seem now to lack on the Seistan line to make their position equal to ours on the Tehran line is that of paying for its maintenance and the control ol the wire at the Seistan end. The former they will perhaps not insist on very strenuously hut it may be anticipated that efforts will be made to secure the latter. It is difficult to say, until the full scope of the concession is known, how it will affect us as regards telegraphic communication with Seistan and intermediate places. It seems unlikely that any immediate inconvenience will he caused, though it cannot be forgotten that the Russians now have it m their power to interrupt communications when a sufficiently important occasion arisesf There is also the possibility of our messages being tapped. To be done without detection, this requires special instruments and more technical know ledge than is possessed by anyone in the Russian office, but there is of course no assurance that this state of affairs will continue. The chief objection to the surrender by the Persian Government of their rights on the line probably lies in the use the Russians may make of it in increasing the number ot their agents along the line and in similar ways. In this connection may be men tioned the recent report of a projected line from Pul-i-Khatun to Khaf. There is also the great impulse given to their political influence by the acquisition ot this important concession in a quarter where our interests predominate. Our interests, on the other hand, on the Tehran-Meshed line, over which we at present possess exclusive privileges, are probably less than those of the Russians; and the question consequently suggests itself whether—after a quia pro quo in the shape of the Robat extension has been secured—it would not be advisable to endeavour to effect an exchange.Letter from the Foreign Office to the India Office, London, No. 5051, dated the 15th February 1908.

British signallers at Tehran and Meshed. Russians have for many years maintained their own employes on Meshed-Tehran line, which we controlled without any noticeable disadvantage to us. If our men be withdrawn from Tehran, Meshed and Turbat-i-Haidari, communications for all Consulates will be much weakened and cypher work will he most difficult to transact. Perhaps it is not fully realised that when I was at Kerman I was unable to send cyphers until the arrival of a British telegraphist. If it is the intention of Russia to observe convention there is in my opinion less objection to Russian signallers at Seistan than to the isolation of our Consulates and Agencies. I fully concur in Seistan telegram No. 106 C. Owing to Persian incapacity, I also think that Russians will consider retention of telegraphists by both Powers as reasonable if not necessary.

Please see your telegram S.—217, dated the 12 th April 1908. Withdrawal of Russian signallers from Seistan-Khaf section would be desirable, but if this can only be secured by withdrawal of British signallers from Meshed and Tehran, it would, in my opinion, he preferable that Russian signallers should remain; otherwise Meshed and Turbat-i-Haidari would be entirely dependent on Persian signal lers. The linking up of Seistan with Central Persian line would not improve matters as regards Meshed and Turbat-i-Haidari, as our control would only commence at Khaf.40 The presence of Russian signallers would not be a serious evil, provided that after exchange has taken place, Russian privileges on the Seistan line are strictly limited to those we have now, and we, on the other hand, are put m full possession of their rights. I would point out that our position on the Tehran-Meshed line is now to some extent prejudiced by the signaller at Tehran being subject to Indo- European Department rules and not Government employe like those on 1 1 Meshed-Seistan line, vide my diary* of * secret f., April 1907 , Nos. 1 - 89 . ggth January 1907.

The incident is explained as follows by the Russian Minis ter The Russian Consul-General, Meshed, recently informed him that it was neees-, sary that certain materials for up-keep and improvement ot line should be sup- nlied The answer sent by him was that sufficient should be sent for Meshed-Khaf section only On receipt of this instruction the telegraph head-quarters, Tiflis, asked why the line south of Khaf was not to he supplied. The answer sent by5 the Minister was that it was for political considerations which would be explained in due course to the Telegraph Administration. It was pointed out by the latter that repairs were required by the southern section, and that communication might be interrupted if these were not done. It is presumed by the Minister that new instrument has been sent, perhaps in spite of his ^ orders, as part of the alleged repairing material. The case has been reported “ to St. Petersburg by him. The agreement for exchange of lines has not been communicated, he says, to Russian Consuls. I presume that all Russian employes are to be withdrawn when the exchange is effected, and that signal lers attached to Consulates will not be maintained, as is at present done by us, by Russia. It would perhaps be desirable that the acquisition of the special room should be permitted, if the above is clearly agreed on with Russian Government.

It will be necessary for us to raise the question of prolongation of our concessions whenever the question of Tehran-Khanikin line is raised, and we think it would be therefore preferable to deal first with the exchange of Meshed-Tehran and Khaf-Seistan lines, as there may be some difficulty about the concessions. If necessary, you should explain to the .Russian Government that they are of course under no obligation to postpone action with regard to Tehran-Khani kin line, but that if the two transactions are not simultaneous, criticism may be expected here. You should, however, not insist on the point. Moreover, Russian Government would benefit by obtaining control until 1945 instead of 1925, if the prolongation of the Khanikin concession were effected before, or simultaneously with, transfer of our rights over it. I am sending by bag a memorandum on the subject. Bnds.No. 50-C., dated Seistan, the 23rd February 1908 (Confidential). From— Major R. L. Kennion, I.A., His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Seistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Grovernment of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honor to request a reference to the Government of India’s Despatch No. 16, dated 16th January 1908, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India on the subject of the telegraph lines from Meshed to Tehran and Seistan. 2. In the 4th paragraph of the above cited paper, it is mentioned that the Government of India are in possession of no very definite information regard ing the system and number of employees on the Khaf-Seistan Section. I submit in this connection a* copy of a note recorded by Mr. Hoys' son, Sub- Assistant Superintendent of Telegraphs, which I trust will be found to supply the details required. 8 . It will be noted that the list of the Russian staff on the line given in Mr. Marling’s Confidential Despatch No. 250, dnted 2nd December 1907, is correct, with the exception of the inclusion of the Mechanic Constantinow, who worked on the Meshed-Seh Deh section, and who has since been with drawn. 4. As regards the cost of upkeep, the enquiries I have made elicit the fact that no money is handed oyer by the local Governors of Seistan and Kain for this purpose. The Director of Customs, Seistan, has also told me that no money is paid from Customs revenues. The ghulams, and line staff are, it seems, paid direct by the Russians; and if the latter are reimbursed at all, it is probably from telegraph receipts at Meshed or Tehran. It may be noted that the ghulams on the Southern Section of the line have recently been complain ing of not having received their pay. The inference may perhaps be drawn that the Russians, having failed to obtain reimbursement of sums previously spent on this account,, and in view of their connection with the line being severed, have discontinued payment. 5 . The following are suggestions as to action which it will be necessary to take when the line is handed over to us :— (a) At Nasratabad, Seistan, there are three rooms in the same Tele graph building, set apart for the Persian, Russian and British offices. At the present time, the British office is only used for the storage of material, our signaller doing his work in the Persian office. The line goes first to the Russian office whence it is given to the Persian office by means of a commutator. The steps to be taken will be to remove the present terminal pole to outside the British office and to so connect the wires as to place the control of the line in our hands instead of as at present in the hands of the Russians. Or else—and this would he prefer able as attracting less attention—for ourselves and the Russians to exchange rooms. (5) At Birjand, British, Russian and Persian signallers have hitherto worked in the same office. If this arrangement continues, no alteration of the wire will be necessary, though when occasion offers, an endeavour should he made to obtain the use of a separate room and so to arrange the wire as to give our signaller the control of the line. If however, in the meantime, the Russians succeed in obtaining a separate room for their tape instrument, either with or without the control of the line, we should I presume expect them to transfer the privilege to us on the agree ment being brought into effect.&lt; o • '2 &lt; « Telegram No. 240, dated the 21st (received the 22nd) October 1907. ! r ° m ^ C “• MA, ' USG ’ Esq ” HiS Brita,m!o Ma i est y’ s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran, To—The.

There were also three other Russian employes on the line north of Khaf. Major Kennion, in his report, expressed the opinion that, when the line comes under our control, if one of the three signallers we now have were made an inspector, the only necessary addition to our staff would be a signaller at Khaf. This would make four British employes in all, or one more, to judge from the statement made by the Acting Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs to Sir A. Nicolson on the 3rd (16th) September, than appears desirable in Russian eyes (see Sir A. Nicolson’s despatch No. 487 of the 21st September). Possibly the incident is not of very material importance, but it is instructive as showing that Russia is not likely to give away many points in the game by any quixotic honesty.

After an exhaustive examination of this question, it has been decided on the one hand, that the first of these lines, which lies entirely within the re°lon in which _ Russia is interested, shall pass within the competence of the Russian administration on the same conditions on which it lies at present within the competence o the British administration; on the other hand, seeing that a part of the Meshed- Seistan telegra.ph crosses the above-mentioned region, it has been decided that this ^if 6 !! f 3 •, l , e - dl Y lded mto sections at Khaf, that the section to the north of this point shall he within the competence of the Russian administration, and that to the south ot the same point within that of the British administration.

Isvolsky the text of which I transmit to you herewith.^ J ’ In concluding this Arrangement the two Governments cannot lose sight of the fact that the lines in question are the property of the Persian Government, and that the rights which they possess over those lines are only granted by that Government It is therefore necessary to obtain the consent of the Government of His Majesty the Shah to the carrying out of the measures contemplated by the Agreement in question in consequence of which an Article dealing with this point has been inserted in the text of the Arrangement. I have therefore to request you to confer with your Russian colleague, who has been furnished with identical instructions, in order to decide by mutual agreement on the steps which it will be necessary to take in order to obtain from the Persian Government the required consent, and to take these steps as soon as the moment appears favourable for doing so. You should inform me in due course of any action which you may take in accordance with these instructions. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) E. GREY. * Arrangement of August 31, 1907.

I asked Russian Minister yesterday a ho at personal loan of 150,000 tomans to the Shall,_ and observed that, in my opinion, the transaction, if it became known, would infallibly be insinuated here as implying an intention to support Shah against the -‘'yembly, and would injure rather than assist His Majesty. He replied that there was no possible reason why Russian Bank should refuse a personal loan to Shah, which would he readily granted on similar security to anv one else. The Shah really requires the money to meet heavy Court expenses He did not care what effect on public opinion was. He would do nothing to prevent loan, and was ready to avow whole transaction. Russia had formal engagements to maintain Kajar dynasty which she could not disregard. Strict abstention from interference in internal affairs was very well in theory, hut it could he pushed too far so that it really favoured one party, and he meant to stop short of that point. _ He spoke with considerable vehemence, like a man trying to persuade himself against his better judgment. I said I must adhere to my views as to had results of proposed loan, and that I could not abandon our present attitude of strict non-interference. Russian Minister continued that relations with Persian Government were becoming impossible. The Ministers were timid and incompetent, and no business could he done except after discussion in the Assembly which did not in the least understand that Persia, owing to existence of capitulations, &amp;c., was not as other nations. The President of Assembly, he asserted, was moreover much under German influence, evidence of which was apparent in many places, and it was practically the President who dominates the situation. It was time to give the Assembly a sharp check, and to try to counter German influence. If you decide to make representations at St. Petersburg!! may I suggest that they should appear as initiated solely from London. Otherwise Russian Ministers reticence may he increased and my relations with him may suffer.V o In any further eommuniea* tion on this subject, please quot« ■-&gt;■ 32^3 3 and address— The Under-Secretary of Stats, Foreign Office, London.

I J n/r r ^ l ® nour transmit copy of an aide-memoire which I com- mnnu ate to M. Isvolsky on the 27th instant, and in which I gave his Excellency the information as to the Tehran-Meshed and the Tehran-Khanikin telegraph lines as communicated to me in your telegram No. 162 of the 27th instant. I to-day added the information in an aide-memoire as to British signallers being at the Tehran and the Meshed offices. M. Isvolsky has not made any remarks on the subject, and I did not think it necessary that 1 should write any. In respect to the question of an exchange of notes on the subject of the exchange of the telegraph lines, I conveyed to-day to M. Isvolsky your opinion that it would be preferable to have an exchange of notes than to embody the Arrangement as an annex which would have to be published with the Convention. This latter mode of procedure would doubtless offend Persian susceptibilities, and it would consequently be advisable to defer publication until the consent of the Persian Government had been obtained. His Excellency said that he entirely shared your views on the point; but he thought it would be a little clumsy incorporating the Arrangement into a note. After some discussion with an expert official of his Department and between ourselves, it seemed to be best to preserve the form of the annex, but to treat it as a document perfectly distinct and separate from the Convention, and to entitle it an Arrangement, Both M. Isvolsky and myself would sign the document, which would not be published until the consent of the Persian Government had been obtained. A sentence to the following effect was added : “ Les Gouvernements de Russie et de la Grande-Bretagne chargeront leurs Representants a Teheran de faire conjointement des demarches aupres du Gouvernement Persan a Peffet d’obtenir le consentement de celui-ci aux mesures indiquees ci-dessus.” I trust you will approve this solution. I also handed to M. Isvolsky to-day a short aide-memoire acknowledging the receipt of his aide-memoire, copy of which is transmitted in my despatch N(£ 428 of the 2l 0 26th instant, and stating that His Majesty’s Embassy had much pleasure in taking note of the contents of his communication in respect to the prolongation of certain British Telegraph Concessions.

HIS Majesty’s Embassy did not fail to communicate to His Majesty’s Government the wish of the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs, as expressed in its aide-memoire of the 29th duly (11th August), 1907, to be supplied with some data m regard to the Tehran-Meshed and Tehran-Khanikin telegraph lines. His Majesty’s Embassy received this morning the desired information, and hasten to communicate it to the Imperial Ministry for 1 oreign Affairs. . The Tehran-Meshed telegraph line is the property of the Persian lelegraph Administration and is worked by that Administration, and His ajesty s overnrnen have no knowledge of the cost of administration or of the amount of revenue, in 1885, owing to repeated and prolonged interruptions, the Persian Government allowed the maintenance of the line to be taken over by the Indo-European Department as a temporary measure. The telegraph line was put m order by the Indo-European Department, and its maintenance has remained, in the hands of the Demrtment ever since ; but the arrangement could be terminated at any moment either by His Majesty s [2633 c—17]Government or by the Persian Government, as there is no formal Agreement Exclusive of a contribution of 15,000 krans per annum by the Persian Government, the mainte nance of the line costs about 12,000 rupees per annum. . , . , , A ^ .

Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received February 18.) (No. 84.) Sh% St. Petersburgh, February 12, 1907. AT my interview to-day with M. Isvolsky I communicated to him an aide-me'moire in regard to the telegraph lines in Persia, of which I have the honour to transmit a copy herewith. I explained to his Excellency that my Government were of opinion that it would entail a considerable expense to place additional wires on the existing lines, and that the objects which we both had in view would be equally well and more economically obtained by one of the two alternatives I had communicated in the aide-me'moire. He had in his aide-me'moire expressed the willingness of the Russian Government not to oppose a request which might be made by the British Government for a special line from Nasratabad to Kouhi-Melik-Siah. In the aide-me'moire I now communicated he would observe that it was suggested that the Russian Government should go a step farther and support any such request. It seemed to me it would be well at this, moment if this farther step could be taken, should we apply for it, as all that tended to joint action was always to the good. M. Isvolsky said that he would look into the whole matter and let me have a reply later. He gave no indication of being opposed to our proposals, but I told him I did not wish to extort any opinion from him until he had studied the paper I left with him. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. NICOLSON. Inclosure in No. 1. Aide-me'moire communicated by Sir A. Nicolson to M. Isvolsky. HIS Majesty’s Embassy had the honour to receive the aide-me'moire communicated by the Imperial Russian Government on the 17th (30th) November, 1906, regarding an arrangement to be made with respect to the telegraph lines between Tehran and Meshed, and between Meshed and Nasratabad. His Majesty’s Embassy is now in a position to make certain proposals which it trusts will commend themselves to the Imperial Russian Government as affording a temporary modus vivendi pending a general settlement of questions connected with Persia. His Majesty’s Embassy, with a view of avoiding the considerable expense which would be entailed by placing additional wires on the lines, as was suggested in the aide- memoire of the Imperial Russian Government, would propose :— 1. That neutral or rather combined offices should be established at all stations, both terminal and intermediate, where Russian and British signallers are employed, or, as an alternative, separate offices, belonging to each Power, with a commutator in a separate shed accessible to both parties ; and that signallers of each Power should have for certain fixed hours in each day uninterrupted possession of the offices and lines. 2. That, as proposed in the aide-me'moire of the Imperial Russian Government, the Russian Inspectors on the Meshed-Nasratabad line will be withdrawn and replaced by Gholams or subaltern Persian agents, who will be paid by the Imperial Russian Government. 3. That the Imperial Russian Government would support a request to the Persian -Government on the part of the British Government for permission to establish a special line between Nasratabad and Kouhi-Melik-Siah.

The situation as regards the Bussian request for a separate room (vide diary, 18th Pebruary) is briefly as follows:—The Russian Doctor asked the 2Telegraph S.irtip at Birjand for a separate room and for certain improvements for this room, including white-washing and the fixing of doors and windows. A proposal was also, it seems, put forward that the line should be taken first to the diussian room as at Seistan. The request was transmitted by the* Telegraph Sartip to Meshed, with the result that he received orders not to allow the line to be taken through the Russian room, but sanctioning Tomans 20 on account of repairs, presumably for the new room. So far °the tape instrument has n^t arrived and no attempt has been made to put a separate room for the Russians in Order. ’ * * * * * # * * Extract from Confidential Diary of Major E. L.

Monday, 16th March.—The Telegraph Sartip at Birjand has sent a telegram to Sardar Mansur, in which he states that the room wanted for the Russian telegraphist, for the repairs of which Tomans 20 had been sanctioned (diary, 14th March), was a ditt'erent room to that used by the Persian signaller. He goes on to explain that the owner of the house, the lease of which had expired, now wishes to raise the rent from Tomans 2 to Tomans 5 per mensem. The Sartip asked sanction to rent the building for Tomans 3 per mensem and to carry out the repairs after the lease had been signed. It may be noted that all the telegraph offices on the Seistan-Khaf line are rented from private individuals except those at Seistan, Bandan and Shusp.

Following sent to Foreign Office, London, and repeated to St. Petersburgh : Begins. No. 91. Director, Indo-European Telegraph Department, is bein» pressed by Persian Government to erect a second wire between Tehran and Shahrud, but in view of contemplated exchange, Director has instruction from London not to act without special authorisation. We might take the opportunity to effect exchange, but for this purpose Director requires authority to take over Khaf-Seistan section with all existing Russian obli gations. Russian Minister regards it as a favourable opportunity, as the repairs on this line could then be done by us. We might leave for later settlement the question of maintenance of Russian signallers. It might be arranged that they shall only be retained where there is a Russian Consul and of course at Khaf ; and we might retain our signallers at Tehran and Meshed. Ends.

It appears probable that the Russian Government will altogether object to the presence in their zone of British signallers, and they will certainly make retention of signallers at Nasratabad condition of agreeing to retention of British signallers at Tehran and Meshed. In these circum stances, it seems best not to press for retention of British signallers at Tehran 3&lt;% y ancl'Meshed. What are your views ? Presence of Russian signallers in British zone and vice versa will tend to frustrate objects of pohcy arrived at by exchano-e of lines, especially in the event of Khaf-Nasratabad line being here- after Unked up with Central Persian line. Possible delays &amp;c., consequent upon withdrawal of our signallers from Tehran and Meshed seem a lesser evil than presence of Russian signallers in our zone.

Reply has been received to our proposals from Russian Government who accept on Meshed-Tehxan line after transfer admission of British employes on terms enjoyed by Russian employes under existing arrangements. On Meshed-Seistan line they propose that British employes should have access to line on section north of Khaf and Russian similar access on section south of Khaf. Nature of Russian proposal which is not limited to request for signaller at Nasratabad strengthens my colleague’s opinion of the arguments in° favour of a settlement on the basis of there being no signaller of either Power in the zone of the other. No. 31 C., dated Meshed, the 19th March 1908 (Confidential). From- -Major P. M. Sykes, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of my telegramSvo. 29 C , dated 14th March 1908, I have the honour to give the information therein contained at greater length. 2. The Director of Persian Telegraphs for Khorasan informed me that he pays the salaries of the Persian Telegraph officials, but practically nothing else. As to rent, the Russians pay for th? offices at Turbat, Khaf, Birjand, Neb and Seistan. Also, he believes, for the rent of the Telegraph Office at Seilbad between Neh and Birjand. The wages of the ghulams, the cost of repairs to the line, &amp;c., &amp;c., are all paid from Russian funds.P 1 \ 35 3. The Russians do not receive this money back: but pay small lump sums on account of messages sent by them. They, however, submit no accounts and decline to do so. The Persian Director of Telegraphs considers that they do not pay the full amounts due by them. 4. This arrangement, according to my informant, was made with the Sipahdar, who, in return for the free unkeep of the line, allowed the Russians to control it. I think that this information, added to that previously given by His Majesty’s Consul, Seistan, and by this Consulate-General, completes our knowledge of the actual situation. 4 5. With reference to Major Kennion’s letter No. 50 C. of 23rd February 1908 a reference is made to the question of Khaf in paragraph 5 Personally, my experience of Russian officials does not lead me to suppose that they will hand over the line and offices as entirely as we could wish. They will, in my opinion, try to retain a strong footing in Seistan, at Birjand and possibly at Khaf. Under these circumstances, I am inclined to recommend that Khaf, which is on the Afghan frontier, should be occupied by a British signaller. 6 . With reference to the suggestion that the Khaf-Seistan section should be controlled by His Majesty’s Consul for Seistan, I am afraid that I cannot fully agree with Major Kennion. When the question of Kain was raised, I pointed out that, so long as Meshed was the capital of Khorasan, it would be inadvisable to ignore that it is the head-quarters and residence of the chief officials. To apply this point of view to the telegraph line, Jalil Mirza controls all his subordinates in Khorasan, selling every post at his will. Consequently, in my opinion, the official in charge of the Khaf-Seistan line should have his head-quarters at Meshed and should inspect the line twice a year, marching to Seistan in the autumn and returning to Meshed in the late spring. Any other arrangement wmuld appear to me to be most undesirable, as the numerous delicate questions which are bound to arise could not, I fear, be settled by an official having his head-quarters away from the capital. In fact, they would probably have to be settled by this Consulate-General and the Persian Director-General. 7. In conclusion, the settlement of this question will, as Major Kennion states, depend on the general consular arrangements in Eastern Persia : but so long as Meshed is the capital of the province, the control of telegraph lines, quarantine cordons and the Afghan frontier cannot, I am firmly convinced, be divided without considerable damage to the interests we are paid to protect. 8 . Copies of this letter are being sent to His Majesty’s Legation and to His Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain. \ Telegram, No. 45 C., dated and received 15th April 1908. From Major P. M.

The senior permanent Persian telegraph official at Meshed has shown Attache accounts which corroborate accurately the Seistan telegram. The Persians pay rent, but according to my informant the money is re funded to the Sipadar by the Russians. This information is independently corroborated by two other Persian officials. Ends.
