Will you please refer to Edwards* letter Wo.D.1077-H/ 32 of the 28th June forwarding an O.B.E. for the Shaikh of Debai• This came as a great s.urprise to me, for the Shaikh of Debai* a name had not appeared in the New dear’s Gazette. Actually what happened was that I put his name up for an O.B.E. last autumn. In December last I received Foreign and Political Department demi-official lelegram -W0.2995-S, suggesting that pending result of air route negotiations the honour proposed for Shaikh of Debai should be held up. I replied that in view of the Shaihh*s past and present helpful attitude I thought it might stand. I admit that this was a mistake. The Shaikh had been very helpful on several occasions in the past and when I first went and asked him for facilities for the air route, he was very conciliatory and gave me to understand that there would not be much difficulty about the matter, but said that he must be given some time to square his relations. I was therefore, I am afraid, unduly optimistic, and had every hope of getting the matter settled. Subsequently, the Shaikh fell seriously ill, which allowed the opposition time to gather force and, as you know, he ultimately declined to give the required facilities. When I found that his name had not appeared in the Gazette, I was rather relieved and thought no more about the matter. Now, however, I have received an O.B.E. for him, and so do not know quite what has happened: either his name was erroneously omitted from/ H * A * F .Met calf e,Esq. ,C.I.E« ,M«V .0., Officiating Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla.

My dear Fowls, Will you please refer to Biscoe’s confidential demi- official letter H0.476-S, dated the 11th July 1932, about the O.3.E. for the Shaikh of Debai. 2. The grant of an honorary O.B.E. (Civil Division) to the Shaikh waa notified in the London Gazette under Foreign Office Notification No. T 16092/5/372, dated the 30th Decemher 1931; and it waa aaaumed that thia Notification would be brought to the Political Keaident's notice. Honorary awards of thia kind are not as a general rule notified in the Gazette of India; and the usual procedure was followed in this case. 3. It is unfortunate that the Resident should nave remained in ignorance of the grant of the honorary award; and the Governmem of India regret that no special intimation was sent to him. rhe reason for the omission to do so was that special intimation of the grant of 'English honour8 n is never sent to recommending authorities, as it is considered that the formal Gazette Notili- cation is sufficient intimation for all concerned. Instructions have now been issued to ensure that in future special i nt ima * on is sent to the recommending authority in cases in which the award is to be notified in the London Gazette only and not in the Gazette of India. 4. As the award has been formally notified in the London Gazette, I am afraid that it is impossible to withdraw it now; and the Insignia and Grant of Dignity will have to be presented, even though the award may now appear inopportune.

Subject.— Silver Jubilee MedaL Sir, I am directed to inform you that His Majesty the King Emperor has decided to institute a me dal, which is to be known as the King’s Silver Jubilee Medal, to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary “of His Majesty’s accession to the Throne. The medal, which will be in silver, will bear on the obverse portraits of the King and Queen, and on the reverse the Royal Cypher with the Imperial Crown and the dates of His Majesty’s accession and Silver Jubilee. It will be worn on a ribbon of red and blue, with two white stripes in the same way as a coronation or military medal. 657(C) F&amp;PDr mmm 2 2. The medal will be distributed as a personal souvenir from His Majesty to selected recipients, who for the most part, will be members ot t e Services in England and persons holding similar positions throug ou e Empire. The main criterion will be distinguished public service during His Majesty’s reign and not, as was the rule in the case of some other commemo rative medals, presence at, or participation in, a particular ceremony. e medal will therefore mostly be awarded to persons in the service ot (govern ment, or to persons who have actively assisted in the conduct of the adminis tration. It will also be awarded to persons who, though they have not direct y participated in the work of Government, are suitable representatives ot their profession or calling and have attained distinction in the exercise ot it ; an to persons notable for their charitable and philanthropic work. 3. Special consideration has been given to the position of ladies. It is His Majesty’s express desire that the medal should be awarded to ladies both on account of their own public service and, in a limited number ot suitable cases, on account of the services of their husbands. 1 he libbon for the medal when awarded to ladies will be issued in the form of a bow. When ladies have already received medals worn on a bar, it will be permissible for them at their own option to wear the Jubilee Medal on the medal bai. 4 . 30,000 medals are to be distributed in India^ including distribution to all armecTTbrces of the Crown serving in India. The distribution of the Coronation Durbar Medal of 1911 was about 26,000. 5. His Excellency the Viceroy desires that the following principles also should be observed in the distribution of the medal: ( 1 ) No medal is to be given under any circumstances to any person in a menial position. (2) The medal should only be given to ladies whose position or public servi ces are! )! the highest order. No medal should be given to any lady without the Viceroy’s express sanction. ( 3 ) No medal is to be given to any person whose loyalty is not unimpeachable. (4) The medal should be given to officials distinguished by their 'Responsible position and good work, and to non-officials dis tinguished by their loyalty, influence, public spirit or philanthropy. ( 5 ) A nominal roll should be maintained of all persons to whom medals are coven 5 and care should be taken that the act ual presentation is made in each case in a proper and formal manner. ( 6 ) The attention of Local Governments will be invited to the desir ability of considering the claims of members of the Central Legislatures from their provinces and of members of their own Legislative Councils, to receive the medal as eminent citizens or public workers. ( 7 ) It is assumed that Local Governments and Political Officers will not overlook members of Central Departments who happen to be serving in their provinces, or under their control. 6 The Viceroy desires that a number of medals should be distributed to Rulers of Indian States and to their nobles and officials. It is proposed therefore that it should be given to all the Rulers in your Agency including minors, with the exception of those Rulers who owing to their own short comings are not carrying on the administration of their St Tes. It is realised that in some agencies distribution to rulers should not be made below a certain level, and that having regard to the scale of distribution, certain petty chiefs, especially Shareholder Chiefs of Estates in Western India and the Gujarat States, should be excluded. It is left to the Political Officers con cerned to decide where the line should be drawn. Distribution to the nobles and officials of Indian States will be made on the following lines. ^An allot ment will be fixed for each State, and the Ruler will be informed of the principles on which the medal is being distributed and asked to say to whomhe would desire that the medal should be given in his State. The Political Officer should obtain from each Ruler a nominal roll of such persons, and will no doubt be able to obtain a revision of the list in cases where obviously unsuitable names are suggested. The number of medals, allotted to the State will then be sent to the Ruler, who should be asked to present them in a formal manner, if possible during the Jubilee Celebrations in his State. | The medals for each KuTer will be sent by the Political Officer concerned to : him separately. They should be sent under cover of a demi-official lefter and not with a kharita. The medals for Their Highnesses the Maharajas of Bikaner, Patiala and Kashmir will be sent by His Excellency the Commanderdn-Chief to them as A.-D.-Cs. to His Majesty. 7. The distribution of the medal to ladies will be on a very small scale. In England the principles of distribution to ladies will be interpreted to include the wives of Cabinet Ministers, and probably the wives of Junior Ministers and wives and widows of ex-Cabinet Ministers who have held office during the King’s reign. The Viceroy desires that the medal should be given to present or past Maharanis Regent and to Maharanis who are holders of the Crown of India. These medals should be sent with a letter from the Political Officer to the Ruler or the Maharani concerned, as may be the usual custom. It is not intended that the medal should be given to other Maharanis, Ranis or Begums by virtue of their position. Moreover, distribution to ladies by virtue of their position wdll not be made to ladies whose husbands rank below Article ST in the Warrant of Precedence, and therefore your recommendations will He confined to the few cases of ladies whose philanthropic or other services are of an outstanding nature. 8. In an appendix to this letter is shown the allotments proposed for the States. They are prepared on the basis of gun salutes and will therefore for this purpose contain anomalies. For instance the size and importance of certain non-salute States may be held to entitle them to receive more than the one medal allotted to them; and distribution on the provisional scale to small States with a large gun-Salute may be excessive. It is therefore left to Political Officers to vary the allotments in their AgencIestasThey think suitable. It is not essential that all the medals should be distributed, and if you consider that distribution on the scale proposed in your Agency would be excessive, you should surrender a portion of your allotment. You may ask for a small supplementary allotment if it is really essential, but the num ber available to meet such requests is likely to be very small and it may be impossible to meet them except from the number surrendered by Political Officers. In the case of minority administrations, the Political Officer responsible for the State administration should supervise the preparation of the distribu tion list for the State. The cases of States the Rulers of which, on account of their own shortcomings, are not carrying on the administration and will not be given the medal, may be more difficult. It is however not possible to lay down any rule for the treatment of these cases, and it is left to Politi cal Officers to decide whether to distribute in such States all or a proportion of the allotment for nobles and officials. 9. Distribution to Armed Forces in India will probably be made on a 2 per cenE basis,,with automatic grants to certain senior officers. The cri- terion for distribution will be length of service. It is provisionally proposed to make a distribution oh a similar basis to Indian States Forces and Irregu lar Corps. Tfr the case of Indian States Forces an allotment will be made for each State, and a suggested scheme of distribution will be sent for communica tion to Rulers. It will be left to the Rulers to apply the scheme to their own State Forces and to decide the actual distribution. Further details regarding the scheme of distribution to Regular Armed Forces will be communicated to you as early as possible, in order that your scheme for distribution to Irregular Forces under your control may as far as possible conform to that scheme.4 10. Distribution to Agency Police Forces has been calculated on a 2 per cent, basis, and in the appendix to this letter, allotment for the Police Forces under your control has been shown accordingly. 11. It is proposed to distribute the medal to all members of the Political Department who are holding or have held superior appointments or are hold ing responsible posts on foreign service. In the appendix to this letter is a list of the posts held by members of the Department in your agency who will be granted the medal. It is also proposed to grant the medal to all Agency Surgeons and Officers of the Indian Medical Service of the Foreign and Political cadre on deputation and to Police officers and other officials serving in Agencies whose status corresponds to that of a District Officer (Deputy Commissioner, Executive Engineer, etc.) in a Province in British India. 12. In the appendix to this letter there is also shown the miscellaneous allotment proposed for the agencies and administered areas. P his allotment is meant to cover all officers serving in agencies (excluding officers of the Political Department and Indian Medical Service who are shown separ ately) all executive and ministerial staff serving under your control and non-officials residing in British Administered Areas, including Cantonments. 13. The Government of India will be responsible for distribution of the medal to all officers of the Political Department and other Central Departments serving under your control, who will be on long leave on the date of the Jubilee. If there are any officers not in these categories or whose leave is sanctioned by you without reference to the Government of India, who are on leave at that date and to whom you will be unable to give the medal then, you are requested to send a list with their addresses on leave as early as possible. 14. In the distribution of medals in States and Agencies, the following points should be observed :— (1) No medal should be given without the sanction of the Government ot India to a serving Military Officer seconded for duty in a State or on duty in an Agency who will in the normal course of events return to regular military employ. Such medals will come from the Army Department quota. In certain cases, medals for such officers will not be given by the military autho rities under their scheme of distribution ; but there may be local reasons for making exceptions, and you are asked to make your recommendations in every case in which you consider that a medal should be given. (2) No medal should be given to an officer of a Provincial Government serving in a State or in an Agency without the approval of that Government. (3) No medal should be given to non-officials in Cantonments without the prior concurrence of the local military authorities. (4) The ministerial staffs of your own and associated offices are small and a percentage limit is not proposed. It may be noted how ever that the distribution for ministerial staffs in England is on a £ per cent, basis. As a general rule it is not advisable to give more than on the following maximum scale — I First class Resident’s offices including associated offices (Police, P. W. D. etc.) .... 3 Second class Residents’ offices . . . , } Political Agents’ offices . . . . . &gt; j 1 (5) It is suggested that you should consult Political officers of neigh bouring agencies in all cases where you consider it advisable. The instructions of the Government of India cannot be so detailed as to ensure complete consistency but much might be done by mutual consultation to ensure that similar cases are treated alike.Telegram From To R 0 r?

His Majesty the King Emperor has approved the issue of a Silver Medal to be known as “ The King’s Silver Jubilee Medal ”, in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of His Majesty’s accession to the Throne. Some 80,000 Medals will be struck for issue as a personal souvenir from His Majesty to persons in the Crown Services and others throughout the Empire. Individuals selected for the award will receive the Medal on or shortly after the 6th May 1935, but the Medals will not be worn on the 6th May, except by special instruction. The following is a description of the Medal, which has been designed by Sir Goscombe John, R. A. :— Obverse .—Conjoint busts of Their Majesties the King and Queen, crowned and robed, looking to the left, with the inscription around GEORGE V AND QUEEN MARY MAY VI MCMXXXV. Reverse .—The Royal Cypher G. R. I. surmounted by the Crown with the dates MAY 6, 1910 and MAY 6, 1935 on either side, the whole within an ornamental border. The medal will be worn suspended by a ring from a ribbon 1J inch wide with a red centre stripe f inch wide and two blue stripes and one white stripe of equal width on either side. Diameter of medal —\\ inch. The King’s Silver Jubilee Medal is classified as an official medal, to be worn, on all occasions on which decorations and medals are worn, on the left breast after all Jubilee, Coronation and Durbar Medals, which follow War Medals in the Order of Precedence. Ladies who have no other decorations or medals will wear the Jubilee Medal on the left shoulder of the dress, the ribbon in this case being in the form of a bow. Ladies w^ho are already in possession of official medals worn on a bar may, if they wish, add the Jubilee Medal to the bar instead of wearing it separately on a bow. Applications from individual members of the public cannot be entertained. The other commemorative medal, which has been prepared by the Royal Mint by His Majesty’s Command for sale to the public, is not classified as an official medal and may not be worn as such. S. C.

My dear Powle, t Will you kindly refer to your telegram T/106 dated the 4th April 1935, of which a copy has been sent to me by Laith- waite, about the Jubilee Medals for Bahrain. 2. The one medal for the office should, I think, be given to the Indian Assistant. He has been at Bahrain for some time, and is distinctly above the rest in position. If, however, it is intended for the nan-gazetted staff, then I think that the Head Clerk should get it (especially as I hope that the Head Munshi will get another reward). 3. The seven medals for notables might be given as follows* (i) Hajji Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo. (ii) Muhammad Khalil (Superintendent of the Bahrain Government Land Revenue Department)• (iii) The Sub-Postmaster. ( iv) Khan Bahadur Abdur Rahman i*ay&amp;ni. (v) Abdul Ali Bin Rajab (as something for the Baharineh). (vi) One for a member of the Indian Community. (vii) The Passport Officer of the Bahrain Government. 4. I am particularly anxious that the Sub—Postmaster should receive this recogniti on,as he has done us well and has had an hard time. 5. I cannot suggest a member of the Indian community by name, as I do not know who is likely to be at Bahrain at the time. 6. I venture to suggest that the medals be given at the darbar, if one is held in order to attach to them as high a value as may be. 7. I hope that the Trucial Chiefs may be given one each for themselves, if they can be presented in suitable circums tances.8« I have purposely omitted any foreigner (such as, ww the Q,asaibis, Khimj is and so on), so as to keep the medal more or less 'in the family'.

It may be worth while to put in writing the suggestion mentioned this morning about the status of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain, although it is entirely personal to myself and I have not had occasion to speak on the subject to the Foreign Office. Other views may possibly be held there but I think they w r ould in the main be guided by the opinion of the Bin Sa T ud the importance which we attach to the ^astern Arabian Shaikhs and especially to the Shaikhs of Kuwait and • u ahrain as independent rulers bound to us by special ties. it has for some time seemed to me unfortunate that in correspondence with the Sa^udi Government I should have to refer to these two Shaikhs as 'His Excellency' merely using a title which normally applies to subordinate persons and in Eastern usage to persons of quite small account. My suggestion is that H.M.G should in some appropriate way confer on them the official status of 'His Highness', the Arabic equivalent of which would be 'somu', i.e., the title borne by the Amir of Trans-Jordan and. and there may be objections unknown to me from, other points of view. I may, however, put forward two considerations, \hich might make the suggestion acceptable at the present time:- (a) The King is conferring the G.C.R on Bin Sa ! ud and I status in the way suggested above would mark ^ -t----*- mean that we undervalue ethers tftose less which whom we have # /s ecial Indian Office and Government of - L ndia. Ye have had increasing reasons to emphasise vis-a-vis I understand the ^ultan of Muscat. I approach the subject from one point of view only am taking the insignia to Riyadh. I think it would be In appropriate to confer honours of the same kind on the two Shaikhs at the present juncture but an improvement ol their attentions to Bin Sa T ud (w'hich I myself haverrmfldentlal , KotC/566-1.a/ll• P,8th l^yember 1U35* I enclose in original Cir Andrew Hyan f s note of the ijth i^overber 1075 about conferring an higher title than ^is Fxccllency 1 upon the Shaikh^s of Bahrain and Kuwait. 0. I should welcome an higher title for the Shaikh of Bahrain. 7 # There would, however, be certain implications: for example, that calls would be paid first upon the Shaikh in the case of all Officers (who ordinarily visit Bahrain), except the honourable the Boll ties1 Resident end His Excellency the Npval Commander-in-Chief. 4. There is also the question whether the title would be dynastic or personal. I hardly think that the title of *hiiw Highness n with its consequent enhancement of status could in the circumstances of the Persian &amp;ulf be made personal, as from the local point of view a reversal of calling ^roceoure on the advent of a new' h u ier might be very embarrassing, while from the wider point of view it would tend to defeat our object of emphasising the independent sovereignty of the ^Biler* 5. It would also be necessary to consider whether the step might not make it difficult to insist on the personal eleven gun salute reverting to the dynastic seven gun salute, for if the new Ruler were to have only a seven gun salute, it would be enoniEilous for the Political Agent (for example) to pay the first call. 9 /£. .'ourcble Peutcnf.nt-Colone 1 T.C.Fo’. le, Political Resident in the '■'ersian “ulf.6.

Moreover it is to our general interest to raise the prestige of these ulers as much as possible, and their present title of 'His Excellency' is hardly appropriate to independent Sovereigns which, juridically, is the position occupied by them.

Colonel Loch in hie letter raisee certain points which need some consideration, and the same points apply also to Kuwait. I agree with Colonel Loch (paragraph 2 of his letter) that if the title of *His Highness' is conferred ell Officers who ordinarily visit Bahrain (or Kuwait),(with the exception of the Commander-in-Chief and the Politics! Resident, whose salutes of 15 and 13 guns respectively are more than those of the Rulers concerned, i.e. 11 guns),should make the first call on the Shaikh. At Muscat the first call on the Sultan (whose title is 'His Highness') is made by all Officers including the Commander-in-Chief and the Political Resident, but the Sultans salute is 21 guns. 4. With regard to paragraph 4 of Colonel Loch's letter. I agree that, for the reasons given, the title should be dynastic. In addition to these reasons it would obviously be embarrassing on the death of one of the Rulers concerned for His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to heve to alter his title when mentioning the new -uler in correspondence with the Saudi Government. 3. I appreciate the point raised by Colonel Loch in his paragraph 5, but I think it would be advisable to keep the dynastic salute at 7 guns to enable the guns for the new Ruler to be raised to 11 if his conduct proved satis factory. The anomaly which Colonel Loch refers to, of the Political Agent, with a salute of 11 guns, paying the first call on the new Ruler with a lesser salute of 7 guns, could, I think, be disregarded.-3- 6. Presumably from the point of view of the Government of India there is no objection to the present Eulers being accorded the style of 'His Highness' since - vide Government of Indie letter No.l21-H f dated the 22nd September 1925 - those in Indie with 11 guns are entitled to this style of address, and the slight exception to this rule by which a new Euler would only receive 7 guns but still be styled 'His Highness' could doubtless be overlooked in the special circumstances ruling in the Persian Gulf # I am sending a copy of this letter to the Political Agents, Bahrain and Kuwait.

In support of this recormendatlon I am to refer to the circular letter to Local Governments on the subject of the use of the title of His High ness by Kullng Princes and others in India transmit ted to you under cov&lt;=r of the Political Secretary's letter No.76-M, dated the 24th leotember 1925. It wns then decided with the approval of Hie Majesty's Government that the use of the style of 'His Hlgli^ss' *ouxd in future be restricted to Indian Ruling Princer, and Chiefs enjoying salutes (dynastic, personal or local) of 11 guns and over.

Sir, of this style in addressing ...2 . addressing the present tfulers of both these Arab Principalities. 3. It is irapliclt in ..lr Andrew Ryan's suggestion, as made, that the proposed new style of address will emphasise the independent sovereignty of the two Hulers. But the Govern ment of India, while on general grounds they support this recoi mendation, as endorsed by the Political Resident, must m ke it cle^.r th t in so doing they are actuated rather by the con sideration that the new style of address, so far from emphasising the independence of these Galichs, will in fact tend to bring then more into line with Ruling Chiefs in India who are under the suzerainty of the Crown. They have also in mind that the hhalkhs of Bahrain and Kuwait, being juridically independent sovereigns in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government and the Government of India, might, should they so desire, take to themselves the title of His Majesty on the lines adopted by King Ibn Saud. Aioh a claim can perhaps be most easily forestalled by adoption of the present proposal. But it should he understood th t thie proposal, while It will no doubt enhance the position of the Shaikhs both in the eyes of their subjects and of all other Rulers in Arabia, is in reality not one to c &gt;nfer on them a new title, but merely to address them as 'His Highness' instead of 'Kis Excellency' as a style more appropriate to their positions. 4. It may be objected th t the use of the title 'His Highness' will encourage a demand on the part of the Truclal Coast Rulers and in particular from the iihalkh of i^atar for a6 • • • i. in 724 V similar fllpnlty. To this the Government of India would reniy th«t none of the Truclal ihalkha ai’e entitled to a pun salute which under the orders of 1925 would c*rry with it the title of ’His Highness', while in local estimation no one of them, even including the :baikh of Qatar, can he said to aporoach in dignity to the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Kuwait. The Government of India would further observe that the Saltan of Muscat, a 21 gun Ruler, is already addressed as 'His Highness', and there is much to be said for enhancing the dignities of the two leading Gulf Jhelkhs to make them more equal to those enjoyed by that Ruler. 5. As regards paragraph 4 of the Political Resident's letter I am to say that the Government of India agree that the title, once used, should be continued on a dynastic basis irrespective of the question whether the successors of the present Shaikhs are granted a personal salute of 11 guns. The Governrent of India further ngrep with Colonel Towle’s conclusion in para graph 5 of his letter that the dynastic salute of the shaikhs now ruling need not be raised at present above 7 guns as n corollary of the Present proposal. They are also in agreement with Colonel Fowle's reco ;raendstion that all officers visiting Bahrain and Kuwait with the exception of the Commander-In-Chief and the ivlltical Resident should, after the new style of address comes into use, make the first call on the Shaikh. V6 . In conclusion I am to add that since the Persian Gull Huierr are not In competition with Ruling Chiefs in India, the Government of India do not anticipate that the adoption of the present proposal will lead to any complications in the matter of precedence In India.

It is true that the previous visit of Shaikh Hamad to England in 1926 was made privately, and that the visit of Shaikh Ahmad of Kuwait in 1936 was also private. In the latter case, hov/ever, the Shaikh was ill and particularly asked that his visit should not he in a public capacity. The visit of the Sultan of Muscat to England in 1928 was at the expense of the Government Hospitality Fund, who entertained him for one month, and it appears that there is an earlier precedent of 1919 when the Shaikhs of Kuwait, Bahrain and Nejd were so treated. 2. It occurs to us, however, that official guests may not be welcome during the period of Court mourning. Before a decision is reached whether to encourage the Shaikh to proceed with his plans for a visit to England this year or to suggest to him that it mi ht be better to postpone it until 1937, we should be glad to be informed what is the position in this respect. to England?

(b) Shaikh Hamad proposes to be in the United kingdom for about a month. He had intended to be there for His Late Majesty’s birthday to attend an investiture about that time. If an investiture is to be held about the time of king Edward’s birthday (23rd June) the period of his visit will be fixea accordingly.

(d) Shaikh Hamad will be accompanied by six or eight persons in all (Loch cannot give names as yet). (e) Shaikh Hamad wishes to take Belgrave with him. Loch thinks, and I agree, that Belgrave’s presence would be most useful. (f) If Loch is on leave at the time of the Shaikh’s visit he will be glad to help on official occasions. In view of Belgrave’s accompanying the Shaikh there will be no need for the deputation of a Political Officer.

I am writing to let you know what arrangements are being made about the Shaikh 1 s forthcoming visit. He has decided to take the following persons with him, one of his young sons either Daij or Ahmed, Abdulla oin Jabr who will be described as his personal secretary, a clerk who is I think Quite a youth, and two servants, Including myself and my wife, who had already booked ,for that date, we shall be a party of eight and I believe that means a big reduction in fares. He does not want to travel at all by air, he says there is no hurry and he wants to see places. I have telegraphed and written to Thos Cook in Baghdad to make reservations from Baghdad to London via Mosul and Istanbul and have written to Traffic Manager Iraq Railways to make reservations from Basra to Ba&amp;hdad. The Shaikh will leave Bahrain on the up boat sailing from here 1st June, arrive Baghdad 4th, leave 7th, Istanbul Ilth London I4th. There might be a difference of a day at time of leaving here as I am writing to Smith to enquire whether there is any possibility of the fast mail calling in to take him up, Smith suggested this. The Shaikh wishes the matter to be kept secret as long as possible. He proposes to appoint Abdulla and Sulman and possibly old Shaikh Rashid as a sort of council while he is away with an allowance which will cover the cost of entertaining people who would normally have been dealt with by him and which will compensate them for not having been taken to London with him. He talks of being away for two months but perhaps extending the xxs visit if he likes it, he would like to return via Cairo and Palestine. He is taking a gold and pearl studded sword as a present to the King. The only particular thing which he mentioned that he wanted to do in England was to go to the races, by which he meant Ascot as he attended that last time he was home and seems to have enjoyed it very much.He has told me to begin buying luggage and to order clothes etc for him and the servants, in this connection will it be possiole for them to take their daggers with them and the two shaikhs to carry swords which is part of their normal get up? Visas on passports for all the countries one passes can be got in Baghdad but should the Shaikh himself have a passport or can he be given some special document? He has definitely decided not to take Shaikha Ayesha. He wants, if possible, to see the St Sophia mosque in Istanbul, as there is very little time to spare this will be difficult. Would it be possible to get anyone there to take him up to the mosque and return him i | to the train?/f 4£ GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Department. EXPRESS LETTER [N.

I believe it is intended to send the sword by air mail to a Bank in Ingiand in advance of tne party’s departure from here.

Would you kindly refer to your le _ _ of the 24th March, D.O. No.D.1031-N/36, on the subject of the proposed visit of Sheij^h Hamad of Bahrein to England. ip-1 A copy of my l ette r of 7th April to Crankshaw of the Government Hospitality Fund was sent to you by the ordinary mail of the 9th April and I no 7 / enclose a copy of Crankshaw’ r^puy dated the 8 th April. We have since consulted the Lord Chamberlain's Office who .state that there is no objection to the Sheikh being entertained by His Majesty’s Government during the period of Court mourning, e.g. in June of this year. 2. In the circumstances it seems desirable to encourage the Sheikh to come this year rather than next. 3. The only point which may cause a little difficulty is the precise length of the period during which th# Sheikh should receive Government hospitality. There are, of 1 \tr\ + course,/ Metcalfe, KCIE. , CSI., WO., ^Secretary to the Government of India, F ore i?n &amp; Political Department, Simla.I uk (' s 5 2 . course, the 1919 precedents and the precedent of the visit of the Sultan of Muscat in 1928. (Though in the latter case the length was decided upon only because it was felt that it would be impossible to give the Sultan of Muscat less hospitality than had been given to other Persian Gulf Rulers of less importance than himself). on the other hand the Amir Saud, when he came to this country as a Government guest last year, was entertained by His Majesty’s Government for a fortnight only (originally, I believe, a week was suggested, but a fortnight was decided on in cider that there should not be unfavourable comparisons with the hospitality offered by other European Governments during his tour), and after the fortnight he stayed in the United Kingdom for about another fortnight at his own expense. 4. The only other recent case that occurs to us which might be regarded as in some way parallel is the visit of the Amir of Transjordan in 1934. The Amir was originally invited for 3 weeks, but arrangements were apparently made to extend the visit for an extra week after the Amir’s arrival. The length of the official visit was, therefore, in effect, one month though the original intention had been 3 weeks. It may, however, be felt that the/3* Amir of Transjordan is not really of parallel status to the Sheikh of Bahrein, and there were apparently felt to he special reasons at the time lor His Majesty’s Government to go out of their way to pay particular honour to the Amir. It may well he that the Saudi Heir Apparent is as good a parallel as one is likely to get. 5» Ive hope that in putting lb rward recommendations, the Government of India will carefully consider this question of the length of the visit. it certainly seems hard that the Government Hospitality Fund should be tied down indefinitely to a convention that any Sheikh who comes from the Persian Gulf should invariably receive one month’s hospitality, if, as appears to he the case, this is considerably more than distinguished Government guests usually get in these days. On the other hand it is clearly not worth entertaining the Sheikh at all if there is a danger of his feeling (or the Gulf people as a whole feeling) that he has been treated stingily by His Majesty's Government. 6 . If the Sheikh is coming this summer it is, of course, desirable to settle the date of his arrival at the earliest possible moment. He should be here for the King's Birthday/1*2 4. Birthday on 23rd June and Ascot is, I believe, the week before. It might therefore be convenient for him to arrive, say, about the 15th June, if that is possible. , h o VF' 7. As regards paragraph 2(b) of Powle’s letter to you of 1st February, there will probably be Investitures at about the time of the King’s Birthday, but if, as I think we may safely hope, His Majesty is pleased to grant the Sheikh an Audience, the matter of investiture would probably be disposed of at the same time. We have no observations to offer at this stage on the other points in Fowls’s letter. 8 . I am sending a copy of this letter to Fowle and Loch. 'Tout’s sincerely. ^ J.

Sir, I am direoted by Mr. Secretary Edoa to request you to inform the Secretary of State lor India that he has had under ooneideration your letter ho. 2.'&amp;. 1693/36 of the 17th April, regarding the proposal that the Sheikhs of Bahrain and koweit should in future be addressed aa 'Highness' instead of 'Excellency ! , and to soato that, in deference to the views expressed by the Government of India, and subject to the following observations, Mr. Kden does not wish to raise further objection to this proposal. Mr. Eden observes, however, that in paragraph 4 of your letter No. P.k. 1693/36 of the 17th April, it is implied that these Arab rulers are hot under the suzerainty ol the Crown. Furthermore in the correspondence forming the enclosures in your letter under reply, reference is made by the Government of India, and by thoirolitioal Resident in the iersian Gulf, to the 'Juridical independence', and by the Political Agent at i^oweit to the 'independence', of these rulers. Mr. Eden desires to make it clear that, while it has often been found convenient to refer to them as 'independent rulers in special treaty relations with Hie Majesty*s v/Qvernment% he is advised that, in international law, the affect of these treaty relations is that these rulers are in iact not independent sovereigns but merely the rulers of British protected states enjoying a large measure of internal autonomy, and are only 'independent sovereigns' in the sense ifiat the Indian Princes or the rulers of the Malay States are So ^sated in English Municipal law by the English Courts, secretary of State, 3./ ^dia Office. •iHSgd. G.• iiEHLEL • 3. The Secrei&amp;ry of State would be interested to learn how the Government of India propose that the new title should be conierred: that is to say, whether directly by The King, or by, a cocamunication addressed to the Sheikhs, by Hie Majesty 1 * authority, to the effect that Hie Majesty had approved of the use of the title of 'His Highness' by all British authorities in addressing or referring to the Bheikhs. 4. A further minor point on which Mr. Eden would be glad to have His Lordship’s views is whether the French translation of the title 'His Highness' 1 which it is proposed to confer on these Sheikhs should be 'Son Altease', in accordance with European usage, or ' Sa hautesse . a style which used, he is informed, to be employed in the case of the hhedives of Egypt. I am, etc.,INDIA OFI'ICA, ?. Z* 1693/36 vviiIT EliALL ; S. W. 1. 17th April, 1936. Sir, trf't I am directed by the Secretary of State ior India to forward ior the information of the Secretary of state for Foreign Aflairs, a copy of a letter with its enclosures from the on+h February, ) Government of India in regard to the proposal £. Mr. Secretary Eden will observe that the Government of India, after consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent at Bahrein, are in favour of this proposal and, subject to any observations which Mr. Eden may wish to make, the Marquess of Zetland is inclined to agree. 3. his Lordship does not consider that the adoption of the proposal would have any embarrassing results in regard to Qatar and the Trucial Coast Sheikhdoms. As regards the Arab Rulers on the Trucial Coast it is not apparently at present the recognised practice to use the title of ’His Excellency’ and no question can arise of using that of ’His Highness’. As regards the Sheikh of Qatar, His Lordship sees no reason why any special favour should be shown to this ruler at present or until he merits it, but if the higher title were accorded to the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit this step might supply a useful incentive to the iue Under Secretary of state, ) that uhe Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit should in future be addressed as ’Highness’ and not as ’Excellency' .

Ryan that it would, strengthen the position vis-a-vis Ibn Saud if the anonicily of referring; to these independent rulers as 'Excellency 71 could be avoided. Moreover he does not feel that the relations between the Sheikhs in question and His Majesty 1 s government would oe in any way adversely affected by the change of title. As the Government of India point out the title TI His Highness 11 is in fact applied in India to rulers who y unrike the Arab rulers, are actually under the suzerainty of the Crown, and while it is, of course, the case that in the Persian Gull the title is applied to the Sultan of Muscat, who is in a position more independent than that of the other rulers, it seems hardly likely that the use of the title would be interpreted as involving a change of status or as being different in kind from, say, the eyant of a Knighthood in one of the Indian Orders. On the other hand the use of the new title, which will cost His Majesty*s Government nothing, mi^ht well tend to improve relations with the Sheikh of Koweit and to counteract such feelings of disappointment as he may entertain in regard to His Majesty*s Government in other respects, while it would be a fitting mark of His Majesty’s Government’s appreciation of the ready co-operation which they have received recently from the Sheikh of Bahrein in matters such as the transfer oi the Naval Base, air arrangements, etc., and of his general oftitude in his relations v;ith His Majesty’s Government. 5. His Lordship agrees with the Government of India that the title once used should be continued on a dynastic 0a sis and without regard to the salute enjoyed by the individual sheikh. Ho sees no reason to object to theft I proposal that all officers visiting' Bahrein and Koweit, with the exception of the Commander-in-Chief and the Political Reoident, should^ after the nev/ style of address comes into use, make the first call on the Sheikh. o. Couies or this letter with its enclosures are being sent to tne Acuiiiralty and the Aii' Ministry, I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,. 169*3/ *36. | QyC* I- No. D.456-N/36. From To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. The Under Secretary of state for India, Political Department, India Office, LONDON. Dated New Delhi, the POth February 1936. Sir, With reference to paragraph 7 of Sir Andrew Ryan's despatch No. 352, dated the 10th December 1935, I am directed to forward a copy of a letter ^ r0t L Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 939-S, dated the 5th December 1935, with enclosures, and to say that for reasons given below the Government of India are in favour of addressing the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait in future as 'His Highness’, and not as 'His Fbccellency' . 2. In support of this recommendation I am to refer to the circular letter to Local Governments on the subject of the use of the title of His Highness by Ruling Princes and others in India transmitted to you under cover of the Political Secretary’s letter No. 76-M, datea the 24th September 1925. It was then decided with the approval of His Majesty's Government that the use of the style of 'His Highness' would in future be restricted to Indian Ruling princes and Chiefs enjoying salutes (dynastic, personal or local) of 11 guns and over. The Shaikhs of Bahrain and kuwait are both entitled to dynastic salutes of 7 guns and to a personal salute of 11 guns, a nd it follows that there is nothing under the orders of 1925 to debar the use of this style in addressing/2 . addressing the present Rulers of both these Arab Principalities. 3. It is implicit in Sir Andrew Ryan f s suggestion, as made, that the proposed new style of address will emphasise the independent sovereignty of the two Rulers. But the Government of India, while on general grounds they support this recommendation, as endorsed by the Political Resident, must make it clear that in so doing they are actuated rather by the consideration that the new stjrle of address, so far from emphasising the independence of these Shaikhs, will in fact tend to bring them more into line with Ruling Chiefs in India who are under the suzerainty of the Crown. They have also ii^aind that the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait, beta* juridically independent sovereigns in special treaty relations with His Majesty 1 s Government and the Government of India, might, should they so desire, take to themselves the title of His Majesty on the lines adopted by King Ibn Saud. Such a claim can perhaps be most easily forestalled by adoption of the present proposal. But it should be understood that this proposal, while it will no doubt enhance the position of the Shaikhs both in the eyes of their subjects and of all other Rulers in Arabia, is in reality not one to confer on them a new title, but merely to address them as ! His Highness* instead of ’His Excellency’ as a style more appropriate to their positions. 4. It may be objected that the use of the title ’His Highness’ will encourage a demand on the part of the Trucial Coast Rulers and in particular from the Shaikh of Qatar for i similar dignity. Tofthis the Government of India would reply that none of the Trucial Shaikhs are entitled to a gun salute which under the orders of 1925 would carry with it the title of ’His Highness’, while in local estimation no one of them, even including the Shaikh of Qatar, can be said to/to approach in dignity to the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Kuwait. The Government of India would further observe that the Sultan ol Muscat, a 21 gun Ruler, is already addressed as ’His Highness’, and there is much to be said for enhancing the dignities of the two leading Gulf Sheikhs to make them more equal to those enjoyed by that Ruler* 5. As regards paragraph 4 of the Political Resident’i letter, I am to say that the Government of India agree that the title, once used, should be continued on a dynastic basis irrespective oi the question whether the successors oi the present Sheikhs are granted a personal salute of 11 guns. The Government of India further agree with Colonel Powle’s conclusion in paragraph 5 of his letter that the dynastic salute of the Shaikhs now ruling need not be raised at present above 7 guns as a corollary of the present proposal. They are also insgreement with Colonel Powle’s recommendation that all officers visiting Bahrain and Kuwait with the exception of the CommaMer-in- style of address comes into use, make the first call on the Shaikh* 6* In conclusion I am to add that since the Persian Gulf Rulers are not in competition with Ruling Chiefs in India, the Government of Inula do not anticipate that the adoption of the present proposal will lead to any complications in the matter of precedence in India* I have, Ac., (Sgd.)

Letter No.C/bGB-l.a/11 of 28th November 1935 from the Political , noted in the entirely concur in Sir Andrew Ryan’s view as expressed in his note. The raising of the official status of the Rulers in question would not only enable His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to refer to them in correspondence with the Saudi Government in more fitting terms than at present, but would be peculiarly appropriate at the present juncture for the reasons given by Sir Andrew Ryan- in connection with the G.C,B. which is being conferred on King Ibn Saud. Moreover it is to our general interest to raise the prestige of these Rulers as rauoh as possible, and their present title of 'His Excellency' is hardly appropriate to independent Sovereigns which, juridically, is the position occupied by them. 3. Colonel Loch in his letter raises certain points To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi. Subject:- Status of the Rulers of Bahrain and Kuwait. Sir, I have the honour to enclose copies of the correspondence Bahrain, to the Political Resident 2. Sir Andrev/ Ryan’s Note dated 19th November 1935. margin I which need some consideration, and the same points apply also to Kuwait. I agree with Colonel Loch (paragraph 2 of his letter) that if the title of 'His Highness' is conferredall Officers who ordinarily visit Bahrain (or Kuwait), (with the exception of the Commander-in-Chief) and the Political Resident, whose salutes of 15 and 13 guns respectively are more than those of the Rulers concerned, i.e. 11 guns), should make the first call on the Shaikh. At Muscat the first call on the Sultan (whose title is 'His Highness”) is made by all Officers including the Commander-in-Chief and the Political Resident, but the Sultan's salute is 21 guns. 4# With regard to paragraph 4 of Colonel Loch's letter. I agree that, for the reasons given, the title should be dynastic. In addition to these, reasons it would obviously be embarrassing on the death of one of the Rulers concerned for His Majesty's Minister, Jedda, to have to alter his title when mentioning the new Ruler in correspondence with the Saudi Government. 5. I appreciate the point raised by Colonel Loch in his paragraph 5, but I think it would be advisable to keep the dynastic salute at 7 guns to enable the guns for the new Ruler to be raised to 11 if his conduct proved satis factory. The anomaly which Colonel Loch refers to, of the Political Agent, with a salute of 11 guns, paying the first call on the new Ruler with a lesser salute of 7 guns, could, I think be disregarded* 6. Presumably from the point of view of the Government of India there is no objection to the present Rulers being accorded the style of ”His Highness' since - vide Government of India letter No.i21-H, dated the 22nd September 1925 - those in India with 11 guns are entitled to this style of address, and the slight exception to this rule by which a new Ruler would only receive 7 guns but still be styled 'His Highness' could doubtless be over looked in the special circumstances ruling in the Persian Gulf. i/)??(5 The Agency, Bahrain. 28th November,1935 I i My dear Fowle, I enclose in original Sir Andrew Ryan's note of the 19th November 1935 about conferring an higher title than 'His Excellency' upon the Shaikhs of Bahrain-and Kuwait. 2. I should welcome an higher title for the Shaikh of Bahrain. 3. There would,however, be certain implications for example, that calls would be paid first upon the Shaikh in the case of all Officers (who ordinarily visit Bahrain), except the Honourable the Political Resident and His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief. 4. There is also the question whether the title would be dynastic or personal. I hardly think that the title of His Highness' with its consequent enhancement of status could in the circumstances of the Persian Gulf be made personal, as from the local point of view a reversal of calling procedure on the advent of a new Ruler might be very embarrassing, while from the wider point of view it would tend to defeat our object of emphasising the independent sovereignty of the Ruler. 5. It would also be necessary to consider whether the step might not make it difficult to insist on the personal eleven gun salute reverting to the dynastic seven gun salute, for if the new Ruler were to have only a seven gun salute,it would be anomalous for the Political Agent (for example) to pay the first call. i have not had time to consider the matter fully,but mention the above points as they come into mind. 7 # i have ventured to keep a copy of the note Arable in my confidential records. Yours sincerely r*Q Sd.G.Loch.] 002Uii&gt; The Honourable the Political Resident. It may be worth while to put in writing the suggestion I mentioned this morning about the status of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain,although it is entirely personal to myself and I have not had occasion to speak on the subject to the Foreign Office. Other views may possibly be held there but I think they would in the main be guided by the opinion of the India Office and Government of India. vis-a-vis Ibn Saud the importance which we attach to the Eastern Arabian Shaikhs and especially the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain as independent rulers bound to us by special ties. It has for some time seemed to me unfortunate that in correspondence with the Saudi Government it should have to refer to these two Shaikhs as , His Excellency merely using a title which normally applies to subordinate persons and in Eastern usage to persons of quite small account, lay suggestion is that His Majesty 1 o Government should in some appropriate way confer on them the official status of 'His Highness 11 , the Arabic equivalent of whioh would be ,, Somu n i.e. the title borne by the Amir of Trans Jordan and, I understand the Sultan of Muscat. only and there may be objections unknown to me, from other points of view. I may, however, put forward two considerations, which might make the suggestion acceptable at the present tiioe:- (a) The King is conferring the G.C.B. on Ibn Saud and I am taking the Insignia to Riyadh. I think it would be inappropriate to confer honours of the same kind on the two Shaikhs at the present juncture but an improvement of their status in the way suggested above would mark the fad that attentions to Ibn Saud (which I myself have advocated We have had increasing reasons to emphasise \ I approach the subject from one point of view do not • • • • •do not mean that we undervalue other rulers with whom we have special relations and who have deserved well of His Majesty’s Government. (b) The end of Jubilee Year would be a by no means inappropriate time to dignify the two Shaikhs in the manner suggested. . Sd. AJNDREiT HYAH. \( t @CONFIDENTIAL. @&gt;; ^ V / No. 390-S of 1936.

It is devoted entirely to gossip of the 'News of the World' type about prominent personages, local and other-wise, written in an undeniably witty vein but descending to incredible depths of salaciousness. Its local circulation is fairly large, and I understand that the owner also makes a pretty little Income from blackmailing local notables wltn threats of exposing in the paper some of their numerous vices. it is, however, regarded merely as sauce to the dish of current journalism and no one would dream of taking any of its myriad stories seriously. - should therefore deprecate any attempt to take the Editor to task over this matter, as he would probably relish the idea thatne had annoyed the Sheikh and would find an opportunity to enlarge the offence on another occasion. Publicity being what he thrives on. The article should in my opinion be allowed to sink into oblivion. Yours aver, (Sgd G.W. Furlonge.ft . 1 * 7. if 1-&amp; IRTSIA cmc*, 'SUITSHALL, S.’f.l.

Lonuon is being visited today by the Amir of Bahrain, King of Pearls and Master of the Coast. The Aair of Bahrain, of the AlKhalifah family, i 8 advanced in age. He might be in the sixtieth year of his age. He himself does not know exactly how many years he has lived. We said advanced in age, but he has the spiritof youth (green). He was able to increase the number of his lovely wives during his last visit to London. He has good taste and likes clean (beautiful) faces. He was able to add a new wife to the number of his wives. This wife is Miss Clara Linaman Scholar the well known youthibl Scottish orientalist who became fond of Arab princes, their manners and customs. She was dreaming of becoming an Arab princess. This was brought into reality during the present visit of the Amir of Bahrain to London. She introduced herself to him, made herself charming and so made him love her. So he married her recently in a special ceremony held at the London Mosque in which the bride appeared wearing a dess wholly covered with pearls. It is worth mentioning that Miaa Clara Lindman Scholar is wealthy and holds a high position in the world of literature (in England). she formerly tried to approach King Faisal. she visited him in Iraq and tried to win his heart, but the pure monarch had not an adventurous spirit nor the aesirelbr such a thing so he sent her back ani she failed.

Coronation Medal k x S Si i I am direcued to inform you that His Majesty the King Tmpeioi has decided to institute a special medal to commemcra the Coronation of Their Majesties. The total number of medals to be distributed in India is 29,500 of which 3,000 are to be kept in reserve for distribution at the time of the Royal Durbar -/hen this is held in India. Ruling Princes and Chiefs visiting England for the Coronation will be presented with medals at the time of Coronation as will also members of the Inaian Contingent. The balance of the medals is to be distributed on a date not yet fixed but soon after the Coronation dry. 2. The number of medals available fnr distribution in India is approximately 15 per cent less than the number available for distribution at the Jubilee. I am to ask that you will submit as early as possible figures of the number °i medals required for (1) Ruling Princes and Chiefs, (2) States (Nobles, Officials, etc.), te •- 2 - ( J ) ^ lsce llanenus (including non-officials ana cfficarc of Central Departments, with the exception of .lailv/ay and Posts and Telegraphs Depar'GmenLs, serving under your control) ? (4) Ladies having ±n view the reduction in numbers available. (Tcux iigures should not include the requirements for ,.

In addition the follorin principles should be borne in mind* ■ fl3 a general rule the Medal is not to be given to Government servants whi have less than years continuous service on the date of the Coronation, i*e # the 12th May 1937. (2) The Medal should not be given to retired Government diicials as such but there is no objection to its award to such officers for services they may have rendered after their retirement. (o) It is desirable that more consideration should be given than on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee to idle claims of non-oiT icials and it is hoped that attention will be paid to this point. 4. The political Department is responsible for distribution c, i hhe Medal to officers of the Indian political Service and the Indian Medical Service serving in Agencies and medals f t tnese officers should not be included in your demands. ^ Medals intended for officers on leave should be retained ana sent to them on their return. ^ ' • The Puling princes and Chiefs in the list at Appendix I '•ill be awarded medals in Tngland and should be excluded from your figures.

P.A. Ref: para Please see P.12 of File 6/4 subiLittec belov.. On the evening of the 7?c Deceikber 1935 I discussed confidentially v ith the Adviser ( L*r. Belgrave ) the question of the b haikh going to b e lhi or London for the Investiture. The Shaikh has not mentioned the matter recently but has discussed it with Ibdullah 1 in Ja 1 :^ and the ihaihhajL, He v.ould I think .refer to go to ^ondon and on the v/hole, I think, that the interest a of the 2t: te would be better served by going there, particularly beccuse many people in Bahrain have been to India and can argue about things when the Shaikh is telling them of his adventures, whereas if he goes to London ^eople will know lit ale /wvhen he tells them of his adventures. x will give him a day or two before I speak to him as he is at present suffering from a heavy cold.
