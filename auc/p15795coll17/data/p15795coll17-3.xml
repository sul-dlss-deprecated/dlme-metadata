He had studied Arabic there in the late 1940s, and describes his classmates and teaching methods like the one-on-one lessons with Al Azhar sheikhs.  After a short time teaching political science at AUC, work with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza, and graduate school at Harvard, in 1955 Horton was appointed Dean of the School of Oriental Studies, whose enrollment had been declining. He describes S.O.S. faculty, both those already present (like Maurice Salib) and others he recruited and hired (like Marsden Jones and Mohamed Nowaihi). Horton outlines changes in the teaching of Arabic, including the introduction of group classes, hiring of instructors trained at Cairo University rather than Al Azhar, new books and electronic visual technology, and taking over undergraduate Arabic courses. Under Horton the School of Oriental Studies broadened its scope beyond language teaching, to include Arabic literature and other Arabic Studies coursework with a humanities and social science focus, and sponsored events attended by scholars from institutions around Cairo (like Fr. Pierre Anawati of the Dominican Institute) interested in such topics. He discusses the operations of the S.O.S. Library and the recently acquired library of Islamic architecture scholar Sir K.A.C. Creswell, and how the hiring of Christel Kessler tempered the challenges of having Creswell on staff. Personnel and changes in AUC’s academic administration, including Horton’s role as Graduate Dean and in curriculum planning, are also covered. Horton describes President Raymond McLain and speaks about his father Douglas Horton, who was Chairman of the Board of Trustees in the 1950s, and mentions efforts to remove controversial Dean of Students Beatrice “Bicky” McLain, the wife of the president.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
