J/ar&lt;|UhRr, D. 3 ,C. # R.#., and the officers of ^Pensanoe** for making; it a very pleasant one. 2. iome points in my tour may be of interest. 3. As far as I know, the island of Abd-al~£url has never previously been rialted by officials from ♦'den. Xt Is about 4 miles in length ? f n&lt;j barely 2 miles in width at its narrowest point in the ooutre, where there is an anchorage on the southern side, from which we walked across to the northern s%;*. fhe island is devoid of vegetation and its few wells are brackish. The Inhabitants, who are said to nu^ibor His Majesty's ieoretary of 3tate for the Colonies, London. aboutabout 200, lire in primltiTe horela and subsist on fish and food brought to thorn by occasional dhows from Arabia and Africa. Money is practically unknown, and the people deal with the Dhowo by bartering fish and shells for their requirements. They acknowledge the sovereignty of the Jultan of docotra, who has a representative on the island. 4. The large island of ioootra (about 70 miles in length and 20 to 30 in width) presents a striking eontrast to the desolate Abd-el-Kuri. Its thickly wooded hills rise to peaks of 4000 and 5000 feet from which streams descend to villages of small, neat houses surrounded by plantations of date trees, patches of water melons, and pasture for sheep and goats and the straight-backed breed of cattle peculiar to iocotra. The present sultan of ^ishn and docotra, &gt;ultan Ali bin Ahmed Towari bin *Afrar, has reoently been elected in succession to his cousin Jttltan Abdulla bln 'Isa. He fils* a Union Jack on his dar, and his people appear to be simple and friendly. At his own suggestion he accompanied me in H.M. 3 . 'Pensance' to ^ishn, the eapltal of his Mahrl territory on the mainland of Arabia, in order to expedite a settlement of the difficulty about the establishment of an emergency landing ground for the Uoyal Air 2oroe there, to which references have been made in recent Aden Political Intelligence .'fummaries (paragraphs 2203 and 2275). 5 . On our arrival at ^ishn the local objections to the landing ground were withdrawn, and the Royal Air Jtorce Officer who accompanied me arranged for the clearing and marking of a suitable site. 1 accordingly removed the economic pressure which (as reported in Political Intelligence hn&amp;aary paragraph 2275) had beenput on the ocotrena and Mahris* The co-operation of the ^u 9 altl authorities in enforcing this pressure contributed largely to its success, their refusal to admit two Mahri dhows to the port of Muk&amp;lla having made a strong impression* The people at siiahn gave us a friendly reception and appeared to welcome the *L ose of the landing ground controversy* 6* I took the opportunity of my visit to tho Uttltan of ^ishn and aocotra to consult him regarding tho eastern boundary of his mainland possessions, with regard to which the British Resident in the Persian Gulf has lately raised a doubt* The Jultan was rather vague about the question, the decision of which, he said, ho would leave entirely to me; but there was a general concurrence among his principal advisers that the boundary between his territory and that of the lultan of Muscat is at Has Barbat •All, in spite of the fact that there are Mahris living in the villages of Kharlfut and HakhStut to the east of this point* I am therefore of opinion that Ras Barbat v Ali may be accepted as being the eastern limit of the Aden Protectorate* 7* At Muk&amp;lla we were received with his customary courtesy and hospitality by Jeyyid Bubakr bln Huseln bln Hamid al iiihdhar, the representative of Jultan Umar, who, as usual was absent in India* ffs were here met by Group-Captain Boyd, who had arrived from Aden with Colonel Lake, Squadron-Leader Kickarde, Squadron-Leader Kusoell, and Plying Officer R*li*Harris, and were flown to Shibam, about 100 rallee from the coast, the principal town in the iiu , altl portion of the H&amp;dhram&amp;ut valley* Both here and in the Kathirl towns of Seyyun, Ghurfa and Tarim, to which ws travelled&amp;&gt; trarellod by motor car t wo wore welcomod with a great display of cordiality and hospitality. This was the first visit by a Resident of Aden to the valley of the Hadhramaut, and the reception accorded to ms by the ^u f aiti Governor of Jhibam, the Kathiri &gt;ultan of iieyyun and the A1 Kafs and other merchants of Tarim, and the friendly demeanour of the people in general are indications that the inhabitants of this area no longer deserve the reputation for a fanatical dislike of strangers which they had until latel/, and which was evident at the time of the journeys of the Bents and Leo Hirsch in 1893, This change of attitude is attributable to the close connection that has been established by many Hadhramis with Singapore and Java, where they have acquired wealth and an acquaintance with the modern world, and to the viaitsof officers of the Royal Mr Force at Aden - notably diiuadron- Leader A,K,M. Riclcarda, A.F.C, • and of travellers such as Mr, Van der Meulen and Colonel Boscawen, who have established friendly personal relations with the principal people in the valley. 8. The appearance and peculiar characteristics of the astonishing succession of mud-briefc towns and villages which line the broad valley of the Hadhramaut in the heart of a great area of rocky and desolate waste, and the degree of their civilisation and modern development have in reoont years been made known to the ^oaterworld by the aerial photographs taken by Squadron-Leader Cochrane, Squadron-Leader aickards and other officers of the R.A.J?. and by the descriptive books of Van der Meulen and Von tfiasmann, and of Herr Helfrits. A visit to them is an lit creating experience, and mine has given me a vivid impression of the crowded * sky-'sky-scrapers' of ihlbam! the picturesque palace of tfee Kathiri &gt;ultan which dominates the walled city of tftyyun and its surrounding rillas and gardens, and the elaborate residences of the wealthy merchants of Tarim. 9. Throughout there is a strange mingling of the ancient and the modern - motor cars, garages, and electric light intruding into communities which still indulge in internal feuds and warfare that necessitate walled defences between neighbouring Tillages and trenches for the protection of cultirators against the sniping of their enemies. The authority of the Kathiri dultan ie limited to deyyun and a few other places and is openly repudiated elsewhere; while the position of the titular hiltan of Tarim is so foeblo that he lives in oeyyun and contents himself with a representative in Tarim who is entirely overshadowed by the loo&amp;l oeyyids and especially by the members of the wealthy and powerful family of the Al Kafs, who were our hosts in this town. The ^•aiti Governor of Jhibam ie said to have better control and to maintain more order at his end of the valley, although his appearance does not suggest a strong ruler. 10. The more enlightened Arabs of the valley are keenly alive to the disadvantages of the lack of efficient government, and they alsofiel acutely the drawbacks of their isolation from the outside world and the absence of easy communioation with the sea. The Al Kafs have been making, at their own expense, a meter road from Tarim to connect with the &gt;4u f aiti port of dhihr, about 34 miles east of Muk&amp;lla, and have overcome tribal and other difficulties to the extent of completing its construction for most of the distance. A portion over the mountain ridge near the sea is still unmade, and here the promoters of the road are encounteringencountering local obstruction secretly Inspired, in their opinion, by the ^u'aiti Government, which dislikes a scheme that may tend to loosen its present grip on the land-locked Kathiris. Z found that it is the fashion in the Hadhramaut to attribute most political and economic ills to the supine selfishness of the absentee Gultan Umar of Mukalla, who is alleged to waste his time and his revenues in Hyderabad and to obstruct all progress in both the ^u 9 alti and the JCathlri territories. The accusation of malevolence is exaggerated, but the charge of neglect and avarice is well founded* 11, The Kathirie, who wero in former times in control of the whole country, would like to be rid of their economic and political dependence on the ^u f aitie, and to have direct relatione with the Aden Residency, from which they hope to receive encouragement and supp ort in the improvement of their country and its emancipation from ciu 9 &amp;lti ascendancy. This desire is a natural one, but it is necessary for the British authorities at Aden to deal very cautiously with their aspirations. I am personally in favour of cultivating good relations with the Kathirls, whose extensive Interests in Singapore and Java give them an importance beyond the limits of the Aden Protectorate, and of encouraging them in their plans for the betterment of their country. But our friendly Interest in the fortunes of the Kathirls ought not bo be allowed to prejudice our old-standing relations with the C|u 9 altl authorities of llukalla, who control the coast line and whose friendship is one of far more practical value to His Majesty 9 s Government than that of the K^thiris. X made it clear both at Mukalla and at Tarim that Z had no&amp; no intention of sacrificing old friends for new, but I urged on the ^tt , aiti Regent at Mukalla the desirability of helping the Kathlrls in their reasonable aspirations, and on the ICathirl Jultan and the Al iCafs the Ixoport&amp;nce to them of preserring good relations with Uukalla. 12. At 3hibam the principal subject on which the local (^•aiti Governor dwelt was hia alleged fear of the possibility of a Zeldi advance against the Hadhra* maut through Beihan. I reassured him on this point, and told him that H »is Majesty^ Government had no intention of permitting Zeidi penetration into Beihan, and that they fully realised that it commanded the road from the Yemen to the Hadhramaut. 13. I am indebted to Group-Captain O.T. Boyd, H.C., A.}?.C., for arranging the flight to and from 3hibam. The details of our journey in the Hadhraaaut were dealt with in his usual efficient manner by Squadron-Leader A.R.M. Rickards, A.if*C ., R.A.S’., whose energy, tact and popularity with the Arabs throu^iout the Aden Protectorate have been of great political value during his five years* service in Aden, which has now unfortunately come to an end.
