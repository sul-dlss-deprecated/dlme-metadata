Scott and wife interview</dc:title><dc:creator>Scott, James A.; wife</dc:creator><dc:date>1969-12-07</dc:date><dc:description>Dr. James Allen Scott and wife Sarah Holcomb “Sally” Scott were Americans who served in Cairo from 1929 to 1937 with the Rockefeller Foundation, in the field of research on epidemiology of parasitic diseases in Egypt, and who had close ties with the AUC community.  Dr. Scott studied Arabic through AUC’s School of Oriental Studies, via total language immersion lessons with a sheikh. While were never formally employed by AUC, the Scotts maintained social connections with AUC administrators and faculty, beginning with the welcome they received from President Charles Watson and faculty members when they arrived in Cairo, the kind of greeting typically given to visitors at the time. Mrs. Scott recalls the social life and entertaining done by members of the AUC and American community (for which Mrs. McClenahan was the “matriarch,” she says), relating the role of servants and university staff workers including the AUC gatekeeper. The Scotts observed from the outside how the 1930s Depression affected AUC, causing financial pressures that forced the departure of faculty members (Scott hired on for parasitological field work one AUC short timer made redundant, Hugh Headlee, who went on to an international career in the discipline). AUC’s contributions to Egypt are also discussed, including coeducation of women students, the professional educators trained by its School of Education, and Watson’s promotion of the international exchange of ideas rather than the missionary goal of Christian conversion.
