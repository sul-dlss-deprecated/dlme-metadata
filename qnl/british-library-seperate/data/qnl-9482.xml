It was said in 1947 that the need for fresh water was one of Kuwait's most pressing requirements, and now that the state was in receipt of considerable royalties, Kuwaitis would not be satisfied until the need was met (folio 48).In addition to India Office (later Commonwealth Relations Office) minutes and correspondence, the file includes correspondence from the Political Agent, Kuwait (including emphasis on the need for a British, rather than an American company to undertake the work, folio 48); a proposal that the Associated Ethyl Company of London might be invited to combine their operations with the distillation of water for Kuwait; correspondence with the British Chemical Plant Manufacturers Association, London, and British firms interested in the project; and papers concerning a report on a municipal water supply for Kuwait by Mr Hogg of J.D. &amp; D.M. Watson Limited, Consulting Engineers, for the Shaikh of Kuwait.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Water treatment</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Drinking water</topic></subject><subject><topic>Water supply</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000220#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000220#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000220#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000220#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
