Sir I have the honour to inform you that the Government of India Meteorological Department maintains an Upper Air Observa tory at £ /^ft/TAZ /V and in order to determine upper air conditions hydrogen-filled pilot 'balloons arc let off daily from this oBsorvatory. In connection with this work the observers who arc: stationed there incur contingent expenditure under the following heads :- 1. Cart hire for the transportation of gas tubes (each tube weighing ahout 3 mds. and measuring ahout 6 feet in length) from the railway station to the ohservatory and vice versa.(These tubes filled with hydrogen are sent periodically to the Ohserver- in-charge and the empty tubes are returned 'by him to this obser vatory. 2. Cooly charges for loading and unloading each tube at the station as well as at the observatory. 3. Conveyance hire for encashment of bills. Pay bills as well as other bills of the staff stationed there are sent from this office for encashment at the local treasury and for disburse ment of the moneys to the staff there and for conveyance hire for the following journeys s- ■'Prom Observatory to Bank »» »• •• Treasury ' ' ' H and Bank. Heturn journeys from each of the above places to the observatory if the same conveyance is kept engc? ged. 4. Wages of coolies at monthly and daily rates. 5. Wages of part-time and full-time sweepers.— 6. M M M chowkidars. As some observers stationed at outstation observa^to- ries had in the past committed irregularities in respect of con tingent expenditure it has been thought desirable to obtain from a responsible officer the local current rates for the vr-rious items mentioned above. This would enable us to standardise the contingent expenditure at outstations and thus put a stop to all -rmancm il^cgiriai-l If es. May^l, therefore, request you to take the trouble of letting me know the current local rates fol? each of the foregoing items?

In connection with this work the observers stationed there incur contingent expenditure under the following heads ; 1. Cart hire for the transportation of gas tubes (each tube weighing about 3 mds. and measuring about 6 ft. in length and -J- ft, in breadth) from the railway station to the observa tory and vice versa. (These tubes filled with hydrogen are sent periodically to the Observer-in-charge and the empty tubes are returned by him to t v is Office. 2. Cooly charges for loadi g and unloading each tube at the station as well as at the ^ oservatory. 3. Conveyance hire for one- iment of bills. Pay bills as well as other bills of the s o'aff at are sent from this Office, for encashment at the local treasury and disbursement of the moneys to the staff there. Conveyance hire is therefore paid for the following journeys : i. From the observatory to Bank ii. ' ' ' ' Treasury iii. ' ' !? ' M and Bank, iv. Retrun journeys from each of the above places to the Observatory, if the same conveyance is kept engaged. 4. Wages of coolies at monthly and daily rates. 5. ' M part-time and full-time sweepers. 6.

As this office has to verify their contingent bills and certify that the rates charged are not in excess of local rates, it has been thought desirable to obtain once a year from a responsible officer the ratjs for the various items mentioned above. This enables the contingent expenditure at outstations to be standardised and the requirements of the accounts rules to bo satisfied.

In connection v/ith this work the observers stationed there incur contingent expenditure under the following heads ; 1, Cart hire for the transportation of gas tubes (each tube weighing about 3 mds. and measuring about 6 ft, in length and i ft, in breadth) from the railway station to the observa tory and vice versa. (These tubes filled with hydrogen are sent periodically to the Observer-in-charge and the empty tubes are returned by him to this Office, 2, Cooly charges for loading and unloading each tube at the station as well as at the observatory, 3, Conveyance hire for encashment of bills,. Pay bills as well as other bills of the staff are sent from this Office for ga encashment at the local treasury and disbursement of the moneys to the 'staff there. Conveyance hire is therefore paid for the following journeys : i. From the observatory to Bank ii. ' ' M M Treasury iii. M ' ' ' ' and Bank, iv. Retrun journeys from each of the above places to the Observatory, if the same conveyance is kept engaged. 4, Wages of coolies at monthly and daily rates. 5, ' ' part-time and full-time- sweepers, 6, 11 ' ' 11 ,, chowkidars. As this office has to veri: ' their contingent bills and certify that the rates charged . -o not in excess of local rates, it has been thought desirable to obtain once a year from a responsible officer the rates for the various items mentioned above. This enables the contingent expenditure at outstations to be standardised and the requirements of the accounts rules to bo satisfied. May I, therefore, request you to take the.trouble of letting me know the current local rates for each of the foregoing items. Kindly treat this letter as confidential; your reply may also be sent to me marked confidential. Thanking you, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Iyer/22.3, ; V (X for Suptdg.

These include the rising costs of living in Bahrain, in part a result of the growth of the oil industry, population growth and housing shortages which have caused rent rises; staff changes at the observatory; and ongoing arrangements for the hire and transportation of equipment for the observatory.The correspondence towards the end of the file deals primarily with questions concerning the future of the Bahrain observatory in the wake of Indian independence, and the transfer of the Political Residency to Bahrain. Letters sent by Agency staff to the Residency raise questions over who has responsibility for the observatories at Bahrain and Sharjah, and the duplication of work between the Bahrain observatory and the Royal Air Force observatory at nearby Muharraq (ff 75, 76-82). A letter from the Political Agent, dated 3 November 1948, announces the closure of the Bahrain observatory, with the RAF observatory at Muharraq superseding its operations (ff 86-87). After the closure of the Bahrain observatory, correspondence in the file continues between the Agency and the Meteorological Officer based at the RAF's observatory at Muharraq (ff 90-96).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Upper Air Observatory, Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>RAF Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Meteorology</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0001a9#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
