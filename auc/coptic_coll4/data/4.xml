The letters were written by Saint Anthony to the monks of Kīmān Fāris, or Arsinöe and they feature teachings in the principles of monasticism and urge the monks to pursue the ascetic and spiritual life of devotion. . Known as the Father of Monasticism, Saint Anthony, also referred to as Antonious, was born in Coma, Egypt, near the ancient site of Heracleopolis Magna. He was the proto-hermit and, in spite of his Greek name, was a Copt who spoke only Coptic, even when in conversation with the learned and spiritual master Athanasius (circa .296 - 373 C.E.) who was his biographer.</dc:description><dc:subject>Coptic monasticism and religious orders; Teaching; Sermons</dc:subject><dc:coverage>Kīmān Fāris (deserted settlement); Al-Fayyūm governorate; Egypt; Africa</dc:coverage><dc:date>1770</dc:date><dc:date>1770</dc:date><dc:type>Still Image</dc:type><dc:format>image/jp2</dc:format><dc:format>364 p.; 16.9 x 11.2 cm.</dc:format><dc:format>manuscripts (document genre)</dc:format><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:identifier>SC-2003-01-01-05-6</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Iryan Moftah Coptic Language and Religion Manuscripts</dc:relation><dc:source>Iryan Moftah Collection of Manuscripts; Iryan Moftah Coptic Language and Religion Manuscript and Book Collection; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2013, American University in Cairo.
