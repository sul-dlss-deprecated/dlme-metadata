I feel very sorry that you will not be back here in December to witness the signing of the Treaty but I assure you that I shall remember you at that time and shall always remember that \ you were the first person to negotiate for the New Treaty with us and paved the way for a happy conclusion.

Your sincere friend, Said bin Taimur.mtm My dear Friend, MUSCAT. 14-10-51 I am extremely touched by Your Highness’s kind letter. I have always received such gracious sympathy and patient understanding from Your Highness that my work has always been a pleasure, and my association with Your Highness, both in work and at other times, will be something that I shall always value and remember. Any service which I have succeeded in rendering Your Highness is but a very small repayment of all the happiness that I have had during the past two years* I shall convey Your Highness’s kind message to my wife, and she will join me in thanking Your Highness for everything, and for your good wishes* I should indeed have liked to have witnessed the signing of the Treaty but, In shallah, we shall all see the results in the years to come, and I shall be the first Consul to work •under it.

The following are results of discussion of Consular Article. Clause (l). Sultan wishes to substitute 'Consuls” for 'consular Officers' and will confirm by letter that the term includes Vice-Consul and Acting Consuls. In the second sentence he has called attention to the substitution of 'as Consular Officers' f r 'to Consular Offices' of the present and previous treaties and has asked that either 'he reasons for the change should be explained or that the previous phrasing should be restored.

Article 2(l). Sultan will only agree to draft as it stands if he is given a letter to the effect that 'applicable' means 'which'are in force or may be applied'. He has adopted a similar attitude regarding the second amendment proposed by him in Article 5. I consider it would be simpler to make the amendments on the lines he desires wherever required. Article U. I did not mention reciprocity as Sultan has already stated that he does not want it. Article 5. Sultan is obstinate over auggaotof 'legal' for 'lawful' and I have conceded the point. His other amendments have been discussed under Article 2(1). Article 6(1). Sultan agrees to the treatment of Burma as 'non-foreign' and will await draft of new para(8). Article 7(2). Sultan has agreed to insertion of 'Omani'. Article 12. Sultan will only accept our draft if the- we give him a letter saying that we v/ill accept his decision regarding what is- 'possible' in any particular case. He referred to the wreck of Egyptian vessel 'Star of Mex' a few years ago and its looting by tribesmen and probably fears claim for compensation under draft as it stands if one of our vessels meets similar fate. Although you presumably would not be willing to make him sole arbiter in the manner proposed some formula might be evolved which would satisfy him. Personally I consider his draft adequate for practical /purposespurposes though r e might press for the addition of some such phrase es ’’and shall take all possible steps to recover and restore all property carried by such vessels and aircraft or belonging to their crews and passengers 1 '. 2 .

The principles of International Law and practice are not very precise about functions of Consuls except as regards their general right to | look after interests of nationals of sending state. In certain countries however the functions which Consuls may perform are now laid down in bilateral conventions. 2. Since we are not negotiating a detailed convention v* I with Muscat we thought it convenient to include paragraph 3 in order to avoid necessity for lengthy enquiry into practice elsewhere when Consul wished to do something to which authorities of state had no objection. For example the Consul might wish to act as interpreter for one of his nationals in court a function specifically o ovided for in our convention with Norway and one to which vie assume the Sultan would not object. 3. 0.

My immediately preced ng telegram. Article 1. (1) We will amend definitions in paragraph 3 and para graph 4 so as to cover only vessels and aircraft registered in the United Kingdom and ’’any territories to which treaty applies by reason of extension under Article 15.' (2) We will provide lists of territories eligible under Article 15 and of categories of British Protected Pers ^ns. (3) We will accept Sultan’s other amendments to oara- graph 3, paragraph 4 and paragraph 5. Article 2(1): We consider Sultan’s amendment (which is not in oresent treaty) to line eight unnecessary since it adds nothing sensOfcte. If adopted it should logically involve similar amendments elsewhere e.g. Article 3(1) and ( 2 ). We hope Sultan will accept our assurance on this point.

They were therefore added here for sake of completeness but do /not/V - 2 - 'IT' not alter sense of remainder of sentence. The expression 'All kinds of Toods' has same meaning as passage from 'go^ds' to 'export' in Sultan 1 s version. It should Toe exolained to him that this sentence is merely a particularization of rights et cetera with regard to commerce which are given in Article 3(1) and we w^uld now prefer for sake of clarity to have substance of sentence transferred to Article 3(1) in which we would exoressly mention 'bargaining, bartering, buying, selling, importing and exporting'. If however Sultan is not prepared to agree to th^s transfer or wants to reduce enumeration, we would prefer to omit sentence altogether. In this event it should be made ?clear to him that importing and exporting are covered generally terms of Article 3(1). Paragraph 2 may be omitted. Article 3. We agree in principle to make Article reciprocal. There are however certain difficulties arising from different circumstances in some of the colonies and from our own tax ation regulations and arrangements, which make it necessary for us to consider making minor modifications to drafts. We will send you further instructions about this. Article 4. (1) We accept Sultan’s redraft paragraph (l). For your information we have now discovered certain difficulties ab^ut making this reciprocal as it stands J (2) We agree t) omit paragraph /(O o Article 5.

We will add a new paragraph 8 to meet this point. (2) We can meet Sultans requests in ^paragraph!*, paragraphs and paragraph 7 Article 7. (l) We regard insertion of ”classification 1 ' as of some importance since goods might Toe quite correctly valued and yet valued- classified for duty at wrong rate. The latter # could not he rectified hy arbitration on value alone. Please try to get to agree. (2) If words 'of Sultan' are omitted it seems necessary to insert 'Omani' before 'customs authorities .

We can agree in principle tp make this reciprocal but we may in this case wish to include in paragraph 3 a further exception to c iver balance of payment^ diffi culties.

In particular you should explain difficulty arising from existing most favoured nation clauses of our treaties with other c unt ries. from complexity of our own taxation laws and arrangements and from our need to take into account circumstances in colonies as well as in United Kingdom. 2.

We hooe Sultan will be content with restricted definitions in paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 Article 1 and list of territories covered by Article 15 and will not ask similar restrictwss- definitions of citizen of United Kingdom and Colonies in paragraph 2. If he does ' V /ask2 ask it should he exolained to him that there is no citizen ship of individual colonies; citizenship of United Kingdom and Colonies is an indivisible conception in United King dom laws. It is therefore extremely difficult to differ entiate persons belonging to United Kingdom and to each separate colony, although same difficulty does not arise with regard to definition ships and aircraft. If Sultan insists we could put forward a definition drafted on basis accenting persons domiciled territories to which treaty has n^t been extended. This should not be offered to Sultan without further reference to us. Any definition however which would be acceptable to us w uld cover any Khojas who may become citizens of United Kingdom and Colonies and who are not or do not bee me nationals of Muscat. 4. We should be unwilling to agree to a duration less than twelve years for treaty and you should try to get Sultan to accent twenty years. 5. We agree that you should negotiate further prolong ation present treaty if possible until 31st December as proposed in your letter 16420/31G. It may be necessary to exchange letters with Sultan amending period previously agreed and we assume Sultan would wish India to be covered by any new extensions he accepts. 7e have asked Government of India whether they have any objection. 6.

Since however the Political Resident is due to leave for Muscat on the 6th October, we have drawn up the necessary amendments to the draft letter on jurisdiction enclosed with Furlonge’s letter EA 1645/7 of the 7th June and I enclose copies of tlr* amendments which are required. These amendments are based on all the information we have so far received including that contained in Muscat telegram No. 181 of the 29th September to you. We have thought it necessary to do this in spite of paragraph 3 of this telegram in advance of receiving the draft referred to in Muscat telegram to. 174 of the 23rd September to you since it is necessary to be precise in the definition of the extent of o r jurisdiction and we are doubtful, from the information we have so far received, whether the wording of the Sultan's draft, although expressing his general intention, will be sufficiently accurate for legal purposes, Without seeing his draft however we have not been able to suggest modificAtions to paragraph ( 4 ) of the previous draft, nor to the former paragraphs (5) and (6). 3. With these amendments the draft provides for us to exercise jurisdiction over Australians, Canadians, New iSealanders, South Africans and Pakistanis on the same terms as Indians and Sinhalese. Although the Sultan might be prepared to allow us similar jurisdiction over non-Asiatic British subjects as over United Kingdom citizens we could not of course discriminate in this way between the independent 00 untried of the Conmon- wealth. As you are aware, however, only India and Ceylon asked us to try to retain jurisdiction over their nationals and we are not at present certain whether the other countries would now wish to be included. Tills may mean a modication of the new sub-paragraph (d) of paragraph (1) of the draft letter but we will inform you by telegram of this. 4. We have now received ’Muscat telegram No. 184 of the 30th September to you containing the requests which the Sultan wishes us to grant if we accept his proposal No. 2, As you appreciate each of these requests concerns a different department here and it may take us a little time to decide w*hat our answer Trill be. Meanwhile the Thole question whether or not we can accept proposal No. 2 as the Sultan has put it to us and on the basis of his requests must remain subject to confirmation. Tours sincerely. (C.M.

Foreign Office, S.W. 1, 2nd October, 1931. CONFIDENTIAL Dear Martin, We are considering here the Sultan’s comments on the draft Treaty which were given in the notes enclosed with belly’s Despatch No. 115 (1041/61) of the 9th September. 2. We are holding a meeting on 4th October to discuss these comments after which we shall Sir Rupert’s reply to the Sultan when he goefc to Muscat. In order to facilitate the tranmission of these Instructions I have drawn up the enclosed note of provisional views on the comments. I propose that when telegraphing instructions we should refer to the paragraphs in this note. I should however make it clear that the views expressed in the note are at present entirely provisional and are subject to confirmation or otherwise as a result of our interdepartmental discussions here. 3. We have no objection to meeting the Sultan’s request reported in paragraph 8 of Muscat telegram No* 80 of the 23rd September to you in which the Sultan requests the insertion of the word ’’friendship' in the reference to the 1939 Treaty in the Preamble of the new Treaty and in the title of the new Treaty itself. 4. In the enclosed note I have not dealt with any amendment which may be required to Article 1(2) of the Treaty if the Sultan wishes to break down the expression 'citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies' so as to cover only persons who derive their citizenship from territories to which the Treaty has been extended. This is not easy as you will have seen from our telegram No. 512 of the 27th September and the suggestion made in paragraph 3 of Muscat telegram No. 81 of the 29th September to you does not quite meet the particular problem which is involved here. We can of course provide a list of the classes of people included in the expression 'British Protected Persons”, but hope that we shall be able to retain 'citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies' without further interpretation. We will however do our best to draft some formula in case the Sultan should insist upon it, but so far in other contexts the drafting of a satisfactory formula has eluded us. Yours sincerely, (Signed) C.M. Rose. C.M.

However trivial these and other differences may seem, an it is exceedingly difficult to arrive at simple enough warding and compromise without altering force of provisions I hope wherever possible Sultan T s choice will be accepted. It will probably simplify the Arabic translation anyhow, and relieve Sultan T s mind. 5. The Sultan has repeatedly assured me that he has no intention of changing the existing privileges et cetera accorded to our Consuls but simply wants to be able to decide any issue in future upon a basis of international practice. I am convinced of the bona fides of his intentions and so have now recommended, that we should drop anything . . .drop anything more elaborate whilst we are not in fact providing anything less in this connection than we have under present Treaty. CHAUNCY. C'si %h).iflDSHTIAL - The Political Agent, Muscat* WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OF HIS MAJESTY’S POLITICAL RESIDENCYCOPY (EA 1053/58) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1* JONFIDENTIAL Dear Sir Rupert, The sultan’s decision that he wishes to have the provisions relating to Consuls regulated in the Treaty as reported in Felly’s letter No. 1041/82 of 9th September considerably simplifies our drafting problem. r/e cannot hov/ever entirely agree to the proposal he makes, in his letter to Chauncy of 2nd September since, for the reasons given in Furlonge’s letter EA 1053/35 of 24th July, we are particularly anxious to avoid the retention of a Host Favoured Nation clause in any Article relating to Consular matters. 2. After further consideration we have come to the conclusion tSiat the difficulties we mentioned to you about the inclusion of an Article in the Treaty as opposed to a seoarate Consular convention are not so strong as we thought at first. The Consular conventions Act deals mainly with the inviolability of Consular premises, and the representation by the Consul under power of attorney Ox the interests of a national of the sending state in an estate. In uractice it is not likely that either of these things will be required in the foreseeable future by a Consular Officer appointed by the Sultan; our own Consul’s position is not affected by the Act, but in any case both provisions will be sufficiently covered by our retention of jurisdict ion and powers relating to entry of premises. 3. v/e have therefore drafted a simple Article for inclusion in the Treaty based on Article 14 of the draft protocol forwarded with Furlonge’s letter of 24th July under the terms of which the functions, privileges and immunities of the consular Officers are governed by reci procity and international law and practice. This has not yet been finally cleared with the various Departments here, but I am sending you a copy now in case you have any comments to make. We suggest that this should be included between the present Articles 11 and 12. 4. We have assumed from Pe^Lly 1 s letter/bf 9th September, paragraph 3(c) of LIuscat telegram l ( o.1b2 to you anu para graph 4 'of Muscat telegram No. 174 to you that you do not now'consider it necessary to specify any particular functions or privileges which are to be exercised or enjoyed by our Consul in Muscat (with of course reciprocal effect).

His Foreign Minister previously suggested to Sultan that he might introduce some law regarding oroperty but Sulteh does not want this nor do I think it would be a very happy solution,^although Sultan would not agree to inclusion of British subjects who are potential Pakistanis or Indians in the first clause of Proposal two, he might agree to their benefiting by the Treaty, as in due course India and perhaps various Dominions will have similar Treaties, but I am sure he would not grant any other c yuntry extra-territorial jurisdiction.

Wy ovm view is that the looser th^’s is kept the better, and we have had no cause for complaint hitherto, in fact quite the contrary. (d) Sultan recognises as Principle of International Law that Military Forces carry extra territoriality with them vide section 445 page 662 Oppenheim Volume I. (e) he recognises some special arrangements would have to be worked out at the time should we not exercise extra territorial jurisdiction when and if oil company commenced operations. (f) Burial and disposal of the estates of deceased nationals is left to the Consul concerned in Sultanate anyhow. (g) Similarly settled cases cannot be re-opened. 4. It seems unnecessary therefore for any of these points to be expressly provided forjln Treaty or by protocol even if jurisdiction is not continued though they might be covered by some separate letter, if desired. I do not think Muscat Government would ever create any difficulty over them but Sultan always dislikes committing himself to writing. CHAUNCYDuring his discussions with the Sultan of SSuscat about the new draft Treaty of Conmerce and Havigation,Chauncy received a letter from him on —the subject of Consuls of which I enclose a copy, and he acknowledged it promising to inform His Majesty's Government of its contents. (Your letter Ho. EA 1053/52 dated 4th September, 1951 refers). C i ■ 2. It is now certain that the Sultan has decided that he wishes to have the whole matter about Con suls regulated in the treaty and not to have a separate Convention. This view does not seem so very far away from that expressed in paragraph 3 of your letter where you say that if we are not going to propose a detailed convention,you would prefer some thing shorter consisting of about three articles. In reading the details you envisage of this, It seems to me that the first two could easily form one art icle and the third would not be needed if such an article were part of the Commercial Treaty. If you accept this then perhaps a single article could be drafted for Inclusion in the treaty,about which I have written a separate despatch giving my comments r ' on the results of Chauncy’s discussion and/that the 4 amendments nroposed by the Sultan be accepted, ^men we again discuss them with the Sultan it would be a great advantage if we could inform him that we have acceded to his wishes on the subject of Consuls. 3. Exemption from customs charges has hitherto been dealt with by an exchange of letters and the points raised in paragraphs 5 and 6 of your letter wfcould 7, J presumably be dealt wlthZthe same way if the oult*B did not wish to include them in the treaty, b - however the arrangements would presumably be'reciprocal, I do not think we need assume that he would not wish to. 4. As regards your paragraph 7, I do not think that it would be necessary to have any provision that our Consul may perform functions In respect of nationals of other Commonwealth countries, fcor do X think that the Sultan would raise the point or that any such difficulty as mentioned in your last sentence is likely to arise. H. Saner, Esc^.. O.B.E., Eastern Department, Foreign Office, London. (C. J. Felly)BRITISH R3SIJ3HCY, BAHRAIN. 9th September, 1951* &lt;&gt; J Sir, In accordance with the orders conve 3 r ed in the Secretary of State*s despatch No.124 of the 13th August, 1951&gt; I asked Major Uhauncy to open negotiations with the Sultan of Muscat for the new Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, and I enclose copies of his ’’notes on the amendments required by the Sultan” (in our draft of the Treaty) which embody the results of his discussions with His Highness. 2. Major Chauncy reports that the Sultan went through the draft very carefully and, as you will see, he has asked for a large number of amendments to all of which we might, I think reasonably agree. Most of them seen to have been asked for as a result either of the Sultan’s anxiety for reciprocity, which is bound up with considerations of his prestige, or because of his attach ment to the forms of the 1939 treaty. They do not seem to affect our likely practical requirements and I would therefore urge that any resulting theoritical imperfections be, as far as poss ible, disregarded. It will be recalled that the 1939 Treaty worked well and had seldom, if ever, to be invoked. My comments follow on such amendments as may be difficult to accept. Article 1 . I think it very difficult in principle to deny the Sultan* s argument that only the citizens of those territories to whom the Treaty has been extended under Article 15 should enjoy the rights which it confers, and the addition of the words which he proposes ('and to which the present Treaty has been extended under Article 15 1, ) would not seem to raise any insuper able difficulties at any rate in Articles I (1), (3) and (4). Nor do I see any difficulty in giving him a list of the count ries eligible for the extension of the Treaty in connexion with Articles I (1), (3)» (4) and (5). Article I (2). The question of the Khojas (as discussed at paragraph 7 of Mr. Furlonge’s letter No.HA 1645/7 of the 7th June to Sir Rupert Hay and paragraph 5 of Mr. Atlee’s despatch No. 1.10 of the 24th July) seems to involve some difficulty, not, of course, because they are 'Stateless” but because, as Major Chauncy suggests in a separate report, the Sultan does not seem inclined to extend the benefits of the Treaty to them whether they become citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies or not. If he persists in this, it may be necessary to add ’’Muslims born in Muscat' to the exceptions in this paragraph. Article II (1; last sentence. I agree with the Sultan’s view of the result of adding ”(to) import and export. If we are only concerned that Muscat’s trading in British territories shall be subject to the same regulations as the nationals of those territories, then the criterion seems to be met by the alternative version preferred by the Sultan. Article II (2). I do not agree with Major Chauncy that this clause is better omitted, though I sympathise with the /Sultan’s Rt. Hon’ble C.R. Attlee, C.H. , M.P. , Foreign Office, London. a, / Desoatch No. 115 (1CV/81) COITFI DISrlTI AL- 2 - V- ) Sultan’s dislike of it. But the chances of a Muscat’s being engaged in a trade in a British territory which the Government might wish to monopolise seem small enough to warrant eueh the risk of granting reciprocity. Article IV (2). It is conceded in paragraph 8 of Mr. Attlee’s despatch just quoted that the point might be regarded as covered by the preceding articles. I think we might well rely on them and omit this. Article VI (1) and (2). I sympathise with the Sultan's requeat (paragraph 6 of the despatch refers). Article VI (4). There seems no necessity to alter the corresponding articles in the 1939 Treaty (paragraph 9 of the despatch refers). Article VI (7). I think we could concede the point (paragraph 3 of Mr. Attlee’s despatch No. 124 of the l_/th August is relevant). Article VII (3)« I think we could well let 'classific- ation” go. As Major Chauncy says, the Sultan has conceded the principal of arbitration and I should not have expected the experts to draw any very nice distinction between value and classification. (Paragraph 10 of Mr. Attlee’s despatch No.110 of the 24th July refers.) Article VIII. I think we could let this go. Article X. I cannot find any authority for Major Chauncy’s understanding that there is no objection to this being made reciprocal — nor can I see any objection. Article XII. I agree with the Sultan and Major Chauncy. Article XVI. It seems impossible to insist upon the^ retention of this article (cf. comment on Article I above). 4. Major Chauncy has also discussed with the Sultan the question of extra-territoriality on the lines indicated in . Mr. Attlee’s despatch No. 123 of the 13th August, 1931. It is relevant to mention this here because in spite of the arguments to which the Sultan gave a patient hearing, the only result was that he insisted that he must have time to come to a decision and Major Chauncy’s opinion is that he wishes to com plete the Treaty before giving such a decision though he adds that in the end he will refuse the retention of any extra territoriality. It may be, hov/ever, that an early decision on the Treaty will induce in him a more favourable frame of mind and in any case Major Chauncy states that it will verj' greatly impress the Sultan as he has hitherto felt that we have been somewhat dilatory. He says also that on the conclus ion of the Treaty the Sultan would have no justification for not making up his mind on the question of extra territoriality. My own idea, however, is that the Sultan s inflated idea of ns prestige inspires him to take as long in giving his decision upon the Treaty as we have been in preparing the draft. He has indicated too that unless Article 5 of the 1939 Treaty is retained instead of the relevant part of Article 6 of the draft, he will require to consult his Director General of Customs who is now on leave and may not return until middle of this month. 3.

Similarly in Article 1(2) for the words 'and all British Protected Persons' the words 'and all nationals of other territories of His Majesty' could be substituted, unless it is still desired to include British subjects without Citizenship or of no specific territory. In any case the Sultan will require lists, £ will seek to exclude at least KHOJAS, who might otherwise be included in due course as Citizens of the United Kingdom, by adding 'Muslims born in the Sultanate', or some such formula, to the list of excluded persons viz. nationals of BahVain, Kowait etcetera.

As regards the substitution of the word 'legal” used in the present Treaty for 'lawful usea in the draft of the new Treaty, I thought yesterday that he had accepted the fact that the words had identical signifance, but since he desires the word “legal” to be used I presume that there can be no objection, and I hove now included this in my note on* the amendments require! by the Sultan for war ed with ray earlier despatch of the sarae dace. / ■ -pat Hi IMM if MM MMMtJJ des jatchee but the ’ooil ©teomer is leaving, and there is no time to redraft the whole correspondence.

His Highness Sultan Said bin Tsimur, Sultan of Muscat &amp; Oman, Muscat.17. 5WK75T. H.B. M* s Consulate and Political Agency, MUSCAT. 2nd September, 1951 Sir, I have the honour to state that since drafting my Despatch No. 15. (57/8/65/51), I have received a note from the Sultan stating that'as Consuls are connected with Commerce according to International Law, therefore I shall he pleased to have the old article 11 in the New Teeaty as it stands and add to it the following :- ’that points in this respect which are not covered by this article shall be dealt with in accordance with International Law’ The above is very essential to be in the New Treaty”. 2. This possibility was envisaged by His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, and as we have no convenient Consular Convention to show, and since the Sultan now feels so strongly on the point, perhaps there will be no objection to agreeing. 3. The Sultan appears to follow Oppenheim’s Treatise, and I can myself see no difficulty over conceding the Sultan’s wishes. 4. The Sultan has also informed me that he still / wants to consult his Director General of Customs concerning some matters affecting Customs. As stated in my first despatch the Director General is on leave and may not return until the middle of this month. If the Sultan’s points enumerated in the enclosures to my despatch are met, I cannot think that there will be anything to affect the substance of the Treaty which will be required. At all events in view of the far more important alterations which the Sultan definitely desires, it seeiras essential to consider these points without delay, and I could telegraph further amendments, if the Sultan desires any. 5. I think I should mention that, in my own opinion all this adds up to the Sultan’s endeavouring to complete the Treaty before imparting his decision about extra territorial jurisdiction, and that in the end he will refuse the latter. But since we are not prepared to with-hold the Treaty or risk any breach in our relations with the Sultan, it seems that there is nothing for us to do but to accept the position. I do not think he will even His Excellency the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.X(T$ - 2 - tiyill even agree to any “eafeguards”, other than are ^—^. provided 'by International Law and usa ^ e , - _ wi the normal fimctipning / of Consuls f 5'7Cc * M h±*i‘* K ^*r aLM ' 'UfM**'* a A &lt;~T^' Copies of the Sultan’s letter of the 2nd September and of my reply are enclosed for information.

My dear Friend, Thank you for Your Highness’s letter of today’s date. 2. I note that Your Highness wishes to have the article 11 of the present Treaty included in the new Treaty, with the addition mentioned. I assume from this that Your Highness does not wish any further protocol to the Treaty or similar document regarding the subject of Consuls, and, subject to Your Highness’s confirmation, I will advise His Majesty’s Government accordingly. 3. With regard to the second matter mentioned in Your Highness’s letter, I gathered from Your Highness yesterday that, if all Your Highness’s points were met, Your Highness would not require to4wait the return of Your Highness’s Director General of Customs. 4. I had accordingly drafted desoatches informing His Majesty’s Government of all Yiur Highness’s points, and recommending t %t^ fresh draft should be forwarded for Your Highness’s\consideration. As the question of the complete omission of the new article 16 has arisen, and several other complicated matters concerning the definition of British Protected Persons and Territories f^r the international relationship of which His Majesty is responsible through His Government in the United Kingdom, it seems very advisable for the revision to be proceeded with without any delay. 5. I am / however, informing His Majesty’s Government iaowo-^r that Your Highness still requir s to consult Your Highness’s Director General of Customs on his return, and if^Your Highness has further amendments to prjpose^I could telegraph them. 6. In any case the whole revised draft will be subject to Your Highness’s approval, and I only wish to make as sure as possible that I am correctly representing Your Highness’s views and am advising His Majesty’s Government of what will meet Your Highness’s wishes, so that, if toey can be met, further alterations may be reduced to as few as possible. Your Highness’s sincere friend, Sd/- P. C.L. Chauncy. His Highness Sultan Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat &amp; Oman, MUSCAT*ORGBHT &amp; CONFIDENTIAL. 15- 57/6/65/51 H. B, M* e Consulate and Political Agency, MUSCAT . 2nd Septemter Muscat Treaty Negotiations. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your despatch No. 5 dated the 2Uth August 1951, and to forward herewith three copies of a note containing the amendments desired hy the Sultan to the draft Treaty of Comnerce and Navigation received with the despatch under reference. The note also contains my comments upon these amendments and the Sultan’s attitude, and . gives, I trust, a coherent account of the result of my negotiations so far. I also enclose three copies of the aide-memoire which I left with the Sultan, to whom I had also forwarded a copy of the draft with my letters asking for an interview, and informing him that I had heen appointed to negotiate. 2. The Sultan has studied the matter very carefully and together we have 'been through every word of it. I do not think it will he possible to persuade him to reduce any of his demands further. He gave way on a number of points, some trivial, but some, for him, quite big. On what remains he appears to be adamant, and I can think of no means of persuading him to alter his views that I have not already tried. In fact my general opinion is that he is not being unreasonable, and that it should not be impossible to accede, to his demands, even if they are awkward or if the result falls short of all that it was hoped to achieve. Broadly speaking, I think we have obtained all that we shall need in practice (even allowing for the ommision of certain territories and people;, whilst on his side the Sultan will be much happier and more co-operative. 3. The only dausesin which the Sultan asks for „ reciprocity which may prove embarrassing is that relat ing to monopolies, which it seems could be dropped, and those in which benefits are provider for*r territorie for the international relations of which His Majesty is responsible through His Government in the United Kingdom. In the latter case the only remedy seems to be to confine the treaty to those territories to which the treaty is extended by Article 15, and thus to give the Sultan full reciprocity throughout, except where he has specifically stated he does not want it. 4. The question of British subjects without citizenship, also arises. At present I can only think of the Khojas and Anglo-Indiaiis likely to be affected if no His Excellency the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.if no ‘benefits are to extend to them until they become Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. Even then it is not clear of what territory they can be regarded as citizens, if all the Treaty is not extended to all the Co.lonial territories under Article 15. 5. I have attempted a list of the Commonwealth countries. Colonies End Protectorates and Trusteeships and condominions. I should be glad if this could be verified, and of instructions whether I may forward it, or a corrected copy, to the Sultan and explain that those countries listed as Colonies, Protectorates, T.K. Trusteeships, and Condominions are the territories eligible under Article 15, and for the international relationship which His Majesty is responsible through His Government in the United Kingdom. Also that British Protected Persons are citizens of the Countries listed as Protectorates, U.K* Trusteeships and con- dominions, and also British subjects without citizen ship pending the promulgation of certain nationality laws. 6. I fear that the Sultan has no intention of extending the Treaty to persons of the last category, having in mind specially the case of the Khojas. If that is his intention it seems that there is little that we can do about it. At the most I think the Sultan might agree to the same formula as may be proposed in the case if extra territoriality, namely excepting those Muslims born in Muscat. In any event such persons would be no w rse off than the nationals of the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms and in spite of their claim to being British subjects, have for generations^ had nothing to distinguish them from the other half of their community in Muscat who are Sultanate subjects. 7. The few Anglo-Indians in the Sultanate will not be affected by the Commercial Treaty in any case. If the Sultan agrees to the suggested formula they and any others would be covered. S # In every case where the Sultan has asked for simplification or retention of original wording, I earnestly recommended that this be complied with, can convinced that the response or result is likely to be much greater, thaii in any attempt to filaborate^ or safeguard against every possible contingency: we have had little or no trouble in the past. Moreover, this is a small state, and whilst it is most necessary to avoid anything which the Sultan may feel may affect, his prestige, or dignity, of which he is perhaps unduly careful and sensitive, he is becoming very approachable, and, as a result of the high precedence which he accords to the Consul, and the close contact which he maintains\ with him, personal and effective representation in any\ matters affecting British interests ispot at all difo.— icult. The Sultan is m6st responsive to tactful and generous and friendly treatment. lie is very fond of the British and values his and-his forefathers long / association with / /association with them, nor is he unmindful of what his dynasty owes to them. But any attempt to brow beat him or to obtain crippling or unduly binding under takings from him will be resented and met with evasion j or complete refusal. In my conaid red opinion, the beet results will be achieved by agreeing to take what tie voluntarily and readily gives, and, hence, as far as it is at all possible, I would suggest toat the draft as he now wants it amended should be accepted. 9 # I am reporting separately on the epicction of extra-territ &gt;rial rights. 10. I regret that o#ing to the shortness of time, and the Sultan’s evident reluctance to agree to a farther extension, I have had to submit this in haste to catch this week’s mail. I think it will very greatly impress the Sultan, who hitherto has felt that we have been somewhat dilatory over the preparation of the draft, if I am able to present him with its finalised form by a very early date. We have ourselves had it in our hands only six days. I have the honour to be Sir, Your obedient servant. Sd/- P.C.L. Chauncy. MC.

He pre.'rrs the old wording, and considers that redrafting with the words ’’import and export all kinds of goods” alters the whole sense, whilst -rticle 10 ^ill cover the question of Importing and exportings this article Is meant to cover buying ad selling only.

It is not likely thu*t either art. wi]J. treat/-tr&lt;*at its own nationals l«sa favourably than foreigners, and the fultan confir .ed this os far as he • ao conc^rTied.

Certain possibilities were poiftod out, to him with regard to the existing landing contract, a d occasiojtsl attempts at preferential treatment b; the contract or of the ships for which he is the a^ent• It vras also suggested tliat the sol** righto to deal in certain conned ities, such as fish and fish neal couhd be given to his own subjects, wh'ch would immediately tYcrcw certain long establisbed Tritish firms out. of business. The f.tjltan would not agree th t he would countenance any such thing. If any person did not work his contract fairly, that was a matter for representation, and for the rest he had stated that his policy was net to inner!a any proper comjietition, but to encourage it. He had objected to the inclusion of this clause in the 1939 draft, but had eventually given way. I?is objection was tliat it made it look as if the ultan was given to such practices of discrimination, .nd lie felt that it was totally unn tt cessar; , but if it was desired to pre.s for it, then he would only agree to its being retained if it were made strictly reciprocal for all territories to which tie treaty extended. In the circumstances it would seem advisable to leave it cut. AHTICLK 3 (1) &amp; (2) The fultan wants reciprocity in both clauses of this rticlo.

If tliey were, than why should he preclude himself from them in the unforeseeable future?^! in view of his mat emphatic refusal to agree to this addition, it would seem best to rely uj&gt;on his assurances and the provisions to which he will agree* If clause (2) is omitted, the figure (1) should be omitted* As th* Sultan only wants reciprocity over the present draft Article (3)* the clause of Article 4 remaining should be left as Article 4, and not revert to Article 3.

The Sultan agreed that the discrimination over immovable property arose out of our exercise of jurisdiction over British subjects, and it was pointed out that we might/'■ &gt;. might aak for thm reaovnl of thi« if jurisdiction were surrendered, ;i '■ 6 Th® Multan wants clauses (1) and (2) nada reciprocal, (4) Tha Sultan dislikes the whole of the redraft of this part of former Article 5* he says that the latter was arrived at when he was in England after discussion between his own Customs Official and a representative of Rls faj©sty f s Customs, or (probably) Poard of Trade, He took no part in it, and if there are to be any change® ha will have to study and go into it all very carefully and it would take considerable time, especially as his Director General is on leave, and he would have to await his return. He does not a^ee that apy extension of the periods provided in the 1939 Treaty are necessary, and it has not been possible to cite any instances brought to notice locally, lie particularly noticed the omission of the words 'Ships* and 'Aircraft* in the new draft clause (d), and objected. He states that Ships and Aircraft come and go, but for any ground installation or permanent personnel special agreements at the time of obtaining pertaissie** fer them to come would be required* He does not in fact levy any charges in respect of the shore requirements of the Naval base at Khor Kuwai or the R.A.F. personnel at Hasirah and Salalah nor does he contemplate this, but he is prepared to widen the scope of the existing Treaty in this respect. As the former clauses 4(a) to (d) have served hitherto end the Sultan is likely to be very difficult over any revision, perhaps it can be substituted for the new draft clauses 4 (a) to (e), (5) and (6) Ho comrients» en/- ■■■■■■■■■■■■T (7) Th« Sultan wishes the previous clause (7) to be retained, except for the words •it being understood that all such fees will be assessed on a reasonable scale 1 ** Again he objects to anything which implies that he would do anything unreasonable* It is suggested that the Sultan *8 wishes should be met, in the latter case for the reason given by the Sultan, and in the former, as the definition does appear to clarify the question of what charges are and to prevent other new levies being devised* ARTICLE 7 (3) The Sultan wishes the words 'of the Sultan* omitted as unnecessary and, for a not very obvious reason, as more in keeping with his dignity* The omission appears Innocuous, and it is suggested should be accepted* He also wants the word 'classification' omitted* He fears that this may give rise to all sorts of arguments and representations, though he could not instance any. Various instances to illustrate why it was desirable to Include it were given, but the Sultan does not wish to risk it, whilst he considers that if any valuation is disputed as a result of wrong classification, the person concerned can claim arbitration on the ground of wrong valuation, and it is for the experts to arrive at the correct value, even if this entails revising some faulty classification made by the Customs authority* No instance of any dispute having reached a stage of appeal could be recalled, and it is suggested that the clause be confined to 'value'* At least the Sultan has accepted the principal of arbitration by experts* ARTICLE 8 The Sultan does not want this Article at all* Obviously he regards himself entitled to levy these fees if and when he requires/AffTm-U. AlgICLB 12 t requires to. lie levies no dues at all at present and tliare is nothing to indicate tli«t he prnpmmi to. But if he does, it neesss tbit he does not intend to tie himself down as to how he expends such income, nor does it aeeta that we can have an&amp;'tMng to aay in this, since we adrait his right to levy dues, and would have no part in or control over ary board. #o cooneots. The Sultan wants thi* article to be md* reciprocal. It is understood that there is no objection to this. No a«ac**nta. The Dultim considers th&amp;t this Article Is f«r too long an! elaborate, and quite unneceaaaxy. Be suggests that a brief iirticls in gensrcl terms such as fdilowe would affiles , and be acceptable to hiw:- 'Vaoh Mtfti Contracting :&gt; erty shall accord to vessels aircraft f nnd their crews and passengers, of the oth*r h±gk Contracting ?*rty which my be in distress in any of the other*a territories or territorial waters such proper assistance and succour as is possible and in accordance with normal international custom and usage'. Be cannot, in particular, bind himself to reach and pertiit robbers and other a in parts of his ter it cries which are inaccessible or out of his control.. Put he is agreeable to do hie best just- as other governments would in accordance with international law or practice, and in the cause of hiremity. As the only alternative he offers is to emit the vhole clause, and leave it to international custom and usage, and notices and repre sentation at the time, it seenr that sons acknowledgement in the Treaty of h*a responsibilities such as is proposed. is better than none, and should in fact serve. Even ifagrr&amp;Lia ^igi£JLS he did a'jpr^e to the full propoeel artlclo, it la doubtful if we ebould, in result, gain anything more than fran tht suggested short on*.

Fe does not »ee why a territory not, taking advantage of Article 15 should rwaive the benefits of this Treaty* It was impossible to »ove him from this standpoint* The Stiltan started by BWftwetinp that in this aodern changing world the term of 12 years was too long* It was pointed out that the lengthy business involved on His J4sjesty’* (Wivsrnaent * a side of consulting the various/-varloua n^rabera of to iaorwrralth # Colon!©a etc* rendared short term tr«eitiea tmdaalr&amp;hla, and tiiat avon v a longer tara of a&amp;y, twenty yearn, would be acceptable to Hie Hajeaty’a 'ovemaent* The Multan did not aeem to wiah to oproae thia view, and aald that the poreclae tern could be decided after the final draft waa arrived at. It oaeuia tiiat it could even be left blank for diecuaalon and completion at the tiea of signature. It ia not thought that the Sultan would insist cm leas than twelve or at the least ten years, and will very likely agree to longer if all his wishes are new wet, and we really deeire it ourselves The word 'Saiyid* in the seventh line from the end should be omitted. The Sultan wishes to be described in all documents and correspondence as 'Sultan Said bin Talmur bln Ffciael'. The Sultan noted that the English text should prevail and observed that waa why he wishes to be and was being so careful over the wording. At all events he did not object to thia proviso.tki Colonies ?' f Aden Colony Bermudas British Ouiana British Hondorue British Test Indies Cyprus Kr tlkland Islands Fiji Islands Gambia Gibraltar Gilbert A Ellice Islands Gold Coast with Ashanti &amp; Northern territories.

I have the honour now to transmit (a) Three copies of the final version of the draft treaty of Commerce and u Navigation. (t&gt;) A copy of the Secretary of ‘'’tate’s despatch No. 123 (EA 1645/10) of ^ August 13th about our retention of extra-territorial jurisdiction in Muscat. The Secretary of State's despatch No 110 (EA 1053/11) of July 24 th about the preliminary draft of a new treaty for negotiation with the Sultan of Muscat. The draft treaty enclosed therewith. Sir Rupert' Hay's despatch No .96 (1041/62) of July 28th to the Secretary of State commenting on the l two documents mentioned above. I shall be grateful if you will open negotiations with the Sultan of Muscat as soon as possible on the basis of the draft treaty enclosed and if you will discuss with the Sultan the question of extra-territorial jurisdiction on the lines laid down in the Secretary of State's despatch. 3. With regard to the draft treaty the Secretary of State has written as follows : 'You will note that the present draft contains no ** provision at the end of Article 6 ( 7 ) for a definition of the word 'charges” such as that which was included in Article 5 ( 7 ) of the former treaty. The former definition was unsatisfactory and difficulty has been found in drafting a satisfactory new one. Unless therefore you consider there is any risk of the ' Sultan in fact levying some totally new form of charge in order to get round the provision of the article as it now stands, the draft article can remain.' 'There is no objection to the Treaty remaining in force for a period of twenty years if you consider that the Sultan will accept this amendment.' $ &lt;-{3 'With reference to paragraph 3 of you despatch, we can await an actual request from the S Itan, but in the meanwhile no doubt Major Uhauncy will be able to point out the general advantages which the Sultan derives from his T re aty relations with ourselves, including the existing arrangements for the supply of munitions.' /- Subject Political Agent, Muscat.Subject to your views I am inclined to agree that there is now need to add to -Article 6 a definition of the word 'charges”. I am. Sir.No. T23. (b,. 1645 / 10 ) CONFIDENTIAL I c/\ !bui :o Sir, It is clear from recent letters from Sir Rupert Hay to Mr. Furlonge, of which the latest is ^ir Rupert Hay’s letter No. 16420/9G of th e ?th July, that the S.Jtan of Muscat is likely to oppose the retention of any extra-territoriality. Subsequent discussion between the Sultan’s foreign Minister, Colonel 'oods Ballard, and members of the Eastern Department has provided con firmation of this attitude. 2. I appreciate that, apart from Indians, Sinhalese and Khojas, a comparatively small number of persons would be affected at present. Although these numbers are likely to increase when the Oil Coinpany starts operations, I would not on this account regard the surrender of jurisdiction as serious. Nevertheless from the point of view of prestige and because of the primitive judicial system in Muscat, I consider it desirable to try and obtain some measure of extra territoriality if the Sultan can be persuaded to accept this. 3. Major Chauncy should therefore be instructed to discuss this matter with the Sultan. He should say that His majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would like to retain eJfetra-territorial jurisdiction over citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies, Southern Rhodesians and British Protected Persons, other than nationals of the Protected States in the Persian Gulf and of the Aden Protectorate and persons of Zanzibar origin who own property in Muscat. He should suggest that extraterritoriality should be regulated by exchange of letters rather than by articles in the Treaty as at present. He should add that C.J. Pelly, Esq., O.B.E. , etc., etc., etc., / His Bahrain- 2 - (0 MV) His IZ-ajesty’s Government have also been asked by the Governments of India and Ceylon to seek the Sultan’s agreement to the continued exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction over their nationals by the British Consular Court. Major Chauncy should point out to the bultan that His Majesty’s Government has exercised jurisdiction in Muscat since the Treaty of 1839 and they therefore hope that, in view of past usage and of their long-standing and tradional friendship with ohe Sultan, he will be prepared to allow that continuance of their extra* territorial privileges. Major Chauncy may at his discretion mention v O the ^ew stated by Sir Geoffrey Prior (referred to in your telegram No. L? ^ &gt; \^ &lt; ,109 of 29th March) that the British Bank of Iran and the Middle ^as^ ^ might close their branch in Muscat if extra-territoriality is withdrawn. 5. I am doubtful whethe- there is any advantage in calling the Sultan’s attention to the terms of his treaties with the United States and French Governments of 1833 and 18^ respectively under which both these Governments are granted certain extra-territorial privileges. These T reaties date from the same period as our own Treaty of 1839 under which we first acquired similar privileges. Our own -reaty has long since been superseded and so far as I am aware it is many years since the United States and r rench ^reaties were operative, at least so far as these particular provisions are concerned. If the Sultan is unwilling to allow us to retain our extra-territorial privileges, it is most unlikely that he will agree to the extra-territorial provisions in his United States and French treaties being enforced should there be any suggestion of this at any time in the future. Unless therefore the Sultan is willing to agree to our request for retention of jurisdiction, to represent to him that we have at least equfal rights with the Americans and the French would have only the e 'feet of securing the abrogation of such rights in his Treaties with these two countries. If the Sultan mentions that His Majesty's Government have asked for no similar privileges in Saudi Arabia and the Yemen it can be oointed out to him that our friendship with the ^ormer has been neither so long nor so close as our friendship with himv -3- O izt \ *V and that %ve have so far had no representation in the latter, where our interestes are negligible. 6. ^hile I must leave the detailed presentation of the case to l.'ajor Chauney’s discretion, I am in entire agreement vdth Sir Hupert Hay that on no atcount should threats of any kind be used in an attempt to secure the Sultan's agreement. If, as seen* possible the Sultan’s reactions are unfavourable, Major Chauncy is authorised to make the following concessions (i) He may suggest a formula on the lines described V \\ / ^ lb - 1 in paragraph 7 of Kr. ’borlonge’s letter No. HA '1645/7 of the 7th June in order to provide for the exclusion of Khojas from the Consular Court; and (ii) He may propose the retention of extra-territoriality for a limited period of five years only with provision for reconsideration at the end of that period. I should also be prepared to tell the Governments of India and Ceylon that His Kajesty's Government are unable to retain jurisdiction over their nationals, b t further reference should be made to me before the Sultan is informed of this. 7. At the same time Major Chauncy should inform the Sultan that His Majesty's Government regard it as important (a) that they should retain the right to exercise over members of the British Forces stationed in Muscat the control and jurisdiction provided by British military law to which the members of such forces are subject; and (b) That such forces should in general not be subject to the jurisdiction of the local courts. The Sultan should be told that such arrangements have existed in Iraq for many yea s in respect of British forces stationed there, under the terms of the Military Agreement of 1924 and the freaty of 1930, and it is therefore assumed that he will not object to similar arrangements in Muscat. 8. If it is clear that even as a result of these concessions the Sultan is not willing to grant the request of His Majesty’sm Government in this matter, I shall in all probability be prepared to surrender extra-territoriality rather than risk a breach of the friendly relations which exist with the Sultan at present. In this case I should seek to obtain certain safeguards on the lines of the list prpposed in Major Chaunoy’s letter to Sir Rupert Hay of the 30th June and I suggest that these might be conveniently included in the Protocol relating to Consular matters, c J ' however is not exhaustive and I should communicate with you again when I have considered further the safeguards which would be required. T agree however that Major Chauncy should endeavour to find out how far the Sultan is prepared to go in this respect and should report to me for instructions. 9. Discussion of the delTtiled d-afting of the exchange of letters or of any articles to be included in the Protocol can take place once agreement has been reached in principle. I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, Your obedient Se rvant, (For the Secretary of State) G. v, r .

The file contains a series of letters exchanged between the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat (Major Frederick Charles Leslie Chauncy) and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] regarding the precise wording of the English text of the treaty. The remaining correspondence, which is mostly between the Political Agent and the Foreign Office, concerns proposed amendments to drafts of the treaty. Other related matters of discussion include the following: the question of whether the Sultan will agree to allow the British to retain their 'extra-territorial privileges' in Muscat (i.e. jurisdiction over nationals from other British territories); whether the new treaty should cover consuls and consular functions; the duration of the new treaty, with the Foreign Office preferring a minimum of twelve years; the possibility of prolonging the existing treaty until 31 December 1951.Also included is a draft of the proposed new treaty (ff 93-103). The Arabic language material consists of the aforementioned correspondence between the Political Agent and the Sultan (English translations are included).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat (1951)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat (1939)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Consular services</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000024#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
