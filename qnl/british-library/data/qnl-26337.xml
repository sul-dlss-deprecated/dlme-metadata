The Ministry of Defence have infonaed the Military Attache that the contract for the purchase of 12 Avro XIX aircraft and 5 years spares has been signed in London, and that Lt.-Col. Abdur Raaaq Khan left London for Kabul on 22nd January. It is interesting to note that some 93*000 Persian lambskins were dispatched to the London market for sale during the autumn of 1947.

I am giving below replies to those of your questions which can be answered without making references to the authorities in India or England. (a) Ypur quagtiQua, The transaction is a commercial one and should be regarded as between the Royal Af&lt;^ian Crovemment and the firm manufacturing Avro XIX aircraft. The contract should be drawn up and signed by the Royal Afghan Legation in London and the manufacturing firm as early as possible. His Majesty's Government are prepared to give the Royal Afghan Legation in London such technical assistance as they may require during their negotiations with the manufacturers. It should be realised that the manufact urers will not be able to secure the release of material for constructing the aircraft until the contract has been signed and 50£ of the cost paid to them with the remaining £)Q/fe deposited in an agreed bank in London# this latter balance being payable to the firm in full against delivery of shipping documents. The manufacturers are unable to accept payment by instalments.

(j) Yflur.-ftUflatiQfl Np«, 15,« The Air Ministry have already promised to provide such technical advice as may be required. Should the requ: Royal Afghan Government decide to send aeronautical representatives to England the Air Ministry will be asked to give them any assistance they require. (k) lour quaskipna 14 to 17, Air Ministry have strongly recocmended that the Avro III aircraft be flown out and delivered in Karachi. This they state will ensure that aircraft are thoroughly tested before arrival* would save time and avoid risKs inherent in re-assembling aircraft in India after shipment. The Royal Afghan Government have agreed to this proposal provided the risk of loss is covered by the manufacturers, The question of the coat of transport, the supply of pilots for the delivery of the aircraft at Karachi, the arrange ments for the test of the aircraft on delivery at Karachi arid whether the manufacturers or the Royal Afghan Government bear the coat of transpprting the aircraft from England to /arachi should be negotiated when concluding the contract. It should be noted tnat provision is being made in all aircraft for a readily removable dual control conversion set, and a dual control conversion set will be supplied with each of the first two aircraft to be delivered.

The problem of payment for petrol used during tests by the manufacturers' pilots should be decided when concluding the Contract. 3. It is suggested that the Royal Afghan Legation be given instructions to negotiate the contract for the supply of the 12 Avro XIX aircraft without delay since no aircraft can be supplied wt until two or three months after the contract has been concluded and signed.

It appears that the Afghans are now prepared to produce the money for twelve Avro XIX's on the terms suggested by the Aviation Company and we may, .therefore, shortly expect them to place a firm order. We view with some apprehension the future of this part of the world and particularly the attitude which the tribesmen on both sides of the Indo-Afghan frontier might adopt. There is, as you will have seen in the press, con siderable agitation for an independent Pathanistan - a possibility not envisaged in the plarv/plan for the transfer of power^and it remains to be seen what will result* In any oase the stability of both Pathanistan and Afghanistan will depend primarily on the extent to which these two countries, in collaboration, can maintain peace among the tribes* The addition of twelve Avro XIX* s to the present small Afghan Air Force will undoubtedly add to that Government’s power to maintain peace and we would urge, that once the order is placed, it may be given as high priority as possible. I am copying this letter to Baker of the Foreign Office, Trangnar, Ministiy of Supply, and Wing-Commander Coote-Robinson.TOP SECRET Extract from a Report on an interview which the Military Attache had with Lt.-Gen.

His Government would pay 5Q^ cash with order and 50/S on delivery through their Legation in London. He said it was embarrassing for his Government to pay such a large sum as £180,000 in cash instead of by 3 or 4 instalments particularly as the Government was short of sterling credits. + + + + + + + •\British Legation, |^47 J Kabul • 1st.

His Majesty’s Government’s part in the transaction had been to assist the Afghans by working out suitable specifications to enable the aircraft to be modified in accordance with their wishes, and by obtaining the necessary priority for their manufacture.

Introductio.n The Chairman opened the meeting pointing out that some revision in the requirements of Anson aircraft necessitating a reduction had arisen and requested D.D.O.A. to comment on this position. G/Capt. Penney confirmed that this position no longer existed as the Air Ministry had decided to make reductions in ther directions, therefore the ^nson requirements still stood, though 31 of these still awaited final Treasury approval.- 2 - aircraft which were as follows : - Anson XIX (Communication aircraft^ Anson 20 (Overseas Navigational Trainer Anson 21 (Home Navigational Trainer) Anson 22 (Radio Trainer) Total The present contract position was that A.V. Roes held contract cover for a total of 274 Anson Metal Wing aircraft and action would be taken to give the additional contract cover to A.V. .Roes for the 10 already approved^as soon as Treasury sanction had been obtained for the additional 81 aircraft now- required by the R..i.P. to bring their total up to the above. D.D. 0. (A) pointed out that one aircraft on the Iraq contract had how been set aside for the Afghans and that therefore only 29 off this o ntract can be diverted to meet R.A.F. needs. It is requested, therefore, that Contracts will make the necessary adjustments to the various contracts issued to A.V.Roes to bring these into lino with the above amendments. Dealing next eith the question of priority of delivery of the various r^les D.D.O.A. stated that the Anson XX was first priority. Anson 20 It was stated at the meeting that the bulk of the drawings should be completed by the end r f January with information as it is known today. However, AD/RDL pointed out that there was still a certain amount of other dcvcl pment work to be carried out together with flight tests to prove certain installations, it was therefore impossible at this stage to give any firm date when the pr t type aircraft would be completed. The present planned production delivery date is June and it was generally thought that this would allow reasonable time for the necessary trials to be completed and preliminary work / carried 1?2 58 97 .37 364IT - j - carried out to permit production to commence during June 1947» Delivery of this aircraft together with other roles is attached to the minutes of this meeting. ' • Anson 21 This aircraft was second on the priority list hut it was generally thought that as this aircraft was a simplified version of the Anson XX no difficulty diould he experienced in meeting the delivery requirements which are planned to commence in June 1947* It was agreed at the meeting that should -any delay he experienced in the clearance of the above aircraft, which in turn would necessitate the delivery programme stated anove being put hack, aircraft should he delivered to the communication role. Anson 22 Radion Trainer This aircraft was 'to take third priority hut it was generally thought that the design work involved was not of such a major nature as the other roles and should ho cleared in time for production to commence in July 1947- Y/ith regard to the delivery programmes, Hr. Fielding made particular reference to the supply of materials pointing out that trouble was experienced in certain classes' special reference being made to-copper tubing for oil line install ations and the question of substitute materials was being investigated by A.V. Roes Drawing Office. The Chairman requested _D/RDL to take particular note of this pcint and the question of the possibility of using light allowy tubing in place of copper tubing which was generally :ncwn to be in very short supply. / AD/RDLiJj/PDL agreed to investigate this closely with the firm and deal in a general way with the question of substitute materials„ Action . iD/RDL. Finally D.D.O.(ii) pointed out that if aircraft for any of the above roles were late in delivery and the communication type was supplied in lieu, he did not want the total co:.viunicati~'n aircraft delivered to exceed 172 . The p ssible absorption of the surplus communication types are referred to later in the minutes. i\fghan Requirements Though it was confirmed that the final specification had been agreed by the Afghan authorities there was still one out standing point which related to the type of wireless to be installed, this was already in the hands of the ,i\&gt;an authorities for final decision. The Chairman pointed out that due to the delay which had been incurred'due to the failure on the pant of the Afghan authorities to make a final decision, the earliest delivery that could now be made w-uld be during the last quarter of 1947* It was however suggested that DDO-n. might be able to release some of his surplus Communication Trainers for converting to -Afghan’s requirements. D.D.O.(A) agreed pointing out that the pr gramme for oommunicati n aircraft as submitted was in excess of the ra.tc called i'or and the v'.!iversi m may assist in meeting the storage problems that would probably be created. His agreement, however, was subject to the aircraft being replaced during the third or fourth quarter ~f 1947. He would n t agree to ary diversion in respect of the ..ns n 20, 21 and 22. / TheThe Chairman emphasized that thrush these aircraft could bu made abailable about May or'June 1947 he could net guarantee delivery of this aircraft to the Afghan authorities any earlier as it was not yet known how much design work wauld be involve ' and4-t could not be agreed that 4.V. Roe’s Drawing Office col J drop any of the design work they are already carrying out on the other Anson Metal Jing aircraft roles to complete such alteration in design to meet Afghan’s requirements. The question of contract cover for such design work was next raised and it was agreed that this was a matter to be settled between Air.2/3, G-B. 6, and D.'T.D. The Chairman urged that the Afghan authorities in Lrndon should have the above position brought to their notice in order that they could press for a final decision from the .fghan Government. aiCti'T'n* A.ir2/3, G.B. 6, R.D.L 1. Indian Requirements. D.L.O.(A) stated that there was a certain requirement for Avro 20 aircraft. It was not clear whether contract action r this requirement would be undertaken by _.ir Ministry or -hether a direct contract would be placed by the Government of ‘ndia. India Office representative stated this requirement uld be the subject of a meeting during the next few days .etween representatives of ^.ir Ministry, Ministry of Supply, and the Indian Office. The Chairman stated that in the absence f a firm contract no. provision could.be made for these ircraft in the present programme forecast. The requirement 'uld be discussed in relation to the other comnitments when firm order had been placed and the delivery requirements ./ore known. Egyptian Requirements. Air.4b stated that there was a probable requirement of 6 / Avro. XIX aircraft for the Egyptian Government. The aircraft would he required by Feburary 194-8, but the demand could not at present be regarded as firm and should not be included in the programme. The Chairman stated that if such an order v/as forth Vait&amp; delivery could probably be offered for the early months of 1948 provided standard communication aircraft were required. ColordaI Office R equirements . ' air.4-b stated that~’no further information was available regarding the Colonial'Office requirement of 8 aircraft spec ially modified for Locust and Crop Spraying. The Chairman stated that the operating season had now- passed and that the Colonial Office should be advised tnat if these aircraft were required for the next season commencing September 1947, the requirement should be made firm before May 1947, as a fair amount of design work was still involved. V. does had ceased design work on this project pending receipt of definite instructions, therefore the-sooner DTD was made aware of the requirement the better. Action : Air 4b. P rivate Vent ure Or ders f or nvro XIX 1 s. Air.4b asked Mr. Fielding whether firm orders had been received from Baharat airways, India., and the Director General of Civil Aviation, India, for 2 and 13 aircraft respectively, and whether the firm have promised delivery dates for these requirements. Mr. Fielding stated that correspondence had been exchanged with Baharat Airways but no contract had been signed. An enquiry had also been received from EGC^, India, but no contract concluded. In both cases very early delivery was required by the purchaser. / mi, e- 7 - The Chairman stated that firm orders should be placed for these requirements. The Air Ministry might be willing to consider the release of a number of communication aircraft from their quota for the months of .^pril. May and June, after the requirements of Afghanistan have been net. D.D.O.(ii) again confirmed his previous remarks stating that consideration might be given to this possibility as his Department were likely to be embarrassed by the lack of storage space for communication aircraft during those months. Ary air craft released at that stage in favour of expert orders would have to be*placed during the third or fourth quarter 1947 . The Chairman emphasized that these requirements could n'^t be considered and included in the programme until contracts have been placed. Furthermore, if in. meeting any of these requirements design alterations cf a major nature were involved this would definitely have a retarding effect on delivery. Finally any question as to the relative priorities of verseas buyers might necessitate a decision by the DFMF (PS) Committee. v Middle East Metal. Winr^ Requirements. Mr. Fielding, V. Roc,'~p 7 inteT out that owing to the unsatisfactory material pros it ion he had been Freed to put the celivery of these requirements back to August. Mr. Fielding also confirmed that the sample aircraft had now been received at A.V. Roes and work was proceeding s a t is f ac to r i ly. C.

Roe, submitted a detailed statement of their planned delivery of spares for Anson Metal wing and subject to material position being satisfactory had every confidence in achieving this programme. The Chairman made reference to the genera.1 position of Anson spares as a whole and the number of items outstanciing n pr evious co ntract s. Mr. Fielding confirmed that this matter was being investi gated and stated that the detailed position was as follows Items on Contra.ct 1409 Items fully delivered 213 Items partly delivered 315 Items none delivered 881 The Chairman stated that he thought the position was most unsatisfactory and in fact he had received an official n tificati n from D. of E. (A) pointing out that his representatives had for some m nths been trying to obtain a statement from ^i.V. Roes but without suuccess. The Chairman also mentioned that -n five occasi '.ns during the period ^.ugust to the present date written requests had been made by his Department to A.V. Roes but no replies had been received. / Mr.- 9 - Mr. Fielding pointed out that the previous Anson fepares contracts were carried out at Yeadon and the above period ivas covering the time when the transfer from Yeadon to Chadderton was taking place, however, he agreed to let the Department have a statement by January 5th. ^ The Chairman stated that he would advise D. of E.(a) th. a full statement of the position would be passed to his Department as soon as the above had been received from A.V.

AefcieDrPenney G/Capt. Penney confirmed that this position no longer existed as the Air* Ministry had decided to make reductions in other directions, therefore the Anson requirements still stood. Reuuirements At the request of the Chairman G/Capt. Penney then outlined R.A.F. requirements for the various roles of the Anson aircraft which were as follows:-* Anson XIX (Coranunication Trainer) 172 Anson XX (Overseas Navigational Trainer) 58 Anson XXI (Home Navigational Trainer) 97 Anson XXII( Radio Trainer) 37 Total 364 The present contract position was that A.V. Roes held contract cover for a total of 274 Anson Metal Mng aircraft and action was already in hand to give 1 the additional contract cover to A.V. Roes to bring their total up to the above. It is requested therefore that Contracts will make the necessary adjustments' to the various contracts issued to A.V. Roes to bring these into line with the above requirements. Action: C.B.6Dealing next with the queation of priority of deliveiy of the variou* l roles D.D.Q.A. stated that the Anson XX was first priority. Anson XX It was stated at the meeting that the drawings should be completed by the end of January with information as it is known today. However, AD/HDL pointed out that there was still a certain amount of other development work to be carried out together with flight tests t6 prove certain installations, it was therefore in^ossible at this stage to give any firm date when the prototype aircraft would be completed. The present planned production delivery date is June and it wa* generally thought that this would allow reasonable time for the necessary triale to be completed and preliminary work carried out to permit production to commence during June Delivery of this aircraft together with other roles is attached to the minutes of this meeting. Anson XXI This aircraft was second on the priority list but it was generally thought that as this aircraft was a simplified version of the Anson XX no difficulty should be experienced in meeting the delivery requirements which are planned to coninence in June It was agreed at the meeting that should any delay be experienced in the clearance of the above aircraft, which in turn would necessitate the delivery programme stated above being put back, aircraft should be delivered to the communication role. Anson XXII Radio 1'rainer. This aircraft was to take third priority but it was generally thought that the design work involved was not of such a major nature as the other two role* and shnuld be cleared in time for production to commence in July 1947- With regard to the delivery programmes, Mr. Fielding made particular reference to the supply of materials pointing out that trouble was experienced in certain classes special reference being made to copper tubing for oil line installations and the question of substitute materials was being investigated by A.V. Hoes Drawing Office. The Chairman requested AD/HDL to take particular note of this point andthe question of the possibility of using light alloy tubii|g in place of copper tubing which was generally known to be in wery sho&gt;(t supp^j? t AD/HDL agreed to investigate this closely with the firm and deal in a general way with the question of substitute materials • Action: AD/KDL Finally WOA pointed out that if any of the above roles were late in delivery and the comnunication role was supplied in lieu he would be faced with a storage problem as he really did not want aircraft delivered at too high a rate after the second quarter of 19^7* The possible absorption of the surplus conmunlcation types are referred to later in the minutes. Afghan Requirements Though it was confirmed that the final specification had been agreed by , the Afghan authorities t tie re was still one outstanding point which related to the type of wireless to be installed, this was already in the hands of the Afghan authorities for final decision. The Chairman pointed out th&amp;t due to the delay which had been incurred due to the failure on the part of the Afghan authorities to make a final decision, the earliest deliveiy that could now be made would be during the last quarter of 1947. It was however suggested that HX)A might be able to release some of his surplus Communication Trainers for converting to Afghan's requirements. DDOA agreed to this subject to the aircraft being replaced during the third or fourth quarter of 1947. ~ The Chairman emphasised that though these aircraft could be made available v he could not guarantee delivery of this aircraft to the Afghan authorities ary earlier as it was not yet known how much design work would be involved and it could not be agreed that A.V. Hoe's Drawing Office could drop any of the design work they are already carrying out on the other Anson Metal Wing aircraft roles to complete such alteration in design to meet Afghan*s requirements. The question of contract cover for such design work was next raised and it was agreed that this was a matter to be settled between Air.3* C.B.6 and D.T.D. The Chairman urged that the Afghan authorities in London should have the /aboveabove position brought to their notice in order that they could press for a final decision from the Afghan Government. d, \ v Indian Requiiemcnts It is understood that Indian requirements are not yet firm and until such time as A.V. Hoes had received a firm contract no action could be taken for the planning or delivery of these aircraft. It was requested therefore that this position should be brought to the notice of the Departments concerned. Foreign Requirements The question of meeting foreign orders was still not finalized and the Chairman again pointed out that until firm statements were made and contracts issued no official planning could be made. Special reference was also made to the question of Somaliland Locust Spray aircraft and the Chairman stated that the operating season had now passed and Air.4 should note and advise all concerned that should these aircraft be required in time for the next season the order must be placed during May 1947 as AD/HBL had pointed out that a fair amount of design work was involved and that A.V. Koes had ceased all such work pending the receipt of definite instructions. Middle Kast Requirements Mr. Fielding, A.V. pointed out that owing to the unsatisfactory material position he had been forced to put the delivery of these requirements back to August. Mr. Fielding also confirmed that the sample aircraft had now been received at A.V. iioes and work was proceeding satisfactorily. C. B.6 confirmed that contract cover for the conversion of this sample aircraft had now been issued to A.V. Roe. t , i D. D.O.A. pointed out that whilst he appreciated the reason for putting back the delivery of Middle Bast requirements from June to August he thought it was most advisable that two or three sets should be supplied during May or June to Middle East in order that they could commence training H.A.F. personnel abroad in the carrying out of this conversion. Mr. Fielding agreed to plan to meet this requirement. Action* Air. 3 Y 4 - Action* A.V. RoeSpares Hz*. Fielding, A.V.

Roes but without success* The Chairman also mentioned that on five occasions during the period August to the present date written requests had been made by his Department to A*V* Roes but no replies had been received. Mr* Fielding pointed out that the previous Anson spares contracts were carried out at Teadon and the above period was covering the time when the transfer from Teadon to Chadderton was taking place, however, he agreed to let the Department have a statement by January 3th. The Chairman stated that he would advise D of &amp;(a) that a full statement of the position would be passed to his Department as soon as the above had been received from A*V* Roe. Action: A*V.

His Majesty’s Government part in this question of the supply of Anson aircraft has of course been merely to assist the Afghans by working out a suitable apecification for the Ansons and by obtaining the necessary priority for the manufacture of the order. As far as I know, the Afghans have not previously suggested they would expect His Majesty’s Government to afford them credit terms. In the circumstances it seems best that the actual contract should be signed between A.V. Roe and the Afghan Legation here. It might be as well, with this end in view, to telegraph to Squire informing him that any form of Government credit or underwriting of the contract was out of the question and asking him to advise the Afghan Government to instruct their Legation accordingly to enter into the normal form of commercial contract with A.V. Roe. It might be helpful if we could at the same time give Squire some idea of what terms would be acceptable to the Company.

Thank you for your letter of the 18th Instant, enclosing copy of telegram No. 126 of November 8th. The following are the points which have been awaiting clarification on the Afghan order:- Dual control proposals (now settled). Whether Afghanistan will guarantee to accept aircraft against the specification. (action-Afghanistan). Whether A.V.Roe will accept the terms of psyraent offered by H.M. Minister, Kabul. (action-A.V.Roe). Whether if the Company seek a guarantee this will be given by the Foreign Office. (Action-Yourself or Foreign Office). I am afraid that evei 7 day during which a reply on the second of the fpregoing is delayed will necessarily set back the production programme. The Gompany is naturally not disposed to incur development expenditure until it is satisfied it is going to receive an order. Further development is J. Ross Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1. /necessaryt t necessary before the specifioation can be met and production cannot begin until it has been completed. In any case I fear that the somewhat unattractive payment terms now suggested may also occasion delay, because the Company will want to be. satisfied on these also before it commits itself. /r' L.H. 16.

If Afghanistan is prepared to make available to the manufacturing Company (A.V.Roe) an irrevocable credit out of which the bills can be paid as they fall due, there will of course be no difficulty in safeguarding payments. If, however, Afghanistan is not prepared to adopt this course there will be a risk to be taken by A.V.Roe and we cannot escape some moral liability to the Company (even though no legal one), if the negotiations between Afghanistan and the Company are (as Kabul asks) conducted through us. You will appreciate that we have no justification for accepting any such financial liability and we must therefore ask that either the Foreign Office or yourself let us have formal notification that if Afghanistan defaults on its payments you will hold us indemnified against any moral obligation arising towards the Company. I am sorry that this point was not taken up earlier we are feeling our way towards the procedure in these and the intensification of Parliamentaiy control of since the war i^making it increasingly necessary for us jt© cover such points completely.

I think that we should follow up our express letter to Kabul by a SOLO telegram in about a week* s time reminding Squire that the fulfilment of the programme in paragraph A of Forminka 143 is dependent upon Afghan acceptance of the specificat ionjW Afghans to meet the terras of the contractDear Cleary, V Ansons for Afghanistan. You -will realise that it is not the function of the Ministry of Supply to specify what aircraft its customers want, so that we are reluctant to take upon ourselves the responsibility for specifying in detail the aircraft to be ordered for Afghanistan, It was for that reason that I asked you in July to arrange with DOR, Air Ministry, (who alone in this country possesses the necessary technical knowledge) for the writing of a formal and detailed requirement against which we could order the aircraft. with DOR but in any event no such requirement has reached us. In order to avoid further deley we have taken the unprecedented step of drafting ourselves a requirement which we hope will meet the Afghan needs, but we should like to make it clear that we can accept no responsibility for its operational suitability. I attach a copy of this requirement and if you will confirm that Afghanistan will accept aircraft delivered I do not know what went wrong with your negotiations to this requirement we will place them on order. This does not necessarily mean that we shall be unable to meet the programme which was discussed at the meeting /here D.M. Cleary Esq., India Office, T ?h i t eh all, S. W. 1.\ here on October 17th. All being well this oan be done because the aggregate quantity of Anson aircraft at present on order is sufficient, and it will onlyr be necessary to divert some of the aircraft which would otherwise be built to the RAP specification to meet the Afghan order. If of course^ there is any long delay in agreeing the attached draft a new factor would be v*&gt;Hproduced. I hope that by now our Directorate of Contracts has discussed with you the arrangements to be made to pay for the aircraft on delivery. Once this point has been cleared up I should propose to invite you to write formally to us conveying a request that we should order the aircraft and undertaking to safeguard us against any failure on the part of the Afghan Government to meet their obligations under the contract.jLbe or 7/Alrft/6Q6, i 1 Anson XIX Airora^t to-the*Qr6^r of the Government Afghanistan # 1* General Reciairemen ts.| * iCO reqi The Government niC p;hanan standard Anson XIX aircraft as s'izpi tribal policing and transport purposes. ires two conversions of to the RAF, to be used These aircraft will normally have to take off from an airfield at 6,OCX) ft# altitude and operate at altitudes up to 10,000 ft# 2.

Action DDC(A) E. 23 Miscella neous Requirements - (Foreign Orde rs) The Chairraan next requested iir. Haynes, Air,to state the known requirements to meet foreign orders, Mr. Haynes replied teat the position was as follows:- Somaililand Locust Spray aircraft 8 Indian Air Force 8 Indian State Servic 10 Indian Aviation advisory Board 2 Errypt 6 There had also been an enquiry for Ansons for Indian Princes, but no action could be taken at this stayc as this had only been in the form of an enquiry. It would appear, however, stated Mr. Haynes, that the Locust Spray Aircraft would be a very urgent requremont and an early delivery during the first quarter of March, 1947, is likely to be made, but the question of all for^irn orders was to be discussed by the Bowater Committee when priority for all foreign orders would be stated. In view of a possible firm demand beiny made for the Somaililand Locust requirement, delivery has been plannc to con once in January and finish in March, this will of course be subject to priority boin;; yiven, but .EDO(A) has requested that it is recorded that as far as t iO Air Ministry is concerned, diversion of the aircraft during; ■che above period is not acceptable to them, this view is also confirmed by Air,3(a) it will therefore be necessary for Air,4(b) to obtain a firm decision on thu question of priority.

V. orders without first consulting; Ministry of Supply, Mr. Fieldiny pointed out thr.t he was of the opinion that his firm had not done this, the Chairman accordingly pointed out to Mr. Fiedliny that it was necessary for him to record in the minute: the Department's objection to A. V. Roe's continuing acceptin'; such orders when RAF. demands were not boiny: met. Mr. Fieldiny later confitmed that he ho/d yiven instructions for the Indian order to be hold in abeyance until the position improved, and there was a better possibility of introducing the delivery of those aircraft into his production linewithout detriment to HAF* anc IviOS* foreign orders; he did, however, request that the remaining six should he supplied by A. V. Roe’s durin,; October, 1946, and January, 1947* Whilst programming these aircraft DDO(a) and Air*3(a) have requested that their non-agreement to th supply of these aircraft is recorded. Mr. Fielding undertook that any fall down on Anson production would be borne-—s first by tneir P. V. orders, priority being given to the E.A. F.

V* Roe, the total number of aircraft to be planne for between now an' Larch, 1948, was 499* It was proposed at the meeting that tiic firm should plan and t &gt;1 to roach a peak :f 40 per month, but subsequent to the meeting and further investigation into the programme requirements, it was revealo that the firm would have to plan for a hi hmr peak reaching 43 per month if all demand were going to be met, it was also thought that .4 V. Roc’s might possibly increase v their ou'cput during- the first quarter of 1947 by two aircraft per month. Attached oo these minutes is a complete break down of programme setting out the requirements, the cumulative total of wing output on this 'planning; is 343, thus leaving a balance of 46 aircraft sots over and above known firm requirements which can be allocated to suggested foreign orders, delivery of these surplus 46 aircraft is shown to take place between Hay and November, 1947* Turning next to the question of the additional toolin and Hr.

On the four other major versions (three R.a• f• trainers and Somaliland Locust sprayer) design work had hardly started, and Ur. Gregson was in considerable doubt as to the ability of t ie design staff available foe t .e jason(wnich believed to be^two draughtsmen) to complete this work in time to meet the production dates, unless it was considerably augmented either at the expense of the T.7/45 or from other sources.

AIR MINISTRY, WHITEHALL, LONDON, S.W.I. 16th October, 1946 . • Dear I think you know that Air Commodore Wardle has now left this office and I have taken his place. Before leaving he asked me to reply to your letter dated 11 th October 19A-6 regarding requirements for Anson aircraft for the Afghan Government. The position is that Wardle somewhat reluctantly produced a paper setting out the probable characteristics of the Anson XIX and giving his views as to v/hether or not this would be suitable for their use. He did not feel that he could go any further in this and I must say I subscribe to this view. It is difficult enough to write one*s own requirements and I should say almost impossible to try and write requirements for a nation and country one has never visited and has no real idea of how they propose to operate their aircraft. I do not wish to be unhelpful and I am quite willing to help in every way possible, but I do not want to commit myself to writing requirements for another Government -when I really have no idea what they want.

The landing distance from 50 feet and ground run at these gross weights less three-quai-ters of the fuel load would be as follows;- 7. The maximum permissible gross weight for the Anson XIX. is 10,600 lbs., but at this weight, as you will see from the above figures, the margin of performance will be very small under Afghanistan conditions. For taice—oil and landing at tnis msvi i iim permissible weight of 10,600 lbs., we should recommend runways of : - /L 600 yardsM *2 5601 ~ J ~ CfitQtZs OkCtX j lo 00 yards for an altitude of 1 ^JOO feet-’ ^ HP Got- 1400 yards for an altitude of f; ,700 feet, arid: 1100 yards for an altitude of 2,000 feet. &lt;&amp; If some lower limitation in the maximum •g&amp;tiaBzass&amp;dgt gross weight at whic: t/iese aircraft are allowed to operate is acceptable, these runway distances could be reduced, but as you will see from the figures the aeroplane will not carry nine passengers at any lower weight than 10,600 lbs* unless t ,e fuel load and consequently the range is very considerably reduced. Service Ceiling. 8 . The service ceiling at these various take-off weights would be as follows:- 9,600 lbs... 13500 feet. 9,880 lbs 12700 feet. 10,000 lbs 13200 feet. ) Passengers only. No external 10,600 lbs.......... 11600 feet. ) drag of bombs or containers. Performance on one Engine. 9. The ^anson XXX does not meet our requirements for performance in the event of one engine becoming inoperative eith r during take-off or during flight, and would be unacceptable as a new aircraft. However, the Anson is a well proved type with very reliable engine, and we are continuing to build and operate the aircraft ourselves in spite of these limitations. The Dakota which we are continuing to operate is a similar case, as it would not meet our modem requirements for performance after failure of one engine. Recommendation . 10. If the runways are increased in length to provide for operating at maximum permissible gross weight or if the maximum gross weight is limited to keep the landing and take-off performance within the capacity of the existing runways, then I consider that the Anson XIX with metal wings is suitable for operation within southern Afghanistan for the roles of passenger carrying and minor bombing operations in tribal territory. 11 . I suggest that it would be preferable to equip all the aircraft for six seats only. If fitted with nine seats there is a very real danger that the Afghans will overload the aircraft. _A/Cdre.I hare waited for a reply froia D.O.R.yan the general question of these aircraftjbefore replying to your note,but in view of the lapse of time,I have taken up the suitability of this machine separately. &lt;Elie aircraft offered by Mr Horsfield differs ver; considerably from that required by the Afghans; (a) In order to give a reasonable range, take off, weight shuold be 10,600 lbs., and I have been advised hyfj.O.R. that at that weight the aircraft will not take off from 4he required airfields. (b) There is njlavatory provided. (c) Seating accomodation is not up to standard required for V.I.P.aircraft, nor is the sound proofing, for thisfc is a war aircraft fitted with wireless, cameras, bomb racks etc., and has a bomber a/c nose. This requires a major structional alteration. I would not advise reccomending this aircraft to the Afghan Government. r i A - w,. a~i c-tw-.. TJ. 44 -p jf tT tu\j S jU- 4 .

Since njy letter of July 12th on the above subject the situation has been eased by the cancellation by the Iraq Government of an order for 30 modified Anson XIX aircraft which were to have been delivered this year. On the other hand trouble has been experienced with the Cheetah XV engine fitted in this aircraft which has set back production. Balancing one against the other we think that the delivery programme discussed at the meeting on July 2nd, and embodied in your telegram of July 6 th to Kabul can stand, but it will not be necessary to place a special order for the aircraft as they can now be diverted from those which would have been / I made for Iraq, and which are already on contract.

I enclose two copies of the specification of this aircraft from which you will see that mosj; of the Afghan requirements are provided for, but that only 4 passengers and no toilet are included as compared with the six passengers, plus toilet, for which Af ghanistan is asking. If for the sake of very early delivery they would care to consider this aircraft they might be invited to inspect it at A.V.Roe, Yeadon, about the middle of August, and arrangements for this would be made if they are likely to be interested.SPECIFICATION OF OKS AIRCRAFT AVAILABLE KR EARLY DELIVERY TO AFGtiANI3TAW A. jnriaiiient I.

When the Irakis received the aircraft they complained that they ii&lt;l not fulfil certain requirements, such as ceiling and length of take-off.

Thank you for your letter of the 9th enclosing copy of the cable sent to Kabul. ■ We have had a conversation with the Air Ministiw today about the situation created by the unwillingness of the Afghan Government to place their own contract and hope to be able to overcome the difficulty by some extemporized machinery. One point has, however, emerged from the conversation^which is that it will be very desirable that the Afghans should discuss their operational requirements (as distinct from the technical details of installation^ which are our concern) with the Director of Operational Requirements, Air Ministry, in order that they may be assured that the aircraft which are placed on order will meet their needs in actual service experience. jr The normal procedure so far as RAP aircraft are concerned is for the detailed specification .of the aircraft to be prepared as a result of the joint efforts of DOR and of the Directorate of Technical Development here, who were represented at the meeting which I held on July 2nd.■ Certainly before we take the responsibility of placing a contract - which must inevitably imply some responsibility on behalf of the Afghan Government for the suitability of the aircraft - we shall want to be assured that DOR was satisfied. • - * Can you let qte know whether there are available any responsible representatives of the Afghan Government who could undertake the disoussions with DOR.Minutes of Meeting held in Room 5092, Thames Rouse North, on 2nd July 1946 at 3 pm, to discuss Anson XIX requireme: ts , Pre sent:- Mr. J.K.

Smith tt M n chair) 1. Mr. Horsefield explained that the meeting had been called to investigate the possible date of supply for a new Afghan requirement for 12 Anson XIX aircraft. Discussion was necessary in view of heavy RAF and other commitments. He asked the India Office what standard the Afghans required. 2. W/Cdr. '.7igginton said that existing standards were called for. The aircraft were to be used alternatively for internal mail services and for tribal policing. They should seat 6 or 9 passengers according to whether a lavatory were provided or not. No wireless was required but one front gun and bomb carrying fittings were needed. 3. Mr, Horsefield in-reply to a suggestion by the India Office that a ceiling of 18,000 ft. was called for, pointed out that the Service ceiling under English conditions was 13,000 ft. 4. W/Cdr. Wigginton agreed that the existing ceiling would be acceptable. He indicated that the aircraft had been asked for equipped with rocket-firing apparatus. 5* Mr. Fielding said that no data was available to enable such a requirement to be met. 6. Mr. Osman added that considerable modification especially to the v/ings might be necessary if rocket apparatus were to be fitted and the investigation of this aspect would certainly postpone delivery for a considerable period. 7. Mr. Doak was strongly opposed to fitting rocket apparatus owing to design difficulties. 8. Mr. Horsefield indicated that if rocket-firing apparatus were insisted upon delivery of the aircraft would be postponed beyond the delivery date specified by the Afghans. If they wanted delivery completed by the time stated (April 1947)they would have to accept existing standards and forego the rocket fitments. 9. Mr. Horsefield continued that present demands included:- 6 aircraft for the Egyptian Government 3 aircraft for MISR Airways 12 aircraft for the Indian States Air Services. There was also a requirement for 250 sets of metal wings for tho RAF for retrospective fitment on aircraft abroad.10. The new Afghan demand was for 12 aircraft for delivery by April 1947 and it was necessary to consider whether this could be met^ ^ 1 • iVir. .• | ielding and ' ir. Smith stated that their firm was planning additional output with a peak of 30 per month to be reached at the beginning of 1947* victual production of complete aircraft was expected to be as follows:- 1946 July 12 Aug. 11 Sept. 19 Oct. 26 Nov. 28 Dec. 24 1947 Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr. May June 23 24 22 18 20 20 1947 July 12 Aug. 20 Sept. 15 Oct. 15 Nov. 19 Dec. 12 12. -ir. riorsefiold said that as the RAF programme was already behind schedule it would be necessary to make up any back-log as a first priority. In addition, an Iraq requirement for 30 aircraft by December 1946 had already b^en placed on contract; these would obviously have priority over the other requirements which had not yet reached the contract stage especially as delivery promises had already not been fulfilled. ^fter some discussion it was made clear that the Indian and MISR requirements were not necessarily firm orders and that priority could not therefore be accorded to them. 1 ; * -- r » horsefield reviewed the production figures submitted by the A.V. Roe representatives. The position would be:- Production Required Unfulfilled Balance Surplus to Requirement, 3rd quarter 1946 42 46 RAF 12 Iraq 16 RAF Nil 4th quarter 1946 78 45 RAF 16 Iraq Nil • - / 1 1st quarter 1947 69 45 RAF Nil 24 2nd quarter 1947 58 45 RaF Nil 13 3rd quarter 1947 47 30 RAF Nil 17 14. It was Efparent that all known requirements could be met from the 54 aircraft becoming surplus between January and September 1947* 15* It was pointed out that no account had been taken of possible oivil orders bu t ..ir» A an son emphasized that it was the f irate responsibility to provide for any orders which might arise additional to those already discussed. ivlr. Fielding agreed with this. 1^• Air. Cleary said that the Afghans had specially requested 2 aircraft for delivery by December 1947 for training purposes. 12* ...r. /lorsofielcl suggested that the RAF might be prepared to give up 2 of the 91 earmarked fof them in July-Decerriber 1946 . 1®* J/Odr. Mason was reluctant to do this but finally agreed on condition (a) that the 89 promised actually materialised, and (b) that the 2 aircraft v/ere replaced in January 1947. 19. Mr. Cleary emphasized that while delivery of the balance of 10 Afghan aircraft might not be practicable early in the year owing to climatic conditions, it was essential that they should be available by the end of April 1947 to deal with tribal unrest which yusually develanedi in the early summer. /9n20, Mr. Horsefield aaid that in the circumstances del.-very vould be most practicably progrcunmed as follows:- 19A-6 November 1 Decemoer 1 1947 February 2 March 4 April 4 • I.ir. Gloary asked the Ministry of Supply to arrange the placing of an order for the Afghans as they had no machinery of their own for this purpose. ' • /x- 22. Mr. Haynes agreed to take the necessary action (Act-i.on . „ Air.4) • ^ ^ 23. Mr. Horse fie Id said that any stipulations or guarantees (Action which the Afghans required should oe covered by the contract India Office) 24# Mr. Fielding promised to supply a list of re coniine nded spares fox’ five years. (Action A.V.Roe) 23* Mr, Mo ale said that if if any modifications were required the contract position might become involved if the order • ere placou oy the Ministry of Supply. 26. v//Car, i&lt; r igginton stated that the aircraft would so roq,;__rcd to pass AID and would not need 0 of A. Tho firm's reprosent.-.tivos noted this, 27. Mr. PI ay ties mentioned the possibility of an order for one aircraft for the Queen of the Netherlands, He said that _f this requirement arose he would approa.ch the Air Ministry v.ith a v-ow to obtaining a special 1 vI 0 c-.se (note: as the table in paragr h 13 shows there will, 'theoretically, be one spare aircraft in the 4th quarter of 1946 'which might be made available for such a purpose). 23. Mr.•Grogson raised the question of mark numbers for the Afghan requirement. He suggested Mark AVIII could oe utilized as it was at present unallocated. 29. Mr. Horsefield in closing the meeting thanked those present for their attendance and co-operation.Telegrams : Airprod, London. Telephone: Franklin 2211. Extn. 1331 Our Kef.

Dear Cleary, Confirming nqy telephone conversation with ^ou this morning about your letter of July 5th (Ext.4135/46) I should be grateful if the draft cable could be amended as follows:- Line 8, after “investigation** add M and experiments'. Line 17, before “programme” insert 'deliveries of aircraft are only 3ust beginning and capacity will be taxed to the utmost this year to meet these orders. Nevertheless it is hoped to meet'. I think it might be well to delete the words 'which has been laid down is' in that and the succeeding linev Since I spoke to you I had an opportunity of consulting our Director of Contracts, and I find that he is familiar with the ciroumstanoes in which the Afghans ordered their previous aircraft. He assures me at that time the Afghan Government placed its order direct on the firm. As I explained toyouwe should much prefer this course, (a) because otherwise our gross Vote is inflated and (b) D.M. Cleary Esq., India Office, W.l. /becausebecause we should be left 'holding the babv' if by any chance the Afghan Government failed to pay up. Our Contracts Directorate would be very appy to assist in drafting a contract which would ully protect the Afghan Government, and would cover all requisite points. We suggest accordingly “IT the best course will be for the representatives of Afghanistan to negotiate direct with the Company for a contract covering the aircraft, spares, after- sale service, deliveiy, et®. etc. If these representatives vill he™'-!^' ° ldridge 0f the directorate of Contracts Im-e X ? a !

After discussion the Air Ministry agreed that if they could secure the 120 Ansons premised them by the Company by the end of this year, they w&gt;uld allow one of them to be diverted to Afghanistan in November and one in December. The Company agreed to make up this deficit of 2 aircraft to the Air Ministry in January, 1947* The following programme for the delivery of the remaining Ansons for Afghanistan was then agreed upon: - J anuary - Nil February - 2 March - 4 April - 4. I then asked whether the Ministry of Supply would be agreeable to handle the contract on behalf of the Afghan Government. They at first demurred to this but after Mr. Baker of the Foreign Office and I had explained the difficulties involved, the Ministry of Supply representatives agreed to recommend that their Contracts Department handle the job. The Afghan* s demands can be met by the supply of standard type aircraft but Ansons are not fitted with rocket firing ppar&amp;tus and the question whether they could be capable of being so fitted would require investigation which in the opinion of the firms representatives wuld almost certainly lead to delay in supplying the aircraft.-I took the opportunity of attempting to check the estimate which had already been given to us car £10,000^11,000 per aircraft and the representatives of the firm agreed that this was as close an estimate as they could give at present.DEPTL.

I don*t know if the Afghans knew this when they placed the order, but to enquire now will only hold up delivery. The planes will be of all metal construction; the question of spares and delivery is to be brought up at the meeting. I shall, of course, be only too happy to attend the meeting with you.

The ?oreign Office have written to llr. Horsefield of the Ministry of Supply and Aircraft production asking him to secure early delivery and te has suggested that the matter might be discussed at a meeting on July 2nd. I propose to attend this meeting and would be very glad if you could spare the time to attend also. You will see from Mr. Horsefield* s letter to Mr. Pyrnan of^ the-12th June below (a copy of which reached me only yesterday) that the former would like to know before the meeting what exactly the Afghan requirements are. These are set out in Colonel Lancaster* s letter of the 27th Parch which forms an enclosure to Ext.373^/4^» read in the light of his letter o, the Hth January at Ext.355/46• These requirements are briefly as follows:- 12 Avro XIX with one machine run to fire forward from the nose and bomb racks for 20 lb. or 112 lb, bombs. 11 of ttiese should have detachable seats for nine passengers with no toilet. The remaining one should have detachable seats for six passengers wi^h a toilet. J In addition, the Afghans would like to know whether it is possible to fit rocket firing apparatus to these aircraft. These requirements suggest that what the Afghans want is a modified version of the type of aircraft marked 2 in 1'r, Horsefield’s letter of the 12th June. Je may assume that the planes should be of all-metal construction. Unless there is any further information that you think we should obtain from Afghanistan I suggest that you might discuss the matter on this basis with Group Captain Roberts. You might at the same time discuss with him the question of spares (spares for five years have been recomraended)j-whether the aircraft should be flown out or sent by sea$ and whether we can confirm Sir G. Squire’s assumption (see para. 3 of his letter Ext.3736/46) that the manufacturers would in either event undertake delivery to the Afghan Government in good flying condition. Personally I think that it is essential that such ^n^undertaking should be given and carried out,for if the planes break downCopy (E 5429/416/77) Prod.

I attache a copy of a notice which I have sent out today sumnoning one. You will see that I have given plenty of notice of the meeting. The main reason is that I am anxious that we should be sure of the type of aircraft about which we are talking before the meeting takes place. Normally speaking the Anson XIX aircraft is designed for a communications role, and is devoid of armament. We have recently provided a modified version of the aircraft with external bomb racks and two guns, together with radio equipment and so forth. We have also supplied two standard Anson XIX aircraft modified with dual controls for training purposes. It is very desirable that we should know before the meeting whether similar aircraft will meet the Afghan requirements. I am not sure what is the appropriate machinery for settling this point, but perhaps you can arrange for someone to discuss the technical details, ii necessary 9 with Gp. Capt.

This order is to be confirmed in writing to this Legation by K the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Specifications for the 12 aircraft are as follows (a) Kievan Avro XIX*6 . Details as given in paragraph 2(a) of my above quoted letter. \y \ (b) one Avro XIX . Details as given in paragraph 2(b) of my above quoted letter. (c) An enquiry was made Ms to whether it was possible to fit rocket firing apparatus to the Avro XIX aircraft. 3. The C.G.S. also asked whether the Government of India would be prepared to sell them one second hand Hurricane CII aircraft from India for purposes of test in Kabul. The idea behind this request is that if the Hurricane proves suitable for use in tribal operations in Afghanistan the Afghan Government might be prepared to purchase a total of 12 of these aircraft second hand. fc/Cdr. King would fly the aircraft from feshawar to Kabul, or alternatively an Afghan pilot would be sent to India for training on the Hurricane and later fly the aircraft to Kabul. x It was stated that the delay in obtaining new Avro XIX^ and the present poor condition of the existing Hind aircraft left the Afghan Air Force in a weak position in relation to tribal operations for about a year and the Afghan Cover men! felt that they should do something to fill this gap. The Afghan authorities have been informed on several occasions that we do not think the Hurricane aircraft is entirely suitable for service in Afghanistan and that there may be difficulties in connection with the supply of spares. In spite of the advice given the Afghan Government consider that they are justified in putting forward this request. Will you kindly let me know what you think of the proposal, and say whether you are prepared to supply a sample Hurricane. 4.

The Ministry of Aircraft Production (as it then was) gave us very full information in their letter of 6 th February about many of the problems involved. Mr Squire does not however state whether the Afghans, in their anxiety to secure early delivery of the order, are prepared to forego the advantages of metal wings, so that it appears that we shall have to await the promised letter before proceeding with the placing of a firm order. Meanwhile we should be grateful for your advice on the procedure to be adopted v/hen we are in a position to do so. Je have recently made use of the India Store Department in placing an order for propellers for the Afghans, and it is understood that they are arranging with the Ministry, of Supply ^or inspection. But this procedure seems rather informal for this much more complicated and valuable order. The Air Ministry refused to to undertake responsibility -for the propelltlrs (value about 21050), but they might be more impressed by an order of the nature of £132,000. In any case they will presum* bly have to be approached to secure the necessary priorities. 16,v.46.External Department through R.I.A.F.L«0 . Ref: 3/3477»A. Q.C.Q. (Air ). Surply of Avro XIXtto Afghanistan * I have discussed the above subject with Mr. J. K. Horsefield (Air 3), Ministry of Supply, Thames House, Millbank, S.W.l. who agrees that the placing of the order for the Avro XIXs for Afghanistan should be done through his department. He mentioned that there are many bidders for the Avro XIXs and that the whole of the firms production of this aircraft is already ear marked against various orders for some considerable time ahead. I feel, therefore, that no time should be lost in communicating the Afghan requirement to the Ministry of Supply and that the utmost emphasis should be placed on the political and various other aspects which make it important that the Afghan request be satisfied at the earliest possible date. Although R. I.A.F.L. 0. says that Air Ministry are not interested in this matter I think it would be politic to inform D.A.F.L. Air Ministry, and ask for any support they can give towards ensuring these air craft being made available for early delivery.

We consider it important, for political reasons, that this order should be given reasonable priority. The operational squadrons of/of the Afghan Air Force are at present flying Hawker Hind aircraft; it is no longer possible to obtain spares on ary substantial scale for this type, and in spite of every effort on the part cf the British engineers responsible for their maintenance they are rapidly becoming unfit to take the air. The Afghan Air Force is the chief instrument of the Afghan Government in maintaining control over the backward and t turbulent tribal areas, and if the Hinds are not replaced very soon they may well be unable to prevent a conflagration which would inevitably spread to the North West Frontier of India, 3* While, no doubt, the Afghans could obtain aircraft of a type approximating to their requirements from the Americans, to encourage them to do so would be a reversal of our present policy (to which, as a matter of fact, the U.S, Government have explicitly agreed)• Whatever/Whatever Government supplies the aircraft will dominate the Air Force, ign- dominated Air Force in Afghanistan toms proved in Vri&gt; pfts4: a serious embarrassment to ^ when, before the war, the Italians supplied Romeo aircraft.

The provision of suitable aircraft would prevent any supply of American planes for this puxpose, and the establishment of an American Transport Service. Apparently the Americans are already /toying toying with the idea of supplying aircraft to Afghanistan. They consider that the use of planes supplied by us to establish a limited transport service for high officials from Afghanistan to India could eventually lead to a reciprocal arrangement by which we at some future date might also establish our own transport services to Afghanistan.(VC^ DEPTL.

Dear Taylor, I gathered from our disoussiobs today with Air Commodore Lowe and Messrs, ^ardwick and Pacsy tljat the Air Ministry are likely to approve your report which reoonraends that the Afghans should be / advised to make do with their Hinds for the time being and ^o buy new Avro XIX f s (with metalnrs) when these are available, , — . f- - - - * As regards delivery we estimate that A»V^Roe &amp; Co. Ltd., could start delivery o£ wooden aircraft in August next and of metal aircraft in December next*. On the basis that only 6 aircraft are required I think they should be able to complete the orders in 2 months from t the start of delivery. ■ If the position gets easier I.will notify ; you at once. . One thing is important viz. that the Afghans should be urged to place a firm order as soon as possible since this would help us to plan ahead.' t - * As regards price \ confim that there should be no great difference between the wooden and metal types. Both would cost in the region of £ 11 , 000 / 11 , 300 . We in MAP strongly recommend that, having regard to the Afghan climate, the metal aircraft should be used. Both the manufacturers and the Air Ministry agree with this. You asked for my advice on the method of delivering the aircraft, mentioning that you had already discussed this with Mr, CaygiH who had advised that they should be flown out. I understood from you that the Afghans would prefer not to have them flown out because to do so would use up some of the aircrafts T flying hours. I don’t think we can give you positive advice on this point because it depends so much on the Afghans’ personal wishes. On the one hand, if the aircraft are flown out there will be the advantage of knowing that they have been properly assembled and flight tested by the makers; but Wing Commander T a ylor, /against India Office, Whitehall.• V. _ V» . - affainst this advantage 371 x 1 will have to set off the deterioration and the risk Of loss during flight# On the other hand, if the aircraft are packed and shipped, the above disadvantages will be avoided, but there is then the danger that they will be badly re assembled on arrival and in any case additional cost will be incurred for stripping down, packing / freight and re-assembling, I estimate that the cost of stripping down and packing' (with weather-proof protection) would be approx,£ 300/400 per aircraft. Toil know more than we do about the skill of the men who would re-assemble the aircraft on arrival in India;' if there is any doubt about their ability to do the job it might be advisable to arrange for the manufacturer to send out an engineer to supervise the work of re-assembling, - I am cop 37 ing this letter to Lowe, Hardwick &lt;&amp; Pacey, i • ; Yours sincerely.Note by R»I«A«F»Liaison Officer, India Office* Since tliese papers were Iasi referred to me ihe matter has taken on an entirely new complexion due to the fact, as now disclosed,that the Afghans are seeking new aircraft to strengthen their hand before this spring, when trouble is expected in the Eastern &amp; Southern Provinces following the proposed change in the ^■iniership. It is not stated exactly when trouble is expected,but fox the purpose of air operations the beginning of April may be ^ taken as the target date, since in general the airfields are not sufficiently clear of snow till then, 2, ‘Ihe Afghans appear to contemplate the provision of new aircraft, namely AVRO XIX*s, as the solution of their immediate problem, but for the reasons set out later it is not possible for # the Afghan Air Force td operate a new &amp; modern type of aircraft as early as next April, 3 # There are now therefore two questions involved % (i) The provision of AVBO XIX*s as a permanent replacement for the Hinds; (ii) The best method of ensuring the maximum effectiveness of the Afghan Air Force by April next, ^he Afghans have intimated their requirements of AVHO XIX*s &amp; their choice is endorsed by Mr,Squire,(It should be noted in parenthesis that AVBO XIX is the makers* designations in the R.A.F. the machine is called the Anson &amp; the mark number varies according to the modifications adopted for particular Service purposes; for example Anson XII is the normal communications version, Anson XIX is the V,I,P. version of the XII,Anson XI is a bombing &amp; navigation trainer,&amp; so on. Since the Afghan requirement is peculiar to their own purposes, it is better to avoid the R,A.F. classifications &amp; the makers* generic designation). F A copy of the manufacturers*^'voidW- on the AVRO XIX is attached. 5 # The modifications which the Afghans require can,according to M.A.P., be carried out. But unless the supply position changes, which it is unlikely to do substantially, the earliest date for delivery ex works with the required modifications would be December to February next. This means that the aircraft could not • arrive in Afghanistan before the start of the 1947 campaigning season. This is the position for aircraft with metal wings.Aircraft ■yyiwooden wings could be delivered ex works about August—October of this year, but M.A.P.,Air Ministry &amp; the manufacturers strongly recommend that, having regard to the climate of Afghanistan, aircraft with metal wings should be purchased* 6 , If the Afghan Govt, wishes to ensure delivery of these aircraft by the time stated, it is important that they should place a firm order now, in order that production plans may take account of their requirements &amp; their order receive the maximum priority. 7. Owing to the difficulty of making accurate costing forecasts under present economic conditions in this country various estimates which have been made of the price of these aircraft in the past have unfortunately been badly out. However, M.A.P. now state that the price of these aircraft, either with metal or wooden wings, would be in the region of £11,000-11,500. The cost of the required modifications &amp; of delivery would amount to a few hundred pounds more for each aircraft.(It may be noted here that prevailing conditions have necessitated a revision of the estimated cost for the Dove : this is now about £14,000).y 8 . Regarding the performance of the AVRO XIX Mr*Squire now states that the possible inability to cross the Hindu Kush with full load is no longer an objection &amp; may even be an advantage. He makes no mention however of the take-off run; this varies somewnat according to the exact version in use but for a model modified as the Afghans require &amp; with metal wings it would probably be in the region of 800 yards with full load in ideal conditions at sea ■'\evel. I give below the airTiSTte which the Afghans would probably use in the event of operations in the pastern &amp; Southern Provinces with their altitudes &amp; the existing maximum^run into the prevailing wind# I also show against each uhe uaice—ofj- ruii of _ AVRO XIV corrected for altitude in the last column, the same figure with the addition of a 35^ safety margin, which is approximately what is allowed in the design of R.A.F. airfields. ■ KABUL (SHERHJB) 5,680 ft, 1,000 yds, 1,250 yds. 1,390 yds.

Aircraft however must at present use Sherpur as the only hangar &amp; maintenance facilities in the country are located there, as well as the bomb Sc ammunition stores; some extension of this airfield is understood to be possible by utilising the grounds of the Military club, but it appears that the Afghans are not prepared to do this &amp; may in fact be intending to restrict Sherpur, the only civil airfield, to its present size in order to prevent the Russians using larger aircraft on their civil air-line. It must therefore be impressed on the Afghan Govt, that if they buy aVRO XIX^ they must undertake considerable extensions to their airfields &amp; must hasten the completion of the proposed hangars &amp; maintenance install ations at Kwaja Rawash. They should also bear in mind the dimensions of the AVRO XIX &amp; ensure that their hangars will accommodate them. 10. Regarding spares for the AVRO XIX, there are few indications to support Mr.Squire ! s statement that the Anson will be used operationally on the H.W.Prontier, though it will be in use in the R.A.F. as a communications aircraft for some years to come. Nevertheless as a basic type it is^rather old aircraft &amp; the Afghan Govt, would be well advised to purchase plenty of spares now: bearing in mind the rough handling these aircraft are likely to receive it would not be excessive to purchase spares for 5^years. 11. Regarding the mode of delivery, the Afghans have stated their reasons for requiring delivery by sea. This is a matter which can be settled nearer the time, but against the factors which the Afghans mention must be balanced the advantage, if the aircraft are flown out, of having them assembled &amp; flight-tested by the manufacturers &amp; the additional cost,if they are shipped out, entailed in stripping—down, painting^ &amp; reassembling, which is estimated at not less than £200—400 per aircraft.12. The suggestion that Afghan pilots take over the aircraft at Karachi &amp; fly them to Kabul appears to ignore the necessity for extensive conversion training before they could handle the new type safely. W/Cdr. King can judge best how many hours the Afghan pilots would require for conversion to AVRO XXX^s &amp;, if it is the intention of the Afghan Government to send their pilots to India for this training,they should vilculate their requirements &amp; inform Air Headquarters, India of them as far ahead as possible. 13. To turn to the second question, how to ensure the maximum effectiveness of the Afghan Air Force by April next, it has already been stated that AVRO XIX T s could not be supplied by then. Nor would it be practicable for them to purchase some more readily available type of aircraft, such as the Hurricane, as a stop-gap, since their pilots could not be operationally proficient on the new type in time; for an R.I.A.F. pilot to convert from Hinds to Hurricanes would take 10-12 weeks;to convert to a twin-engined type would take even longer; the Afghans would certainly require more time than the R.I.A.F; moreover owing to the snow-bound condition of the Kabul airfields during the next two months &amp; the need for efficient maintenance during the training period this conversion training would have to be carried out in India &amp; it might well be impossible for the R.^A.F. in India to undertake this extra commitment at such short notice. 14. The question therefore boils down to the fact that the only practicable solution is to make the best use of the existing Hinds. 15. The Afghan Air Force flying Hinds have dealt effectively enough with tribal disturbances in the past &amp; it is simply a matter of ensuring that an adequate number of aircraft are serviceable &amp; able to operate. 16. There are now 12 Hinds serviceable &amp; 13 unserviceable but repairable. Before the f(unar operations last summer there were 24 serviceable &amp; 2 unserviceable for*want of propellors. The change is due to minor mishaps during these operations. A detailed order for the spares required to make good the damage has been received but, though every possible source of Hind spares is being investigated, it appears most improbable that any stocks remain of the parts required. Cannibalisation should effect an increase in the number of serviceable aircraft &amp; af the Afghans supplied us with a statement showing in detail the condition ofeach aircraft it could be seen whether there were not some particular parts which would warrant special manufacture, - as propellors are being manufactured at the moment. They should also be asked whether there is any further technical assistance we can gice them, such as sending further skilled tradesmen to Kabul. 17. It should be borne in mind that the Afghans have not in the past been in the habit of using more than about 12 aircraft on a particular series of operations &amp; the Measures suggested should therefore give them an adequate reserve for dealing with trouble on the scale of that of recent years. 18. In addition the suggestion previously made of fitting supply-dropping equipment to some of the Hinds should be put into effect in time to give the pilots practice with it before the Spring. 19. Furthermore, if the condition of the ground permits it at this season of the year, the Afghans should make every effort to improve the surface of the airfields they are likely to use. The rough surfaces of these airfields at present are a substantial cause of accidents to aircraft &amp; one that could easily be eliminated. In this Connection, as well as the extension of airfields referred to above, it would probably be worth their while to engage experts in airfield construction from India +r* direct their own labour. maia toCttt 20 . The latest communications from Kabul indicate that the Afghan Government have little idea how great the demand is for British Aircraft of the kind they want &amp; how difficult the supply position is in consequence. Nor do they appear to have considered all the practical implications of purchasing a new &amp; more modern type of aircraft for their Air Force. They may be some danger therefore of being buoyed up by optimistic &amp; impractical expectations &amp; it is suggested that the best service we can render them now is to bring them down to hard tacks &amp; help them to get the utmost out of their available resources.

It is most unfortunate that there should be this difference of opinion between the Air :.?iniatry and India over the best type of aircraft for supply to the Afghan Government; and our difficulties are of course accentuated by the fact that the Afghans are so anxious to make an immediate decision and have the first supplies made by the spring in order to meet possible trouble in the eastern and Southern Provinces. Our difficulties have been further enhanced by the fact that we have already quoted the price of £8,600/- which ■Vlgginton gave us, apparently quit* erroneously, to the Afghan*. The encloeea copy of Lancaster’a letter to i^ginr.on will explain our position more clearly, k• I understand that the Avro XIX has been selected by India for use on the Nox tn-^est Frontier, if this is correct then in spite of the objections mentioned by th* India office it seem® to Gtf th^r* are v*ry great advantages in Afghanistan being equipped with the same type of machine. The supply of spare parts becomes much easiex; there is no necessity for Afghanistan to hold large atocica; and it is also easy, as in the case of rifles and anr.raunition, to cut them off if at any time our illations deteriorate. The fact that the Avro XIX cannot easily cross the Hindu Kush with a full load is not such a v*&gt;ry serious disadvantage as it is unlikely to be required for operations against the local inhabitants in northern Afghanistan. In fact it might in soma ways be an advantage it' we could reply to possible .u^aian objections that the plane we are supplying is not one which could be used in operations against them. c. A further advantage in the Avro seems to be the fact that it is aa suitaole for civilian as for military purposes and if we can supply it for the Afghan Air Force it will be possible for them to use it also as a nucleus for any civil aviation services they may wish to start and thus give us the great advantage of getting in on that too.- 2 - IX, as probabl# f it ia imposaibla to supply th« six planaa ifthich ths Afghans have aakad for immadiately thay ara most anxious U.at ih*y should hava at least two of tha*.

When the aircraft and the spare parts arrived at Kabul, the Agreement which had been concluded with Mr.; Russel-Stracey expired and he accordingly left this country. He therefore nominated Mr. Bradley, the mechanic, to act as representative of the Hawkers Aircraft Company, as far as the making over of the aircraft and parts was concerned. The air craft and the spare parts when received were consequently checked with the original list in the presence of Mr. Biadiey and as a result si&gt;f items of spare parts were found to be missing. Mr* Bradley has accordingly signed a note in which he agrees that the Hawkers Company should make these parts good. Therefore in intimating these facts to the British negation, it is requested that n-cessary steps will kinlly be taken to ensure that the Hawkers Company make good the six items of parts vide av.i . -Bradley's note enclosed herewith.

You may wish to tone down the penultimate paragraph of your letter in view of this information about the Avro - XIX. It wouldn’t do for bombing and it'sfar from ideal for transport. You may like to read the attached D.O. letter which I have just received ^rom Vf/Cdr.diggington, now dealing with I these matters at A.H.,^.(l). The copy letter from A/Cdre. Long which he encloses is for you to keep; Perris or Miss holfe were wanting it. I agree with y/iggington about the objection to the Defiant. As already stated, the Avro XIX which he mentions won’t be suitable for Afghanistan as an operational type either and it therefore looks as though we have cometo the end of the list as far as R.A.F. aircraft are concerned. The trouble is the Afghans' insistence on a two-seater. However the Fleet Air Arm has gone in for two-seaters much more than we have andthey may have suitable aircraft to dispose of. The Swordfish for instance, though it looks antiquated, is a very good aircraft and should answer their requirements, though I don't know exactly what its performance is or what the spores situation is like. Much more modern and a first- c3.ass aircraft is the Firefly, but this might be too heavy for the Afghans to handle. it: You may like to put the problem to the Admiralty. Mr Mossop of the Newu,rals Section, Political Branch (Whitehall 9000/808 or 1045) seems to be the person to approach in the first instance.(COPY) H.I.A*F. Liaison Officer Transport Aircraft for Afghanistan* Reference attached papers, I have made enquiries at Air Ministry and M.A.P. and the answer is that we have no really suitable aircraft to offer the Afghans. None of the older types of transport aircraft, of which surplus stocks may be available at bargain prices, have the requisite ceiling with the exception of the Percival ^.6 ('Petrel'); but the Petrel is an obsolete aircraft, only a very few are available, and if we supply £hese to the Afghans there is the danger that we shall very soon have the same difficulty over spares that we are having with the Hinds now. 2* I^l.A.P. are enquiring for me at the moment what spares, if any, are available, but even if a fairly good stock can be supplied I am not satisfied that we should do ourselves good in the long run by selling the Afghans such an old and obsolete aircraft. 3. As you know, we have not manufactured any light transport aircraft in this country during the war with the result that there is a serious gap between the older types already dealt with and the new designs which are just starting production. In the latter class we shall soon have an excellent little passenger aircraft in the Dove, but this will not be available for a few months and will cost as much as £12,GOO. You will appreciate therefore that the only aircraft of which second hand stocks may be available at reduced prices are the old models which are not satisfactory for our purpose. 4. However, the Afghan demand for transport aircraft divides itself into two different requirements:- (a) an immediate demand for two aircraft for supply dropping, and (b) an enquiry for about 6 passenger aircraft to equip their proposed transport flight, though perhaps it would be more correct to describe this as an ambition rather than a present requirement. 5. Their needs under (a) can perfectly well be satisfied by fitting supply dropping equipment to their existing Hinds. They are not likely to be faced with a heavier supply dropping commitment than arose this summer in the Kunar, when according to their own statement the Hinds carried the loads required, only the method of dropping (over the side) proving inefficient. Group Captain HARTLEY has confirmed with M.A.P. that the standard parachute and container can be carried on the bomb racks of the Hind and in these circumstances it would seem to be an unjustifiable extravagance for the Afghans to purchase special aircraft for this purpose. Perhaps this suggestion may be put to the Afghans and, if they agree, two of^their Hinds could be flown to India for fitting and testing the supply dropping equipment 6. as regards requirement (b), the Dove is all we can offer in the immediate future and it costs much more than the Afghans contemplate paying, though probably not a great deal more than the market price of the Expeditor; I cannot speak about the price of Russian light transport arcraft, but I do not believe they have anytnmg to compare with the Dove or the Expeditor at present. However I wonder whether the Afghans seriously contemplate spending the money to equip a transport flight in the near future; it would seem that the re-equipment of their /operationaloperational squadrons is a more pressing need and that this will absorb the available money for some little time to come. 7. I enclose a very handsome brocnure about the Dove which de Havilland’s have issued and which you may care to send to the Afghans. If the transport flight is only a pipe- dream at the moment this brochure should provide material for dreaming for the present and in perhaps a couple of years we may have something else to offer, for example the Anson XII (alias Avro XIX), to which reference has been made: it costs new more than the Dove, but it is being produced now in some numbers for the R.A.F., so that second-hand stocks at reduced prices should be available in due course. In other respects it compares very unfavourably with the Dove, since its ceiling at all-up weight (10,400 lbs.) is only 15,000 ft. in ideal conditions and it could only reach 17,000 ft., the minimum for safe crossing of the Hindu Kush, with a sacrifice of at least 1,000 lbs. useful load; moreover its take-off run at all-up weight is in ideal conditions 700 yards at sea level, i.e. 1,240 yards at 7,000 ft., which means that it could only operate with reduced load from airfields of the altitude of Kabul. It might therefore do as a stop-gap just for carrying small loads of passengers and mail but not for heavier loads such as bombs. The only alternative is to sell them now an aircraft such as the Petrel which I fear will give trouble before very long. 8.

Reference attached papers, I have made enquiries at Air Ministry and M.A.P. and the answer is that we have no really suitable aircraft to offer the £ghans. None of the older types of transport aircraft, of which surplus stocks may be available at bargain prices, have the requisite ceiling with the exception of the Per«ri«ral Q.6 ('Petrel”); but the Petrel is an obsolete aircraft, only a very few are available, and if we supply these to the Afghans there is the danger that we shall very soon have the same difficulty over spares that we are having with the Hinds now. 2* M.A.P* are enquiring for me at the moment what spares, if any, are available, but even if a fairly good stock can be supplied I am not satisfied that we should do ourselves good in the long run by selling the Afghans such an old and obsolete aircraft. 3. As you know, we have not manufactured any light transport aircraft in this country during the war with the result that there is a serious gap between the older types already dealt with and the new desi^gs which are just starting production. In the latter class we shall soon have an excellent little passenger aircraft in the Dove, but this will not be available for a few months and will cost as much as £12,500. You will appreciate therefore that the only aircraft of which second-hand stocks may be available at reduced prices are the old models wnicn are not satisfactory for our purpose. 4. However, the Afghan demand for transport aircraft divides itself into two different requirements (a) an immediate demand for two aircraft for supply dropping, and (b) an enquiry for about 6 passeng.er aircraft to eqmip their proposed transport flight, though perhaps it would be more correct to describe this as an ambition rather them a present requirement. 5. Their needs under (a) can perfectly well be satisfied by fitting supply dropping equipment to their existing Hinds. They are not likely to be faced with a heavier supply dropping commitment than arose this summer in the Kunar, when according to their own statement the Hinds carried the loads required, only the method of dropping (over the side) proving inefficient. Group Captain Hartley has confirmed with M.A.P. that the standard parachute and container can be carried on the bomb racks of the Hind and in these circumstances it would seem to be an unjustifiable extravagance for the Afghans to purchase special aircraft for this purpose. Perhaps this suggestion may be put to the Afghans and, if they agree, two of their Hinds could be flown to India for fitting and testing the supply dropping equipment. 6. As regards requirement (b), the Dove is all we can offer in the immediate future and it costs much more than the Afghans contemplate pacing, though probably not a great deal more than the market price of the Expeditor; I cannot speak about the price of Russian light transport aircraft...aircraft, but I do not believe they have anything to compare with the Dove or the Expeditor at present. However I wonder wheoher the Afghans seriously contemplate spending the money to equip a transport flight in the near future; it would seem tnat the re-equipment of their operational squadrons is a more pressing need and that this will absorb the available money for some little time to come. I enclose a very handsome brochure about the Dove which de Havilland's have isaed and which you may care to send to the Afghans. If the transport flight is only a pipe-dream at the moment this brochure should provide material for dreaming for the present and in perhaps a couple of years we may have something else^to offer, such as a modernised development of the Anson, which will give the performance they require. ihe only alternative is to sell them now an aircraft such as the fetrel which I fear will give trouble before very long. 8 * If you decide to send this brochure to Kabul, will you please ask External Affairs Dept, to show it to Air Headquarters before sending it on, as they will no doubt like to note the particulars about this aircraft. 9 * Ike Air Ministry file containing Mr Cleary's unanswered letter to Mr Hardwick is at present floating round M•A•P• collecting minutes. A detailed reply will be sent when all the required inforoation, including the position regarding Petrel spares, has been collected. S' EXTERNAL DEPARTMENT . CMiss Rdtf e) V7ing Commander, R.I.A.P.

There axe three points which I would be very grateful if you coula fina time to take up* , t e have for sane time been searching for a suitable general ^ ^pose aircraft for the Afghan Air Force principally for use^ in maintaining order in Tribal Areas (the particulars required^ will be found on the file attached at Ext. 768/45 )• When passing through Delhi in the summer en route to this country Mr* Squire mentioned this point to the Coninander-in-Chief, who replied that he himself was searching for such a type for similar purposes on the frontier but had not yet succeeded in finding one. Several months have now elapsed but neither ourselves nor the Air Ministry have heard whether his enquiries have made any progress. I should perhaps ^dd that rfing Commander Taylor is of the opinion that the Defiant, concerning which we wrote to India in our Express Letter ho. Ext. 4357/45 'l 0th »Deptember 1945&gt; might be suitable: I understand that General Auchinleck was not aware of the availability of this type at the time of his conversation with Mr. Squire. I believe that Group Captain Hartley, who has been working with this Department in liaison with the Air Ministry on this question, is leaving for India on 14th November ano you might find useful his knowledge of the background of this and other relevant points on the supply of aircraft to the Afghans. 2. I also attach the papers about the future of the Gurkha units of the Indian Amy. You noted on the file that until discussions about the post-war strength of the Indian Army had been concluded and until the Commander-in-Chief had discussed the question with the liaharaja of Nepal, nothing could be /settledsettled even provisionally. General Auchinleck has now visited Katmandu, and perhaps it might be worth while to take up the question again* do • 3* It might be worth while for you to speak to G.H.Q* and/or External Affairs Department about the question of the reversion of the Indian command boundary to the Eastern frontier of I^rsia - / ^* v and the connected question of the withdrawal of the Indian Long^, Range Squadron from the Zahidan-Me shed road. You will remember that there has been a rOcent exchange of telegrams between G.H.Q.

Many inquiries for technical information and supply of R.A.F. equipment are being received by R.A.F. commands, formations and units from foreign Governments, in particular those of liberated European Allies, and it is possible some of these are being dealt with locally, in error.. 2. Many factors (e.g., politcal, strategic, economic, policy for disposal of surplus stores (including lend-lease items) maintaining of good name of British manufacturers, etc.,) have to be taken into account when considering these inquiries. It is, therefore, essential in the interests of both the U.K. Government and the foreign Government that no arrangements for, or promise of supply of technical information or equipment, be made by R.A.F. commands, formations and units but all such inquiries and requests received from an official source be referred to the Air Ministry and that there be a procedure for canalisation of these on the department. * \ r c i'f - ^1 IP 4 ‘ ' r ‘* r | v Y * • * 5 . The following procedure for dealing with such inquiries and requests is, therefore, to be applied:- (i) Inquiries and requests received by commands, formations and units are to be referred to the R.A.F. Mission where one is established in the particular country concerned, or otherwise to the British Air Attache with information on availability of the equipment locally and any comments of the command, formation or unit. . (ii) The R.A.F. Mission or British Air Attache will obtain confirmation that the inquiry or request is an official one, if necessary, and communicate it to the Air Ministry (D.A.F.L. ). If the request is made j.n writing by the. foreign Government a certified r /copycopy of the original is to be forwarded, together with an English translation. (iii) Notification of Air Ministry decisions and, where approved, particulars of conditions of supply of the equipment will be sent to the British Mission or British Air Attache for ccramunication to the foreign Government. (iv) Where issue from local stocks is involved instructions will be given to the command, formation or unit by the Air Ministry (D.D.E.14) and a copy sent to the R.A.F. Mission or British Air Attache through the Air Ministry (D.A.F.L.) for information and communication to the foreign Government. (v) Arrangements for issue from the United Kingdom or source other than local, whether from R.A.F. stocks or new construction, will be made by the Air Ministry. The R.A.F. Mission or British Air Attache will be notified of these arrangements by the Air Ministry (D.A.F.L. ) for information and ccxnmunication to the foreign Government. (vi) Arrangements for the inspection and acceptance of the equipment before delivery in the case of sub para, (iv) above are to be made by the R.A.F. Mission o** British Air Attache with the foreign Government and the R.A.F. command, formation or unit; arrangements will be made by the Air Ministry in the case of sub para. (v) above. ( v ii) Completion of deliverd.es of approved issues of equipment or technical information will - (a) in the case of sub-para.(iv) above be notified by the command, formation or unit to the R.A.F.

(zifz) Ref: 3/3477*A. 0. C. 0. (Ai r). I have ascertained from the Air Ministry, All, that there is no objection to the information contained in their telegram AIX 264 of 14th August being communicated to Kabul. In fact they were desirous that Afghanistan and certain other countries where there is no Air Attache should be informed and to this '‘•-’“'ad copies of the telegram had been sent to.the Foreign Office requesting them to infom the countries concerned. lA'i. I understand that a Mr. Cheetham is the person in the Foreign Office to whom the telegram was sent and I suggest it ma^r be worth while checking up with him to see what he has done t it. From the list of aircraft detailed in the Air Ministry signal there is only one, so far as I can see, which might fulfil the requirements of the Afghans for a single engine general purpose two seater aircraft and that is the Defiant. I have obtained the performance figures for the Defiant arid these are as follows Ceiling Cruising range Take-off speed Max. speed at 22,500 r.p.m. Cruising speed at 10,000 feet Take-off run at X7,000 feet 32,500 ft. 850 miles with 160 galls. fuel. 84 m.p.h. 310 m.p.h. 71 m.p.h. 350 yards. The Defiant was introduced as a two seater fighter and is fitted with a gun turret which I imagine would not be required by the Afghans and it might entail extensive alteration to make it suitable for their needs, but if you feel there is any likeli hood of them being interested in the type I think it would be necessary to obtain further details about it to ascertain whether or not it could be modified to fulfil the requirements. /ItIt would seem from the list of types in the Air Ministry signal that the Defiant was also used as a target towing aircraft and although there is no quantity stated against this series it is possible that the T.T. type may be more readily convertable to a general purpose aircraft. If you will let me know whether you woul /s —- ike fuller details about this I will endeavour to obtain uhe information for you. I am surprised to learn that the Government of India do not think the Dominie would be suitable for Afghanistan or Nepal, but since they have had experience with this type in India they undoubtedly know what they are talking about.

ThJy,—after-gL^ltftle thought, is ooviously -viride of the mark and is, in fact, roughly the cost of conversion to make it suitable for civil use. The price suggested for the aeroplane without fur nishings, seating and wireless etc., is £5,500. I am attaching a copy of a note prepared by the Aircraft Disposals Committee on selling prices and as this gives con siderable detail about the Dominie I thought you might find it of interest. ,.0^ Yours D. M. Cleary Esq., External Department, India Office, . S.W.l. RtCorPCDO* 1 - 30 JUL1945 INDIA OFFICE /h. a-M LC* jt tA^jrAIRCRAFT DISPOSALS COMMITTEE Note from th e Sub -Comm i ttee on Se lling Prices I! 1. The sub-committee, consisting of representatives of the M.A.P. (D of C(D)), Civil Aviation Department and Treasury, noted that the present aim of the main Cominittee is to obtain agreement with the U.S.A. and Canada to impose 'quanti-. tative control'* on the disposal of surplus aircraft, coupled with the adoption of common principles in price fixing, and, accordingly, that they should confine their present consideration to methods consistent with this aim, i.e., to the principles applicaole to fixed prices assuming a broad equilibrium between supply ana demand. It may, however, prove that no effective agreement can be reached with the Americans on quantitative control, and in face of this uncertainty the suo—committee felt it would not be profitable at this stage to attempt an elaborate definition of price fixing principles for the eventual field and that it could more usefully consider how to deal with types now coming into the field of sale. Such ad hoc consideration should nevertheless have regard to the principles which the Americans have announced an intention to observe. 2. No British surpluses of large Transport types (Group l) are foreseen in the near future. In the small transport group (Group II) the Dominie presents an immediate problem and, as the following particulars show, it can suitably be described as a 'base model' for pricing purposes:- (i) The Dominie is derived from a true civil type (Dragon Rapide) (ii) It requires little structural modification, but chiefly fur nishings, to make it suitable as a civil transnort. (iii) It is much sought alter because its perfoimance and running costs place it ahead of any other U.K. civil type likely to be available for some time to come. (iv) Enquiries are on hand, with a view to purchase from Belgian Congo, E. Africa, Egypt, Iraq, Persia, Portugal, S. Africa, W. Indies and within U.K. 3. For the present the Americans are basing disposal prices of transport types on cost, although it is significant that they have left loopholes through which to escape from a cost basis and have also advised their customers of the prospect of downward revision in future prices. It is felt that present selling prices for the Dominie should likewise be firmly based on its cost, but that we must be pre pared to interpret this basis with some flexibility having always in mind the desirability of paving the way from the price-fixing point of view for the genuinely civil types of transport aircraft which our manufacturers will later be producing. On this oasis the sub-committee considered that a price for the Dominie should be settled as shown below. A. De Kavilland * s, the designing fim, ceased Dominie manufacture early in the war, and their pre-war prices must be regarded as outdated and irrelevant to any present determination of an econanic purchase or sale price. Manufacture ftr the M.A.P. has since been in the sole hands of Brush Coachwork Ltd., and it is con sidered that the price for their production is the only and the proper standard to tax:e into account. Suggestions that Brush costs are seriously inflated and uneconomic by reason if inexperience in aircraft manufacture must, it is thought now be discounted. A representative of De Havilland has recently stated that his Company could not make more cheaply than Brush if they recommenced manufacture (which they have no present intention of doing), and that they consider a civil Dominie, fui*nished and equipped to customer’s noraal requirements, would call for a quotation of £7*000 to £7,500. (N.B. It should be recorded that this figure quotation ) ntl ° ned in circumstances which &amp; ave it the status of a formal commercial / The elements in the cost of a Dominie are:- for R.A.F. use:- Airframe (made by Brush) Engines (2) Issued by M.A.P. to Brush for embodiment, Propellers ) Issued by M.A.P. to Brush for Other equipment ) embodiment. ^and, for civil use , additions chiefly:- Seats, upholstery and amenities for passengers Yfireless provision (civil) Arrangements have been made for De Havillands to convert to civil standard 50 Dominies already equipped for signals training which have become surplus to R.A.F. requirements. The actual cost of conversion will vary according to lay-out required by the individual purchaser. De Havillands estimate the average cost of conversion at about £1,500. It is clear that this combination of Brush and De Havillands in completing Dominies for sale to civil standards will have to continue whether De Havillands themselves are allowed to accept orders (sub-contracting to Brush) or whether aircraft are transferred to De Havillands from Brush off the M.A.P. contract or (new) from stock. As these 50 aircraft will probably be insufficient to meet all demands, there would be some saving in total cost if further requirements were met not by conversion of aircraft already turned out for the R.A.F. but by arranging for some air frames to be earmarked from the outset for completion to civil standard. There would presumably be such earmarking in any case where De Havilland themselves sub-contracted the airframe to Brush. 5. The sub-committee have considered these matters, and the data available on the total cost to the M.A.P. of acquiring Dominies in current production. They understand that no figure is available showing with precision the commercial cost of a wholly civil Dominie and that indefinite delay might be involved in waiting for one. Hven then it is doubtful whether the conclusion they think should be drawn from data now available would be altered. Taking into account the desirability of having one price for the time being, whether the airframes are or are not made from the outset to civil specification, and the data available as to costs, the sub-committee recommend, for transactions now under consideration and until further notice, a selling price of £5,500 for airframe, two engines, propellers, and the usual equipment common to service and civil flying requirements (i.e. without R.A.F. wireless). Furnishings, seating, civil wireless etc., to the customer’s requirements will be extra, and it will be for them to make known their requirements. 6. The basic price of £5,500 as defined above should be applicable to all sales in which the M.A.P. is concerned, whether sale takes place direct to a customer or to De Havilland's (for subsequent sale by the Company). No reason was seen for thinking that this price would be unacceptable to any of the present appli cants. If De Havilland's sell, whether by sub-contracting to Brush or by purchasing from M.A.P. it is considered important to ensure that they do not sell below their costs, as it is remotely possible they might wish to do for some business reason of their own. If they did, differing prices would be on offer to different custoners, to the embarrassment of disposal policy. It is, therefore, proposed that D of C(D) should obtain an undertaking from De Havilland (if, in fact, they are willing to sell Dominies or, if willing, are allowed to at present) that they will not sell below cost without prior consultation with the Department. Conversely it should also be ensured that their prices are not inflated. 7. The sub-committee will give later attention to the pricing of the Anson and Oxford (which can be regarded as falling in the small transport group headed by Dominie), and of the Tiger Moth, Magister, Proctor and Auster in the light air craft class. 8. Since the above recorded discussion, the question of Dominie sales has been further explored with a representative of De Havillands. The Company has now stated that it does not at present wish to handle the sales and would prefer the Government to continue selling until assignment difficulties are overcome and circumstances are generally more favourable for commercial transactions. *It is^ therefore, proposed that such sales as may be authorised for the present should be conducted by the M.A.P. and the matter reviewed in due course. Departmental dale does not prevent, and should in no way discourage, separate arrangements between purchaser and company for the provision of servicing if it is required. Where companies are not (as in this case) themselves handling sales, the M.A.P. will keep them informed and encourage their subsequent contact with purchasers. 29th December, 1944*Sin JutY IQTH, T &lt;)45 FLIGHT Advertisements. 17 I Kj dragon rapide chosen for economy and simplicity In Iceland, as in many countries, frigid, temperate and tropical, Dragon Rapides, of both pre-war and current production, are faithfully serving the demands of low-density air traffic.

The enquiry about transport aircraft is a new one and we should clearly endeavour to ensure that theX provided with British rather than American planes.

Hardwick, Esq,, S.9.S., Air Ministry, Bush House, f 3 AUG 1945 Dear Hardwick, With reference to our telephone conversation on the 27 th July about the enclosed telegram regarding the supply of aircraft to Afghanistan, we do not appear to have received a copy of the signal referred to in firnt paragraph 2- but I understood you to say that it sought Air Ministry approval to the supply of 8 Tiger Moths from ACSEA's own resources and that the Air Ministry are considering the question of prices before agreeing* On this question of price, I should like to draw your attention to the third paragraph of our official letter No. Ext. 778/45 dated 3rd March, 1945 in which we emphasised that in our view and that of the Government of India, the price should/should not only be fixed in relation to the low prices, lively to obtain after the war but should {tuf also fully resp«e%- h.M.G-'s policy of securing A so far as possible that Afghanistan should rely on the resources of this country and India for the maintenance of her military strength. Since that letter was written we have received evidence of Russia's increasing interest in Afghanistan's future development^, and although the Afghans do not appear to be disposed to accept their advances there is always the danger that they might accept an offer of aircraft fran the Russians if we ourselves put our price^ too high. Another danger is that the Americans^who will have vast quantities of surplus aircraft after the war ^might well cut us out of the market/market by making the Afghans a very generous offer. For these reasons we hope that you will accept more or less nominal prices for the aircraft We assume in any case that the price of the Tiger Moths will not exceed jG 600^©Q'which was the figure quoted by Whyte of^Department ZA in his letter to me of the 6 th April (F6D/1)• On the basis of this information we informed India in our telegram No. 9125 of the 25 th April that this was the lowest likely present price of a Moth. At this stage of the war the G-overnment of India would expect the price to decrease rather than the reverse. Turning to the last two paragraphs of the Sovornment of Indian telegram^we notice that the$ do not include the Dominie in th^ list of possible types. As far as Iritis information goes this^ought to suit Afghanistan^ requirements and we understand that a number are at present being converted to civilian use and that it might be possible to make sane of them available to the Afghans. 7/e should therefore/■ A therefore be glad if you would include this in the Government of India list and let us have the details requieHrfce by the Government of India in respect of thbse which you consider suitable.

We were sorry not to be able to give you a more conplete reply to your telegram of the 16th February, and I think that the enclosed letter from Sir C. irbrtal, the (,h ef of u r otaff, will help to explain the reason wi^y. A further reason for the delay, which is not brought out in Sir C.

As this procedure was obviously going to take a long time, we persuaded them to give us such information as they had been able to acquire up to date in order that we could let you have an interim reply. Although I believe that the Air Ministry are still proceeding with their costing, I very in^h doubt whether their labours will bear fruit because, as soon as we know what exactly the Afghans want, we would pro pose to press H.M.G. to supply the aircraft and equipment on the basis indicated in paragraph 4 of your telegram.

TOP SECRET 25th April, 1945. My dear Mayne, . , will remember that last month we diacuased the question of supplies of aircraft and equipment to Af^taniatan. . I regret the delay in replying to you, but it is due to the many efforts we have made with the Aircraft Supply Department here in an endeavour to find a suitable type of aircraft to recomoend to the Afghans. In spite of these efforts the Hurricane remains the best type which can be made aircraft for tribal control and for this purpose of course, the Hurricane is suitable. It would be better if we could have offered a two or three seater aircraft which could serve for both control and couraunioation purposes. Unfortunately, the Oxford, which is the only British aircraft likely to fulfil these requirements is in very short supply and we would find it extremely difficult to spare any for some time. Besides the Afghans are not trained on twin-engined aircraft, find they would incur a new training commitment. I have gone into the question of providing such types as the Naval Swordfish or the Master, but the ceiling of the Swordfish is too lew* and I ara informed that an offer of Masters rejected in March, 1944* There is no other British single- engined two-seater general purpose aircraft which meets the Afghan specification and could be made available. which could be made available are not new and would require' complete overhaul, I do not recommend this.

Dear Cleary, Your letter of 27th March, addressed to Mr. Grant on the subject of aircraft for the Afghans, has been forwarded to Mr. Short who is the head of this division, and I am replying in his absence on official duties. I apologise for the delay but the relative papers have been circulating in this Department and have only just reached me. Mr. Grant, I believe, has already told you of our difficulty in quoting a price for post war sales, we have consulted the Director of Contracts in M.A.P. who is responsible for Disposals and it is his opinion that at the present time we could not let Tiger Moths go for less than £600 each. With regard to the combatant types, it is not feasible for us to go to the Treasury to obtain sanction for special prices without knowing what types are actually required. M.A.P. has however intimated that surplus combatant aircraft will most likely, in agreement with the U.S.A. # be scrapped after the terSmation of hostilities. It might be possible to obtain consent from the Air Assignments sub-committee to the sale of a small quantity. The sale would be dictated by strategic and political and not by financial considerations. You will appreciate, therefore, our difficulties in giving any definite information at the present time.

R.Please see iubmfssion Ext* 84/45 wherein we told India that the only available aircraft which would meet Afghanistan’s requirements were hurricanes, and that even these would not be two-seaters. The Government of India telegram below shows that the Afghan Mission are still anxious to get twe-seaters, but that they have also displayed an interest in certain other types. These are enumerated in para 2 (O of Government of India telegram, but in addition the Government of India think that the enquiries should be made as to the availability of Fairy Fulmars and Fireflies. As for those specified by the Afghans, we have already told India that Hurricane Filter Bombers are available,tfr»ighthe price we quoted (£4*500) is no doubt high in the light of the criteria indicated in paragraph 4 of their telegram. As for the Spitfires, I very much doubt whether there is anyone in the Afghan Air Force c AP^ble flying one, much less a Mosquito, but as the ry have included this in their list, we have no alternative but to ask the Air Ministry to supply the required information. In doing so, we might again draw attention to the statement that two-seater hurricane Fighter Bombers have been in operation in Russia. The Air Ministry previously denied all knowledge of such aircraft, but Hr .Squire demi-official letter forwarded a cutting fro:: the 'Aeroplane' depicting one of thete aircraft^ I have taxed the Air Ministry about this ever the phone, and they Lave admitted that a umber of such conversions were made in the past in Russia, but they adhere to their statement that no such aircraft exists in the R.A.F. 0thefjl reasons apart, I think that in view of the unsatisfactory nature of this reply we must on this occasion approacl the Air Ministry officially. A draft official letter to the Air Ministry is accordingly submitted asking them to give further consideration to the possibility of providing two-seaters and in addition to supply the details asked for by the Afghan Mission# The opportunity is also taken to lay emphasis o* para. 4 of Government of India telegram to remind the Air Ministry that in 193? they sold Afghan reconditioned Hinds at £l,5C0 a^piece . In order to ensure tiat thia matter gets full and prompt Attention by the Air Ministry, Hfi+trCrfaS *., it is suggested gthat General Mayne might take an opportunity of speaking to Air Chief Marshal Portal on the subject, and as an aide memo ire, he might hand him a copy of the official letter when it is approved for issue. .Yar staff - for observation^. ^ LcJ: Ixl (.^&lt;1 Ol-, A? /-© ^ hCLCvCj L~A ^ -M. &lt;s ° f-m t ^ j^u ^ m ?

The gist of this is that the Afghans want 12 two-seater general purpose aircraft, combining the functions of recce, and light fighter bombers, at a reasonable price* The Air Llinistry up to date can only offer single seater Hurricanes at £4,500 each. It is stated by Mr. Squire, Minister in Kabul that two- seater Hurricanes have been used in Russia but the Air Ministry say no such aircraft exist in the R.A.F. The Afghans also seek information about other types. The Government of India emphasise that it is a cardinal feature of their policy that the Afghan Air Force should be supplied with British aircraft and equipment, and that the prices should bear some relation to the low prices which will probably prevail after the war. It is doubtful if this has so far been entirely appreciated by A.l:. officials in dealing with the matter.

Question of payment for token military supplies to Afghan Government is under consideration. It has been general practice in the past that Afghan Govern ment pay for equipment supplies though they have been granted easy instalments. Informal conversations with Afghan C.G. S. here suggest this is intention of Afghan Government on this occasion also. On the other hand M.P.A. referred in conversation reported in enclosure jio your D.O. 706/44/NGO of November 24th to financial as well as material aid to Afghanistan - see point (ill). Government of India presume that this meant no more than grant of credit and easy instalments for repay ment. They will ba glad of your comments.It will be recalled that the Government of India recently sought H.M*G‘s approval to their making the Afghan Military Mission - which is -at present touring India - a token offer of certain military munitions and equipment. This proposal was put to the London Munitions Assignment Board, and approved so far as non-Lend/Lease material was concerned. The Government of India's telegram of the 5th January, below, seeks authority to offer Afghanistan 12 all- ^ purpose military aircraft of the type most suitable for that country, and asks our advice on the question of suitability. The views of the Air Ministry have been sought demi-officially; ^See the letter of the 9th January, below), and they have now replied (by letter of the 9th January, and subsequently by telephone) that according to their information there are no two-seater Hurricanes in operation; that Defianfo and MartinetVfcs are not available for adaptation to meet Afghan requirements; and that after considering all the aircraft that might possibly suit Afghan conditions (including the Anson, which had been demi-officially suggested thiam by the Foreign Office) the. only one that fills the bill ^Ls the Hurricane. Of the three types of Hurricane that appear to be available, namely, the IIB, IIG and I ID, A,C*S,E#A, have reported to the Air Ministry that no IIG's are available. The Air Ministry state that they are prepared, however, to offer IIB^s or IID's. Before a formal offer of 12 such Hurricanes can be made, the approval of the Aircraft Assignments Board (which is an offshoot of the London Munitions Assignment Board) is required. Last May, however, the Air Ministry did secure the approval of the Board to an offer of 9 Hurricanes to Afghanistan. This offer did not arouse the interest of the Afghans at the time for the reason explained in Katodon 116 (Ext.3266/MM), but as we can offer them no suitable alternative it looks as though they will have to accept the Hurricanes if they are to take British Aircraft at all. The Air Ministiy state that this offer of 9 Hurricanes is still open, and that as the Government of India wish to offer 12 they need merely seek the approval of the Aircraft Assignments Board to a further three Hurricanes. They expect that this approval will be granted without question. The Government of India have asked for early concurrence in their proposal as the Afghan Mission is due to leave India on the 20th . January. We can authorise them to make a firm offer of 9 Hurricanes with the provisional offer of a further 3 subject to the approval of the Aircraft Assignments Board. As for price, we can accept the Government of India's view that it would be useless, and in fact hardly justifiable to expect anything like £9000 for each aircraft. As the Government of India point out they are obsolescent, and something like half that figure would appear to be/more suitable sum. I see that £J 000 was approximately &gt;/ what the Afghans paid in 1937 x for each of the Hinds which they purchased from Hawkers. These were new aircraft,* complete with spares and equipment, and apart from the merits of the case, the Afgh ans * u '*t *• would almost certainly suspect us of attempting to profiteer at their ^ expense. I understand that £M,500 is the sort of figure that the Air ^ Ministry have in mind as a reasonable sum for each of the Hurricanes, ^ T and we might mention this figure to the Government of India as a guide. , A draft telegram in this sense is submitted. 1/ DRAPr TELEGRAM r znj IMMEDIATE GUARD ( Prom: Secretary of State for India TOP SECRETHQ.T.P. ) Porminka Kabul Copy to: F*Oi V \.u. 1945 To: Government of India, E.A.D.

Cj January, 1945• ('/oe) Jith reference to our telephone conversation about the Ck)^i*nment of India’s telegram of the 5th January (spare copy enclosed) on the subject of the supply of aircraft to Afghanistan, I ought perhaps to mention that there is at present an Afghan lilitary Mission touring India* The objects of the Mission are to study British Military and Air Force-methods and equipment in order to determine what would be most suitable for the fghan Army and Air Force* We are exceedingly anxious to ensure that the Mission is a complete success and Bis Majesty’s Government have recently authorised the Government of India to make the \fghans token offers of certain kinds of munitions and equipment which the Mission will see in use by our forces in India* It is no less important to offer the Afghans suitable aircraft and, as you may be aware,there has been seme considerable correspondence with your Ministry on this subject. After we had considered various types of aircraft the conclusion reached was that it would be better to wait until the Afghan Mission had visited India before going into the question further. The authorities in India have now evidently discussed the problem with the members of the Mission, who have indicated as their essential requirements an all-purpose aircraft with a ceiling of 20,OCX) feet and a range of 500 miles. They want it primarily for trt^al control and would prefer it to be a single- engined two-seater. In the light of this information the Government of India have come to the conclusion that the possible /types Wing-Commander K.S*Berry, (A.* *L. 9)» Air inistry, Seaford House, 37 Belgrave Square, 5*W.l.■ ( 2 ) r types ^high might uieert the Afghan requirements are the Hurri 6 ane IIC» the Defiant or a modified artinet, unless the Air -viinistry can suggest a more suitable alternative* ;•. '-cl . y if*~ i ^ Q m''' ' *- •- It seems that the iSartinet can be ruled out for the reasons given in para. of the Crovemment of Indians telegram. As for the Hurricane, the Afghans objection to it is thkt it single-seater whereas they want a two-seater, but you wil^, that Hawker’s Kabul Representative is staged to have claim*.^ that there are two-seater Hurricanes in service in Russia* ‘Qould you kindly have this statement checked and if it proves to be true ascertain whether twelve such Hurricanes could be made available, with spares? If so, this would appear fully to meet the requirements of the Afghans. fhe question of price can be gone into separately and all that I think I need say here is that we fully agree with the Government of India that it would be useless to ask the Afghans to pay anything like £9,000 a piece and that, in view of the fact that they are obsolete 0 ^ such a price would be unjustified. If the statement that there are two-seater Hurricanes proves to be unfounded, the Government of India sug-est that we should attempt to interest the Afghan Government in single-seater Hurricanes. I should be grateful for your views on this suggestion and in particular on the availability of a dozen bf such Hurricanes, compltte with spares. In the event of both these possibilities proving unavailing, the Government of India suggest, subject to the views of the Air inistry, that twelve operationally equipped Defiants would probably best meet their needs. Failing the other two suggestions, therefore, we should be grateful if you would ^ook into this possibility and let us &lt;now what the chances are of making this number of Defiants, complete with spares, available. If for one reason or smother all three of these proposals prove unacceptable, the Government of India 'suggest that the feasibility of modifying the Martinet so as to carry both bombs and guns (with a free rear gun) should be urgently considered so ! r£. /thatis? V / /&gt; i (3) that we can inform the Afghans of the position* As the Afghan military Mission is due to leave India on the 20th of January and as the Government of India want to be in a position to make a token offer of aircraft before that date, you will appreciate that this is a matter of some -i^*^|’able urgency* I shall be grateful# therelore# It you wc«i*v ^j- j t me have a reply as soon as possible#and if you would like me to come over and discuss the question with you I shall be very pleased to do so if you would give roe ^ ring*It will be recalled that the Government of India recently sought H*M.G*s approval to their making the Afghan Military Mission - which is -at present touring India - a token offer of certain military munitions and equipment.

On 23rd March, he stated (A)/that though he wished to purchase some more modern aircraft, he was not prepared to accept aircraft which were of an obsolete type or unsuitable for use in Afghanistan. He had to consider his pilots and local conditions for flying. He favoured the purchase of new aircraft rather than second hand aircraft, and though for financial reasons he might have to accept used aircraft, he would prefer to have two or three new aircraft to a larger /numbernumber of* second hand aircraft the ser vi ceebility whlc L \ would always remain a doubtful Quantity* He had also rotind it more economical from a maintenance point of view to purchase new aircraft.

They are afraid that these planes are really too old to be of much service and I am very reluctant to do anything to try and ; influence them either way, especially as Hunger the Air Commodore in Peshawar tells me that he is insisting on all his remaining Audax being scrapped as he considers they are so old as to be a positive danger* 3. Lancaster hinted at the possibility that Hurricanes might be obtainable in the not too distant future though pointing out the tremendous complications that such an innovation would involve. There is I am I told one type of plane which would be quite ideal for the Afghan u-overnment in every way and that is the Harvard Trainer. This is very awdhwsrd as it is an American machine with, I presume', an American engine, though I believe that it is at present being manufactured also in Canada under licence* I only hope that the Americans will not reconmend and offer to supply these.

Ext, 254/^ Extract from the Report on the Afghan Air Force for the period 1st August to 15th November, 1, (c) The Air Commandant and officers of the Afghan Air I^orce have made frequent enquiries during the summer, regarding the '^ v possibility of their being supplied with 9 additional secondhand Hind aircraft from Great Britain or India, The request for the supply of these aircraft was made in March, and early in October the Afghan Government was informed that Hind aircraft were now regarded as obsolete, andnone were available for sale. Later, in November, an offer to supply Audax aircraft frcm India at breakup value was made, or alternatively to supply 'Master* aircraft from Great Britain at a reasonable price, for delivery, within 9 to 12 months. The reactions of the Afghan Government, or the Air Commandant, to this offer are not yet known, but it is probable that in view of their desire to conserve their existing Hind aircraft for internal security operational purposes, and to obtain some trainer aircraft for training student pilots in Kabul, they may be prepared to accept Audax or Hart aircraft for use as trainer aircraft, and as a stopgap to tide them over a period. There is little doubt that the Air Commandant and officers of the Afghan Air Force will be disappointed if the Afghan Govt, decide to purchase Audax or Hart aircraft, as these types are older than the Hind aircraft already in their possession. The Air Commandant does however realise the difficulties of obtaining the 'General Purpose' type of aircraft he requires, and is perhaps prepared to accept what is offered and to hope that more modem aircraft of some kind or another will became available at the end of the war. (d) In August the Afghan Government made enquiries as to whether a 'Tiger Loth' trainer aircraft could be made available for sale from India, and if so at what price. This aircraft was Required for training pilots in Kabul. The enquiry was referred to the Government of India, but it is not yet known whether this aircraft can be made available for sale.Extract from Government of India Letter, Departmen t o f Posts &amp; Air No. D.O. No. 27-V dated the S EGRET 25th February External Affairs Department have been consulted with regard o the sale of military aircraft to Afghanistan and other countrie; eighbouring India. It is a matter of policy to which the utmost importance has been attached both in I/mdon and by the Government &lt; that everything possible should be done to supply from British sources any aircraft which the Afghan or Nepalese Governments may of military aircraft and trainers and is anxious for more, and more recent, models, as soon as they can be supplied. They have hitherto required only the smaller types of aircrai t suitable for nnny cooperation and tribal policing. It is not expected that they would require the most advanced types of aircraft or could afford to huy them or be able to maintain them. -^hey have however very satisfactory relations with the Royal Air Force who have for seme years oast supplied, (and still do) a pilot instructor to the Afghan' Air Force. There has so far been no mention by the Afghans of any desire for the larger types of bomber or civil transport aircraft. If our plans to establish a regular air service to Kabu possibly beyond) after the war materialise, it will inevitably require. Afghanistan has hitherto taken a comparatively small number stimulate/• t 9 stimulate a movement in Afghanistan to develop their own . civil flying even if it is only to exercise their rigjit to operate a reciprocal service to India® A small demand for civil aircraft might then arise®Air Ministry regarding poet-war exports of aircmit ir-»m the United Kingdom* We siiall be glad to know in due course whether the rovomnent el’ India have any comaenta on the various aoade sot out in j^aragrapli 2 of this letter, beyond the useful inf or urtion contained in your official letter 27 “ V(5)/43 °f the 10th August, 1943* 2* I suggest tliat you leave to one side for the present the question of idle sup, ly of military types to India, as that can best be handled I through sorvieu channels, but possibly the External Affairs De^mrtment night like to see the papers with reference to Sir Gurunath Bewoor, C*I*h*, I.O.S*, Secretary to the Crovemnent of India, Posts and Air Department, the/ Kew I'telhi.F3H7A. 1921 16th Decenijer, 1943* P3l?a. Dear Cribbett, M.A.P. are at present engaged in post-war discussions with the aircraft industry, both through their representative body the Society of British Aircraft Constructors and with the important firms individually, and one of the points on which they are pressing for guidance is the export possibilities for the industry, tfe are anxious, th /s ^f©re, to advance consideration of this aspect of the future of the ai* raft industry in this country and we should welcome in the first instance, the views of the Board of Trade and the political Departments (Foreign Office,^Dominions Office, etc.j as to bow it can best be handled, i.e. whether in connection with the consideration which is being given to overseas trade questions, including discussion with the Americans, or in some other way. 2. The types of export which we have to consider appear to fall under the following broad categories, each of which may require different treatment:- (1) Military Aircraft (including naval types and trainers); (b) Smaller types for taxi-ing purposes, flying clubs and private use; (3) British participation in aircraft manufacture abroad, varying from the grant of licences to manufacture British types to more direct participation by lending technical assistance or even by the development of subsidiaries to British Companies (e.g. on De Havilland lines). 3. The export of military aircraft, which may well offer big possibilities, raises of course special questions, for the Air Ministry (and on naval types the Admiralty). There will almost certainly be at the end of the war large surpluses of completed aircraft (and also , „ engines, equipment and parts) and the problem will arise as to what extent these can be sold to the Dominions, India and friendly foreign countries to equip their post-war air forces. Political and security (2) Civil Types which may be sub-divided into - (a) Larger types designed for air line operation; W.C.G. Cribbett, Bsq., Air Ministry, Parliament Square House, S.W.l. considerations/of countries to which advanced types may be allowed to go; another list of countries to which only*^. the more obsolescent types can go; and a further list to which the ^ export of military aircraft would be prohibited. Apart from re equipment or initial equipment, some of these countries (notably the Dominions) may look to this country, wholly or in part, to provide the aircraft to maintain their standing air forces which, since it would represent a continued addition to the level of output in this country, would be relatively more valuable than the disposal of surpluses. X' 1 4. The question of the export of civil aircraft appears to link \ % on the marketing side, with the question of the extent and nature os British and American participation in air line operation outside the two countries and it has been suggested to us that we may wish the former matter considered in any discussions with the Americans on the latter. 5. As to (3) above the question has already arisen in particular form in regard to China and has also been raised generally by the Dominions Office in regard to the Dominions. A brief summary of other cases which have arisen in the last twelve months is appended. 6. It would probably be helpful if in the first instance M-A.P. called as soon as possible a meeting with Foreign Office, Dominions Office, Board of Trade Department of Overseas Trade, and Air Ministry, to exchange ideas on how these matters should be handled, and I propose to try to fix this up in the next week or so. Meanwhile I should be grateful for any preliminary cormnents you may wish to make. 7. I am sending this letter to those indicated below and copies for any comments they may wish to make to Treasury (Lee) India Office (Rumbold) and Colonial Office (Bigg) who will no doubt wish at some stage to come into the discussions.

As you will recollect we were rather unwilling- to off ond (the Afghan Government) s -pwade by offering, the obsolete Audax, but at the time of our offer there seemed no alternative. Incidentally, we have not yet heard from His Majesty’s Minister what the Afghan Government’s reactions were.

(See our telegram to India No. 221*69 dated 1st October, and telegrams to Kabul No, 310 dated 8th November and 343 dated 21st December 1943). -e have not heard the Afghan Government's reactions but we may doubtless assume from the Military Attache’s action that they have been unfavourable, ye were not happy at having to offer such obsolete machines as the Audax, but at the time we had no other choice. If Hurricanes are now available in India and the Air Ministry have no objection from the supply point of view, we would be in favour of offering them to the Afghans. The price will no doubt be high - perhaps too high for the Afghan Government's purse - although it is possible that the Government of India would meet them by paying the Air Ministry out of the xifghan Fund and letting the Afghans settle the sum by instalments as they did in the sale of the Hinds in 1937 1939. The Air Ministry would of course have to satisfy themselves that the aircraft are suitable for Afghan requirements from the technical point of view before the offer could be made. The Foreign Office, to whom these minutes will be copied, may have something to say from the point of view of Iraq and Persia.

Extract from Report on the iif^han Air Force for the period 1st May to the 31 st Julyj 1943* i* (a) GENERAL * ‘ The Air Force has shown its usual seasonal activity during the quarter under review, and the Air Commandant F.M. Muhd Ihsan Kh$n since his return from leave in India in March, has continued to show initiative and energy in his efforts to improve the efficiency of the Air Force. The Commandant, who was largely responsi ble for the request made by the Afghan Government in March for the supply of 9 more second-hand Hind aircraft from Great Britain, is beginning to show anxiety as to whether these additional aircraft can be supplied. Other officers in the Afghan Air Force who apparently know that this request was made, have been sounding the British instructors regarding the prospects of their obtaining these additional air craft from Great Britain. The Afghan Chief of the General Staff has also made enquiries from the Military Attache during the past two months as to whether a reply has been received from His l^ajesty’s Government on this subject. It would appear that there is a general desire in the Air Force to increase the number of serviceable/2# no v' 1 u - serviceable aircraft available, to a’t' - 36, anri a vague bope that should, the supply of second-hand Hind aircraft not materialize, another type of aircraft with a similar or in 5 &gt;roved performance will be supplied* • The number of serviceable Hind aircraft capable of being used for’internal security operations at present is only 21, as 5 Hind aircraft are in the workshops for repairs, and^ the few remaining serviceable Italian Romeo aircraft are unfit for use for this purpose because they cannot take off with a full war load from airfields with high altitudes.

Vs. OCT 1943 w jju. to. € ■ =jLPlease see Kabul telegram of 15 th Liay and the minutes on Ext•2585/43 about the request from the Afghan Government for nine more Hind aircraft. It turned out that Hinds were not available (the type is obsolescent) and it was alternatively suggested that Audax machines should be offered. These are even older than Hinds - in fact the latter were developed out of them. Their performance in Afghan conditions is to some extent problematic ( the supply of spares might be^difficult, and they are in what is described as M an advanced stage of obsolescence'. Another suggestion was that lysanders should be offered, but these also are obsolescent and in any case probably only three would be available. In the circumstances the Government of India thought it best (see their telegram of 2?th July on Ext.4506/43) to tell tte Afghans that we have nothing suitable to offer them and not to risk losing our reputation for supplying reliable aircraft. But objections were felt here*to taking so negative an attitude, and eventually the Government of India suggested (paragraph 3 of their telegram of the 14th August on Ext. 4594/43) that failing lysanders the best solution might be to offer trainers of an advanced type, when available from the U.K..and in the meantime to suggest that the Afghans might have a look at an Audax and see whether they would like to have some of these machines at a break-up price as stopgaps• The Air Ministry have now let us know (see Squadron- leader Glanville’s letter of 24 th September now submitted) that they can supply nine tosters (which apparently is an advanced trainer type) in nine to twelve months' time. Further discussion with the Air Ministry has, however, elicited that these tosters have neither the armament nor the bomb gear for which the Afghan Govern ment ask (see Kabul telegram of l^th May). As the Afghans want the aircraft for dealing with tribesmen, and as the Hinds for which they want replacements were equipped with machine guns and bomb gear, it seems very little use offering the tosters as eventual replacements of the Hind. On the other hand it may not be so very long now before the end of the war, and when the war is over presumably H.M.G. will be able to provide aircraft of a suitable type without difficulty. to.Squire may therefore be able to persuade the Afghan Government at any rate to consider the Audax machine, particularly in view of the fact that machines in the Afghan Air Force normally only do a coirparatively small number of flying hcurs a year. It might also be a good plan to offer the Masters as trainers , since a good deal of flying time is of course taken up in training Afghan pilots and if the tosters could be used for this purpose the operational machines would have to be used very little. The next step seems to be for the Government of India and A.H.Q..India, to consider the matter and ist us have their views. A draft telegram to the Government of India, repeated to H.M.Minister, Kabul, is submitted for approval, subject to F.O.concurrence.DRAFT TELBGRAJI iCC Ext. £Zij&lt;o / * * * i'Vy&gt;v^ &lt;^C. #- Itau . &gt;5 / s w&gt; Erom: Secretary of State To: Government of India, External Affairs Dept. &lt;* Repeated to H.

Insufficient number of lysanders (probably not more than three) would be available and Air ISLnistry have been considering solution suggested in paragraph 3(2) of your telegram. They can now offer nine Llasters in about nine to twelve months' time, of which price including packing and transport would normally be £3 &gt;300. Parachutes mentioned in Katodon 114 could be provided unless India can supply. 2. I understand, however, that these trainers have no armament or bomb gear, and that fitting would present very great difficulties. Had you and Air Headquarters considered this before recommending trainer type? 3. In circumstances since early reply is now very desirable H.IJ.G. suggest that subject to your views after consultation v/ith A.H. Q. following instructions should be given to H.M.Minister. He should lay cards on table, explain/explain that Hinds are not available, lysanders not available in sufficient quantities to justify embarking on new type of machine, and that only type at all likely to suit operational requirements of Afghan Government is V f Audax, which is earlier edition of Hind. These machines can be supplied from India at break-up price and a sample can be sent up for inspection. After the war there should be no difficulty in supplying suitable machines and as war is now going so well Afghan Government may be satisfied with Audax as stopgap. In addition H.IvLG. could in nine ^ ^ — to twelve months supply Hastens, which are excellent trainers (presumably AH.Q. can give H.II.Minister allEXT. 4915A5 Extract from report oc the Afghan Air Force for the period 1st February to 30th April,1943 « !• (b) S*L Wigginton, R*A*F., has now been placed in charge of all flying training including that of the Italian Romeo Squadron.. There have been signs that the Comoandant wishes to scrap the Italian Romeo aircraft, and to rely on Great Britain for the supply of aircraft and spares, at any rate until the end of the present world war. « Early in March the Commandant gave out that he wished to purchase 9 more secondhand Hind aircraft from Great Britain*s surplus stocks, and on 18th March the Chief of the General Staff and the Commandant of the Air Force asked the Military Attache to make enquiries as to whether these aircraft could be made available for sale ai, a reasonable price. The Afghan Governments official request regarding the purchase of the aircraft did not, however, reach this Legation /fromfrom the Afghan Ministry for Foreign'Affairs until 21st April 1943•• It appears that the Commandant of the Air Force wishes to maintain three Squadrons of Hind aircraft, and a training flight, which would consist of any Hind aircraft available and a few of the Italian Breda and Romeo aircraft which are still serviceable* After the war the Commandant proposes to re equip his airforce with new aircraft.Please see Kabul telegram of 15 th toy and the minutes on Ext•2585/43 about the request from the Afghan Government for nine more Hind aircraft* It turned out that Hinds were not available (the type is QhSOlftflCftTl+A woo o1+o-cn©+«-'-“ 1 '' tha I e* 4 -/-v #3 from th&lt; 1943.. to main flight, a few o; service; equip h howe arm£ menl Afgl and' The next s tep' 355!!lfc to be i'or the government oi India and A.H.^.,India, to consider the matter and ]e t us have their views* A draft telegram to the Government of India, repeated to H.lUMinisrer, Kabul, is submitted for approval, subject to F#0*concurrence*t'i-J Tel.

We withdraw therefore comment in paragraph No.6 of our telegram No.6148 dated July 27th. 3* j;frnr Tnrb difficulties of supply remain and perhaps most promising alternatives to consider might be. (1) Supply Lysanders in good condition with spares to follow as shipping permits. (2) Promise of supply from United Kingdom of advanced trainer types of adequate performance for Kabul altitude at as early as possible a date within next year or 18 months with offer at break-up prices of Audax machines from India in interim. Extremely brief annual flying time performed by Afghan aircraft makes interim offer of Audax machines less objectionable than was originally thought and if there is reasonable prospect of their replacement within time suggested problem of spare parts becomes less acute. 4. We should be ready to send one Audax to Kabul for trial if Afghan Government so desired. 1 $ vJij j r 5(ztgX &amp;±.h5Sk/W5.

We have discussed question of supply of Harts or Audax with Air Headquarters in the light of their telegram 09u0 of July 1st. We gathered that on assumption that aircraft would be handed over after complete overhaul they might be capable of flying 1000 hours after which they would he due for another complete overhaul and further serviceability coild not be guaranteed. We understand Royal Air force in peace time estimate aircraft of this type will do 35o hours flying time in a year. It follows that these aircraft would have less than 3 year life. 3. Moreover engine spares and tools are in short supply and gun synchronisation gear would have to be brought from United Kingdom if Audax were accepted for transfer. 4. Generally it is clear that these aircraft are in advanced state of obsolescence and we think it would damage British name to sell even at low price aircraft of which flying time is limited,, performance at Kabul altitude problematic and spares are not available in India. 5. With reference to Katodon telegram 234 dated July 24th Air Headquarters inform us that neither Lysander aircraft f? nor) spares are available in India to supply to Afghanistan. We understand this type in any case nearly as obsolescent as Harts- Audax and should therefore be ruled out on same grounds. Only alternative would be supply Trainer type aircraft but even this raises question of shipping space allotment. 6. On general survey, we think Afghan Government should be informed that His Majesty’s Government do not wish to sell obsolescent aircraft and cannot afford anything else during the war.Ext. 3231/194-3.

J Dear Rumbold, I have seen a copy of Glanville^ letter to you No. 3 35888/V of the 2nd July about the proposal to let the Afghan Government have some modern aircraft. I think we must take it as definite that the Persians at any rate have a prior claim to the Afghans in this matter. We have taken from the Persians the only modern aircraft they possessed, and no arrangements have yet been agreed for letting them have any others in replacement. We have also turned the Persians out of most of their aerodromes. We are very much concerned to see that the Persian Air Force, which is the only branch of the Persian fighting services that is at all well- disposed to us, gets at least as good treatment as the air force of any neighbouring country. If the present proposal to train selected Persian pilots in this country is approved, I think we could probably agree to waive this objection. But if this scheme does not go through, we feel that the Persians are definitely entitled to have first pick of any modern aircraft that may be available. Subject to this we should be only too glad if it were possible to meet Afghan needs. I am sending a copy of this letter to Glanville. S (W.H. Young). H.A.F. Rumbold, Esq., India Office.I Ijt.

Draft D.O* Letter to Air Ministry* I ~tt r i m ■ ^ H^S27 MAY 194J■ppi m pi ^ 1 &amp;SXF' M '' ~ r MINUTE 'Hm telegram from Sir F. \7ylie is attaclied forwarding a request from the Afghan Govermnent for tlie purchase of a further 9 Hind aircraft ; together with certain equipment. Sir F. Wylie strongly supports the request and recommends that if aircraft can be made available they should be sold at very^reasonable priced. 2. The Afghan Air Force now consists mostly of Hind aircraft v/hich we sold, to the Afghan Government. The first eight which iiere new machines direct from Hawker Aircraft Ltd., were sold in 1937 and a further twenty secondhand Hinds were bought from the R.A.F. and re-sold to the Afghan Government in 1939# The last report on them gives the figures as eighteen Hinds serviceable and eight unserviceable but repairable. Of these last eight, six were capable of short local flights. The Italian aircraft which make up the remainder of the Force consist of Romeos and Bredas and have a total of six serviceable and twelve unserviceable but repairable. The Afghans have not been particularly inpressed with these aircraft and they propose gradually to scrap them and replace them with Hinds. 3. This request provides us with an excellent opportunity for developing and strengthening our influence in the Afghan .Air Force. The possibility of getting a really strong footing in this sphere has been apparent since the Italian personnel left with the Axis nationals in 194-1 s and it was with this in mind that we wrote to Sir F. YJylie in April this year (see our letter on Ext. 1204/4-3 dated 20th April, flagged). At the time, however, although we had visualised the possibility of selling or presenting some aircraft to the Afghan Government immediately after the war, it seemed that” it would not be possible to do anything at present. The Afghan request, however, has brought matters to a head and provides us with an opportunity to explore the possibility of Hinds or alternatively a less out of date and equally suitable type of aircraft being available preferably from the Middle East or India in view of transport difficulties. 4. The chief objection to supplying more Hind aircraft is that this type has recently been declared obsolete by the R.A.F. This means that no more machines, or what is more important, no more spares will be manufactured. We are already busy trying to bty up enough spares from the R.A.F. to service the Hinds which the Afghans already liave, for the remainder of their estimated existence. Clearly this need must take priority over the supply of additional Hinds even though some should be available. It seems probable that there would not be enough spares to go round to service a further nine aircraft and it would be most undesirable to sell the Afghans aircraft which we could not help to maintain. 5* It is very possible, however, that the Air Ministry can suggest another early type of aircraft which would be equally suitable for service in Afghanistan and a draft exploratory letter to Wing Commander G-lanville of the Air Ministry, with whom the matter has been discussed by phone, is attached. It is proposed to send it in advance of the receipt of the vievTS of the Government of India, in the first place to find out what the chances are. prices, etc. can be settled, later.

I now enclose a^telegram from Sir Francis Wylie stating that the Afghan Government wish to purchase another nine Hinds from us, together with certain equipment. The reasons why the Afghans want Hinds instead of less obsolete * aircraft are probably that the small iVfghan Air * i Foxxje is maintained primarily for internal security/purposes . . n , security/foi' which they are adequate, their pilots are accustomed to them, they realise that wfe coidd not release any machines of an up-to-date typo, and Hinds would he a cheaper proposition than anything more modem, which naturally is a great consideration with a small and poor coimtcy such as Afghanistan. s.'oitw une.1 VNWV (XU , J'Wce. Wfpe^ ^ 3. T'He should very much like to he able to give Afghans as helpful a reply as possible to their present request. Tfe have a clear field to develop our influence with their Air Force since the Italian instructors and personnel left Afghanistan with the Axis nationals in 1941 , and the .fghan Government are unimpressed by the performance of their Italian aircraft vrhich they nov/ propose gradually to scrap and replace with Hinds. The political aspects of the matter are developed in Peel’s letter to Sir Francis Wylie Ho.Ext. 1204/43 Of 20 th April 1943 of which a copy ’.vent to the Air Ministry on the same day. , We realise that it may not he a j^epJ&amp;^Yor the Afghan Goverm^nt to buy Hinds, even if they are available in suitable condition, on account of the difficult ol % N&amp; finding enough spares with v/liich to keep them ; as well as their existing 26 Hinds ^serviced for five years under Afghan conditions, and it would he definitely undesirable to supply aircraft which are not in good condition or for which A ' * m ' we could not supply spro^fe ^ 'that scale. If in distributing your stock of Hind spares you have not enough to mod; all demands, require ments for the maintenance of the Afghans' existing Hinds should have priority over the provision to them of additional Finds. 5. lie should be glad to have your views, and we should welcome any alternative suggestion you may be able to offer in the event of the supply of Hind aircraft being difficult. At this stage we should require only an approximate estimate of the relative prices of any aircraft which could suitably be sold to the Afghan Government. 6# A very inportant consideration is that it would be extremely difficult to ship aircraft for the Afghans from the United Kingdom. For this reason we hope that you can select old Itype aircraft viiich are either already in India or the Kiddle East or v?hich could be flov/n to India. y # I am sending a copy of this letter to pink at the Foreign Office.

The selection process being the result of a long search from 1943 to 1946 for a suitable replacement. The file contains correspondence documenting the search for suitable British aircraft – both new and second hand; the search for suitable aircraft was complicated by wartime conditions and the Afghan Government's unusual requirements. Some of the other aircraft considered were as follows:the Boulton Paul Defiantthe de Havilland Dominie, Dove, and Tiger Moththe Fairey Swordfishthe Hawker Audax, Hart, and Hurricanethe Miles Masterthe Westland LysanderThe correspondence in the file also partly documents the process of ordering the Avro Ansons including: arrangements for payment for the aircraft, arrangements for shipping the aircraft, details respecting the required specification, and the production schedule for the aircraft. The file also includes minutes from inter-departmental meetings held to discuss post-war supply difficulties with the Avro Anson aircraft.The main correspondents are officials from various government departments as follows: the Air Ministry, the Foreign Office, the India Office (the Commonwealth Relations Office from August 1947), and the Ministry of Supply. Other key correspondents include HM Minister at Kabul (Francis Verner Wylie and Giles Frederick Squire) and officials from the External Affairs Department of the Government of India.A few cuttings from magazines can be found within the file:A page from
                              Flight, 19 July 1945, which inclludes an advertisement for the De Havilland Rapide (folio 261r) and Field Aviation Services (folio 261v).The Aeroplane, 24 March 1944, which includes a photograph of a two-seater Hawker Hurricane in Russia (folio 291v).The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
