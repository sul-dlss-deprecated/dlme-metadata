S huckrurgii , India Office. Mr. NicoLs y Anglo-Persian Oil Company. I. 2. Colonel Wilson dealt with the question of the retail sale of oil to the civil population in Mesopotamia. He explained the existing arrangements under which the local interests of the Anglo-Persian Company and the distribution of their oil are entrusted to managing agents (Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Co.), who are also merchants and carry on a variety of activities, by no means confined to the marketing of oil in India, Mesopotamia, and the I. ersian Onil. Ho regarded this arrangement as faulty in principle; and he further criticised the methods followed by Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Co. as tending to make the price of oil to the consumer unduly high, in the interests of the civil population, he could not allow the cost of an essential commodity to remain unrestricted ; and he proposed, unless an arrangement for the control of prices could be reached, to vest the retail distribution in the civil administration. As an alternative he suggested (1) that Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Co. should be eliminated, and that representatives of the Anglo-Persian OiJ Company, dealing exclusively with oil, and acting in direct subordination to the Drrectors in London^ should be appointed in their place; and (2) that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should agree to sell oil to the population at a limited price to be fixed by the Civil Administration, plus a minimum percentage. 3. Mr. Nicols replied on behalf of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to Colonel Wilson's criticisms. He did not think that the immediate elimination of Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Co. would be practicable ; but he assured the Conference that it had never been the policy of his Company to ' exploit ' Mesopotamia, and that they were quite willing to accept civil control over the price of oil. Eventually, after considerable discussion, Colonel Wilson submitted the following proposal as the basis of an agreement between the Civil Administration of Mesopotamia and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company : —- (i) That the Company's agent at Baghdad shall be authorised to deal direct with the Civil Commissioner in all matters relating to the sale and distribution of oil in Mesopotamia, and to make all arrangements on the Company's behalf. ^ (ii) That the price at which oil is sold wholesale by the Company to Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Co. shall not be in excess of the average rate at which it re feold wholesale by the Company to Government. (iii) That the commission payable to Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Co., shall be fixed by arrangement with the Civil Commissioner. The Civil Commissioner would then be in a position to fix the retail price of oil. 4. The Conference recommended that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should be formally invited to accept an arrangement on the above lines. r Ihe India Office representatives undertook to take the necessary action. The representative of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Mr. Nicols) then left the meeting. s 35 20 5/19'v t |„. oilfields at Naft Khana, situated on - rInTiol Wilson raised the question ol l ' . j • The diplomatic situation a ^ in the neighhoui'liooil fronli er was dehm.ted 'erso rfTX i-to the war, but its ^^.n^ion, the Turks agreed (Annex B to ments concerned.

It is essential that a new Company should be formed, as provided in the protocol. It is also, in my judgment, essential that the Treasury should have participation and control to at least the same extent as in the case of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. ' The rights of the Iraq State as the successors of the Turkish Government are already safeguarded by the protocol.' _ , • , . , 8. The Conference accepted Colonel Wilson 3 view that the rights ot the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Naft Khana should be maintained ; and they concuned generally in his recommendations for the working of the field. Ill, 9. In conclusion. Colonel Wilson referred to the negotiations at present in progress at Paris for the disposal of future oil interests in Mesopotamia. He explained that oil is the only immediately available asset of the occupied territories, and the only real security that the Iraq administration are in a x&gt;osition to olTer for the loan which they will undoubtedly require in the near future from the British Treasury. He felt grave misgivings about an arrangement, the elfect of which would be to hand over to a comparatively small number of shareholders the whole interests of the Iraq State and of the British Treasury in what might well prove to be the richest oilfields in the world, in exchange for nominal control over oilfields not in British territory which might or might not be effective in practice. He pointed out that such a policy would be the exact reverse of that adopted by His Majesty's Government in regard to the Persian oilfields. It would be opposed to the present trend of opinion in favour of nationalising certain essential industries such as electric power, transportation services and coal, and would be very difficult to defend in Parliament or elsewhere. It would, moreover, be likely to arouse American opposition. Colonel Wilson estimated the capitalised value of the Mesopotamian oilfields at about 50,000,0001.
