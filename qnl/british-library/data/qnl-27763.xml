Political Agency, Bahrain, the 10th August 1938. To The Acting Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Memorandum. Bahrain I wish to approach you on a subject in which, I think, all offices and departments in Manamah are, to a greater or less degree, interested. I refer to the problem of accommodation for our clerical staff. 2. As you know, it is at present not at all easy for a clerk, whether he be in the employ of the Agency or of the Bahrain Government, to obtain suitable accommodation for himself and his family (if he is married) at a rental which his rate of salary enables him to pay. The office clerk is, of course, a comparatively new comer to Bahrain - at least, in such numbers as at present - and neither the house of the well-to-do merchant nor the hut of the pearl diver is suitable for him. I think, therefore, that as capital is now available for useful enterprises, it is a fit opportunity for me to ask you to consider whether the Bahrain Government can do something to help these (very essential) members of our community. 3. To enable me to give you something concrete as a basis, I took the opportunity of having an informal talk with Mr. Mohammad Jaffarj as a result of which I am convinced that the construction of inexpensive houses for the clerical staffs can be a profitable investment, as well as a progressive measure. I understood from him that small houses, suitable for occupation by a married family or two bachelors could probably be constructed in pairs at a cost of Rs. 10,000/- for each pair and that for/that for this figure it should be possible to provide water and sanitation* A monthly rental of 30/- would therefore give a return of Mtfeer more than 7% and there would be no difficulty in ensuring that the houses would be continuously occupied 9 as clerks would normally take over accommodation from their predecessors* 4* It would seem to be advantageous and would certainly be preferred by the clerks 9 if the houses could be constructed in a fairly compact areai rather than scattered about the town* It would make for ease and economy of construction* and there ls y fortunately, no lack of suitable sites for such a 'mohalla” • 5* Should* however* the Bahrain Government be averse to initiating the scheme themselves* they might consider encouraging a contractor to undertake it* possibly by granting a favourable lease of the ground required* 6* I shall be interested* therefore* to hear your views on this proposal* Officiating Political Agent,GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. ©&gt; $ No. 0 f 1357 Office of the adviser to the Governmeirt, Bahrain Dated,17th J/ihani, 1357 August 14, 1$38. H. B* M f s Political ^ent, Bahrain. Memorandum. In reference to your Bo:1218-18/8 of the 10th inst., which relatesto the suggestion of the construction of residentiil quarters suitable for married clerks, by the Government of Bahrain. 2. «^ince such a scheme would involve consider able capital expenditure which has not been envisaged by the adviser in his current Budget, it think it well to submit your Memorandum to him direct, for his opinion before offering a definite repig to same. to the Government. - JL H&gt;/&lt;tGOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. No. 19-11 J-A of 135? Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 13th Rajah. 1357 Sept. 8, 19o8. t3?f&gt; f 0 SEP. H. B. M T s Political iigent, Bahrain. Memorandum. May I invite a reference to your No:1218-18/8 of the 10th August 1938; which relates to accomodation in Bahrain for subordinates of clerical standing. 2. It is agreed that the local conditions are as you state; and for some time the Adviser has had in mind the initiation of a building scheme on the lines of an Indian Cantonment. In fact careful consideration was given to this idea at the time when the Budget for the current year was in preparation. 3. It was found, however, that the Governments build ing programme for the public service, such as the Dispen sary, Hospitals, Schools, and Customs pier,would keep the P.W.D. fully occupied for the whole Jrear, even with its increased staff; and, although the proposal has the Adviser sympathetic consideration, he is unable to undertake any new scheme until these works are finished. 4. It is thought, however, that if this prpposal were suggested by Yourself to certain local landowners, such as Shaikh Mustafa bin Abdul Latif, or Hussain Yateem, these persons would be sufficiently enterprising to erest pre mises suitable for occupancy by Bahrain foreign non- European/. .I have examined Farouk Rouse and submit two rough sketches from memory of the upper floor and ground floor respectively. Many of the rooms on the ground floor v/ere occupied by the caretaker, his friends, and their families, and were not inspected. This applies also to some of the store rooms. The orientation is approximate. There are five rooms on the upper floor. The room at the end of the centre passage measures roughly 26 x 17 x 15 feet, and the others 20 x 20 'x 15 feet. There are several doors to each room though only a few are shown in the sketch, and they are well lighted. (One of the passages has been roughly boarded up and fitted with a door to make a 6 th room.) All the rooms are in need of whitewashing and minor repairs to the flooring. Entering from the porch I could not inspect the rooms to the right of the main passage but was told that they are in fair condition. The others v/ere in a dilapidated state and require extensive repairs. The largest room measured 63 x20 £ 15 feet. It has a low cement block at one end rurining across most of the width of the room which, I understand used to serve as a rations counter. This room is in slightly better condition than the rooms behind it. The rooms on the upper floor would make good bachelor accommodation, though more latrines and bath rooms would have to be built. The kitchen accommodation could be used for this purpose and’kitchens provided fop the bachelors in the back courtyard. This is a large courtyard measuring 140 x 116 feet. Accommodation for two or possibly three families could be provided in the ground floor. I did not notice any latrines on this floor, but there is a large open kitchen attached to one side of the building and the only water tank in the building is on this floor. It will be seen that there is enough accommodation for all the clerks of this Agency in Farouk Rouse. The front courtyard is even larger than the back yard and could accommo date tennis and badminton courts. if all the bachelor accom modation were not required a room could be provided on the upper floor for the Agency Club. My memory may be at fault in some particulars and if it is intended to proceed further vflth the scheme the P.W.D. may be asked to survey the building and submit an esti mate* ■ y t I t / — - A.P.A . !r T“' 12.3.'47. 1 \ll±[ Excluding the Indian Assistant and.the Munshis, there are eleven clerks in the office, two Special Grade and nine ~ Upper Division. The total allowance, including dearness alloce,- drawn by them by v/ay of house rent comes to Rs. 530/- p.m. So, for any housing plan, the total amount available is only this sum, 6 n the assumption that all the staff pay the entire house rent allowance drawn by',tliem. It will be of advantage if accommodation for the staff is arranged by office, as is now done in the Residency at Jufair I doubt, however, if the Rarouk House^will accommodate all the staff. There are at present three families and eight bachelors, and extensive alterations will be required to accommodate all of them in this house. For one thing no one likes to stay in the ground floor in the summer in Bahrain for various reasons; and secondly it is absolutely essential&lt;■&lt;- for families, at least, that each block should be self- contained, complete with kitchen, bathroom etc. It will be a better plan, if we can induce some one, ^ to build a number of houses oh a simple, suitable ddsign. The Indian Assistant and the Munshis can also come under this scheme, and in this case the total house rent available will be^Rs.790/- and the total number for whom houses should be provided,15. i^JJr&amp;JAx (J*- J 'A. 4-^ , . . ejects.‘J’ i J ' ttUr ^ ^ ^ &lt;h T J JU ^ V'-®* 7 ^ , S’ XAAJl&gt; ^( r o&amp;i^ryf 'U&gt;1- iAml i * ■ttsJr ■ c/' ^ r ^ j ) n p' * D.O.

So far as the question'of the Political Ageut and his staff are concerned I an sure that the i^litical Agent himself would sooner live near his office in Manama where he will retain his independent position there rather than in the Residency compound where he would tend to be regarded as a member of the Residency staff and 1 feel equally sure that his staff would prefer inferior accommodation in l anama where are near the bazaar and other amenities rather than m^re comiortable cuarters several miles av/ay. I am inclined to recommend therefore that no provision should be made for the Political Agent and his staff when planning for the Residency but I would urge that plenty of room oe left in the Residency site for ,additi al buildings in case they may be required at any time .whether for the Political Agent or for additions to the Residency staff.

Memorandum I h*tve been unable to secure any suitable accommo dation for Mr. Girdhari Lall who arrived here with his family on the 22nd February. He has been temporarily staying in the Taj Mahal hotel. The accommodation there is not only undesirable for a man with a family because of the'come.and go* of visitors, but the charges made are beyond his means. I have given careful consideration to this question and natives:- can only suggest the following alter- (a) The rest-house rented by the Residency be made available to Mr. ttirdhari Lall and he will be assumed to be occupying Government quarters and will forego his house-rent. (b) The Agency be authorised to rent suitable accommo dation which is not available for less than Fs. 130/- per mensem or thereabout and Mr. Girdhari Lall be allowed to atccupy it and forego the house-rent. (c) He be transferred to Juffair, if accommodation is available there, and a bachelor sent in his place. It is comparatively easy to find accommodation for a bachelor ; in a mess. 2. At present Mr. Nawazih Ali is occupying the Residency rest-house and the accommodation available there is not imaugh sufficient for two families, such as these. I have asked both parties but neither are agreeable to sharing the rest-house. * 3. An early reply is requested. for Political Agent, Bahrain. aft.-URGENT No. 806-18/13 Political Agency, Bahrain.

Neither of them has a family and the flat is of ample size for two single men. Will you arrange with Belgrave to let it to them? He will refer to the Shaikh as the flat is the Shaikh's property, and the Shaikh may jib a bit at letting it at the former rent, and I think he may want an increase.

He wishes the RentAssesment Committee to inspect the premises in order to decide what rent should be charged. Regarding alterations, His Highness suggested that if any alterations or additions are made they should be carried out by the tenant. His Highness does not v/ish to undertake any responsibility for repairs or upkeep other than major structural repairs should they become necessary. The reason for this is that the tenants of some of his houses make incessant requests for minor alterations ect., to the building and His Highness is now stipulating in every lease that the landlord will not undertake any minor work on the buildings.

Dear Bel grave, V ^ Further to our conversation of yesterday, Maurice has inspected the P.R.O. flat with a view to it being used as additional office accommodation, but he says that he finds it rather dilapidated and we doubt if the Ministry of Works could be persuaded to do much about it. I wonder therefore if you could let me know whether one of the two new offices near the sea-front to which you referred could be definitely reserved for the Post Office, and if so a rough date on which they would be ready. I understand from Maurice that if he could receive some assurance to the effect that the new office accommodation wouM be available within say five months, he would be willing to move into the P.R.O. flat temporarily and institute the Air Parcel service forthwith in spite of the inconveniences which it would entail. Yours sincerely C.D. Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Govt, of Bahrain, Bahrain. v.D. 0. No.,/ /Vi - ^ Adviserate, July 19, 1950. With reference to your No.2173 dated 3rd July 1950, His Highness says that he would be willing to let one of the four shops which he proposes to build on his land opposite the house now occupied by Holloways^to the post Master. He has not yet issued a tender for these shops so I cannot say when they will be ready but the time of completion would be, I think, not less than 6 months from the time when building was begun. Some* of the fittings, metal shutters, are being imported from United Kingdom. R.M 1 c Andrew, Esquire, H. B.

Dear Maurice, Will you please refer/to Agency complimentary slip No.2398-18/13 of 24th July about additional accommodation? 2. As a result of your enquiry, I am to inform you that, in view of the delecacy of the question of the status of the Post Office in Bahrain ana the effect that any addition to trie existing building would have on the town planning in the centre of Manamsh, the Political Resident considers that it would be inadvisable to raise once again the originax plan for additional accommodation with the Adviser and regrets thf*t he is unable to help you in this matter.
