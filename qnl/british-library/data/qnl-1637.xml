To the /ketches in the former editions dre added two others, the one, the cient monument found in Natolia ; the of the Red Sea. Much pains have cipher the infer iption fill remaining but in vain; however it is generally a mixture of Greek andPhcenician characlers. the neceffary fize of the Chart of the can be expeBed, than a general kn lative fituation of the places referred ; and thofe are laid deuon with all pofji- ble, in a chart on fo fmall a fcale. &gt;€*w v v T.. # 'r # KM.KA x # cjp # ^ 59s ^ %Lji[ ii ] I have therefore printed off a few copies with feme typographical and other ne- ceffary corredions; and having before touched but flightly on tEe neceffity of opening a communication with India by the Red Sea, I ihall in this preface enter more minutely into the coniidera- tion of that important fubjecft. * Our extenfive and valuable poffeilions in the Eaffc Indies have long excited the envy of all the other European nations; nor is it in the leaft improbable that , the maritime powers of France, Spain, and Holland, were prompted to take an active part againft us in the late unhappy war, not only with a view to deprive us of our Colonics in the Weft, but alfo if poflible, to tear from us and divide between them, our pofiTeffions in the Eaft : and that even the Emperor, and Ruflia, Denmark, and Sweden, re mained[ 'i I mained neuter, in hopes fome time or other of at lead fliaring with us the profits of that beneficial trade. The Emperor principally for this purpofe has already opened the Port of Triefte, and is endeavouring to revive the long loft trade of the different cities of the Netherlands. Ruflia has obtained free egrefs into the Black Sea, in order to divert into its old channel, that branch of it that was carried on by the Gulph of Perfia. Denmark may look forward towards extending their prefent poffef- fions in that part of the world; and Sweden probably hopes to come in for a fharc of the fpoils, and to obtain fome eftablifliment in India by the means of their old allies the French. Had not fome ideas of this nature prevailed, s we fhould not during the late war have fought againfl fuch an hoft of enemies, B 2 nor[ iv ] nor when threatened with deftrudion have been deferted by our beft friends. I . • , - _ s . t ^ ' i ' The fame caufes very likely gave rife to, and may continue to keep alive the unnatural connexion between the court of Verfaillcs, and the republican party in Holland. The French, when they are rich enough to begin another conteft with us, are moil: undoubtedly determined to make their attack in the Eaft ; and as they have no port nearer to the Peninfula of India, than the ifland of Mauritius, they have formed a clofe conneclioil with the Dutch, that they may at once derive aid from the co-ope ration of their joint forces, and enjoy the benefit of Trincomaley, one of the faieft harbours in the world; and by far the bell fituated of any in India, either for covering their own fettlements in the Bay of Bengalj ox for annoying ours. Nor' j i [ v ] ^ Nor is it furprizing that the Dutch ihould readily join in this plan, for in cafe of a rupture with them, we might otherwife, by means of a fuperior fleet, 1 in a very few weeks drive them off the peninfula of India ; and alfo obtain pof- iblican feffion of the ifland of Ceylon, by far the wka moft precious jewel belonging to the Qotb republic in the Eaft. bteolj a die During the late war we frequently learer in India had no intelligence from Eng- iHand land for eight or nine months j nor did i clofe we hear of the rupture with Spain until • thej upwards of eleven months after the com- j.ope- mencement of hoftilities in Europe. e!1 j 0 | The Spaniards fortunately for us, being 0 f tie flow in their deliberations, and by no jjjfa means quick in their operations, took no advantage of our want of informa- Qts tion : but {hould a war break out with oi]rs prance and Holland, which for th^ ipf I ' reafons[ vi ] reafons I have already mentioned appears to me by no means improbable, we may find all our fettlements invefted before we know they are in danger of being attacked, and hear of their being totally loft, before we are able to relieve them. The means by which we may prevent our enemies anticipating us in fending advices to India, are in fome meafure already pointed out in the introdudion to this work; but fince the publication of the former edition, an occurrence has happened that will greatly facilitate the plan'therein propofed of applying for a revocation of the Turkifh edid:, and which likewife ought to induce them to let our couriers pafs unmolefted through Egypt. The occurrence to which I allude is, the treaty of peace lately concluded between the Ruffians and the Turks; by whichC vii ] 0 which the former have obtained leave in future to pafs the Dardanelles, and to enjoy the free navigation of the Black Sea. After having thus opened the principal door of their empire to their avowed and formidable rivals, they can not with any propriety or fhew of reafon, refufe us leave at leaft to fend pacquet boats up the Red Sea to Suez; in one cafe they give up a folid advantage, in the other, nothing is afked of them that can even indirectly affedt either their honour or intereft. And indeed it may be well worth their confideration, whe ther it will not be better for them to throw open all their ports to the other Europeans in general, than by parti ally fharing the profits of their trade with the Ruffians, flrengthen and enrich that particular nation, of whofe encreafe of wealth and power they have moft rea fon to be iealous. Thet v ' ii ] The Egyptian government being in a great meafure independent of the Porte, it may alfo be neceffary to conlider whether the Beys would approve of our couriers pafling through their country* The Beys have always encouraged the trade from India to Suez, as much as fuch a fluctuating and turbulent body of men can be fuppofed to encourage any meafure of public utility. The reafon of which is obvious; if they by any means could bring the India trade di rectly to Suez, they would receive all the import and export duties now paid at Gedda, to the amount of near two hundred thoufand pounds per annum J and therefore of courfe they will en courage a meafure from which they would derive fuch confiderable profits. The only oppoiition we fhould meet with, would come from the Sherreef of Mecca; and even he, as I have before obferved 3[ ix ] obferved, will no longer be troublefome when he finds that we refrain from trading, and ftridly confine ourfelves to fending pacquet boats with letters. Almost every year fome event occurs to fhew the neceffity of our being able to fend pacquets by the Red Sea; of which I fhall mention a very ftriking inftance that happened at the conclufion of the laft war. When the peace was figned, the news of it was tranfmitted to India, both acrofs the great defert, and alfo round the Cape of Good Hope ; neverthelefs it did not reach Madras until the end of the month of June. On the 13th and 25th of that month there were two engagements by land, and about the fame time one by fea, in which there fell eighty officers, and upwards of two thoufand men. Now had this paflage to Suez been open at C thatr L x J tllat time, the difpatches miglit havs been fent from England to the fcene of nation in fcventy days, and of courfe liave' prevented this unneceffary faerifice of fo many gallant men. But this mis fortune, great as it was, might have been ftill worfe; for after our fleet bor^ away for Madras, Monf. de Suffrein propofcd to land all his marines and a body of fcamen to join the French troops at Cuddalore, and make a defperate at tack on our camp. If therefore, the dif patches had by any unforefeen accident been detained only a few days longer, and this plan had been earned into exe cution, the effufion of blood at leaft would have been ftill more confiderable : nor is it improbable that with fuch a fu peri or force they might have cut off cur whole army, then lying before Cud dalore, in confequence of which Madras and indeed all our fettlements on the coaftC xi 1 coaft of Choromandel muft inevitably have fallen into the hands of Tippo Sahib, who would have paid little or no regard to our peace with the French. The fall of Bombay, and Bengal, with their dependencies, rauft foon have fol lowed that of Madras; and the lofs of all our poffeffions in the eaft would no doubt hav^ fhaken the foundations of public credit at home. When it is con- fidered then, that the lives of thoufands, the fafety of our fettlements, and almoft the exiftence of public credit, depend on our being able to convey intelligence expeditioufly to India; it will naturally be fuppofed, that nothing lefs than the fear of incurring an intolerable expence, can be thought an admiflible objedion againft forming a regular plan for that pur- pofe and inftantly carrying it into execu tion : but in fa6l there is no room for fuch an objedion; for the payment of a mode raterate poftage would more than defray the whole of the expence; which at all events in an affair of fuch magnitude, ought only to be deemed a fecondary confideration.t &amp; Jt i ® ® i% % &lt;#&gt; t&lt; &gt;§#&lt; &gt;2? &lt;#&gt; f INTRODUCTION. The following letter was written in India at the requeft of Sir Eyre Coote, who once had thoughts of returning to Europe by the way of Suez. It was not at that time intended for publication, however fince my return to Eng land many of my friends having defired a copy of it, to avoid the trouble of tranfcribing it myfelf, or the expence of having it tranicribed by others, I have at laft reludtandy confented to its going to the prefs. D This[ 1 This the fir ft difficulty furmounted, I fliull now endeavour to make this publication as ac ceptable as I can, by adding to it an account of the proper time, and moft agreeable manner, of going from Europe to India by Suez; but firfl, as the Turks have at prefent forbidden any Europeans to pafs that way, it will be proper to explain the caufe. of this prohibition; and to fhew that their objedlions againft travellers going through Egypt may be eafily removed. T his route to India was once the moft fre quented of any, but after the difcovery of the i. •' paffage round the Cape of Good Hope, it was negleiled by moft European nations, and almoft entirely abandoned to the Mahomedans^ who carry on the trade of the Red Sea in the fol lowing manner. I n the months of November, December, and January, the Mahomedan Pilgrims who are going to Mecca from the coafts of Barbary, Turkey, Tartary, and Egypt, affemble near Suez ; fome of them form a caravan and proceed from thence by land, but thofe who have mer chandize, freight large /hips from fix to twelve hundred[ XV ] hundred tons to carry them and their goods to Gedda, a fea-port within fixty miles of Mecca, and about two degrees fouth of the Tropic. As different winds prevail on the different fides of the Tropic in the Red Sea, fhips may come to Gedda from oppofite points at the fame feafon of the year ; thofe which corpe from Suez at the above-mentioned time, benefit by the N.;\V. wind, while thofe that come from India and Arabia Felix are affifted by the regular S. W. Monfoon. The pilgrims from the Weft and North having fulfilled the duties of their reli gion, and fettled their worldly concerns; con trive if they can to embark at Gedda, time enough to avail themfelves of the Khumfeen O wind, which blows foutherly from the end of March to the middle of May, and conveys them in lefs than a month back again to Suez : the veffels from India muft alfo quit Gedda fo as to be out of the flreights of Babelmandel before the end of Auguft. This meeting of the Maho- medans at Gedda has given rife to a fort of annual fair there, which as all goods imported pay a * Khumseen or Khurafoon, the Arabic term fifty; from this wind blowing during that number of days in the mannet above defcribed, D 2 regular[ xvi ] regular duty of ten per cent, muft yield a confi- derable revenue to the government. T he government of Gedda properly fpeaking is vefted in the Sherreef or high Prieil of Mecca j but in order when neceflary to obtain the pro- tedion and fupport of the Turks, he alfo allows- the * Grand Signior to fend a Bafhaw there. The Sherreef appropriates the major part of the revenues to his own ufe, giving only a fmall fhare of them to the Bafliaw but fometimes he is obliged alfo to tranfmit a few purfes to Conftantinople, to keep the Grand Signior and his minifters in good humour. I n the year 1774 the Governor General of Bengal propofed to fome merchants in Calcutta to fend a fhip to the Red Sea, loaded with a proper aflbrtment of goods for the Turkifh mar kets ; and inftead of landing them at Gedda, he advifed their being fent directly to Suez j by which means he expected to eftablifli a new trade equally beneficial to us and to the Turks * 1 he Grand Signior affecls to have imperial authority over the three Arabias, and the coaft of Barbary, but which in fail is never allowed by the Princes of any of thofe countrieSj unlefs when it fuits their convenience as in this inHance. in[ xvil ] in general, and alio to open a new channel for tranTmitting intelligence backwards and for wards, between India and Europe. It is not neceflary in this place to confider the merits of the commercial part of this plan, fuffice it to fay, that the Sherreef of Mecca very foon took the alarm, and ufed all his influence both fpiri- tual and temporal to put a Hop to its continu ance. In his negociation at the Porte in this bufinefs, he was zealoufly affifted alfo by a large body of Turkifh merchants, who were appre- henfive of fuifering by the prices of India goods being lowered in their markets, which muft have totally put an end to the old eftablifhed trade of B flora and Aleppo. By fuch a weighty concurrence of intereft an edid: was obtained from the Grand Signior, which flripped of its ofiicial tautology, and oriental hyperbole, con tains no more than what follows. ' H istorians inform us, that the Chrif- tians, an enterprizing and artful race, have ' from the earlieft times conftantly made ufe of ♦ $ deceit and violence to efFed: their ambitious ' purpofes. Under the difguife of merchants ' they formerly introduced themfelves into ' Damafcus and Jerufalem; in the fame man- &lt;£ ner[ xviii ] ** ner they have fince obtained a footing in ' Hindoftan, where the Englifh have reduced ' the inhabitants to llavery; fo now likewife *' encouraged by the Beys, the fame people have ' lately attempted to infinuate themfelves into ' Egypt, with a view no doubt as foon as they ' have made maps of the country, and taken ' plans of the fortifications, to attempt the ' conqueft of it. &lt;e I n order to counteract thefe their danger- ' ous defigns, on firft hearing of their proceed- *' ings, we enjoined their Ambaffador to write te to his court defiring their velTels might not ' be allowed to frequent the port of Suez; &lt;( which requifition having been fully complied ' with, if any of their veffels prefume here- * e after to anchor there, the cargo fliall be con- ' fifcated, and all perfons on board be impri- ' foned, until our further pleafure be known.' If it were neceiTary, the Chriftians might very eafily vindicate themfelves from the afper- fions contained in this edid:, and with great truth and juftice recriminate upon the Maho- medans ;and indeed had not the Grand Signior been ftrangely miiinformed concerning the pro ceedings[ xi» ] eeediags of both parties in India, he would hardly have ventured to make a comparifon between them. They are both equally ftrangers in that Country. The Mahomedans unprovoked by the Hindoos invaded and took pofleffion of their country j whereas the Englifli introduced them- felves as merchants, and carried on a trade very profitable to the natives for upwards of an hun dred years, without ever fhewing the leaft hoftile difpofition againft either the peaceable Hindoos, or the Mahomedan ufurpers. But after Surage ul Dowla had exercifed the mofl: wanton cruelty on the Company's fervants, by caufing a number of them to be fufFocated in the black hole of Calcutta; to revenge their deaths, and to preferve our com mercial privileges which we held by grant from the Court of Delhi, we firft took up arms in Ben gal : nor can the moft rigid moralift and much lefs the Grand Signior find any caufe to cenfure our condudtin thus vindicating the honour andintereft of our country*. It is true that Hindoftan has been * T he diiFerent condufl of the ChriiUans and Mahomedans in India will appear in a more Uriking point of view from th« relation[ XX ] been more impoverifhed under our govern ment in the fhort fpace of thirty years, than it was under that of the Moguls, in the courfe of three or four centuries from whence people haftily conclude, that the Hindoos have been more opprefled by us, than they were by their former conquerors. This opinion however is by no means well founded; it muft be remem- / relation of an anecdote of Oriental hiftoiy, which accidentally came to the knowledge of the author. ec S urage ul Dowlawas the grandfoil of the great A lyverdl Khan, who had a favourite wife, a woman of extraordinary abi lities and great virtue. When Alyverdi was dying, knowing the flighty and tyrannical difpofition of his grandfon, whom he intended for his fucce/Tor, he advifed him on all important occafions after his death to confult the old queen, whofe difcernment would enable her to forefee dangers imperceptible to an impetuous and inexperienced youth like him. W hen Surage ul Dowla inftigated by avarice intended to attack Calcutta, he confulted this oracle, who advifed him againft it in the following prophetic words. The Englilh are a peaceable and induflrious people; like bees, if properly encou raged and proteded, they will bring you honey, but beware of difturbing the hive 1 you may perhaps deftroy a few of them, but in the end believe me, they will fting you to death.' A pre- diftion which was foon after verified. From this well-known facl it appears that we were confidered as pacifically inclined, and by no means fufpedled of a difpofition to enflave the natives or quarrel with the Mahomedans; until compelled to take up arms to avoid being enflaved ourfelves,' bered[ xxi ] bered that thq Mahomedan invaders fettled in Hindoflan, and confequently the money their Viceroys exaded fr^m the Inhabitants of courfe returned again into general circulation; and during that time alfo the European nations im ported annually large fums in fpecie. But fince we acquired territorial poffeffions, not only our- felves but alfo almoft all other maritime powers of Europe, have traded with the fpecie of India, which having been for many years paft thus regularly drained, without receiving its ufual fupplies, is now almoft entirely exhaufted. Much more might be urged in our favour againft the charges exhibited againft us by the Grand Signior j but it being foreign to the fubjedt of this work, I fhall content myfelf with obferving, that his majefty evidently declares in his edid; the fentiments of others and not his own; for did he really think as unfavourably of us as he affeds to do in order to juftify his con- dud, he would not only exclude us from the port of Suez, but alfo compel us to leave every other part of his dominions j whereas on the contrary it is well-known, that he allows us to have fadories at Conftantinople, Smyrna, Alep po, and many other places in Turky, without (hewing the leaft apprehenfion of our feizing on E his[ xx ii ] hh cities, or enflaving his people. We may therefore reafonably confider the Sherreef of Mecca, as the principal author of this fcurrilous libel^ who hoped thereby to keep the trade of the Red Sea in its old channels ' '' When our government thought proper to comply with the requifition of the Porte con cerning the trade to Suez, it is much to be lamented, that our minifter at Conftantinople, was not inftrudled to flipulate for fome delay in ifluing the edidl, fo that a proper time might be allowed for fending a copy of it to India: for want of this precaution, fome merchants going in the mean time from Suez to Cairo, wereplundered and murdered by a body of Arabs. . Suppofing even for a moment, what was not the cafe, that the merchants had been informed of the prohibition ; ftill they were not punilhed in a regular manner, nor even according to the tenor of the firmaun, which decrees only a confifcation of their property, and an impri- fonment of their perfons: whereas thefe unfor tunate men were fome of them cut to pieces, and others left to perifh of hunger and thirft on the Defertj a mode of punifhment which plainly ihews, that the maflacre Was made by a ban ditti[ xxiii ] cJitti fet on by a ruffian like themfelves j the Turkifh government, defpotic as it is, would have proceeded with more regularity, and lefs cruelty. But here again we may trace the hand of the Sherreef of Mecca, who, no doubt, cxpeded by an adt of uncommon violence and barbarity, to deter every other Chriftian from paffing that way; and alfo at once to gratify his avarice and refentment, by feizing on fuch a valuable booty. B ut the Grand Signior having iiTued this iirmaun, forbidding our {hips to come to Suez, and exprefled himfelf in it, in fuch very ftrong terms: it may perhaps be deemed expedient to abandon the trade, rather than involve our- felves in a difpute with him j but furely no perfon will think, that we ought alfo to give up the right of fending pacquets that way, to which neither the Grand Signior, nor even the Sherreef of Mecca himfelf, can offer the fmal- lefb reafonable objedtion. E very man acquainted with India mufl; know, that it is of the higheft importance to individuals, to the company, and to the nation at large, to have this channel of communication E 2 openedC xxlv ] opened again. During the latter part of the late war, after the firmaun was iffued, the French regularly tranfmitted advices by Suez, to and from India, by which means they fre quently anticipated us in intelligence, and of courfe counterafted our operations. It is not neceflary to particularize every inflance, but it will doubtlefs be well remembered, that the news of the unfortunate defeat of Colonel Bailliecame to England through France, where it was known in February; time enough for them to fend out reinforcements to Hyder Ally, before the beft feafon for palling the Cape of Good Hope was elapfed: whilfl we who were ignorant of that difafter until April, could not fend out any fhips before the return of the enfuingfeafon, near fix months afterwards. S ince then, nothing lefs than the exiftence of our fettlements in India, may fome time or other depend upon our poffefling a right of pacing unmolefted through Egypt ; and the prohibitory firmaun was only intended to pre vent the trade of Gedda from being transferred to Suez; furely no time fhould be loft in demanding another firmaun explanatory of the firll:, and declaring that no perfons dependent on.[ XXV ] on, or connected with the Turkifli govern ment, flrall impede or moleft any Britifti fub- jed in paffing up the Red Sea, or through Egypt, provided they have nothing but papers and fuch baggage only as travellers may be fuppofed to have occafion for on fuch a journey. The Sherreef of Mecca may probably at firft oppofe our enjoying this privilege, in which alfo it is likely he will be fecretly fupported by the French*' j but can it be thought prudent in us to fubmit to the controul of the one, or to be dupes of the fecret machinations of the other, efpecially when confiftently with juilice, we can eafily get the better of both. After fhewing from what caufe, the oppo- fition to our having a free paflage this way to India arofe, and expofing the futility of the charges contained in the edidt: I fhall next confider what is the beffc time for fetting out from England. * I t is not intended to infmuate that the French ever did, or ever would co-operate with the Sherreef in employing aflaffins ; but as our rivals in politics, it is very natural to fuppofe they will endeavour to prevail on the Grand Signior, not to revoke bis prefent iirmaun, the cxiilence of which is fo difgraceful and detrimental to u§i The[ xxvi J T he feafon for undertaking this journey com mences early in April, and ends early in June ; during which timeaperfon accuftomed to travel, will eafily arrive at Alexandria from London in about a month, that is fuppofing he has previ- oufly determined what route to purfue to the Mediterranean j and alfo has caufed a veffel to be prepared for him on his arrival at the place where he intends to embark. The northerly and wefterly winds prevail in the Mediterranean in May, June and July; and therefore in thefe months, the paffage from Marfeilles, Leghorn, or Venice to Alexandria, in a tolerable good failing veflel feldom exceeds eighteen days, and is often performed in ten or twelve; from Alex andria he will eafily get to Suez in eight days; and from thence to Anjengo is a voyage of twenty-five days; to Bombay twenty-eight; to Madras thirty-five; and to Bengal forty; mak ing the journey from England to India, at the moft feventy-eight days, at the leaft fifty- nine, and at a medium fixty-eight and a half. This perhaps to fome people, may appear too nice a calculation, confidering it is an undertak ing dependent upon many accidents of winds and weather; but in anfwer to this objection it mud be remembered, that great part of the voyage[ xxvii ] voyage is performed within the Tropic, where the winds and weather are perfectly periodical: and even in the Mediterranean where only the winds are variable, they are never known in fummer, -to blow long between the S. and E. the only quarter of the compafs unfavourable to the veffels bound from the ports of Italy and France, to the Levant. The manner of performing the principal part of the voyage, that is through Egypt and from thence to In dia, is in a great meafure explained in the fol lowing Letter ;but in that nothing is men tioned of the European part of the journey. It cannot be neceffary to offer much advice to couriers, they of courfe confult only the mo ft expeditious mode of travelling, without paying the leaft attention to their own private pleafure or convenience. Gentlemen on the contrary, lefs able, or lefs willing to bear fatigue, will wifti to be informed how they may perform this voyage agreeably; at a moderate expence •,and without a rifque of injuring their health. The firft thing to be provided is a ftrong fecond-hand poft-chaife, which will coft between thirty and forty pounds : a large trunk before, a fmall one behind, and a chaife feat[ xxviii ] feat will carry as much or more baggage than is neceffary for two gentlemen, and one fervant; allowing each gentleman a Turkifli drefs, two coats, a dozen and half of fhirts, two dozen pair of common, and one dozen pair of filk ftockings, two pair of fhoes, and other necef- faries in the fame proportion. This perhaps may be thought a fcanty allowance ; for gene rally young travellers prepare for their firfl: excurfion on the continent, as if nothing could be procured out of their own country ; whereas experience foon teaches them that they have not occafion for much more baggage than Mr. Sterne carried with him on his fentimental journey. Thofe who are fond of tea, and arc nice about the quality of it, as many Englifh- men are, will do well to take two or three pounds with them ; for that which they will find in the inns abroad or any where on the way will be rather coarfe and unpalatable. It may alfo be proper to take a few cakes of port able foup to ferve on board a fhip, and even on fhore, particularly in Egypt; to which may be added a bottle or two of the effence of fellery, with which and a little vermicelli or rice, a perfon may prepare a good mefs of foup on the Defert, t I YC xx ' x ] t)erer't, with the fame fire that ferves the Arabs, to boil their coffee-. With liquor every perfoh may fuit him- felf, remembering that either in France or Italy at the place where he embarks, he may pur- chafe a great Variety of good wines; and at Alexandria he may procure a frefli fupply, fhould his fea flock be exhaufted on his arrival there. As to medicines it is univerfally allowed the fewer he is obliged to take the better, ft ill however he (hould confider his conflitutioh, and if he is fubjed to any particular diforder, he will do well to confult his phyfician about carrying with him a fmall quantity of thofe medicines which he is mofl likely to require. The moft healthy and robuft are not exempt from accidents, therefore every perfon may take from England half a dozen papers of James's powders, and two pounds of bark, which are cheap, and eaftly carried, and beftdes the for mer is feldom to be procured fo good in any foreign country; no perfon however fhould take or adminifter thefe medicines, without having previoufly endeavoured to learn in what cafes, and in what proportions, they may be given with efficacy and fafety. This advice, F efpe-[ XXX ] efpecially that which relates to culinary matters^ ^ may appear trivial to travellers who have been accuftomed to go from one poft town to an other in Europej but in Afia, where there are' no inns, a prudent man although no epicure will do well to guard again ft being in want of a fufficient fupply of wholefome food. The neceffity of carrying medicine will hardly be difputed, but neither would I advife any per- fon to undertake croffing the great defert, with out learning to bleed and drefs flight wounds} by which means he may not only fave his own life, or that of a friend, but he will alfo merely from the reputation of his fkill, obtain great refpeft from the whole caravan. The practice of furgery it is true is difagreeable to thofe who are not brought up in the profeffion j but it is ftill more difagreeable not to be able to adminifter relief to a fellow creature in diflrefs. T hese hints being given for providing ^ carriage, clothes, provifion and medicines, fomc account may next be expected of the expence, but that is at prefent impofilble. If govern ment or the company fhould hereafter ellablifll pacquet boats between the European ports and Alex-f XXXI 4 \ Alexandria, and alfo between Suez and the ports of India, the expence will then be eafily afcer- tained, and confidering the length of the voy age, be very moderate. The chaife will fell at the place of embarkation for as much or more than it coft in England; the only expence there fore of the journey through Europe would be the pofl horfes and charges at the inns, amount ing to thofe who like to live well to about fifty pounds; to the Captain of the pacquet to Alexandria, if he finds the table, forty pounds; at Alexandria ten pounds j from thence to Suez forty pounds; at Suez ten pounds j from thence to India lixty pounds; and for pontingences forty pounds j making altogether two hundred and fifty pounds, which divided between two, makes one hundred and twenty- five pounds each. But this account of the journey, and the calculation of the expence muft be underftood to relate only to the outward bound pafTengers: tbofe who come home will not travel fo faft, nor fa cheap j for in the firft place they will be much longer coming up, than going down the Red Sea, and confe- quently muft: pay dearer for their paflfage; and b5fides the delay and expence of performing F qua-[ xxxil ] quarantine mufl come into the account of thel) return from. India to Europe. It is faid a plan is now in agitation t® fubvert the Turkirti empire, the fuccefs of which mull in a great meafure depend upon the part we are inclined to take in the contefl; but fhould the Imperialifts and Ruffians pre vail ithe d?fert between Suez and Cairo may hereafter become the poft road to India, and Europeans pafs it with as little apprehenfion of danger, as any perfon now feels in performing a journey from London to Paris. But this perhaps to fome politicians may not be thought a very defirable event, left fuch a facility of communication between Europe and Afia, fhould in the end be detrimental to our India trade. Let fuch men calculate the expence of fending goods up the Red Sea to Suez; of landing thofe goods, and tranfporting them on camels upwards of feventy miles to the Nile^ of fending them from Cairo to Alexandria a # S ince tlie publication of the iirft edition of tKis work, a -peace has been concluded between the Ruffians and the Turks* by which the former have obtained from the latter the free na vigation of the Black Sea, and many other confiderable ad vantages. Rot[ xxxiii | Rofetta, or Damietta; and of reimbarking them at one of thofe places for the European Markets; and they will find that goods fent round the Cape of Godd Hope at a proper feafon, and fubjed: to no expence, or danger of being fpoilt on the way, would come at leaft fifty per cent, cheaper to any market in Europe. W hen the Venetians loft the India trade, no violence, no fineffe was ufed to deprive them of it j the trade died away of itfelf, becaufe the Portugeze and other European nations, paffing round the Cape of Good Hope, could by means of the fhortnefs and ^afety of the voyage, afford to under-fell them in thofe arti cles of India commerce which they received only by the more tedious, dangerous, and ex- penfive channel of the Red Sea: But the proba bility of the danger of the trade by this route becoming prejudicial to ours by the Cape of Good Hope, being admitted in its fullefl extent j are we to fuppofe that other European nations are Co blind to their own intereft, fo ftrangely' ignorant, or fo abfurdly indolent, as not to difcover it, ?ind immediately avail themfelves of their knowledge ? If goods can realy be brought cheaper from India to Europe that way, in[ XXXIV ] 1 in vain fhall we attempt to oppofe the general interefts of Europe and Afia; the India trade inuft in the courfe of a few years unavoidably jjjnd its way to the eafieft and rr^oft profitable channel. He who thinks otherwife, knows but little of human nature, and ft^l lefs of tho principles of politics, and trade. B ut whether or not the trade by the Red Sea will materially operate to the prejudice of that by the Cape of Good Hope, is not at prefent the queftion j nor is it certainly our bufinefs to encourage the experiment: all that is immediately contended for is the revoca tion of the firmaun, as far as relates to obtain ing a free paflage for our couriers through Egypt, which in common juftice cannot be refufed. The tenor of the firmaun effenti- ally affedls our intereft, and the language of it is extremely infulting nor fhould it be for gotten that it was iffued in the hour of our deepeft diftrefs. Happily the fcene is now re- verfed, of which if we are too generous to take advantage, ftill however it is to be hoped we fhall at leaft oblige the Turks to admit our claims of a free paffage through every part of . their dominions, THB[ XXJtV ] T he way to India by Baflbra is fatiguing, and rather dangerous, and confequently Will feldom be taken by choice, or for the bare gra tification of curiofity; but as fome of the com pany's fervants may be obliged to pafs over the great Defert on public bufinefs, 1 think it in cumbent on me to furnifh them with all the information in my power, that they may ex ecute the orders of their employers with fafety and difpatch j and alfo perform the journey with all poffible convenience to themfelves. For this purpofe I fhall fubjoin to this work the copy of a journal I kept when going that route, and as a common itinerary would be very uninterefting to moil readers, I fliall in- terfperfe in it fome anecdotes and remarks, which I truft will be deemed both amufing and ufeful. B y the feveral ways of the Cape of Good Hope, Suez, and Baffora, we fhall be able to fend difpatches to and from India at all feafons j but being excluded from any one of them, there will be an anxious interval of fome months in every year, when we fhall mutually be ig norant of what is paffing in the different coun tries. The |jefl feafon for leaving England, to[ xxxvl 3 g6 by the Cape of Good Hope, commences i.. November and ends in April; that by Suez commences in April and ends in the middle of Junej and that by Baffora will be the bed route all the reft of the year. To have a con' ftant fucceffion of intelligence cftabiiihed almoft as regular as our pofts at home, would be but a very trifling, if any expence j would afford ge neral fatisfadtion to every perfon concerned in India affairs j and at the fame time would be productive of innumerable advantages both to Government and the Eaft India company. i§® C&amp;ty&lt;&amp;0&amp;Cfcd$D0$3^c^co$co$o c^o^c^cjoojo^o^sc^o :&lt; ^i§5^ f-i- )8C W - •-■i- -i-l- J6.*^trf V LETTER. SIR, - ' - I SHOULD find very little difficulty in writ ing fuch an account of a journey over land to Europe by the way of Suez as would be ufeful, and perhaps in fome degree entertaining to a perfon who had never pafled over the great defert j but I confefs myfelf puzzled how to addrefs you on the fubjedl, who have already gone by the way of Baffora, and confequently xnuft be perfedlly acquainted with almoft every thing neceflary for a traveller to know. But as G I may[ 2 ] I may not be able to difcriminate between what may, and what may not be requifite for you, to know; allow me Sir! to enter on the fubjeft, as if you had never been in Arabia; the major part of the advice if not necelfary for yourfelf, may hereafter perhaps be ferviceable to fome of your friends. The principal objedlions I have heard men tioned againft a voyage to Europe by the way of Suez are the expence, the inconvenience, and the danger of it. The expence would be trif ling to a man of fortune, or when divided be tween two or three perfons would be lefs to each of them than going round the Cape of Good Hope ; the navigation of the Red Sea being now tolerably well known can in a proper feafon no longer be deemed dangerous; and as to incon venience, I know of none, but what might be aim oft entirely removed by means of a little money properly applied. In paffing from Suez to Alexandria, you may poffibly meet with fome difagreeable embarralfments from which a man of rank and fortune is generally exempt in a more civilized country but moft of thefe are to be avoided, or at leaft greatly leflened by giving prefents[ 3 ] I prefents of no great value to the Beys, and other leading men in Egypt. In all Arabian and Turkifli countries, efpe- cially in thofe near the city of Mecca, to avoid the infults of the lower clafs of people, an European lliould allow his beard and whilkers to grow, and always wear an Eaftern drefs; it is befl to make up a coarfe one in the Arabian fafhion for travelling, and another rather elegant in the Turkifh fafhion to wear at Cairo, and Alexandria. If you perform the journey in winter, a pellis will be both ufeful and orna mental j but it may be proper to remark that a Chriftian fliould not wear green clothes at any place in the Levant, for green is a colour deemed facred to thofe who have made the pil grimage to Mecca, and to the defcendants of the Prophetj nor do the Turks like to fee an Euro pean in red, which was alfo Mahomed's favou rite colour. Those who undertake long journies in Europe are obliged to furnifh themfelves with bills of exchange, but on this they are not indifpenfa- bly neceffary j a perfon of character may have credit to any amount the whole way for drafts G 2 upont 4 ] upon England or India ; but if you do not choofe to be without a fufficient fupply of ready money, you fhould take with you Venetian che- quins, which are very portable, and at the fame time current in all countries between India and England. I presume you will find no difficulty in get ting an Interpreter to attend you, who fpeaks both the Arabic and Turkifh languages: the former is abfolutely necefTary from the entrance of the Red Sea to Suez, the latter is moftly ufed by all men of diftindlion in Egypt. D uring the month of November, at which time I fhould propofe you to leave Madras, the voyage round the ifland of Ceylon is extremely tedious ;I fhould imagine therefore it would be more eligible for you to apply to the Govern ment of Bombay, for one or more of the Com pany's cruizers, to be fent about the middle of November to Anjengo, the one for yourfelf, and another fmall one for a tender or pilot vefTel. The captain of the fhip on which you embark will of courfe take care to lay in a fufficient flock of every kind of provifion for your table, but above all he fliould be directed to take plenty of waterC 5 1 water from Bombay, for that on the fouthern part of the Malabar Coafl is but indifferent, and the beft to be got in the Red Sea is fcarcely drinkable. If you travel through the Travan- core country with your baggage in the month of November, which is during the height of the Monfoon, the rain may fpoil it; your fervants therefore (hould fet out with it fomewhat ear lier : in a good palanquin you yourfelf will be very little incommoded by the weather, for you may fleep every night in good Choultries or elfe in Churches all the way from Pallamcotah to Anjengo*. A mariner might perhaps advife you not to fail fo foon as November from the Malabar coafl; he would fay it was too early to make the moft expeditious paffage, for that * I n the Eall where there are no inns, they have been obliged to eredt public buildings for the reception of travellers, which bear different names in different countries ; on the coaft of Cho- jomandel they are called Choultries, The above-mentioned Churches are thofe which the Catholic Miffionaries have prevailed on the King of Travancore to allow them to build on the fea coafl of his country; but the good fathers, although indefati gable in their duty, have by their zeal rather injured than ferved the caufe of Chriflianity; for having received the lowefl and moil abandoned outcaRs of the country into the bofom of the church, and not made any other converts; the Chriftians in In dia with refped to religion, are univerfally looked upon as the refufe of all other people# you[ 6 ] you will be liable to meet with contrary winds abov6 Gedda. It is true if you are defirous of making a fliort voyage to Suez you fhould not think of paffing Gedda before the commence ment of the Khumfeen wind; but for my own part, I (hould not hefitate about fubmitting to be a few days longer on board a fhip to enjoy the fatisfadion of travelling through Egypt in cool weather. The Khumfeen wind comes from the fame quarter as the well known Siroco, and is productive of nearly the fame effefts; it is unpleafant even at fea, and in paffing the defert would be almoft intolerable. The plague is alfo apt to break out late in the fpring, and feldom rages at Cairo violently before March or April. As your Captain will doubtlefs be an experienced officer, and likewife be furniflied with good charts, it will not be neceffary for me to trouble you with a nautical memoire j I fhall therefore only touch very flightly on marine obfervations, and confine my remarks to what may principally contribute to your con« venience or amufement. It is ufual for fhips in the month of No vember to work up the Malabar coaft by the affiftance of the land and fea breezes as high as Porcat 7 ] Porca or Cochin, and then with the N. E. wind to firetch over to the weflward, and make Calpini and Schulipar two of the Lacadivi's; after leaving thefe the next land you make is the ifland of Socotra, which is fituated near the entrance of the Streights of Babelmandel. The Arabian or Eaft fhore of thefe ffcreights, to which you approach within a few leagues, af fords fome very romantic views; confifting prin cipally of immenfe mountains and high broken rocks, with the ruins of caftles upon them | but there are few inhabited towns of any emi nence until you have paffed the liland of Perim, which with the cape on the eaftern fhore forms what the Arabs call A1 Bab, or the Gate. You will lofe very little time by flopping at Mocha, which is the firfl; feaport town on the eafl coaft of the Red Sea within the gate, where you may procure all kinds of refrefhments, particularly plenty of moft excellent grapes,. If your flock of provifions brought from Bom bay fhould not be good, or be nearly exhaufled; you may purchafe here AbifTynian fheep, which are exadlly the fame as thofe at the Cape of Good Hope, half a dozen of which will be fufficient to laflyou to Gedda, where you will be able to fup- P 3 7[ 8 ] ply yourfelffufficiently with every thing neceflary for the remainder of the voyage, both of a better quality and at a cheaper rate. T he fheep at Mocha are very dear, being all brought over as an article of trade from the oppofite ihore of Abiffynia: it appears however very extraordinary that the natives of the fouth- ern part of Arabia Felix who breed the fin eft horfes, mules, and affes in the world, fhould negledt to breed {heep, which doubtlefs would thrive very well in the fame paftures; efpeci- ally as mutton and lamb, conftitute a principal part of their own food. T he view of Mocha from the Sea, will pro bably induce you to go on Ihore there i the houfes, mofques, minarets, and even the walls of the place are white-wafhed, which at a diftance gives an air of neatnefs to the town, but the infide of it you will find by no means correfpond with its external appearance. The Governor will certainly fend you an invitation by the Company's broker to come on fhore; and if you accept of it, I am perfuaded he will receive you with the utmoft refpedl. We were introduced to him as common travellers going to[ 9 ] to Suez, on our way to Europe. On our landing, hecaufed us to be faluted with three guns, and the mafter of the port gave us coffee at the gate where we flopped a few minutes, to wait the arrival of the Governor's mufick, and alfo a horfe to be led before each of us: preceded in this manner, and attended by fome perfons of rank, we went to the Governor's houfe, which flands in the middle of a large fquare, and is built of rough flone, and unburnt brick : . we were conduced up two pair of narrow broken flairs into his apartments, where he was feated in a kind of raifed window feat, to com mand a view of the fea; he rofe when we en tered the room, and faluted us very courteoufly in the manner of the Arabians, by placing his right hand on his left breafl, and flightly in clining his head. After fome general converfa- tion about our intended journey, which con* tinned about a quarter of an hour, pipes, fweetmeats and coffee were brought, and at lafl a cenfer to perfume the beard and clothes, the introdudion of which, in all Eaflern countries as you very well know. Sir, is intended as a hint for taking leave. H I fIf you choofe to lleep on fliorc, the broker will condudt you to a houfe belonging to the Company, buil'' in the Arabian ftile. A gen tleman of the Bombay eftablifhment, rellded here two or three years as a fupra-cargo, or agent, but the plan not anfvvering either to him or his employers, he was recalled; and the Company's bufinefs has fince in a great meafure been tranfa£led by the broker, who is a native of Guzerat, and fpeaks both Englifli and Moors. V ... , , ' . , . J ^ '• v I • - - i ' : There are fome few dangerous 'flioals be- tween Mocha and Gedda, but nothing is to be apprehended from them at this feafon of the year, when the wind thus far is fair for going to the Northward. The town of Gedda is not particularly worth feeing, and therefore it is letter not to go on ihore there, for as it is only iixty miles diftant from Mecca, a Chriftian of whatever rank, even although difguifed in the country drefs, would be liable to difagreeable taunts and infults from the mob, who almofl: ^ « think themfelves contaminated with the breath of an unbeliever when fo near their holy ground. Your interpreter, or any Mahomedaa belong ingC ' ] ing to your vcflel, will be able to get you any thing you may want. It is at Gedda that the difagreeable part of the voyage commences, for within a degree or two at moft North of this place you generally lofe the Monfoon, and meet the N. W. Wind, which as I have before obferved prevails above ten months of the year in this part of the Red Sea. The Gedda pilots who make an annual voyage backwards and forwards to Suez, muft of courfe-be acquainted with all the ports, and alfo with the winds and currents and appearance of bad weather, &amp;c.—It would therefore be prudent to take one of them to conduit you Jafely to Suez ; the expence I believe would not exceed thirty pounds, and he may probably ill or ten your voyage at leaft a fortnight, or per haps three weeks, befides leflening the danger. n It is much to be lamented, that the Captain, of the Coventry Frigate, who lately went up the Red Sea, was inadvertently betrayed into a quarrel with the inhabitants of Co fire, a place about fix degrees North of Gedda on the Wef- tern flidre, and only one hundred, and twenty miles from the banks of the Nile j a perfon if II 2 * he[ ^ ] Be could with fafety, would at all times choofe to land there in preference to Suez, for the up per part of the Red Sea is the mo ft tedious and dangerous part of the whole voyage, and befides Upper Egypt is full of monuments of antiquity. The ruins of the famous city of Thebes are within a very^few miles of Ghinnah, where you go to from Cofire ;and the banks of the Nile ail the way from thence to Cairo, are co vered with valuable remains of ruined cities, of which Dr. Pococke and Mr. Norden have pub- liflied very learned and accurate accounts. It is faid that not only the fort, and a number of houfes were deftroyed, but alfo that near fix hundred of the inhabitants were killed. This account is probably very much exaggerated, but it is to be feared as a heavy fire was kept up on the town for upwards of two hours, many of the people muft have fallen, and therefore at prefent it is unneceflary to examine more minutely into this route. I cannot however conclude this digrefiion without expreffing a hope that fome atonement will be made to them for their lolles, which whether they were attacked juftly or not, is abfolutely neceflary before any European ought to venture to pafs that way: by way of retaliation they will fa- crifice[ '3 1 crifice every one they can get hold of, until ibme effedlual means have been taken to pacify them. There are many large towns on the Eaft fide of the Red Sea between Gedda and Suez, v but as one Arabian town differs very little from, another, after having feen Mocha, it would only be a lofs of time to flop either at Yambo, or Tor; the former a place of great trade not far from Medina; and the latter a fmall port in habited principally by pilots, where there are wells of tolerable good water. Tor is about five and thirty miles from Mount Sinai, near to which there is a convent of Greek Chriftians, faid to have been founded by the Emprefs Helena, and dedicated to St. Catherine. If you. have any curiofity to fee this convent in all probability by writing to the monks, permiffioa might be obtained from the Arabs to pafs un- molefted from Tor; but the Arabs and monks are not always on good terms: the rapacity of the former, the defencelefs ftate of the latter, and the bigotry of both parties, occafion fre quent difputes between them. The monks to guard againft any furprife, conftantly keep their doors fhut, and when they have occafion to go out[ H J out or come in, are drawn.up in a bafket to one of the windows of the convent, which are not lefs than forty feet highj but they feldom go out, having every article of provilion for their table within their own walls, which are rather more than three quarters of a mile in extent. The voyage from * Tor to Suez may eafily be performed in one day with a fair wind, but at any rate in five. Immediately as a fhip appears in fight of Suez, a boat is fent on board to en quire the purpofe of her coming : and the officer generally brings a prefent from the Governor confifting of a fheep or two, fome fmall flat cakes of bread, ajar of water, and a fmall quan tity of fruit, particularly oranges, which are Juicy and of a very delicious flavour. As the meiTenger is a man of fome rank, it is ufual to falute him with three guns, and to entertain him with coffee, tobacco, fweetmeats, &amp;c. When he returns on fhore he will carry a letter for you to any perfon at Cairo, and it will be * THE-journey from Tor to Gazais ufually performed by Ae Arabs in five days, but it is not to be attempted by Euro peans until we are on perfefl; good terms with the Sherreef of Mecca, and alfo with the Sheicks of the neighbouring defert. \[ ^5 ] ' 00n « forwarded by exprefs the fame evening, together !renot with an account of your arrival to the principal S 0 Bey of Cairo, who is called Sheick Belled. It would not be prudent to write any fecrets in the letter, but you may fend inftrudlions concerning your journey, and diredlions to have a velfel prepared for you at Alexandria. Your rank you eafilylt may conceal or mention as you, think proper. In my opinion fuppoling they have no reafon to papptB fufped; you of carrying money or jewels to any irdtots. great amount, it would be better to make your- tkoicti felf known. They may indeed expeil prefents Gorai accordingly, but then their attention to you will 'mil ill a ^ 0 be proportioned to your liberality to them ; ill quail. the difference of expence will be but trifling to lich are a m an of fortuqe, and the conveniences you will As the derive from being thought a perfon of high fla- ifualto tion wil1 be very great. Lord A. Percy who atertaia was at Cairo in the year 1776, appeared there ;s to. bis proper charadter and was treated with I ^letter great politenefs 1 ; nor if I was well in formed, will lit ^ vas a great difproportion between the prefents he gave, and thofe he received in return. 10^1 ^P er ^ on w bo from neceffity is obliged, or .'jtyEifo* from difpofition inclined to be a rigid oecono- (Sittteefof mift, fhould not attempt to travel for curiofity ^ or pleafure in the Levant, where the infolence andand bigotry of the natives can only be got the better of by an appearance of wealth and libe rality j fhould bufinefs oblige any one to pafs that way who is not rich, or indifferent about expencej he muft do the beft he can, but he will do well to lay in a good flock of patience. The Governor of Suez is generally one of the Beys or Lords who compofe the Ariftocracy in. Egypt, his rank of courfe entitles him to fome attention. If you chufe to vifit him. it is only neceffary to announce your intention the day before, and to fix the hour you will go on (hore, and he will doubtlefs receive you with civility. But as the anfwer of your letter to Cairo will probably come back in four days at moft, it will perhaps be better to wait until it arrives: for the Governor of Suez will not know what re ception to give you until he hears from Cairo, and in the mean time, you may plead ill health for ftaying on board the fhip. T he moft acceptable prefents you can offer thefe people are fhort double barrelled filver mounted guns or piftols, if bell mouthed the better, china bowls, fmall French gold repeat ing watches, {hauls, keemkaubs, or pieces of mullin. Any of thefe things given to the Go vernor[ 1 7 ] vernor of Suez, and fome trifle of the fame k'nd to the officer of the cuftoms, who is a fervant to the Grand Signior, and appointed by the Bafliaw at Cairo, will enfure you great refpedt, and pre vent your baggage from being fearched and tumbled. A cautious man or an ceconomifl might objeft to a declaration of your rank, leaft your fuppofed wealth being made known to the Arabs, {hould tempt them to attack you in paf- fing the defert; for my own part I do not think there is any danger of it, and indeed I am con vinced there is more rifque in fubjefting your- felf to be difcovered by accident, than by pub- lickly avowing your rank; and declaring that the purpofes of your journey are curiofity and amufe- ment. The prefent Duke de Lafoens, a Portu- gueze nobleman, was incognito at Alexandria nearly at the fame time that Lord Percy appeared there in his proper character, and whilfi; the lat ter was allowed to ride on horfeback, attended by guards, and^received prefents of horfes and other things nearly equivalent to what he gave to the Beys; an order was iffued to arrefl the former, and it was with fome difficulty that affifted by Mr. Baldwin he made his efcape on I board v ■ V ■ ' ' . ^ V.-', ^ J K 4 ; 1 y[ &gt;8 ] % board a fliip lying at Alexandria*. Tne Sheick Belled has great authority over both the Turks and Arabs, and therefore prote^ed by his guards, which probably he would fend to efcort you as foon as he is informed who you are, you would pafs the Ifthmus of Suez without any danger of being molefted. T he diftance from Suez to Cairo is not more than feventy miles, fome people have reprefented this little journey as very fatiguing and danger ous. I have already given ray opinion of the danger, which with common difcretion I muft repeat, appears to me perfedly imaginary j and as to fatigue you may travel in a tukt-rawan or litter carried by camels or mules, the motion of which is not very uneafy: thefe machines are eafily procured at Cairo, but it would be mofl advifeable for you to get one made of bamboo at Bombay, 'which would be both light and commodious, and ferve you both as a travelling carriage and a tent. Should you not choofe to be encumbered with a tukt-rawan, nor the Bey # T he Spaniards and Portugueze carry on a kind of perpe- ttial. war againft all Mahomedans; which was an additional reafon for the Bey's intending to imprifon the above-mentioned nobleman. fendI *9 ] fend you a horfe, your agent will be able to procure you one at Cairo ; but at the word, you may borrow one of the Arabian guards who efcort you from Suez, and thefe horfes although not very handfome, are far'from being unplea- fant to ride j their paces are agreeable, and they are entirely free from vice. When the day of your departure from Suez is fixed, you fhould make a large provifion of bread and ready dreffed meat, fowls, mutton, &amp;c. the feafoft being cold, fuch things will keep good for three or four days, which is lon ger than you can well be on the ro&amp;d to Cairo. Your party will always halt at night, when you may drefs any thing, if you prefer hot victuals to cold. There is no water on the defert, and therefore I would advife you to take a few dozen bottles in balkets from the iliip j for that at Suez is rather brackifli, and befides the Arabs carry theirs in fkins, which are not always'very clean. Notwithstanding I think there is no ■ danger of being molefted by the Arabs, efpeci- ally after having taken the precautions I have already mentioned; yet to put it paft a doubt, I 2 I wo u I'd[ 20 ] I'would advife you when the paflpoit comes from Cairo, to fend your baggage forwards a couple of days before you ;and when you have heard by exprefs fent back to you that it is advanced about half way to Cairo ;unincumbered with a firing of camels, that move flowly and detain each other, you may then fet out; and without travelling in the heat of the day, arrive yourfelf at moft in eight and fotty hours, allowing even a proper time for fleep and refrefhment on the way. The Arabs, unlefs tempted by the hopes of plunder, or provoked by fome adt of hoftility, are never guilty of violence to travellers of any denomination ; therefore if your baggage pafles unmolefted, which muft ever be the fole objed of their attack, your perfon will be perfedily fafe. This journey might be performed with great eafe in eighteen or twenty hours, but then your baggage muft be left behind j nor will you eafily perfuade your efcort to keep up with you at this rate of travelling. T he face of the country nearly refembles that of the great defert, being barren and deftitute of trees, excepting a few of the Egyptian thorn, bearing a yellow flower. Within about twenty miles of Cairo, you meet with rocks amongft which[ 21 ] which you may find a ftone that refembles pe trified wpod beautifully variegated. I thought it fufficiently curious to be taken to Europe ; and therefore carried a few fmall pieces with, me, which were much admired at home. It is neceflary to get to Cairo before fun-fet, at which time the gates are fhut j for if you arrive five minutes after they are clofed, you will be obliged to pafs the night very uncom fortably in the fuburbs amongfl: poor Arabian huts. But independent of this inconvenience it is very defirable to be near Cairo about the mid dle of the day to enjoy one of the moft pleafing profpedts I have ever feen j the beauties of which perhaps are fomewhat heightened by coming after a fucceffion of views every one more dreary and defolate than the other. When about three miles from Cairo, from the fummit of an Hill you perceive that city lituated in a fertile valley, and watered by the Nile, which meanders at the fide of, and be yond its walls through a rich country as far as the eye can reach each way. To the S. W, is an immenfe high rock, at the foot of which and adjoining to the town is the citadel and pa lace;I 22 ] lace j to the N. and N. W. the buildings cover . a fpace of at leaft ten or twelve miles in circum ference, amongft which are many magnificent tombs andtnofques, whofe domes and adjoining columns give -a variety to this view, furpaffing even that of the beft built towns in the Catho- lick countries, where the churches add greatly to the beauty of their external appearance. The weather was rather hazy the day we were on this hill, or I fhould fuppofe we muft alfo have per ceived the Pyramids in the back ground of this charming landfcape. U pon entering the gates of the city you are not ftopt and interrogated as you generally are coming into the towns oh the continent of Eu rope, but your guides condudt-you immediately- to the houfe of your European correfpondent j „ and he the next day will fettle with the officers of the cuftoms about your baggage. If they have fealed up your trunks at Suez, as they ufually do, you fliould not fuiFer thofe feals to be taken off, or broken j for they may be glad of fuch a pretence for threatening you with the difplea- fure of government, in order to demand a con- fiderable bribe for hufh money : thefe artifices they will be likely enough to prailife upon you if[ 23 ] if you afford them an opportunity, cfpeclally if you conceal your name and rank. T he officers of the cuftoms at Suez fealed up our trunks, and alfo our pa:cquets, and in this manner we carried them to Cairo ^ but as much rain fell whilft we were croffing the defert, we opened our trunks and boxes in order to dry our cloaths, but above all our papers ^ not however without having previoufly confulted a gentleman at Cairo, concerning the propriety of it. The next morning when the cuftom-houfe officers came to examine our baggage, being told of what we had done, they affedted to believe we had broken the feals to conceal fome prohibited goods, or at leaft to avoid paying the proper duties. We might perhaps-have been able to pacify them by means of a little money, but our friend flighted their menaces, trufling he fhould get the Sheick Belled to interfere in our behalf j unfortunately for us he was again deceived, and in the end this little a£l of inadvertency cofl: us near three hundred pounds, together with no little anxiety, on account of being detained fe- veral days at Alexandria by the order of the Bafhaw, v ,.•&lt; • • - . .♦ \ ... , v , ^ a .. After[ 2 4 J ■ After your arrival at Cairo, I would ad- vife you as well for health as for pleafure, al- moft immediately to repair to the hummam or bagnio. The Turkifti manner of bathing is infinitely fuperior to any thing of the kind that is now known, or at leaft pradifed in any part of Europe, for even moft of the inhabitants of Italy, once fo famous for the magnificence of their baths, have long negledted this luxurious but falutary cuftom j as fome of your friends may never have feen a Turkifli bagnio, I fhall attempt a defcription of that I ufed, which was one of the common fort, fuch as are to be met with in every city in the Levant.' The firft room is the undreffing chamber which is lofty and fpacious, about twenty-five feet long, and eighteen wide; near the wall is a kind of bench raifed about two feet from the floor, and about feven or eight feet wide, fo that after bathing a perfon may lie down upon it at full length j the windows are near the top of the room, as well that the wind may not blow upon the bathers when undreffed, as for decency's fake. After undrefiing a fervant gives you a napkin to wraptound you, and alfo a pair of flippers, and thus equipped you are conducted \[ 2 5 ] conduced through a narrow paffage to the ileam room or bath, which is a large round building of about twenty-five feet diameter paved with marble, and in the centre of it is a circular bench where you are feated until you find yourfelf in a profufe perfpiration ; then your guide or attendant immediately begins rub bing you with his hand covered with a piece of coarfe ftufF called Keffay, and thereby peels off from the fkin a kind of fkurf, which cannot be moved by wafhing only. When he has rubbed you a few minutes he conduds you to a fmall room, where there is a hot bath about four feet deep and ten feet fquare, in which he will offer to wafli you having his hand covered with a fmoother fluff than before; or you may have fome perfumed foap given you to wafti yourfelf: After you have remained here as long as agreeable you are conduced to another little fide room, where you find two cocks of water the one hot and the other cold j which you may throw over you with a bafon, the water being tempered to any degree of warmth, or perfectly cold if you prefer it. This being the lail ablu tion, you are then covered with a napkin, and from hence again conducted to the undreffing room, and placed upon the before-mentioned &amp; bench[ 26 ] bench with a carpet under you, and being ex tended upon it at full length, your attendant again offers to rub you dry with napkins. Some people have their nails cut, and alfo are fham- poed*; the Turks generally fmoak after bathing and the operation of fhampoing; and in about an hour, a few minutes more or lefs, they com monly drefs and go home. It is to be wifhed that fome able phyfician would take the trouble of informing us what would be the probable effedls of the ufe of the Turkifh baths in England. If we were to judge by a comparifon between the endemical diforders of Afia and Europe, we fhould fuppofe that the moderate ufe of the bath might render the gout * S hampoing is varioufly performed in different countries. The moll ufual manner is fimply preffing the hands and fingers upon the body and limbs, particularly near the extremities, fo as to comprefs, but not to pinch them. This is the general manner pra£lifed by the fervants of the Afiatics, but the barbers and the guides at the baths make alfo the joints and even the vertebra of the back crack by a fudden jerk, which to people imaccuftomed to it in their youth, is rather a painful fenfation. The Chinefe and Malay barbers particularly excel in this art, which however is very well known, and generally pradifed all over Afia, where it is thought a neceliary fubftitute for exerciic during the hot weather, and[ 2 7 1 ^nd rheumatifm as uncommon in this part of th* world, as they are in the other. Very few Afiatics are afflidled with thefe complaints, although they eat their meat very highly feafoned with fpices, and ftewed in cla rified butter j feldom take any exercife, and even many of them fecretly indulge in other excefles, which with us are fuppofed to caufe the gout. Why then may we not allow fome degree of efficacy in warm baths and fhampoing, in throwing off thofe humours, which not being removed, occalion the gout and other chronical diforders amongft us; but my knowledge of thefe matters being very fuperficial, I only hum bly fuggefl thefe ideas to the faculty for their confideration and opinion ; thus much however I can pretend to fay from my own experience, that the warm bath is very refrefhing after un dergoing violent fatigue. In coming from Suez to Cairo, a journey of feventy miles, I was ex po fed to very bad weather, for two days and two nights, with no tent or covering but a cloak. On my arrival at my journey's end very much harrafled with fatigue, and benumbed with cold I went into a warm bath, in which having re mained about half an hour I was perfectly reico- ■ ■ * K 2 vered.[ 28 ] vered, and never in my life was in better fpirits, or more able to have purfued my journey*. The * In the laft voyage of Captain Cooke which has been pub- liflied fince this letter was written are the following obfervations on the cuftom of fliampoing, which with the remarks I have ta« , ken the liberty of adding, I am in hopes will amufe the curious reader, and be of fervice to valetudinarians. Mr. Anderfon^ in the account of his vifit to the King of the idand of Tongataboo, vol. i. page 323, Cooke's voyage, obferves, when fupper was over, abundance of cloth was brought for us to fleep on ; but we were h good deal diHurbed by a lingular inftance ot &lt;c luxury, in which their principal men indulge themfelves; that of being beaten while they were afleep. Two women fat ' by Tuttafaihie, and performed this operation, which is called €e tooge tooge, by beating brifkly on his body and legs with both fifts as on a drum, till he fell afleep ; when once the perfon is afleep, they abate a little in the ftrength and quicknefs of the beating, but refume it if they obferve any appearance of his awaking. In the morning we found, that Tuttafaihie's wo- ' men relieved each other, and went to fleep by turns. In any ' other country, it would be fuppofed, that fuch a pradlice would put an end to all reft, but here it certainly adls as an opiate, and is a ftrong proof of what habit may efFe8:. ,, Captain Cooke in the fecond volume, page 63, informs us, that being by indifpofition prevented going to a marai in Attaharoo, he fent Mr. King and Omai, and returned on board his fhip at tended by Otoo's mother, his three fillers, and eight more wo men. To ufe the Captain's own words, he adds, ' at firft I - thought this numerous train of females came into my.boat with no other view than to get a pafiage to Matavia, but when they arrived at the fhip they told me they intended paffing the night tc on boards for the exprefs purpofe of undertaking the cure of ' theThe day of your arrival at Cairo you raufl determine whether or not you will vifit - the Sheik * r the diforder I complained of; whkli was a pain of the rheu- * € matic kind, extending from the hip to the foot. I accepted c&lt; the friendly offer, had a bed fpread for them upon the cabbin ' floor and fubmitted myfelf to their directions. I was deiired ' to lay myfelf down amongfl them. Then as many as could ' get round me, began io fqueeze me voiih both hands from head tt&gt; €C foot± but more particularly on the parts where the pain was tc lodged, till they made my bones craek^ and my fleih became ' a perfe£l mummy. In fhort after undergoing this difcipline aboat a quarter of an hour, I was glad to get away from them, &lt;t however the operation gave me immediate relief, which en- ** couraged me to fubmit to another rubbing down before I went 4C to'bed; and it was fo eifeilual, that I found myfelf pretty r&lt; eafy ail the night after. My female phyficians repeated their prefcriptions the next morning before they went afhore, and tc again in the evening when they returned on board, after €&lt; which I found the pain entirely removed, and the cure being- perfededj they took their leave of me the following morning. ' This they call romee ; an operation, which in my opinion far *' exceeds the flefh brufh, or any thing of the kind that we may * € ufe externally, it is univerfally pradlifed amongft the illahd- * c ers, being fometimes performed by the men, but more gen^« €C rally by the women. If at any time one appears languid ailcl ec tired, aiid iits down by any of them, they immediately begifi ** t0 pra^life the romee upon one's legs, and I have always ** found it to have an exceeding good effed, I k thefe two extrafls taken from the voyage of Captain Cdokd lately publifhed, every perfon who has been in India will recog nize in an inftant the operation of fliampoing, which, as I have alreadyC 30 ] ■ V STieick Belled, and the Bafhaw, which will I iiippofe in a great meafure depend upon their own already faid in this work*, is univerfally praftifed all over the Eaft. It is with great pleafure I avail myfelf of the tellimony of two fuch refpedable witnefTes, to Ihew the exigence of this Ciuftom, and alfo to prove its wonderful efficacy. The manner defcribed by Mr. Anderfon is pradifed in India as it is in Ton- gataboo, with this fmall difference, that the fhampoers do not ikike violently with the fills, but gently with the edge of the l^ands; nor I confefs does it appear extraordinary to me that a perfon'exhaulled with fatigue, fhould thereby be lulled to reft. It might equally be thought that noife and motion would keep children awake, but we know the reverfe to be true, for they are always fung and rocked to deep, and even fometimes for want of a cradle the nurfes flrike them gently on the back with their open hands, which produces the fame effeft. We may fuppofe the King of Tongataboo had long been ufed to this indulgences and therefore like a perfon accullomed to opiates, he required a llrong dofe; fuch a one as would difturb, and even hurt an Eu ropean. The operation defcribed by Captain Cooke is themoft common kind of fhampoing, and is that which is preferred by- Europeans in the Eall, who feldom have recourfe to any thing of that nature, excepting in cafes of exceffive fatigue, or real Jndifpofition. If it were necefTary, many perfons now in Eng-' land could vouch for the efficacy of lhampping, efpecially in re lieving rheumatic or gouty pains; but what farther teftimony 9^n be neceflary after the proof given us by a man exempt from the errors and fancies of weak minds, and whofe veracity it i» impoffible to fufpeft, PofTefTed of fuch an inconteflible proof of the fa^l, it were to be wilhed that a gentleman of Mr. Anderfon's ' ' -■ ■ ■' n — • Vide fupra. pro*[ 3 1 } V own behaviour, or rather perhaps upon the charader in which you choofe to appear. If you travel incognito there will be no occafion for you to go near them ; but in that cafe you muft fubmit to the mortification of riding about on a jack afs, as all ChrifHans do except ing thpfe who have exprefs permiffion to ufe a horfe: but as Lord A. Percy, and alfo Lord profeffional knowledge, and philofophical turn of mind, had upon the fpot afforded this matter more particular confideration : as a medical man he probably would have been able to explain in what manner the operation of fhampoing produced the won derful eifeds above defcribed ; and his remarks being introduced into a work fo univerfally read and admired, would of courfe have been no lefs univerfally known. T he philofopher who is continually in fearch of materials- for forming an ingenious' hypothecs, will naturally catch at this fimilitude of cuiloms between the natives of the iflands in the Pacific Ocean, and thofe of the great Eaftern continent, to prove that the former are certainly defcended from the latter. With out launching out into amuiing conjedlures and difquifitions, in which I have not at prefent leifure to indulge myfelf; I fhall only beg leave to obferve, that if another equipment for difco- veries fhould take plac^, this, curious point might in a great meafurebe afcertained, by fending linguifls in the fhips, who are acquainted with the Arabic, Malay, Chinefe, and Ruffian lan guages. By carefully following the courfe thefe different Ian- guages have taken, we may trace them to the various channels into which they have flowed, and confequently by this, one of the fureft guides, at length trace the people themfelves to the fountain head from whence they fprung. Charlc-[ 32 ] Char^Iemont before him were both allowed horfes, your agent no doubt will be able to pro cure you the fame indulgence j but then as I have already obferved, prefents of fome value will be neceffary both to the Sheick Belled, and the Bafliaw. We were informed it was not neceflary to vifit the Bafhaw, whofe authority in the country they told us was merely no minal ; but this to our coft I have already faid we found to be a miftake: for had we paid proper attention to him, or in other words had we waited upon him, and given him a trifling prefent; the affair of opening the pacquets would have been pafled over in filence. To guard you againft the fame inconveniences that we experienced through ignorance of the nature of the Egyptian government, I fhall attempt to give you -a general idea of it. Egypt is divided into twenty-four provinces, each of which is governed by a Sangiack or Bey: the major part of thefe twenty-four Beys re- lide at Cairo, where always once a week, and fometimes oftener they fet in council, called by them the Divan: the Sheick Belled is the pre- lident of the council, and executive member of the government ■,his office is foraewhat fimi- lar[ 33 ] far to that of 'the Doge of Venice, with rather more authority, but that indeed depends upon, a variety of circumftances, fuch as whether he is a man of great abilities and firmnefs himfelf; whether he is fupported by a large party amongft his colleagues ;and whether or not he is on good terms with the Bafhaw. When I was at Cairo the Sheick Belled was rather a weak man, and owed his fafety to the mutual jealoufy of two rival Beys nearly of equal power, who .both afpired to his place. The Ba£haw is fent from the Porte as Viceroy on the part of the Grand Signiorj if he can contrive to fow fedi- tion amongft the Beys, and fecrctly attach himfelf to the ftrongeft party, whiifl he feems to obferve a ftridl neutrality, he fometimes ac quires more influence than even the Sheick Belled himfelf; but then he muft adl with great care and circumfpedion, for fhould his intrigues be difcovered, and the adverfe party to his prevail, he certainly will be obliged to quit the country. The manner of his difmiffion is charadteriftic of the gloomy and arbitrary proceedings of this oriental republic. The Beys having come to a refolution of fending him away, difpatch a L Carra-C 34 ] Carracoulouck from the Divan or council to his houfe, who approaches the place where the Bafliaw is feated, and having filently turned up the corner of the carpet, abruptly goes away j he is however obliged to carry an order with him, which he puts into his bofom, leaving out a corner of it fo as to be plainly perceived. The name Carracoulouck. fignifies a black mef- fenger, for he is drefled in black, with a fort of bonnet on his head, of the fame colour. T he Bafhaw never pretends to oppofe this mandate or rather hint from the Divan, know ing that refiftance would very probably coft him his life. He therefore as foon as poffibk retires quietly to Boulako, fituated about two miles and a half to the weftward of Cairo; or when he fufpedts a violent degree of refentment againft him, he proceeds to Rofetto, and from thence fails in the firft veifel to Cyprus, where he remains until he hears from Conftantinople. T he Divan or council of the Beys to keep up appearances with the Porte difpatch a fpecial meffenger to Conftantinople complaining of the mifcondudl of the Bafliaw ; but the Grand Sig- uior confcious of his inability to fupport his ofEcer,[ 35 1 officer, takes no other notice ofMiis dlfniiffion, than in fending another Bafhaw to Cairo, and often itnpofing a fine on the. one who has been difgraced. Such, Sir, is the general outline this Government, and as it is impoffible for you during your {hort ftay in Egypt, to difcover the fecret intrigues of the flate, fo as to judge which party predominates, you will perhaps think it moft prudent to be equally attentive to both. On a future occafion when poflefied of full in formation, and more leifure, I fliall probably trouble you with fome further obfervations on this extraordinary government, but I fliall con clude the prefent account with a curious trait of their policy, which has no precedent that I know of in any other country whatever. T he children of the Beys cannot inherit ei ther the rank or the property of their fathers, nor even be appointed to any office which it is deemed proper for a Bey to hold. It is true the Divan after the death of a Bey, appropriates a part of his property to the maintenance of his family, but the remainder goes to his cafheef or lieutenant, who generally fucceeds both to his office and eftate. Thefe caflieefs are Georgian or CircafTian flaves, whom the Bey has bought L 2 andt 36 ] aod adopted when young, and of courfq educa ted with great care and tendernefs, with a view of leaving them grateful guardians to their or phan children. This law was doubtlefs fug- gefled to them by their diflike to monarchy and prediledion for a republic ; but furely it firft took place during the adminiftration of fome childlefs perfon, or the voice of nature would have fuppreffed the dictates of policy. The city of Cairo and its environs as you well know are full of curiofities, but nothing attradted my attention fo much as the infinite variety of people in the public ftreets, and yet I could difcover nothing like an original na tional charadler among them. The prefejnt Egyptians are an heterogeneous mixture of all nations, and having unfortunately retained only the worft features both of the minds and per- Ions of their anceftors, they are in my opinion become the moft difagreeable and contemptible nation on earth, bearing no more refemblance to the former Egyptians, than the prefent ruins do, to their once magnificent buildings. t nwob on*- qis onHitaV.s't! i 1 3fl5 1 stap V/hen you have fufficiently gratified your curiofity at Cairo you may proceed frdm thence . • i s' ;r 37 to Alexandria by land j but you will go with much greater eafe, expedition, and fafety, as far as Rofetto by water. There are two forts of boats on the Nile, the one refembling a Bengal budge- row or barge, and the other fomewhat like a Moor punkey*, but the generality of Egyptian boats are inferior to thofe of Bengal, both with refped to elegance and accomniodation. I took one at Cairo of eighteen oars, in which I arri ved at Rofetto in thirty hours, about two-thirds of the men conftantly rowing whilft the others flept: the banks of the river are covered with, well inhabited towns and villages, but as the natives of this part of the country bear not the beft of charaders, and are particularly averfe to Europeans, it will not be prudent to truft yourfelf among them. It is even thought ne- ceffary at night, to carry a light in a paper lan- thorn, under the tilt or deck of the boat, to /hew that you are Europeans, and alert j or thefe pirates will fometimes attack you in hopes of * A Bengal budgerow refembles the barges of the city com- panies ; a Moor punkcyis a long narrow boat to row with tenor twenty oars; the former is ufed for travelling up and down the great rivers in Bengal, and the provinces to the north of it 5 the latter is feldom ufed but in coming down with the current, with the affiftance of which, when the river is full,, they are fuppofed tc go at jig jate of tsn or twelve miles gn hour. plunder.I 3S I plunder. Should you come to an anchor you muft alfo be watchful that they do not fwim off irom the fhore, and pilfer fomething out of the boat, at which they are very expert. T he objections againft going all the way to Alexandria by water, is the furf at the Bogaz or mouth of the river at Rofetto, which renders this part of the voyage rather dangerous. 'It will therefore be better to go on {hore at Ro- ietto, and from thence proceed by land, the diftance is about thirty-three miles. Chriftians are allowed to make this journey upon camels or mules, and even upon horfes if they will go to the expence of hiring them. If you fet out from Rofetto about eight o'clock in the evening, you may arrive at Alexandria at day break, which in a moonlight night is the moffc agree able manner of travelling; for you would thereby avoid the heat of the fun, which in the middle of the day even in the winter feafon is very un- pleafant. I n advifing you to travel by night from Ro fetto to Alexandria, I do not mean that you fhould depart from Rofetto the night of your arrival, for if you can ftay there you will find fuffi-[ 39 J fufficient amurement for a week at leaft; n»t that Rofetto itfelf I believe abounds with anti quities, but there are many modern buildings, in and near the city very well worth feeing. It is a place much refpecfled by the Mahomedans, who fay if Mecca was to be taken from them, that the pilgrims who now go thither, would in future vifit Rafliid, i. e. Rofetto ; which opi nion is probably founded on a tradition that one of Mahomed's nearcfl relations, formerly lived, and is now buried at a mofque which is fituated at the North part of the fuburbs. The length of this city is near two miles but it is not more than half a mile broad. In the environs of it are many country houfes belonging to Chriftiaa merchants whofe gardens abound with exceed ing fine Oranges, and many of the choicefl fruits of the Eaft: but what contributes moft to make it an agreeable refidence to them, is the liberality and politenefs of the Mahomedan in habitants, who notwithftanding the reputed fandity of the place, are particularly civil to the Chriftians; whereas at Damietta, which is fituated only on the oppofite, or pelufian fide of the Delta, an European cannot appear without a certainty of being infulted. For this violent antipathy no other reafon can be afllgned, but thatC 4° ] that during the crufades confiderable detach ments of the Chriftian armies ufed to land there, and the accounts of the ravages they committed being tranfmitted to pofterity, has fixed a deep rooted refentment in the minds of the Damiet- tans, that will never be eradicated as long as thofe ftories are remembered. E uropean travellers in general complain of the ill treatment they meet with in all the countries of the Levant, but particularly when they are examining the ruins of ancient cities: the jealoufy fhewn by the Mahomedans on thefe occafions is always imputed to religious prejudices, or the want of urbanity j but I thall beg leave to account for it in another manner. I t is generally believed by them that all Europeans are deeply verfed in the abftrufe and occult fciences, which makes them confider us in the fame light, as the vulgar and ignorant in Europe confider our fortune tellers or conjurors; that is with a kind of admiration, mixed with fear, and deteftation. Added to this prejudice, they are alfo thoroughly perfuaded from the llories they daily hear repeated out of the Ara bian Nights Entertainments, that there are manymany fubterraneous palaces in their country full of pearls and diamonds, in fearch of which they fuppofe the Europeans are come to Egypt: we always acknowledge that we are looking after curiofities, which ferves to confirm them in their error j for as they have not the moft diftant idea of what we mean by curiofities, they naturally conclude we are looking for the pearls and diamonds fuppofed to be concealed in thofe fame palaces j which opinion alfo is ftrongly corroborated by the zca 1 and anxiety (hewn by our antiquarians in their refearches. As the mean heat of a country is faid to be nearly afcertained by the mean heat of the fprings j fo are the genius and character of a nation difcovered by peruiing their favorite books; for which reafon I advife you by all means to perufe thefe Arabian Nights Enter tainments before you fet out on your journey. Believe me Sir 1 they contain much curious and ufeful information. They are by many people erroneoufly fuppofed to be a fpurious produdion, and are therefore flighted in a man ner they do not deferve. Xhey were written as I have already hinted by an Arabian, and are univerfally read, and admired throughout Alia M ' byr 42 ] by all ranks of men, both old and young j coniidered therefore as an original work; defcrip- tive as they are, of the manners and cuftoms of the Eaft in general, and alfo of the genius and charadler of the Arabians in particular; they 1'urely muffc be thought to merit the attention of the curious: nor are they in my opinion entirely deftitute of merit in other refpefts, for although the extravagance of fome of the flories is carried too far, yet on the whole one cannot help admiring the fancy and invention of the author, in ftriking out fuch a variety of pleafing incidents:- pleaiing I call them, be- caufe they have frequently afforded me much amufement, nor do I envy any man his feelings., who is above being pleafed with them; but before any perfon pofitively decides upon the merit of thefe books, he (hould be eye witnefs of the effed they produce on thofe who beft underftand them. I have more than once feen the Arabians on the defert fetting round a fire liftening to thefe ftories with fuch attention and pleafure, as totally to forget the fatigue and hardfliip with which an inftant before they were entirely overcome. In fhort Sir! not to dwell any longer on this fubjeit, they are in the fame eflimation all over Afia, that the ad venturesi43 J ventures of Don Quixote are in Spain j and I am perfuaded no man of any genius or tafte, would think of making the tour of that country, without previoufly reading the works of Cer vantes. About half way between Rofetto and Alex andria you come to a place called Mad hi a, where at flood tide you mud crofs over in a ferry boat, but at the ebb you eafily pafs over on horfeback : near the ferry is a ferai or refling place where you can- fleep, but fhould it be ne- ceflary for you to pafs a night on the road, you had better go to the town of Aboukeer, which is fituated on the fea coaft, about a mile and a half to the N. W. of the ferry, for the ferai is open to the weather, and alfo extremely dirty : from Aboukeer, or the ferry, to Alexandria is about feventeen miles. With refpeft to a defcription of Alexandria and its environs, I fhall beg leave as before to refer you to Pococke, Norden and Neibuhr, &amp;c. taking the liberty however in fome few points to differ from them; and likewife to add fome obfervations that I have not met with in M 2 either[ 44 ] either of tlie abovementioned writers, concerning the prefent and alfo the former ftate of Egypt. T he Mole of about one thoufand yards in length which was built to form a communica tion with the ifland of Pharos does not appear to me to have been taken fufficient notice of by any perfon. As Alexandria was built with a view to commerce, this mole, notwithftanding fome appearances of gothic work in the arches, is probabiy coeval with the foundation of the city. Of what excellent materials then muft it have been originally compofed to have refiiled the beating of the wind and waves for near two thoufand years! Dr. Pococke with great reafon admires the arched cifterns under the houfes for the reception of the water of the Nile, of which however there arc not more than five or fix re maining at this time; but in my opinion the fame labour and expence would have been bet ter beftowed in lining the canal from the Nile to Alexandria, with the fame durable materials as thofe of the Mole; by means of which the city to the endof time would have been amply fupplied tvith water; and goods with great eafe have been tranfported to it, from all parts of Egypt. For want of being lined the banks of the Califch orC 45 1 or canal are now fallen in, which is one of the principal caufes of the decline of the trade, and of courfe of the ruin of the city. * ... . . _ . *■ \ It has long been a favourite opinion amongft the learned, both ancients and moderns, that the Egyptians were acquainted with the arts and fciences, when all the other people were in a ftate of ignorance. We are told they difcovered geometry in making the divifions of land, after the annual overflowing of the Nile j that the clearnefs of their atmofphere enabled them to make aftronomical obfervations fooner than other people; and that the fertility of their country gave rife to trade, by enabling them to fupply all their neighbours with corn and other neceffaries of life. Thefe arguments are how ever more fpecious than true, for if we owe the difcovery of geometry to the overflowing of the Nile, of aftronomy to the clearnefs of the at- mofphere, and of trade to the fertility of the foil j in that part of Hindoftan which is within the tropic, there are flill larger rivers which overflow annually, a clearer and a more fertile foil. The Nile only once a year affords a fupply of water to the countries on its banks, and the fmali quantity of rain that falls there at other[ 46 ] other times, does not furnifh moiflure enough to keep up the fmalleft degree of vegetation. Whereas the rivers in Hindoftan, particularly thofe on the coaft of Choromandel, are regu larly filled with water twice a year, firft from 1 the rains which fall in June, July and Auguft, in the Balagat mountains, where the fources of thofe rivers lie; and afterwards from the N. E. monfoon or rainy feafon, which continues on the Choromandel coaft during the months of October, November, and December. With refped: to the goodnefs of the climate, or the clearnefs of the atmofphere for the purpofes of afironomy, there can be no comparifon between Egypt and Hindoftan; for at night during the greater part of the year in Hindoftan there is fcarcely a cloud to be feen in the and the air efpecially in the fouthern countries is never difagreeably cold j fo that an aftronomer would have every opportunity and inducement to pur- fue his ftudies in the open air: whereas, in Egypt the Iky is often cloudy, and the air fo cold as to make it unpleafant fo be out of doors after fun-fet. T he Indians had alfo evidently the advantage ©f the Egyptians with rcfpedl to cloathing, which[ 47 } •which is one of the necefTaries, or at leaft one of the comforts of life ;for if we fuppofe men firft cloathed themfelves in the fkins of animals, India abounds in vaft forefts or extenfive fertile plains, where animals of all kind both favage and tame, muft have bred infinitely fafter than in the barren deferts of upper Egypt,; but in a hot country the natives would naturally prefer garments made of woven cotton. Now, the cotton fhrub is very rare in Egypt, even at this time, and it is well known to have grown in India, and to have been fabricated into cloth, ever fince we have had any acquaintance with that country. From thefe premifes, therefore, it is natural to fup-poie, that the Indians in the early ages were much more likely to fupply the Egyptians with neceffaries and comforts of life, than to be fupplied by them ; that the Indians would at leaft have as- much occalion for geo metry as the Egyptians^ and that they had at leaft equal if not greater advantages for purfu- ing the ftudy of aftronomy. Thus far however all is but conjedlure, for we have no tradition or hillory of thofe times, when either the Egyptians or the Indians were in an uncivilized flate; but if we purfpe the fubjed we {hall find very evident proofs that when an intercourfer 48 j did take place between them; that the Egyp* tians received from Hindoftan all thofe articles of luxury, which the Greeks and Romans pur- chafed again from them. It would be both tedious and unnecelfary to enumerate all thefe, I {hall therefore content myfelf with particu larizing filk, fpices, pearls, diamonds, and other precious ftones. It was formerly fuppofed that moft of thefe articles came from Arabia Felix, but this error has long (ince been exploded. It is now well known they were none of them the produce of Arabia, but were brought thither by velfels from India, and from thence were carried up the Red Sea, with other produdions of that country. It may perhaps be objedred, that the Egyp tians and the Arabians are generally fuppofed to have known the art of navigation before the Indians, and of courfe that although India may produce fpices. See. the Egyptians and Arabians went thither to fetch them. Hillory being entirely filent on this fubjedt we can only en deavour to afcertain this matter, by ftating the arguments on bothlides the queftion.[ 49 1 I n all probability before any intercourfe fub- filled between the Indians and Egyptians, both people knew how to conffcrud fmall boats of rather rafts for croffing deep rivers, and even for tranfporting themfelves by water from one place to another in the fame country ; but at the fame time it muft be allowed that the Indians had much better materials for building both fmall and large boats than either the Egyptians, or even the Arabians and the boats of the prefent day plainly fliew in what man ner the Indians made ufe of thefe materials. The planks are made of a light boyant pliant wood, fewed together with coir or the rind of the cocoa nut made into a kind of fmall cord j all the larger ropes are made of the fame ma terials, and even the oars themfelves are formed of one ftrait pole with a piece of flat board tied upon it with a coir ftring to form the blade of the oar. The prefent large country boats of forty and fifty tons, efpeciailly thofe belonging to the Lacidivi and Maldivi iflands are fHll built in the fame manner, with no other differ ence than being on a larger fcale: with thefe in a fair feafon they make voyages many degrees out of fight of land j yet nothing of the kind not even the iirft eflays of the art could have N bcca[ 5® 1 been more rude than thefe now are. It is highly probable therefore, that as foon as they knew the latitude of the Freights of Babel- mandel, and were furniflied with inftruments for making obfervations, they ventured to pafs over from the Malabar coafl to that of Arabia. I may perhaps be afked when and how it was they became acquainted with the latitude of thefe ftreights ? that is a difficulty I believe no perfon can folve any more than myfelf, but it is poffible that there was once a chain of itfands nearly in fight of each other, from the Malabar coaft to that of Arabia, moft of which may have been fwallowed up in fome great con- vulfion of nature, fo as to leave no remains ex cepting the ifland of Socotra and thofe of La- cidivi and Maldivi: but even fuppofing no fuch iflandsto haveexifted, ftill furely as the Indians had good materials for building veffels, and a fea to fail upon that is governed by regular currents and periodical winds, neither of which the Egyptians had j we may rather fuppofe that the produce of Hindoftan was carried to Egypt by the Indians, than that it was fetched away from thence by the Egyptians. If[ 5 1 1 - 4 . * ' \ If the Indians required nothing from the Egyptians either of the neceffaries or comforts of life iif the Egyptians got fpices and other articles of luxury from India; and if the na tives of India were firft acquainted with the fcience of aftronomy and the arts of navigation, all of which I think are probable: it is but reafonable to fuppofe that the arts and fciences were firft known in India, and from thence were brought up the Red Sea to Egypt, I am well aware that the advocates for ■ / . Egypt will call upon me to produce any re- -mains of antiquity in India fo ancient as the Pyramids. To thefe gentlemen I fhall oppofe one impoffibility to another, by afldng them to trace back the building of Gour, which feven hundred and thirty years before Chrift was the capital of Bengal; or of the better known Pali- bothra of the ancients, which was the capital of India, long before Alexander's time. As a further proof that the natives of Hindoftan were in an advanced ftate of civilization near two thoufand years ago, I fhall alfo beg leave to obferve that a plate of copper was lately dug up at Mpngheer, engraved with Shanfcrit cha- .racters which contains a conveyance or grant of v N 2 landr s* i land from Bickeram Geet Raja of Bengal to o«d of his fubjeds, and dated near one hundred years before the Chriftian aera. To enter into' a long detail of reafoning upon this plate can not be neceffary} I am perfuaded Sir, you will in an inftant conceive how long the arts and fciences muft have been known in Hindoftan, before thefe regular divifions of land took place, and the grants of them were engraved on cop per in fuch characters as would not difgrace our inoft Ikilful artifts even at this time. The ingenious Mr. Halhed in the preface of his Bengal grammar, informs us that the Raja of Kiihnagur, who he fays, is by far the moft learned and able antiquary, that Bengal has pro duced within this century, pofitively affirms that he has in his own pofleffion Shanfcrit books, which give an account of a communi cation formerly fubfifling between India and Egypt, wherein the Egyptians are conftantljr defcribed as difciples, and not as inftruAors of the Indians }and as feeking that liberal educa tion, and thofe fciences in Hindoflan, which none of their own countrymen had fufficient knowledge to impart. This evidence of the learned Raja has great weight with me, efpe- ^ /r &lt; ciallyt 53 ] daily as there are books now extant m Bengal, written in the Shanfcrit language, which are copies of others faid by the Bramins to be dated more than two thoufand two hundred years be fore the Chriftian sera. This fad: admitted, and I firmly believe it very poffible to be proved, the Egyptians muft appear a modern people in comparifon with the natives of Hindoftan j for when the former were advanced no further in literature, than the conftruding of hiefogly- phicks, the latter were mafters of books writ ten in a language which had then attained a great degree of perfection. B ut this is not all that may be urged in fa vour of the claims of the Indians, fome further proofs will appear upon examining the general ftaW-of commerce at that time all over the globe. In Europe it was very trifling, of America wc were totally ignorant j and only a corner of Af rica was known ; confequently whatever com merce then exifted muft have come from Afia. About this time there was a chain, or if I may be allowed the expreffion, a ftreet of magnificent cities from Coptos to Alexandria, which con tinued in a flourilhing ft ate, notwithftanding the Egyptian empire frequently changed its M ry Sove-[ 54 ] Sovereign. Nor from any information I am mafter of, can I find thofe cities began to de cline until the followers of Mahomed transfer red the India trade from upper Egypt to the oppofite coaft of the Red Sea; then, and not before. Upper Egy^)t became what itftill conti nues to be, an uninhabited defert. If thefe fa£b be true, and I believe they will not be difputedj we may reafonably infer from them, that thefe cities of Upper Egypt not only exift- ed by the fupport they derived from that trade ; but alfo that they owed their original exiftence to it. Nor is it Egypt only that has experienced thefe effects of the India trade j whatever nation has pofTeffed the largeft fhare of it, has invari ably for the time enjoyed alfo the largeft portion of wealth and power j and when deprived of it, funk again almoft into their original obfeurity. When the folly of the crufades was over, and the remembrance of the injuries fuftained on both fides in fome meafure mutually forgotten? the Mahomedans intent only on conqueft and ipreading the dodtrines of their prophet, allow ed the Chriftians to carry on the trade between Europe and the Levant, which confifted prin cipally in tranfporting the India goods from the portsC 55 1 ports of Syria, Paleftine, and Egypt, to thofe of Italy. It is well known that the Venetians for a long time engroffed the greater part of this trade, and whilft they enjoyed it were the richeft andmoft powerful people in Europe j we may alfo trace it from Venice to the Hans towns by the cities to which it gave rife in Germany. But at length the Portugueze difcovered the paflage mund the Cape of Good Hope, which carried a part of the India trade into another channelj immediately Venice declined, and Portugal became one of the greateft nations in Europe. They however enjoyed their fuperi- ority but a fhort time, for the enterprizing and induftrious natives of Holland found their way round the Cape of Good Hope, and very foon eftabliflied themfelves in India on the ruin of the Portugueze. Whilft the riches of India flowed into Holland, the Dutch difputed the empire of thefeas with the united fleets of Eng land and France. At laft we obtained a larger portion of this trade than ever was enjoyed by any nation whatever, excepting the Egyptians, and every pej-fon knows at that period Great Britain gave law to all Europe. Nor does it require the gift of prophecy to be able to fore tell, that deprived of this fource of wealth we fhallC 56 ] fhall fink almoft as low in the political fcale of Europe, as either Holland, Portugal, Venice, or even Egypt itfelf. In fhort, to futn up the whole of this argument in a few words. If the arts and fciences conducted by commerce can be traced back from the weft of Europe to Italy, from thence to Greece, and fo on eaft- ward to Egypt: if India pofleffed many natural advantages over Egypt for the produdion of every article of trade, and alfo for the difcovery and improvement of every branch of the ma thematics : and above all, if we have every Teafon to fuppofe that the Shanfcrit or original Indian language had acquired a great degree of perfedion, and was written with great regula rity, when the Egyptians were only acquainted with the hieroglyphicks: it is but reafonable to conclude, that the arts and fciences came by the means of commerce from India to Egypt, in the lamemanner, as they afterwards came from Egypt to Europe. From the weft part of Europe they have pafled over to America, where probably they will ftill continue to purfue the fame courfc, until they have finiftied their circuit round the globe, by opening a communication between the two great continents from the weft of Ame rica, to the Eaft coafts of Aiia. The further - con*.I [ 57 3 coniideration of this fubjeit would lead me into a long train of political reflections, I fliall there fore quit it, pid return to what relates to Egypt- s a There are great difputes amongft the mo derns concerning the exadt fituation of the ancient city of Berenice, on the weft coaft of the Red Sea; and alfo whether or not, there was a navigable canal between that city and Coptos, on the banks of the Nile. If you have leifure to go into Upper Egypt,, or can land at Cofire, you perhaps will be glad to know what has been already faid on this fubjedr, and alfo to receive any information I can afford you, concerning that or any other navigable canal between the Red Sea and the Nile. ' r v' ' ' ■ ■ * r* , % Both ancient and modern geographers de- fcribe the remains of a canal from Suez, to a fmall lake of brackifh water about thirty miles to the north of that place j and from thence tp a canal faid to have been dug by the order of the J2mperor Trajan, which goes from that lake into the Nile a few miles below the city of Cairo: for my own part, I muft acknowledge, Z faw nothing like a canal near Suez, excepting O a fmail[ ^ ] a fmall water courfe, many of which are to be feen both in the great and little defert. With refpedl to that faid to have been cut between Berenice and Coptos in the latitude of twenty- fix in Upper Egypt, I think there is reafon to doubt its exiftence. Mr. D'Anville feems to think that a road only was made from the Nile to the Red Sea, and that the miftake arofe from there being a navigable canal between Coptos and the Nile, from which it was diftant only feven miles. But this great geographer not having entered fo minutely into this fubjedt, as perhaps you may think it deferves j I fhall offer a few words to your conlideration in confirma tion of his opinion. Those writers who have placed a navigable canal, or a road between the Nile and the Red Sea ■from modern Ghinna to Cofirej have probably guelTed that it muft have been in that fituation,' becaufe it is the fhorteft diftance from the fea ■ to the river, being in a ftrait line at moft one hundred and twenty miles. But admitting any fuch canal to have exifted in Upper Egypt, of which there are no traces to be found j it is not very likely it fhould be cut in that diredion for Cofire being almoft three degrees beyond the Tropic,f 59 ] Tropic, the voyage from the Tropic to Cofire,, would to the ancients in their ill-conftruded veflels have been practicable during only the continuance of the Khumfeen wind, which as I have before obferved blows for about fifty days in the year : furely then had the Egyptians attempted to make fuch a navigable canal, they would have made it further to the foutliward, near the Tropic, where it would have been fer- viceablc to them for fix months in the year; that is, fomewhere near to the fpot where Ptole my andothers have placed the ancient city of Bere nice, Dr. Pococke, who does not feem to have ad verted to this circumftance of the N. W. wind prevailing fo long below Cofirej thinks that Ptolemy is miftaken in his latitude of Berenice, becaufe Strabo who had vifited Upper Egypt, places Berenice near Coptos; the word near however being only a relative term, may equally mean one hundred, or two hundred and fifty- eight miles iand therefore cannot be deemed any proof that Berenice fhould have been exa&lt;3&gt; ly in the fame parallel of latitude with Goptos. The fituation of Coptos is not difputedj and as Ptolemy, and many of the moft refpedable geographers have made the diftance from thence to Berenice near two hundred and fifty-eight O - miles.[ 60 ] miles, mo ft perfons perhaps, will be of opinion that Berenice was fituated in what is called Foul Bay, to the fouthward of Cape Nofe, and with* in a few miles of the Tropic. Ptolemy Phila- delphus made a road from the one city to the Other, in which he caufed wells to be dug, and what would now in the Eaft be called Caravan- faries to be ereded; but of which I have been informed no veftiges are now vifible. This road has alio by fome people been miftaken for a canal, but I {hall offer fome objedtions to your Confideration againft the probability of any ca nal having been made between this part of the ]Nile, and the Red Sea. T he canal muft have been fupplied with wa ter either from the river, or from the fea. If from the river, fuch a difcharge from that body of water mufl: even in the beft feafon have de prived Lower Egypt of too large a quantity of this only fource of its fertility: and in a dry feafon, which happens at leaft every fourth or iifth year, muft have occalioned a famine; for as I have before mentioned the rain never falls there, in fufficient abundance to keep up the fmalleft degree of vegetation. I fi t 6 « ] 'j 5 ''' 0 ' I f the canal was to be fupplied with water from the Red Sea, an extraordinary Spring tide, 11 Wlt ' 1, or a ftorm might have broken down the locks, ^Phila. anc l thereby overflowed Lower Egypt, fo as to 'Jtotln render it a mere falt-water lake: but at leafi: the mixture of the fait with the frefli water Caravan. would have made it unfit for the purpofes of w beei hulbandry, and befides the major part of the TWsroai inhabitants have no othelr frefh water than for i what comes from the Nile. If then the Egyp- tians could not cut a canal without ruining ofaniffl. their country, or depriving themfelves of a re- part of 4 quifite fupply of water for domeftic ufes, we may reafonably conclude they never would have made the attempt and thereby expatriated jpjlJuyj, themfelves. Thus Sir! having made all the efea. II obfervations on Egypt that occur to me, or at tbatbodf leaft fuch as will come within the narrow com- taefc P a ^ s a ^ etter j I ftiall next confider what meafures you muft take to proceed from Alex- adin^! andria t0 Euro P e - T HE t ' me an ^ manner of your departure from Alexandria muft entirely depend upon the plan 11 j| which you have laid down j that is, whether you intend to go diredlly to England or whether ) you propofe to travel leifurely; and make a tour of \t b2 of pleafure: You will hardly think of going to Europe all the way by land through Paleftine, Syria, Afia Minor, &amp;c. I fliall therefore men tion what fteps you are to take in going by fea. \ Your agent will eafily procure you a veflel on freight to carry you to any of the ports in Europe, which you may have on reafonable terms if you will allow them alfo to put a cargo on board j and it will be no inconvenience to you, provided you fpecify the particular port to which you are bound; and the veffel is afterwards put under your orders. Of all the nations that frequent this port, I (hould advife you to employ Ragulians. Their veflels are ftrong and well-found j their feamen arefober, cleanly, and civil; and their republic- is generally at peace with all the different flates of Barbary. Next to thefe in time of peace, I fhould prefer the French, who carry on aconfi- derable trade here, and employ in it very large fliips; there are but very few Englifla velfels, and thefe are generally fmall and in bad condi tion. I f[ 63 ] I f you are in hafte to get home, it is befl to freight the fhip for two months to carry you to any port in the Adriatic or the Mediterranean, and then it will be in your own power to choofe one of thofe places where the quarantine is fhort, viz. Malta, Marfeilles, Ragufa, orTriefte: at all thefe ports with a pattenta netta, or clean bill of health, the confinement is only eighteen days, i would advife you to fleer for Malta; but if thevvind comes to the we ft ward after you have paffed Candia, and before you fee Malta, you fhould then attempt to pafs by the Pharo Meffina in the way to Marleilles, or elfe to enter the Adriatic and fail for Triefte. When you are advanced up the Adriatic, fhould the wind come round to the N. W. th,e port of Ragufa will be under your lee from whence after performing quarantine, you may land in any part of Italy. Before you embark at Alex andria, the Conful who ads as your agent, at the fame time he difpatches the fhip, gives you a feparate certificate or bill of health for your- felf. If you propofe making a voyage of plea- fure without being reftridted in time, and can depart from Alexandria in the month of Fe bruary, you will of courfe firft vifit the Archi pelago; where in the different iilands you will find[ 64 ] find an inexhaufllble fund of amufement. It will be very eafy in the courfe of four months to go to Conftantinople, calling in the way at all the places on the Eaft fide of the Archipe lago that are worth feeing; and afterwards when you are going to Italy, to vifit thofe on the Weft. I am extremely forry it is not at prefent in my power to give you a particular defcrip- tion of all thefe iflands, but at Alexandria you will eafily obtain every kind of information concerning them that you can require. In your return from Conftantinople, after paffing the N. W. end of Candia, if you will wiih to fee the South part of Italy, and the ifland of Sicily, it will be necelfary for you to perform your quarantine at Malta; but as the Sicilians fuffer- cd dreadfully from the plague in the year 1743, I am not certain that you can go from Malta to any part of that ifland, without being de tained fome days on board the fhip. At Mef- fina where the plague raged with its greateft violence, they often impofe a quarantine of feven days, even on thofe who come from the oppofite coaft of Calabria j but .the Neapolitans are not fo fcrupulous, therefore having got Pra tique from Malta you may land in that city. T he[ % ] T he time fpent in vifiting Conftantlnople and the iflands in the Archipelago, and alfo in performing quarantine, will bring you to Na ples in July or Auguft, which indeed is not the mo ft favorable feafonj but that cannot be avoided, unlcfs you prolong your ftay at Con- ftantinople or the illands, fo as to arrive at Na ples in September or Odober, which is exadly the plan I fhould moft recommend, for by this little delay, you will have full time to examine countries, which are in the higheft degree wor thy of your attention : you will be able to pafs the winter moft agreeably at Naples and you will have all the following fpring and fummer for your journey through Italy and France to England j the warmth of the fun increafing, as you advance towards the North, And now Sir! having condudled you to the continent of Europe, I fhall beg leave to con clude ;not however without alTuring you that if neceifary, I fhall be happy to afford you any fur ther information in my power, and alfo that I am. S I Fort S Nsv, PJOURNEY / . FROM CONSTANTINOPLE to VIENNA, b y G eorge B aldwin, Efq; ■r*' W -i ' ' ' ! • ' I k '■ ■ A / ' We hired a coach, an old caft-off fiacre, to carry us from Conftantinople to Vienna, with four horfes to draw it j two horfes to carry our ^ a gg a g e » a janizary to protedt us, and a ferugee or pofl-boy to condudt us. We began the jour ney on the 28th of September, 1780, upon a Thurfday, from Mr. Willis's houfe in the village of Belgrade; Mr. Willis and his brother Stuart accompanying us part of the way. In eight hours we arrived at ponte Picolo or Cutchuk Chickmagee, and were joined by Dr. Lucci; P 2 1 w®[68 ] V We lodged in a new conak pretty well accom modated ; in fadt our bed furniture we carried with us, and it confined of nothing but a car pet, two fmall fquare cufhions to fet on, and two cufhions to lean or lay our heads on, as our inclination might prompt, and a quilt to cover us. On Friday the 29th of September in the morning we departed; all the way on our journey the fame objeds were varied by different afpedts ;the country hilly on the right, and on our left, the Tea. In three hours we arrived at Buyuk Chikmagee or ponte grande, a much plea- fanter fituation than ponte Picolo. Breakfafted, and in five hours more got to Silivria, this town which is confiderable, is fituated on the decli- % vity and fummit of a hill, has five mofques, and an ancient Greek church with infcriptions, which the Prieft could not interpret. We re mained here till Saturday morning eight o'clock (30th September) when our friends left us. This feparation did not a little difturb us j Mrs. B who for the firft time in her life now found herfelf bereaved of all her acquaintance but myfelf, and juft leaving thofe fhe had great reafon to efteem, was totally overwhelmed. The very fine country we palfed had no attrac tions for her, and gloomy and fad we went throughi V [ e? 1 tlirough this day's journey, a feven hours march to Chio Oglu. In this flate of mind we took up our lodging at a fpacious and once magnifi- '' a!1( i cent conak, when an occurrence happened that 0I1 i as excited our curiofity, a paffion that is not to be uiltto ftifled by affliction. The Devan EfFendi of 'feii Wallachia made his appearance with a fuit of a 'lout dozen carriages, and a long cavalcade of more foeni than an hundred horfes. He is an officer ap- indon pointed by the Porte to co-officiate with the nuiit prince of Wallachia in caufes wherein Turks idipb and fubjeds are concerned ; the fupreme power aifaiti, being veiled in the prince, who is a Greek, and listoi appointed by the Porte. This and the princi- :M pality of Moldavia are the only veftiges I know ofqueti of the ancient Greek dominions; the Greek ptions, language is fpoken at court, and all the inftru- ^ efe . ments of government are drawn up in that lan- oclocl guage. On the road from this place, whence [eh us, we departed at five o'clock (ifl Odober) Sun- u- Mi day n:)0rnin g&gt; we met a much more confiderable lifei train attending the fifter of the reigning prin- ccfsof Wallacll i a . and related to the druggaman L [tl t of the Porte. This dignity fo founding is but ieW of a P recarious tenure, fince the Porte have upon a ^ ate occafion affumed and exercifed the unex- 0 ^ ■? j ^ii! anipled prerogative of depofmg and beheading theT 7° 1 the prince. The country is hilly, and well id- terfperfed with villages and trees, the road good; we loft fight of the fea on the preceding day. In ten hours we arrived at Burgas, a large vil lage with a confiderable mofque in it j as yet no ficknefs on the way, but we heard reports of the plague raging at Adrianople. The people were colledted at the entrance of the town, with tents pitched and mufic playing, to cele brate their feftival of Bairam with dancing and fongs. The Turks faft during the whole moon of Ramazan, by a ftrifl abftinence from meat or drink, or any thing fenfual, from fun-rife to fun-fet; but many of them indulge in pleafures during the night. At the end of the Ramazan, or rather upon the appearance of the new moon of Bairam, they celebrate a feftival of three days, cloathing themfelves entirely new, and giving into every amufement that a people cha- raderized for temperance and fobriety may be fuppofed to indulge in. We refted at this conak till five next morn ing (2d October) and then purfued our journey. The road is very good and pleafant, but hilly j on the way for hours together, to the right and left, we faw fwarms of Locufts, myriads j the atmof-r 71 ] atmofphere was darkened with them it was their coupling time. The male was diflinguiflr- able, being of a fine yellow colour, and the fe male of a dark brown. This may be confidered as their laft ftage, they take flight, and falling in their paffage, they depofit their eggs half an inch in the ground, and die. The invincible fuperftition of the Turks in all their metaphyfi- cal tenets, makes them as blind in their tole rance of this evil, which they could eafily pre vent ; as they are in neglecting every precaution againft the effeds of the plague; but they fay, *'What God has decreed, mufl be fulfilled.' I We arrived at Affsa at four o'clock in the even ing, a village only four hours diftant from Ad- rianople, or Aderne, as the Turks now call it. No plague here, and from the information our janizary brought us, it had ceafed at Adriano- ple. Our room was fmall and low, and part of one fide of an old fquare building, having a gallery within, tumbling almofl: in its laft ftage of ruin. A mofque Hands in the center of the yard, and near it is a bafon of water furrounded by fome trees, it was juft enough to keep us from the fpleen. As we did not credit the laft accounts we had heard of the plague having ceafed at Adrianople, we confequendy deter mined[ 7 2 I mined not to go near it. On Tuefday morning therefore {3d Odtober) at fun-rife, taking our departure, we made a tour to a ferry below the city, and in an hour and a half arrived at Car'a- gatch, the fummer retreat of the French mer chants eftablifhed at Adrianople. We were feen as we entered the village by a Monf. Terraffon, and conducted by him to his own houfe, the abode of genuine indifcriminate hofpitality, even to ftrangers, and thofe of a country hoftile to his own. The condition of one of our horfes made it neceffary that we lliould get another, and retarded us- in this place all that day, and the next. We were vifited by Monf. Meynard, his mother, fifter, and brother, who expreffed themfelves concerned that we had not fallen to their lot ;but they made us all dine with them on Wednefday. Monf. D'Argus alfo would have vied with his compatriots, if time and his own misfortunes had not made it impoffible; enfin, cetoit la benediSiion They were as happy as they made us, and I never was more fo in my life. We were near the plain of Demftica, and the village ofDemirba£b, renowned in the hiftory of Charles XII. of Sweden. We walked over this theatre of his r extravagant exploits with a kind of reverential delight.[ 73 ] delight: now a fcene of paftoral tranquillity, fcarcely inhabited, and but little heeded. Returning to the village with our amiable party, we were curious to know the nature and objedl of their fettlement at Adrianople. Trade I know to be their purfuit, but we enquired after its foundation and refources. They fup- ply the city and its environs with the various produce of Europe, which is conveyed to them from Conftantinople; either diredly by land, or from Rhadofto, whither it is conveyed by boats ;and from Smyrna by the port of Envi, in the Egean fea, and thence up the river Ma- rizza to Adrianople. Their confumption is confiderable, and in return one of their greateft articles of exportation is hare Ikins, which they buy as a fubftitute for the Canadian beaver; and fend to the number of between three and four hundred thoufand annually to France. I wasaf- tonifhed at this furprizing nurfery of hares, but the account is certainly founded in truth. Bred in Wallachia and the intermediate tradl of land, ibli are ^' ven large parties by the feverity I d winter, down to the plains; the fnow 0 with which the ground is covered betrays their haunts f{ 74 ] haunts to the hunter, and thus they are eafily enfnared. W e had a view of the city of Adrianople, in which there appears fome magnificent mofques and other public buildings. It extends a con- fiderable way along the river Marizza, juft af ter it has been joined by the Arfa and Tunja, and from thence rifing in a gradual afcent, the greateft part of the city ia feen on an elevation, which irapreffes a very advantageous idea of its beauty and importance upon the traveller's mind. The plague was preying at that very time upon the lives of its inhabitants, and for bad our ,nearer approach. Notwithflanding we did not go thither ourfelves, we were not free from very well founded apprehenfions of the danger we intended to avoid for our con- dudlors had been into the city, and in company with the people of it j they had been cautious they faid, but our reliance was in the mercy of Providence. ( ' , ' As we came to a crofs road in the flcirts of the city on our way from Affsa, we faw upon an eminence a man eredt upon a ftake, at the height of three feet at leaft from the ground; he[ 75 ] he had been impaled, and was placed there in terrorem to others. It is not a very unufual fight in the do-minions of the Turks. On Thurfday, the 5th of Ocflober, we took cur leave of Carragatch, but our French friends would attend us part of the way ; they muffc fee us acrofs a river we had to ford at a danger ous place j we knew nothing of the river, and therefore a cart upon much higher wheels than our coach being about to pafs, we got into it, and took our baggage with us leaving the coach to follow. We got over dry and fafe, but our coach was nearly loft. Our friends fwarm their horfes over with us, and after that inllance of their very cordial attention, and po liteness ; bid us adieu, and returned. We ftaid to fee them fafe on the other /hore again ; made ligns of our fatisfadion and gratitude, and went heavily on. We forded and were ferried fevq- ral different times in this day's march, which lafted eight hours over a beautiful country, and at length brought us to a Bulgarian village called Hebibchay. We had been joined at Carragatch by two Greek priefls who begged the favour of our protection on their journey to Belgrade, to which we had no obje&amp;iqn. We ' Q2 - reftedI [ 76 ] refted In a Chriftian's hut, nothing more than mud walls four feet from the ground, and thatched. We flept here, for the firft time, on the ground j that is, on our carpet fpread upon the ground. The language of thefe peo ple is the Bulgar, fomething of the Illyric. We could not underftand it, all our entertain ment therefore was derived from our fight; the women appear hardy, and do not conceal themfelves. We made a good fire in our hut, forgot the humility of our lot, and in defiance of vermin, paffed the night in fome degree of comfort. r\ v . ' ' ' ' / On Friday at fun-rife (6th October) we left this place, and paffing over a very fine hilly country in fight of the river, in eight hours we arrived at Armanak, where a magnificent khan was originally built for the accommodation of the troops, and now affording a»fhelter for tra vellers. We however, after a flight repofe, continued on to Semiky, a Bulgarian town, which we reached at fun-fet. The women- flocked to fee Mrs. B , and viewing her with a great deal of aftoniftiment, I afked one of them what was the reafon of their wonder ? flae anfwered, to fee a woman who had never done[ 77 3 done work. There was fo much fimplicity and fo much ignorance of a flate of refinement in this anfwer, as to difpofe us to bear with their importunities. The Bulgarian families in termarry, unite, and make common caufe. The cuftom is for the hufband to live in the paternal houfe of his wife, and their numbers accumulate in fome families beyond credibility. We bought a fucking pig for twenty paras, or one (hilling j and one of our facerdotal com panions undertook to drefs it, as he did alfo to interpret for us, in which we were fometimes at a lofs. We had not difcovered all his merit till this day, perhaps not all then. Our bed was again upon the ground. On Saturday morning at fun-rife (7th Ofto- ber) we renewed our journey, and pafiing by fome villages and over a fine country, arrived at four in the evening, at Papafquoi. This village is fituated in the plain of Philipopoli (by the Turks called Phillibey) near a fmall ftream, which makes it pleafant. Our nodlur- nal accommodation as ufual; but the vermin rather more importunate; fatigue however is an irrefiftable opiate, and we got a proper por tion of fleep. O n[ 78 1 On Sunday at fun-rife (8th Odlober) we re newed our march for Philipopoli; in half an hour we came in fight of the city, it being fituated on- a rock leading to it over a plain, the river Marizza meandering by it, and fer tilizing and beautifying the country in its way. Rice grows in great abundance in this plain, and good in quality. There were numbers of waggons going to and fro upon the various roads in the plain j and gave figns of an adivity, and induftry, which is very unufual in the other parts of the Turkifh dominions. The fadt is, a confiderable iron mine in the neighbourhood, gives employment to all thefe convoys of wag gons, and the character and conftitution of the people is more fuitable to commerce, than in the province we were leaving behind us. We entered Philipopoli at eleven o'clock, and had to afcend a very narrow and fteep road to the refidence of Sig. Demetrio Khiro, a Greek, with whom we took the liberty to fojourn. This gentleman is a Raija, or Chrillian tributary of the Grand Signior, but proteifled by a barat, or privilege of exemption, allowed to the Am- balfadors of the Porte. Every Ambaffador is complimented with the privilege of giving pro-- tedions to the number of thirty-two as fervants, but[ 79 ] ( but they are fometimes fold to the rich Raijas for confiderable fums. Signor Khiros's houle is fpacious, very pleafantly fituated upon the fumm.it of the rock, and commanding a beau tiful view of the plain beneath, watered by three rivers, the Arta, Tunja, and Marizza, juft as they are approaching to a jundrion in the vicinity of Adrianople. Our hoft himfelf was a confiderable trader in red cotton yarn, which he fends in large quantities to Ruffia, in lefler to Germany. There is alfo a large confump- tion here of India piece goods, fupplied by the company of Armenians, at Conftantinople; nor are thefe the only confiderable objedls of fpeculation. We tarried all this day Monday the 9th of Odober, and on Tuefday the 10th, at eight o'clock in the morning we refumed our journey. One of the hind wheels of our coach had been newly hooped, and other reparations made foas to give us greater confidence in our vehicle we began to defcend the rock. In iffuingfrom the town, we immediately found ourfelves on a very long bridge over the Marizza, which having paffed, our way lay between fields of rice, juft gathering and treading out. In fix hours N t[ 8° ] hours we arrived at Bazarjeek, a large town oo the plain confpicuous by reafon of its mofques and gilded domes, and admirable for the beau ty of its fituation. We were lodged in the bifhop's palace, and from a * Kioik to the weftward, commanded the fineft view of a cam- pania without exception in my knowledge, that this country affords. Ciofe under our window ran a gentle flream, and further on united with the main body of the river. Near the jundtion is a wooden bridge, enlivened by a conftant con- courfe of people on foot or on horfe back, and . with carriages, inceffantly paffing and repalling. The view extends over this plain or rather beau tiful lawn, which is pleafingly interfperfed with clumps of trees, to. the foot of the Balkan mountain j thence gradually afcending, and dif- playing a diverlified fcene of ruftic art and na ture, ftill enchanting to the very top. Near this town is the mine of iron I have fpoken of, which is faid to be very produdlive. It is open to the induftry of every adventurer, the fultan takes no heed of it ;why he permits others to work it, is a myftery to thofe who know the principles of his government not to be explained but cer-[ 8i ] tain it is any one may enjoy the fruits of it. On Wednefday morning (nth Odlober) at fun- rife we left this town, but the fame fcene was before us, we proceeded along the plain, draw ing gradually to a Cul de Sac, and in two hours came to rifing grounds, conftantly increaling in acclivity towards the fummit, and near the top growing extremely difficult and fteep. At four in the evening, without any accident, we reached Palanka, a Turkifli village of three houfes, on the fummit of the Balkan, and took our ftation for the night. Our beft choice was the common ftable, and very calmly and con tentedly we took up with it; fpread our carpet, and patiently fubmitted to this hard, but fome- times neceflary lot of travellers. Before night came on however, we amufed ourfelves with walking about the hills; obferved fome veftiges of an ancient tower, colledled fome wood for kindling a fire, and when tired withdrew to reft. We got over the apparent hardftiips of our fituation, and at fun-rife were well recruit ed for profecuting our next day's adventures. Thurfday the 12th Odober, we fet off to com- pleat our paflage over the mountain, leaving a horfe behind, worn out with toil. This Bal- r . \ kan, which I have heard fo often talked of, as R the[ 82 ] the Impaffible barrier and defence of the Turk- i£h dominions in Europe ; is, if no better bar rier is to be oppofed to the power of their nearefi; neighbour, in my opinion, a bad de pendence indeed. From the fummit, begin ning the defcent, is feen a beautiful meadow, and about its center a town, with a fingle mofque in it, called Ifternam. We arrived there at noon, and dined but thought fit to force our march to a village, four hours further, in order to reach Sophia with more certainty and eafe, in the courfe of the next day. Our horfes were the worfe for it, we got however to Bakreglee, a town in Servia. This place is fituated among fome oak plantations, upon the hills, at a diftance from the road. The people are robuft, and thought rude, but they feem to polTefs their competency. In departing from this horde the next morning (Friday 13th Oc tober) we had to defcend a moll rugged and unbeaten traft of road, and could only have paffed fafely over it with the affiftance of a dozen of thefe ruflics, which they readily afford- . ed us. It employed us two hours, when we were brought in view of the valley of Sophia. It exhibits a very charming profpedl, as the foil is rich, and covered with a delightful ver dure;t 83 ] dure j feveral villages contribute to adorn the profpedl, and beyond all, the city of Sophia. The mountain of Vetofa, well known for its minerals, and the river rifing from its bowels; make two additional and interefting objeds in this landfcape. When the rains are heavy, a variety of metallic ores, and often of pure gold, are brought down by the torrent, A fpring of hot water runs through the city, and is con verted into a bath, for the conveniency of the inhabitants. Upon converfing with the archi mandrite on the fubjedt of the gold mine, he aflured me, that eight villages gained a conftant fubfiftence from fifting the fands brought down by the rains, and frequently were found among them precious ftones of confiderable value. Such a treafure offering to the eager avidity of the Turk, made it a matter of wonder to me, how the officers of the Porte £hould negledl it and begging the prieffc to inform me of the reafon of it, he folved it in the following man ner. Their avidity, he faid, refpefting this matter, was the caufe of their reaping no ad vantage from it, for the workmen being too poorly paid for their labour, concealed the fruits of it, and would take no pains to multiply their difcoveries. The officers alfo, who were R 2 employed[ &amp;4 1 employed in colleding thefe riches, were to® much tempted by the facility of enriching themfelves, to be true to their truft j and re- prefenting the deficiences which were caufed by their infidelity, to the poverty of the mine j laid government under the neceffity of aban doning the purfuit. So true it is, that in a matter of firft moment to all governments, and in which the fpirit of Turkifli prerogative can know no bounds, but indulges every fpe- cies of violence j the want of judgment defeats their aim. No circumftance in the hiftory of Turkiih miniftry, can give fo ftrong a proof of the infufficiency of their fyftem', as this : they cannot gather, where nature has profufely be- Jftowed her gifts j but like true defpots, cut down the tree, to get at the fruit—It is the nature of all defpotifm. •% ^ -• • \ ai ^ - r-&gt; f . •; r ; ' J' i .. ^ ^' '' ' ' 1 4 A&lt; ', V ' ' ^ . W e left Sophia, on. Saturday (14th Oaober) at fun-rife, and our journey lay along a fine country, exhibiting all over the face of it, quite to the road fide, an exuberance of wild flrawberry plants, which owing to the clemency of the feafon, were generally in blofTom. In fix hours we got to Kul Kallah, and halted to recruit our horfes for a march of fix hours far ther.C 85 ] ther. There is a large khan In this place, but decaying faft. We proceeded in an hour, and foon penetrated among the mountains j our road lying through a chafm, apparently formed by fbme ftrong convulfion of nature. The road was bad, we therefore could proceed but flowly, and confequently it was late and dark when we ar rived at Sari Buroot, where we flept. The next morning, Sunday (15th Odlober) at fun- rife we departed, and pafled a hilly coun try in about four hours to Sharquoi, where we were well entertained. Our room was by the lide of a prifon, where a dozen of gypfies'were chained together by the neck; men and women indifcriminately, in order to extort a tribute from them. We relied two hours, and con tinued our journey over hills, to Ak-Palanka, In this laft flage we met the courier going to Conftantinople, and were happy by his means, to fend fome tidings of our progrefs to our friends. Our lodging at this place was worfe than ufual, and made us very impatient for the return of day. On Monday the 16th Odober at day break we refumed our journey. The firft part of it was over mountains and bad roads to Banaquoi, ■ ; wherewhere we dined, and in one hour and a half more arrived at the bifhop's palace at Niflia. Another horfe worn out j the other three al- moft exhaufted, and requiring reft. The bi- fhop received us with infinite politenefs and ur banity; wiflied us to ftay a week with him, and did every thing in his power to e'ngage us to comply with his requeft. He preffed us to attend divine fervice the next morning at his church, promifing to officiate himfelf by way of giving an air of folemnity to the occafion, and in every refpedt took great pains to enter tain and honour us. His name is Maccarius, nearly allied to the reigning prince of Walla- chia. He has travelled into Ruffia and pretends to a perfedl knowledge of the ancient Greek literature. The women here wear caps in the lhape of helmets, compofed of quantities of paras*, ftrung together into that form. This is the capital of great Servia. We left it on Wednefday morning (18th Odlober) at eight o 'clock, and in two hours entered the fkirts of the famous wood of Belgrade : during thecourfe of this day's march, the appearance of the coun try was fometimes open, fometimes clofed ia • A fmall Turkifli coin. with[ S 7 ] with wood. We dined at Alikfinra, fix hours ride from Niffa, and went four hours further on to Reifna. The road was tolerably good; but the fky grew cloudy and threatened us with rain ; a circumftance of all things moft to be dreaded in the wood, as the roads in that cafe are rendered almoft impaflible. ' We reached Reifna however before it began, but foon after, and during the whole night, it never ceafed for a moment. We were under a very bad roof, in a large barn or ftable, in a kind of watch loft, and with the profpeit of being detained there, rnoft unpleafantly fituated indeed. It cleared up in the morning (Thurfday 19th Oc tober) and we fet off,, but the roads were deep, our horfes fulky,* our tackling bad, and every thing crofs. With the utmoft difficulty, we arrived in fix hours, after breaking our coach pole, and much of our harnefs, to Parakin ; four hours fhort of the appointed place j where we took up our night's abode: all this while in the wood. The iky grew ferene and a firong wind arole which continued all night, very much to our advantage, and on Friday morn ing (20th Odtober) before fun-rife, we again purfued our journey. In two hours we reached a town on the river Morva, and ferried over it, and[ 83 ] and immediately entered the thick of the wood leading to Zaghadina, where we dined, and afterwards to Bagherdena, to pafs the night. This day's journey of eight hours, was over confiderable hills, covered with lofty oak j but as the weather proved fine, the journey was not fo gloomy and difagreeable, as it would other- wife have been. Next morning, Saturday, 21ft October, we fet off again early, and marched Hill through the wood to Haflan Baflia Palanka, where we pafled the night j and on Sunday, 22d Odtober, as early as poffible, proceeded by Golan and Krotzka to Zweybruchen, where we flept. On Monday morning, 23d Odlober, by eleven o'clock, we arrived at Belgrade. Our janizary had preceded us to get the Bafha's paffport, for leave to pafs the confines, and met us by the fide of the Danube, with a Junk, prepared to take us acrofs to Semlin. We got there at about one o'clock the fame day, and reforted immediately to the place allotted for our quarantine. We had letters of introdudtion to the Baron de Sturm, commandant of Semlin j and he and l^is lady did us the hqgour of ^ vifit the fame after-f 89 ] afternoon, offering us every affiftance and in dulgence, the nature of our confinement would admit of. ft C-J ^ ^0 Sl1' ./m Ot jllVi ti Semlin is a fmall town, fituated upon the peninfula, between the rivers Danube and Sa- va, juft at the conflux of both, and immediate ly oppofite the town-* of Belgrade, which has been the theatre of fome of the great exploits of prince Eugene. The Lazzaretto or infirmary, is upon a low point of land neareft to the river; having the town at the back of it. The rooms are fuf- ficient for the accommodation of uafTengers, but unavoidably damp and unhealthy, they are warmed by ftoves, which make another incon venience equally intolerable; for the air fo rati fied by a heat impregnated with the metallic properties of the ftove, fell diredlly upon our lungs, and nearly fuffbcated us j which obliged us to renounce our fires. The weather towards the firfl part of our time in this place was fine, and we had liberty to make ihort excurfions into the country, in a carriage or on foot, upon promife of ofeferving S the[ 9° ] the ftrideft diftance from all we met, and hav ing a guard to accompany us. We were too eager of this privilege for our good, for walk ing too far on a cold day, to fee a fifliing party? Mrs. B was feized with an illnefs, which, in its confequences, embittered our journey the whole way from Semlin to Vienna. The Lazzaretto, which is built upon a large fpot of ground, and is very fpacious, is gene rally pretty well filled with merchandize im ported from Turky. ■ During our flay we were varioufly enter tained; a fair was to be held, juft upon our terminating the quarantine, and people were affembled to attend it of all denominations, and from very diftant parts. There was among the reft, a company of itinerant merchants, that had wandered from the mountain of Tirrol; uniting at the fame time, their mercantile and mufical talents, and blending and improving them both for the common good. This com pany came to our quarters in the lazzaretto, and entertained us with their mufic. A woman accompanied them upon the harp, and the whole party playing upon various inftruments, and[ 9 1 3 I and having a good choice of airs gave uscompleat fatisfad:ion. It coft us two florins, and they were fatisfied. Having performed our three weeks quaran tine we were happy to quit immediately the cold and comfortlefs fituation we were in, for an appartment offered us by the diredlor of the quarantine in his own dwelling. Mrs. B had been very ill for feveral days with a fever, and was yet in a very critical ftate. We fpent a few days in this fituation with very little lign of her amendment, and at length refolved to fet off. We bought a four-wheeled chaife of the diredor, but the body nothing more than that of a common whifky, old and im paired in every part of it. We left Semlin in the rain and were from ten o'clock in the morning, till ten at night, creeping and plung ing along before we got to a place of fliel- ter. We were to have been conveyed in lix hours to Peterwaradin, and inftead of that, with |oy we put up with a room in a cabaret at Petfche almoft overflowed with rain. It had a long table in it, fuch as is found in the molt wretched of public houfes, and thereon I fpread our carpet, Mrs. B- being reduced to make S 2 itt 92 1 it her bed for the reft of the night. I for my part laid myfelf down upon the bench by the fide of it, fummoning to my aid all the patience and resignation that was wanted to endure a fituation fo full of complicated diftrefs. We fet out as early as we could next day and arrived at Peterwaradin about twelve o'clock at noon; Mrs. B continued very ill, but being houfed at a tolerable auberge, we fent for a phyfician to prefcribe for her. She refted all that day and night, and next morning had fpi- rits enough to defire to go forward but with the fever ftill upon her, the weather was rather finer and we ventured on. The roads were fo bad it was with difiiculty we got along; our way lay for the moft part by the Danube fide. We got to Glofhan where we changed horfes and went on to Kerakatfch j but here they de tained us fix hours while the horfes could be got j they were conveying wood for the poft mafter. The weather was fine which height ened our chagrin beyond bearing, and the in difference of the people at the poft houfe almoft drove us to defpair: at length they made their appearance and we got to the next ftage Patfch. We had no long delay here, but our horfes were very unwilling to get on. They carried us through[ 93 ] through the town, and near a mile beyond it, but in croffing a bridge of loofe timber laid acrofs a deep ditch, they turned fo fhort as to bring one of the hind wheels of our chaife upon the timber ends, and canted them up, fo as nearly to overfet us in the ditch. I faw the danger before we came exadlly upon it, and jumped out with Mrs. B juft in time to efcape the fall. I ftopt the poflilion inftantly, and by jumping into the ditch, and putting props under the timber ends, the carriage got fafe over the bridge and we remounted. Wc had not gone far however before our horfes became reftive, and turning out of the road, ran us into a bog clofe by the fide of the Da nube; every effort to get out for many hours was vain, but at length with the affiftance of two additional horfes, and the prefence of the poft mafter himfelf we got back to the poft houfe, where the woman of the houfe did all ihe could to relieve and comfort us. She made Mrs. B fome broth, and gave up her own bed for the whole night. The next morning early we were able to proceed, and endeavoured to recover our chaife and baggage which wc had been obliged to leave flicking in the mud ex- pofed to be plundered by the firft pafTenger. We made[ 94 ] made feveral attempts to drag the carriage back, but the horfes were unequal to it. It had fet tled at leaft four feet in the mud, fo that we could not move it for feveral hours. It was Sunday morning, and fome very ftout peafants, a dozen at leaft, paffing to the town to church, I begged their aid and offered them money: they fat their fhoulders to it, and relieved us at once; having got us into the right way again, one of them taking Mrs. B into his arms, carried her over the bad road to the carriage. We thanked them as our deliverers, gave them what contented them, and were glad to get on again. We got to Novafella and from thence to Vukovar j we had no provifion with us, nor could we afk for any, but by figns; we walk ed into the poft-mafter's kitchen at Vukovar, though it was otherwife no public houfe, and there being feveral pipkins on the fire with foups and ftews, we expreffed a defire to partake of them. The cook-maid who faw us and under- flood us very well, was inflexible to our de mands; all that we could get of her for an anfwer was nix, nix •, I therefore helped myfelf, and before Mrs. B could get the foup to her lips, fhe fainted in my arms; this fcene excited the woman's compafiion, and with the reliefC 55 ] relief (Tie brought, we were in an hoar or two, enabled to proceed. Our next ftage was Eflek, but we had yet to furmount many difficulties: the way lay over a wide common, and night coming on, we got out of the road, and went round, and round, for hours in the fame circle; at length we heard the found of horfes feet, by the direction of which, we were once more put into the high road: about three o'clock in the morning we got into the town, and were carried to a lamentable beerhoufe, where we were glad to find a place of reft. Mrs. B had fuffered the utmoft agonies during this journey, and was apparently breathing her laft. At day light I fallied forth to get fome affift- ance, and the poft-mafter being near, I recom mended myfelf to him. He had a good houfe, and very humanely offered to accommodate me with a room, and the domeftic comforts that his family afforded j I very happily embraced it, and returning to Mrs. B , took her in my arms, and removed her to this hofpitable dwelling. The name of the poft-mafter to whom we were fo much indebted, was Franco- laki ; i got proper medical advice, and every other defirable affiftance, and was happy enough, on the 17th day, to fee the fever which had never \[ 96 I never intermitted, compleatly diflodged. We were vifited and invited by the commandant of the place j General Mattheifan and feveral of the officers and their ladies, and were enabled in a few days, to leave the place, full of grati tude and admiration of the benevolent treatment and hofpitality of the good people of ElTek. We exchanged our carriage here, and again pur- fued our route. The poft from hence to Vienna are as follows: from Eflek to Baraniwar, the roads were deep and very bad; next to Siclos, to FunfFkirken; to Geofziget, to Iftvandi, to Babofea, to Prefnitz, to Iharos, to Canifea, to Kahath, to Szala EgefTek, to Kerment, to Stein, to Am Anger, to Gunz, to Grofwarafdoff, to Edenbourg, to Grofholflein, to WimpafTeing, to Hochan, to Vienna.JOURNEY n F R O M h « CONSTANTINOPLE to ALEPPO, * / .

The method obferved by Franks (by which appellation all Europeans are diftinguifhed in Turky) is to apply to their refpedtive minifter by whofe direction it is demanded of the Porte, and always granted : but any fubjedl of the Empire may obtain it by diredl application to the Vizir, and upon pay ing a fee of three Crufti and a half (or js. to the clerk. I obtained mine by this means, T and[ SfS J and at feven o'clock in the morning of the I rth ©f May, 1780, left the Metropolis in a boat,, and crofTed the Hellefpont to Sender, or Scutari,, the Chryfopolis of the ancients, ■ M r. —— a painter by profeffion, myfelfy Selim Aga a Tartar guide, Emin Aga who begged my efcort my fervant Matthew, art Armenian, and two poft boys, called Serugees, eompofed my party. At half paft eight we mounted, and on our way paffed Malteffa&gt; Fe- uar. Cartel, and at Bendik we flopped and re freshed. The Turks have proportioned their diftance to time, and by my general obfervationy it turned out about four miles to the hour: in riding poll; through, they often run down three hours in one. The appearance of the country to the left, or North Eaft; is a gentle afcent over hills, leading to the foot of very high mountains-.. The foil feems good, is well cul tivated, and the vegetation much forwarder, than in Europe, though at fo fmall a diftance from it. All the way on our right we had a view of the fea of Marmora, the princes iflands, the gulph of Ifmit, the coaft of Mandania, and mount Olympus. At five o'clock in the even ingt 99 ] ing wc arrived at Oheibize, the firft Menzel Khan-e, or poll houfe from Scuder. It muft be remarked, that we were all equip ped as Tartars, and were from long intercourfc with the Turks, pretty well able to fupport ■our difguife. We were enjoying our pipes and coffee at this place, and compofed in fad: for the evening; hut this was to be a journey of adventures, and the arrival of a certain Ofman Aga, on his way from Aleppo to Conflantinoplc opened the fir ft fcene. H e brought with him the baggage of aa Engli/h gentleman, who had accompanied him. to the llage before, but had ftrayed from his party, and might probably, he faid have fal len among thieves, as he had been miffing from two o'clock in the morning. I looked into the baggage to find by fome fuperfcription of letters, who the perfon might be, by which I difcovered him to be a Captain James Smyth. The circumftance engaged one to mount, though tired, to go in fearch of him. We pafled a vil lage after two hours march called Mallum, and further on to a ferry, where we embarked with our horfes, and failed acrofs an arm of the gulph of Nicomedia, courfe fouth eaft, to a low point T 2 of. C 1°° 1 of land on the oppolite fliore; diftant only a quarter of an hour's walk from a hamlet, called Herfek. This traverfe which we performed in three quarters of an hour, avoids a fix hour's round by land, and in winter, is fometimes fo boifterous, as to be impaffable for days together. My firft bufinefs at this place was to enquire for my difireffed countryman, and I was almoft in- Itantly gratified by finding him in afolitary cof fee houfe, extended on a mat afleep j I called to him by his name. He ftarted, flared, and look ed aftonifhed, as if he ftill thought himfelf in a dream. This gentleman had been in India, aid de camp to General Egerton, and had ar rived thus far on his way to England. He had been moft cruelly beaten by the man that accompanied him acrofs the defert from Baflbra to Aleppo, and from thence, by collufion with his Tartar guide, had forced his company upon him, in fpite of all the precaution he had taken to avoid it. They had travelled difagreeably to gether as far as Kiz dovrene, but on the road from this place, which is notorious, i am told, for robbers; both this man and the guide fet upon him, and forced him to fly for fafety to the woods. He concealed himfelf there till day light, and then crept into a corn field by the road[ lOl ] road fide, whence he efpied a hofpitable paffcn- ger, an honeft Boftangee, who conduced him to the place he was in when I found him. He Jittle expedred when he laid down in this litua- tion, furrounded by a people he knew nothing of, and full of apprehenfions of further ill treat ment, ignorant of their language, and helplefs in many other refpefts, that he fhould be roufed by a countryman feeking to relieve him, and adminifter fuccour to his diflrefs. It appeared to him, as I faid before, the effed of a dream, and he was long awake before he could be un deceived. When informed of my name, he knew it, and appeared rejoiced to fee me. It is flattering to obferve a public prevention in one's favour! I refcued Mr. Smyth from the people of Herfek who were unwilling to give him up; nor till I had threatened to return to Conftantinople to complain, would they releafe him. I procured him a boat, and a trufty per- fon to attend him, when he had embarked, an'd I faw him fet fail for Conftantinople (it was twelve o'clock at night) I returned to my quar ters and laid me down to reft. At half paft four in the morning (12th May) I refumed my journey over hills and dales, a four[ ioz ] four hours ride, to Kiz dovrene. The nightin gales, which in this country fing all day, and are near every fhaded brook, are fo numerous, and their notes fo fweet; as to make the ride a fpecies of enchantment. The village we arc now at, is inhabited by Bulgarians, and is fitu- ated on a hill, furrounded by higher hills, and near the foot of an ancient ruined caftle. Thefe people are independent, and preferve their ori ginal cufioms. Their women go unveiled, are free, jocofe, and of a complexion and forward- nefs, that befpeaks no apprehenfion of infult or violation. We breakfafted with this Amazo nian tribe, upon eggs and milk, and proceeded on our journey with the fame horfes towards Chiniflik. The road is the greateft part over hills, enriched with fpontaneous odoriferous fhrubs, and pleafant, if excefs can pleafant be, to the extreme. When you come to the defcent, the profpedt is delightful. On your right appears a vaft lake, adorned with a rich verdent margin j in front, at the eaft end of the lake, the city of Chinillik j and to the left, promifcuoufly dif- perfed on riling grounds, in a femi-circular view, a variety ot villages, beautifully environed by variegated lands, and cattle bronzing on the fummit. It was ten o'clock when we reached the[ I0 3 ] the city. You enter among fome veftlges of a ruined wall, and on a fquare tower, high up, is leen a Greek infcription : nothing in the town elfe did I fee worth remarking. We got frefls horfes, and mounted at four o'clock; our road lay along the middle of a rich valley, and on each ftde adorned with walnut trees, a fmall rivulet running between. The cultivation on each fide the mountains, to their utmoft fcope, appearing more extended, and giving a livelier pidlure of induftry, than I had met with in any other part of Turky. After an hour's ride in the valley, we began to afcend the hill to the right, and at the top, were brought in profped: of the Brufla road; only fix hours diftant from the capital of that name, once the royal refidence of the Sul tans : it is defcribed by a river running at the foot of it. This river has its fource in mount Olympus, and is increafed by the hot fprings of BrulTa, and the diffolving fnows from the heights above it. It flows northward to the Black Sea, and enlivened our profpedl all the way to Leuke (our third poft-houfe) a city of fome note for its manufadlures. We did not arrive before ten o'clock at night, fatigued and hungry. We fupped on pilo and flewed fowl, our invariable fare, and refled like travellers worn down with fatigue.[ I0 4 ] fatigue. At four in the morning (13th May) we mounted, and as we rode along the town, could fee the world in motion. Many of the inhabitants are Chriftians, and their houfes fpa- cious j the river runs at the bottom of the town. Beyond it on the banks, were planted for a long trad, the white mulberry tree, for the nourifhment of filk worms ; for in this territory is produced large quantities of filk, which finds its way to Europe, under, the denomination of BrulTa filk; and for its goodnefs is in high repute. We pafled a very delightful valley, well water ed and interfperfed with trees during the firft part of this poft; and towards the end, over a very fteep and difficult mountain. The road is level on the top for a good ftretch, but we foon came to a filed occupied by a guard, who were provided with frefli water, and fuch fruit as the fituation would enable them to procure, for the convenience of the traveller. We met here half a dozen men, whom we fhould have been very forry to hav? met upon the road : fellows that«had been difmiffed from the fervice of the Bafiia of Trebizond j and who, in their ftate of derelidtion, are known to have recourfe, for fub- fiftence, to every fpecies of violence. It is the cafe all over the Turkifii empire, when any Ba- fiia[ ] iha is depofed, his mercenaries are difcharged,, and under the denomination ofcopii/Tes, or men at leifure, go a free booting upon the public, until they are reinftated in fome other employ j they then plunder for their mafter, for their avocation is to dcfpoil. Thefe men eyed us with looks of rapine, but they faw us armed ; they took the road we came, and we proceeded on Our journey. This was a port of ten hours to Sekut (fourth poft-houfe.) Near this place, and in view of it, is buried the firft of the Otto man race, the great Ali Ofman Padefha. His tomb appears at about half a mile diftant from the port: houfe, by an iron pallifading, and a plantation of lofty cyprefTes. We mounted at five in the afternoon, rode over mountains, and latterly over a fine plain, to Efkee Shaher (fifth poft-houfc.) As we were feafoned a little to rid ing by this time, we accelerated our rate, and performed this poft in feven hours j which brought us in at twelve o'clock at night. Upon the fofa in the room to which we had been ufhered, lay a Turkifhguittar, ahum-drum kind of a thing to European ears, but temptation enough to divert Selim from his inclination to reft. He ftrung it to his voice, and with an hi larity of fong, which Yorick would have har- U monizedmonlzed to the finell feelings, he charmed away the night. At dawn we Tallied forth to view the baths; and the morning difclofed to us a city beautifully fituated on the acclivity of a hill, commanding a wide expanded view over a fruit ful, well watered plain, A copious fource of natural hot water rifes in the fldrts of the city, and unites its ftream with a confiderable river, flowing to the fouthward. The baths are built over the fpring j but where the waters iffue, to the place of their junftion with the river, all along its courfe, the poor inhabitants are em ployed in great numbers, in fuch offices of ne- celfary and ufeful ablution, as the conveniency and importance of fuch a benefit, muft unavoid ably fuggeft. I bathed in thefe celebrated hot baths, and drank of the waters; both were re ported to have efficacies conducive to health. In effeit, I»can vouch for their property of im mediately operating all the good purpofes ofeafe and relaxation. I was as delaffein half an hour j as if my ride had been only ten, inftead of two hundred miles. It was a fortunate refrefhment, for we got but indifferent horfes here j but we made them go notwithftanding in ten hours, over hills, and a pleafanter, becaufe a varied foil, to Saidi Khazzee, (6th poft-houfe.) This place[ IS? J is diilinguiOied by a iarge fquare building, with a magnificent mofque in it, on the top of a hill, it took its name from a furprizing fanton, who, by the tradition of the Sheick, moft marvei- loufly confined a gigantic fpirit, that had done ancredible ravages, and was the terror of the country round about. The daughter of Soly- man the Great, had it declared to her in a vifion, that if ihe would make a pilgrimage to this fpot, and dedicate upon it, a mofque to the prophet j the Sheick fhould be endued with power to ihackle this fpirit, whereby the people fliould be relieved : all which was regularly complied with, and fulfilled. The Sheick gave the painter and my lei f a paper of white powder each (part of the gian t's bones pulverifed, I fuppofe) which hadithe property of preferving us againfl danger. We took it and gave him alms, which is the only valuable property it had in effedh That ' a rawing from the credulity of the ignorant, or the complaifance of the enlightened, a tri bute which contributed to his affluence and fupport. We left this place at four in the afternoon, and becaufe at the next poft-houfe, the horfes could not be got in from pafture be- forea delay of ten hours, we croffed the country diiedly over mountains and through woods to U 2 thet 108 ] the place where they were. We were nine hours, which detained us until one in the morning, Corfaff Bafha is the name of the feventh poft- houfe j but we deviated to an itinerant horde. We roufed the chief from his cabbin, com- pofed of the trunks of fir trees, laid as they were hewn down, one upon another, in a fquare figure ten feet high; and covered at top with the branches and leaves : it had a chimney place formed with mud and ftone, and a glo rious fire in it. We took his place, lighted our pipes, made fome coffee, ordered our hories to be got by morning, defired fome eggs and milk might be provided for breakfaft, and then refign- ed ou delves to fiecp. At day light, Hadgee Muftafa, Menzel Aga of Cofruif Bafha, a man of a very refpedable appearance joined our party. After fome converfation, by which he had difco- vered that we were Franks, he entertained us with a very unexpected breakfafl, for he had his fami ly mong the horde, and flocks and herds abound ing about him : he told us alfo of a wondrous building in the neighbourhood of the place, on which Frank characters were infcribed; and which muft have been ereited, he faid, before the Turks had driven the Infidels (Ghiaours) from the country. It was only an hour's ride.[ 10 9 1 and lie propofed to lend us horfes and to conduct us thither. Mr. , the painter, and myfelf mounted, and followed our good old Turk to this fragment of antiquity. We proceeded over a hill, and through a wood of pines, to a fmall valley, in which a rivulet runs, fupplied by wa ter oozing from an ancient aquadudt; and two hills in the form of fugar loaves, on which are the ruins of two ancient towers. Thefe were rrot &gt; • the objedts our Aga had intimated for our oh-, fervation. He led us further to a ground af- cending to the foot of a rock, making the extreme angle of a chain of inferior mountains. As we approached, it exhibited a beautiful ornamental facade, engraved on a polifhed furface of the rock. It feemed to have been a work antecedent to the claffical inftitutions in architecture j but regular, fublime, and bold. On the extreme right mar gin of the facade, beginning about one fourth of the height from the ground, and wrote lldeways upwards to about one third of the top, is a clear and diftinft infeription of ancient charafters: There appears another on the projected cornifli, over the upper part of the left fide of the facade, but fome of the charadters effaced, the reft very clear. I offer no conjecture as to the intentions ofof their authors; but give the fad:, and leave ihe comment to antiquarians. T he depth of the rock, for it projedls from the great mafs of the mountain, and is palpable on three fides of it, is no more than twenty feet: and appears, excepting thepolifhed and engraved facadeinits rude, irregular and natural fhape, with out a fign of excavation, or the veftige of a build ing. I had a thought at firft indeed, that, as it faced to the eaft, it might have been a monument of pagan worfhip : but further on, is another in the fame ftyle, of lefs magnitude and beauty, fac ing the north, which again ftaggered my opinion. I may conclude with fafety, that, let what will, be meant by it, it prefents at leaft to the contem plation of the curious, a lingular, magnificent and lafting view of the then ftate of ornamental architedure. The when, and by whom, as before obferved, is left to thedecifion of the curious and learned. \ I n a line parallel to the facade, northward at about one hundred and fifty paces diftant, is ano ther rock, ifolated, and of a conical form, exhi biting as many cavities of the fame nature with thofe of the catacombs near the pyramids of E- gypt, as the folid rock could poffibly contain. I entered[ 'I ] entered into many, but none communicated with the others. They have all a variety of niches, fome more, fome lefs, as the number expected to be depofited therein, required the labour of mak ing them; and leave no room to doubt, that they were receptacles for the dead. They are now re ceptacles for the living, for I found a bird's neft in one of them with feveral young, but 1 thought there was more piety in leaving them undifturb- ed, than impiety in difturbing the infenfible dead. W e returned to the hamlet at half paft one in the afternoon, and mounted our horfes at two, very, well fatisfied with our digreffion and difco- very. The old man, in the idea which is generally entertained by the inhabitants of the Eaft, that all Franks are dodOrs or conjurors; held out his pulfe, which I direded to the painter, as having fomething more intenfe in his phiz, to know if he was well. As it generally turns out, that peo ple ad from impulfe, and only aik the advice of dodors when they want it j I told Mr. ■ to recommend a dofe of rhubarb, with which he was provided, to cool the old man's blood: he faid it was very wife and proper, thanked us, and bid us farewel. W eW e paffed through woods and over mountains) three hours march before we got into the high road. Proceeding, we law to the left of us, or north fide of the road, many cavities in the rocks, of the fame appearance of thofe I defcribed in the laft ftage; but leading one into the other to infinity. The entrance to thefe caverns is fmall, but fome of them may be capable of containing three hundred horfe. Further on ftands a rock, fingly, and of a fugar-loaf form, excavated and difpofed in fuch regular apartments, as, my guide faid, had acquired it the appellation of Seraija or palace. Thefe places, it is faid, were inhabited by banditti j and I faw on the way fide near them, a large number of fepulchral ftones, fiained with red, to denote thatMhe blood of thofe, that were there interred, was fpilt by violence. It took us thirteen hours to Ballawadin (eighth poft houfe) where we refted till feven o'clock, Tuefday morn ing the 16th of May. It was here that upon our arrival, a fellow addreffing himfelf to ifte as head of the party, proceeded without further ceremony to ftiampoo me. It is a cuftom in the TurkKh baths to prefs with both hands upon every limb and joint, and by crofiing and bending them to their utmoft ftretch, bring the mufcles to their proper tone: it does not produce the moft agree able[ II 3 ] ' able fenfations during the operation, but, af ter hard riding, is the compleatell: reftorative to ftrength and vigor that can be imagined*. The road from this place is acrofs a plain, for the moft part under water ^ a bridge however, eompofed of a great number of arches over the deepeft part of it, affords a dry palTage to the tra veller. In this part of the country grows the pop py, from which opium is made; fruitful and ex- tenfive crops were ripening to the expedting pea- fant's wi£h. Having crolfed the plain and being arrived at the foot of the oppofite mountains, we followed their direction, and were refreflied and delighted, by paffing over at fhort intervals, plen tiful torrents of Water, nouri(hed by the melting fnow on the mountain heighths and running into the plain. In fix hours we arrived at IfTaklee (ninth poll houfe) and dined, but loft no time. We refum- ed our journey with frelh horfes, and proceeded along the fame delightful plain, ftill copioufly fupplied at little diftances by torrents of refrefh- ing water, from the fnow-top'd mountains, all the % * Vide Letter, p. z8. X way[ U4 3 way to AfkeAaher—only feven hours' ride frotu the la ft poft houfe and the tenth from Conftan- tinople. t . ' ' , / - v. , , „ v c / -'V^ This is the firfl town in Caramania, fituatcd at the foot and in the chafm of a mountain. It gave birth to the famous Naffer il Din, celebrated for his great wit and pleafantry. His fpirit is in voked as the genius of the place j and they report of him, that unlefs certain unremitted attentions are paid to him by the inhabitants, he caufes the frefti winds to ceafe, and reduces tnem to defpair. In his life time the great Zingis Khan paffed be fore the town, and Naffer il Din was deputed by the inhabitants to appear before him, and to pay their homage to him. But as the cuftom of the Eaft makes it criminal to go into the prefence of the Great for the firft time without fome tribute, and the poverty of the place could offer nothing but the fruit in feafon ; old Naffer il Din had a difpute with his wife, whether he fiiould take pomegranates or figs: (he was for the former, but 'he took the figs, in which'he had good caufe to triunlph; for when he prefented the figs, the conqueror ordered his people to throw them one by one at his head j and for every one that hit him, he was obferved to make a folemn thankf : &gt; giving[ II 5 1 giving to God. Zingis Khan could not refrain from demanding the reafon of this from the phi- lofopher, who explained himfelf by faying, that- if he had brought the pomegranates, his would have had caufe to triumph, by feeing him return with his head broken. It muft have been therefore the work of Providence that infpired him to'take the figs in oppofition to her opinion j whom, for quiet fake, he had humoured in every other inftance of his life. Zingis Khan, for this witticifm endowed him with the fovereignty of the place, and which has been facred to his me mory ever fince. From the town we defcended again to the fame fine plain, and after ten hours ride, that is, at one o'clock in the morning, we reached II Ghaun (eleventh poll: houfe) 17th of May three hours refl fufficed us. At four we mounted to proceed on a flage of eighteen hours. The firft part over uneven ground, though a rich foil, to Khabung Khane, and fo on to Ladik, a town half way. It was time to refl and recruit our horfe's and our- felves for nine hours further flretch, upon nine hours already performed with the fame horfes, was fomething redoubtable both to man and beaft. in two hours however on we went. Our road X 2 wast 116 ] was over little hills about half the way. At near fun-fet we came in fight of Conia, then at a great diftance, (landing majefticly on an extenfive plain, once the* feat of empire. The eye is wearied with this view. A mountain ftands fingly in the center of the plain, feeming from rifing vapours in the vaft expanfe, a fhapelefs cloud. As we approached, our objects difappeared. Night dropped her veil and clofed the fcene. The way grew tedious as our nags grew weary, for nothing is fo irkfomeas a jaded horfe. Fatigue, and fome little inconveniences from long inceffant riding, made me feverifh, but 3 few hours reft repaired all that. Temperance of living, and abftinence from wine, are necef- fary rules to be obferved in travelling. To thefe I afcribe my good ftate of health, and the faci lity with which I endured the fatigues, the heats, and hardlhips of the journey ; it was ten at night before we got to Conia. The poft houfe (being the 12th) is without the walls of the city, not to interfere with the difcipline of for tified towns, nor impede the courfe of public in telligence and difpatch. This city ftands about half way between Conftantinople and Aleppo, and' [ *'7 1 snd makes a diftance by my computation of near five hundred miles. Having performed it in eight days, fomc little indulgence might confcientioufly be taken; we therefore determined to fpend the night and next day, at Conia. The walls are not fo ruined as the generality of thofe city walls which have fallen under the Turkifh yoke ; there are many baftions yet complete, and many monuments of the power and paflage of Sultan Amurath over this country. There are divers pieces of fculp- ture inferred in the walls, and particularly a coat of arms, having two fpread eagles for fupporters and another for the creft, incomparably well en graved. On the wall leading to the right froni the principal gate, are two figures of lions, as big again as life, projedling from the wall, turned towards each other, and, by their attitude and expreflion, feeming eager to attack. Many in dications are apparent of its having been a great and powerful city, and indeed the fituation is fuch, as with induftry and good government, to be fufceptible of the higheft attainment of grandeur and opulence. Before[ I'S ] Before I take my leave of Conia, I muft re mark fomething on the inftitution of public poft houfes all over the Turkifh empire. The afto- nifhing heaps of bones and ikeletons of horfes difperfed in and about the yard of this pofl houfe, particularly, made it occur to me as an object worthy of enquiry. It being one of the principal fprings of all governments, and effential to a defpot, to be well informed of the fluctuations in the inferior or ders of the ftate; this public regulation the only one which is well followed up in Turky, has been eftabliflied all over the empire. In fuch towns on all the high roads as are at convenient diftances, a number of horfes are ftationed for the Grand Signers Tartars, or the Tartars of any of the Bafhas j or any of the Sultans officers of note; or any fubjedl, or flranger who may be furniflied with orders to that effe£t from the .fupreme Vizir, or the governors of provinces whofe authority your fituation may make you Hand in need of. Every horfe, for every hour's diftance, ftands you in ten afpers or two pence halfpenny; and the guide in ten afpers for each horfe for the whole ftage: fo that a fingle tra veller[ 11 9 1 veller with his guide going a ftage of ten hours will pay for the two horfes - - And for his guide - - o o 5 0 4 7 That is four (hillings and feven pence for a ftags of forty miles. But as this pay is very inadequate to the charge, it becomes the concern of the public to defray the deficiency; and therefore, they appoint an agent to adminifter the fun&amp;ions of a poft maf ter; that the office may be regularly performed, and the due proportion of each with juftice as certained. It had been in many places, a reafon of extortion to the Bafha's, who under pretence of affeffing a rate for the purpofe of maintaining a due number of men and horfes for their indif- penfable fervice, have oftentimes fleeced the poor inhabitants of ten times the needful. On this account in fome places where a certain fpirit of liberty has (hewn itfelf, the principal inhabitants have agreed to take this duty by turns on them- felves; and in fuch places it is common to meet with extraordinary good horfes.f 120 J At Conia they were mere lanthorns. The uearefl ftation to this great city being a ride of fixteen hours at leaft, no horfe can poffibly re fill; it for any length of time. It follows that the mortality is very great, and the charge of courfe fo heavy, as to make it incredible, with out ocular demonftration, to thofe who are forced to fupport it. For this reafon the agent or Menzel Aga is cautious enough to preferve the fkeletons in evidence of his honefty, and to fcreen himfelf from puniihment. It may feem ftrange that fo much regularity fliould be an cffedt of tyranny and oppreffion; but as thofe who have the power to enforce it, are fo inti mately interefted in its punitual adminiftration j it is likely to continue; and to be the moft du rable, as it certainly is the moft ufeful inftitu- tion, in this tottering empire. At five in the evening (18th May) we mount ed and rodq twelve hours along the plain to a village called Ifmil, where it was incumbent upon us to reft. In fix hours we refumed our Journey, which brought us by the ifolated moun tain, in nine hours march to Kaiabunar, making a ftage of one and twenty hours on horfeback. The ground is little cultivated in view of the road[ 12 I ] road, but produces numberlefs beautiful flowers, aromatic herbs, and almoft univerfally over the plain, the abfynthium or wild wormwood, emit ting a fragrance which embalmed the air. In this town (13th poft houfe) is a well built mofque, and at a proper diftance in front of it, a large Khan, built, both of them, by Sultan Selim upon his return vidorious, two hundred and twenty years ago from Egypt. The roofs were covered with fheet lead, fupplied from a mine in the neighbourhood of the place, but now negledted. This country is renowned for its fheep and goats, and for the excellence of their fleece; their pafture is in fad: like that (hort fubftan- tial kind which grows on the fouth end of Ban- ftead downs. We refted here till midnight, changed horfes, and proceeded before one, by the ifland of Salt, and acrofs a large marfh under water to Khortee; a village deferted in the fum- mer on account of the bad air, though on the border of a fine ftream abounding with fi£b. In numerable quantities of ferpents alfo infeft this river, and come floating upon its furface, with crefteredl, contemning danger. Two that came within our reach from the bridge, were victims y of[ 122 of their temerity, but more perhaps of the en mity we had imbibed in common with mankind, againfl this natural foe to the human race. We were tempted by the fituation to indulge with a pipe, than which no luxury at fuch a time can be greater; and having quaffed voluptuoufly for an hour, we remounted and purfued our way. The remainder of this poft was over as fine a common land as I ever faw, and fo fimilar in fa£l to fome fituations I had been partial to in Eng land, as to ftir up fome old and painful affec tions of my heart. I loft the charm of the thing in the effeds of the comparifon j and for this time was the dupe of my recolledlion. In rid ing by a ditch, we difcovered a large ferpent upon the brink of it, with a toad's head in its mouth, and the body, though fwelled as big as Ihe could make it, her laft refource, yielding gradually to the more powerful fudlion of its devourer. I attempted to relieve the toad, by firing a piftol at the ferpent, which flafhedin the pan ; but Selim was more fuccefsful with a ftone, for he killed the ferpent and relieved the prifo- Jier. This was in fight of Heraclea (14th poft- houfe) the approach to which is very pleafing. Its principal avenue is compoied of a confidera- ble plantation of trees in a femi-circular afpedl, andC I2 3 ] and beyond them on a rifing ground, appears the town, over yvhich a lofty mountain rears its head involved in fnow. The more immediate entrance to the town, is by an allee', formed by a double row of trees on each fide, through both of which is turned an ample ftream.- You pafs a gate of fun-burnt brick, which with the other appear ances of the town, denotes that its chief orna ments are the gifts of nature ; fimple, but fuf- ficient. We difmounted at about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, and refted till four in the even ing. We then purfued our journey all night, over hills anddales to Urucifla^ijth poft-houfe.) The habitations in this village are mere huts j there is a khan but I did not look into it. They gave us entertainment after their way, furniihed us with frefh horfes, and on we continued, over and among mountains of a great height} having a river running at the bottom, fupplied by frequent torrents and fources of water gufhing from the rocks above us on both fides. In five hours we came to a bridge, which defcribes the limits of the Caraman and Adena Bafhaliks; and beyond the bridge is a fource of water, for its peculiar goodnefs and fweetnefs call'd Shukher Poare, the fountain of fugar. Here we were over taken by a Boftangee and his fervant, whojoined us, Y 2 and[ 124 ] and regaled us with a whiff of hi Ner^heel or Per- fian pipe; he hid left Conftantinople the day after ! . but h'.d not delayed on the way } in h: : ;;n )ur we mounted and purfued our jour- i her. The mountains are adorned with r : eilefs pines fant iftiG illy planted, affording a moft del' &gt;hlful fcene. In the courfe of the Ut feven hours, the two chains of mountains which environ the great plain of Conia, and which my memory can trace back to the plains of Bulla Wad in j having gradually approached each other, and now from an eaftward diredtion, turn rapidly to the fouth, and round the inter- mediate points of the compafs quite to fouth- weft, and in this diredion continue. We met in this day's journey, many large caravans of Turk- man families, attended like the patriarchs of old, by all their live ftock of camels, horfes, cows, goats and fheep : along the vallies we faw others encamped to an incredible number. They wander as the feafons invite, from eaft to weft, and from north to fouth, whefe markets offer for their fuperfluous ftock; in fuch diredtions, and in fuch proportion, fo as to find pafture dif- tributed by the gracious hand of Providence for their flocks. They are well cloathed, and the females of the chiefs are accommodated with (tackts)f ,2 5 1 - •/ • . (tackts) litters. Their appearance, their wealth, their fimplicity, feem each.of them to befpeak inextinguiftlable freedom. At eight o'plock in the evening (20th May) we arrived pretty much fatigued, at Ya Illah (16th poft-houfe) a place compofed of only three huts, but under the government of a Turkman Aga, who fhews no particular refpedt for the Sultan's officers or commands; made indepen dent by the fecurity of his fituation. The name of the place is an invocation to God, adapted as I fuppofe to the danger of the pafs. I could per ceive rebellion in every look, word and gefture. Our Tartar Selim, who bluftered or flattered as he knew the weaknefs or independence of his mpn, was obliged at this poft houfe to affumeanair of meeknefs; he began in an high tone of voice, butwasanfwered with contempt: at length he fub- mitted to pay an exorbitant fee for his horfes, and was glad to get away. It was paft midnight, and in a ihort time we began to defcend the mountain. At about half way thedefcent, wecametoachafm, near twenty feet .wide, the mountain running abruptly up on each fide to a ftupendous height. On the fummit to the right is an ancient tower that might well annoy the pafs, but its natural defence[ 126 J defence below, feems to bid defiance to the mod powerful armies. It is in my opinion, the pro per line of feparation between Syria and Cara- mania. The narrow pafs took up an hour in the defcent, and along a dangerous and horrid road ; but affording by the light of the moon, fuch awful and romantic fcenes as might feaft the wildeft imagination. Our poft-boys were unufually concerned for the fafety of our rear, perpetually warning every body not to lag. It was a journey of ftrange delight and confter^a- tion I confefs. By day light we had pafTed the defile, and were got to a pleafant fountain of wa ter in the neighbourhood of fome inhabited lands; but ftill in the mountains, and of a very fufpicious complexion, from the objedls we could difcover about us. We delayed but little, and at eight o'clock (21ft May) we were repof- ing again in a poor man's garden, made and cul tivated for the accommodation of the traveller. It was near a large khan, originally built for the paflage of the troops, and very ufeful to the ca ravans in rainy feafons, but otherwife feldom frequented. From this place it requires an hour's ride to an inferior order of mountains, and among thefe, four hours more to the plain of Adena, extending to the fea. We reached this litua-[ 127 ] fituation at five o'clock in the evening, and feat- ed ourfelves by a fmall refrefhing ftream. It was like the landing-place to our journey's end. We could fee from thence the fea of Scan- deroon, and the mountains beyond it. The city of Aleppo is diftant about two hundred and twenty miles, but we were comforted at the profped of foon arriving at our journey's end. Selim propofed that we fhould go to Tarfus in- flead of Adena, it was a nearer way he faid, if there was a certainty of finding boats, but as that fcheme would only have diminiflied our journey by land to encreafe it by fea, we thought proper to decline it. Our horfes were fo much knock ed up, as to retard our arrival at Adena (17th poft-houfe) till three o'clock in the morning (22d May) the thirteenth day of our departure from Conftantinople. All the way from the foot of the mountains the foil is fine, and well cultivated ; exhibiting extenfive crops of cotton and corn. t Adena is fituated on the banks of the Cyd- nus and Tarfus which I have jufl; mentioned, is famous for being the fcene of Cleopatra's magni ficence, when cited by Anthony to the plains of Cilicia, We\ ^ [ 128 I We entered on the north fide of the town, but could diftinguifli little j it was night, but in iffuing, we palfed over a bridge of fome con- fideration guarded on the town-fide by a tower. During our (hort ftay at Adena, we partook of the pleafure of the hot baths, which to harralfed travellers is a real pleafure, drank plentifully of iced {horbets,eat fome delicate apples, and fmoak- ed our pipes. We were vifited by two Armeni ans, who called themfelves agents to the Englifh ; gentlemen at Aleppo. The country was in great diforder they faid. Ofman Ba£ha, made Balha of Adena, by the intereft of Abdi Baftia, whofe Kiaia he had been, on the point of marching with an army to affift his patron in the redudtion of the rebels who had infefted the environs of Aleppo for many months. They diverted me from going by Scanderoon as I had intended, becaufe they faid no Frank was there j but they did no more than comply with the defire of Se- lim, who was averfe to that route. It was a fcheme they were alfo perfonally interefted in, for wiftiing me to take charge of a bag of five hundred dollars to Aleppo, which I had refufed, becaufe money is a lure for thievesj they pre vailed on Selim to take it, and on me to take the other road, that it might be lefs expofed. ^ Ws[ 129 ] We mounted at five o'clock in the evenlns: for Caradafli on the fea coaft to embark, and about midnight came to a horde or banditti, living in houfes compofed of cane and mud, half under ground and half above, of the mofl thief like appearance I ever beheld. Mr. —— and myfelf were enjoined not to utter a fyllable of Frank, and mute as mice we obeyed. We fpread our carpets upon the top of one of thefe fellow's cells, and refigned ourfelves to lleep. At three o'clock in the morning (23d May) we were roufed, but by our own companions, and fet off again on our journey. We had left the river to our left a little before we came to Ya illah, to purfue its courfe between the moun tains, while we made ftrait over the tops, and met it again at Adena, after the fouthwardmoft chain of mountains had emancipated its reftraints and gave it free career upon the plain. We croffed by the bridge at Adena, and, faw it and its beautiful effedls almofl; the whole length of the plain to the fea. In the latter part of our journey we difturbed great numbers of antelopes and wild boars, as they lay concealed in an ex- tenfive fpace of lofty rye grafs, ferving them both for food and fhelter. There appeared fome Z ruinsC ^s 0 1 ruins of villages on our way to Caradafh, a ten hours march from Adena (I vvlli call this the 18th poft houfe). This is the place of embarkation. It was feven o'clock when we arrived. Fifteen boats had juft landed a caravan of goods from the bay of Seleucia going from Aleppo to Conftantino- ple, and afforded us choice of embarkation. • Whilft Selim bargain'd for the boat, I bathed in the fea, and obferved the fituation to be Cape Malo, forming the north cape of the gulph of Scanderoon. It affords a fmall harbour for boats, being defended by two long flat rocks to the fouthward. Clofe above the beach along fliore runs a confiderable bank of fand, through which a paflage is cut in a diredt line with the center of the port, having a fquare building on an emi nence fronting it, intended to give flidter to paf- fengers and their effects. Near this place, theEnglifh ihip Greyhound was wrecked in the year 1760, and on the ftrand lay one of her guns, a melancholy memento of that misfortune. I was at Cyprus at the time, the (hip had juft before been with us; it was a fubjedt of grief to me then; nor can I help fay ing now, but my forrows are revived. A tt 131 ] At three o'clock in the afternoon we embark- cd* and by the evening had traverfed the gulph and were clofe under Cape Khanzir (hog) the fouth ward moll cape of the gulph of Scanderoone During the night we had a imart thunder ftorm and much rain. In the morning we pailed old Seleucia formerly in the bay of that name, but now of Antioch. The ruins of it fecm to fpread femicircularly round the hills above the porte The Ries, or mailer of the boat told us, it had been an excellent harbour, but that the Turks had deftroyed it : I could have told him the fame ftory with additions and variations, i he bay of Antioch has Cape Khan^ir to the left or N; E. and mount Caffius to the right or S. W. To hit the entrance of the river (Orontes) com ing from the northward, you muft fleer right for the center of the high land of Caffius, which courfe will bring you on the line of contact be tween the fea and river waters. ^ 011 then run eaftward along fliore direct for a little low build ing on the plain marking the entrance to the river, into which we failed for half a mile and landed on its banks. Our Boftangee was on fhore firft, and being an officer on public bufinefs was firft accommodated with horfes. He had tolci us, that he wss upon fome commiffion to the Bafha Z 2 ' o£of Damafcus, and that he fhould go along mount Cailius (which by the bye is an almoft imprac ticable route) to Latachia. In {horthe took his leave and we beftirred ourfelves to follow his example. T he place is now called Sovadee (which I fhall deem the 19th poft houfe) and confifts of a few cane huts. There were quantities of com in heaps near the river as if for fale j and upon a hill to the right appeared a town of little note. Among thefe mountains are various fedlaries of idolaters; fome of them worfhipping the devil as their fupreme being, and offering as the moft acceptable facrifice to his infernal highnefs the blood of a cock. The river abounds in eels, which are caught and falted and carried to Cy prus, and all the circumjacent ports on the coaft. The Greeks and other fedaries of the chriftian church make a demand for this article for their feafons of lent, and a mortification it muft be in my opinion to eat them. The fifhery is farmed of the Ba/ha of Aleppo, and was in the days of my confulary dignity at Cyprus, the property of a dependant of mine. It now belongs to the Hakim Bafliee (or proto medico) of the Baflia. SinceI *33 3 Since Biafs has revolted, and the high road has 'been made impaflable by the ravagesof its ufurpers, this is become the paflage for the Tartars. The Sultan's * Khafnys too, which by an irrevocable law of the empire Ihould be never ventured upon fea, is forced to feek fecurity in this dangerous deviation. Such is the convulfed flate of this once for midable empire. Such the neceffary effeds of a tyrannical fyftem of government. Oppreffion will beget rebellion. In Caramania, and the revolted provinces, you fee the people wearing a robuft and manly afped:; they have afirm empha tic tone of voice ;fpeak as if animated by a love of freedom j live a rude and natural life; poflefs its befi: riches, and a fpirit to defend them! can tyranny go down with thefe ? what has it pro duced ? It is the worft of all bad |&gt;olicy. It op- ^refles its own refources. Opprefllon begets a frefti neceffity of oppreffing. What it extorts to-day will be deficient to-morrow. The end is defeated by the means. Power muft be kept up to enforce violence and to deter refiftance. Wants increafe as the refources diminifli. Au thority will know of no denial, corporal puniih- * Treafurcs. aients[ 134 ] mfints are inflidled and death. Thus the im- poffibility of avoiding, where there is no temper to the evil, forces to defiance. The law of def- potifm is a felf-deftroying principle, infallible, unavoidable. The utmoft in its power is to protradt the evil day. When the members are lopped off which were its fupport, how is this enormous body to ftand ? It muft fall, decay, and perifh. So much for tyranny. We procured horfes and at ten o'clock in the morning we mounted for Antioch. They were fad hacks, but of evil fometimes good (a quelque chofe malheur eft bon) the cruelty of Abdi Bafha had fo far ex panded its terrors as to make this but a mo mentary inconvenience. Selim felt his autho rity reinvigorate under thefe aufpices, and with out entreaty, difmounted the firft poor peafants we met and took their horfes. He flogged them for remonftrating, and that with fuch a mixture of wanton feverity, as hurt me greatly. He thought he pleafed me. On our way, after an hour's ride among hills, we entered a lane hedg ed on each fide, and watered by a rivulet run ning through it. Some mulberry trees by the road fide, made us wifhful of their fruit and in purfuit of it we fell into the garden of a Turk. He1 t 135 1 He was feated by a limpid ftream, in the fhads of a wide fpreading plantane, beguiling the time with puerile amufements, patiently waiting for his dinner. The peculiar hofpitality of thefc people, made us welcome partakers of his fare, which, exclulively of the grateful feafoning lir berality is wont to add, was compofed of plenty and variety. This is one of the agreeable cafu- alties in the chapter of accidents which falls to the lot of travellers. It is the happinefs of me diocrity. Kings are ftrangers to it. But what of thefe Scenes ? They cannot humanize the vi tiated fpirit of Turkifh prerogative. Emin Aga, our humble and pennylefs companion was feized •with the contagion here, and as if the example of the chief was a fandlion for the ilave, began to beat and bully indifcriminately. Antioch is now in view (20th poft houfe). It is fituated at the foot of a barren rock and is encompafled by a wall which embraces the top of it. The Orontes wets the fkirf of the city and has a bridge of tolerable appearance over it leading to a principal gate. The profpedl on this fide is hilly, but beyond it, exhibits a level champain country, capable of the higheft degree of culti vation. We entered the city at fix in the even ing (24th of May) diftrefs was depided in every couri-[ 136 ] countenance. Nothing could we hear of, but the tyrannies of Abdi Bafha, excepting indeed, the heart-heaving fighs with which fuch tales are accompanied. Here we refted till three o'clock in the morn ing (Friday 25th May). The Arabs fay, ' When 4t you hear the ftripes, look to your own back.' A fignificant proverb! And as it turned out, very appofite to the circumftance of my depar ture from Antioch. What I heard indeed, was the prelude to a very tragic fcene, wherein I was unfortunately to be a principal aftor. We mounted, and our road brought us, in about an hour, to one of thofe fountains, which to the honour of the Turks be it faid, are met with where fuch conveniences have been moft wanted; near almoft all the public roads in the Turkifh empire. We difmounted, and here for the firft time on our journey, Selim prayed. As. the circumftance was unufual, I remarked it at the time, and as the cataftrophe which overtook him may juftify fuch a conformity with the com mon opinion, that mankind feel very often a prefentiment or warning of an approaching fate, I venture to afcribe Selim's new devotion to an impreffion of this fort. We rode on from the fountain[ 1 37 3 V | / v fountain towards the iron bridge (a bridge of ftone over the Oroutes, fo called from having the gates cafed with iron) which took us up two hours, debating all the way, which road we Ihould take to Aleppo ; for there is one by Sal- kin, over the mountains, but fafe : and another by Harim, {horter by fix hours, and over the plain, but dangerous. All our inclinations bi- affed to the fhort road, and Selim though he ac knowledged fome danger, and left the option to me, made fo flight of it as to determine me for the plain. I premifed however that our arms ihould be infpedted and made ready for an en counter, but Selim then treated the notion of danger and my propofed precaution with fuch contempt, as to perfuade me there was no ne- ceflity for it, and I negleded it. I thought no more about it, but being arrived at the iron bridge, we halted half an hour to recruit the horfes, and I profited of the time by a nap. My fervant Matthew could not be quite fo eafy. During my feceffion, he had employed all the argument he could think of and his fears could fuggeft, to diffuade Selim from the fhorter route, for he had heard truer reprefentations at Antioch of the danger we had to incur, than had come to our knowledge, or than Selim would confefs'. A a ButBut the decree was gone forth. We croffed ths iron bridge and took the dangerous road. Selirtt was penfive but would not declare his reluctance. He rode on. I could fee his confufion, and was ruminating with mylelf on the folly of meeting danger without preparing at leaft, the arms we had for our defence, when Selim rode up to me. He had juft decided the eonfiia in his breaft, and feeming to rejoice in the trium ph of his rea- fon haftened toaddrefs me. ' We'll not go this road Cogia Why Selim ? ' There are no 'villages in this harim (vile) foad f we'll take ' the other.' Well, do as you pleafe I faid, and in turning from that we were in, to crofs to the other road, we were forced to penetrate among fome very high weed. Before we were well got out of it, we were purfued by four horfemen fcarcely appearing abov6 this weed&gt; calling out to us to furrender or we were dead men. We faced about and told them to keep off. The robbers came within mufquet fhot, flopped, and called to us again to fubmit; but we affedted to refift. Selim drawing his fabre,! in a hedtoring voice called out, your carbines^ your piftolsj fire at thefe fellows. My friend the painter, and my fervant Matthew with my carbine, had rode ofF* I had only one piftol toi [ I 39 ] #efort to, the other had flaftied at the ferpent and had not been reprimed; and with that prefented at the thieves, we received their fire. I thought to follow up their difcharge with an attack; but they were too adroit. They difabled me by a fliot through my right arm, by which my piftol dropped to the ground. Selim was fhot through the head dead upon the fpot, and two horfes were killed. Emin Aga and myfelf remained on Jiorfeback in the field j he with a folitary fabre, and I difabled. What had we to do ? Senfible as we wer# of our danger if the thieves fhould fire again, or attack with the fabre | we had no alternative but to truft to our horfes and if pof- fible to get away. The thieves had not offered to advance while we kept the field, but the mo ment we fet off, having to pafs near them in our retreat, they bore down upon us with their fa- bres held at arm's length in their hands. I was foremoft a few yards, and confequently neareft. The one who had intended for me, by fome im- prcffion which I cannot account for, changed his direction and turned off to Emin, met him, and with one ftroke of the fabre, cut his facg jclofe .under his eyes down to the focket of his Jaws, fo that the all but fever'd part, hung by the fldn upon his breaft, and in this condition A a j was[ Ho ] t was he pulled from his horfe, ftnpped to his fhirt, and left for dead upon the field. My fer- vant Matthew was got fafe back to the iron bridge when I reached it. He appeared with a raoft gloomy look, and when I difmounted and defired him to bind up my wound, with the cloaths and all drenched as they were in blood j he melted into tears. I forgave him for having deferted me in the adtion. The KafFar or guard of the bridge, three in number, and three Delahia or cavalry foldiers of the Bafha, who had feen the affair from the oppofite fide of the river, mounted and affedted to purfue, but another party of thirty thieves appearing upon the plain, they thought it prudent to return. The baggage was carried clear away. I begged them to go in fearch of the poor painter who had fled the contrary way, and could not poflibly have efcaped being cut to pieces, if the thieves had purfued him. In half an hour they found him, and brought him half naked, with the moft woeful countenance I ever beheld; he was feared and did not know that he had got among friends. Emin Agahad been brought in a moment before by the ferugees, his face in the condition I have defcribed it before, hanging down and expofing all the raw and mutilated parts of his jaw and throat. My own misfortune[ Hi ] appeared light, compared with fuch a picture of deformity. His fhirt all covered with gore, a moft horrid fpedlacle. A gangrene fbrmed in the part and killed him after a wretched and too long exiftence of four days. Selim was brought to the bridge, and after a legal inqueft upon his body intended chiefly to determine the orthodoxy of his faith, was buried by the high road, and a flone placed over him fmeared with red. I faw in poor Selim illuftrated the pradlice I had taken notice of in the former part of this narrative, as prevailing in fimilar circumftances all over Turky, but I was fincerely forry to fee it exemplified by fo folemn an inftance of its reality. It was time to paufe a little on my own condition. I Was in no difmay, though it is difficult to imagine a cir- cumftance of more diftradion to the affairs of any man, than this to mine. I had learnt the doc trine of refignation from thepradticeof the Turks, and with them could find folace in a patient fub- miffion to the laws of neceffity, Alla-kerim, faid i, God is great*. It was a queftion with me in. that fituation, whether I fhould go on to Aleppo, and expofe myfelf to the danger of a mortifica tion, by bearing two days fatigue and heat, where * Literall/ merciful, a fur--t H* ] a furgeon was to be found : or return to Antioch, which was near, in the uncertainty of finding any chirurgical affiftance. In this fufpenfe I was pro videntially overtaken by a French gentleman, Monf. de Fonton, interpreter to the French na-* lion at Aleppo. My fervant feeing him approach, exclaimed with joy; here is the French drago man from Scanderoon ! I took him to be fomq Greek, as fuch are ufually employed by our con- fuls upon the fea coaft j and as they are apt to alfume an impertinent intereft in the national differences j I fet him down as unworthy of my notice. When he came up and pretended to commiferate with me on my misfortune. I faid to him very indifferently Je vous fuis bien ob lige' mon ami, mais, nous fommes nous autres, 4nguerre, n' eft ce pas ? meaning that I expedted little from him and to humour the fuppofed cha- radler I had given him, but I was deceived : He was an original Frenchman, humane, well-bred, and whofe brother I was acquainted with at Con- ilantinople. Vous avez tort Monfieur, faid he, de vous imaginez comme ^a. Je ferois fache que la guerre nous rendit fauvage. Vous pouvez vous difpofer de moi. J was compleatly chagrined at the fentiment 1 had uttered, fince it happened to Jbe fo unfortunately applied. Je vous fais milles excufes.t 143 1 excufes, mon cher Monfieur, faid I. Je Re pefifc pas ainfi des Francis, veuillez bien m'en rendre Juftice. Je profiterai de votre fecours, et de vos bontes. He perfuaded me to go on with him to Aleppo, atid without a moment's hefitation, i put my arm in a fling and mounted. It was ten o'clock in the morning and excefiively hot, but I fuffered no depreffion of fpirits nor alteration in the pulfe. We marched four hours to the ufual ferrying place, but the boat and people were gone to avoid the outrages of the Bafha's people, and we had two hours farther to proceed to find it. We crofTed the river, and in three hours more arrived at Salkin (21ft poft-houfe) a confiderable village on the top of a hill. We halted to pafs the night. My friend chofe to fliave, to get rid of fo much of his ghaftlinefs as was added by his grifly beard, and a barber was called. But this barber was a furgeon too, and fo well fkiiled, •from great pradtice, in cafes of (hot wounds, that he would not fliave the painter till he had operated upon me. i confulted Mr. Fonton upoft the fubjedt, and we agreed to let him drefs the wound. , He was dextrous in cutting away the cloaths from my arm. He then prdbed the wound both ways with an iron probe as thick a^ my little finger, and finding no fradlure, pro nounced /[ *44 ] nounced that under his care it would foon be well. He then compofed a mixture of honey, melted butter, (as it is prepared for Turkifh cookery) a quantity of fait, and fome pounded onions, and opening the wound with his probe, poured at leaft half a pint of it through and through. He then bound it up, brought me a clean (hirt from his own wardrobe, and counfelled me to be quite reconciled to my fate. Monf. Fonton was fo good as to fuperintend the kitchen, his fervant having ftaid behind; and produced an excellent foup on which I fupped and compofed myfelf for the night. In the morning at five o'clock, (26th May) we refumed our journey with the fame alacrity as ever. We continued with the fame horfes however, along a chain of mountains and bad roads moft part of our way by the village of Azami to Martevan, where we palfed thenightj and the next morning in four hours march we reached the city of Aleppo. It was upon a Sun day, the 27th day of May, and after a journey of feventeen days inclufive from Conftantinople. Mr. Abbot the conful was at prayers with moft of the gentlemen of the Englilh fadlory, in a chapel in the confulary houfe. I begged not to difturb him, but that Mr, Freer the furgeon might1 145 1 Hiight be defired to ftep out to me. He made his appearance in a moment, and with his kind afliftance and care, on the 15th of July, I was again able to hold the pen for the firft time and to record the fufpendcd account of my journey and difafter. I took up my refidence with Mr. Charles Smith, whofe hofpitality is univerfal with him I calmed my forrows. My firft refolution in thefe moments of tribulation was to take fome fteps to recover my papers which were of infinite con- fequence to my affairs, and by Mr. Smith's ad- yice we had fecourfe to the following meafures,. There is an Arab Chief named Sheik Shaaban, who is generally encamped in the neighbourhood of the robbers and is refpedted by them as a pro digious conjuror and mafter of divination. The truth is, he profits of this reputation to find out by his ingenuity what appears to them, the effedl of infpiration^'. We in the firft place wrote him a letter accompanied with fome prefents* and hoped his good genius would patronize our caufe. Affuring him further, that in that cafe, we {hould anfwer the effeds of his zeal with proper facrifices and offerings. The other mea- * Tarcoman Jonathan Wild. B b fure- ' , - [ H6 ] fure was to fend a letter to Mr. Shell, Brkifli marine fadlor, at Scanderoon, deiiring him to gain the authority of Abd-ul-Rahman Badia of Bylan who was at this time in alliance with the thieves, and to render me with them what good offices were in his power. The return of the meffenger from the Arab brought me a very civil letter, and many of my papers, but thofe of moft con- fequence to me remained behind. Mr. Sholl's applications were not attended with fuccefs,. I then fent another man with promifes of greater prelents to the Arab Chief, and another to the thieves but without efFedl. The man who re turned from the thieves told me that they were purfued in their retreat from committing the robbery, and dropped many things from the horfes which they left on the way. I flattered myfelf from this, that by a diligent fearch, the papers might be recovered, and therefore refolved to make another effort in perfon. Encouraged by this hope, on the 7th of Augufl I departed from Aleppo on an expedition to the thieves. Excursion to Ghiavur Dagh, or mountain of infidels, the nefl of the Curdine robbers. In the opinion that the portmanteau which contained my principal papers was fallen from the[ I 47 ] the horfe and that my only hope was of finding it in the plain where the grafs was grown ex tremely thick and high I had to provide rny- ■felf with fuch efficiencies as feemed mofl: to pro- mife fucccfs in fuch a defperate fearch. K oider , in the fir,ft inPtance, a condudlor of caravans from Aleppo to Scanderoon, and well known to the robbers, was a necellary attendant to efcort us to their haunts; and to prevail on them when there, to trace back the ground they had rode over in their retreat with their booty. Mr. Smith fuggefted to me to take two gyp lies, who, hb exclaimed, have eyes like hawks: and I thought myfelf, that, a couple of fpaniels might be ufeful to traverfe the ground before us ; becaufe, in the firft place, the objedl if they fhould fee it by furprize would let them a barking; or if any fcent remained in the leather, which it is fufceptible of retaining for years, the dogs might difcover it by that means, where human eye could not penetrate. To compleat our outfet, a Delattia oneot theBaflia's horfe guards was thought neceffary to protect us from the fol- diers, as far as it was fafe for him to proceed with us, and unfafe for us to proceed without him, the whole country being in a ftate of warfare. % . B b 2. WithWith this train therefore and my fervant Matthew I took my departure for Ghiavur Dagh at three o'clock in the afternoon. In about four hours we got to a village, deferted, except ing by two or three who remained there, to ga ther in the remaining corn 5 upon our approach they concealed themfelves. We fpread our car pet here, made fome coff turned our horfes into the corn that was treading out, and fmoaked our pipes in expectation as I fuppofed of re- fuming our journey in an hour or two. It was moonlight, and after a reafonable time I would have proceeded, but was oppofed. There is more danger, my guard faid, from the peafants in the night than from- the thieves. We muft wait till day light. At fun rife therefore we mount ed and pafled by fome villages totally abandon ed. At others the harveft was yet treading out, and the inftant we were efpied by the peafants, they retreated to their houfes, armed, and as we came near them, kept us en but. We made ligns of peace to them by waving our garments in the air, and one of them came running up to us to know our will and pleafure. He knew Koider, but was fufpicious of the Delattia. He made a fignal of our neutrality to the village, upon which they laid afide their arms and re ceived /I *49 ] ceived us very kindly. I was not quite eafy un der this hoftile array I confefs, and was led to enquire into the caufe of this univerfal miftruft. •It was owing to the uncommon cruelty of Ahdi Bafha's government. He had affembled troops from all parts to reduce the pretended revolt of Killis and Antab, two principal towns in the neighbourhood of Aleppo, and inftead of pay to thefe mercenaries, he gave them free range over the country for fuftenance and what plunder might fall to their lot in war. It was like de voting the country to general devaftation. They had laid wafte all the rich territory of Aleppo, and otherwife fo barbaroufly ufed the poor pea- fants, as to force them to take arms in felf de fence. Every village we pafled was upon the qui vive, and altogether exhibited fuch dange rous and melancholy proofs of the effeds of def- potifm as is fcarcely to be defcribed. Our De- lattia only ferved to encreafe our danger. We arrived fafely however in fix hours march over craggy rocks, and in continual alarm, to the en campment of Sheik Shaaban. H e received us politely in the area of his tent, entertained us with pipes and coffee, andpromi- fed to give us every affiftance in his power. He isi *5° ] is a venerable old man, not extenuated nor de- prefled by his years, but fedately complacent, talkative, and affable. He declared that he had fent us all the papers that had been found, and that he had permitted no further communica tion with the Bagdafhlees (the name of the tribe of thieves which robbed me) becaufeAb- di Bafhahad proclaimed all to be enemies of the Sultan who Should be found in intercourfe with them. We ftaid till next morning in this ma gician's camp, which was numerous and well .(locked. He had fome good horfes picquetted before his tent, which he expreffed a deal of pride in. His fon, a youth of twenty, was train ing to the wand effeminately dreffed, with large gold ear-rings, and affedling a prodigious fanc- tity and folemnity of manners. In the night we had a little alert from fome pilfering rogues of an inferior order of Arabs, who had crept into the camp and ftolen fome fheep and fowls in fpite of Oberon and all his tribe. Early in the morn ing we took our leave and purfued our journey acrofs the precife fpot of our encounter, marked with the Ikeletons of our horfes which were kil led. We continued on to the iron bridge, and refted there during the heat of the day. Many Turkman encampments were to be feen in the neigh-[ I S i 3 neighbourhood, and many of their people pafled the bridge upon their daily fcout for melons from the cultivated grounds. An affray happened in our prefence, in which one of their party was killed, and fet them all upon the fcout back again, with fell revenge in their looks. I ex- peded to fee fome bloody fcene, but our route laying a different way, for this time I was dif- appointed. At night we refted in a neighbour ing village, and early in the morning arranged our party for the purfuit of the day. A dozen peafants with guns, ourfelves, our dogs and gyp- fies wandered over that part of the plain moil likely to reward our pains, but without effedtj the next day ended as unfuccefsfully, and refol- ved me then to go among the thieves. I hoped that they might ftill have concealed the portmanteau in expedation of a better re ward, and I determined to engage them to dii- cover it at any price. It was my laft hope, and away I went the fame evening to Antioch, paf- fed the night there, and continued in the morn ing my route to the mountains. At ten we reach ed Karamut Khan, the entrance of the defile which leads to Bylan, and guarded by an officer of Abd- ul-Raharn Bafha 's, to oppofe any hoflile attemptattempt from Abdi Bafha's troops. We vvcfe neutral people, and upon an expedition to th® thieves, the allies of Abd-ul-Rahman Bafha, and therefore welcome. This captain of the guard was a ftout fellow and laughed with all his heart, at the threats of Abdi Bafha. He informed us of the fituation of the Bagdafhlees, and in about an hour we proceeded on our way to find them. We were within ten minutes ride of the town of Bylan, when a friend of Koider's met us, and told us the thieves were in a village, half an hour's march from the road fide. I fent him to them to fix the time and place of an interview, which they appointed for the next day, with an invitation to dine. In the mean time I went and lodged at Mr. Sholl's houfe at Bylan; and when the hour of appointment was come, I mounted and repaired to the rendezvous. The fituation was among mountains, and marked by u few detached huts in which they ufually refide r fifteen in number were fitting round the edge of a mat fpread upon the ground. Upon my ap proach they rofe to receive me, but feated them- felves again when I had taken my place. They had every one a gun fling over his fhoulder, and were equipped in the trophies they had won. Some of them had my cloaths on, and others the i 4? \ ^ \t ,iS3 1 % ^ the bloody fpoils of poor Selim and Emin; they were in their eftimation well earned triumphs of their vidtory. My firft falute was, health to my friends! Who can avert the will of fate ? Peace to you, faid they; welcome, welcome. I was then ferved with fome water by one of the thieves to wa(h my hands; and after that came dinner. It confifted of a whole fheep roafled and fluffed with rice and dried raifins ; a large pilo befides, and fome diflies of ragou'd meats, with melons, honey, eggs, onions, and every thing that was palatable. I was not an utter ftranger to this kind of living, and could acquit myfelf in the original ufe of my hands and fingers with fom6 dexterity. This ceremony over, water was again brought, and then pipes and coffee. This was the time for bufinefs, and I addrefTed them. We muft praife God for all things j I come not to upbraid you; the flain are at reft, my wounds arc healed, the fpoil you have divided; I come a fuitor to your favour. On my head, faid one of them, you fhall be fatisfied. Long may you live ! Koider has explained my wifhes to you the papers which are miffing are of great concern to me ; if you know where they are, let me have them. They threw down fome papers of real importance to me. Thanks for thefe faid I, C c haveC I 54 ] have you no more ? By the beard of Koider you fliould have them ! what are papers to us ? you ihould have all the papers in the univerfe for a creilh: but you may have dropt them on the plain, they may be found. Found! the Turkmans are encamped there by thoufands; do they leave any thing ? they have burnt the weed all over the plain. Well God be thanked j I'll fay no more about them. But let me alk you, you lead a happy life here; of how many does your tribe confift ? Two hundred and fifty families. Ab- di Bafha is coming to exterminate you. Exter minate ! faid one of them, and burft into a fit of laughter. Why what refiftance can you make to an whole army ? Our mountain will refift him, befides are there no more thieves do you think than the Bagdafhlees ? You have the greateft renown, what other tribes are there ? Hey ! to fignify innumerable, theCurdes, they are all thieves : there are the Sleikhan, Abbagee, Afh- kurbaglee, Chaillee, Dellibekerlee, Sareefeklee, Kiubanlee, Cutchukallee, Ravidlee, Chakallee, Jourlee, and Azillee, all the way from Bylan to Perfia. Some work to fubdue thefe ! You are brave fellows; but if we meet again ? fear nought, we'll efcort you to the gates of Aleppo. 1 took my leave. We all mounted. They took the[ I 55 ] road down to the plain, and I to Bylan, whence I inftantly difpatched my fervant Matthew with letters to Mr. Smith, begging him to fend me a Tartar with the proper muniments to take me to Conftantinople. Before he could come five days neceflarily elapfed, and in this time I frequently faw the thieves j rode about the country, got acquainted with Abd-ul-Rahman Baflia, and was witnefs during my flay, to the paflfage of that part of the caravan of pilgrims, called the divifion of lelTer Afia, on its way to Mecca. It is the moft fplen- did of any, being generally accompanied by fomc of the Sultan's family, and compofed otherwife of the principal men of the empire. Abd-ul- R haman Ba£ha poffeffes the ftrait of Bylan, where this caravan was unavoidably obliged to pafs^ and which as the Porte had thought fit to treat him with the epithet of Rebel, he had taken care to defend. It became neceffary therefore to negociate for the privilege of going through this ftrait ; and that the credit of their religion, on which the Turkilh government turns as upon a pivot, might receive no indignity, they deemed it politic to lofe no time about it. The Baflia was applied to, and he as readily confented. Not C c 2 to{ 156 ] to be taken by furprize, and to have a pretext for keeping the whole town armed while they remained at or near the place. A public wed ding was folemnized, and all the great men of the caravan defired to aflift at it. There was a prodigious affedation of joy and merriment upon the occafion. The pilgrims who were fuppofed to be feafted, were furrounded by the Baflia's troops, ofcourfenot very eafy in fuch a fituation ; while the Bafha was laughing in his fleeve at the borrowed complacency and fatisfadtion they were conftrained to put on. T hey had pitched their camp at the foot of the mountain, on each fide the rivulet in the vale. Bylan is built on the flope or defcent of a rock that hangs over the town. The lite is at the termination of a cul de fac, formed by a dreadful chafm in the mountain. Before you through the aperture of the rock is the fea. T6 the right and left, rocks and hills of a great height. On the verge of the rock flood my dwelling, befide which ran a conftant llream of water thence rufhing down the precipice, and forming a pool in the valley underneath. A cool inceflant breeze plays round the hills; I was charmed with the beauty of the fcene.

Inftead of tak- ing the road from Antioch to Soyadee^ I came to Byl an, a ten hour's ride, partly upon me plain but chiefly among mountains. From By- lan I went to Byafs, feven hours, along the Tea fide, partly on the ftrand, and partly upon the rocks. From Byafs we continued along the fea fliore nine hours to Kat Callah and from Kat Callah acrofs the plain in twelve hours to Adena. Inftead of going from Bulla Wadin to the ham let I had digrelTed to in coming j I went to Cor- fuff Baflia, and kept the high road all the way from Aleppo to Conftantinople. I had difmifled my fervant Matthew as an ufelefs mobile, and had no companion but my forry decrepid Tartar. I had great rcafon to lament and regret the ab- fence of my honeft friend Selim j but a lively fellow of a Bofnian Tartar, overtaking us upon the road beyond Conia, whip and fpur, and giv ing me a challenge to go on with him; I left my poor[ '58 ] poor wretch to take care of himfelf, and went off full fpeed, travelling night and day to our journey's end. KM. *0* # cjo • ^ n * nyr[ 160 ] rier to Conftantinpple, will travel fafter and cheaper than any gentleman j as will alfo the Tartar couriers from thence to Aleppo and Bag- dadj and when the letters contain any order or information of more than common importance ? to enfure their fafe arrival, a fecond fet of du plicates may be fent to Vienna, and Conftanti- nople, within a week after the departure of the firft. But fometimes it may happen that a per- fon muft be fent by this route, not only to con vey the orders to India, but alfo to carry them into execution j in which cafe he fhould confider whether he is equal to the fatigue of travelling all the way by land to Baffora; if not he fhould go from fome of the ports in the Mediter ranean to Latichea or Alexandretta by fea: the former is unqueftionably the leaft fubjedl to de lays from wind and weather, but then it is alfo by much the moft dangerous, fatiguing, and ex* penfive j befides there are but few men who arc able to bear the fatigue of riding port from Vi enna to Conftantinople, and from thence to Aleppo in the winter feafon j and the paffage by fea may be greatly fhortened by embarking at fome of the ports in the S- E. part of Italy. Upon fumming up therefore all thefe different reafons, we may reafonably conclude; that let terst '61 ] ters fliould be fent to Baflbra all the way by land j but that a gentleman had better go part of the way to Syria by fea. Two days only were al lowed me to prepare for this journey, and there fore in the midft of fettling my own private concerns, I had not leifure toconfider what route I had beft take ;the orders given me were to go by Holland to Venice or Leghorn ; in confe- quence of which I loft many days, which would have been faved if I had followed the abovemen- tioned plan of going farther to the fouthward before I embarked. It muft be entirely unnecelTary to give an ac count of my journey to Leghorn, the way to that city being fo well known ; fuffice it to fay then, that it was performed in eighteen days, notwith- ftanding I went round by Venice, and was de tained near two days on the road firft by the poft-mafter of Gorcum in Holland, who refufed to give us horfes to travel in the night and af terwards by an accident happening to the car riage. The Conful at Leghorn on our arrival there, freighted a Ragufian fnow of 220 tons to convey us to Latichea or Alexandretta, which was ready to receive us on the 27th of September 1778, Dd butt ] but the wind being foul we did not go on board until the 29th at fix in the evening. As this Journal is not intended as a diredlion for mari ners, I fhall put down the time according to the common way of reckoning, that is from twelve at night, and not according to the agronomical day, of twelve at noon. O n the 29th of September, 1778. At night we flood out to fea, and got a tolerable good offing. S eptember 30th. The wind S.

We paffed within twenty yards or lefs of the fhore of Sici ly : the price of the pilotage is not fixed, but depends upon the weather, which being mode rate, we paid only two chequins and a half; they often demand five, and fometimes twenty. Ever fmce the great plague at Meflina, there has been a quarantine of feven days, even between the coafi;[ i6 5 1 coafl: of Calabria and Meffina ; the ufual qua rantine there from the Levant is at leaft forty days, and on the moll: trifling report of a plague, they will not permit any body to land; in which cafe moft veflels go to Malta. The center of the channel bears about E. S. E. and W. N. W. the wind being favourable and the weather fair^ I remained on deck the whole day to enjoy a fuc- ceilion of the moft beautiful views I ever beheld, which would afford a variety of fine lubjedts for our beft landfcape painters. Off Reggio we faw two French xebeques lying at anchor, but they took no notice of us, nor of a Sicilian veffel, though neither of us (hewed our colours. The Sicilian veffels always keep a boat a-ftern, in order to enable the crew to make their efcape if' they fliould fall in with a Barbary corfair; in which cafe they always run the fiaip as near as poffible to the (hore, and taking to the boats, land and fly into the woods: we faw the top of Mount ^tna covered with fmoak, but it has ceafed emitting fire fome years paft. About fix in the evening we got through the ftraits. O ctober 12th. Wind N. W. a pleafant breeze and very fine weather, the fouthermoft part of Sicily in fight bearing S.

In the country near this Cape the women are ftill remarkably beautiful, in other parts of the liland they are rather plain.

Found lying here a French frigate from Malta; in the evening we went on fliore to the Ragu- fian Conful's houfe, whom we enjoined flridl fecrecy, and obliged him before his fervants to treat us as common failors we returned on board again about eight at night. The town is built as other common Turkifh towns are, with bricks dried in the fun. After we went on fhore, a boat from the French frigate went on board our veffel, but did not difcover any thing relating to us. We faw the Englilh Conful on fliore, but he did not know us in our difguife of Italian failors ; and we did not make ourfelves known to' him, left his fervants might publifli our arrival.

At nine at night towed by the boats, we came to an anchor in eight fathom off the entrance of the port. October 29th. In the morning we went on fliore to 'the houfe of Mr. Sciperas, Englifli Vice Conful under Mr. Abbot at Aleppo, to whom weC I 7 1 3 we fent a letter announcing our arrival, and in forming him of our bufinefs. T he prefent city of Latichea lies about a quar ter of a mile from the old port, which in its priftine ftate muft have been a moft expenfive and magnificent work, but is now in ruins; and the ground like that of the new port of Alexandria, fo foul from the blocks of marble and ftone that are fallen into it, as to deftroy the cables of (hips. The adjacent country was once farncms for producing excellent wine, but there is none made now; which as the country ftill produces abundance of grapes, and the Maho- medans would not objedi to their being made into wine; can only be imputed to the ignorance or the indolence of the Chriftians and Jews, who together conftitute the major part of the inhabitants. The tobacco of this country is in very high efteem with the Turks and Arabians, and is now produced in fuch quantities as fupply -the greateft part of the Turkilh em pire ; it is particularly fent to Damietta in Egypt, where it is exchanged for coffee that comes thither from Mocha, and alfo for the rice that grows in the Delta. Was this country under a good government, and were the inha- E e 2 bitants[ 172 ] bitants inclined to be induftrious j with the ad vantages they have of a fertile foil, and a fine climate, they might pofl'efs not only every com fort, but alfo every luxury this world produces: a re mark indeed! equally applicable to almoft the whole of the Turkifh empire, which is unquef- tionably the fineft part, at leaft of the old world. Where nature has been fo bounteous, it is a pity her choiceft gifts have been fo badly bellowed. October 30th. We remained at Latichea getting our baggage on fhore, and fettling ac counts with the captain. Whatleifure time we had both this day and the next was fpent in walking about the city, and examining the en virons of it, in which there are many noble monuments of antiquity in a very ruinous ftate : * towards the S. E. part of the prefent city is a large triumphal arch, fupported on columns of the Corinthian order, and which now makes part of a mofque: the architrave is adorned with antient military trophies, and there are many Greek infcriptions about the different parts of the building; but thefe have probably been much defaced by the Mahomedans. About half a mile north of the city we faw feve- ral fepulchral chambers, in which many ftone coffins[ 173 ] coffins are depofited in fmall niches exadly made to receive them. In the center of one of thefe vaults is a fpring, the water of which is faid to produce very miraculous eftedts; not only cur ing all forts of diforders, but alfo enduing peo ple with the gift of highland fecond fight i the Greeks call it the cavern of St, Tecla. Saturday , November ift. At eight o'clock jn the morning we fat out for Aleppo on horfe- back, with mules to carry the baggage, and ef- corted by two Janizaries j the firft part of the road was a ftrong uneven country: about ten o'clock we croffed a rivulet, and in the forenoon began to enter the hills which are covered with wood ;the road through them is narrow, and the afcents and defcents are fteep, but the horfes being fure-footed and accuftomed to the road, we met not with the leaft accident j the foil is a kind of chalk, and large loofe flones ; the har- veft and vintage had been over fome time, but the peafants brought us fome grapes they were drying for their winter ftock. At three in the afternoon the muleteers flopped near a fmall ho vel, where they demanded a kafar of four dol lars; thediftance from Latichea I fliould fuppofe to be about twenty-five miles. As there was no[ 174 ] no houfe near we were obliged to ileep in the open air by the road fide. November 2d. At two in the morning we proceeded on our journey, and flopped about noon at the town of Chokoor, commonly called Shogre, where the governor ordered us to halt for the night. The caravanfera being dirty we pafled through the town, and lay in an open field to the S. E. of the town, on the banks of the river Orontes. On this day's journey we pafled over many chalk hills refleding a very ftrong heat, but the road was much better than that we had pafled over the preceding day: we faw both to the right and to the left of us many confiderable towns and fome villages, the inha bitants of which brought us great variety of grapes. The town of Chokoor is fituated on the Weft fide of the river Orontes, and is furrounded by a very beautiful country. A man who called himfelf a catholic prieft, but drefled like a Turk, and who fpoke no European language, offered us an apartment in his houfe in the town; but we preferred the field in order to get away early in the morning, before the gates would be open ed. The moon fhining exceedingly bright, at midnight we began to prepare for our departure^ but[ *75 1 but were detained by a'frcfli order from the Go vernor, who fent us word he had information of fome Bedouins being in the road j and that in the morning he fhould fend a guard with fome mo ney to Aleppo, who would alfo efcort us. November 3d. About four o'clock we left Chokoor, accompanied by a large caravan, and efcorted by horfe and foot. At fix in the morn ing we came to a kind of cuftom-houfe, where they receive the kafar; at which place the peo ple made us halt and difmount, till the whole caravan came up to pafs the hills together. We were told the Arabs were polled among the hills in the front, however we faw nothing of them ; two Turkifh horfemen exceedingly well mount ed and armed, who compofed a part of our guard, advanced in front with us to reconnoitre. We were about an hour in paffing the hills j the road over them was exceedingly bad, but afterwards we went through a very fine country, where we faw a great variety of vines, and alfo fig and olive trees. About three o'clock we flopped at the town of Adelip, or Eidlip, at a fmall houfe in the fuburbs: our comrades the Turkifli foldiers had interefi: enough in the town to get us a very excellent pilo and fome fruit, of which without much \t '76 ] much entreaty we prevailed on them to partake; we found them very fociable and ufeful compa nions ; one of them had ferved againft the Ruf fians, and gave us a very good account of the war. ^ - ■' ' ' ' ' ■ . ; p- 1 .... ' . r 4 N ovember 4th. At two in the morning we proceeded on our journey over a very ftoney road, and kept a few hundred yards in front of the ca ravan, until we arrived at Khantaman-j and then about nine o'clock in the morning advanced by ourfelves over a hilly and ftoney country to Alep po. We got thither in about two hours and a half, and our baggage arrived about two hours after us. Some Arabs on bad horfes feeing us without any attendance, endeavoured to terrify us with an account of there being plunderers on the road, but noperfon attempted to moleft us; however Mr. Abbot informed us we had been imprudent in quitting our guards. To attempt giving a defcription of a place fo well known as Aleppo would be ridiculous, es pecially as we had but little leifure for obferva- tion. Dr. Ruffel who refided many years in this city, has written a full and accurate account of it, which I would recommend to the perufal of §very perfon who willies to be acquainted ei ther[ *77 1 ther with the natural hiftory of the country, or the manners and cuftoms of the inhabitants. I fhall principally confine myfelf to a detail of our own proceedings. Upon our arrival we waited on Mr'. Conful Abbot who very kindly invited us to take up our refidence in his houie. When a ftranger comes to remain any time in the city, it is cuf- tomary for every European gentleman in the place to pay him a vifit, which of courfe mufl be returned ; but as we were only fojourners, Mr. Abbot had prevailed on them to difpenfs with this ceremony with refpedt to us. He how ever conftantly invited company to his houfe every day, by which means we had the pleafnrs of feeing all the ladies and gentlemen of the place. The language moft in uie amongft the Europe ans is the Italian j however moft of them fpeak alfo the French and Englifh, and many of the ladies are converfant in modern Greek, Turkiih, and Arabic. The European languages they ac quire from each other, the Greek from the wo men fervants, and Arabic from the inhabitants of the country and their men fervants. Even the children fpeak the major part of thefe lan guages with fluency and corre&lt;5lnefs. The Eu- E f ropeajis[ 178 3 ropeans by a general fubfcription have built a fmail theatre, which they have fitted up with great tafte.* During the winter feafon they per form French and Italian comedies, and even fometimes attempt operas with very great fuccefs; they politely offered to exhibit fome little piece to amufe us, but the houfe being difmantled for the fummer, we could not ftay long enough for them to make the neceffary preparations. We declined accepting all invitations of either din ners or fuppers, but Monfieur Perdriaux, the French conful, would not hear of a refufal, he infilled upon our meeting a fmall private party, which he entertained with great elegance and good humour. T he confuls of all nations always wear the European drefs, but the gentlemen of the fac tories generally put on the Benifh or long Turk- ifli robe, with a hat and wig, which has an un couth not to fay a ridiculous appearance. Surely it would be both more convenient and becoming, either to confine themfelves to the European cloaths, or elfe to adopt entirely thofe of the Turks. The cuftom of wearing the hat in the room with the ladies, ftrikes a ftranger alfo as bsing very extraordinary j but this is done in 90m*[ I 79 ] compliance with the opinions of the Mahomed- ans, who deem it indecent to appear with the head uncovered. As there was no caravan likely to fet out for Baflbra, the Conful was obliged to form a light caravan exprefsly for us. Heat firft agreed with an Arabian Sheickor Chief for an efcort of forty men to fet out in a few days r and the Sheick as ufual was to furnifli camels for carrying our- felves, our baggage and provifions j but a Jew merchant hearing of our intention, offered to double the efcort, provided we would take thirty camels loaded with goods for him to Graine. After fome deliberation his propofals were agreed to, on condition that he would alfo fend two camels for each load of goods j thefe points be ing fettled, a new agreement was drawn up with the Sheick, of which the following is a literal tranflation. 'Tranjlation of a contraSi Suliman for an efcor the Great Defert from &lt;&lt; T his writing is to certify, that we the un derwritten of the tribe of Arabs Nigadi, have F f 2 of \ /t W of Our own free will agreed to accompany and conduft the bearer of this contract.

We the underwritten do promife Colonel Capper, by our own free will and confent, and oblige ourfelves to pay all kafars and giawayez (that is to fay duties) to all the Arabs, and to the Sheick Tamur, the Sheick Tiveini, and all the Sheicks of the tribe of Beni Khaled, and to all other tribes of Arabs whatever j and we make ourfelves refponfible for all what is above-writ ten, and further when we approach the tribe of Arabs called II Aflam, and Shammer and any other tribes, we oblige ourfelves to take from them a refeek to walk with us till we have paffed their confines, WkI 182 ] We agree to carry no goods, or even letters from any other perfon or perfons, excepting th&lt;£ goods from Khwaja Rubens, which are thirty- one loads, for the hire of the faid goods from Khwaja Rubens we have received in full, that is, the hire, the inamalumi, the refeeks, the giawayez, figmaniah, and all other expences to Graine; we have received ofhiminfull, accord ing to the receipt in the hands of the faid Khwaja Rubens ; moreover we have agreed with our free will to provide for the faid thirty-one loads, for every load two camels, in order to keep up with the above-mentioned Colonel Capper, and never feparate from his company till our arrival at Graine ;and we alfo oblige ourfelves to pay the dolleels (fcouts) the maadeb, the birakdar, and the chaous (qfficers of the guards) all the faid perfons we are to pay ourfelves, and not Colonel Capper. We have agreed alfo with our free will, with the faid Colonel Capper, to carry him and his company fafe in thirty-fix days to Graine, from the day we depart from the village of Nayreb; but in cafe the faid Colo'nel Capper fhould be defirous of ftaying to reft a day or more the faid delay is not to be reckoned in the afore- faid thirty-fix days.

I n this manner all caravans that crofs the great defert are formed; that is to fay, an Arab Sheick or Chief of known good charad:er and great ex perience, engages a certain number of refeeks. or alfociates to join'with him in furnifhing the merchants of the different cities with camels, to tranfport their goods from one place to another; and alfo each of the refeeks engages to bring a certain number of armed men to enfure the fafety of the caravan acrofs the defert. The refeeks are taken from different tribes, in order to lelfen the rifque of being attacked j for each of them carries the colour or enfign belonging to his tribe, all which colours are difplayed upon the appears ance of a party on the defert; and if the party belongs to the fame tribe as any of the refeeks, the[ &gt;§5 ] the principal Sheick or Chief of each tribe, having generally half of what each refeek re ceives from the merchants; the caravan of courfe gaffes unmolefted. The firft-mentioned Sheick referves to himfelf the executive power and com mand in chief of the caravan j but in cafes where there is time for deliberation, a council of all the refeeks is called, and the point in debate is fettled by a majority of voices. M any travellers give the Arabs an exceeding bad character, reprefenting them as a faithlefs and rapacious people, in whom no confidence can be repofed. I confefs they do not appear to me in that light; they certainly like moft men endeavour to make the beft bargain they can for themfelves ; buX for my own part, I never found them inclined to exadl more than was juftly their due. My reafons for thinking favorably of them will appear in the courfe of my journal. On the 10th of October, in the morning our baggage, fervants, and camels left Aleppo j and in the morning of the fame day we took leave of our friends, and I am fure on our parts, not without very fenfible concern at leaving fuch an. agreeable fociety. We found our encampment at the village of Nayreb, about fix miles from G g Aleppo,[ 186 ] Aleppo, where the Conful had fent his fervant with a fupper; we paffed the night in an Arabian houfe as agreeably as could be expected all cir- cumftances confidered. On the iith, at day-break in the morning the Conful affembled all the principal Arabs, our fervants, and in fhort all our dependants; and having given them his final inftrudions with pofitive commands to treat us with the greateft refpect, he and his brother returned to Aleppo. Mr. Shaw, one of his clerks flayed to go ano ther ftage with us, in order that we might by his means be fupplied with any thing we might have forgotten, whilft we were in the neigh bourhood of Aleppo. At feven in the morning, we marched, and in nine hours arrived at the ruined village of Haglier; at the diftance of about two miles from it we faw a fait water lake, the length of which appeared to be upwards of ten miles, to the right were fome hills not very bigh» About two miles from Haglier we palTed a large village of houfes, fhaped like bee-hives, near to which we met about fifty Arab horfemen, but they did not offer to molefl us ; the road was good all the way, at four o'clock in the even ing we encamped on a hill. _ r N ovem-[ i8 7 I N ovember 12th. We remained at Hagller to get water and feed the camels, fo that they might travel two or three days without a frefli fupply. As my valet de chambre was fick, I endeavoured to prevail on him to return to Alep po, but he being violently againft it, I did not fendhim awayj however at the fame time nottobe diftrelTed for a fervant I prevailed on Mr. Shaw to leave his man an Armenian who was accuftom- ed to travelling, and who agreed to go with us for one hundred dollars and his expences paid back, Mr. Shaw left us about four o'clock in the afternoon, we had a little rain about eleven o'clock, the wind at S. W. In the evening we were joined by a fmall caravan going to Bagdad. Our own party to pafs the defert now confifted of Major Thomfon, whom I met at Aleppo in his way to India ; Mr. C. Dighton who accom panied me from Europe j Jean Cadeo a French man my valet de chambre; Babeck a cook hired at Aleppo }and Mr. Shaw's fervant an Arme nian, eighty armed Arabs, ten of which were Sheicks or Chiefs, and the reft their fervants and dependants, Khawja Rubens agreeably to his promife fent fixty-two camels for thirty-one loads, and we had nineteen camels for carrying our tents, provifions and water, befides two al- G g 2 ter-[ i88 ] ternately to carry a mohafa. We began our firft day's journey upon camels, to fee how we liked their motion. The walk we found difagreeable, and at firft a great drain on the loins and back, but the amble is like the fame pace of a large horfe and not unpleafant. Cadeo being ill was put into the mohafa. November 13th. At day break we ftruck the tents and began to load the camels, but did not get away from the ground till eight o'clock, when all the caravan began to move : for the firft three hours and a half the road was tolerably good; to the left we faw the S. E. end of the fame fait lake we had feen before. About feven- teen miles from Haglier and two miles to the right of the road perceiving fome ruins we went to look at them, and found the (hell or outer wall of a church built of ftrong black granite without cement; there were four large arches that appeared to have been windows, three to the fouthward and one to the eaftward. Near to this building were alfo the remains of a very large town }the Arabs faid it had been in ruins time immemorial, and was called Afhuck Malhook. At a quurter before three we flopped upon a ri- fing ground, the mountain of Diaram in fight bearing[ i8 9 ] bearing about W. by N. diftant about three miles. On the top of it appeared to be a ruined building, where there is faid to be a well of ex ceeding good water, and much frequented by- thieves. We faw five Antelopes but could not approach near enough to get a fhot at them. November 14th. It rained the greateft part of the day, little wind from S. W. at five in the morning we marched and paffed over an uneven, country, the foil of which is a red gravelly fand full of holes mady by rats and fnakes; we faw alfo feveral fnakes fkins. At two o'clock it be gan to grow cloudy and thunder to the S. W. about four o'clock in the afternoon the ftorm broke upon us with a hard fhower of rain, which continued fome time, and obliged us to pitch #ur tents in a place where there was the appear ance of a caravan of camels having been lately encamped. The ufual mode of encamping is as follows; when the caravan comes to the ground, the camels which carry the tent the provifions and the baggage are drawn up in the centre, and thofe with the bales of merchandize form an outer circle round them, by which means tneir loading makes a kind of rampart j and the camels themfelves having one of their fore legs tied up form[ 19° ] form another outer circle round the goods: but when there is pafture for the camels as there was this day for the firft time fince we left Haglier, after being unloaded they are turned loofe to browze, and before it is dark one of the drivers goes out and makes a noife fomewhat like that made by our herdfmen in calling the cows; on hearing which all the camels come up to him on a full trot, and return to the camp where they are tied together to prevent their ftraying in the sight. Our courfe this day was nearly E. S. E. ■■ ■ ■ ; ■ ■ November 15th, It rained all night, never- thclefs at fix in the morning we marched, but were obliged to halt again at three in the after noon ; we paffed this day over a clay and fandy foil that was very flippery, on which grew furze and long grafs. We killed two fnakes about feven feet long and faw a large flight of wild ducks, which came from the S. W. and flew to wards the N. W. our camp was fituated in a bottom furrounded with fmall hills j on the fum- mit of one to the N. E. is a white building which our Arabs told us was eredled by a man to the memory of his horfe which died near that fpot, after having faved him from falling into the hands of fome Bedouins by whom he was i. • purfued.[ I 9 I ] purfued. About four o'clock we had an alarm and our people took to th^ir arms, the perfona fufpeited proved to be our own feouts. November 16th. The rain continued the greateft part of laft night, and the wind blew pretty frefh from the S. W.' At fix in the morn ing the wind changing to due weft it cleared up, and at feven we marched. We paffed over an hilly uneven country, the foil nearly the fame as yefterday. About nine in the morning we faw fix oftriches at the diftance from us of about half a mile. At one o'clock found the remains of a dead body, the head entire with fome of the hair upon it, one of the arms and both the legs pone, and no flefli on the carcafe; about two hundred yards further lay a blue Arab jacket, our people fuppofed it to be the body of a cou rier fent from Bagdad with difpatches for Alep po, who had been fome time miffing. A little after two in the afternoon we halted and en camped upon a plain furrounded by fmall hills. Our Sheick went to the top of the higheft to look out for Arabs, but faw none he alfo iiti the evening fent twofcouts to the next watering place, which is about fourteen miles diftant, where we are to halt to-morrow to take in a frefh fupply of water. Novem-[ 192 ] N ovember 17. We began our march at a quarter paft feven in the morning, very fine wea ther, fent out fcouts, and quitted the direft road to prevent falling in with an enemy. We pro ceeded over a very uneven conntry, the foil the fame as yefterday. About twelve o'clock we faw the remains of a very large encampment which alarmed our Sheick, and made him collect the caravan to march in clofe order; about two oclock three horfemen appeared on the top of a hill to the right of us. We drew up the men who began their war dance, throwing their mufkets over their heads and fhouting with great vociferation. As we advanced the horfemen retreated, we fhowed our colours and they difplayed theirs, on which our Sheick faid they were not irreconci- leable enemies.. We drew off to the right, and encamped in a ftrong poft, flanked by two marfhes, and covered in the rear by a fmall hill, on which we ftationed ten men : from this hill we could plainly perceive at the diftance of about three miles, an immenfe body of Arabs, which as they had their families and flocks with them, looked like the encampment of the Patriarchs: they firft fent out a detachment of about four hundred men towards us, but finding we were drawn up to receive them, five men only advanc- ' ed[ *93 3 cd from their main body, feemingly with an in tention to treat; on feeing which we alfo fent five of our people to meet them. A fhort con ference enfued, and then both parties came to our camp and were received with great ceremony by our Sheick j they proved to be Bedouins un der the command of Sheick Fadil, amounting altogether including men, women and children to near twenty thoufand. After much negoci- iitidn our Sheifek agreed to pay a tribute of one chequin for every camel carrying merchandize; but he refufed to pay any thing for thofe that carried our tents, baggage, and provifions: thefe terms fettled, the Bedouins promifed to fend a refeek with us, until we were paft all danger of being molefted by any of their detached parties. To the fouthward of us, and about four miles diftant we could plainly perceive the ruined city of Tiaba, but the Sheick advifed us not to vifit it, leaft we fhould be attacked by fome ftragglers from the Bedouin camp. Palmira, or as the Arabs call it Tadmor, is faid to be forty-five miles S. of this place, over the hills. N ovember 18th. Sheick Suliman not hav ing fettled with the Bagdad caravan, what por tion of the Bedouins demand they fhould pay, H h we[ 194 ] we remained at the fame encampment. The Bedouins brought fome camels to fell, for the beft of which they afked twelve chequins : our people purchafed one and killed it to eat; the flefli of the camel being efteemed a dainty, the divilion of it occafioned many difputes among them, nor was it without fome difficulty they were prevented by their Sheicks from fighting for it. One of the Bedouins who was fick, be ing informed we were Europeans, came to afk our advice as phyficians we told him we had no medicines with us, but would writd down his cal^, and if he would carry our prefcription to Aleppo, the gentleman there would give him what was proper to cure him. We accordingly wrote the letter, and the brother of the patient fetout with it next morning exprefs, promifing to deliver it in two days and a half. Thefe Be douins are almoft the only tribe of Arabs, who live according to the primitive limplicity of their anceftors j they never fleep in houfes, nor even enter a town or city, unlefs to purchafe what they want, or to fell what they have to difpofe of. They acknowledge no fuperior but their own Sheicks, nor do they like moft other tribes pay a tribute to any of the Bafhaws belonging to the Ottoman government. In the.fummer feafoaC I 95 ] feafon when the wells and ponds in the defert are almoft dry, for the convenience of feeding and watering their camels and iheep, they always keep near the banks of feme great river: but after the rains they move about from one place to another, feldom remaining on one fpot longer than a week. They compel every perfon they meet with to pay them a tribute; but are feldom guilty of cruelty, unlefs they are refifted, arid any of their companions are killed j in which cafe they are very vindidlive. The year before they fell in with us, they attacked and plundered a caravan going from Damafcus to Bagdad j but their vidlory coft them dear, which perhaps made them more readily liften to overtures of peace from us. November 19th. We marched at half after feven in the morning, and about a mile to the eaftward of our camp paffed by a fpring of warm water, which in colour, tafte, and alfo in heat, greatly refembles that of the Briftol Wells. It is called by the Arabs Ain ul Koum: our Sheick told us there was once an aquedud to convey tfhis water from the fountain head, to an ancient ruined city about fourteen miles from thence, H h 2 called[ J9&lt;5 ] called Keffer al Ackwien, or GufTur ul Bain*, but we faw no traces of it; foon after pafling the well we had a good view of Tiaba, which we faw to the fouthward at the diftance of three miles. The ground we pafled over this day was a tolerable good mould, and capable of produc ing many kinds of grain. About the diflance mentioned by our Sheick, and rather more than a mile to the right of the road we faw Kefler ul Ackwien, which accompanied by our Sheick we went to examine. The building is divided into two fquares, and a paflage between them of about fifty paces wide, each face of the largeft fquare is about two hundred and fifty yards long, and thirty feet high; there are round towers at the diftance of forty yards from each other, the gate is in the centre of the weft front, and a fmall round tower on both fides of the gate. In the interior part of the largeft fquare there is the ruin of a building, and near to it a fubterrane- ous paflage that leads to a kind of a cave or eel- . I / • • * N one of thefe Arabs are able to write, the pronunciation of the names of places on the defert therefore being arbitrary and extremely different, it isalmoll impoflible to afcertain their pro per denomination. Many of the ruins are by the Arabs faid to have been built by a Keffer, which certainly implies fomeof the Carfars, but the other name is generally top much difguifed to be known, lar.[ i97 1 lar. In the S. E. angle of the fquare was a portico of the Corinthian order entire, and the fhafts of fome other columns lying on the ground, the bafes and capitals of which we could not find. The walls are built of a kind of Bath ftone, and the fmaller fquare of the fame materials; the infide of the fmall fquare is a continuation of arches in a ruinous ftate ; round the top of the walls of both the fquares is a kind of a pa rapet made of fmall bricks and mortar, but we could perceive no cement between the flones of the lower wall. We were prevented taking any particular plan or view of this place by the ap pearance of fome ftrange Arabs. Thefe ruins and many others in fight of this place, are pro bably remains of towns and villages, formerly dependant on Palmira. About three o'clock we halted upon a rifing ground, the Bedouins brought fome more camels to fell, but we did not pur- chafe any of them. Our courfe this day was about S. E. November 20th. It feems the Sheick ex pected to be attacked by the Arabs we faw yef- terday neat' ICefler ul Ackwien, and for that reafon kept the centries very alert all night. At feven this morning we marched over rather a[ 198 ] plain country, the foil a light white loom, with rank dried grafs growing on it in clumps; this day we faw a great number of hares and rabbits, of which we killed feveral j at three o'clock we halted, when the caravan came firftto the ground there were a number of antelopes in fight, which immediately fled on our appearance, and we faw no more of them*. In the evening Sheick Suliman defired a hundred and five dol lars to fettle his own accounts with Sheick Fa- dil. Weather fair, the wind at S. S. W. courfe S. E. faw two flocks of iheep and goats, bought one iheep for feven dollars, which we killed immediately, and it proved to be very fat and good; buried without any funeral ceremony an Arab of our party who died yefterday. N ovember aift. We marched at feven this morning over a plain country of light clay, with a kind of fern and furze growing upon it, amongft which we fhot fome hares and rabbits. The A- rabs drefledahare forusin the following manner. They dug a hole about two feet deep in the # A person travelling for curiofity or pleafure Ihould carry with them hawks or greyhounds, and they might eatch plenty of game ; which would be an amufement, and at the fame time very convenient. ground.[ I 99 3 ground, large enough to contain the hare at full length, which they filled with furze, and then fet it on fire ; aft'er the firft parcel of furze was con fumed, they put inafecond; and then a third, until the hole was almoft as hot as an oven : then they put in the lafl: parcel of furze, and without drawing or Ikinning the hare, they placed it on the fire until the flame was extin- guilhed : at laft they covered up the hare with the mould, which had been heaped upon the edge of the hole, fo as to be heated by the fire, and thus they left it until it was fufficiently ba ked. The Arabs eat (kin and flelh together | but we contented ourfelves with the flefli only, which we thought a very favory di(h. We arri ved at our ground, where we encamped about four in the afternoon, our courfe was S. E, eafterly. November 22d. Marched at feven this morning, and in the courfe of the day pafled two hills, but on the whole the country was toler ably plain, we crofled one place that had the appearance of being the bed of a river, but our people differed about its name j the loil in ge neral was a kind of light clay with ftones. We fliot fome hares amongft the furze. At half[ 200 ] s \ ' after three came to our ground at a place called Aim ul Haroof or Juab Kunnum; we found a well in a bottom and rather deep, the water of which was muddy ;weather fair and exceeding ly hot, at noon the wind N. W. courfe S. E. NoivEMBER 23d. Marched at feven this mor ning over an uneven country, the foil, flirubs, &amp;c. the fame as yefterday ; about twelve o'clock we palTed the bed of a river about one hundred and twenty yards wide from the appearance of the weeds and flirubs that grew in it, the water ran from the N. E. to the S. W. it is called Suab, and is faid to be impaffable after heavy rains. We killed fome hares, but faw not fo many as for fome preceding days we alfo faw fome An telopes and Oftriches but at a great diftance. In the morning cloudy to the eaftward, when the fun rofe the Iky looked wild j in the middle of the day the weather was exceedingly hot and in the evening cool, wind about S. E. our courfe S. E. halted at three in the afternoon : the Arabs when the wind blows from this quarter always cover their mouths with a piece of their turbans. November 24th. Marched at feven this morning over a very uneven ftoney country. At twelve halted a few minutes at the bed of a river calledf [ 201 ] called Rutgur. About one o'clock came in fight of fome hills called Manget, they bore about S. E. the country we travelled over till we halted was rather plain and the foil a light mould. Stopped at half after four, the wind N. N. E. the weather fair and the middle of the day very hot, faw a few hares, fent out three fco^ts to reconnoitre the next watering place, at the dif- tance of three days journey, courfe S. E. November 25th. Marched at feven this morning, and at noon the Bagdad caravan fepa- rated from us to proceed to the place of its def- tination, they expeded to come in fight of the Euphrates the next day in the evening; we were very happy to part with them, for they doubt- lefs detained us very much, but we could not get rid of them without quarrelling with the Sheick, who certainly made them pay convoy money. The foil of the country much the fame as yefterday, caught a few hares; about twelve o'clock pafled the bed of a river, halted a quarter before five in the afternoon. Whilft we kept with the Bagdad caravan, I believe we travelled Only at the rate of two miles an hour, but after wards I reckon at the rate of two miles and a half an hour. Our courfe this day was S. E. by E. li No-[ 202 ] November 26th. Laft night was a froft, and the air exceedingly cold, in the morning the wind W. N. W. marched at feven, about eight o'clock faw on a hill to the right of us the ap pearance of a ruin, but we were advifed not to go to examine it. The country we paffed over very much the fame as yeilerday, caught fome hares, halted at four o'clock on the bank of a bed of a rivulet that overflows in the rainy fea- fon. November 27th. Marched at feven this morning, the foil of the country we paffed over was compofed of hard fand and flints, we faw fome hills to the left of us that had the appear ance of ftone, and about three in the afternoon paffed by a deep pit, that looked as if it had been a ftone quarry. At five in the evening halted at Haglet ul Havran, where we found a great number of wells near the furface. When the camels came within half a mile of the place they began of their own accord to run as faft as they could, which the Arabs faid was owing to their fmelling the water, but I am rather in clined to believe fome of the camels knew the place : this was the fifth day they had not drank. The appearance of a large encampment having lately[ 203 ] lately left this place, alarming the Sheick he talked of going the next morning towards Me- flied Aly, which he fays is feven or eight days journey from hence. In the morning the wea ther very cloudy, and the wind at E. but it cleared up towards the evening, and at night it was a froft, courfe E. S. E. November 28th. Remained near the wells till nine o'clock in the morning that the camels mightdrink a fufficient quantity of water, tolaft them three or four days; at half after nine be gan our march, we paffed over a barren country, and halted at five o'clock, about a quarter after ten o'clock in the morning, we paffed the bed of a deep rivulet, when we got over on the other fide, w^ were met by one of our people who had been at Cubeffa to learn news: he brought word that Baffora was certainly evacuated by the Per- fians, and in the poffeffion of the Arabs; alfo that Mahomed Khulleel an Arab, but a pro- feffed deift who had affembled a large body of troops to attack and deftroy Mecca, had been defeated by the troops and allies of the Sherreef. The other fcout did not return with the camels, this man came on foot to us, and faid he did not know where his comrade was gone; in confe- li 2 quenc[ 2 0 4 ] quenceof the Baffora news, the Sheick promifed us we fhould go to Baflbra inftead of Graine. i About twelve o'clock the wind began to blow very ftrong from the N. W. which produced cloudy weather and fome rain ; halted about half paft three o'clock in the evening, courfe E. S. E. November 29th. The wind continued to blow violently and exceedingly cold; we march ed at half after, feven, paffed over a barren coun try, faw to the right of us, at a confiderable diftance flock of (heep : when we firft perceived them they were near the fummit of a hill, which made them look large, and gave them the ap pearance of a party of horfe. About three o'clock we came to a country covered with furze, the fame as we had feen before j caught a few hares, flopt at half after four o'clock in the evening: our Sheir.k who had intelligence of fome Arabs being on the road, fent two men to a village to gain further information about them; the man who returned on foot went again on a camel to fearch for his comrade, the wind continued blowing hard all this day from the N. W. courfe S. E. November 30th. Marched at half paft feven this morning, the wind blowing at N. W. ex ceedingly* [ 205 ] ceedingly cold, we pafled over an uneven coun try with feme few hills of white ftone : the foil in general a land, and fome few hills of white clay, which muft be very flippery in wet wea ther, and confequently dangerous to travel over upon a camel • to the N. E. of us we faw a hill that had the appearance of a ruin. One of the fcouts returned and brought advice that there were fome Arabs near the watering place where we intended to halt the next day, we therefore determined to go another way towards the village of Rahaly; faw three eagles foaring in the air, courie S. E. by E,. December ift. In the middle of laft night a man canie and confirmed the report of our fcouts, he faid he was fent by one of our people, but we detained him leaft he fhould be employed by an enemy: about two o'clock we turned due S. to avoid the above-mentioned Arabs. In the firft part of the day we marched over a confiderable fpace of ground that is overflowed in the rains j we afterwards met with many different kinds of foil, but principally gravel. About four in the afternoon we faw fome hills of white fand to the eaftward of us, near which the Sheick fays, there is exceeding good water, buts 206 but we kept to the fouthward to avoid meeting the Arabs. At noon faw a large herd of goats; this evening two men came into our camp dreff- ed in the fkins of antelopes, whofe principal bufinefs is to kill thofe animals, and to carry their Ikins to the adjacent towns to fell. Halted at fix in the evening,,about ten miles from Ra- haly, which we fhould have reached this night if we had not been obliged to go fo much to the fouthward; the wind weftward, the morning and the evening cool, the middle of the day ex ceedingly hot, the weather fair. December 2d. Marched at feven this morn- after travelling about three hours and a half over loofe fand, came in fight of two large clumps of trees; we drew up the men in good order to march to the town of Rahaly, which is fituated in the middle of a large plain, and furrounded by a vaft number of date trees; about three quarters of a mile to the N. W. of the place, are two large ponds of clear water, which are fupplied by fprings. We firft halted near thefe ponds, but the Sheick advifed us to move nearer the town. It is faid to contain live or fix thoufand inhabitants who carry on a-confi- derable trade with the city of Bagdad, particu larly[ 207 ] larly in dates. The commandant or Arab go vernor, upon our arrival fent us a prefent of preferved dates and bread. We favv feveral large flocks of fheep and goats, and bought a iheep for four dollars j they aflced half a dollar apiece for fmall fowls, which it feems are very fcarce ; the trees in the neighbourhood of the town feem to cover a fpace of near fix miles, but there is no pafture for the cattle, excepting fome fern that grows between the trees ; the foil is a light fand, which perhaps is the reafon the people in gene ral have bad eyes, for when the wind blows vio lently from the s. e. it raifes the fand, and is ' faid to affeft their health as well as their eyes j the fumyel or poifonous wind that blows in July and Auguft comes from that quarter, t/arly in the morning; about a dozen of thofe people who live bycatching of antelopes came intoour camp; in language as well as in features, they appear to be a very diftin£t people from any Arabs I ever faw, by whom they are treated in the fame manner as we treat our gypfies. D ecember 3d. The Sheick being told that a large body of hoftile Arabs were on the road, fent fome people to treat with them, and defired us to remain at Rahaly, until his meflengers returned.[ 208 ] returned. This morning about eleven o'clock, fome of thofe Arabs came into our camp, and two of them ftayed with us as refeeks. One of our fervants (hot two birds fomewhat like a partridge, but rather larger, the breaft of the male bird is covered with black fpots, and the neck entirely black; the plumage of the hen bird is exadtly like that of a hen partridge; the inhabitants of the town we found to be great thieves, they attempted to take every thing they could carry away unobferved. The Sheick dif- patched a man to Mefhed Aly, to fee if there were any other hoftile Arabs in the neighbour hood of that city, and alfo to learn if the Per- fians had abandoned Baflbra ; by their anfwers we were to regulate our march; the weather fair, the morning cold, the wind all the day at N. W. in the evening the weather was remark ably fine, and the air temperate. We gave the governor's brother a prefent of four piaftres, and aBenifh or long gown: this place is remark able for fine greyhounds, we faw feveral in cloathing like our race horfes. December 4th. Marched at feven this morning, the firft two hours we pafled over a light fand, on which grew a number of thorny bufhes[ 20 9 1 buflies and fome furze : about nine in the morn ing we favv a clump of trees to the left, where our people told us there was a fmall town called Ajeb, and to the right of us was a cupola built of ftone, faid to be the tomb of Sheick Huzzar; foon afterwards we paffed over a place that had the appearance of a lake dried up, on the ground of which we found a great quantity of white fait of a bitumenous tafte, it feemed to extend a great way to the N. E, and S. W. We were about an hour and a half in palling over it to the S. E. we then came on a fand and clay in termixed with gravel; about three o'clock we faw another clump of trees to the left of us: about five in the evening halted in a large plain of fand and gravel, and about four miles to the N. W. of a large ruined building, but'it being late when we arrived at our ground, we poft- poned vifiting it until the next morning. The Sheick faid it was formerly built by the Greeks, and is called by the Arabs, Khuttar. Weather fair and wind N. W. ■ , ' ' %J\ \ December 5th. Marched twenty minutes before feven this morning. Accompanied by the Sheick and one of the refeeks, we went to exa mine the ruin mentioned in laft night's journal K k called[ 210 ] called Khuttar, it is fituated on the bank of a bed of a river, which has been, and perhaps ftill is very deep when the frellies come down* The building is a large fquare, furrounded by a wall upwards of thirty-five feet high, and each face of it, fomewhat more than two hundred yards in length, built of rough ftone and mor tar; within the large fquare there is a fmaller one of about one hundred yards each face, and parallel with the outer wall j the interior part of the lefler fquare was divided into a number of chambers and paflages, which being in a very ruinous flate, we could not form any conjedurc what they had been ? we could fee no place where there had been wells or refervoirs of water, but the Sheick told us that water is always found near therfurface. We faw nothing like Grecian architedure, but our people fay it was certainly built by the Greeks: when we were leaving this place we were alarmed by the appearance of fome ftrange Arabs from the N. E. they ap peared as foon as we got clear of the building, but fome of our people with the caravan who had obferved their motions coming to join us, the ftrange Arabs perceiving them, difappeared; at eleven o'clock we pafled by two fmall pools of water, which were clear but extremely brack- ifli:[ 211 ] i(li : at half after four we halted, the country we paffed over was fandy, and in fome places mixed with clay j about half after three we faw a number of hillocks of land both to the right and to the left of us, Khuttar remained in fight, until half an hour before we encamped. Six men on camels and feven on foot came and en camped near us j it appeared they were the fame people that we faw in the morning, and were well known to be thieves. In the morning the wind at eaft and very cold, the weather fair; difpatched another meffenger this evening to Mefhed Aly for intelligence. December 6th. Marched at a quarter be fore feven this morning, and left the people be hind that encamped near us laft night j they mentioned to Sheick Suliman that a French gentleman going to BalTora, had been attacked and plundered j and although much wounded was likely to live ; they faid the Arabs carried him to Graine, and likewife that the gentleman behaved very gallantly, and killed two or three of their people himfelf. The foil of the coun try over which we paffed till twelve o'clock was a light fand with fome bulhes, and a few fmall hills to the right and left of us: a quarter be- K k 2 fGfefore twelve we arrived at a place called Hidia, where there was a pool of water, furrounded with high grafs; we filled a few fkins with the water, v/hich was clear, but very brackifh j af terwards paffed over a country, the foil of which was mud impregnated with fait, there were banks of fand to the right and left of us. At the dif- tance of about twelve miles E. by N. we faw the town of Mefhed, or rather Mefgid Aly, that is the mofque or burying place of Aly, who it is well-known was the fon-in-law of Mahomed, and the favorite prophet of the Perfians. At a quarter before five we encamped near a place called Birket Rahama, wind E. S. E. weather fain One of our fervants obferving a young camel without an owner, we fent out a man who brought it into our camp. D ecember 7th. Marched rather before feven, the foil over which we pafled was fand with thick bulhes, faw at the diftance of about ten miles to the N.E. the town of Mefgid Aly; we could plainly perceive feveral minarets, and a large gilt cupola; our Arabs fay the latter belongs to the Mefgid or great mofque of that city; it ap peared to us with great advantage, for the fun fhone on it, and made it appear extremely bril liant :[ 213 ] 4 liant: as well as we could judge of the fize of the cupola at fo great adiftance, it cannot be lefs than the dome of St. Paul's. About twelve o'clock we came to a hill, on which were ereded two fmall forts, the place is called Alathe. At the diftance of three quarters of a mile from the Weftward fort is a fpring of water, which is con veyed to the fort by a deep ditch, and is there raifed by means of a wheel to water a fmall gar den lately made about the fort, and planted with a great number of radiflies and onions: the largeft fort is a fquare about ninety yards each face, at each angle is a round tower built of mud, the infide is a ftone building- of two ftories high, built in the Mahcjmedan ftile: this place was founded by our Sheick, who propofes living here when age and infirmities compel him to retire. He feems to expedl to lay the foundation of a very large town here, which, as there is plenty of water and a good foil of a light mould, for the purpofes of agriculture and gardening; and above all its being fituated in the high road from Mef- gid Aly to Baffora, and other places near the defert, is a very reafonable expeflation. A ca ravan that lately paffed, which came from Graine, and was going to Bagdad told the people in the fort, that the Montifeek Arabs have had a great battle■ [ 214 I battle with the Perfians near Baffora, in which they cut off the whole Perfian army, and there by repoflefled theinfelves of Baflbra, the wind N. E. the weather fair, our courfe about S. E. by S. bought a ftieep, and paid three dollars and a half for it. D ecember 8th. Marched at a quarter before feven this morning over a barren ftoney country, killed a few hares, faw at the diftance of about ten miles N. E. of us the town of Gurgam an ancient city rebuilding. About two in the after noon paffed over a hill of red gravel, and at half after four halted in a valley where there was but very little pafture for the camels. About eight in the evening ourcentinels being ported as ufual, one of thofe to the weftward difcovered five horfemen who fled the inftant he fired at them. We doubled our guards and kept under arms for a few hours in expeftation of their attacking us with a reinforcement. The meflenger from Melhed Aly not returned, nor the people that were miffing from the firft place; the wind at E. morning cold, middle of the day exceedingly ^kot, the wind in the afternoon at N. E. D ecember 9th. Marched at feven this morn* jng, dark and cloudy to the N. W, and the wind[ 2I 5 ] wind from that quarter: the firfl: three hours, a, very barren foil, hard find and large dark brown foft flones, afterwards came to a hard fand and a great many (hrubsj half after four halted, kil led fome hares, the weather cloudy and hazy, to the N. W. we faw a fire which they told us was on the banks of the Euphrates.—Major Thompfon about noon miffed his watch, but havins: looked at it about ten o'clock, he fent one of the Arabs back to fearch for it, telling him within what diftance it mufl: have fallen the fellow very honeftly brought it, nor was it broken. 8 ■' , . v December 10th. Marched at feven this morning, paffed over a very barren country, faw to the left of us three large volumes of fmoke from the banks of the Euphrates, which the Sheick faid was fifteen miles diftance : at a quar ter paft twelve halted for half an hour near fomd wells of tolerable good water, until two o'clock the foil continued barren, then got amongfl fome hills of light fand and broken Hones. At four o'clock a large body of Arabs appeared to the right, who feemed inclined to attack us, our people immediately halted and drew up towards the enemy. Some few fhot were fired, but a[ 2l6] man advanced waving a cloth in his hand, and began a treaty with our Sheick who went to meet him, which put an end to hoftilities: our people were of different opinions concerning them, fome inlifted on their being thieves who intended to attack us in the night; the Sheick himfelf though he called them friends advifed us not to pitch our tents, and alfo to be on our guard all night. We were encamped half a mile diftant from the new comers, our own camels and bae- gage were drawn up in as fmall a circle as pof- fible ;our fufpedled enemies were divided into two camps, one to the weftward and the other, to the fouthward, wind wefterly and weather fair. f ' ■ December nth. The fuppofed thieves re mained quiet all night in their camps with fires lighted j at half after fix we began loading our camels, but did not move till half after feven : we judged it prudent to divide our men into two parties, one of them to march in front of the camels, and the other to bring up the rear. The firft two hours the foil was fand with furze, and then a barren ftoney country ; afterwards a fand with furze and in fome places large fpots that looked like a pond dried up in fummer. Rather before one in the afternoon we came to fome wells[ 2I 7 ] vrells and alfo a large pond of brackifli water j from thence proceeded over the fame fort of coun try and foil as before till near fivej and then en camped for the night: cloudy to the N. E. and S. W. a little rain between two and three in the morning; fix of the party we faw laft night joined us on the march, and were received with great cordiality by our people. D ecember 12th. Marched rather before feven this morning and paffed over a light fand mixt with fait, a great quantity of furze and fome bufhes; the latter part of the day the fand lay in great heaps or ledges ; halted at four o'clock in a bottom; from an afcent near the camp we faw a ruin called Couria, about five miles to the fouthward, with a glafs we could perceive it was a fquare building with round towers: the morn ing and evening were cool, but the middle of the day was very hot, the wind variable; the water we got yefterday brackifh and exceedingly bad. At ten o'clock at night we difpatched a letter to Mr. Latouche at Baflbra, to inform him of our being on the way, and defiring him to detain any vel- fel that might be ready to go to Bombay} one L1 ofI 218 J of the Arabs that joined us yefterday was feleiled by the Sheick to carry the letter*. D ecember 13th. Marched at feven this morning over a very uneven country, the foil a light and deep fand. About four,miles from our laft, night's encampment, we faw the track of a great number of camels and afles, which our people fufpedted to have been the en campment of a body of thieves. We turned off immediately due E. and pafled over a deep land, and a country covered with fand and bulhes; in fome places the ground was co vered with dried mud and fand, which by the heat of the fun was hardened fo as to appear like broken tiles ;'there was no appearance of a road. About two o'clock we obferved two people at fome diftance from us, and fent three of our men after them, who took one of their camels and brought it to us, but the people efcaped. At four o'clock halted at a place where there were a number of fprings, but not much water i IE, * D id not the Arabs much to their honour confider their faith once pledged as inviolable, they would not- in this manner put themfelves in the power of flrangers, who but an inllant before were in arms againft them. The man delivered the letter exadly at the time prefcribed and brought an anfwer, for which he was paid ten dollars, inI219 ] in the wells; this evening for the firft time We caught a defert rat, of which we bad feen a great numberj it is an animal that refembles very much afmall rabbit both in Hi ape and colour, the body- is about the fize of a fmall mole, the tail three times the length of the body, the point of which is covered with a frhall bufli of hair; the eyes * are large, full and black, the hind legs remark ably long. Weather fair, wind S. E. and very hot; paid the Sheick one hundred and ten dol lars, the laft payment of the five hundred kept for difburfements on the road. December 14th. Rained at two o'clock in the morning: marched at feven this morning over a plain country, a cold breeze from the s. E. and cloudy, halted at four o'clock. Courfe S. E. December 15th. Marched at feven this morning over a country of lignt fand and moftly barren; at nine in the morning law a man on a camel, who told us he was a meffenger going to the Sheick of the Montiffeeks from Sheick, Sidon; he alfo informed us that BalTora was ftill in the hand of the Perfians. la the evening we per ceived fome men on camels to the northward, but they did not come near us; we fuppoied them to LI 2 be t[ 220 ] be of the fame tribe as the man that paffed in the morning; halted at five o'clock. Weathercloudy and feme few drops of rain, wind W. N. W. and very cold, courfe S. E. by E. December 16th. Lightning to the N. E. marched at half after feven this morning, in a verydirty thickfog that cameonabout oneo'clock in the morning from the N. E. feparated from the caravan belonging to Khwaja Rubens, which went to Graine, and we proceeded towards Baf- fora with only fixteen men and nineteen camels. Our Sheick gave all the water to the other party, thinking we fhould arrive in the evening at the village of Coebda; but he was miftaken in the diftance; for although we kept moving on till ten, we were obliged to pafs the night very un comfortably for want of fomething to drink: the very great concern exprelfed by the good old Sheick prevented our reproaching him for his imprudence; he offered to ride all night to fearch for water, but of courfe we did not allow him to fatigue himfelf. D ecember 17th. A violent fog came on again laft night, and continued fo heavy as to foak through the tent. Early in the night before the fog came on, we faw three or four fires, appa rently[ 221 ] fently at the diftance of three or four miles to the E. N. E. the Sheick informed us they were on the banks of the Euphrates. Marched at day-break, and at half an hour after nine cam® to the village of Coebda, which had been ruined by the Perfians j here we got fome good water, at leaft it appeared fo to us who had not tafted any for more than twenty-four hours. We alio met at Coebda the perfon we had fent with the letter to Baffora, who brought an anfwer from Mr. Latouche. About one o'clock we arrived at Zebeer, another place which had alfo been de- ftroyed by the Perfians. In the evening Mr. Latouche, by a fecond meflenger informed us, that in the morning he fliould fend us mules and an efcort; for as hoftilities ftill continued be tween the Arabs and the Perfians, our efcort could not accompany us any further: the wea ther cleared up a little about noon, but was not quite clear until the evening. We pitched our tents amongft the ruins of Zebeer, and ftationed an advanced picquet in front towards BaiTora to guard again ft being furprifed by the Perfians; nor can this precaution be deemed unnecefTary, confidering the violent animofity that fubfifted between the two nations, of which the follow ing relation will fufficiently explain the caufe. 0 When[ 222 ] W hen the Perfians took Baffora, they ap pointed Aly Mahomed governor of it, leaving with him agarrifon of feven thoufand five hun dred men. Although he was fuch a monfter, as is only to be found amidft the ruins of a coun- tryj he had art enough to conceal his diipofition, until by an affedted moderation, he had thrown the inhabitants of the adjacent towns and villa ges oft their guard. In about two months how ever, he broke out, beginning his excefles in the city of Baflbra itfelf. The firft victim of his luft was the daughter of an Arabian phyfician, the fame of whole beauty having reached him, he caufed her to be brought to his houfe, where he kept her for three days, and then turned her out of doors, expofed to the inlults of the mob. The father had followed his daughter to the houfe of the ravifher when (he was torn from him, and had never quitted his door; fo that he was the fxrfl perfon to receive her when (he was again difmiffed. He conduded her home, intending on the way, in compliance with the cufloms of his country to put her to death; but before he could execute his intentions, his affedjon for his only child prevailed over his regard to cuftom; and he determined, not only to fave her life, but alfo as much as poffible by marriage, to wipe out[ 22 3 1 the llain her reputation had received. He was rich and much refpecfled in the city, which added to the beauty of the girl, enabled him to get a huihand for her; not entirely equal to her proper rank, and former pretenfionsj but at the fame time greatly above the vulgar. The celebration of fuch a wedding could not fail to make a great noife, and of courfe was foon known to-the tyrant: whilft he continued fober the news of it feemed neither to afford him pleafure or pain; but in the firft fit of intoxication, he fent for the father, the hufband and the wife, and afked them how they durft prefume to difpofe of a perfon devoted to his pleafure ? without waiting to re ceive their anfwer, he made one of his guards cut off the heads of the father, and the hufband, and then compelled the woman to bring water to waih their blood off th6 hands of the execu tioner; nor did he ftop here, but the fequel of his condudt was not only too fhocking, but alfo too indecent to be related. N otwithstanding fuch unheard of bar barity, the major part of the inhabitants of Ze- beer and Coebda were fo infatuated as to con tinue to live within twelve miles of him; im prudently relying on the faith of one who had thus[ 224 ] thus publicly violated all laws, both divine and human. A few, and but very few of the moll prudent of them had left either of thefe placesj when one night in a fit of drunkennefs, and in- ftigated by avarice, Aly Mahomed marched from Baffora with a body of troops and burnt Zebeer j at the fame time putting to death all thofe who attempted to efcape from the flames: from thence he marched to Coebda, where he a£ted in the fame manner, and then returned to Baflbra; ex ulting as much in having treacheroufly maffacred, in cold blood, a number of defencelefs people, as if he had obtained a glorious vidory over a powerful army. S ubmissive as the fubjefts of defpotic go vernments generally are, even under the heavieft oppreffions; the inhabitants of Baffora would certainly have revolted againft the governor, had not the city been almofl: depopulated, both by plague and famine before it fell into the hands of the Perfians. The few wretched inhabitants who furvived thefe dreadful calamities, could neither refift their tyrant, nor efcape from him; their number was too fmall to hope for fuccefs againft his force, and to remove from the city was impoflible: they were therefore almoft re duced . gr . i , £J I *v '[ 2Z S ] duced to defpair when the gallant tribe of Arabs called MontifFeeks determined to refcue them from fuch a dreadful fituation. ii &gt; . v..' » i = 0 \ v-; ■ v • ' • . , . . , f . ' ^ Sheick Tamur , the chief of this tribe having colleiled an army of about fifteen thoufand men, advanced with a feledt party of about two thou fand horfe within fight of the walls of Baffora ; the remainder he left about fifteen miles in the rear, concealed in a wadi, or water courfe, near the river Euphrates which place the Arabs def- tined for the fcene of adiion; for befides the Euphrates to the Baft, and the water courfe to the North, there was a deep morafs to the Souths Aly Mahomed who did not want for perfonal courage, no fooner perceived his enemies near Baflbra, than he marched out with five thoufand chofen troops to attack them j the Arabs retreat- 1 ed towards their ambufcade, and were followed by the Perfians. When the Sheick perceived the Perfians had got between the water courfe and the morafs, he fallied out of the place of his con cealment j and with a part of the troops having clofed up the only opening to the Weftward, he charged them fword in hand, in which being alfo well feconded by the other detachment, which had decoyed them towards the ambufcade, they together put every man of the Perfians to M m death.[ 226 ] death, not leaving one alive to carry back the news of their defeat. By an over-fight, very difficult to be accounted for, Sheick Tamur ne- gledted to purfue his vidlory, and march diredtly to Baflbra, of which doubtlefs he would have eafily made himfelf mafter for Aly Mahomed had left only a fmall garrifon in it, who would neither have had ftrength or fpirit enough to have made any refiftance. This account we re ceived fcom one of the former inhabitants of Ze- beer, whom we found employed in fearching among the ruins for what might have efcaped the hands of the Perfians, when they plundered and deftroyed the place. i itli JO In the evening we fettled accounts with the Sheick, and fo far from finding him mercenary and felfifli as thefe people are generally repre- fented j he behaved to us with a politenefs and liberality that would have done honour to the moft polifhed European, It will be remembered that by our written agreement at Aleppo, I was to give him five hundred dollars on the road, and eight hundred more on our arrival at Graine: the former fum therefore I kept ready to be paid to his order ;but the latter I counted and fealed up in a bag to prevent any of them being loft or miflaid.[ 22 7 1 miflaid. When this bag was brought, as I was going to open it, the Sheick flopped me; afking if it had been counted and fealed up in my pre- fence: and when I anfwered in the affirmative, with a carelefs unaffected air, befpeaking no me rit from the aftion, he threw it over his fhoulder and ordered his fervant to put it into his trunk. The reader will eafily believe that this mark of his confidence gave me no fmall fatisfadlion it was the more flriking from our fituation j for had I deceived him, he durfl not have followed me to BafTora to demand redrefs. But left the mention of this trait of Arabian politenefs fhould be imputed to vanity; I fhall at the conclufion of this work endeavour to account for the good underftanding fubfifling between us, and alfo to explain the caufes of the difputes which too often happen between the Europeans and the Arabs. ' December 18th. At eleven o'clock the mules arrived from BafTora, efcorted by tea fepoys belong ing to the fadtory; after taking leave of the Arabs, with mutual profeffions of friendfhip; and a requeft from our honeft Sheick, that we would lend foi him to accompany us if ever we paffed that way again, we left Zebeer. Mm 2 Ast 22^ ] As the fepoys were on foot, and moved flowly, we left them with the baggage and rode on towards Baffora. About half way we were met by Mr. Abraham and Mr. Gaily, two of the company's fervants, who very politely came to meet and con- dud: us to the Engli/h faftory, at which we arrived rather before three in the afternoon : the appear ance of Baffora was exceedingly gloomy, having as I have before obferved been almofl depopulated by a plague, a fiege, and a famine. In the year 1772, there was fuppofed to be upwards of four hundred thoufand inhabitants in the place, and on the day of our arrival, there were certainly not more than fix thoufand, including the Perfians; the principal ftreets were like a burying ground, with fcarcely a Ipacevof three feet between each grave. D ecember 19 th. Mr. Latouche endeavoured to get a country boat to convey us to Mufcat, but he could not procure one without fending to Bun der Reeg, or Bunder Aboufliaher; called by us Bunder Bulhire. December ,20th. The difficulty of procuring a boat was increafed by an order fent from Shiras, to detain all boats for the ufe of the troops in their march to reinforce the garrifbn. This day we rode about the city, which in every part of it wore the lame[ 229 ] ' fame gloomy appearance. The few Arabian inha bitants that remain fhewed great refpeit to Mr. Latouche as he paffed along'the ftreets, on account of his generoli ty and humanity towards them and their countrymen; one hundred and fifty of whom, after the reduction of the place he redeemed from flavery, at his own private expence, and lent to their relations in the country: an adion that does honour to him, and even to the country that gave him birth. it * T ^ ^ December 21ft. News came that theSheick of Julfa had taken a veflel belonging to Bombay, and fold the crew and palfengers for flaves : this intelligence induced the gentlemen here to advife us to flay for a fhip, as in country boats they thought we rifqued falling alfo into the Sheick's hands who might treat us in the fame manner but we were not at liberty to flay, having promifed before we left England not to wait for a fhip, if a boat could be procured. December 2 2d. The fame difficulties flill continued about procuring a boat, but before the end of the month, we were promifed what is cal led a doa, which is a boat of twenty or thirty tons burthen, fewed with coir rope. The boats in which the inhabitants crofs the Euphrates, to and fromf 230 3 ! the city are nothing more than large round wicker bafkets lined with leather; in which they carry not only men, but alio horfes, and Ibmetimes ca mels. ' December 23d. Enquiring into the fuppofed caufe of the plague that had almoft depopulated this unfortunate city, I found it was in general im puted to an extraordinary inundation of the river, which left a great quantity of fifh on the defert, and thofe filh becoming putrid, infeding the air. In riding about the environs of the city we faw an immenfe quantity of filh-bones ftill lying on the ground. The plague generally rages with moft violence in Turky and Egypt; in March and April, at which time the weather is extremely hot. As heat feems to increafe the virulence of this difor- der; as the weather is hotter in Hindoftan than it is in Turky; as the inhabitants alfo profefs the fame religion, obferve the fame cuftoms, eat the fame food, live in cities built in the fame mannerj and alfo in houfes formed of the lame materials&gt; it is furprizing that the inhabitants of India have ne ver been afflidled with this dreadful diforder; nor indeed can I find that it has ever been known within the Tropics, not even in Arabia Felix. So far from ufing uncommon precautions to guard againft the[ 231 J the infection; when the plague had depopulated Bailbra, the fhips coming from thence performed only five or fix days quarantine on their arrival at any of the ports of India. I do not fcruple to ac knowledge that thefe hints are thrown out with a view to prevail on fome humane and enlightened philofopher to turn his thoughts to the inveftiga- tion of this matter. If the plague has never reached India, nor has even been known in the northern parts of Europe for many years pafl; might not fome reafon be afligned for it's ftill continuing to rage in the milder climates between the two ex tremes ? Could this dreadful diforder be driven from the face of the earth, which in my poor opi nion is not impoffible j a number of valuable lives would annually be laved, and the Levant would no longer be embarrafled with the tedious forms of a long quarantine. Befides an eafy communica tion being once opened between thofe countries and Europe; it is to be hoped the abfurd prejudices which have fo long rendered the Chriftians and Mahomedans hoftile to each other, would die away; and that real philanthrophy, and univerfal urbanity, would fucceed to favage perfecution, and groundlefs hatred. D ecem-[ 232 ] December 24th. At five o'clock in the after noon, Saduc Khan entered the city, at the head of about four thoufand horfe. His men were ilout and well-made, but they were miferably dreffedand accoutred. The Prince himfelf is a very handforrie man; as indeed are moll of the Perfians of diftinc- tion, being the offspring of the handfomeft wo men of Georgia and Circaffia, as well as of their own country. December 25th. Early this morning the piafter of a doa came to treat with us for his boat; at firll he was very exorbitant in his demand j but at length became more reafonable, and promifed to make it ready without delay. It being Ch rift- mas-day Mr. Latouche invited moft of the Chrif- tian gentlemen to an entertainment at the fadtory: amongft which we found fome of the Catholic mif- fionaries very converfable agreeable men. Al though no epicure, I cannot help remarking that the flelh of the wild hog which was one of the diflies we had for dinner, was by far the fineft meat I ever tailed, which is probably owing to its feed ing entirely upon dates. ' December 26, 27, and 28th. Making pre parations for our voyage, the Nakhuda or Captain promifed to fail before new year's day. Decem*[ 2 33 ] December 29th. The Nakhuda called this morning, and faid he fhould weigh anchor the next day with the ebb, which made about two o'clock in the afternoon. December 30th, About two o'clock we left the factory accompanied with the gentlemen be longing to it, who during our ftay at Baffora con- ftantly treated us with the greateft politenefs and hofpitality: they remained a little time on board the doa and then took leave; as they went out of the boat we weighed anchor with a light breeze at N. W. and the tide in ©ur favour: in the morning we came to an anchor again at Aboo ul Khufeeb, where we remained to get wood, rice and dates, which are remarkable cheap and good at this place; Major Thomfon ftayed behind at Baffora. December 31ft. Remained at anchor until one o'clock, then weighed, the wind at N. W. at twelve o'clock the wind dying away and the tide againft us, we came to again: The river is about a mile and a quarter wide all the way from Baffora, and planted on both fides with date trees, amongft which a few towns and villages are interfperfed, which have a very pleafing effedt. We faw great numbers of wild ducks, and other water-fowl on the river, but could not get within gun-fhot of N n them.* [ 2 34 ] them. At four in the evening we weighed anchor, and palled the mouth of a river to the Eaftward, which they faid was the boundary of the BalTora country, and the beginning of the Shaub. January ift, 1779. Weighed at fix this morning with a light breeze at N. N. W. at day break we loll fight of the land, fleered till twelve o'clock, E. S. E. then afterwards E. by N. by an obfervation found ourfelves in the latitude of 29. 41. North, the weather rather cloudy we paffed feveral boats going towards the mouth of the river. January 2d. The wind at N. W. and the weather fair; about ten o'clock we faw the land bearing South, and about one o'clock paffed Cape Bang. On the mountains of Bang, there appeared a large fort, which our people faid was built by the Greeks, and before it was in ruins was deemed im pregnable. January 3d. In the night the wind blew ex ceedingly hard with a high fea; the fail having been torn by the violence of the wind we lay to, whilft they cut it up to half its former fize. At day break we made fail again, but the fail being torn a fecond time, and alfo the rudder damaged, we came to an anchor off Bunder Reeg, about three miles£ ^35 J miles from the fliore. We wanted to get into that place, but we had overihot the port; and were therefore obliged to ftand on towards Bunder Abou- ihaher, called by the Europeans Bunder Bufhir. As the wind blew frefh, and the fea ran high, for want of a fail and a rudder the boat was feveral times in danger of filling. In the afternoon the wind moderated, and at four in the evening finding ourfelves off Aboufhaher, we flood into the road, and went on £hore to our factory, where Mr. Beau mont the refident received us with the greateft po ll tenefs. January 4th. The doa came into the har bour; on examining her we found that Ihe not only wanted all kinds of ftores, but alfo that her rudder was entirely deftroyed; the wind blew ftrong from the fouthward. January 5th. Finding the captain dilatoiy in purchafing ftores and necelfaries for the voyage, we threatened to buy them for him, and to deduft the price of them out,of the balance of freight, which he was to receive at Mufcat; to avoid which he himfelf bought an anchor ftock, fome Ipare rope, and two fmall fails, the wind at S. E. the weather cloudy with rain. N n 2 Janu-[ 2 3 6 I January 6th. The Nakhuda continued re pairing his doa, and promifed to be ready in the evening j v/ind and weather as yefterday. I made fome eaquiries of a man who had been at Perfepo- lis, concerning the prefent ftate of the ruins of that city; he called it Tuckta Jumfhid, and faid that there are only a few pillars and arches left, which are almoft covered with bufhes. The Grecian name of Perfepolis was totally unknown to him; he reckoned it about one hundred and twenty miles from Aboulhaher. Finding this man equally in- intelligent and communicative, I enquired of him alfo the prefent ftate of the modern cities, and in deed of the empire in general: he informed me that lipahan, or as he called it Isfahan, was now al moft entirely deferted; the feat of Government being transferred to Shiras, where Kerreem Khan the prefent Sovereign, or as he calls himfelf, the protestor, refides. Kerreem Khan was one of the ableft Generals of the famous Nadir Shah, better known in Europe, by the name of Kouli Khanj when his majfter was affaffinated, Kerreem Khan marched towards Perfia, and having a large body of troops devoted to him, he aflumed the reins of government, which he has held ever fince. A Prince coming to a throne by hereditary fucceflion, or by election, may venture to refide in an opent 237 ] city like Ifpahan; but an ufurper muft endeavour to fecure himfelf with fortifications: for this reafon Kerreem fixed upon Shiras, which is furrounded with a wall and a ditch, fufficiently ftrong to refift the attacks of the Perfians; and in order to render himfelf ftill more fecure, he has obliged all his principal officers to bring their women into the city, from which none of them can ever go out again without his permiffion. Could any other advantages compenfate for the want of liberty, the Perfians would have no reafon to complain of the rigour of this order; for at Shiras they certainly en joy every pleafure that can be derived from a fine climate, and a fertile foil: they have fruits and ve getables of all kinds in abundance; and of the grapes they make a wine, the qualities of which have been celebrated by their well known Poet Hafiz, who has alfo fpoke of the ladies with fuch enthufiafm, as to fay the-truth, would only be come an oriental writer, but ftill there is no doubt of their being extremely beautiful: nor are the arts entirely unknown there, for at Shiras, they manu- fudure the fineft fword blades in the world, and adorn the handles of them with an enamel which would be admired even in London or Paris. No- thing in fliort is wanting to make Perfia a terref- trial paradife, excepting a regular government. The Ufur-C 238 ] Ufuiper Kerreem is now dead, and has left a num ber of different competitors for the throne, but whatever fuccelibr he may have will find, he has much to do to unite a kingdom which for fo many years has be^n in a ilate of anarchy and confulion. T he great Kouli Khan ruined Perfia: the force he colledted for the invafion of Hindoftan excited in the nation in general a fpirit of enterprize a., 1 adventure ;and the influx of wealth from the plun der of that country, entirely deftroyed the Spirit of in- duftry. In conlequence of which, the cultivation of the lands has been negledled, trade abandoned, and thofe troops which were levied for. conqueft, having diffipated what they acquired by plunder • have ever lince been ravaging their own native country. The fate of Perfia may ferve as a leffon to all other nations, to prefer the more flow but falutary profits of trade. Superfluous wealth occa- fions a kind of frenzy in a kingdom, during the pa- roxifms of which it leems to have acquired uncom mon ftrength; but being exhaufted by unnatural ex ertions, it at length finks down a miferable vidlim to its diforder* . J anu- • It has been faid. that Lord Clive propofed to pay the nation al debt by an expedition to China : he might in a convivial mo ment[ 239 ] January 7th. The Nakhuda promifed to have the doa ready to fail in twenty-four hours, if the wind permitted. In the evening of this day there was a violent fquall of wind from the S. E. accompanied with thunder, lightning and rain, which was the breaking up of the weather; for in the night the wind came round to the north ward with a moderate breeze. January 8th. The Nakhuda called in the morning to inform us he Ihould fail in the evening about five o'clock, at which time we embarked and failed in company with two trankeys bound to Gombroon, the wind N. N. W, and the weather fair. January 9th. Fair weather with a frefh breeze at N. W. faw the mountain and Cape Burdiftan, and at twelve o'clock bore away N. N. E. towards a fhoal called the Cock, that we palfed at one o'clock in the afternoon, and upon which two Englifh fhips have been loll; one of them in the ment amongft his friend have faid fuch afcheme was pradicable, jand fo it certainly is; but he was too found a politician, to wifli to fee one hundred and iifty millions of fpecie the amount of the national debt in his time, introduced at once into England, knowing as he muft that the fudc en introduftion of one half of that fum, has irrecoverably ruined Perfia one of the mo ft highly , gifted countries in the world# year[ 2 4° ] year 1763. On the mountain of Burdiftan they ufed formerly by fignals of fire in the night and of fmoak in the day to convey intelligence to the mer chants at Shiras, of the appearance of the fhips expected from India; that they might inftantly come to Aboulliaher to purchafe their goods. Lati tude obferved 27. 53. North. January 10th. About two o'clock in the morning it grew calm, and continued fo all day: about fix in the evening a light breeze fprung up from S. S. E. About four miles from the fhore i!aw Cape Naband E. by N. latitude 27. 11. North. January nth. Calm till about feven in the morning, then a light breeze fprung up from the N.

Light airs and variable, palTed the Iflands of Ke£h and Belior, latitude 26. 24, North. January 15th. The wind at N. E. and blew frefh, coming further to the eaftward. In the morning we ran in towards the Ifland of Kifmis, near a place called Daag ul Kumuck, came to an anchor after ten o'clock, calm, latitude obferved 26. 36. North. Two people who came in a fmall boat from the (hore, confirmed to us the report that Mahomed Ralhid Sheick of Julfa, had taken one of the company's veffels, going from Bombay to Baffora, and fold the crew for flaves. v -• ■ i'# 'ig i- * w i** -v4 16 th. At nine in the morning weighed anchor, and went round the Weft end of the Ifland of Kifmis, called by the Perlians Touly, and came to an anchor again off Ras, (cape) Baffido O o which January[ 242. ] wihicli hy an obfervation lays in tlie latitude of 26. 41. North, The people faid that between t wen ty and thirty years ago, there had been a fettlement of Euro peans here j we faw the remains of a church, and the ruins of a large town that had been built with jbricks dried in the fun. At two in the afternoon weighed with a light breeze at S. W. and the tide in our favor, the channel between Kifinis and the main at this place is about four miles wide. At BafiMo we got a frcfli fupply of water, which was taken out of a xxfervcir that had been built by the Europeans, paved all through with a white ftone : at this time there were not ten houfes inhabited in this large ruined town, all which were Perlians. 1 January 17th. Came to an anchor at half pall ten at night, and did not weigh again until fix the next morning. About feven we arrived amongft a parcel of Iflands covered with trees moft of which Hood two feet or more in the water j the Iflands are divided hy very narrow channels, that the trees alm nfr meet and form a kind of arbour. About eleven o'clock it being calm and the tide making againft us we again came to an anchor; the people whilft they were cutting wood law three large wild hogs and fome pigs. At half after eleven in the forenoon it began to rain hard, and to blow freih from the N. W. which continued till two i o'clock j[ H 1 ' o'clock; then cleared up and being - a fettled wind we weighed. Until five in the evening we con tinued failing through a narrow channel, amongfl the Iflands, and then came in fight of a fort and ruined town called Left; it is fituated under a hill on the I (land of Kifmis; the fort bore about S. W. of us at fun fet; near this place we were obliged to wait for our boat that Sheick Aly the Nakhuda had fent on fhore for fome v/ood and fifh for his own private ufe. About four in the afternoon made fail again and paffed by a galivat belonging to Sheick Mahomed Miny of Ormus. No ob- fervation on account of the hazinefs of the weather. January 18th. At night calm, the tide mak ing again ft us, came to an anchor. In the morn ing at day break weighed with a light breeze to the S. W. Gombroon bearing about N. N. E. In the afternoon the wind frefhened and came further to the weftward, blowing very hard from five to feven in the afternoon, and then it began to moderate, no obfervation. Cape Salamet on the Ifland of Mahomed Salamet bore at fun fet, about S. W. January 19th. The wind continued to blow exceedingly hard from the weftward, which made the veilel both roll and pitch very much: at half after eight the fail was broken by the violence of the O o 2 windi[ 244 ] wind; unbent it, and bent a fmaller. The middle of the night being exceedingly cloudy, the Arabs for want of a compafs did not know which way to fleer ;they had been going above two hours due North when we difcovered it, and put them right; they had been deceived by a change of wind and bad fleerage. In the morning came on a frefh breeze to the N. W. which continued till ten in the morning, it then grew calm, and afterwards fprung up from the fame quarter: latitude obferved 26. 29. North, diftant from the fhore about five leagues, high mountain near Cape Mozandan. The town of Lema bore of us at noon S. W. by W. the afternoon little wind and cloudy all round. January 20th. About one o'clock this morn ing came on a frefh breeze at North, which in- creafed with a following fea: about four o'clock in the morning our tiller rope broke, and it was with much difficulty we prevented the veffel from flying to. Three men got overboard to mend the rudder, in the mean time the veffel rolled fo much that there was danger of her filling, or at leaft of her carrying away the mall; in about an hour the rudder being repaired, we got under fail again, the weather being dark andfqually; the Nakhuda or Captain, and the Malleem, or pilot, thought it unfafe to continue any longer at fea, and therefore put in at Khorfa- kan.t 245 ] kan, which is fituated on the coaft of Arabia, in a fmall bay open only to the Eaftward; on the S.E. fide of the bay is a harbour for boats, where we lay in fmooth water, and entirely fheltered from all winds, it rained exceedingly hard the whole day, and confequently wetted our baggage and beds. At feven in the evening the clouds difperfed, and it began to clear up. J anuary 21ft:. About two o'clock this morning came on a very hard fquall of wind and rain, with violent thunder and lightning from the N. W. which continued near an hour j had we been at fea we muft inevitably have founder ed in lefs than five, minutes, for although we lay in a place furrounded with hills, the violence of the wind fliook the veffel as if fhe had been ftruck by abroadfide from a largeihip. The wind being at S. E. we could not move, therefore at day-break we went on fhore to the top of the hills to take a view of the country, and dry our cloaths, 6cc. on a fmall hill to the Weftward of this little harbour, is a ruined caftle, formerly built by Nadir Shah, to cover a magazine for his ftores, when his troops befieged Mulkat. The town which is fituated at the bottom of the Bay was once conliderable, but at prefent con- fills[ ] fifts only of two or three houfes built of Hone, the reft are fi£hermens huts. January 22d. At nine at night the wind being fet in at N. W. and the weather fair; we weighed anchor from Khorfakan. When out at fea we faw fome lightning from the S. E. At eleven at night the wind began to frefhen from the N. W. and at one blew in hard Iqualls; at feven in the morning our tiller rope broke, which had not been mended above a quarter of an hour when a hard fquall came, and the rudder itfelf was broken: as it was impcfiible to mend it without unhanging it, fome of the people went overboard for that purpofe, and in half an hour brought the remainder of the rudder on board j but it was full four hours before it was repaired : in the mean time, as we could not lay the velTei to, we lowered down the fail, and the velfel lay with her broadfide to the wind j we expefted fhe would fill every moment, for the wind blew very hard in fqualls, with a fliort and heavy fea, when the rudder was mended, fix of our people got into the fea to fix it. About twelve o'clock, with much difficulty we got her head round and fcudded before the windj juffc after we had re paired the rudder, we faw Cape Shenes, bearing weft./ ✓ [ 2 47 1 weft, latitude obferved 24. 34. N. We had no observation at Khorfakan, but from its bearing and diftance this day at noon ; I lliould fuppofe it lays in latitude 25. 13. North. January 23d. At ten la ft night, in fliift- ing the fail to haul in for the land, our tiller-rope broke.a^ain, and the veffel flew up in the wind. O ^ We tried when the rope was mended to bring her head round again to our proper courfe, but in vain, and therefore fleered as much as we could to the weft ward. Our people were fo much harraffed by the fatigues of the preceding day and night, that they could not be prevailed upon to exert themfelves ; but on the contrary were fulky and quarrelforae, upbraiding us with being the authors of their diftreffes, in obliging them to leave Khorfakan before the weather was fettled. Our veffel being very lively (hipped no fea, although the wind and fea encreafed confi- derably. At day-break in the morning, paffed between the illands of bawady, and the town of Sohar on the Main : the wind being much more moderate, at live in the morning we came to an anchor at Mufcat. The entrance of the outer port where we anchored is defended by feveral batteries even with the water's edgej but the Arabs[ =45 ] Arabs with fome reafon depend moft upon two forts, eroded upon hills, commanding the mouth of the inner harbour, which are called Marany and Jillaly; not being acquainted with the rules of this place, we narrowly efcaped getting into a fcrape; for as no boats are allowed to go on ihore after fun-fetfrom the outer port, the guards Rationed in the two above-mentioned forts fired at us; but fortunately they were bad markfmen, only one of their (hot ftruck the boat. The Succefs, Grab, from Bombay, which was bound to Baffora with difpatches, was lying in the in ner harbour }we went to the houfe of Narrain- dofs, the English broker, which although not a very elegant habitation appeared to us, who had been expofed to violent wind and inceffant rain for eight and forty hours, a perfed: palace. January 24th. In the morning Captain Twyfs came and told us he fhould fail for Baffora the next day. He had fix Englifh gentlemen paflengers with him that were going over the defert, and alfo Monfieur Borel de Bourg, the French officer, who had been plundered and wounded by the Arabs on the defert. Monfieur Borel wiftiing to hear the lateft news from Eu rope, and perhaps alfo being defirous of con-[ 2 49 ] verfing with a perfon who had lately travelled the fame route as himfelf, came and fpent the evening with me at the broker's houfe. I told him that I was no ftranger to what had be fallen him on the defert, and eafily prevailed on him to give me an account of his adventures. T he particulars of the bufinefs upon which he was fent, he of courfe concealed, but in ge neral terms he informed me that foon after the engagement between the two fleets near Breft, in July 1778; Monfieur de Sartine, his friend and patron ordered him to carry difpatches over land to India. I think he faid he left Marfeilles on the third of Auguftj but that owing to the ftupidity of the Captain of his veffel, and to contrary winds, he did not arrive at Latichea be fore the end of the month ; from thence he im mediately proceeded to Aleppo. The French Conful could not colled: more than twenty-liva guards to attend him acrofs the defert; with which, on the fourteenth of September, he be gan his journey. He met with no ferious mo- leftation, until he was within fifteen days of Baflbra, when early one morning he perceived himfelf followed by a party of about thirty Arabs mounted on camels, who foon overtook him. P p As[ 25° ] y r *\ .3 \ As they approached, he by his interpreter de^ fired they would pleafe to advance, or halt, or move to the right or left of him, for he chofe to travel by himfelf; they anfwered that they ihould not interfere with him, and went forwards at a brilk rate. Mr. Borel's people then fuf- pedted them of fome hoftile defign, and told him to be upon his guard. In the evening, between four and five o'clockj he obferved them halted and drawi^ up as if to oppofe him j and in a few minutes three other parties, confifting alfo of about thirty each appeared in fight, in oppofite diredions, feemingly inclined to fur- round him: from thefe appearances very natu rally concluding their intentions to be hoftile, and confequently his fituation defperate, like a gallant man he thought only of felling his life as dearly as poflible j he was armed with a double barrelled fuzee, a pair of piftols, and a fabre. As he kept marching on, he firft fell in with the party in front, who fired at him, which he returned as foon as he came within mulket ihot of them, and killed the Sheick j when he had difcharged his fire arms, before he could load theni again, feveral of the Arabs broke in from different fides, and cut him down. Stunned with the violence of' the blow, he knew nothing thai[ 251 ] tliat paffed afterwards, until about an hour be-r fore day-break the next morning, when he found himfelf entirely naked on the ground, a quantity of blood near him, and part of the flefh of the fide of his head hanging upon his cheek. ' In a few minutes he recolledted what had pafled, but as he could feel no fradure or contufion in the flcull, he began to think his wounds were not mortal; this however was only a tranlient gleam of hope, for it immediately occurred to him, that without clothds or even food, he was likely to fuifera much more painful death. The firft objedls that ftruck him when he began to look about him were thofe who had been killed on both fides in the adion j but at the diftance of g few hundred yards, he foon afterwards per ceived a great number of Arabs leated round a large fire: thefe he naturally fuppofed were his enemies; neverthelefs he determined to go to them, in hopes, either to prevail on them to fave his life, or elfe to provoke them to put an immediate end to his miferies. Whilft he was thinking in what manner without the affiftance of language he fliould be able to excite their compaffion, and to fbften their refsntnientagainft hitti for the death of their companions, which thefe people he had heard feldom forgive: it oc- p p 2 curredt 2 5 2 J curred to him, that they paid great refpedl to 3ge ;and alfo that they feldom deftroy thole who fupplicate mercy; from whence he concluded, that if he could throw himfelf under the pro- tedlion of the oldeft perfon amongft them, he might probably be faved. In order to approach them unperceived, he crept towards them upon his hands and knees j and when arrived within, a few paces of their circle, having fmgled out one who had the moft venerable appearance, he rufhed forwards and fpringing over the head of one of the circle, he threw himfelf into the arms of him, whom l^e had feleded for a protedlor. The whole party were at firfl; extremely afto- nifhed, not having the leaft notion of his being alive j but when their furprize fubfided, a de bate arofe whether or not they fliould allow him to live. One of them who had probably loft a friend or relation, drew his fword in a great rage, and was going to put him to death, but his protedor interpofed, flood up with great zeal in his defence, and would not fuffer him to be injured; in Confequence of which, his adver- fary immediately mounted his camel, and with a few followers went away. When this conteft was over the Sheick, for fo he happened to be, perceiving Monfieur Borel entirely without clothes.t 253 ] clothes, prefented him with his abba or outer cloak, invited him to approach the fire, and gave him coftee and a pipe, which an Arab when he is not on the march, has always pre pared. The people finding Monlieur Borel did not underftand Arabic enquired for his interpre ter, who was found alleep and flightly wounded'. - • - ' • T he firft demand the Arabs made was for his money and jewels, which they obferved Europeans always have in great abundance, but which are concealed in private drawers, that none excepting themfelves can difcover. He aflured them thefe ©pinions were erroneous with refped; to him, for that he was not a rich merchant, but only a young foldier of fortune, employed to carry orders from his government in Europe to their fettlements in India: but that if they would convey him to Graine, a place near Baffora on the fea coaft; on their ar rival there, and on the receipt of his papers, he would engage to pay them two hundred chequins, about one hundred pounds fterling. After a few mi nutes confultation with each other they acceded to his propofals, returned him his oldeft Arabian drefs, and during the reft of his journey treated him with tolerable kindnefs and attention. Afterf ^4 J A fter Mr. Borel's arrival at Graine, he eafily prevailed on an Armenian to advance him the mo ney to fulfil his engagements with the Arabs ; and alfo to fend the French refident at Baflbra an account of what had befallen him on the defert, defiring to be fupplied with money and other necelTaries to enable him to proceed to Pondicherry. His letter very fortunately for us fell into the hands of the Englifh refident at Baffora, who having heard of our rupture with France, was convinced he muft be charged with public difpatches of confequence, and therefore determined to arreft him. Every ge nerous mind will lament the neceffity there was of adding to the diftreffes of this fpirited and unfor tunate youth; but the lives of thoufands, and per haps the fafety of our fettlements in India, depend ed upon his being intercepted; but to prevent his being treated with any rigour, or fuffering any in dignity, Mr. Abraham the fecond in council of the fadory, was employed to feize him. The town of Graine which is fituated about miles S. E. of Baffora, is governed by an Arab Sheick who is very much attached to us; but Mr. Abranam knew it Would be very difficult to pre vail on him to violate the rights of hofpitality to a ftranger, and without the Sheick's connivance, the execution of the project would have been ab- folutelyt 2 5s 1 folutely impracticable : the better to conceal his defign, Mr. Abraham went down to Graine at night in a country boat, accompanied by the Cap tain of one of our fhips then lying at BafTora, and immeditately proceeded to the Sheick's houfe, to whom he communicated his bufinefs. The Arab at firft violently oppofed the meafure; but being mollified by prefents, and alfo affured that Mr. Borel fliould not receive any perfonal injury, he at laft acquiefced. When Mr. Abraham knocked at x the door, Mr, Borel was retired to reft, but he in- ftantly got up to admit him, thinking he was a peribn lent from the French refident with an an- fwer to his letter. As foon as he difcovered his miftake he attempted to defend himfelf, but he Was inftantly overpowered and conveyed to the fea fide, where he was put on board the Ihip that had been lent from Ballbra, and was juft then come to an anchor off the place. He had two pacquets, one for Pondicherry, and another for Mauritius, which were found; but Monfieur Borel obferved tq me, that they miffed the key of the cypher in which the difpatches were written, by negleaing to fcarch the lining of his cloaths. It was perhaps a fortunate circumftance for Monfieur Borel that he was taken prifoner by us, for his wound through wniluilul management, and the want of proper re medies '^'ds :13^d DlliQW 7.'. nJ \ .t 2 5« ] . medles was grown extremely bad; nor is it im probable that if he had attempted to proceed in a country boat, the only conveyance that he could have got at Graine; his wound would have occa- fioned his death long before the boat could have arrived at any French fettlements in India. I made ufe of thefe arguments to confole him for his mis fortunes, but zeal for his country, the natural enthufiafm of his dilpolition, and the hopes which had been given him of promotion, had he executed his commiffion, made him deaf to every thing I could lay to conlble him. Dilappointed but not difcouraged by his former fufferings, he was then on his way to Ballora to proceed over the great de- fert a lecond time ■, which I was afterwards in formed, he palled with every affiftance he could receive from the gentlemen of our fadtory.

Vandeputj the Royal Admiral and Morfe Indiamen, and feveral other country fhips. The Afia and the two Indiamen arrived from England the day before us. At fix in the evening went on fhore to the governor's houfe and delivered him the pacquets. Mr. Hornby the governor of Bombay, during our flay on that Ifland, entertained us very politely at his houfe, and ordered a veflel to be got ready to convey us to Anjengo. On the 14th of Fe bruary we embarked on board the Terrible bomb- ketch, Capt. Baine, and arrived at Anjengo in nine days; a voyage at this feafon of the year on the-[ 26l ] ialabar coaft is always agreeable, but was rendered particularly fo to us, from the good hu- mour, and good fenfe of our captain. Having hired a palanquin and proper people to carry it, on the 24th in the evening I fet out from Anjengo for Pallomcotta, and arrived there in three days, the diftance is ninety one Englifli miles.

After leaving Palamcotta, the firfl: day I reached Madura, diftant about ninety-fix miles. The fecond day arrived at Tritchonoply ninety two miles;[ 262 ] miles: here I halted half a day having reaibn to believe the palanquin bearers were not ftationed. The third day in the afternoon left Tritchonoply and arrived at Cuddalore in the evening of the fourth, one hundred and eight miles: remained here a few hours, and then proceeded through Pondicherry to Madras, one hundred and fourteen miles, where I arrived in the afternoon of the fixtli day. The whole diftance is eftimated at four hun dred and fourteen miles, which was performed in five days and a quarter, exclulive of Hopping and a few unavoidable delays on the road. The tra velling pace in a palanquin is on an average about four miles an hour. It has been invariably my rule throughout this: journal to acknowledge the attention 1 met with on the way; but without proceeding in the fame man ner after my arrival at Pallamcotta, and from thence to Madras ; I lliall only in general obferve that travellers in India are always received with a libe ral hofpitality unknown in any other country. Not that I affect to fay there is more urbanity in India, than in Europe; but as moft of the Europeans in that country are known to each other; and there are no, houfes of pu.blic entertainment excepting at the pre'fidencies; it of courfe becomes a matter of re ciprocal convenience, that the chiefs at the differ ent31 I : ) \ / / i E ^3 J cnt out fettlements, and the commandants of the fortified towns fliould keep a kind of open houfe, for all perfons who are generally known, or pro perly introduced to them. How kindly and hand- fomely ftrangers are received on their fir ft arrival in India is a fa£t of public notoriety, and general admiration. The letters of introdudion which perfons carry out, from England, not only pro cure them temporary civilities, but alfo obtain for the ladies in particular fuch a reception as almoft furpalfes belief. From the inftant of their arrival, they are conlidered as belonging to the family to which they have been introduced, and from which they are never again feparated, but by death or marriage. I t is hardly neceffary to obferve, that more at tention has been paid to the matter, than to the ftile of this journal, particularly in that part of it which relates to the defert. But the obfervations were put down on the evening of the day on which they were made, and with no other view than to ferve as memoranda; in which form perhaps they may be moft acceptable to the generality of readers, as being the ideas of the country, as they occurred on the fpot. It may be thought that too much has been faid of wind and weather, which are fel- dom much noticed in books of travels by land. When Hft* 3 * /[ 26 4 ] When travelling in a clofe carriage, it certainly does not fignify what quarter the wind comes from, or whether it blows hot or cold: but this is not the cafe with a traveller expofed to the open air, with no other covering than the cloaths he wears. A perfon going acrofs the defert will probably be glad to know what weather he is likely to meet with cn his journey, that he may equip himfelf proper ly ; and neither be encumbered with any thing fuperfluous, nor negledt taking any thing really necefTary. A particular conlideration of the charadler of the Arabs and a more minute defcription of the defert than is contained in this journal are kept as materials for a larger work. Neverthelefs for the convenience of travellers who in the mean time may pafs that way, and for whofe ufe this journal was originally publifhed; it may be proper to give a general idea of the defert and its inhabitants, by means of which the traveller will readily become acquainted with the principal difficulties he has to encounter j and alfo with the difpofitions of the ' perfons with whom he is about to affociate. T he great Defert of Arabia has often been re- prefented as an immenfe fpace of barren fand, which never has nor ever can be made to produce any herb[ *65 ] herb or vegetable whatever; where confequently not only men could never refide, but where no animal of any kind could poffibly exifc. The journal itfelf confutes that opinion j in which the attentive reader will perceive that frequent mention is made of the ruins of buildings, which in all pro bability are only fmall remains of what once exiiled on thofe fp'ots. Before the difcovery of the paflage round the Cape of Good Hope, when the produc tions of the Eaft were necelTarily brought part of the way to Europe by land, particularly in the re mote ages of antiquity; the great defert was doubt- lefs one of the principal channels of eaftern com merce. At that time I fuppofe thofe buildings to have been eredled, nor can I attribute the exiftcncc of Palmyra itfelf, which is fituated in a moft bar ren part of the defert, to any other caufe. Water the great principal of both animal and vegetable life is not wanting. By means of thofe ravines or water courfes which communicate with the Eu phrates, and alfo from the wells which are inter- fperfed throughout the defert; water enough might be obtained, not only for domeftic ufes, but alfo to anfwer the purpofes of hufbandry. The foil in general is by no means fo barren as not to be capa ble of cultivation; there are but few fpots that would not yield to the perfevering hand of induftry. R r Should[ 265 ] Should the Chrlman powers hereafter drive the tkf Turks out of Europe, and compel them to retreat outlii beyond the bounds of Alia Minor; it is by no means tk i' improbable that towns and villages would then rife Bedo up on what is now called the defert; and the re- ainl mains of thofe barren Ipots again become, what I ^ believe them to have formerly been, only inter- mediate commons j like Salifbury plain, or Bagfhot ^ heath, ■ In defcribing the Arabs, a perfon ought to en ter into very nice difcriminations, for every tribe has its peculiar character ;but as it is intended on this occafion to vindicate them only from the com- to mon imputation of being faithlefs favages; I fhall content myfelf for the prefent with giving a flight re ^ iketch of the moft ftriking features of a defert A- rab's mind. He like the reft of his fellow crea- ^eii tures is much governed by felf-love j but this paf- lion is fo tempered and qualified in him, by the liberal didtatejS of honour and hofpitality j and the tnu mild and benevolent influence of pity, and com- to paflion j as to preferve his uncultivated mind from linking into abfolute felfilhnefs: thefe lentiments and pafiions correal even the violence of his reli gion's prejudices, and render him equally humane to a conquered enemy, whether a Chriftian, or a Mahomedan, Many circumftances mentioned in W the ■&gt; ~ * *t 26 7 3 I the preceding journal prove that this is a faithful outline of their charadter, and very different from the idea generally entertained of thefe people. The Bedouins who attacked us near Tiaba could cer tainly have cut us to pieces and made themfelves maflers of the whole of our property, but they preferred obtaining from us a moderate tribute for the merchandize belonging to Khwaja Rubens, and the Bagdad caravan. Their right to exadt a tribute from pafTengers may perhaps be difputed; but it mufl be remembered that they are lords of the de- fert, and will be paid a duty for all merchandize that pafles through their territories. Some cara vans it is true are powerful enough to refifl, and refufe to comply with their demands j and fo do the armies of Pruffia, Auflria, and France force their way through the dominions of the fmaller ftates of Germany: but a Frenchman mufl: pay cufkom-houfe duties for his goods in Germany as muft a German fatisfy the demands of government in France. Our caravan was attacked a fecond time, but we were too powerful for our adverfaries, in cbnfe- quence of which a treaty took place, and fourteen of their people joined our party nor during the remainder of our journey did the leaft mark of ill- R r 2 humour[ 268 ] humour or refentment break out between our peo ple and their new affbciates. It is true, that the Arabs who plundered Mr. Borel atfted apparently in the firft in fiance towards him with unwarrant able violence ;but I am convinced they would not have gone fuch lengths had they found him difpo- fed to treat and to pay them, as we did, a moderate tribute. In the engagement Mr. Borel killed fe- vera! of their comrades ;neverthelefs when he re covered and implored their mercy, no man could have lliewn more honour or fpirit than the old Sheick did in his defence, which could only have proceeded from the moft laudable and difinterefted motives ;for it is evident from their fituation, that Mr. Borel had no opportunity of promifing him * any reward for his protection. To thefe might be added many other inftances of equal honour and humanity fhewn by the Arabs to Europeans, col lected even from the accounts of thofe who com plain moll of ill treatment from them but I flatter myfelf that thofe I have already mentioned, toge ther with the remarkable inftances of liberality in the old Sheick when I fettled accounts with him: ■ * are fufiicient teftimonies of their poffeffing fenti- ments and paffions that place them much above the rank of unfeeling barbarians. r, ^ r v ■ K - - • ■ 4 • i i -v.v.; ..'■■■ v- .1 ' V- J + * •• r Thati 26 9 ] T hat fome unfortunate travellers may have fuffered from their violence and rapacity, I do not difpute; there are thieves and affaflins in all parts of the inhabited globe j and into whofe hands Gran gers, not properly introduced, are moft likely to fall: but in moft of the accounts I have read com- r plaining of the Arabs, I have found great reafon to believe that the fufferings of the Europeans origi- ginated in their own imprudence, or elfe in the treachery of their Interpreters. The books of tra vels in Europe are filled with melancholy ftories of hair-breadth efcapes from robbery and murder, and conftant lamentations of infults and impofi- tions. Why then are we to villify the charaders of all the Arabs, and reprefent them as deftitute of principle, becaufe a perfon unacquainted with their language, or their manners and cuftoms, has ex perienced the fame ill treatment from the worft of their countrymen, as he would have been liable to meet with in any country in Europe ? With equal propriety might a foreigner accufe all Englifh men of being cheats, and highwaymen; becaufe one of his countrymen has been impofed on at an inn j or robbed on the road between Dover and Lon don. To fum up all that need be faid on this fub- jedlfor the prefent in a few words. An European who wi£hes to pafs the delert with eafe and lafety, muft[ 270 ] mufl: lay afide all his own prejudices, and not ridi cule thofe of the Arabs. Before he fets out he fliould have all their claims clearly afcertained behave to them on the way with kindnefs without familiarity—and in fettling accounts at the end of the journey, be liberally juft to them, without profulion. 1 / . * t THE END. fSUPPLEMENT CONTAINING LISTS of the STAGES IN THE DIFFERENT ROUTS ■• i' FROM ENGLAND TO BASS OR A, TAKEN ' Either from the J ournals and O bservations Of the AUTHOR, o r Collefted by him from the best A uthorities.

Bagdad y0U ma ^ ^ et t0 Tbotdrkat or Karhut 'xn eight days, and from thence ta Mojul in four. If your ftomach is a little nice, you had beft provide yourfelf with eatables at Bagdad, for the bread and rice that you may meet with on the road may not poffibly be white. However, the beft bread is to be had at BaJJora -, and as for butter, you will meet with none after you leave that place till you come to Aieppf. As for our parts, we found the bread upon the road pretty good. As you travel along you will meet with villages on the road to lodge in from ftage to itage. But for the apartments thejjr will be of little ufe^ except to defend you from the weather j for there is no furniture, and it will be a rarity to find fo much as a little (tool. As for other conveniences, you are not to expeft them. However, you may probably tra vel all along this road, as we did, by ourfelves^ without the leaft interruption or in civility. AiKarkut, which is a ftrong city, it is ufual to reft a day or two and replenifli your panniers ; that is you mull lay in prcvifions for four days at lealt, which is th© time you will fpend in going to Mouful, as mentioned above. As for wine, you mult take care to fupply yourfelf nBaJfora, and that for a month or more. At Bagdad you may probably replenifli your itore as well as at Karkut ; and ziMoufulyou muft purchafe provifions of all kinds for fix days 5 as alfo at Cajenifar or Mardin for Orfar, that is for fix or eight days j and afterwards at that place for Aleppo, which is five days more; and among the Chriftians you will always meet with wine or brandy. The place where you are moft likely to be detained is Mouful, becaufe you mult either wait for a caravan, or hire a convoy 5 which laft you may do at four rupees a man. If you will liften to them they will tell you, that it will be unfafe to travel without twenty or thirty of thefe people for a guard 5 but I am perfuaded there is no fuch danger of robbers as they pretend. However there are caravans which fet out from this place once in every ten or fourteen days, unlefs in the depth of winter, and they take a convoy, the money to pay which is levied by the Caravan Baihi, up on all the people of the caravan, generally in proportion to the goods which eacft perfon carries with him, but fometimes according to the number of beaits, and yout ihare will confequently be but a trifle. The ufual time of travelling from Mouful to Madan or Mardin is eight days, and from Mardin to Orfa feven days. The firft fix days of the journey is over a deferC almoit without inhabitants, and therefore your fare will be good or bad according to the quality of the provifions you brought with you. Three days after you leave the Tigris the water begins to be brackifli, and therefore it behoves you to take care to fu^&gt;piy yourfelf with that which is good in time. 1 he caravan makes a halt at Nifihln, the next town to Moufut, where it is vilited hy the cuilon&gt;hcmfe olficers. But a geuUemaa that travels only with his baggage is underSUPPLEMENT.
