[Copy sent to Middle East Secretariat] — — mI CONFIDENTIAL. j W tVH } 2 6 JUL 19^5 BRITISH tq 20th July, Dear Secretariat, We enclose a copy of a Note Verbale from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, invoking out help in finding them somebody who could teadh the Iraqi police how to use tear -gas. You will notice that no terms of service ate mentioned, but we have discussed the proposal'with the Director-General of Police who says that he has in mind not a normal contract but a-visit long enough only to train a cadre of Iraqi officers Who would then be able to instruct others* The Director-General is anxious to know as soon as possible about how much the expert*s services would cost, and laid particular stress on the necessity for his bringing all the stores and equipment with him; there are none here. 2* The ideal man for the job would be an Englishman who had seen service in India or some other country in which tear gas is used in climatic conditions similar to those prevailing here. If such a man cannot be found, the next choice would be an Englishman who knew about tear gas in general; and failing that, the Iraqis would accept a Pakistani Moslem police officer with the necessary specialist knowledge. 3. The Iraqis request is probably the response to advice on the usefulness of tear gas which we gave them after the disturbances here last January. We should be grateful, therefore, if you would treat the matter as urgent. We are sending copies of this letter to the United Kingdom High Commissioners at Karachi and New Delhi, who will no doubt inform you if they know of any possible candidates for the job.
