It features correspondents from the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, the India Office, and the Government of India's Foreign and Political Department.According to the file, copies of the reports were sent directly to Bushire, Muscat, Singapore, Koweit [Kuwait], and Bahrein [Bahrain] until April 1926, when it was arranged that five copies of each report would be sent to the Government of India via the India Office, before being distributed to the Government of India's Foreign and Political Department and to Bushire, Bahrain, Kuwait and Muscat respectively. Subsequent correspondence in the file discusses the following: requests from the Government of India for additional copies of the report, the Legation's and Foreign Office's reluctance to comply with these requests on the grounds of practicality and discretion, and a proposal made by His Majesty's Minister at Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan) in 1932 to change the format of the report to that of a newsletter and to reduce its length by a third.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence (folio 1).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000282#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
