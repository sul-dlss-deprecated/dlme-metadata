The volume describes Bax's voyage from England to Bombay in 1812; travels in India in 1815-17; voyage and journey to Rusool Khyma [Ra's al-Khaymah] in Arabia, to Bushire in Persia, and through Shiraz, Isfahan, Kermansha [Kermanshah], and Bagdad [Baghdad] to Bussorah [Basra] in 1819-20; further voyage and journey to parts of India in 1821-22; voyage and journey from India to England via Egypt and several European countries in 1822-23; tours in England, Scotland and Wales, 1823-24; and journey from England to India via France, Germany, Hungary, Constantinople, Baghdad, Bussora [Basra], Bushire and the Persian Gulf in 1824-25.The volume includes regular entries recording positions of longitude and latitude; thermometer readings and climatic information; and tables of distances.The journal records Bax's involvement as an observer in the expedition under the command of Major-General Sir William Grant Kerr 'to suppress the Joasmee [Āl Qawāsim] Pirates' at Ra's al-Khaymah in 1819. Bax briefly describes the landing of Kerr's force, preliminary exchanges, the numbers of casualties on both sides, and the entry of Kerr's troops into the fort and town, which they found deserted (folios 18-19).From Ra's al-Khaymah Bax sailed to Bushire, and from there travelled into the interior of Persia, passing through Shiraz (where he discussed the action at Ra's al-Khaymah, the accounts of which were 'highly exaggerated', folio 23v), Isfahan, and Kermanshah. The journey included a visit to the ruins of Persepolis (folios 27-28). Bax then travelled to Baghdad and Basra, visited the ruins of Ctesiphon (folio 58), and returned by sea to Bombay via Bushire and Muscat (folios 64-65).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Rusool Khyma</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Shiraz</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100044534949.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
