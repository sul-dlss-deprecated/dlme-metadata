Moreover, Mr. Wratislaw, whom I have consulted, agrees with me in thinking that such an appointmeDt would be undesirable on account of expense, &amp;c., and not justifiable by reason of work to be done. One object in appointing a deputy commissioner as well as a principal commissioner was that he might deal with such confidential work as cannot be done by a native clerk, who will be attached to the commission and possess a knowledge of Persian.

[38476] Section 1, [Amended Copy. No. 1 Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received August 20.) (No. 720 a.) Constantinople, August 14, 1913. ir ’ WITH reference to my telegram No. 404 of yesterday, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of the draft identic note and annexes on the subject of the Turco-Persian frontier, which the Russian Ambassador and I discussed yesterday with the Grand Vizier and Minister of War. , , , 10J , T i , c - n You will remember that the Turkish reply under date of the 12th July to Sir G. Lowther’s note of the 3rd May was merely a copy of the similar note dated two days earlier to the Russian Embassy here, and that it contained references to various conservations between the Russian Ambassador and the Grand Vizier which were quite out of place in a note addressed to this embassy, and that m particular there were on or two expressions employed in it which were calculated to affect the interests of the Ano-lo Persian Oil Company, and to which, therefore, it was desirable to take exception, tftfr souXg the Sd Vizier I suggested to you that I should endeavour to get the Grand Vizier to modify the note both in form and substance so as to obviate these obiections but on my informing the Russian Ambassador of our proposed course he expressed’ himself as averse from it on the grounds chiefly of loss of time and urged that our material objections could be easily and more effectively enforced in a final identic communication which we should make in reply to the Turkish notes of the 9th and 12th July respectively. M. de Giers a so promised that he would insert ,n the note anything that I requited to safeguard the Anglo-Persian On Company s positiorn ^ of ^ ^ wag natural l y entrusted to M. Minorsky : firstly because he is the only member of the two embassies who possesses a really intimate an accurate knowledge of the whole question ; and secondly, because a large part of t frontier covered m the note interests Russia alone. It was thus inevitable that the draft should be prepared from a Russian standpoint, and that as a whole, when I ha made the alterations and insertions that I considered necessary to protect the Anglo- Persian Oil Company’s interests, it should have assumed a very anomalous shape, and, in“ properly to understand some of the references, it must read as though during the preparatku/of it, the British and Russian Embassies possessed a common chance y and archives As it was, both the Russian Ambassador and I would have gladly put the and arcnives. , interview with the Grand Vizier had already r.' • i “ i ‘ •»«»&lt;» ^I have thought necessary to give this explanation of the anomalous form which our note has assumed I venture to hope, however, that, unusual as its form is the substance will be found satisfactory. The line which it lays down is described as nnrnose in the definite frontier agreement the necessities of the case appear to me to be adequately met iro fhAs the recofnition of their rights in territories explicitly recognised “ ^tA^dS'/^ Kuretu River, reports u^avourabl^to^lm^rurkish conte^tion^that^he frontier asnow agreed on is practically ideiitical with^the present frontier; but south of the Elvend his observations tend W the opposite conclusion except as regards the small tongue o “ J ^ Biz, marked in the reduction of the identic map as Descht^Momyue Nazar « g, and also the oil-well at Naft Meidan, which he considers to be '^Wd^iave been As I had no means of controlling the accuracy of M. Orlo s rep , ^ [1829 u —1] rr— TTITZa Copy to End ‘aglad to omit all mention of both places, and, as you will see, the name of the former district does not appear in the note. As regards Naft Meidan, however, it was impossible to pass over the question in silence, as the place is mentioned in the Turkish note of the 12th July. On the other hand, to have disputed its ownership would have given use to a long discussion with the Turks, who have invariably insisted that it lies within Ottoman territory. I therefore thought it best to accept the rather va»ue wording,^ les pmts de naphte connus sous le nom de Naft Meidan seront laissbs du cki ottoman, which may possibly leave a loophole for submitting the question to future arbitration Except for this point, I think that the wording of the note sufficiently establishes that in our view cessions of territory are being made under the frontier treaty to the west of the new line south of the Kuretu and El vend Rivers in discussing the frontier as far as Mendeli the Grand Vizier and Minister of War showed a most conciliatory disposition, and the only point on which any serious t! ltd ^'° °P ln fW arose was the identity of the Neft Sou (or Ab-i-Neft), which the fW k r h nT ar P r ® tei jded is the stream marked in the War Office map of October 1906 (sheet 9) as the Zelezerd River, instead of the more westernly stream flowing into the Zelezerd from the north. It was agreed that M. Minorsky should if necessary, discuss the question with the Minister of War. The provisions made for the demarcation of the frontier from Mandeli to Shuaib wil, I trust, be considered satisfactory. They are necessarily vague, as we have very Turkish 10 ™/ 51 * 1011 aS ! t0 th r 2U ° m 1849 or t0 ' da y- Th® mention of it in the Tuikish note is merely confusing, as the names of the mountain ranges are inaccurately given This was pointed out by us to the Grand Vizier and Minister for War and after that°tl 1 dlSC T 1 i n / WaS a ? reed t0 f 006 ? 4 the note on the understanding that the actual demarcation would be liable to such modifications as tribal and toThtV COndlt ; OI ?

We presume it will be necessary to place on record agreement arrived at between Turkey and Persia for demarcation of frontier, with assistance of mediating Powers. This might be done by final protocol of Turco-Persian Commission, which has not yet been formally dissolved. Necessary instructions would have to be sent to Persian Ambassador here. Instructions will then have to be prepared for Demarcation Commission, as well as [? “ reglement ”] to govern its procedure.

Foreign Office, August 15, 1913, 6'45 p.m. I HAVE some difficulty in making definite plans for Mr. Wratislaw and Captain Wilson, partly because I am uncertain of the Russian plans. I assume that the date of meeting for the several missions, or at any rate the British and Russian ones, should be fixed as 18th (31st) October at Mohammerah. Mr. Wratislaw has to return to Crete to conclude private arrangements, and proposes to proceed direct from there to Mohammerah by sea, as it would be inconvenient for him to go to Constantinople. Captain Wilson wishes to spend ten days in Tehran, for business connected with the Mohammerah-Khorremmabad Railway, some time in latter half of September. He would propose to go there via Constantinople, which he would have to leave not later than 5th September (n.s.). You could therefore see him, as you desire, at any time between now and 5th September most convenient to you, and date of his departure from London depends on your reply. He cannot return from Tehran to see Russian Mission, and must proceed direct from Tehran to Mohammerah. If, therefore, M. Minorsky wishes to see Captain Wilson in Constantinople, the only convenient time will be between now and 5th September. Please discuss whole matter with Russian Ambassador and telegraph result. You should warn his Excellency of difficulty of securing steamer accommodation for mission in the autumn. I suggest date of meeting to be 31st October instead of 1st December, as first suggested, because I understand the Russian Mission will be at Constantinople by second week in September, and that therefore they will be able to reach Mohammerah by 31st October.

We showed them the line of the frontier in the Zohab district on the map, and arrived at virtual agreement as to its accuracy except at one point, which is to be discussed again. The Grand Vizier promised to inform us by the 16th August whether he could accept the note as final settlement on which the commission could work, and we have good reason to believe that his reply will be satisfactory. The frontier line is described in the draft note with considerable detail from Ararat to Mendeli, and sketch map illustrating it is to be attached to the note. Neither we nor the Turks have sufficient information respecting the status quo frontier between Mendeli and Hawizeh to enable us to lay it down on the map, as recommended in your telegram No. 392 of 9th August, and it was agreed that demarcation shall be left to the commissioners on the basis of the status quo, subject to such modifications as are required by geographical and tribal considerations. I think that the passages intended to preserve the oil company’s rights, &amp;c., will prove adequate. They contest the Turkish assertion that the proposed line south of the Kuretu and Elvend Rivers is the status quo frontier, and speak [?] of cession of territory in the latter district. The acceptation by the Grand Vizier of the draft article maintaining and explaining the company’s rights is also placed on record (see my telegram No. 389 of 5th August). _ _ ^ I should be Mad to receive authority to send the note m when the Russian Ambassador does so, provided, of course, that the Grand Vizier requires no essential modification. u + r There is no time to prepare copies before the messenger leaves to-morrow, but 1 shall forward them by post.

It would be well, therefore, to allow for this by indicating that the line on the map as regards that part is only to be taken as the basis of the final demarcation, unless you see objection. As regards frontier generally, its seems advisable to get the lurks and Persians to accept the line on the map before the work on the frontier begins, and to sign the maps That line will then be decisive subject only to such slight modifications as are shown to be expedient in the course of the demarcation, and much subsequent delay Wl11 k^wy desirable to secure to Russian and British commissioners right of arbitration as distinct from mediation, in regard to any difficulties which may arise b Inform Russian Embassy that Captain Wilson will arrive at OonstanUnople on IQth Au mist to confer with M.

Grey attaches great importance to the presence of Captain Wilson during the whole operations of the frontier commission,- an opinion in which Mr. Consul General Wratislaw, the principal British commissioner, concurs. He further considers that it is essential to the proper discharge of his duties on the commission that Captain Wilson should have some time to study the voluminous corres pondence, with which, in all details, he is not yet familiar; and it is also of great importance that Captain Wilson should make all preliminary arrangements for the transport of the British Commission’s(37500/13) In tliese circumstances Sir E. Grey has learnt with some surprise that Captain Wilson has been selected, or that it is proposed that he should he selected, to serve as political officer to a mission which, he is privately informed, it is proposed should he sent hy the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to investigate certain questions connected with the Arahistan oil fields. Sir E. Grey will doubtless he consulted hy the Lords Commissioners with reference to the despatch of this mission to a foreign country; hut he desires me to intimate forthwith that he is strongly opposed, to the appointment of Captain Wilson to serve on the mission if it should he sent, and he considers that other officers could fulfil the duty in question if necessary. Sir E. Grey is very doubtful v\foether Captain Wilson can perform the work which it ms proposed he should undertake in connexion with the Mohanmerah- Khorremmabad railway survey; hut he is not disposed to object to this if Captain Wilson can definitely arrange (a point as to which that officer is himself now doubt ful)■~gg (37500/13) doubtful) to 5e at Mohammeraii by the 31st. October at the latest, for service with the frontier commission, and if hy that date all preliminary arrangements for transport can he made hy him. I an to express the hope that the Secretary of State for India will concur in this letter, and that an early reply may, if possible, he furnished. In the circumstances which have arisen Sir E. Grey considers that, unless the Russian Government think otherwise, no useful purpose would he served hy either Mir. Wiratislaw or Captain Wilson meeting the Russian Commission in Constantinople, and he is disposed to suggest that the several missions should meet at Mohamnerah on October 31st. If, however, any officer has to go to Constantinople Sir E. Grey would recommend that Captain Wilson should go there. I am. Sir Your most obedient2 CONFIDENTIAL. n , zz) i O Sir G.

I pointed out this to Russian Ambassador [two groups undecypherable]. I proposed to urge Grand Vizier to draft fresh reply omitting such references and also objectionable description of frontier south of Kuretu River as status quo frontier. His Excellency thought it preferable to formulate our objections to that description in identic notes taking act of Turkish proposal. I agreed to this course, and also, as Turkish description of frontier line is exceedingly vague, to ask the Grand Vizier to trace line on map in conjunction with us and leave it to the two embassies to describe in our identic reply.

M. de Giers informs me that, as regards the frontier north of Bane, in which Russia is specially interested, he considers the communication as quite satisfactory. I have not had time before the post leaves to-day to examine or offer comments on the line of frontier as proposed by Turkey throughout the Zohab district, but I notice that the note speaks repeatedly of the part of it south of the Kuretu river as being the status quo frontier. This appears from the I.D.W.O., Map No. 1522, alluded to in your telegram No. 300 of the 5th July, to be a misdescription, and it would, moreover, have the effect if it were accepted, of excluding the Anglo-Persian Oil Company from exercising any rights under the D’Arcy concession in considerable districts which, according to our view, are unquestionably to be ceded by Persia to Turkey. I propose to see the Grand Vizier to-morrow and endeavour to induce him to omit describing the new frontier as the status quo frontier in the corresponding note which he is to address to this embassy.

D’apres le projet de declaration sur cette frontiere, le Gouvernement britannique ‘ s’engage a inviter le Gouvernement persan a accepter le trace susmentionne de cette frontiere comme trace definitif.’ Le Gouvernement Imperial n’est pas sans apprehender que pareille redaction n’occasionne quelque froissement de I’amour-propre du Gouvernement persan.” I have been somewhat surprised by the receipt of this communication, as, in the absence of any criticism by the Russian Government of the document, communicated to them last July, and suggesting a definite line of frontier along the Shatt-el-Arab, I had assumed that Russian Government did not dissent from that line. It is true that the line allots the whole waterway of the Shatt-el-Arab to Turkey, but this was also so allotted by the mediating commissioners’ line of 1851, to which Persia then acceded ; and it would, I consider, be impossible to uphold any Persian claim to the mid-channel boundary having regard to the terms of the Treaty of Erzeroum. But the present declaration in no way invalidates or supersedes the clause of the Treaty of Erzeroum, which secures the right of navigation to the Karun via the Shatt-el-Arab. I have communicated to the Russian Ambassador the draft of our convention with Turkey respecting the Shatt-el-Arab Riverain Commission, and I think the Russian Government will be satisfied that it contains adequate safeguards for international navigation, and that those safeguards are in excess of any which have hitherto existed. As to the declaration referred to in the last paragraph of the Russian communi cation, as the line now provisionally agreed to by Turkey is more favourable to Persia than that awarded by the mediating commissioners, which Persia was ready to accept, I cannot understand how she could possibly object to it. In Mr. O’Beirne’s telegram No. 232 of 30th June I was led to believe that Russia would support His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Mohammerah line, in which they were particularly interested, and I undertook to support Russia in regard to the northern part of frontier.

I realise, however, that our position in regard to such a clause might be dimcult to defend in view of the fact that by proposed treaty the territory in question will be recognised as belonging to Turkey already and will not be made the subject of a transfer by Persia to Turkey, and I am auxious to avoid any provisions respecting oil which might appear to be anything more than a recognition by Turkey of rights which the company had, in fact, acquired from Persia under the concession of 1901. To do more would expose arrangement to the criticism that it was in effect a grant by Turkey of fresh rights in violation of those claimed under alleged Turkish concessions in Mosul and Bagdad. Anglo-Persian Oil Company seem prepared to admit that it would be difficult for them to maintain south of Kuretu River claim to anything west of status quo line, as shown by dotted line on map, and in these circumstances, if you think it advisable, I am prepared to abandon altogether suggested new draft clause. The clause, if inserted, might run as follows:— “For the purposes of the provisions of this article the territories between the Kuretu River on the north and Mendali (or Bedrai if possible) on the south, which he within the so-called ‘ neutral ’ zone as delimited on the Anglo-Russian ‘Identic Map of 1869 and which under article of this convention are now definitely assigned to Turkev 'shall be considered as in the same position as the transferred territories, and the provisions of this article shall apply as fully as if such territories were included among those specifically transferred by Persia to lurkey by article of the piesent convention.” 0 ' ■: / '■ ' ; ■ 11 JUL1913 j_SECi: etA nvs nc 28v ij 1913 j i Sir Edward Grey to Mr. Marling (Constantinople).

Clause “ A ” of draft article is satisfactory in so far as concerns the territory actually to be transferred, but this, I understand from Sir G.

Do you think a clause safeguarding Anglo-Persian Company’s claims within neutral zone of identic map, as regards region between Kuretu and Mendeli, or even Bedrai, would have any chance of being accepted by Turkey ? If you can obtain acceptance do so; if noi, as Persia secures greater part of neutral zone by status quo line, you can waive it. The rest of your draft article is satisfactory. 5b ) Sir G.

I HA VE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatches Nos. 173 and 176 of the 6th and 7th instant respectively relative to the question of the maintenance of the rights of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company under the D’Arcy concession in the territories to be transferred from Persia to Turkey under the frontier arrangements now under negotiation, and I take leave to offer some observations on the draft article by which it is intended to effect this object. The main point is, of course, to obtain the recognition by Turkey of the fact that a concession of territory has taken place, and I understand that it is hoped to achieve this by the use of the expression &lt;c transferred territories.” This means may, perhaps, be adequate in the districts north of the Kuretou River, i.e., those of Chia Sourkh, Shemiran, &amp;c. (supposing that these latter districts are ceded to Turkey), as the Turks have never demurred to the use of the words “ cession ” or “ annexation ” concerning these districts in our note of the 3rd ultimo ; but its efficacy appears to me to be doubtful in the case of the districts lying along the frontier between Kuretou and Mendeli. Both Hakki Pasha in London and the late Grand Vizier here, in conversation with the Russian Ambassador and myself, have, as you are aware, constantly maintained that the line put forward by them for the frontier in these regions represents the existing frontier— that the adoption of it involves no cession of territory to Turkey, but merely the recognition of the status quo. That they should adopt this attitude is rather remarkable, inasmuch as later on, when the time comes to publish the frontier agreement, it will be manifestly to the interest of the Government to be able to represent to the Turkish public and the Chamber that they have succeeded in securing important territorial acquisitions. It may be that they do not wish to see these oil-bearing districts not fall within the area of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession, or, again, that they are now simply making an assertion (which they are aware will not really bear examination and which they could later abandon) in order to get larger concessions farther north in the neighbourhood of Shemiran. But be this as it may, I foresee that a difficulty in this connection may well arise, and I would suggest that to avoid it we should endeavour to obtain the insertion in the definitive agreement of an article enumerating the “rectifications” of frontier, assented to by the two contracting Powers, in the neighbourhood of Zohab. This would serve to indicate that cessions, obviously on the part of Persia, have been made, and it would then remain only to define the area of such transferred territory. The eastern limit of such territory being defined by the treaty itself, it would remain only to fix the western limit, which, of course, resolves itself into the question of determining the frontier as now recognised. To enter into a discussion of this kind at present would entail great delay, and I would suggest that the difficulty might be met by providing that in all disputes arising between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Porte the questions might be decided by arbitration. The arbitration article No. 17 in the D’Arcy concession refers only to disputes arising out of the concession, and would seem scarcely to cover the case in question, and it would therefore be necessary, if my above suggestion is adopted, to add another clause to paragraph (h) of the draft article. I have suggested this line of action to my Russian colleague, and I do not apprehend that he will raise any objection to its adoption. As to the stipulation that the company shall have the right to lay the pipe line through Turkish territory other than the transferred territory, I fear that, although the late Grand Vizier professed his readiness to meet us on this point, it is far from impossible that this desideratum will give rise to difficulties unless the company is [2948 2—1] /; v.

[Turkey] recognizes the concession as continuing in full force and validity within the transferred territories, and recognizes that the monopoly granted by Article 1 of the Concession is absolute and exclusive within the said terri tories, and precludes the grant or extension by [her] within the said territories of any concession in conflict with the rights of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, thereunder, and precludes any interference with or infringement of the said rights by any person or corporation whatsoever. (b.) All the rights, privileges, exemptions andother advantages granted under the Concession by [Persia] and now enjoyed by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, Limited, shall, within the transferred territories, be respected and continued bv Turkey in strict accordance with the terms of the Concession. (c.) Subject to the provisions of clauses (d) and (e) of this Article, all the rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on or reserved by [Persia] in virtue of the Concession shall, within the trans ferred territories, be enjoyed and exercised by [Turkey] in strict accordance with the terms of the Concession. (d.) The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, having paid to [Persia], in accordance with the terms of the first sentence of Article 10 of the Concession, the two sums of 20,0001. in cash and 20,0001. in fully paid up shares mentioned therein, [Turkey] shall make no claim of any kind upon the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, for or in connection with the payment of the two said sums. (e.) [Persia] shall not be entitled to receive any payment, under the second sentence of Article 10 of the Concession, from the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, Limited, in respect of profits derived from its operations in the trans ferred territories. The amount payable under the said sentence of Article 10 of the Concession in respect of such profits shall be payable by the Company to [Turkey], and no claim shall be made upon the Company by [Persia] in respect of any such profits. (/.) In order to carry out effectually the pro visions of Article 2 of the Concession, that Article shall be read as permitting the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, to lay pipe-lines from its workings in the transferred territories to the Persian Gulf through Turkish territory other than the transferred territories, should the Company desire to do so. (r/.) [Turkey] recognizes that the provisions of Article 9 of the Concession permit of the formation of a new Company in accordance with the provisions of that Article to operate the Con cession within the transferred territories, and that in the event of such a Company being formed such Company will thereby succeed in all respects to the position of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company within the transferred territories. (h.) In the event of any question arisingbetween [Turkey] and the AngloPersian Oil Company, Limited, in connection with the opera tion of the Concession within the transferred territories, which (if it had arisen between [Persia] and the Company) should, under the terms of Article 17 of the Concession, have been submitted to arbitration at Tehran, such question shall be submitted to arbitration at Constantinople in accordance with the other provisions of that Article. (i.) [Persia] undertakes to obtain the assent of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, to the provisions of this Article. Such assent shall be signified in such manner as shall mutually be arranged. N.B.—“ Turkey ” and “ Persia ” have been put in square brackets throughout because this is to form one Article of the Treaty, and the Contracting Parties must be described in the same way throughout that instrument. The names in this draft must be altered to correspond with the rest of the Treaty later.CONFIDENTIAL. Sir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received June 8, 3 p.mC Constantinople, June 8, 1913.

I HAVE the honour to inform you that the British agent at Senneh reports regarding the acceptance of Persians as Turkish subjects as follows :— For about fifty years there has been a Turkish consul in Kurdistan, but formerly he was of no importance and had few subjects. Some fifteen years ago the then consul began giving pajDers to Persian subjects. This was reported to the Government, and the then Governor, Ahtisham-es-Sultaneh, took the matter up, and some eight hundred families with Turkish papers were proved to be Persian subjects. 3 he Turks did not act in this way after that till during the last few years, when Persia has been in disorder. The consul then began to support Persian subjects with Turkish papers strongly, and to grant passports to others. Some people obtained these passports to avoid Persian oppression; many others, who are bad characters, in order to escape punishment. The usual plan is to send to Sulamenia, only four stages distant from Senneh, or to some other place in Turkey, and obtain papers, which are accepted by the consul on payment of a fee of £T.20. Now there are about two thousand families in Senneh and the neighbourhood who have Turkish papers, and many of them are bad characters. I have, &amp;c. w. McDouall.

I am, Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant, The Under Secretary of State, India Office.CONFIDENTIAL. (V V T)i aft Memorandum for HaJthi Pasha. iliS Majesty’s Government have had under careful consideration the various draft conventions and declarations which have been drawn up, and initialled ad referendum, in the course of the it cent negotiations with IJakki Pashi; they have also examined, with close attention, the memoran dum communicated by his Highness on the 1st May, comprising a list of various concessions to which the Imperial Ottoman Government desire that His Majesty’s Government should give their assent. These documents may be dealt with under their several headings as follows :— 1. A convention relating to the establishment •of a Commission to improve the conditions •of navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab; and a ^declaration, annexed to the convention, providing for the representation on the Commission of neighbouring, but non-Turkish, de facto interests in the river. His Majesty’s Government are prepared to adhere to both these instruments, subject to a modification in article 21 of the convention, increasing its minimum duration to a period of | sixty years, as in the case of'Gonvontion No. 5 {vide infra). Since the assent of His Majesty’s Government to the increased customs duties is requested for an unlimited period, and not merely for seven years, His Majesty’s Government trust that the Imperial Ottoman Government will raise no objection to such a modification of article 21. 2. A convention, with a secret declaration annexed, providing for the settlement of the respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. To these documents His Majesty’s Government are prepared to adhere. 3. A declaration, with the necessary maps, indicating the line of the Turco-Persian frontier from the region of Hawizeh to the sea. His Majesty’s Government are willing to join in this declaration ; they understand, however, that an agreement providing for the settlement of .the remaining part of the Turco-Persian frontier [754] I— will likewise be concluded forthwith. As the Ottoman Government are aware, His Majesty’s Government attach the greatest importance to the conclusion of this arrangement. 4. A convention relating to conditions of railway transport, and a declaration providing for the terminus of the Bagdad Railway to be at Basra. His Majesty’s Government are satisfied with the terms of this convention, provided the words “ Turquie d’Asie” are substituted for “Asie Mineup ” where they occurthe proposed declaration as to the terminus being at Basra is of cardinal importance. 5. A declaration respecting river navigation on the Euphrates and Tigris. Elis Majesty’s Government are prepared to accept this declaration as a satisfactory settlement of the question, subject of course to the adjust ment of details between the Imperial Ottoman Government and the concessionnaire. 6. A declaration regarding the borrowing powers, of Egypt; ^ The points to which the assent of His Majesty’s Government is desired by the Imperial Ottoman Government are five :— 1. An increase to 15 per cent, ad valorem of the' Turkish import duties. It will be recalled that in 1907 His Majesty’s Government,, in. concert with the other Powers concerned, agreed to the increase of the Turkish import duties-from 8 per cent, to 11 per centJjfor a specified purpose and for a limited period of seven years, which expires in 1914. In their note of July 1912 His Majesty’s Government expressed their readiness, ow stated conditions^— “ to the maintenance, for a period of seven years, ..... of the increase in the general rate of customs duty leviable on British goods on importation into the Ottoman Empire from 8 per cent, to 11 per cent, ad valorem which was agreed to in 1907, and also to the further increase of this general rate of customs duty from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem for the same period.” The present request of the Ottoman Govern ment goes considerably beyond this concession nevertheless, on the successful conclusion of the negotiations which have been proceeding with His Highness Hakki Pasha in London, His Majesty’s Government are prepared to agree to3 the levy on British, imports of 15 per cent, ad valorem without stipulating for a limitation of the period during which such a rate shall be enforced. It must, however, be distinctly understood that this assent of His Majesty’s Government is sub ject to two further conditions, firstly that the assent of other Powers concerned is obtained to the levy of a similar rate on their respective imports, and secondly that a period of notice, of not less than six months, is given before the increased duties are levied. ), 2. The eventual substitution of a specific tariff, to be fixed by mutual agreement, for the proposed 15 per cent, ad valorem rate. Provided that such a change meets with the | approval of other Powers, His Majesty’s Govern- | ment would be prepared to agree to it in princi ple, subject to the following conditions-:— (a.) The details of the scheme of conversion must be previously agreed between Great Britain and Turkey. (b.) No such tariff, even when i't has been agreed upon, shall be put into operation without a reasonable period of notice, which in any case shall exceed twelve months. (c.) The Imperial Ottoman Government shall previously make a declaration that the rights at present enjoyed by His Majesty’s Government, whether under or by virtue of capitulations, treaties, notes, declarations, or otherwise, to veto any increase in the duties leviable on British imports into Turkey shall be in no wise modified, prejudiced, or invalidated by the fact of His Majesty’s Government consenting to the intro duction of a specific tariff, or by any other act or thing whatsoever, other than the express renuncia tion in writing by His Majesty’s Government of their rights to exercise such a veto. 3. The imposition of the “temettu” tax on British subjects on condition of its impo sition on all foreigners in Turkey. This question is the subject of active negotia tion at the present time between the Imperial Ottoman Government and the Embassies at Constantinople, and His Majesty’s Government would hesitate to institute collateral negotiations in London, since to do so might lead to mis understanding and misconstruction.4. The abolition, in principle, of foreign post o ffices in Turkey; and, pending their abolition r the sale of Ottoman stamps. Though certain Powers have, His Majesty’s Government are well aware, given a conditional assent to the abolition of their respective post offices in Turkey, the question-is one in which it is impossible for His Majesty’s Government to dissociate themselves from the collective action of the Powers. They are, however, prepared, subject to the assent of other Powers to a similar step, to agree to the abolition of British post offices in principle, on the understanding that no- such abolition shall be effected until they are satisfied that the Ottoman postal administration affords adequate guarantees of security and promptitude in transmission of correspondence. His Majesty’s Government have no primd facie objection to the sale of Turkish instead of British stamps ; but it would be necessary to surcharge the stamps used in the British post offices, and the technical details would have to be submitted to careful expert examination so as to avoid difficulties of accountancy and interference with the British local administration. If the other Powers concerned agreed to a similar change in principle, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to appoint a delegate to enquire whether the change is practicable. 5. To study the question of the abolition of the Capitidations. As the Imperial Ottoman Government are aware, His Majesty’s Government have con sistently maintained that, inter alia, their right to veto the increase of taxation on British subjects and merchandise is derived from the capitulations, and this right they are not prepared to abandon. Pending the introduction of drastic reforms in the Turkish judicial administration, His Majesty’s Government feel that, it would be somewhat premature even to study the possibility of abolish- thecapitulations. None the less, they are prepared,, if the other Powers agree to such a course, to appoint representatives to examine how far the existing conditions under the capitulations are- capable of improvement.•CONFIDENT! AI Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. LowtJier (Constantinople). (ho. 229.) R. ^ Foreign Office, May 29, 1913, 8 p.m. YOUR telegram No. 247 Hakki Pasha yesterday communicated a telegram from Constantinople urging the acceptance of the line indicated in your Excellency’s telegram from Kuretu to Mendali. He claimed that this was the actual status quo, and that if, instead of it, the Anglo- Russian line were accepted, Turkey would lose substantial revenues which she has long collected on naphtha products. He said that the Turkish acceptance of the status quo was the utmost concession which could he made in that region, and represented a very great diminution of Turkey’s previous claims as recently put forward. If the Russian Government agree I think it would he wise to accept the present Turkish proposal respecting the frontier between Kuretu and Mendali; but if they regard it as undesirable to accept it off-hand, it might be left to the British and Russian commissioners on the boundary mission to determine what is the status quo. There is, however, serious objection to such a course, since, in the light of past experience, it is likely to lead to local intrigue before the mission arrives, and there is undoubtedly much to be said for getting Turkish assent to a fixed line at once, and restricting the work of the mission to demarcating the frontier. If, therefore, the Russian Government agree you may accept the Turkish proposal for the line south of Kuretu. As regards the rest of the Zohab region, you may negotiate a line, in concert with your Russian colleague, on the basis of mv telegram No. 220 The important point is to get the Turks to accept a definite line on the map without delay, and then to appoint a boundary commission as soon as possible. It might even be prudent to appoint two boundary commissions, so as to expedite matters by starting work simultaneously from Zohab both north and south. I understand from Hakki that Turkish Government would like British and Russian commissioners to assist in the demarcation of the whole frontier. Your Excellency should communicate a copy of this telegram to your Russian colleague, and keep me advised of developments, as it seems obvious that pressure exercised through Hakki Pasha is not without effect.

(No. 247.) 1L • (May 27, 4 ’45 p.m.) 1ESTERDAY the Russian Ambassador and I had conversations with the Grand Vizier, who stated that our proposals in the Zohab districts are unacceptable. His Highness showed himself inclined to maintain his demands in northern part, and in the south desires territory west of following line :— From Kuretu along the road as far as north end of main ridge of Ak Dagh Mountains, then past Kale Sabze to Kani Biz, on Elvend River. From this point line to run (see sheet 5 of reduced identic map) through letter U of Zeynelkous through letter G of Tchia Sourkh and G of Guerra due south to Deshti KourmaRiver, which, it follows to the Jebel Hamrine Mountains and along that range to Mandeli. As regards northern part, I understand that I am authorised to negotiate a line in agreement with the Russian Ambassador. As to the part south of Kuretu River, his Highness appears to have been informed that this line, described above, represents the actual status quo, and the Russian Ambassador and I think that he will not be induced to recede from it, as he described it to my Russian colleague as his minimum demand. Although this frontier is unsatisfactory both on topographical grounds and because it places part of Sinjabi territor}^ in Turkey, it will be difficult for Grand Vizier unless the concession is made to defend before Parliament frontier settlement as a whole. Perhaps in agreeing to Grand Vizier’s require[ments] south of Kuretu, which village he also desires to obtain, we may abate some of his demands farther north. Russian Ambassador has telegraphed in foregoing sense to his Government. I have communicated to his Excellency substance of your telegram No. 220 of 21 st May.

I HAAE the honour to transmit to you herewith, for your approval, draft of a note to the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs, communicating to the Sublime Porte the An glo-Russian counter-proposals with regard to the modifications of the Turco-Persian frontier in the Zohab district, as laid down in the draft identic memorandums forwarded to you in my despatch No. 352 of the 25th instant. The substance of the main part of this draft note is, mutatis mutandis, the same as that of the corresponding Russian note, the draft of which will be in your possession before this despatch reaches you ; but I should point out that, as reported in my telegram No. 208 of the 28th instant, M. de Giers has agreed to modify the sixth paragraph of his note, so as to provide for the insertion in the final instrument of agreement as to the frontier of an article stipulating for the recognition by Turkey of the rights of the Anglo-Persian Oil Syndicate in the territories that may be ceded to her by the readjustment of the frontier. The end of this paragraph now runs as follows:— “ H est evident que cette cession doit etre preceded d’un arrangement garantissant le maintien des droits et des privileges appartenant a la compagnie anglaise etablie a Tchia-Sourkh, maintien qui serait stipule dans Facte definitif a conclure au sujet de la delimitation.” This wording leaves it open to us to add a paragraph at the end of the note defining our requirements in this matter with more precision ; but in view of the opinion expressed in the last paragraph of your despatch No. 405 of the 29th August, 1912, that it is desirable to take legal opinion as to the formula to be employed, I have not attempted to draft it.

Sir, Constantinople, April 26, 1913. WITH reference to my telegram No. 196 of the 16th instant, 1 have the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a memorandum, showing the Hue which my Russian colleague and I have agreed to recommend to our Governments as the future Turco- Per si an frontier in the Zohab district. If the line is approved by His Majesty’s and the Russian Governments M. de Giers proposes to append this memorandum to a note which he will address to the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs, in accordance with the promise of a further communication on the subject of the frontier in these districts contained in his note to the Porte of the 10 th April (my despatch No. 302 of the 12 th April). M. de Giers has been so good as to furnish me with the draft of this note, which he is about to submit to the approval of his Government, and I enclose a copy of these herewith. This document, which in substance is a reply to the annexe to the Turkish note to his Excellency of the 31st March, on the one hand rebuts the arguments adduced by the Porte in support of Turkish proposals for the modification of the frontier, and on the other explains the reasons which, we consider, justify our counter-proposals. The draft note ends by suggesting that Great Britain and Russia should be represented in the commission which is to be appointed for the actual demarcation of the new frontier line. f The description of the frontier given in our memorandum is based on the original identic map, a photographic reproduction of which, produced in St. Petersburgh in or about the year 1873, has recently been discovered at the Russian Embassy, and which, as it contained greater and more accurate detail than the reduced copy prepared at the Survey Office at Southampton in that year, seem more suitable for the purpose. There is, however, no difficulty in following the proposed line on the latter map. The frontier that we suggest corresponds in the main with the second proposals of Messrs. Orloff and Soane and, therefore, provides for the cession of Tchia Sourkh to Turkey, but our recommendations differ from that proposition in that they reserve to Persia the district south ofShemiran, to the east of the Bn mu range, and also the valley of Serkala. As regards the former district, we have thought it as well to keep some further concession in reserve in the event of further bargaining with the Porce, while as to the latter, apart from the reasons set forth in my telegram No. 152 of the 18th ultimo, the Russian Ambassador is unwilling to cede the valley to 'Turkey, as it possesses some strategic value in the facility it offers for attack on the town of Zohab. We have entirely declined to accede to the Turkish pretensions to the Sinjabi and Kalhur districts south of Zohab, although we suggest that the opportunity should be taken to reach a settlement of the long-standing dispute about Genguir. 1 only received the enclosed document from M. de Giers yesterday evening, and it has been impossible to prepare a corresponding draft note for presentation to the Porte in time to transmit it to you for your approval by this post. The form of M. de Giers’s note, and the fact that no written negotiations on the present phase of the Turco-Persian frontier negotiations have yet taken place between the Turkish Government and ourselves here, precludes the possibility of an absolutely identic note, and I therefore propose to prepare and forward to you by next post a draft embodying the arguments employed in the Russian draft and to attach it to the memorandum on Zohab. I venture to hope that by this means the identic character of our communications on this point will be sufficiently preserved, but the final form of the note cannot be suggested by me, as I am not yet in possession of the text of Hakki Pasha’s written communication. Unless you consider that a separate communication on the subject is preferable I [2874 gg —4] [B] PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL.

Sir Edward Grey to Count Benckendorff. HIS Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Russian Ambassador and has the honour to acknowledge the receipt of his Excellency’s communication relative to the question whether the part of Zohab, in which are situated the oil wells of Chia-Surkh, should, under the settlement of the Turco-Persian frontier, about to be concluded, remain Persian or be transferred to Turkey. Sir Edward Grey has not, of course, lost sight of the fact that he consented to the settlement of this question on the basis of the transfer to Turkey of the region in question, althougn His Majesty’s Government would have preferred that it should be retained for Persia had such an arrangement been found possible. The reason for this preference is that a British enterprise, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company hold, as the Russian Government are doubtless aware, a concession to exploit the oilfields in certain parts of Persia, and have actually begun operations in the district in question, Sir E. Grey feared that, if this region became Turkish, it might be difficult to secure and to maintain the rights acquired by this British company from the Persian Government against possible disregard by the Power in whose territory the field of their operations would then lie. As soon, however, as Sir E. Grey learned that it would, in the opinion of the Russian Ambassador at Constantinople, be difficult to obtain the consent of the Turkish Government to this further concession, he at once instructed His Majesty’s Ambassador to revert to the basis of negotiation previously agreed to and to assent to the cession of this district to Turkey, on the condition that the rights of the British company there are duly safeguarded. Foreign Office, April 28, 1913.[This Document is the Property o f His Britannic Majesty s THE line proposed by bis Highness Hakki Pasha, in his communication of the 7th instant, as that of the frontier between Turkey and Persia, in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah, begins at the point where the Shatt-i-Niasan leaves the Khor-el-Azam. His Majesty’s Government would prefer the point previously recommended by them, he., where the Khor-el-Muhaisin joins the Khor-el-Azam. In view, however, of the wish expressed by the Turkish Government that the frontier in this region should lie further to the east, His Majesty’s Government would be willing to agree to a line starting from the place known as Unun-Chir, where the Khor-el-Donvil leaves the Khor-el-Azam. The position of Unun-Chir is accurately known, and is 9 miles to the east of the point previously recommended by His Majesty’s Government (the junction of the Khor-el-Muhaisin and the Khor-el-Azam), and 9 miles to the north-west of Bisaitin, a place situated on latitude 31° IS' 29A From Unun-Chir the line proceeds in a south-westerly direction, and joins at longitude 43° the line previously recommended by His Majesty’s Government at the southern extremity of the small sheet of open water, apparently also known as Azam, which is to be found in the Khor-el-Azam at some distance north-west of Shnaile. From this point the line continues south, as previously recommended by His Majesty’s Government, but stops at latitude 31°, when it is deflected due east, and continues along that parallel to a point just north-east of Kushk-i-Basra, thus including that spot in Turkish territory. This compromise is made as a proof of the friendly desire of His Majesty’s Government to satisfy the Turkish Government, who it appears are anxious that Kushk-i-Basra should be recognised as Turkish. From the point just mentioned the line proceeds south, striking the Shatt-el-Arab at the point originally proposed by His Majesty’s Government, and continuing to follow the direction recommended by them throughout the remainder of its course. As regards the reference in Hakki Pasha’s communication to the position of Bahrie, it would appear that the island cited by his Highness as passing under that name is the more northern of the two islands lying between Muhalla (or Hajji Salbuq) and the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab (the more southern island being known as Gata), while the island marked as Bahrie on the map enclosed in Sir E. Grey’s note of the 18th July last is the more southern of the two islands lying between Muhalla and the left bank. As the first-mentioned Bahrie has not been claimed for Persia, nor the last- mentioned for Turkey, it is unnecessary further to discuss this point. Foreign Office, April 15, 1913. CONFIDENTIAL.

Foreign Office, May 21, 1913, 5‘55 p.m. RUSSIAN Ambassador at Constantinople has been instructed to protest energetically against a reported violation of Persian territory at Siro, near Gangatchine and Baradost, and to request its immediate evacuation by the Turks, who are alleged to be cultivating the occupied districts. Russian Government fear that if such violations of territory recur they will be obliged to take more energetic steps, and they ask that your Excellency should be instructed to support your Russian colleague. You should do this verbally, and you should point out that such incidents are particularly regrettable when the whole frontier question is on the eve of settlement.

Foreign Office, May 21, 1913, 6*45 p.m. YOUR Excellency’s despatches Nos. 271, 352, and 360. Hakki Pasha stated to-day that, having himself been the first to recommend to the Grand Vizier the procedure of direct negotiation with Great Britain and Russia on the Turco-Persian question, he had now been asked by his Highness for his observations and advice regarding the line proposed by your Excellency and the Russian Ambassador for the Zohab region. He said he was sincerely anxious to reach a final settlement, and he therefore proposed to telegraph advising the Grand Vizier that he should offer, as an equitable compromise, to accept the Turkish line down to a point about 4 miles below Mount Sengler (where the Turkish and Anglo-Russian lines converge), and, as regards the line thence to the south, the proposed Anglo- Russian line, with the sole proviso as to this portion of the frontier that, while it should be accepted as the recognised basis of settlement, it should be subject to such minor rectifications as might be recommended by the Commission of Demarcation ; and he further said that he trusted that Russian and British officers would be attached to the commission, and accompany it along the whole frontier from Mount Ararat to the Persian Gulf. His Excellency seemed anxious to know how this compromise would be viewed here. He was informed that, since the negotiations were being conducted at Con stantinople, it would be preferable to avoid any expression of opinion here as to its merits, but that no harm could be done by making the suggestion at Constantinople. Hakki Pasha then urged very strongly that the compromise might be favourably considered ; it was, he said, very moderate, and it represented the abandonment of very considerable Turkish claims and a genuine effort to reach a final settlement of the whole frontier question. I think, for this reason, that it would be prudent to adopt this compromise, as it merely involves making the concession to Turkey which your Excellency and your Russian colleague have, I believe, considered possible in the last resort. You should furnish Russian Ambassador with a copy of this telegram and discuss the subject fully with him. The need for an early settlement was again impressed on Hakki Pasha.

ITTILA-UL MULK called at the embassy this morning and enquired whether we were aware of the terms of the Turkish reply to the Russian note of the 22nd August, 1912, on the subject of the Turco-Persian frontier question, and, on receiving a reply in the affirmative, asked what we thought of the Turkish proposals for territorial conces sions in the Zohab district. He was informed by Mr. Marling that we considered at first sight that the Turkish requirements were excessive, hut as they were based on the principle that only Sunni tribes should be placed under Turkish rule they could not, as regards the districts south of the Eivand River, be substantiated, as those regions were occupied by the Sinjabi and Kalhur tribes which we believed to be wholly Shia. Ittila- ul-Mulk said that this was not so, as there were several subdivisions of the Sinjabis which were Sunni, but he could not say what proportion they formed of the whole tribe. Mr. Marling observed that if they formed only a small section of the tribe there would, he thought, be a strong case against endeavouring to split up a large and important tribe like the Sinjabis, an arrangement which could only lead to troubles on the frontier, and he pointed out also that the Turkish proposal involved placing the winter quarters of the Sinjabis in Turkish territory, while their summer quarters would still be in Persia, which was again a most unpractical arrangement. Ittila-uLMulk went on to say that the only Sunni tribes that he knew of m the Zohab were those inhabiting the Kuretu district. ^ As regards the prolongation of the mixed commission (which formed the subject of your telegram No. 156 of the 28th March), Ittila-ul-Mulk said that the Persian Ambassador had not requested any instructions from Tehran, but was awaiting a communication on the subject from the Porte, 1 have, &amp;c.

I am not in favour of dissolution of commission for reasons given in my telegram No. 88 of 1st February to Sir G. Buchanan. Hakki Pasha has, moreover, just made proposals for settling the frontier to the Grand Vizier privately, involving acceptance of the Russian line in the north and of our line in the south. Some compensation to Turkey in the centre would be necessary, and his Highness was to let us know the Turkish views on this point. If a settlement can be arrived at informally of this nature, the commission will provide a convenient machinery for registering it. The Russian Government have approved of the recommendation made by Hakki Pasha. You might continue to press the Grand Vizier to settle the question without any further delay, if your Russian colleague agrees, but the private negotiations with Hakki Pasha had better not be mentioned to the Grand Vizier, as the proposal is supposed to emanate from Hakki Pasha alone.CONFIDENTIAL. s w , f-.. . -.-J, I Si i 3 Sir Edward Grey to Sir G.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 75 of the 6th instant, I have the honour to report that I have been in consultation with the Russian Embassy on the subject of the cession of territory in the neighbourhood of Zohab, which it may be found advisable to make to Turkey in connection with the settlement of the Turco-Persian frontier question, and M. de Giers has informed me as I reported in my telegram No. 152 of the 18th instant, that he sees no objection to the adoption in principle of the hue which you consider might be recommended for that purpose to the two interested Governments. His Excellency, however, considers, and I am quite in agreement with him, that the line must be adopted as only approximative and as liable to modifications to suit the local tribal conditions. I was also informed that information in the possession of the Russian Embassy showed that the inhabitants of the plain of Serkala belong to the Shia sect of Islam, and it was therefore suggested that it might be advisable to deflect the line as proposed by Messrs. Orloff and Soane, so as to leave the Serkala Plain in Persian territory. It was pointed out in reply to this suggestion that if this was the case it would certainly have been known to Messrs. Orloff and Soane, who in their proposals had given due weight to religious considerations and wmuld not therefore in this instance have disregarded them without adequate reason. M. de Giers, however, was anxious to set the matter at rest and said that he would ask M. Orloff, who was about to proceed to Russia overland, to go via the Zohab district to examine the question on the spot if the state of his health permitted. M. Orloff has now replied that he will start on the proposed journey in a very few days and M. de Giers sent to inform me yesterday that he desires to reserve his final observations on the proposed line until he has received M. Orloff’s report. Hence the delay in sending the despatch promised in my above- mentioned telegram. I have not suggested that Mr. Soane should accompany M. Orloff as the points to be ascertained appear to be of very small importance.

[2836 hh —4] ^•rfVye.o *&gt; AC ' / f' i7APR^13f/ ,/ SEC RY’$ 02!6_J[This Document is the Property of Kis Britannic Majesty’s Government,] I HAVE read with much interest the suggestions formulated by Hakki Pasha for the settlement of the Turco-Persian frontier question which you were so good as to communicate to me in your telegram No. 132 of the 9th instant (repeating your telegram No. 204 of the same date to Sir G. Buchanan). The first three points are, I venture to think, entirely acceptable, but No. 4 calls for some observations. We can, I think, subscribe in general to the principle that the Sunni tribes should be placed under Turkey—the principle “ Sunni for lurkey and Shia for Persia ” clearly had considerable influence with MM. Orlof and Soane in laving down the line- which you are disposed to adopt for the purposes of making certain territorial cessions to Turkey—but I think that it would be more prudent in view of the rather imperfect state of our knowledge of the Zohab district not to adopt it as a rigid rule. 1 must confess that I do not understand what is intended by the request loi cessions to Turkey of districts north-east and south of Zohab, and of some locality near Mendeli. So far as I am aware the districts to the north-east and south of Zohab are inhabited by Shiite tribes, and therefore could not be included in Hakki Pasha’s claim that Sunni tribes are to pass to Turkey, and it would, therefore, I submit, be well to ascertain what districts are contemplated so that we may be in a position to get more precise information before committing ourselves to any expiession of opinion on Hakki Pashas proposal, The same prudence should be observed in connection with any cession in the neighbourhood of Mendeli, which town, accoidmg to Captain D. L. R. Lorimer’s report on Pusht-i-Kuh, is quite close to the boundaries of Pusht-i-Kuh. The Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh is a powerful and semi-independent Persian chieftain, and anv arrangement that would give him plausible ground for grievance should be avoided. There are one or two places on the iurco-Pusht-i-Kuh border such as Sevid Hussein Kale and the Baksai lands which are a source of constant dispute between the Turks and the Vali, and it is possible that one ol these is the district alluded to by Hakki Pasha : they can, however, be scarcely described as near Mendeli. , , . .,i .i I understand that the Russian Ambassador is m general agreement with the foregoing observations. % ' ; t Q i 'w w o PERSIA ““{March 26.] CONFIDENTIAL.

Maps referred to in the remarks which follow are the four maps accompanying memorandum of 18th July to Turkish Ambassador and two maps forwarded with Captain Wilson’s report of 5th July. 1 . Sentence in your telegram referring to “Neshva” is not intelligible to me. Name is presumably another spelling of “ Neshweh,” but latter place is on Shatt-el- Arab, south of Kurna (vide map above mentioned and p. 98 of “ Gazetteer”). 2 . In settling the precise boundary north of Shuaib the main object is to give Turks no footing on terra firma on the east of marsh, as this is within the sphere of influence of the Beni-Turuf. In any case the exit of the Shatt-i-Niasam is an inconvenient point to refer to, because it is not accurately fixed. I would urge that we take Bisaitin as our basis of calculation, as this settlement has been astronomically determined. If any concession is made here, I would suggest instead taking the line from entry of the Ghor-el-Muhaisin, 18 miles west of Bisaitin ; we might agree to shift line 9 miles to the eastward, and take it from the exit of Ghor-el-Douvil; that is the place referred to as “Umm Chir ” in paragraph 6 of Captain Wilson’s report, dated 5th July. From there, line should proceed south-west and join our line at the southern extremity of small sheet of open water alluded to in paragraph 5 of same report. 3. As regards southern portion of boundary: provided our line from Kishk-i-Basri to Shatt-el-Arab is accepted without further modification, I see no serious objection to angle of our line at Kishk-i-Basri being shifted northward just sufficiently to bring that point into the corner of Turkish territory, but at any rate not higher than 31st degree of latitude. But I would urge absolute necessity for insisting on accept ance of our line from Kishk-i-Basri to the Shatt-el-Arab. 4. As regards Bahriya, I think discrepancy is due to confusion of names. Island referred to by Turks is presumably that mentioned on p. 253 of “ Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.” That is to say, it is the uppermost of two islands shown on the right bank without names in our map No. 3. On the other hand, the island appearing as “ Bahriyeh,” on the left bank, is part of ground referred to under the enumeration “ Salbuq,” at p. 1653 of “ Gazetteer.” In these circumstances, is further local enquiry desired ?

Cox “Turkish Government propose following line for Turco-Persian frontier in neighbourhood of Mohammerah :— “Line starts from point where Shatt-i-Niasan runs into Hor-el-Azam. This point is situated between Nesheva (administrative centre of commune of same name dependent on kaza of Kurna) and Hawiza, about nine hours west of latter. Line follows edge of Hor-el-Azam in south-westerly direction, leaving to Turkey that part of Hor lying north of Shuaib, which by our line goes to Persia. At point where Nahr Larvi runs into Hor, west of Shuaib, line joins our line and coincides with it, leaving to Persia all Hor south of Shuaib as far as point on level with Kushk-i-Hawiza (i.e., about latitude 31° S'). Line then leaves our line, striking slightly south of east and passing north of some tents of Beni-Sakain (thus including them in Turkey). t passes south of Kushk-i-Hawize and north of Kuskh-i-Basra (leaving former to Persia and latter to Turkey) and continues east till slightly beyond longitude 48 15 , when it turns slightly west of south, and so continues till it strikes Shatt-el-Arab opposite island of Umm-el-Hassassif, leaving Failie just in Persia. _ . “ For the rest of the way it coincides with our line, except that it gives island ot Bahrie to Turkey on ground that it lies south of Persian island of Muhalla^whereas on our maps it is marked as lying north of Muhalla, and is therefore assigned to Persia. “We cannot, I think, allow any territory inhabited by Beni-Sakain or other tribes dependent on Hawize to be given to Turkey, nor let line turn south towards Shatt-el- Arab at any point further east than our own line, as that would bring fiontier too near to Mohammerah, but do you see any objection to cession to Turkey of (1) part of Hor-el-Azam lying north of Shuaib, assigned by us to Persia, and (2) Kushk-i-Basra itself, which appears to lie just on Persian side of our own proposed line? Turkish Government are anxious for latter concession. “ Can you also ascertain true position of Bahrie ? ” (Repeated to Constantinople, No. 174.) |554—271]Sir G.

[12714] No. 1 . / Report by Mr. Shipley.—{Received at Foreign Office, March 19, 1913.) The Turco-Persian Frontier Commission, 1912. THE subjects dealt with by the commission from the 25th March (The date of its first sitting) to the 25th October (the date of its prolongation for three months) were the following, viz. : — }■ ^he question of the acceptance by the Persian delegates of the explanatory note relating to Mohammerah attached to the treaty of 1848, the Turkish delegates declaring at the outset of the proceedings of the commission that the note in question, which formed an integral part of the treaty, must also be taken into consideration. 2 . Zohab and the claims of the respective parties to that province. 3. The limits of Suleimanieh as defined by the Persian and Turkish delegates respectively. The arguments respecting the first of these questions will be found in Proces- verbaux Nos. 3 to 5. Briefly put, the contention of the Turkish delegates was to the effect that the Ottoman Government had only consented to ratify the Treaty of Erzeroum of 1848 on the express stipulation that the conditions constituting the explanatory note were accepted by the Persian Government, and on formal notification being given to the Porte by the representatives of the two mediating Powers, viz., Great Britain and Russia on the 26th February, 1848, of the acceptance by’ that Government through its plenipotentiary, Mirza Mehmed Ali Khan, of the note in question as an integral part of the treaty. The chief arguments made use of by the Persians were— ( 1 .) That as their Government had no knowledge of this note it could not form an integral part of the Treaty of Erzeroum. (2.) That the note in question constituted a modification of the provisions of the aforesaid treaty ; and, lastly, that, as in order to conclude or modify a treaty the plenipotentiaries of both parties must be invested with full powers, the Anglo-Russian note of 1848 could not be admitted by the Persian Government, Mirza Mehmed Ali Khan not having full powers for this modification. At the sitting, however, of the commission of the 15th August (Proces-verbal No. 17) this question, which had formed the subject of no little discussion between tbe i espective parties, was at length disposed of by the unconditional acceptance by the Persian delegates of the note as forming an integral part of the treaty. 2. Zohab. —The question of the delimitation of this province and of the claims of Persia and Turkey respectively thereto was dealt with by the commission in the sittings from the 15th April to the 11 th July {Proces-verbaux Nos. 4 to 13). The limits of this province were given by the Persian delegates in Proces-verbal No. 4, as being formed on the south by the River Elwend as far as its junction with the Shirwan, and from this latter point by the course of the last-mentioned river up to its junction with the River Zimkian {vide Colonel Sheil’s map attached to the Foreign Office memorandum of the 8 th December, 1906). Of the share in the province in question claimed by the Persian delegates. According to their interpretation of the provisions of article 2 of the Treaty of Erzeroum, by which the mountainous part with the valley of Kerrind is given to Persia, it is sufficient to say that it is practically identical with the line claimed by their predecessors in the commission of 1848-1852, as shown in Colonel Shed’s map above referred to. At the succeeding sitting {Proces-verbal No. 5) a definition of the limits of Zohab based upon the land registers of the vilayet of Bagdad dating from 951 a.h. (1544 A.D.) was given by the Turkish delegates in their turn. Previously, however, to giving this definition certain districts, such as Kouretou, Tilekou, Ilourine, and Pusht-i-Kuh, were excluded [2836 1 ] B*■&gt; by the latter from Zohab altogether, it being maintained by them that, as the registers above quoted showed, these districts formed part of the Bagdad vilayet and Suleimanieh sanjak respectively. Of the province of Zohab thus reduced the western boundary would be formed by the Assengheran range beginning from the starting-point of the latter on the Elwend Biver, while the northern boundary would be constituted by a line which, starting from a point terminus north of Mount Assengheran and passing by the ^ summits of Mounts Bemou, Gare, and Bizel, would terminate at the commune of Pave. The Ottoman delegates then proceeded to quote the clause of article 2 of the Treaty of Erzeroum relating to Zohab, the meaning of which, according to them, was clearly that the term “mountainous districts ” (i.e., the eastern portion of Zohab to be awarded to Persia) could only include 1 ! that part where the mountains v» r ere situated, and that this technical definition, could not be made to comprise mere hills, broken ground, and elevations which could not be called mountains. The expression, moreover, made use of in the clause in question, viz. (mountainous districts) “ with the valley of Kerrind,” was held by the Ottoman delegates to define what was the eastern portion of Zohab, the limits of which according to this phrasing could not extend further than the said valley. The division of Zohab into eastern and western parts was then laid down by the Ottoman commissioners as follows :— Kerrind should be taken on the right and the foot of the mountains followed as far as the sanjak of Suleimanieh, always leaving these latter to Persia and the valleys to the left to Turkey. The names of the mountains here referred to by the Turkish delegates were not designated, and there is thus some uncertainty as to the precise line of demarcation intended by them. From the general tenour of their argument, however, it is clear that the line in question does not differ essentially from that laid down by the Ottoman commissioners in 1851 as shown in Colonel Sheil’s map above referred to, and that, with the exception, possibly, of the additional pretension put forward by the present Turkish commissioners to reduce the limits of Zohab itself, neither Ottoman nor Persian claims have undergone any modification since the last-mentioned date. i he discussions on the Zohab question occupied the attention of the commission from the 2 nd May to the 11 th July, and the arguments made use of by the respective parties in this connection were embodied in the Proces-verbanx Nos. 5 to 13. Generally speaking, the main point on which the arguments all through these discussions appeared to turn was the question of the validity of the documents which, according to the statement of the Ottoman delegates, proved land registration by the lurkish Government in the districts in dispute dating from the year 1544 a.d., and on which the former relied not only as proof of ow nership, but also as proof that these districts formed part of the province of Suleimanieh, and had never belonged to Zohab as had been asserted by their Persian colleagues. By the Persian delegates it was maintained— (l.) That Government registration of lands when in temporary occupation of that Government could not be accepted as proof of title, and that such registration, being a unilateral act, could not constitute proof of ownership, as otherwise any act of forcible seizure would, by jts being placed on the land registers, create rights for the aggressor. (Proces-verbaux Nos. 6 and 12 .) ( 2 .) That, further, such registration would be valid only provided it were in conformity wit Ip treaties still existing and in force, and in that case it would be the treaty from which this registration would derive its validity, for the mere act of registration could not serve as proof. Unless, therefore, the Ottoman Government should produce a treaty in force with Persia, dated 1544 a.d., justifying this registra tion, the possession by it (of these lands) is nothing but an usurpation ; while as regards the treaty of 1140 a.h. (1727 a.d.), (quoted by the Ottoman delegates), independent of the question of the existence of its original, its stipulations were annulled by the treaty of 1148 a.h. {Proces-verbaux Nos. 8 and 10 .) (3.)^ That the argument as to the validity of registration when sanctioned by treaty did not apply on the present occasion, as there were no treaties in force at the date of the registration mentioned by the Ottoman delegates, and there was no treaty remaining in force ever since, except that of Erzeruum of 1848. (Proces-verbal No. 8 .) V With reference to the question of the boundaries of Zohab as distinct from that of its ownership, it was argued by the Persian delegates that, in addition to the testimonyof Khurshid Effendi and Dervish Pasha (a former Ottoman commissioner), the latter of whom, in his pamphlet on the matter, had placed Kouretou among other districts within the limits of that province, the boundaries of Zohab given by them the Persian delegates—in Proces-vevbal No. 4 were such as had been established by the Ottoman Commissioners of 1850. Lastly, while it was true that the territorial situation of the two States on the frontier had at all times been subject to change, it was evident that the Zohab mentioned in the Treaty of Erzeroum (of 1848) could not be conceived as having boundaries other than those which it could be conceived to have in^ 1847, and it was to fix the said limits in this sense that the Turkish and Persian commissioners were sent to the frontier in 1850. ( Proces-verbaux Nos. 6 and 12 .) The case for the Ottoman delegates, as presented by the latter, was • ( 1 .) That the land registration referred to by them in Proces-verbal No. 5, dating as it did from 1544 a.d., and consequently long anterior to the subsequent conquest by Turkey of Luristan, Khuzistan, and Persian Arabistan, sanctioned by the furco-Russian treaty of 1136 a.h., and by that concluded with Persia in 1140 A.H., could not be regarded as having been effected during a merely temporary occupation. Mere occupations of territory not sanctioned by treaty, such as those of Sultans Selim and Suleiman and others, or conquests, such as those of Khuzistan, &amp;c., referred to a 3 o\ e, sanctioned by treaties which had been subsequently modified, were not invoked ^ y them, their claims being based on authentic documents which were in conformity wit i treaties in force. (Proces-verbal No. 7.) ( 2 .) That the assertion made by the Persian delegates that there were no treaties in force except that of Erzeroum was directly contrary to article 9 of the sam treaty, and could hardly, therefore, be made the subject of serious discussion, the other treaties in force being, in fact, confirmed by the Treaty of Erzeroum itself. As this lattei treaty, moreover, had confirmed to Turkey the possession of Suleimameh, the l an d reoisters showing the boundaries of that province were documents of an irrefutable nature. The treaty of 1140 a.h. (1727 A.D.), the existence of which had been denied by the Persian delegates, existed none the less but as it had not been invoked by them—the Ottoman delegates—in connection with this subject it was unnecessary to^ enter into details on this matter. (Proces-verbaux Nos. 9 and 11.) ( 3 .) That the production of a, treaty of the date of 1544 a.d. was unnecessary, as they—the Ottoman delegates—had authentic documents establishing their right of legitimate possession, and which, dating from the year in question, were m confoimity with treaties in force concluded since that year. The land registration by Pei sia under the Kajar dynasty, referred to by the Persian delegates in Proces-verbal Ro. 10, enecte at a time when Persian aggressions on Ottoman territory^ were in full course, cou d no constitute authentic documents unless they were in conformity with treaties m force. Further, the priority of the date 1544 a.d. to that of the treaty of 1639 a.d. m no way invalidated the documents in possession of the Ottoman delegates. On t ie contrary, these documents, being in conformity with treaties in force, were confirmed by this priority. Lastly, the validity of the stipulations of the above-mentioned treaty of 1639 could not be denied by the Persian delegates, repeated and confirmed as they were by the subsequent treaties; nor could the Ottoman right of possession, proved by an registration in conformity with existing treaties, constitute an act of forcible seizure, as &amp; the Persian delegates had endeavoured to represent it to be. (I roces-verbaux Nos. 11 and 13.) With regard to the question of the delimitation of Zohab itself, it was contended by the Ottoman delegates (Proces-verbal No. 13) that the contention of their Persian colleagues, viz., that the latter had given the boundaries of that province as accepted by former Ottoman commissioners, was not admissible, for had an arrangement been arrived at between the two parties on the question of these boundaries they the present commissioners—would not have been obliged to discuss it. Ihe commissioners of the two parties, moreover, had not been sent to Zohab to delimitate that province in accordance with a conception incompatible with the stipulations of the treaty o Finally, after maintaining that the opinions of former Turkish commissioners could not be made to serve as documents by virtue of general j uridical principles, as had been contended by the Persian delegates, the discussion on the Zohab question was closed by the Ottoman delegates with the statement that as their Persian colleagues persisted in their views, which were neither in conformity with the spirit of the treaty of Erzeroum nor justified by any document, this question also must be referred to ihe Hague Tribunal. _ [2836 £—1]4 ' . . Suleimanieh. —The discussion of the question of Suleimanieh, which occupied the sittings of the commission from the 11 th July to the 28th August, was opened bv the irersian delegates in Proces-verbal No. 13 with a definition of the line which, in their view, constituted the limits of that province, a definition, of which it is only necessarv o remark that from the point at which it leaves Zohab to where it joins the lesser in the north, it is practically coincident with the boundary of Suleimanieh as at present locally observed, and as shown by the chain dotted line on Colonel Maunsell’s reduction of the identic map (sheet 7 ). the above delimitation of the frontiers of Suleimanieh was followed on the 31st July (Proces-verbal No. U) hy a definition of these frontiers as understood by the lurkish members of the commission, and the wide divergence of views which separated the respective parties on this question will be understood from the fact that this definition of the Ottoman delegates would, if accepted, extend the borders of .Suieimanieh from the eastern shore of the Lake of Urmia to Mount Sahend, near Tabriz and would include in that province districts so far opart as Ushnu, Lahidian B in/ Maragha, Sakiz, in the north, and Pusht-i-Kuh in Zohab, in the south. The argument on which the Turkish delegates based their claim to this great extent of territory was apparently, that the limits of Suleimanieh as above enunciated by them were those {with the exception oi certain sanjaks subsequently detached, and of Mihriban and Avroman, ceded to Persia by the treaty of 1639) which the province in question had finally assumed in 1766, the year when, according to the Ottoman delegates Persian encroachments^ began. The Turkish right to the province as thus constituted was apparently derived by the Ottoman delegates from the specification in the treaty of 1823, by which according to their version, the Persian Government recognised the ancient limits of the Ottoman Empire (laid down by the treaty of 1639, which latter treaty was renewed later by those of 1736 and 1746), and undertook further to deliver up to the Ottoman Empire all the territories and fortresses which during or after t e war had passed into the hands of the Persians, and to abstain from all act of iiggression on or incursion into the sanjaks of Kurdistan and the district of Kurdistan properly so called. In /j 16 g/yen to the above arguments by the Persian delegates at the sitting of the 1 st August (Proces-verbal No. 15) no attempt was made by the latter to discuss in question of the various sanjaks into which, according to the Ottoman delegates Suieimanieh had formerly been divided. Such discussion, it was maintained by the .Persian delegates, was unnecessary, firstly, because the province in question could not r To™ a i havin £ llrmts other than til0se assigned to it by the Treaty of Erzeroum o y and secondly, because, of all the districts enumerated by the Turkish deiegates m Proces-yerbal No. 14, only Serdesht and Beitoush had been mentioned by -the Ottoman commissioners as belonging to Suleimanieh when stating officially at the eleventh conference (in the year 1844) of the Commission of Erzeroum the full extent ot the claims of their Government. _ The argument, however, chiefly relied upon by the Persian delegates in support of their views as regards the limits of Suleimanieh was drawn from articles 2 and 3 of the treaty of 1848 above referred to, by the former of w iich, the Persian delegates maintained, the points on the frontier subject to territorial modification had been settled, while the latter (article 3 ) laid down that at all other points the two parties abandoned their former claims, the meaning of which was that P status P i0 ol 1848 would assume the character of legal ownership. Article 9 of the said treaty could have no bearing on the territorial question, since it was applicable n y w ere omissions existed and since the question of territorial claims was explicitly and peremptordy settled by articles 2 and 3. It followed, further, from the provisions 0 i ns latter article that Serdesht and Beitoush, claimed, as above stated, by the Ottoman Government in 1844, would remain to Persia. T ^ eir arguments on this matter were brought to a conclusion by the Persian 1 £ ^ates with an invitation to their Turkish colleagues to accept the delimitation o Suieimanieh as given m Proces-verbaux Nos. 2 and 13, and to adopt, as frontier rom tie south-west limits of Beitoush to Mount Ararat, the status quo of 1848 which could be re-established without any difficulty whatever, and the maintenance of the principle °1 which had already received recognition by the cession by Persia to Turkey 4 -if P1C s 1 SU( U as A ant ^ -^aokhan as being in the possession of the latter country at the conclusion of the Treaty of Erze roum. The reply given by the Ottoman delegates (Proces-verbal No. 16) to the above argumen s o eir Persian colleagues was of the briefest possible nature, and amounted, m ac , mercy to the statement that they—the Ottoman delegates —could not admit the conclusions arrived at by the Persian delegates, as these conclusions constitutedno answer to the previous Turkish statement on the subject which was based on treaties ^ in force and on documents in conformity with these treaties. The passages further in the statement of the Persian delegates made at the sitting of the 1 st August, which were not compatible with existing treaties, had already been refuted by ^preceding Ottoman arguments, and this being so and failing the acceptance by the iPersian delegates of the limits of Suleimanieh as given in Proces-verbal No. 14, it would, the Ottoman delegates considered, be preferable to refer the question at issue to the tribunal of the Hague. Proces-verbal No. 17, to which reference has already been made, contains the unconditional acceptance by the Persian delegates of the explanatory note. At the sitting of the lJ 2 nd August {Proces-verbal No. 18) the proposal of the Persian delegates to reply in writing to the statements made by the Ottoman delegates at the previous sitting was deprecated by the President, Adil Bey, speaking on behalf ol his Turkish colleagues. Such reply, he maintained, could serve no useful purpose, and would merely provoke a repetition of discussions destined to remain sterile as had been the case up to the present with all other discussions of the com mission. Notwithstanding the conciliatory spirit which, it was asserted by Adil Bey, had been shown by the Ottoman delegates, none of the questions had received a solution and none of the rights of Turkey had been recognised, although no conclusive argument or documentary proof against their legitimate claims had been produced. The proposal, however, with which his Excellency concluded this statement as to the hopelessness of a settlement being arrived at by further discussion, viz., that the commission should, in the interests of the two countries, have recourse to the means provided for such eventuality by their two Governments and refer the points in dispute without further delay to the tribunal of The Hague, was negatived by the Persian delegates, who pointed out that before this could be done the expiration of the period of six months fixed by the protocol of the 21 st December, 1911, for the deliberations of the commission must be awaited. The remaining proceedings of the commission during the current year were embodied in Proces-verbaux Nos. 19 and 20 of the sittings of the 29th August and 5th September respectively. These yroces-verbaux, owing to the subsequent absence from Constantinople of Generals Daniel Pasha and Ali Madir Pasha, were not signed by the latter, and authentic copies were consequently not procurable. Their contents, however, according to information supplied by the Persian delegates, would appear to be as follows :— Proces-verbal No. 19 contained the acknowledgment of the Turkish delegates of the acceptance by their Persian colleagues of the explanatory note. Proces-verbal No. 20 contained a criticism by the Persian delegates of the failure of their Turkish colleagues to give a reply to the Persian statements contained in Proces-verbal No. 15 other than “the passages in these statements are not compatible with existing treaties.” In this connection the following questions were addressed by the Persian delegates to their Ottoman colleagues :— ( 1 .) Whether the last treaty of Erzeroum was not still in force. ( 2 .) Whether this last treaty of Erzeroum had been succeeded by another modifying or annulling the text of the former. (3.) Whether the proces-verbaux of the commission of Erzeroum, which formed the basis of the conclusion of that treaty, were not official acts, and lastly whether a document of greater authenticity existed than the text of the treaty produced by them —the Persian delegates—in translation by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Finally, if other authentic documents were required by their Turkish colleagues they, the Persian delegates, were ready to produce to the commission a note addressed by the British Legation in the year 1849 to the Persian Grand ATzier in which it was stated, with reference to the question of the acceptance of the explanatory note, that restitution of territory concerned Mohamrnerah and Zohab only.CONFIDENTIAL.

The Grand Vizier called on the Russian Ambassador yesterday and promised to send a written reply to the Russian note of 22nd August next Monday. The Ambassador understands that reply will be general acceptance of the above- mentioned note, but on condition of cessions in Zohab. The Grand Vizier indicated the desired concession on the map. The line as proposed by him follows the red line as shown on [?] Soane’s map of 1 oth January from Shemira as far as Tangi-Haman, thence runs on south side of [?] Quretu River, and short distance from it in a westerly direction to a point near Markaz, then following line of Turkish guard-houses, but a little east of them, crosses the River Alwand near Kani Biz general direction of which it follows, but at varying distances from its left bank north-east to Sar Pul and thence to Rijab. Hence along the crest of Kuh-i-noa, Aarak, and Zelezerd mountain to Zorbatieh, 45 miles south of Mandali. Grand Vizier pretended that this line is in accordance with principle that Sunni tribes pass to Turkey, which is obviously incorrect, as it would place all winter quarters of Sinjabi tribe in Turkey and also encroaches on Pusht-i-Kuh. His Excellency was, however, conciliatory _ and when it was pointed out to him that under his proposal part of Kasnshirm to Kermanshah road would lie in Turkish territory, he at once agreed to modify the line His Excellency also desired some minor modifications of the line north of latitude 36, but seemed prepared for a compromise. „ ^ x ,, . • ^ * +for , Russian Ambassador intends to make a great effort to obtain promised written reply.

The Russian Ambassador insisted on immediate reply, and said that military com mission (to which he referred) was unnecessary.

I return herewith the three enclosures above mentioned with the maps marked as indicated. Coincidence of detail between my small map and that of Colonel Shell is not very apparent owing mainly to—• Replacement of old names by new ; Indefinite limits of the scope of mountain names ; Some inaccuracies in Colonel Shell’s sketch-map in names and situations; The indefinite nature of my sketch-map as relating to Zohab plain and Daladu Mountains. The name of Bamu Mountain in my sketch-map should be deleted ; it is too far south-west, thounh on correct bearing from Chia Surkh. [2836 A—1] r~ j or lsEG:.b .

My small sketch-map includes a small portion only of Colonel Shed’s map; I have therefore marked on the copies of that map the limits of my own. You will by now have before you my large map, which should be seen side by side with the commissioners’ survey, as I have purposely included as many common features as possible. Unfortunately Colonel Shed’s map disagrees considerably from the survey map, which is very exact, and I am afraid that it will be difficult to place the green, red, and blue lines upon it or my large map. 1 have marked upon the copies of my small map of Chia Surkh and Kasr-i-Shirin the lines corresponding to those upon Colonel Shed’s map. I did not quite gather from your letter whether you desired each of my maps to bear one or all three lines. I have therefore marked one copy ( 1 ) the Mediating Commissioners’ line, one copy ( 2 ) the Turkish delegate’s line, one copy ( 3 ) the Persian delegate’s line, in so far as the map includes them.

T HAD a further interview with Hakki Pasha to-day about the Turco-Persian frontier; and I annex a rough sketch map for facility of reference. He asked me if I could recommend some formida which he could place before the Grand Vizier as offering a solution which would be acceptable to His Majesty’s Government. I said that I could not do this, as the question concerned Russia even to a greater extent than Great Britain; both countries had given, in 1912, very clear serait inter (Lite” and that the formula should be regarded as emanating from him and not from me. He consented to this, and we drew up the following:— “1. Admettre que la frontiere, dans toute son etendue depuis le Mont Ararat jusqu’au Golfe Per si que, se trouve dans les limites de la zone indiquee sur la carte ‘ identique.’ “ 2. Pour la partie septentrionale de la frontiere, depuis le Mont Ararat jusqu’a la hauteur du 36 e degre de latitude, accepter la ligne indiquee dans la note russe de 1912. “ 3. A partir du 32 e degre de latitude jusqu’au Golfe Persique, accepter la ligne indiquee dans la note anglaise du 18 juillet, 1912. “ 4. Pour les regions comprises entre les 32 e et 36 e degres de latitude, accepter le statu quo actuel.” Hakki Pasha said that, in order to make the formula acceptable to Turkey, some compensation would have to be suggested between 32 and 36 (see point 4). I said 1 did not know what compensations to suggest. He said surely when lurkey was abandoning so much of what she claimed, not only outside, but even within the contested zone, it was only fair that she should receive some compensation in the part of the frontier in the middle ; and he said that Zohab province, which was allotted to Turkey in part by the Treaty of Erzeroum, but had in effect remained ever since almost wholly in possession of Persia, would be a very suitable place for concessions. I said that Zohab province and the application of the terms of the Ireaty to it had always been a question of dispute and difficulty ; and that I knew Persia was very sensitive about it, and in particular the towns of Zohab and Kasr-i-Shirin. In the end he suggested an addition to point 4 as follows :— “ tout en offrant a la Turquie comme compensation dans ffis regions an nord et au sud de Zohab les districts occupes par les tribus Sunnites, ainsi que, du cote de Mendalli, quelques endroits a determiner ulterieurement. Les villes de Zohab et de Kasr-i-Chirin resteraient en possession de la Perse.” He said that he would like to consult Tewfik Pasha, whose memory was prodigious, before adopting this formula and placing it before the Grand Vizier. He would, however, if possible let me know to-morrow the final version, and then he would telegraph it to the Grand Vizier recommending him to put it forward at Constantinople. But he specially asked that the formula should not be regarded as accepted by him until he wrote to-morrow. I think we had better take no further action till to-morrow. indications of the settlement they desired, and they were now waiting Turkey’s reply. He then said that he would like to telegraph to the Grand Vizier to say that he had had certain informal discussions on the subject here, and that he saw clearly that the only satisfactory solution was the adoption of a definite line. In order to arrive at such a line he would like to place before the Grand Vizier certain recommendations for his guidance, and he asked me to co-operate with him in drafting a formula. I agreed to do this on the express understanding that “ la recherche de la paternite A. P. Foreign Office, March 7, 1913.

I HAVE received your Excellency’s despatch No. 158 of the 25th ultimo, in which you transmit a further report, with a map, prepared by His Majesty’s vice-consul at Kasr-i-Shirin on the subject of the frontier in the province of Zohab. It seems to me that, if the Turkish Government are to be induced to accept the recommendations made in the British and Russian notes of 1912 in regard to the southern and northern portions of the frontier respectively, some slight cessions of territory to Turkey on some portions of the frontier will very probably be necessary in order that the settlement should appear in the light of a compromise and not of a Turkish surrender. It can hardly be contested that Persia would be well advised to make some relatively minor cessions if by doing so she could secure the great advantage of a settled frontier ; and if His Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government were to recommend her to agree to any particular line there is reason to suppose that she would acquiesce. . . I am not, however, desirous of putting forward any particular recommendation to the Persian Government for the moment; but I think it is very desirable that Excellency should discuss fully, and at an early date, with your Russian colleague the several proposals elaborated by Mr. Soane and the Russian consul-general at Bagdad in order that His Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government may reach an early decision as to the settlement which they can urge, when the proper time arrives, with the greatest prospect of success. _ I have some difficulty in following Mr. Soane’s various propositions in relation to his first map, in so far as concerns the report enclosed in your Excellency’s despatch No. 1060 of the 12th December; but I am disposed to think that the blue line, as shown on Mr. Soane’s map, dated the 13th January, 1913, might be recommended as far as Darband-i-Ur, and that from that place to Saumur the red line might be recommended, provided a saving clause were inserted in the deed of transfer or agree ment to protect the interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Chia Surkh. 1 further think that the districts of Shemiran and Saumur, which are shaded m the map, might be recognised as Turkish. .

I HAD an interview with Hakki Pasha to-day, when we discussed informally, hut in considerable detail, the Turco-Persian frontier question. I emphasised the great importance which Sir E. Grey attached to a final settlement, and laid stiess on the fact that no great sacrifice was asked for from Turkey, for all we desiied was a return to the status quo of 1848, which, with few minor changes, had remained the status quo up to 1905, when the recent Turkish encroachments began. I said that I had recently ascertained that the frontier status quo of 1848 was substantially the line favoured as a just settlement by Sir Arnold Kemball in 1878,— and that Sir A. Eemball had always been looked upon, even by the Turks themselves, as a Commissioner whose sympathies inclined rather to Turkey than to Persia. Hakki Pasha admitted this, and said he would like to follow the Kemball line on the “ identic ” map: this we did; and we then compared it with a map showing the status quo of 1848 (the year in which the Treaty of Erzeroum was ratified) and, so far as was possible, with the line indicated in the Russian note of last August. The three lines appear to correspond except in two localities to a minor degree, and we only discussed them as far south as Bane (north of Zohab province and the 36th parallel of latitude). Hakki Pasha said that he recognised that the question must now be settled; that a settlement was in the best interests of Turkey herself ; and that he thought the Russian and English desire for a settlement was reasonable. He wished to do three things :— 1. To satisfy Russia in regard to the north, satisfy us from the Persian Gulf to the 32nd parallel of latitude (rather north of Hawizeh), 3. To save Turkey s face, and the present Government from adverse criticism in lurkey. lo do this it would be necessary to treat the frontier as a whole, and if lurkey accepted the British and Russian notes of .1912 (relating to the southern and northern portions of^ the frontier respectively) then she should receive some compensation in the middle. He said he wished the settlement to appear in the light of a compromise, and not of a Turkish surrender all along the line.' I asked him what his idea of Turkish compensation in the middle would be ; and he said that, accepting, for the sake of argument, the contention advanced in the Russian note of 1912 that the Treaty of Erzeroum settled the whole question excepting Zohab and Mohammerah, and accepting the British proposals of July 1912 respecting Mohammerah, also for the sake of argument, it was well known that agreement had never been reached as to^how the Treaty was to be interpreted with regard to Zohab. i s to this province, Persia, he said, had taken advantage of Turkey’s embarrassments during the Greek \v ar of Independence in order to annex it, and as the Treaty of rzeroum had never been carried into^ effect in regard to Zohab, Persia had as a matter of fact remained m possession ever since. This was a very unfair state of affairs especially as a large portion of the population in the northern part of the province was unm. His idea was that if Turkey accepted the Russian note substantially in regard to the north, and our proposals in regard to Mohammerah, then Turkey ought to be given some compensation both at Bane and in regard to the northern part of the province of Zohab. He said both places were within the “neutral” zone on the identic map. I then asked if he wished to put forward this project of a compromise definitely, m order that it might be considered fully. He said he would prefer not to do this for the moment, but that he would give a definite answer on Friday. He said that he would like to place before his Government a line as a recom mendation made by 8ir E. Grey ; that if this were done there was considerable chance [2836 d—1] CO • ■; isiv^r 1 t SECRE!A t n ,yv 4of its being accepted by the Porte, wbo could say they had done this under the advice of His Majesty’s Government who were fully informed as to all the merits of the -c x ^ or us to recom ^nend a definite line it would probably be necessarv m . we s ^ ou ^ consult Russia, and he said that he would prefer that not ^^ at nnt ^ Friday, when the next interview takes place.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 43 of the 10th instant, on the subject of the Turco-Persian frontier, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch from the acting British consul-general at Bagdad, enclosing a report and sketch map prepared by Mr. Soane, which completes the map and details previously furnished by him (see enclosure in my despatch No. 1060 of the 12th December last) respecting the lines of possible cession of territory to Turkey in the Zohab district, agreed upon between himself and M. Orlof. Mr. Soane’s observations on proposition 2 of his former report would seem to make it evident that the line marked in red in his second map as the boundary of the Senjabi tribe’s winter quarters from the Elwend to Mendalli is also the line of frontier as at present locally observed. This line, it will be remembered, forms part of the line considered most advisable by Messrs. Soane and Orlof. IN continuation of my despatch dated the 13th January, 1913, I now have the honour to enclose a sketch map prepared by T ice-Consul li.. B. Soane in accordance with the instructions contained in your Excellency’s telegram No. 65 to my address. I have kept one rough tracing of this map as an office copy. Perhaps if it is intended to have this map printed in London some spare copies might be sent to me later on. I enclose at the same time three copies of a note prepared by Vice-Consul E. B. Soane to accompany his sketch map. I have shown the map and the note to M.

The physical features of the line are not very well defined, but the consideration of leaving Chia Surkh in Persian territory, which demands a compensating cession on the Khanashur side, renders it difficult to choose a well-defined line. The reel line is that called No. 2 by me previously, and was the one considered most advisable by M. Orlof and myself. Its physical features are sufficiently defined on the map, and I beg to refer you to former notes for the reason of its selection. If the line seems to give too little to the Turks, a combination of Nos. 1 and 2 would be very satisfactory, i.e., No. 1 from the north to Darband-i-Ur and thence No. 2, as Turkey would _ thereby gain, undivided, the Sharafbaini and Babajani tribes, which are both Sunni.

J honour to report to you that shortly after the prolongation of three months to begin from the 25th October last, of the period fixed for the deliberations of the Iurco-1 ersian h rentier Commission, as reported in my despatch No. 899 of the 22nd of the same month tvyo of the Turkish delegates, viz.,Daniel Pasha and Ali Riza Pasha were unable to give their further attendance at the sittings of the commission, their services being lequiied m the war which in the interval had broken out between Turkev and the Balkan States. The appointment, therefore, of two new Turkish members became necessary and advantage was taken by the Persian Ambassador of the opportunity thus afforded to represent to his Excellency Gabriel Effendi in a friendly manner the advisability, if a satisfactory arrangement were to be arrived at, of appointing as president someone of less uncompromising attitude than Adil Bey had shown himself to be. These representations received the support both of myself and my Russian colleague and eventually, and after much negotiation and delay, the following members who, I understand, are satisfactory to my Persian colleague, were chosen to represent the Turkish Government, viz., Sadr-ed-Din Bey, formerly charge d’affaires at Tehran - Said Bey, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affaire, and Zia Pasha brigadier general. &amp; The commission as reconstituted held its first meeting on the 12th instant. The business transacted was, however, merely formal, the Turkish delegates requesting that, m view of their very recent appointment (some three days previously in fact), the commission might be adjourned for a week to allow them to obtain a better knowledge of the questions involved. This was agreed to and the next meeting of the commission fixed for the 19th instant. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. [2763 u —5]CONFIDENTIAL, / i ^ 4 . &amp; '*aar Sir G.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 9, 1913.) (No. 273.) U ’ ' ^ _ Tehran, December 29, 1912. I HAVE the honour to forward to you herewith copy of a despatch which I have received from His Majesty s consul at Kermanshah, reporting upon the condition of the road between the Turkish frontier and Kermanshah, and between the latter place and Hamadan. On the receipt of Mr. Consul McDouall s despatch 1. spoke to my Russian colleague on the subject of the disgraceful state of affairs prevailing on the roads in question, as, if the figures given by Mr. McDouall are correct, the exactions reported appear to be worse than on the Bushire-Shiraz road. I then learnt that an arrangement had just been concluded between the Russian and Persian Governments under which the sum of 30,000 tomans (about 6,000L) a-month will be guaranteed by the Russian Bank for an indefinite period to the Governor-General of Kermanshah, for the maintenance of a military force and the expenses of the provincial administration. The money will be refunded from the next advance or from the receipts of the northern customs when the existing advances have been paid off. It is hoped that, with the assistance of this assured monthly allowance, the Governor-General may be in ^ a position to secure a restoration of that order on the roads in his province, which is of such vital importance to British trade. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Consul McDouall to Sir W. Townley. (No. 138.) Sir, Kermanshah, December 5, 1912. I HAVE the honour to report that at present the exactions on the roads from the frontier to Kermanshah, and from the latter place to Hamadan, are very heavy, and there is no safety on the roads. I have reason to believe that the transporters would gladly pay a smaller fee once and for all if no further exaction were made. During the last year it is estimated that the roadguards have collected between 150,000 tomans (30,000L) and 200,000 tomans (40,0001.) between the frontier and Kermanshah alone. One British subject, owning ninety-one camels on each trip, paid 18 krans (7s.) in all on each camel divided between twenty different posts. Rahdari on goods is abolished, but it seem impossible to prevent the collection of fees called karasurani or “ salamat-rao ” from the muleteers, and this may not be covered by the abolition of rahdari. A proportion of the transporters are Turkish subjects ; one man is a British subject and the rest are Persians. During the year Tanguz-il, according to the published customs statistics, 4,220,766 batmans of merchandise arrived at Kermanshah. The majority of the animals are mules, taking from 40 to 60 batmans, a number of camels taking up to 70 batmans, and some donkeys taking from 20 to 30. If we take an average of 40 batmans to the load we should have in round numbers 100,000 animals. On the return journey many of the animals are unloaded. Supposing 3|- krans per animal were collected on the journey to, and 1|- krans on the journey from Kermanshah, a total of 50,000 tomans (10,000b) might be collected. From Hamadan to Kermanshah the same amounts might be coilected on, say, 70,000 animals, making a total of 85,000 tomans (17,000b) altogether, and there would be a further sum from passengers (mounted only) and internal traffic ; this is a main pilgrim route. Details as to varying charge for camels, mules, and donkeys would have to be worked out, but the estimate of 40 batmans per animal allows for this. It has been estimated that a sum of 80,000 tomans (16,000b) should be sufficient to pay for a proper system of guards from the frontier to Hamadan. [2763 i—5] The service ; BE I i \ i \ i _0.: i* 1 * — ~2 would have to he arranged under a European, say, a Swedish gendarmerie officer, who would raise local guards, but who should have a small nucleus of men from elsewffiere Receipts and expenditure would naturally be under the control of the director of customs and revenue. The fees would have to be collected at a fixed place, say, at the bridge of Zohab for the frontier, and at the Karasu bridge for the Hamadan road. A printed receipt would be given for each payment, and no other fees, except the grazing fees, would be permitted. It is doubtful if this could be arranged until the authority of the governor has been imposed on the tribes who are at present in an almost independent position. The continued difficulty on the roads is very serious. The goods are chiefly British, and a large proportion are British owned. Most of the merchants are British subjects, so that the state of the roads only really interests ourselves and the Turkish Government.^ This is in the Russian sphere, but the Russians have no commercial interests in Kermanshah, and, in fact, the interruption of these routes is a positive advantage to them as allowing their goods to compete with ours in Hamadan. Unless some system be instituted by the Persians to safeguard traffic the only alternative would be for the Turks to undertake it, which is the solution advocated by my Turkish colleague.

Foreign Office, January 27, 1913, 10'30 p.m. RUSSIAN Ambassador informs me that Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed German Government, through Russian Ambassador at Berlin, that resumption of hostilities between Turkey and allies may produce serious complications, as Russian opinion will be much moved if the war produces a risky situation. German Ambassador has lately expressed apprehension that Russia intends some move into Asia Minor, and has emphasised importance that Germany attaches to integrity of Asia Minor, and it is probable that Russian communication at Berlin may increase German apprehension. I have already told German Ambassador that I had no reason to suppose that Russian Government had any designs on integrity of Asia Minor, but that Russian Ambassador here had impressed upon me that a settlement of Turco-Persian frontier was the thing necessary to remove difficulty between Russia and Turkey. I suggested that German Government might use their influence at Constantinople to this effect. You should inform Minister for Foreign Affairs, in case he thinks it opportune to clear up any misapprehension at Berlin. 1151-5571Sir G.

His Excellency replied that he was prepared to do his best to that end, and j admitted that Turkish Government had been in fault since 1905. He said, however, { that it would be very difficult to abandon so much territory without some semblance of concessions from other side, adding that they were now being asked to give up the whole so-called “ contested zone.” In reply 1 pointed out that this was not the case, only territory to be ceded being that laid down by treaty of 1847. I said that I feared that no progress would be made as long as Adil Bey remained president of the joint commission. His Excellency promised to study matter and proposed within a week or so to attend commission himself and see what could be done. To a further observation of mine respecting the inconvenience and delay of a reference to The Hague tribunal his Excellency repeated that this difficulty could be overcome by careful drafting. A reply similar to above was given by Minister for Foreign Affairs to my Russian colleague, but it will obviously be difficult under present critical condition of affairs i for Minister to give his personal attention to the matter.

I make this suggestion in consequence of the fact that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company own oil wells in the neighbourhood of Qasr-i-Shirin, but it is possible that Russian subjects may hold concessions on the more northerly parts of the frontier, and that the Russian Government may think it prudent to safeguard their interests. ; r u Would the Russian Government be prepared to embody a reservation to this effect in their proposed note to the Turkish Government?

His Excellency expressed hope that Cabinet would agree to this. If commission could not come to decision, question would be submitted to Hague Tribunal, and if decision was in favour of Turkey she would naturally reoccupy the places in question. His Excellency trusted, however, that if Turks evacuate these places now Russians would not seize opportunity to occupy them. He intended in the meantime to reply in a day or two to Persian note, agreeing to a prolongation of sitting of commission for a month or two. * His Excellency added that he conceived that Russia could not occupy territory m question without a breach of the Anglo-Russian agreement regarding Persia. 1035—550]r ' [This Document is the Proper ty of His Britannic Majesty s Government.] *P i. .

His Excellency said that he was sure that the report that had reached me must have come from Persian sources, and he did not believe there could be any truth in it, as the most stringent orders had been sent to the local authorities on the frontier that no movement of troops should take place, and, as a matter of fact, the Turkish forces in that district had of late been somewhat reduced.

The latter moreover could under the Treaty of Erzeroum decline to admit it. Sir P. Cox had better therefore simply say that steps will be taken by His Majesty’s Government to ensure free navigation on the Shatt-al-Arab, and the other interests of the Shaikh in so far as they are compatible wiih the Treaty and with the explanatory notes, and he should indicate to the Shaikh the line of frontier as proposed by us.

I informed Sir Khazal Khan that a definite stage had now been reached in respect of the Frontier question, and that His Majesty’s Government desired that I should explain to him fully,’in confi dence, what we were doing in the matter and what the position was.’ I added that in order to give him a connected explanation of the course of the negotia tions I had written a pencil summary of the matter as I understood it from the beginning, and would ask him to listen while Major Haworth and I explained the contents of it to him. (Copy attached.) 3. As regards the portion of the boundary between the Duwairij and the Khaiyin-Nazaileh-Shatt-al-Arab junction, he had nothing to say except to express his acquiescence and appreciation of the attitude and endeavours of His Majesty’s Government in his interests. As regards the proposed river Frontier, which was explained to him by rough diagram, he expressed apprehension of possible interference by the Turks with vessels along the shore of Abadan Island between the Mohammerah anchorage in the Shatt-al-Arab, and the sea. I informed him that I had no personal doubt that this was considered already guarded against by existing provisions (and reminded him that the Oil Company’s Concession was included in the strip in question) but that in any case I would put his representation specifically before Government, and would also support his suggestion as to the test of connection between an island and the Persian shore. In the latter regard, reverting to the claim reported in my telegram of July 10th to the India Office, he would have been glad if it could have been provided that in future any new island arising on the Persian side of the recognised steamer course should accrue to Persia, but I explained to him that such a stipulation would involve a claim to the middle channel line, which as before explained, thought it might not prove possible to make good. No'mention was made of the proposed Riverain Commission. 4 . It was arranged that as a final reply to the enquiry of the Persian Consul at Basrah, he should write that he learnt that full information was with the Persian Government and the delegates in Constantinople, so that it would appear that details could no longer be required from him; or words to that effect. Nothing further passed on this subject and the conversation turned to other topics. Report of communication made verbally to the Shaikh of Mohammerah and Haji Rais, by His Majesty's Consul-General, Bushire and His Majesty's Consul, Mohammerah, August 20th, iqi2. Your Excellency is probably aware that last year, with a view to putting an end to the recurrence of boundary disputes continually arising in the vicinity of' 2 the Turko-Frontler, the Persian and Turkish Governments agreed, in a Convention dated 21st December 1911, to assemble a joint Commission at Constantinople, composed of delegates from both sides, for the purpose of negotiating an amicable settlement of disputed points and arriving at an agreement on the whole ^ frontier question. It was stipulated that the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847) should be the basis of these negotiations and that any particular points upon which the delegates should be unable to arrive at an agreement within a period of 6 months from the time of the assembly of the Commission, should be referred for decision to the International Court of Arbitration at the Hague. You are also, no doubt, aware, that the wording of the Treaty of Erzeroum, read in conjunction with the explanatory notes attached thereto, purports to give the whole of the waters of the Shatt-al-Arab to Turkey, only allowing Persia the town of Mohammerah and its anchorage on the Karun ; and further that when the Turko-Persian Boundary Commissioners met in the Shatt-al-Arab in 1850 to endeavour to fix the Frontier and the representatives of the two countries made unreasonable cross claims, of the nature of which you are gene rally aware, the two English and Russian Mediating Commissioners expressed the view that an equitable boundary might be considered to run from the mouth of the Abu Jidiyeh Canal direct through Kishk-i-Basri to Hawizeh. By the adoption of this line the strip of riparian ground between Abu Jidiyeh Canal and Diaiji would fall to Turkey. If therefore the question of the Arabistan boundary should be carried to the Hague Court, it is considered by legal experts very doubtful whether Persia would be awarded nearly as good a frontier as that which now seems to be locally observed, and it consequently seems of the highest importance to Persia and more particularly to Your Excellency, that all reference to the Hague should be avoided by the conclusion of an amicable compromise in regard to this part of the Frontier. The above considerations have prompted His Majesty’s Government to do their utmost, in the interests of yourself and of the Persian Government to get Turkey to agree, without going to the Hague, to a settlement which as far as possible confirms the frontier as locally observed, and which, as explained above, will be much more favourable to yourself and to Persia than the line recom mended by the Mediating Commissioners in 1850. The boundary line which we have put forward runs as follows Coming from that branch of the Duwairij called the Khorel-Muhaisin, it passes southwards across the Khor-el-Azem until it reaches the main channel of the marsh just west of the village of Shuaib. Thence it continues in a southerly direction down the same channel through the marsh until it arrives due west of Kishk-i-Basri. From that point it breaks back and passes in a straight line to Kishk-i-Basri itself and from thence again it turns and proceeds due south until it reaches the vicinity of Diaiji near the Shatt-al-Arab. Here it becomes the boundary at present locally observed, and entering the Khaiyin Canal, (the channel running from the Customs post at Diaiji between the islands of Kharnu- biyah, Bowarin, Aqawat and the mainland, as far as the junction of Nahr Nazaileh with the Shatt-al-Arab and Nahr Abul Arabid), it follows the middle line of the Khor Khaiyin until it reaches the point where the Nahr Khaiyin and the Nahr Nazaileh meet the main channel of the Shatt-al-Arab. As regards the boundary from thence to the sea we have represented that the boundary as locally observed seems to be the centre of the fairway steamer- channel, but as I have explained to you above, in all probability if this question is referred to the Hague, Persia would not be able, in view of the terms of the Treaty of Erzeroum, to make good a claim to the centre channel line ; they are, therefore, being advised, on condition of the Turkish Government accepting the frontier as above described from Duwairij to the junction of the Nazaileh Khaiyin and Shatt-al-Arab, to recognise Turkey’s right to the whole waterway, subject to certain conditions.The conditions proposed are as follows :— Firstly .—That the following islands shall be recognised as being within the territorial limits of Persia ; {a) Muhalleh and its adjunct Bahriyeh, the 4 islands situated between Shatait and Ma’awi and the two islands off Manyuhi. These islands are in fact parts of the island of Abadan and must be so regarded. (b) Any islands now in existence, or which may hereafter be formed and which may be connected at low water either with Abadan Island or with the Persian bank below the Nahr Nazaileh. Secondly .—That the Ottoman Government accept such proposals as His Majesty’s Government may put forward for maintaining full freedom of naviga tion on the river and for its conservancy. Thirdly .—That the modern port and anchorage of Mohammerah which is in the main stream of the Shatt-al-Arab above and below its junction with the Karun (extent explained to Shaikh) to be recognised as within Persian juris diction. Fourthly .—No interference to take place with existing fishing rights and usages on or from the Persian bank of the Shatt-al-Arab, that phrase being understood to comprise all land on the left bank of the Shatt-al-Arab or on the Persian islands therein which is covered at normal low tide. Fifthly .—Turkish jurisdiction not to extend to land on the Persian bank, defined as above, which is only temporarily covered with water in time of flood or from any accidental cause, and Persian jurisdiction not to extend to land which is temporarily or accidentally uncovered below normal low-water mark. Sixthly .—The Shaikh of Mohammerah to continue in full enjoyment of his existing proprietory rights in lands situated in Turkish territory. Your Excellency will understand that while we shall do our best to procure the frontier above described, and hope to do so, it is uncertain whether Turkey is legally bound, in view of the Treaty of Erzeroum, to recognise the modern port and anchorage of Mohammerah in the Shatt-al-Arab, and we may not succeed ; but in any case we shall provide against any arbitrary interference with the commercial interests of Mohammerah, and shall endeavour to safeguard your other interests in the river in so far as they are compatible with the Treaty of Erzeroum and the explanatory notes of the Mediating Commissioners.

WITH reference to yonr letter of the 10th August and my subsequent interview' with Mr. Parker, I have submitted the question involved to my colleagues, and am desired to request that in any redistribution of territory between Persia and Turkey the rights granted by the Persian Government to Mr. D’Arcy under the concession dated the 8th June, 1901, shall be fully safeguarded and recognised. My board venture to point out that the proposed redelimitation of territory affords an opportunity to His Majesty’s Government of pressiug forward Mr. D’Arcy’s claim to to the oil concessions for the provinces of Mosul and Bagdad, and they therefore beg to suggest that, as a condition of any such redelimitation, it should be stipulated (1; that the Turkish Government shall recognise our rights by granting to us a concession for the exploitation of oil and the laying of pipedines in the ceded territory on exactly the same terms and conditions as those contained in the Persian concession, and (2) that the Turkish Government grant to Mr. D’Arcy a concession for the exploitation of oil and the laying of pipe-lines in the provinces of Mosul and Bagdad on the same terms as in the Persian concession. As you are aware, a very large sum has been expended by us on drilling and other operations at Kasr-i-Shirin, where we are now again carrying on active work, and should the proposed cession of territory by Persia to Turkey deprive us of the benefit of our concession so far as it relates to the province of Zohab we shall naturally expect to be compensated, not only for our large expenditure up to date, but also for estimated damages covering the loss which we are likely to suffer in consequence of this deprivation. It is needless to point out that the oil-fields in Zohab will, when the Bagdad and other contemplated railways in Mesopotamia and Northern Persia are operating, be of considerable value, as oil will be the only cheap fuel available for these railways.

[38111 No. 1. Consul Shipley to Mr. Parker.—(Received September 10.) (Private.) Dear Parker, Constantinople, September 4, 1912. AS you will have seen by Proees-verbal No. 17, the Persian delegates accepted the explanatory notes in the form we suggested, i.e., unconditionally. I have since learned from Minorsky that they did not do so without some misgiving, and it rertainly shftws a certainly shows a certain amount of confidence in the representations and explanations I and Minorsky were authorised to give that they took such a step without first consulting their Government. The Persian Ambassador, in fact, received a telegram from Tehran almost immediately after he had handed in to Adil Bey a written declaration signed by himself accepting these notes, telling him not to take any steps in the matter until he had received further instructions. As this written declaration had not yet been embodied in the official proces-verbal of the commission (this was done some few days later, i.e., at the sitting of the 15th August), the Ambassador, Minorsky tells me, hinted at the possibility of withdrawing it, but eventually, on the latter’s representing that he would only stultify himself in the eyes of the Turks, who would none the less consider the point as virtually yielded, he decided to go on with the matter. The Russian note on the northern part of the frontier has of course been for some time past in your hands, and, as regards the interpretation of article 3 of the treaty of Erzeroum, the line taken by them is that which I indicated to you in my letter of the 20th May last. I have read carefully the memorandum on this particular question which you were good enough to send me through Parkes, but, except foi the passage in Sir S. Canning’s despatch to Colonel Williams of the 19th December, 1848, I hardly see that it contains anything very detrimental to the Russian view. Is not, indeed, the opinion given by Lord Palmerston in his despatch of the 26th February, 1850, viz., that “ territorial restitution has to be limited to the places above named, actual possession being therefore the basis of the operation of demarcating the frontiei, rather in favour of the Russian interpretation than otherwise ? My own view of the matter you are aware of, and I can only repeat what I stated in my lettei above alluded to, viz., that whatever interpretation may be given to the article in question, it is the Russian one which provides the most equitable settlement, and I think, as 1 have thought all along, that it would be to the best interests of the Turks that the latter should frankly recognise the situation and adopt this solution. ? . Proces-verbal No. 18, which we are sending you by to-day s bag, is, as you will see, practically a declaration of opinion by the Turks that it is useless to go on with the commission. They eventually yielded, it is true, to the objection raised by the Persians that the expiration of the six months’ delay provided by the two Governments must be awaited before the proceedings could be brought to a close, but the admission was made very ungraciously, as it seemed to me, and the tone generally adopted by them in the whole of the proces-verbal in question cannot be said to be conciliatory oi calculated to promote the arrangement, on the urgent necessity of which, m the interests of the twn States, they laid so much stress. -p . . n T ^ The question of possible compensation to be given by lersia will, I fear, be a very difficult one, and I hardly see myself, in view of the objections to Kileh bhahme and Dereh where this compensation is to come from, unless the mediating line m Zohab is accepted as such. We, that is, I and Minorsky, however, are preparing a memorandum on the matter, which we hope will be ready m the course of a day or two. Believe me, &amp;c. H. S. SHIPLEY.

Notwithstanding, his Excellency went on to say, the conciliatory spirit shown by 1 them, none of the questions hitherto dealt with had received a solution. Their rights based on treaties m force and on documents in conformity with these treaties, had not been recognised, although no conclusive argument or documentary proof against their ! legitimate claims had been produced. After a reference to the reasons which rendered it necessary to hasten with all speed to a solution of this frontier question, and after repeating his opinion as to the uselessness of further discussion in the commission itself, his Excellency concluded by an exhoitation to the Persian members of the commission to have recourse to the means provided for such eventuality by their two Governments and to refer the matters in dispute between them without further delay to the impartial judgment of The Hague Tribunal. - In reply, the Persian delegates pointed out that by the terms of the protocol of Tehran (21st December, 1911) a delay of six months had been fixed in which to negotiate, and that the expiration of this delay must be awaited before the proposal of the Ottoman delegates could be adopted. After a rejoinder by the latter consisting chiefly in a repetition of their statement that their only object in proposing to refer the matter to The Hague Tribunal was to hasten a solution of the question, it was admitted by them, apparently with some unwillingness, that, as their Persian colleagues insisted on awaiting the expiration of the delay in question, the Ottoman delegation saw itself obliged to yield to this objection. It may be pointed out that the Turkish delegates, in asserting that no agreement had been arrived at by the commission, found it convenient, for some reason which I am unable to understand, to ignore the acceptance by the Persian delegates of the explanatory notes at the preceding sitting {Proces-verbal No. 17), and it is equally noteworthy that the latter should, on their part, have allowed the assertion of their Ottoman colleagues to pass without rejoinder.

[37863] [September 9.] Section 2. . 1912 NeH-r Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 9.) (No. 749.) Sir, Constantinople, September 4, 1912. I CALLED on the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday, and asked his Excellency whether he had found time to examine the proposals regarding the Turco- Persian frontier in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah, which had been communicated to Tewfik Pasha so long ago as the 18th July last. Gabriel Effendi made no direct reply, but launched out into a somewhat bitter tirade against the action of the Russian Ambassador in endeavouring, just at a moment when the Cabinet was surrounded with difficulties of every kind, to force on them proposals the acceptance of which would necessarily expose them to the reproach of having yielded to menace, and so weaken their position before the country. I suggested to his Excellency that there was nothing in the Russian proposals that could be considered inacceptable, as they amounted merely to a return to the status quo which Turkey had bound herself to respect by the convention of 1869, and which she had been constantly violating on the flimsiest pretexts for the past five years, and I suggested that if his Excellency would instruct the Turkish delegates to accept the line suggested by Russia, M. de Giers’s demarche need never be known to the public at all. I thought that this was the wisest course to take, and urged his Excellency to give it his best consideration. I think that my remarks made some impression on the Minister, but it was quite clear that his Excellency had been very much irritated, not so much, it seemed to me, by the substance of the communication, as by something that M. de Giers had said to him at the time of urging it on him—a circumstance which somewhat surprised me, as the Ambassador had told me that he intended to use very friendly, if insistent, language in pressing his proposals. As regards our own proposals for the frontier in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah, Gabriel Effendi expressed himself as anxious to meet our wishes, and in thanking him I again urged on him the advisability of showing a similar conciliatory disposition towards Russia. On my return to Therapia I received a visit from M. de Giers, to whom I related my conversation with Gabriel Effendi. The Ambassador said that Gabriel Effendi s annoyance was probably caused by the very strong language he had felt bound to use in protesting against the recent dispatch of seventy Turkish soldiers to Urmia, which he had described to the Minister for Foreign Affairs as a deliberate act of provocation and calculated to lead to regrettable incidents with the Russian force in the town. M. de Giers admitted, however, that he was encountering more difficulty than he had expected in inducing the Turks to accept the Russian line in the north, and he foresaw that some tangible inducement would have to be held out to them. He was therefore anxious that we should examine what territorial arrangement m favour of Turkey could be proposed, and draw up suggestions for submission to our Governments with_as little delay as possible, so that he might be m a position to urge on the lurkish Government that, in agreeing to accept the Russian line, they would be obtaining a territorial quid pro quo which would be of use to silence the cuticism of then political enemies. I hinted to his Excellency that, although from a legal point of view the case for the Russian Jine might be as strong as, or even stronger than, our case for the Mohammerah—Howizah line, he would have the harder task m reaching an agreement with the Turks, as the recognition of the frontier desired by Russia involved the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the occupied districts. lo this M. de Giers assented readily enough, and added that he was about to ask his Government to permit him to hold forth to the Turks as an additional inducement the consent of Russia to the application of the new Temettu Law and to the 4 p(|r” cent. .Tpcrehse o^hq customs duties - I have, Ac. 20 SEP 1912 \ ■ ; H ,-——[This Dacnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s ] ^ PERSIA.

I suggested to M. de Giers that the only way in which the consent of the Porte to our requirements could, in the first instance, be officially recorded, was in a proces-verbal of the Turco-Persian commission now sitting, but it would, I thought, be useless to advise the Persian delegates to put forward the line of frontier our Government had defined until we had obtained some kind of assurance from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkish acquiescence in our demands. M. de Giers assented, and pointed out that we should hardly succeed in doing so without the question of a cession of Persian territory to Turkey being raised. We might, however, be able to elicit a verbal declaration from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he was read} T to enter into our views, and we agreed to direct our endeavours to that end.

As a perusal of the former of the proces-verbaux above referred to will show, no attempt was made by the Turkish delegates to discuss the various points raised by the Persian delegates at the sitting of the 1st August (Proces-verbal No. 15). With reference to the question of Suleimanieh, the reply made by the former amounts in fact merely to a statement that they (the Turkish delegates) could not admit the conclusions arrived at by their Persian colleagues, as these conclusions were no answer to the preceding Turkish statement on the subject, which was based on treaties in force and on authentic documents which were in conformity with these treaties. Any statement, it was added by the Turkish delegates, which should not fulfil the above conditions could not be taken into consideration by them. Further, the Turkish delegates, after reminding their Persian colleagues that such passages in |the latters’ statement of the 1st August last (Proces-verbal No. 15) as were not compatible with existing treaties had already been refuted by preceding Ottoman arguments, conclude by requesting the Persian members of the commission to proceed to the delimitation of Suleimanieh as laid down in Proces-verbal No. 14, failing which they (the Ottoman delegates) were of opinion that the matter should be referred to The Plague Tribunal. Proces-verbal No. 17 contains the unconditional acceptance by the Persian delegates of the explanatory notes, and it will be observed that the form of this acceptance is identical with the text, copy of which was forwarded to you in my despatch No. 709 of the 21st instant.

Chapter XIX. THE Fcili tribe are a branch of the Lurgujek Kurds, whose capital has long been the town callad Khoremabad. Now, the Feili tribe, together with the other tribes bearing the name of Lurgujek, used to live in parts of thel ish kuh near the Pusht-i-Kuh. The father of Hassan Khan, who was the father of the three brothers Ali Khan, Ahmed Khan, and Haidar Khan, who now rule over the Fedi tribes mnabitmg the Pusht-i-Kuk fHussan Khan died about seventeen years ago, and for a period of forty years previously had ruled uninterruptedly over the Feih tribe) was ruler in the town of Khoremabad. Now, the Pusht-i-Kuh mountains were uninhabited at that time, so some of the Feili and L.ek tribes used to go to the Pusht-i-Kuh in winter time, simply to winter there, and in the spring they would return to their own p ace^ At one time the Persians harassed the father of the said Hassan Khan so be gia . y transferred the Feili tribes which were subject to him and sent them to “® f us q;T^“ h ’ arid as soldiers were then sent against him by the Persians he himself went • , tribes that remained with him and joined the tribes which were object to Bagdad, and for two or three years they remained under Bagdad.

In the days when the Great Suleiman Pasha was Vali of Bagdad * one of Ins ancestors Ismail Khan had come to the vilayet of Bagdad w,th a few tribes and settled in a place called Muhavil, a dependency of Bagdad. An allowance had been made to him, and the administration of the affairs of the Mufaja tribe a branch of the Muntefik tribes, had been handed over to him. In Little Suleiman Pashas t.mej Mehmed Khan, son of Ismail Khan, went with the Kurds his father had brought with him and took up his residence in Khurnabad, a dependency of Bagdad His own father, Hassan Khan, had come in Abdullah Pasha’s time with the tribes that followed him and lived in Amara, a dependency of Bagdad, for twelve years During this period he was subiect to the Muntefik sheikhs for two years, and for those years he was with the Rabia tribes. After that he built a castle in Amara, where he tarried and lived for seven years during which period all his belongings were transferred to Bedra, Jessan, and Mendeli. He therefore begged that, as he still had many vineyards and gardens in Bedra and Zorbatieh, and about a hundred houses and pieces of land m Bagdad itself he might become an Ottoman subject as before. As a fact, it has been learned and ascertained from others, too, that the tribes in question came to this side several times in that way and obtained vineyards, gardens, and lands in the places referred to, and in fact still possess them. It is legitimate to look upon these from the tribes’ point of view as debatable land ; hut there is no doubt that in return for this the Persians would also dispute those branches of the Beni Lam tribe which are mentioned in Chapter XVII, as having gone over into Persian territory. It would therefore seem better to give up the idea of claiming the Feili tribes, and to claim as Ottoman territory only the Pusht-i-Kuh lands in which they dwell now. If the Persians, in reply to this claim, say that the localities in which their tribes live belong to them, this will lay them open to the defence that in that case Fellahieh, Kamiz, Behbehan, Shava, Dizful, and other places must belong to Turkey, since the Beni Lam tribes who inhabit them to-day have been Ottoman subjects ab antique, and only recently passed over into Persian territory. This provides a pretext for demanding that the Pusht-i-Kuh be saved from the Persians. Chapter XX. No one can say accurately what is really the old frontier decided upon by the State at the time when investigations were carried out in Bedra, Zorbatieh, and Mendeli. It is said that the present frontier lies on the extreme skirts of the Pusht-i-Kuh mountains, which extend to the plains; and below is a translation ot a summary of two reports m Arabic from the council of Bedra and Beni Lam tribe respectively, dealing with this view and with other matters. Translation of a Summary of the Bedra Repoi’t. Between the head of the Kunjiajem stream, which comes from the Milleh Bazan mountains in the north-east of Bedra—that is to say, between the place where the Kunjiajem escapes from the hilly country, and the locality known as Makhlat— the right side of the boundary of Bedra belongs to Bedra, and the left side to the Feili tn c, who are subject to Persia. There is a stream called Gavi, which comes from the Aarva mountains, to the east of Bedra, and joins the Kunjiajem at Makhlat. Now, from f e point where this stream escapes from the mountains, right up to Makhlat, both si os * Xote by Dervish Pallia .—The Great Suleiman Pasha was vali of Bagdad from 1193 to 1207 a.h i.e., 1779-1793. f Note by Dervish Pasha .—Little Suleiman Pasha was Yali of Bagdad from 1223 to 1225 a. e., 1809-1811, and Abdullah Pasha from 1225 to 1227 a.h., i.e.. 18l 1-1813.4 Kuniiaiem and the lands between the Kavy streams being, as shown above, in the nossession of the Beni Lam, the Beni Lam report with regard to the present condition of the said places is the more accurate. Chapter XXII. W As shown above in Chapter XVIII, the old frontier begins at the extremity of the KebifKuh in the neighbourhood of the Milleh Panjoin Pass. According to one rumour it crosses to Milleh Panjom, or Milleh Panjav Pass goes to Mount Sifl.k and thence, t crosses Dihbala plain, it passes along the heights of the mountains X7k 1 Shalem, and Meehan intil it reaches Mount Manshet. Thence, kavintr also on ihis side the locality cal ed Asuman Abad and on the other side Chardaoul it goes to a pass called Tenki Khurrema and on to Mount Kalanjuman. From there it passes by the heights of the great mountains called Kalacheh and over Ilahi Emrouleh, and runs as a dividing line in the neighbourhood of Kamkeh Khan, which lies in a plain in these parts. Then it eaves the plain of Kevavur on the Persian side and the Kivrafur plain on the Turkish side, and goes to the mountains of Ke’-Emir and Bimar; from which point it runs, by way of the head of the valley of Derbend Sakan, to the summit of a spur of the Nua Mountains, which is situated in the Karieh of Seyyid-i-Kamr, and reaches the highest peak of the said Nua Mountains It finally ends at Ser Mil, which is the end of the old boundary of the Son-ik of Zohab Another rumour says that the old frontier runs from the extremity of the Kebir Kuh, crosses the Milleh Panjom Pass, Mount Siflik, Milleh Kavan, Kala Rak, Shalem, and Kechan, and reaches Mount^ Manshet _ Then it goes from a pass called Zanjareh, which lies to the south-west of the lenki Khurrema to Mount Kdaniuman • then to the Derehiakan and the Salanja Mountains ; to the valley called r&gt;irak J Malaka • to Mount Kuh-i-Kav ; to the Tenk-i-Terazik Pass; to Mount Kala Dnzul • to the Tenk-i-Zhoumand Pass ; and to Mount Seh Gizan. Thence, crossing the Dereh Pav Pass, it runs again to the Kel Emir and Birmar Mountains, from which point it crosses the highest peak of the Nua Mountains, and the head of the above- mentioned Derbend Sakan Pass, situated in the neighbourhood of the village of Seyyid Kamr, and comes to an end at Ser Mil. _ In this case the Kevavur Plain also remains on the Turkish side. i\o entry or document has been found stating that in that region the old fiontiei passes through these localities; but that it does so is deduced from the consideration that Ser Mil is the end of the frontier from the statements ot various persons, and from the evidence afforded by the nature of the ground. For, according to the statements of some persons, Asuman Abad was formerly in the possession of Turkey, and the persons appointed as administrators of these parts used to live in the Mir Hussein Ali fort, on the bank of the Kulan. Moreover, 90 or 100 yea s ago. when Gilan and Gulein were within the boundary and dependent on the sanjak of Zohab, during the last days of hie time of Abdullah Pasha, one of the mutessarifs of Zohab, the despotic ruler of Persia, Kerim Khan Zend, sent troops to Zohab and laid those parts waste. Abdullah Pasha, the mutessarif, fleet with all the inhabitants of the sanjak; and of these the Kubady branch went with Abdullah Pasha to the sanjak of Keuy, while the Balaian branch went to the Mosul district. Kamim Khan’s troops, under the command of a leader named Nazar Ali Khan, lived for five or six months in the plain of Zohab. Then, in 1192 a.h. (1778), Abdullah Pasha was sent by the Yali of Bagdad, Little Hassan Pasha, on an embassy to Kerim Khan; but he fell id there and died, and the Mutessarifate of Zohab was bestowed on his son, Hadji Abd-ul-Kader Pasha. In the meantime the Persians won, and the valis of Bagdad and the mutessarifs of Zohab were beaten, so that the nahies of Gilan and Gulein could not be saved from the Persians ; and it is current among competent persons that since that time these places have been on the other side, but it is shown on the map that Gilan, one of these nahies. is subject to Bagdad. Chapter XXIII. The nearness of Gilan and Gulein to the plains, and the accounts given, practically prove that these localities formed part of the Ottoman Empire until eighty or ninety- years ago, but have lately passed into the Persians’ possession. Dihbala, too, P 1,0 ^ 5 ” - according to the cartographer—to be a sanjak at the end of the frontier. To determine the old frontier there is nothing to establish the truth, hut the above mentioned rumours and investigations and the sentence in the treaty of Sultan Murad I which runs :— e-TT*’- 5 “The localities known as Jessan and Baderay depend on us. The kassaba of Mendeljin and the land as far as Dertenk—Dertenk Ser Mil being the limit—with the plains between them, depend on us. The mountains at the side remain on the other side of the frontier, Derna and Dertenk Mil Bashi (Ser Mil), which are defined as the limit, depend on us. It is consequently deduced from these considerations that the old frontier must have passed through the localities referred to; but as the said localities consist of mountain land, there are other likely points for the course of the frontier. [A ote.—It must be explained that, instead of the terms “ nahie and “ kaza ' employed by us, the Persians use the words “ mahal ” and “ bulouk,” and when places disputed to-day and in the Persians possession are referred to, most of them are called by the Persian name “mahal ; so when, in this report, such and such a “ mahal” is referred to, it means such and such a nahie or kaza.J Chapter XXIV. If the frontier is made to pass through the localities above mentioned there will remain within the boundary of the Ottoman Empire the mahal called Aivan (Iwan), which is situated to the north and north-west of Dihbala and the waters of which extend as far as Mendeli. Chapter XXV. It has been ascertained that a century ago no one lived in this mahal, Aivan, and that region was waste and deserted. Then Mansur, one of the khans of the Kelhur tribe, who now live in Aivan, but at that time were in Persian territory, came from Persia with a number ©f houses of the Kelhur tribe and settled there. While Mansur was ruling over the said tribe there. Kerim Khan Zend, the autocratic ruler of Persia, appeared and married a daughter of All Khan, father of Shere Khan, the present ruler in Aivan, and on account of this connection he gave the khanate of Aivan to his father-in-law, Ali Khan; and since then the mahal has been in the possession of the Persians. Now, there is a stream called the Sumar (the upper part is called Kenker), which is the life of the town of Mendeli and of two biggish villages, Disheikh and Kazanieh, which are two hours from Mendeli. The source of this stream is in Mount Manshet, the highest part of a range called Shere Zul, between Aivan and Dihbala. Now this stream might be used up in summer before reaching Mendeli, and, if there were no water in it, the people of Mendeli and of the other two other places mentioned would not be able to make a* living or to bring vineyards and gardens into existence by cultivation. So when the frontier was decided upon no thought was given to any other need, and it is most probable that the mahal of Aivan, which contains the source of this stream and in which the water could be used and exhausted, was left on the 1 urkish side of the frontier, for it should not be possible for others to meddle with water which is the source of the prosperity of the three places mentioned and the very life of the people there. - Another argument for the said locality s inclusion within the frontier is the fact that Dihbala is a sanjak on the frontier and Ser Mil is the end of the frontier. In the report presented on the 18th Shevval, 1267 (1853), there were a few statements concerning the Sumar plain, the Sumar River, and the boundary of Mendeli, but I was recently in Aivan and ascertained that this mahal is within the frontier. Moreover, it has been established that the Persians have no rights whatever over the Sumar plain. The tithe of the produce of that plain belongs to Mendeli, and the khans of Aivan have no right to exact payment for the water of the Sumar, yet for about forty or fifty years they have found a means and have begun to make an unlawful levy, whereas in the beginning it was not so. p i i - The people of Mendeli, who are the proprietors of all the arable part of the plam of Sumar, are still alive. Now the cultivators in that plain all belong to the Kelhur tribe, 'who are subject to Persia, and until 1266 a.h. (1852; those ot the proprietors of the said arable lands, who own the lands on the left bank of the Sumar as far as a place called Dubiraleh, which is the extremity of the Snmar plain, used to take a twentieth—called “ akr ’ in these parts—as rent from the Kelhur tribe, which engaged in agriculture there. Since 1266 A.H. (1852), however, owing to the opposition of the khans of Aivan, to the fact that the officials in Mendeli ha^ e sought nothing [2019 6—2] Cbut their personal interests, and to the lack of men acquainted with the administration of the country the owners of the arable land cannot get the . akr which is their rightful due, aiid the khans of Aivan have begun to levy this “ akr. Those who for generations have been m possession ot the arable lands m the Sumar Plain on the right bank of the River Sumar, from Dubiraleh to a place about one and( a-half hours from the Kassaba of Mendeli, still levy “ akr” from all cultivators, whether they belong to the Kalhur tribe, who live in Aivan, or to the Kara Ulouss, who are subject to^Mendeli. The fact that some of the people of Mendeh levied £&lt; akr ” on those of those lands which they possess until 1266 a.h. (1852), while some still levy it, is sufficient to prove that the Kelhur tribe living in Aivan have no right of any kind over the Sumar Plain; but in spite of this, and of the fact that the arable lands of the proprietors of land in that plain, from the Tenk Pass, situated at an hour’s distance from the Kassaba of Mendeli to the Alaneh mill, are nearer to Mendeli itself than the lands of the other persons mentioned, while until 1266 a.h. (1852) the pronrietors themselves cultivated the lands and gave up the fifth to the tax-farmers sent them by Mendeli; in spite of these facts, I say, Shere Khan and Ulfet Khan, khans of the Kelhur, put pressure on those people in 1266 and 126/ (1852—53) and began to claim the right to dues such as those paid to the Mendeli tax-farmers, and owing, as explained abovef to the administrative incapacity of the mudirs of Mendeli, the (and-owners were forced, in spite of themselves, to give dates or other things to the said khans to the value of 250 piastres a-year. The owners used to have title-deeds showing them to have been the proprietors of the said lands formerly; but when, in the late Daoud Pasha’s time, the Persians invaded Mendeli, and everything belonging to the people was looted and plundered, the documents in question were destroyed. The mutessarifs’ entries have been noted in order by me. Chapter XXVI. The Kalhur tribes, references to whom have been made above, are divided first of all into two parts called Mansury and Shahbazy, and each of these comprises several branches. A report by a man called Mir Aziz, bey of the Kara Ulouss tribe, who are now subject to Mendeli, says that in former times, and until Seyyid Bey, one of bis ancestors, became bey of the Kara Ulouss, the house tax used to be be levied on some 2,000 houses belonging to the Shahbazy tribe and to other branches of the Lek tribe, and situated in Gilan and Sumar and in other places in the neighbourhood of Mendeli, and though Seyyid Bey’s son, Khaneh Bey, did not levy it, he had seen his father and ancestors do so. Until the time of Nadir Shah the house tax was thus levied on the Persian tribes who came to the said places, but after Nadir Shah’s time some of those tribes fled from the places mentioned and w r ent to Zohab, and an irade was issued saying that they should be governed by the mutessarifs of Zohab ; so the beys of the Kara Ulouss let them alone. Thus he and his father and grandfather had not interfered with them or attacked them ; and so long as the mutessarifs of Zohab possessed Zohab on behalf of the Imperial Government of Turkey the usual taxes were levied on the said tribes. Chapter XXVII. This is the information supplied by Aziz Bey; but in 1120 a.h. (1708) an Imperial firman was issued instructing the mutessarifs of Zohab, with respect to the Lek and Kelhur tribes, to give 400 piastres a-year to the State and 100 piastres to the beys of the Kara Ulouss. This firman, which is in the possession of Osman Pasha, who was one of the late mutessarifs of Zohab and now lives in Bagdad, has been seen and copied in extenso. The truth of Aziz Bey’s statements is practically proved by the contents of this firman; but the Kurds, not knowing exactly the dates of events, said that the tribes in question were annexed to the mutessarifs of Zohab after the time of Nadir Shah, whereas it is clear from the date of the firman that the tribes in question w r ere annexed to the mutessarifs of Zohab before Nadir Shah appeared. Chapter XXVIII. The tenor of the firman referred to above shows that the Lek and Kelhur tribes y ere Ottoman subjects. Aziz Bey’s report, however, savs that the Lek tribe is divided into two parts, oneof w r hich lives in Persian territory, between Khoremabad and Shiraz, and has been subject to Persia ab antiquo, while the members of the other, who also livem places m Persian territory from Khoremabad to the locality known as Saimara, part ol Vaikuh or Pislikuh were Ottoman'fsubjects, as belonging to the Kara Uloussi, until the time ol Khaneh Bey, grandfather of AAz Bey, bey of the Kara Uloussi, but subsequently fled to Persia tor some reason, and were settled by the Persians in the localities referred to above When this tribe fled from our side of the frontier it numbered some tGO houses but rumour says that the number of houses has nowreached - 00 . 0 - e P ntl1 W of Fetah Bey, father of Aziz Bey, and the days of the Govern- “yf* ° a0ll d the branch ot the Lek tribe known as Zer Kush and comprising oOO houses, were Ottoman subjects, as belonging to the Kara Olouss tribes. Although they lived m the Meimouk Mountains, which are considered to form part of the Pusht-i-Kuh, they opposed the payment of the customary house tax, whereupon Daoud Pasha s agent went to them with Aziz Beys father ; but at the time when they should have paid the house tax +hey rebelled again, and in the war that ensued the tribe lost seven killed I hey then fled to a place called Desht Hejnaneh, which also belongs to the Pusht-i-Kuh and lived there. Another branch of the Lek tribe is the Sevreh Sun (?) tribe, who are now included in the Bagdad registers, and who live scattered about in Khamkm, Binkudia, Shahraban, and other places. They fled again in the time of Mehmed Hussein Mirza and went to Persia. For a time they lived in the localities called Hersem and Huleilan and some of them obtained cultivated fields there. Some of them returned and came to the said places (? said mahal) after living there for two or three years, and those who had obtained cultivated fields after ten or fifteen years. [Note. The Hussein^ Mirza mentioned here is the son of Mohammed Ali Mirza, one of the sons of Fethali Shah, who was formerly ruler over Kermanshah. After his fathers death he was appointed to succeed the latter as ruler of Kermanshah, and in the days of the signature of the treaty of P238 A.H. (1823) he came and pillaged Mendeli.] Chapter XXIX. Gilan and Gulein are now wholly in the Persians’ possession. In addition to this the Sinjaby tribes, who, since the time when Fethali Shah’s son, Mohammed Ali Mirza, invaded Mendeli, Zohab, and Bagdad, have gone to winter every year in the bare plains near some plains between Mendeli and Khanikin, which, even if the present frontier be accepted, have never been interfered with or attacked by the Persians, and in the cultivated districts of Khanikin itself, in Belad Buz, and in Binkudra—the Sinjaby tribes, I say, regard these winterlands as their own property ; they give and take wintering taxes among themselves and pay nothing to the treasury of the vilayet of Bagdad. The northern boundary of the Sumar plain is formed by a stream called the Shur Ah, which rises in a place called Chigha Fakira, in a locality near the southern extremity of the Zelezerd Mountains, and on the edge of the Sumar Plain mingles with the waters of the Kenkir Biver. From the right side of this stream the Khalidi, Kelepa, and others of the Shah Bazy branches of the Kelhur tribe, who are Persian subjects, come of the plain bounded—from the left bank of the Shurab—by the left bank of the Kelal-i-Dam Biver, and on the northern and southern sides by the mountains, and when they settle there they pay wintering taxes to the treasury of Mendeli, which consists in giving one head of sheep for every flock in spring, and in paying the sum of 10 krans, i.e., 50 piastres, per flock every winter. This tax is levied because the Kara Ulouse tribes, who are Turkish subjects, live there. Moreover, about 300 houses belonging to branches ot the Shah Bazy tribes, come to winter in plains.stretching from the right bank of the Kelal-i-Dam to the left bank of the Neft and large enough for 500 houses to winter there, while some 1,000 houses belonging to the Sinjaby tribes who are still Persian subjects, come to winter in plains extending from the right bank of the Neft to the Lft bank of the Gilan, to Khanikin, and to Kizl Bubat, and large enough to accommodate a tribe of 2,000 houses for the winter. Since the date when Mohammed Ali Mirza seized the sanjak of Zohab, these tribes have paid us no taxes of any kind, and, as stated above, they hire and let among themselves as they please the winter quarters in these localities, which form part of the Ottoman territory. As explained above, these tribes come to the places mentioned and winter there, and yet pay none of the usual long-established taxes. On the road which runs from Mendeli to Khanikin, and in the neighbourhood of the Biver Neft, near that road, there are naphtha wells. These wells are in the middle of the localities in which the said tribes winter free of charge, yet they are not interfered with in any way by the Persians, and Mendeli still makes annualpayments to the tax farmers for the treasury.rw T+ mav not be out of place to explain here that the report I presented [Note. It m y 0 ( 1 853)— showed that from ancienttimesuntd 1220 a.h. ™“ 0 n 6 fc date when Abu Gha'direh AH Pasha was Vali of Bagdad, the Sinjaby tribe, who still come to wintering grounds situated between Mendeh and Khamkm used to kvy on the flocks and herds of others who came there, and to pay to Bagdad the followmf l-v O • For every fifty sheep : one sheep, or its equivalent in money, which, according to the present rate, was 25 piastres. For every horse : 20 piastres. In addition for the officials’ services : For every flock consisting of 100 head : one sheep. For every house : 1 abassi (67 paras).J Chapter XXX. If the frontier be taken as running through the places referred to above, Gilan, Gulein and Aivan remain within the Turkish boundary, and the places called Deira (Direh-Dereh) and Kala Shahin (or Gavravan) are left on this side too. Until 1220 a.h. (1806) Deira and K.ala Shahin were under the administiation of t ie mutessanfs of Zohab, and were subject to no interference or attack on the pait of the Persians, but in 1220 a.h. (1 806), after Mohammed Ali Mirza had invaded Bagdad from Mendeli, and returned to Kermanshah, a man named Hadji Mohammed Khan, one of the khans of the Kelhur, a Persian tribe, went to the late Fetah Pasha, a mutessarif of Zohab, and presented to him a shawl he had brought. On his request for leave to cultivate Deira and Kala Shahin, on payment of the tithe to Fetah Pasha, the latter granted the required permission, but when the ground was tilled and^ the crops reaped, and betah Pasha sent officials to collect the tithe according to their contract, Hadji Mohammed Khan retained the officials’ horses, saying that he had given letah Pasha a shawl but had not received the price, and that until the shawl or its value were sent he would not give up the horses. When this was announced to letah Pasha he sent the shawl. Part of it was missing, however, and the Khan said that unless the missing piece were sent he would not give up the horses. Fetah Pasha sent the piece, but as it was a little worn, the khan became insolent, and although he obtained the value of the shawl as well, all he did was to give back the officials’ horses, and not only did he not pay the tithe on the two places mentioned, but he would not restore these places, and they have subsequently remained in his usurping hands. Chapter XXXI. When the frontier ends at Ser Mil, as explained in Chapter XXII, the old frontier of the Ottoman Empire runs from Ser Mil to a place called Kala Zinjir, which was demolished in accordance with the treaty of 1049 a.h. (1639), leaving on this side the grasslands which are situated on the great mountains called Dalhu, and have been dependent on the sanjak of Zohab ab antique*; and on the Persian side, the mahal, known as Biveh Nij. From Kala Zinjir it runs to the Zimkan River, and the natural bed of the stream known as the fountain of Kala Zinjir. From the point where the Kala Zinjir joins the Zimkan, the line goes to the pass named Haft Gej or Haft Gezh, situated in the Shighla mountain-chain, which lies to the north-east of the point above mentioned. Then, leaving on this side the Mirava plain and the spring known as Seravishuy, at the head of that plain, and on the other side the other plain, which is situated to the south-east of the Mirava plain, the frontier runs to a hill situated in the locality called Narav, and belonging to the Bendiniz (Bendi Ghez ?) range. Thence it runs along the heights to the east of Kudibilala, and, after passing along the highest peaks of the great range named Saravand, reaches Mount Bizel. Thence it touches the peak of Mount Sari Suraban, and reaches Mount Kuweila, which stands to the east of Mount Sari Suraban ; and it finally ends at a point on the River Sirvan, which is on the line of a hill called Kavtieh, on the right bank of the Sirvan. This interpretation makes the old frontier of the sanjak of Zohab duly clear. Chapter XXXII. By ttm provisions of the last treaty concluded a.t Erzeroum, it was decided that the mountain lands, i.e., the eastern portion of the said sanjak, should be left to Persia,mm % rersiai , '1 from | 4a a skill 'e sent k i e senttld ilssing piect frut as it i ’alneoftkii II, Zinjir, o| on tins si 1 in, and ,n and -1 o Mnt »W of the ^ l 3 spring toabil 5 ® and the plains, the western part, to Turkey. And so it was proposed, in accordance ^ith the othcial explanation made by me during the conversation which took place at Zohab with the representatives of those Powers, that the frontier line should begin at Ser Mil and run to the summits of that part of the Dalhu Mountains which is called Beleky and looks towards Ser Mil. Turning thence a little to the north-west, it should pass through the following peaks : Enjireh, Tankeh, Dervend-i-Ju, Kuleh Siyev, and Kany Kelbi Aly, which are in the south-western skirts of the Dalhu Mountains, and are considered to belong to them 5 through the Dertenk Pass, situated to the west of the village of Rizhav (Rijab), and through the Binava Yaran Peak in the east of the village of Yaran, situated in the Ban Zerdeh Mountains. Thence, foliowing the peaks, it should turn a little to the north-east of a pass in this range, called Baba Yadgar, and should go on thus to Mount Siraneh, pass the big precipices of the Dalhu Mountains, which face the north, to Kala Zinjir, and go to Mount Bendiniz (Bendighez), which is considered to form part of the mountain range in the west of Derna. It should touch this mountain, then turn to the north, pass Siyanaver (Siyataver) and Kharareh and the hack of the Kaneh Shur range, touch Mount Bizel, and join the frontier of Suleimanieh. In this manner the upper part of the Dalhu Mountains, which were formerly included in the sanjak of Zohab, Derna itself and its neighbourhood, some mountains in these parts, and the Mirava Plain, would be left to Persia; while on the Turkish side would remain all the following : the Tak road, which runs along the Maraspan valley from Ser Mil to the plain of Zohab ; the two villages of Yaran and Zerdeh, which lie in the Ban Zerneh Mountains; the vineyards of the village of Rizhav, which are in the western part of the Dertenk Pass; the nahies of of Gelin, Direh, Kala Shahin, Bashiveh, Zohab, Jagiran, and Pusht-i-Kif; and to the left of the localities named Siyataver and Karareh, and of the Khaneh Shur Mountains, the plains of Desht-i-Leil, Desht-i-Murd, Desht-i-Huruvan-i-Ser, Keiseleh, Huleh, and Khaneh Shur. Of course, all the lauds, tilled fields, and grasslands to the west of the localities, and the places named Sheikhan, Hurin, Hershel, Meidan, Kuratu, and Kasr-i-Shirin, would likewise be left on the Turkish side. [Note .—By the mountain described as being situated in the western part of Derna and herein called “ Ben-diniz” (Bendignez) Mount Shifleh is meant. This error arose from the fact that when I was inspecting and surveying the sanjak of Zohab, the snow prevented my going to this mountain, so that I only saw it from a distance ; and the guides with me could not explain properly, for' they pointed to Mount ShiHeh and called it Bendiniz (Bendighez). But I have recently been in that district and corrected the mistake, and therefore explain that the mountain which is reckoned as belonging to the range situated to the west of Dernah is Mount Shifleh, while Mount Bendiniz (Bendignez) is to the south-east of Derna; and that, according to the points of the said frontier, Desht-i-Murd must also be lelt on the Persian side]. Chapter XXXIII. The Persian delegate stated that the sanjak of Zohab is bounded by the Diyaleh on the northern and western sides, from the spot where the River Zimkan flows into the River Sirvan (otherwise called the Diyaleh), to the place where the River Elvend joins the Diyaleh; by the Elvend itself itself in the south ; and on the eastern side by the River Zimkan and the western parts of the spurs situated on the northern side of the Dalhu chain; and he proposed that, in the division about to take place, the nahies of Hadji Kara, Dekkeh, Koiay, and Binkudra, which are under the administration of the kaimakamate of Khanikin, a dependency of Bagdad, should be included within the old boundary of Zohab, and that the frontier should begin from the end of the Kuchuk Ak Dagh, which are situated to the east of the sanjak of Khanikin and at present are on the boundary between the two States—from the end, that is to say, which is opposite [sic] the bank of the Elvend and the branches of the Bazy Diraz chains known as Cej Shirek and which adjoins the bank of the Elvend—and then, running along the heights of the Buyouk Ak Dagh and Kashga ranges as far as the place where the Ri\ ei Kuratu joins the Diyaleh, it should follow the latter and end where the Zimkan flows into the Diyaleh. This does not change the present shape of the sanjak of Zohab, and the mention of the eastern or mountainous lands and the western or plain lands becomes unmeaning. The said delegate made no reference to Dibra (Deira-bereh 1 , Kala Shahin, Gilan and Gulein—places on the left side of the River Elvend,^ eithei because he did not know them to have been dependent on the sanjak of Zohab originally, or because he had [2619 6—2] D V 1 Icanother proposal to put forward with regard to them, whereby he should claim to interpret the last treaty as he pleased, and had not yet begun to consider the places in question. Chapter XXXIV. The mediating delegates proposed apparently by way of a compromise, that the boundary should begin from a point in the extreme north of the sanjak of Zohab, where the Bamu range approaches the Biver Sirvan, pass to the south over the “ ibiks i.e., the rocky peaks—of the said range, run to that peak of this range which is really called Bamu, pnss over the peaks from there, join the Bava Kuh—he., the Bagh Kuh Mountains—turn off to the south-west, go over the peaks of the Asangaran range, again across the high mountain peaks, and finally at its southern end join the River Elvend. Even in the Persian delegate’s words there was no reference to Deira (Dereh) and Kala Shahin, but in spite of this fact the mediating delegates added those two places also to the Persians’ side by representing the frontier as touching the River Elvend. Chapter XXXV. In proposing the frontier they did, which they claimed to he in accordance with the last treaty, both the Persian representative and the mediating delegates absolutely forsook justice and moderation; and the mediating delegates, instead of properly separating the mountain lands of Zohab from the plains and attempting to divide the territory of the sanjak in a manner which might be acceptable to both parties, conceived the absurd idea of leaving to the Persians, not only the places now comprised in Zohab, but even the Shamiran district, which begins at the Derbend Khan Pass, mid has ever been, and still is, a dependency of Shehr-i-Zor. The dividing line between the sanjak of Zohab and the Shamiran district is the River Erkhuvandul, which comes out of the Kerkeh Mil Pass and flows into the River Zimkan in front of the Bizel Mountains ; so the Shamiran district has for some time been outside the sanjak of Zohab and subject to Shehr-i-Zor. Chapter XXXVI. 1 1 have shown the frontier of the places which I might have left to Persia, according to the old boundary of the sanjak of Zohab and the last treaty, and that which would result from the division proposed by the Persian representative and the mediating delegates. At that time the latter adorned the reports they drew up with the external appearance of justice, but in reality their proposals are very difficult for the Ottoman Government to accept, and it is evident that they aim at benefiting Persia. For the sanjak lies on a great Persian road which runs to Irak, and if the outlets of the lak Kira and Kala Zinjir roads from the sanjak of Zohab, and the Aivan road from the Mendeh distiict, have to oe left on the Persian side, not only would the Persians be able to send into Iiak, whenever they felt disposed to do so, as many troops and as much wai material as they liked, and be in a position to seize Bagdad and it dependencies, but it is clear that it would lead to the Persian tribes' coming to the sanjak of Zohab, to their settling without hindrance in the places which the mediating delegates proposed should be left to the other side, and to those parts of Sevad Irak being permanently overrun by the Persians. It would be superfluous to mention how the State and Treasury would suffer and the Persians would profit by this arrangement. Chapter XXXVII. i • ^' ne w ^ ien the Persians usurped the sanjak of Zohab the people of the na ne o u p l l1, ne yi the nahie of Binkudra, which was originally a dependencv of Zohab and is now in the possession of Turkey, dispersed and went to Binkudra, i l , l ^+ i en 1 ai ’ cin °t ier places; and whereas the said nahie had been waste and eser e up to t ie yeai 1265 a.h. (ISolfi one or two hundred houses of such of the dispersed populaton as were living in Binkudra moved to the bank of the River ioo'v P f T 9 rs anClen / t 1 o-d lta t 0n ’ and be S an t0 cultivate the ground. In the years from rl 1 ~t ■ • Vt- i t also, a number of houses gradually moved over there vrvet ofShebrfr U Tt ra, , a,1 v fr ° m K\iry Zenkibar, which' are subject to the it remained waste durino^ period referredto ^ T ° f diSpU ^ ; b f rf 0 e ptnoci leletied to, and 'was not in the possession of thePersians and as those who went there recently and cultivated the soil were Ottoman su jec s, e overnmen portion of the produce and the other taxes which they had een m le la i o pacing in the places to which they were subject until the date of en* rans er, oug si to have been paid to the Imperial Government. Yet it is proved that Ibrahim Pasha who lived in Zohab, had them stopped from doing so by he Persian Government; that Ibrahim Pasha took from them, as barley and wheat taxes, and representing the Government portion of the produce, 100 Khanikin Gaghans m all, viz., 60 Daghans in 1260 a.h (1846), and 40 in 1267 a.h. (1853) ; and t at m 1268 a.h. (1854) Essad Khan, ruler of the sanjak of Zohab, persecuted the people by making an extraordinary levy of 2,000 krans, i.e., 10,000 piastres. This lact would anect the present status of the locality in question, and if not dealt with, might lead to objections. The fact was accordingly notified, with other points, to his Exce lencyNamik Pasha, late Vali of Bagdad and field-marshal of the Imperial Army . yorps in Irak and the Hedjaz, and now field-marshal at the Imperial arsenal. To nave had recourse to documentary details at that time would have affected the status of both sides, and moreover at that moment I was informed by Imperial irade that the delimitation had been suspended. Namik Pasha was also informed in this sense, and he replied that the discussion of the point in question would be contrary to the clause suspending him from his duties, and he approved that it should be left as it was on condition that it should be the chief point to be discussed at some future time. And so the matter wms postponed. Chapter XXXYIII. The disadvantages to be expected it the Tak Kira and Kala Zinjir roads in the sanjak of Zohab and the Aivan road in Mendeh were left on the other side have already been mentioned. The advantages which w r ould result from their remaining on the Turkish side are the following :— 1. The Tak Kira road is a great thoroughfare for soldiers, tribesmen, visitors and merchants coming from the Paris and Irak parts of Persia to the Arab country, i.e., to the vilayet of Bagdad, and if quarantine were established at some place on that road and the Persians did quarantine before reaching this side, the benefit from a sanitary point of view would be great. Moreover, it would be of great help in avoiding the loss of customs dues. 2. It would provide a means of keeping some control over the tribes who are compelled to winter on this side, and not only would the disputes and quarrels with Ottoman subjects be avoided, but also there would be some possibility of not losing the wintering dues which should be levied on them. Also the troubles caused by these tribes would be avoided. 3. If war with Persia became necessary and troops had to be sent from Bagdad into Persian territory, the passage could be effected with ease; while if this scheme were not carried out, and it were desired to attack by the Erzeroum defile and to act on the defence in Irak, the latter could be held with a small force and the war could be embarked upon from this side as desired. And if the Aivan road in Mendeli and the points in the neighbourhood through which the frontier would pass were also in our possession and defended by a small force, it would be a key to the situation. Ottoman territory would then be safe from foreign interference from those parts, and Ottoman subjects would be left in peace. Note. —Certain points relating to the importance of our obtaining the Tak Kira road referred to in this chapter, and certain other places in its neighbourhood were set forth in detaii in the draft (?) I presented on Bebi-ul-Akhir 30th, 1268 a.h. (1854) ; and as that report can be referred to if need arises, I have not entered into details again her e. Chapter XXXIX. Rumour says that the frontier, after reaching the bank of the River Sirvan, opposite the Kutieh Hill, as explained in Chapter XXXI, runs from there to the Kutieti Hill, but if one goes by the sentence in the treaty of Sultan Murad IV, which says : “The parts of the mountains on the other side of Zalim Castle, near Shehr-i-Zor, which look towards the castle, have been conquered by us,” the frontier must run from the said hill over the Shindirva, Guzindar, and Shelvarder mountains, and thence pass through the Kemajar, Dalani, Milleh Khord, and Daleh Miz localities in the Averaman range, for these are the parts of the mountains situated on the other side of Zalim Castle which look towards that castle. If, however, the original frontier be regarded as■j ^-m-i+QinQ which are necessarily most suitable for a passing the points in Ae ' t Iirese nt subject to Shehr-i-Zor and in tiie possession frontier, then some of the on the other side, and some of the villages of the Ottoman Empire, wi ,, s Castle and now in the Persians’ possession said to be subject to Averaman (Arroman)^a ^ the must ^ left ^ ^ on this side. Averaman /as &gt; Mounta i nSi s0 that the villages dependent on other side is wholly b e'iin beh i n d the said mountains too, and therefore it is that castle must natura y n-round that the villages at present subject to impossible from .f 1 * side of the Averaman Mountains, should be subject to Averaman, and situated on bab|e that the phrase in the treaty, “The parts Averaman. Oonsequen y, J y.M™ Castle which look towards that castle,’’ of the mountains on the Averaman range which look towards Zahrn Castle, ie., means the whole ““j' 8 . 81 fir ^ edby tb esentence in the treaty which says that Chigan towards Turkey. This ,,r sli. lir i Zor for the Chigan Pass adjoins the Averaman Pass is appointed as he bmlt ^This interpretation obviates con- range, is situated in a. paralfofonrmntamrdnge.^^ ^ ^ frontier&gt; aftej fusion with regard t i the River Sirvan, follow the river to the point reaching the Kutie i • , ' u Mountains and the Avaraman Mountains turn to where it passes between the ;Xt h e Whest points of that part of the Avaraman the north and nortfowest pass through the hig^P ^ Kelioheh the IRtfo 6 pass Ihrough^which'th^Kem^an ro ad passes the Dalani hill, the Milleh Khudir P* ® ?he Adileh Min Hill, and the Surin Pass, and join the Chigan Pass. In this case A waman castle and its dependent villages, which, as explained above, are behind, «., to the east and north-east of the Averaman Mountains, will be left on the Persian Side while on the Turkish side will remain Shehr i-Zor and its dependent villages, which are to the south and south-west, together with seventeen villages which .are on the a _ _ „r and are to-day in the Persians possession. Chapter XL. As explained in a document submitted to the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Afiairs 7il Hidieh 2 l k7 68 ah. (1854), and as hinted in the above chapter, the seventeen vdlao-es wh ch lie between the Shehr-i-Zor Plain and those slopes of the Averaman range which face that plain, and which are in the Persians’ possession to-day, have been confused with other villages of Shehr-i-Zor, as though they were villages m a kaza. It cannot be properly understood from the text of the treaty on which side the treaty leaves these villages. If, however, we take into consideration the conformation of the Averaman Mountains and the necessity for both sides to observe the rule of guarding the frontier drawn between their territories, then the whole of tne parts which look towards Zalim Castle and of the western face of the region which stretches for two or three hours up to the Sirvan Plain, must remain on the Turkish side. l et no one has been able to tell us whether it is in accordance with treaties or conditions laid down that the said seventeen villages are in the Persians’ possession, or whether, like some other places, they have simply been usurped. According to present information every one has seen these villages in the Persians’ possession for_ some time and has given, information as to having heard that they belonged to Persia. As already stated the conformation of the ground and the imperative law of frontier defence require tiiat the frontier should pass through the highest points of the said mountains and that the western slopes looking towards Zalim Castle and the Shehr-i-Zor district should be lett on the Turkish side, and the slopes looking towards the nahie and castle of Averaman, with the region of Merivan, on the Persian side. The inhabitants of these villages are Sunnis and are inclined rather to rebel against the Persians than to obey them; and, therefore, at the moment when the question of taking a final decision as to the frontier was discussed at Constantinople, it was approved that the said villages should be retained on this side and the troubles on the boundary of Urajik should be avoided. In pursuance of this object, Sheikh Ali, mudir of the kaza of Elbicheh, who was one of the representatives of Shehr-i-Zor and lived in the village of Abu Abideh, was ordere secretly to obtain from the inhabitants of these villages a certificate stating that they in those villages were Ottoman subjects but had passed into the possession of the other side at the time of Nadif Shah’s appearance and usurpation. Owing to the fear of t e Persian official, they did not dare to give such a certificate while I was there ; but i has recently been obtained through Munib Pasha, Kaiimakam of Suleimanieb, and sen to me. The certificate is in my possession.13 Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Observations on the Portion of Dervish Pashas Book {Chapters XIX to XL) dealing with the Ancient frontier between Turkey and Persia from the Pegwn of Howeizeh to the Chigan Pass in Suleimanieh. IN this portion of Dervish Pasha’s book the reasons which he considers would enable Turkey to claim the line in question are given by him in considerable detail. Before, however, dealing with the various points raised by Dervish Pasha, it is neces sary to observe that in Chapter X\ III of his book, translation of wdiich was forwarded in Sir Gerard Lowther’s despatch No. . r &gt;20 of the 19th June, the range stretching from the hill called Dem Shah and the Haft Ah Mountains, which, according to him, constitute the Kebir Kuh, had already been claimed by him as the original frontier between Turkey and Persia, though he adds that “no entry or document showing that the frontier passes by the said places had been found.” Chapter XIX. In the immediately succeeding chapter (chapter 19 of the present translation) Dervish Pasha gives, apparently in support of his case, a long history, derived from information supplied to him by the Kara Ulouss tribe (Turkish subjects) and by other persons, of the Feili Lurs and of their encroachments on the Pusht-i-Kuh district, the result of which would appear to be that these encroachments began at a period at most some seventy-seven or eighty years previous to 1855, the Pusht-i- Kuh itself being then uninhabited. The general tenor of Dervish Pasha’s argument would certainly seem to be that the Beni Lam tribes vrere the original proprietors of parts at least of the Pusht-i-Kuh encroached upon by the Feili Lurs, but bis statements in this respect are not clear, while the very vague assertion contained in the information supplied to him by the “trustworthy person” of the Bahia tribe, viz., that the latter had formerly lived in the Pusht-i-Kuh, can hardly he said to have any value. The point which seems to be chiefly deserving of attention is the recommendation with which Dervish Pasha concludes his argument on this part of the question, viz., that it would be better to give up the idea of claiming these Feili Lurs as Turkish subjects and to claim only the Pusht-i-Kuh lands in which they dwell now. A pretext for so doing would, he considers, be found in the Let that should the Persians raise the objection that the Pusht-i-Kuh is inhabited by Persian tribes, they would lay themselves open to the rejoinder that in that case certain localities in the Mohammerah and Dizful regions, inhabited by the Beni Lam tribes—Turkish subjects ab antiquo —should belong to Turkey. Chapter XX. Chapter XX contains the summaries of two reports from the Bedrai people and Beni Lam tribe respectivelv, dealing with the present frontier chiefly as aflecting the localities called Bedrai, Bagsai, Beyyat, and Diluran. As regards Bedrai, while the report of the latter place states that the lands between the Kunjajem (Ganjianchun ; War Office map of South-Eastern Turkey in Asia, Persian Gulf sheet) and Gavy up to their junction at Makhlat belong to the Feili tribes, it does not seem to be made clear what part of the right side of the former river is claimed as belonging to Bedrai. The Beni Lam statement as regards the lands between the Kunjajem and the Gavy is that they “ used to be in our possession, but that since then the sons of Hassan Khan of the Feili tribe have begun to levy a poll tax on the Feili tribes there. As regards Bagsai, Beyyat, and Diluran, the general tenor of both these reports would seem to indicate that only the first-mentioned locality remained on the lurkish side, for though Dervish Pasha, in Chapter XXI, considers the report of the Beni Lam tribe to be more accurate as stating that these three places “ are m possession of the Beni Lam, he omits all mention of the statement of the latter that “only Bagsayeh (Bagsai) is left” (to Turkey). It will not escape notice that, m speaking of the Duveindj, the Bern Lam report explicitly states that the left side of that river is Persian (the Bedrai report is that the left side (of the Duveiridj) belongs to Howeizah). Chapter XXII. In Chapter XXII, Dervish Pasha then proceeds to give in some detail two alternative lines which, according to him, formed the old frontier from the Kebir Kuh [2619 b—2] Eto Sermil the end, he states, of the old boundary of Zohab. Both these lines from the noint rthe Milleh Paniom Pass) in the Kebir Knh at which Dervish Pasha causes them to biin as far as Mount Manshet (vide War Office map supra crt.) appear to he •1 V wVi mav bo noted are certainly outside the neutral zone. Prom A Mount Manshet northward^ as far as the neighbourhood of Mount Kaladja (ride Id. t nap, sheet 5) the direction taken by them is divergent and it has not been possib e to tra^ them with any accuracy, owing to the difficulty of identification o certain of the localities mentioned by Dervish Pasha. From a reference made by the latter, however, in a subsequent chapter (XXIY) to the district of Aiwam iwan m the W ar Office map) to the effect that this latter district, if the frontiers be taken as running through the places to which he refers, would remain within the Turkish boundary the deduction may be drawn that both these lines from Mount Manshet to Mount Kaladja are also outside the neutral zone. From Mount Kellemir (to the north of Mount Kaladja (Id map sheet 5)—where they again unite—as far as Sermil, the line is within the neutral zone. In the concluding part of the chapter the_ plain called Asumanabad (Asmanabad to the north of I warn (War Office map) is claimed by Dervish Pasha as formerly belonging to Turkey, as also the plains of Ghdan and Ghulem lost, according to him, to Turkey, during the invasion of Mustafa Kerim Khan Zend ; but, whatever mav be the facts as regards these particular places, the value of the assertions made with regard to them would seem to considerably detracted from by the admission which he ao-ain makes, viz., that “no entry or document has been found stating that in that ^ region the old frontier passes through these^ localities, but that it does not do so is deduced from the consideration that Ser Mil is the end Oi the fiontier, fiom the state ments of various persons and from the evidence offered by the nature of the ground.” Chapter XXIII. Ao-ain, in the succeeding chapter (Chapter XXIII), where Dihbala (in the Feili Lurs) is claimed as a Turkish sanjak, an admission similar to the above is made by Dervish Pasha who, however, in this case quotes in his support the sentence in the treaty of Murad IY (1639), which speaks of Dertenk and Milbashi (Ser Mil). But, as I ventured to point out in my memorandum on the treaty in question of the 16th March last, it is precisely the question of the attribution of these plains (of which Ghilan is one) which forms an obscure point in the treaty. Chapter XXY. Great attention is paid' by Dervish Pasha in this chapter to the district called Aiwan (Iwan), which he states passed into the possession of the Kalhor (Persian) tribes at the time of the invasion of Kerim Khan Zend, and especially to the rights over the stream called Sumar, the source of which, he says, is to be found in Mount Manshet, the highest part of a range called Shehrizul (Chira Zeuil, War Office map). The reason which he gives for the retention by Turkey of the nahie of Aiwan, viz., that the source of the said stream of Sumar, which is “ the life of the town of Mendeli,” is in that nahie, and that it was most probable that, when the frontier was decided upon, no thought being given to any other need, the nahid in question was left on the Turkish side, would hardly in itself seem to be conclusive. But, however this may be, it would seem from Dervish Pasha’s account, that for some forty or fifty years past the Khans of Aiwan had succeeded in exacting payment for the water of the Sumar, though having, he says, no right to it whatever or to the Sumar Plain itself More weight perhaps attaches to his further argument (assuming the facts to be as stated by him), viz., that the people of Mendeli formerly levied dues on the Kalhur cultivators of the laud on the right bank of the Sumar (which is here apparently identical with the Biver Ganjir of the War Office map) as far as Dubiraleh (Kala Dubrule, ibid.), which is the extremity of the Sumar Plain. But even here the admission is made by him that, for reasons which he gives, these dues have, since 1852, no longer been paid, the Khans of Aiwan having begun to levy them instead. Similarly, though stating that in the case of the lands from the Tenk Pass (Tengi Sunmar ? War Office map) to one hour and a-half from Mendeli, which are situated still nearer, a certain portion of the dues is, according to Dervish Pasha, still levied by the Mendeli tax-farmers, he notes, not without a certain warmth, that the proprietors of these lands have since 1852 or 1853 been compelled to pay a sort of tribute in respect of them to the Khans of Aiwan.Chapters XXVI and XXYIII. The information which, it will be observed, is given by Dervish Pasha in these two chapters respecting the Kalhurs, who, he says, are divided into two parts, the Mansury and the Shahbazy, would appear to have been mainly, if not solely, derived from a certain Aziz Bey, of the Kara Ulouss tribe, subject, Dervish Pasha states, to Mendeli. Briefly put, this information is to the effect that during the period of his (Aziz Bey’s) ancestors and until the time of Nadr Shah a house tax was levied on some 2,000 houses of the Shahbazy and other branches of the Lek tribe, but that on some of these tribes, after Nadr Shah’s time flying to Zohab, the said house tax continued to be levied on them as long as the mutessarifs of Zohab possessed Zohab on behalf of the Imperial Government. In Chapter XXVII Dervish Pasha quotes the existence of an Imperial firman dated 1708 respecting the payment of these dues in Zohab by the Lek and Kalhur tribes. This, Dervish Pasha adds, which practically proves the truth of Aziz Bey's statement, shows also that the tribes in question were annexed to the mutessarifs of Zohab before Nadir Shah’s time. The conclusion, however, which in Chapter XXVIII Dervish Pasha draws from the tenor of the firman in question, viz., that the Lek and Kalhur tribes were Ottoman subjects, is, as regards a part at least of the former, at variance with the information supplied to him by his informant Aziz Bey. For the latter states that one part of the Lek tribe (the Lek itself is apparently a branch of the Kalhurs; vide statement respecting them in Chapter XXVI) were Persian subjects ab antique, and though agreeing that the other part were Ottoman subjects as belonging to Kara Ulouss tribe, yet adds that they subsequently fled to Persia ' for some reason or other,” and were settled in the localities (in the Pishkuh region) where they now dwell. The further reference by Aziz Bey to the attempted collection by the agent Daoud Pasha from the Zerkush branch of the Lek tribe in the Pusht-i-Kuh would seem to be quoted by Dervish Pasha as further evidence that the latter region was considered Turkish territory. After a brief mention of the Sevre Sureh (?) branch of the Lek and their connection with the Khanikin district, Chapter XXVIII concludes with a reference to the pillage of the town of Mendeli by Hussein Mirza, a grandson of Feth Ali Shah {circa 1823). Chapter XXIX. In Chapter XXIX Dervish Pasha, after repeating the statement that Ghilan and Ghulein are wholly in the Persian possessions, and after a reference to the Sinjaby (Turkish) tribe, and to the fact that they make no payment to the Government for their winter quarters in the plains between Mendeli and Khanikin, which, he states, have never, even if the present frontier been accepted, been interfered with by the Persians, proceeds to deal with the question of the right of the lands bounded from the left bank of the Shurab, the source of which, he states, is in the southern extremity of the Zelezer Mountains [vide Maunsell s reduction of Id. map sheet 8), by the left bank of the Kelal-i-Dam. I have been unable to identify either of the above-mentioned rivers, but, from Dervish Pasha’s description, it would seem that the lands to which he is referring are within the neutrul zone, and may possibly be the distiicts watered by the Ab-i-Zerd {ibid., sheet 9). These lands, Dervish Pasha states, are the winter- quarters of certain tribes of the Shahbazy branch ot the Kalhurs, and the evidence on which he apparently relies as showing them to be Turkish territory is, as in other- similar cases, that dues are paid by these tribes as belonging to the Kara Ulouss (Turkish subjects), to the Mendeli Treasury. It will be observed, however, that Dervish Pasha, alter a further statement respecting the winter quarters of the Shahbazy branch of the K^alhurs between the right bank of the K.elal-i-Dam and the left bank of the Kalai Neft, proceeds to speak of some 1,000 houses of the Sinjaby tribe, who, accordino- to him, are still Persian subjects, and their wintering between the rivers JSeft and Ghilan and in Khanikin and Kizil Rubat. Since the date, Dervish Pasha goes on to say, when iVtohammed All Mirza seized the sanjak oi Zohab these tubes have paid us no taxes of any kind in these localities, which form part of Ottoman territory,” and again, further, “ as explained above, these tribes come to the places mentioned and winter there, and yet pay none of the usual long-established taxes.” From this latter reference, it would seem, though the passage is not ^ery clear, that the Shahbazys mentioned by Dervish Pasha above as wintering between the Shurab and the Kelal-i-Dam rivers had also for some time past ceased to pay dues to the Imperial Government. In concluding his remarks on this part of his subject,16 Dervish Pasha, it will be noted, does not omit to mention the existence of naphtha wells on the Mendeli Khanikin road in the neighbourhood of the River Neft. v P Chapter XXX. Tr, rUontpr XXX the only point-, of interest would seem to be Dervish Pasha’s statement as to how, of thedoaahties calRdGhilan, Ghulem Aiwan (Iwan), Kala Shahin and Deira (Direh or Dereh), which according to him would remain within the Turkish boundary if the old frontier were accepted, the two last mentioned were, at the time of the invasion (1806) of Bagdad from Mendeli by Mohammed Ah Mirza, seized by a certain Hadii Mohammed Khan-one of the Khans of the Kelhur (of whom Dervish Pasha, it will be observed, here states are a Persian tribe), m whose possession, Dervish Pasha’adds, they have subsequently remained. • u -p u &gt; i i The remainder (Chapters XXXI to XL) of the portion of Dervish Pashas book, with which the present translation is concerned deals, it will be seen, chiefly with the definition of the old frontier from Sermil northwards to the Chigan Pass ; with a con sideration of the claim to Zohab put forward by the Persian delegates m the conferences of 1 851-52 the award given by the mediating commissioner at the said conferences being sharply criticised by Dervish Pasha; with the necessity to Turkey of securing the Tak-i-Gena pass and the roads in Zohab, Mendeli, and Aiyan (Iwan) on the importance of wRich, both strategic and economic, he insists at considerable length, and and finally with certain considerations which in his opinion should govern the delimita tion of the frontier on the Avroman range. With these points, and with certain matters of geographical detail, I propose to deal in a supplementaly memorandum, which is in course of preparation, and wdll be forwarded at the earliest possible m0ment ' H.

AS I had the honour to inform yon by my telegram No. 323 of the 23rd instant, the note informing the Turkish Government of the wishes of the Russian Government with regard to the Turco-Persian frontier from its northern extremity as far south as Bane was handed on the 22nd to the Minister for Foreign Affairs by M. de Giers, who was so good as to send me the text, copy enclosed,* on the following morning. His Excellency called on me on the afternoon of the 23rd, and gave me an account of what had passed between him and Gabriel Eff'endi. He had explained at some length that Russian interests did not admit of any departure from the status quo before the Turkish encroachments began in 1905, and that the Russian Government had therefore decided that the protection of those interests could be best secured by direct negotiation with the Porte. The language he had used, while friendly and moderate, had been very firm, and he had given Gabriel Eft'endi to understand quite clearly that Russia would not accept anything less than the recognition of the 1905 frontier. He had added that the Russian Government, who were acquainted with the similar course that was being pursued by Great Britain as regards the Mohammerah-Howizeh line, where she had special interests, would give their support to His Majesty’s Embassy in pressing the acceptance of their requirements on the I orte, and he hoped that I would take an early opportunity of impressing on the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Russia could equally count on our assistance. I said that it ^as understood that the two Powers would mutually support each other in this question, and I would speak to Gabriel Effendi in the sense desired when I saw him next. M. de Giers continued that Gabriel Effendi had offered no observations on his communication beyond remarking that the note and memorandum were rather long and must be studied at leisure ; it was, however, a good sign that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had made no allusion to 'ihe Hague Arbitration Tribunal. I observed that as the Russian Government intended to insist absolutely on the 1905 frontier in the north, and His Majesty’s Government were, as I understood, equally firmly determined to admit no variation from the line laid down m the map oi the 18th July last, there was no room for negotiation on these parts of the frontier; to this M. de Giers assented, and urged the importance of losing no time m urging on the Porte the acceptance of our requirements, so as to leave time to find a settlement ot the remaining part of the frontier before the 25th October next, when the work of the Turco-Persian commission will terminate.

I BEG to hand yon copy of a letter addressed to our managing agents by our agent at Kasr-i-Shirin, Mr. E. B. Soane, covering one addressed to His Majesty’s Resident at Bagdad, relating to an attack which was recently made upon him by a Turkish guard at the frontier town of Khanikin. As the attack in question was a very serious one and quite unjustified, my board consider that the matter should not be allowed to rest with the very inadequate reparation which has been made by the Vali of Bagdad—viz., the permission to use a road which we have always used and which is a public highway—but that the Turkish Government should be called upon to make an official apology and/or to pay Mr. Soane some pecuniary compensation. Some such action would seem to be necessary, not only for the future protection of our employes and property, but also for the protection of other British travellers, and my board will therefore be much obliged if Sir Edward Grey can see his way to making a representation to the Turkish Government on the subject. I have, &amp;c. C. GREENWAY, Managing Director. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Mr. E. B. Soane to Messrs. Strick, Scott, and Co. {Mohammerah). Dear Sirs, July 24, 1912. I HAVE to inform you that on the 21st June last the Turkish authorities of Khanikin stopped one of our carts at the frontier while proceeding to that town from Chia Surkh, affirming that they had received orders from the Governor of Khanikin so to do. After some altercation the cart was allowed to proceed. On arrival at Khanikin of the cart, our agent was sent for by the governor, who informed him that in future no carts would be allowed to pass over our road, which he intended to close to us. On the agent making strong representations that such a step would not only hinder but stop our work, besides cutting off our food supplies, he consented to permit one cart (that he should mark) to make one journey one way per day. The cart then in Khanikin was therefore sent back, our agent having secured a written permit. At the frontier the military again stopped our cart, but on the man producing his order again allowed him to proceed. Next day a cart from Bagdad arrived, while the original cart again came to Khanikin, thus making two company s carts in Khanikin. This was the 24th June. As the Bagdad load was important, and the other cart had come in to meet me on my arrival from Bagdad, the load went on without a pass, though stopped, the driver, by exercise of his wits, succeeded in getting away.^ ^ The same morning 1 arrived, and, desiring to proceed immediately, ordered the waiting cart to get under weigh. The agent informed me that by the new regulation the lurks would not allow it to go, as one cart had already gone that day. Having satisfied myself that his story was correct, I wired to the resident at Bagdad, as the matter was n/ost serious, refusing to discuss the question with the local governor, for reasons which I afterwards Next morning, the 25th June, the cart having a full load, I hired riding animals for myself and a servant, and proceeded by our road to Ohia Surkh, and en route the unpleasant incident occurred as reported by me to the resident, and of which I enclose a copy, making it unnecessary to amplify here. ^ -d j j On the 30th June I received a wire from the resident to come at once to Bagdad but not considering our local affairs sufficiently tranquil te^perinit of my absence, and feeling it necessary to stay whilpJ^LcMeekin was so sick. I wired [2597 #-4] 20 SEP secret^!! '3 0 38 rv 19SEP1S122 Mr. Lorimer then wrote me a letter, which I received on the 7th July, the tone of which was so strong that I was forced to leave. Matters at home in the meantime improved. At Khanikin I found that a. commission had been sent from Bagdad to investigate the affair of firing and examine the ground, &amp;c. The officer had beer' removed from the fort and some soldiers changed. This commission called upon me and desired me to terminate the affair, but, as Mr. Lorimer had appeared to consider the question so serious, I refused to discuss it, and passed on to Bagdad, reaching there the next morning. Meanwhile the prohibition on transport had been removed. On my arrival at Bagdad Mr. Lorimer said that he considered the firing affair most serious, as, apart from the fact that I had been in imminent danger, the incident was one which he could not pass over without representations to the Ambassador in Constantinople, which he had made. Accordingly, failure on my part to come down and support the case would have left him in an awkward position. Furthermore, be informed me, the Turks had actually intended to close all but four roads over the frontier, and our road was among those to be closed. 'Phis, of course, I had not known, and my action, therefore, in refusing to discuss the matter with the local governor was most fortunate, as he, knowing that I was not aware of the pending total closure could have damaged our name and caused us great loss without my having the means to prevent it ; equally with the firing incident, which I had done well to refuse to discuss. The Yali of Bagdad was very perturbed about this latter affair, and finding this to be the case, and acting upon his desire for some reparation, with Mr. Lorimer’s assist ance we have been able to get the concession that our road shall remain open permanently “as an act of friendship.” We have thus been enabled to avoid an outlay of some 2001, which it would have cost to put the alternative (pilgrim) road in cart order. As the company have thus naturally benefited by these incidents I have refrained from pressing for more satisfaction regarding the matter of firing on myself, fearing to raise a spirit of opposition to the company, which might subsequently take shape in some vindictiveness, to which the Turks are very addicted when they have the opportunity. Had it not been for this consideration I think I should have been within my rights in demanding some very substantial satisfaction for such an act, which, as the vali himself has admitted, was the outcome of a deliberate intention to wound or kill, the manner of firing leaving no doubt on this point. Our agent in Khanikin, a Jew, has assisted very materially in combating the Governor of Khanikin in the matter of the carts, and at considerable risk to himself, as he is a Turkish subject; and as his commissions will shortly cease, and he performs duties for us for nothing which formerly -were carried out by a highly-paid man, I propose to make him monthly a small wage, which we shall save by the fact of securing a continuance of his services. I trust that my action through this affair is approved. Yours faithfully, E. B. SOANE. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Sir, Copy of Letter sent to British Resident, Bagdad, from Chia Surkh, dated 26th June, 1912. I HAA E the honoup to report to you that yesterday, while passing along a well-frequented road leading past the Turkish fort to the Persian frontier at Haosh Kuri, I was fired upon by the 1 urkish soldiers at the fort. The time of the morning was about 9 o’clock, and as the sun was full upon me the Turks cannot have failed to distinguish who was passing. Even had they mistaken me for a native their subsequent action is very peculiar. I was accompanied by one servant on a mule, and proceeding to this place at a slow canter when fired upon. As the bullet knocked up the dust a little way ahead and no one else was in the vicinity, it was obvious that 1 was their object. I therefore turned immediately towards the fort and rode slowly towards it, desiring an explanation. Two horsemen at the same moment left the fort and proceeded to right and left of me, while from the fort, despite the fact that I was o viously unarmed and had no intention of escaping, some thirty shots were fired, even alter 1 was within hail and shouted to them.r- on] The horseman having passed me, returned, and, coming up with me, forced me to dismount with considerable abuse, though they knew who I was, and at the same time they seized the headgear of my servant. I was then walked to the fort, where the ^individual m command was very rude, and threatened to send me back to Khanikin under escort. He offered no explanation of why he had fired, but stated that they had every right to stop me for cantering—-a thing he could easily have done by sending out a man to meet me, as I was within sight for a mile before they fired. I was unable to recover part of my servant’s headgear. This incident, combined with the fact that the same man, under oiders from the local governor at Khanikin, has been threatening to confiscate any cart, together with its luggage, that shall pass the fort without a written order, is rnost senously detrimental to the interests of both the British and the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. Company s employes and carts have passed here for years without any interruption whatevei, and the present action is one for which 1 trust you mav be able to obtain full satisfaction, as well for the company as for myself.

I have received the following telegram from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople :— Turko-Persian Frontier. Begins :—“ Unless we can inform Persian delegates of the means taken to secure their interests, it would be difficult for us to urge on them the acceptance of the explanatory notes. “ I therefore strongly recommend that the map be communicated to them forthwith. If indeed it has not been done already, it is probable that the Turks will inform them of the note of 18th July to the Turkish Ambassador in London, which would place us in a very false position vis &amp; vis Persia.” EnC iO IEP1912, DE? 1{Received on the nth August, under His Majesty's Minister's telegram, No. 167, dated 10th August igi2.)

I have sent the following telegram to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople :— Begins-.—“In view of what you say in your telegram No. 273, I consent to an immediate communication being made to the Persian delegates. Communication should be made jointly with your Russian Colleague, and you should accompany it with the necessary explanations, oral or written, as you may consider most expedient. “ His Majesty’s representative at St. Petersburg has been instructed to furnish to the Government to which he is accredited, for the strictly confidential information a copy of the draft Shatt-ul-Arab Convention, and you may take similar action, as regards the Russian {sic) delegates, it does not seem either necessary or desirable at this stage to communicate the draft convention to them. Sir P. Z. Cox will be instructed by me to make a communication to the Shaikh with as little delay as possible. “ As soon as you have made a communication to the Persian delegates please inform by telegraph.” Ends.

Having regard to Constantinople telegram No. 277, I consider that the communication referred to in my telegram No. 469 should be made with as little delay as possible. Sir P Z Cox should therefore be instructed by you to proceed to Mohammerkh with copies of the maps ; on his arrival there he will receive full instructions from here. Neither at Tehran nor at Mohammerah should any communication be made until action has been taken at Constantinople. Please repeat to Sir P. Z. Cox all telegrams with reference to the frontier.

YOUR telegram No. 371 of 10th September: Turco-Persian frontier. I see no objection to cessions proposed. All territory west of red line in Zohab seems indisputably Turkish de jure already, and some additional concessions, such as that now suggested, therefore seem inevitable if general settlement is to be reached. Mr. Shipley has map showing tribal conditions in 1850 and much historical information. As His Majesty’s consul-general at Bagdad has all previous correspondence, which vice-consul at Kasr-i-Shirin has not, question might be more quickly settled if, instead of consulting latter, former were personally to visit region in question to ascertain whether tribal conditions have altered since 1850.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 249 of the 23rd July, I have the honour to report that, according to a telegram which I received last night from His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah, a party of eighty soldiers under a captain and lieutenant has been sent to act as frontier post at Zain, and Mr. Crow hears that this small force will be somewhat increased later. There is of course nothing in this to which we can take exception, but I will take an early opportunity of again repeating to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the representations which I have twice made to him on the subject of frontier posts on the east of the Shatt-el-Arab.

IN my despatch No. 683 of the 13th instant, I reported that 1 had enquired of His Majesty’s consul-general at Bagdad what would, in his opinion, be the effect on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s interests of the transfer to Turkey of the Kasr-i-Shirin district. Mr. Lorimer informs me that in his opinion the effect of the suggested transfer would depend mainly on the attitude which the Turkish Government observe in the future towards foreign enterprise. That the Anglo-Persian oil syndicate have escaped any great degree of official obstruction is probably due to the fact that their works are situated in Persia and not in Turkey. _ ^ ^ . Assuming that degrees of administrative efficiency in Turkey and Persia remain relatively unchanged, Mr. Lorimer is of opinion that oil works which are in the tiihal country and exposed to attack would enjoy a greater measure of safety undei Tuikish than under Persian rule. , , , With regard to customs dues, if the hulk of the oil is to be expoited northward, present position of w r orks on the Persian side of the frontier is probably, Mr. Lorimer considers, preferable, hut if the oil is to he exported southward, the transfer of the district in question might he advantageous.

Also discussed is the decision in July 1913 to establish a delimitation commission to which Albert Charles Wratislaw and Arnold Talbot Wilson are appointed as representatives of the British Government.Also discussed in the volume is the region of Kermanshah and in particular Qasr-i-Shirin [Qaşr-e Shīrīn], along with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's concerns over the rights accorded to them in their 1901 concession should some of that territory be ceded to Turkey.Further discussion relates to the movements of Russian and Turkish troops near the frontier and the withdrawal of Turkish troops from certain places along the frontier.This volume is part two of two. Each part includes a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Russia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to the Ottoman Empire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Vice-Consul, Kasr-i-Shirin, Persia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Alwyn Parker</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Turkey</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Mohammerah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Shatt al ʻArab</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Qasr-i-Shirin</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Boundary disputes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000a0#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
