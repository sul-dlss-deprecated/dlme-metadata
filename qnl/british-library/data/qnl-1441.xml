Political Department. From, The Commissioner in Sind. To, The Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind. Commissioners Office, Kurrachee, th September 1870. Sir, Your letter No. 1260, of the 3rd instant, was received on the 11th. The whole tone and style of this letter is so improper, and disrespectful to me as head of this Province, and your immediate superior, that I can no longer condescend to discuss with you the subjects which I have hitherto freely and fully entered upon, in the endeavour to enable you to understand properly their true and present bearing. 2. You have entirely failed to appreciate the kindly motive which induced me to engage in that discussion, too far prolonged as it now appears, and instead of taking the remarks passed in recent correspondence as the recorded opinions of the superior under whom you were serving, and whose wishes and instructions you were bound in duty to respect and follow, you have taken upon yourself to totally disregard the former, and to term the latter attacks upon you. 3. Your letter will be forwarded to Government, with the expression of my sense of its extreme impropriety, and for such notice as His Excellency in Council may deem it to require. In the meanwhile, I have to desire that you will, pending the receipt of the orders of Government, strictly abide by the instructions conveyed in my letter No. 519, of the iOth August last. T have, &amp;c., (Signed) W. L. MEREWETHER, Colonel, Commissioner in Sind. Kurrachee, 28M August 1870. Mv D ear P hayre, I cannot tell you how vexed and pained I have felt at the course you have chosen to adopt. I have borne patiently with your objections and mistaken views, hoping that time, kindness, and reasoning would open your eyes to the grave errors you were making. But all has been of no avail, and now you have acted in such a manner towards the Khan, Harrison, and myself, that I can no longer allow the latitude that has hitherto been permitted, and which, I regret much to find, has been so grievously misunderstood by you.( 2 ) In April 18G9, when I received your demi-official letter, in which you used the phrase in reference to the Khan, 'that he must not dragoon it over his subjects as he has ' been in the habit of doing 1 , under the moral support which our presence has given ' him,' I saw plainly you were running into the dangerous course of direct interference with the Khan in the internal administration of his country. I warned you particularly against this at once, both officially and privately. You assured me you were doing noth ing of the sort, and I accepted your assurance. In spite of that assurance, you showed in your administration report you still entertained the views I objected to, and I again warned you against them. In the voluminous papers drawn up by you, and submitted in December, every point you urged, and every quotation you made,.showed that your idea of managing Khelat affairs was, that the rebel Sirdars were to be encouraged, because you thought they had been ill-used, and the Khan to be set down. This idea was pressed by you in spite of its being directly contrary to the instructions I had given in May 3809, which were, that the Khan alone was to be looked to and recognized as the sole person we were to have dealings with on Khelat matters, and that on no account was there to be any interference between the Khan and his subjects. Though suffering great pain at the time, and writing only with great difficulty, I took the trouble of pointing out the mistakes you had made, in quoting from the records, merely to support pre-conceived ideas, and showed clearly, as it seemed to me, how erroneously you had formed them. Besides official documents, I would refer you particularly to my demi- officials of the 8th January last and 15th December 1809. ou failed to notice that this persistence on your part was really verv disrespectful to me, as directly contrary to what I had ordered. However, I passed that by, and instead of returning the papers to you, sent them all ou to Government. ^ our opposition to my wishes has now taken a form which I can no longer bear with, but must express my extreme disapproval of it ; and at the same time, desire you to follow implicitly the instructions of May 18G9, in Khelat affairs, to act only with and for the Khan, and consider no one else. \\ hile much pained at what has occurred, I feel you have been unfortunate in not being able to take advantage of the assistance of those near and under you, who were gratified to give it. I allude especially to Macauley. Had you taken the help from him, which he would readily have given, and was of all people most fitted to give, what has occurred now would never have happened. He found he could do no good, so he left the Frontier and service. A ou unluckily leaned on Sandeman instead. Now, though he is a very intelligent, energetic and zealous officer, still, in the matter of Khelat affairs, he was the most ignorant of all, and therefore his support was only a simple blind following of your ideas ; no proof you were right, but a dangerous confirmation of error. Sandeman was so carried away by the minor matter of the settlement of the Murrees and Boogtees, and reviving an old trade route, that he could not regard the other and more important points at issue, and you sided with him. The result has been that he has acted hastily, and engaged in matters with which he had no concern whatever, and has been to a certain extent instrumental in placing you in the dilemma you are now in. lor him there can be no excuse whatever, and I am sorry to observe from his letter to you, received since 1 wrote my official replies to, that, instead of having the good taste to acknowledge his mistake, he attempts to vindicate his action after deliberately disobeying the plain instructions I gave him.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100024102474.0x00001a_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>Mss Eur F126/22, f 142</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x00001a</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>Mss Eur F126/22, f 142</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Letter No.585 of 1870 from Colonel Sir William Lockyer Merewether, The Commissioner in Sind, Commissioner's Office, Kurrachee [KarƒÅchi] to Colonel Robert Phayre, Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1870/1870</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-29T16:22:24</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 folio</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Letter informing the Colonel that he considered his letter No.1260 of 3 September (received 11 September) to be of an improper tone and style and disrespectful to Merewether as head of the province and that as has failed to take Merewether's recorded opinions as instructions and chosen to disregard them, Merewether had referred the matter to the Government of Bombay.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x00001a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
