We are now infomed by the War Office that they will not be able to offer any replacement weapons for those lost in transit. There are three guns available v/hich are fit to fire but there is little life remaining to them since various parts for which there are no spares are very badly worn. The shipping agents are therefore pursuing their enquiries about the original consign ment of guns and we will let you know as soon as definite information is received# Yours sincerely.

Je have been in touch with Commonwealth Relations Office and have received a somewhat unsatisfactory reply, copy of which we enclose. However, we will continue to try and obtain satisfaction for the Sultan. Meanwhile, you or Muscat (to whom we are sending a copy of this letter) may hove some comments. Yours ever y Eastern Department. ✓■■■■■■■■■■■ mt ■ 5142/A.E.(C) 6th December, 1949. (Dear Rogers) Crook has asked me to reply to your letter of the 2nd December, refereifee E.13091/1195/91* about the three 7.B. guns still due to Muscat. I wrote to the appro priate section of the tfar Office on 11th November and at a meeting of the Arms .7orking Part/ at the Ministry of Defence on 30th November I met Major Cameron who is dealing with this problem# He told me that he was hoping that he might be able to get hold of three reconditioned V#B. guns which could be offered to the Sultan, but unfortunately with no maintenance spares. As soon as he knows definitely whether this can be done he has promised to let me know# The documents showing that the original consignment of three V.B. guns and spares was duly shipped are available, but the War Office and their shipping agencies fear that it will take a very long time to trace what happened to them# They are, however, continuing their efforts to do so because if traceable the original complete consignment will obviously be much preferable to the second best which may be all that they will be in a position to offer immediately.
