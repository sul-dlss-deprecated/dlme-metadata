It would appear that the Shaikh of Sharjah has lost all sense of proportion in his precautions against what ho considers to be Shaikh Humaid bin Abdullah’s designs on his life. Hot only has he employed at very considerable expense a number of bedouin to man every tower, mosque, and double-storied building in Sharjah and the village of Khan, but he has engaged and armed 40 Baluchis recently reduced from the R.A.F.establishment. Ho traffic can approach Sharjah from Khan by day or night without being fired on? patrols on foot and in Jeeps nightly move on the Dubai border? suspected spies are arrested and imprisoned on the flimsiest pretexts; and shots compete continually with dogs, donkeys, and cocks to make the night more noisy than usual. All of this because the Shaikh of Sharjah’s very black conscience tells him that, now that Dubai is no longer involved with Abu Dhabi, he will certainly help Shaikh Humaid (the nephew of the man supplanted by the present Ruler of Sharjah) to turn him out, 1 v if only as a reprisal for Sharjah f s clandestine aid to Abu Dhabii. Hun^id, for his part, is a drunkard and an opium-eater whose most constant preoccupation, apart from liquor, is his courtesan of the moment. It is generally thought that, whatever his designs against Sharjah (and there is no evidence that he has any unless they have recently been put into his head by Sharjah’s obvious panic), he no longer has the resolution or the energy/-A 'i b ■/ - 3 - N energy to carry them out; but it is ironical that the nephew irVW-cA, fj j of the nan supplanted from the ghaikhdora should he able to reduce his uncle’s supplanter to a state of terror and, what is far more difficult, induce him to spend money freely, simply by following his natural inclination to get riotously drunk.

The Shaikh oi Sharjah made further attempts to come to an understanding with Shaikh Khalid but failed. He sent more than five deputations to Shaikh Khalid and, amongst others, were the following persons:~ Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan, Chief of the Naim, oiiaikh Obaid bin Juma, Chief of Beni Ka*ab tribe. Shaikh Muhammed bin Ali Huwaidin, Chief of Beni Oitab tribe. Said bin Huwaidin of the Beni Qitab. Shaikh Rashid bin Hamad al Shamsi of the Al Bu Shamis. Shaikh Ahmad as—Saif, of the Khawatir tribe. Shaikh Muhammad bin Salim, brother of the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah and his son Humaid. The Shaikh of Sharjah*s object in asking all these tribal chiefs to intervene in this matt r was to frighten Shaikh iChalid and consequently compell him to agree to his demands but he was unsuccessful in his attempts. These persons were not really interested in this dispute but they agreed to act merely out of courtesy to the Shaikh of Sharjah who was their host. Having lost all hopes of achieving his object, the Shaikh of Sharjah called on the Residency Agent and informed him that he is now considering referring the matter to the Government for their decision. (ii) -.eference para 85 (ii) of News iiepoi't No. 12 of 1947.

At Shaikh Saqr's equest the Shaikh of bubaitasked the Shaikh of Ajman to meet him but the Shaikh of Ajp^an refused. The Shaikh of Sharjah then volunteered to mediate and sent his brother Shaikh Muhammad bin Saqr to Ajman for this purpose but the Shaikh of A.iman was unwilling either to meet Shaikh Saqr or, to withdraw oii Masfut. He claimed that Masfut was once the property of his grandfather having been ceded to him by ; the Sultan of fus at, and that he wrote back to Sayid Ahmad bin Ibrahim saying^ that he will see the Sultan and come to an understanding wiuh him about it on his (the Sultan's) return to Muscat. On the 6 th July a further attempt was made by Shaikh Muhammad bin A1_l bin Huwaidin, Chief of the Beni Qitab tribe, for a settlement but the Shaikh of Ajman remained adamant. The Chief of Beni Kaab tribe inwardly supports the Shaikh of Ajman 'in whatever action he takes against Saqr as his aim is that Saqr should always remain weak and in trouble. It may be noted that the Muscat authorities consider the Naim as their subjects and have a tendency to interfere in their affairs. (iii) Reference para 59 (v) of News Report No. 8 of 19^7.

SUBJECT.MASKUI p The Sultan on the 27th March complained that a Sh*Rashid of was making a nuisance of himself and requested that he should be asked to stop interfering with the Sultan’s tribes. He stated that Sh.Rashid was endeavourltng to establish himself l“&gt; in Masfut. Sh.Rashid actually told me when I visited him in February that the Naim of this Place had acknowledged him as their Sheikh but the Sultan says that this is not the case. In any case if Masfut is within the territory which we recognise as be longing to the Sultan Shaikh Rashid should I think be warned th*t he must not interfere there without the Sultan’s permission.

Disaster overtook a Bahraini launch off Dubai and If passengers ut none of the crew weee drowned and another Bahraini launch is still reported missing. Confusion and loss of life during such storms is made greater through the entire lack of life saving equipment on board local passenger car ying launches by the failure of I akhudarto notify an; one of their proposed route. The gale, following on very high tides caused flooding all along the coast, the patches of sablcha along th4 coastal track between Ras al Khaimah and Abu Dhabi becoming inund ted.
