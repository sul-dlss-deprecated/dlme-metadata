The map covers the territory from west of the Gulf of Suez to the eastern side of the Arabian Peninsula, and from the mouth of the Euphrates River to Aden. The only cities indicated on the western coast of the Persian or Arabian Gulf are Qatar (“Catara”), “Godo,” and “Catiffa.” The map shows sandbanks around the coast and rivers at Medina and Mecca. Few towns and regions are shown, and there is a range of mountains in the center of the peninsula. Al Qatif is repeated as the town “Catiffa” and the region “Elcatif.” The peninsula opposite Bahrain Island, shown unnamed, is marked as where “Catara” is found. The commonly noted rivers of the Arabian coast are shown as very close together. The Arabian Gulf is called “Persicus Sinus” (Persian Gulf) and there is no name given for the Red Sea. The Ayaman area is shown as the most populated area on the map. The cartographer uses castles to denote cities and dotted lines to show the division of the Arabian Peninsula into three parts.</abstract><typeOfResource>cartographic</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Map</genre><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Persian Gulf</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Arabian Peninsula</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arabian Gulf</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Yemen</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>United Arab Emirates</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/qnlhc/2921#share">Public Domain</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
