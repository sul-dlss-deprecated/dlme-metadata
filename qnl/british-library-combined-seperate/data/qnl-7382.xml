The Aden Chief Commissioner had initially proposed deportation to Zanzibar or Palestine, but this was overruled by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, 'owing to risk of intrigues'.At folios 24-27 is a communication from the Resident regarding the custom of tribal succession in the Aden Protectorate, providing a brief summary of successions in the early twentieth century.The file includes a divider which gives a list of the correspondence contained within the file by year. This is placed at the end of the correspondence (folio 2).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for the Colonies, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Chief Commissioner, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Secretary, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Fadhl bin Abdul Karim Al 'Abdali</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>'Abd Al Karim II ibn Al Fadhl Al 'Abdali Sultan</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Lahej</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Kings and rulers--Succession</topic></subject><subject><topic>Attempted assassination</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0003ba#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0003ba#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
