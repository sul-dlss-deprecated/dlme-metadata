Jedda, i J J j &lt; i iv j 21st February, 1932. sir, With reference to Sir A# lean’s despatch I?o.243 of the 28th June 1931 concerning the general question of deportation of British suBJects and British-Protected persons from the Hejas-Pejd and referring in particular (paragraph 2) to the case of a British Indian who had Been dumped on the Asir coast by t^he xiejazi authorities, I have the honour to report that the Minister ior i/breign Affairs, in a note dated January 15th, has stated, that his Government are not prepared to pay the cost of this iaan*s journey j.rom Aden to India. As this case has a direct bearing on the general question of deportation, it may be as well to submit a summary of its history. 2. On September 17th, 1930, the Governor of Jedda requested the Legation to issue a passport to a native of Bengal, Muhamad Sa’ld by name, whom the local government had decided to deport ' to HIa hoge '. The Legation requested the Govemorate to supply particulars concerning the man in confirmation of his claim to -.British nationality} t»iis information was not furnished and nothing more was heard of the case until December 3rd, 1930, when the Govomornte communicated to the Indian Vice-Consul the Information that the nan had boon sent to one of the ports of Asir. Shortly afterwards a letter was received from the Civil Administrator .at Kamaran, dated the 6th December, reporting that the nan had arrived His Majesty 1 s Principal ecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.arrived in Kamaran, and requesting information concerning ^n. &gt;b Qi J him so that his repatriation to India might he arranged. A telegraphic reply was sent and M^ihamraad Sa’ld was passed on to Aden for repatriation, after having made a sworn declaration before the Qfldhi of Kamaran concerning the circumstances in which he was deported. 3. Sir A. Kyan then took up the case vigorously with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the 9th iarch 1931, requesting a refund of the money spent on Muhammad Sa’id’s journey to Aden and demanding a careful investigation of the case; on August 31st the cost of this journey, fifteen rupees, was eventually recovered from the Hejazi authorities. 4. On the 16th September, at the request of the i olitical Resident at Aden, I addressed a further note to the Minister for Foreign ffairs requesting the repayment of the sum of eighteen rupees two annas, in respect of the journey from Aden to India, the cost of which had been paid by the Government of Men. The Minister for Foreign Affairs in his reply intimated that his Government did not consider themselves liable for this charge in view of the fact that they had decided that the man should be sent to the ' first port abroad &lt;, . Sir A.Ryan, in a note dated the 7th January 1932, stated that as the Hejazi Government had paid for the journey to Aden, it seemed reasonable to expect them to pay for the rest of the journey. The reply to this note is that mentioned in paragraph 1 above, refusing payment on the grounds that orders were issued for the man’s deportation to the ' first port abroad '. A translation is enclosed. 5. The question is thus specifically raised as to what is to be considered 'the nearest point in British territory' in the case of natives of India who are deported from this country.lit country* I shall be grateful for instructions on tills point also when a reply is made to the other questions of a similar nature f on which Sir Andrew sought guidance in his despatch under reference* 6.

Hie Governor in Council is not aware of the object which the Government of India had in view when issuing the instruc tions, but presumes that they do not contenplate a discussion of the merits or otherwise of an order under section 3 of the Act and I am to enquire whether this is correct. If it is, the Local Government will refrain from making any reference to Consuls in any case in which it is likely that a deportee will return to his own country, as no countiy can reasonably refuse to admit its own nationals* 3* Experience has shown that Co mil s object to unofficial enquiries as to the attitude which they are likelylikely to assume if an order of deportation is passed against one of their nationals as their reply to such inq'iries might embarrass them if the deportee subsequently sou^ho their protection» tut unless such enquiries are made the Governor in Council does not see how it can 'be ascertained whether objections to the deportation are likely to be raised. He would therefore be glad if the government of India would, if possible either withdraw or modify the instructions. If this cannot be done, he would be glad to be advised as to the action to be taken if a Consul raised an objection and refused to issue a passport to one of his nationals, or in the case of a deportee belonging to another State, to grant a visa for a country through which it was necessary for the deportee to pass.c From ITo* D,3438/2&amp;-Folitical#.

Subject i- Procedure to be adopted in connection with the deportation of foreigners under the Foreigners Act,1864* Sir, I am directed to refer to your letter Ho. 857 Pl.D., dated the 10th June, 1929, in which the Government of Bengal point out the difficulty that is likely to arise in carrying out the existing instructions in regard to the deportation of foreigners, under which the local Government is required, in certain circumstances, to consult the Government of the country to which a foreigner is to be deported, before an order under section 3 of the Foreigners Act is issued. 2. The Government of India agree that the existing orders on the subject are not entirely satisfactory. There are two classes of cases which have to be dealt with, namely, those in which a deportes is being returned to his own Land these in which lie ig-being deoorted to a country; country^other than his own. In regard to cases falling within the first category, the Government of India agree that, proceeding on the generally accepted principle that each country irresponsible for receiving back its own nationals, it may be anticipated that no objection exists or can reasonably be raised to the deportation of a foreigner to his own country. At the same time, it is desirable, as a matter of courtesy, that the Government of the country concerned should be informed of the deporta' tion in all cases in which the political record of the -c deporte^ is such that the receipt of such information is likelylikely to be regarded by theui as of administrative importance. It will be sufficient if in all sucb cases an intimation of the fact of deportation is communicatee., through the usual channels, to the foreign Government concerned instead of ■fS consulting it, as required by the orders contained in the Home Department letter No. 353, dated the 4th February 1921. 3* In the second class of cases, where deportation is to a country which requires a visa for entry, the necessity for obtaining it might be regarded as ensuring that the Consular authority concerned is automatically informed of the deporta tion; while in the case of countries which do not require a visa, it might reasonably be assumed that no objection to entry exists* But in either case, the Government of India consider it desirable that, where for reasons similar to those mentioned in paragraph 2 above, the deportation is lively to be regarded as a matter of administrative importance, the country of destination should also, as an act of courtesy, be informed of the decision to aeport, more especially as it is obviously undesirable to deport a foreigner to a country otnei than his own without first giving that country an opportunity^ of objecting if it thinks fit to do so. 4. The procedure indicated above would necessarily involve very careful enquiry into the facts concerning the deportee 1 s nationality. The procedure is intended to apply only to cases of deportation to countries inside the passport system. It does not apply to subjects of Indian States or tnose oi 1.

I am ’directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before Mr. Secretary Benn, a copy of ♦ ♦ a despatch from His Majesty 1 s Minister at Jedda, concerning deportations to and from the Hejaz. 2. Mr. Henderson considers that the simplest and most correct procedure is for the Hejaz Government to refer, as at present, all requests for the deportation of British subjects to His Majesty*s Minister at Jedda, who will then, if necessary, refer the case for decision to the appropriate British authorities in the country of origin of the deportee, and on the receipt of their reply will inform the Hejaz Government whether travel facilities can be granted. 3. Mr. Henderson would suggest that cases of deportation to the Hejaz from British territory should similarly be referred by the deporting authorities to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, who will enquire of the Hejaz Government whether the deportee is recognised as a Hejaz subject, and will therefore be admitted to the Hejaz. 4. Mr. Henderson further proposes to instruct His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda to inform the Hejaz Government that, in cases of deportation to the Hejaz, the deportee will be returned to Hejaz territory without any expense falling upon the Hejaz Government. In return, Mr. Hope Gill should request the Hejaz Government to give a similar undertaking in respect of British deportees, The Under-Secretary of State, India Office.3 deportees, and endeavour to secure that they should he returned to their country of origin, and not merely to the nearest available British territory. This is the established practice in cases of deportation from the United States, and it is desirable, if possible, that it should be followed by other foreign countries. 5. Mr. Henderson would suggest, for the consideration of Mr. Benn, that the procedure followed by the Government of India in the two cases cited in Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch is undesirable, and that in view of the inconvenience which would be caused by similar action being taken by the Hejaz Government in cases of deportation to British territory, it should be discontinued. 6. Mr. Henderson will be glad to learn whether Mr. Benn agrees that Mr. Hope Gill should be instructed accordingly. 7. At the same time, Mr. Henderson will be glad to receive the observations of Mr. Benn on the question of deportations from the Hejaz to Afghanistan, raised in paragraph 5 of Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch. I am to add that cases of deportation to Afghanistan from the United States are usually referred to the Government of India by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Washington, for permission for the deportee to enter India en route for his own country. 8.

June 28th, 1931. sir &gt; - / N In your despatch'No. 5 (T 14323/14323/378) of January 2nd, 1930, you laid down for Mr. Bond’s guidance the principles governing deportation, with special reference to the deportation of British subjects by the Hejazi Government. A fair number of such cases have come to my notice during the past year. I have endeavoured as far as possible to apply the principles laid down in your despatch, that is to say I have not contested the right of the Hejazi Government to deport British subjects or protected persons whom they consider unde sirable but I have impressed on the authorities here the neces sity of (a) assuring themselves that the Government of the country of destination will accept the deportee and (b) pro viding the deportee with the means of reaching his destination or at least ensuring that he has the means of doing so without becoming a burden on the Governments of intervening countries. I have now the honour to draw your attention to certain dif ficulties which arise in practice and on which I should wel come an expression of your views. 2. Generally speaking, the Hejazi Government tend to be very arbitrary in their practice. I recently had to take up with them an extreme case in which, having encountered some difficulty in getting a passport issued by this Legation to an imprisoned Indian whom they wished to deport, they simply dumped him in an Asiri port, whence he found his own way to Kamaran and became a destitute in the hands of the local authorities there. I enclose as a matter of interest a copy of a note, without enclosure, which I addressed to the His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. MinisterMinister for Foreign Affairs on March 9th about this case and to which I have so far received no reply. This, however, is a case of an exceptional kind. It is more usual to keep the deportee in prison until means can be found to embark him for a foreign destination, which in the case of British or British protected persons is ordinarily the Sudan or India. 3. In ordinary cases the local authorities seem to think that all they have to do is to ask the Legation to give a visa or issue travelling papers and to provide the deportee with a passage to a Sudan or Indian port. When the Legation is applied to for the former purpose, it applies as far as possible the principle laid down in paragraph 3 of your despatch under reference and seeks to impress on the local authorities the importance of the requirements stated at (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of this despatch. 4. The commonest case is that in which the Hejazi authorities seek to deport to Port Sudan, as it is the near est point which can be considered in any sense British and is served by more or less regular steamers all the year round. If the deportee be a British subject of African ori gin e.g., a native of Nigeria or British Somaliland, the question arises whether the Sudan can be regarded as ”the nearest territory' of Great Britain within the meaning of the last words of your despatch under reference. This is a question which I have left vague as between myself and the Hejazi authorities, but it is one on which I should have some clear view for my own guidance. 5. The other case which is most likely to arise is that of deportation by pilgrim ship to India. In such a case, if the deportee be British, I have only to satisfy myself that he is entitled to a visa or other travelling facilitiesfacilities and that a passage has been secured for him. Occasional difficulty arises, however, in the case of persons from destinations beyond India who come to this country from r-\ Indian ports and whose normal way back is again via India, Afghans for instance. Even if the He^azi Government were more punctilious than they are, it would be difficult for them to assure themselves that the Afghan Government will accept the deportee as an Afghan national as they have for practical purposes no relations with that Government. The questions which arise are whether, assuming that the Govern ment of India are willing to admit the deportee in transit, I can further insist on proof (a) that the Afghan Government will receive the deportee and (b) that the deportee is so provided for that he will not become destitute in India. The Hejazi authorities are most likely to get over any pass port difficulty by issuing some sort of a travelling pass of their own and they care little what becomes of the deportee once he has been embarked for an Indian port. 6. I take the opportunity of drawing attention to a matter which has a certain bearing on the subject of depor tation from the Hejaz namely that of deportation of Arabs from British dependencies to the Hejaz. It is not clear to me that all British authorities themselves apply the princip les laid down in your despatch under reference. I have in mind two particular instances which I may sum up briefly as follows:- (1) On February 25th 1929, the Commissioner of Police, Bombay, notified the then Agency here that one Sheikh Kochi, whose nationality was not expressly stated, was being deported by the Government of Bengal and would be embarked for Jedda in a named steamer. The Hejazi authorities * contestedcontested the man’s nationality and after a good deal of cor respondence it had to he admitted that he was not, as the authorities in India had supposed, a Hejazi subject* The man had eventually to he repatriated to India, as being apparently a British Indian subject, at the expense of the Government of India. (2) On March 2nd 1931, the Commissioner of Police, Bombay, telegraphed to me, 'Deportee Sheikh Mokhi left Bombay for Jedda per ship Rizvani February 28th.' In this case I decided not to notify the Hejazi authorities unless any question should arise. Fortunately no question did arise and I presume that the local authorities considered the man to be a returning Hejazi subject. I enclose a copy of an 'Exemption Certificate and Permit to Travel' issued to him at the Calcutta Police Office on February 18th. 7. It appears from these two cases that certain authorities in India, though doubtless more humane and scrupu lous than the Hejazi Government in their handling of the indi vidual deportee, follow a practice not dissimilar to that of the Hejazis i.e., they form their own judgment as to the per- r son’s nationality and, if they believe him to be a Hejazi national, embark him for Jedda without more ado. It is for consideration whether this practice should not be revised, if only to strengthen our position where we have to try and get the Hejazi authorities to observe the principles laid down in your despatch under reference. 8. I do not wish to exaggerate the present impor tance of the subject-matter of this despatch, as in practice the persons involved are not deserving of great sympathy and it is usually possible to arrange individual cases somehow or other with the local authorities here. At the same time the^ '\ the Hejazi Government show an increasing tendency to resort to summary deportation as a means of disposing of undesirables and I feel that more difficult cases might arise at any time. 9* I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department and to the Governor General of the Sudan, with copies of your despatch under reference. I have, etc., (Signed) ANDREW RYAN.Copy. No. I.S. 25. BRITISH LEGATION, JEDDA. r ^ March 9, 1931. Your Royal Highness, After Compliments, I have the honour to bring to the serious notice of Your Royal Highness the case of a British Indian subject named MOHAMED SAID, which has been engaging the attention of this Legation since the date of a letter from His Excellency the Governor of Jedda to Mr. Hope Gill No. 675 of September 17 last. A request was made in that letter that a passport should be given to Mohamed Said, as the Hejazi Government had decided to deport him; but after an oral exchange of views the request was not pursued. I subsequently learnt that the man had arrived at KAMARAN in a destitute condition from some place on the coast of the Red Sea. 2. I enclose a copy of a sworn statement made by the man to the authorities at KAMARAN. It is not necessarily true on all points but an important part of it is confirmed by the enquiries which I have myself made. The conclusions which I have reached are as follows:- (l) The man would appear to have been arrested and imprisoned for a long period at Mecca and Jedda. There is strong reason to suppose that this was done at the instance of a certain AMIRUDDIN MECCAWI who had acted as his MUTAWAF. It does not appear that any case against him was heard in the proper courts. (2) The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mecca.(2) The local authorities would appear to have deported the man to a place on the coast of ASIR without making any arrangements to ensure his return to his country of origin. To deport even a criminal in this way is not only cruel hut contrary to international practice. 3. I shall he grateful if Your Royal Highness will cause this case to he carefully investigated and will acquaint me with the results. I shall he glad also to receive « the assurance of the Hejazi Government that they will pay the cost of the man’s repatriation. The authorities at Kamaran have already incurred an expenditure of Rs.15/- for his passage from that place to Aden. I would ask Your Royal Highness to cause this amount to he refunded to me. I am enquiring as to the further expenditure incurred for the man’s passage from Aden to India. 4. In conclusion I would draw the special attention of Your Royal Highness to Mohamed Said’s statement that the Director of Police in Jedda refused to allow the man to communicate with this Legation and threatened him with stricter imprisonment if he persisted in his request. I have no means of verifying this statement hut it appears to me to deserve the notice of the Central Government.
