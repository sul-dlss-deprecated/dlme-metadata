From— C. U. Aitchison , Esq., C.S.I., Secy, to the Govt, of India, Foreign Dept., To—C. Gonne , Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Dept. I am directed by His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 7549, dated 14th December 1874, on the subject of the removal of Colonel Phayre from the appointment of Resident at Baroda, which would have been replied to sooner had not the course of affairs at Baroda subsequent to its receipt made it expedient in the opinion of the Governor-General in Council to postpone an answer. 2. His Excellency the Governor of Bombay in Council has expressed his opinion ' that a change in the Residency at Baroda was expedient, if not ab solutely needful;' that the Bombay Government were fully alive to the incidents of Colonel Phayre's position; and that, notwithstanding that the Viceroy in a letter to the Gaekwar had expressed full confidence' in Colonel Phayre, they would have removed him ' if any other appointment of equal worth had been at their disposal' to offer him. His Excellency the Governor in Council, it is further stated, would have taken this step ' from the conviction that the very qualities which made Colonel Phayre an effective instrument for the exposure of the gross mismanagement of the Baroda State were ill adapted to the more delicate task of proffering advice to the Prince whose malpractices he had dragged to light.' 3. But His Excellency the Governor in Council, w r hile expressing these views, protests against the time and manner of Colonel Phayre's removal by the Government of India, on the grounds that as the announcement of it followed upon the receipt of a letter from the Gaekwar in which Colonel Phayre's removal was formally asked for, and upon an attempt to take his life by poison, it is likely to be connected in the minds of Native Chiefs with one or other of these inci dents, and to be viewed as a proof of weakness; that it will have an injurious effect on the political service, and deter officers from exposing abuses in Native States; that as Colonel Phayre's personal character was well known in July last, when the orders of Government on the report of the Commission were issued, the change should have been made then; and that the orders are unjustly severe towards Colonel Phayre. 4. His Excellency the Governor-General in Council regrets that, in con sequence of this protest, the necessity is imposed upon him of reverting to matters which it w T as hoped were disposed of by my letter No. 2563P., dated 25th November last, and of pointing out that the time and manner of Colonel Phayre's removal were rendered necessary by the acts of that officer himself, the inadequate manner in which they w r ere dealt with by the Bombay Govern ment, and the omission of the Bombay Government to keep the Government of India informed of their proceedings and those of Colonel Phayre. 5. From the conduct of Colonel Phayre previous to the appointment of the Commission, the Governor-General in Council had entertained considerable doubts whether he possessed the discretion, conciliatory bearing, and appreciation of the questions he had to deal with, which were necessary for effectually meeting the difficulties before him. It was believed, how T ever, that Colonel Phayre pos sessed the confidence of the Bombay Government; and the Governor-General in Council considered that the report of the Commission and the clear and precise instructions of Government thereon made his course plain and unmis- takcable and left no opening for the injudicious exercise of discretion and no room for misunderstanding on his part. Under these altered circumstances there appeared to the Governor-General in Council no sufficient reason for withdrawing his confidence from Colonel Phayre, especially at a time when such a course would certainly have been misunderstood by the Gaekwar, and have added considerably to the difficulties at Baroda. The Government of India having arrived at this decision, it was obviously necessary to inform the Gaekwar that Colonel Phayre possessed the full confidence of Government.fl The Governor -General in Council learns now for the first time that the Bombay Government would have cordially assented to a change in the Kicsidencv at Baroda if it had been suggested in the orders passed V- the Government of India on the report of the Commission. There was nothio' wliatever in your letter No. 1196, dated 5th March 1874, forwarding the report, to indicate that these sentiments were entertained by the Gov ernment of Bombay. This being the opinion of the Bombay Government at the time when my letter No. 15861'. of 25th July 1874 was received it was their plain duty to have informed the Governor-General in Council that the confidence which he reposed in Colonel Phayre was in their judgment misplaced. The Governor-General in Council cannot admit that the reason assigned by the Bombay Government for not having suggested the removal of Colonel Phayre, viz , that there was no other appointment of equal worth at their disposal in which he could be employed, is a proper or sufficient one. i he Governor- General in Council cannot consent to treat the intcicsts ot the public s( inicg as of secondary consideration compared with the private interests of the servants of Government; nor can he permit any officer to be retained in an appointment for which he is unfit, on the ground that he will suffer a pecuniary loss if removed. 7. Not only, however, was no recommendation made for Colonel Phayre's removal on receipt of the instructions ot 25tli July, but the Government of India were not informed of subsequent proceedings on his part which, if brought to notice, would have induced the Governor-General in Council to request the Bombay Government to replace him at once by another officer. The Governor-General in Council does not consider it necessary to enter into the particulars of those proceedings. It is sufficient to say that the Bombay Government found it necessary in your letter No. 26P. of 24th August 1874 to call upon Colonel Phayre to explain his apparent disregard of their instructions, and that in your letter No. 30P., dated 7th September, you informed him that his explanation could not be accepted as satisfactory; ^ that by direction of His Excellency the Governor of Bombay in Council you intimated to him in your letter No. 25P., dated 24th August 1874, that the Bombay Government regretted the strong terms in which he had objected to a proposal of the Gaekwar in one case, you described the closing part ot his answer to the Gaekwar in another case as ' most unreasonable', you expressed ' k the greatest surprise' at his proceedings in a third case, and you described them as ' wholly ignoring ' his instructions and calculated ' to impede most seriously the cordial co-operation of the Minister and yourself (Colonel Phayre) in carrying out the administrative reforms which it is the sole object of Government to induce His Highness to effect,' and you characterized his proceedings in the cases referred to as ' a most serious misappreciation of the actual position of affairs,' and of the line of conduct he had been ordered by the Government of India and the Government of Bombay to pursue; and that in your letter No. 29P., dated 7th September, Colonel Phayre's explanations were pronounced unsatisfactory, and the opinion was repeated that he was ' ignoring the express orders of the Government of India.' 8. But these and other circumstances were not reported to the Government of India. They were not alluded to in your letter No. 31P., dated 17th Sep tember, which purported to be a report of the proceedings of His Highm-ss the Gaekwar consequent on the receipt of the Viceroy's letter of 25th July. Nor were they reported in your letter No. 6] 37, dated 22nd October, in reply to my letter of 6th October, in which Colonel Phayre's reports of his proceedings subsequent to the receipt of the orders of 25th July were called for. They were not submitted with your letter No. 6159, dated 23rd October, which purported with reference to your letter of 17th September to forward a letter from the Resident with translations of communications made to and received from the Durbar consequent on the decision of His Excellency the Viceroy in Council on the Baroda Commission Report. It was only on 19th November3 in answer to my telegram of lltli November in which copies of all correspond ence were called for, that full information was furnished to His Excellency the Governor-General in Council. Your letter was received here on 23rd Novem ber, and the orders for Colonel Phayre's removal were issued on the 25th. 9. The Governor-General in Council considers that the Bombay Govern ment, who in July were of opinion that a change in the Residency at Baroda was expedient, ought in August, when they found it necessary to censure Colo nel Phayre for disobedience of orders, to have at once recommended his removal. Had they done so, they would have received the cordial support of the Governor- General in Council. But whether they thought a change to be necessary or not, it was their manifest duty to have reported at once that Colonel Phayre's proceedings had not justified the confidence which the Government of India placed in him. The orders issued and the policy prescribed for Colonel Phayre's guidance were those of the Government of India, and the Governor-General in Council ought not to have been kept in ignorance of the fact that his orders had been disobeyed, his policy misunderstood, and his name improperly introduced in discussions between the Resident and the Gaekwar. Had the circumstances referred to been brought to notice at the time they ought to have been. Colonel Phayre would have been at once removed from office, before the case became complicated by the Gaekwar's request for his removal, and by the attempt to take his life by poison. Much as the Governor-General in Council regrets that this atrocious attempt was made, he cannot consider that the question of the propriety of Colonel Phayre's removal at the time it was ordered is affected by it. Information of the attempt to poison Colonel Phayre was first received here in your telegram of 13th November. But in fact (as Uis Excellency the Governor of Bombay must be aware from the \ iceroy's telegram of 12th November), before information of it was received, the Governor-General in Council had already seen, even in the incomplete collection of papers which was at that time in his possession, sufficient to convince him that it would be necessary to send another officer to Baroda in place of Colonel Phayre. The papers subsequently received on 23rd November, in answer to the request conveyed in my telegram of the 11th of November, disclosed so serious a state of affairs that, in the opinion of the Governor-General in Council, Colonel Phayre's immediate removal from office was imperatively demanded in the public interests. He was accordingly removed by the orders of 25th November. The apparent coincidence of his removal with the events referred to was unfortunate. His Excellency in Council, however, has no fear that his action in regard to affairs at Baroda will be viewed by Native Chiefs as a proof ot weakness 5 but under any circum stances he would not permit such a consideration to deter him from discharging his duty and taking measures which the interests' of the public service in any case appear to him to demand. 10. With respect to the injurious effect which it is feared the removal of Colonel Phayre may have on the political service generally. His Excellency the Governor-General in Council does not entertain an\ apprehensions on that account. It is the earnest desire of the Governor-General in Council to give every support to his officers who are placed in positions of difficulty and to whom delicate and important duties are entrusted, buch support w ill be readily accorded them so long as their proceedings are guided by the instructions con- veved to them. But the removal of an officer who not only misunderstands the spirit of his instructions but violates their plain meaning and letter, who fails to see his errors when they are pointed out, and who is censuied in such terms as those quoted in paragraph 7 of this letter, is calculated to have a salutarv rather than an injurious effect; and His Excellency in Council wishes it to be understood that he will not hesitate to remove fiom an appointment any officer, whoever he may be, who ignores his instructions in the mdnnLi Colonel Phayre has done. 11. The Governor-General ^in Council regrets that the Bombay Govern ment should have characterized the orders ot the Government ot India as1 unjustly severe towards Colonel Phayre. I am to remind you that before the papers called for in my telegram of 11th November were received an oppor tunity to resign was given to Colonel Phayre, of which he did not avail himself, and the Governor-General in Council can see no injustice in removing an officer from an appointment for which he is admitted by the local Government to be unfit, and who disregards the plain instructions of the Government of India. 12. The remarks already made sufficiently explain the grounds on which the Government of India described the notice taken of Colonel Phayre's pro ceedings by the Bombay Government as inadequate, regretted the delay on the part of the Bombay Government in submitting full information of their pro ceedings, and withdrew for a time from the Bombay Government the control of Baroda affairs connected with the report of the Commission. The Governor- General in Council will only say that after full consideration of paragraphs 11 to 14 of your letter lie is unable to alter the opinions he has expressed. 13. In conclusion, I am to express the satisfaction of the Governor-General in Council at the issue of the instructions referred to in paragraphs 1 to 3 of your letter with a view to giving every assistance to Sir Lewis Pelly in the discharge of the difficult duties that have been entrusted to him. 4 Exd.—J.
