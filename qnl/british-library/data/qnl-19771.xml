Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the rei-sian Guif, To The Hon'ble Sir A. H. McMahon, K.C.I.E., C .S.I., Secretary to the Govern- ment of India m the Foreign Departmentj Simla, I have the honour at length to submit the material collected for our reply to the German Rejoinder in the Abu Musa case, together with my observations on it. 2. When I telegraphed from Henjam at the end of March that I had collected he local material and that the writing of it up would occupy some days, I did not realize that it would prove to be quite the intricate task which I have found it, to deal with all the small points used in the German communication. When at headquarters I am subject to incessant interruption and I have only been able to complete the report by coming for a few days to the Shat-el-Arab and working in quiet on the Lawrence. The German Rejoinder was a formidable document if read by itself, but when studied by the light of the papers already recorded, a great deal of the substance fell ont of it, and I have seen no reason to alter the appraisement which I made of it in enclosure (1) to my note of February 19,1910, submitted to His Majesty's Foreign Office. So far as I can judge, the fundamental points of our case remain unshaken and the papers now submitted will, I hope, be found to supply a not unsatisfactory reply, to accompany our offer of compromise. To save time, I have ventured to forward two copies of the papers by the same mail to the Political Secretary, India Office. Bne/ comment in summary of the fresh It seems unnecessary to do more than take up the thread from the point where it was left by my note submitted to His Majesty's Foreign Office on 12th February 1910, to which I beg reference. The ' Issues 'referred to below are those framed in that note. Issue {a)— (1) The right to jetsam and flotsam. It is shown by documentary and testamentary evidence that in the Gulf the right is levied by the local inhabitants and their overlord, if he can, and sees fit to do so, takes his share. It is shown dso that no one but the ruling Shaikh has been recognized in this connection, but that he (Sagar) in virtue of the arrangement by which he allowed Salim the income of Abu Musa, has left the levy to him- (2) The rejected version of the oxide concession, dated 6th April 1898, is shown to have been drafted by Abdullah bin Hasan Samaiyeh himself, and to have been rejected by Abdul Latif specifically on account of the unwarrantable claim therein put into Salim's mouth, of formal owner ship. The final version of the concession was then drafted by Abdul Latif himself. (3) What the German note calls ' revenue from mother-of-pearl and canary seed ' is shown to be a mistranslation. It should be ' ground rent from storage of ' muhar' and ' zinni oyster-shells.' The ' muhar ' and ' zinni' are two species of pearl-bearing shells. The word for canary seed ' kazni' is somewhat like ' zinni.' Shaikh Sagar specifically allowed this to go to Salim as part of the income of the island. (4) The mica lease was given with the ruling Shaikh's knowledge and consent and Shaikh Salim was allowed to take proceeds as part of revenue of island. It proved to be a mare's nest and fizzled out. Salim's enjoyment of the income of the island, with the consent and subject to the pleasure of the ruling Shaikh, is not disputed. C205FD2 I may mention here for the information of Government—it has been considered unnecessary to mention it in the evidence—that a change has come about in the relations between Shaikh Sagar and Salim. Shaikh Sagar's son Khal«jd, Shaikh of Ras-el-Khaima, having died of con sumption, Sagar sent his uncle Salim there temporarily to take charge as Deputy Governor. Soon after his arrival there his son committed a murder in connection with a love affair. Shaikh Sagar wanting to have the murderer tried and punished: Salim ih order to save his son set himself up adversely to Shaikh Sagar and placed himself on the defensive. It being the pearling season and all his men away, Shaikh Sagar took no punitive action and eventually made terms with Salim and allowed him to remain as Shaikh of Ras-el-Khaima. He has accordingly ceased to pay him any pension and withdrawn Abu Musa from his enjoyment. I db'iibt think we need mention this as the development is still fresh and had better be left to crystallize quietly. Issue (6). A quantity Of similar evidence has been obtained in refutation of the mercantile and clerical evidence furnished in the German Rejoinder. Issue (c). The Memorandum of Association proves never to have, been • ■ completed or even seen by the other partners—and never to have been ixi acted upon. Hasan himself iuiw claimed (to Abdul Latif) to be entitled ' to act 'on it, nor even mentioned it in his remonstrances. 1 As an authority in Hasan's hands it did not exist. We concede that Hasan up to a certain point was managing partner, but this monopoly contract was a new departure, beyond his powers. Issue {d). requires no fresh evidence. It is further argued. Issue (ej. Important evidence has been produced in the shape of Malcolm's deed of partnership corroborated by a letter of Hasan Samaiyeh, showing that Hasan himself drew up and inserted a prohibition against the sale by any partner of any share without the express consent and signature of'the other partners. In the case of his purchase of Yusufs share and transfer to Brown, he neglected to comply with, this condition ; it is therefore invalidated in any case by his own provision. Issue (/) is combated. No evidence is needed. May 30, 1911 P. Z. COX. RetficirJcs on the Gefiuan exposition of those the are 'not disputed Shaikh Sagar at the time intended to drive Shaikh hy force but was frevented from doing so hy QyU Yes ' indirectly prevented. Shaikh Sagar was reminded by the British Resident that the principles of the Ma&amp;ime Truce applied to the islands, and was informed that he must not let his quarrel with his uncle lead to a disturbance of it. Shaikh Salim was given pacific advice of a like nature. But for his fear of our displeasure it would obviously have been a simple matter for Shaikh Sagar, who at that time had all his tribesmen at his back, to send two or three dhows full of armed men to Abu Musa and eject Shaikh Salim or bring him away. The latter had no following with him at the time or means of defending himself. But the British political authorities know by experience that if these Ajab Shaikhs are allowed to send armed tribesmen to sea in boats, their followers inevitably get out of hand and probably start firing on or looting innocent craft, and thus dis- thtb the martime truce generally. We have in consequence been obliged to make it an invariable rule, not to agree to the passage by sea of dhov)s biVi r&gt;{ armed men, unless-it be with the express consent of' the Resident and in the presence, if necessary, of one of His Majesty's ships. As a matter of 'fact it would probably have saved a good deal of subsequent trouble in this case, had the Resident allowed5' Sd lereCto'kX *°f^ ^ 4^1 at luZZl ana tnereloxe tooK «ae next best course lie could, iiamely to sterilizp the dinmitp Butb^aisSkl Sagar Foyally fowM^ Se B^h ^ r ^ T?^ 6 ^T' i he car ! not l ' eas onably be thetfeby held which he possessed as lulmg Shaikh and which he Ldd have made g^d hit te Z). f 0 3 : t - eI&lt; ; ' t&lt; ' 1 h' ;0nte ? ded that HWId.

[It will be'shown later on (item 69) that Hasan by his own admission had no right to sell this share.] (6) 2,000 to 5,000 tons of red oxide we for four years from the mines on Abu Musa. another party to deliver 400 tons a year for —This is a misleading repvesentation of the facts. Except for a quantity of 2,000 tons which Hasan had already contracted to supply to another party, at the rate of 400 tons per annum, Wonckhaus acquired an absolute monopoly of the output fox four years and a preferential right to renew at the end of it. (7) The ostensible ground for this step csmeplaint Tsa Shaikh that the contract for delivery of red oxide his-sanction.—It was both his interests and those of Isa bin Abdul Latif which formed the ' ostensible ground' for Shaikh Sagax's action (see also item 7 of Bxitish Memoxandum). The Shaikh gave his own xeasons for withdxawiiv the concession; they wexe, .that Hasan had given a monopoly which he had no authority to do and had thus made it evident to the Shaikh that his own xights over Abu Musa might be endangexed by the continuance of the concession in such unsafe hands. He in fact realized that Hasan was acting in a way calculated to pxejudice his interests, and in his later letter of 26th Maxch to Hasan (Annex 16 of Fixst Gexman Memorandmu) in reply to Hasan's protests, he explained himself further. He said he had concurred in the original concession because all the parties were British subjects and thus every one concerned was under his own control or that of the Bxitish Govexnment; but he objected to the admission into the concexn of the subjects of a foxeign power ovex whom he would have no contxol. He feaxed that the mines might go out of his posses sion ; and it is clear that the appxehension was not altogether an empty one, for in their letter to the Shaikh, dated 13th October 1907, Messrs. Wonckhaus wrote: * VV e have paid to them (Hasan, etc.) vexy considerable advances * * * and we considex that the oxide lying on the seashoxe is oux propexty and the mines arid the concession are security Again when Messrs. Wonckiiaus's employe, Brown, attempted to land at Abu Musa on 22nd October 1907 with Haji Ali Tashankax and a number of men from Lingah, and was prevented by the resolute attitude of the Sh; ikls 's guards, he was reported by Lieutenant Gabriel to have had with him a German flag which he intended to erect4 at the oxide mine or over the accumulated mineral. Lastly when Dr. Listemann, Co nsul for Germany at Bushire, addressed Shaikh Sagar direct on 19th November 1907, protesting at his action, he wrote that Messrs. VVonckhaus having purchased a share in the Mining Company now had a ' Madkhal' (means of entry) directly into the working of the mines. Messrs. Wonckhaus's claims and action were obviously calculated to bring the Sh-ikh up against the provisions of the Treaty of March 6, 1892, with the British Government. (See also item 68.) The grounds of complaint advanced by Isa bin Abdul Latif were, briefly, (i)the grant by Hasan of a monopoly which he had no authority to grant; (n) Hasan's failure Uto consult his partners, (in) the fact of Hasan signing himself as 'owner and holder' of the concession. (8) Shaikh Sagar on 3rd October 19 cease. —The words ' and that he should remove his coolies and gear within 10 days ' might be added. (9) Thereupon about 20th October. —' After 20th October' the words 'Hasan having taken no notice of his warning 'might suitably be inserted. (10) The boats containing the Shaikh's hy the British warship Lapwins;.—The reasons which made it expedient that one of His Majesty's ships and a representative of the Residency should be present were explained in count 4 of the British Memorandum, but also item (1) above. (11) Two employes of the firm of Rob Wonekhaus were received ivith bullets hy the Shaikh's arm —The said employes had no business to be where they were. It was only after they had persistently ignored repeated shouts of warning that some shots were fired over their heads. Mr. Brown, who was also one of the parties, is a British subject, and would doubtless have complained to the Residency if he had thought he had any legitimate ground for so doing. He has never done so. A t Position. of Shaikh Sagar with respect to ( from view of pri It is stated in the British Memorandum * * * that the representative of Sagar and while he aete pilgrimage that Shaikh Salim concluded the lease agreem the British Memorandum said was: 'Salim declares that in granting the lease of 1898, he merely acted as proxy for the ruling Shaikh, then absent on pilgrimage to Mecca * * * It thus appears that Salim did not conclude the lease of 1898 in the capacity of owner, but in that of regent * * * Salim himself wrote : ££ When I leased the mines of Abu Musa I was offi ciating on your behalf and the concession was given by proxy for you ; and I was well aware that on your return from the pilgrimage to Mecca, if you considered my action in the matter of the concession was good, you would confirm what I had agreed to, and if in your opinion it was objectionable you could annul it, either at the time, or at any other time. It will be seen later on in these papers that the grant in some capacity by Shaikh Salim in December 1898 of a concession for exploiting ' Mica ' m Abu Musa ha? to be admitted. (It was never reported to the Residency and came to nothing ) At the time of its grant Shaikh Sagar had returned from his pilgrim- aae and states that he was consulted by Shaikh Salim and approved of the grant But he—Shaikh Sagar—being present, we cannot maintain in this case that the concession was granted by Shaikh Salim as regent. The natural explanation is this Shaikh Salim admittedly was allowed to reside m the island as tenant ard enioy the produce, subject' always to his own loyal behaviour and to the will and pleasure of Shaikh Sagar. In the case of the oxide concession the posi tion would be that Salim gave the concession after obtaining the concurrence of himself as recent and subject to Shaikh Sagar's confirmation. In the case of ' Mica' concession he gave it after consulting Shaikh Sagar who was hunself present.5 As regards Shaikh Sagar's letter of 11th October 1902 to the British Resi dent. His statement that Salim granted the concession * as regent ' would still stand so far as it went, and the motive of its assertion is quite an intelligent one and quite different to the far-fetched one that the German Rejoinder seeks to put on it. They say that being under the mistaken belief ' that he was prohibited by the Treaty of 1892 from entering into such transaction with any one but a British subject, and Nakhoda Ali being a Persian subject, he was anxious to persuade Colonel Kemball that Nakhoda AH was not a concession aire at all and that if there had been any fault it was Salim's and not his. The only basis for this view is a garbled version of a remark said to have been dropped by Shaikh Sagar, and there is no real foundation for the hypothesis at all. To go back to the' letter itself and Colonel Kemball's letter to which it is a reply. I would explain that business with the Trucial Chiefs is carried on almost entirely through the Residency Agent. Direct letters between, the Resident and the Shaikhs are of comparatively rare occurrence, and when they are neces sary the Resident's letters are always sent to the Agent under flying seal (or accompanied by a copy for the Agent's record) for delivery. Similarly the Shaikh's reply addressed to the Resident direct is given to the Agent to close and forward. No Shaikh would think of answering a letter of the nature of this one (Colonel Kemball's) without consulting the Agent before replying. In this particula r case too. Shaikh Sagar knew that the Agent himself was personally and financially interested and consulted him fully as to the terms in which he had best reply. In proof of this we have the fact thBtSagar's letter, above quoted, is found to be written on the Agent's office paper bearing the Government of India watermark. It is obvious that unless Shaikh Sagar wanted to quarrel with Abdul Latif, the answer must be what the latter w&amp;nted and advised, and what Shaikh Sagar said to the Resident, in other words, was :— ' What you have heard about the Abu Musa oxide concession being in the hands of Nakhoda Ali, of whom I know you have a bad opinion, is not true ; the concessionaires are three of your own people and I supposed your agent had given you the necessary details of it. Incase you may notice that the conces sion was executed by Salim and not by me, I would explain that Salim granted it with full powers as regent for me, during my absence at Mecca, and it is still operative, and has my support, so I hope you will not think it necessary to make any difficulties about it.''' His object was not to disclaim responsibility at all, but on the contrary to make it clear to Colonel Kemball that the concession was in order and had his own approval. As a matter o'f fact so far as we were concerned there was no ban whatever against Nakhoda Ali, qua Persian subject. The position at the time in this regard is set forth in item 26 following. (13) Sheikh Sagar increased this allowan Abu cluding that derived from the red oxide mi —This statement is correct. (14) Memorandum of Shaikh Sagar, —This is a clerical error. It should, of course, be 1908. (16) Attention must he called to an ina randum. —There is no such inaccuracy. What Shaikh Sagar stated was (Annex 5 of .British Memorandum): '' I have absolutely not given any deed in connection with the island nor in regard to the mines thereof ; all I did was to relinquish the income to him, in the way of financial assistance * * There was no stipulation or mention that the income to be left for Salim was to be restricted to that of the mines. This was obviously not the case because Shaikh Salim was also allowed to enjoy the fees for landing and storing muhar and zinni oyster-shells for export (vide Annex 5, British Memorandum). Also see Annex 1, British Memorandum, in which Salim writes : ' You were kind enough to place Abu Musa under my supervision, so that I might cultivate therein and reap from it the means of subsistence. C205FD6 The position bo doubt was that Shaikh Sagar relinquished to Salim all revenue that might accrue from the island, so long as Salim did not importune him for money and so long as the income did not become so considerable as to- be more than Sagar's interests could allow him to relinquish or Salim could expect to receive, (See also penultimate paragraph of enclosure 6 of First British Memorandum.) (16) The Imperial Government regret objectionable testimony the letter of Shaikh SaU Sagar, t eb- ruary 1908. —-The reasons of the German Government for this attitude are that the letter was written at the time the case was in progress and that I, Major Cox, was at Shargah just at that time. This is a very convenient way of dispos ing of a ft.iffi.cult piece of evidence, but this argument, I hope, can be resisted. Obviously there was no reason for Salim to write such a letter until.tie learnt of the way in which his name was being used and of the claims on Abu Musa Island with which he was being credited. The argument of the German Government in regard to the objectionability of the evidence to this document would apply to a number of the annexes to their rejoinder. Although they bear each other no. affection at heart, the two Shaikhs have been quite of one mind in regard to the behaviour of Hasan Samai- yeh and the expediency of withdrawing the concession and if it had not been withdrawn by Shaikh Sagar it would have been withdrawn by Sh- .ikh Salim. In any case Shaikh Salim absolutely adheres to what he then wrote. ote. —His own letter was read over to him in the presence of myself and the Residency Agents of Lingeh and Shargah and he said he absolutely adhered to it.) (17) The Shaikh's letters to the British the British Memorandum) are no evidence of arguments used in support of this statement seem to be a good deal laboured. The position was clearly as stated under item 12 above. Shaikh Sagar had just been created ruling Sh akh by the voice of the tribe, who were tired of Sh ikh Salim : Sagar was obviously in a very strong position and afele to turn Salim out of Abu Musa if lie had a fr^e hand, but the R^siuent told him that if in doing so he broke the maritime truce he would be suppressed. Shaikh Sagar replied with a good deal of force? ^ If you do not^ want us to fight, please remove Salim from the island yourself; if you find it inconvenient to do that then leave us to settle the matter and do not call me to account ii w e fight. At least, if you will not let me proceed to extremities with him, make him give a written undertaking, guaranteed by you, that he will behave himself, so that I need not bother about him, 5 ' I think any one reading Shaikh Sagar's letters under reference would regard them, especially that of February 14, 1884, as not only having in mind the need to preserve the maritime truce and put an end to the political confl ct, but also as intended to form a specific assertion of his right of ownership as ruling Shaikh, and so to safeguard himself against any prejudice to that right which might otherwise result from the Resident's sterilizing action. (18) Aha Musa is our island and adependancy We , it to others. I gather from the observations made under this head and from the italicising of the word''our 5 % that from the fact that the transaction quotes Shaikh Sagar as using the plural pronoun in reference to himself, it is sought to deduce that Shaikh Sagar was not referring to himself but meant £e we,' i.e., ' the Jowasim ', and only intended to claim that Abu Musa belonged politically to the territory of Shargah or the Jowasim, Whether or not this was the case cannot at all events be determined from the use or misuse of the pro noun, Generally when writing formal letters these Shaikhs use the plural pro noun in reference to themselves. In this instance I find, on reference to the original, that it is the translator of 1884 who is responsible for the use of both forms in the one translation. In the original Arabic the plural pronoun is used throughout both letters. With reference to the German arguments on this point. It is to be noted that when Sagar uses the plural pronoun they argue that by doing so he intendedbut to'kt'Shargah State opth e J era asm while when Sahm uses ifc (Lepage 6 of English version of Germ-^ Rejoinder) and speaks of ' our island ' they say he meant ' my island 'I there f ° 0 ^gn/ficanee i' the use, either way, and that both Shaikhs probably meant our (Jowasim) island, vested in the ruling Shaikh. T^^ntentim is evidently that Salim had no right whatever to Abu Musa and if he did live there it was on Sagar.-Yes this IS the contention. No right except what he derived from the ruling Shaikh and enjoyed subject to his pleasure and Salitn's own loyalty. (20) Those letters then having nothing shp.-lam inclined to agree According to my view there is, and cr.H be. no private ownership of the island. Salim might conceivably own property on it. but if he did, he could have title deeds for that property. The facts are that when ruling Shaikh he built a house and planted some date-trees. When he ceased to he Tulin£ Shaikh he ceased to own these except by his successor's ti v our. If shaikh s-agar evicted him from Abu Musa he might choose to recom pense Salim for his expenditure and trouble while tenanting the island, or he might not (see Annex I and item 28). _ \?\l j-he ietter, too, which ShaikhSagar .jienii'uU on 11 Ji October 1902 {Annex 7 of the British Memorandum) seems on cms *examination to have a very different British Memorandum. In order to understa to know the purport of Kernbdl's enquiry * * # 'printed in the Memorandum.—Qoloiad KembalFs letter (No. 75 of 10th March 1S02) ran as follows :— ' A report has reached me that you wish to grant a concession to Hav Nakhoda^ Ali Ahmed. Saleh for excavating and exporting red oxide from the island of cir Bu Nuair. x have therefore the honour to inform you that it would be advisable for you to let me see the draft of the concession before concluding the arrangement. T , ' I s hal{ also be if you will let me see a copy of the concession granted to haji Nakhoda Ah for working the red oxide mines' on the island of Abu Musa. 3 ' I would remark in the first instance, for the information of Government, that Haji Nakhoda Ali being a Persian subject, and a rascal, the alleged lease of oxide mines to him would appear to be a matter deserving more attention than was given to it at the time it was reported (1898); but' it was reported very casually -at the time by the Residency Agent and 'in any case Colonel Kemball was not Resident then and it was no responsibility of his, and he naturally spoke of the matter as a fait when addressing the above letter to Shaikh Sagar. The pointed suggestion in the German reply that we had reason for not pro ducing the letter, inclines me to suppose that they have seen it. This is quite possible. At the time the letter was written there was no German element con nected with the concession, and Shaikhs Sagar and Salim., Abdul Latif, and Hasan Samaiyeh, were all in each other's confidence, and the Resident's enquiry and Shaikh Sagar's reply would have been of interest to and probably discussed by all of them. I am not sure of the reason which prompted Government not to produce this document, but I should presume it to be this : Nakhoda All was a Persian sub ject, but no objection was then raised by the Residency on that ground to his participation. The Germans might argue that if Shaikh Sagar had in 1898 granted a concession to a foreign subject, and we had not objected for four years, why should Shaikh Sagar object, as he now has, or we, to the entry of Wonckhaus into the concern. As a matter of fact Colonel Kemball was mistaken. Nakhoda Ali was not a sharer in the original concession ; his name was dropped for a specific reason. As a fraudulent bankrupt he was a disreputable person and incidentally, over whom neither the Shaikh nor Government had any ultima t;; control. 1 do noti quite see what we liave to lose by producing this letter, seeing that the position then was as explained in item 26. (22) ColonelKemball certainly seems i.e., Salim, as the owner of the mines in question,— Kemball was not Resident then, but Colonel Meade. The entry is obviously a very sketchy one. He does not even know then precisely what mines are referred to, but merely mentions the report and says enquiries will be made later These were apparently over looked, vide item 21 (above). ^23) * * * * And — (also see footnote to this sentence in German case),—I think the interpreta tion placed by me on this in (17) above is the right one. (24) Presumably has a right to do so—Ye a right enjoyed by him from Shaikh Sagar and subject to the latter s pleasure. (25). When asked by the Dragoman of Bushire on the 28th November 1907 ' ' what harm is German firm % 'Shaikh Sagar replied ' we English which prevent us from leasing any part of our subjects ' -The accuracy of the above quotation can be impugned, vide my letter No. 170. dated 12th January 1908, to the Government of India in which I gave Shaikh Sagar's version of what passed and drew attention to the fact that the Ge-man Dragoman did not know Arabic and that the interpreter was Abduiia bin Hasan Samaiyeh, one of the defendants in the dispute whose character is of the shadiest and whose 'motive in putting words into Shaikh Sagar's mouth is obvious The then German Dragoman, Mirza Husain, was also a person of noto riously evil repute who cannot be regarded as a trustworthy witness He has since been exposed and dismissed from employment in the German Consulate. All the arguments under this count are thus based on an incorrect quota tion. (26) This interpretation is evidently which would he incompatible with the open door.—It maybe a matter oi opinion whether the theory, thatArtjcle 3 of the Treaty of 6th Ma,rcn 1892 precludes tne ,-r raIi t of a mining concession to a foreigner, is compatible with the pnnciple of the open door, but that question hardly arises here because at the tjme when Shaikh Sagar addressed his letter of 11th October 1902 to Colonel Kemball the omy warning 'he had received on the subject was that contained in Colonel Meade's letter to the Residency Agent, Shargah, dated 17th February 19 JO, in which the former wrote^ , '' You should inform the Trucial Chiefs separately that the Resident would be readv to help them with advice in respect to any proposals made to them for tr? rime privileges, such as mining concessions, etc. In doing so you would, of course mSI it cleL to the chiefs that the Resident m '&lt;&gt; desire .to interfere, but H would be to their advantage to obtain advice before concluding arrange- mente te molopoUes and exclusive privileges, thereby ptotectag thenseta against unscrupulous traders.' . , ai , The whole object of this advice was to protect these unsophisticated fehaikhg against all unscrupulous persons anxious to ReSc/ Sro British or Foreign, by urging them always to-consult the Residency betora futerteiBiBS applications for concessions. _ _ ' It is true that later on {vide Foreign Department No. 3177rB.B., dated 27th Aueiist 1907) I was instructed to ■' warn the Trucial Chiefs that the grant of a concession of any sort to mine or otherwise exploit any portion of their terntory 's f'&lt;-nsidered to fall within the scope of this clause, but wuh the approval of tJ {'o'-ernment of India, the Shaikhs were not formally notified to that eftect for the time be^ and action, pending the settlement of this case, was limited ; o a reminder 'to the Shaikhs by the Residency Agent not to entertain applications from outsiders for mining rights without consulting the Residency. 1' or exp a- nation of Shaikh Sagar's letter see under item 12. (27) A little over that amount. -The word ' little J has been interpolated, Jn tfee Arabic jt ziyadeh,' i.e., ■' and oyer or ana jnore,9 (28) Now if the revenue of an island wa Shaikh not have been natural to give him that of the i Abu Musa ?—The s'atus of Sir Abu Nuair and. Abu Musa islands in relation to the Ruling Shaikh of Shargah were precisely the same. The simple reason why Shaikh Sagar did not at that time intimate the grant of the revenue of Abu Musa to Salim in li 3u of a cash payment, was that that island then brought in no specific revenue. The fact was that the interest which Salim had taken in the place as Ruling Chief {e.g., Annex 1) and the money he spent in endeavouring to cultivate it had all come to nothing, by reason of the failure of the water-supply. Thus address ing the Resident on 9th Zilkhadeh 1297 (14th October 1880) the Residency Agent wrote that according to what he had heard from the Ruler of Shargah (then Shaikh Salim) regarding Abu Musa—' Its water has altogether become salt and the trees have died away. He does not get anything from the place, not even a gaz (small copper coin) '. So the reason why the income of Abu Musa was not mentioned is obvious (see also item 35). (29) Salim has always exercised th — These petty potentates of the Gulf littoral do not concern themselves with abstract attributes of sovereignty, and in tracts where no postal of telegraphic^ com munications exist and effective administrative control, according to our ideas, is lacking, practice is necessarily conflicting with theory. The right to jetsam and flotsam is exercised on the basis ofmight is right. The local inhabitants exact it when they can, and the Shaikh of the principality levies or foregoes his royalty as his inclination and ability may dictate. Abundant testimony to this effect is forthcoming. The cases connected with the island of Abu Musa quoted in the German argu ment were never reported to the Residency, as an amicable solution was arrived at locally. I have no reason to doubt the facts, but may mention in connection with the first case quoted, and German Annex No. 6, that Salim was at that time acting as Regent, so that he might have been writing as Ruling Shaikh. He admittedly shared the proceeds of wreckage with the inhabitants of the sland for the time being, migrants from the Shargah suburb of Khan for the most part and thus full subjects of the Ruling Shaikh of Shargah, but he exercised this right in virtue of the dispensation from Sagar which permitted him to enjoy the produce of the island, vide Shaikh Sagar's statement in Annex 2. As far as the Resi dency is concerned we have always, as a matter of course, recognized the posi tion of the Ruling Shaikh in the matter. Thus, on the 17th May 1894, the Residency Agent, Shargah, reported the wreck of a Bahrain boat on Abu Musa and its detention by the inhabitants thereof, pending payment of half the value (Annex 3). It will be seen that it was ^ the Shaikh 0 of Shargah' that the Chief of Bahrain proceeded to entreat, and ' the Sheikh of Shargah J ' whom the Residency recognized (Annexes 4 and 5). Again in the case of the stranding of the British India Steam Naviga tion Comoany's S. S. Balimha on the island (Annex 6) it is dearly the ' Shaikh of Shargah ' whose position and responsibility were recognized. As a matter of fact, under Article 4 of the Treaty of the 6th February 1806 with Shaikh Sultan bin Sagar, father of Salim, and grandfather, of Sagar, the Jowasim are not entitled to exercise their right in the case ot British crau., but m practice the incident has usually happened and has been adjusted by local understanding before any news oi'it has transpired. On the general question of the incidence of the right, and the position and practice in regard thereto, I offer the following evidence (i) Copy of a letter, dated 1st March 1905, addressed by me to the Assis- x tant Resident, Bunder Abbas, in 'reply to an enquiry on the subject (Annex 7).

It will be remarked that the draft was written by Abdullah bin Hasan Samaiyeh. It was all very well for Abdullah cunningly to put such words into Shaikh Salim's mouth, but Salim knew well enough that he was not in a position to make such a pronouncement and the draft was rejected specifically on that account. Directly Abdul Latif saw it, he said that it would not do and wrote out an amended draft omitting the objectionable words. Until .1 showed it to him a few weeks ago. Shaikh Sagar had never seen or heard of it. The cautious Abdul Latif also realized that the admission of Nakhoda Ali into the original agreement with the Shaikh, which would have to be reported to the Residency, was inexpedient as he had a bad reputation and was disapproved of by the Residency, and his inclusion would probably be objected to. ' i His name was, therefore, omitted from the original agreement, and it was decided to bring him in on a subsidiary agreement between the partners se. (It is very evident from all that has transpired how very much these two ignorant Arab Shaikhs were in the hands of the more sophisticated people witlf whom they were dfel^ng and how very necessary it is for us to look after their interests in such matters). ♦These are the mote important.11 (31) In the document of 19th Avgmt 1898 * * * o, Q a, .mvKSLd'r'.il 01 Shaik !' 88gar ' f teri '8 ,tis e01ni Qercial coRceru as a private mdividual, on the same terms as the others, to share the Davmen^ if w/Tt- H ® W0,lId naturall y have been debited with this share even if he had been taking the rent himself.

(32) On 26th December 1898 * * * * % leased all the deposits of mica on Abu Mwa.—Regarding this mica concession see fonaikh bagar a observations (Annex 2). (I may mention, for the informa- tion of Government, that the Residency Agent, Abdul Latif, made no report wliatever of it, either at the time of its execution or at any other time - and durins the progress of, and discussions regarding, 1 his case he can only be regarded as having designedly suppressed all mention of it. His excuse 'that the pro ject fizzled out and that he consequently did not think it worth reporting, cannot be taken seriously.) So far as Shf.ikh Sagar is concerned I have no doubt that the concession never having been taken up, and a decade having elapsed since it died a natural death, he hp,d really forgotten all about it in 1908. This is not at all surprising with such jrfeckless people as these Shaikhs, who keep no records and live in the present. J I believe the history of the so-called ' mica ' project is this. The captain of one of Messrs. Strick's steamers which took a consignment of oxide from A bu Mm a, mistook some thin strata of gypsum, which is common on the island, for mica, tolo. the oxide concessionaires that it was valuable and advised them to get a contract for it. It proved not to be mica. I think we should relv in regard to this item, on the lines given in Shaikh Sagar's explanation, namely, that he was fully consulted and accorded his concurrence ; he having admittedlv allowed Shaikh Salim conditionally and within reasonable limits, to enjoy the oro- duce of the island, and being glad that he should derive sufficient therefrom to allow him no excuse for importuning his nephew for money. ^33) O71 6th JaTiuaTy 1899 \23Td Shaa 1J16) Sammyeh the draft of a memorandum of Asso oxide and the mica mines. —The Memorandum of Association as given in Annex 14 of the German Rejoinder is not the one which accompanied Abdul Latif s letter of 23rd Shaaban 1316 to Hasan Samaiyeh, but a modified version which Abdul Latif never accepled. It will be noted that no signatures are given on the Annex in question, for the reason that the document was never signed up, and the Memorandum was never accepted nor became operative. For further details on the subject of this Memorandum of Association, see Abdul Latifs statement (Annex 12) and item 50 of this report. All the original documents are in my possession. (34) In the document relative to the mica importance to the effect that the lessees and t Keshkeshuh trees but no other trees. This provision island as ovmer. —The Keshkeshuh is a desert shrub used for burning. Fire wood is a great difficulty on these barren islands, and if no express stipulation had been made there would have been a danger of the concessionaries' coolies indenting on the date palms or other garden trees which Salim had tried to grow. This stipulation is no evidence that Salim disposed of the island as owner. He was admittedly the tenant and settler and was allowed to enjoy the produce as long as he was allowed to occupy that position.12 (35) Another document which is of imp ownership * * * is the letter ad hy to Hasan Samaiyeh on the 12th Ncfamber a dispute has arisen between Salim andSakar —The explanation of the dispute regarding Sir is a very simple one and disposes of all the arguments which the German Memorandum basis on it. Abdul Latif's note on the subject (Annex 13) explains the positon fully and his explanation is corroborated by papers already filed with the case and is also confirmed by our records. Abdul Latif had no hesitation about Abu Musa, because Sagar had admittedly, in connection with the oxide concession, allowed Salim to enjoy what income he could get out of the island, but in the case of Sir there was no longer such an arrangement. The agreement of 1884 had been revised; and another agreement (1889) executed, in which mention of Sir had been eliminated. So until the two Shaikhs came to an understandng nothing could be done. In effect Salim said to Sagar : ' You gave me the revenue of Sir, because it was supposed to bring in $ 200, but you never made it up to me when it did not; now that there is some chance of getting some income from it you won't let me have it.' Sagar replied to Salim: ' The agreement (1884) under which I let you have the produce of Sir lapsed, and in the existing instrument between us the income of that island is no longer included; meanwhile I have since resigned to you the income of Abu Musa which is quite enough for you, and I am no t prepared to give you that of Sir as well. (36) * * * Three residents their certain knowledge Abu Musa has alwa Salim. —The three residents referred to are:— (i) Abdul Muhsin ibn Ahmed al Mushari. (ii) Abdarrahman ibn Muhammad ibn Kaaim. (Hi) Hamd ibn Khalifa al Uyuni. They are all persons whose opinions would not be of the slightest weight on this point, even if they were bondfiie, but they are all objectionable witnesses. (i) is a petty trader, associated with Hasan Samaiyeh in pearl dealings. His opinion is of no value whatever in regard to the question under reference (see i.lso Annex 14). (ii) formerly French Agent, dismissed from his post as unfit. Has been frequently subject of complaint from Residency in the past and is so at the present time, on account of his still trying to run a under the French flag to which he has no right (see also Annexes 14 and 15). (Hi) was a petty merchant always in a state of bankruptcy and receiving help from Hasan Samaiyeh. He recently died insolvent (see also Annex 14). In refutation of the above, I produce statements (Annexes 8, 9, and 10) to an entirely contrary effect from various and important Arab Shaikhs of the littoral, most of them of the same stock as the Chiefs of the Truc'al Coast. They belong to the category of maritime Arabs who up to comparatively recent years possessed and ruled the littoral on both shores of the Gulf. Their whole history has been bound up with the coast and islands of the Gulf, and their views must necessarily be of the greatest weight. It will be seen that they are unanimous in the opinion that Abu Musa Island is the property of the Ruling Chief of Shargah. (37) * * It cannot he questio of the reigning Shaikh and even as of the usufruct just like an owner et sequitur.—It is admitted that as tenant he enjoyed the usufruct subject to the consent of the reigning Shaikh, but not 'as against 5 ' the latter, except qua private individual and in so far as13 Sagar as Rilling Shaikh consented.

The British Government considered his action war ranted under the circumstances and declined to intervene in behalf of their subj ect. Tne lessees, ana es-peQially AbdulLatif, cess%on) for as long as 'possible ; accordingly stipvlation was omitted in the second agreement—In view of the terms of the first and rejected agreement lu is difficult to maintain the arguments adopted in Clause 2 of our first Memorandum of July 10th, 1908, or avoid the conclusion that the omission of the specified period was made by concessionaires in their own interests. Having regard to the lact that Abdul Latif drafted the agreement in its fma) form and that the right of the concessionaires to use the mines as long as they wished, was provided for in both versions, it can hardly be said that the time-limit was omitted in the second instrument simply to safeguard the lessor's interests. I think the best line for us to take on this point is that it is difficult to gauge the exact motive which prompted the omission, but if it was the one suggested by the German Memorandum, and if the oxide business was then, as they say, considered very profitable, and if it was intended by the lessee to bind the lessors permanently, in return for a nominal rent of £20 per annum, then there was obviously all the more reason for Sagar to put his foot down and cancel the concession and for us to support him in so doing. In omitting this time-limit, the astute concessionaires thoroughly over-reach ed themselves, for it is clear that the abundant testimony of Mullahs and merchants now forthcoming, that even if the lease were not revocable on any other grounds, it was rendered invalid, both in clerical and mercantile law, on account of this very omission of any time-limit. For the rest, the mere fact that Concession No. 1 was rejected, shows that the irrevocability claimed was at any rate only compara tive and not absolute. (40) The question whether assuming that the lease agreement because the lessee has begu appear sufficient to him, Sakar, is one tha —This was a reason or a part reason suggested by His Majesty's Government and not given by the Shaikh himself, but it is a very natural one. He and Shaikh Salim knew no more about the oxide prospects when the concession was granted, than they did about the mica. They were simply exploited by 3 more astute busi ness men. As soon as they came to realize that they had been 'done', they wanted to upset the arrangement, (41) On the question of the. termination been obtained from the leading merchants' important clergy of Lingah,Shargah and —I append a separate note (Annex 14) regarding the identity of the merchants and clergy mentioned in the German Rejoinder, from which it will be seen that the merchants quoted are by no means leading merchants, and that there are good grounds for regarding their testimony with suspicion ; while the clergy are certainly not the ' most important 'nor compare in repute with some of those whose opinions I now produce. (42) All the opinions eome practically * commercial law the lease agreement is valid : lessor —As I have mentioned above the commercial evidence given in the German rejoinder is in my C205 FD '14 opinion impugnable, and in any case entitled to no weight. The German Firm have evidently had recourse to, or introduced to their Consul, not ' leading merchants ' as they suggest or persons whose opinions are of any value, but just a particular clique of individuals in Lingah, who are notoriously hostile to British interests and influence. In refutation of this evidence, I bring forward the opinions of 11 representa tive merchants (Annexes 17 and 18), from difEerent parts of the littoral, all of whom express the view that the lease is invalid according to the Commercial Law of Islam, because it lacks both specification of period and is devoid of any record of the pronunciation of the proposal and acceptance formulae considered to be a necessary feature of such documents. (43) According to religious law the lease * * *. son who discovers or works the mines thereby *. Hasan Samaiyeh or the Company of Lesse right to them, —I submit a quantity of weighty testimony from numerous members of the clergy, including the chief priests of Lingah and Bushire, both Sunni and Shiah (Annexes 19 to 23). They were unanimous in the opinion that the lease agreement is invalid for several specific reasons, :— {i)Non-pronunciation, and record of the usual formula of proposal and acceptance ; (ii) Non-specification of period ; (iii) Non-specification of the amount of profit to be derived by the lessee. It will be seen that two separate questions were put to the clergy (Annexes 19,, ^1 and 23). In the first place ; (A), As to the validity of the document according to Shara Law ; Then afterwards, the invalidity of the document having been admitted. (B) (i) (B) (ii). As to the right of the lessor to cancel it and eject the lessee, and resume the control of his property. The consensus of these opinions entirely supports the view that the lease was invalid and that the lessor of the property is entitled to cancel the lease and resume his property. I would especially point to the opinions recorded by Abdarrahman bin Abdul Ghafoor El Mufti, who has a very high reputation among the inhabitants ■ of the littoral and islands. As regards the clerical contention, relied on in the German rejoinder, that in Islam mines are the common property of all Muhammadans, and that anybody who works them has thereby acquired an indefeasible right to them. The clergy of Islam may continue in the abstract to cherish this ancient and chimerical tenet, which had its origin in the interested aim of the Muhammadan Isjejifrarchy to keep matters concerning mines and the exploitation of minerals in their own ^ control, but no one can pay serious attention to such an exploded claim at the present day, much less contemplate giving effect to it in practice. It seems waste of time to discuss it. The conclusion to be drawn from the opinions now produced is that the lease was bad in law, whether commercial or religious; that Shaikh Sagar or Shaikh Salim (they were both of one mind, so it matters not which) had, the right to cancel it and eject the lessees ; and that it ceased to be operative from the moment it was cancelled. I may record the personal view that the cancellation by a Ruling Shaikh of a concession granted to British subjects is not a matter which we should allow to be decided by a round robin of recorded views, either of merchants or clergy, and that I regard both as mere padding. As, however, the German claimants have had refiourpe to it, we produce similar stuff in refutation. (44) The sale to foreigners is not a brea —No. It was not suggested that the sale of oxide to foreigners was a breach of the agreement, but the grant of a monopoly to a person, not under the control of the Shaikh or ourselves, was', in the opinion of the Shaikh, a breach of the understanding on which the concession was granted.15 B.

AH these Arab rulers, the Sultan of Muscat, ..tie shaikhs of the Trucial Coast, Bahrain, Koweit, etc., administer justice themselves, only referring to the Shera points which obviously concern them. Although the German Government are pleased to consider it surprising, it seems a very natural thing to us, in a case which primarily concerns only the Shaikh and three British subjects, to allow the Shaikh as Ruling Chief to take such measures as he may see fit to regulate the matter, with what we consider is due regard to the interests of our subjects. But he has not given a judicial decision as between the partners {vide items 48 and 66). (4;i) liassan Samaiyeh resides not in and therefore in the judicial district of the at bringing forward this argument the German Government renew the attempt which they made before to bring the dispute away from the jurisdiction of the Govern ment of India and the Resident in the Persian Gulf, into the sphere of the Con sulate-General at Bushire and His Majesty's Legation at Tehran. The point is an important one, and it is very necessary for us to maintain our present attitude in regard to it. The actual document was executed at Shargah and the partial reason for the inclusion of Esa bin Abdul Latif in the concession was in order that one of the concessionaires might reside at his headquarters and so be in touch with the Shaikh. It is a pure accident that the Samaiyehs, who are of Bahrain origin, happen to live at Lingah. They might equally well be residing at Bahrain or Koweit, Abu Musa appertains not to Lingah or Persia, but to the Trucial Coast and to the jurisdiction of the British representative at Bushire in his capacity of political officer accredited by the ^Government of India to the Shaikhs and principalities of the Arab Coast and islands of the Gulf. As I urged in piy note of February 12th, 1910, as long as we deal with the mat ter as one concerning the Government of India's Residency jurisdiction, we are in a much stronger position to lay down what the Shaikh, who is a law unto himself, can do and can be permitted to do. I may mention that in the case of a current claim on the part of Hasan Samaiyeh for compensation for loss of gear alleged to have disappeared from Abu Musa, I was careful, when hold ing the enquiry, to take all the parties over to Abu Musa and make the investigation there in the presence of the Shr.ikhof Shargah's representative. (48) It' stvl remains to consider the cancelling of the lease agreement and withdrawal itsdf admissible. —This is a question concerning the Shaikh and the British authorities only. The British Government hold that the Shaikh's action was fully justified by the circumstances. The Shaikh and the Government of India were prevented from going further and making any adjustment between the three concessionaires tl inter se by the ill-advised aefaon of two of them in attempting to drag in the German ' fkm and Government. When the matter is allowed to take its natural course, it- may be possible to regulate matters as between the concessionaires. The legality of Hasan's action was a matter for the Shaikh and the Govern ment of India to decide. If Messrs. Wonckhaus' commercial interests were preju, diced by Hasan's action, it was for him to seek commercial relief in the usual way16 This argument has all been stated before, and it seems superfluous for me to go over the ground again. (49)** The {British) memorandum starts aiyeh's proceedings were culpable. —Yes this is so. The German quotation, which follows, of the argument of the British memorandum is not quite a correct one. The argument of the British memorandum was that ' there is nothing in the docu ments in possession of His Majesty's Government to indicate that Hasan Samaiyeh occupied the post of the managing partner and that there was every reason to be lieve that in any case any authority he had did not extend to the grant of such a contract as this (which tied the hands of the Company for an indefinite period) without first consulting the partners, (50) The Imperial Government, however, of fact, sanction the agreement between Hasan tion was not really necessary as Hasan Samaiyeh —Ous reply to this has been (i) that Hasan is proved to have deliberately misled the part ners as to the nature of the contract and withheld the text from them, and (ii) that their sanction was necessary. Hasan had nothing else to work on by way of authority than the condition laid down in the document admitting Nakhoda Ali to partnership (Enclosure 2 to First- German Memorandum). It is shown in item 33, that the Memorandum of Asso ciation (Annex 14 of German rejoinder), was never signed up and never be came operative, and that the concern was being worked on the conditions prescribed in Enclosure 2 above mentioned. Furthermore, it will be noted that Hasan Samaiyeh never attempted to contend that he was under no obligation to consult the partners, but that he had consulted them and that they had approved—the fact being that when communicating with them he had deliberately withheld the text and the important feature in the contract to which he knew perfectly well they would object. His letters to Nejef (Annexes 24 to 27} show clearly that on ordinary occasions he did ieel under the obligation to consult the partners, and that Nejef demurred to his failure to do so in this case. (51)**^ It is disputed that Nejef was a far** connected with personal services and, therefore en d,—This conclusion is not demonstrated by the documents, quoted.

(53V* He (Neief )saidto Abdullah, son of Tkaaennan of the Imperial Vice-Cemsuhteat aaree-ment with Wonckhaus, (vide also the note to tins passage).—Reliance can iiiither be placed on the statements of Abdullah bin Hasan nor on those of -he then Dr^-oman of the Imperial German Vice-Consulate (since dismissed).

It proves of considerable importance and shows that his position nke .hat of ISakhoda All, was one of absolute equality among the partners se. {■55) No doubt HasanSamaiyeh ought agreement was vn German. —After making; this casual observation the German rejoinder goes on to endeavour to explain away or belittle Hasan Samaiyeh's tactics m concealing the text of the contract from the knowledge of his partners. They were demonsttated sufficiently clearly in the summary of Hasan's correspondence submitted by me with the material for our first Memorandum on 1st March 1908. and under item 7 of that Memorandum. There can be no doubt of Hasan Samai yeh s sustained endeavours, all through, to suppress the plain fact of the mono poly or so to gloze over it that it would not be noticed. While the German ami- menthere makes out that it was only Malcolm (as a possible rival in his capacity of Stock's Agent) whom Hasan wanted to keep in the dark, it would appear from Hasan's letter to Malcolm, dated October 14th 1906, that it was in reality Abdul Latif from whom he was auxious to conceal the terms of the contract for he wrote to Malcolm ' ' ^ truth it is not my intention that any one should come to know about it except myself and you (Enclosure 14, British Memorandum.) The reasons for his persevetence in withholding from Abdul Latif the precise terms of the contract were obvious. He had been repeatedly warned by Abdul Latif thatj while thete was no Objection to the mere Bale of the stuff to any body, he should not commit himself to any deed or formal contract without consulting him, and he (Hasan) knewSsIl enough that both the execution and the terms of the document in which he had bound himself would be objected to by Abdul Latif directly he saw them. To discount this opposition from Abdul Latif, his obvious Course was to postpone the deliver}? of the copy and the objections of Abdul Latif as long as possible, so that he could then plead that the contract had been in opera tion now to such an extent that it was impossible to go back on it. This is ptecise- ly the line he took. Thus, writing to Malcolm on 9th May 1907, he said : A long period has elapsed since I made the contract with the German, and I have been engaged in doing the work, our labourers have been working there and heavy ex penses have been incurred * * * They did not make any objection all the time ' ! That the execution of such an instrument was incompatible with Abdul Latif's repeated injunctions and Hasan's own protestations is clearly demonstrated by the correspondence submitted on 1st March 1908. Among the latter I would ! C205 FD18 point to Hasan's letters of 30tli January 1905 and 5tli July 1906, whicli did not form enclosures to the previous memorandum presented to the German Govern ment. (56) He (Malcolm) further expressly ' hiahef price we shall not get the former Agree Mr. Malcolm dio not favour me with a copy of this letter, and the line of_ argument ot persuasion used therein is unfortunate, but it will be noted that it was written in rdjBy to Hasan's letter to him, dated 14th Octobet 1906 (Enclosure No. 14 of British Memorandum), and after Malcolm's communications to me on the subiect of Hasan's intrigues with the German firm and his teiusai to supply a copy of the Contract ('^e his letters to me referred to m Item 54 above). Th a obiect of the missive was simply to allay Hasan's suspicions and induce him to send a copy of the contract, and I suppose Mr. Malcolm worded it in tee terms most likely in his opinion to have the desired result. (57) When Malcolm later on received a ghout it and accordingly acquiesced in it.-lt will be seen from his letter to me that he did not acquiesce, but by the time he got the copy (not till December) I had aho then got one, and he was awaiting informal advice from me asto what actio a he should take. I could give him none, because he had not produced his cieedof part. nership. I think we mi^ht sav that Malcdlm did protest td the Residency, both at the conclusion of the contract without his being consulted and at the refusal of Hasan to supply him with a copy—but that being unable at the, time to find ais deed ot partnership thete was nothing on which he could base a fotmai complaint against Hasan. (58} A? thecofresvondence showsAhdul Neither Abuid Latif nor any one else had any objection to the mete sale of the stufi to Messrs. Wonckhaus.

(62) The Memorandum of Association for the partners.—The answer to the argument® on this point is that the document quoted as Annex 14 of the German Rejoinder is not a completed document and bears no signatures. It was not accepted by Abdul Latif and was never corrrolet- ed or signed up. It has never been seen by Shaikh Sagar, Malcolm or Nejef and has never been quoted or acted upon by any of the parties, and no accounts have ever been rendered By Hasan Ali Samaiyeh as would have been required had it been operative. (Annexes 40 and 42). I appendistat^ement by Abdul Latif on the subject (Annex 12) and would also refer to the statement of Isa bin Abdul Latif, dated 17th Muharram 1326 (20th January 3 908), forming an enclosure to my letter of 1st March 1908. Esa and Abdul Latii have never suggested that Hasan was not the managing part- net for the sale of the oxide ' with the knowledge of all But this deed, which granted a monopoly for a number of years to Wonekhaus, was a new and radical departure from the practice of the past; it was clearly a privi lege, which it was not within Hasan's competence to grant without consulting his partners, and by his tactics in endeavouring to keep the terms of the document se cret from his pattners, Hasan showed that he knew very well that he had acted ultra vires, and that they would object as soon as they understood the effect of the document. The ground fot Esa's action was {vid his letter of 20th February 1907 to Shaikh Sagar) that 'Hasan Samaiyeh has no deed of authority from me, giving him any general power in regard to the action which he might take respectins the lease, etc.' Nor had he. His conduct of affairs, e. his refusal to render any accounts, his inclination to ignore his partners and his readiness to buy up their shares, warrant the conjecture adumbrated by Nakhoda Ali (Annexes 36 to 39) that his aim was to tire out, ot to buy out, the others, and get the concern into his own hands. (63) * * He, Malcolm, ccmld not do anything althcyugh he tvas a 'because anindividlgfiil partner had no rigM * ♦ it stated more distmctly that Hasan Samaiyeh is the partner. attach a copy of an affidavit made by Mr. Malcolm which explains his attitude towards the concern and towards Hasan Samaiyeh. It is clear that he did, in practice, treat Hasan as managing partner, up to a cenain po : nt (Annex 40). In this regard, generally, I would observe that the British Memorandum said no more than that there were no documents in their possession to indicate that Hasan was managing partner. Other documents, such as Malcolm's deed of partnership (Annex 33) are now forthcoming, which show that Hasan did act as managing partner for the ordinary sale of oxide ' with the knowledge of all but that does not a^ter the fact that his execution of his exclusive contract with Wohckhaus and the terms of that contract we!ce both uhtTCj^ires.He had no authority to warrant such a step. {64} It appears from the books of the GM andweM.—la. this case it is the more curious that Hasan should have petsistently neglected to furnish any accounts to his partners and should always have put them off with vague promises that he would soon make them up. There is good reason to believe from the reports of the Residency Agent, Lingah , at the time that these nicely-kept accounts were concocted by Abdullah and Brown at Lingah {Enelo* sures to Residency letter No. 909 of 21st March 1908 to India).20 (65) Hasan Samaiyeh v)as acting entirely company he concluded the agreement with Wdnclc}iam.—l{ he thought this and thought they would approve, whefe was the need for secrecy and prevarication ? {66) Accordingly, Esa's complaint was ground for Shaikh Sakar to give any judicial —It is not contended that Shaikh Sagar has given a judicial decision as between the partners. He merely exercised the right which he enjoys, as a law unto him self, in regard to his own territory by cancelling a concession in what he believed to be the interests of the partners and himself. (See also items 46 and 48). As soon as the German Government has ceased endeavouring to drag the matter into the realm of politics, such measures are necessary in order to arrive at an adjustment of interests or claims among the concessionaires, who are all British subjects, will become possible. This is purely a matter concerning the Shaikh and ourselves. (67) 2. Could Shaikh Sakar cancel the interest of the administration of the country? In the first place it is not easy to understand agreement can he regarded as a letting of the mines to M —Stress cannot belaid on the precise bearing of the particular English word used. Remember it is a ques tion of the translation of a vernacular word. In this case it is the word used by Esa, Shaikh Sagar and Abdul Latif in reference to the document passed to Mr. Wonckhaus . The word is ' I jar eh ' ( ) or ' Ijar ' ( ), the latter being merely a contraction of the former. The word has a much more elastic signi fication than our word ' lease It includes' hire '—' rent'—' farm '—' a pri vilege or income of variable amount sold or let for a fixed sum Similarly ' Ijareh- dar ' ( ) in Persian and its equivalent ' Mustajir ' ( ) in Arabic = ' A farmer or renter of land or revenue '—' a lease-holder —' a monopo list '—' a hirer Perhaps ' farm ' would be more appropriate than ' let ' or lease ' in the present case. We are indebted to 1st German Memorandum, Enclosures 6 and 8, for render ing ' lease.' The reason why the persons above-mentioned have applied this terra ' Ijar ' to the instrument in this case and hftve not merely called it a 'contract ' or ' deed of sale ' is plain from theirl letters enclosure 12 of 1st German Memorandum and 17 of British Memorandum, namely that the deed granted a monopoly and left the partners no power of control of the output or modification of the contract. It was thus an ' Ijar '. {68) Sakar's fear that the agreement may mines being gradually lost to the owner * * * the island of Abu Musa from Shargah, is so to discuss it. It is also strange that * * Shaikh SaTcar should wish British sub jeets to treated differently from those of other Powers. —Shaikh Sagar's apprehensions are not so baseless in practice as they seem to be to the German Government in theory. These Arab Shaikhs have no speedy means of communication with their outlying possessions, no men-of-war to cruise and keep an eye on them. As late as 1904 Shaikh Sagar was put to a great deal of anxiety and inconvenience because an over- zealous Belgian Director of Customs, anxious to make history, went over to the Island in a Persian Customs steamer and hauled down his flag, hoisting the Persian flag instead. The British Government, which protects these Shaikhs in regard to their exter nal affairs, speedily took the matter up and had it righted to the Shaikh's satisfac tion, but the incident naturally gave him a fright and made him suspicious. The action of the German firm and German representatives in this case has certainly not been calculated to allay those suspicions. Although in the argu ments adduced in this case they have repeatedly declared that the contract entered21 ' ^verv'l,&lt;-^Won ^ ^ ^ ^ Xl ^ e ^ Hasan, and a purchase of oxide on de- ' us, yet their conduct towards the Shaikh has shown him clearly how readily a very different complexion is introduced into the transaction. ' 7 Thus— (i)On 13th October 1907 Messrs. Wonckhaus wrote to Shaikh Sagar ' We consid-er the mines and the concession for them as a security for the advances paid. If you force Haji Hassan bin Ali Somayah and Co to withdraw their coolies and representative, we shall have to send over some men ourselves to protect our property (Consul Bunder Abbas to Government of India, No. C-47, dated 25th Octo- ber 1907). (ii) On 28th October 1907, Lieutenant Gabriel, Assistant Resident, Bunder Abbas, reported ^ The local representative of Wonckhaus, Mr. Brown, and about 26 men left lor the island on October 22nd. A German flag which he intended to place on the accumulation of oxido was also taken (Consul Bunder Abbas to Government of India, Telegram No. , dated the 28th October 1907). {in) On 19th November 1907 addressing Shaikh Sagar direct, the German Vice-Consul, Bushire, threatened the Shaikh with a claim of a lakh of rupees, and claimed for Messrs. Wonckhaus the right of direct entry (or concern) in the working of the mines. (Residency telegram No, 735 to India and Tehran, dated 13th December (iv) On 16th March 1909 Hasan Samaiyeh, no doubt under adviee from his German supporters, wrote a threatening letter to Shaikh Sagar in which he said:— ' All the oxide mines which are on the Abu Musa belong to us and our Syndicate and are under our control and in our possession (Residency Letter No. 1559, dated 4th July 1909, to India). As regards the apparent differentiation between British subjects and other foreigners, I would explain:— The British Government are as anxious to protect these unsophisticated Arab Shaikhs against unfair exploitation by B subjects just as much as other foreigners, but from the Shaikhs' point of view it is very natural that they should regard British subjects in a different light to other foreigners. They know that British subjects, if not subject to theirown jmisdiction, are subject to that of the British Political authorities with whom they are united by close ties of treaty and obligation. They trust to the British Government to keep their own subjects in hand and give the Shaikhs immunity from worry or imposition. They have no such guarantee in the case of other foreigners, nether under the complete control' of themselves nor of the protecting Power. Even Hasan Samaiyeh, until it suited his book to change his ideas, had strong views on that point and at one time was all against the admission into the concern of any foreigners. (Vide Annex 41 and following item). (69)**. {The Company) was only doing legitimate interests, when it endeavoured to Company, exercise a direct influence on the fortunes of —Apart from what we have ah ready maintained, namely that the concession had already ceased to exist for eight months, when Brown went through a form of purchase of Sh.ikh Sagar's share; and the evident fact (vide enclosure 11 of First German Memorandum and other papers) that when he went into that transaction he had full knowledge of the previous cancellation of the Concession. We now have the text of the deed of p2u5 JT)22 partnership admitting Malcolm (Annex. 33) and the inclusion therein, in Ab dullah bin Hasan's handwriting, of the express condition that ' it is not open to any one of the partners to sell his share or to admit any one therein except in consultation with Haji Hasan bin Ali Samaiyeh and with his signature together with those of the partners.' This again is emphasized in Hasan's letter on the subject to Abdul Lati-f (Annex. 41). It would be quite open to us to argue from this emphatic condition, brought into operation on 13th Shaaban 1316—27th Lecember 1898—that the sale by Shi.ikh Sagar of his share to Yusuf bin Abdullah a month later (17th Raruian 1316—30th January 1899) was invalid because it did not bear the signature of any of the partners—and that the sale* of the same share by Yusuf to Hasan on the 15th Shaaban 1318—8th December 1900,was doubly illegal. In this connection the bearing of the letter of Hasan Samaiyeh to Abdul Latif of 7th January 1900 is particularly important. It will be seen that it was specifically in connection with the Yusuf Abdullah share, then in the mar ket, that Hasan introduced the prohibition against any partner selling his share or admitting an outsider without consulting him and all the partners. He con gratulates Abdul Latif for preventing Yusuf from selling the share to a foreigner, and says we are better entitled to take the share and Notwithstanding this he very soon afterwards bought Yusuf's share himself, and refrained in connection therewith from fulfilling the necessary condition which he himself had made but a few months before. Neither the signature of Esa, nor Malcolnj, nor Nakhoda Ali, was taken on the transfer; and no one heard anything about it until Hasan went somewhat out of his way to inform the Residency Agent, Lingah, of the fact in October 1906, and the latter reported it to me on the 2nd November. (See Annexes 31 and 40). {70) **The Imperial Government for the convinced of the illegality of the eancellvng of —Our reply to this is that the question of the cancelling of the agreement between three British subjects and a Slu-ikh in treaty relation with us is a matter concerning us and him alone, and that the German Government have no locus to pronounce upon it. (72) It was evidently the aim of Shaikh rights enjoyed by Mr, WoncJchaus under supply illusory for the benefit of his competitors. —This is an unfounded assumption. Shaikh Sagar had no ideas of the kind. {72) His proceedings are an infraction tion of which in those regions His Majesty's — On the contrary it was precisely in order to prevent any lawlessness, or any un necessary rough-handling of British subjects that the presence of was ordered.

Prideaux, Officiating Bushtre, {No. 123, dated ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 5»£ S}£ :|- Leaving bi^ree noon o L the 24:tii we anolioxad at Bu Musa by 6 same evening. The Chief of Shargah has found good fresh water, 3 wells close to Bu Musa peak (300 yards east of peak). Wells are 24 feet deep. Several other wells after digging 14 feet had to be abandoned, although they were distant a mile from sea. They had dug through 6 feet fine mud, then a small conglomerate shingle and shell beach followed by more compact lime-stone, bait water came up. Strange that there are some of_ these failures within 400 yards of sweet water. The island is cov ered with a luxuriant grass, in some places a foot high, it is chiefly level land, a few hillocks near the margin of the sea. Chief has sent over 40 mares, and some foals, one horse, eleven camels to give milk for the latter. Horses get two pounds of barley and two pounds of dates daily, are turned adrift at 7 a.m . to go where they like, they come home in the evening and are tied up. There are eleven men with them, they have camel's milk, two pounds of dates daily, one day in seven a feed of rice. As for days of the week they know only when the si n gets up and goes down—what need to know more—and are perfectly happy. In the season they catch a turtle or two, and have a glorious feast. The beach on the sea side of the island was strewn with countless numbers of sea gulls' eggs, hatched by the sun by day, birds sitting on them at night.24 Anjjex (2). Translation of a letter from Shaikh Sugar UnKhaled Shargah, Cox, Political Resident in the Persian 1329=25th March After compliments and enquiries after your health, I beg to address you in regard to your inquiry regarding the undermentioned three points connected with the Abu Musa case. (1) You say that it is claimed that on the i2th Shaaban 1316, after my return from the Hajj, Shaikh Salim granted to three persons an agreement for the extrac tion of Mica from Bu Musa Ishtxd without ar.y permission from me, and you ea- quire from me that if 1 was aware of the same, how was it that I did not mertion this agreement to you on the 19th Moharram 1326, when I presented to you a statement of my relations with Shaikh Salim in regard to the Bu Musa Island, (2) You also mention to me the question of jetsam and flotsam on the Bu Musa Island ai.d state that it is claimed that Shaikh Salim was receiving the in come on this account, and (3) You have -also shown me the translation of a paper which is claimed to be dated the 4th Zilkhadeh 1315 and to be the first draft of the Oxide Contract which was altered to another form on the I8th Zilkhadeh 1315, This is my reply with regard to three points— Firstly —In regard to the Mica Agreement I was fully aware of it and Shaikh Balim consulted me (about it), and it would not have been possible that the said agreement could be issued without coming to my knowledge as Ruling Chief. But as I informed you tw*o years ago, I had left to Shaikh Salim all the income which he could obtain from the aforesaid island, and, consequently, I did not trouble (myself) to object to this (agreement). At the same time, when I presents gd to you the said statement regarding my relations with Shaikh Salim in respect' of Bu Musa, the question of this Mica contract did not occur to my mind at all, for, as you must be aware, the Mica affair produced no result whatever. As regards the sum of $1,500 payable by instalments to Shaikh Salim, I have no information as to how many instalments were received by Shaikh Salim. I did not trouble to make enquiries about the instalments, nor did I demand anything from Shaikh Salim on that account. It was my wish that he should get something from it and that he should not trouble me about his expenses. Secondly —As regards the right to jetsam and flotsam on Bu Musa Island and all the islands of Kowasim, it is not open to doubt that it is due to the Chief of the Kowasim, but the usual custom on the Oman Coast is that the inhabitants of the place exact their rights on the scene of the wreck, and when the Chief comes to know of it he settles the matter according to his own opinion; sometimes he takes his own share from his subjects and sometimes he does not take from them. In the case of Bu Musa, as I had left all the revenue to Shaikh Salim, I treated my right of jatsam and flotsam as a part of the income to go to him and used to ask no questions about it. Thirdly- —With regard to the rejected draft of the Oxide agreement, I have now noted its wording but had neither seen nor heard of it before. The reason for its rejection js obviously because Shaikh Salim could not write about Bu Musa in these terms, namely, 'so long as I, my children and my brothers live, no one is entitled to raise objection to it'. No doubt this was the cause of the draft being changed. This is what was necessary to be stated and, salaams! (L, S.) Sagar bin Khaled bin Sultan,25 Annex. 3. No. 22, dated the 17th May 1894.

A letter reached me from the Residency Agent residing at Bahrain, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Chief of Bahrain regarding a jolly boat belonging to one of Shaikh Isa s subjects, named Mohamed bin Saleh bin Jebara, which strand ed on the Isle of Abu Musa. V our servant endeavoured to release the jolly boat from the hands of the inhabitants of Abu Musa for the sum of $70; at the time Muhammed bin fealeh bin Jebara was present with me, the inhabitants of Abu Musa refused but (would) only accept half (of the value of the boat and cargo) according to custom. Muhammed bin Saleh bin Jebara departed from Bahrain to inform his Chief (and point out) that should he desire to entreat the Chief of Bhargah on account of friendship or (for) other reason (the latter would release it). When the (Bahrain) Agent's letter reached me, I returned an answer according to what had passed on this subject but no reply has come (to it). According to what is noticed by me {i. e.) that the inhabitants of Abu Musa voyage in the jolly boat and convey cargo, it has become necessary to inform you, as probably that an accident may befall the boat. It is better that the owners of the jolly boat should strive to release the boat. Bahrain Agent's letter, a copy of the Chief of Bahrain's letter are enclosed. C205 FD26 Annex. 4.

I beg to state that the Chief Officer of the British India Steam Navigation Com- pany 5 s S.S. Bulimba came tome on the 1st April 1907, reporting that the steamer had stranded on the Bu Musa island and asking me to notify the Shargah merchants to send lighters to Bu Musa for the purpose of landing the cargoes they had on board her. I notified the merchants accordingly. The officer then proceeded to to meet the Ship's Agent, Muhammed bin Ibrahim, and arrange for the despatch of lighters to Bu Musa. I was informed by the Officer that the islanders nad not agreed to render the vessel any assistance unless they received half tne cargo. The Agent, Muhammed Ibrahim, having asked, me for assistance to be rendeied to the steamer, I sent with him my brother, Maaraj bin Abdul Kaman to Bu JLuaa lest the islands may do something irregular towards the ship's crew ^ and the cargo, which it may be desirable to discharge on the island in order to launch the vessel. A took likewise a letter from the Chief of Shargah to the islanders ordering them to refrain from raising objections against the ship's crew, and to give them such help as they can. However, by God's grace and the Company s good fortune, the sea remained calm and waveless. while the vessel was stranded untt. arrangemen were made for launching her. According to Maaraj s report to me • ' Highflyer had visited Bu Musa just as the stranded vessel was being launched.

Aoie by Khad Bahadur Abdul Latif, giving history of the rejected preliminary draft of the oxide concession and explaining the reason of its rejection, {Dated 25th March 1911,) W ith reference to tlie translation wliieli you have shown to me of what purports to be rejected preliminary draft, dated 6th April 1898, of the oxide concession executed on the 10th April 1898,1 beg to make the following observations :— I note that tne document purports to be signed by (i) Hasan bin Ahmed and (it) Ali Ahmed Saleh. H asan lo ^ n Ahmed mentioned was a retainer of Shaikh Salim. Ali Ahmed Baleh is the man whose identity you know as Nakhuda Ali. I had nothing to do with the writing or drafting of this document. I remember that I had been absent on duty at Bushire during the spring of the year in question and it was on my return to Shargah that the project for an oxide concession was discussed. The draft had been drawn up by Abdullah bin Hasan Samaiyeh and it was he who showed it to me. At the same time he and Nakhuda Ali, who v/as also there, asked me to let my son Isa come into the concern as they, needed some one on the spot at Shargah in order to keep in touch with Shaikhs Sagar and Salim s I agreed, but pointed out that the terms of the proposed concession as at present drafted were quite impossible, and that neither Shaikh Sagar would confirm it nor would the Government approve it. What I especially objected to was (1) the sentence in which Shaikh Salim is made to say so long as I, my children and my brothers live, no one will be entitled to raise objection to itand (2) the inclusion of Nakhuda Ali as a signatory on the document. With regard to (1), I would explain that Salim was an old man of T 70 ? who might be expected to die at any time, and I was taking into account the fact that if he died, we should thenceforth have to deal with Shaikh Sagar. As regards {2) I thought the inclusion of Nakhuda Ali w^as inexpedient, as I had just been visiting Bushire and knew him to be in very bad odour with the Residency in connection with his Bushire affairs and he was also at loggerheads with the w T ell- known Moin-et-Tujjar of Tehran, holder of the Hormuz Concession, and I feared the latter would be likely to give us trouble if he came to know that Nakhuda Ali was a partner in a rival oxide enterprise. I also omitted the 20 years time limit, as I saw no object in inserting any fixed period of time. C205 FD (Sd.) ABDUL LATIF BIN ABDURRAHMAN,34 A nnex (12).

The latter made certain additions and had five documents drawn up including the additions and signed by himself, Abdullah and Nakhuda Ali, and he forwarded them all to me for completion by the attachment of the signatures of Shaikh Sagar and myself. When completed, I was to return three of them to him, one for himself, one for Abdullah, and one for Nakhuda Ali. Of the remaining two I was to give one to Shaikh Sagar and keep one myself. 1 dia not, however, care about the extra condition which he had inserted and wrote back and said so. There the matter ended. These deeds were never completed nor were any revised documents drawn up. I never showed them to Shaikh Sagar and produce them now in the state in which I received them. These rules never having become operative Esa and I always considered and presumed that the document on which the concern was carried on was that of Zilhijieh 1315, in which Isakhuda Ali was admitted to partnership and in which it is laid down that the sale, loading and shipping should be carried out with the knowledge of all the partners. By reason of Hasan's neglect to consult us properly and his failure to render any accounts, we became dissatisfied with his conduct of affairs.35 Annex (13).

VJ ' res fr em me to wliat I referred in my letter dated 27th Jamacii 11, 1316 ; * wlien I wrote the following sentence:-— . Q As^regards Sir, a dispute has arisen between Shaikhs Sagar and Salim. It is bagar s intention to lease without mentioning Salim's name and to give some advantage to Salim, but Salim would not agree to this.^ me explanation of the above passage is as follows i q remembered that in the second agreement between Shaikh Sagar ana bhaikh Salim (dated 1884) at which my predecessor was the intermediary, Shaikh Sagar granted to Shaikh Salim an annual pension of 400 dollars together with the revenue of Sir Bu Nuair. which was expected to bring in some 200.f Lp to 1889, however, this island did not produce any revenue as was expected and consequently no mention was made of it in the third agreement dated 5th Shaaban 1306 (1889) and Shaikh Salim ceased to take any interest in it. When, however, it became probable that the island might produce some revenue as the result of the concession alluded to in my letter to Hasan Samaiyeh now under reference, Shaikh Salim/s interest was naturally revived and he wanted to claim the revenue under the ob^ete agreement of 1884, which Shaikh Sagar was alto gether unwilling to agree to on the ground that under the last agreement (1889) which was now in force the revenue of Sir Bu Nuair Island was not an item of the settlement. The Shaikhs failed to come to an understanding on this point, with the result that the project for the concession fell through. This is what had to be represented. (Sd.)

I have quite recently had to complain against him under the Hague Award in the French Flag arbitration, for unlawfully flying a French flag, he having got himself registered at Muscat.

I addressed the Government of India in my letter No. 1559, dated the 4th July 1909, of which 1 append an extract. In spite of the action taken against him, Muhammad Abdulla has not ceased to intrigue by using the sp irious seal and endeavouring to fly a Turkish flag. He has been able specifically to give us trouble by attempt ing to treat Arab visitors from Muscat, Trucial Coast, Bahrain and Koweit as Turk ish subjects and thrust upon them Turkish passports or and it has only been by the vigilance of oar Agent at Lingah and continual pressure on the local Persian authorities by the Residency that Mahammad Abdulla has been prevented from achieving much practical success.

Enclosure to Annex (14), Extract from a letter from the Political Resi ^ecretaiy to tae Irovemmetit of India in the Foreign DevaTttnent. Calcutta, (No, 1559, dated the 4th July 1909). Our Agent at Lipgah has for years past experienced a great deal of trouble from the vagaries and intrigues of a Persian named Muhammad Abdulla, who though carrying no commission and though the Tehran Government have refused to agree to his appointment, has nevertheless managed, by flying a Turkish flaa and using a spurious rubber seal, to pose as a Turkish Consular official and, under this guise, to make difficulties for our Agent by encouraging visitors from Oman or Bahrain to accept his protection, and in other ways. We have repeatedlv com- piained to the Governor of the Gulf ports of the conduct of this Persian and also to His Majesty's Legation. \\ hile Muhammad Abdulla has always been repudiated he has never been suppressed, until last year when the Darya Begi in pursuance of orders received from Tehran took the- opportunity afforded by a personal visit to Lingah to have Muhammad Abdulla's flagstaff removed. Soon after this incident, the Wali of Busrah, who properly speaking would appear to have no status to interfere in affairs on the Persian coast, sent a representative down to Lingah whom Muhammad Abdulla took steps to cram with garbled stories of his ill-treat ment by the Darya Begi, and this has now resulted in a complaint against the Darya Begi by the Turkish Legation and a demand that the Governor of the Gulf porta should give satisfaction. A telegram recently received by His Excellency from the Persian Foreign Minister quotes Hasan Samaiyeh as being one of the persons who had furnished statements on which the Turkish demand for satisfaction from the Darya Begi was based. The other two persons who are quoted by name are also individuals with pronounced anti-English proclivities, one of whom has lately been removed from the post of French Consular Agent which he formerly held.40 A nnex (17) Question A As put to the members of th In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate.

(L. S.) Confident in God the bounteous. His slave Muhammad Ali bin Muhammad TaqL [Note .—Imam Juma, the official High Priest of Bushire.] (Hi) In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate. Amongst the conditions for the validity of a lease are the specifications and record of the period of the lease. Supposing for instance he were to say ' I have let the house at the rate of one Toman per mensem,' such a lease is le^gally null and f void and if the lessee says a prayer in such a house the prayer will be futile. And as to this question there* is no difference of opinion between the distinguished Ulemas, and God is aware of His precepts. Written by the Humble Muhammad Ali el Moosevi ed Dehdashty en NejafL (L. S.) The hopeful Muhammad Ali-el-Moosevu [Note .—The most venerable Shia Mullah in Bushire.] {iv) It should be understood that the conditions for the validity of a lease are six; by the absence of any of which six conditions the lease is null and void. The first (is) the compact, i .e., the proposal and acceptance, intended to indicate the fact of the assumption of the profit for a fixed period in return for something specific. Secondly, the legality of the possession. Thirdly, the taking cognizance of the rent or the measure or weight or number. Fourthly, the specification of the profit , by time or by the job. Fifthly, the retention of the pro it in possession or its coming under that category (of possession). Sixthly, the defining of the period of the lease in such a manner that it shall become neither less nor more. The subject-matter of the question (under reply) being void of certain of the conditions, namely, the compact, and the period and'the cognizance of the amount of the profit, is not valid, and God is aware of the truth of affairs. Written by the humble Abdullah el Moosevi el Baladi (L. S.). [N ote .—The Chief Mullah of the Ussuli sect of Shias in Bushire. His opinions are greatly respected.] (u) In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate. The distinguished Ulemas—may their blessings amongst the people endure— have defined ' lease 'to be the taking possession of an ascertained profit in return for something specific. So whatever is like giving possession of original property, for instance by selling it, is a thing extraneous to a compact of lease, and so is anything in which the profit is not defined, either in itself—such as by the fact of sewing of a certain garment or the riding of a certain animal to a certain place— or by the fixing of a period such as a full year. And thus, as regards the subject of the question, whereas, it is not a case of taking possession of a profit, but of the original property, and whereas the profit is not fixed by either of the two methods aforesaid, the lease is accordingly null and void, on both counts-, and it is obvious that while there is no contradiction in the said two rulings, it is recorded that the majority set store by the last. And God is aware of His commands.45 Kimf ;fS by ' this llUmble semat of tlie Shera Murteza el Moosevi.

' I ' he answer A lease has several conditions, and if a single condi tion (thereof) is violated, the lease becomes invalid, and how it would be now that several conditions have been omitted therefrom. Firstly, it becomes bindin' by a Known period. This has been omitted however. Secondly, a lease becomes binding oy proposal and acceptance. Should these conditions be absent the lease is null and void, and when the lease is nullified it is for the lessor to take possession of his property and to lease it to another ; and God knows best.

(Signed and sealed.) Abdul Karim, servant of the Shera Law at Qais. (ix). The answer. Praise be to God, Who leads to the right! This lease, as it is mentioned in the question, is not in accord with the precepts of the xiugust Shera and is null and void and invalid. So, the owner of the property has the. option to return to his property and he has the absolute possession thereof and can use his property in any manner that he may wish. He* has the option (to do so), and the lessee has no right or title in that property. And whatever is invalid according to the August Shera is to be considered as non-existent. Should the proprietor desire to turn out the lessee frooi that place, he can do so, and there is nothing to bind the owner of the place. And God knows more, (Signed and sealed.)

Perhaps the cause whicli prevented it is good. I am always receiving letters trom my father Hasan who gives me the news of your health. You should, God willing, inform me of your health and the news of your side by every mail. 0 my brother, I beg to advise you in connection with the dispute which was between us and Sassoon. We have settled with Sassoon and it has been arranged that a compromise should be effected. And we have written papers of compro mise for the settlement of the dispute. And whereas your father was one of the partners and he has now passed away, and whereas you are in Irs place and are his executor, it is necessary that you should give a power-of-attorney from your self in my name so that I may affix, in the documents, your signature with the signatures of the partners which are (recorded) in the documents held by me m the case veTsus Sassoon, as Sassoon knows that Hail An has passed away and that I, Abdullah, was his agent at Calcutta. Now, after Haji Ali's death, it is obvious that you are his executor and it is necessary that you should write a power-of- attorney for me (saying) that I am your agent in Calcutta in all the affairs which may occur in Calcutta as 1 was before in the affairs of your father. For this purpose I have now written a power-of-attorney in English in accord ance with the law which will be accepted by the court; it is a power-of-attorney from you in my name. There is also an affidavit testifying that you are Sejef bin Haji Ali—his executor and attorney and that you are now in his place. This cer tificate together with the power should be taken by yourself to the British Resi dent or Assistant Resident at Bunder Abbas and you should, in his presence, admit that you are the son of Haji Ali and are in your father's place and that you have made this power in the name of Abdullah bin Hasan who is to be your agent in Calcutta as he was before in the lifetime of Haji Ali. Also the Resident or the Assistant Resident should certify in the affidavit that you are Haji Ali's son and his representative. You should also take a writing from the Belgian Director of Customs that you are Haji Ali's son and his representative and obtain another certificate from the Postmaster and expedite sending them to me by registered post soon and without delay, and write on the cover my address in English as follows: A. H. H. Samaiyeh and Company, 34-1, Co Calcutta. You should not delay the power and the documents but send them to me at an early date. I have also advised my father Hasan who will also let you know and urge upon you. I know that at the moment of their arrival, you will expedite sending them on. I have written you this by post and I now intend going to the solicitors so that I may write the power and the affidavit and send them to you by registered post. I need not urge you further that you should expedite doing what I have advised you. This is what was necessary. The letter was written most hastily.

Affidavit ofNejef binNakhuda Nejef bin Haji Nakliuda Ali states on solemn affirmation I solemnly declare the following to be the facts regarding my interviews with Mr. Thomas Brown of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company and it ^ss^xy 1 am prepared to confirm this statement by oath (A the Koran before a Mujtalud. I have had several conversations about the Abu Musa case with parties inter ested. The first was when Abdullah bin Hasan Samaiyeh came to see me accom- panied by Mirza Hussein (jermani . ♦ The Dragoman of the German Consulate, came to Blinder Abbas and stayed in the house of Haji Amin-ut-Tujjar. Abdullah on landing from the ship came to my house and asked me to come over and have a talk about the matter at x:»ajj Amm s house. I went over to Haji Amin's house and there Mirza Hussein. Abduila and Haji Ali *' Germani 'j were present, t Factotum of the firm in Lingah. Abdullah asked me to give him a paper stat ing that I handed over my share of the concession on Abu Musa to Abdullah bin Hasan. The paper was to be given a date prior to the date of the contract between Messrs. Wonckhaus and Hasan. He also asked me to give him another paper saying that I was quite satisfied with the contract. I refused saying that I would not do anything of the sort unless they settled up my account with David Sassoon, that is my father's on account of Oxide, carpets, etc. I said if they did not give me back the carpets they should pay me 20,000 (twenty thousand) rupees and settle mv account and then I would give them the &lt; aper. However, they did not give me the money and I mentioned the matter to the British Consulate. These two persons came to Bunder Abbas not long after the British Consul Lieutenant Gabriel returned there from a trip he made to Shargah, etc. Some months later Mr. Brown came to Bunder Abbas. The exact date can be ascertained from the Consul, Bunder Abbas, as I reported the matter to him at the time, but it was just about two years ago. Mr. Brown had two interviews with me-once at the house of Jamshidian's ; .gent and once at the Customs house. At the first interview Agha Ohulam Ali Khorassani was present, at the second Mr. Moses Khan, the Customs Director. Agha Ghulam Ali is i .gent of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company. Mr. Brown had a long talk with me. Before beginning to talk about Abu Musa he dis missed two Hindus, Gulshan and Asanand Ghulab. Mr. Brown asked me why 1 had not signed the papers shown me by Abdullah and Mirza Hussein. I said there appeared to be no advantage for me in doing so, and therefore I hadn't. Mr. Brown said he had bought the share in the Oxide Company belonging to Shiikh Sagar for Reals 250. I replied that Shaikh Sagar had never made anything out of the business and so would sell cheap. Mr. Brown said he wanted to buy my share and said that he would settle up all my accounts with Hasan bin Ali and Abdullah. I never offered to sell my share to Mr. Brown. In fact as I reported to the Consul '.te at the time Mr. Brown offered to buy my share. I would swear to his on the Koran. This took place in the presence of Agha Ghulam Ali Khoras sani. At the second interview and after Mr. Moses Khan tried to persuade me to go to Lingah to settle with Mr. Brown. He continued to endeavour to make me do this for a long time and on my refusing he got annoyed with me and worried me to such an extent that I finally had to resign my post as Hamal Bashi at Bunder Abbas.

It is not hidden from your Honour that I received my education in the Gulf, and that I am not an expert in the niceties of grammar and the shades of meaning various measures of words.

His precise words were: * It will be seen that he here used and not , It is clear, therefore, that Hasan understood me fully in the sense I intended to convey. Secondly, the explanation of the use of the spelling is as follows in my opinion:— It is rendering into writing of a colloquial construction of speech. Thus in conversation, if referring to a masculine object, such as Zaid, I should not say _ _ but leaving out theZamah ' after the h ' but substituting the ' Zamah for ' Kasrah ' after the' t'. Similarly if I were re ferring to a feminine object I should not say but substituting the 'Kasrah' after the 't' for the feminine pronoun 'ha'. Likewise, in writing a colloquial letter I should render the above sounds into writing. The word or is constantly used, in my parlance in reference to a thing in the sense of It is also evident from Hasan Samaiyeh's reply above quoted that he uses it in this sense:— (Better than its acceptance, e., better than the acceptance of the con tract).

LeUer from the Revd. S. M.Zwemer of t Church in ike Persian Gulf, to Lieutenant-Colonol {Dated Bahrain, March With, reference to the meaning of the Arabic sentence and the probable intention of the writer in using those words concerning which point you asked my • opinion, I take pleasure in replying as follows:— First, it is evident that whoever wrote the sentence was not a thorough scholar in Arabic, as he confused the masculine and feminine forms in the last word of the sentence. To my mind the obvious translation of the phrase is, ' the annulment of this agreement is better than it acceptance/' I do not think it is at all obvious or possible to translate the sentence ' the annulment of this agreement is better than to comply with (his wishes)'. This translation is, to my mind, a forced one, and not the natural significance, of the words in question, whatever be their connection. I am confirmed in this opinion after consulting with one or two Arabs concerning the popular use of the pronoun in such a sentence, and I find that they agree with me that there is a great looseness in the use of the feminine or masculine pronoun at the close of a clause or sentence. 1 am sure that nine out of ten Arabs would give the preference to the former translation of the sentence as the obvious and natural intention of the writer.

Your letter which was forwarded by the regular mail has been received and noted, I wrote a reply thereto and sent it in the S. S. King Arthur through Zair Hasan, for delivery to you, and I hope that you have received it. As regards what you have written about Khadheiri and the firm of Hotz, no reply has been received up to now. It is a long time that no letter has been received from Khadheiri, and when I saw that no letter came from him I also did not write to him. The same happened in the case of Hotz's firm. God is gene rous. At last the matter will not remain as it is. God will find a way. I am now in communication with a Hindu (who wishes) to purchase (the oxide) at Bombay at 6 rupees per Gindi; and we offer it at rupees 7 to be delivered at the Bombay harbour, the Customs duty and warehouse fee to be paid by the Hindu himself. He wants 2,000 Gindis and wishes to make a contract, afterwards, for India. If he contracted 4,000 tons per annum for India at lis. 7 per Gindi to be delivered in the Bombay harbour, Haji Hasan will agree. Let me see what happens. I will let you know. This price for which he buys means that the bag and freight to Bombay should be payable by us. If the bags are new, they will cost Rs. 12 per 100 and if they are old they cost Rs. 6 per 100. Old and new should be mixed, so that the oxide may duly reach Bombay, It should be weighed in the steamer. May God wish that these terms should be agreed upon. If Abdullah does not spoil (the matter) it will be good. He (Haji Hasan) has intimated to Abdullah, but has written that he (Abdullah) should not speak about it but should intimate if it is not detrimental to his Calcutta oxide market. Let us see what reply is re ceived from Abdullah. We have also given a draft for Rs. 1,000 so that new bags may be purchased. I stated (the above) for your information so that you may be aware that the affairs have not progressed up to now. It was all due to themselves. Wherever the matter is arranged, Abdullah will at last spoil it. As to the matter of Khadheiri and the firm of Hotz, I know he (Abdullah) has written something, owing to which they will not write any letters hereafter. Greetings !67 A nnex 38.

As regards the Sir Island, if you can make arrangements with, some one in Calcutta besides the firm of Sassoon, it will, in my opinion, be better. No one will then raise any claim in Calcutta and the claimant's statement will not be listened to. There are many words which cannot be written. The circumstances in con nection with the Calcutta oxide are all due to the London firm, because one year ago they rumoured at Lingah that we are no longer able to work the oxide in the Bin Musa Island; and it was written from London that they should spend as much as they can and take the Island out of our hands. In my opinion, an opportunity has now been offered to them, because I was myself at Calcutta and a Hindu offer ed to buy all the oxide and the value was also arranged. He also paid Rs. 1,000 and was to pay Rs. 4,000 more and take delivery of the goods. They cancelled it (however) for the sake of one month's respite. So far four months have elapsed and the oxide has remained unsold. Had 1 not been afraid of the Bank, I would have gone myself to Calcutta and disposed of the oxide in any way. When I was at Calcutta there were many buyers. The oxide will now remain (unsold) like a horse in Bombay which will eat so much that it will be lost at length. You will of course say that I knew this from the beginning. The oxide which was shipped has been consigned to Mr. Brady. If you had brought to their office it had to be consigned to them. According to what Abdullah has written to Haji Hasan and myself the Cal cutta office says ' tell Malcolm not to write any letters to the Bombay office' 5 . It becomes evident that as you know well the courses of affairs and the answers due to every one, and as you grasp facts, it is for this reason that he says you should write no letters for us {Le., on our behalf). Otherwise what is the object I Every letter requires an answer. I do not know what to write concerning the state ol things which has been brought about. It is now about three or four years that despite all my endea vours to get oxide shipped to London, as a sample, it cannot be done. What further should I represent to you, and sahams.69 A nnex 40. Statement of Mr. Mr- Tigran Malcolm appears before me this day, 30th May 1911, and makes the tollowing statement: — ^ ? 1 tie history of my entry into tue Abu Musa oxide concern was as follows ; — I had oeen for some years connected with the trade in oxide from Hormnz in association with ^Naknoda Ali Ahmed Saleh, in whose name the concession then was. He, howe\er, lost the concession and then, in consultation with me, he set to work to obtain a concession for extracting Abu Musa oxide, having first made a trial shipment. 1 It was Nakhoda Ali who first started the Abu Musa mining • Hasan Sameiyeh knew nothing about the oxide trade until Nakhoda Ali intro duced him to it. The latter had at this time a very bad name 2 with the local autho- rities and in commercial circles in the Gulf Ports, and so he found it convenient to work through Hasan Sameiyeh, , After securing the Abu Musa Concession; the parties thought it would be to their advantage to bring me into it with a view to my arranging the shipments to Europe and elsewhere, and so I came into it. Nakhoda Ali was the moving spirit in the acquiring of the Concession, Hasan Sameiyeh was only used as a screen, l he former was in charge of the mining work and always complained greatly of the obstructiveness of Abdullah Sameiyeh and his father Hasan, and their ignorance of matters connected with the oxide trade. Owing, however, to his own state of bankruptcy, Nakhoda Ali could not take a prominent part in the concern, and so Abdullah and Hasan gradually began to dominate it; Nakhoda Ali managed the work on the Island, I was expected to manage the sales and shipment to Europe, and Hasan acted as corresponding member of the Company. No particular basis of authority existed, so far as I know, on which Hasan was entitled to act, and to the best of my belief (and I have an excellent me mory) I have never heard of or seen the' so-called Memorandum of Association which you have now shown me. Much less did I ever sign it or receive a copy of it. Nor was I consulted at all or informed regarding the sale of a share in the concern by Shf .ikh Sagar to Yusuf bin Abdullah or by Yusuf to Hasan or Hasan to Brown. It is all new to me. In any case Hasan Sameiyeh never acted according to the rules now shown to me. He has never rendered any accounts at all. In fact the mismanagement of the Sameiyeh and the extravagance of Abdullah have always been a great cause of complaint both to me and Nakhoda Ali. Bushire ; ) (Sd). T. J.

Mote m the history and character of Mirza ' The UceAJonsulaie at Bushire ' referred to at page 5 of the Foreign Office print the German Memorandum, and in item 26 iLe Dragoman in question is the man referred to in tlie report submitted by 36 to His Majesty's Minister, Teheran. 3316 27tll Juae % 1909 in COBAectiOB with No, 3 to His Majesty's Foreign Office. the disturbances at Bushire of the sprint of No. 1498 to the Goyornment of India. ig 09; when troops hM to be landed from His Majesty's ships for the protection of foreigners. fI beg reference to that report from which point my present note takes un the thread. At that time (the summer of 1909) I considered that I had a good deal to com plain of in the attitude towards me of the Acting German Consul Herr Wassmuss, and in this view Sir George Barclay fully concurred on seeing papers which I showed him personally in Teheran ; 1 attributed this mainly to the fact that Herr Wassmuss, as a new comer with no knowledge of the country or language, was necessarily in the hands of his Dragoman. Both he, however, and Dr. Listemann, the permanent incumbent, placed im plicit reliance on the man and neither would hear a word against him. This of course was not unnatural ^As will be seen from what follows the man has since been entirely exposed, dis credited and summarily dismissed. On the termination of the disturbances and the expulsion of Saiyid Murteza Mirza Husein gave up his leisure to local politics and by Judicious bribery among the community of harbour boatmen (his father was a local Nakhoda) got himself elected a member of the Bushire Anjuman. Later on, in January 1910, he was able to contrive his selection and that of his ally Mirza Ali Kazeruni (see my report of June 1909) as candidates for two of the seats in the Teheran Majlis allot ted to the Gulf Poits. The Governor, however, intervened on the ground that the election was not a bona-fide one and their deputation never took shape. Meanwhile Mirza Husein's operations in arms dealings in association with Haji Muhammad Hassan, the local broker of Messrs. Wonckhaus, proceeded as usual but some of the captures of arms by His Majesty's ships were reported to have in volved the pair in heavy losses and put them in some financial difficulty. Is March 1910, owing to the stagnation of trade in Bushire and other causes, Messrs. Wonckhaus withdrew their European agent for a time and left the broker Haji Muhammad Hassan in charge. The jealousy evinced by Mirza Husein at not being given the agency himself, resulted in a split between him and Haji Muham mad Hassan which led to a good deal of mutual recrimination and consequent exposure of their shady business affairs. In September 1910 a sum of £ 1,700 oddiwhich Messrs. Wonckhaus had despatched, through the medium of Haji Muham mad Hassan, to the neighbouring coast by sailing boat for the purchase of grain for export, was lost. The money disappeared in transit and suspicion, fostered by Mirza Husein, fell on Haji Muhammad. The latter eventually absconded to Tangistan, and Mirza Husein was appointed in his place as Wonckhaus' agent. The firm, however, soon came to the conclusion that Mirza Husein was implicated, and Muhammad Hassan more sinned against than sinning, and induced the latter to return from Tangistan. A short time afterwards they preferred a claim on his behalf against Mirza Husein for misappropriating in the broker's absence a cargo of arms which the latter had ordered out. These arms Mirza Husein is said to have sold to various dealers, of whom one Abdul Karim bought and secreted 10. These arms having been traced and seized, the Director of Customs having obtained proof of their import by Mirza Husein, took up the case against him with the Governor and the German Consulate. At the same time the German firm convinced their Consul of Mirza Husein's dishonest behaviour in connection with the disappear ance of the £1,700 and the defalcations of Haji Muhammad Hassan, with the74 reBult tliat Dr, Listemann at last decided to dismiss his retainer. To this end Mr. Krumpeter, Messrs. Wonckhous' then agent, armed with a letter from the German Consul intimating his dismissal and enclosing his pay to date, proceeded with the Consul's authority to the Mirza's house with the intention of arresting him or seizing certain important documents which he was believed to hold. Mirza Husein, however, escaped by a back door and took ' bast' with a local Mullah. Monsieur Constant, the Belgian Provincial Director of Customs, Bushire, about this time received instructions from Teheran to report to his Administration concerning the case against Mirza JHusem, and informed my Commercial Adviser, Mr. Chick, of the purport of a telegraphic report which he had sent towards the latter part of March, which was to this effect, 'Herr Krumpeter had been deputed by the German Consul to hand Mirza Husein a letter of dismissal and the salary due to him. The Mirza took to flight, realising that he had been unmasked and convicted of extensive robberies on the German Firm.' 'Mirza Husein is now spending large sums of money in order to procure false evidence from the Mullahs. 'Mirza Husein has long since been known to the Customs as an importer of arms and is at the moment being prosecuted by the Customs for smuggling ten rifles, and in this connection the Governor of Bushire has informed me that Mirza Husein had sent him 150 tomans as a bribe. He, Mirza Husein, is now haggling as to the amount of fine which he should be called upon to pay. Mirza Husein, $s an agitator and a rogue, whose downfall will be welcome by all honest mem bers of the community.' Charges against Mirza Husein are still pending and, meanwhile, the German Consul is withholding the rent of the German Consulate premises which belong to Mirza Husein, in connection with his debt to the German firm. Lastly, his old friends of the spring of 1909 have since turned against him and recently got up an extensive round-robin (signed among others by his Nationalist accomplice Mirza Ali, Kazeruni) in which they accuse him of being Saiyid Murte- za's instigator and evil genius and demanded that he should be made to disgorge ©r refund the money which he had prompted Saiyid Murteza to plunder from the Government Customs. It will be seen that Mirza Husein has been thoroughly discredited; denounced fey the Local Government; prosecuted by the Customs and the German firm for dsshonesty and summarily dismissed from his post in the German Consulate. I submit that we have ample grounds to mention, in our reply to the German Rejoinder, that since the penning of it they must admit that the Dragoman, upon whose integrity they relied, has been proved to be a thorough rogue and that they will appreciate our inability to place reliance on his statements.

Baron von Stumm to Sir Edward Gr 1, 1908.) l.our Excellency, ^ 31, 1907. ON the l^th instant, the Imperial Embassy gave Sir Charles Hardinge to understand that they were ready to lay before the British Government papers connected with the complaint of the German firm R. Wonckhaus and Co., relative to the mines of oxide of iron at Abu Musa in the Persian Gulf. These papers have now reached the Kmbassy and I have the honour to transmit them herewith, with copies of the inclosures in duplicate. On the assumption that as the action of the Sheikh of Shargah, which has given rise to the German firm's complaint, took place, as far as can be ascertained, with the help of a British man-of-war and apparently in the presence of a British Consul, the British Government is now, or will be shortly in possession of detailed information with regard thereto, I have the honour to express the hope that your Excellency will communicate in the same open way to the German Government the papers in possession of the British Government, Complaint of the German Firm R.Wonckhaus ACCORDING to papers, copies of which are in possession of the German Government, Salem-bin-Sultan, uncle of the ruling Sheikh of Shargah (Segger-bin- Cbftlid), is the owner of iron oxide mines on the island of Abu Musa in the Persian Gulf, which appears to be included in the territory of the Sheikh of Shargah. In 1898 Salem-bin-Sultan by a document (Inclosure 1) leased his iron oxide mines on Abu Musa for a fixed yearly rent to a Company consisting of three British subjects, of whom a certain Hadschi Hassan-ben-Ali Samaye, as the eldest, conducted the affairs of the lessors. In 1899 the Company, consisting of the three lessors, admitted the reigning Sheikh of Shargah (Segger-bin-Chalid) into the Company, so that the Company of lessors now consisted of four persons with equal rights therein. The Sheikh soon transferred his share to another person, Jussuf-bin-Abd ullah . The latter sold his share subsequently to Hadschi Hassan-bin-Ali Samaye, the above-mentioned managing partner of the Company. The latter sold his share in October 1907 to the British subject Mr. Thomas Brown, of Lingah, and a few days later he (Mr. Brown) sold the share to the German firm R. Wonckhaus and Co., of Lingah (Inclosures 4 a to 4 b ). These documents are attached to the last sheet of the original of the lease). The Company of lessors, therefore, consists apparently to-day of three British subjects and the German firm R. Wocnkhaus and Co. The lease of the Company appears to be legally constituted; this was recognized by the reigning Sheikh of Shargah. since he himself was, for a time a partner in the Company. It appears, therefore, that an absolutely legitimate commercial business is concerned. In the last few months the Sheikh has addressed to the above mentioned British subject Hadschi Hassan-bin-Ali Samaye, the managing partner, several communications (Inclosures 12, 16, 21, 23) of which the last is said to have been handed to Samaye in the presence of the British Consular Agent at Lingah. In these communications he demanded that the working of the mines at Abu Musa should be stopped. Further, in October 1907 the Sheikh sent armed men to the island, who forcibly expelled the miners and prevented the mines being worked. The boats with the Sheikh's armed men were towed to Abu Musa by the British I have, &amp;c. (Signed) STUMM. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. [2790 a—1] Bman of-war ' Lapwing,' on board of which is said to have been Lieutenant C. H. Gabriel, British Consul at Bander Abbas. When a few days later, after the departure of the British man-of-war, the British subject, Mr. Thomas Brown, in the employment of the German firm R. Wonckhaus, who are partners in the Company, and later another employe, said to be a German, ot the same house approached the island in order to land there, they were compelled to return by shots from the Sheikh's armed men. By the forcible measures and the apparently in every respect illegal conduct of the Sheikh of Shargah, the Company—and as far as regards their share in the Company the German firm R. Wonckhaus and Co.—have been prevented from enjoying the lease granted to the Company by the proprietor of the mines, Salem-bin Sultan, the uncle of the reigning Sheikh. The Company is thereby suffering losses since they have entered into contracts to deliver fixed quantities of iron oxide at a fixed price (Inclosures 6, 19). In particular, the managing partner has entered into a contract (Inclosure 5), dated the Ist June, 1906, with the German merchant, Herr Robert Wonckhaus, of Lingah (partner in the above-mentioned firm K. Wonckhaus and Co.), under which 2,000 to 5,000 tons are to be delivered yearly, for four years to Herr Wonckhaus from the Abu Musa mines. The Company have also undertaken to deliver 400 tons yearly during five years in India (Inclosure 19). In both cases it is clearly a question of perfectly legitimate business operations as practised all over the world. The documents in possession of the Imperial Government lead them to certain conclusions with regard to the motives wnich have caused this conduct on the part of the Sheikh. In the above-mentioned communications from the Sheikh to the managing partner, Mr. Samaye, it is said :— 1. That the young Isa-bin-Abdul Latif, one of the partners in the Company, had complained to him, the Sheikh, that the contract with Robert Wonckhaus had been concluded without his previous knowledge. This partner and he, the Sheikh, did not approve the contract. Samaye was not entitled without their approval to conclude a contract with regard to the whole production of the mines for a long period. They would suffer losses if they approved the contract (Inclosure 12); 2. That the Sheikh feared that the mines and the island might be taken out of his possession {Inclosure 18, Confidential, also Inclosure 20); 3. That in the lease of 1 h98 there was no provision allowing the whole production of the mines to be transferred to a foreigner without his approval. The Sheikh is thus speaking as if he had himself concluded the lease of 1898 with the lessors' Company (Inclosare 22). It is obvious that the Sheikh Sejrger-bin-Chalid did not conclude the lease of 1898 (Inclosure 1). This was done by his uncle, Salem-bin-Sultan, acting within his own rights, and the Sheikh recognized this by the fact that he himself was for a certain time a partner in the Company. It is true that the lease of 1898 contained no provision with regard to the sale of the production of the mines to foreigners. In view of the recognized liberty of trade in the Persian Gulf it is to be inferred from the omission of such a prohibition that the conclusion of contracts with foreigners was without doubt within the powers of the Company, and not the reverse. The contract concluded in June 1906 between the Company and the German Herr R. Wonckhaus, to which the Sheikh refers is, therefore, according to the lease granted in 1898 by the Sheikh's uncle, absolutely admissible and legally unassailable. The Sheikh's fear that in consequence of the contract he might lose possession of the mines and the island is senseless. Apart from the fact that the mines do not belong to the Sheikh but to his Uncle Salem, the contract only grants to Herr Wonckhaus the right to receive at a fixed price during the fixed time of four years the greater part of the production of the mines—an arrangement such as any merchant could conclude when the opportunity offered. The contract does not refer lo the acquisition of the mines themselves or of the Island of Abu Musa, or to any separation of the island from the Sheikh's territory, and it has no such aim in view. II err Wonckhaus is a merchant like any other, he is not pursuing any political objects, and in concluding the contract he has only made use of the right belonging to him, as to every merchant, to transact business which appears profitable to him. It is not true, as is shown by the contract of 1906, to say that Herr Wonckhaus has bought the whole production of the mines. But even if he had done so there would/ 6 3 be no objection to a business transaction such as takes place everywhere unhindered. That the contract might cause looses to the Company, may indicate that it would perhaps be possible for the Company to conclude a more favourable contract for them selves. If this were the case, there would even then be no legal objection to the contract. It may be the case that the contract was concluded without the knowledge of the Sheikh, Meanwhile there is no reason why this contract should have required the approval of the sheikh, as it was merely a legal and purely business transaction. It does not appear to be the case that the contract was concluded without the agreement of one ot the partners of the Company, Isa-bia-Abdul Latit, as the managing parter Samaye informed Isa's father Abdul Latif, who represented his son in all matters concerning the Company, at once of the conclusion of the contract, and the latter approved the contract m his reply (Indosure 6). According to a later letter of the father, Abdul Latif (lucloau re 8) , Ms son Isa appears to recognize the contract as legally valid, although he would have liked to have seen it before its conclusion, as he describes its abrogation simply as ' preferable,' and in the next letter of Abdul Latif senior (Inclosure 10) the latter says definitely that he had originally approved the contract on behalf of his son. Even if one of the partners desires to attack the validity of the contract of 1906 by stating that it required his consent, which had not been obtained, yet it is impossible to see how this gives the Sheikh the right to abrogate by force the lease of 1898 granted by his uncle Salem. This would appear, therefore, to be a question of a purely arbitrary, and, from the legal point of view, absolutely indefensible proceeding on the part of the Sheikh of ttif&gt; ■l'&gt;acriEgiX!nmpa,ny l ■ ..... .■imriiirn ----min This illegal action affects directly the German firm R. Wonckhaus and Co. as partners in the Company, and is not a claim raised by the German firm against the other partners in the Company. Their complaint is based on their own rights as partners in the Company, and it will be the Sheikh's duty to compensate the German partner as well as the other partners in the Company, who are British subjects, for his illegal action. TBe losses which have accrued to the Company are very considerable, as they cannot evade the obligations assumed by them in the above-mentioned contracts (Inclosures 5 and 19), especially in the contract (Inclosure 5) concluded in 1906 with the German Herr Wonckhaus, which contract appears to have caused the Sheikh to commit his act of aggression. Through this contract immediate losses are incurred by the Company, as they have been prevented by the forcible measures of the Sheikh from delivering 2,000 tons of iron oxide to Herr Wonckhaus which had already been extracted, and which ought to have been shipped weeks ago. Further losses will be caused by the fact that the Company is not in a position to extract at the proper time the quantities of iron oxide which they must keep ready for the deliveries due in the coming months. As Herr Wonckhaus, on his side, has already resold the iron oxide to his shipper, and now in order to fulfil this obligation must buy iron oxide elsewhere at a high price, it is obvious that the loss accruing to the Company through the counter-claim of Herr Wonckhaus amounts to a large sum, and will be greatly increased by any further prevention of the working of the mines. The imperial Government consider therefore that it is urgently necessary to settle the matter at once and think that the British Government will agree with them, in view of the fact that the other partners of the Company, who are suffering equally from (he arbitrary action of the Sheikh, are British subjects. In the first place, it will be necessary that the Sheikh of Shargali, in order to avoid further losses, should, without delay, allow the Company to work the iron oxide mines On the island of Abu Musa. Later on it will be necessary to deal with the question of compensation for the losses suffered by the Company. It will also be necessary to consider whether the circumstance that armed men of the Sheikh's tired on employes of Wonckhaus who who wished to land on the island requires special reparation on the part of the Sheikh. Mr. Thomas Brown, whose life was seriously endangered, is, as already stated,*a British subject, while the nationality of the other employe concerned, who describes himself as a German, requires to be established.

My son Isa does not agree to the contract with these conditions and you neither consulted him, nor did you send a copy oi Jxe contract before vou concluded the oxide business with the Germans, so as to compare your ideas and work in concordance. Obviously it is necessary that a partner engages himself only8 -after consulting his partners in order to avoid trouble. You have entered into this work without having his opinion ; for this reason my son Isa does not agree to the contract which exists between you and the Germans, because Isa fears the trouble that may arise in consequence of taking strangers into this business. The cession (cessation ?) of this . f / ' contract would be preferable to its continuance.

In order to facilitate work, I have sent my brother Hamed with coolies to dig the oxide and put it into bags, and up to now we have been waiting for bags, but have not yet obtained a sufficient number.

Regarding the complaint lodged with us by Isa-ben-Abdul Latif concerning the oxide in Abu Musa, you mention that your contract with the Germans was made by his and his father's knowledge, as per letter dated 21st Rebi-ul-Thani, 1324. In the same letter he also warns you against entering engagements resembling a lease or binding yourself in such way as to occasion a row; he further mentions that you should go a sure way, because his officials would not agree to it. The existing contract between you and the Germans, and the condi tions which you have bound yourself to, are altogether contrary to the letter of Isa's father, which you mention. The reason that we are frightened of your work is that it is not remote that the mines go out of our sphere. We entered into this with you knowing that you are British subjects. We did not tell you to make contracts with strangers from foreign Powers without informing us, and to bind yourself. You have no right to make use of it and write on the head of the contract that you are the owners and possessors of the lease held in Abu Musa. To this we never agree, and you are not allowed to take oxide of iron from Abu Musa Island on the condition which you have made, unless the business is put on a footing of which we need not fear the consequences.

The reason ot writing this is that in these days our man came from the island and informed us that a man on behalf of Sheikh Saker with a note bearing no seal, and pre tending that it was from you, stopped the coolies from digging oxide from the mines, [2790 a—1] E12 stating further that this prohibition is ordered by S. Saker. • We do not understand the interference of S. Saker, Should this reall v be a fact, the action of S. Saker ia contrary to law. He has no right to raise any objections and interfere with us. He should remember that he, as you know, has been one of the partners who sold his share to us, and for this reason we assert that he has no right to interfere with us, nor to stop the Coolies from digging in the oxide mines. He must know and recognize that the stoppage of work means a great loss to us, as we even during the delay have to pay the coolies their daily wages. We conjecture that this proceeding of S. Saker is without yoiir knowledge, and that you do not agree to these unjust interference and objections of his. As you know, all the contracts and correspondence from the beginning till this day, bave been done by knowledge and approval of the British Political Agent, Abdul Latif, and all of you. It is astonishing that S, Saker goes beyond his limits and interferes irl a matter which has been concluded with the consent and approval of the British Agent, We have this moment written to Khan Behadur, Political Agent Abdul Latif, because from the beginning of our leasehold with you and others, have done all by his knowledge and approval, and because we consider him one of our partners, and we wish to know his final reply. Really we do not want all these troubles and disputes, but as you know, when necessity arises, one is obliged to stand up and defend his rights, which naturally entails a noisy dispute. We are compelled to address ourselves to our Government, and claim whatsoever losses we sustain from him who interferes. This action of S. Saker is due to his jealonsj of you and us, but we hope that so long as you are in existence, we have every confi dence, and strangers have no rights over us.

He replies that the Island of Abu Musa is his property, and so long as he cannot make suitable arrangements he considers himself a loser. If he did not formerly interfere, it was due to the good understanding existing between you, but now he cannot leave the case alone as before, because a stranger has entered therein, and he is afraid that by and by the island will get out of his possession.

We learn that, in spite of our prohibition, he still works the oxide mines in Abu Musa and enjoys the profits. On this account we hereby proclaim to the said Hage Hassan-ben-Ali Semey, and demand from him the immediate cession of work in the mines and removal of himself, his employed, and all his mining implements from the Island of Abu Musa within ten days from the date that tbis notice reacEes him. Let this be known. Written and dated the 25th Shaban, 1326. ' (Signed) Sheikh SEGER-BEN-KHALET-BEN-SULTAN- EL-GASSEMI, (Received in Lingah 2 Ramazan, 1325.) '&lt; ! A / S ' /j/'-2% [22073] No. 11. Memorandum, communicated HIS Majesty's Government have had under careful consideration the situation which has arisen in connection with the export of red oxide from, the Island of Abu Musa, and which formed the subject of a communication made by the German Charg6 d'Affaires on the 31st December, 1907. The subject is so intricate in nature that it proved necessary to transmit all the documents forwarded by the German Embassy to the Government of India and to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf. This officer lost no time in instituting the requisite inquiries, but, owing to the absence of telegraphic communication with Shargah, and the necessity of subjecting the several documents bearing on the case to detailed examination, it has not been found possible to reply to the communica tion in question at an earlier date. The result of this examination tends clearly to establish that the statements of fact upon which the complaint of Messrs. Wonckhaus is based are inaccurate. For convenience of exposition the substance of each particular count of this complaint is set forth under a separate heading and printed in italics ; the observations of His Majesty's Government are subjoined in ordinary type. Copies of the documents referred to are annexed in the Appendix. 1. The mines on Abu Musa are owned Sheikh of Shargah. They were leased by Salim 1898 rent. The Island of Abu Musa, with the mining and all other rights, is, and can be proved to be, the property of the ruling Sheikh of Shargah, Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khaled. This is established by a letter dated the 21st February, 1908, in which Salim-bin-Sultan categorically disclaims all right of ownership, and declares that, in granting the^ lease of 1898^ he merely acted as pro xy for the ruling Sheikh, then absent on a pilgrimage to Mecca (see Appendix, Ko^ 1).* The two men were at one time at enmity, Salim having been the ruling Sheikh till April 1883, when he was deposed by his nephew, Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khaled, who has ever since been the ruling Sheikh. .Relations between them now depend on an Agreement concluded in 1889 (see Appendix, No, 2). The ruling Sheikh has, ever since his uncle was deposed in April 1883, made the latter an allowance, in which, solely in virtue of oral and personal arrange ments, the revenue of the island, together with that of the mines, has been included (see Appendix, No 5). When Salim has resided on the island, he has done so only on sufferance, a -circumstance which is corroborated by two letters addressed in 1884. by the ruling Sheikh to the British Besident in the Persian Gulf (see Appendix, Nos. 3 and 4). The Island of Abu Musa is shown by its history, as recorded in the accompanying Memorandum (see Appendix, No. 6), to be an integral part of the dominions of the Sheikh of Shargah, who in recent years has regularly sent his own live stock there for purposes of grazing. It thus appears that Salim did not conclude the lease of 1898 m the capacity of owner, but in that of Begent, a contention which is further supported oy a letter, dated the 11th October, 1902, from the ruling Sheikh to the British Resident (see Appendix, No. 7). 2. The lease of the Company appears to ' the ruling Sheikh of Shargah, since he himself The use of the word ' lease ' rather obscures the true nature of the rights granted to the partners by the document of 1898 (see Appendix, No. 9). The document was not an absolute grant to the partners of the right to mine oxide on the island for an undetermined period. It was a mere permit to the partners terminable on either side at any time. . ... . That the partners were entitled to terminate the Concession is shown by the words, ' for such a period as they may wish to hold them,' but the only effect of these words is to give the partners the right to surrender the mines and escape from the liability to pay 250 dollars a-year when they please. They do not imply that the rio-ht to terminate the contract is with the partners alone, and that the owner is24 Tjoaiid foi cvei s and can under no circumstances escape from the contract, however valuable the mines may become. i the lessor retained the right to determine contracts of this character is shown o\ t e penultimate paragraph of the document: I have perhaps made out certain greements previous to this. They do not hold good, and this Agreement is to be acted on. m 1 ' u , ese c i r 9 umSl ' ailces ^ le ' tease appears to have been no more than a permit to work these mines, determinable by notice on either side, the owners receiving 250 dollars a-year so long as it was in force. The action of the ruling Sheikh in becoming a partner in the concern for a few months in 1899 cannot affect his right to cancel the lease granted in his behalf, no matter what complexion the Company might in future assume. Were there anv question at issue as to the genuineness of the lease granted in 1898 by Salim, the fact that the Sheikh had subsequently become a partner would be of importance, but as he approved the lease no such question arises, and his temporary partnership is an incident naving no direct bearing upon the points at issue. -j. Tn Octobet 1907 llosson-bin-Ali Sarnuiyeh, share in the Company to the British subject later, transferred the share to the German fir Wonckhaus Company of lessors now apparently consists ii. Wonckhaus and Co It appears thai is concerned. In a letter dated the 21st February, 1907 (see Appendix, No. 8), the ruling Sheikh of Shargah addressed a communication to Hassan Samaiyeh withdrawing the document of Concession and informing him that, the contract of 1898 being terminated, he had no longer any right of enjoyment in regard to the mines on Abu Musa. In these circumstances, Messrs. Wonckhaus, if they purchased without notice of the fact that the Concession had been terminated, have been misled either by Hassan Samaiyeh or by the intermediate vendor, Mr. Brown; in either case, their appropriate remedy would appear to be an action at law against the vendor for damages. If, when they purchased the share in the Concession, they were already aware that it had come to an end, they have no cause for complaint at the action of the Sheikh either in terminating the Concession or in enforcing his action by the removal of the workmen from the island, for they bought with lull knowledge of the position. In either event, Messrs, Wunckhaus and Co. do not appear to have in their capacity as partners to question the Sheikh's action. 4. In October 1907 the Sheikh sent armed and 'prevented the mines being worked. The b to Abu Musa by the British man-of-war 'Lapwing Lieutenant Gabriel, British Vice-Consul at Bunde The Sheikh had recourse to forcible measures within his own jurisdiction in consequence of the persistent refusal of Hassan Samaiyeh to desist, in accordance with the Slieikh's repeated injunctions, from working the mines. As the expulsion of British subjects was in contemplation, and the British Resident in the Persian Gulf had been duly notified of the Sheikh's intention, it was considered prudent that one of His Majesty's ships, with a British Consular officer on board, should accompany the armed force to the island, in order to prevent the use of unnecessary violence. It was probably owing to this precaution that all bloodshed and loss of life were prevented. The Sheikh's boats were, towed to the island in order to insure their simultaneous arrival with His Majesty's ship ' Lapwing,' and to enable the British officers to control the action of the Sheikh's retainers more effectively, o. t ae forcible measures and illegal cond Co m pa it g have been prevented from enjoying the lease grante The rights of the Sheikh of Shargah in regard to the disposal of his own property are absolute, since, apart from such general control as, in virtue of Treaty relations, is exercised by the Government of India, he is subject to no external control, and is bound only by such laws as.lie himself may decree.'Tj 25 In the case of the particular lease or permit in question, it has already been shown that the Sheikh Mas entitled to determine it at his discretion. In no sense of the word cioes the conduct 01 the Sheikh appear to have been illegal. 6 S 1 Ae Company is thereby suffering losses, since they have entered into contracts to deliver fixed quantities of'iron oxide at a fixed price. In particular, the managing partner has entered into a contract dated the 1st June, 1906, with the German merchant Herr Robert Jfonckhaus, of Liiigah {partner in the above-mentioned firm JR. Wonckhaus and Co.), to deliver certain fixed quantities for four years. There is nothing in the documents in the possession of His Majesty's Government to indicate that Hassan Samaiyeh occupied the post of managing partner^ and for I reasons which will appear more fully below there seems every reason to believe that Hassan Samaiyeh had no right as against his partners to enter into any such contract without their knowledge, and that, had they been aware of its terms, they would have refused their consent. It is clear that when the document was disclosed and the terms of the contract became known to the other partners they declined to approve it. The abrogation of the lease or permit has certainly rendered it impossible for either the Company in whose name Hassan contracted, or for Hassan himself, to carry out the contract. His Majesty's Government are not fully aware of the relations between Hassan and the firm of H. Wonckhaus and Co., but they recognize that it is possible that Hassan's action in making a contract which he was unable to fulfil may have rendered him liable to Messrs. Wonckhaus in substantial damages. This, however, is a matter between Messrs, Wonckhaus and Hassan. 7. The information in the possession of the German Government leads them to certain* conclusions in regard to the motives of the Sheikh of Shargah. These motives may conveniently be discussed under two headings, (a) the objections of Esabin-Abdul Latif, one of the partners in the Company formed to work the Concession granted in 1898, and (6) the objections of the Sheikh himself, to the terms of a certain contract entered into by the aforesaid Hassan Samaiyeh with Herr Robert Wonckhaus on the 1st June, 1906. By this contract (see Appendix, No. 10) Hassan Samaiyeh, w 7 ho is described as ' owner and holder of Bu Musa Concession,' gives a the entire monopoly of Bu Musa oxide to Robert Wonckhaus during the terms of the contract ' (savings certain small amounts duly specified), and, on the expiry of the contract, reserves to Robert Wdnckhaus the preferential right of renewal. With regard to point (a), the German Government state :— It does not appear to be the case that the contract vjas concluded without the agreement of Esa-bin~Abdul Latif, as the managing partner, Hassan Samaiyeh, immediately on the conclusion of the contract informed, Esa's father, Abdul Latif, who represented his son in all matters pertaining to the Company, and Abdul Latif approved the contract in his reply. According to a later letter of the father, the son appears to recognize the contract as legally valid, although he would have liked to have seen it before its conclusion, as he describes its abrogation simply as ' € preferable,* 1 and in a subsequent letter the father says definitely that he had originally approved the contract on behalf of his son. The documents referred to in the foregoing statement form Inclosures 6, 8, and 10 in the note from the German Embassy, but the translations of these documents in the possession of His Majesty's Government (see Appendices, Nos. 12, 16. and 17) differ materially from those forwarded by the German Embassy, and further letters of considerable importance are omitted from the German case. The 1st June, 1906, was the date of execution of the deed of contract between Hassan Samaiyeh and Mr. Robert Wonckhaus, When, on the 11th June, 1906 (see Appendix, No. 11), Hassan Samaiyeh reported the Agreement to Esa's father, Abdul Latif, he concealed the existence of what was virtually a monopoly and of the preferential right of renewal. In his reply, dated the 14th June (see Appendix, No. 12), Abdul Latif comments upon the transaction in guarded language, and expressly requests Hassan Samaiyeh to ' refrain from entering upon any arrange ments whatever in the nature of leases or deeds of contract, from which there will arise difficulties and quarrels.' On the 26th June, 1906, Mr. T. Malcolm, a British-protected sub ject, with whom [1598] ^ H26 the concessionnaires had engagements, requested Hassan Samaiyeh to furnish him with a copy of the Agreement, inquiring whether other European firms could enter into similar contracts. Both points were evaded by Hassan Samaiyeh in his reply of the 13th July (see Appendix, Ko. 13), in which he alleged that the original contract Tiad been drawn up in German; and in a further letter of the 14th October (see Appendix, No. 14) to Mr. Malcolm he refused to send a copy of the Agreement, and said that secrecy of the transaction had been enjoined by Herr B/Obert Wonckhaus. It was not until the 16th December, 19 0 6 (see Appendix, No. 15), that he sent a copy of it to Abdul Latif, who, on receipt of the document, wrote on the 23rd January, 1907 (see Appendix, No, 16), to Hassan Samaiyeh stating that his son Esa did not agree to the execution of such an Agreement, which had been concluded without any consultation among the partners, such as should undoubtedly have taken place. The phrase which, in Inclosure 8 of the Grerman case, is translated t£ the cessation of this contract would be preferable to its continuance ' is more accurately rendered by the nullification of this contract is better than its acceptance.' This employment of the comparative is, in Arabic epistolary form, a customary euphemistic manner of expressing a definite resolution. In the present case this interpretation is confirmed by the whole tenor of the letter in question. It does not appear, as contended in the German case, that Abdul Latif definitely says in his letter of the 27th March, 1907 {see Appendix, No. 17), that he had originally approved the contract on behalf of his son Esa. It is clear that the main ground of Esa-bin-Abdul Latif's objection to the contract was that Hassan Samaiyeh, improperly describing himself in inaccurate terms as ' owner and holder of Bu Musa Concession,' had, without consulting his partners, formed a contract with Herr Wonckhaus which tied the hands of the Company, not improbably for an indefinite period, in regard to practically the whole amount of red oxide excavated at the island, and bound them to sell it at a fixed price, so that they would derive no advantage from any increase in the price of oxide. It is obvious that a contract of such far-reaching import should, before being concluded, have been submitted to all the parties interested. Esa-bin-Abdul Latif has ■expressly denied that he gave any power of attorney to Hassan Samaiyeh, and maintains that it was incumbent upon the latter to act in regard to every trans action in communication with him, according as was agreed in the deed drawn up on the admission of Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh to partnership in the Company (see Inclosure 2 in the note from the German Embassy), If the Cdhtract had in reality been submitted to and approved by Abdul Latif on behalf of his son Esa, it is difficult to see the reason for which Herr Wonckhaus enjoined secrecy on Hassan Samaiyeh (see Appendix, No, 14), As will be seen from the accompanying Petition (see Appendix, No. 18) from Nejef, the son and heir of Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh, now deceased, Esa-bin-Abdul Latif is not the only partner in the Company who takes exception to the proceedings of Hassan Samaiyeh. His Majesty's Government understand that the dragoman of the German Consulate, Bushire, has been in communication with Nejef-bin-Nakhoda in regard to his attitude towards the contract of the 1st June, 1006. With regard to (b) (the objections of the Sheikh of Shargah himself to the contract of the 1st June, 1906), the German Government are of opinion that— The Sheikh's fear that he might lose posses while the fact that there was no provision in th 1898 the mines to be transferred to a foreigner without clusive than the emission of a prohibition ag and, recognized liberty of trade in the Persian Gulf, contracts with foreigners was within the powersoj The principal motive of the Sheikh of Shargah in cancelling, in accordance with the exercise of 'his sovereign rights of jurisdiction, the lease granted in his behalf by the Begent in 1898 was evidently a proper and natural desire to administer j ustice as between the partners of the Company, and to render nugatory the unauthorized action of Hassan Samaiyeh, Moreover, on learning how far the terms of the contract with Herr B. Wonckhaus went, conferringas they did a preferential right of renewal for an indefinite period, the Sheikh may well Iiave'felt that his own pecuniary interest in the mirres w(5uld hot, in view of the increasing market value of red oxide, be properly safeguarded by a payment limited indefinitely to a sum of 250 dollars a-year. In5Z 27 these circumstances the Sheikh would not unnaturally have deemed it advisable to protest against the contract with Herr Wonckhaus so soon as he became aware of its purport, rather than to allow this gentleman to acquire, with the lapse of time, a vested interest in the output of the mines. The position at the present time appears to His Majesty's Government to be that Herr Robert Wonckhaus has entered into a contract with Hassan Samaiyeh. who, I having acted without authority from his partners, is unable to carry out his contract, f and is consequently liable to Herr Wonckhaus in damages. If, therefore, further steps are taken they should be of a legal character, and it will be at the discretion of Herr Wonckhaus whether they are taken or not. His Majesty's Government appreciate the friendly manner in which the German Government have dealt with the case, and, pending a final decision of the whole question, they are prepared to use their good offices in order that temporary arrange ments may be made whereby Messrs. Wonckhaus will be enabled to procure a limited amount ot red oxide to place them in a position to fulfil such contracts as they may lioA e entered into before the cancellation of the lease, instructions have accordingly heen issued to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf to ask the local representative of Messrs. Wonckhaus to give due notice when the firm intend to resume operations in order that the necessary arrangements may be made. His Majesty's Government are, however, informed that, for climatic reasons, no serious operations are possible during the next three or four months for transporting the accumulated minerals from inland to the beach.

I WRITE to inform your honour that whereas I have come to know that Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Samayieh and the friends who advise him assert that the oxide mines which are in the Island of Abu Musa are my personal property, and that the lease which was issued by me to Haji Hassan and his partners was given by me in my own right, and not by proxy, in your behalf. I fear that this statement may become a cause of ill-feeling between us ; I have therefore thought it necessary to apprise your honour ot it, and to acquaint you with what is in my mind, namely, that I absolutely made no such claim as that which interested parties allege: and I hereby admit that when I came before you in the presence of the British Agent on the 4th Shaaban, IdOl, 1 had no pension or means of subsistence, and you were kind enough to place the Island of Abu Musa under my supervision, so that I might cultivate therein, and reap from it the means of subsistence, and you did so conditionally that I showed loy^y-and Concord and obedience to you in ali respects; and I am well aware that the island in question and the mines which are in it belong to your honour, and that you might at ^ any time decide to take the island from my charge—it is at your disposition to do so, and I have no status or power to gainsay you; and when I leased the mines of Abu Musa I was officiating on your behalf, and the Concession was given by proxy for you ; and I was well aware that on your return from the pilgrimage to Mecca, if you considered that my action in the matter of the Concession was 'rood, you would confirm what I had agreed to, and if in your opinion it was objectionable 5 , you could annul it either at the time or at any other time ; and I altogether disapprove ot the proceedings of Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Samayieh in regard to this lease, and in respect of whatever action you took in this connection, that is, in cancelling the document, I was acting in accord with you, seeing that your action was taken in consultation with me and for the interests of us all, and in no respect have I any view contrary to yours; and it is in order to dispel doubt from your mind and as an evidence of my singleness of view with you that I have written' this, so that you may nave cognizance. ■ ' J (Signature and seal of Salim-bin-Sultan.)28 No. 2.

With reference to tlie matters in reference to which you acted as intermediary between me and Salim-bin-Sultan with a view to his being reconciled to me, and the meeting which we had, I hereby take upon myself the oath of God and of sincerity, so that he who fears may feel secure There shall be no deceit and no duplicity in the fulfilment of the conditions which I gave to Sheikh Salim in regard to the display of honour and ] iberality towards him and in my exchanging views with him in matters affecting our interests, and in the payment to him of the amount of his fixed pension, namely 400 French dollars, and I will not give any one's opinion preference to his, and he can live where he pleases from among the following particular places : Shargar, or Khan, or Hijra. And I hope that God will prosper relations between us and will make the result auspicious both lor him and me. This is what had to be written. (Seal of Sagar-bin-Khalid.) Agreement of 1889, dated 5 Sha 1306 6, 1889). This is what we have assembled to arrange. We have come to an agreement in the name of God and in all sincerity, without trickery and deceit, we the Sheikhs Salim-bin-Sultan and Sagar-bin-Khalid through the mediation of Abdul Latif-bin- Abdurrahman, the Agent of Government. What I, Sheikh Sagar, have bound myself to do in regard to Sheikh Salira is that I will continue the payment of the pension fixed at 400 dollars per annum, and will show him honour and complete magnanimity, and will exchange views with him in regard to matters needing consultation and expression of opinion; and in these which are needful in our own interests, and I will not put any one's opinion before his, and he can live where he likes—-from. Khan to Hijra, And what I, Sheikh Salam, have bound myself to do in regard to Sheikh Sagar is to fulfil the obligations of docility and obedience and the display of energy in ad vising him in matters affecting our interests inwardly and outwardly. And if we came to know of anything in the way of misunderstanding that might tend to cause soreness in our minds one against the other, then we will explain it to one another with a view to the removal of misunderstanding and the suppression of the efforts of the mischief makers and intriguers to make misunderstanding between us. And of our own wish and pleasure we have bound ourselves to the British Government to the effect that in the event of any violation on the part of either of us of what is outlined in this deed in the way of conditions, he will be worthy of being held responsible, and will accept what results to him in. the way of punishment and revenge from the aforesaid Government as a recompense for his breach. This is what was arranged and settled peaceably. We hope that God will prosper the results of it between us in the direction of prosperity and happiness. Executed and written 5 th Shaaban, 1306.

Previous to this I wrote to you a letter, but received no reply. I hope nothing untoward has prevented you from doing so. You are acquainted with the arrange ments which were effected between me and Sheikh Salem, through the medium of29 Sheikh Hamid-bin-Abdullah and Hashar-bin-Maktoom. At present the above Sheikhs met at Shargah, and desire^ Salem to stand by the agreement and arrangement effected by them between We and him. But he did not wish to do so, consequently they have absolved themselves of all responsibility, and revoked their guarantee which they had tended on our behalf, and the arrangements effected between us have been dissolved. At present you are aware that Salem resides at Abu Musa, which is an island dependent on Shargah, and we cannot spare it to others. Perhaps Salem may create some disturbance which may break the maritime peace. I beg therefore to request that you will kindly warn Salem, and inform him that if he is desirous of living at Abu Musa, he must do so with peace, giving you as a guarantee that nothing wrong will be done by him which will disturb the maritime peace. But should he not choose to do so, it will be your choice either to remove him from the island or leave us to settle the matter between us; and we should not be called to answer in the event of our attacking each other. I leave the matter to your disposal. No. 4. Sheikh Sagar-hin-Khalid t (After compliments.) 14, 1884. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 2nd February, 1884, per Mirza Abdul Kasim, and I understand its contents to the effect that anyone attempting to break the maritime peace, whether he be Salem or any other people, shall be duly impressed. There is no doubt about this. But according to what 1 have already said, I beg to tell you that Bu Musa is our island and a dependency of Shargah. If Salem wants to live in it and guarantees that he will not commit anything which would interfere with my affairs or disturb the maritime peace,' it matters notf-because I cannot dispense with the Island of Bu Musa, as it is of great use to me. I beg therefore you will plainly write to me on the subject, and inform your agent of the same. No. 5. Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khalid's Explanation dated February 22, 1908, In reference to the Island of Abu Musa, it is well known to everybody that it is the property of the Sheikhs of the Jowasim of Oman, and on that point there is no doubt. As to the residence of my uncle in it, the facts of the matter are as explained below:— From olden days, from the time of my ancestors Sheikh Sultan and others, it was their habit in the days of spring, after a fall of rain and the sprouting of vegetation, to send their live-stock to the Island of Abu Musa for grazing, and also a number of our subjects from Shargah and Khan habitually sojourned on the island during the winter for fishing purposes, and had houses and huts there. In the year 1300 Hijri Sheikh Salirn, who was then ruling Chief of Shargah, after sending his live-stock there as usual, went over to the island, and by the fate ordained by God the populace called upon me to become their Ruler in place of Sheikh Salim, and I accepted their call and occupied the post of the Sheikhdom. It was then open to me to expel Sheikh Salim from Abu Musa Island, and I addressed the Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject in letters which must be available on your records; the first was dated the 22nd Rabi-ul-Awal, 1301, and the second the 14th Babi II, 1301, but the Resident pressed me to make a peaceable settlement so that there might be no cause for a breach of the maritime peace. Accordingly we agreed that I would set apart for Sheikh Salim a pension for his subsistence-—every year 600 dollars. That settlement afterwards became void by my not being able to pay the amount fixed, and subse quently a second agreement was come to between us under which I was to pay him yearly 400 dollars and also the income derived from the Island of Sir Abu Nuair, which was expected to approach 200 dollars. This agreement also became void, and in the year 1306 we made a third agreement with Sheikh Salim by the mediation of the Government Agent, and in view of the fact that up to this agreement no income [1598 j - Iliad been obtainable from Sir Abu Nuair for Sheikh Salim, mention of the island was omitted and his pension remained at the previous figure of 400 dollars, but I now agreed to the return of Sheikh Salim to Shargah, and I took him into my service. Then, later on in the year 1315, I went on the Mecca pilgrimage and appointed Sheikh Salim to act for me in the Shargah Government, and on my return Sheikh Salim informed me that he had been afforded an opportunity, and had seen it to our interest, to lease the mines of Abu Musa to three persons subject to the British Government. I did not repudiate it, and saw nothing objectionable in it, and so I acquiesced in it; and seeing that Sheikh Salim had ceased not to complain that the sum of 400 dollars was not sufficient for his subsistence, I voluntarily set aside the amount of this rent for him, that it might make up his subsistence, so that the total of what came in to him yearly might be 600 dollars as before, and over, and that no cause of soreness might be left to him on account of the paucity of his allowance. I have absolutely not given him any deed in connection with the island nor in regard to the mines therein ;all I did was to relinquish the income to him. in the way of financial' assistance' troiuT me 'to 'Wm, and it was done voluntarily and at my own discretion. And 1 have not ceased in the days of spring in years when there has been lain and herbage to send my live-stock to the island for grazing purposes, as has been our custom from of old ; and my flag ceases not to fly there. Such are the facts of the matter*and I have recorded them for your information. (Signature and seal of Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khalid-bin-Sultan.) No. 6. Memorandum showing the connection of the J and SheikhSalim-bin-Sultan, respectively, Archives of the Bushire Residency. More than a century and a-half ago the Chiefs of the Jowasim Clan of Arabs, at that time paramount in authority on what was known as the ' pirate coast ' of Oman, 'with head-quarters at Eas-el-Khaima and Shargah, crossed over to the Persian Coast with their war craft and captured the port of Lingah and other places on the coast. There they remained in occupation for upwards of a century, one of the ruling family from llas-el-Khaima, acting as Chief of the branch of the tribe which remained onth e Persian Coast; having its seat of Government at Lingah, but remaining subject to the overlordship of the ruling Chief of the head-quarters of the tribe, then at 11a s - el-Kb ai ma. At that time as now practically all the islands in the Gulf were permanently or at certain seasons tenanted by Arabs tribes ; and several of them, including Abu Musa, by the Jowasim. In the pearling season the tribal fishing-boats would have recourse to these islands for water or for refuge from stress of weather; in the spring, after rain, the various Sheikhs would send their horses and flocks for grazing, and in the winter parties of their subjects habitually sojourned in the islands for fishing purposes. Time went on and the sections of the Jowasim on the Persian Coast after some generations became as it were permanent settlers there and quarrels began to arise between parties of them and their kinsmen from Oman sojourning on the islands, when their grazing interests clashed. In order to put an end to this recurrent friction the Chiefs of the Clan came to a friendly understanding under which particular islands were henceforth to be used exclusively by different portions of the tribe. Under this understanding Abu Musa fell to the Shargah branch, and the arrangement then made has never been disturbed. While not ordinarily intervening in the internal politics of the Jowasim or other Arab tribes in Treaty relations with them, the British authorities have in practice recognized this position, and, in pursuance of their time honoured policy of maintaining the ' maritime truce,' the principles of which, as we have specifically notified to the tribes, are held to apply to the islands of the Gulf as well as its waters, we have interfered in the present instance in so far as that when alien tribesmen from Debai and elsewhere have attempted to send their flocks for grazing, or otherwise to meddle with Abu Musa Sir Bu Xnair Islands, they have been directed either to desist or first obtain the acquiescence of the ruling Sheikh of Shargah in their proceedings. It is true that on one or two occasions the Persian Government, a pparently from ignorance or misconception of the history of these islands generally, have attempteds 31 to insinuate a claim to Abu Musa, but in 1888, when this claim was first asserted, iu conjunction with a similar one in connection with Sirri, Colonel E. C. Boss, for eighteen years Resident in the Persian Gulf, writing to Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, on the 28th April, 1888, observed: ' The claim now put forward to the Island of Abu Musa has no justification whatever and any attempt to assert Persian authority there in a practical form would lead to disturbance.' Again in April 1904 when an over zealous Belgian Customs official proceeded to the island ana incontinently hauled down the Shai'gah flag and hoisted the Persian emblem in its place, the Persian Government was called upon to repair the unwarranted affront, and a British man-of-war was sent to see that it had been done and that the Arab flag was replaced with due ceremony. Thus, as far as the Jowasim are concerned the position which existed from time immemorial has been maintained up to the present moment, and every year in the spring, when and after rain has fallen and vegetation made its appearance, the ruling Sheikh of Shargah and his immediate relations have been in the habit of sending their live-stock to sraze on the island. So much for the abstract history of Abu Musa as an appanage of Shargah. We may now turn to the aspects brought into relief by the present misunderstanding in connection with the grant of a Concession for mining oxide on the island. In the year 1883, the ruling Chief of Shargah was Sheikh Salim-bin-Sultan. He had held the reins of tribal Government for about eighteen years, but his regime was a weak and unpopular one. This Sheikh had taken a particular and enterprising interest in Abu Musa and had planted some date groves and built himself a rough residence there. In the. spring of 1883 he was according to his habit spending a few weeks there with the tribal horses and flocks and had left his nephew, Sagar-bin-Khalid, a young man of about 25 years of age, in charge of his head-quarters at. Shargah. Among these Arab Chieftains the principle of ' might is right' prevails, and Sagar-bin-Khalid, finding that the majority of the tribesmen of the principality were tired of his uncle's rule, and ready to support himself in a cov/p d'etat, seized the government and proclaimed himself Sheikh on the 4th April, 1883, informing the Resident of his action. The British authorities leave these questions of personnel to the will of the tribes concerned, and usually do no more than recognize the individual whom the support and choice of the tribe puts in a position to handle the reins of government; and in this case Sheikh Sagar received recognition in due course. As soon as he had made sure of his position he addressed the Ilesident (on the 17th May, 1883) saying that he now proposed to expel Sheikh Salim from Abu Musa. In reply he was reminded that the Residency had in former years specifically notified to the Trucial Chiefs that the principles of the maritime truce must be held to apply to the islands as well as the seas of the Persian Gulf, and that he should consequently endeavour to arrange a peaceable settlement with his uncle. Simultaneously Sheikh Salim left Abu Musa for Lingah, and thence wrote to the Resident asking his good offices. He in turn was advised to remain in Lingah (it being more convenient for purposes of communication) until he could come to an understanding w^th Sheikh Sagar. Being in the weaker position Salim soon came to terms and a settlement guaranteed by the Sheikhs of Ras-el-Khaima and Debai was arrived at in July 1883, under which Sheikh Salim was to receive a pension of 600 dollars per annum for his maintenance. A copy of the settlement is attached. Sheikh Salim, however, found it difficult to refrain from intriguing against his nephew, in the hope, no doubt, of getting back the Sheikhdom. Thus, on the 21st January, 1884, Sheikh Sagar complained to the Resident of his uncle's conduct, and in the course of his letter he wrote ' At present you are aware that Salim resides on Bu Musa, which is an island dependent on Shargah, and I cannot spare it to others, and perhaps Salim may create some disturbance which may break the maritime peace, I beg, therefore, that you will kindly warn Salim and inform him that if he is desirous of living at Abu Musa he must do so peaceably, you being his guarantee that nothing wrong will be done by him of a nature to disturb the maritime peace. But should he not choose to obey it will be your choice either to remove him from the island or to leave us to settle the32 matter bolweoH, us, &lt;ind in that case we should not he called to account in the event of our attacking one another. I leave the matter to your disposition.' In reply the Sheikh was informed that if either unity broke the maritime peace he would be promptly repressed. ' About this time the Sheikhs of Ras-el-Khaima aud Debai also complained to the Resident against Sheikh Salim's violation of the Agreement, guaranteed as it had been by themselves. On the 14th February following Sheikh Sagar again wrote to the .Resident, politely urging that it was all very well for him to say that whoever broke the maritime peace, would be repressed, but reminding him that Abu Musa was his— Sheikh Sagar's property—a hereditary appanage of Shargah. He added ^ If Salim wants to live there and guarantees that he will not commit anything which would interfere with my affairs, or disturb the maritime peace, so be it; but I cannot dispense with this island, which is of the greatest use to me. I beg, theie- fore, that you will plainly write to me on the subject, and likewise instruct vour agent.' ' On this letter was recorded an office note to the following effect; — ■' Sheikh Sagar seems to insist that if Salim continues to live on Bu Musa he should give a guarantee through the Resident that he will not do anything to disturb him, Sheikh Sagar, or the maritime peace.' On the 5th April Sheikh Sagar wrote the Hesident another letter pressing for a reply to the above. Tie added that he had communicated his precise object in writing to the Residency Agent, who would explain it. This was that now that spring had arrived he wished to send his horses as usual for grazing, and was not sure whether hheikh Salim would leave them and their caretakers in peace. If the Resident would not allow him to make his own arrangements for ensuring safety of life and property on the island he wanted an assurance from the Residency that his stud would not be molested by Sheikh Salim. Sheikh Salim, however, who was now getting into financial straits, solved the difficulty himself. He made an appeal to the Residency alleging that Sheikh Sagar and the guarantors of the Agreement of 1883 had not stood by the terms of it; that they had taken away the State horses which as Sheikh of Shargah he had with him on the island when his nephew ousted him from the Sheikhdom, that he, Sheikh Salim, had had to sell all he possessed to maintain himself and now had nothing left,, and that he had now come to beg his nephew to provide him with the wherewithal for a bare living. He declared that if he got this he would remain in peace and quietude. Finally he begged our Agent to intercede for him, and to induce Sheikh Sagar to act up to the Agreement. By the advice of the Residency Agent. Sheikh Sagar, who had found the 600 dollars somewhat too much for his purse, consented to pay his uncle a reduced allowance of 400 dollars annually, half of which only was to be paid in cash and the other half in grain and other articles. He also promised to assign to Sheikh Salim the revenue of the Island of Sir Abu Nuair, which contained some salt deposits and was expected to bring in about 200 dollars more. A document in the above sense was drawn up at a meeting at Ajman and there ratified. When reporting the conclusion of this Agreement the Residency Agent mentioned that Sheikh Salim was at present going on a visit to Ras-el-Khaima and that his family would spend the hot weather there and the winter on Abu Musa. Things went on smoothly after this for a time, but the two Sheikhs eventually got at loggerheads again and in April 1889 our Agent reported that Salim had endeavoured to raise an attack on Shargah. On getting wind of his uncle's intentions Sheikh Sagar, as usual, asked the advice of the British Agent and the latter soon succeeded in bringing about a friendly meeting between the two resulting in the framing of a third Agreement in supercession of the preceding ones. This was to the following effect; Sheikh Sagar bound himself to pay his now aged uncle the 400 dollar pension regularly and to permit him to return to the mainland of Oman and to live where he pleased within certain limits. He also offered to take Sheikh Salim into his service as Yizier or chief adviser and to consult him in all matters affecting the interests of the State.. Sheikh Salim in turn under took to serve his nephew in obedience and loyalty. No mention was made of Sir Bu Nuair in this Agreement because it had hitherto disappointed previous expectations and had not brought in anything.83 .CLe above has nela good and no further documentary agreement has since been necessary, un the conclusion of it Sheikh Salim came lo live in Shargah as his nep icvv b adviser and for some years past the two have been the best of friends, so much so that when stjieikh Sagar leaves his head-quarters, which he not infrequently does, he always leaves his uncle to officiate in the Government of Shargah, as he did, tor instance, on his departure for the Mecca pilgrimage in 1897-8. It was on return from the said pilgrimage in 1898 that his uncle informed him of the grant of the Abu Musa Oxide Concession; when, in view of the fact that since the reduction of his pension from 600 to 400 dollars. Sheikh Salim had always been complaining of^ the paucity of his income, Sheikh Sagar as an act of generosity decided to let his uncle enjoy the 2o0 dollars annual rent fixed for the Concession and thereby cease to have cause for further discontent. '' rom first to last, howe ver, Sheikh Sagar's acquiescence in his uncle's enjoyment o! the produce and income of the island in question, has been purely a personaTand verbal arrangement^ which SheikE Sagar might, at any time, have terminated had he | chosen to do so. No deed whatever, according to the statements of the two Sheikhs themselves, has ever been given by Sheikh Sagar to his uncle in regard to this island, although the Island of Sir Abu Nuair did find mention in the second Agreement as above mentioned, dropping out again in the third and last because it had never brought in any income. Stronger proof of the status of the island could hardly be wanted than the declarations furnished by the two Sheikhs themselves. (Signed) P. Z. COX. February 28, 1908. No. 7.

No Agreement between us and Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh took place, and no document in writing was executed upon that subject. With regard to Abu Musa, my uncle Sheikh Salim-bin-Sultan cultivates in that island, and in the year in which I went on the Hajj, my aforesaid uncle was acting as my regent ('kaim muqam ') in Shargah, and he saw fit to lease the mines of Abu Musa to Hassan-bin-Samayieh, a British subject, and Abdallah-bin-Hassan and Esa-bin- Abdul Latif, and the lease has remained up to now. I think your agent Abdul Latif must have informed you about it. This is what had to be written. No. 8. Sheikh Sagar- bin-K ha lid Samayieh. [Inclosure 12 of German Case.] (Translation.)

I have to inform you that Esa-bin-A.bdul Latif has preferred a complaint to me in connection with the red oxide mines on Abu Musa, which for some years have been leased in the names of yourself and Esa-bin-Abdul Latif and your son Abdullah, according to the deed executed on the 18th Zilkaideh, 1315 (21st April, 1899). He has sent me a copy of the deed of contract in operation between you and M. Wonckhaus, and complains that you executed this contract without consulting him, and that lie does not agree to the conditions written in the contract now that he has come to know them. I, too, do not agree to this contract at all, and as for you, you had no right to give a contract in this fashion and bind yourself to give away possession of the whole output of red oxide to others for a long period and without consulting us or making the slightest reference to us. And, according to our view, harm will accrue to us from the continuance of this Concession in your hands in connection [1598] K34 with Abu Musa; and your conduct in tlie present case is a violation of your duty towards us. Accordingly it appears to us advisable to withdraw the document of Concession from you, and we now inform you accordingly by this letter, so that you mar realize that the contract between us has terminated. You have no longer any right of enjoyment in regard to the mines of Abu Musa. (Seal of Sheikh Sagar-bin-KhaM.) No. 9. Translation of the o Be it known to all who may see this that I.

Mr. Bobert Wonckhaus agrees to take at least every year 2,000 tons, and if he wants so and there is sufficient good stuff on the island of which he approves up to 5,000 tons yearly. The price is fixed at 15s. 6d. (fifteen shillings and six pence) per ton of 20 cwts., usual weight conditions, freight and charge free on board steamer Bu Musa, to be weighed on board. Hassan C. Semey gives the entire monopoly of Bu Musa oxide to B.obert Wonckhaus during the terms of the contract; he is not allowed to sell or dispose of otherwise any quantity of Bu Musa during the terra of this contract, but it is agreed upon that Hassan is permitted to export to India for his account during this year what he has sold already to India, and which he gives as 700 tons (seven hundred) and besides that every year from 1907 about 5—-6,000 bags of 1 cwt.

As regards the agreement which we have made with Wonckhaus, the German, for the sale of red oxide, I have to tell you that we settled with him that 2,000 tons should be shipped every year, and that if we got out more than that he would be a taker of it. I have settled the price with him at 155. per ton, and we have to bear all the expenses and deliver the oxide on board the steamers. Praise be to God, this is a godsend, and will make up for the past. The arrangement will continue for four years, and I have taken from him an advance of 2,000 rupees. He has made conditions with us for the shipment of 200 or 150 tons per diem. The work begins from the 1st June, 1006, and I have written to my son Abdullah to settle his affairs (in India), at any rate, and to come and supervise the work. I have sent labourers to the island, and we shall have in any ease to buy more donkeys for transportation. I hope that, once begun, the work will go on regularly. * No. 12. Abdul Latif to H [Inclosure 6 of German Case.] (After compliments.) Sfiarg llaln 1324 14., 1906). I have received your former and later favours and was glad to hear of vour welfare. As to your remarks on the subject of the red oxide in regard to which God decreed that you sold it to the German Wonckhaus at 15s. per ton, and whereas it was arranged that you should excavate 2,000 tons per annum, all the charges to be defrayed by you, and he to receive the oxide nett. Very good; I hope it is auspicious. It will be good fortune after trouble. In any case, our brother Abdullah must reach there to supervise the work, because I think the operations cannot be regulated without him. Piease, however, refrain from entering upon any arrange ments whatever in, the nature of leases or deeds of contract from 'which there will arise difficulties and quarrels which will Igad to complaints and claims, because this will be difficult for our over-lords and they will not consent to it; and you are by God's grace wise and will not commit any negligence or hesitation likely to entangle you, because in these days everyone is making a trap with which to entangle people. I hope you will not be neglectful in this regard. At any rate 1 am glad to hear this news, if we are safe from this world's tricks more than before.36 No. 16. HassanSarnayteh (After compliments.) Ling ah, 13, 1906, I have received your esteemed letter dated tlie 26tli June and perused it gladly and understood what you had stated. You had acknowledged receipt of my letter the contents of which you had understood. As regards the sale to the German, it is satisfactory, and I hope it will be fortunate. You had understood the details regarding the sale, shipment, and boat- hire, hut you did not let me know about the commission; is it to be charged by us from them or by them from us? You had written that I should send you a copy of the agreement. Very well, but the agreement has been written in German, and there is no one with us who can write such a hand. The purport of the agreement is accurately the same as I have written to you. You had written to me whether we had contracted with the German for 2,000 tons per annum. Yes, we have contracted with him that the quantity should be 2,000 tons at least, and he can, according to the agreement take any more quantities which we may be able to obtain from the mines. You had written whether we can obtain more than this quantity, and if so, whether we can contract with other Europeans, so that you may negotiate with them. I have understood this, but I cannot give the accurate quantity unless the mine is worked for two or three months when I will be able to form an idea. I dispatched forty-five workmen to the island in the beginning of June, but little work is done, it being summer and the days being hot. If more than 2,000 tons are obtained, the German is bound to take it from us. We can therefore make no other contract. I beg also to inform you that my son Abdulla has sold about 400 tons more or less at Calcutta. Only the freight is to be paid by us, every maund will be 1 r. 9 a. delivery at Calcutta. I have been trying to procure a vessel since a long time. I have now-a-days chartered ' Alimghir,' the vessel belonging to the sons of Khoja (to ship red oxide) at 10 rupees per ton. It is now several days that she has gone to the island to ship (the oxide). Thank God my son Abdulla has freed himself from the dispute at Calcutta. He has compromised with them. He has come to Bombay, and I will receive his letter from Bombay by this mail, if God pleases. I hope he will not be detained there, and that he will settle his case with Jeita Bania and come to our parts soon. No. 14. Hassan Samayieh to (Translation.) Ling ah, 23rd 1324 14, 1906). I have received your letter dated the 20th December, 1906, and was glad to hear of your well-being. I have understood what you stated. Regarding my son Abdulla, I beg to say that after settling the case at Calcutta he has arrived at Bombay, where he has some easy matters to settle with the Bania. He will settle his account and will leave for our parts in two or one and a-half months. You had remarked that you had asked some one in the post-office to take from me a copy of the document, which is in German. Let it not be hidden from you that the German, when the bargain was concluded with him, said to me that this transaction should be kept secret (' Yekoon Mastoor '), and so I did not wish that any outsider should come to know of it, and I fear that if news of the copying of the document reaches his ears he will be annoyed. In truth, it is not my intention that anyone should come to know about it except myself and you. What you wanted, namely, the details of the sale which had taken place' I have already communicated to you in a previous letter. Procedure will be according to that letter, neither more nor less, in pursuance of what is written in the document.37 No. 15. Hassan Samayieh (After compliments.) Ling ah, 27 ih 1324 16, 1906). I wrote to you previously. I hope the letter reached you, and that you are well. Now I forward, inclosed in this letter, a copy of the Agreement regarding the sale of oxide to Wonckhaus, a copy made according to the original. Please acknow ledge receipt. _ _ 4 Our news is quiet, I have nothing deserving of mention except to say all well.

Abdul Latif to Has [Inclosure 8 of German Case.] (After compliments.) 1324 23, 1907). I have received your esteemed letter and understood wimt yon stated.^ 1 nave understood the copy of the Agreement concluded by you with the German for the »ile of the Abu Musa red oxide. My son Esa does not agree to the execution of an Agreement to this effect, and you had neither consulted with, nor referred to him, nor did you sena him a copv of the Agreement before the settlement with the German of the affair concerning the red oxide, so that views might be exchanged between you both, and that you might adopt a recognized, obvious, and evident course, because it is obligatory for the partners not to undertake a matter except after a general consensus of views, so that no difficulties may occur, and you have undertaken this affair without any consultation. , , ; Therefore my son Esa does not agree to the Agreement concluded between jou and the'German, because .he fears difficulty will result from foreigners concerning- themselves in the matter. The nullification of this Agreement is better than its acaptance^ad previously rece i ve a a letter (from me) saying that you should not involve yourself into difficulties with the German in regard to the red oxide, because he (Esa) fears an untoward result. I communicate to you what my son Esa says. No. 17. Abdul Latif to Hass [Inclosure 10 of German Case.] (After compliments.) _ 12//&amp; loiS 27, x907). Your esteemed letter has reached me in due course, and i have notea its contents. When your communication reached me saying that you had sold to the German before mentioned oxide from Abu Musa, every year 2,000 tons of oxide at 15s. per ton, I sent you back an answer, dated the 21st llabi II, 1324, which purported to convey acquiescence, but in the course of the same letter I cautioned you against entering into any agreement in the nature of a leasehold or into any relation likely to result m dispute, orTthe grounds that the overlords of our affairs would not agree to it. I asked you to 'ive us immunity against the complications of the world (time). My letter in question is no doubt with vou. Since writing it I have never received from you the oiyy of tie deed of agreement existing between you and the German until the 5th Zilkaadeh, 1324, when it came in English after I had asked you for it time after J| time I mentioned its arrival to you in my letter of the fthZilkaadgh. 132 k And when ' we got a' franslater and translated the English document, it became plain to us that vouhad launched yourself into the very thing against which we had cautioned you and had tied yourself up by giving a lease. Consequently, my son Esa does not agree to [15S81 ^.eX ^ //J&gt;38 s ins document which does not leave you any power of control or modification in regard to the oxide mmes of Abu Musa. And previous to this present communication I communicated to you in my letter dated 8th Zilhijjeh a translation of the deed for youi information and said that yon would perceive that the question was not one of mei*e sale as stated by you, but one of leasehold, against which I had warned you. Moreover, Sheikh Sagar does not agree to the lease of the oxide to outsiders from ioreign Powers and claims that the agreement (with him) was that vou should do the work yourselves and not farm it out. This is what had to be explained. No. 18. Rough purport of a Petition from Nejef-bin-AU, Lieutenant Gabriel, date 16, 1908. (After compliments.) 1 • ^ iy i atlier - for SOme 7 ears performed service for the British, and as Hail Hassan- follows majr ' of kingah, is a British subject, I therefore petition to you as concerning the Abu Musa oxide, for which there were four concessionnaires among whom I hold the deed of partnership of my father. My father had no other heir but myself, and therefore after his death Haji Hassan-bin-Ali acknowledged my right of partnership as acquired through my father. At the time when Hassan entered into the agreement with Messrs. Wonckhaus be gave me no information what ever on the subject. ^ Subsequently I made an arrangement with Haji Amin-ut-Tuiiar to sell him oxide and sent word to Hassan to this effect. Hassan then wrote me that lie had made a contract elsewhere, and would inform me regarding it later. As proof that T did not in any way agree to this contract made by Hassan, I point to the fact that it aid not bear my signature, and when, some months later, Abdullah-bin-Hassan and the German Munshi came and asked me to sign it in token of assent, I refused to do so, as I had not been consulted in the first place. As further proof of my right in the Concession, I may mention that in 1901 Abdullah-bin-Hassan had a case in Calcutta against Messrs. Sassoon concerning the .Abu Musa oxide, but seeing that the oxide had been sold in the name ot my father, the case could not be proceeded with until I had furnished a power of attorney fpr the Calcutta Court—a copy of this is doubtless on your Consulate records, (Note by His Britannic Majesty's Consul: The consulate fee-book shows that Nejef paid 5s. feCs for the execution of a power of attorney on the -9th October, 1904.)

Foreign Office to India Office. _ Foreign Office, Novemher 8, 1910- \\ ^ erence ln y letter, marked immediate, of the 25t!i January last, I am dnected by Secretary Sir E. Grey to state, for tlie information of the Secretary of State 1( ^ L l n dia, that ne has nad under consideration the second memorandum of the (reiman tToyemment, enclosed in a note dated the 4th December, 1909, from the German Ambassador, on the subject of the cancellation of the red oxide concession at Abu Musa. Sir jl . Grey has always intended to postpone detailed criticism of the German case until after careful local enquiries have been made reg*arding the new and important evidence now brought forward by the German Government: in view, however, of the fact that the British resident in the Persian Gulf has been unable, as stated in ins telegram of the 2/th September, to make satisfactory progress in the collection of evidence, and inasmuch as the question of delay cannot fail to have an important bearing upon the amount of compensation which may be payable as damages,-—a period of nine months having already elapsed since the date of my letter of the 25th January, Sir E. Grey considers that it may be expedient to lay before the Earl of Crewe certain observations in regard to a possible settlement of the question in dispute. Sir E. Grey does not now propose to review the circumstances which led up to the cancellation of the lease by the Sheikh of Shargah : but he considers, for reasons which are fully set forth in printed minutes of w r hich copies were furnished to your department in the month of February last, that His Majesty's Government might safely make an offer to the German Government to give Messrs, Woenckhaus and Co. the samb position that they held under their contract of June 1906 commercially, if means can be devised that will safeguard British political interests. He further considers that Messrs. Woenckhaus' claim is valid in so far as it relates to the loss sustained in consequence of Hassan Samaiyeh's breach of contract to sell the output of the oxide mines at a fixed price per ton ; this breach of contract is due to the cancellation of the concession by the Sheikh of Shargah ; and the German Government have apparently full knowledge that the sheikh acted with the approval, and indeed at the instigation of His Majesty's Government. In these circumstances Sir E. Grey is disposed to think that proposals to the German Government on the following lines might possibly meet the requirements of the situation ; but, inasmuch as the Government of India is primarily concerned, more especially in regard to the payment of compensation, these proposals are of course subject to the ultimate decision of Lord Crewe :— -1; Ihe Sneikh of Shargah to grant a new concession to Hassan Samaiyeh and Abdul Latif (the son of the former, Abdulla ben Hassan being excluded for personal reasons urged by Colonel Cox) of oxide mining rights on Abu Musa, so as to enable them to carry out their contract with Messrs. Woenckhaus, 2. The amount of damages suffered by Messrs. Woenckhaus through the inter ruption of the contract to be referred to some British tribunal, and the amount to be x &gt;aid through His Majesty's Government on behalf of the Government of India. In order to safeguard the Sheikh of Shargah, the new T concession under 1 would have to provide that no share in the enterprise w^as to be transferred to another person without the sheikh's consent, and should also give him access to the books of the company and control over the working of the mines: the partners in the previous concession, xip to the date of its cancellation, being all British subjects, it could fairly be claimed that the terms of the new concession do not affect the German Government, who are merely concerned with the execution of Messrs. Woenckhaus' contract. [2988 h—1] [November 8.] Section LIf the German Government were to decline to accept tliese proposal.-', His Majesty's Government might with greater facility take the line that the right of the sheikh to cancel a concession held by British subjects was not a matter which they could consent to submit to arbitration, while the injury caused to Messrs. Woenckhaus by the failure of a British subject to carry out his contract was a matter which could be adequately dealt with before the judicial tribunals, a course for which His Majesty's Government would provide every facility. In. conclusion, I am to express Sir E. Grey's confident hope that Lord Crewe will accept the view that the payment of damages will devolve not upon His Majesty's Government but upon the Government of India: the original action of the British resident, in his capacity as agent of the Government of India, was taken under the instructions of that Government ;f while the delay which has arisen in preparing the replies to the German notes is iirTio case due, as will appear from a comparison of dates, to this department, where, botli in 1908 and in February of the present year, the titmost promptitude was manifested, t I am, &amp;c.

Minutes respecting Ahu Mum, MAJOR COX. paid me a visit yesterday, and, as the result of our conversation, and of a further examination of the recent German memorandum, and of the earlier papers in tne case, I cannot help feeling that Sir E. Grey would be well advised to make an attempt to settle the dispute by a compromise. The more one goes into the case, the iess s it seems to me, is it worth fighting about ; the longer the dispute goes on. the larger the bill for damages that His Maiesty's Government will in the end have to pay. 2. i he valid part of Wonckhaus's claim is that for compensation for the loss he has sustained by reason of Hassan Samaiyeh's breach of his contract to sell to him the output of the oxide mines on the island at a fixed price per ton, Hassan Samaiyeh broke his contract because the sheikh cancelled the concession which Hassan and his partners held. The Germans know quite well that the sheikh cancelled that concession with the approval, if not at the instigation^ of the representatives of His Britannic Majesty, and therefore the German Government take up Wonckhauss claim, and put it forward as one which His Majesty's Government are bound to pay. 3. The object in view r in getting the concession cancelled by the sheikh was political : it was to prevent Germany, through Wonckhaus ; from getting a monopoly and foothold in the Island of Abu Musa, which might have been pushed and developed into a political occupation. That object has been achieved, but another consequence has also resulted, viz., that Wonckhaus has been prevented from trading in the oxide, and to such trading there need be no objection on political grounds. 4. If the British representatives in the Persian Gulf had known all that they know now about the contract with Wonckhaus, it would not have been necessary for the sheikh to cancel the concession : it would have been sufficient for him to supervise the carrying out of the mining operations on the islands by the partnership, so as to make quite sure that Germany did not gradually achieve the actual occupation of the mine, and subsequently of the island. 5. It seems to me, therefore, that we might quite safely make an offer to the German Government to give Wonckhaus the same position that he held under his contract commercially, if means can be devised that will safeguard our political interests. 6. 1 think that an offer on the following lines would fulfil the above require ments (1») The sheikh to grant a new concession to Hassan and his two foraier colleagues - of the oxide mining rights on Abu Musa, so as to enable them to carry out the Wonckhaus contract. The concession would be to the partnership as constituted at the time of the contract, thereby excluding the individual (Brown) who purchased a share on behalf of Wonckhaus after the cancellation of the concession by. the sheikh. 7. (2.) A reference to some British judicial tribunal as to the amount of damages suffered by Wonckhaus through the interruption of his contract, and payment of such sum by His Majesty's Government. It is most desirable to avoid the fixing of this sum through the diplomatic channel. 8. To safeguard the sheikh (and also His Majesty's Government), the new concession under (I) would have to provide that no share in the enterprise was to be transferred to another person without the sheikh's consent, and should also give him access to the books and control over the mode of working the mines. The partners in the previous concession (including Brown, who bought after the cancellation) are all British subjects, so that we can fairly claim that the terms of the new concession are no concern whatever of Germany's, and that all that she is concerned with is the carrying out of the Wonckhaus contract.. 9. As to the tribunal before which the amount of the damages w^ould be fought out under (2), I think the best course would be to send up one of the judges from either Zanzibar or Constantinople ; this might entail the passing of an order in [2643 d—l\ Bcouncil, but I think that would be imm aterial. Major Cox presides in the senior couit on the coasts of the Persian Gulf, but he has already been concerned in the case in other capacities, and the Germans would be entitled to object to the matter being settled by him. . . . 10. The^ offer of such a settlement, proceeding as it does on commercial lines, will probably not be very welcome to Germany, whose object is, no doubt, to drag the political aspects to the front. At the same time it would not be easy for her to find adequate grounds for refusing it, and if she did refuse it she would, 1 thims;, be in a less favourable position for fighting the case afterwards, as it would render it easier for His Majesty's Government to take the line that the right of the sheikh to cancel a concession held by British subjects was certainly not a matter which Great Britain could consent to arbitrate with Germany at The Hague, and that the injury caused to Wonckhaus by the failure of a British subject to carry out his contract was a matter which could be adequately dealt with before the judicial tribunals, a course tor which His Majesty's Government would provide every facility. 11. The advantage of compromising the dispute, if it can be done, on the imes suggested above, instead of relying solely on the grounds set out in the preceding paragraph, is that His Majesty's Government will in any case have to pay the compensa tion, and that it will considerably reduce the amount if it only represents damages for three years' interruption, instead of damages for total and permanent breach oi the contract. Furthermore, it is desirable for the sake of the sheikh that mining opera tions should be resumed as soon as possible, and unless arrangements are going to be made to enable the Wonckhaus contract to be carried out, the mining must be put into the hands of some British firm, and it would look as if our object had been to crush German trade rather than to prevent Germany acquiring political interests. As Major Cox is in London, I think it would be a good thing to ascertain whether he thinks a compromise on these lines would be desirable, and, f so, whether it is feasible, C. J. B. H.

Notes hy Major Cox respecting I STUDIED the German rejoinder on receipt, and after reducing my ideas to writing provisionally, I discussed it informally with Mr. Hurst, and have now received his minute for comment. I should wish to mention in the first instance that when I was in Tehran in November, Count Quadt, the German Minister, went out of his way to be gracious and hospitable to me, and in the course of one of several informal conversations which we had, he referred incidentally to the Abu Musa case. I took the opportunity of assuring him then that there had never been any desire on the part of the Sheikh of Shargah or the British residency at Bushire (as my present German colleague at Bushire seemed persuaded was the case) to prevent Wonckhaus altogether from trading in Abu Musa oxide, and I expressed my regret personally, as a local official, that the dispute had assumed such protracte'd proportions. He in turn asked me to accept his emphatic personal assurances that in taking up Wonckhaus's ease his Government had had no political motive whatever, but simply desired to3 secure for their trade and traders a fair field and no favour. I replied that those two premises being recognised, it would seem quite possible to settle the case speedily by some friendly compromise, and that 1 hoped that this course would be attempted. Count ^ Quadt professed to be surprised and pleased to know that as local official I did ijCc- hold tiiat view ? and joined in the hope that the controversy would find settlement in that way. Count Quadt is habitually fair in speech, but is believed to be not quite so amicably inclined in practice, and the fact that the German rejoinder, presented two months later, offers no suggestion of compromise, makes it possible that they may not prove amenable to a speedy give.-and-take settlement; but I have thought it as well to mention the above conversation, as it was in a similar frame of mind as regards the question of compromise that I approached the present German communication and subsequently discussed the position with Mr. Hurst. Before commenting on points of the latter s minute, I beg to offer some preliminary observations from my own point of view upon the general tenor of the German rejoinder of the 3rd January, 1910. Detailed comment I have recorded separately. They have evidently taken a great deal of trouble over it, and it reads well if read by itself; but if it is examined by the light of what has gone before on the record, it will be found, I think, that most of the arguments used are simply repetition, and are already answered, while the fresh evidence adduced is either impugnable, or does not seriously affect the principal grounds of our case. They quote one document (to which I refer in a separate memorandum of detailed comment hereto attached)—-the grant of a lease of mica or gypsum deposits by Salim—which y if in order and known to the ruling sheikh, would show that Salim made grants as tenant at will, as well as qua regent, but none of the German arguments appear to me to shake our contention that Balim was not the private owner either of the island or the mines, but simply enjoyed the usufruct at the ruling sheikh's will, and subject to resumption at any moment. When we first took up this case with the G-erman Government we endeavoured to insist on the premise that it was for the present purely commercial in its aspect; that Wonckhaus should put in his claim against Hassan, or the concessionnaires generally, for breach of contract; and that until he had taken that course there was no justifica tion« for going behind the commercial elements of the case and bringing it on to political ground. I hope we can still maintain this attitude. It is clear, however, from the present German communication that they are anxious to push the political aspect of the case as much as they can, with an appeal to The Hague if they do not get what they want—-a proceeding which would delay settlement indefinitely. In fact s appear to have arrived precisely in the position anticipated in my despatch of the*28th December, 1907, from the Foreign Office to the India Office, the paragraph commencing a If the German Government argue that the legality of the sheikh's action would be very suitable matter to refer to arbitration, . . . .' I beg reference to that despatch, and presume that were the dispute to be pursued on existing lines we should adopt one of the alternative courses of action adumbrated in the paragraphs following the passage above quoted ; and that we should ultimately agree to grant or get Wonckhaus some compensation, either from Hassan Samaiyeh or the concessionnaires as a whole, or from the sheikh, as we might feel called upon. The object of the sheikh and ourselves was, not to prevent Wonckhaus from trading in Abu Musa oxide, but to prevent his getting a monopoly and a footing on the island; and to gain this object it was foreseen that compengation might have to be paid ; and no doubt it will; but our original purpose, the prevention of a monopoly and of German interference on Abu Musa Island, will have been attained. It seems to me that we cannot possibly admit the validity of the colourable transfer of a share in the concession itself (after cancellation) to Wonckhaus, and a consequent right of Wonckhaus to sue the sheikh as one of the concessionnaires. To concede this would be to concede that the cancellation by the sheikh was invalid and greatly to weaken and complicate our case. But in any case it is clear that if the controversy is pursued on the lines hitherto employed, the preparation of a detailed reply to the present German rejoinder will occupy many weeks, if not several months; while it' the case is ulti- mktelv taken to The Hague, years may elapse before final settlement is arrived at. Meanwhile, the oxide industry from Abu Musa will be suspended, Salim and SheikhSagar will continue to be deprived of all income from the island, and their attitude will become sulky and difficult. It is submitted that the case is at present no subject for reference to The Hague, and is solvable by commercial settlement or compromise. Count Metternichs communication to His Majesty's Foreign Office, dated the 4th December, 1909, claims that— . 1. Wonckhaus should be compensated for damage sustained by non-fulfilment of his contract with Hassan. 2. The firm of Wonckhaus and Co. deserve compensation as shareholders in the mining concession for loss suffered by suspension of their operations. Perhaps the position could be discussed with the German Embassy on some such lines as the following :— We should in the first instance again press the view that the case is essentially a a commercial one ; that there has never been any desire to prevent Wonckhaus trading in the oxide ; and that if the settlement of the dispute continues to be sought on the deliberate methods hitherto employed, months, if not years, must elapse before it is laid to rest; meanwhile the pecuniary interests of all concerned, will sutler, and a chronic element of friction will continue to exist. His Majesty's Government are most anxious to obviate this, as, no doubt, the German Government are also, and they suggest that an expeditious settlement of the case be sought in the interests of all parties. His Majesty's Government agree that whether or not Hassan Samaiyeh had the power to enter into such a transaction, and although the secretive tactics employed by the German firm naturally laid them under suspicion, Messrs. Wonckhaus could not be blamed for obtaining such a contract as that executed on the 1st June, 1906, and would no doubt be entitled to receive relief in the shape of compensation from some source for any bond fide loss which he could prove before the judicial tribunal concerned to have suffered by the non-fulfilment of the said contract by the contractors. All the parties who might conceivably be held, alternatively, to be liable to pay such compensation to Messrs. Wonckhaus are under British protection, and His Majesty's Government will be prepared to take measures to recover such amounts as the said court may hold to be due. Then would come the question of the precise terms to be offered, and I am brought to Mr. Hurst's minute. He goes considerably further than I should have felt able to recommend myself. I think the points on which our views diverge, or in regard to which 1 have any suggestion to make, will be shown most conveniently if I take the liberty of numbering his paragraphs and commenting on them seriatim. Comment on Mr. Paragraph 1.—I agree. Paragraph2 {last clause). —We have informed the Germans that we considered the sheikh's action justified, but ostensibly we do not accept responsibility for it, and I suppose vis-d-ms the German Government we should maintain that, attitude and ostensibly ' recover' compensation rather than ' pay ' it. Paragraph 3.—Our original objects as understood by myself and the Government of India were— 1. To prevent Wonckhaus getting a monopoly. 2. To prevent him getting a footing in. the island. His Majesty's Government, however, decided not to raise the monopoly question, I have elsewhere ventured to inquire whether this point could be reconsidered, as, if we do not use the argument, the Sheikh of Shargah's action is less defensible. Paragraph 4.—The cancellation of the contract to Wonckhaus, or its revision so as to exclude monopoly, might have been sufficient in the first instance, but the German firm would, I think, have opposed that just as much as the cancellation of the con cession. ; as shown by their action in getting a share in the concession to strengthen their right to protect the contract. Paragraph 5.— The ' same position,' except that it must exclude any right to a monopoly of the output. We cannot afford to ignore this question of monopoly. It is true that Wonckhaus43 Las been able to ao little good with the oxide hitherto, partly from inexperience of the Tt^nr^vir^'?on P tSf P 1 S ' m S ettin g an indifferent lot for his last shipment.

He could not be expected to grant it for the equivalent of 20/. per annum as at present. 1 Paragraph7.—According to my idea, the compensation would be 'recovered' ,' ' V ' i!tin , paid oy His Majesty s Government, but I realise the convenience and es-.ra -lui-y drawn attention toby Mr. Hurst, ol having the compensation fixed iudicially rather than diplomatically. Paragraph 8. I agree ; but I suggest that it should be stipulated that concession- naires shou^.i nave no authority to sell a monopoly of the output. Paragraph 9.—It is most important, in my judgment, not to let this dispute be removed at any stage from the sphere of jurisdiction of the Government of India and tneii iepreseni-ativb, qua,resident in the Gulf, to which it, properlv speaking, belongs, r or tins reason the High Court of Bombay seems indicated as the tribunal whose iunction it would be to depute a judicial officer to try the case. Paragraph 10.—My views coincide with Mr. Hurst's. The refusal by Germany ota fair commercial settlement or compromise would greatly operate in our favour in the event of the dispute going to The Hague. . t a ragrayh- II (vide Paragraph 6).—As I have said, the prospect of the concession going back to these same concessionnaires is an unpleasant one, and will not, I think, be p^lata 5He to the skeikh 3 but I cannot deny the force of Mr, Hurst's observations in this paragraph. I trust, however, that in any case it will be possible to eliminate Abdalla. 1 ■_ the suggestions oi Mr. Hurst and myself in the direction of commercial settle ment or compromise nre to any extent entertained, I would venture to suggest that the precise lines which the wording of the new concession and contract might 0 follow should be discussed verbally—by departmental representatives in consultation—and then resubmitted for consideration. P OOX February 12, 1910. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Messrs. F. G.Strick a Dear Major Cox, 8, 1910. REFERRING to my conversation with you a few days ago, I have now had an opportunity ot going into our correspondence with Messrs. A. and T. J. Malcolm, of Bushire, during 1906 and 1907, from which it would appear that early in 1906 Haji Hassan Ben^ Ali Sumaya sold to Messrs, Robert Wonckhaus and Co. a parcel of about 700 tons of Abu Musa oxide, which was bagged and shipped from the island to Kurrachee, where it was transhipped for Hamburg, I believe, in some of the Hamburg- American Line steamers (see copy of A. and T. J. Malcolm's letter of the 28th April 1906, herewith enclosed).* * Not printed. [2643 d—1] c6 As the above shipment proved to be of good quality, and conu^an*. \ ; ween at about 55s. per ton c.i.f. Hamburg, a contract was made m June ' A ' i •_ Sumaya and Wonckhaus (copy of which I enclose^) whereby the former ^ ^ and tlie latter to purchase, a minimum quantity of 2,000 tons, ana a maximum ' , J, 5,000 tons of oxide per annum, over a period ot four years, the basis o 6 l ,' Tr ,„ T1 f i that the quality of the mineral was to be equal to that of the 700 ^ ® Against this contract two shipments were made, viz., about boO to 1, _ the ' Teutonia' in July 1907, and about 1,800 tons by the steamship Louise m April 1908. As the former vessel foundered on her homeward voyage, 1 snail omy ^&lt;1- with the parcel brought by the steamer ' Louise. . So far as I have been able to gather, after a lapse of two years, there is stm a stock of some 700 tons now lying at Hamburg, which Messrs Trauen, feturken, ana .o., the agents for Messrs. Wonckhaus, find considerable difficulty m selling, even m very small quantities, owing to the quality being in every way inferior to the trial shipmen. above referred to, being much darker in colour, and having on.y a dou ^ pei ce i, v. .. . its staining power. They are now offering this stock at about 48s. f.o.b. Hamburg without finding buyers. ^ ^ , In my opinion, which has been confirmed by one ox the largest puyers, -ne difference in value between the trial shipment and standard Ormuz quality is aoout 12s. 6ci. per ton. Consequently the best quality _ Abu Musa wmud ^e wor n (theoretically) about 30s. per ton f.o.b., as compared with Ormuz oxide at 42s. per Presuming that the oxide could be shipped equal in quality to the trial parcel it would, in my opinion, to a considerable extent supplant Ormuz oxicle, in view of the fact that its cost f.o.b. is about 27s. per ton less than the price of the latter; and it should be borne in mind that the annual consumption of this class ot oxiae m Europe and America does not exceed 6,500 to 7,000 tons. ^ . 3 In conclusion, as regards Abu Musa, the position 3 as I understand it, is brieiky as follows: — Had the mineral shipped by Sumaya been equal in every respect to the trial shipment, the contract would have been of considerable value to Messrs. vV onckhaus, as the mineral could have been delivered, c.i.f., Hamburg at about 31s. and sold at about 55s. per ton, or a net profit of, say, 24s. per ton ; but, with the primitive methods of mining adopted by Sumaya, it is very doubtful whether he coula have supplied the desired quality. With regard to Ormuz, as far as I have been able to ascertain, there is still a stock at Avonmouth of about 1,500 to 2,000 tons; and if to this is added ^ the shipment of about 5,000 tons now being made by the steam-ship ' Cliftonian,' it brings up the total supplies to about 6,500 to 7,000 tons, which quantity is sufficient, apart from any possible'competition from Abu Musa, to satisfy the trade in Germany, England, and America for over twelve months. Doubtless a great deal of the foregoing, being ancient history, will not be of much interest to you, but T think no harm can be done by laying the whole position as clearly as I can before you. Yours sincerely, FRANK C. STRICK. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Sketch of the Ahu Musa Case from its commenc 1910, with comment on Germa Rejoinder. Phase I.— The Events and Grounds which und Shargah in withdrawing IN the summer of 1906 the intention of the Hamburg-Amerika line to enter into competition for the carrying trade to the Persian Gulf at an early date became known. In June 1906, about the same time, a report emanating from a British newspaper correspondent in Constantinople was published, to the effect that Germany was * Not printed.i cegotiatrng with the Porte for the lease of the little-known Island of Halool in the Persian Gult, with tne mea ol placing a coaling dep6t there. As tending n show that the report might have some foundation, it was remarked that curiously ^enough Halool was the only one among the numerous islets in the Gulf to wtncn turkey could conceivably base a colourable claim, from the fact that the mamlanu nearest to the island was the coast of Katar, on which the Porte keep a small gamson (at A1 Bida), though we have always declined to recognise their iuris- diction there. ' o J I understaiia that^ any such design as that suggested was denied by the German press 01 Government ; m any case, the publicity given to the matter had the effect of nipping any possible intrigue in the bud. A tew weeks^aiter the above incident, news was received of the grant by Hassan feamaiyeh to the German firm of an exclusive contract in connection with the Abu Musa oxide concession. co ^ amumca twig the facts, as far as they were then known, to the Government of India, I expressed the view that the grant of a monopoly without limit of time gave the bheikh of Shargah reasonable grounds for withdrawing the concession, and that althougn the Abu JVxusa oxide might not prove to be of great commercial value, it was politically important to prevent the creation by Germany of vested interests in the Gulf, sucn as this oxide monopoly might prove to be. The Government of India were L | ie same opinion, ana, apart from the commercial aspect of the question, took count of the fact that where oxide could be conveniently stored and shipped, there coal could be handled with equal facility. •A- 8 a matter ot tact, the contingency of Germany acquiring a coaling station in the Gulf and her right to do so if she wished were frankly alluded to in the German press in connection with this dispute (vide Berlin Embassy despatch No. 553, dated the 27th December, 1907). I would emphasise the fact that there was never any desire altogether to prevent the German firm from trading in Abu Musa oxide in competition with others. All that was objected to was the acquisition by Wonckhaus of a monopoly and of rights in the mines themselves; and these latter rights they claimed. It was with the idea of preventing these two possible contingencies that the Sheikh of Shargah. on learning the state ot the case, decided to cancel the concession. He was the more inclined to do this by the fact that he had already nearly lost the island on a previous occasion through the^ action of the Belgian Director of Persian Customs at Bushire, who had endeavoured to hoist a flag and instal a customs post there on behalf of the Persian Government. _ The grounds which the sheikh put forward in intimating to Hassan the cancellation ot tne lease were fcnat the nature of the contract given to AV onckhaus involved a monopoly. It was consequently such as he had no right to give, at all events without first consulting himself (the ruling Sheikh of Shargah) and the third partner, Esa; that the said partner did not agree ; and that he himself objected to the nature of the contract. Phase II.— The original German Statement 31, 1907. It is to bfe noted that before presenting their claim to us on behalf of Wonckhaus the German Government apparently attempted to get the Persian Government to claim sovereignty over the Island of Abu*Musa. The salient issues raised in their claim were :— Issue (a). —That the mines were owned by Sheikh Salim personally and had been leased by him in his own right. Issue (5).—That the concession had been approved by the ruling Sheikh of Shargah, and that the terms of it were such that the latter had no power to cancel it. Issue (c).—That the subsidiary contract of the 1st June, 1906, for the sale of oxide passed by Hassan to W onckhaus did not require the sheikh's approval. Issue(d). —That the said contract had the approval of the third partner, Esa. Issue (e).-—That the sheikh's illegal action had injured Wimckhaus, not only as buyer of oxide, but as partner in the mining concession, they having purchased a share in it. In the latter capacity the German firm claimed compensation, not from the Concessionnaires, but as one of the concessionnaires from the Sheikh of Shargah.Phase III,— British Reply to German 10, 1908. In reply to the German claim we contended:— Issue [a) .—That the mines were not the private property of Saiim, nor had he leased them in his own right of private owner, but in his capacity as regent. Issue (b). —We agreed that the concession, or permit, was approved by the ruling sheikh, but maintained that it was terminable by either side, and that Sheikh Sagar, as ruling Sheikh of Sbargah, was, in such a matter, a law unto himselt and was within his rights in putting an end to the concession. Issue (c).—As to the subsidiary contract of sale given to W onckhaus, we contended that Hassan's authority did not cover the grant of such an instrument ano that, as the primary ground for Wonckhaus's claim was the failure oL Hassan to fulfil his engagements, the obvious remedy of the German firm was an action at law against the vendors. Issu e {d). —We produced evidence to show that Esa, when he knew the whole terms of the subsidiary contract granted to Hassan (and found that it gave a monopoly), did not approve of it, and was justified in the course he took. Issue (e)--—We refused to admit Wonckhaus's as a partner in the original concession, as he had no share in it at the time of its cancellation and the colourable acquisition of one afterwards for the purposes of this case could not be recognised as hond fide. ■ It is to be noted that in framing our reply on the above lines His Majesty's Government did not make use of the ' monopoly' argument as Esa and the sheikh had, and I was warned to that effect. I did not understand our reason for dropping this argument at the time, but I now see tnat it was then heid that tnat argument would be inconsistent with our contemporaneous endeavour to obtain a monopoly or the Or muz oxide for a British firm. 1 venture, with much respect,, to hope that the position as regards this point will be reconsidered. Can the fact that the ci\ilised Government of Persia happen to deal in monopolies and that British and other foreign subjects are entitled to benefit by the fact be fairly adduced as a reason for precluding the primitive sheikhs of the Trucial Coast from safeguarding their interests by refusing habitually to grant monopolies except under the advice of the protecting Power ? These ignorant Arab sheikhs would get themselves into hopeless difficulties if not looked after in such matters. Phase IV.— German Rejoinder, 3, 1910. Referring to the same main issues the German Government now make rejoinder on the following lines :— Issue (a).—They produce evidence which they consider supports the contention that Salim granted the original concession in his own absolute right as formal owner, not only of the mines and other property in the island, but of the island itself. As an alternative they claim that even if it be possible to doubt Salim's formal ownership of the island, he is proved to have exercised the full right of disposal of the usufruct, just like an owner, both with and against t h e consent of the ruling sheikh. Issue (h). —That the original concession was approved by the ruling sheikh we have always conceded. What we contended was that he was justified in cancelling it. The German reply again presses the argument that the ruling- sheikh (or the owner of the island, whoever he may be) had no power either according to the terms of the lease, or according to religious or commercial law, to revoke the mining rights of the concessionnaires ; that they were in fact irrevocable. Also, from the administrative point of view, they contend'that the sheikh's action had no justification. Issue (c).—As regards the subsidiary contract, they argue that there is no valid reason for any action at law by Wonckhaus against the vendors, for no action of the latter has been harmful to Messrs. Wonckhaus; it is simply Sheikh's Sagar's action which has injured them. They claim that the Memorandum of Association drawn up gave Hassan full authority for all he did. Issue id). —They produce evidence in support of the contention that the third partner, Esa, approved the contract to Wonckhaus. Issue (e). —As to the colourable transfer of a share in the original concession by Hassan to Brown, and Brown to Wonckhaus and Co., they say very little. They9 simply contend that it was a piece of defensive tactics iustified by the circum stances. Issue (/).—They introduce the fresh and interesting contention that the Sheikh of Shargah has no jurisdiction over the concessionaires inter se, as they reside in Lingah, in the jurisdiction of the British consulate-general, and not in that of the resident in the Persian Gulf. Brief Comment on chief items of fresh Evidence in German Rejoinder. It is impossible that the German rejoinder can be fully dealt with in detail, except on the spot and with vernacular documents at hand for reference, but the following preliminary general observations are offered in comment, pending examination on the spot As regards Issue (a).—Certain new items of evidence are adduced to prove Sahm's private ownership of the island. 1. The exercise by Salim of the right to jetsam and flotsam. These Arab sheikhs have no clear idea on such subjects, and the exercise of this right by Salim is quite compatible with an arrangement or understanding between uncle and nephew under which Sagar allows Salim to enjoy what income there may be from the island. We have not stated anvthing to the contrary, and this position is compatible with what is stated in my note on the history of Abu Musa. (Appendix 6 of our case.) 2. f The first and rejected draft, dated the 6th April, 1898, of the oxide concession, in which Salim uses expressions suggesting formal ownership. This may equally well have been rejected, because Salim found that he could not make good such pretensions, and thought it better to modify them. 3. Receipt of revenue from mother-of-pearl and ' canary-seed.' ( u Canary-seed ' must, I think, be a mistranslation of some unfamiliar Arabic word, probably ' zinni,' the g^'ant oyster, as distinct from the ordinary pearl oyster.) By the same analogy as that drawn in the case of jetsam and flotsam, as this payment was an item of revenue from the island which the uncle Salim enjoyed under, his understanding with his nephew the ruler, it was quite in order that Sheikh Sagar, in his conmrereialr capacJEy asTa member of the mining concession, should share the payment made by his partners to Salim on this or any other account which could be regarded as income of the island. Thus Salim did not exercise the right to usufruct adversely to the ruling sheikh as the German rejoinder claims, but adversely to Sagar, qua member of the mining concession. 4. Lease by Salim of &lt;s mica' 5 deposits on the 26th December, 1898, 'Mica' should, I think, read ' gypsum.' There is no marketable mica on the island, as far as I know„ This is the most inconvenient piece of evidence which they have produced, because it tends to show that Salim granted the concession as tenant, and not as regent. The fact probably is that the ruling sheikh would probably give Salim a free hand so long as the latter's management of the island did not prejudice his sovereign rights or obligations to the British Government, and so long as the income derivable from it did not increase to a figure in excess of Salim's just deserts or needs. It had now done so. The alternative German claim that, even if Salim's formal ownership be doubted, his practical enjoyment of the usufruct is proved, will, I think, have to be conceded, in fact has been conceded, but with the reservation that such enjoyment is with the consent and permission of the ruling sheikh. The instance they quote as tending to prove that Salim exercised the privilege adversely to the ruling sheikh is not in point, as I have pointed out above. The personal relation of the one sheikh to the other must be Temembered. Salim must be thirty years older than his nephew Sheikh Sagar, and was himself ruling sheikh for eighteen years. Then the swing of the tribal pendulum placed the young nephew in the sheikhship. The present sheikh is naturally in a very delicate position towards his aged relative and predecessor, and, as long as the latter remains loyal and inoffensive, he is content to let him enjoy any income derivable from Abu Musa so long as it remains inconsiderable, as it has hitherto. The moment the income becomes, in his opinion, unreasonably great for Salim, or Salim becomes troublesome, the ruling sheikh is in a position to alter the arrangement arbitrarily in any way he pleases short of oppression, in which case we should give Salim our friendly offices in obtaining [2643 d—1] Dreasonable consideration. The most obvious evidences of the character ot balims tenure or tenancy of the island are :— Firstly, the fact that, if he were private owner of the island or mines in his^ own right, he must have acquired them from somewhere, and would have the ordinary deeds in support of his title. But he says he has nothing of the sort, and makes no such claim. If the Germans know or think that he has, why do they not allude to such or ask for discovery of them ? Again, if Salim owned in his own right he could will the property away; but I am sure he would not claim to do so, nor would his nephew tolerate such a claim for a moment. The Bahrein principality recently furnished a case which bears on this question. Sheikh Ali, nephew of the ruling sheikh, was deported in 1904 for unruly conduct. He was at the time in the enjoyment of certain State property. On his deportation the ruling sheikh resumed the property, and the nephew on his return could not claim it back; he was simply dependent on his uncle's kind consideration. These petty potentates have to support their relations, and the most convenient way of doing so is to give them, as long as they behave loyally, the enjoyment of State property instead of cash, which is a scarce commodity with them. Secondly, our action in rescuing Abu Musa from Persian annexation in 1904, was taken long before this dispute was ever dreamed of. It was taken at the instance of the ruling sheikh, not of Sheikh Salim. Salim made no attempt to pose to us as owner of the island at that time. Issue (h), —We do not dispute the fact that the ruling sheikh approved the concession. In support of their contention that the latter had no power to revoke the rights of the ' mining company,' certain recorded opinions are now adduced, and it is argued that the concession is unterminable by the grantor either by religious or commercial law. It is also contended, as before, that Sheikh Sagar's action, if viewed from the administrative standpoint, was unjustifiable. Evidence such as that produced by them can be bought to any extent. Brown and Dr. Listemann have simply gone about getting hold of certain ' leading merchants and others, who, as far as I can recognize their identity, are known to have specific animus against us or our agent at Lingah. It is to be noted that the arguments brought forward under the head of this issue seem all based on the idea that our object was to stop Wonckhaus .trading in oxide altogether which was not the case. Issue (c).—The memorandum of association gave Hassan the authority to conduct sales, but not to grant monopolies—a proceeding opposed to the standing advice of the protecting power and the sheikh's own principles and interest—much less to alienate to any one a share in the concession itself (in this case to the subject of a foreign Power with which the Trucial sheikhs have no dealings). Issue(d). —They produce no fresh element. We are agreed that Esa knew of the sales to the Germans. What he objected to was the grant of the monopoly which he did not know of, and subsequently to the sale of a share in the company to Brown. Issue (e). The transfer of a share to Brown, and, by Brown to Wonckhaus, is simply justified by them as an act of legitimate retaliation or self-defence ; and, on the assump tion that the cancellation was void and illegal, it is argued that the transfer was in time and in order. Issue ( f). —This issue is adroitly raised in order, if possible, to withdraw the dispute from the sphere of the residency of the Government of India to that of the legation at Tehran. N . Of course, we are in a much stronger position to lay down what the Sheikh of Shargah can or cannot do as a law unto himself so long as we deal with the matter as within the jiirisdiction of the resident in the Persian Gulf. Abu Musa having nothing to do with Persia and the Sheikh of Shargah being under the jurisdiction of the Govern ment of India, and not of His Majesty's Legation, the argument can no doubt be easily resisted, and should be. P. Z. COX. February 12, 1910.Enclosure 4 in No. 1, Further Minute by Mr. Hurst. I HE only material point on which Major Cox disapproves my suggestions for a compromise is the renewal 01 the term in the contract under which Wonckhaus was to be entitled to the entire output of the mines, other than the small parcels Hassan was to be allowed to send to India. I regard the question whether Hassan's son should be included among the new concessionnaires as a detail. If Major Cox, of his local knowledge, thinks it better to omit him, it would certainly be better to do so : my only idea was to restore the status quo as nearly as it was safe to do. The monopoly point is rather more difficult. There are two documents with which we have to deal: the concession from the sheikh to Hassam and Co., a.nd the contract from Hassan to Wonckhaus. The former is a document which the sheikh has cancelled and can renew in any terms he pleases ; the latter is a document to which the sheikh is not a party, and the terms of which he has in consequence no means of altering. To get the terms of the contract altered will require the consent of all parties, of the concessionnaires and of Wonckhaus and Co. ; to obtain it will require much more negotiating^ and probably also the making of greater concessions to the Germans. Furthermore, the contract between Hassan and Wonckhaus is the portion of the transaction which is mainly commercial, and not political, and with which, therefore, unless there are very strong reasons for the opposite course^ I should be disposed not to meddle. It is, of course, quite likely that I am underestimating the importance of the monopoly point, but in my view it is rather misleading to describe the arrangement as a monopoly at all. Even if Messrs. Wonckaus do obtain under the contract the whole of the output of the Abu Musa mines, this will not give them a monopoly of the oxide trade in the Gulf; there are the Ormuz mines in English hands, and these are the only mines at present which have got an established trade. I quite see that the fact that Messrs. Wonckhaus are entitled to the entire output of the mines gives them a position which would enable them to put such pressure on Hassan that they would get him completely into their control, and be able to dominate the mining operations, unless the interests of the sheikh were safeguarded ; but adequate safeguards can, I think, be inserted in the concession which will prevent Messrs, Wonckhaus obtaining any such control. My view, therefore, at present is that to attempt to vary the term in the contract under which Wonckhaus is entitled to the whole output of the mine would be a. mistake. C. J. B. H. Foreign Office.

K instructions from my Government, I have the honour to transmit herewith six copies of ^ a second memorandum drawn up by the German Government on the Hubject ot the Adu Musa incident, in reply to the Memorandum of the British Government. The Memorandum sets forth the general and legal position as established by facts an d_ proofs. It comes to the conclusion that the action of the Sheikh of Shargeh against the mining company, Hassan-ibn-Ali and Co., was illegal, that in its ultimate aim.it was directed against the contract between IIerr Robert Wonckbaus and the mining company, and that the forcible measures taken by the sheikh were directly promoted by the agents (' Organen ') of the British Government. According to the ordinary principles of law, therefore, the British Government and the sheikh are jointly responsible for the consequences of these actions. On the one hand, Herr Robert Wonckhaus should be compensated for the damage which he sustained through the non-fulfilment of the contract consequent upon the infringement of the rights of the mining company by the sheikh, supported by the agents of the British Government. On the other hand, the firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Co. should be compensated, as a participant in the mining company, for their share of the damage sustained by the mining company through the suspension of operations. A detailed calculation of the damage is reserved. In order to obviate an increase of the damage and to put an end to the existing disturbance to property, the mining company should be permitted with the greatest promptitude to continue their mining operations. Having regard to the present position of affairs, the German Government believe that they should first of all only apply to the British Government to take steps for the removal of the disturbance to property and for the grafting of compensation for damage sustained. If, contrary to expectation, the British Government should not admit the grounds on which the attitude of the German Government is based, as set forth in the Memo randum, and should adhere to the negative view which they have hitherto adopted, the German Government are of opinion that the point at issue should be referred to the Permanent Tribunal at The Hague. Second Memorandum by the German Government November 1909. IN consequence of what is stated in the Memorandum of His Majesty's Govern ment of the iOth July, 1908, the Imperial German Government have again examined the complaint of the German firm, Robert Wonckhaus and Co., of Lingah, in regard to the occurrences on the island of Abu Musa. In this examination they have given every consideration to the arguments used in the Memorandum, and to the documents communicated to them. From a comparison of the British Memorandum with the first German Memorandum (of December 1907), it appears that the following facts are not disputed :— Till the spring of 1883 Sheikh Salim-ibn-Sultan-ibn-Sakar Alkasimi (referred to below for short as Sheikh Salim or Salim), was reigning Sheikh of Shargeh, to the territory of which the island of Abu Musa belongs. During the time that he was in I have, &amp;c. P. METTERNICH. Jf Enclosure in No. 1. [2574 c—1] B2 the Island of Abu Musa, in which he always took a particular interest, and wnere he had built himself a dwelling-house and had established date plantations, he was deposed by his nephew, the present reigning Sheikh Sakar-ibn-Khalid (called below for short. Sheikh iSakar or Sakar). Sheikh Sakar at that time intended to drive SheJkn fcU'soi out of Abu Musa by force, but was prevented from doin g so by the British resident i-; th( Persian «ul{. Nevertheless Salim 5bu IVTiisa and went to Ijingah, until, in July 1883 an agreement was made between the two sheikhs, according to which Sheikh Sakar was to pay to Sheikh Salim an annual pension of 600 dollars, i here upon Salim returned to Abu Musa. In 1884, however, differences again arose between the two in consequence of political intrigues of Salim against Sakar, and Sakar several times complained to the British resident in letters. As Salim was in financial straits he was obliged to give in, and a second agreement was arrived at. ^ Under this agreement Sakar, for whose means the pension of 600 dollars previously settled was too high, granted his uncle a pension of 400 dollars annually, hall to be paid m money and half in kind. The revenue from the Island of Sir Abu IN uaii', said to amount to 200 dollars, was also assigned to Salim. After this the relations oi tiie two sheikhs remained peaceful until the spring of 1889, when, as is alleged, Salim was making prepara tions for an attack on Shargeh. The British agent at Shargeh, however, succeedea in reconciling the. two sheikhs, and persuaded them to conclude a new agreement (6th April, 1889). By this Sakar undertook to continue the payment of the pension of 400 dollars, allowed Salim to live at Shargeh within certain Dounds, and promised to treat him in other respects also in accordance with his rank. I ae Island of Sir, which produced no revenue, was not mentioned in this agreement Salim undertook to keep the peace and to obey his nephew. I he two sheikhs afterwards lived on good terms, so that Sheikh Salar, when absent from his capital, entrusted the Government to his uncle. ( Annexes Nos. 2 to 6 of the British Memorandum, i By a document dated the 10th April, 1898 (18 Dulkade, 1315), Sheikh Salim leased the red oxide mines on the Island of Abu Musa for an annual rent of 250 French reals, to the British subjects, Alhaj Hassan-ibn-Ali Samaih (called below Hassan Samaih, for short), his son Abdallah-ibn-HaSsan (Abdallah, for short), and Isa-ibn- Abdallatif (Isa, for short), son of the British co nsular ag ent at Shargeh, Abdallatif-ibn- Abdarrahman, who represented his son in all business of the company of lessees. At that time Sheikh Salim was Eegent of Shargeh, as Sheikh Sakar was absent on a pilgrimage to Mecca. The rent was paid re gula rly, and received by Sheikh Salim. ' ^ On the 19th August,T89H ft Fiebi-ei-tini, isiO), Sheikh Sakar was received into the company of lessees as a shareholder on an equal looting with the others, ne, however,' on the 29th January, 1899, (17 Ramadan, 1316), made his share over to one Yussuf-bin-Abdallah, who transferred it to Hassan Samaih. This share was, on the 10th October, ] 907, sold by Hassan Samaih to Thomas Brown, a British subject, trom whom t . purchased bv H:&lt; unn oi' ! Won u on the 16th October, 1907. (Annexes 3 to 4 b of the first German Memorandum.) Previously to this, on the 1st June, 1906, a contract (Annex 5 of the first German Memorandum and Annex 10 of the British Memorandum) had been concluded between Hassan Samaih and the German merchant Robert Wonckhaus, a partner in the firm of Wonckhaus and Co., under which fromf 2,000 to 5,000 tons of red oxide were to be d eliy^y e d to Wonekhaus a nnually tin V . - u ' K ju • ■ , iU-act&lt;-. i '-vithmiv . pai • var a fivf \ to India. TAnhex'l T)brthe'fbst German MWorandum:) On'the 21st February, 1907 (9th Moharrem, 1325), Sheikh Sakar addressed a letter (Annex 12 of the first German Memorandum) to Hassan Samaih, in which he demanded that the working of the red oxide mines on Abu Musa should cease. The ostensible ground for this step is a complaint made by Isa to the sheikh that th e con tract lor delivery of red oxide had been made with Wonckhaus without hi^ icl &gt;n Fbere- upoii a'somewhat lengthy correspOhdehcb Srsued' beHveen Hassan Samaih on the one side and Sheikh Sakar, Sheikh Salim, and the British consular authorities on the other (Annexes 13 to 16, 18 to 20 of the first German Memorandum) until Sheikh Sakar, in two letters of the'3rd Octo ber, 1907 (25 Shaban, 1325), to e of which was to be handed to Hassan Samaih,' ahd'his receipt obtained, in the presence of Hie British consular agent at Lingah, again ordered that the work should'cease. ( Annexes 21 and 22 of the first German Memorandum.) &lt; tc■'w' (■ • ^ Thereupon, about the 20th October, 1907, Sheikh Sakar sent armed men to the. -IheJxjato containing trie sneikh's armed force were towed to Abu Musa by the British war-saip Lapwing', on board which was Lieutenant C. H. Gabriel, British vice -consul at Bunder Abbas. ■ About mia-day on the 23rd October (a few hours after the departure of the British war-ship) owo employes of the firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Co , who had approached the island in order to land on it, were received with bullets by the sheikh's armed men, and forced to turn back. as. .stated above., there is a difference of opinion as to whether Sheikh 8;ikar was justified in acting as he did. Whereas the British Memorandum maintains that there was nothing illegal in Sheikh Sakar's proceedings, the Imperial Government are still of opinion that he had no legal right, either by private or by public law, to cancel of his own motion the lease agreement concluded by Sheikh Salim, and that the forcible execution of his decision must undoubtedly be regarded as an illegal act. (A).— Position of Sheikh Sakae with eespect to the Company of Lessees, from the point of tiew of Peitate Law. It is stated in the British Memorandum that the Island of Abu Musa is the property of Sheikh Sakar, and that it was only as the representative of Sakar and while he acted as regent during the iatter's pilgrimage, that Sh eikh Salim concluded the lease agreement; that the island is an integral part of the dominions of the Sheikh ofShargeh, wiio in recent years has regularly sent his cattle to graze on the island; and that Sheikh Sakar, who after the deposition of Salim made the latter an allowance, had, solely in consequence of oral and personal arrangements, increased this ailow;ance by the revenue of A bu 3:: v .;. including that derived from il.e vrd oxide iniiies. . In proof of this the British Memorandum first cites a letter from Salim to Sakar of the 21st February, 1908 (Annex 1 of British Memorandum), in which Salim declares that he has no claim to the island and has never put forward any claim to it, and then a kind of Memorandum of Sheikh Sakar, dated the 22nd February, 18 98^ ' (Annex 5 of British Memorandum), in which he gives an account of his relation* with ■Balim and his arrangements with him in regard to property. Further, there are cited two letters from Sakar to the British resident in the Persian Gulf, dated the 21st January and I4th February, 1884 (Annexes 3, 4 of the British Memorandum), in which Sakar describes Abu Musa as 'our island and a dependency of Shargah,' as well as the agreement between the two sheikhs, of the 6th April, 1889) (Annex 2 of the British Memorandum). Finally, reference is made to a Memorandum of Major P. Z. Cox, British resident in the Persian Gulf, dated the 28th February, 1.908, on the history of Abu Musa (Annex 6 of the British Memorandum), and to a letter from Sakar to the British resident, Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball, dated the 11 th October, 1902 (Annex 7 of British Memorandum), which is held to show that in concluding the lease agreement, Salim was acting in his capacity of regent. Before these arguments are examined, attention must be called to an inaccuracy in the text of the British Memorandum. It is there stated that Sakar granted to Salim the revenue of the island, including' that derived from the mines. Sakar in his own account only speaks of havi ng as signed to Salim the amount of the rent of the oxide !■■■-• .M consequence of bis complaint th t bis ncouu is ihsuffici! ut. As regards the evidence produced, the Imperial Government regret that they are unable to accept as unobjectionable testimony the letter of .Sheikh Salim to Sheikh Sakar, dated the 21st February, 1908, to which the first place is assigned in the British Memorandum. This letter and Sakar's Memorandum of the 22nd February, 1908, which must be regarded simply as the version of an interested party and valueless as evidence, were written at a time when efforts were being made to collect proofs of the legality of the steps taken by Sakar against the company of lessees. The Imperial Government have informatioh that Major Cox was at Shargeh just at that time. The contents of both documents are so much out of harmony with the former attitude of the two sheikhs and with facts which will be mentioned further on, that one can only conclude that the sheikhs at the later period gave a different account of the proprietary rights on Abu Musa. Sakar's letters to the British resident in 1884 (Annexes 3, 4 of the British Memorandum) are no evidence of Sakar's ownership of the island. In order to under stand them fully 'one must remember that' they were written at a' time when Salim was living at Abu Musa after being deposed by Sakar, when the two sheikhs were enemies, and when Sakar still had to fear resistance on the part of the former ruler, and perhaps * Sic [? 1908].4 even the seizure and retention of part of his dominions by him. But bakar, having* undertaken the government of Shargeh, was responsible for the preservation of peace in accordance with the Maritime Truce, as is explained in the Memorandum by iviajor Cox referred to above. He therefore begged the British resident to warn Salim co keep quiet, and in order to justify his request laid stress on the fact that Abu Musa was politically a dependency of Shargeh, The sole object of the letters therefore was to put an end to the political conflict between the two sheikhs. Tliis view is supported by the lollowing minute (printed in Annex 6 of the British Memorandum), which appears with Sakar ? s second letter^ in the archives of the British resident ^ Sheikh Sagar seems to insist that if Salim continues to live on Bu Musa he should give a guarantee through the resident that he will not do anything to disturb him, Sheikh Sagar, or the maritime peace/' So that when we find in the one letter the words: 84 Abu Musa is an island dependent on Shargah, and we cannot spare it to others/ 4 and in the other the words; ' Bu Musa is our island and a dependency of Shargah/ ? this can only refer, according to the .whole context, to the circumstance • that^ the island belon g s to the territo ry of Shargah. Consistently with this, Salun Kims If, as mentioi e Bei&lt; w \\\ T), 3escriBes Abu TKSaT in several letters and docu^nents as ' mv or '* our^ island (meaning, that is, that he is the private owner), aiid as a dependency oi bnargah. If Sheikh Sakar goes on to write: gc 1 cannot dispense wuth tKF Island of Bu Musa, as it is of great use to me, 55 this can only be taken, in view of the context just referred to, in a political sense and not in the sense of private ownership. In the British Memorandum these letters are made use of to support the assertion that Salim's presence on Abu Musa was only u tolerated/' The contention is evidently that Salim had no right whatever to live on Abu Musa, and that ii he did live there, it was really only owing* to the kindness of Sakar. But it appears from what has Been said above that this toleration ' is to be understood entirely m a political sense and has nothing to do with the question of private ownership. No doubt Sheikh Sakar was at liberty to banish his political opponent from the country and also to prevent him from residing on his private estate. If Sakar did not do this, tiiat is no reasohTor concTlidmgThat Salim had no right, from the point of view oi: private law, to reside at Abu Musa. Salim s right to live at Abu Musa on the strength of his owning private property there, and Sakar s decision to tolerate his presence there, in spite of political hostility, are such very different things that conclusions cannot possibly be drawn from one to the other. Those letters, then, have nothing to do with the question of private ownership. In any case, they cannot be cited to disprove the private ownership of Salim. It, however, they are to be considered as having a bearing on this question, they would seem rather to point to the conclusion that Sakar regarded Abu Musa as a domain of Salim, from which he would have to drive him xf Salim was guilty of political misconduct by interfering in Sakar's affairs or disturbing the peace. (' ii Sahm wants to live in it- and guarantees that he will not commit' anything which would interfere with my affairs or distxirb the maritime peace, it matters not The letter, too, .which Sakar addressed to Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball on the ; 11th October, 1902 (Annex 7 of the British Memorandum), seems, on closer examination, to have a very different meaning from that assigned to it in the British Memorandum, In order to understand the letter, it wo uld be interesting t o know the p urpo rt of /Kemball's i nquiry 1 to j i h Sakar's let ei vj a - :• ' and which is i t pi ited in s^Ke ^P^mwandum. ..Other known Facts, howeWiV make it possible to form an idea of j what led to the letter being written and enable one to arrive at a proper appreciation j of its contents. On p. 9 of the 'Administration Keport on the Persian Gulf i Residency and Muscat Political Agency for 1898-9,' the following passage occurs J ' It is reported that the uncle of the She ikh of Shargah has given a long lease of / some oxide mines to HajT;AIi Dubastk,'also known as Nakhoda Ali, who is a resident / of Bushire, where he got into trouble and had to leave. He is said to have already / exported 400 tons of oxide, and a further enquiry into the concession will be made when / an opportunity offers.' / It is not stated where these mines are situated, but, in any case, Lieutenant- Colonel Kemball certainly seems to have considered the sheikh's uncle, Salim, as the owner of the mines in question, as otherwise the above passage, which says nothing about a regehcy of represelifation, would have left open the question how Salim came to give the lease. It is to be presumed that later on the resident, carrying out hisintention of making further enqmries asked Sakar lor information about this lease, of T!Z T ?' 1 reaChed , h ' m - th ™ ™pM. on the llth October.

This ^ ' SUi P u&amp;in £ w-ien it is realised tliat tlie sheikh evidently has a wrong conception ot the scope 01 a treaty concluded with the British Indian Government on the 7th. March, 189^,. Wiien asked by the dragoman of the Imperial vice-consulate at Bus e on the 2&amp;ta November, 1907, 'What harm is then* m having made a contract ^it the German firm ; Sheikh Sakar replied, ' We have made treat ies with the jiiig■ isij v, hicu prevent vs from_le asing an y ^ part of our' tenTto r y to foreign ers otKer 'i.-t- J- m i-pw-'it i'ii-r.% nr.&gt;i.-ons a ' f ii • t^aty.a meaning whicn would be incompatible with the principle of the open door, ihis conception of the treaty explains why Sakar, when Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball asked him about leases of land m which a foreigner—the Persian, Nakhoda Ali—was concerned, hastened to assure him that he had had no dealings with Nakhoda Ali, and to explain that his uncle auring his regency, and not he, had concluded a lease agree ment, ana thai' only with British subjects, so that, if the lease had been a violation of the tne political responsibility would have fallen primarily on Salim and' not' on bakar. , -^e letter to Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball—which is, moreover, the only document p;&gt;&gt;uuced^ iu this connection supplies no evidence that Salim was acting simplv as regent when he concluded the lease agreement. On the other hand it is an important indication of the manner in which Sakar at that time regarded the position of Salim with respect to Abu Musa. 1 urther, it bakar now asserts (Annex 5 of British Memorandum) that he volun- ijariJy assigned the rent of 250 French reals to Salim, in order to raise his income to the amount previously promised or to a. little over that amount, that is an ex state ment for which there is no proof,, and which is inconsistent with facts that will be considered below (pp. 6 et seq.). The circumstance that Sakar used to send his cattle to pasture on Abu Musa would not be inconsistent with Salim's ownership of the island, for, as may be gathered from Majoi uoxs account (Annex 6 of British Memorandum), this may very well be a privilege of the reigning Sheikh of Shargeh, a kind of servitude to which the private property in the island is subject. In this connection mention may be made of another circumstance which has an important bearing on the question of the ownership of Abu Musa. As stated above the arrangement of 1889 was preceded by other agreements respecting the pecuniary-' compensation to Salim, and in order to increase his pension, which had been reduced to 400 dollars the revenue of the Island of Sir Abu Nuair, estimated at 200 dollars, was assigned to him. Now if the revenue or'an Island was to be given to Salim would it hot have been ^natural to give him Hid 1 or the island ot. Abu Musa, which he could have cnecked, and, it necessary, coiiected himself since he resided in the island ? Of course, if Abu Musa was already Sahm's property this expedient could not be'adopted. _ , Ike objections raised in the British Memorandum to Salim's ownership of the .and or Abu Musa having thus been refuted, and attention having been called to certain points which indirectly support the contention that he was the owner, reference will , * ' f he sentence ' the lease has remained up to now ' is also important in another connection. It can omy mean that the tease nas not yet expired. There is no mention here of a necessity for the recosrnition of tne agreement by bakar or of a right of Sakar to terminate it; while in his letter of February 22 1908 he says: ' 1 did not repudiate it ? and saw nothing- objectionable in it, and so I acquiesced in it,' (Annex 5 of .British Memorandum.) v * uj . [2574 c—l] c6 now be made to certain circumstances which constitute direct evidence of Salim's ownership. Salim has always exercised the right to wreckage on Abu Musa. In 1898 a boat belonging to Hassan Samaih grounded on Abu Musa. Salim claimed part of the cargo on account of his right to wreckage, but finally withdrew this claim in consequence of the intervention of Abdallatif, and informed the latter of his decision in a letter of the 23rd March, 1898 (29 Shavval, 1315).* Salim here speaks of the ' right belonging to us ' j' and of ' our Island of Abu Musa,' Further, a boat belonging to Abdallah Muhammed Hassan Alkhadja, a merchant of Lingah who had for many years carried on an active trade with the Oman coast, grounded on Abu Musa about seven years ago, and Salim, not Sakar, took possession of the boat and cargo as wreck. The question of the sum to be paid to Salim or the proportion of the cargo to be kept by him afterwards formed the subject of long negotiations with Salim, which Hassan Samaih and his son Abdallah conducted on behalf of Abdallah Muhammed. Sheikh Salim concluded two lease agreements respecting the oxide mines : the first on the 6th April, 1898 (14 Dulkade, 1315)4 ihe second on the 10th April, 1898 (18 Dulkade, 1315),§ The first was expressly cancelled by the second. Neither contains any reference to the regency or representation. On the other hand, the first agreement contains the passage : ' So long as I, my children, and my brothers live no one shall have a right to raise objections' to it (i.e., the lease).' This clearly expresses that Salirn regarded himself as the owner, since he 'speaks of himself and his heirs, which would be impossible if he had only been acting as the representative of Sakar. If the lease agreement had been concluded in Sakar's name, Salim could not have declared that no one (including, therefore, Sakar) was to have a right to raise objections, and, moreover, there would have been no sense in mentioning Salim's heirs in the agreement. In the second agreement Salim further secured for himself an annual payment of 100 French reals for the trade in mother-of-pearl and canary seed. Salim has always levied this sum from the lessees as well as the rent. In the document of the 19th August, 1898 ( 1 Rebi-ul-Tani, 13151&gt; Annex 8 of first German Memorandum), in which Sheikh Sakar announces his entry into the mining company, he e xp ressly undertak es^ ■pay a proportional part of the mother- of'-y ea rl due. This is absolutely inconsistent with S-'i/v's a- : - »' h . i.c ha ; uTaiaed 1.. S.-.lhu o?(/.&lt;• the t'&gt;- vria's m^nes, unci at the same time shows that Salim had a right to the enjoyment m his own name of all sources of profit to be derived from Abu Musa, and that he could exercise this right even as against the reigning sheikh. Another circumstance of particular importance in connection with the question as i to which of the two sheikhs is the owner of Abu Musa is, that on the 26th December, f 1898 (12 Shaban, 1316), |j that is long after Sakar had returned and Salim's regency had come to an end, Salim leased to Hassan Samaih, Abdallah, and Isa all the deposits of mica on Abu Musa. The lease is for a term of five years, and a tot al sum of j 1 ,500 French reals is to be paid' for it. In the document Salim expressly speaks of f ' our Islandjo^ Abu Musa/'^T The price of the lease was jpai3 t o J^alirn bvo ilir'' , ■ '(JnliEie eth January, 1899'('JS AbdailaHrsends to Hassan Samaih the draft of a Memorandum of Association respecting the working of both the oxide and the mica mines, tt In sending it he observes that Sakar has seen the Memorandum , and wishes to have a copy of it.|| Sakar, therefore, knew the terms of the agreement about the mica mines, and knew that the rent was paid to Salim, but he had no objection to make to the arrangement. If Salim has no right of any kind to the island, and if Sakar allows him to have the revenue from the oxide co ncession si mply out of liberality, how is it that Salim of his own autTTority lets the mica deposits and takes the rent before Sakar's very eyes, and without protest on his part? This rent of 1,500 French reals was a very con siderable sum to the Sheikhs Salim and Sakar, who are by no means rich. Would * Annex 6. f The first person plural is used in Arabic indiscriminately for the first person singular. Salim nearly always uses the plural in the Arabic text of his letters and documents.

Annexes 1, 2, 10, to 12. ** Annexes 13 and 14. ff For further particulars respecting the Memorandum of Association, see pp. 14 below. t j At this time Sakar was still a partner in the Company.Sakar have given up such a sum to Salim ? if he had had the least vestige of a right to it, without saying a word about this renunciation in his letter of the 22nd Febmary 5 1908, while he lays stress on his alleged grant of the 250 reals from the oxide mines as an act of particular generosity/ on his part, and cites it as evidence of his ownership of Abu Musa ? In the document relative to the mica mines there is also a stipulation of importance to the effect that the lessees and their employes may cut down keshkeshu^J^es, but no other trees. This provision, too. is evidence that Salim disposes of the island as owner. Another document which is of importance as bearing on the question of ownership, and which is connected with the mica concession, is the letter addressed by the British consular agent Abdallatif to Hassan Samaihonthe 12th November, 1898 (27 Djumada II 3 1316), # that is about a month and a-half before the conclusion of the agreement respecting the mica mines. Abdallatif and Hassan Samaih were at that time negotiating with Salim both in regard to this concession and also in regard to another concession for the exploitation of the salt and copper on the Island of Sir Abu Nuair. Abdahatif writes that a dispute has arisen between Salim and Sakar in regard to Sir. He says that Sakar proposes to conclude the lease agreement in his own name, and only allow Salim a share of the profits, an arrangement which does not satisfy Salim. So that Salim must ba.ve some reason for considering thcit Sir also belongs to him. In any case the question is not settled, and the cautious Abdallatif, who has an accurate knowledge of the circumstances, postpones the matter until the two sheikhs shall have settled the point between them. While Abdallatif is unwilling to conclude an arrangement about Sir because Sakar raises a claim to the island and Salim's right to it is disputed (the Sir concession was never granted), he has no hesitation in concluding an agreement with Salim about Abu Musa. Surely he would not have done this ifjie had had the slightest doubt of Salim's title, more especially as there was already a dispute respecting Sir. Moreover, Sakar, who, as shown above, was aware of the terms of the mica opueession, would,certaiSly have tried in this case, as in that of Sir, to make good hWreal or alleged rights, especially as a sum of 1,500 reals, a not inconsiderable amount for him, was involved. If he did not do so, that is evidence that he had no doubt himself that Salim was the owner of the island. The facts given above are clear evidence that the Island of Abu Musa is the private property of Sheikh Salim. This conclusion is supported by the opinion prevailing among the most respectable natives on the point in question. The merchant, Abdalmuhshi-ibn-Ahmed Almushari, who has had an intimate acquaintance with the atfairs of the Pirate Coast for many years ; the merchant, French consular agent, Abdarrahman-ibn-Muha,mmed-ibn-Kazim, who has permanent trade connections with Shargeh ; as well as Hlmd-ibn-Khalifa Al'uyuni, merchant and agent of the Sultan of Muscat—all three residents of Lingah—have declared in writing that to their certain, knowledge Abu Musa has always been, and still is, the free property of Salim. f The two last-mentioned have also assured the Imperial vice-consul at Bushire orally that evervone who has any knowledge of affairs on the Arabian Coast knows this as well as they do. But even if it be possible to doubt Salim's right to Abu Musa as its formal owner according to European legal principles, it cannot be questioned that he exercised, with the consent of the reigning sheikh, and even as against him, the full right of disposal of the usufruct, just like an owner. The English view, indeed, is that Sakar is the owner of the oxide mines, and that Salim concluded the lease agreement respecting them as his representative only. But even in that case Sakar had no right, from the point of view of private law, to terminate the agreement of 'his own motion. The lease agreement of the 10th April, 1898, states expressly that the lease shall run for so long as the lessees ' have an interest in the aforesaid mines.' So that the lessees only are to have the right to terminate, and not the lessor. It will be seen that this was the intention of the parties if the first lease agreement, dated the 6th April, 1898, is referred to for comparison. In this agreement, which was concluded only with Hassan Samaib and his son Abdallah, the right of working the mines is given to the lessees for so long as' they find oxide, but for not longer than twenty years, with the proviso that they can terminate the agreement at any time on paying one year's rent. Here already a long term was agreed upon for the benefit of the lessees/ Thereupon Abdallatif's son Isa was received as a partner, and the new * Annex 15. f Annexes 16 to 18.8 lease agreement of the iOth April, 189S, was drafted by Abdallatif. The oxide business was at that time considered very proiitable. The lessees, and especially AbdaDatjf, there fore wished to secure it for as long as possible. Accordingly the stipulation of a definite term of years was omitted in the second agreement. And in order to exclude any possible doubt as to the bearing of the two agreements upon each other, it was expressly laid down in the second agreement that any agreements previously concluded were to be considered null and void and that the second agreement alone was to be binding. Apart from the fact that it is the universal practice in that region, and a common practice in other parts of the world, to insert such a clause in agreements of this kind, the clause in this case serves the practical purpose of invalidating, verbis, the provisions of the former agreement. But the lessees would certainly not nave consented to an alteration of the first agreement if their rights had thereby been diminished. The history of the origin of the final lease agreement accordingly shows clearly that it was the intention of the parties that the lessor should, be permanently lessees should be at liberty to terminate the agree This intention has been expressed in the agreement in a manner that cannot be misunderstood. How, in spite of the clear wording of the two agreements, it can be said that there is no real lease agreement, b't only 'a mere permit to the partners terminable on either side at any time,' is as difficult to understand as the attempt to draw from the right of the lessees to terminate the agreement and from the clause cancelling previous agree ments the conclusion that the lessor had also reserved to himself the right to terminate the contract. These conclusions are certainty not supported by the documents bearing on the matter. It appears from one of Sakar's letters to Hassan Samaih (Annex 12 of the first German Memorandum) that one of the considerations which chiefly induced Sakar to take steps against the company of lessees was the idea that he would suffer loss in consequence of the agreement of the lessees with Wonckhaus. In connection with the other pretexts brought forward by Sakar in his various letters to Hassan Samaih, it may be conjectured that here, too, we have to deal with an apprehension on the part of Sakar which belongs rather to the realm of politics, and which will be discussed later (pp. 17, 18), namely, that the agreement with Wonckhaus might tend to bring about the gradual separation of the Island of Abu Musa from the dominions of the sheikh. The British. Memorandum gives a different explanation of this matter, and states in justification of Sakar s attitude that, in view of the rise of the price of oxide in the market, his pecuniary interest in the mines was not properly safeguarded by the rent of 250 reals fixed an indefinite time. In other'words, SaLar cannot recognise the lease agree ment any longer if the other party makes large profits in consequence of the rise of market prices, while he (as lessor) has to be contented with the rent; the lessor is therefore bound by the agreement only so long as the lessee does not make considerably more than the amount of the rent. It may be that Sheikh Sakar's ideas of the limits of legality and violence are somewhat undeveloped, and that he considers himself bound by agreements only so long as he profits more by them than the other contracting party. If, however, he were allowed to put such ideas into practice it would involve the admission that Europeans or the proteges of European Powers have no rights whatever in the territory of an Arabian sheikh, and that it is permissible for the latter to act as he pleases without regard for good faith or legality. During the long years when the company was working at a loss he did nothing/ Now, when there is a prospect of more profitable business for the future, he discovers that the rent is not sufficient. If Sakar wished to participate in the gains of the company, he ought to have retained his share in the company and borne a proportional part of its losses. Surely une onject of the agreement between W onckhaus and the company of lessees is, on the one hand, to make the purchaser of the oxide independent of the fluctuations of the market and insure his obtaining a certain quantity at a fixed price, and, on the other hand, to enable the working company to count with certainty upon selling a definite quantity and obtaining a certain income. Supposing that the' market value of oxide feii be.ow the price agreed upon between ~W onckhaus and the company of lessees, this would, according to Sheikh Sakar's ideas of justice, give the German firm the right to declare : .As in these circumstances the mining company is earning money while we are losing, we consider the agreement as no longer valid.' From the legal point oi view, the question whether, assuming that Sakar is the lessor, he is able to terminate the lease agreement because the lessee has begun to earn money and the rent does not appear sufficient to him, Sakar, is one that cannot be9 discussed seriously The point has been examined here only in order to show the weakness oi the position taken up by Sakar. , cyiesUoii of the termination of the lease agreement opinions'® have been obtained hom .heleac^ merchantsT at Ltrfgah and Busforah, and from the most important clergy| at Lmgah, ShargeB, and l)ebai,§ who have given their views on the matter from the point of view of commercial law and from that of religious law. The reference was maaem the form usual in that region, the agreement m question being submitted bo uhem in copy, together with certain questions in writing, and their opinions being given vvitnout a detailed statement of the legal grounds on which they were based. || J ^ All the opinions come practically to the same conclusion. The legal construction of tne case is, aowever, not the same in commercial law as in religious law. i.ccoiding to commercial law, the lease agreement is valid; the lessor cannot terminate it so long as the lessees wish to keep the object leased in accordance with vae agi cement. Ine agreement could only be terminated by amicable arrangement, since the lessor was not forced to sign it, but did so of his own free will. j^ccoiding to religious law the lease agreement is invalid, because a consideration was snipiuatea for the use of the mines ? while oxide and similar minerals lying on the surtace aie the common property ot all Mohammedans, and the lessor has accordingly conferred a right which he did not possess. But any person who discovers or works the mines thereby acquires the right to exploit them, and is at liberty to dispose of the produce as ite chooses. Sheikh Salim or Sheikh Sakar, whichever of them is to be considered the lessor, has no claim to the rent, and Hassan Samaih or the company of lessees has, oy working the mines, acquired a right to them. The Ruler of the territory cannot dispose of the mines, and he cannot prevent the person who has acquired them by working them from exercising his right. So that both the commercial law and the religious law forbid the lessor to terminate the agreement, the latter absolutely, and the former on the assumption that the lessee acts in accordance with the terms of the agreement. This has been done. The rent has been paid regularly. The sale to foreigners is not a breach of the a § re E ]rje ! ir '' ■ S1 p ce i ^ 110 t tbrbiddeii by the agreement; mdeedj U is expressly cbriiempTaled in the Memorandum of Association (pp. 14, 15), which will be mentioned further on, with the consent of Sakar as at that time a shareholder. Accordingly, neither Sakar nor Salim has a right to terminate the agreement. (B.)—The Position of Sheikh Sakab with bespect to the Company of Lessees from the point of view of public law* As observed in the British Memorandum, the reigning Sheikh of Shargeh is the absolute ruler of his country. The final appeal is accordingly to him in all matters concerning the political administration of his country. The British Memorandum further remarks that the principal object of Sakar was to administer justice as between^ the partners of the company on the strength of Tifs a sovereign rights of jurisdiction/' In connection with this point, the question must be considered as to whetliei^ SaKar had authority to decide as judge the dispute between the partners of the mining company, and whether the decision arrived at was justified by law r ? or whether he had power to cancel the lease at his discretion in the interest of the administration of the country. * Annexes 19 to 24. f Some of the Lingah merchants come from the Oman coast, have branches or agents there and have for many years been doing a very active trade with the places on the Oman coast; they have therefore a.o accurate knowledge of the mercantile customary law there. Among the opinions is that of Abdallab Mnhammed Hassan Alkhadja, a man who, on account of his ,experience and reputation. Is a recognized arbitrator in commercial matters, whose opinion is asked for by Persians and Arabians of the Persian and Arabian coasts as far as Bahrein, and to whose decisions they willingly submit. ^ t Among the religious opinions are those of Muhammed Mahdi-ibn-Abdallah and Yussuf«ibn -Muhammed- fbn-Abdallah, judges at Lingah. § Annexes 25 to 31. || To the clergy at Shargeh and Debai was submitted a fictitious agreement, the contents of which were in harmony with the agreement of April 10, 1898, in which only the names of persons and places were changed, and dates were spoken of instead of mother-of-pearl, and 44 mines' mentioned instead of 'oxide mines.' In obtaining opinions it is usual in the Persian Gulf to submit fictitious agreements whenever it is desired to conceal the names of persons and things, and so obviate the possibility of the referee b^ing influenced. ' ' ' ^ ^ [2574 c—l] J)10 1. Could Sheikh Sakar cancel the Lease Sheikh Sakar bases his letter of the 22nd February, 1907 (9 Moharrem, 1325) (Annex 12 of the first German Memorandum), in which he informs Hassan Samaih of the cancellation of the lease agreement, on a complaint made to him by Tsa of the conclusion of the agreement with Wonckhaus, of which Isa did not approve and about which he stated he had not been consulted. In consequence of the representa tions made by Hassan Samaih, Isa's complaint is again referred to in the second decision, dated the 26th March, 1907 (11 Safar, 1325) (Annex 16 of the first German Memorandum). Sheikh Sakar himself very wisely does not anywhere state that he wished to play the part of a judge, for according to Mohammedan public law it is impossible for the Sovereign to assume the functions of: a judge, A judgment can only be given by a judge appointed by the Sovereign. But the following further objection may be taken to the view adopted in the British Memorandum : if Sakar is the owner and lessor of the mines, as maintained in the British Memorandum, that circumstance alone is sufficient to preclude him from being a judge in this matter. It is, moreover, surprising that the British Government, as must be inferred from the Memorandum, should admit the jurisdiction of a sheikh on the Pirate Coast oyer British subjects, and that, too, in a case where the defendant Hassan Samaih resides, not in Shargeb, but at Lingah, in Persian territory, and therefore in 'the judicial district of the British consulate-general at Bushire, while the company itself has its head-quarters and domicil for judicial purposes' at Lingah, so that the principle, acter sequitur which is generally so strictly followed in the East, would appear to have been dropped in this case. But assuming that Sheikh Sakar had taken upon himself to act as judge in his own case, in spite of such a course being contrary to the principles of Mohammedan public law, it still remains to consider the further question whether his decision, cancelling of the lease agreement and withdrawal of the mines, was in itself legally admissible. Tsa complains that Hassan Samaih has concluded the agreement with Wonckhaus and in doing so has exceeded his power, and he is afraid that his interests in the company will be injured by this agreement. It would have been the duty of the judge to consider whether in concluding this agreement Hassan Samaih did really exceed his powers, or whether, if he had authority to conclude the agreement, its conclusion had, nevertheless, injured the other shareholders. If the judge found for the plaintiff, the judgment could only be either to the effect that the agreement had been concluded by an unauthorised person and was, therefore, not binding on the company—in which case the question of the amount of compensation to be paid to Mr. Wonckhaus would have had to be settled between the latter and Hassan Samaih—or to the effect that, although the agreement had been properly concluded and the company were bound to carry out its stipulations, Hassan Samaih was liable to make good to the other shareholders the damage thereby entailed on them. It may be admitted that a construction of the case in question according to the rules of European logic cannot be expected as a matter of course from an Arabian sheikh, and that is why—apart from other considerations—such a sheikh is not usually allowed to pronounce a judgment where the subjects of a European State are con cerned, But what one is justified in expecting is that the judgment even of an Arabian sheikh shall not violate natural justice as it has been violated in the present case. The dispute between the shareholders is not about the mines themselves, but entirely about a question of the administration of the company, the question, namely, whether a certain individual partner had authority to perform a certain legal act and whether this legal act was in the interest of the whole body or not. And what does the judge do ? He, who is being appealed to by one party to protect its rights which are believed to be threatened, and who ought to guard the interests of both plaintiff and defendant, doing justice between them impartially, does violence not only to both parties but also to the remaining shareholders who are outside the dispute, simply taking away from the company and putting in his own pocket the whole valuable object in connection with which the company was founded and in which he alleges that he has himself a financial inter est whicti is not beine duly satis fied,. That 'was 'Tin arbiinJry act oT cne' vviji-st kiticl. * ' —- If; nevertheless, the British Memorandum says: ' In no sense of the word does the conduct of the sheikh appear to have been illegal,' and if this is intended as a defence not only of the manner in which Sheikh Sakar carried out his decision, but also of the admisssibility of the decision itself, this line of argument becomes intelligible onlywhen it is remembered that the Memorandum starts from the assumption that Hassan Samaih s proceedings were culpable. The argument of the British Memorandum, so far as this question is concerned, is as follows :— ' . ^ K c ^ ear that an agreement of such scope as that concluded between Hassan Samaih and Mr. Wonckhaus ought to have been previously laid before all the parties interested. Lhat was not done, and at least two of the partners did not give their consent to the agreement. But Hassan Samaih had no right to conclude the agreement without the knowledge of the other partners, for he was not the manager. Therefore Isa's complaint was well founded.' i he Imperial Government, however, maintain that the partners did, as a matter of fact, sanction the agreement bet ween Hassan Samaih and Mr. Wnn o.kb ftBs , bnt that this sanction was not really necessary, as Hassan Samaih is the manager of the company. VV iEh regard to ihe question whether the partners approved the agreement, the following persons are concerned besides Isa : Nedjef, son of the former partner Nakhoda Ali A-lunea Salih, of Bunder Abbas, and Malcolm, of Bushire. Nedjef asserts in his letter to Lieutenant Gabriel, British vice-consul at Bunder Abbas, of the 16th February, 1908 (Annex 18 of the British Memorandum), that he did not give his sanction to the agreement, and did not sign it. With regard to this it must in the first place be pointed out that it is disputed that Nedjef was a partner. The matter stands thus: his father, Nakhbda Ali. as is clearly shown in the agreementeregarding his entry as a partner (Annex 2 of the first German Memorandum), had a share on the strength of his engaging to superintend the work at the mines, without putting capital into the concern. This partnership was accordingly connected with personal services, and therefore ceased when those services came to an end, that is, at Nakhoda All's death. That; at any rate, was formerly Abdallatif's view, as is clearly shown by the latter part of his letter to Hassan Samaih of the 23rd June, 1905 (19 Bdbi II, 1 323) .* This view is shared by Hassan Samaih and Abdallah, and the former energetically denied to the Imperial vice-consul at Bushire that he had ever recognised Nedjef as a partner. That Nedjef's father was not really a partner, but only an e mployeoi the company with a share in the profits, is especially clear from the fact that he did not take part in the reception of Sheikh Sakar into the company, and that it was not considered necessary for him to sign the document on the subject (Annex 4 a of the first German Memorandum), although it was not a case of a simple transfer of a share already existing, but of the creation of a new share, and therefore the diminution of the rights of the remaining partners. Whatever decision may be arrived at on • the question of Nedjef's partnership, a question which will have to be settled amongst the partners themselves, it is certain that Nedjef on several occasions expressed to third parties his approval of the proceedings of Hassan Samaih, and that therefore no credence can be given to his assertions in the letter of the 16th February, 1908, referred to above. In particular, at the end of November 1907, at Bunder Abbas, he said to Abdallah, son of Hassan Samaih, in the presence of the dragoman of the Imperial vice- consulate at Bushire, tliat he entirely approved of the agreement with Wonckhaus, and of everything else that Hassan Samaih did, and that he regarded him and honoured him as a second father.f Moreover, when the British subject Brown, of the firm of Robert Wcnckhaus and Co. was temporarily at Bunder Abbas in March 1908, Nedjef offered to sell him his (or rather his father's) share in the mining company; at the same time he stated that be entirely approved of the agreement for the supply of oxide concluded between Hassan Samaih and Mr. Wonckhaus. Mr. Brown decided not to buy the share only because he knew that Hassan Samaih, Abdallah, and Abdallatif disputed Nedjefs partnership. Mr. Brown has made a declaration, the truth of which he is ready to confirm by an oath,t in regard to this incident. It would therefore appear that the statements made by Nedjef in his letter of protest of the 16th February, 1908, denying ; his approval, which letter was communicated to Lieutenant Gabriel a month before the I offer to Mr. Brown meut'oned a bow, are ti »4 in accofdoiice die ta Oiht-i they would have lb be considered uf; retracted by the statement made by Nedjef to Mr. Brown a month afterwards to the effect that he entirely approved of the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus for the supply of oxide. * Annex 32. f The Imperial Dragoman, Mirza Abdnl Hussein, was on that occasion on his way to Shargeh accompimed'and had id wait' at Blinder Abbas for the steamer to Shargeh. He has declared officially that daring the conversation between Abdallah and Nedjef he simply listened and made no attempt to influence Nedjef. He says that Abdallah, too, used no persuasion with Nedjef, and that the latter expressed his approval entirely of his own accord. -- J Annex 33.12 No objection to the agreement with Wonckhaus was raised by the British protdg^ 1. J. Malcolm, of Bushire, of whom the British Memorandum only says that the lessees had 'engagements ' with him, while as a matter of fact he had entered the company two years after the conclusion of the lease agreement and paid capital into it once, being the only partner except Hassan Samaih who has paid in any. In the British Memorandum it is made a matter of reproach to Hassan Samaih that, in reply to Malcolm's letter of the 26th June, 1906, asking for a copy of the agreement, he, in the first place, answered on the 13th July, 1906, that the agreement was drawn up in German, and that in a later letter, dated the 14th October, 1906, he again declined to supply a copy on the ground that Mr. Wonckhaus had asked him not to say anything about this business (Annexes 13, 14, of British Memorandum). No doubt Hassan Samaih ought not to have made use of the excuse that the agreement was in German : but his anxiety to keep the terms of the agreement secret as long as possible, and especially not to communicate them to the firm of A. and T. J. Malcolm, is explained by business considerations. For Malcolm was a competitor, since his firm of A. and T. J. Malcolm is an agent for, and a shareholder in, the British firm of Strick and Co., in whose hands the Ormuz oxide trade is. Hassan Samaih had put his whole fortune of about 100,000 rupees into the Abu Musa oxide concern, which had so far been run at a loss, and which he now hoped would at last improve in consequence of the agree ment with Mr. Wonckhaus. He saw a great danger in the agreement getting to be known too early. Subsequent events have shown how well-founded his apprehension 'of further difficulties was. Although Hassan Samaih did not send Malcolnf the copy of the agreement in the first instance, lie nevertheless, in his letter of the 13th July, 1906, communicated to him all that was of importance In it, as is seen from Annex 13 of the British Memorandum; in particular he did hot, as alleged in the British Memorandum, omit to answer the question whether other European fir ms could make similar agreements, but said straight out ; ' We can therefore make no other contract.' In his reply of the 30th October, 1906 (11 Hamadan, 1324),* Malcolm says he will see whether it would be possible to sell the red oxide at a higher price or to get better terms, or whether, if it were found possible to obtain a higher price, the agreement could be cancelled or not. He further expressly states : ' If we are n ot sure of getting a higher price, we shall not get the former agreement cancelled.' In other words, Malcolm would have liked to get a higher price and better terms,, and if he found he could get such he would have liked either to come to an arrangement with Mr. Wonck haus as to other terms, or if he (Malcolm) was able to obtain them from another party, to persuade Mr. Wonckhaus to allow the agreement to be cancelled by amicable arrangement. It follows from this, however, that he considered the agreement as perfectly valid in itself. When Malcolm, later on, received a copy of the agreement^ he said m more about it, and accordingly acquiesced in it. It appears from a letter addressed by Abdallatif to Hassan Samaih, on the 23rd June, 1905 (19 Bebi II, 1323),f and a letter from the latter to Abdallatif of the 15th October, 1905 (15 Shaban, 1323), (Annex 9 of the first German Memorandum) that at that time a considerable quantity of oxide was already being sold to Mr. Wonck haus. and that it was proposed to supply oxide to Wonckhaus at a fixed price annually. As the correspondence shows, Abdallatif agreed to this. After the conclusion of the agreement of the 1st June, 1906, with Mr. Robert Wonckhaus for the delivery of oxide, Hassan Samaih communicates the fact to Abdallatif on the 11th June (18 Rebi H, 1324), and at the same t ime informs him of the substance of the agreement (Annex 11 of the British Memorandum}. In Tiis reply of the 14th June, 1906 (21 Rebi H, 1324)4 which has now: become of importance, Abdallatif openly expresses his satisfaction at the conclusion of the business, and the hope that better times are coming at last which will compensate for the sacrifices and disappointments of the past. The whole letter has evidently been written in a mood of relief, and furnishes indisputable evidence that Abdallatif gave his consent to the conclusion of the agreement.' It is true that in this letter he again shows the sceptical spirit of a person who is experienced in affairs, and who therefore cannot feel any satisfaction without at the same time having fears of future difficulties : he gives a warning against the conclusion of an agreement which would be equivalent to a lease of the mfoes or might give rise to difficulties which might conjure up the interference of more powerful persons. This is the meaning which must be attached to the letter when considered impartially. The German and the English translation (Annex 12 of the British Memorandum) of this letter correspond almost word for word.

He also lepioaches Hassan Sanaaih for having exercised his own discretion in entering' into the engagement, whereas ne surely ought not to have bound himself without consulting the other partners. He goes on to say : ' It is better to try to cancel the agreement than to do as he (the German) wishes.'+ The fact that Abdallatif only blames the inde- pendent action of Hassan Samaih points to the conclusion that he does not dispute the legal validity of the agreement, and this is made quite clear by a consideration of a T j Passage m the letter which deals with the question what is to be done now.

In giving this advice, Abdallatif himself admits that the agreement has legal force. Furthermore, Abdallatif in his next letter dated +hp 2/th March, 1907 (12 Sefer, 1325),|| again admits that he originally, that is'in his letter of the 14th June, 1906 (2 i Uebi II, 1324), concurred in the agreement.

The facts cited above show that Neief—if, indeed, he is to be considered a partner at all—as well as Malcolm and Abdallatif, the latter as the representative ot his son Isa, declared their approval of the conclusion of the agreement between xiassan »amam and Mr. Wonckhaus/ Of course, the legal position is not affected by the circumstance that Neief and Abdallatif subsequently denied that they nad given their approval, or by the fact that, in particular, Abdallatif, after he had procured a copy or the agreement, for the British consul, changed his mind about the agreement. , i , . v But, aoart from this, the Imperial Government are, moreover, of opinion that there was no necessity for Hassan Samaih to obtain the concurrence of the other partners, as he was the manager of the company. , , i . u. The circumstances of locality, apart from anything else, made it absolutely necessary that one of the partners should be authorised to represent uiie company alone in dealings with other persons, and to bind the company by his acts without the previous approval of the other partners.

From Lingah to Bushire and from Bunder Abbas to Lingah there is a weekly post, from Bushire to Lingah and from Lingah to Bunder Abbas only a lortmg.itly post. Postal communication with Shargeh has only been established within the last fewyeai^ at the time when the company was founded there were only saihng-boats a\ailauie the journey, which took from' three to ten days, according to the weather to reach Lingah from Shargeh. Telegraphic communication is entirely wanting on the Oman Coast; the telegraph station on the Island of Henjam can be reached from Lingah oy sailing-boat in from two to four days; the conveyance of a telegram from Henjam to Lingah takes the same time. How is it possible to imagine a properly commcted busmess with such bad means of communication if the managing partner, oe.ore con cluding a business transaction, has to ask the opinion of three people living respectively at Shargeh, Bushire, and Bunder Abbas, await their replies, perhaps answer oojections modify certain provisions in accordance with the wishes of one of the partners, and then again refer to the others for their sanction of the modifications ! This state of things being duly taken into consideration, a i»j emorandum of Association was agreed upon in which the rights and duties of the manager are reguiateu Wjt In a letter dated the 6th January, 1899 (23 Shaban, 1316),* Abdallatit sent the Memorandum of Association, which he had himself drawn up, to Hassan Samau- at Lingah, and reauested that all the partners there, i.e., Hassan Samaih, Abdaflah, and Nakhoda Ali, would sign it and then send it back. In sending it he ooserves that Sheikhs Salim and Sakar have seen the Memorandum, and that Sakar has asKed for a copy, which shows that Sakar, too, approved of the Memorandum. Hassan Samaih, Abdallah, and Nakhoda Ali signed the Memorandum added an additional article, No. 6, providing for the purchase of four large and four smaL buats au the expense of the company, and sent the altered Memorandum to Abdallatif, Hassan Sarn^oh ke^mg^a cop^ ^ R&amp;m&amp;d&amp;n, 1316),t Abdallatif wrote that he had shown the Memorandum to Isa and Sakar,t but that they had not agreed to the engagement of eight boats for the service of the company. iNo other objections were raised, which is quite natural, as the remainder of the Memorandum nad oeen drafted by Abdallatif himself, and had already been agreed to by the partners living at Sharo-eh As Hassan Samaih at once replied that he and tiie wo other pattnei s ^ Lingah consented to the cancelling of the boats, all the partners, were now m agreement as to the contents of the Memorandum of Association. No fresh copy of tne Memorandum was made, and none was necessary, since the correspondence which had passed showed that all had approved of its contents. In consequence of the adoption ot trus ne-y Memorandum of Association, the older provisions not in harmony with it, which were agreed upon when Nakhoda Ali joined in May 1898, of course ceased to be m force. * Annexes 13 and 14. | The communication of the Memorandum to Sakar is explained by the fact that at that time he was still a partner. ^15 The arrangements made at that time tor working together, hoy/ever, had reference only to the collection^of mother-of-pearl. (Annex 2 of the first German Memorandum.) Now, according to Article 1 of the Memorandum of Association, Hassan Samaih is to be the foremost, the leader, in the necessary negotiations with the foreign^ merchants for the exploitation ot the mines; he will sign ee Hassan-ibn-Ali and Company, and will explain to the partners how the negotiations and sales undertaken by him in connection with the different mines stand. ***** ' * ' Hassan Samaih, then, carries on the negotiations ; he alone has authority to sign for thg firm, and consequently to conclude for it.f Externally, too, the circumstance that the firm is called after him only, and. that the remaining partners are collectively represented by ' and Company/' goes to show the prominent position which he occupied in the company. Hassan Samaih is simply to keep the partners informed of what is going on, letting them know of the negotiations and of the sales concluded. It would be impossible to express more clearly than is here done that Hassan Samaih is the sole manager of the company, and that he is the person who is particularly authorised to conclude the sales with foreign merchants without being bound to secure the co-operation of the remaining partners. That this is the meaning of article 1 is, moreover, shown with particular clearness by the circumstance that, in the articles which follow, those cases are expressly mentioned in which the concurrence of the other partners is on each occasion necessary. The principle observed is quite clear: in the case of transactions which are intended to bring in revenue to the company, and which often necessitate a rapid decision, as, for instance, the conclusion of sales^ the manager acts quite' independently ; but where it is a case of spending money for the company and throwing a burden on the individual partners, their concurrence must first be obtained. Hassan Samaih, as a matter of fact, always availed himself of his powers as manager from the time that the company was founded, and this is shown by a number of the letters in the annexes inter alia. He concluded sales independently, amongst others, previously with the firm of Wdnckhaus and Co., he kept the company s books, and signed with the signature of the firm. The post delivered to him all letters addressed to the firm. The other partners raised no objections to these proceedings, and even if the above-mentioned Memorandum of Association did not exist, one would be justified in concluding that the partners concurred in his acting as manager from the fact that he occupied the position for many years without opposition. But there are farther proofs that Hassan Samaih was always recognised as manager. When on one occasion difficulties arose in connection with a sale of oxide, and Hassan Samaih asked Malcolm for advice, the latter answered^ on the 2nd February, 1901 (12 Shaval, 1318)4 that he, Malcolm, could not do anything, although he was a partner, because an individual partner had not a right to act. That the firm of Strick and Co., too, had partners, but an individuar partner of that firm could not engage in law T -suits for the firm, but only a person authorised to do so ; and that Hassan Samaih must bring the action himself. It could not be stated more distinctly that Hassan Samaih is the manager of th( compa ^''AIfSi r We cancel^Son of the lease agreement by Sakar, Hassan Samaih asked Malcolm for his advice as to what he should do. Malcolm answered, in a letter dated the 7th November, 1907,§ that, as Hassan was a* British subject, he had better apply to the British consulate-general. That is to say, a partner, who is not authorised to represent the firm himself, advises the managing partner to take steps on behalf of the firm. In a letter dated the 13th July, 1902 (7 Rebi II, 1320),[j Malcolm makes an offer ? addressed to Alhadj Hassan-ibn-Samaih and Co., on behalf of Strick and Co. Hassan Samaih is to telegraph his reply and to guarantee the quality of the oxide. Nothing is said of the other partners ; their concurrence, which, indeed, could not have been obtained in time, is not asked for. Here, again, Hassan Samaih appears as the * In the Arabic text the word ' eledjnebiye' — u foreign '-—is used. f In the British Memorandutn Hassan Samaih is blamed for describing himself in the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus as u owner and holder of Bu Musa Concession.' These words appear only in the heading of the agreement and are inaccurate for the reason that Hassan left out the words ' and Co,' But the signature to the agreement, which alone has legal force, and which was affixed in the form prescribed in the Memorandum of Association, clearly shows that Hassan Samaih signed, not for himself personally, but for the company. \ Annex 41. § Annex 42. # || Annex 48.manager authorised to conclude independently. It is not a case of a single sale, but of an agreement, very similar to that with Wonckhaus, under which the company are bound to the offer for six months until the arrival of Strick and Go's, answer, and may not sell to anyone else for six months after the loading of the oxide. It remains to examine the question wtysther Hassan Samaih injured the company by the conclusion of the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus and whether Isa would have been justified in complaining on this ground. It appears, from the account of Isa's complaint given in the British Memorandum, that the company is held to^ have been injured by the circumstance that, in consequence 'of the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus, it is precluded from profiting by any rise that may take place in the price of oxide. That is an objection that might be raised against any contract for delivery concluded for a certain term, and is of no importance so far as Mr. Wonckhaus is concerned. There might possibly, indeed, be a question whether the agreement as a whole is injurious to the interests of the company, and whether in the circumstances Hassan Samaih, as a good man of business, was justified in concluding such an agreement for the company. The provisions of the agreement are in substance as follows. The company is bound to deliver to Mr. Wonckhaus free on board ship at Abu Musa annually for a term of four years 2,000 to 5,000 tons of oxide of a particular quality at the price of 15.s\ Qd. per ton. Mr. Wonckhaus is bound to pay this price and to take at least 2,000 tons, and, further, if he requires more, and there is enough oxide, to buy up to 5,000 tons. On the other hand, the company may not sell oxide to anyone else, with the exception of about 5,000 to 6,000 sacks, which it may sell to India. On the expiration of the agreement Mr, Wonckhaus has the right of renewing the agreement on the same terms or the terms offered by another serious applicant. For a proper appreciation of this agreement it must be remembered that the company had till then worked at a heavy loss. It appears trom the books of the Company—which were kept very neatly, clearly, and weh—that the total expenditure from the commencement of the works to the beginning of December 1908 amounted to 301,043 rupees.® On the other side, the receipts amount to 207,804^ rupees,-so that there is a' deficit of 93,209 rupees. These figures show that the financial position of the company was very bad, and that it would have had to work at a profit for a long time before the previous losses could have been made good and a dividend declared. 0 The agreement with M. Wonckaus gave the company an opportunity of selling, at a fixed price, which was independent of the fluctuations of the market, and was guaranteed to it for a number of years, ar considerable minimum quantity ot oxide, and possibly two and a-half times as much. The company was therefore in a position to count with certainty on receiving a minimum of 1,550/. a-year, and to arrange its whole work accordingly. These receipts might be raised to 3,875/., not counting what was sold to India. ' The prospects of the company from a commercial point of view were therefore such as it had never had before. It was in the nature of things that the company should have to accept into the bargain certain limitations and obligations. Agreements like the one in question between producers and merchants are usual in all parts of the. world, and if a normal price and a fixed minimum sale are guaranteed to the producer, he on his part must give security to the merchant, who makes his arrangements accordingly, that the article shall not suddenly be diverted into the hands of his competitors. The chief point is that the risk to the producer here sinks to a minimum, while the risk to the merchant remains great. He is bound to take over the minimum quantity at the guaranteed price, and runs the risk of having to do so when the market price is such that he is obliged to sell the article at a small profit or no profit at all, or even at a loss, or he may have to buy it when he cannot sell it at all. It is likewise a very ordinary thing that, in view of these possibilities, the price should from the first be fixed at such a figure that a certain margin is left to the ' merchant, since otherwise the latter could not take part in the transaction at all. The circumstance also deserves particular consideration that, in a case like the one under discussion, the producer is not in a position to avail himself of the opportunities of gain to the same extent as the merchant. However skilled in business Hassan Samaih and Abdallatif may be, it will not be possible for them to dispose of the produce of the oxide mines on Abu Musa directly and without the interposition of a middleman, and to profit by the constant changes in the international market, as they do not possess either the * In the account of expenditure is included 5 per cent, simple interest on the total sum, which Hassan Samaih reckons as due to himself, since, apart from the 2,000 rupees which Malcolm put into the concern, he paidl all the expenses, while the remaining partners paid nothing.SrpS*S;.. 0r —would «* be in a position to org^iso tho be S'olmTetio!- on^h If ' Vf\ suffic ; e ™- ^ ' ,us ' V,.

Massan samau. was actmo- entirely m the interest of the company when he concluded ' - • • nh Mi. \, oj^l.huus; if he h.«l neglected this opportunitv doubts as to ins business capacity would have been fully justified. The result of the above examination, then, is that, assuming that Sheikh Sakar -ad axigut to dec 1 ^ the matter as a judge—which is disputed—his decision could not possibly be to the eliect that the lease agreement should be cancelled. Taking the most liberai view of his powers, he could only deal with the and pi qiiounce judgment on the question whether Hassan Samaih ought to nay com- pensation to trie plaintiff partner on account of the conclusion of this agreement. It lias been proved, in the first place, that the partners gave their approval to the agreement; m he secona place, tnat their approval was not necessary, because Hassan Samaih on the strength of ms powers as manager, had authority to conclude the agreement indepen dently, whether such authority was expressly granted him by the Memorandum of Association or whether it is to be considered as having been admitted in practice by his having been allowed to exercise it without dispute for many years. This disposes of tne first ground on which a decision unfavourable to Hassan Samaih might have been given. 0 ^ It has further been shown that the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus is advantageous to the company, and that by its conclusion the interests of the individual partners Taave been secured as completely as circumstances admit. It follows that, from this point of view also, a decision unfavourable to Hassan Samaih could not be given, especially as evidence in ..produced showing ^hat the partners approved of the agreement, which approval wouid preclude them, from claiming any compensation, even if the agreement were really disadvantageous. „ Accordingly Isa's complaint is entirely unfounded, and there was no legal ground lor Sheikh Sakar to give any judicial decision unfavourable to Hassan Samaih. The decision pronounced must therefore be regarded as entirely contrary to justice. 2. Could Sheikh Sakar cancel the Lease Agr of the administration n r ^ Je ' i ' axi . ous letters from Sheikh Sakar to Hassan Samaih, in which he pronounces e cancellation of the lease agreement and orders the cessation of the work, as well as certain letters from Abdallatif, show clearly that Sheikh Sakar was induced partly by political considerations to take steps against the mining company. Looking at the matter from this point of view, the objections which Sakar has to make to the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus are the following : He regards this agreement as a sub-letting of the oxide mines to third parties who are not British subjects, but subiects Ox a foreign lower, whereas, he argues, according to the terms of the original agreement the partners have to work the mines themselves, and may not lease them to others.' Sa.xiar -.ears that now that a foreigner is one of the parties interested in the mines, the * See p. 15, and annex 43. [2574 c—1] -p18 latter may pass out of his possession, and he may gradually lose the island. &lt;' mahy, ae points out that he did not give permission for the conclusion of agreements witn foreigners, and that the lease agreement does not contain any clause under which the whole output could be delivered to one individual without his (Sakar s) sanction. (Annexes 12, 16, 20, 22 of the first German Memorandum and Annex 39 of this Memorandum). In the first place it is not easy to understand how the agreement of the 1st June, 1906, can he regarded as a letting of the mines to Mr. W onckhaus. the stipulation that the oxide Is to he delivered free on board, and the detailed arrangements concerning the quantity to be loaded daily, make it clear that Mr. Wonckhaus was not to have anything to do with the working of the mines themselves.* Phe agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus is a simple contract for delivery, an entirely unobjectionable commercial transaction such as might take place anywhere without giving rise to comment, and which was intended to promote purely commercial interests. Even if this agreement had given to Mr. Wonckhaus for a certain time a position in the nature of a monopoly as regards the red oxide obtained on Abu Musa, that would not have prevented the transaction from being a perfectly legitimate one. It is to be observed, however, that a monopoly in the strict sense ot the word was not established, since the company was at liberty to sell certain quantities to India. Sakar's fear that the agreement may lead not only to the property in the mines being gradually lost to the owner whether he is Salim or Sakar—but even to the separation of the Island of Abu Musa from Shargeh, is so senseless that it is really not worth while to discuss it. _ . As regards Sakar's objection to the conclusion of agreements with foreigners, it is to be observed that the lease agreement concluded between balim and the company contains no provision against the sale of the produce of the mines to foreigners. On the contrary, in view of the freedom of trade recognised in tne Persian Gulf, and the absence of an express prohibition in the lease agreement, it may be considered to be taken for granted that the company of lessees is to be at liberty to conclude arrange ments for supplying foreigners also. Moreover, in the Memorandum of Association, with which Sakar had been acquainted for years and which he had approved of, sales^ to foreigners were expressly provided for, and such sales were as a matter of fact repeatedly concluded, without any objection on Sakar's part. His observation in his letter of 'the 26th March, 1907 '(11 Safer, 1325, Annex 16 of first German Memo randum) : ' We did not tell you to make contracts with strange rs from foreign Powers without informing us,' is therefore entirely groundless and misleading. It is also strange that, as appears from the letter just referred to, Sheikh Sakar should wish British subjects to be treated differently from those of other Powers. I rem the point of view of the Shargeh State a British subject is certainly just as much a foreigner as is the subject of any other Power. Yet Sheikh Sakar has nothing to say against the company of lessees concluding agreements with British subjects, while agreements with other foreigners are not to be allowed. This is evidently contrary to the principle of the ' open door.' . In the view of the Imperial Government the agreement with Mr. VV onckhaus neither infringes the terms of Salim's concession, nor is in any way dangerous to the internal peace, external independence, or territorial integrity of Shargeh. It is there fore not apparent how the action of Sakar against the company could be justified by considerations connected with the welfare of the State. The conclusions arrived at above may be summarised as follows :— 1. Sheikh Salim is owner of the Island of Abu Musa, and therefore, according to the commercial law prevailing on the Persian txiilf, had a right uo lease the oxide mines there to the mining company, Hassan-ibn-Ali and Co., m his own name. According to the Mohammedan religious law he could not conclude the lease agreement; according 5 to that law, however, the company would have acquired the exclusive right to the produce of the mines simply by the fact of working them. 2. The owner of the island, whoever he may be, has no authority, either according to the lease agreement (which is to be judged by commercial law), or according to religious law, to revoke or terminate the rights of the mining company or to hinder the company in any other way from working the mines. 3. Hassan Samaih had authority, as manager of the mining company, to conclude * The British Memorandum observeB that the arrangement between Sheikh Salim and the company was not really a lease agreement, but ' a permit to work these mines/' If even that arrangement is nut to be considered a leasehold,' it is incomprehensible how a simple contract for the delivery of an article can be regarded as a ' leasehold/'Uf agreements like that witb Mr. 'W onckhaus, signing in the name of the company, without consulting the other partners. Such agreements at once become binding on the other partners; in the case under consideration, however, their approval was also signified, 4. The agreement with Mr, Wonckhaus is advantageous to the mining company, so that the partners have not been injured by Hassan Samaih's action as manager. 5 S J here was therefore no reason for a complaint of the company against Hassan Samaih on the ground of action contrary to agreement or duty. 1 here was accordingly no ground for action on the part of Sheikh Sakar against Hassan Samaih for the protection of the other partners. Moreover, the seat of the company is at Lihgah, and the partners of the company are not subjects of the Sheikh of Shargeh, so that he has no jurisdiction in matters concerning the relations of the partners with each other. In any case, he could not exercise such jurisdiction himself, but should have had the dispute settled by the judge. J - The agreement bet ween the mining company and Mr. Wonckhaus, which is nothing but the conclusion of an ordinary and permissible business transaction, and which cannot have any political aims, neither infringes the lease agreement nor is in any way dangerous to the interests of the State of Shargeh, so that the action taken by kSheikh Bakar against the company cannot be justified on the ground of the general interests of the administration of the country. 8. Sheikh Sakar's interference is not limited to redressing a wrong alleged to have been done by one partner to the others, or to preventing the carrying out of an agree ment alleged to be contrary to the interests of the country, but simply deprives the whole company of the basis of its existence. The company, in which the German firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Co. have a share Ts thereby very seriously injured, since the realisation of its object is made impossible and it is not in a position to carry out current obligations imposed upon it by contract. 9. Sakar's proceedings, then, are clearly a violation of law—an exercise of arbitrary power. The British Memorandum maintains that, as Hassan Samaih had no authority to conclude a contract for the delivery of oxide with Mr. W onckhaus which would be binding on the company, it is open to Mr, Wonckhaus to claim compensation from Hassan Samaih for non-fulfilment of the contract. There can, however, be no doubt, after what has been stated in the present Memorandum, that the responsibility for carrying out the contract for the supply of oxide rests, not with Hassan Samaih personally, but with the company as a company. The fulfilment of the contract by the company has, however, up till how been prevented by the arbitrary act of Sheikh Sakar, and the lawless state of things brought about by that act. In consequence of the conclusion of this contract by Mr. W6nckhau$, acting in the interests of the firm of R. Wonckhaus and Co.^ this latter firm at the present time still has a substantial interest in the existence and prosperity of the mining company. When the disputes of the company with Sheikh Sakar placed the firm in a difficult position, it was only doing what was necessary in the defence of its legitimate interests when it endeavoured to acquire a share in the company, and so to exercise a direct influence on the fortunes of the latter. There was no reason why the illegal interference of the sheikh should prevent the firm from acting as it thought fit. The attempt is made in the British Memorandum to show that the firm of Wonckhaus has no locus standi in this dispute, on the ground that it either acquired its share in ignorance of the position of affairs, in which case it must address its claim to the vendor, or else acted with knowledge of the position, and has consequently itself to blame for the injury it has sustained. This line of argument starts from the erroneous assumption that the lease agreement is no longer legally valid. If that were the case, there would doubtless be no foundation for the present complaint. But as the dispute turns upon the question whether the cancelling of the lease agree ment was legal or illegal, and as the Imperial Government, for the reasons stated in this Memorandum, are convinced of the illegality of the cancelling of the agreement, there does not appear to be any reason why the firm of Wonckhaus should be pre« vented from putting forward, on the strength of the share acquired by it in the company, its claims in respect of expropriation. The firm seems to be the more justified in doing so from the circumstance that it was ervidently the aim of Sheikh Sakar s action throughout to render the rights enjoyed by Mr, Wonckhaus under the agreement for the supply of oxide illusory for the benefit of his competitors. Sheikh Sakar compelled by force of arms the cessation of the working of the oxide20 mines. His proceedings are also an infraction of the ' Maritime Truce,' to the preserva tion of which in those regions His Majesty's Government devote particular attention. His action was supported by Great Britain to the extent that the gun-boat ' Lapwing ' towed to Abu Musa the boats of Sheikh Sakar in which the sheikh's armed men were brought to the island to stop the work by force and prevent the landing of the employes of the firm of Wonckhaus.* So that not only was Sakar's attack on the rights of the mining company made with the knowledge of the officials of His Majesty's Government, but it was also directly assisted by them. The Imperial Govern ment cannot, therefore, do otherwise than include His Majesty's Government in the responsibility for the consequences of this attack. November 1909. Annexes.

So that if, during the attempt of Brown and Ali Zenker to land, there was no ' loss of life and bloodshed,' to prevent which, was, according to the British Memorandum, the sole object of the voyage of the ' Lapwing,' that circumstance was not. due to the British forces, which had already departed, but was entirely owing to the bad shooting of Sakar's men.21 After deduction of ulie bill of exchange paid to Ibrahim-ibu-Achnied, there remain 150 reals from the article mica, and 350 reals from the article red oxide, making altogether 500 reals ; from this must be deducted what has already been paid, and the balance is to be paid to him. ihis paper is a bill of exchange, and when you have paid him what has been mentioned, get a receipt from him.

Rashid's bill of exchange has arrived and we hope to send it ; and as regards Say id, we have made an arrangement. He gives us stuff in place of what we claim, for he has no money. Brother Abdallah and Sheikh Salim went to Ahu Musa to conclude the desired lease of the minerals, and we gave them the copy of the contracts to take with them to sign there. We wanted to arrange the matter here, like the lease of the red oxide, but, because people mised doubts in hii mind, he said he would only do it after seeing the place. It is to be hoped that they will settle this matter ; through the exertions of brother Abdallah all will go well We have given Sheikh Salim an advance of 80. reals against his L(XIX, as well as 50 reals, the balance of the shell due ; he refused to start until we had made him an advance. I hope you have got more ships and shipped red oxide to India; it is to be hoped that our Lord (God) will grant good profits, in order that our friends may rejoice and the envious be annoyed. People are very envious of us in this matter. As regards Sir, a dispute has arisen between Sheikh Sakar and Salim, It is Bakar's intention to lease* without mentioning Salim ? s name, and to give some advantage to Salim, but Salim would not agree to this.

Is the letting of it valid, and does the mine become property in consequence of being worked or not ? And if you say that it does not become property, does a man who works it, not knowing that it is a mine, become its owner ? Explain it to us, and you will be rewarded, and may God reward you for us ! Opinion. The answer. O God (allow) justice to prevail and guide to truth ! The red oxide mine referred to belongs to the group of open mines, which do not, by being worked, acquire the character of property to be freely disposed of; no one can validly make such an open mine his private property to the exclusion of others, nor can it be granted to him as a fief by patent from the Sultan; but it is common property of the Moslems, like drinking places for cattle, grass, and firewood. And there is a consensus of opinion (among jurists) as regards the prohibition of the letting of the mine in question, and the exploitation referred to does not constitute a taking possession ; and, as a corollary of that legal principle, if a person makes use of the mine and works in it and extracts from it the red oxide referred to, he has, in extracting the red oxide, more right to it than any one elsg, and that (holds good) if he knows that it is a mine ; But if he does not know till after the exploitation that it is a mine, he becomes the owner of it as land and soil and materially, and that according to the consensus of opinion quoted by the Imam Attabari; and it is expressly stated in the Mughni and in the Nihaye that it makes no difference whether it is extracted for trading purposes or for any other object. In these circumstances the aforesaid Alhadj Hassan has precedence in the extraction of the said red because he came first and up to this moment has not taken his hand off it; but at the moment when he took his hand off the red oxide and took the money for it, come under the power of Alhadj Hassan.

The verb Jk, is an intransitive verb signifying to be r The second conju gation jL on the measure makes the verb transitive, and the Masdar (German infinitivus) indicates nullification, abolition, The lourth measure JIijI (^Ui*) likewise makes the intransitive verb transitive.

Respectfully submitted. R ev . JOHN van ESS, M.A., Mission. Annex 38. In the letter of Abdellatif to Hassan Samaih, of 8, Dulhidje, 1324 (23rd January, 1907), the following passage occurs:— &lt; uj W ^ jiJ-iJjUUll tub JlkxLsl (istibtal hadihi 'Imuqawale chair min idjabethu). The first word JlkOwd does not appear in the dictionaries; but according to the analogy of such formations it can only be translated : ' the wish (or endeavour) to bring about an annulling ' (the annulling itself would be (tabtil) or J^ 1 ' (ibtal), see, e.g., Hava, Arabic-English Dictionary, Beirut, Catholic Press, 1899, p. 36 : ' Jk'u jL to annul, to cancel [a deed] '). The last word (idjabethu) can on account of the masculine pronoun only refer to one of two preceding words : 1. ' My son Isa,' or the 'he' in the subordinate clause referring to 'my son Isa ' : ' for he apprehends difficulties from the participation of foreigners in this business.' 2. ' The German.' It cannot refer to Isa, because that would have no meaning. So that the in idjabethu can only refer to the German, and that makes sense; for 1 (adjab) (with accusative of the person) signifies : ' to answer someone, to agree with someone, to comply with the wish of someone.' The meaning of the sentence is therefore ; ' better to aim at the annulment of this agreement wishes' The opinion of the missionary van Ess on the passage agrees with mine in regard to JlkuU (istibtal). He does not explain the word j JL j U-I (idjabethu), but alters Tt to lyjuU-' (idjabetha). The view that the wrong pronoun (masculine instead of feminine) is used here, as happens not unfrequently in these documents, and that it is justifiable to substitute the 'right' pronoun, is erroneous, for the reason that after the verb (adjab),the accusative, which here appears as an affixed pronoun, can only denote a and not a thing; but if the word were (idjabetha), the reference would be to a thino - , viz., the ZJjliLc (muqawale: 'agreement'). The translation 'an assent thereto' is incorrect. Prof. Dr . MARTIN HARTMANN, Hermsdorff, near Berlin, November 20, 1909. [2574 c~l] L36 Annex 39.

When we received your communication to the effect that you had sold to the Germans 2,000 tons a-year of the red oxide of the Island of Abu Musa, the price of which was 15s. for each ton, we sent 3 ? ou the reply, dated 21 Rebi II, 1324 (14th June, 1906), from which (our) satisfaction appears, but which contains a warning against entering into an agreement which looks like a lease or into an undertaking leading to gossip, because our rulers will not allow anything of the kind, and we asked you to secure us against the annoyances of this life. The letter must have reached you, and you must have understood its contents. After we had asked you several times to send us a copy of the agreement, you did so on the 5 Dulkade, 1324 (21st December, 1906) ; it was in English, and we acknowledged its receipt in our letter dated the 6 Dulkade, 1324 (22nd December, 1906); and when we had found a translator, and got the translation, we discovered that you had rushed into the very thing against which we had warned you, and that you have bound yourself by Jease.

You fixed the sum of 4,000 rupees as the price of the four large boats before you consulted them, and it is not clear to them whether the four boats have been employed from the date of the lease of the red oxide mines. 2. The red oxide mines, the rent of which is 250 reals a-year, cannot bear the cost of eight boats at high figures while the amount of oxide extracted is small. 3. It was not necessary to estimate so much for the workmen's accountant and for food, &amp;c., when such things surely do not disappear suddenly from the island. Also it is possible, by (good) arrangement, for the workmen to work for twenty days before the arrival of the ship, and it is possible for them to extract a great deal in that time ; other shippings should not be thought of till afterwards. To extract the red oxide from the ground and then leave it lying in the island is too expensive. It is now evident that shipping to India leads to loss of time. The people ask for samples; if they can get samples they give orders, but not otherwise. It is clear that the work was carried on37 assiduously wthout the existence of a demand; only the expenses are evident, and God on fy , -.f a f USe 0 1 [ re g a rds the ship on which was dispatched the red oxide for the firm of As.ar, on whom you drew the bill, the partners do not know how the business ended ^ apparently the expenses were not covered Mines out of which so small a protit is made need not necessarily be worked with such assiduity.

UNDER instructions from my Government, I have the honour to transmit herewith six copies of a second memorandum drawn up by the German Government on the subject ot the Abu Musa incident, in reply to the Memorandum of the British Government. The Memorandum sets forth the general and legal position as established by facts and proofs. It comes to the conclusion that the action of the Sheikh of Shargeh against the mining company, Hassan-ibn-Ali and Co., was illegal, that in its ultimate aim it was directed against the contract between Herr Robert Wonckhaus and the mining company, and that the forcible measures taken by the sheikh were directly promoted by the agents Organen') of the British Government. According to the ordinary principles of law, therefore, the British Government and the sheikh are jointly responsible for the consequences of these actions. On the one hand, Herr Robert Wonckhaus should be compensated for the, damage'which he sustained through the Tton-fulfllment of the contract consequent upon the mfring%ment of the rights of the mining company by the sheikh, supported by the agents of the British Government. On the other hand, the firm of Robert Wonckbaus and Co, should be compensated, as a participant in the mining company, for their share of the damage sustained by the mining company through the suspension of operations. A detailed calculation of the damage is reserved. In order to obviate an increase of the damage and to put an end to the existing disturbance to property, the mining company should be permitted with the greatest promptitude to continue their mining operations. Having regard to the present position of affairs, the German Government believe that they should first of all only apply to the British Government to take steps for the removal of the disturbance to property and for the granting of compensation for damage sustained. If, contrary to expectation, the British Government should not admit the grounds on which the attitude of the German Government is based, as set forth in the Memo randum, and should adhere to the negative view which they have hitherto adopted, the German Government are of opinion that the point at issue should be referred to the Permanent Tribunal at The Hague.

IN consequence of what is stated in the Memorandum of His Majesty's Govern ment of the 10th July, 1908, the Imperial German Government have again examined the complaint of the German firm, Robert Wonckhaus and Co., of Lingah, in regard to the occurrences on the island of Abu Musa. In this examination they have' given every consideration to the arguments used in the Memorandum, and to the documents communicated to them. From a.comparison of the British Memorandum with the first German Memorandum (of December 1907), it appears that the following facts are not disputed ;— Till the spring of 1883 Sheikh Salim-ibn-Sultan-ibn-Sakar Alkasimi (referred to below for short as Sheikh Salim or Salim), was reigning Sheikh of Shargeh, to the territory of which the island of Abu Musa belongs. During the time that he was in [2574 c—1] B2 the Island of Abu Musa, in which he always took a particular interest, and where he had built himself a dwelling-house and had established date plantations, he was deposed by his nephew, the present reigning Sheikh Sakar-ibn-Khalid (called below for short, Sheikh Sakar or Sakar). Sheikh Sakar at that time intended to drive Sheikh SaLm out of Abu Musa by force, but was prevented from doing so by the British resident in the Persian Gulf. Nevertheless Salim left Abu Musa and went to Lingah, until, in July 1883 an agreement was made between the two sheikhs, according to which ! f Sheikh Sakar was to pay to Sheikh Salim an annual pension of 600 dollars. There- ' upon Salim returned to Abu Musa. |n 1884, however, differences again arose between . •/ , , &lt; the two in consequence of political intrigues of Salim against Sakar, and Sakar several ' times complained to the British resident in letters. As Salim was in financial straits he was obliged to give in, and a second agreement was arrived at. Under this agreement Sakar, for whose means the pension of 600 dollars previously settled was too high, granted his uncle a pension of 400 dollars annually, half to be paid in money and half in kind. The revenue from the Island of Sir Abu Nuair, said to amount to 200 dollars, was also assigned to Salim. After this the relations of the two sheikhs remained peaceful until the spring of 1889, when, as is alleged, Saiim was making prepara tions for an attack on Shargeh. The British agent at Shargeh, however, succeeded in reconciling the two sheikhs, and persuaded them to conclude a new agreement (6th April, 1889). By this Sakar undertook to continue the payment of the t/KA tM-t \ pension of 400 dollars, allowed Salim to live at Shargeh within certain bounds, and - ; promised to treat him in other respects also in accordance with his rank. The Island of Sir, which produced no revenue, was not mentioned in this agreement. Salim undertook to keep the peace and to obey his nephew. The two sheikhs afterwards lived on good terms, so that Sheikh Salar, when absent from his capital, entrusted the government to his uncle. (Annexes Nos. 2 to 6 of the British Memorandum.) By a document dated the 10th April, 1898 (18 Dulkade, 1815), Sheikh Salim leased the red oxide mines on the Island of Abu Musa for an annual rent of 250 French reals, to the British subjects, Alhaj Hassan-ibn-Ali Samaih (called below Hassan Samaih, for short), his son Abdallah-ibn-Hassan (Abdallah, for short), and Isa-ibn- Abdallatif (Isa, for short), son of the British consular agent at Shargeh, Abdallatif-ibn- Abdarrahman, who represented his son in all business of the company of lessees. At that time Sheikh Salim was Regent of Shargeh, as Sheika Sakar was absent on a pilgrimage to Mecca. The rent was paid regularly, and received by Sheikh Salirn.' :!: ' On the 19th August, 1898 (l Eebi-el-Tani, 1316), Sheikh Sakar was received into the company of lessees as a shareholder on an equal footing with the others. He, however, on the 29th January, 1899, (17 Ramadan, 1316), made his share over to one Yussuf-bin-Abdallah, who transferred it to Hassan Samaih. This share was, on the 10th October, 1907, sold by Hassan Samaih to Thomas Brown, a British subject, from whom it was purchased by the firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Co., of Lingah, on the 16th October, 1907. (Annexes 3 to 4 e of the first German Memorandum.) Previously to this, on the 1st June, 1906, a contract (Annex 5 of the first German Memorandum and Annex 10 of the British Memorandum) had been concluded between Hassan Samaih and the German merchant Robert W onckhaus, a partner in the firm of Wonckhaus and Co., under which from 2,000 to 5,000 tons of red oxide were to be delivered to Wonckhaus annually for four years from the mines on Abu Musa. The company had also contracted with another party to deliver 400 tons a-year for five years to India. (Annex 19 of the first German Memorandum.) On the 21st February, 1907 (9th Moharrem, 1325), Sheikh Sakar addressed a letter (Annex 12 of the first German Memorandum) to Hassan Samaih, in which he demanded that the working of the red oxide mines on Abu Musa should cease. The ostensible ground for this step is a complaint made by Isa to the sheikh that the contract for idelivery of red oxide had been made with Wonckhaus without his sanction. There upon a somewhat lengthy correspondence ensued between Hassan Samaih on the one St side and Sheikh Sakar, Sheikh Salim, and the British consular authorities on the other (Annexes 13 to 16, 18 to 20 of the first German Memorandum) until Sheikh Sakar, in two letters of the 3rd October, 1907 (25 Shaban, 1325), one of which was to be handed to Hassan Samaih, and his receipt obtained, in the presence of the British consular agent at Lingah, again ordered that the work should cease. (Annexes 21 and 22 of the first German Memorandum.) Thereupon, about the 20th October, 1907, Sheikh Sakar sent armed men to the island, who compelled the miners to leave and forcibly prevented further work at the mines, * Annexes 1 to 5.%1 The boats containing the sheikhas armed force were towed to Abu Musa by the 'British war-ship c&lt; Lapwing/' on board which was Lieutenant C. H. Gabriel, British Tice-consul at Bunder Abbas. About mid-day on the 23rd October (a few hours after the departure of the British war-ship) two employes of the firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Co , who had approached the island in order to land on it, were received with bullets by the sheikh ? s armed men, and forced to turn back; The facts being as stated above, there is a difference of opinion as to whether SheiShTSakS'acting as he did. Whereas the British Memorandum maintains that there was nothing illegal in Sheikh Sakar's proceedings, the Imperial Government are still of opinion that he had no legal right, either by private or by public law, to cancel of his own motion the lease agreement concluded by Sheikh Salim, and that the forcible execution of his decision must undoubtedly be regarded as an illegal act. /ojids, (A).—Position of Sheikh Sakar with respect to the Company of Lessees, prom the point op view op private LAW. It is stated in the British Memorandum that the Island of Abu Musa is the property o f Shei kh Sakar, and that it was only as the representative of Sakar and while he acted as regent during the latter's pilgrimage, that Sheikh Salim concluded the lease agreement; that the island is an integral part of the dominions of the Sheikh of Shargeh, who in recent years has regularly sent his cattle to graze on the island; and that Sheikh Sakar, who after the deposition of Salim made the latter an allowance, had, solely in consequence of oral and personal arrangements, increased this allowance by the revenue of Abu Musa, including that derived from the red oxide mines. In proof of this the British Memorandum first cites a letter from Salim to Sakar of the 21st February, 1908 (Annex 1 of British Memorandum), in which Salim declares that he has no claim to the island and has never put forward any claim to it, and then a kind of Memorandum of Sheikh Sakar, dated the 22nd February, 1898* (Annex 5 of British Memorandum), in which he gives an account of his relations with Salim and his arrangements with him in regard to property. Further, there are cited two letters from Sakar to the British resident in the Persian Gulf, dated the 21st January and 14th February, 1884 (Annexes 3, 4 of the British Memorandum), in which Sakar describes Abu Musa as 'our island and a dependency of Shargah,' as well as the agreement between the two sheikhs, of the 6th April, 1889) (Annex 2 of the British Memorandum). Finally, reference is made to a Memorandum of Major P. Z. Cox, British resident in the Persian Gulf, dated the 28th February, 1.908, on the history of Abu Musa (Annex 6 of the British Memorandum), and to a letter from Sakar to the British resident, Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball, dated the llth October, 1902 (Annex 7 of British Memorandum), which is held to show that in concluding the lease agreement, Salim was acting in his capacity of regent. Before these arguments are examined, attention must be called to an inaccuracy in the text of the British Memorandum. It is there stated that Sakar granted to Salim the revenue of the island, including that derived from the mines. Sakar in his own / ; accou nt only speaks of having assigned to Salim the amount^of the rent of the oxide mmes,~m\?ohS5que'nce of his complaint that his income was insufficient. As regards the evidence produced, the Imperial Government regret that they are unable to accept as unobjectionable testimony the letter of Sheikh Salim to Sheikh Sakar, dated the 21st February, 1908, to which the first place is assigned in the British Memorandum. This letter and Sakar's Memorandum of the 22nd February, 1908, which must be regarded simply as the version of an interested party and valueless as evidence, were written at a time when efforts were being made to collect proofs of the . :' j legality of the steps taken by Sakar against the company of lessees. The Imperial Government have information that Major Cox was at Shargeh just at that time. The contents of both documents are so much out of harmony with the former attitude of the two sheikhs and with facts which will be mentioned further on, that one can qnly conclude that the sheikhs at the later period gave a different account of the proprietary rights on Abu Musa. Sakar's letters to the British resident in 1884 (Annexes 3, 4 of the British Memorandum) are no evidence of Sakar's ownership of the island. In order to under stand them fully, one must remember that they were written at a time when Salim was living at Abu Musa after being deposed by Sakar, when the two sheikhs were enemies, and when Sakar still had to fear resistance on the part of the former ruler, and perhaps * Sic [? 1908]. mmwM iv JJGn j &gt;: f ... mmeven the seizure and retention of part of his dominions by him. But Sa,kar, having' undertaken the government of Shargeh, was responsible for the preservation of peace in accordance with the Maritime Truce, as is explained in the Memorandum by Major Cox referred to above. He therefore begged the British resident to warn Salim to keep quiet, and in order to justify his request laid stress on the fact that Abu Mnsa was politically a dependency of Shargeh. The sole object of the letters therefore was to put an end to the political conflict between the two sheikhs. This view is supported by the tollowing minute (printed in Annex 6 of the British Memorandum), which appears with Sakar's second letter, in the archives of the British resident:— 'Sheikh Sagar seems to insist that if Salim continues to live on Bu Musa he should give a guarantee through the resident that he will not do anything to disturb him, Sheikh Sagar, or the maritime peace.' So that when we find in the one letter the words: ' Abu Musa is an island dependent on Shargah, and we cannot spare it to others,' and in the other the words; ' Bu Musa is our island and a dependency of Shargah,' this can only refer, according to the whole context, to the circumstance that the island belongs to the territory of Shargah. Consistently with this, Salim himself, as mentioned below (p. 6), describes Abu Musa in several letters and documents as 'my' or 'our' island (meaning, that is, that he is the private owner), and as ' a dependency of Shargah.' If Sheikh Sakar goes on to write: ' I cannot dispense with the Island of Bu Musa, as it is oi: great use to me,' this can only be taken, in view of the context just referred to, in a political sense and not in the sense of private ownership. In the British Memorandum these letters are made use of to support the assertion that Salim's presence on Abu Musa was only ' tolerated.' The contention is evidently that Salim had no right whatever to live on Abu Musa, and that if he did live there, it was really only owing to the kindness of Sakar. But it appears from what has been said above that this 'toleration' is to be understood entirely in a political sense and has nothing to do with the question of private ownership. No doubt Sheikh Sakar was at liberty to banish his political opponent from the country and also to prevent him from residing on his private estate. If Sakar did not do this, that is no reason for concluding that Salim had no right, from the point of view of private law, to reside at Abu Musa. Salim's right to live at Abu Musa on the strength of his owning private property there, and Sakar's decision to tolerate his presence there, in spite of political hostility, are such very different things that conclusions cannot possibly be drawn from one to the other. Those letters, then, have nothing to do with the question of private ownership. In any case, they cannot be cited to disprove the private ownership of Salim. If, however, they are to be considered as having a bearing on this question, they would seem rather to point to the conclusion that Sakar regarded Abu Musa as a domain of Salim, from which he would have to drive him if Salim was guilty of political misconduct by interfering in Sakar's affairs or disturbing the peace. (' If Salim wants to live in it and guarantees that he will not commit anything which would interfere with my affairs or disturb the maritime peace, it matters not . . . .') The letter, too, which Sakar addressed to Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball on the l lth October, 1902 (Annex 7 of the British Memorandum), seems, on closer examination, to have a very different meaning from that assigned to it in the British Memorandum. In order to understand the letter, it would be interesting to know the purport of Kemball's inquiry, to which Sakar's letter was an answer and which is not printed in the Memorandum. Other known facts, however, make it possible to form an idea of what led to the letter being written and enable one to arrive at a proper appreciation of its contents. On p. 9 of the ' Administration Report on the Persian Gulf Residency and Muscat Political Agency for 1898-9,' the following passage occurs:— ' It is reported that the uncle of the Sheikh of Shargah has given a long lease of some oxide mines to Haji Ali Dubash, also known as Nakhoda Ali, who is a resident of Bushire, where he got into trouble and had to leave. He is said to have already exported 400 tons of oxide, and a further enquiry into the concession will be made when an opportunity offers.' It is not stated where these mines are situated, but, in any case, Lieutenant- Colonel Kemball certainly seems to have considered the sheikh's 'uncle, Salim, as the owner of the mines in question, as otherwise the above passage, which says nothing about a regency or representation, would have left open the question how Salim came to give the lease. It is to be presumed that later on the resident, carrying out hisoSS£ I!Sir, with -s-t s ^ ^ island unc ^ e » Sheikh Salim-bin-Sultan cultivates in that ^ lent^trlT J T ^ 1 Went f 1 the la 7 aforesaid uncle was acting as Samafieh a R-itIS — ^ 1 lease the mines of Abu Musa to Bassan-bin- Wets Uainlfup t^owT Abdalkh - bin -H^B and Esa-bin-Abdul Latif, and the the contraiy^the wnrda^' With ™ l f*™ 8 0Illy f . re 8 on ?- , 0 n iqknri ??

As stated -bove the arrangement of^1889 was preceded by other agreements respecting the pecuniary 4nn lP f i i r tl0 ^i, ' an - ia 0rder to mcrease his pension, which had been reduced to ■' 400 dollars, the revenue of the Island of Sir Abu Nuair, estimated at 200 dollars, was 1 • assigned to him. How if the revenue of an island was to be given to Salim would it • De ^ n -^ aturai to gi ve jnm that of the Island of Abu Musa, which he could have ■ r. ^ d an ' lf necessary, collected himself, since he resided in the island ? Of course L it ^.uu Musa was already Salim's property this expedient could not be adopted.

There is no mention here of a necessity for the'recognition nf the agreement oy Sakar or of a right of Sakar to terminate it; while in his letter of February '&gt;2° 1908 1p British Memo rand mn.) ' *** ob J ectionable « and so I acquiesced in it.' ^ (Annex 5 of [2574 C—1] cnow be 'made to certain circumstances which constitute direct evidence 01 Salim s ownership. Salim has always exercised the right to wreckage on Abu Musa. In 1898 a boat belonging to Hassan Samaih grounded on Abu Musa. Salim claimed part of the cargo on account of his right to wreckage, but finally withdrew this claim in consequence or the intervention of Abdallatif, and informed the latter of his decision in a letter ot the 23rd March, 1898 (29 Shavval, 1315).* Salim here speaks of the ' right belonging to wg 't and of ' oMr Island of A bu M usa.' - ' Furtl)er, a boat belonging to Abdallah Muhammed Hassan Alkhadja, a merchant of Lingah who had for many years carried on an active trade with the Oman coast,^ grounded on Abu Musa about seven years ago, and Salim, not Sakar, took possession of the boat and cargo as wreck. The question of the sum to be paid to Salim or tne proportion of the cargo to be kept by him afterwards formed the subject of long negotiations with Salim, which Hassan Samaih and his son Abdallah conducted on behalf of Abdallah Muhammed. Sheikh Salim concluded two lease agreements respecting the oxide mines : the first on the 6th April, 1898 (14 Dulkade, 1315),J the second on the 10th April, 1898 (18 Dulkade, 1315).§ The first was expressly cancelled by the second. Neither contains any reference to the regency or representation. On the other hand, the first agreement contains the passage ; ' So long as I, my children, and my brothers live no one shall have a right to raise objections to it (i.e., the lease).' This clearly expresses that Salim regarded himself as the owner, since he speaks of himself and his heirs, which would be impossible if he had only been acting as the representative of Sakar. If the lease agreement had been concluded in Sakar's name, Salim could not have declared that no one (including, therefore, Sakar) was to have a right to raise objections, and, moreover, there would have been no sense m mentioning Salim's heirs in the agreement. In the second agreement Salim further secured for himself an annual payment of 100 French reals for the trade in mother-of-pearl and canary seed. Salim has always levied this sum from the lessees as well as the rent, it; tKeaocument of the 19th August, 1898 ( 1 Rebi-ul-Tani, 1315; Annex 3 of first German Memorandum), in which Sheikh Sakar announces his entry into the mining company, pay a proportional part of the mother-of-pearl due. This is absolutely inconsistent with Sakar's assertion that he had granted to Salim and at the same time shows that Salim had a right to the enjoyment in his own name of all sources of profit to be derived from Abu Musa, and that he could exercise this right even .as again st the reigni ng s heikh. .• . / • v •;.*' —f'' Anotutr HrcumsCanceof particular importance in connection with the question as Id which of the two sheikhs is 'the owner of Abu Musa is, that on the 26th December, 1898 (12 Shaban, 1316),[j that is long after Sakar had returned and Salim's regency | had come to an end, Salim leased to Hassan Samaih, Abdallah, and Isa all the deposits |of mica on Abu Musa. The lease is for a term of five years, and a total sum of 11,500 French reals is to be paid for it. In the document Salim expressly speaks of ' our Island of Abu Musa.'^[ The price of the lease was paid to Salim by bill. On the 6th January, 1899 (23 Shaban, 1316), 00 Abdallatif sends to Hassan Samaih the draft of a Memorandum of Association respecting the working of both the oxide and the mica mines, ft In sending it he observes that Sakar has seen the Memorandum, and wishes to have a copy of it.t| Sakar, therefore, knew the terms of the agreement about the mica mines, and knew that the rent was paid to Salim, but he had no objection to make to the arrangement. If Salim. has no right of any kind to the island, and if Sakar allows him to have the revenue from the oxide concession simply out of liberality, how is it that Salim of his own authority lets the mica deposits and takes the rent before Sakar's very eyes, and without protest on his part ? This rent of 1,500 French reals was a very con siderable sum to the Sheikhs Salim and Sakar, who are by no means rich.

This conclusion is supported by the opinion prevailing among the most respectable natives on the point in question. ' ,: cj. ' . 0 Ihe mercnant, Abda.lmuhsin-ibn-Ahmed Almushari, who lias had mi intimate acquaintance with the affairs of the Pirate Coast for many years ; the merchant French consu ar agent, Abdarrahman-ibn-Muhammed-ibn-Kazim, who has permanent trade connections with Shargeh ; as well as Hamd-ibn-Khalifa Afuyuni, merchant and agent ox the bultan of Muscat—all three residents of Lingah—have declared in writing that u. ..heir certain knowledge Abu Musa has always been, and still is, the free property of balim.T Ihe two last-mentioned have also assured the Imperial vice-consul at Bush ire orally tuat everyone who has any knowledge of affairs on the Arabian Coast knows this as well as they do. But even if it be possible to doubt Salim's right to Abu Musa as its formal owner according to European legal principles, it cannot be questioned that he exercised, with the consent of the reigning sheikh, and even as against him, the full right of disposal of the usufruct, just like an owner. ^ ine English view, indeed, is that Sakar is the owner of the oxide mines, and that oalim conciuued the lease agreement respecting them as his representative only. But even in that case Sakar had no right, from the point of view of private law, to terminate the agreement of his own motion. Ihe lease agreement of the 10th April, 1898, states expressly that the lease shall run tor so long as the lessees ' have an interest in the aforesaid mines.' So that the lessees only are to have the riglTt to Terminate, and not the lessor. i t will be seen that this was the intention of the parties if the first lease agreement datea the 6th April, 1898, is referred to for comparison. In this agreement, which was cone nded ^ only with Hassan Samaih and his son Abdallah, the right of working the mines is given to the lessees for so long as they find oxide, but for not longerthan ' twenty years, with the proviso that they can terminate the agreement at any time on paying one year s rent. Here already a long term was agreed upon for the benefit of .;he lessees, thereupon Abdallatifs son Isa was received as a partner, and the new * Annex 15. j xinnexes 16 to 18.lease agreement of the 10th April, 1898, was drafted by Abdallatii. The oxide business was at that time considered very profitable. The lessees, and especially Abdallatii^ therefore wished to secure it for as long as possible. Accordingly the stipulation of a definite term of years was omitted in the second agreement. And in order to exclude any possible doubt as to the bearing of the two agreements upon each other, it was expressly laid down in the second agreement that any agreements previously concluded were to be considered null and void and that the second agreement alone was to be binding. Apart from the fact that it is the universal practice in that region, and a common practice in other parts of the world, to insert such a clause in agreements of this kind, the clause in this case serves the practical purpose of invalidating, expressis verbis, the provisions of the former agreement. But the lessees would certainly not have consented to an alteration of the first agreement if their rights had thereby been diminished. The history of the origin of the final lease agreement accordingly shows clearly that it was the intention of the parties that the lessor should be permanently hound, while the lessees should be at liberty to terminate the agreement. This intention has been expressed in the agreement in a manner that cannot be misunderstood. How, in spite of the clear wording of the two agreements, it can be said that there is no real lease agreement, but only u a mere permit to the partners terminable on either side at any time,' is as difficult to understand as the attempt to draw from the right of the lessees to terminate the agreement and from the clause cancelling previous agree ments the conclusion that the lessor had also reserved to himself the right to terminate the contract. These conclusions are certainly not supported by the documents bearing on the matter. It appears from one of Sakar's letters to Hassan Samaih (Annex 12 of the first German Memorandum) that one of the considerations which chiefly induced Sakar to take steps against the company oTI^sees was the idea that he would suffer loss in consequence of the agreement of the lessees with Wonckhaus. In connection with the other pretexts brought forward by Sakax in his various letters to Hassan Samaih, it may be conjectured that here, too, we have to deal with an apprehension on the part of Sakar which belongs rather to the realm of politics, and which w T ill be discussed later (pp. 17, 18), namely, that the agreement with Wonckhaus might tend to bring about the gradual separation of the Island of Abu Musa from the dominions of the sheikh. The British Memorandum gives a different explanation of this matter, and states in justification of Sakar s attitude that, in view of the rise of the price of oxide in the market, his J pecuniary interest in the mines was not properly safeguarded by the rent of 250 reals fixed for an indefinite time. In other words, Sakar cannot recognise the lease agree ment any longer if the other party makes large profits in consequence of the rise of market prices, while he (as lessor) has to be contented with the rent; the lessor is therefore bound by the agreement only so long as the lessee does not make considerably more than the amount of the rent. It may be that Sheikh Sakar s ideas of the limits of legality and violence are somewhat undeveloped, and that he considers himself bound by agreements only so long as he profits more by them than the other contracting party. If, however, he were allowed to put such ideas into practice it would involve the admission that Europeans or the proteges of European Powers have no rights whatever in the territory of an Arabian sheikh, and that it is permissible for the latter to act as he pleases without regard for good faith or legality. During the long years when the company was working at a loss he did nothing. Now, when there is a prospect of more profitable business for the future, he discovers that the rent is not sufficient. If Sakar wished to participate in the gains of the company, he ought to have retained his share in the company and borne a proportional part of its losses. Surely the object of the agreement between Wonckhaus and the company of lessees is, on the one hand, to make the purchaser of the oxide independent of the fluctuations of the market and insure his obtaining a certain quantity at a fixed price, and, on the other hand, to enable the working company to count with certainty upon selling a definite quantity and obtaining a certain income. Supposing that the market value of oxide fell below the price agreed upon between Wonckhaus and the company of lessees, this would, according to Sheikh Sakar s ideas of justice, give the German firm the right to declare : ' As in these circumstances the mining company is earning money while we . are losing, we consider the agreement as no longer valid.' From the legal point of view, the question whether, assuming that Sakar is the / lessor, he is able to terminate the lease agreement because the lessee has begun to earn money and the rent does not appear sufficient to him, Sakar, is one that cannot be9 discussed serious!yv ^ The point has been examined here only in order to show the weakness of the position taken up by Sakar. ^ question of the termination of the lease agreement opinions''* have been obtained liom the leading merchantsf at Lingah and Bussorah, and from the most important ciergyT at Lingah, bhargeh, and Debai,§ who have given their views on the matter Avai the point of view of commercial law and from that of religious law. The reference waB maae in the form usual in that region, the agreement in question being submitted to them in copy, together with certain questions in writing, and their opinions being given without a detailed statement of the legal grounds on which thev were based. |1' ^ All the opinions come practically to the same conclusion. The legal construction of the case is, however, not the same in commercial law as in religious law. According^to commercial Jaw, the lease agreement is valid; the lessor cannot terminate it so long as the lessees 44 wish to keep the object leased in accordance with the agreement, liie agreement could only be terminated by amicable arrangement, since the lessor was not forced to sign it, but did so of his own free will. According to religious lo..w the lease agreement is invalid, because a consideration was stipulated for the use ot the mines, while oxide and similar minerals lying on the surface are the common property of ali Mohammedans^ and the lessor has accordingly conferred a right which he did not possess. But any person who discovers or works the mines tnereby acquires the right to exploit them, and is at liberty to dispose of the produce as he chooses. Sheikh Salim or Sheikh Sakar ? whichever of them is to be considered the lessor, has no claim to the rent, and Hassan Samaih or the company of lessees has, by working the mines, acquired a right to them. The Ruler of the territory cannot dispose of the mines, and he cannot prevent the person who has acquired them by working them from exercising his right. bo that both the commercial law and the religious law forbid the lessor to terminate the agreement, the latter absolutely, and the former on the assumption that the lessee acts in accordance with the terms of the agreement. This has been done* The rent has been paid regularly. The sale to foreigners is not a breach of the agreement, since it is not forbidden by the agreement ; indeed, it is expressly contemplated in the Memorandum of Association (pp. 14, 15), which will be mentioned further on, with the consent of Sakar as at that time a shareholder. Accordingly, neither Sakar nor Salim has a right to terminate the agreement. (B.)—T he P osition oe S heikh S akar with respect to the C ompany op L essees prom the point op view op public law. As observed in the British Memorandum, the reigning Sheikh of Shargeh is the absolute ruler of his country. The final appeal is accordingly to him in all matters concerning the political administration of his country. The British Memorandum further remarks that the principal object of Sakar was to administer justice as between the partners of the company on the strength of his ' sovereign rights of jurisdiction. In connection with this point, the question must be considered as to whether Sakar had authority to decide as judge the dispute between the partners of the mining company, and whether the decision arrived at was justified by law, or whether he had power to cancel the lease at his discretion in the interest of the administration of the country. ^ Annexes 19 to 24. | Some of the Lingah merchants come from the Oman coast, have branches or ag-ents there and have for many years been doing a very active trade with the places on the Oman coast;'they have therefore an accurate knowledge of the mercantile customary law there. Among the opinions is that of Abdallah Miihamrned Hassan Alkhadja, a man who, on account of his experience and reputation, is a recognized arbitrator in commercial matters, whose opinion is asked for by Persians and Arabians of the Persian and Arabian coasts as far as Bahrein, and to whose decisions they willingly submit. ^ A v ' v t Among the religious opinions are those of Muhammed Mahdi-ibn-Abdallah and Yussuf-lbn-Muhammed» ibn -Abdallah, judges at Lingah. § Annexes 25 to 31. j| To the clergy at Shargeh and Debai was submitted a fictitious agreement, the contents of which were in harmony with the agreement of April 10, 1898, in which only the names of persons and places were changed, and dates were spoken of instead of mother-of-pearl, and ' mines' mentioned instead of 'oxide mines/ In obtaining opinions it is usual in the Persian Galf to submit fictitious agreements whenever it is desired to conceal the names of persons and things, and so obviate the possibility of the referee being influenced.

' e djef, and that the latter J Annex 33.12 No objection to the agreement with Wonckhaus was raised by the British protege T. J. Malcolm, of Bushire, of whom the British Memorandum only says that the lessees had ' engagements' with him, while as a matter of fact he had entered the company two years after the conclusion of the lease agreement and paid capital into it once, being the only partner except Hassan Samaih who has paid in any. In the British Memorandum it is made a matter of reproach to Hassan Samaih that, in reply to Malcolm's letter of the 26th June, 1906, asking for a copy of the agreement, he, in the first place, answered on the 13th July, !906, that the agreement was drawn up in German, and that in a later letter, dated the 14th October, 1906, he again declined to | supply a copy on the ground that Mr. Wonckhaus had asked him not to say anything j about this business (Annexes 18, 14, of British Memorandum). No doubt Hassan ' Samaih ought not to have made use of the excuse that the agreement was in German; but his anxiety to keep the terms of the agreement secret as long as possible, and \ especially not to communicate them to the firm of A. and T. J. Malcolm, i g explained 5 by business considerations. For Malcolm was a competitor, since his firm of A. and T. J. Malcolm is-an agent for, and a shareholder in, the British firm of Strick and Co., in whose hands the Ormuz oxide trade is. Hassan Samaih had put his whole fortune of about 100,000 rupees into the Abu Musa oxide concern, which had so far been run at a loss, and which he now hoped would at last improve in consequence of the agree ment with Mr. Wonckhaus. He saw a great danger in the agreement getting to be known too early. Subsequent events have shown how well-founded his apprehension of further difficulties was. Although Hassan Samaih did not send Malcolm the copy of the agreement in the first instance, he nevertheless, in his letter of the 13th July, 1906, communicated to him all that was of importance in it, as is seen from Annex 13 of the British Memorandum ; in particular he did not, as alleged in the British Memorandum, omit to answer the question whether other European firms could make similar agreements, but said straight out ; ' We Pan therefore make no other contract.' In his reply of the 30th October, 1906 (11 Eamadan, 1324),* Malcolm says he will ^-'Bee whether it would be possible to sell the red oxide at a higher price or to get better terms, or whether, if it were found possible to obtain a higher price, the agreement I ?could be cancelled or not. He further expressly states : 'If we are not sure of getting a higher price, we shall not get the former agreement cancelled.' In other words, Malcolm would have liked to get a higher price and better terms, and if he found he could get such he would have liked either to come to an arrangement with Mr. Wonck- haus as to other terms, or if he (Malcolm) was able to obtain them from another party, to persuade Mr. Wonckhaus to allow the agreement to be cancelled by amicable arrangement. It follows from this, however, that he considered the agreement as perfectly valid in itself. When Malcolm, later on, received a copy of the agreement, he said no more about it, and accordingly acqiiiesced in it. It appears from a letter addressed by Abdallatif to Hassan Samaih, on the 23rd June, 1905 (19 Ilebi II, 1323),t and a letter from the latter to Abdallatif of the 15th October, 1905 (15 Shaban, 1323), (Annex 9 of the first German Memorandum) that at that time a considerable quantity of oxide was already being sold to Mr Wonck haus, and that it was proposed to supply oxide to Wonckhaus at a fixed price annually. As the correspondence shows, Abdallatit'agreed to this. After the conclusion of the agreement of the 1st June, 1906, with Mr. Bobert Wonckhaus for the delivery of oxide, \ : ' Hassan Samaih communicates the fact to Abdallatif on the 11th June (18 llebi II, 1324), and at the same time informs him of the substance of the agreement (Annex 11 of the British Memorandum). In his reply of the 14th June, 1906 (21 Bebi II, 1324),J \which has now become of importance, Abdallatif openly expresses his satisfaction at 1 the conclusion of the business, and the hope that better times are coming at last which will compensate for the sacrifices and disappointments of the past. The whole letter has evidently been written in a mood of relief, and furnishes indisputable evidence that Abdallatif gave his consent to the conclusion of the agreement. It is true that in this letter he again shows the sceptical spirit of a person who is experienced in affairs, and who therefore cannot feel any satisfaction without at the same time having fears of future difficulties ; he gives a warning against the conclusion of an agreement which would be equivalent to a lease of the mines or might give rise to difficulties which might conjure up the interference of more powerful persons. This is the meaning which must be attached to the letter when considered impartially. The German and the English translation (Annex 12 of the British Memorandum) of this letter correspond almost word for word. In particular the English translation too * Annex 84. f Annex 32. ^ Annex 35.13 makes it impcfssible^to doubt Abdallatifs absolute concurrence in the agreement with Wonckhaus. ilie passages in the English translation which bear on the point are the following:— \eiygooJ, 1 hope it is auspicious. It will be good fortune after trouble. In \ case, on Dim lei Abuullah must reach there to supervise the work, because I think the oper ations cannot oe regulated without him. .... At any rate, I am glad to hear tms news, l we are safe from this world's tricks more than before ^ ie British Memorandum says : Abdallatif comments upon the transaction in guarued language, it is adopting an interpretation which entirely ignores the passages just quoted, and gives disproportionate weight to the following sentence which is m very general terms :— o &amp; Please, however, refrain from entering upon any arrangements whatever in the nature ot eases or deeds of contract from which there will arise difficulties and quarrels wnich win lead to complaints and claims , , . Ait-er all, any agreement may lead to difficulties and quarrels, w 7 hich cannot be Awflw- - even ^ we S 0 SC J f ar as to see in this sentence a condition which ^ dallatii wishes to attach to the consent which he has already given, the condition is, L.iuit the agreement must not be a kind of lease, it must be said that this condition is completely fulfilled, for the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus is simply a contract for delivery and not a lease contract. f ^ ^ ^ n Q ot 1:111 abo y t four months later that Abdallatif, in a letter dated the 3rd October, v 1 ^ bbaban, 1324), begs Hassan Samaih to send him a copy of the agreement with TV onckhaus (Annex 7 of first German Memorandum). The reason for this is not that doubts have now suddenly arisen in Abdallatifs mind in regard to the agreement^ but simply that the consul J ' would like to see the agreements On the 16th December, 1906 (27 Shaval, 1324), Hassan Samaih complies with this request (Annex 15 of British Memorandum). On the 23rd January, 1907 (8 Dulhidje, 1324),t Abdallatif replies that his son Isa is not satisfied with the agreement, because he was not asked his opinion and because he iears that aifficulties may arise from the business connection with foreigners. He also reproaches Hassan bamaih for having exercised his own discretion in entering into the engagement, whereas he surely ought not to have bound himself without consulting the otnei partners. He goes on to say : u It is better to try to cancel the agreement than to do as he (the German) wishes. 'J The fact that Abdallatif only blames the inde pendent action of Hassan Samaih points to the conclusion that he does not dispute the legal validity of the agreement, and this is made quite clear by a consideration of ^kaj? short passage in the letter which deals with the question what is to be done now. Abdallatif simply advises that an attempt should be made to cancel the agreement! Tne British Memorandum translates the passage in question as follows :— ' The nullification of this agreement is better than its acceptance/' and explains that the phrase ' is better ' is a euphemism, common in the Arabic epistolary style, expressing a definite decision. In view, however, of the two enclosed opinions,§ which, while differing in details, in the result arrived at entirely support the view of the Imperial Government, the latter must adhere to their contention that the meaning of the passage in question can only be that the attempt should be made /o cancel the agreement. But this assumes that the agreement is legally valid. In giving this advice, Abdallatif himself admits that the agreement has legal force. Furthermore, Abdallatif in his next letter, dated the 2v th March, 1907 (12 Sefer, 1325),|| again admits that he originally, that is'in his letter of the 14th June, 1906 (21 Rebi II, 1324), concurred in the agreement. It is not easy to * In the circumstances this can only mean the British Consul, with whom Abdallatif, as cons^ar asrent is officially connected. ^ ' f Annex 36. | It is noticeable that Abdallatif allows more than a month to pass—-he received the letter on December 21, 1906, as appears from the letter of March 27, 1907—before he sends the answer whereas previously wlien Hassan Samaih informed him of the conclusion of the agreement only throe davs elapsed between the date of dispatch of this communication and the date on which he sent off his reply concurring- Thus we evidently have not here a spontaneous decision of Abdallatif founded entirely on his examination of the terms of the agreement. § Annexes 37 and 38. j| Annex 39. [2574 c—1] E14 understand how the British Memorandum can come to the opposite conclusion, when, even in the translation of the letter there printed (Annex 17 of the British Memorandum), we find the passage :— &lt;! 1 sent you back an answer, dated the 21st Rehi II, 1324, convey acquiescence. . . . The facts cited above show that Nejef-—if, indeed, he is to be considered a partner at all—as well as Malcolm and Abdallatif, the latter as the representative of his son Isa, declared their approval of the conclusion of the agreement between Hassan Samaih and Mr. Wonckhaus. Of course, the legal position is not affected by the circumstance that Nejef and Abdallatif subsequently denied that they had given their approval, or by the fact that, in particular, Abdallatif, after he had procured a copy of the agreement for the British consul, changed his mind about the agreement. But. apart from this, the Imperial Government are, moreover, of opinion that there was no necessity for Hassan Samaih to obtain the concurrence of the other partners, as he was the manager of the company. The circumstances of locality, apart from anything else, made it absolutely necessary that one of the partners should be authorised to represent the company alone in dealings with other persons, and to bind the company by his acts without the previous approval of the other partners. Isa lives at Shargeh, Malcolm at Bushire, Nejef—assuming that he is a partner—at Bunder Abbas, Hassan Samaih at Lingah. From Lingah to Bushire and from Bunder Abbas to Lingah there is a weekly post, from Bushire to Lingah and from Lingah to Bunder Abbas only a fortnightly post. Postal communication with Shargeh has only been established within the last few years ; at the time when the company was founded there were only sailing-boats available for the journey, which took from three to ten days, according to the weather, to reach Lingah from Shargeh. Telegraphic communication is entirely wanting on the Oman Coast ; the telegraph station on the Island of Henjam can be reached from Lingah by sailing-boat in from two to four days; the conveyance of a telegram from Henjam to Lingah takes the same time. How is it possible to imagine a properly conducted business with such bad means of communication if the managing partner, before con cluding a business transaction, has to ask the opinion of three people living respectively at Shargeh, Bushire, and Bunder Abbas, await their replies, perhaps answer objections, modify certain provisions in accordance with the wishes of one of the partners, and then again refer to the others for their sanction of the modifications ? This state of things being duly taken into consideration, a Memorandum of Association was agreed upon in which the rights and duties of the manager are regulated with some detail. In a letter dated the 6th January, 1899 (23 Shaban, 1316),* Abdallatif sent the Memorandum of Association, which he had himself drawn up, to Hassan Samaih at Lingah, and requested that aJl the partners there, Hassan Samaih, Abdallah, and Nakhoda Ali, would sign it and then send it back. In sending it he observes that Sheikhs Salim and Sakar have seen the Memorandum, and that Sakar has asked for a copy, which shows that Sakar, too, approved of the Memorandum. Hassan Samaih, Abdallah, and Nakhoda Ali signed the Memorandum, added an additional article. No. 6, providing for the purchase of four large and four small boats at the expense of the company, and sent the altered Memorandum to Abdallatif, Hassan Samaih keeping a copy. On the 21sfc January, 1899 (9 Ramadan, 1316),f Abdallatif wrote that he had shown the Memorandum to Isa and Sakar,'i but that they had not agreed to the engagement of eight boats for the service of the company. No other objections were raised, which is quite natural, as the remainder of the Memorandum had been drafted by Abdallatif himself, and had already been agreed to by the partners living at Shargeh. As Hassan Samaih at once replied that he and the two other partners at Lingah consented to the cancelling of the boats, all the partners were now in agreement as to the contents of the Memorandum of Association. No fresh copy of the Memorandum was made, and none was necessary, since the correspondence which had passed showed that all had approved of its contents. In consequence of the adoption of this new Memorandum of Association, the older provisions not in harmony with it, which were agreed upon when Nakhoda Ali joined in May 1898, of course ceased to be in force. * Annexes 18 and 14. f Annex 40. J The communication of the Memorandum to Sakar is explained by the fact that at that time he was still a partner.15 The arrangements made at that time for working together, however, had reference only to the collection ot mother-of-pearl.

That thxs is the meaning ol article 1 is, moreover, shown with particular clearness by the ciicumstance that, in the articles which follow, those cases are expressly mentioned m which the concurrence of the other partners The principle obstrved is quite clear: in the case of transactions which are intended to bring in revenue to the company, and which often necessitate a rapid decision, as, for instance, tiisi conclusion of sates, the manager acts quite independently ; but where it is a case of spending money for the company ana throwing a burden on the individual partners, their concurrence must first be obtained, ^ Hassan feamaih, as a matter of fact, always availed himself of his powers as manager from the time that the company was founded, and this is shown by a number of the letters in the annexes inter alia. He concluded sales independently, amongst others, previously with the firm of ^/V onckhaus and Co., he kept the company's books, and signed with the signature of the firm. The post delivered to him all letters addressed to the firm, xhe otner partners raised no objections to these proceedings, and even if the above-mentioned Memorandum of Association did not exist, one would be justified in concluding that the partners concurred in his acting as manager from the fact that he occupied the position for many years without opposition. But there are further proofs that Hassan Samaih was always recognised as manager. 1 When on one occasion difficulties _ arose in connection with a sale of oxide, and Hassan Samaih asked Malcolm for advice, the latter answered, on the': 2nd February 1901 (12 Shaval, 1318), J that he, Malcolm, could not do anything, although he was 'a partner, because an individual partner had not a right to act. That the firm of Stnck and Co., too, had partners, but an individual partner of that firm could not engage in law-suits for the firm, but only a person authorised to do so; and that Hassan Samaih must bring the action himself. It could not be stated more' distinctly that Hassan Samaih is the manager of the company. ' After the cancellation of the lease agreement by Sakar, Hassan Samaih asked Malcolm for his advice as to what he should do. Malcolm answered, in a letter dated the 7th November, 1907,§ that, as Hassan was a British subject, he had better anply to the British consulate-general That is to say, a partner/who is not authorised to represent the firm himself, advises the managing partner to take steps on behalf of the firm, ^ In a letter dated the 13th July, 1902 (7 Eebi II, 1320),|| Malcolm makes an offer addressed to Alhadj Hassan-ibn-Samaih and on behalf of Strick and Co. Hassan Samaih is to telegraph his reply and to guarantee the quality of the oxide. Nothing is said of the other partners; their concurrence, which, indeed, could not have been obtained in time, is not asked for. Here, again, Hassan Samaih appears as the * In the Arabic text the word u eledjnebiye '—foreign '—is used. ,, t In Britisl1 Memorandum Hassan Samaih is blamed for describing himself in the aereempnt with Mr, Wonckhaus as ' owner and holder of Bu Musa Concession.' These words appear only in the headi™ rrf the agreement and are inaccurate for the reason that Hassan left out the words 'and Co.' signature to the agreement, which alone has legal force, and which was affixed in the form prescribed ir, Memorandum of Association, clearly shows that Hassan Samaih signed, not for himself personally, but for | Annex 41. § Annex 42.

It is not a case of a single sale, )U ^ 0 an agreement, very similar to that with Wonckhaus, under which the company die bound to the offer for six months until the arrival of Strick and Cos. answer, an may not sell to anyone else for six months after the loading of the oxide. It remains to examine the question whether Hassan bamaih injured the company by the conclusion of the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus and whether Isa womd av ? e been justified in complaining on this ground. It appears, from the account 01 iSdS complaint given in the British Memorandum, that the company is held to ^have been injured by the circumstance that, in consequence of the agreement with Mr. W(3nckhaus, it is precluded from profiting by any rise that may take place in the price of oxide. That is an objection that might be raised against any contract for delivery concludea for a certain term, and is of no importance so far as Mr. Wonckhaus is concerned. There might possibly, indeed, be a question whether the agreement as a wnole is injurious to the interests of the company, and whether in the circumstances Hassan Samaih, as a good man of business, was justified in concluding such an agreement for the company. f ^ The orovisions of the agreement are in substance as follows. The company is bound to 1 deliver to Mr. Wonckhaus free on board ship at Abu Musa annually for a term of four years 25000 to 5,000 tons of oxide of a particular quality at the price of 15s. 6d, per ton. Mr. Wonckhaus is bound to pay this price and to take at least 2j000 tons, and, further, if he requires more, and there is enough^ oxide, to buy up to 5,000 tons. On the other hand, the company may not sell oxide to anyone else, with the exception of about 5,000 to 6,000 sacks, which it may seil to India. On the expiration of the agreement Mr. Wonckhaus has the right of renewing the agreement on the same terms or the terms offered by another serious applicant. For a proper appreciation of this agreement it must be remembered that^ the company had till then worked at a heavv loss. It appears from the books of the Company— -whic h .were kept very neatly, cle arly, and well—that the total expenditure from the commencement of the works to the beginning of December 19U8 amounted to 801,043 rupees.'® On the other side, the receipts amount to 207,804 rupees,_ so that there is a deficit of 93,209 rupees. These figures show that the financial position of the company was very bad, and that it would have had to work at a profit for a long time before the previous losses could have been made good and a dividend declared. ' The agreement with M. Wonckaus gave the company an opportunity of selling, a,t a fixed ''price, which was independent of the fluctuations of the market, and was guaranteed to it for a number of years, a considerable minimum quantity of oxide, and possibly two and a-half times as much. The company was therefore in a position to count with certainty on receiving a minimum of l,5o0/. a-year, and to arrange its whole work accordingly. These receipts might be raised to 3,87 not counting what was sold to India. The prospects of the company from a commercial point of view were therefore such as it had never had before. It was in the nature of things that the company should have to accept into the bargain certain limitations and obligations. Agreements like the one in question between producers and merchants are usual in all parts' of the world, and if a normal price and a fixed minimum sale are guaranteed to the producer, he on his part must give security to the merchant, who makes his arrangements accordingly, that the article shall not suddenly be diverted into the hands of his competitors. The chief point is that the risk to the producer here sinks to a minimum, while the risk to the merchant remains great. He is bound to take over the minimum quantity at the guaranteed price, and runs the risk of having to do so when the market price is such that he is obliged to sell the article at a small profit or no profit at all, or even at a loss, or he may have to buy it when he cannot sell it at all. It is likewise a very ordinary thing that, in view of these possibilities, the price should from the first be fixed at such a figure that _ a certain margin is left to the merchant, since otherwise the latter could not take part in the transaction at all. Tne circumstance also deserves particular consideration that, in a case like the one under discussion, the producer is not in a position to avail himself of the opportunities of gain to the same extent as the merchant. However skilled in business Hassan Samaih and Abdallatif mav be, it will not be possible for them to dispose of the produce of the oxide mines on Abu Musa directly and without the interposition of a middleman, and to profit bv the constant changes in the international market, as they do not possess either the * In the account of expenditure is included 5 per cent, simple interest, on the total sum, which Hassan Samaih reckons as due to himself, since, apart from the 2,000 rupees which Malcolm put into the concern, he paidl all the expenses, while the remaining partners paid nothing.17 eXprii effeSy ^ COmiection8 ' and would not be in a position to organise the r As n r ' ; Vi *' ' t C 'i agreed ^P on &gt; ^ roust be considered as auite sufficient.

It is true that the ^ompaii} c^unoL P^ 0 t hy momentary rises of price, but as matters stand it is very doubttul whether the company could in any case utilise such momentary rises ; on the ovifci rani i, it is in a position to derive the full benefit from a rise in the average price, ^ can on -y be estimated at intervals of considerable length ; while if, at the end ot ■ e tour years, tae average price is lower than the price stipulated in the agreement, the company regains complete freedom. ' what has been stated above, the conclusion must be that the agreement ' ' f, ! ' ' ,1 . ICa 18 advantageous to the company, and that the disadvantages arising lium a certain limitation of freedom of action are considerably outweighed by the advantages presented by a certainty of selling for several years at adequate prices, xiassan bamaih was acting entirely in the interest of the company when he concluded the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus ; if he had neglected this opportunity doubts as to his business capacity would have been fully justified. The result of the above examination, then, is that, assuming that Sheikh Sakar had a right to decide the matter as a judge—which is disputed—his decision could not possibly be to the effect that the lease agreement should be cancelled. Taking the most liberal view of his powers, he could only deal with the ana pronounce judgment on the question whether Hassan Samaih ought to pay com pensation to the plaintiff partner on account of the conclusion of this agreement. It has been proved, in the first place, that the partners gave their approval to the agreement ; m the second place, that their approval was not necessary, because Hassan Samaih, on the strength of his powers as manager, had authority to conclude the agreement indepen dently, whether such authority was expressly granted him by the Memorandum of Association or whether it is to be considered as having been admitted in practice by his having been allowed to exercise it without dispute for many years. This disposes of the fiiSu ground on which a decision unfavourable to Hassan Bamaih might have been given. It has further been shown that the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus is advantageous to the company, and that by its conclusion the interests of the individual partners have been secured as completely as circumstances admit. It follows that, from this ooint of view also, a decision unfavourable to Hassan Samaih could not be given, especially as evidence is produced showing that the partners approved of the agreement, which approval would preclude them from claiming any compensation, even if the agreement were really disadvantageous. Accordingly Isa's complaint is entirely unfounded, and there was no legal ground f or Sheikh Sakar to give any judicial decision unfavourable to Hassan Samaih. The decision pronounced must therefore be regarded as entirely contrary to justice. 2. Could Sheikh.Sakar cancel the Lease Agr of the administration I he various letters from Sheikh Sakar to Hassan Samaih, in which he pronounces the cancellation of the lease agreement and orders the cessation of the work, as well as certain letters from Abdallatif, show clearly that Sheikh Sakar was induced partly bv political considerations to take steps against the mining company. Looking at the matter from this point of view, the objections which Sakar has to make to the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus are the following : He regards this agreement as a sub-letting of the oxide mines to third parties who are not British subjects, but subiects of a foreign Power, whereas, he argues, according to the terms of the original agreement the partners have to work the mines themselves, and may not lease them to others.' Sakar fears that now that a foreigner is one of the parties interested in the mines, the * See p. 15, and annex 43. [2574 c—l]18 | latter may pass out of his possession, and he may gradually lose the island. Finally, he points out that lie did not give permission for the conclusion of agreements with foreigners, and that the lease agreement does not contain any clause under which the whole output could be delivered to one individual without his (Sakar's) sanction. (Annexes 12, 16, 20, 22 of the first German Memorandum and Annex 39 of this Memorandum), In the first place it is not easy to understand how the agreement of the Ist June, 1906, can be regarded as a letting of the mines to Mr. W onckhaus. The stipulation that the oxide is to be delivered free on board, and the detailed arrangements concerning the quantity to be loaded daily, make it clear that Mr. W onckhaus was not to have anything to do with the working of the mines themselves.* The agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus is a simple contract for delivery, an entirely unobjectionable commercial transaction such as might take place anywhere without giving rise to comment, and which was intended to promote purely commercial interests. Even if this agreement had given to Mr. Wonckhaus for a certain time a positi on in the n ature of a monopo ly as regards the red oxide obtained on Abu Musa, that would not Tiave prevented the 'transaction 'from being a perfectly legitimate one. It is to be observed, however, that a monopoly in the strict sense of the word was not established, since the company was at liberty to sell certain quantities to India. Sakar's fear that the agreement may lea,d not only to the property in the mines being gradually lost to the owner—whether he is Salim or Sakar—-but even to the separation of the Island of Abu Musa from Shargeh, is so senseless that it is really not worth while to discuss it. As regards Sakar's objection to the conclusion of agreements with foreigners, it is to be observed that the lease agreement concluded between Salim and the company contains no provision against the sale of the produce of the mines to foreigners. On the contrary, in view of the freedom of trade recognised in the Persian Gulf, and the absence of an express prohibition in the lease agreement, it may be considered to be taken for granted that the company of lessees is to be at liberty to conclude arrange ments for supplying foreigners also. Moreover, in the Memorandum of Association, with which Sakar had been acquainted for years and which he had approved of, sales to foreigners were expressly provided for, and such sales were as a matter of fact repeatedly concluded, without any objection on Sakar's part. His observation in his letter of the 26th March, 1907 (11 Safer, 1325, Annex 16 of first German Memo randum) : 'We did not tell you to make contracts with strangers from foreign Powers without informing us,' is therefore entirely groundless and misleading. It is also strange that, as appears from the letter just referred to, Sheikh Sakar should wish British subjects to be treated differently from those of other Powers. From the point of view of the Shargeh State a Bri tish subiect i s cert ainly j ust as much a foreigner as is the subject of any cither P ower. Yet ^eikh Sakar has nothing to' say against 'the. company of lessees concluding agreements with British subjects, while agreements with other foreigners are not to be allowed. This is evidently contrary to the principle of the ' open door.' In the view of the Imperial Government the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus neither infringes the terms of Salim's concession, nor is in any way dangerous to the internal peace, external independence, or territorial integrity of Shargeh. It is there fore not apparent how the action of Sakar against the company could be justified by considerations connected with the welfare of the State. The conclusions arrived at above may be summarised as follows :— 1. Sheikh Salim is owner of the Island of Abu Musa, and therefore, according to the commercial law prevailing on the Persian Gulf, had a right to lease the oxide mines there to the mining company, Hassan-ibn-Ali and Co., in his own name. According to the Mohammedan religious lav/ he could not conclude the lease agreement; according to that law, however, the company would have acquired the exclusive right to the produce of the mines simply by the fact of working them. 2. The owner of the island, whoever he may be, has no authority, either according to the lease agreement (which is to be judged by commercial law), or according to religious law, to revoke or terminate the rights of the mining company or to hinder the company in any other way from working the mines. 3. Hassan Samaih had authority, as manager of the mining company, to conclude * The British Memorandum observes that the arrangement between Sheikh Salim and the company was not really a lease agreement, but ' a permit to work these mines.' If even that arrangement ia not to be considered a ' leasehold,' it is incomprehensible how a simple contract for the delivery of an article can be regarded as a ' leasehold.'1\) agreements like that with Mr, Wonckhaus, signing in the name of the company, without consulting the other partners. Such agreements at once become binding on the other partners, in the case under consideration, however, their approval was also signified. ^ ie a § Teem ent with Mr. Wonckhaus is advantageous to the mining company, so that the partners have not been injured by Hassan Samaih's action as narmger. J lie ^ e was therefore no reason for a complaint of the company against Hassan Samam on tae ground of action contrary to agreement or duty. iJ ' 1 here was accordingly no ground for action on the part of Sheikh Sakar against Hassan Samaih lor the protection of the other partners. Moreover, the seat of the company is at Lingah, and the partners of the company are not subjects of the Sheikh of Saargelj, so that he has no jurisdiction in matters concerning the relations of the partners .vith each other. ^ In any case, he could not exercise such jurisdiction himself, but should have had the dispute settled by the judge. 7- agreement between the, mining company and Mr. Wonckhaus, which is nothing but the conclusion of an ordinary and permissible business transaction, and which cannot have any political aims, neither infringes the lease agreement nor is in any way dangerous to the interests of the State of Shargeh, so that the action taken by feheikh Sakar against the company cannot be justified on the ground of the general interests of the administration of the country. 8, Sheikh Sakar's interference is not limited to redressing a wrong alleged to have been done by one partner to the others, or to preventing the carrying out of an agree ment alleged to be contrary to the interests of the country, but simply deprives the whole company of the basis of its existence. Ihe company, in which the German firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Co. have a share, is thereby very seriously injured, since the realisation of its object is made impossible and it is not in a position to carry out current obligations imposed upon it by contract. 9= Sakar 5 s proceedings, then, are clearly a violation of law—an exercise of arbitrary power. The British Memorandum maintains that, as Hassan Samaih had no authority to conclude a contract for the delivery of oxide with Mr. Wonckhaus which would be binding on the company, it is open to Mr. Wonckhaus to claim compensation from Hassan Samaih for non-fulfilment of the contract. There can, however, be no doubt, after what has been stated in the present Memorandum, that the responsibility for carrying out the contract for the supply of oxide rests, not with Hassan Samaih personally, but with the company as a company. The fulfilment of the contract by the company has, however, up till now been prevented by the arbitrary act of Sheikh Sakar, and the lawless state of things brought about by that act. In consequence of the conclusion of this contract by Mr. Wonckhaus, acting in the interests of the firm of R. Wonckhaus and Co. 5 this latter firm at the present time still has a substantial interest in the existence and prosperity of the mining company. When the disputes of the company with Sheikh Sakar placed the firm in a difficult « position, it was only doing what was necessary in the defence of its legitimate interests I when it endeavoured bo acquire a share in the company, and So to exercise a direct | influence on the fortunes of tne latter. There was no reason why the illegal interference | of the sheikh should prevent the firm from acting as it thought fit. The attempt is made in the British Memorandum to show that the firm of Wonckhaus has no locus standi in this dispute, on the ground that it either acquired its share in ignorance of the position of affairs, in which case it must address its claim to the vendor, or else acted with knowledge of the position, and has consequently itself to blame for the injury it has sustained. This line of argument starts from the erroneous assumption that the lease agreement is no longer legally valid. If that were the case, there would doubtless be no foundation for the present complaint. But as the dispute turns upon the., question whether the cancelling of the lease agree ment was legal or illegal, and as the Imperial Government, for the reasons stated in this Memorandum, are convinced of the illegality of the cancelling of the agreement there does not appear to be any reason why the firm of Wonckhaus should be pre vented from putting forward, on the strength of the share acquired by it in the company, its claims in respect of expropriation. The firm seems to be the more justified in doing so from the circumstance that it was evidently the aim of Sheikh Sakar ? s action throughout to render the rights enjoyed by Mr. Wonckhaus under the agreement for the supply of oxide illusory for the benefit of his competitors. Sheikh Sakar compelled by force of arms the cessation of the working of the oxide20 mines. His proceedings are also an infraction of the ' Maritime Truce,'' to the preserva tion of which in those regions His Majesty's Government devote particular attention. His action was supported by Great Britain to the extent that the gun-boat ' Lapwing ' towed to Abu Musa the boats of Sheikh Sakar in which the sheikh's armed men were brought to the island to stop the work by force and prevent the landing of the employes of the firm of Wonckhaus.'® So that not only was Sakar's attack on the rights of the mining company made with the knowledge of the officials of His Majesty's Government, but it was also directly assisted by them. The Imperial Govern ment cannot, therefore, do otherwise than include His Majesty's Government in the responsibility for the consequences of this attack. November 1909. A nnexes.

We beg that you will note this. We hope that you will do your best in the working of the red oxide mines on Abu Musa. Brother Abdallah did well to reduce the numbers of the oxide workers, as the expenses were too high. As regards the price of the oxide which you sent to London, we hope you have obtained the money and devoted it to paying expenses. We hope that the ships sold their red oxide well. Further, we have drawn up the association, and have given it to brother Abdallah sign it and then send us a copy : then all w Abdallah Sheikh Salim of this instrument, the sheikh would like us to give him a copy of it.

We wanted to arrange the matter here, like the lease of the red oxide, but, because people raised doubts in his mind, he said he would only do it after seeing the place. It is to be hoped that they will settle this matter ; through the exertions of brother Abdallah all will go well. We have given Sheikh Salim an advance of 80 reals against his I.O.U., as well as 50 reals, the balance of the shell due ; he refused to start until we had made him an advance.

We pray to Thee, O God, for guidance to arrive at the truth ! ine lease mentioned in the document is null and void. The use of the mine referred to belongs to Alhanj Hassan and the others, for it is one of the open mines which are no one's free property and belong to no one in particular, and anyone who first comes to them takes what he requires out of them, even for purposes of trade. And he {(he sheikh-) has no right to give the mine to others, and the sheikfi may not prevent Alhadj Hassan and his partners from extracting the red oxide referred to and giving it to others ; even the Imam is not at liberty to give open mines to anyone as a fief, for they are common property of the Moslems and others, like water and grass. Whoever first comes to open mines extracts what he requires, and no one may interfere with him until he has got enough.

What is your opinion about the letting of this red oxide mine ? Is the letting of it valid, and does the mine become property in consequence of being worked or not f And if you say that it does not become property, does a man who works it, not knowing that it is a mine, become its owner ? Explain it to us, and you will be rewarded, and may God reward you for us ! Opinion, The answer. O God (allow) justice to prevail and guide to truth.! The red oxide mine referred to belongs to the group of open mines, which do not, by being worked, acquire the character of property to be freely disposed of; no one can validly make such an open mine his private property to the exclusion of others, nor can it be granted to him as a fief by patent from the Sultan ; but it is common property of the Moslems, like drinking places for cattle, grass, and firewood. And there is a consensus of opinion (among jurists) as regards the prohibition of the letting of the mine in question, and the exploitation referred to does not constitute a taking possession ; and, as a corollary of that legal principle, if a person makes use of the mine and works in it and extracts from it the red oxide referred to, he has, in extracting the red oxide, more right to it than any one else, and that (holds good) if he knows that it is a mine ; but if he does not know till after the exploitation that it is a mine, he becomes the owner of it as land and soil and materially, and that according to the consensus of opinion quoted by the Imam Attabari; and it is expressly stated in the Mughni and in the Nihaye that it makes no difference whether it is extracted for trading purposes or for any other object. In these circumstances the aforesaid Alhadj Hassan has precedence in the extraction of the said red o because he came first and up to this moment has not taken his hand off it; but at the moment when he took his hand off the red oxide and took the money for it, come under the power of Alhadj Hassan.

JOHN van ESS, M.A,, Mission. Annex 38. ^In the letter of Abdellatif to Hassan Samaih, of 8, Dulhidje, 1324 (23rd January, 1907), the following passage occurs:-— aiis (JlkxL^! (istibtal hadihi Mmuqaxvale chair min idjabethu). The first word JlkJJ does not appear in the dictionaries but according to the analogy of such formations it can only be translated ; ' the wish (or endeavour) to bring about an annulling ' (the annulling itself would be (tabtil) or JM (ibtal), see, e.g.,^ Hava, Arabic-English Dictionary, Beirut, Catholic Press, 1899, p. 36 : 'jWj Jk- to annul, to cancel [a deed] '). Lhe last word aJuW-l (idjabethu) can on account of the masculine pronoun A m, only refer to one of two preceding words : 1. 'My son Isa,'' or the 'he' in the subordinate clause referring to 'my son Isa ; ' for he apprehends difficulties from the participation of foreigners in this business.' 2. ' The German.' It cannot refer to Isa, because that would have no meaning. So that the in idjabethu can only refer to the German, and that makes sense; for (adjab) (with accusative of the person) signifies : ' to answer someone, to agree with someone, to comply with the wish of someone.' The meaning of the sentence is therefore : ' it better to aim at the annulment of this agreement wishes.' The opinion of the missionary van Ess on the passage agrees with mine in regard to JlkjJJ (istibtal). He does not explain the word &lt; uj M (idjabethu), but alters it to (idjabetha). The view that the wrong pronoun (masculine instead of feminine) is used here, as happens not unfrequently in these documents, and that it is justifiable to substitute the 'right pronoun, is erroneous, for the reason that after the verb (adjab),the accusative, which here appears as an affixed pronoun, can only denote a and not a thing ; but if the word were (idjabetha), the reference would be to a thing, viz., the XJjUu, (muqawale: 'agreement'). The translation 'an assent thereto' is incorrect. Prof. Dr . MARTIN HARTMANN. Hcrmsdorf, near Berlin, November 20, 1909, [257- c—1] L36 Annex 39.

After greeting, &amp;c. : Be plying to your letter, in which were enclosed the papers of the Memorandum of Association for the signature of the partners, and other papers for the information of the partners, regarding the extraction of red oxide and mica (we have to state that) : We have shown the letter to your partners, and their reply is (as follows) t— 1. You fixed the sum of 4,000 rupees as the pr : ce of the four large boats before you consulted them, and it is not clear to them whether the four boats have been employed from the date of the lease of the red oxide mines. 2. The red oxide mines, the rent of which is 250 reals a~year, cannot bear the cost of eight boats at high figures while the amount of oxide extracted is small. 3. It was not necessary to estimate so much for the workmen's accountant and for food, &amp;c., when such things surely do not disappear suddenly from the island. Also it is possible, by (good) arrangement, for the workmen to work for twenty days before the arrival of the ship, and it is possible for them to extract a great deal in that time ; other shippings should not be thought of till afterwards. To extract the red oxide from the ground and then leave it lying in the island is too expensive. It is now evident that shipping to India leads to loss of time. The people ask for samples; if they can get samples they give orders, but not otherwise. It is clear that the work was carried on37 assiduously without the existence of a demand; only the expenses are evident, and God only knows what is the use of it! As regards the ship on which was dispatched the red oxide for the firm of Asfar, on whom you drew the bill, the partners do not know how the business ended; apparently the expenses were not covered. Mines out of which so small a profit is made need not necessarily be worked with such assiduity. The reply oi the partners is therefore : for these red oxide mines four boats are sufficient—two to hold 100 sacks each and two 150. And as the place of shipping is near, each boat can load and unload four times a-day, and the two boats that hold 100 sacks each can load and unload on the (different) sides of the island. Since the revenue from these mines is small they will not bear such heavy expenses. The partners count on getting a profit out of these mines, but if there are endless heavy expenses they cannot get rid of the idea that they are being asked to put their hands in their pockets and pay. In short, your placing eight boats in the service of the red This is the view of your partners ; and greeting ! ABDALLAiTF-IBN-ABDAPiRAHMAN. 9 Ramadan, 1316 {January 21, 1899).

(Translation.) i oar Fxeellency, _ 4, 1909. UN DEE, instructions from my Government, I have the honour to transmit herewith six. copies of ^ a second memorandum drawn up by the German Government on the subject ot the Abu Musa incident, in reply to the Memorandum of the British Government. Tne Memorandum sets forth the general and legal position as established by facts an d proofs. It comes to the conclusion that the action of the Sheikh of Shargeb against the mining company, Hassan-ibn-Ali and Co., was illegal, that in its ultimate aim it was directed against tne contract between Ilerr Robert Wonckhaus and the mining company, and that tne forcible measures taken by the sheikh were directly promoted by the agents ('' Organ en') of the British Government. According to the ordinary principles of la w, therefore, the British Government and the sheikh are jointly responsible . for the consequences of these actions. On the one hand, Herr Robert Wonckhaus should be compensated for the damage which he sustained through the non-fulfilment of the contract consequent upon the infringement of the rights of the mining company by the sheikh, supported by the agents of the British Government. On the other hand, the firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Co. should be compensated, as a participant in the mining company, for their share of the damage sustained by the mining company through the suspension of operations. A detailed calculation of the damage is reserved. In order to obviate an increase of the damage and to put an end to the existing disturbance to property, the mining company should be permitted with the greatest promptitude to continue their mining operations. Having regard to the present position of affairs, the German Government believe that they should first of all only apply to the British Government to take steps for the removal of the disturbance to property and for the granting of compensation for damage sustained. If, contrary to expectation, the British Government should not admit the grounds on which the attitude of the German Government is based, as set forth in the Memo randum, and should adhere to the negative view which they have hitherto adopted, the German Government are of opinion that the point at issue should be referred to the Permanent Tribunal at The Hague. I have, &amp;c. P. METTERNICH. Enclosure in No. 1. Second Memorandum by the German Governme November 1909. IN consequence of what is stated in the Memorandum of His Majesty's Govern ment of the 10th July, 1908, the Imperial German Government have again examined the complaint of the German firm, Robert Wonckhaus and Co., of Lingah, in regard to the occurrences on the island of Abu Musa. In this examination they have given every consideration to the arguments used in the Memorandum, and to the documents communicated to them. From a comparison of the British Memorandum wi th the first German Memorandum (of De cember 19 0 7), it appears that the following facts are not disputed Till the spring of 1883 Sheikh Salim-ibn-Sultan-ibn-Sakar Alkasimi (referred to below for short as Sheikh Salim or Salim), was reigning Sheikh of Shargeh to th' territory of which the island of Abu Musa belongs. ' During the time that he was in [2574 c-1] ftthe Island of Abu Musa, in which he always took a particular interest, ana 5 ^ had built himself a dwelling-house and had established date plantations, he was cie]x?se^ by his nephew, the present reigning Sheikh Sakar-ibn-Khalid (called below ioi Sheikh Sakar or Sakar). Sheikh Sakar at that time intended to drive Sheikh balim out of Abu Musa by force, but was prevented from doing so by the British resi ent in the Persian Gulf Nevertheless Salim left Abu Musa and went to Lmgan, uii ai, m July 1883 an agreement v, r as made between the two sheikhs, a.ccording to ^w^iic Sheikh Sakar was to pay to Sheikh Salim an annual pension of 600 dollars. ^ { here upon Salim returned to Abu Musa. In 1884, however, differences again arose between the two in consequence of political intrigues of Salim against Sakar, and Sakar severa times complained to the British resident in letters. As Salim was in financial straits he was obliged to give in, and a second agreement was arrived at. Under this agreement Sakar, for whose means the pension of 600 dollars previously settled was too igh, giari^ od his uncle a pension of 400 dollars annually, half to be paid in money and naA m kind. The revenue from the Island of Sir Abu Nuair, said to amount to ^00 doilais, was also assigned to Salim. After this the relations of the two sheikhs remairjed peaceful until the spring of 1889, when, as is alleged, Salim was making prepara tions for an attack on Shargeh. The British agent at Shargeh, however, succeeded in reconciling the two sheikhs, and persuaded them to conclude a new agieement (6th April, 1889). By this Sakar undertook to continue the payment of the pension of 400 dollars, allowed Salim to live at Shargeh within certain bounds, and promised to treat him in other respects also in accordance with his rank. The Island of Sir, which produced no revenue, was not mentioned in this agreement. Salim undertook to keep the peace and to obey his nephew. The two sheikhs afterwards lived on good terms, so that Sheikh Salar, when absent from his capital, entrusted the government to his uncle. (Annexes Nos. 2 to 6 of the British Memorandum.) By a document dated the 10th April, 1898 (18 Dulkade, 1315), Sheikh Salim leased the red oxide mines on the Island of Abu Musa for an annual rent of 250 t rench reals, to the British subjects, Alhaj Hassan-ibn-Ali Samaih^ (called below Hassan Samaih, for short), his son Abdallah-ibn-Hassan (Abdallah, for short), and ^ Isa-ibn- Abdallatif (Isa, for short), son of the British consular agent at Shargeh, Abdallatif-ibn- Abdarrahman, who represented his son in all business of the company ol lessees. At that time Sheikh Salim was Regent of Shargeh, as Sheika Sakar was absent on a pilgrimage to Mecca. The rent was paid regularly, and received by Sheikh Salim On the 19th August, 1898 (l Rebi-el-Tani, 1316), Sheikh Sakar was received into the company of lessees as a shareholder on an equal footing w 7 ith the others. He, however, on the 29th January, 1899, (17 Ramadan, 1316), made his share over to one Yussuf-bin-Abdallah, who transferred it to Hassan Samaih, This share was, on the 10th October, 1907, sold by Hassan Samaih to Thomas Brown, a British subject, from whom it was purchased by the firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Co., of Lingah, on the 16th October, 1907. (Annexes 3 to 4 E of the first German Memorandum.) Previously to this, on the ls£ June, 1906, a contract (Annex 5 of the first German \ ' ' ' Memorandum and Annex 10 of the British Memorandum) had been concluded between ' Hassan Samaih and the German merchant Robert Wonckhaus, a partner in the firm of Wonckhaus and Co., under which from 2,000 to 5,000 tons of red oxide were to be delivered to Wonckhaus annually for four years from the mines on Abu Musa. The icompany had also contracted with another party to deliver 400 tons a-year for five years to India. (Annex 19 of the first German Memorandum.) 4- On the 21st February, 1907 (9th Moharrem, 1325), Sheikh Sakar addressed a letter (Annex 12 of the first German Memorandum) to Hassan Samaih, in which he demanded that the wOTking of the red oxide mines on Abu Musa should cease. The . ostensible i •' 'T' ground for this step is a complaint made by Isa to the sheikh that the contract for •jr- delivery of red oxide had been made with Wonckhaus without his sanction. There upon a somewhat lengthy correspondence ensued between Hassan Samaih on the one side and Sheikh Sakar, Sheikh Salim, and the British consular authorities on the other (Annexes 13 to 16, 18 to 20 of the first German Memorandum) until Sheikh Sakar, in two letters of the 3rd October, 1907 (25 Shaban, 1325), one of which was to be handed to Bassan Samaih, and his receipt obtained, in the presence of the British consular agent at Lingah, again ordered that the work should cease. (Annexes 21 and 22 of the first German Memorandum.) Thereupon, about the 20th October, 1907, Sheikh Sakar sent armed men to the island, who compelled the miners to leave and forcibly prevented further work at the mines. * Annexes 1 to 5.The boats containing the sheikh's armed force were towed to Abu Musa by the British war-ship ' Lapwing,' on board which was Lieutenant C. H. Gabriel British Tice -consul at Bunder Abbas. About mid-day on the 23rd October (a few hours after the departure of the British war-ship) two employes of the firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Co , who had approached the island in order to land on it, were received with bullets by the sheikh's armed men, and forced to turn back. ^ Ihe facts being as stated above, there is a difference of opinion as to whether Sheikh^ Sakar was justified in acting as he did. Whereas the British Memorandum maintains that there was nothing illegal in Sheikh Sakar's proceedings, the Imperial Vrovernment are still of opinion that he had no legal right, either bv private or by public law, to cancel of his own motion the lease agreement concluded by Sheikh Salim, and that the forcible execution of his decision must undoubtedly be regarded as an illegal act. (A).—Position of Sheikh Sakar with respect to the Company of Lessees, from the point of tiew of private L a w. It is stated in the British Memorandum that the Island of Abu Musa is the property of Sheikh Sakar, and that it was only as the representative of Sakar and while he acted as regent during the latter's pilgrimage, that Sheikh Salim concluded the lease agreement; that the island is an integral part of the dominions of the Sheikh of Shargeh, who in recent years has regularly sent his cattle to graze on the island; and that Sheikh Sakar, who after the deposition of Salim made the latter an allowance, had, solely in consequence of oral and personal arrangements, increased this allowance by the revenue of Abu Musa, including that derived from the red oxide mines. In proof of this the British Memorandum first cites a letter from Salim to Sakar of the 21st February, 1908 (Annex 1 of British Memorandum), in which Salim declares that he has no claim to the island and has never put forward any claim to it, and then a kind of Memorandum of Sheikh Sakar, dated the 22nd February, 1898* (Annex 5 of British Memorandum), in which he gives an account of his relations with Salim and his arrangements with him in regard to property. Further, there are cited two letters from Sakar to the British resident in the Persian Gulf, dated the 2let January and 14th February, 1884 (Annexes 8, 4 of the British Memorandum), in which Sakar describes Abu Musa as ' our island and a dependency of Shargah,' as well as the agreement between the two sheikhs, of the 6th April, 1889) (Annex 2 of the British Memorandum). Finally, reference is made to a Memorandum of Major P. Z. Cox, British resident in the Persian Gulf, dated the 28th February, 1.908, on'the history of Abu Musa (Annex 6 of the British Memorandum), and to a letter from Sakar to the British resident. Lieutenant-Colonel Eemball, dated the 11th October, 1902 (Annex of British Memorandum), which is held to show that in concluding the lease agreement, Salim was acting in his capacity of regent. Before these arguments are examined, attention must be called to an inaccuracy in the text of the British Memorandum. It is there stated that Sakar granted to Salim the revenue of the island, including that derived from the mines, Sakar in his own account only speaks of having assigned to Salim the amount of the rent of the oxide mines, in consequence of his complaint that his income was insufficient. As regards the evidence produced, the Imperial Government regret that they are unable to accept as unobjectionable testimony the letter of Sheikh Salim to Sheikh Sakar, dated the 21st February, 1908, to which the first place is assigned in the British Memorandum. This letter and Sakar's Memorandum of the 22nd February, 1908, which must be regarded simply as the version of an interested party and valueless as evidence, were written at a time when efforts were being made to collect proofs of the . legality of the steps taken by Sakar against the company of lessees. The Imperial Government have information that Major Cox was at Shargeh just at that time. The contents of both documents are so much out of harmony with the former attitude of the two sheikhs and with facts which will be mentioned further on, that one can only conclude that the sheikhs at the later period gave a different account of the proprietary rights on Abu Musa. Sakar's letters to the British resident in 1884 (Annexes 3, 4 of the British Memorandum) are no evidence of Sakar's ownership of the island. In order to under stand them fully, one must remember that they were written at a time when Salim was living at Abu Musa after being deposed by Sakar, when the two sheikhs were enemies and when Sakar still had to fear resistance on the part of the former ruler, and perhaps * Sic [? 1908].4 even the seizure and retention of part of his dominions by him. But ...akar, having undertaken the government of Shargeh, was responsible for the preservation o P e ^ ce in accordance with the Maritime Truce, as is explained^ in the Memoranaum by Major Cox referred to above. He therefore begged the British resident to warn oaiim to keep quiet, and in order to justify his request laid stress on the fact that Auu Musa was politically a dependency of Shargeh. The sole object of the letters therefore was to put an end to the political conflict between the two sheikhs. Tnis view supported by the lollowing minute (printed in Annex 6 ot the British Memorandum), which appears with Sakar's second letter, in the archives of the British resident . ' Sheikh Sagar seems to insist that if Salim continues to live on Bu Musa he should give a guarantee through the resident that he will not do anything to disturb him, Sheikh Sagar, or the maritime peace.' So that when we find in the one letter the words: ' Abu Musa is an isiand dependent on Shargah, and we cannot spare it to others, and. in the otnei the wok I s . ' Bu Musa is our island and a dependency of Shargah, this can only refer, accorcdng to the whole context, to the circumstance ^ that the island belongs^ politically the territory of Shargah. Consistently with this, Salim himself, as mentioned beiow (p. 6^1, describes Abu Musa in several letters and documents as 'my' or 'our' island (meaning, that is, that he is the private owner), and as a dependency of Shargah. If Sheikh Sakar goes on to write : ' I cannot dispense with the Island of Bu Musa, as it is of great use to me,' this can only be taken, in view 01 the context just leteired to, in a political sense and not in the sense of private ownership. In the British Memorandum these letters are made use of to support the assertion that Salim's presence on Abu Musa was only ' tolerated. The contention is evidently that Salim had no right whatever to live on Abu Musa, and that if he did live there, it was really only owing to the kindness of Sakar. But it appears fiom what has been said above that this 'toleration' is to be understood entirely in a political sense and has nothing to do with the question of private ownership. No doubt Sheikh Sakar was at liberty to banish his political opponent from the country and also to prevent him from residing on his private estate. If Sakar dio not do this, uhat is no reason for concluding that Salim had no right, from the point of view Oi piivate aw, to reside at Abu Musa. Salim's right to live at Abu Musa on the strength of his owning private property there, and Sakar's decision to tolerate his presence there, in spite of political hostility, are such very different things that conclusions cannot possiblv be drawn from one to the other. _ Those letters, then, have nothing to do with the question of private ownership. In any case, they cannot be cited to disprove the private ownership 01 Salim. If, however, they are to be considered as having a bearing on this question, they would seem rather to point to the conclusion that Sakar regarded Abu Musa as a domain of Salim, from which he would have to drive him if Salim was guilty of political misconduct by interfering in Sakar s affairs or disturbing the peace. ( if Salim wants to live in it and guarantees that he will not commit anything which would interfere with my affairs oi' disturb the maritime peace, it matters not . . . .') The letter, too, which Sakar addressed to Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball on the 11th October, 1902 (Annex 7of the British Memorandum), seems, on closer examination, to have a very different meaning from that assigned to it in the British Memorandum. In order to. understand the letter, it would be interesting to know the purport of Kemball's inquiry, to which Sakar's letter was an answer and which is not printed-in the Memorandum. Other known facts, however, make it possible to form an idea of what led to the letter being written and enable one to arrive at a proper appreciation of its contents. On p. 9 of the 'Administration Eeport on the Persian Gulf Residency and Muscat Political Agency for 1898-9,' the following passage occurs 'It is reported that the uncle of the Sheikh of Shargah has given a long lease of some oxide mines to Haji Ali Dubash, also known as Nakhoda Ali, who is a resident of Bushire, where he got into trouble and had to leave. He is said to have already exported 400 tons of oxide, and a further enquiry into the concession will be made when an opportunity offers.' It is not stated where these mines are situated, but, in any case, Lieutenant- Colonel Kemball certainly seems to have considered the sheikh's uncle, Salim, as the owner of the mines in question, as otherwise the above passage, which says nothing about a regency or representation, would have left open the question how Salim came to give the lease. It is to be presumed that later on the resident, carrying out hisintention oi making iiirtlier enquiries, asked Sakar for information about this lease, of ■wiiicb bo iar on t y rumours had reached^ him. Sakar then replied, on the 11th October, no agreement had been made between him and Nakhoda Ali about the Island oi bii ? witn which the present investigation is not concerned. He continues — . 1 ith regaxd to Abu Musa, my uncle, Sheikh Saiim-bin-SuItan cultivates in that isiaad, and m t je year in which I went on the Hajj my aforesaid uncle was acting as my regent m Snargah and he saw fit to lease the mines of Abu Musa to Hassan-bin- Samayieh, a British subject, and Abdallah-bin-Hassan and Esa-bin-Abdul Latif, and the lease has remained up to now.' it cannot be inferred from this letter that Salim was acting only as regent. On the contrary, the words, - With regard to Abu Musa, my uncle . T . . cultivates in that ^ ontail [ a recognition that Sakar has really nothing to do with the cultivation o Abu Musa, but that bahm cultivates it, and presumably has a right to do so.* , a j' 1 s r eg en cy is mentioned, firstly, in order to fix the time, and, secondly, with a ^ 0 .' row Salim the political responsibility as well for the lease in question ; xor the inquiries of the British resident were evidently inconvenient to Sakar. This is not surprising when it is realised that the sheikh evidently has a wrong conception ot the scope of a treaty concluded with the British Indian Government on the 7th —' k , ivaxci,. Vv uen asked by the dragoman of the Imperial vice-consulate at Bushire on the 28th November, 1907, 'What harm is there in having made a contract L C / with the German firm?' Sheikh Sakar replied, 'We have made treaties with the ^' h JingliSii which prevent us from leasing any part of our territory to foreigners other A to an British subjects.^ Ihis interpretation is evidently erroneous, as it gives to the -f treaty a meaning which would be incompatible with the principle of the open door. ... ? ^ xiiis conception of the treaty explains why Sakar, when Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball asked him about leases of land in which a foreigner—the Persian, Nakhoda Ali—was concerned, hastened to assure him that he had had no dealings with Nakhoda Ali, and to explain that his uncle during his regency, and not he, had concluded a lease agree ment, and that only with British subjects, so that, if the lease had been a violation of the leaty cu 18 J 2, the political responsibility would have fallen primarily on Salim and not on Sakar. J The letter to Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball—which is, moreover, the only document proauced m this connection -supplies no evidence that Salim was actinsr simply as regent when he concluded the lease agreement. On the other hand it is an important indication ot the manner in which Sakar at that time regarded the position of Salim with respect to Abu Musa. b iii thei, L Sakar now asserts (Annex 5 of British Memorandum) that he volun- tarily assigned the rent of 250 French reals to Salim, in order to raise his income to the amount previously promised or to a little over that amount, that is an state ment for winch there is no proof, and which is inconsistent with facts that will be considered below (pp. 6 et seq.). The circumstance that Sakar used to send his cattle to pasture on Abu Musa wouid not be inconsistent with Salim's ownership of the island, for, as maybe gathered from Major Cox's account (Annex 6 of British Memorandum), this may very well be a privilege oi the reigning Sheikh of Shargeh, a kind of servitude to which the private property m the island is subject. In this connection mention may be made of another circumstance which has an important bearing on the question of the ownership of Abu Musa. As stated above the arrangement of 1889 was preceded by other agreements respecting the pecuniary compensation to Salim, and in order to increase his pension, which had been reduced to 400 dollars, the revenue of the Island of Sir Abu Nuair, estimated at 200 dollars, was assigned to him. Now if the revenue of an island was to be given to Salim would it not have been natural to give him that of the Island of Abu Musa, which he could have checked, and, if necessary, collected himself, since he resided in the island ? Of course if Abu Musa was already Salim's property this expedient could not be adopted. ^ ectioTls Raised in the British Memorandum to Salim's ownership of the xsland of Abu Musa having thus been refuted, and attention having been called to certain points which indirectly support the contention that he was the owner, reference will the sentence 'the lease has remained up to now' is also important in another connection It fan Afln Tha t thA l^nco liac J rrn * .. - .... . i r. .. . xu British Memorandum.) ~ ' acquiesced in it.

The question of the sum to be paid to Salim or tne proportion of the cargo to be kept by him afterwards formed the subject of long negotiations with Salim, which Hassan Samaih and his son Abdallah conducted on behalf of Abdallah Muhammed. Sheikh Salim concluded two lease agreements respecting the oxide mines ; the first on the 6th April, .1898 (14 Dulkade, 1315)4 the second on the 10th Apri^ 1898 WiiM ; (ig Dulkade, 1315).§ The fi rst was expressly cancelled, b y the second . Neither « s-n.-t,- „• contains any reference to the regency or representation. On the other hand, the first agreement contains the passage : ' So long as I, my children, and my brothers live no one shall have a right to raise objections to it the lease).' This clearly expresses that Salim regarded himself as the owner, since he speaks of himself and his heirs, which would be impossible if he had only been acting as the representative of Sakar. If the lease agreement had been concluded in Sakar's name, Salim could not have declared that no one (including, therefore, Sakar) was to have a right to raise objections, and, moreover, there would have been no sense in mentioning Salim's heirs in the agreement. In the second agreement Salim further secured for himself an annual payment of 100 French reals for the trade in mother-of-pearl and canary seed. Salim has always levied this sum from the lessees as well as the rent. In the document of the 19th August, 1898 ( 1 Rebi-ul-Tani, 1315; Annex 3 of first German Memorandum), in. which Sheikh Sakar announces his entry into the mining company, pay a proportional part of the mother-of-pearl This is absolutely inconsistent with Sakar's assertion that he had granted to Salim and at the same time shows that Salim had a right to the enjoyment in his own name of all Sources of profit to be derived from Abu Musa, and that he could exercise this right even as against the reigning sheikh. Another circumstance of particular importance in connection with the question as to which of the two sheikhs is the owner of Abu Musa is, that on the 26th December, 1898 (12 Shaban, 1316),|| that is long after Sakar had returned and Salim's regency had come to an end, Salim leased to Hassan Samaih. Abdallah, and Isa all the deposits of mica on Abu Musa. The lease is for a term of five years, and a total sum of 1,500 French reals is to be paid for it. In the document Salim expressly speaks of 1 'our Island of Abu Musa.'lf The price of the lease was paid to Salim by bill. On the 6th January, 1899 (23 Shaban, 1316),' ::H ' Abdallatif sends to Hassan Samaih the draft of a Memorandum of Association respecting the working of both the oxide and the mica mines, ft In sending it he observes that Sakar has seen the Memorandum, and wishes to have a copy of it.JJ ■ Sakar, therefore, knew the terms of the agreement about the mica mines, and knew that the rent was paid to Salim, but he had no objection to make to the arrangement. If Salim has no right of any kind to the island, and if Sakar allows him to have the revenue from the oxide concession simply out of liberality, how is it that Salim of his own authority lets the mica deposits and takes the rent before Sakar's very eyes, and without protest on his part? This rent of 1,500 French reals was a very con siderable sum to the Sheikhs Salim and Sakar, who are by no means rich.

Abdallatif and Hassan Samaih were at that time negotiating wit i balnn botti in regard to this concession and also in regard to another concession for the exploitation of the salt and copper on the Island of Sir Abu Nuair. Abdallatif writes that a dispute has arisen between Salim and Sakar in regard to Sir. He says that Sakar proposes to conclude the lease agreement in his own name, and only allow Sahm a share of the profits, an arrangement which does not satisfy Salim. So that bct.im must nave some reason for considering that Sir also belongs to him. In any case the question is not settled, and the cautious Abdallatif, who has an accurate knowledge of oht- circumstances, postpones the matter until the two sheikhs shall have settled the point between chem. While Abdallatif is unwilling to conclude an arrangement about Sir because Sakar raises a claim to the island and Salim's right to it is disputed (the Sir concession was never granted), he has no hesitation in concluding an agreement with Salim about Abu Musa. Surely he would not have done this if he had had the slightest doubt of Salim s title, more especially as there was already a dispute respecting Sir. Moreover, Sakar, who, as shown above, was aware of the terms of the mica concession, would certainly have tried in this case, as in that of Sir, to make good bis real or alleged rights, especially as a sum of 1,500 reals, a not inconsiderable amount for him, was involved. If he did not do so, that is evidence that he had no doubt himself that Salim was the owner of the island. The facts given above are clear evidence that the Island of Abu Musa is the private property of Sheikh Salim. This conclusion is supported by the opinion prevailing among the most respectable natives on the point in question. Ihe merchant, Abdalmuhsin-ibn-Ahmed Almushari, who has had an intimate acquaintance with the affairs of the Pirate Coast for many years ; the merchant, French / consular agent, Abdarrahman-ibn-Muhammed-ibn-Kazim, who has permanent trade • connections with Shargeh ; as well as Hamd-ibn-Khalifa Al'uyuni, merchant and agent of the Sultan of Muscat all three residents of Lingah—have declared m writing that to their certain knowledge Abu Musa has always been, and still is, the free property of Salim. f The two last-mentioned have also assured the Imperial vice-consufat Bushire orally that everyone who has any knowledge of affairs on the Arabian Coast knows this as well as they do. But even if it be possible to doubt Salim's right to Abu Musa as its formal owner according to European legal principles, it cannot be questioned that he exercised, with the consent of the reigning sheikh, and even as against him, the full right of disposal of the usufruct, just like an owner. The English view, indeed, is that Sakar is the owner of the oxide mines, and that Salim concluded the lease agreement respectuig them as his representative onlv. But even in that case Sakar had no right, from the point of view of private law, to terminate the agreement of his own motion. The lease agreement of the 10th April, 1898, states expressly that the lease shall run for so long as the lessees 'have an interest in the aforesaid mines.' So that the lessees only are to have the right to terminate, and not the lessor. It will be seen that this was the intention of the parties if the first lease agreement, dated the 6th April, 1898, is referred to for comparison. In this agreement, which was concluded only with Hassan Samaih and his son Abdallah, the right of working the mines is given to the lessees for so long as they find oxide, but for not longer than twenty years, with the proviso that they can terminate the agreement at any time on paying one year's rent. Here already a long term was agreed upon for the benefit of the lessees. Thereupon Abdallatif's son Isa was received as a partner, and the new * Annex 15. | Annexes 16 to 18.8 lease agreement of the 10th April, 1.898, was drafted by Abdallatif. ihe oxide business was at that time considered very profitable. The lessees, and especially Abdadatif, therefore wished to secure it for as long as possible. Accordingly the stipulation of a definite term of years was omitted in the second agreement. And in order to exclude any possible doubt as to the bearing of the two agreements upon each other, it was expressly laid down in the second agreement that any agreements previously concmded were to be considered null and void and that the second agreement alone was to be binding. Apart from the fact that it is the universal practice in that region, and a common practice in other parts of the world, to insert such a clause in agreements of this kind, the clause in this case serves the practical purpose of invalidating, verbis, the provisions of the former agreement. But the lessees would certainly not have consented to an alteration of the first agreement if their rights had thereby been diminished. The history of the origin of the final lease agreement accordingly shows clearly that it was the intention of the parties that the l lessees should be at liberty to terminate the agreem This intention has been expressed in the agreement in a manner that cannot be misunderstood. How, in spite of the clear wording of the two agreements, it can be said that there is no real lease agreement, but only 'a mere permit to the partners terminable on either side at any time,' is as difficult to understand as the attempt to draw from the right of the lessees to terminate the agreement and from the clause cancelling previous agree ments the conclusion that the lessor had also reserved to himself the right to terminate the contract. These conclusions are certainly not supported by the documents bearing on the matter. It appears from one of Sakar's letters to Hassan Samaih (Annex 12 of the first German Memorandum) that one of the considerations which chiefly induced Sakar to take steps against the company of lessees was the idea that he would suffer loss in consequence of the agreement of the lessees with Wonckhaus. In connection with the other pretexts brought forward by Sakar in his various letters to Hassan Samaih, it may be conjectured that here, too, we have to deal with an apprehension on the part of Sakar which belongs rather to the realm of politics, and which will be discussed later (pp. 17, 18), namely, that the agreement with Wouckhaus might tend to bring about the gradual separation of the Island of Abu Musa from the dominions of the sheikh. The British Memorandum gives a different explanation of this matter, and states in justification of Sakar's attitude that, in view of the rise of the price of oxide in the market, his pecuniary interest in the mines was not properly safeguarded by the rent of 250 reals fixed for an indefinite time. In other words, Sakar cannot recognise the lease agree ment any longer if the other party makes large profits in consequence of the rise of market prices, while he (as lessor) has to be contented with the rent; the lessor is therefore bound by the agreement only so long as the lessee does not make considerably more than the amount of the rent. It may be that Sheikh Sakar's ideas of the limits of legality and violence are somewhat undeveloped, and that he considers himself bound by agreements only so long as he profits more by them than the other contracting party. If, however, he were allowed to put such ideas into practice it would involve the admission that Europeans or the proteges of European Powers have no rights whatever in the territory of an Arabian sheikh, and that it is permissible for the latter to act as he pleases without regard for good faith or legality. During the long years when the company was working at a loss he did nothing. Now, when there is a prospect of more profitable business for the future, he discovers that the rent is not sufficient. If Sakar wished to participate in the gains of the company, he ought to have retained his share in the company and borne a proportional part of its losses. Surely the object of the agreement between Wonckhaus and the company of lessees is, on the one hand, to make the purchaser of the oxide independent of the fluctuations of the market and insure his obtaining a certain quantity at a fixed price, and, on the other hand, to enable the working company to count with certainty upon selling a definite quantity and obtaining a certain income. Supposing that the market value of oxide fell below the price agreed upon between Wonckhaus and the company of lessees, this would, according to Sheikh Sakar's ideas of justice, give the German firm the right to declare : ' As in these circumstances the mining company is earning money while we are losing, we consider the agreement as no longer valid.' From the legal point of view, the question whether, assuming that Sakar is the lessor, he is able to terminate the lease agreement because the lessee has begun to earn money and the rent does not appear sufficient to him, Sakar, is one that cannot bediscussed seriously.^ The point has been examined here only in order to show the weakness of the position taken up by Sakar. On the question of the termination of the lease agreement opinions* have been obtained from the leading merchantsf at Lingah and Bussorah^ and from the most important clergyt at Lingah, Shargeh, and Debai 3 § who have given their views on the matter from the point of view of commercial law and from that of religious law. The reference was made in the form usual in that region, the agreement in question being submitted to them in copy, together with certain questions in writing, and their opinions being given without a detailed statement of the legal grounds on which they were based. || All the opinions come practically to the same conclusion. The legal construction of the case is, however, not the same in commercial law as in religious law. According to ^commercial law, the lease agreement is valid; the lessor cannot terminate it so long- as the lessees ' wish to keep ' the object leased in accordance with the agreement. 1 tie agreement could only be terminated by amicable arrangement, since the lessor was not forced to sign it, but did so of his own free will. According to religious law the lease agreement is invalid, because a consideration was stipulated for the use of the mines, while oxide and similar minerals lying on the surface are the common property of all Mohammedans, and the lessor has accordingly conferred a right which he did not possess. But any person who discovers or works the mines thereby acquires the right to exploit them, and is at liberty to dispose of the produce as he chooses. Sheikh Salim or Sheikh Sakar, whichever of them is to be considered the lessor, has no claim to the rent, and Hassan Samaih or the company of lessees has, by working the mines, acquired a right to them. The liuler of the territory cannot dispose of the mines, and he cannot prevent the person who has acquired them by working them from exercising his right. So that both the commercial law and the religious law forbid the lessor to terminate the agreement, the latter absolutely, and the former on the assumption that the lessee acts in accordance with the terms of the agreement. This has been done. The rent has been paid regularly. The sale to foreigners is not a breach of the agreement, since it is not forbidden by the agreement ; indeed, it is expressly contemplated in the Memorandum of Association (pp. 14, 15), which will be mentioned further on, with the consent of Sakar as at that time a shareholder. Accordingly, neither Sakar nor Salim has a right to terminate the agreement. (B.) — T he P osition of S heikh S akar with respect to the Company of from the point of view of public law. As observed in the British Memorandum, the reigning Sheikh of Shargeh is the absolute ruler of his country. The final appeal is accordingly to him in all matters concerning the political administration of his country. The British Memorandum further remarks that the principal object of Sakar was to administer justice as between the partners of the company on the strength of his ' sovereign rights of jurisdiction.' In connection with this point, the question must be considered as to whether Sakar had authority to decide as judge the dispute between the partners of the mining company, and whether the decision arrived at was justified by law, or whether he had power to cancel the lease at his discretion in the interest of the administration of the country. * Annexes 19 to 24, t Some of the Lingah merchants come from the Oman coast, have branches or agents there and have for many years been doing a very active trade with the places on the Oman coast; they have therefore an accurate knowledge of the mercantile customary law there. Among the opinions is that of Abdallah Muhammed Hassan Alkhadja, a man who, on account of his experience and reputation, is a recognized arbitrator in commercial matters, whose opinion is asked for by Persians and Arabians of the Persian and Arabian coasts as far as Bahrein, and to whose decisions thev willingly submit. J Among the religious opinions are those of Muhammed Mahdi-ibn-Abdallah and Yussuf-ibn-Muhamm Arl ibn-Abdallah, judges at Lingah. cunmea- § Annexes 25 to 31 s || To the clergy at Shargeh and Debai was submitted a fictitious agreement, the contents of which were in harmony with the agreement of April 10, 1898, in which only the names of persons and places were changed, and dates were spoken of instead of mother-of-pearl, and ' mines ' mentioned instead' of u oxide mines/' In obtaining opinions it is usual in the Persian Gulf to submit fictitious agreements whenever it is desired to conceal the names of persons and things, and so obviate the possibility of the referee being influenced. • ^ ^ [2574 c—1] D10 1, Could Sheikh Sakar cancel th Sheikh Sakar bases his letter of the 22nd February, 1907 _ (9 Moharrem, 1325) (Annex 12 of the first German Memorandum), in which he informs Hassan Samaih of the cancellation of the lease agreement, on a complaint made to him by Isa of the conclusion of the agreement with Wonckhaus, of which Isa did not approve and about which he stated he had not been consulted. In consequence of the representa tions made by Hassan Samaih, Isa's complaint is again referred to in the second decision, dated' the 26th March, 1907 (11 Safar, 1325)' (Annex 16 of the first German Memorandum). .&gt; &lt; Sheikh Sakar himself very wisely does not anywhere state that he wished to play 4-. , . . the part of a judge, for according to Mohammedan public law it is impossible for the , Sovereign to assume the functions of a judge. A judgment can only be given by a . judge appointed by the Sovereign, But the following further objection may be taken to the view adopted in the British Memorandum : if Sakar is the owner and Jessor of the mines, as maintained in the British Memorandum, that circumstance alone is sufficient to preclude him from being a judge in this matter. It is, moreover, surprising that the British Government, as must be inferred from the Memorandum, should admit the jurisdiction of a sheikh on the Pirate Coast over British subjects, and that, too, in a case where the defendant Hassan Samaih resides, not in Shargeh, but at Lingah, in Persian territory, and therefore in the judicial district of the British consulate-general at BUshire, ? 'while the company itself has its head-quarters ancl domicil for judicial purposes at Lingah. so that the principle, acter which is generally so strictly followed in the East, would appear to have been dropped in this case. But assuming that Sheikh Sakar had taken upon himself to act as judge in his own case, in spite of such a course being contrary to the principles of Mohammedan public law, it still remains to consider the further question whether his decision, cancelling of the lease agreement and withdrawal of the mines, was in itself legally admissible. Tsa complains that Hassan Samaih has concluded the agreement with Wonckhaus and in doing so has exceeded his power, and he is afraid that his interests in the company will be injured by this agreement. It would have been the duty of the judge to consider whether in concluding this agreement Hassan Samaih did really exceed his powers, or whether, if he had authority to conclude the agreement, its conclusion had, nevertheless, injured the other shareholders. If the judge found for the plaintiff, the judgment could only be either to the effect that the agreement had been concluded by .an unauthorised person and was, therefore, not binding on the company—in which case the question of the amount of compensation to be paid to Mr. Wonckhaus would have had to be settled between the latter and Hassan Samaih—or to the effect that, although the agreement had been properly concluded and the company were bound to carry out its stipulations, Hassan Samaih was liable to make good to the other shareholders the damage thereby entailed on them. It may be admitted that a construction of the case in question accordino- to the rules of European logic cannot be expected as a matter of course from an \rabiau sheikh, and that is why—apart from other considerations—such a sheikh is not usually allowed to pronounce a judgment where the subjects of a European State are con cerned. But what one is justified in expecting is that the judgment even of an Arabian sheikh shall not violate natural justice as it has been violated in the present case. The dispute between the shareholders is not about the mines themselves, but entirely about a question, of the administration of the company, the question, namely, whether a certain individual partner had authority to perform a certain legal act and whether this legal act was in the interest of the whole bodv or not. And what does the judge do ? He, who is being appealed to by one party to protect its rights which are believed to be threatened, and who ought to guard the interests of both plaintiff and defendant, doing justice between them impartially does violence not only to both parties but also to the remaining shareholders who are outside the dispute, simply taking away from the company and putting in his own pocket the whole valuable object in connection with which the company was founded and in which he alleges that he has himself a financial interest which is not beino- duly satisfied. That was an arbitrary act of the worst kind. 13 If, nevertheless, the British Memorandum says: ' In no sense of the word does the conduct of the sheikh appear to have been illegal,' and if this is intended as a defence not only of the manner in which Sheikh Sakar carried out his decision, but also of the admisssibility of the decision itself, this line of argument becomes intelligible only11 when, it is remembered that the Memorandum starts from the assumption that Hassan Samaih's proceedings were culpable. The argument of the British Memorandum, so far as this question is concerned, is as follows :—- _ clear that an agreement of such scope as that concluded between Hassan bamaih and Mr. W onckhaus ought to have been previously laid before all the parties interested, xhat was not done, and at least two of the partners did not give their consent to the agreement. But Hassan Samaih had no right to conclude the agreement without the knowledge of the other partners, for he was not the manager. Therefore Isa's complaint was well founded.' The Imperial Government, however, maintain that the partners did, as a matter of fact, sanction the agreement between Hassan Samaih and.Mr. Wonckhaus, but that this sanction was not really necessary, as Hassan Samaih is the manager of the company. With regard to the question whether the partners approved the agreement, the following persons are concerned besides Isa : Nedjef, son of the former partner Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Salih, of Bunder Abbas, and Malcolm, of Bushire. Nedjef asserts in his letter to Lieutenant Gabriel, British vice-consul at Bunder Abbas, of the 16th February, 1908 (Annex 18 of the British Memorandum), that he did not give his sanction to the agreement, and did not sign it. With regard to this it must in the first place be pointed out that it disputed that Nedjef was a partner. The matter stands thus: his father, Nakhoda Ali, as is clearly shown in the agreement regarding his entry as a partner (Annex 2 of the first German Memorandum), had a share _ on the strength of his engaging to superintend the work at t he mines, without putting capital into the concern. This partnership was accordingly connected with personal services, and therefore ceased when those services came to an end, that is,' at Nakhoda Ali's death. That; at any rate, was formerly Abdallatif s view, as is clearly# shown by the latter part of his letter to Hassan. Samaih of the 23rd June, 1905 (1^ Rebi II, 1323).* _ This view is shared by Hassan Samaih and Abdallah, and the former' energetically denied to the Imperial vice-consul at Bushire that he had ever recognised Nedjef as a partner. That Nedjef's father was not really a partner, but only an employd of the company with a share in the profits, is especially clear from the fact' that he did not take part in the reception of Sheikh Sakar into the company, and that it was not considered necessary for him to sign the document on the subject (Annex 4 a of the first German Memorandum), although it' was not a case of a simple transfer of a share already existing, but of the creation of a new share, and therefore the diminution of the rights of the remaining partners. Whatever decision may be arrived at on the question of Nedjef s partnership, a question which will have to be settled amongst the partners themselves, it is certain that Nedjef on several occasions expressed to tTurS 'partiesTiTs approval of the proceedings of Hassan Samaih, and that therefore no credence can be given to his assertions in the letter of the 16th February, 1908, referred to above. In particular, at the end of November 1907, at Bunder' Abbas, he said to j Abdallah, son of Hassan Samaih, in the presence of the dragoman of the Imperial vice- consulate at Bushire, that he entirely approved of the agreement with Wonckhaus, and of everything else that Hassan Samaih did, and that he regarded him and honoured him as a second father.! Moreover, when the British subject Brown, of the firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Co. was temporarily at Bunder Abbas in March 1908, Nedjef offered to sell him his (or rather his father's) share in the mining company ; at the same time he stated that he entirely approved of the agreement for the supply of oxide concluded between Hassan Samaih and Mr. Wonckhaus. Mr. Brown decided not to buy the share only because he knew that Hassan Samaih, Abdallah, and Abdallatif disputed Nedjet's partnership. Mr. Brown has made a declaration, the truth of which he is reads to confirm by an oath,! in regard to this incident. It would therefore appear that' the statements made by Nedjef in his letter of protest of the 16th February, 1908, denying his approval, which letter was communicated to Lieutenant Gabriel a month before the offer to Mr. Brown mentioned above, are not in accordance with the facts. Otherwise they would have to be considered as retracted by the statement made by Nedjef to Mr. Brown a month afterwards to the effect that he entirely approved of the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus for the supply of oxide. * Annex 82. t The Imperial Dragoman, Mirza- Abdul Hussein, was on that occasion on his way to Shar^eh accompanied by Abdallah, and had to wait at Bunder Abbas for the steamer to Shargeh. He has declared officially that during the conversation between Abdallah and Nedjef he simply listened and made no attemot to influence Nedjef. He says that Abdallah, too, tised no persuasion with Nedjef, and that the latter expressed his approval entirely of his own accord. - J Annex 33.12 No objection to the agreement with Wonckhaus was raised by the British protdg^ T, J. Malcolm, of Bushire, of whom the British Memorandum only says that the lessees had ' engagements ' with him, while as a matter of fact he had entered the company two years after the conclusion of the lease agreement and paid capital into it once, being the only partner except Hassan Samaih who has paid in any. In the British Memorandum it is made a matter of reproach to Hassan Samaih that, in reply to Malcolm's letter of the 26th June, 1906, asking for a copy of the agreement, he, in the first place, answered on the 13th July, 1906, that the agreement was drawn up in German, aud that in a later letter, dated the 14th October, 1906, he again declined to supply a^ copy on the ground that Mr. Wonckhaus had asked him not to say anything about this business (Annexes 13, 14, of British Memorandum). No doubt Hassan Samaih ought not to have made use of the excuse that the agreement was in German; but his anxiety to keep the terms of the agreement secret as long as possible, and especially not to co mmu nicate them to the firm of A. and T. J. Malcolm, is explained by business considerations. For Malcolm was a competitor, since Ins firm of A. and .T. J Malcolm is an agent for, and a shareholder in, the British firm of Strick and Co., in whose hands the Ormuz oxide trade is. Hassan Samaih had put his whole fortune of about 100,000 rupees into the Abu Musa oxide concern, which had so far been run at a loss, and which he now hoped would at last improve in consequence of the agree ment with Mr. Wonckhaus. He saw a great danger in the agreement getting to be known too early. ^ Subsequent events have shown how well-founded his apprehension of further difficulties was. Although Hassan Samaih did not send Malcolm the copy of the agreement in the first instance, he nevertheless, in his letter of the 13th July, 1906, communicated to him all that was of importance in it, as is seen from Annex 13 of the British Memorandum ; in particular he did not, as alleged in the British Memorandum, omit to answer the question whether other European firms could make similar agreements, but said straight out: ' We can therefore make no other contract.' In his reply of the 30th October, 1906 (11 Ramadan, 1324),* Malcolm says he will see whether it would be possible to sell the red oxide at a higher price or to get better terms, or whether, if it were found possible to obtain a higher price, the agreement could be cancelled or not. He further expressly states : ' If we are not sure of getting a higher price, we shall not get the former agreement cancelled.' In other words, Malcolm would have liked to get a higher price and better terms, and if he found he could get such he would have liked either to come to an arrangement with Mr. Wonck haus as to other terms, or if he (Malcolm) was able to obtain them from another party, to persuacie Mr. W ohckhaus to allow the agreement to be cancelled by amicable arrangement. It follows from this, however, that he considered the agreement as perfectly valid in itself. When Malcolm, later on, received a copy of the' agreement, ho 'vjio jo mc-ru .'■» it h .-i-i , ..-ov-coj.ui* m it. — —iiiiiiiiniri It appears from a letter addressed by Abdallatif to Hassan Samaih, on the 23rd June, 1905 (19 Rebi JI, 1323),f and a letter from the latter to Abdallatif of the 15th October, 1905 (i5^ ohaban, 1323), (Annex 9 of the first German Memorandum) that at that time a considerable quantity of oxide was already being sold to Mr. Wonck haus, and that it was proposed to supply oxide to Wonckhaus at a fixed price annually. As the correspondence shows, Abdallatif agreed to this. After the conclusion of the agreement of the 1st June, 1906, with Mr. Robert Wonckhaus for the delivery of oxide. Hassan Samaih communicates the fact to Abdallatif on the 11th June (18 Rebi II, 1324)!! and at the same time informs him of the substance of the agreement (Annex 11 of the British Memorandum). In his reply of the 14th June, 1906 (21 Rebi 11. 1324)4 which has now become of importance, Abdallatif openly expresses his satisfaction at the conclusion of the business, and the hope that better 'times are coming at last which will compensate for the sacrifices and disappointments of the past. The whole letter has evidently been written in a mood 'of relief, and furnishes indisputable evidence that Abdallatif gave his consent to the conclusion of the agreement. It is true tnat m tins letter he again show s the sceptical spirit of a person who is exnenenced m affairs, ano wno therefore cannoX' xeel any satisfaction without at the same time having fears of future difficulties ; he gives a warning against the conclusion of an agreement which would be equivalent to a lease of the mines or might give rise to difficulties which might conjure up the interference of more powerful persons. This is the meaning which must be attached to the letter when considered impartially. The German and the English translation (Annex 12 of the British Memorandum) of this letter correspond almost word for word. In particular the English translation too * Annex 34. f Annex 32. I Annex 35.13 makes^it impossible to doubt Abdallatifs absolute concurrence in the agreement with Mr. W onckhaus. The passages in the English translation which bear on the point are the following:— ^ery good ; I hope it is auspicious. It will be good fortune after trouble. In any case, our brother Abdullah must reach there to supervise the work, because I think the operations cannot be regulated without him At any rate. I am glad to hear this news5 if we are safe from this world's tricks more than before.' When the British Memorandum says: ' Abdallatif comments upon the transaction in guarded language,' it is adopting an interpretation which entirely ignores the passages just quoted, and gives disproportionate weight to the following sentence which is in very general terms ' Please, however, refrain from entering upon any arrangements whatever in the nature ot leases or deeds of contract from which there will arise difficulties and quarrels which will lead to complaints and claims . . . After all, any agreement may lead to difficulties and quarrels, which cannot be foreseen. But even if we go so far as to see in this sentence a condition which Aodaliatif wishes to attach to the consent which he has already given, the condition that is, that the agreement must not be a kind of lease, it must be said that this condition is completely fulfilled, for the agreement with Air. Wonckhaus is simply a contract for delivery and not a lease contract. It is not till about four months later that Abdallatif in a letter dated the 3rd October, 1906 (14 Shaban, 1324), begs Hassan Samaih to send him a copy of the agreement with Wonckhaus (Annex 7 of first German Memorandum). The reason for this is not that doubts have now suddenly arisen in Abdallatif's mind in regard to the agreement, but simply that ' the consul' would like to see the agreement.* On the 16th December, 1906 (27 Shaval, 1324), Hassan Samaih complies with this request (Annex 15 of British Memorandum). On the 23rd January, 1907 (8 Dulhidje, 1324),t Abdallatif replies that his son Isa is not satisfied with the agreement, because he was not asked his opinion and because he fears that difficulties may arise from the business connection with foreigners. He also reproaches Hassan Samaih for having exercised his own discretion in entering into the engagement, whereas he surely ought not to have bound himself without consulting the other partners. He goes on to say : '' It is better to try to cancel the agreement than to do as he (the German) wishes. The fact that Abdallatif only blames the inde pendent action of Hassan Samaih points to the conclusion that he does not dispute the legal validity of the agreement, and this is made quite clear by a consideration of that short passage in the letter which deals with the question what is to be done now. Abdallatif simply advises that an attempt should be made to cancel the agreement. The British Memorandum translates the passage in question as follows ;— ' The nullification of this agreement is better than its acceptance,' and explains that the phrase 'is better' is a euphemism, common in the Arabic epistolary style, expressing a definite decision. In view, however, of the two enclosed opinions,§ which, while differing in details, in the result arrived at entirely support the view of the Imperial Government, the latter must adhere to their contention that the meaning of the- passage in question can only be that the attempt should be made to cancel But this assumes that the agreement is legally valid. In giving this advice-, AbdallaUff himself admits that the agreement has legal force. Furthermore, Abdallatif in his next letter, dated the 27th March, 1907 (12 Sefer, 1325),|| again admits that he originally, that is in his letter of the 14th June, 1906 (21 Rebi II, 1324), concurred in the agreement. It is not easy to * In the circumstances this can only mean the Brit Consul, with whom Abdallatif, as consular agent, is officially connected. ' ' f Annex 36. j It is noticeable that Abdallatif allows more than a month to pass—he received the letter on December 21, 1906, as appears from the letter of March 27, 1907—before he sends the answer, whereas previously when Hassan Samaih informed him of the conclusion of the agreement only three days elapsed between the date of dispatch of this communication and the date on which he sent off his reply concurring. Thus we evidently have not here a spontaneous decision of AbdfQlatif founded entirely on his examination of the terms of the agreement. § Annexes 37 and 38. (| Annex 39. [2574 c—1] E14, understand how the British Memorandum can come to ^ even in the translation of the letter there printed (Annex 1 / of we find the passage :— « I sent you back an answer, dated the 21st Bebi II, 1324, which purported to convey acquiescence ' The facts cited above show that Nejef—if, indeed, he is to be considered a p ^ at all—as well as Malcolm and Abdallatif, the latter as the r ^ nesei ' ~ q nn , •], Isa, declared their approval of the conclusion of the agreement )e ^ 1 eeI ' a '' and Mr. Wonckhaus. Of course, the legal position is not affected V ^ ' _^i that Nejef and Abdallatif subsequently denied that they had grv en by the fact that, in particular, Abdallatif, after he had procured a copy o u c agre ,1, for the British consul, changed his mind about the agreement. But, apart from this, the Imperial Government are, moreover, of opiniou ia t- i a was no necessity for Hassan Samaih to obtain the concurrence of the oJiei p^i jii.,..s, he was the manager of the company. _ , . ,1 ,1 The circumstances of locality, apart from anything else, made x« a so ate y necessary that one of the partners should be authorised to represen the con^Mi.j alone in dealings with other persons, and to bind the company by his acis^v-y ou the previous approval of the other partners. Isa lives at S.iaige i, .^a.coii.n a Bushire, Nejef—assuming that he is a partner—at Bunder Abbas,^Hassan bamain a Lingah. From Lingah to Bushire and from Bunder Abbas to Lingaft tnere is a. wee-1}- post, from Bushire to Lingah and from Lingah to Bunder Abbas only a /ortnighclypos . Postal communication with Shargeh has only been established within the last few yeais , at the time when the company was founded there were only sailing-boats available for the journey, which took from three to ten days, according to the weather, to reach Lingah from Shargeh. Telegraphic communication is entirely wanting on the Oman Coast; the telegraph station on the Island of Henjam can be reached from Lingah by sailing-boat in from two to four days; the conveyance of a telegram from Henjam to Lingah takes the same time. How is it possible to imagine a properly^ conducted business with such bad means of communication if the managing partner, before con cluding a business transaction, has to ask the opinion of three people living respectively at Shargeh, Bushire, and Bunder Abbas, await tueir replies, perhaps answer objections, modify certain provisions in accordance with the wisties ot one of the partners, and then again refer to the others for their sanction of the modifications ? This state of things being duly taken into consideration, a Memorandum of Association was agreed upon in which the rights and duties of the manager are regulated with some detail. In a letter dated the 6th January, 1899 (23 Shaban, 1316),* Abdallatif sent the Memorandum of Association, which he had himself drawn up, to Hassan Samaih at Lingah, and requested that all the partners there, Hassan Samaih, Abdallah, and Nakhoda Ali, would sign it and then send it back. In sending it he observes that Sheikhs Salim and Sakar have seen the Memorandum, and that Sakar has asked for a copy, which shows that Sakar, too, approved of the Memorandum. Hassan Samaih, Abdallah, and Nakhoda Ali signed the Memorandum, added an additional article. No. 6, providing for the purchase of four large and four small boats at the expense of the company, and sent the altered Memorandum to • Abdallatif, Hassan Samaih keeping a copy. On the 21st January, 1899 (9 Eamadan, 1316),t Abdallatif wrote that he had shown the Memorandum to Isa and Bakar,£ but that they had not agreed to the engagement of eight boats for the service of the company. No other objections were raised, which is quite natural, as the remainder of the Memorandum had been drafted by Abdallatif himself, and had already been agreed to by the partners living at Shargeh. As Hassan Sama ; h at once replied that he and the two other partners at Lingah consented to the cancelling of the boats, all the partners were now in agreement as to the contents of the Memorandum of Association. No fresh copy of the Memorandum was made, and none was necessary , since the correspondence which had passed showed that all had approved of its contents. In consequence of the adoption of this new Memorandum of Association, the older provisions not in harmony with it, which were agreed upon when Nakhoda Ali joined in May 1898, of course ceased to be in force. * Annexes 13 and 14. f Annex 40. t The communication of the Memorandum to Sakar is explained by the fact that at that time he was still a partner.15 ] he ai rtmgements made at taat time for working together, however, had reference only to the collection of mother-of-pearl. (Annex 2 of the first German Memorandum.) i / r COramg l ' ulcle ^ 0 ' ^h® Memorandum of Association, Hassan Samaih is o Je . ' ^ t^remost, i.e., the leader, in the necessary negotiations with the foreign* merchants^ for the exploitation of the mines; he will sign ' Hassan-ibn-Ali and Oompany, and win explain to the partners how the negotiations and sales undertaken by iiim m connection with the different mines stand. _ H assan Samaih, then, carries on the negotiations ; he alone has authority to sign for the firm, and consequently to conclude for it .f ^tBmally, too, the circumstance that the firm is called after him only, and that tlie remaining partners are collectively represented by ' and Company,' goes to show the prominent position which hc^ occupied in the company. Hassan oamaih is simply to keep the partners informed of what is going on, letting them know ox tne negotiations and of the sales concluded. It would be impossible to express more, clearly than is here done that Hassan Samaih is the sole manager of the company, ana that he is the person who is particularly authorised to conclude the sales vitii foreign merchants without being hound to secure the co-operation of the remaining partners. That this is the meaning ol article 1 is, moreover, shown with particular clearness by the circumstance that, in the articles which follow, those cases are expressly mentioned in whicn the concurt^nce of the other partners is on each occasion necessary. The principle observed is quite clear: in the case of transactions which are intended to bring in revenue to the company, and which often necessitate a rapid decision, as, for instance, tne conclusion of sales, the manager acts quite independently ; but where it is a case of spending money for the company and throwing a burden on the individual partners, their concurrence must first be obtained. Hassan Samaih, as a matter of fact, always availed himself of his powers as manager from the time that the company was founded, and this is shown by a number of the letters in the annexes inter alia. He concluded sales independently, amongst others, previously with the firm of \Vonckhaus and Co&gt; ? he kept the company's books, and signed with the signature of the firm. The post delivered to him all letters addressed to the firm. The other partners raised no objections to these proceedings, and even if the above-mentioned Memorandum of Association did not exist, one would be justified in concluding that the partners concurred in his acting as manager from the fact that he occupied the position for many years without opposition. But there are further proofs that Hassan Samaih was always recognised as manager. When on one occasion difficulties arose in connection with a sale of oxide, and Alassan Samaih asx^ed TvXaleoxm foi advice, tne latter answered# on the 2nd -February^ 1901 ^12 fehaval, lol8),^ that he, ivTalcoim, couid not do anything, although he was a partner, because an individual partner had not a right to act That the firm of Strick and Co., too, had partners, but an individual partner of that firm could not engage in law-suits for the firm, but only a person authorised to do so; and that Hassan Samaih must bring the action himself. It could not be stated more' distinctly that Hassan Samaih is the manager of the company. After the cancellation of the lease agreement by Sakar, Hassan Samaih asked Malcolm for his advice as to what he should do. Malcolm answered, m a letter dated the 7th November, 1907,§ that, as Hassan was a British subject, he had better apply to the British consulate-general That is to say, a partner/who is not authorised to represent the firm himself, advises the managing partner to take steps on behalf of the firm. In a letter dated the 13th July, 1902 (7 Eebi II, 1320),|| Malcolm makes an offer, addressed to Alhadj Hassan-ibn-Samaih and Co., on behalf of Strick and Co. Hassan Samaih is to telegraph his reply and to guarantee the quality of the oxide. Nothing is said of the other partners ; their concurrence, which, indeed, could not have been obtained in time, is not asked for. Here, again, Hassan Samaih appears as the * In the Arabic text the word ' eledjnebiye '—•' foreignis used. f In the British Memorandum Hassan Samaih is blamed for describing- himself in the agreement with Mr, Wonckhans as 64 owner and holder of Bu Musa Concession,'' These words appear only in the headino- of the agreement and are inaccurate for the reason that Hassan left out the words 44 and Go.'

It remains to examine the question whether Hassan bamaih immea^ ' ,,^ bv the conclusion of the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus and^wnether So, won ^ ^ _ been justified in complaining on this ground. It appears, irom ' lCA 0U j K ^ /*. complaint given in the British Memorandum, that the company is _ held to e been injured by the circumstance that, in consequence of the agreement wu,n ' it is orecluded from profiting by any rise that may take place in. jiie price o • That is an obiection that might be raised against any contract toi c e ivexy cone u e for a certain' term, and is of no importance so far as Mr, vvonckLiaus is co &lt; - There might oossibly, indeed, be a question whether the agreement as a wnole ib iniurious to the mte/ests of the company, and whether in the circumstances Hassan Samaih, as a good man of business, was justified in concluding such an agreement tor the company. „ rm - The provisions of the agreement are in substance as follows, i he company is bound to deliver to Mr. Wonckhaus free on board ship at Abu Musa annuaiiy .or a term of four years 2,000 to 5,000 tons of oxide of a particular quality at tne price o* 15s. 6d. per ton. Mr. Wonckhaus is bound to pay this _ price ana to take at least 2,000 tons, and, further, if he requires more, and there is enough oxiae, to bay up to 5,000 tons. On the other hand, the company may not sex! oxide to anyone eise, with the exception of about 5,000 to 6,000 sacks, which it may sen to India. On uhe expiration of the agreement Mr. Wonckhaus has the right of renewing the agreement on the same terms or the terms offered by another serious applicant ^ , , , , , , For a proper appreciation of this agreement it must be remembered that the company had till then worked at a heavy loss. It appears trom the books of the company—which were kept very neatly, clearly, and well-—that the tota. expenditure from the commencement of the works to the beginning of December x 9^ &amp; amounted to 301.043 rupees.'®' On the other side, the receipts amount to L07,804 rupees, so that there is a deficit of 93,209 rupees. These figures show that the financial position of the company was very bad, and that it would have had to work at a profit for a lom time before the previous losses could have been made good and a dividend declared. ^ The agreement with M. Wonckaus gave the company an opportunity oi selling, at a fixed mice, which was independent of the fluctuations of the market, and was guaranteed to it for a number of years, a considerable minimum quantity of oxide, and possibly two and a-half times as much. The company was therefore m a position to count with certainty on receiving a minimum of 1,050/ a-year and to arrange its whole work accordingly. These receipts might be raisea to 3,875/., not counW what was sold to India. The prospects of the company from a commercial point of view were therefore such as it had never had ^before. It was m the nature of things that the company should have to accept into the bargain certain limitations and obligations Agreements like the one m question Detween producers ana merchants are usual in all parts of the world, and if a normal price and a fixed minimum sale are miaranteed to the producer, he on his part must give security to the merchant who makes his arrangements accordingly, that the article shall not suddenly be diveited nuo the hands of his competitors. The chief point is that the risk to the producer here sinks to a minimum, while the risk to the merchant remains great. He is bouna to take over the minimum quantity at the guaranteed price, and runs the risk of having to ao so when the market price is such that he is obliged to sell the article at a small profit or no profit at all, or even at a loss, or he may have to buy it when he cannot _ sell it oj all It is likewise a very ordinary thing that, m view of these possibilities, tne price should from the first be 'fixed at such a figure that a certain margin is left to the merchant, since otherwise the latter could not take part in the transaction at all. The circumstance also deserves particular consideration tnat, in a case like the one under discussion' the producer is not in a position to avail himself of the opportunities of gain to the same extent as the merchant. However skilled in business Hassan Samaih and Abdallatif may be. it will not be possible for them to dispose of the produce of the oxide mines on Abu Musa directly and without the interposition of a middleman, and to profit by the constant changes in the international market, as they do not possess either the * In the account of expenditure is included 5 per cent:, simple interest on the total sum, which Hassan Samaih reckons as due to himself, since, apart from the 2,000 rupees which Malcolm put into the concern, he paid, all the expenses, while the remaining partners paid nothing.17 necessary Kriow.i«dge or connections, and. would not be in a position to organise the enterprise effectively. As regai ds the price agreed upon, it must be considered as quite sufficient. It must be recollected that in July 1902 Malcolm, acting on behalf of Strick and Co., offered i s.6fi. pev ton,* i.e., less than half the price here stipulated. Furthermore, it is to be noted that the company is not bound, for ever by the agreement After the expiration of four years Wonckhaus has only a prior right to a new agreement on the same terms as the old one, or on the terms offered by compe titors. So that the company in any case has a chance of obtaining higher prices in consequence of competition, while on the other hand it cannot in any circumstances be forced to continue the agreement at lower prices than before. It is true that the company cannot profit by momentary rises of price, but as matters stand it is very doubtful whether the company could in any case utilise such momentary rises ; on the other hand, it is in a position to derive the full benefit from a, rise in the average price, a rise that can only be estimated at intervals of considerable length ; while if, at the end of the four years, the average price is lower than the price stipulated in the agreement, the company regains complete freedom. In view of what has been stated above, the conclusion must be that the agreement with Mr. W onckhaus is advantageous to the company, and that the disadvantages arising from a certain limitation of freedom of action are considerably outweighed by the advantages presented by a certainty of selling for several years at adequate prices. Hassan Samaih was acting entirely in the interest of the company when he concluded the agreement with Mr. W onckhaus; if he had neglected this opportunity doubts as to his business capacity would have been fully justified. The result of the above examination, then, is that, assuming that Sheikh Sakar had a right to decide the matter as a judge—which is disputed—his decision could not possibly be to the effect that the lease agreement should be cancelled. Taking the most liberal view of his powers, he could only deal with the and pronounce judgment on the question whether Hassan Samaih ought to pay com pensation to the plaintiff partner on account of the conclusion of this agreement. It has been proved, in the first place, that the partners gave their approval to the agreement; in the second place, that their approval was not necessary, because Hassan Samaih, on the strength of his powers as manager, had authority to conclude the agreement indepen dently, whether such authority was expressly granted him by the Memorandum of Association or whether it is to be considered as having been admitted in practice by his having been allowed to exercise it without dispute for many years. This disposes of the first ground on which a decision unfavourable to Hassan Samaih might have been given. It has further been shown that the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus is advantageous to the company, and that by its conclusion the interests of the individual partners have been secured as completely as circumstances admit. It follows that, from this point of view also, a decision unfavourable to Hassan Samaih could not be given, especially as evidence is produced showing that the partners approved of the agreement, which approval would preclude them from claiming any compensation, even if the agreement were really disadvantageous. Accordingly Isa's complaint is entirely unfounded, and there was no legal ground for Sheikh Sakar to give any judicial decision unfavourable to Hassan Samaih. The decision pronounced must therefore be regarded as entirely contrary to justice. 2. Could Sheikh Sakar cancel the Lease A of the administration The various letters from Sheikh Sakar to Hassan Samaih, in which he pronounces the cancellation of the lease agreement and orders the cessation of the work, as well as certain letters from Abdallatif, show clearly that Sheikh Sakar was induced partly by political considerations to take steps against the mining company. Looking at the matter from this point of view, the objections which Sakar has to make to the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus are the following : He regards this agreement as a sub-letting of the oxide mines to third parties who are not British subjects, but subjects of a foreign Power, whereas, he argues, according to the terms of the original agreement, the partners have to work the mines themselves, and may not lease them to others Sakar fears that now that a foreigner is one of the parties interested in the mines, the [2574 c—1] * See p. 15, and annex 43.18 latter may pass out of his possession, and he may gradually lose the island. Final 7'. ® points out that he did not give permission for the conclusion of agreements wi foreigners, and that the lease agreement does not contain any clause under which tne whole output could be delivered to one individual without his (Sakar s) sanction. (Annexes 12, 16, 20, 22 of the first German Memorandum and Annex 39 oi this Memorandum). In the first place it is not easy to understand how the agreement of the 1st June, 1906, can be regarded as a letting of the mines to Mr. Wonckhaus. The stipulation chat the oxide is to be delivered free on board, and the detailed arrangements concerning the quantity to be loaded daily, make it clear that Mr. Wonckhaus was not to have anything to do with the working of the mines themselves.* The agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus is a simple contract for delivery, an entirely unobjectionable commercial transaction such as might take place anywhere without giving rise to comment, and which was intended to promote purely commercial interests. Even if this agreement had given to Mr. Wonckhaus for a certain time a position in the nature of a monopoly as regards the red oxide obtained on Abu Musa, that would not have prevented the transaction from being a perfectly legitimate one. It is to be observed, however, that a monopoly in the strict sense of the word was not established, since the company was at liberty to sell certain quantities to India. Sakar's fear that the agreement may lead not only to the property in the mines being gradually lost to the owner—whether he is Salim or Sakar—but even to the separation of the Island of Abu Musa from Shargeh, is so senseless that it is really not worth while to discuss it. As regards Sakar's objection to the conclusion of agreements with foreigners, it is to be observed that the lease agreement concluded between Salim and the company contains no provision against the sale of the produce of the mines to foreigners. On the contrary, in view of the freedom of trade recognised in the Persian Gulf, and the absence of an express prohibition in the lease agreement, it may be considered to be taken for granted that the company of lessees is to be at liberty to conclude arrange ments for supplying foreigners also. Moreover, in the Memorandum of Association, with which Sakar had been acquainted for years and which he had approved of, sales to foreigners were expressly provided for, and such sales were as a matter of fact repeatedly concluded, without any objection on Sakar's part. His observation in his letter of the 26th March, 1907 (11 Safer, 1325, Annex 16 of first German Memo randum) : ' We did not tell you to make contracts with strangers from foreign Powers without informing us,' is therefore entirely groundless and misleading. It is also strange that, as appears from the letter just referred to, Sheikh Sakar should wish British subjects to be treated differently from those of other Powers. From the point of view of the Shargeh State a British subject is certainly just as much a foreigner as is the subject of any other Power. Yet Sheikh Sakar has' uothing to say against the company of lessees concluding agreements with British subjects, while agreements with other foreigners are not to be allowed. This is evidently contrary to the principle of the ' open door.' . In the view of the Imperial Government the agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus neither infringes the terms of Salim's concession, nor is in any way dangerous to the internal peace, external independence, or territorial integrity of Shargeh. It is there fore _not apparent how the action of Sakar against the company could be justified by considerations connected with the welfare of the State. ' The conclusions arrived at above may be summarised as follows 1. Sheikh Salim is owner of the Island of Abu Musa, and therefore, according to the commercial law prevailing on the Persian Gulf, had a right to lease the oxide mines there to the mining company, Hassan-ibn-Ali and Co., in his own name According to the Mohammedan religious law he could not conclude the lease agreement • according to that law, however, the company would have acquired the exclusive rioht to the produce of the mines simply by the fact of working them. 2. The owner of the island, whoever he may be, has no authority, either according- to the lease agreement (which is to be judged by commercial law), or accordina to religious law, to revoke or terminate the rights of the mining company or to hinder'the company in any other way from working the mines. 3. Hassan Samaih had authority, as manager of the mining company, to conclude * The British Memorandum observes that the arrangement between Sheikh Salim and the comnau- w not really a lease agreement, but ' a permit to work these mines.' If even that arrangement is not to i f considered a ' leasehold,' it is incomprehensible how a simple contract for the delivery of an artiH^ r-,vf regarded as a 46 leaseholcL ,, u De19 agreements like that with Mr. W onckhaus, signing in the name of the company, without cojiSUJumg the other partners. Such agreements at once become binding on the other paitners, in ix.ie case under consideration, however, their approval was also signified. , ,ie agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus is advantageous to the mining company, so that the partners have not been injured by Hassan Samaih's action as manager. 5. 1 here was therefore no reason for a complaint of the company against Hassan Samaui on the ground of action contrary to agreement or duty. Ihere was accordingly no ground for action on the part of Sheikh Sakar against Hassan Samaih for the protection of the other partners. Moreover, the seat of the company is at Lmgah, and the partners of the company are not subjects of the'Sheikh of bhargeh, so that he has no jurisdiction in matters concerning the relations of the partners with each other. ^ In any case, he could not exercise such jurisdiction himself, but should have had the dispute settled bv the judge. 1 7* ' i ^ e agreement between the mining company and Mr. Wonckhaus, which is nothing but the conclusion of an ordinary and permissible business transaction, and which cannot have any political aims, neither infringes the lease agreement nor is in any way dangerous to the interests of the State of Shargeh, so that the action taken by Sheikh Sakar against the company cannot be justified on the ground of the general interests of the administration of the countrv. 8. Sheikh Sakar's interference is not limited to redressing a wrong alleged to have been done by one partner to the others, or to preventing the carrying out of an agree- ment alleged to be contrary to the interests of the country, but simply deprives the whole company of the basis of its existence. The company, in which the German firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Co. have a share, ^is thereby^ very seriously injured, since the realisation of its object is made impossible and it is not in a position to carry out current obligations imposed upon it by contract. y. Sakar's proceedings, then, are clearly a violation of law—an exercise of arbitrary power. xne British Memorandum maintains that, as Hassan Samaih had no authority to conclude a contract for the delivery of oxide with Mr. Wonckhaus which would be binding on the company, it is open to Mr. Wonckhaus to claim compensation from Hassan Samaih for non-fulfilment of the contract. There can, however, be no doubt, after what has been stated in tne present Memorandum, that the responsibility for carrying out the contract for the supply of oxide rests, not with Hassan Samaih personally, but with the company as a company. The fulfilment of the contract by the company has, however, up till now been prevented by the arbitrary act of Sheikh Sakar, and the lawless state of things brought about by that act. In consequence of the conclusion of this contract by Mr. Wonckhaus, acting in the interests of the firm of R, Wonckhaus and Co., this latter firm at the present time still lias a substantial interest in the existence and prosperity of the mining company. When the disputes of the company with Sheikh Sakar placed the firm in a difficult position, it was only doing what was necessary in the defence of its legitimate interests when it endeavoured to acquire a share in the company, and so to exercise a direct influence on the fortunes of the latter. There was no reason why the illegal interference of the sheikh should prevent the firm from acting as it thought fit. 1 he attempt is made in the British Memorandum to show that the firm of W bnckiiaus has no locus standi in this dispute, on the ground that it either acquired its share in ignorance of the position of affairs, in which case it must address its claim to the vendor, or else acted with knowledge of the position, and has consequentlv itself to blame for the injury it has sustained. This line of argument starts from the erroneous assumption that the lease agreement is no longer legally valid. If that were the ease, there would doubtless be no foundation for the present complaint. But as the dispute turns upon the question whether the cancelling of the lease agree ment was legal or illegal, and as the Imperial Government, for the reasons stated in this Memorandum, are convinced of the illegality of the cancelling of the agreement- there does not appear to be any reason why the firm of Wonckhaus should be pre vented from putting forward, on the strength of the share acquired by it in the company^ its claims m respect of expropriation. The firm seems to be the more justified in doing so from the circumstance that it was evidently the aim of Sheikh Sakar's action throughout to render the rights enjoyed by Mr. Wonckhaus under the agreement for the supply of oxide illusory for the benefit of his competitors. Sheikh Sakar compelled by force of arms the cessation of the working of the oxide20 mines. His proceedings are also an infraction of the ' Maritime Truce, ^ to che presei na tion of which in those regions His Majesty's Government devote particular attention. His action was supported by G re tit Britain to the extent that the ^ gun-boat ' Lapwing ' towed to Abu Musa the boats of Sheikh Sakar in which the sheikh s armed men were brought to the island to stop the work by force and prevent the landing of the employes of the firm of Wonckhaus.®' So that not only was Sakar s attack on uhe rights of the mining company made with the knowledge of the officials ^jt His Majesty's Government, but it was also directly assisted by them. The Imperial Govern ment cannot, therefore, do otherwise than include His Majesty's Government in che responsibility for the consequences of this attack. November 1909. Annexes.

So that if, during the attempt of Brown and Ali Zenker to land, there was no ' loss of life and bloodshed,' to prevent which, was, according to the British Memorandum, the sole object of the voyage of the ' Lapwing,' that circumstance was not due to the British forces, which had already departed, but was entirely owing to the bad shooting of Sakar's men.

Explain it to us, and you will be rewarded, anu may God reward you for us ! Opinion. The answer. 0 God (allow) justice to prevail and guide to trutn ; The red oxide mine referred to belongs to the group of open mines, which do not, by being worked, acquire the character of property to be freely disposed oi; no one can validly make such an open mine his private property to the exclusion of others, nor can^ it be granted to him as a fief by patent from the Sultan ; but it is common property oi the Moslems, like drinking places for cattle, grass, and firewood. And there is^ a consensus of opinion (among jurists) as regards the prohibition ot the letting of the mine in question, and the exploitation referred to does not constitute a taking possession ; and, as a corollary of that legal principle, if a person makes use of the mine and works in it and extracts from it the red oxide referred to, he has, in extracting the red oxide, more right to it than any one else, and that (holds good) if he knows that it is a mine ; but if he does not know till' after the exploitation that it is a mine, he becomes the owner of it as land and soil and materially, and that according to the consensus of opinion quoted by the Imam Attabari; and it is expressly stated in the Mughni and in the Nihaye that it makes no difference whether it is extracted for trading purposes or for any other object. In these circumstances the aforesaid Alhadj Hassan has precedence in the extraction of the said red o because he came first and up to this moment has not taken his hand off it; but at the moment when he took his hand off the red oxide and took the money for it, lost come under the power of Alhadj Hassan.

JOHN van ESS, M.A., Langu Missio Annex 38. xa the letter of Abdellatif to Hassan Samaih, of 8, Dulhidje, 1324 (23rd January, 1907), the following passage occurs:— sis JliajuL.! (istibtal hadihi 'Imuqawale chair n vin idjabethu). i he first word JlkxLdl does not appear in the dictionaries; but according to the analogy of such formations it can only be translated : ' the wish (or endeavour) to bring about an annulling ' (the annulling itself would be (tabtil) or (ibtal), see, €.g.^ Have, Arabic-English Dictionary, Beirut, Catholic Press, 1899, p. 36; * Jk-U Jk' to annul, to cancel [a deed] '). I he last word aJyWl (iajubethu) can on account of the masculine pronoun only refer to one of two preceding words : 1. ' My son Isa,' or the ''he' in the subordinate clause reierring to 'my son Isa : s ' for he apprehends difficulties from the participation of foreigners in this business.' 2. ' The German.' It cannot refer to Isa, because that would have no meaning. So that the in idjabethu can only refer to the German, and that makes sense; for (adjab) (with accusative of the person) signifies : ' to answer someone, to agree with someone, to comply with the wish of someone.' The meaning of the sentence is therefore : ' it better to aim at the annulment of this agreement wishes.' The opinion of the missionary van Ess on the passage agrees with mine in regard to JlkdJ (istibtal). He does not explain the word (idjabethu), but alters it to (idjabetha). The view that the wrong pronoun (masculine instead of feminine) is used here, as happens not unfrequently in these documents, and that it is justifiable to substitute the 'right' pronoun, is erroneous, for the reason that after the verb (adjab),the accusative, which here appears as an affixed pronoun, can only denote a and not a thing; but if the word were (idjabetha), the reference would be to a thing, viz., the IKUU (muqawale: 'agreement'). The translation 'an assent thereto' is incorrect. Prof. Db. MARTIN HARTMANN. Hermsdorff, near Berlin, November 20, 1909. [2574 c—1] L36 Annex 39.

Also it is possible, by (good) arrangement, for the workmen to work for twenty days before the arrival of the ship, and it is possible for them to extract a great deal in that time ; other shippings should not be thought of till afterwards. To extract the red oxide from the ground^and then leave it lying in the island is too expensive. It is now evident that shipping to India leads to loss of time. The people ask for samples; if they can get samples they give orders, but not otherwise. It is clear that the work was carried on» 37 assiduously without the existence of a demand ; only the expenses are evident, and God only knows what is the use of it! As regards the ship on which was dispatched the red oxide for the firm oi Asfar, on whom you drew the bill, the partners do not know how the business ended: apparently the expenses were not covered. Mines out of which so small a profit is made need not necessarily be worked with such assiduity. The reply of the partners is therefore : for these red' oxide mines four boats are sufiicient—two to hold 100 sacks each and two 150. And as the place of shipping is near, each boat can load and unload four times a-day, and the two boats that hold 100 sacks each can load and unload on the (different) sides of the island. Since the revenue from these mines is small they will not bear such heavy expenses. The partners count on getting a profit out of these mines, but if there are endless heavy expenses they cannot get rid of the idea that they are being asked to put their hands' in their pockets and pay. In short, your placing eight boats in the service of the red This is the view of your partners : and greeting ! ABD ALL A.T1F-IBN - ABD AKR AHMAN. 9 Ramadan, 1316 {January 21, 1899).

AESHAM and TEKKAN MALCOLM. o • Note of translator (Oriental): for Abu Musa.CONFIDENTIAL. No. 1344, dated Mohammerah, the 17th May (received 5th June) 1911. From Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C .S I., C .I .E., Political Resident in the Pei elan Gulf, ^he Hon ble S ir A. H. McMahon , K .C .I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. 1 have tne honour at length to submit the material collected for our reply to the German Rejoinder in the Abu Musa case, together with my observations on it. 2. men I telegraphed from Hen]am at the end of March that I had collected the local material and that the writing of it up would occupy some days. I did not realize that it would prove to be quite the intricate task which I have found it, to deal with all the small points used in the German communication. When at headquarters I am subject to incessant interruption and I have only been able to complete the report by coming for a few days to the Shat- el-Arab and working in quiet on the La wrence. The German Rejoinder was a formidable document if read by itself, but when studied by the light of the papers already recorded, a great deal of the substance fell out of it, and I have seen no reason to alter the appraisement which I made of it in enclosure (1) to my note of February 19,1910, submitted to His Majesty's Foreign Office. ^ So far as I can judge, the fundamental points of our case remain unshaken and the papers now submitted will, I hope, be found to supply a not unsatisfactory reply, to accompany our offer of compromise. To save time, I have ventured to forward two copies of the papers by the same mail to the Political Secretary, India Office. Brief comment in summary of the fresh It seems unnecessary to do more than take up the thread from the point where it was left by my note submitted to His Majesty's Foreign Office on 12tli February 1910, to which I beg reference. The ' Issues ' referred to below are those framed in that note. Issue (a)— (1) The right to jetsam and flotsam. It is shown by documentary and testamentary evidence that in the Gulf the right is levied by the local inhabitants and their overlord, if he can, and sees fit to do so, takes his share. It is shown r.lso that no one but the ruling Shaikh has been recognized in this connection, but that he (Sagar) in virtue of the arrangement by which he allowed Salim the income of Abu Musa, has left the levy to him. (2) The rejected version of. the oxide concession, dated 6th April 1898, is shown to have been drafted by Abdullah bin Hasan Samaiyeh himself and to have been rejected by Abdul Latif specifically on account of the unwarrantable claim therein put into Salim's mouth, of formal owner ship. The final version of the concession was then drafted by Abdul Latif himself. (3) What the German note calls ' revenue from mother-of-pearl and canary seed ' is shown to be a mistranslation. It should be ' ground rent from storage of £ muhar' and c zinni oyster-shells.' The ' muhar ' and ' zinni' are two species of pearl-bearing shells. The word for canary seed ' kazni 5 is somewhat like ' zinni.' Shaikh Sagar specifically allowed this to go to Salim as part of the income of the island. (4) The mica lease was given with the ruling Shaikh's knowledge and consent and Shaikh Salim was allowed to take proceeds as part of revenue of island. It proved to be a mare's nest and fizzled out. Salim's enjoyment of the income of the island, with the consent and subject to the pleasure of the ruling Shaikh, is not disputed. O20oFDI may mention tere for the information of Government—- it has^ been considered unnecessary to mention it in tlie evidence that a change .has come about in the relations between Shaikh Sagar and Saiim. Shaikh Sagar's son Khaled, Shaikh of Kas-el-Khaima, having died ofcon- sumptioii, Sagar sent his uncle Salim there temporarily to take charge as Deputy Governor. Soon after his arrival there his son committed a murder in connection with a love affair. Shaikh Sagar wanting to na\ e the murderer tried and punished: Salim in order to save his son set himself up adversely to Shaikh Sagar and placed himself on the defensive It being the pearling season and all his men away, Shaikh Saga.r took no punitive action and eventually made terms with Salim and allowed him to remain as Shaikh of Ras-el-Khaima. He has accordingiy ceased to pay him any pension and withdrawn Abu Musa from his enjoymer.t. I do not think we need mention this as the development is still fresh and had better be left to crystallize quietly. Issue (6). A quantity of similar evidence has been obtained in refutation of the mercantile and clerical evidence furnished in the German Rejoinder. Issue (c). The Memorandum of Association proves never to have been \ completed or even seen by the other partners—and never to have been acted upon. Hasan himself now claimed (to Abdul Latif) to be entitled to act on it, nor even mentioned it in his remonstrances. As an authority in Hasan's hands it did not exist. We concede that Hasan up to a certain point was managing partner, but this monopoly contract was a new departure, beyond his powers. Issue (a), requires no fresh evidence. It is further argued. Issue (e). Important evidence has been produced In the shape of Malcolm's deed of partnership corroborated by a letter of Hasan Samaiyeh, showing that Hasan himself drew up and inserted a prohibition against the sale by any partner of any share without the express consent and signature of the other partners. In the case of his purchase of Yusuf's share and transfer to Brown, he neglected to comply with this condition ; it is therefore invalidated in any case by his own provision. Issue (f) is combated. No evidence is nee led. May$0, 1911, P. Z. COX. Jiemarks on the German exposition of those are not disputed (1) Shaikh Sagar at the time intended to drive Shaikh Salim out of Abu hy force but was frevented from doing so by the in the Qulf. Yes ; indirectly prevented. Shaikh Sagar was reminded by the British Resident that the principles of the Ma^ime Truce applied to the islands, and was informed that he must not let his quarrel with his uncle lead to a disturbance of it. Shaikh Salim was given pacific advice, of a like nature. But for his fear of our displeasure it would obviously have been a simple matter for Shaikh Sagar, who at that time had all his tribesmen at his back, to send two or three full of armed men to Abu Musa and eject Shaikh Salim or bring him away. The latter had no following with him at the time or means of defending himself. But the British political authorities know by experience that if these Arab Shaikhs are allowed to send armed tribesmen to sea in boats, their followers inevitably get out of hand and probably start firing on or looting innocent craft, and thus dis turb the martime truce generally. We have in consequence been obliged to make it an invariable rule, not to agree to the passage by sea of full of armed men, unless it be with the express consent of the Resident and in the presence, if necessary, of one of His Majesty's ships. As a matter of fact it would probably have saved a good deal of subsequent trouble in this case, had the Resident allowedfchaikh K -agar to take what steps He pleased against Shaikh Salim, merely sending a ship to the spot to make sure, that, apart from their quarrel, there should he no oisturhance oi^ the general peace. Such, it will be remembered, was the course pursued wnen tohaikh Sagar evicted Hasan Samaiyeh's workmen in October 1907, A. AL b. ~,apmng oemg deputed to see that no lawlessness occulted: but in 1883 the tact ptobabiy was that the Resident had no ship at his disposal at the moment ancl tneretore took the next best course he could, namely to sterilize the dispute by strictly warning ^both parties that they must not break the ma itime truce. Bat Detause Shaikn bagar loyally bowed to the British Representative's wishes 111 thts directum he cannot reasonably be thereby held to have forfeited rights wmch he possessed^ as ruling DhaiKh and which he could have made good but for our action. _ ere it to be contended that Shaikh Salun acquired Abu Musa under ® 1 ^ c . ^o^ditiona, ii would be equivalent to saying that he had been made a present 01 it by the British Government! 1 (2) The revenue from the island of Sir A dollars, was also assigned to Salim.—I would rather say ' expected to bring in' than ' said to amount to.' (3) aon of the British Consular Agent —Residency Agent, not Consular Agent. (4) The rent was paid regularly and —Rent was admittedly received by Shaikh Salim whom Shaikh Sagar allowed to keep whatever revenue came in from the Island. (5) This share was y on the 10th October Samaiyeh Brotvn, a British subject.—On 10th October 1907. That is eight months after the cancellation of the concession. [It will be'shown later on (item 69) that Hasan by his own admission had no right to sell this share.] (6) 2,000 to 5,000 tons of red oxide wer for four years from the mines on Abu Musa. another party to deliver 400 tons a year for —This is a misleading representation of the facts. Except for a quantity of 2,000 tons which Hasan had already contracted to supply to another party, at the rate of 400 tons per annum, Wonckhaus acquired an absolute monopoly of the output for four years and a preferential right to renew at the end of it. (7) The ostensible ground for this step ha that the contract for delivery of red oxide Wonckham his sanction. —It was both his interests and those of Isa bin Abdul Latif which formed the ' ostensible ground' for Shaikh Sagar's action (see also item' 7 of British Memorandum). The Shaikh gave his own reasons for withdrawing the concession; they were, that Hasan had given a monopoly which he had no authority to do and had thus made it evident to the Shaikh that his own rights over Abu Musa might be endangered by the continuance of the concession in such unsafe hands. He in fact realized that Hasan was actim&gt; in a way calculated to prejudice his interests, and in his later letter of 26th March to Hasan (Annex 16 of First German Memorandum) in reply to Hasan's protests he explained himself furthe^ He said he had concurred in the original concession because all the parties were British subjects and thus every one concerned was under his own control or that of the British Government; but he objected to the admission into, the concern of the subjects of a foreign power over whom he would have no control He feared that the mines might go out of his posses sion; and it is clear that the apprehension was not altogether an empty one for in their letter to the Sh ikh, dated 13th October 1907, Messrs. Wonckhaus wrote • ^ v\ e have paid to them (Hasan, etc.) very considerable advances * * * and we consider that the oxide lying on the seashore is our property the mines and the concession are security Again when Messrs. Wonckhaus's employe, Brown, attempted to land at Abu Musa on 22nd October 1907 with Haji Ali Tashankar and a number of men from Lingah and was prevented by the resolute attitude of the Sh; ikh s guards, he was reported by Lieutenant Gabriel to have had with him a German flag which he intended to erect4 at the oxide mine or over the accumulated mineral. Lastly when Dr. Listemann, Consul for Germany at Bushire, addressed Shaikh Sagar direct on 19th November 1907, protesting at his action, he wrote that Messrs. VVonckhaus having purchased a share in the Mining Company now had a ' Madkhal' (means of entry) directly into the working of the mines. Messrs. Wonckhaus's claims and action were obviously calculated to bring the Shaikh up against the provisions of the Treaty of March 6, 1892, with the British Government. (See also item 68.) The grounds of complaint advanced by Isa bin Abdul Latif were, briefly, (?) the grant by Hasan of a monopoly which he had no authority to grant; (n) Hasan's failure/ to consult his partners, the fact of Hasan signing himself as 'owner and holder' of the concession. (8) Shaikh Sagar on, Srd October 190 work cease. —The words ' and that he should remove his coolies and gear within 10 days might be added. (9) Thereupon about 20th October* —' After 20th October' the words ' Hasan having taken no notice of his warning ' might suitably be inserted. (40) The boats containing the Shaikh's arm Mum hy the] British warship Lapwing.—The reasons which made it expedient that one ofl His Maiesty's ships and a representative of the Residency should be presenV- Were explained in count 4 of the British Memorandum, but also item (1) above. (11) T'wo employes of the firm of Robert Company * were received with bullets by the Shaikh's arme hack, —The said employes had no business to be where they were. It was only after they had persistently ignored repeated shouts of warning that some shots were fired over their heads. Mr. Brown, who was also one of the parties, is a British subject, and would doubtless have complained to the Residency if he had thought he had any legitimate ground for so doing. He has never done so. Position- of Shaikh Sagar with resfect to th view of priv It is stated in the British Memorandum * * * the representative of Sagar and while he acted latter s' that Shaikh Salim concluded the lease agreeme —What the British Memorandum said was : '' Salim declares that in granting the lease of 1898, he merely acted as proxy for the ruling Shaikh, then absent on pilgrimage to Mecca * *' * It thus appears that Balim did not conclude the lease of 1898 in the capacity of owner, but in that of regent * * * '' Salim himself wrote : ' c When I leased the mines of Abu Musa I was offi ciating on your behalf and the concession was given by proxy for you ; and I was well aware that on your return from the pilgrimage to Mecca, if you considered my action in the matter of the concession was good, you would confirm what I had agreed to, and if in your opinion it was objectionable you could annul it. either at the time, or at any other time.' It will be seen later on in these papers that the grant in some capacity by Shaikh Salim in December 1898 of a concession for exploiting 'Mica' in Abu Musa, has to be admitted. (It was never reported to the Residency and came to nothing.) At the time of its grant Shaikh Sagar had returned froni his pilgrim age and states that he was consulted by Shaikh Salim and approved of the grant. But he—Shaikh Sagar—being present, we cannot maintain in this case that the concession was granted by Shaikh Salim as regent. The natural explanation is this. Shaikh Salim admittedly was allowed to reside in the island as tenant and enjoy the produce, subject always to his own loyal behaviour and to the will and pleasure of Shaikh Sagar. In the case of the oxide concession the posi tion would be that Salim gave the concession after obtaining the concurrence of himself as regent and subject to Shaikh Sagar s confirmation. In the case of '' Mica ' 5 concession he gave it after consulting Shaikh Sagar who was himself present., As Regards Shaikh Sagai^s letter of 11th October 1902 to the British Resi- den i. jIib Statement tnat balim granted the concession *' as regent would still SiAiid bO -r.j as it went, and the motive of its assertion is quite an intelligent one and quite different to the far-fetched one that the German Eeioinder seeks t0 u fc ' .1 m y say I ! \ a or,-. being llnder t}ie mistaken belief 'that he was prohibited by the Treaty of 1892 from entering into such transaction with any one^but a Bxitish subject, and Nakhoda AH being a Persian subject, he waa anxious to persuade Colonel Kemball that Nakhoda Ali was not a ' concession- aire at all and that if there had been any fault it was Salim's and not his. The only basis tor this, view is a garbled ^ version of a remark said to have been dropped uy shaikh oagar, and there is no real foundation for the hypothesis at To go back to the letter itself and Colonel Kemball's letter to which it is a reply. I would explain that business with the Trucial Chiefs Is carried on almost, entirely through the Residency Agent. Direct letters between the Resident and the Shaikhs are of comparatively rare occurrence, and when they are neces sary the Resident's letters are always sent to the Agent under flying seal (or accompanied by a copy for the Agent's record) for delivery. Similarly the Shaikh s reply ao-dressed to the Resident direct is given to the Agent to close and forward. No Shaikh 'would think of answering a letter of the nature of this one (Colonel Kembali's) without consulting the Agent before replying. In this particular case too. Shaikh Sagar knew that the Agent himself was personally and financially interested and consulted him fully as to the terms in which he had best reply. In proof of this we have the fact the Sagar's letter, above quoted, is found to be written on the Agent's office paper bearing the Government of India watermark. It is obvious that unless Shaikh Sagar wanted to quarrel with Abdul Latif, the answer must be what the latter wanted and advised, and what Shaikh Sagar said to the Resident, in other words, was :— W hat you have heard about the Abn Musa oxide concession being in the hands of Nakhoda Ali, of whom I know you have a bad opinion, is not true ; the concessionaires are three of your own people and I supposed your agent 'had given you the necessary details of it. In case you may notice that the conces sion was executed by Salim and not by me, I would explain that Salim granted it with full powers as regent for me, during my absence at Mecca, and it is still operative, and has my support, so I hope you. will not think it necessary to make any difficulties about it.' His object was not to disclaim responsibility at ail, but on the contrary to make it clear to Colonel Kemball that the concession was in order and had' bis own approval. As a matter of fact so far as we were concerned there was no ban whatever against Nakhoda Ali, gm Persian subject. The position at the time in this regard is set forth in item 26 following. (13) Sheikh Sagar increased this allowanchy cluding that derived from the red oxide min —This statement is correct. (14) Memorandum of Shaikh Sagar, is a clerical error. It should, of course, be 1908. (15) Attention must he called to an inacc Memo randum. —There is no such inaccuracy. What Shaikh Sagar stated was (Annex 5 of British Memorandum): ' £ I have absolutely not given any deed in connection with the island nor in regard to the mines thereof ; all 1 did was to relinquish the income to him. in the way of financial assistance * * *' There was no stipulation or mention that the income to bo left for Salim was to be restricted to that of the mines. This was obviously not the case because Shaikh Salim was also allowed to enjoy the fees for landing and storing muhar and zinni oyster-shells for export {vide Annex 5, British Memorandum)^ Also see Annex 1, British Memorandum, in which Salim writes : ' You were kind enough to place Abu Musa under my supervision, so that I misht cultivate therein and reap from it the means of subsistence.' C205FD6 The- position no doubt was that Skaildi bagai fPlrnqnis^.^. — J; ' ' revenue that miaht accrue from the island, so long as bahm no^- iiapo him for money and so long sis the income did not so . be more than Sagar'smterestsconid allow him to relinquish &lt;)i balim •^ UHl p A PV''' to receive, (See' also penultimate paragraph ot enclosure ti ox J irst ismisa Memorandum.) (16) The Imperial Government regret cbjectionable testimony the letter of Shaikh S 41e* ruary The reasons of the German, Goyernment tor this attitude are uhau the letter was written at the time the case was in progress and 'hat i,_Major Cox, was at Sliargah just at that time. Tliis is a very convenient way ot dispos ing of, a difficult piece of evidence, but this argument., I hope, can be resisted. Obviously tllere was no- reason for Salim to write,such a letter until he learnt of the way in which his name was being used and of. the ciaima on Abu Muba Island 'with which he was being credited. The argument of. the German Government in. regard to the objeGtibnability of .the evidence to this document would apply to a number of the annexes to their rejoinder. Although, they bear each other no affection at heart, une tw® ShaMshave been quite of one mind in regard to the behaviour of Hasan Samai- yeh and the expediency of withdrawing the concession and if it had not been withdrawn, by Shaikh Sagar it would 'have been withdrawn by Sh. ikh Salim„ In any case Shaikh Salim absolutely adheres to what he then wrote. -Hia own letter was read over, to him in the presence of. myself and the Besidency Agents of Lingeli and Shargah and he said he absolutely adhered to it4 (17.) The; Shaikh's-letters to the British the British Memoraniumjam no evidence.of. arguments used in support of this statement seem to be- a. good deal kboored. The position was clearly as stated under item 12 above. Shaikh Sagar had just'been created ruling Sh ikh by the voice of the tribe, who were tired of Shf.ikh Salim : Sagar was obviously in a very strong position and able to-turn Salim out of Abu Musa if he had a free hand*, but the IxiesiGieiit told him that itin doing so he broke the maritime truce he would'be suppressed, gh-aikh Sagar replied with a good deal of force ;; If you do not want us to: fight, please remove Salim from the island yourself: if you find it inconvenient to do that then leave us to settle the matter and do not call me to account if we^ fight. Atkaat&gt; if you will hot-let me proceed to extremities with him, make Mtn give a written undertaking, guaranteed by you,,that he will behave himself,, so that I need not bother about him.' I think any-cmfe reeding Sh:.ikh Sagar- 5 s letters under reference would regard them, especially: that of February 14, 1884, as not only having in mind the need to preserve the maritime truce and put an end to the political conflict,, but also as intended to form a specific assertion of his right of ownership as ruling Shaikh, and so to safeguard himself against any prejudice to that right which might otherwise result from the Resident's sterilizing action. (18) Jbu Musa is our island and a de We it to offers. —I gather from the observations made under this head and from the italicising of the word ' our that from the fact that the transaction quotes Shaikh Sagar as using the plural pronoun in reference to himself, it is sought to deduce, that Shaikh Sagar was not referring to himself but meant ' we,' i..e., 44 the Jowasim S5 , and only intended to claim that Abu Musa belonged politically to the territory of Shargah or the Jowasim. Whether or not this was the case cannot at all events be determined from the use or misuse of the pro noun. Generally when Writing formal letters these Shaikhs use the plural pro noun in reference to themselves. In this instance I find, on reference to the original, that it is the translator of 1884 who is responsible for the use of both forms in the one translation. In the. original Arabic the plural pronoun is used throughout both letters. With reference to the German arguments on this point. It is to be noted, that when Sagar uses the plural pronoun they argue that by doing so he intended7 to show that lie was not referring to bimself, but to the Shargah State or the Jowasuri i ^ v- hen uses it {vide page 6 of English version of German Rejoinder) ana speaks of 'our island ' they say he meantmy island 't I grant that there is no significance in the use, either way, and that both Snaikhs probauiy meant our ' (Jowasim) island, vested in the ruling Shaikh. ixQP Tke coMeMim i» evidently that Salim Jmd no right whatever to AbuMusa and if he aid live there it was on hmdrms : this is the contention. No right except what he derived from the ruling Shaikh ana enjoyed subject to his pleasure and Salitn's own loyalty. (20) Those letters then having nothing to do with the question of 'private owner* snvp. 1 am incunea to agree. According to my view there is, and can be, no private ownership of the island. Salim might conceivably own property on it, but if he did, he could have title deeds for that property. The facts are that wnen ralmg Shailch he built a house and planted some' date-trees. When he ceased to be ruling Shaikh he ceased to own these except by his successor's javour. If Shaikh Sagar evicted him from Abu Musa he might choose to recom* pens© Salim for his expenditure and trouble while tenantiog the island, or ho might not (see Annex I and item 28). The letter, oo y which Shaikh on 11th October 1902 (Annex 7 close examination to have a very different British Memorandum, In order to understa to Mow thejmporl of KembaU 's enquiry * * * 'printed in the Metnomndum.-—Colonel KembaB's letter (No. 75 of 10th March 1902) ran. as follows :— ' A report has reached me that you wish to grant a concession to Haj° Hakhoda All Ahmed S'aleh for excavating and exporting red oxide from the island of Sir Bu Nuair. I have therefore the honour to inform vou that it would be advisable for you wlet me see the draft of the concession before coneMns? tJie srrangemeirt, 0 ...' 1 shall' also be gald if you will let me see a copy of the concessioa granted to HajiNakhoda Ah for working the red oxide mines on the island' of Abu Muga.' 1 would remark in the first instance,, for the information' of Government^ that BajiNakhoda Ali being a Persian subject, and a rascal,, the allegedlease ©I oxide mines to nim would appear to fee a matter deserving more Attention than was given to it at the time it was reported (1898); but it was reported very casually at tne time Dy the Residency Agent and in any case Colonel Kembaii was not Resident then and it was no responsibility of his, and he naturally spoke of the matter as a fait when addressing the above letter to Shaikh Sagar. The pointed suggestion in the German reply that we had reason for not pro- dtrcing the letter, inclines me to suppose that'they have seen it. This is quite possible. At the time the letter was written there was no German element con- neoted with the concession, and Shaikhs Sagar and Salim, Abdul Latif, and Hasan Samaxyeh, were ali in each other's confidence, and the Resident's enquiry and Shaikh Sagar's reply would have been of interest to and probably discussed by all of them. I am not sure of the reason which prompted Government not to produce this document, but I should presume it to be this : Nakhoda Ali Was a Persian buI &gt; ject^ but no objection was then raised by the Residency on that ground to his participation. The Germans might argue that if Shaikh Sagar had in 1898 granted a concession to » foreign subject, and we had not objected for four treat® why should Shaikh Sagar object, as he now has, or we, to the entry of Wonekhaus into the concern. As a matter of fact Cblonel Kemball was mistaken. Nakhoda Ali was not a sharer in the original concession ; his name was dropped for a specific reason. As a fraudulent bankrupt he was a disreputable person and incidentally, over whom neither the Shaikh nor Government had any ultimate control, i do not o /—/8 quite see what we have to lose by producing this letter, seeing that the position then was as explained in item 26. (22) Colonel Kemhall certainly seems i.e.) Salim, as the owner of the mines in question. —Colonel Kemball was not Resident then, but Colonel Meade. The entry is obviously a very sketchy one. He does not even know then precisely what mines are referred to, but merely mentions the report and says enquiries will be made later. These were apparently over looked, vide item 21 (above). ^23) * * * * And — (also see footnote to this sentence in German case).—I think the mterpreta- / tion placed by me on this in (17) above is the right one.

When ashed hy the Dragoman of on the28th November 191)7' what harm is German firm 1' Shaikh Sagar replied ' we English which prevent us from leasing any part of our te svhiccts —The accuracy of the above quotation can be impugned, wde my letter No.' 170, dated 12th January 1908, to the Government of India in which I gave Shaikh Sagar's version of what passed and drew attention to the fact that tne German Dragoman did not know Arabic and that the interpreter was Abduila bin Hasan Samaiyeh, one of the defendants in the dispute whose character is of the shadiest and whose'motive in putting words into Shaikh Sagar s mouth is obvious. The then German Dragoman, Mirza Husam, was also a person oi noto riously evil repute who cannot be regarded as a trustworthy witness. He has since been exposed and dismissed from employment in the German Consulate. All the arguments under this count are thus based on an incorrect quota tion. (26) This interpretation is evidently e which would he incompatible with the open —It may be a matter oi opinion whether the theory, that Article 3 of the Treaty of 6th March 1892 preclxiaes ti.o grant of a minin g concession to a foreigner, is compatible with the principle Oi the open door, but that question hardly arises here, because at the time wiien Shaikh Sagar addressed his letter of 11th October 1902 to Colonel Kemball the omy warning he had received on the subject was that contained in ioiocei Meade's letter to the Residency Agent, Shargah, dated 17th February 1900, m which the former wrote :■— '' You should inform the Trucial Chiefs separately that the Resident would be ready to help them with advice in respect to any proposals made to them for trading privileges, such as mining concessions, etc. In doing so you would, of course, make it clear to the chiefs that the Resident has bo desire to iriterieio, but it would be to their advantage to obtain advice before concluding arrange ments for monopolies and exclusive privileges, thereby protecting themselves against unscrupulous traders.' The whole object of this advice was to protect these unsophisticated Shaikhs against oil unscrupulous persons anxious to exploit their ignorance, whether British or Foleign, by urging them always to consult the Residency before entertaining applications for concessions. It is true that later on {vide Foreign Department No. 3177-E.B.. dated 27th August 1907) I was instructed to '' warn the Trucial Chiefs that the grant of a concession of any sort to mine or otherwise exploit any portion of their territory is considered to fall within the scope of this clause,' but with the approval of the Government of India, the Shaikhs were not formally notified to that effect for the time being and action, pending the settlement of this case, was limited to a reminder to the Shaikhs by the Residency Agent not to entertain applications from outsiders for mining rights without consulting the Residency. For expla nation of Shaikh Sagar's letter see under item 12. (27) A little over that amount.— word ' little' has been interpolated. Jn the Arabic it is ' wa ziyadeh,' i .e., ' and oyer ' or and more,'\~L 9 (28) Now if the revenue of an island was to Salim not have been natural to give him that of Musa ?—The status of bir Abu Nuair and Abu Musa islands in relation to the Ruling Shaikh of Shargah were precisely the same. The simple reason why Shaikh Sagar did not at that time intimate the grant of the revenue of Abu Musa to Salim in lieu 01 a cash payment, was that that island then brought in no specific revenue. The fact was that the interest which Salim had taken in the place as Ruling Chief Annex 1) and the money he spent in endeavouring to cultivate it had all come to nothing, by reason of the failure of the water-supply. Thus address ing the Resident on 9th Zilkhadeh 1297 (14th October 1880) the Residency Agent wrote that according to what he had heard from the Ruler of Shargah (then Shaikh Salim) regarding Abu.Musa—' Its water has altogether become salt and the trees have died away. He does not get anything from the place, not even a gaz (small copper coin) So the reason why the income of Abu Musa was not mentioned is obvious (see also item 35). (29) Salim has always exerSeised th — These petty potentates of the Gulf littoral do not concern themselves with abstract attributes of sovereignty, and in tracts where no postal or telegraphic com munications exist and effective administrative control, according to our ideas, is lacking, practice is necessarily conflicting with theory. The right to jetsam and flotsam is exercised on the basis of ' might is right. ' The local inhabitants exact it when they can, and the Shaikh of the principality levies or foregoes his royalty as his inclination and ability may dictate. Abundant testimony to this effect is forthcoming. The cases connected with the island of Abu Musa quoted in the German argu ment were never reported to the Residency, as an amicable solution was arrived at locally. I have no reason to doubt the facts, but may mention in connection with the first case quoted, and German Annex No. 6, that Salim was at that time acting as Regent, so that he might have been writing as Ruling Shaikh. He admittedly shared the proceeds of wreckage with the inhabitants of the island for the time being, migrants from the Shargah suburb of Khan for the most part and thus full subjects of the Ruling Shaikh of Shargah, but he exercised this right in virtue of the dispensation from Sagar which permitted him to enjoy the produce of the island, vide Shaikh Sagar's statement in Annex 2. As far as the Resi dency is concerned we have always, as a matter of course, recognized the posi tion of the Ruling Shaikh in the matter. Thus, on the 17th May 1894, the Residency Agent, Shargah, reported the wreck of a Bahrain boat on Abu Musa and its detention by the inhabitants thereof, pending payment of half the value (Annex 3). It will be seen that it was ' the Shaikh of 'Shargah ' that the Chief of Bahrain proceeded to entreat, and the Sheikh of Shargah J ' whom the Residency recognized (Annexes 4 and 5), Again in the case of the stranding of the British India Steam Naviga tion Company's S. S. Bulimba on the island (Annex 6) it is dearly the ' Shaikh of Shargah ' whose position and responsibility were recognized. As a matter of fact, under Article 4 of the Treaty of the 6th February l-fOG with Shaikh Sultan bin Sagar, father of Salim, and grandfather of Sagar, the Jowasim are not entitled to exercise their right in the case of British craft, but in practice the incident has usually happened and has been adjusted by local understanding before any news oMt has transpired. On the general question of the incidence of the right, and the position and practice in regard thereto, I offer the following evidence :— [i) Copy of a letter, dated 1st March 1905, addressed by me to the Assis tant Resident, Bunder Abbas, in'reply to an enquiry on the subject (Annex 7).

It will be remarked that the draft was written by Abdullah bin Hasan, Samaiyeh. It was all very well for Abdullah cunningly to put such words into Shaikh Salim's mouth, but Salim laiew well enough that be was not in a position to make such a pronouncement and the draft was ,rejected specifically on that account. Directly Abdul Latif saw it, he said that it would not. do and wrote out an amended draft omitting the objectionable words. Until J showed it to him a few weeks ago, Shaikh Sagar had never seen or heard of it. The cautious Abdul Latif also realized that the; admission of Nakhoda Ali into the original, agreement with the Shaikh, which would have to be,reported to the Residency, was inexpedient as he had a bad reputation and was disapproved of by the Residency, and his inclusion would probably be objected to. His name was, therefore, omitted from the original agreement, and it was decided to bring him in on a subsidiary agreement between the partners (It is very evident from all that has transpired how very much these two ignorant Arab Shaikhs were in the hands of the more sophisticated people with whom they were deal/ing and how very necessary it is for us to look after, their interests in such matters). ♦These are the more important.{31) Inthe document of 19th August 1898 * . . expressly undertakes to 'pay due. This is absolutely inconsistent with balmily tye fetti of the mdde mines and a right to the enjoyment in his own name Abu Musa , and that he could exercise this — lo has not been wntended that Sliaikli Sagar granted only the rent of the oxide mines (see item 15). It was perfectly Jjaturai for Shaikh Sagar, entering this commercial concern as a private individual, on the same terms as the others, to share the payment of the ground rent. He would naturally have been debited with this share even if he had been taking the rent himself. Shaikh Salim only enjoyed the produce adversely to the private individual Sagar and subject to Shaikh Sagar's pleasure as ruling Chief and to specific conditions also items 32 and 37). (32) On 26th December 1898 * * * * * * * leased all the deposits of mica on Abu M —Regarding this mica concession, see Shaikh Sagar's observations (Annex 2). (I may mention, for the informa tion of Government, that the Residency Agent, Abdul Latif, made no report whatever of it, either at the time of its execution or at any other time'; and during , the progress of, and discussions regarding, this case he can only be regarded as having designedly suppressed all mention of it. His excuse that the project fizzled out and that he consequently did not think it worth reporting, cannot be taken seriously.) So far as Shtikh Sagar is concerned I have no doubt that the concession never having been taken tip, and a decade having elapsed since it died a natural death, he had really forgotten all about it in 1908. This is not at all surprising with such reckless people as these Shaikhs, who keep no records and live in the present. I believe the history of the so-called ' mica ' project is this. The captain of one of Messrs. Strick's steamers which took a consignment of oxide from Abu Muf a, mistook some thin strata of gypsum, which is common on the island, for mica; told the oxide concessionaires that it was valuable and advised them to get a contract for it. It proved not to be mica. I think we Should rely in regard to this item, oil the fines given in Shaikh Sagar's explanation, namely, 'that he was fully consulted and accorded his concurrence ; he having admittedly allowed Shaikh Salim conditionally and within reasonable limits, to enjoy the pro duce of the island, and being glad that he should derive sufficient therefrom to allow him no excuse for importuning his nephew for money. (33) On 6th January 1899 {23rd Shaaban Samaiyeh the draft of a memorandum of Ass oxide and 'the mica mines.' —Th^MemoraDdum of Association as given in Annex 14 of the German Eejoinder is not the one which accompanied Abdul Latifs letter of 23rd Shaaban 1316 to Hasan Samaiyeh, but a modified version which Abdul Latif never accepted. It will be noted that no signatures are given on the Annex in question, for the reason that the document was never signed up, and the Memorandum was never accepted nor became operative. For further details on the subject of this Memorandum of Association, see Abdul LatifV statement (Annex 12) and item 50 of this report. All the original documents are in my possession. (34) In the document relative to the mica importance to the effect that the lessees and trees hut no other trees. This provision island as o^if'.-rrThe. Keshk^shuh is a desert shrub used for burning. Fire wood is a great difficulty on these barren islands, and if no express stipulation had been made there would have been a danger of the concessionaries' coolies indenting on the date palms of other f arden trees which Salim had tried to grow. This stipulation is no evidence that S ^lim disposed of the island as owner. He was admiitedly the tenant and settler and was allowed to enjoy the produce as long as he was allowed to occupy that position.12 (35) Another document which is of impo of ownership * * * is the letter addressed hy the British A.yent,A}}du&gt;, hctuf, to Hasan Samaiyeh on the 12th November Abdul Latif a dispute has arisen betweenSalim and Sah The explanation of the dispute regarding Sir is a very simple one and disposes of all the arguments which the German Memorandum basis on it. Abdul Latif's note on the subject (Annex 13) explains the positon fully and his explanation is corroborated by papers already filed with the case and is also confirmed by our records. Abdul Latif had no hesitation about Abu Musa, because Sagar had admittedly, in connection with the oxide concession, allowed Salim to enjoy what income he could get out of the island, but in the case of Sir there was no longer such an arrangement. The agreement of 1884 had been revised; and another agreement (1889) executed, in which mention of Sir had been eliminated. So until the two Shaikhs came to an understandng nothing could be done. In effect Salim said to Sagar: ' You gave me the revenue of Sir, because it was supposed to bring in $ 200, but you never made it up to me when it did not; now that there is some chance of getting some income from it you won't let me have it.' Sagar replied to Salim : ' The agreement (1884) under which I let you have the produce of Sir lapsed, and in the existing instrument between us the income of that island is no longer included; meanwhile I have since resigned to you the income of Abu Musa which is quite enough for you, and I am no t prepared to give you that of Sir as well. (36) * * * Three residents Lingah their certain knowledge Abu Musa has always Salim. —The three residents referred to are :— {i) Abdul Muhsin ibn Ahmed al Mushari. (u) Abdarrahman ibn Muhammad ibn Mazim, {Hi) Haind ibn Khalifa al Uyuni. They are all persons whose opinions would not be of the slightest weight on this point, even if they were bond fide, but they are all objectionable witnesses. (i) is a petty trader, associated with Hasan Samaiyeh in pearl dealings. His opinion is of no value whatever in regard to the question under reference (see r.lso Annex 14). (ii) formerly French Agent, dismissed from his post as unfit. Has been frequently subject of complaint from Residency in the past and is so at the present time, on account of his still trying to run a under the French flag to which he has no right (see also Annexes 14 and 15). (m) was a petty merchant always in a state of bankruptcy and receiving help from Hasan Samaiyeh. He recently died insolvent (see also Annex 14). In refutation of the above, I produce statements (Annexes 8, 9, and 10) to an entirely contrary effect from various and important Arab Shaikhs of the littoral, most of them of the sam6 stock as the Chiefs of the Trucial Coast. They belong to the category of maritime Arabs who up to comparatively recent years possessed and ruled the littoral on both shores of the Gulf. Their whole history has been bound up with the coast and islands of the Gulf, and their views must necessarily be of the greatest weight. It will be seen that they are unanimous in the opinion that Abu Musa Island is the property of the Ruling Chief of Shargah. (37) * * h cannot he question o 1 the reigning Shaikh and even as of the usufruct just like an owner et sequitur.—It is admitted that as tenant he enjoyed the usufruct subject to the consent of the reigning Shaikh, but not ' as against 'the latter, except qua private individual and in so far as13 Sagar as Ruling bnaikh consented. We concede that in tliecase of the mica con cession balim was not acting as Regent, but was then acting in consultation with fcagar and with his concurrence. 1.1 4. ^ Ka ^ ar owner of the. oxide mines, ' but iiiaf the Killing bhaikh ot Shargah owns them, and Sakar occupies that position at present, (bee items 31 and 32). (38). Sakar had no right from the point of view of private law to terminate the agreement of Us own motion '.—In this matter the Ruling Shaikh is a law unto liimseli.^ Vy hen iie cancelled the concession he was dealing with persons sub ject to no jurisdiction, but his own, and that of the British Government, and was entitled vO ai/t as he pleased to the extent to which the latter Government chose to acquiesce as regards their subjects. The British Government considered his action war ranted under the circumstances and declined to intervene in behalf of their subject, (39). The lessees, and especially Abdul Latif, therefore wished to secure it {the con cession) for as long as possible; accordingly the stipulation of a definite term of years vms omitted in the second agreement. —In view of the terms of the first and rejected agreement it is difficult to maintain the arguments adopted in Clause 2 of our first Memorandum of July 10th, 1908, or avoid the conclusion that the omission ^ specified period, was made by concessionaires in their own interests &lt; slaving regard to the fact tnat Abdul Latif drafted the agreement in its nnal form and that the right of the concessionaires to use the mines as long as they -wished., was provided for in l&gt;oth versions, it can hardly be said that the time-limit was omitted in the second instrument simply to safeguard the lessor's interests. I think the best line for us to take on this point is that it is difficult to gauge the exact motive which prompted the omission, but if it was the one suggested by the German Memorandum, and if the oxide business was then, as they say, considered very profitable, and if it was intended by the lessee to bind the lessors permanently, in return for a nominal rent of £20 per annum, then there was obviously all the more reason for Sagar to put his foot down and cancel t^e concession and for us to support him in so doing. In omitting this time-limit, the astute concessionaires thoroughly over-reach ed i uem.sej.ves, for it is clear that the abundant testimony of Mullahs and merchants now forthcoming, that even if the lease were not revocable on any other grounds, it was rendered invalid, both in clerical and mercantile law, on account of this very omission, of any time-limit. For the rest, the mere fact that Concession No, 1 was rejected, snows that the irrevocability claimed was at any rate only compara tive and not absolute. (40) The question whether assuming that the lease agreement because the lessee has begu appear sufficient to him, Sakar, is one tha seriously.—This was a reason or a part reason suggested by His Majesty's Government 'and not given by the Shaikh himself, but it is a very natural one. He and Shaikh Salim kn^w no more about the oxide prospects when the concession was granted, than they did about the mica. They were simply exploited by 3 more astute busi ness men. As soon as they came to realize that they had been ' done the' wanted to upset the arrangement. ' ' (41/ On the question of the tcnnmation the oeen obtained from the leading merchants Bussorah important clergy of Lingah, Shargah and Debai 24).—I append a separate note (Annex 14) regarding the identity of the merchants and clergv mentioned m the German Rejoinder, from which it will be seen that the merchants quoted are by no means leading merchants, and that there are good grounds for regarding their testimony with suspicion ; while the clergy are certainlv not the 'most important 5&gt; nor compare in repute with some of those whos^ opinions 1 now produce. (42)^ All the opinions come practically to * * * commercial law the lease agreement is valid ; —As I have mentioned above the commercial evidence given in the German rejoinder is in my14 opinion impugnable, and in any case entitled to no weiglit. Tlie German Firm nave evidently had recourse to, or introduced to their Consul, not ' leading merchants as they suggest or persons whose opinions are of any value, but just a particular clique of individuals in Lingah, who are notoriously hostile to British interests and influence. In refutation of this evidence, I bring forward the opinions of 11 representa.^ tive merchants (Annexes 17 and 18), from different parts of the littoral, all of whom express the view that the lease is invalid according to the Commercial Law of Islam, because it lacks both specification of period and is devoid of any record of the pronunciation of the proposal and acceptance formulae considered to be a necessary feature of such documents. {^) According to religious law the lease agreement is ivmdid* * *.• son who discovers or works the mines thereby acq * * *. HasanSamaiyeh or the Company of Le right to them. —I submit a quantity of weighty testimony from numerous members of the clergy, including the chief priests of Lingah and Bushire, both Sunni and Shiah (Annexes 19 to 23). They were unanimous in the opinion that the lease agreement is invalid for several specific reasons, {i) Non-pronunciation, and record of the usual formula of proposal and acceptance ; {ii) Non-specification of period ; (iii) Non-specification of the amount of profit to be derived by the lessee. It will be seen that two separate questions were put to the clergy { Annexes 19. 81 and 23).- In the first place : (A). As to the validity of the document according to Shara Law ; Then afterwards, the invalidity of the document having been admitted, (B) (i) (B) (ii). As to the right of the less/e'r to cancel it and eject the lessee, and resume the control of his property. The concensus of these opinions entirely supports the view that the lease was invalid and that the lessor of the property is entitled to cancel the lease and resume his property. I would especially point to the opinions recorded by Abdarrahman bin Abdul Ghafoor El Mufti, who has a very high reputation among'the inhabitants of the littoral and islands. As regards the clerical contention, relied on in the German rejoinder, that in Islam mines are the common property of all Muhammadans, and that anybody who works them has thereby acquired an indefeasible right to them. The clergv of Islam may continue in the abstract to cherish this ancient and chimerical tenet, which had its origin in the interested aim of the Muhammadanl|#archv to keep matters concerning mines and the exploitation of minerals in tfieir ow'n control, but no one can pay serious attention to such an exploded claim at the present day, much less contemplate giving effect Co it in practice. It seems waste of time to discuss it. The conclusion to be drawn from the opinions now produced is that the lease was bad in law, whether commercial or religious; that Shaikh Sagar or Shaikh Salim (they were both of one mind, so it matters not which) had the right to cancel it and eject the lessees ; and that it ceased to be operative from the moment it was cancelled. I may record the personal view that the cancellation by a* Ruling Shaikh of a concession granted to British subjects is not a matter which we should allowtobedecidedby a round robin of recorded views, either of merchants or clergy, and that I regard both as mere padding. As, however, the German claimants have had resource to it, we produce similar stuff in refutation, (44) The sale to foreigners is not a b —No. It was not suggested that the sale of oxide to foreigners was a breach of the agreement, but the grant of a monopoly to a person, not under the control of the Shaikh or ourselves, was, in the opinion of the Shaikh, a breach of the -anderkandina on which the concession was granted.

The point is an important one, and it is very necessary for us to maintain our present attitude in regard to it. The actual document was executed at Shargah and the partial reason for the inclusion of Esa bin Abdul Latif in the concession was in order that one of the concessionaires might reside at his headquarters and so be in touch with the Shaikh, lij is a pnre accident that the Samaiyehs, who are of Bahrain origin hanpen to aye at Lmgah. They might equally well be residing r,t Bahrain or Koweit. Abu Musa appertains not to Lingah or Persia, but to the Trucial Coast and to the jurisdiction of the British representative at Bushire in his capacity of political omcer accredited by the Government of India to the Shaikhs and principalities of the Arab Coast and islands of the Gulf. As I urged in my note of February 12th, 1910, as long as we deal with the mat ter as one concerning the Government of India's Residency jurisdiction we are m a much stronger position to lay down what the Shaikh, who is a law unto himself can do and can be permitted to do. I may mention that in the case of a current claim on the part.of Hasan Samaiyeh for compensation for loss of war alleged to have disappeared from Abu Musa,-1 was careful, when holding the enquiry, to take a™ Pfrt-ies over to Abu Musa and make the investigation there in the presence ot the yhoifccx bhargan s representative. m It'stm remains to consider tM further cancelung of the _ leaps agreement and witlidr admismHe.-~^]xiB is a question concerning the Shaikh and the British authorities oiiiy. me l&gt;rjtish aovernment hold that the Shaikii's action was fully iustified by the circumstances. The Shaikh and the Government of India were prevented xrom going iurtner and making any adjustment between the three concessionaires inter se by tne lu-advisea aqion of two of them in attempting to drag in the German firm and Government. W hen the matter is allowed to take its natural course it may be possible to regulate matters as between the concessionaires. The legality of Hasan s action was a matter for the Shaikh and the Govern ment of India to decide. If Messrs, Wonckhaus' commercial interests were preju diced by Hasan s action, it was for him to seek commercial relief in the usual way16 This argument has all been stated before, and it seems superfluous for me to go over the ground again. (49)** The (British) memorandum starts f rom, the assumption that Hasan Sam- aiyeh's proceedings were culpable. —Yes this is so. The German quotation, vv ic follows, of the argutnent of the British memorandum is not quite a correct one. The argument of the British memorandum was that ^ there is nothing m the docu ments in possession of His Majesty 's Government to indicate that Hasan bamaiyela occupied the post of the managing partner and that there was every reason to be lieve that in any case any authority he had did not extend to tne grant ox su^n a contract as this (which tied the hands of the Company for an inaefimte penou; without first consulting the partners. (50) The Imperial Government, however, maintain that the partners did, as a matter of fact, sanction the agreement between Hasan Samaiyeh and If onckJiaus, hut this sanc tion was not really necessary as Hasan Samaiyeh is the manager of the Company.— Jur reply to this has been (i) that Hasan is proved to have deliberately misled the part~ ners as to the nature of the contract and withheld the text from them, and (u) that their sanction was necessary, Hasan bad nothing else to work on by way of authority than the conojtion laid down in the document admitting Nakhoda Ali to partnership (Enclosure i to Jnrst German Memorandum). It is shown in item 33, that the ivlemorahduin ot A sd O - ciation (Annex 14 of Gexman rejoinder), was never signed up and never be came operative, and that the concern was being workeo. on the conditions prescribed in Enclosure 2 above mentioned. Furthermore, it will be noted that Hasan Samaiyeh never attempted to contend that he was under no obligation to consult the partners, but that he had consulted them and that they had approved—the fact being that when communicating wita them he had deliberately withheld the text and the important feature, in tne contract to which he knew perfectly well they would object. His lettei^to ileje^ (Annexes 24 to 27) show clearly that on ordinary occasions ue did feel under uhe obligation to consult the partners, and that Nejef demurred to his failure to do so in this case. It is disputed that Nejef was a ** This was connected with personal services and, therefore ewd—TMs conclusion is not demonstrated by the documents quoted. The subsidiary deed admitting ISiakhoda Ali as a partner in expenditure and profits of the Company makes no such suggestion, but on the contrary clearly places Nakhoda Ali (among the partners inter in precisely the same position as his fellows. Nor can the question, or rather the answer, be begged from the dis- ino-enuous querv and suggestion made in Aboul lj&lt;yif s letter to xlasan oi i^'lrd June 1905 (German Annex 32). Abdul Latif himself states that Hasan's reply to that letter indicated that they did recognise Nejef and that he therefore dropped the suggestion. (52) This view {thai Nejef was not a partner) dullah and the former energetically denied to t Bmavre had ever recognised Nejef as a partner.—1 have a considerable number ot letters from Hasan and Abdullah to Nejef, of which I submit a selection (Annexes 24 to .30), which give the lie to the above denial and conclusively show that they both recog nised Nejef as having donned his father's mantle, as a partner in the Company. (53)**He (Nejej) said to Abdullah, son of Draqoman of the Imperial Vice-Consulate at Bushire, that aareement withWonchhaus, (vide also the note to this passage).—Eeliance can neither be placed on the statements of Abdullah bin Hasan nor on those of the then Dragoman of the Imperial German Vice-Consulate (since dismissed). As regards the declaration of the British subject Brown that Nejef expressed aim-oval of the contract and offered to sell his share, this being a retraction of what he stated in his petition to Lieutenant Gabriel on 16th February 1908, I can oniyil say that the statemente which Mr. Brown understood him to make must he reaard- ea as having been retracted by the affidavit subseqaently recorded before Major Trevor (Annexes 31 and 32 ) . .It can hardly be doubted that, had he been soL ciined. Nejef would have been induced both to part with his share in the Company- and to give a written acqmesdence to the contract with Wonckliaus ; not that from our point of view either the one transaction or the other would have been of any value when obtained_ttionths after the concession had been cancelled.

It was for this reason, namely, that we had not seen his papers, that the British Memorandum only referred so brieflv to his connection with the concern. He has^since found the deed of partnership, and I now append a translation of it (Annex 33). It proves of considerable importance and shows that his positions like thao of Nakhoda Ali, was one of absolute equality among the partners (So) No douU Basan Barmiyeh ought not agreement was in German.—Mtet tnakm:* this casual observation the Germ&amp;d rejoinder goes on to endeavour to explain away or belittle Hasan SamaiyeVs tactics in concealing the text of the contract from the knowledge of his partners. TheV were demonstrated sufficiently clearly in the summary of Hasan's correfepondence submitted by me with the material for our first Memorandum on 1st March 19081 and under item 7 of that Memorandum. There can be no doubt of Hasan Samai' yeh's sustained endeavours, all through, to suppress the plain fact of the mono poly or so to gloze over it that it would hot be noticed. While the German argu ment here makes out that it was only Malcolm (as a possible rival in his capacity of Strick's Agent) whom Hasan wanted to keep in the dark, it would appear from Hasan's letter to Malcolm, dated October 14th 1906, that it was in reality Abdul Latif from whom he was auxious to conceal the terms of the contract, for he wrote to Malcolm :— ' In truth it is not my intention that any one should come to know about it except myself and you (Enclosure 14, British Memorandum.) The reasons for his perseveirence in withholding from Abdul Latif the precise terms of the contract were obvious. He had been repeatedly warned by Abdul Latif that, while there was no objection to the mere sale of the stuff to any body, he should not commit himself to any deed or formal contract without consulting him, and he (Hasan) knew «U enough that both the execution and the terms of the document in which he had bound himself would be objected to by Abdul Latif directly he saw them. To discount this opposition from Abdul Latif, his obvious course was to postpone the delivery of the copy and the objections of Abdul Latif aa long as possible, so that he could then plead that the contract had been in opera tion now to such an extent that it was impossible to go back on it. This is precise ly the line he took. Thus, writing to Malcolm on 9th May 1907, he said ; ' A long period has elapsed since I made the contract with the German, and I have been engaged in doing the work, oui 5 labourers have been working there and heavy ex penses have been incurred * ♦ * They did not make any objection all the time 'f That the execution of such an instrument was incompatible with Abdul liatif's repeated mjunctions and Hasan's own protestations is clearly demonstrated by the correspondence submitted on ist March 1908» Among the* latter I would €205 FD ' H /18 point to Hasan's letters of 30th January 1905 and July 1906, wmch die no form enclosures to the previous memorandum presented to the German Govern ment. v (56) He {Malcolm) further expressly : ' sure of hiqher price we shall not get the fanner Agre '—Mr. malcoim dxa not favour me with a copy of this letter, and the line oi^ argument or persuasion used therein is unfortunate, but it will be noted that it was written in yfMfcto Hasan's letter to him, dated 14th October 1906 (Enclosire ho. 14 of British Memorandum), and after Malcolm's communications to me on the subject of Hasan's intrigues with the German firm and his refusal to suppt. a copy of the Contract {vide his letters to me referred to in Item 54 above). 'Ihe object of the missive was simply to allay Hasan's suspicions and induce him to send a copy of the contract, and I suppose Mr. Malcolm worded it in the terms. most likely in his opinion to have the desired result. (57) When Malcolm later on received a copy about it and accordingly acquiesced %n it. —It will be seen from his letter to me ^ that he did not acquiesce, but by the time he got the copy (not till December) I had also then got one, and he was awaiting informal ad vice from me as to what action he should take. I could give him none, because he had not produced his deed, of part nership. I think we might say that Malcolm did protest to the Residency, both at the conclusion of the contract without his being consulted and at the refusal of Hasan to supply frbn with a copy,—but that being unable at the time to find his deed of partnership there was nothing on which he could base a formal complaint against Hasan. (55) .4s the correspondence shows Abdul —Neither Abdul Latif nor any one else had any objection to the mere sale of the stuff to Messrs. Wonckhaus. All Abdul Latif's expressions of approval were made in ignorance of the precise text and bearing of the contract and in the belief (a natural one after his repeated admonitions) that nothing more than a sale of the mineral had been agreed upon. (59) It is not till about four months later * * * l e g S to send him a co'py of ihe agreement. —For the simple reason that up to i.ow Abdul Latif had trusted to Hasan's good faith, but had now received news which aroused his apprehensions, namely, that Hasan had granted a monopoly and bound himself for a number of years. {60) He {Abdul Latif) gffijs on to say : ' than to do as he {the German) wishes ¥ * * * translates the passage in question as follows ' hotter than its acceptance —In the German Memoranda a great deal of argument has been based on the wording of this passage translated in the sense which they contend should be attributed to it. In support of their version they quote the opi nions, firstly of a young American Missionary of Busreh, and secondly of a German Professor of Berlin. Both opinions are theoretical and conjectural and do not profess to pay any regard to local usage. In refutation of them I bring forward— (i) A statement from Abdul Latif that what he meant was ' the annulment of this contract is better than its acceptance ' (Annex 34); {ii) Proof that Hasan Samaiyeh understood him in that sense, and requoted his words back to him, but more grammatically and unmistakably (Annex 34) ; (m) The opinion of the well-known Missionary, the Revd. S. M. Zwemer who has laboured for some 15 years among the Arabs of the Gulf and probably knows their local peculiarities of speech and writing better than any living man- He has no hesitation in saying that the meaning intended, and the natural interpretation to place upon the sentence is- ' The annulment of this contract is better than its acceptance ' (Aa- nex 35).This collective testimony disposes of the arguments which the Germans have hased on the forced mterpretation which they sought to place on the words. Th£ translation compliance with the German's wishes ' was quite a second thought. {Vide Enclosure 8 of 1st German Memorandum). {61) The fad* cited above show that Nejef* * * Abdul Latif declared their approval of the co contend that aiter seeing the text of the agteexnent none of them approved of it, such ap proval as was expressed having been induced by the deliberate suppression of facts by Hasan. {62) The Memorandum of Association for the partners.—-The answer to the arguments on this point is that the document quoted as Annex 14 of the German Rejoinder is not a completed document and bears bo signatures. It was not accepted by Abdul Latif and was never complet ed or signed up. It has nevel been seen by Shrikh Sagar. Malcolm or Nejef and has never been quoted or acted upon by any of the parties, and no accounts have ever been rendered by Hasan Ail Samaiyeh as would kve been required had it been operative. (Annexes 40 and 42). I append/sta^tement by Abdul Latif on the subject (Annex 12) and would also refer to the statement of Isa bin Abdul Latif, dated 17th Muharram 1326 (20th January 1908), forming an enclosure to my letter of 1st March 1908. Esa and Abdul Latif have never suggested that Hasan was not the managing part 1 - ner for the sale of the oxide ' with the knowledge of all But this deed, which granted a monopoly for a number of years to Wonckhaus, was a newand radical departure from the practice of the past; it was clearly a privi lege, which it was not within Hasan's competence to grant without consulting his partners, and by his tactics in endeavouring to keep the terms of the document se cret from his partners, Hasan showed that he knew very well that he had acted ultra vires, and that they would object as soon as they understood the effect of the document. , The ground for Esa's action .was {vid his letter of 20th February; 1907 to Shaikh Sagar) that ' Hasan Samaiyeh has no deed of authority from me, giving him any general power in regard to the action which he might take respecting the. lease, etc. ' Nor had he. His conduct of affairs, e.g his refusal to render any accounts, his inclination to ignore his partners and his readiness to buy up their shares, warrant the conjecture adumbrated by Nakhoda Ali (Annexes 36 to 39) that his ' aim was to tire out, or to buy out, the others, and get the concern, into his own hands. (63) * * He, Malcolm, cotild not do anything although he was a because an individ^l partner had no right * * * * ^ stated more distinctly that Hasan Samaiyeh —I attach a copv of an affidavit made by Mr. Malcolm which explains his attitude towards the concern and towards Hasan Samaiyeh. It is clear that he did, in practice, treat Hasan as managing partner, up to a certain po'nt (Annex 40). In this regard, generally, I would observe that the British Memorandum said no more than that there were no documents in their possession to indicate that Hasan was managing partner. Other documents, such as Malcolm's deed of partnership (Annex 33) are now forthcoming, which show that Hasan did act as managing partner for the ordinarv sale of oxide ' with the knowledge of ali but that does not alter the fact that his execution of his exclusive contract with Wonckhaus and the terms of that contract were both ultrcivires. He had no authority to warrant such a step. {64) It appears from the books of the Com and well. —In this case it is the more curious that Hasan should have persistentlv neglected to furnish any accounts to his partners and should always have put them off with vague promises that he would soon make them up. There is good reason to believe from the reports of the Residency Agent, Lingahr, at the time that these nicely-kept accounts were concocted by Abdullah and Brown at Ling ah (Enclo sures to Residency letter No. 909 of 2ist March 1908 to India).2(1 (65) ffasan Scmaiyeh was actingenimly he concluded the agreement withWdnckhauss—li he thought this and thought they would approve, where was the need for secrecy and prevaricatioa ? {66) Accordingly,Esa's corn-plaint was ground for Shaikh Sakar to give any judicial Hasan —It is not contended that Shaikh Sagar has given a judicial decision as between the partners. He merely exercised the right which he enjoys, as a law unto him self, in cegard to his own territory by cancelling a concession in what he believed to be the interests of the partners and himself. (See also items 46 and 48). As soon as the German Government has ceased endeavouring to drag the matter into the realm of politics, such measures fts are necessary in order to arrive at an adjustment of interests or claims among the concessionaires, who are all British subjects, will become possible. This is purely a matter concerning the Shaikh and ourselves. {67) 2. Could Shaikh Sakar cancel the interest of the administration of the country »♦•»»»* In the first place it is not easy to understand tan he regarded as a letting of the mines to Mr, Wonckhaus, —Stress cannot belaid oil the precise bearing of the particular English word used. Remember it is a ques tion of the translation of a vernacular word. In this case it is the word used by J&amp;a, Shaikh Sagar and Abdul Latif in reference to the document passed to Mr. Wonckhaus . The word is ' ijareh ' ( ) or ' I jar ' ( ), the latter being merely a contraction of the former. The 'word has a much more elastic signi fication than our word ' lease It includes ' hire '—•' rent' farm a pri vilege or income of variable amount sold or let for a fixed stun Similarly ' Ijareh- dar ' ( ) in Persian and its equivalent ' Mustajir ' ( ) in Arabic = ' A farmer or renter of land or revenue ;; —' a lease-holder '—' a monopo list ' a hirer Perhaps ' farm 'would be more appropriate than ' let ' or ' lease ' in the present case* We are indebted to 1st German Memorandum, Enclosures 6 and 8, for render ing ' lease.' The reason why the persons above-mentioned have applied this term ' IJar ' to the instrument in this case and have not merely called it a 'contract ' ps ' deed of sale ' is plain from theirj letters (e.g., enclosure 12 of 1st German Memorandum and 17 of British Memorandum, namely that the deed granted a monopoly and left the partners no power of control of the output or modification of the contract. It was thus an ' I jar (68) Sakar's fear that the agreement may property minos being gradtmlly lost to the owtier * * * the island of Abu Musa from Shargah, is so to discuss it. ♦ jj; It is also strange that^ * Shaikh treated differently from those of other Powers. —Shaikh Sagar's apprehensions are not so baseless in practice as they seem to be to the German Government in theory. These Arab Shaikhs have no speedy means of communication with their outlying possessions, no men-of-war to cruise and keep an eye on them. As late as 1904 Shaikh Sagar was put to a great deal of anxiety and inconvenience because an over- zealous Belgian Director of Customs, anxious to make history, went over to the Island in a Persian Customs steamer and hauled down his flag, hoisting the Persian flag instead. The British Government, which protects these Shaikhs in regard to their exter nal affairs, speedily took the matter Up and had it righted to the Shaikh's satisfac tion, but the incident naturally gave him a fright and made him suspicious. The action of the German firm and German representative in this case hag ©ertainly not been calculated to allay those suspicions. Although in the argu ments adduced in this case they have'repeatedly declared that the contract entered21 into by Hasan was simply a sale of oxide by Hasan and a purchase of oxide on de- ^ t0 ^ the Sliaikh basshown^^m dearly bow readily a very different complexion is introduced into the transaction. Thus— (i) On 13th October 1907 Messrs. Wonckbaus wrote to Sbaikb Sagar We consider the mines and tbe concession for them as a security for the advances paid If you force Haji Hassan bin Ali Somayab and Co., 1 1 ravv eir coo bes and representative, we shall have to send over some men ourselves to protect our property (Consul^ Bunder Abbas to Government of India, No. C-47, dated 25th Octo- (w) On 28th October 1907, Lieutenant Gabriel, Assistant Resident, Bunder Aboas, reported :— ' The local representative of Wonckhaus, Mr. Brown, and about 26 men left lor the island on October 22nd. A German flag which he intended to place on the accumulation of oxide was also taken . (Consul Bunder Abbas to Government of India, Telegram No. dated the 28th October 1907). ' (m) On 19th November 1907 addressing Shaikh Sagar direct, the. German »ice-Consul, Bushire, threatened the Shaikh with a claim of a lakh of rupees, and claimed for Messrs. Wonckhaus the right of direct entrv (or concern) in the working of the mines. 0 (Beskhmcy telegram No. 735 to India and Tehran, dated 13th December (iv) On 16th March 1909 Hasan Samaiyeh, no doubt under advice from his German supporters, wrote a threatening letter to Shaikh Sagar in which * xl6 S8fl€t !—- ' All the oxide mines which are on the Abu Musa belong to us and our syndicate and are under our control and in our possession (Residency Letter No. 1559, dated 4th July 1909, to India). As regards the apparent differentiation between British subjects and other foreigners, I would explain The British Government are as anxious to protect these unsophisticated Arab ShaiKhs against unfair exploitation by Br subjects just as much as other foreigners, but from the Shaikhs' point of view it is very natural that thev should regard British subjects in a different light to other foreigners. Thev know that British subjects, if not subject to th(£ own juiisdiction, are subject to that of the British Political authorities with whom they are united by close ties of treatv and obligation. They trust to the British Government to keep their own subiects m hand and give the Shaikhs immunity from worry or imposition. Thev have no such guarantee in the case of other foreigners, nefther under the complete control of themselves nor of the protecting Power. . Even Hasan Samaiyeh, until it suited his book to change his ideas, had strom? views on that point and at one time was all against the admission into the conrfrn of any foreigners, 111 {Vide Annex 41 and following item), {69) ** (The Company) was only doing legitimate interests, when it endeavoured to a exercise a direct influence on the fortunes of —Apart from what we have a' ready maintained, namely that the concession had already ceased to exist for ei^ht months, when Brown went through a form of purchase of Shaikh Sagar's share • and the evident fact {vide enclosure 11 of First German Memorandum and otW papers) that when he went into that transaction he had full knowledge of previous cancellation of the Concession. We now have the text of thp fW,i Q2o5FX) aeecl ot22 partnership admitting Malcolm (Annex. 33) and the inclusion tlierem, m dullali bin Hasan's handwriting, of the express condition that it is not open o any one of the partners to sell his share or to admit any one therein except in consultation •with Haji Hasan bin Ali Samaiyeh and with his signature toget ier with those of the partners.' This again is emphasized in Hasan s letter on tne subject to Abdul Latif (Annex. 41). It would be quite open to us to argue noni this emphatic condition, brought into operation on 13th Shaaban 1316==-j7tii December 1898—that the sale by Shi.ikh Sagar of his share to Yusuf bin Abduila.i a month later (17th Ramzan 1316 —30th January 1899) was invalid because it did not bear the signature of any of the partners—and that the sale* of the same share by Yusuf to Hasan on the 15th Shaaban 1318=8th December 1900,was doubly illegal. In this connection the bearing of the letter of Hasan Samaiyeh to Abdul Latif of 7th January 1900 is particularly important. It will be seen that it was specifically in connection with the Yusuf Abdullah share, then in the mar ket, that Hasan introduced the prohibition against any partner selling his share or admitting an outsider without consulting him and all the partners. He con gratulates Abdul Latif for preventing Yusuf from selling the share to a foreigner, and says xve are better entitled to take the share and Notwithstanding this he very soon afterwards bought Yusuf's share himself, and refrained in connection therewith from fulfilling the necessary condition which he himself had made but a few months before. Neither the signature of Esa, nor Malcolm, nor Nakhoda Ali, was taken on the transfer; and no one heard anything about it-until Hasan went somewhat out of his way to inform the Residency Agent, Lingah, of the fact in October 1906, and the latter reported it to me on the 2nd November. (See Annexes 31 and 40). (70) **The Imperial Government for the convinced of the illegality of the cancelling of —Our reply to this is that thequestionof the cancelling of the agreement between three British subjects and a Shi.ikh in treaty relation with us is a matter concerning us and him alone, and that the German Government have no locus to pronounce upon it. (71) It was evidently the aim of Shaikh rights enjoyed hy Mr.WoncJchaus under illusory for the benefit of his competitors. —This is an unfounded assumption. Shaikh Sagar had no ideas of the kind. {72) Bis proceedings are an infraction tion of which in those regions His Majesty's — On the contrary it was precisely in order to prevent any lawlessness, or any un necessary rough-handling of British subjects that the presence of the Lapwing was ordered.

Translation of a letter from ShaikhSagar b hm Cox, Political Resident in the Persian March After compliments and enquiries after your health, I beg to address you in regard to your inquiry regarding the undermentioned three points connected with the Abu Musa case. (1) You say that it is claimed that on the 12th Shaaban 1316, after my return from the Hajj, Shaikh Salim granted to three persons an agreement for the extrac tion of Mica from Bu Musa Isluxd without any permission from me, and you en quire from me that if 1 was aware of the same, bow was it that I did not mention this agreement to you on the 19th Moharram 1326, when I presented to you a statement of my relations with Shaikh Salim in regard to the Bu Musa Island. (2) You also mention to me the question of jetsam and flotsam on the Bu Musa Island ar.d state that it is claimed that Shaikh Salim was receiving the in come on this account, and (3) You have also shown me the translation ol a paper which is claimed to be dated the 4th Zilkhadeh 1315 and to be the first draft of the Oxide Contract which was altered to another form on the 18th Zilkhadeh 1815. This is my reply with regard to three points :•— Firstly —In regard to the Mica Agreement 1 was fully aware of it and Shaikh Salim consulted me (about it), and it would not have been possible that the said agreement could be issued without coming to my knowledge as Ruling Chief. But as I informed you two years ago, I had left to Shaikh Salim all the income which he could obtain from the aforesaid island, and, consequently, I did not trouble (myself) to object to this (agreement). At the same time, when I present ed ' to you the said statement regarding my relations with Shaikh Salim in respect' of Bu Musa, the question of this Mica contract did not occur to my mind at all, for, as you must be aware, the Mica affair produced no result whatever. As regards the sum of $1,500 payable by instalments to Shaikh Salim, I have no information as to how many instalments were received by Shaikh Salim. 1 did not trouble to make enquiries about the instalments, nor did I demand anything from Shaikh Salim on that account. It was my wish that he should get something from it and that he should not trouble me about his expenses. Secondly —As regards the right to i^tsam and flotsam on Bu Musa Island and all the islands of Kowasim, it is not open to doubt that it is due to tlTe Chief of the Kowasim, but the usual custom on the Oman Coast is that the inhabitants of the place exact their rights on the scene of the wreck, and when the Chief comes to know of it he settles the matter according to his own opinion; sometimes be takes his own share from his subjects and sometimes he does not take from them. In the case of Bu Musa, as I had left all the revenue to Shaikh Salim, I treated my right of jetsam and flotsam as a part of the income to go to him and used to ask no questions about it. Thirdly —With regard to the rejected draft of the Oxide agreement, I have now noted its wording but had neither seen nor heard of it before. The reason for its rejection is obviously because Shaikh Salim could not write about Bu Musa in these terms, namely, 'so long as I, my children and my brothers live, no one is entitled to raise objection to it'. No doubt this was the cause of the draft being changed. This is what was necessary to be stated and, salaams! (L. S.)

Muhammed bin Saleh bin Jebara departed from Bahrain to inform his Chief (and point out) that should he desire to entreat the Chief of Shargah on account of ^ friendship or (for) other reason (the latter would release it). When the (Bahrain) Agent 's letter reached me ? I returned an answer according to what had passed on this subject but no reply has come (to it). According to what is noticed by me {i. e.) that the injiabitants of Abu Musa voyage in the jolly boat and convey cargo, it has become necessary to inform you,' as probably that an accident may befall the boat.

If the vessel is in serious danger the persons rendering assistance claim half the value of the goods salved, a procedure sanctioned by local usage, but this Resid ency has refused to recognize that they have any absolute right to demand such a share in the absence of agreement witth the Nakhuda of the vessel Local customs in this matter as in others depend more on ' might than ' right ' and efforts are always made to mulct the owners and Nakhudas of vessels as much as possible.

N ote hy Khan Bahadur Abdul LaHf, giving the oxide concession and explaining {Bated 25th TV ith reference to the translation which you have shown to me of what purports to be rejected preliminary draft, dated 6th April 1898, of the oxide concession executed on the 10th April 1898,1 beg to make the following observations :— I note that the document purports to be signed by Hasan bin Ahmed and {U) Ali Ahmed Saleh. The Hasan bin Ahmed mentioned was a retainer of Shaikh Salim. Ali Ahmed Saleh is the man whose identity you know as Nakhuda Ali. I had nothing to do with the writing or drafting of this document. I remember that I had been absent on duty at Bushire during the spring of the year in question and it was on my return to Shargah that the project for an oxide concession was discussed. The draft had been drawn up by Abdullah bin Hasan Samaiyeh and it was he who showed it to me. At the same time he and Nakhuda Ali, who was also there, asked me to let my son Isa come into the concern as they needed some one on the spot at Shargah in order to keep in touch with Shaikhs Sagar and Salim. I agreed, but pointed out that the terms of the proposed concession as at present drafted were quite impossible, and that neither Shaikh Sagar would confirm it nor would the Government approve it. What I especially objected to was (1) the sentence in which Shaikh Salim is made to say ' so long as I, my children and my brothers live, no one will be entitled to raise objection to it' and (2) the inclusion of Nakhuda Ali as a signatory on the document. With regard to (1), I would explain that Salim was an old man of 70, who might be expected to die at any time, and I was taking into account the fact that if he died, we should thenceforth have to deal with Shaikh Sagar. As regards (2) I thought the inclusion of Nakhuda Ali was inexpedient, as I had just been visiting Bushire and knew him to be in very bad odour with the Eesidency in connection with his Bushire affairs and he was also at loggerheads with the well- known Moin-et-Tujjar of Tehran, holder of the Hormuz Concession, and I feared the latter would be likely to give us trouble if he came to know that Nakhuda Ali was a partner in a rival oxide enterprise. I also omitted the 20 years time limit, as I saw no object in inserting any fixed period of time. (Sd.) ABDUL LATIF BIN ABDURRAHMAN.

I was anxious to put the work on a more businesslike footing and therefore drew up some rules and sent them to Hasan. The latter made certain additions and had five documents diawn up including the additions and signed by himself, Abdullah and Nakhuda Ah, and he forwarded them all to me for completion by the attachment of the signatures oi Shaikh Sasar and mvself. When completed, Iwas to return three of them to turn, one for himself, one for Abdullah, and one for Nakhuda Ah. Of the remaining two I was to give one to Shaikh Sagar and keep one myself. 1 did not However, care about the extra condition which he had inserted and wrote back an^ said oO. There the matter ended. These deeds were never completed nor were any revised documents drawn up. I never showed them to Shaikh Sagar and produce them now in the state in which I received them. These rules never having become operative Esa and I always considered and presumed that the document on which the concern was carried on was that of Zilhijjeh 1315, m which xNakhuda Ali was admitted to partnership and in which it is laid down that the sale, loading and shipping should be carried out with the knowledge of all the partners. By reason of Hasan's neglect to consult us properly and his failure to render any accounts, we became dissatisfied with his conduct of affairs. ^35 a i I Annex (13).

It is Sagar's intention to lease without mentioning Salim's name and to give some advantage to Salim, but Salim would not agree to this.' The explanation of the above passage is as follows;— It will be remembered that in the second agreement between Shaikh Sagar and Shaikh Salim (dated 1884) at which my predecessor was the intermediary, Shaikh Sagar granted to Shaikh Salim an annual pension of 400 dollars together with the revenue of Sir Bu Nuair, which was expected to bring in some 200.f Up to 1889, however, this island did not produce any revenue as was expected and consequently no mention was made of it in the third agreement dated 5th Shaaban 1306 (1889) and Shaikh Salim ceased to take any interest in it. When, however, it became probable that the island might produce some revenue as the result of the concession alluded to in my letter to Hasan Samaiyeh now under reference, Shaikh Salim's interest was naturally revived and he wanted to claim the revenue under the obslete agreement of 1884, which Shaikh Sagar was alto gether unwilling to agree to on the ground that under the last agreement (1889) which was now in force the revenue of Sir Bu Nuair Island was not an item of the settlement. The Shaikhs failed to come to an understanding on this point, with the result that the project for the concession fell through. This is what had to be represented. (Sd.)

' A Persian of Bastak. Well known as an inveterate intriguer, and especially hostile to the British Agency at Lingah and to British interests generally, owing to the fact that the Residency has been obliged from time to time to make serious complaints against him. He was for some years Consular Agent for France at Lingah, but in 1907 he was proceeded against by the customs for smuggling a large quantity of tobacco; and in January 1909 Abdurrahman having circulated a silly story to the effect that the French were going to seize the port of Kung near Lingah, His Majesty's Minister on receiving the report communicated it to^his French colleague, who must also have '.'received it from the French Consul at Bushire, and replied that he had already had occasion to complain of Abdurrah man, and a little later gave him his dismissal. I have quite recently had to complain against him under the Hague Award in the French Flag arbitration, for unlawfully flying a French flag, he having got himself registered at Muscat. I attach a copy of a letter which I addressed to His Britannic Majesty's Minister regardi ng him on the 16th November 1907 (Annex 15). {Hi) Abdulla Muhammad Hasan al Khadja (German Annex 21). The German Memorandum says of this individual that he is ' a man, who on account of his experience and reputation is a recognized arbitrator in commercial matters, whose opinion is asked for by Persians and Arabians of the Persian and Arabian coasts, as far as Bahrain and to whose decisions they willingly submit. This description is greatly overdrawn. Abdulla Khadja is a Persian subject and a merchant of Lingah. An old man of 80 or 85. He is the father and supporter of one Muhammad Abdulla Khadja in regard to whom, among others. I addressed the Government of India in my letter No. 1559, dated the 4th July 1909, of which 1 append an extract. In spite of the action taken against him, Muhammad Abdulla has not ceased to intrigue by using the spinous seal and endeavouring to fly a Turkish flag. He has been able specifically to give us trouble by attempt ing to treat Arab visitors from Muscat, Trucial Coast, Bahrain and Koweit as Turk ish subjects and thrust upon them Turkish passports or visas, and it has only been by the Vigilance of our Agent at Lingah and continual pressure on the local Persian authorities by the Residency that Muhammad Abdulla has been prevented from achieving much practical success. Naturally the family bear us ill-will and their testimony in a matter like this is objectionable. {iv) Abdalmuhsin ibn-Ahmed-ibn-Mushari (Annex 22), also Annex 16.

Extract from a letter from the Political Resid Secretary to the Govenrnment of India in 1559, dated the 4th July 1909). *♦**♦♦♦♦* Our Agent at Lingah. has for years past experienced a great deal of trouble from the vagaries and intrigues of a Persian named Muhammad Abduila, who though carrying no commission and though the Tehran Government have refused to agree to his appointment, has nevertheless managed, by flying a Turkish flag and using a spurious rubber seal., to pose as a Turkish Consular official and, under this guise, to make difficulties for our Agent by encouraging visitors from Oman or Bahrain to accept his protection, and in other ways. We have repeatedly com- plained to the Governor of the Gulf ports of the conduct of this Persian and also to His Majesty's Legation. \\ hile Muhammad Abduila has always been repudiated he has never been suppressed, until last year when the Darya Begi in pursuance of orders received from Tehran took the- opportunity afforded by a personal visit to Lingah to have Muhammad Abdulla's flagstaff removed. Soon after this incident, the Wali of Busrah, who properly speaking would appear to have no status to interfere in affairs on the Persian coast, sent a representative down to Lingah whom Muhammad Abduila took steps to cram with garbled stories of his ill-treat ment by the Darya Begi, and this has now resulted in a complaint against the Darya Begi by the Turkish Legation and a demand that the Governor of the Gulf ports should give satisfaction. A telegram recently received by His Excellency from the Persian Foreign Minister quotes Hasan Samaiyeh as being one of the persons who had furnished statements on which the Turkish demand for satisfaction froip. the Darya Begi was based. The other two persons who are quoted by name are also individuals with pronounced anti-English proclivities, one of whom has lately been xemoved from the post of French Consular Agent which he formerly held.40 A nnex (17) j ' ' ■ Question A As put to the, members of th In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate.

Amongst the conditions for the validity of a lease are the specifications. and record of the period of the lease. Supposing for instance he were to say ' I have let the house at the rate of one Toman per mensem,' such a lease is leEgaUy null and void and if the lessee says a prayer in such a house the prayer will be futile.

(L. S.) The hopeful Muhammad Ali-el-MoosevL [N ote .—The most venerable Shia Mullah in Bushire.] (iv) It should be understood that the conditions for the validity of a lease- are six; by the absence of any of which six conditions the lease is null and void. The first (is) the compact,-i.e., the proposal and acceptance, intended to indicate the fact of the assumption of the profit for a fixed period in return for something specific. Secondly, the legality of the possession. Thirdly, the taking cognizance of the rent ot the measure or weight or Dumber! Fourthly, the specification of the profit by time or by the job. Fifthly, the retention of the pro it in possession or its coming under that category (of possession). Sixthly, the defining of the period of the lease in such a manner that it shall become neither less nor more. The subject-matter of the question (under reply) being void of certain of the conditions, namely, the compact, and the period and the cognizance of the amount of the profit, is not valid, and God is aware of the truth of affairs. Written by the humble Abdullah el Moosevi el Baladi (L. S.). [N ote .—The Chief Mullah of the Ussuli sect of Shias in Bushire, His opinions are greatly respected.] ~ v (v) In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate. The distinguished Ulemas—may their blessings amongst the people endure have defined ' lease ' to be the taking possession of an ascertained profit in return for something specific. So whatever is like giving possession of original property for instance by selling it, is a thing extraneous to a compact of lease, and X so is anything m which the profit is not defined, either in itself—such as by the fact of sewing of a certain garment or the riding of a certain animal to a certain plac e or by the fixing of a period such as a full year. And thus, as regards the subiect of the question, whereas, it is not a case of taking possession of a profit, but of the original property, and whereas the profit is not fixed by either of the two methods aforesaid, the lease is accordingly null and void, on both counts and it is obvious that while there is no contradiction in the sa- : d two rulings it is recorded that the majority set store by the last. And God is aware of His commands.45 Written by this humble servant of the Shera Murteza el Moose vi. Sadr el- Islam. (L. S.)

The first is that a lease requires bond such as proposal and acceptance ; and the second of the conditions thereof is that it should be for a known period.

The said lease is invalid and illegal in several respects and does not contain all the conditions. The first of the reasons for its invalidity is that the period of the lease is unspecified. The second reason is that the formula of the lease has not been pronounced therein. The third reason is that, legally speaking, the right to any ground rent, in the manner mentioned in the question, is unknown ({, e . inadmissible) from all points of view.

Written by the humblest of the members of the Clergy, Abdullah bin Muham mad Saeed-el-Ansari, of Kelat. {viii). The answer. A lease has several conditions, and if a single condi tion (thereof) is violated, the lease becomes invalid, and how it would be now that several conditions have been omitted therefrom. Firstly, it becomes binding by a known period. This has been omitted however. Secondly, a lease becomes binding by proposal and acceptance. Should these conditions be absent the lease is null and void, and when the lease is nullified it is for the lessor to take possession of his property and to lease it to another ; and God knows best. (Signed and sealed.) Abdul Karim bin Ahmed, servant of the August Shera Law, by his own hand. And if the owner of the property wishes to turn out the lessee, he can turn him out immediately. (Signed and sealed.) Abdul Karim, servant of the Shera Law at Qais, {ix). The answer. Praise be to God, Who leads to the right! This lease, as it is mentioned in the question, is not in accord with the precepts of the August Shera and is hull and void and invalid. So, the owner of the property has the option to return to his property and he has the absolute possession thereof and can use his property in any manner that he may wish. He has the option (to do so), and the lessee has no right or title in that property. And whatever is invalid according to the August Shera is to be considered as non-existent. Should the proprietor desire to turn out the lessee from that place, he can do so, and there is nothing to bind the owner of the place. And God knows more, (Signed and sealed.)

What do you say as regards a certain man who leased certain property to a cer tain pa?ty and did not stipulate a fixed period in the deed of lease, wherein also no legal formula was pronounced between them, and after some time the owner of the property cancelled the lease. Has the owner of the property the right of cancelling (it) and expelling Za'd, the lessee, from his property or not ? It is requested that you will explain the true position according to the precepts of the enlightened Shera, and be rewarded, your reward being with God. Answer. Yes, the owner has the right to expel the lessee from his property because the said lease contains nothing binding according to the Shera. Immediately the owner cancels the lease, the lease becomes dissolved. Written by Shubbar bin Ali-el-Moosevi. (L. S).

I am always receiving letters irom niy father Hasan who gives me the news of your health. You should, God willing, imonn me of your health and the news of your side by every mail. 0 my brother, I beg to advise yoii in connection with the dispute which was between us and Sassoon. We have settled with Sassoon and it has been arranged that a compromise should be effected. And we have written papers of compro mise for the settlement of the dispute. And whereas your father was one of the partners and he has now passed away, and whereas you are in his place and are his executor, it is necessary that you should give a power-of attorney from your self in my name so that I may affix, in the documents, your signature with the signatures of the partners which are (recorded) in the documents held by me in the case versus Sassoon, as Sassoon knows that Haji Ali has passed away and that I, Abdullah, was his agent at Calcutta. IN ow. after Haji Ali's death, it is obvious that you are his executor and it is necessary that you should write a power-of- attorney for me (saying) that I am your agent in Calcutta in all the aixairs whicu may occur in Calcutta as I was before in the affairs of your father. For this purpose I have now written a power-of-attorney in English in accord ance with the law which will be accepted by the court; it is a power-of-attorney from vou in my name. There is also an affidavit testifying that you are J^ejef bin Haji Ali—his executor and attorney and that you are now in his place. This cer tificate together with the power should be taken by yourself to the British Resi dent or Assistant Resident at Bunder Abbas and you should, in his presence, admit that you are the son of Haji Ali .and are in your father's place and that you have made this power in the name of Abdullah bin Hasan who is to be your agent in Calcutta as he was before in the lifetime of Haji Ali. Also the Resident or the Assistant Resident should certify in the affidavit that you are Haji Ali's son and his representative. You should also take a writing from the Belgian Director of Customs that you are Haji Ali's son and his representative and obtain another certificate from the Postmaster and expedite sending them to me by registered past soon and without delay, and write on the cover my address in English as follows:— A.

I have informed you especially that a settlement has been made between us and David Sassoon by compromise and reconciliation. And let it not be hidden from you that owing to the fact that Haji Ali has passed away, there is need for a power from you, so that I may sign for you in the papers appertaining to the com promise, because in the beginning there was in our hand a power from your father Haji Ali (stating) that I was his agent in Calcutta, and after your father's death I informed (them) that you were in your father's place; and the court demanded that you should write a power for me setting forth that you are the attorney and execu tor of the will of your father, and also that I am Agent in Calcutta on your behalf in the Sassoon case, and for the oxide, etcetera, and the power should be (written) in English in accordance with the law, because Haji Ali has passed away and it is necessary that the Court should understand that Haji Ali has no son besides you. Therefore in order to settle the affairs I have written in your name a special power in the case of oxide and our dispute with Sassoon (saying) that what we now arrange with Sassoon for settlement by compromise is agreed upon by you. I intended sending the power by registered post by this mail, but it was not ready. This is for your information, and, God willing, it will reach you by registered post next mail. You should act upon the instructions which I will now explain to you. When you receive the power, you should take it to the Resident or British Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident at Bunder Abbas. He will read it over to you and you should admit before him that this power is from you to me and that I am you/agent in Calcutta in the same way as in the days of your father and affix your signture—Najaf bin Ali Ahmed Saleh—in the place which is marked in pen cil. Then the Resident or Vice-Consul will record his testimony and seal it with the Government seal. You should forward it soon and avoid procrastinaton and delay and you should send it to me by registered post to Calcutta soon and with out delay. On the same day when it reaches you, you should take it to the Resi dent or the Assistant who is now present at Bunder Abbas. I have written you this letter by this mail so that you may know that you will receive the power by registered post, i am sending you this letter in my fatner s letter and have ^or-* warded another lettec to you by post.

Wonckhaus and Company, and if necessary I am prepared to confirm this statement by oath the Koran before a Mujtaliid. I have had several conversations about the Abu Musa case with parties inter ested. The first was when Abdullah bin Hasan Samaiyeh came to see me accom panied by Mirza Hussein ' Germani * The Dragoman of tlie German Consulate - They came to Bunder Abbas and stayed in the house of Haji Amin-ut-Tujjar. Abdullah on landing from the ship came to my house and asked me to come over and have a talk about the matter at Haji Amin's house. I went over to Haji Amin's house and there Mirza Hussein. Abdulla . ,. and Haii Ali ' Germani 't were present. , actotum o t e nrm m mgah. Abdullah asked me to give him a paper stat ing that I handed over my share of the concession on Abu Musa to Abdullah bin Hasan. The paper was to be given a date prior to the date of the contract between Messrs. Wonckhaus and Hasan. He also asked me to give him another paper saying that I was quite satisfied with the contract. I refused saying that I would not do anything of the sort unless they settled up my account with David Sassoon, that is my father's on account of Oxide, carpets, etc. I s id if they did not give me back the carpets they should pay me 20,000 (twenty thousand) rupees and settle my account and then I would give them the paper. However, they did not give me the money and I mentioned the matter to the British Consulate. These two persons came to Bunder Abbas not long after the British Consul Lieutenant Gabriel returned there from a trip he made to Shargah, etc. Some months later Mr. Brown came to Bunder Abbas. The exact date c^n be ascertained from the Consul, Bunder Abbas, as I reported the matter to him at the time, but it was just about two years ago. Mr.' Brown had two interviews with me-once at the house of Jamshidian's {.gent and once at the Customs house. At the first interview Agha Ghulam Ali Khorassani was present, at the second Mr. Moses Khan, the Customs Director. Agha Ghulam Ali is rgent of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Comp. .ny. Mr. Brown had a long talk with me. Before beginning to talk about Abu Musa he dis missed two Hindus, Gulshan and Asanand Ghulab. Mr. Brown asked me why I had not signed the papers shown me by Abdullah and Mirza Hussein,. I said there appeared to be no advantage for me in doing so, and therefore I hadn't. Mr. Brown said he had bought the share in the Oxide Company belonging to Sh.ikh Sagar for Reals 250. I replied that Shaikh Sagar had never made anything out of the business and so would sell cheap. Mr. Brown said he wanted to buy mv share and said that he would settle up all my accounts with Hasan bin Ali and Abdullah. I never offered to sell my share to Mr, Brown. In fact as I reported to the Consulate at the time Mr. Brown offered to buy my share. I would swear to his on the Koran. This took place in the presence of Ag-'a Ghulam Ali Khoras sani. At the second interview and after Mr. Moses Khan tried to persuade me to go to Lingah to settle with Mr. Brown. He continued tv endeavour to make me do this for a long time and on my refusing he got annoyed with me and worried me to such an extent that I finally had to resign my post as Hamal Bashi at Bunder Abba's.

I beg to say that my meaning, when I wrote the sentence, was (The annulment of this agreement is better than the acceptance of this agreement.) It is not hidden from your Honour that I received my education in the Gulf, and that 1 am not an expert in the niceties of grammar and the shades of meaning of various measures of words. When I write, I write according to the usages and understanding of the community in which I live. „ j As regards the use of the measure as synonymous with the use is quite an ordinary one in these parts, and I can mention many other instances of the same such as— (Reposing) (Continuance) (Being ruined) (Advancing) (Remaining.) There is no idea of a ' desire to ' here. Again you will note that in the letter from my son Is?., dated 7th Moharram 1325 (20th February 1907) to Shaikh Sagar occurs the sentence: ' Va atlub min jenabekum almosaadeh fi naqz va istebtal-i-hazehel varaqah ' (and I beg your Honour for assistance in the breaking up and annulling of this document). This shows that the words and were used synonymously. Furthermore, when writing to me on the 23rd Moharram with reference to my letter to him (dated 8th Zilhejjeh 1324) enjoining on him the Hasan used the same form of words as I had, thus: ' You particularly wrote about the deed of contract which I executed with Wonckhaus the German for the sale of oxide from Abu Musa Island. I understood what you said, namely, that your son Esa was not agreeable to the execution of a document of this purport-for the reason that I had not consulted you, and that it was necessary that the partners should not enter (into transaction) without the 'knowledge of the other partners; that this humble one had entered into this trans action without consultation and that Isa feared that complications would result owing to the admittance of foreigners (into the concern) and the * * (Note), —Curiously enough in this passage Hasan Samaiyeh makes '* muqawiieh ' musculiae at the beginning of the sentence and feminine at the end #63 (The annul men b of this contract is better than its acceptance.) Again in writing to me on 15th Safer 1325 (30th March 1907) Hasan suggested that I had better, if I thought fit, write to the German myself and explain to him regarding the annulment of the contract. His precise words were: * It will be seen that he here used and not , It is clear, therefore, that Hasan Understood me fully in the sense I intended to convey. Secondly, the explanation of the use of the spelling is as follows in my opinion:— It is rendering into writing of a colloquial construction of speech. Thus in conversation, if referring to a masculine object, such as Zaid, I should not say but leaving out the ' Zamah ' after the ' h ' but substituting the Zamah,''' for 'Kasrah ' after the ' tSimilarly if I were re ferring to a feminine object I should not say but substituting the Kasrab ' after the 't' for the feminine pronoun 'ha '. Likewise, in writing a colloquial letter I should render the above sounds into writing. The word or is constantly used, in my parlance in reference to a thing in the sense of It is also evident from Hasan Samaiyeh's reply above quoted that he uses it in this sense:— * (Better than its acceptance, i. e., better than the acceptance of the con tract). The pronoun is used in the feminine, and could only refer to the con tract. Dated 23rd March d9dd. (Sd.)

Zwemer of the Church in the Persian Gulf, toLieutenant-Colonol {Dated Bahrain, March 22 nd, With reference to the meaning of the Arabic sentence and the probable intention of the writer in using those words concerning which point you asked my opinion, I take pleasure in replying as follows:— First, it is evident that whoever wrote the sentence was not a thorough scholar in Arabic, as he confused the masculine and feminine forms in the last word of the sentence. To my mind the obvious translation of the phrase is, ' the annulment of this agreement is better than it/acceptance.' I do not think it is at ail obvious or possible to translate the sentence ' the annulment of this agreement is better than to comply with (his wishes)'. This translation is, to my mind, a forced one, and not the natural significance of the words in question, whatever be their connection. 1 am confirmed in this opinion after consulting with one or two Arabs concerning the popular use of the pronoun in such a sentence, and I find that they agree with me that there is a great looseness in the use of the feminine or masculine pronoun at the close of a clause or sentence. I am sure that nine out of ten Arabs would give the preference to the former translation of the sentence as the obvious and natural intention of the writer. Although my opinion does not carry weight beyond that of others who have a speaking and reading knowledge of Arabic, yet J feel confident that in this case it is not a matter of expert grammatical opinion, but of everyday usage in the Persian Gulf, and I have no hesitation in saying that the first 'translation is the right one.65 Annex 36.

It is a long time that no letter has been received from Khadheiri, and when I saw that no letter came from him I also did not write to him. The same happened in the case of Hotz s firm. God is gene rous. At last the matter will not remain as it is. God will find a way. I am now in communication with a Hindu (who wishes) to purchase (the oxide) at Bombay at 6 rupees per Gindi; and we offer it at rupees 7 to be delivered at the Bombay harbour, the Customs duty and warehouse fee to be paid by the Hindu himself. He wants 2,000 Gindis and wishes to make a contract, afterwards, for India. If he contracted 4,000 tons per annum for India at lis. 7 per Gmdi to be delivered in the Bombay harbour, Haji Hasan will agree. Let me see what happens. I will let you know. This price for which he buys means that the bag and freight to Bombay should be payable by us. If the bags are new, they will cost Ks. 12 per 100 and if they are old they cost Rs. 6 per 100. Old and new should be mixed, so that the oxide may duly reach Bombay. It should be weighed in the steamer. May God vish that these terms should be agreed upon. If Abdullah does not spoil (the matter) it will be good. He (Haji Hasan) has intimated to Abdullah, but has written that he (Abdullah) should not speak about it but should intimate if it is not detrimental to his Calcutta oxide market. Let us see what reply is re ceived from Abdullah. We have also given a draft for Rs. 1,000 so that new bags may be purchased. I stated (the above) for your information so that you may be aware that the affairs have not progressed up to now. It was all due to themselves. Wherever the matter is arranged, Abdullah will at last spoil it. As to the matter of Khadheiri and the firm of Hotz, I know he (Abdullah) has written something, owing to which they will not write any letters hereaiter. Greetings!67 Annex 38.

I toul Haji tiasan that we should sell 2,000 Gindis and pay the value thereof to Abdullah, so that we may redeem the oxide pawned with the (other) Hindu ; but he did not agree. Another Hindu wants 1,000 Gindis at the &amp;c»me prioe. Haji Hasan has not agreed (to supply him), and they are now in nego tiations to buy from Hormuz and they will do so.'

We were on the sea for four days and four nights and did not even then reach the island. We returned to Lingah. If he had supplied efficient men, or if I myself had engaged efficient men, we should have reached the Island. This is the way Haji Hasan goes on.

As regards the Sir Island, if you can make arrangements with some one in Calcutta besides the firm of Sassoon, it will, in my opinion, oe better, -N 0 ® ne then raise any claim in Calcutta and the claimant s statement will not oe listeaf u to. There are many words which cannot be written. The circumstances in con nection with the Calcutta oxide are all due to the I^ondon firm^ because one j eaP ago they rumoured at Lingah that we are no longer able to work the oxide in the Bin Musa Island; and it was written from London tnat they shoulo. spend as much as they can and take the Island out of our hands. In my opinion, an opportunity has now been offered to them, because 1 was myseli at Calcutta and a Ilindu offer ed to buy all the oxide and the value was also arranged, xle also paid Rs. 1,000 and was to pay Rs. 4,000 more and take delivery of the goods. They cancelled it (however) for tb.6 sake of one niontli b respite, bo fw four months lia\6 elapsed and the oxide has remained unsold. Had J. not been afraid ox the Bank, 1 would have gone myself to Calcutta and disposed of the oxide in any way. When I was at Calcutta there were many buyers. The oxide will now remain (unsold) like ft horse in Bombay which will eat so much that it will be lost at length. You will of course say that I knew this from the beginning. The oxide which was shipped has been consigned to Mr. Brady. If you had brought to their office it had to be consigned to them. According to what Abdullah has written to Haji Hasan and myself the Cal cutta office says ' tell Malcolm not to, write any letters to the Bombay office'. It becomes evident that as you know well the courses of affairs and the answers due to every one, and as you grasp facts, it is for this reason that he says you should write no letters for us {i. e., on our behalf). Otherwise what is the object ? Every letter requires an answer. I do not know what to write concerning the state of things which has been brought about. It is now about three or four years that despite all my endea vours to get oxide shipped to London, as a sample, it cannot be done. What further should I represent to you, and salaams.70 Annex. 41.

';h re ^ erexice to re P ort ^ rom which point rny present note takes up ths At that time (the summer of 1909) I considered that I had a good deal to com plain of in the attitude towards me of the Acting German Consul Herr Wassmuss. and m this view Sir George Barclay fully concurred on seeing papers which I showed him personally in Teheran ; I attributed this mainly to the fact that Hera Wassmuss, as a new comer with no knowledge of the country or language, wai necessarily in the hands of his Dragoman. Both he, howeyer 5 and Dr, Listemann, the permanent incumbent, placed im plicit reliance on the man and neither would hear a word against him. This of course was not unnatural. /As will be seen from what follows the man has since been entirely exposed, dis credited and summarily dismissed. On the termination of the disturbances and the expulsion of Saiyid Murteza Mirza Husein gave up his leisure to local politics and by Judicious bribery among the community' of harbour boatmen (his father was a local Nakhoda) got himself elected a member of the Bushire Anjuman. Later on, in January 1910, he was able to contrive his selection and that of his ally Mirza Ali Kazeruni (see my report of June 1909) as candidates for two of the seats in the Teheran Majlis allot ted to the Gulf Ports. The Governor, however, intervened on the ground that the election was not a bona- fide one and their deputation never took shape. Meanwhile Mirza Husein's operations in arms dealings in association with Haji Muhammacf Hassan, the local broker of Messrs. Wonckhaus, proceeded as usual but some of the captures of arms by His Majesty's ships were reported to have in volved the pair in heavy losses and put them in some financial difficulty. In March 1910, owing to the stagnation trade in Bushire and other causes, Messrs. Wonckhaus withdrew their European agent for a time and left the broker Haj! Muhammad Hassan in charge. The jealousy evinced by Mirza Husein at not, being given the agency himself, resulted in a split between him and Haji Muham mad Hassan which led to a good deal of mutual recrimination and consequent exposure of their shady business affairs. In September 1910 a sum of £1,700 oddiwhich Messrs. Wonckhaus had despatched, through the medium of Haji Muham mad Hassan, to the neighbouring coast by sailing boat for the purchase of grain for export, was lost. The money disappeared in transit and suspicion, fostered by Mirza Husein, fell on Haji Muhammad. The latter eventually absconded to Tangistan, and Mirza Husein was appointed in his place as Wonckhaus' agent. The firm, however, soon came to the conclusion that Mirza Husein was implicated, and Muhammad Hassan more sinned against than sinning, and induced the latter to return from Tangistan. A short time afterwards they preferred a claim on his behalf against Mirza Husein for misappropriating in the broker's absence a cargo of arms which the latter had ordered out. These arms Mirza Husein is said to have sold to various dealers, of whom one Abdul Karim bought and secreted 10. These arms having been traced and seized, the Director of Customs having obtained proof of their import by Mirza Husein, took up the case against him with the Governor and the German Consulate. At the same time the German firm convinced theic Consul of Mirza Husein's dishonest behaviour in connection with the disappear ance of the £1,700 and the defalcations of Haji Muhammad Hassan, with th»74 T^sult that Dr- Listemann at last decided to dismiss his retainer. To this end Mr. ILrumpeter, Messrs. Wonckhous , then agent, armed with a letter from the German Consul intimating his dismissal and enclosing his pay to date, proceeded with the Consul's authority to the Mirza^s house with the intention of arresting him or seizing certain important documents which he was believed to hold. Mirza Husein^ however, escaped by a back door and took bast with a local Mullah. Monsieur Constant, the Belgian Provincial Director of Customs, Bushire, about this time received instructions from Teheran to report to his Administration concerning the case against Mirza Husein, and informed my Commercial Adviser, /* Mr. Chick, of the purport of a telegraphic report which he had sent towards the /£ latter part of March/which was to this effect, mz..— ^ 'Heir Kmmpeter had been deputed by the German Consul to hand Mirza / ^ 'A Husein a letter of dismissal and the salary due to him. The Mirza took to ilight, realising that he had been unmasked and convicted of extensive robberies on tha German Firm. 5 ' 'Mirza Husein is now spending large sums of money in order to procure false evidence from the Mullahs. 'Mirza Husein has long since been known to the Customs as an importer of arms and is at the moment being prosecuted by the Customs for smuggling ten rifles, and in this-connection the Governor of Bushire has informed me that Mirza Husein had sent him 150 tomans as a bribe. He, Mirza Husein, is now haggling as to the amount of fine which he should be called upon to pay. Mirza Husein, as an agitator and a rogue, whose downfall will be welcome by all honest mem bers of the community.' Charges against Mirza Husein are still pending and, meanwhile, the German Consul is withholding the rent of the German Consulate premises which belong to Mirza Husein, in connection with his debt to the German firm. Lastly, his old friends of the spring of 1909 have since turned against him and recently got up an extensive round-robin {signed among others by his Nationalist accomplice Mirza Ali, Kazeruni) in which they accuse him of being Saiyid Murte- za's instigator and evil genius and demanded that he should be made to disgorge or refund the money which he had prompted Saiyid Murteza to plunder from the Government Customs. * It will be seen that Mirza Husein has been thoroughly discredited; denounced by the Local Government; prosecuted by the Customs and the German firm for dishonesty and summarily dismissed from fiis post in the German Consulate. I submit that we have ample grounds to mention, in our reply to the German Rejoinder, that since the penning of it they must admit that the Dragoman, upon whose integrity they relied, has been proved to be a thorough rogue and that they will appreciate our inability to place reliance on his statements. ■ P.

SECOND MEMORANDUM OF HIS BRI TANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT RESPECTING THE CLAIM OF MESSRS. ROBERT WONCKHAUS AND CO. IN CONNECTION WITH THE SHIPMENT OF RED OXIDE FROM ABU MUSA. [The marginal references are to the German text of the Second German Memorandum.] HIS Majesty's Government have had under careful consideration the memorandum drawn up by the German Government relating to the ■occurrences on the island of Abu Musa, which was forwarded by the German Ambassador on the 4th December, 1909. In view of the nature of the arguments and evidence contained in that memo randum, it has been found necessary to cause further enquiries to be made in the Persian Gulf, and, although every effort has been made to avoid unnecessary delay, it has been found impossible to prepare the observations of His Majesty's Govern ment upon such arguments and evidence at an earlier date. For convenience of exposition, the conclusions arrived at by the German Government, as sum marised on pages 27-29 of their memorandum, are set forth each under a separate heading and printed in italics ; the observations of His Majesty's Government upon such conclusions, and upon the arguments and evidence by which they are sup ported in the body of the memorandum, are sub joined in ordinary type. Copies of all documents referred to, except such as have already appeared in previous communications, are annexed in the appendix. His Majesty's Government desire first to offer a few preliminary remarks on some of the facts which are enumerated on page 3 of the memorandum of the German Government as not being disputed. [926] BHis Majesty's Government agree that Sheikh bagar was prevented by the JBritish resident from driving Sheikh Salim out of Abu Musa by force. There is no doubt that Sheikh Sagar, supported as he was by all the tribesmen, was in a position to treat Sheikh Salim, who had no means of defend ing himself, in any way he pleased, and it was only because Sheikh Sagar loyally submitted to the warning of the British resident that there must be no breach of the maritime truce that Sheikh Salim was allowed to remain in Shargah at all, and that arrangements were made for his maintenance. His Majesty's Government would observe that Abdul Latif, father of Esa, was not the British i£ consular agent,' but Residency agent. With regard to- the statement that ' the rent p was paid regularly, and received by Sheikh Salim,' His Majesty's Government would point out that the German Gbvernment have omitted all reference to Sheikh Sagar's statement that, on being informed by Sheikh Salmi of the concession that he, acting as Begent, had granted, he voluntarily set aside the amount of the rent, as forming part of the revenue of Abu Musa, for Sheikh Salim, in order to make up his allowance to the original sum of 600 dollars, or more (see Appendix 5 to First British Memorandum). His Majesty's Government would also point out p that the statement that the share of Sheikh Sagar was on the 10th October, 1907, sold by Hassan Samieh to Thomas Brown is somewhat misleading, if unaccompanied by any reference to the fact that such sale took place eight months after the cancellation of the concession by Sheikh Sagar, and a week after the delivery of the final order that all work was to cease. His Majesty's Government cannot agree that p the summary of the terms of the contract between Hassan Samieh and Herr Bobert Wonckhaus is accurate, and would refer to the terms of such contract as set out in Annex 5 to the First German Memorandum. Similar observations apply to the summary of Sheikh Sagar's letter of the 21st February, 1907, to Hassan Samieh (Annex 12 to First German Memorandum).P* With reference to the statement that Sheikh Sagar on -the 3rd October, 1907, again ordered that the work should cease, His Majesty's Govern ment would suggest the addition of the words and that he should remove his coolies and gear within ten days.' Similarly after the words 'Thereupon, about the 20th October, 1907,' the words ' Hassan having taken no notice of this warning' should be inserted to render the state ment complete. P- 5- Plis Majesty's Government are unable to concur in the account given by the German Government of the attempted landing on Abu Musa by two employes of the. firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Co. The facts of the case are that Mr. Brown and several employes of Robert W onckhaus and Co., who, His Majesty's Government contend, had no right on the island at all, attempted to land, and persistently ignored warnings that were given Finally, as they disregarded all friendly attempts to deter them from landing, a few shots were fired over their heads (Appendix 28 Mr. Brown has never made any complaint to the Residency on the subject. J His Majesty's Government now proceed to the consideration of the conclusions arrived at .Jjjr the German Government. I. t g&gt;p. 27,28. (a.) Sheikh Salim i Musa ; (h.) and therefore, law 'prevailing right to lease mining company. in his own nameAmording medan religious the Lease agreemen however, the e the exclusive mines simply It will be convenient to consider the above statements under two heads (a) and (a.) Before considering the new arguments and pp. 5, 6. evidence put forward, His Majesty's Government would point out that the allegation contained in the Second German Memorandum that the Britishmemorandum is inaccurate in stating that Sagar granted to balim the revenue of the island, in cluding that derived from the mines, is not warranted bj the facts ; nor is it accurate to say., as the German memorandum does, that ' Sakar in his own account only speaks of having assigned to Salim the amount of the rent of the oxide mines.' Sheikh Sagar's statement was as follows : ' Seeing that Sheikh Salim had ceased not to complain that the sum of 400 dollars was not sufficient for his subsistence, I voluntarily set aside the amount ot this rent for him, that it might make up his subsistence, so that the total of what came in to him yearly might be 600 dollars as before, and over, and that no cause of soreness might be left to him on account of the paucity of his allowance. I have absolutely not given him any deed in con nection with the island nor in regard to the mines therein ; all I did was to relinquish the income to him in the way of financial assistance from me to him, and it was done voluntarily and at my own discretion ' (First British Memorandum, Appen dix 5). The words ' I have absolutely not given him any deed in connection regard to the mines therein show clearly that the word ' income ' which follows refers not only to the income Irom the mines, but to the whole income derived from the island. And Sheikh Salim states : 'You were kind enough to place the island of Abu Musa under my supervision, so that I might cultivate therein and reap from it the means of subsistence' (First British Memo randum, Appendix 1). There can be no doubt that Sheikh Sagar permitted Salim to enjoy all revenue that might accrue from the island. In practice the only substantial revenue was derived from the oxide mines ; the other sources of income mentioned in the Second German Memorandum will be discussed later. The question at issue being whether the island of Abu Musa is the property of Sheikh Salim or of Sheikh Sagar in his capacity as Sheikh of Shargah, His Majesty's Government brought forward as evidence in support of their contention declarations by both the suggested claimants, each of whom stated in the clearest possible way that the island is the property of Sheikh Sagar (First British Memorandum, Appendices 1 and 5) Evidence of so cogent and convincing a natureCan seldom, if ever, have been brought forward in a case where the title to land was in question, and His Majesty's Government can only express their surprise that the German Government should decline to accept such evidence. The objections suggested to such evidence seem to be as follows:— 1. The statements were made by interested parties. 2. They were made while the case was in pro gress and steps were being taken to collect evidence. 3. Major Cox was at Shargah at the time when they were made. 4. They are out of harmony with the former attitude of the two sheikhs. 1. It may be conceded that the statement of Sheikh Sagar (the date of which should obviously be, as suggested in the Second German Memo randum, 1908 instead of 1898) is open to the objection which may be taken to the evidence given by any claimant in support of his own case. But how it can be suggested that Sheikh Salim is ' interested' in disproving his alleged title to the island His Majesty's Government are entirely unable to understand. The effect of the cancella tion of the contract by Sheikh Sagar has been that Sheikh Salim has lost a considerable portion of his income, and the suggestion that the latter would be ready to give false evidence in support of the contention that Sagar had a right to take the step which has had such unfortunate results for Salim is one which cannot be maintained for a moment. The statement of Sheikh Salim's (to which he still absolutely adheres) is a declaration entirely against his interest, and is conclusive. 2. His Majesty's Government agree that these statements were made after the question of the ownership of the island had been raised, and when evidence on the point was being collected. His Majesty's Government do not attach much weight to this objection, which would apply with at least equal force to much of the evidence contained in the annexes to the Second German Memorandum ; they would remark that there would obviously be no reason for making such statements (especially that of Sheikh Salim) before the question of title had arisen. 3. If any meaning can be attached to this objection it can only be that His Britannic [926] C€ Majesty's .Resident, with the object of strengthen-' ing the case, deliberately induced the two sheikhs to make statements which he and they knew to be untrue. His Majesty's Government cannot discuss such a suggestion, and will only express regret that it should have been made. 4. This point will be discussed later. His Majesty's Government also produced, as further evidence of Sheikh Sagar's ownership of the island, two letters written by him in 1884 to the British resident (First British Memorandum, Appendices 3 and 4). It cannot of course be disputed that these letters were written long before the question of title had arisen, but the German Government deny that they can be relied on as evidence of Sagar's ownership. His Majesty's Government are unable to accept the German Government's account of the circum stances under which these letters were written. Tnese circumstances have been explained above. At the time of Salim's deposition Sagar had all the tribesmen at his back, while Salim had no follow ing at all; the only question was whether Sagar should forcibly remove Salim from the island, which course would involve a breach of the mari time truce. Sagar informed the British Resident on the 17th May, 188-3, that he proposed to adopt this course, and was informed in reply that in order to avoid a breach of the truce he ought to arrange a peaceable settlement (First British Memorandum, Appendix G). This was accord- ingly done; but had not Sagar been anxious to comply with tire wishes of the British Resident there can be no doubt that Salim would have been forcibly and permanently removed from the island, in which case no question as to his title to it could ever have arisen. As it was, however, an agreement was arrived at, and Salim, who at the time of his deposition Was at Abu Musa, was permitted by his successor to reside there. The agreement, however, did not work satisfactorily. Under these circumstances Sagar writes to the British resident to the effect that three courses are open: (a) that Salim should give a guarantee that he will do nothing to disturb the maritime truce ; that the British Government should remove him from the island ; (c) that the British Government should stand aside while Sagar dealt with Salim as he thought fit. In both letters he states7 clearly that the island is his property as Sheikh of Shargah. His Majesty's Government cannot accept the contention of the German Govern ment that all Sagar claimed was that Abu Musa was ' politically a dependency of Shargah.' There would be no object in Sagar's making such a statement to the Resident, who was well acquainted with the fact, and such an inter pretation would render the letters meaning less, as there was never a suggestion of Salim's setting up an independent state in Abu Musa. The meaning of the letters is clearly that if Salim is to be allowed to live on the island, instead of being forcibly ejected, his occupation must be distinctly understood to be without prejudice to Sagar's rights as owner, and the peace must be kept. His Majesty's Government would remark, with reference to the use of the words ' 1,' &lt;£ we.' ' my,' ' our,' in the above letters, that in the original Arabic the plural forms are used throughout. His Majesty's Government are also unable to accept the contention of the German Government that when Sagar uses the words ' our' or ' my island' the meaning is 'the island belongs politically to the territory of Shargah,' while the same words in the mouth of Salim mean ' the island is my private property.' The cases in which Salim uses the words ' my' or ' our island' are considered below, but it may be remarked that in the opinion of His Majesty's Government no evidence of ownership can be derived from the u&amp;e of such words by an occupier -; every man who pays rent for the house he lives in speaks of it as ' my house,' but that does not mean that he is the owner. With regard to Sheikh Sagar's letter of the 11th October, 1902 (First British Memorandum, Appendix 7), the German Government remark : ' In order to understand the letter, it would be interesting to know the purport of Kemball's enquiry, to which Sakar's letter was an answer, and which is not printed in the memorandum.' The letter from Colonel Kemball referred to was in the following terms :— ' A report has reached me that you wish to grant a concession to Haji Nakhoda All Ahmed ■Saleh for excavating and exporting red oxide8 from the island of Sir Abu Nuair. I have there fore the honour to inform you that it would be advisable for you to let me see the draft of the concession before concluding the arrangements. ' 1 shall also be glad if you will let me see a copy of the concession granted to Haji Nakhoda All for working the red oxide mines on the island of Abu Musa.' It will thus be seen that the arguments based by the German Government on conjectures as to pp- 7, &amp; the words used by Colonel Kemball fall to the ground. Colonel Kemball's only object was to offer advice to the sheikh (as it was his duty to do) as to the terms of any concession he might propose to grant. This was the more necessary as Nakhoda Ali was a person of doubtful character (see Appendix 9). The sheikh replies that Colonel Kemball was mistaken in supposing that Nakhoda Ali was one of the con cessionnaires, and states quite accurately the circumstances of the grant, including the fact that Salim made it as Regent. His Majesty's Government are unable to agree with the German Government that ' it cannot P- &amp;■ be inferred from this letter that Salim was acting only as Regent'; the fact is stated in the plainest terms, and strong corroboration is derived from the phrase used in Esa's letter to Sheikh Sagar dated the 20th February, 1907 (Appen dix 27)—'the lease which I and two partners acquired from the Government relating to the extraction of red oxide from your of Abu Musa.' With regard to the suggestion that the statement that Salim cultivates in the island p. 8. implies that he was the owner of it, His Majesty's Government would only remark that if this contention is correct every tenant is the owner of the land he holds. No inference can be drawn from the quotation from the Administration p. 7 Eepoft on the Persian Gulf, which appears to be based on incomplete information. The locality of the mines is not stated, and the erroneous state ment is made that Nakhoda Ali was the lessee, while it is expressly stated that further enquiry will be made. With regard to the statement alleged to have been made on the 28th November, 1907, by p. g. Sagar on the subject of the treaty of 1892, the account of the conversation which the sheikh gave to His Majesty's Government soon after it took place does not tally with that contained in165' tlje Second German Memorandum, and His 'Majesty 's Government cannot accept that account as accurate. As the German Government are no doubt aware, and as will be shown later, the dragoman Mirza Hussein has now been shown to be a person on whose statements no reliance can be placed; further, he could not speak Arabic, and the interpreter was Abdullah-bin-Hassan-Samieh, Hassan Samieh's son, a person who was interested in putting such a statement into the sheikh 's mouth. 8 - His Majesty's Government are disposed to agree that the meaning of the sentence in the sheikh's letter ' and the lease has remained up till now ' is probably that Sagar acquiesced in the conces sion when he returned from Mecca, as is stated by both the sheikhs (First British Memorandum, Appendices 1 and 5). At the time the letter was written nothing had occurred to make Sagar con sider the cancellation of the concession advisable. pp- 8 ' s - His Majesty's Government cannot agree that Sagar's statement that he voluntarily assigned the rent of 250 French reals to Salim is ■' an ex parte statement for which there is no proof' ; it is evidence of the best kind, and is supported by Salim's statement, ' When I leased the mines of Abu Musa I was officiating on jour behalf, and the concession was given by proxy for you' (First British Memorandum, Appendix 1), which shows clearly that Salim would not have received the rent from the mines if it had not been granted p. 9. him by Sagar. The alleged facts with which the statement is said to be inconsistent are considered below. His Majesty's Government would point p. a. out that the phrase ' the amount previously promised or to a lit ' is an incorrect reproduction of Sagar's words; the Arabic is ' wa ziyadeh,' and over ' or ' and more.' p. 9. The suggestion made by the German Govern ment that Sheikh Sagar's right to pasturage on Abu Musa may be merely a servitude to which the private property in the island is subject is entirely unsupported by evidence, and is not borne out by Major Cox's report (First British Memorandum, Appendix 6), to which reference is made). [926] D10 The German Government enquire why, under P- &amp; the arrangement of 1884, the revenue of Sir Abu Nuair was given to Salim to increase his pension, and not that of Abu Musa, which would have been more convenient, as he resided in the island. The suggestion is that the revenue of Abu Musa already belonged to Salim as owner. The answer is that it would have been useless to give Salim the revenue of Abu Musa, because at that time the island produced no revenue at all. This is shown by an extract from a letter written on the 14th October, 1880, to the British agent by the Residency agent, who, speaking of Abu Musa, says : ' Its water has altogether become salt, and the trees have died away. He (the Sheikh of Shargah, then Sheikh Salim) 'does not get anything from the place, not even a 4 gaz'' (a small copper coin). It is now proposed to consider the fresh evidence adduced by the German Government in support of the contention that Sheikh Salim is the owner of Abu Musa. It is asserted that Salim has always exercised P- 9 - the right to wreckage on Abu Musa.' His Majesty's Government are not concerned to enquire whether the statement made is adequately supported by the citation of two cases in which pp. 9, 35, such a right has been claimed, because, even assuming the statement to be correct, it furnishes no evidence whatever of the ownership of Salim. The right to wreckage, or jetsam and flotsam, is exercised.in the Persian Gulf by the inhabitants of the place where the wreckage is cast up, and if the ruling chief comes to hear of it he is entitled to a share, which he exacts or not as he sees fit. In the case of Abu Musa the right to wreckage was exercised not by Salim alone, but by him in conjunction with the other inhabitants of the island, so that any argument in favour of Salim's ownership, based on the right to wreckage, would be an equally good argument in favour of the ownership of all the inhabitants. In support of this statement the following documents are- adduced :— Letter dated the 17th May, 1894, from the Residency agent, Shargah, to the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, relating to the stranding of a Bahrein boat on Abu Musa (Appendix 1). Replies to above, 22nd June, 1894 (Appendix 2),11 Letter dated the 14th April, 1907, from the Residency agent, Shargah, to the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, relating to the stranding of the British Indian Steam Navigation Company's steam-ship iS Bulimba' on Abu Musa (Appen dix 3). These letters show clearly that it was ' the islanders,' and not Salim alone, who claimed the right to wreckage; (b)that it was the Sheikh of Shargah whose position and responsibility in the matter were recognised. On the general question of the incidence of the right to wreckage, and the position and practice in regard thereto, the following evidence is sub mitted ;— Letter dated the 1st March, 1895, from the Political .Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Assistant Resident, Bunder Abbas (Appendix 4). Statement by Sheikh Sag at. dated the 25th March, 1911 (Appendix 5). Questions put to, and replies received from, the following sheikhs and notables of the coast:—- Muhammad-bin-Tahnoon, agent of the Sultan of Muscat at Lingah (Appendix 6). Sheikh Saleh- bin-Muhammad-el-Ali, Chief of Charak. Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Abdullah-el-Hamadi, Chief of Merbakh and Mugam, of the Arab tribe of Hammadi. Sheikh Ahmed-bm-Muhammad-el-Ali, Headman of Keis Island, of the Sunni Arab tribe of A1 Ali. Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Majed-el-Marzooki, Head man of Bustaneh, of the Sunni Arab tribe of Marzuk. Sheikh Khalfan-bin Misbah-el-Ali, Headman of Dourvan, of the Sunni Arab tribe of Al Ali, Sheikh Sultan-bin-Ahmed-Marzooki, Chief of Moghu, of the tribe of Marzuk. Sheikh Abdulla h - bin - Muhammad -el - Abei deli, Chief of Armeki and Cheeroe, of the Sunni Arab tribe of Obaidli. Sheikh Ibrahim-bin-Abdullah-el-Hnmadi, Chief of Kelat, of the Hammadi tribe. Haji Ali-bin-Abdullah, a well-known merchant of Keis. Haji Isa-bin-Saleh, a well-known and reliable merchant of Keis.X : 2 Haji Muhammad-bin - Hydar, a well-krrowp merchant of Keis.

Haji Muhammad-biti-Hassan-el- M eithoomi-el- Marzook; a leading merchant of Bustaneh. (Appendices 7 and 8.) The effect of this overwhelming body of evidence is to show clearly that the right to wreckage is exercised by the inhabitants of the locality,, subject to the right of the chief to claim a share if he sees fit to do so. No evidence of Salim's ownership can therefore be deduced from the fact of his exercising such a right; if Salim claimed and exercised the chiefs right to a share, it would be by virtue of Sheikh Sagar's permitting him to occupy the island, and any income which he derived from such a source would form part of the revenue of the island, which he was permitted by the sheikh to enjoy. It may also be remarked, with reference to the terms of Salim's letter of the 23rd March, 1898 (Second German Memorandum, p. Annex 6), that at that time Salim was acting as Regent, and probably wrote the letter in that capacity. The German Government nest refer to a version pp of the oxide agreement (Second German Memo- PP randurn, Annex 7), dated the 6th April, 1898, which was cancelled four days later, and for which another agreement (Second German Memorandum, Annex 8) was substituted. This first agreement contained the words ' So long as I, my children, and my brothers live, no one shall have a right to raise objections to it.' These words were omitted from the second agreement, and it is suggested that the use of such words clearly shows that Salim was the owner of the island. The position is thus as follows :— An agreement is drawn up.13 C Tt is immediately cancelled, and a fresli one Substituted. Certain expressions which appear in the first agreement are not found in the second. His Majesty's Government consider that the irresistible inference to be drawn from such facts is that the omitted expressions were objected to as inaccurate or misleading, and that for that reason the agreement was cancelled. His Majesty's Oovernment are in a position to show that such was the case. Abdul Latif has explained (Ap pendix 9) that the original agreement was drafted by Abdullah-bin-Hassan Samieh, and was shown by him to Abdul Latif, who at once objected (a) to the use of the expression now under discussion - (b) to the inclusion of Nakhoda Ali as a signatory. The draft was accordingly cancelled and a fresh agreement drawn up, in which the objectionable expressions were omitted. The original draft was never seen by Sheikh Sagar Until it was shown to him a short time affo (Appendix 5). So far, then, from the use of the expressions referred to being evidence of Salim's ownership, their omission from the second agreement is strong evidence against it. Reference is also made to the clause in the second agreement providing for a payment for the trade in 'mother-of-pearl and canary-seed.'* It is suggested that this is ' inconsistent with Sheikh Sagar's statement that he had granted to Salim only the rent of the oxide mines.' It has been pointed out above that Sheikh Sagar has never made the statement attributed to him ; what he did say was that he had granted to Salim the revenue of the island, which of course included this payment in connection with oysters. Nor can any inference be drawn from the fact that the agreement under which Sagar became a partner provided that he should be responsible for a proportional part of this payment. The syndicate derived their rights from the document of the 10th April, 1898, under which both the annual rent and this special payment were secured, and any person entering the syndicate * It may be observed that the Arabic word translated 'canary-seed' more probably refers to a kind of oyster. [926] E14 would of course be as responsible for his share of the second as of the first. Sheikh Sagar, having assigned the revenue from this source to Salim, naturally, on becoming a partner in the syndicate, had to pay his proportion of it to him ; but it is impossible to conclude from that fact that ' Salim had a right to the enjoyment in his own name of all sources of profit to be derived from Abu Musa, and that he could exercise this right even as against the ruling sheikh.' He had the right because it had been granted to him by the ruling sheikh, and when the ruling sheikh became a partner in a syndicate which 'was under contract to pay rent, which rent had been granted to Salim, he was of course bound, in bis capacity as such partner, to pay to Salim his proportion of such rent. Even if the rent had been payable to himself, his share of it would of course have been debited to him ia the partnership books. The object of the insertion of the clause in question was no doubt to make it clear that the liabilities of the other partners were proportionately reduced. The German Government also rely on the fact that on the 26th December, 1898, Salim granted a lease of the mica deposits on the island. The fact is not disputed ; it is clear that the lease was granted after Sheikh Sagar had relinquished to Salim the revenue of the island, and it appears from Sagar's statement (Appendix 5) that £&gt;alim consulted him about it, and that in pursuance of his declared policy he allowed Salim to keep any payments made on account of the mica as part of the revenue derived from the island. Saear ' . O- would no doubt welcome any arrangements which would increase Salim's income and prevent his making applications for money. Little attention has been paid to this transaction, because it was soon discovered that no mica existed on the island, and the concession accordingly became a dead letter. When Sagar wrote his letter of the 22nd February, 1908, he had no doubt, as he states (Appendix 5), forgotten all about this concession, granted ten years before, and long since abandoned. The draft memorandum of association sent by Abdul Latif to Hassan Samieh on the 6th January, 1899, will be considered later. The fact that Salim stipulated in the mica lease that only keshkesliuh trees should be cut is no evidence of his ownership. He was admittedly in occupation of the island, and was therefore I p, 10. pp. 10, 37, i3 b IL- §15 entitled to see , that acts of waste were not com mitted thereon. With reference to the letter dated the 12th November, 1898, from Abdul Latif to Hassan Samieh (Annex 15 to Second German Memo randum), in which reference is made to a dispute between the two sheikhs about the island of Sir, the position (which, indeed, is obvious) is explained by Abdul Latif (Appendix 10). Under the 1884 agreement between Sagar and Salim (see Appendix 6, First British Memorandum) the revenue of Sir was assigned to Salim. The island, however, failed to produce any revenue, and in the 1889 agreement (see Appendix 6, fcirst British Memorandum), no mention was made of it, the revenue of Abu Musa being subsequently transferred to Salim in its place. When the possibility arose in 1898 of Sir pro ducing some revenue, Salim put in a claim to it under the agreement of 1884, to which Sagar not unnaturally replied that the 1884 agreement had been superseded by that of 1889, in which Sir was not mentioned. Thus arose the dispute referred to. Abdul Latil was naturally unwilling to conclude the Sir agreement until the dispute had been adjusted; he would have no hesitation about Abu Musa, not because he knew that Salim owned it, but because he was well aware that Sheikh Sagar was allowing him to enjoy its revenue. linally, the German Government state that the opinion prevailing among the most respectable natives is that Abu Musa is the private property of k. neikh Salim. In support of this assertion there are quoted the opinions of three merchants of Lingab, two of whom are also stated to have asserted verbally that everyone who has any knowledge of affairs on the Arabian coast is of the same opinion. His Majesty's Government regret that they are unable to attach the slightest weight to the opinions of the persons in question. Abdalmuhsin-ibn-Ahmed Almushari is a petty trader of Bahrein origin He earns a precarious livelihood by speculating in pearls with borrowed money. Abdarrahman ibn-Muhanuned-ibn-Kaizim aPersian of Bastak. It is Irue tKat he was at one time French consular agent at Ltngah, but in 1909 he was dismissed by the French consul, who had had occasion to complain of him. In 1907' he was proceeded against by the Customs for smuggling a large quantity of tobacco, and he has recently been complained against for unlawfully flying the French flag on a dhow. Hamd-ibn-Khalifa ATuyuni was a petty mer chant, but went bankrupt, and afterwards endeavoured to make a living as a news-writer by writing gossip to various notables in the Gulf, and getting occasional presents from them. He recently died insolvent. As against testimony of this nature, His Majesty's Government bring forward the evidence of nineteen sheikhs, merchants, and notables of the Persian Gulf, who are familiar with the affairs of the district. The names of these persons have been given above, and their statements are set out in Appendices 6, 7, and 8. They state that the owner of Abu Musa is the Sheikh of Bhargah, now Sheikh Sagar. His Majesty's Government agree that Salim, p with the consent of Sheikh Sagar, exercised (from the date of the arrangement made after the grant of the oxide concession) the full right of disposal of the usufruct of the island. This right was de rived from the permission granted to him by the owner, Sheikh Sagar. It is denied that he exercised the right 45 as against' Sagar, except in so far as the latter, while a partner in the syndicate, was responsible for the payment of his proportion of the rent. Finally, His Majesty's Government would enquire how it is suggested that Salim obtained his title to the island. His right to it as Sheikh of Shargah was lost when he was deposed ; and if the contention is that he had any other title there should be in existence documents of title or other evidpnee showing whence it was derived. No such evidence has been produced. Having thus examined the objections raised to the evidence brought forward in support of Sheikh17 'Sagar's title, as Sheikh of Shargah, to the property in the island, and having considered the further evidence and arguments adduced in favour of the claim made on behalf of Sheikh Salim ( though not endorsed by him), His Majesty's Government are compelled to adhere to their conclusion that Sheikh Sagar is the owner of Abu Musa. pp. 27, 28, (h.)Salim not being the owner of Abu Musa, and the revenue of the island not having been transferred to him at the time of the grant of the concession, he had no right, either accordifig to commercial or Mahommedan or any other system of law, to grant a lease of the oxide mines, except in his capacity as Regent, The lease having been acquiesced in by Sheikn Sagar when he returned and took up the reins of government, he succeeded to the position occupied by Salim with regard to the agreement, except that he allowed Salim to receive the rent as part of the revenue of Abu Musa. The question of the validity of the lease will be more conveniently discussed under the next head. n. p. 28. The owner &lt;of the i mat/ no authority, agreement (which com- mercial law), or revoke or terminat company or to other way from p. 12. His Majesty's Government are unable to accept the contention of the German Government that Sheikh Sagar had no right to terminate the agreement. Quite apart from the terms of the concession, he had, as ruling sheikh, absolute power to cancel it at any time he thought fit If this were not so, the words used by Salim, in his capacity of Regent, in the agreement of the 10th April, 1898. ' Should I at any former date have made any contracts they are not valid, only this contract, which is written in two identical copies, holds good' (First German Memorandum, Annex 2) would be meaningless, and any previous contracts would be valid as against the present concession- naires- His jurisdiction within his own dominions [926] FIS could not be questioned, and if the concessionnaircst, who at the time of the cancellation were all British subjects, considered themselves aggrieved, their only remedy was to apply to the British Govern ment, in order that representations might be made to the slieikh through the Residency. This they have never done. His Majesty's Govern ment maintain that Sheikh Sagar's right to determine any concession granted in his dominions (a right which would exist even if the island were the private property of Salim) could not legally be questioned, and, indeed, this is admitted by the statement on p. 14 of the Second German Memorandum that ' the reigning Sheikh of ^ Shargah is the absolute ruler of his country.' If by a high-handed and unfair use of this right British subjects had suffered loss, they could only obtain redress by an appeal to their Govern ment, in which case the matter would be solely one between the sheikh and His Majesty's Government. This being the case, it is unnecessary to discuss further the meaning of the terms in the agree ment. His Majesty's Government find it difficult p. 12. to decide what was the reason for omitting the time limit of twenty years in the second agree ment, as the meaning of Abdul Latif's statement (Appendix 9) that he ' saw no object in inserting 5 , any fixed period of time ' is not clear ; but they would remark that if the effect of the agreement really was that the lessees were entitled to put an end to the lease at any time, while the lessor was bound to allow them to work the mines in per petuity, should they so desire, in return for a rent of 20L per annum, the arrangement was most inequitable. For the same reason His Majesty's Government are of opinion that the case is not one to which the principles of either the commercial or religious law can usefully be applied. But as the German Government produce evidence of this nature on which they rely in support of their contention that the lease was valid and could not be cancelled, it is proposed to deal with the point. The German Government produce opinions PP- *3,14, given by ' the leading merchants at Lingah and Bussorah,' who state that the lease is good and19 valid, and cannot be terminated without the consent of the lessees. His Majesty's Government are unable to agree as to the weight to be attached to the opinion of these merchants; their reasons for considering that no importance can be attached to the opinions of Hamd-ibn-Khalifa Al'uyuni, Abdarrahman-ibn- Muhammed - ibn - Kazim, and Abdaimuhsin - ibn- Ahmed-ibn-Mushari have been explained above. 'W ith regard to the other merchants whose opinions are quoted, His Majesty's Government cannot Irom the information at their disposal accept the description of them given in the German Memorandum. Abdullah Muhammed Hassan-al-Khodja is a member of a family which is ill-disposed to the authorities, and his testi mony is open to suspicion. AbduUah-ibn-Hassan- Kalladari is a close friend of Hassan Samieh, and agent of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. The signatories of the document which appears as Annex 24, are Turkish subjects from Bussorah. whose views on such a matter are of little weight, and as they erroneously state that the 'agree ment was concluded in the land of Persia,' their opinions appear to be- founded on a wrong assumption. In refutation of this evidence the opinions are- submitted of ten representative merchants from different parts of the littoral (Appendix 11), who are unanimously of opinion that the lease is void, because it lacks both the specification of period and the pronunciation of the legal formula of proposal and acceptance, which are essential features of such documents. With regard to the contention that by religious law surface mines are the common property of all Mahomrnedans, and that an indefeasible right is acquired by the mere fact of working them, TT I h Majesty's Government are somewhat surprised that such an argument should be seriously put forward at the present day. It may be that the clergy of Islam continue in theory to support this ancient tenet, but it is a matter of common know ledge that it is now entirely disregarded, and no attempt could possibly be made to give effect to it in practice.20 His Majesty's Government would remark, with reference to the opinions of the clergy submitted by the German Government, that it will be seen that several of them, on their attention being called to the grounds on which His Majesty's Government contend that the lease is invalid, declared that such a contention was correct. His Majesty's Government submit a body of evidence from, distinguished members of the clergy (Ap pendices 12, 13, and 14), including the chief priests of Lingah and Bushire, both Sunni and Shiah. The effect of this evidence is to show clearly:— 1. That the lease was invalid for several specific reasons: (a.) The failure to insert the usual formula of proposal and acceptance. (h.) The failure to specify the period of the lease. (c.) The failure to specify the amount of profit to be derived by the lessee (Appendix 12), 2, That the lessor is therefore entitled to cancel the lease and eject the lessee (Appendices 13 and 14). His Majesty's Government are therefore of opinion— 1. That Sheikh Sagar had, as ruling sheikh, an inherent right to cancel the concession, if he saw fit to do so ; 2. That if the principles of either commercial or religious law are to be applied to the case, the lease was invalid, and could therefore be annulled. The German Government are mistaken in pp. u, 15. stating that 'The British memorandum further remarks that the principal object of Sagar was to administer justice as between the partners of the company on the strength of his 'sovereign rights of jurisdiction.'' The statement made in the First British Memorandum (p. 26) was ' The principal motive of the Sheikh of Shargah cancelling, in accordance with sovereign rights of jurisdiction, the lease granted in his behalf by the Regent in 1898 was evidently21 a proper and natural desire to administer justice as between the partners of the company . . , ' The contention of His Majesty's Government is, and always has been, that the sovereign rights of jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Shargah gave him the right to cancel the concession. The word jurisdiction was not meant to imply judicial jurisdiction, but the right of government. The 15. questions therefore whether the sheikh had authority to decide as judge the dispute between the partners of the mining company,' ' whether the decision arrived at was justified by law,' and ' whether he had power to cancel the lease at his discretion in the interest of the administration of country ' are strictly irrelevant. In view of the careful consideration, however, given in the Second German Memorandum to these points, they will be dealt with in their proper place. III. P- 28. (a.) HassanSamaih the mining comp like that with Mr. name of the co other partners. became binding (b.) in the case under con their approval This point will be conveniently considered under two heads, (a) and (6). ,p. 21. (a.) The German Government argue that the wide dispersal of the partners rendered it necessary that one of the partners should have authority to act for the others. His Majesty's Government agree that it is not unlikely that such an arrange ment would be made as regards the ordinary incidents of business, although there is nothing to show that such an arrangement was made, or, if it was, that Hassan Samieh was the partner selected to act on behalf of the others; but the question now at issue is whether Hassan Samieh had authority, without consulting his partners, to conclude an agreement such as the present, which disposed of practically the whole output of the mines, at a fixed price, for four years, with an option of renewal, and limited the annual output of the mines to a maximum of 5,000 tons and the further small amount which was allowed to go to [926] G22 India. Such an agreement was entirely outside the ordinary incidents of the partnership business, and it would require strong evidence to show that. Hassan was in a position to enter into it without the knowledge or consent of his associates, especially as there was no need to carry matters through in a hurry, and the short delay necessary to enable the other partners to be consulted would not have prejudiced the conclusion of the agree ment, provided that they had raised no objection. The principal evidence on which the German p. 21. Government rely consists of an unsigned document pp. 39, 40. (Annex 14 to Second German Memorandum), purporting to be a memorandum of association between the lessees, the first clause of which is alleged to give power to Hassan Samieh to con clude sales on behalf of the partnership. This document is said to have been drawn up by Abdul p. Latif, and sent by him in a letter dated the 6th January, 1899 (Annex 13 to Second German pp. 38, 39. Memorandum), to Hassan Samieh, with a request that all the partners at Lingah should sign. It is further alleged that the document was signed p. 21. by Hassan Samieh,, Abdullah, and Nakhoda All, who added a clause providing for the purchase of boats, and returned the document to Abdul Latif. On the 21st January, 1S99, Abdul Latif wrote a letter to Hassan Samieh (Annex 40 to Second pp. 56, 57. German Memorandum), in which he objected to pp. 21, 22. the purchase of boats. Hassan Samieh then replied agreeing to,the cancellation of the boats, and thereupon the. arrangement is said to have become operativei. No evidence, except Abdul Latif's two letters, is produced in support of the statements .made. It appears from Abdul Latif's second letter that when Hassan Samieh and his partners at Lingah returned the document to Abdul Latif, with the additional clause about the boats they made certain other suggestions in a covering letter. Abdul Latif objected to these suggestions as well as to the provision about the boats, and, there is no ground for alleging that the arrange-. ment became operative merely because Hassan agreed to waive the provision about boats. It is not suggested by the German Government that the memorandum was ever signed by the other partners. Sheikh Sagar, Esa-bin-Abdul Latif, and Mr. Malcolm, who, as stated on p. 12 of the Second German Memorandum, was&lt; a partner in the company, but who had entered it, not ' twoox. 23 years after the conclusion of the lease agreement,' but on the 27th December, 1898 (see Appendix 16). It is hardly necessary to remark that no such document could be binding on the partnership unless signed by all the partners, and that there fore the document is valueless. The mere fact that clause 6 of the memorandum, to which Abdul Latif objected, and which Hassan Samieh, p. 21. according to the Second German Memorandum, was willing to cancel, was never struck out, but appears in the document as now produced, shows conclusively that the memorandum was never completed or executed, and consequently never came into operation. This is also shown by the fact that no accounts have ever been rendered to the partners who were not at the mines (see Appendix 17), whereas under clause 9 of the alleged memorandum this had to be done every four months. A further statement by Abdul Latif is annexed (Appendix 15) which shows clearly what occurred. After Abdul Latif's letter of the 21st January, 1899, objecting to several of the suggested pro visions, the matter dropped. The document was never completed or signed by the remaining partners, and was never even shown to Sheikh Sagar. It has never been seen by Nejef (Appen dix 22). Mr. Malcolm states (see Appendix 17) that, to the best of his belief, he never saw or heard of the so-called memorandum, and certainly never signed it. In any event, even if the document were taken as being in force, there is nothing in its terms which would justify Hassan in entering into contracts, other than ordinary sales, with out consulting his partners. The contract with Wonckhaus cannot be regarded as an ordinary sale, because (apart from the small shipments to India) it prevented the sale of oxide to any other person, and because, in effect, it would necessarily have limited the output to the amount taken by Wonckhaus and the purchasers in India. This document, then, having never come into force, the only agreement governing the affairs of the partnership was that dated May 1898 (First German Memorandum, Annex 2), under which Hassan Samieh had no such powers as suggested. The manner in which the affairs of the partner ship were conducted is shown in Mr. Malcolm's .statement (Appendix 17). It is, of course, not24 disputed that Hassan did attend to part; of the business of the company, as did some of the other p- 23, partners, hut that fact has no bearing on the question whether he had authority to make the contract in question. The same comment may be made on the letters from Mr. Malcolm to Hassan, PP- o7 ~ 59 '' on which reliance is placed by the German P- -3- Government; in fact, the first two letters are clear evidence that Hassan did not consider him self entitled to act without consulting his partners. The third letter is specifically addressed to the fum, and not to Hassan, and there is no evidence to show how it was dealt with. His Majesty's Government are unable to agree that the proposed contract was ' very similar to that with Wonck- p. 23. bans,' but do not consider the point worth detailed discussion. No inference in favour of the conten tion of the German Government can be drawn from these letters. Esa's letter to Sheikh Sagar, dated the 20th February, 1907 (Appendix 27), shows that he did not consider that Hassan possessed the authority now claimed for him, and four letters from Hassan Samieh are annexed (Appendix 18), which show that Hassan considered himself under an obligation to consult his partners, and knew that they were entitled to complain if he failed to do so. The phrase in Hassan's letter of the 21st January, 1908, 'You know what friendship existed between us and your father, Haji AH, deceased, who did nothing except after consultation in our business,' suggests that, if one partner was more prominent than the others, it was Nakhoda Ali, and not Hassan. Hassan's own contention throughout has been, not that he had authority to conclude the- con tract without consulting his partners, but that they approved of it. In his letter to Abdul Latif (Annex 11 to First German Memorandum) he says: 'You are the Lord of the Learned ; you know that I did this knowing that you were agreeable to it.' In his letter to Salim (Annex 18 to First German Memorandum) he says: 'As you know, all the contracts and correspondence from the beginning till this day have been done bv knowledge and approval of the British political agent, Abdul Latif, and all of you.' This shows that at the time he did not claim lor himself the right which is now attributed to him. In conclusion, His Majesty's Government would remark that, if Hassan really possessed the right•.£5 conclude the contract without consulting his par tners, it is difficult to understand his attempts to i..on^eai it from thena, and to deceive them as to its terms. ^ ih.) 1 'he German Government also contend that ail the partners expressly approved the agreement. P. 16. The persons concerned (omitting Abdullah, * ho may be assumed to have supported his rather) are Esa, Malcolm, and JSTejef, son of Nakhoda Ali. T3ae German Government dispute that Nejef was a partner, arguing that Kakhoda Ali 'had a share on the strength of his engaging to super intend the work at the mines, without putting capital into the concern,' that his partnership was connected with personal services, and there fore ceased at his death. This contention is not supported by the terms of .the document under which he became a partner (Annex 2 to First German Memorandum), which placed him in precisely the same position as the other- partners. Moreover, as it is pointed out on p. 18 of the Second German Memorandum that the only partners who put any capital into the concern were Hassan and Malcolm, it follows, if the contention of the German Government is correct, that the other partners, who neither put- capital into the concern nor superintended the work at the mines, had no claim to their shares at all. The suggestion that Nakhoda Ali was not p. 17. a partner, but,only an 'employ^ of the company with,a share in the profits,' is plainly untenable, in view of the provision in the document under which he became a partner (Annex 2 to First German Memorandum) that he was to bear his share of the expenses—an unheard-of pro vision m the pase of an employe. It appears from Malcolm's statement (Appendix 17) that Nakhoda Ali was originally the most important member of the firm; and reference may also be made to the sentence quoted above from Hassan's letter to Nejef, dated the 21st January, 1908. pp. 17, 50. The suggestion made by Abdul Latif, that it ' might be possible to extinguish Nakhoda Ali's snare at his death on the grounds indicated must have come to nothing, judging bv the later documents as if the surviving partners had thought it possible to get rid of the share in such a way, they would certainly have done so [926] ' ' H26 It may be that Hassan and Abdullah now con- p- aider it advisable to deny that they considered Nejef a partner, but their letters written at the time (Appendices 18 and 19) show clearly that they did so consider him. The letters of Hassan, in particular, which are set out in Appendix 18, are conclusive on the point. Particular atten tion is also called to the letter dated the 24th December, 1907, from Malcolm, annexed in Appendix 20, which shows that at that time both Malcolm and Abdu l ib recognised Nejef as a partner. If Nejef was not and never had been, a partner, the suggestion that he on several occasions p- expressed his approval of Hassan's proceedings is meaningless; there would be no possible reason for his expressing an opinion on the matter if it did not concern him. Nejef is asserted to have expressed his approval P to Abdullah in the presence of the German dragoman in November 1907. No authority is given for this statement. Abdullah's motives for attributing such a statement to Nejef are obvious, and His Majesty's Government have explained already that they are unable to attach any weight to statements made by the ex-dragoman Mirza Hussein, who, as the German Government are no doubt aware, has now been denounced by the Persian Government, prosecuted by the Customs and Messrs. Wonckhaus for dishonesty, and dis missed from his post in the German consulate. Nejef has sworn an affidavit (Appendix 21) in which he denies having made the statement attributed to him, and his account is corrob orated by the letter written shortly afterwards by Malcolm, which is set out in Appendix 20, and also by Nejef's petition to Lieutenant Gabriel dated the 16th February, 1908 (First British Memorandum, Appendix 18). These documents also show plainly that Nejef was recognised as' a partner. With regard to the statement said to have been made by Nejef to Brown (an employ^ of Wonck haus and Co.) in March 1908, to the effect that he approved of the contract with Wonckhaus, the story is incredible, in view of the fact that a month before 'Nejef had sent in a formal petition to the British vice-consul at Bunder Abbas (First British Memorandum, Appendix 18) stating that he ' did not in any way agree to this contract made by Hassan.' Nejef's account of the inter-I f 21 as given by him on oath, is set out in Appeucdx 21. i&gt;ut even if the story were true, it would not affect the fact that in February 1908 Aejef expressed his disapproval in the most formal method at his disposal. In any case His Majesty's Government are unable to consider an expression of approval, given long after the cancellation of the concession, as equivalent to a confirmation of the contract. l8, Majesty's Government observe that the German Government do not allege that Malcolm ever expressly approved of the contract; all that is stated is tnat no objection was raised by him. ^ ithout going into the question whether a failure to raise objections could amount to the necessary approval, it must be pointed out that no inference can be drawn either from Malcolm's silence or his letters, because of Hassan's successful attempts, sjy means of falseiiood and deception, to keep him in the dark as to the facts. When asked by Malcolm for a copy of the agree ment, he first made the untrue statement that the agreement was in German, and then asserted that Wonckhaus had bound him to secrecy; while the account given by him in his letter of the 13th July, 1906 (First British Memorandum, Appendix 13) omitted the most important provisions of the contract. His Majesty's Government are quite unable to P- 18. agree that this letter ' communicated all that was of importance'; the very provisions to which the other partners took objection when they heard of them were carefully omitted. P- I8 - This argument is also inconsistent with the further contention of the German Government that Hassan was entitled to keep the terms of the contract secret from Malcolm, because the latter was connected with Strick and Co.. who held the Hormuz oxide concession. His Majesty's Government are unable to appreciate this contention, and in any case it is clear from Hassan's letter of the 14th October, 1906 (First British Memorandum, Appendix 14), that the person he really wished to keep in the dark was Abdul Latif, who had repeatedly warned him against making a contract of such a nature, p. 51. In his letter of the 30th October, 1906 (Annex 34 to Second German Memorandum) Malcolm expressly protests against the terms of the agree-28 raent being kept secret from the partners. This letter also expressly recognises the possibility of the cancellation of the contract by the partners, if they considered it advisable. When Malcolm did ultimately receive a copy of the agreement in December 1906, the contract was already six months old, and while he was still considering what action to take the situation was completely changed by the cancellation of the concession by the sheikh. His Majesty's Government do not dispute the p- 19*- fact that Abdul Latif, on behalf of Esa, did not object in 1905 to the sale of oxide to Wonckhaus at a fixed price, but, as it is not suggested that the contracts of that date contained the provisions to which he did afterwards object, it does not affect the present question. As regards his letter of the 14th June, 1906 (First British Memorandum, Appendix 12)^ His Majesty's Government, must repeat that no weight can be attached to any expression of approval (if such can be aeduced from the terms of the letter) given in ignorance of the terms of the contract. The non-disclosure of material terms would be held fatal by any court in which it was sought to rely on any such expressions of approval as constituting a ratifica tion of the contract. And the letter expressly warns Hassan against entering into any contract which would give an outside party an excuse Tor claiming rights in the island. Such warnings had been given before, and Hassan had disclaimed any intention of entering into such a contract. In addition to the documents already quoted in this connection, reference may be made to two letters from Hassan to Abdul Latif, dated respectively the 30th January, 1905, and the 5th July, 1906 (Appendix 23). No doubt Hassan's object was to conceal the terms of the contract from his partners for as long as possible, in order that when they were ulti mately discovered he might be able to say that the contract had been in operation so long that it was impossible to go back on it When Abdul Latif had an opportunity of examining the terms of the contract he objected in the plainest terms, and announced his resoru w-Oii of cancelling the contract. The German Government contend that the p. 20. sentence in Abdul Latit s letter ox the 2orcL• ^ ./ 29 pp. 52, 5 ft, January, 1907 (Annex 36 to Second German Memo randum), which has been translated &lt;&lt; the nullifi cation of this agreement is better 'than its accept ance,' really bears the meaning 'It is better to try to cancel the agreement than to do as he [the German] wishes.' In support of this contention pp. 53 -55. two opinions are quoted (Annexes 37 and 38 to Second German Memorandum) which reach this conclusion upon different grounds. Both these opinions are purely theoretical, and do not take local usage into account. His Majesty's Govern ment would point out that in Enclosure 8 to the First German Memorandum the words in question are translated ' The cession [? cessation] of this contract would be preferable to its continuance.' His Majesty's Government also bring forward, in support of their view, the opinion (Appendix 24) of the well-known missionary the Rev. S. M. Zwemer, who has laboured for some fifteen years among the Arabs of the Persian Gulf, and probably knows their local peculiarities of speech and writing better than any other living man. His opinion entirely supports the contention of His Majesty's Government. Being, however, of opinion that when the meaning to be attributed to a phrase is in question, the best evidence is that of the person who used it, His Majesty's Government annex a statement (Appendix 2 5) by Abdul Latif, which makes it clear that he used the words in the sense attributed to them by His Majesty's Government, and that such would be the ordinary meaning of the phrase as understood in those parts. The statement also shows that Hassan understood the words in that sense, and quoted them in that sense (but more grammatically and unmistakably) in his reply. This reply is set out in Appendix 26. p. 20. His Majesty's Government do not agree with the contention that Abdul Latif's letter, by re commending the cancelling of the agreement, admits that it had legal force. It is admitted that the contract was binding as between Hassan and Wonckhaus and Co., and therefore Hassan could only be released from it by cancellation; but the question at issue is whether it was bind ing on the partnership, and His Majesty's Govern ment contend that the evidence is clear that it was not. There is no doubt that Esa himself objected to the contract when he heard of its terms. This is clearly shown by his letter of the 20th February, [926] I30 1907, to Sheikh Sagar (Appendix 27), which also proves that he did not consider Hassan as having authority to conclude the contract without con sulting his partners. His Majesty's Government are therefore of opinion :— 1. That Hassan had no authority to conclude the contract in question without the consent of his partners. 2. That Nejef was a partner on the same terms as the others. 3. That neither NejefJ Malcolm, nor Esa ever approved the agreement, but, on the contrary, at least two of them, when they heard of the terms, formally expressed their disapproval. 4. That even if any expression of approval can be deduced from the terras of Abdul Latif's letter dated the 14th June, 1906;, it was given in ignor ance of the most important terms of the contract, which had been wrongfully concealed by Hassan from his partners, and that on hearing of those terms Abdul Latif emphatically repudiated the transaction. IV. The agreement with Mr. tageous to the mining partners have not he SamaiKs action as ma It is not considered necessary to consider again the question whether the agreement was finan cially for the benefit of the company, especially as, no accounts ever having been rendered by Hassan to his partners, it is impossible to test the accuracy of the books as now quoted. It is only necessary to remark that at least two of the partners considered that the arrangement was not advantageous to the company, and formally protested against it. It may also be added that, if it really was to the benefit of the company to enter into the contract, it becomes more difficult than ever to account for Hassan's anxiety to conceal its terms from his associates. It is possible, however, that this desire for concealment was due- to a feeling that the contract might impair the relations between the company and the sheikh, in which case it would not be to the advantage of the company, even though financially it might have led to an increased revenue.i 31 V. ihere was therefore no df the company against the ground of action or duty. This point has been discussed under the two preceding heads. VL mere was accordingly the part of Sheikh Samaih for the p partners. Moreover, ts at Lingah, and pany are not subjec bhargeh, so that he matters concerning of the partners with each could not exercise su himself _ hut should have had by judge. Although it is hardly accurate to say that Sheikh Sagar took action against Hassan, it has Deen shown that there was abundant ground for his action when appealed to on behalf of the partners whose wishes and instructions had been disregarded, and who had been deceived, by their associate Hassan, It has been already pointed out that it has never been contended by His Majesty's Govern ment (or, as is admitted on p. 15 of the Second German Memorandum, by Sheikh Sagar) that the sheikh's action in cancelling the concession was intended to be that of a judge deciding the rights of the partners as between themselves; it was an act which in his sovereign capacity he was entitled to do, and no doubt one of his objects was to release the complaining partners from the position in which they found themselves owing to the unauthorised action of Hassan. This being so, the arguments adduced in the Second German Memorandum to show that the sheikh was not the proper tribunal to adjust the rights of the partners are beside the mark. It is only neces sary to remark that, as far as the cancellation of the concession was concerned, the sheikh was the only person who could act.82 After the cancellation of the concession, the adjustment of the rights of the partners, as between themselves, by the appropriate tribunal (whatever that may prove to be) would under normal circumstances have been an easy matter. Nor is it impossible that the sheikh might have been willing to grant a fresh concession under proper conditions. But the course events have taken, in particular the intervention of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co., has so far rendered this impracticable; though when the questions now at issue have been settled it may yet be possible for steps to be taken in the matter. In any case, the pp. Ij , question whether Sagar's action violated the rights of the partners, who were all British subjects, is obviously one to be discussed, if at all, between the sheikh and His Majesty s (govern ment. VII. The agreement between the m p. 28. Mr. W onckhdus, whicli conclusion of an ordinary business transaction, and any polit ciL aims, neiih lease agreement nor is in to the interests of the State the action taken hy Sheikh So gar company eannot he justified oj the general interests of of the country. It has been already pointed out that, whether the. sheikh's action was ' justifiable' or not, it was certainly one which he had power to taKe, and could not legally be questioned. His Majesty's Government agree that the contract with W nckhaus was not strictly a letting of the p. 26. mines to him. But it is submitted that it w not unnatural that the sheikh should look with some apprehension upon the acquisition oi so large an interest in the produce of the mines by persons who were subject neither to his juris diction nor to that of the British Besident in the Persian Gulf. The German Government are aware that as late as 1904 an attempt was made to seize Abu Musa by a Belgian customs officer in the Persian service, who hauled down the sheikh's flag and hoisted the Persian standard. And it cannot be denied that the actions of Messrs. Wonckhaus have been eminently calculatedS3 to suggest th^t they were anxious to claim rights in the island and not merely in the produce ol the mines. Thus, on the 19th October, 1907, Messrs. Wonckhaus wrote to the sheikh :— ' We consider the mines and the concession fur them as a security for the advances paid, if you force Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Somayah and Co. to withdraw their coolies and representatives, we shall have to send over some men ourselves to protect our property.' When Brown and his men left for the island on the 22nd October, 1907, they took with them a German flag, which it was intended to place on the accumulations of oxide. On the 19th November, 1907, the German vice- consul at Bush ire threatened the sheikh with a claim for a lakh of rupees, and claimed for Messrs, Wonckhaus the right of direct concern in the working of the mines. His Majesty's Government entirely agree with the German Government that the question in this case is purely commercial, and not political. But p. 27. in view of the above facts, it appears that Sagar's fears were not altogether as ' senseless ' as has been suggested. For reasons already given, however. His Majesty's Government are of opinion that the question whether such considerations 'justified' the sheikh's action does not arise. VIII. p. 28. Sheikh Sahar's interference redressing a wrong all by one 'partner to the the carrying out of a he contrary to the int hut simply deprives the 'basis of its existence. The company, in which Robert Wonckhaus and thereby very seriously realisation of its object and it is not in a position obligations imposed upon No new points are raised under this head., Sheikh Sagar's action was the only one he could take with a view to putting an end to the position in which the company found itself owing to the [926j K34 action of Hassan. It may be mentioned that so far from Sheikh Sagar having ' put in his pocket P- the whole valuable object in connection with which the company was founded,' the result of his action has been that no revenue has been received from the mines from that day to this. The question whether Wonckhaus and Co. can be considered as interested in the company is considered below. It is no doubt unfortunate that the company has been unable to resume its operations since the cancellation, but, as has been pointed out above, that is not the fault of the sheikh, but is due to the course which affairs have taken. IX. v Sakar 's proceedings, then, are P- - 9 - of law— an exercise of The German Government do not suggest what law it is that was violated by Sagar's proceedings. His Majesty's Government have already pointed out that the sheikh's right to cancel the concession is one that cannot be questioned, and that it is a mistake to consider his action as an adjudication of the rights of the parties as between themselves. His Majesty's Government must also repeat, that even if Sagar's proceedings were ' a violation of law,' the question would be, under the circum stances, one which could only concern the sheikh and His Majesty's Government. His Majesty's Government regret that they are p. 29. entirely unable to recognise Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. as in any way concerned in the present question. It is clear that Messrs. 'Wonckhaus had a good cause of action for breach of contract against Hassan; or, if the contention of the- German Government were correct, that the con tract was binding on the partnership, they would have a cause of action against the partnership. They have never attempted to avail themselves of either of these remedies. It is obvious, there fore, that Messrs. Wonckhaus can have no claim against Sheikh Sagar in their capacity as parties to the contract, whether it was made with Hassan or with the mining company.35 It would appear that no serious attempt is made in the Second German Memorandum to maintain the proposition that Messrs. Wonckhaus are concerned in the matter as having purchased a share in the partnership eight months after the cancellation of the concession. Apart from the tact that the transference of a share in an extinct concession could have no legal effect, it is difficult to see what cause of action, either in contract or in tort, could exist against the sheikh, at the suit of Messrs. Wonckhaus, for cancelling a concession to which they were not parties. It is not dis puted that Messrs. Wonckhaus were aware, at the time when they purported to purchase the share, that the concession had been cancelled. Even assuming that the cancellation was unjustifiable, it cannot be disputed that it was effective, and that the concession came to an end at that time. If the cancellation was unjustifiable, it might give rise to a claim for compensation by the persons who were partners in the firm at the time, but certainly not to a claim by persons who, with full knowledge of the facts, purported to acquire a share months later. Thus, in any case, Messrs. Wonckhaus have no l and His Majesty's Government can only regard their action as an attempt to place themselves in a position which would enable them to, - bring pressure on the sheikh. It is noteworthy that an attempt was made in November 1907 to induce Nejef to transfer his share to Abdullah (see Appendix 21), and the fact that the transfer was to bear a date previous to the contract between Wonckhaus and Hassan, and therefore previous to the cancellation of the concession, suggests that the intention was to retransfer the share to Messrs. Wonckhaus. It may also be remarked that the sales of the share in question by Yussuf to Hassan, and by Hassan to Brown, were invalid in any case, because the documents of transfer did not bear the signatures of all the partners, as was neces sary under the deed by which Malcolm became a partner (see Appendix 16). The concession having been cancelled, and Hassan having disregarded the warning given him on the 3rd October, 1907, to remove his •coolies and gear within ten days, the sheikh was clearly entitled to take steps to ensure their86 removal. The action taken by His Majesty s Government to ensure that no breach ot the peace should take place was explained in the First British Memorandum. His Majesty's Government have already given PP- 29 &gt; 30 - the correct account of the proceedings when Brown attempted to land on Abu Musa. It is clear that the employes of Messrs. Wonckhaus had no right to be on the island at all, and this is admitted by the statement on p. 26 of the Second German Memorandum ; ' The stipulation that the oxide is to be delivered free on board, and the detailed arrangements concerning the quantity to be loaded daily, make it clear that Mr. Wonckhaus was not to have anything to do with the working of the mines themselves.' Thus the sheikh had a perfect right to prevent the men from landing, and no claim for compensation can possibly be put forward on those grounds. TTia Majesty's Government are therefore of opinion that Messrs. 'Wonckhaus have no claim against Sheikh Sagar or His Majesty's Govern ment. Foreign Office., ,1911.Appendix 1. The Residency Agent, Shargah, to Politi 17, 1894. A letter readied me from the residency agent residing at Bahrein, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Chief of Bahrein regarding a jolly boat belonging to one of Sheikh Isa's subjects, named Mohamed-bin-Saleh-bin-Jeba,ra, which stranded on the Isle of Abu Musa. Your servant endeavoured to release the jolly boat from the hands of the inhabitants of Abu Musa for the sum of 70 dollars; at the time Mohamed-bin-Saleh- bin-Jebara was present with me the inhabitants of Abu Musa refused, but [would] only accept half [of the value of the boat and cargo], according to custom. Mohamed-bin- Saleh-bin-Jebara departed from Bahrein to inform his chief [and point out] that should he desire to entreat the Chief of Shargah on account of friendship or [for] other reason [the latter would release it]. When the [Bahrein] agent's letter reached me I returned an answer according to what had passed on this subject, but no reply has come [to it]. According to what is noticed by me [i.e.], that the inhabitants of Abu Musa voyage in the jolly boat and convey cargo, it has become necessary to inform you, as probably that an accident may befall the boat. It is better that the owners of the jolly boat should strive to release the boat. Bahrein agent's letter, a copy of the Chief of Bahrein's letter are enclosed. Appendix 2.

I beg to state that the chief officer of the British Indian Steam Navigation Company's steam-ship 'Bulimba' came to me on the 1st April, 1907, reporting that the steamer had stranded on the Bu Island and asking me to notify the Shargah merchants to send lighters to Bu Musa for the purpose of landing the cargoes they had [92G] ^ L38 onboard her. I notified the merchants accordingly. The olncer theii proceeded to Dehai to meet the ship's agent, Mohamed-bin-Ibrahim, and arrange for the clispatc i lighters to Bu Musa. I was informed by the officer that the islanders had not agreed to render the vessel any assistance unless they received half the cargo. ^ + The agent, Mohamed Ibrahim, having asked me for assistance to be rendeied tu the Steamer, I sent with him my brother, Maaraj bin-Abdul Rahman, to Bu iViusa &amp;Ht the islanders may do something irregular towards the ship's crew and the cargo, wuic* it may be desirable to discharge on the island in order to launch the vessel. 1 tou.i likewise a letter from the Chief of Shargah to the islanders ordering taem to reliam from raising objections against the ship's crew, and to give them such help as they can. However, by God's grace and the company's good fortune, the sea remained calm and waveless while the vessel was stranded until arrangements were made for launching her. According to Maaraj's report to me. His Majesty's ship ' Highflyer had visiteu Bu Musa just as the stranded vessel was being launched. lhank Goa nothing unpleasant occurred in the vessel's stranding, but if a storm had taken place she woiud have incurred some damage having stranded on hard rock. A ppendix 4. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to B Residency Bushire, 1, 1905. I have the honour to reply to your letter of the 14th February, 1905, regarding salvage fees. 1 would first observe that the usual local custom is for the Nakhuda of a boat in distress to apply to the local authorities or people for assistance and to agree with them on the amount of salvage money. If the vessel is in serious danger, the persons rendering assistance claim half the value of the goods salved, a procedure sanctioned by local usage, but this residency has refused to recognise that they have any absolute right to demand such a share in the absence of agreement with the Nakhuda of the vessel. Local customs in this matter, as in others, depend more on ' might ' than 'right,' and efforts are always made to mulct the owiife-rs and Nakhodas of vessels as much as possible. Appendix 5. SheikhSagar-hin-KJialed-hin-Sultan (Translation.) Shargah, 1329 1911). After compliments and enquiries after your health, I beg to address you in regard to your enquiry regarding the undermentioned three points connected with the Abu Musa case : 1. You say that it is claimed that on the 12th Shaaban, 1316, after my return from the Hajj, Sheikh Salim granted to three persons an agreement for the extraction of mica from Bu Musa Island without any permission from me, and you enquire from me that if I was aware of the same, how was it that I did not mention this agreement to you on the 19th Moharram, 1326, when I presented to you a statement of my relations with Sheikh Salim in regard to the Bu Musa Island. 2. You also mention to me the question of jetsam and flotsam on the Bu Musa Island, and state that it is claimed that Sheikh Salim was receiving the income on this account; and 3. You have also shown me the translation of a paper which is claimed to be dated the 4th Zilkhadeh, 1315, and to be the first draft of the oxide contract which was altered to another form on the ISth Zilkhadeh, 1315.39 1 his is my reply with regard to three points: Spliitf f tb &gt;i miC 5 a f eem ®' t &gt; 1 was aware of it, and Sheikh. * [ T -' r 1 ? d ^ Would not haye been Possible that the said iSormed vo?, ft? without coming to my knowledge as ruling chief. But as I obtair from -} 4 f ■ '' s &gt; J , bad lett to bheikh Salim all the income which he could to this wJ aforesaid island, ana consequently I did not trouble [myself] to object r'^-irdin/mx 1 e m r' n 1 Panted to you the said statement JZt % + relations with Sheikh Salim m respect of Bu Musa, the question of this a-ffnir ^ i ^ ^ oucur to my mind at all, for, as you must be aware, the mica 0aUCe Qk *' i y hat T e I er * As re g ards . the sum of 1.500 dollars, payable by ' f 1 8 ' ^ ^T k a n ,^ a ^ ,n &gt;: ^ have no information as to how many instalments were A J'i ^ ? 0uel ! 5 ' it • oa ] il . m - &gt; did not trouble to make enquiries about the instalments, nor did 1 demand anything from Sheikh Salim on that account. It was my wish that je s ,^ a ® u so me r mg iiom it, and that he should not trouble me about his expenses. Secondly as regards the right to jetsam and flotsam on Bu Musa Island and all uhe Islands ot Kowasim, it is not open to doubt that it is due to the chief of the a-owasim, out the usual custom on the Oman coast is that the inhabitants of the place e ^? t vl if r n ^ bts on the s ? ene of the wreck, and when the chief comes to know of it he se t es tae matter according to his own opinion; sometimes he takes his own share rV f 1 S p je 1 f uS 1 and sometimes he^does not take from them. In the case of Bu Musa, as i had leit all the revenue to Sheikh Salim, I treated my right of jetsam and flotsam as a part ot the income to go to him and used to ask no questions about it. ihircuy, with regard to the rejected draft of the oxide agreement, I have now noted its wording, but had neither seen nor heard of it before. The reason for its rejection is obviously because Sheikh Salim could not write about Bu Musa in these uerms* namely ? So icng as I, my children, and roy brothers live, no one is entitled to raise objection to it.' No doubt this was the cause of the draft being chanoed. This is what was necessary to be stated, and salaams ! (L. S.) SAGAR -BIN-KHALED-BIN-SULTAN. Appendix 6. F okm I.

Note hy Khan Bahadur Ahdul Latif on the Sagar and Salim regarding Sir Abu N 27 ih Jamadi II, 1316 [November 14, 1898). Your honour enquires from me to what I referred in my letter dated the 27th Jamadi II, 1316, when I wrote the following.sentence &lt;£ As regards Sir a dispute has arisen between Sheikhs Sagar and Salim. It is Sagar's intention to lease without mentioning Salim's name and to give some advantage to Salim, but Salim would not agree to this.'' The explanation of the above passage is as follows It will be remembered that in the second agreement between Sheikh Sagar and Sheikh Salim (dated 1 884), at which my predecessor was the intermediary, Sheikh Sagar granted to Sheikh Salim an annual pension of 400 dollars together with the revenue of Sir Bu Nuair, which was expected to bring in some 200 dollars. Up to 1889, however, this island did not produce any revenue as Was expected and consequently no mention was made of it in the third agreement dated the 5th Shaaban, 1306 (1889), and Sheikh Salim ceased to take any interest in it. When, however, it became probable that the island might produce some revenue as the result of the concession alluded to in my letter to Hassan Samieh now under reference, Sheikh Salim's interest was naturally revived and he wanted to claim the revenue under the obsolete agreement of 1884, which Sheikh Sagar was altogether unwilling to agree to on the ground that under the last agreement (1889), which was now in force, the revenue of Sir Bu Nuair Island was not an item of the settlement. The sheikhs failed to come to an understanding on this point, with the result that the nroiect for the concession fell through. This is what had to be represented. 1 ^ ABDUL LATIF-BIN-ABDUL RAHMAN.

(L.S.) Confident in God the Bounteous. His slave, Mohamed Ali-bin-Muhammad Taki. {Note. —Imam Juma, the official High Priest of Bushire.) 3. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Amongst the conditions for the validity of a lease are the specifications and record of the period of the lease. Supposing, for instance, he were to say, ' I have let the house at the rate of 1 toman per mensem,' such a lease is legally null and void, and if the lessee says a prayer in such a house the prayer will be futile. And as to this question there is no difference of opinion between the distinguished ulemas, and God is aware of His precepts. Written by the humble Mohamed Ali-el-Moosevi-ed -Dehdasty-en-Nejafi. (L.S.) The hopeful Mohamed Ali-el-Moosevi. (Note. —The most venerable Shia Mullah in Bushire.) 4. It should be understood that the conditions for the validity of ^ a lease are six, oy the absence of any of which six conditions the lease is null and void. The first [is] the compact, i.e., the proposal and acceptance, intended to indicate the fact of the assumption of the profit for a fixed period in return for something specific. Secondly, the legality of the possession. Thirdly, the taking cognizance of the rent or the measure or weight or number. Fourthly, the specification of the profit by time or by46 the job. Fifthly, the retention of the profit in'possession or its' coming tinder that category [of possession]. Sixthly, the defining of the period of the lease in such a manner that it shall become neither less nor more. The subject-matter of the question [under reply], being void of certain of the conditions, namely, the compact and the period, and the cognizance of the amount of the nrofit, is not valid, and God is aware of the truth of affairs. Written by the humble Abdullah-el-Moosevi-el-Baladi. (L.S.) {Note. —The chief mullah of the Ussuli sect of Shias in Bushire.) 5. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. i he distinguished ulemas—may their blessings amongst the people endure— have defined 'lease J to be the taking possession of an ascertained profit in return for something specific. So whatever is like giving possession of original property, for instance by selling it, is a thing extraneous to a compact of lease, and so is anything in which the profit is not defined, either in itself—such as by the act of sewing of a certain garment or the riding of a certain animal to a certain place—or by the fixing of a period such as a full year. And thus, as regards the subject of the question, whereas, it is not a case of taking possession of a profit, but of the original property and, whereas, the profit is not fixed by either ol the two methods aforesaid, the lease is accordingly null and void, on both counts, and it is obvious that while there is no contradiction in the said two rulings, it is recorded that the majority set store by the last. And God is aware of His Commands. Written by this humble servant of the Shera, Murteza-d-Moosevi, Sadr-el-Islam. (L.S.)

The Answer. —A lease has several conditions and if a single condition (thereof) is violated, the lease becomes invalid, and how it would be now that several conditions have been omitted therefrom. Firstly, it becomes binding by a Known period, . his has been omitted, however. Secondly, a lease becomes binding by proposal am acceptance. Should these conditions be absent, the lease is null and void, and when the lease is nullified it is for the lessor to take possession ot his property and to lease it to another; and God knows best. , (Signed and sealed) ABDUL K ERIM-BIN -AHMi-D (Servant of the august Shera law, by his own hand.) And if the owner of the property wishes to turn out the lessee, he can turn him out immediately, , (Signed and sealed) ABDUL KERIM (Servant of the Shera law at Keis), 9. The Answer. —Praise be to God. who leads to the right! This lease as it is mentioned in the question is not in accord with the precepts of the august Shera, and is null and void and invalid. So, the owner of the property has the option to return to his property, and he has the absolute possession thereof, and can use his property in any manner that he may wish. He has the option (to do so), and the lessee has no right or title in that property. And whatever is invalid according to the august Shera is to be considered as non-existent. Should the proprietor desire to turn out the lessee from that place he can do so, and there is nothing to bind the owner of the place. And God knows more !

What do you say as regards a certain man who leased certain property to a certain party and did not stipulate a fixed period in the deed of lease, wherein also no legal formula was pronounced between them, and after some time the owner of the property cancelled the lease. Has the owner of the property the right of cancelling (it) and expelling Zaid, the lessee, from his property or not ? It is requested that you will explain the true position according to the precepts of the enlightened Shera, and be rewarded, your reward being with God,51 Answer. Yes, the owner has the right to expel the lessee from his property because the said lease contains nothing binding according to the Shera. Immediately the owner cancels the lease, the lease becomes dissolved. Written by S h ubbar- bin - A Ii - el -• M oose vi. (L.S.) (Note. —Seyyid Shubbar is the Shia Mujtshid of Lingah.) Appendix 15. Note hy Khan Bahadur AbdulLatif with Partnership, purporting to he dated 26th 1316 9, 1899), and which HassanSamieh bases his title to March 25, 1911. Ihe history of the paper purporting to be the rules of partnership is as follows;— The drawing up of the original draft was done by me, the reason being that the oxide mining work had been in operation for nearly a year without any definite plan of operations having been arrived at. I was anxious to put the work on a, more business like footing, and therefore drew up some rules and sent them to Hassan. The latter made certain additions and had five documents drawn up including the additions and signed by himself, Abdullah, and Nakhoda Ali, and he forwarded them all to me for completion by the attachment of the signatures of Sheikh Sagar and myself. When completed I was to return three of them to him, one for himself, one for Abdullah, and one for Nakhoda Ali. Of the remaining two I was to give one to Sheikh Sagar and keep one myself. 1 did not, however, care about the extra condition which he had inserted and wrote back and said so. There the matter ended. These deeds were never completed nor were any revised documents drawn up. I never showed them , to Sheikh Sagar, and produce them now in the state in which I received them. These rules never having become operative, Esa and I always considered and presumed that the document on which the concern was carried on was that of Zilhijjeh, 1315, in which Nakhoda Ali was admitted to partnership, and in which it is laid down that the sale, loading, and shipping should be carried out with the knowledge of all the partners. By reason of Hassan's neglect to consult us properly, and his failure to render any accounts, we became dissatisfied with his conduct of affairs. Appendix 16. Translation of Deed admitting Mr. T. J. Malc Shaaban, 1316 [December 27, 1898). In the name of God the Highest We do agree and take upon ourselves, Hassan-bin-Ali Samieh, Abdullah-bin- Hassan, Isa bin-Abdul Latif, Yusuf-bin Abdullah and Ali Ahmed Saleh, that we have admitted amongst us Mr. Tigrane Malcolm in the company for the oxide and mica mines in the Bu Musa Island, which we have leased from Sheikh Salim-bin-Sultan at 250 dollars per annum for the oxide mines, and 1,500 dollars for a five years' period on account of the mica mines, on the condition that he will use endeavours in disposing of and shipping what is excavated from the said mines in steamers from Bu Musa to other countries for sale, and afford full assistance for the non-stoppage of the work on the said mines. And whatever the said expenses may amount to, they will be borne by all the parties, and the profits will also be (divided) proportionately amongst all. And on this (understanding) the agreement is concluded; so that it may not be hidden.52 And it is not open to any one of the partners to sell his share or to admit any one (therein) except in consultation with flaji Hassan-bin-Ali Saraieh, and with his ^signature, together with those of the partners. Dated 13th Shaahan, 1316. {Note. —The first part of this document is in the handwriting of Abdul Latif. The concluding condition is in the writing of Abdullah-bin-Hassan-bin-Ali Samieh himself) MR. TIGRANE MALCOLM appears before me this 30th day of May, 1911, and .-makes the-following statement:— ' The history of my entry into the Abu Musa oxide concern was as follows;— ' I had been for some years connected with the trade in oxide from Hormuz in association with NaKhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh, in whose name the concession then was. He, however, lost the concession and then, in consultation with me, he set to work to obtain a concession for extracting Abu Musa oxide, having first made a trial shipment. It was Xakhoda Ali who first started the Abu Musa mining, Hassan Sameiyeh knew nothing about the oxide trade until Nakhoda Ah introduced him to it. The latter had at this time a very bad name with the local authorities and in commercial circles in the Gulf ports, and so he found it convenient to work through Hassan Sameiyeh. After securing the Abu Musa concession the parties thought it would be to their advantage to bring me into it with a view to my arranging the shipments to Europe and elsewhere, and so I came into it. Nakhoda Ah was the moving spirit in the acquiring of the concession, Hassan Sameiyeh was only used as a screen. The former a ^ mining work and always complained greatly of the obstructiveness of Abdullah Sameiyeh and his father Hassan, and their ignorance of matters connected with the oxide trade. ^ Owing, however, to his own state of bankruptcy Nakhoda Ali could not take a prominent part in the concern, and so Abdullah and Hassan gradually oegan to dominate it. Nakhoda Ali managed the work on the island, I was expected to manage the sales and shipment to Europe, and Hassan acted as corresponding member of the company. ISo particular basis of authority existed, so far as I know, on which Hassan was entitled to act, and to the best of my belief (and I have an excellent memory) I have n&amp;s/er heard of or seen the so-called memorandum of association which you have now shown me, much less did I ever sign it or receive a conv of it.

I beg to advise you that I could not leave home for a period of forty days as I was sick, and that I am, God willing, better nowadays. I have heard trom Abbas^Haji Aii Akbar that von had written to him requesting him to speak witn this humole m regara to Bin Musa. Indeed I did not expect that such a message would come from you by anyone, before you come to me in person and receive the facts and go into the matteis (i.e., learn the circumstances). Then you will come to Know the account and every thing with me is kept in proper order. And I consider you^ like a son and in the same position as my son Abdullah, and. you know what friendship existed between us and. your father, Elaii Ah deceased, who did nothing except after consultation in our business. And vou yourself have [nevertheless] forgotten his attitude towards us while we were hopeful that you will follow his footstep. What is certain to me is tnat you will not keep such things (i.e., such ideas) in your mind, and that you will personally come to me and receive the facts of the matter from my own mouth, verbally, and it will become clear to you. And as regards the affairs of the island, they are pending up to now, and no settlement has as yet been made with tne antagonist, i am on the same^ friendly terms with you as with your father, and it is my hope that your mind will not be annoyed with us. You are [however] of a hasty temper, and listen to the statements of jealous parties; [but] the matter should not be misunderstood by you. You are like a son in my estimation, owing to the friendship which I had with your father. In my opinion, you should come to us at Lingah for a week's time and, God willing, all will be well in our interview. This is what was to be stated, and may you ever remain preserved and guarded. My son Abdullah sends you salaams. {Note. —This letter is in the handwriting of Abdullah-bin-Hassan Samieh.) Appendix 19. Hassan-hin-Ali Sdmieh to Nejef-hin (laHaji Nahhoda Saleh. (Translation.) Lingah, 1322 1, 1904). I have sent you a letter by the last mail, enclosing a letter from my son Abdullah, and I hope that they have found you in good health. I have notified you that my son Abdullah has arranged with David Bassoon for a compromise, and that they have demanded of him a power of attorney from you on behalf of your late father, Haji Nakhoda Ali, stating that you are his attorney^ and that you constitute my son Abdullah as attorney on your behalf in Calcutta. My son Abdullah has written a power in your name and forwarded it to you by registered post. God willing, you will, on receipt of the power, record your signature therein, and cause it to be sealed by the resident or by the assistant resident or anyone who represents the resident, and sealed by the director [of customs], testifying that my son Abdullah is attorney on your behalf. You should lorward it to Calcutta soon, because they have delayed the documents of compromise until they receive the power from you.55 God willing, you will forward it to him and inform me of it. This is what was necessary, and please convey my compliments to Haji Mohammad Ali arid all those who aie with you, and may you continue to remain preserved and guarded. Abdullah-b in-Hassan Samieh toNejef-bin Nakhoda (Translation.) (After compliments.) Calcutta, 1322 11, 1904). It is now a long time that I have received no letters from you. Perhaps the cause which prevented it is good. 1 am always receiving letters from my father, Hassan, who gives me the news of jour health. You should, God willing, inform me of your health and the news of your side by every mail. 0 my brother, I beg to advise you in connection with the dispute which was between us and Sassoon. We have settled with Sassoon, and it has been arranged that a compromise should be effected. And we have written papers of compromise for the settlement of the dispute. And whereas your father was one of the partners and he has now passed away, and whereas you are in his place and are his executor, it is necessary that you should give a power of attorney from yourself in my name so that I may affix in the documents your signature with the signatures of the partners which are [recorded] in the documents held by me in the case Sassoon, as Sassoon knows that Haji Ali has passed away, and that I, Abdullah, was his agent at Calcutta. Now, after Haji Ali's death, it is obvious that you are his executor, and it is necessary that you should write a power of attorney for me [saying] that I am your agent in Calcutta in all the affairs which may occur in Calcutta, as I was before in the affairs of your father. For this purpose I have now written a power of attorney in English in accordance with the law which will be accepted by the court; it is a power of attorney from you in my name. There is also an affidavit testifying that you are Nejef-bin-Haji Ali, his executor and attorney, and that you are now in his place. This certificate, together with the power, should be taken by yourself to the British resident or assistant resident at Bunder Abbas, and you should, in his presence, admit that you are the son of Haji Ali, and are in your father's place, and that you have made this power in the name of Abdullah-bin-Hassan, who is to be your agent in Calcutta, as he was before in the lifetime of Haji Ali. Also the resident or the assistant resident should certify in the affidavit that you are Haji Ali's son and his representative. You should also take a writing from the Belgian director of customs that you are Haji Ali's son and his representative, and obtain another certificate from the postmaster and expedite sending them to me by registered post soon and without delay, and write on the cover my address in English as follows :— A. H. H. Samieh and Co., 34/1, College Street, Calcutta. You should not delay the power and the documents, but send them to me at an early date. I have also advised my father, Hassan, who will also let you know and urge upon you. I know that at the moment of their arrival you will expedite sending them on. I have written you by this post, and I now intend going to the solicitors, so that I may write the power and the affidavit and send them to you by registered post. I need not urge you further that you should expedite doing what I have advised you. This is what was necessary. The letter was written most hastily. Your humblest friend, ABDULLAH-BIN-HASSAJN •S AMIEH. P.S. (in red ink).—I was unable to send the power by this mail as it was not prepared. God willing, I shall send it to you by the next mail. Let this be known to you, I shall send it by registered post bv the next mail. A. B. H. S.56 Abdullah-bin-Hassan Samieh to Nejef -hinrN aJihoda (Translation.) Calcutta, 1st Shaaban, 1322 11, .1904), After compliments and enquiries after your health. I have this day written you a letter by post and enlightened you therein of what was necessary to be stated. God willing it will find you in good health. I have informed you especially that a settlement has been made between us and David Sassoon by compromise and reconciliation. And let it not be hidden from you that owing to the fact that Haji Ali has passed away, there is need for a power frpm you so that I may sign for you in the papers appertaining to the compromise, because, in the beginning there was in our hand a power from your father, llaji Ali, [stating] that I was his agent in Calcutta, and after your father's death I informed [them] that you were in your father's pl^ce ; and the court demanded that you should write a power for me setting forth that you are the attorney and executor of the will of your father, and also that-1 am agent in Calcutta on your behalf in the Sassoon case, and for the oxide, &amp;c., and the power should be [written] in English in accordance with the law, because Haji Ali has passed away and it is necessary that the court should understand that Haji Ali has no son beside you. Therefore, in order to settle the affairs I have written in your name a special power in the case of oxide and our dispute with Sassoon [saying] that what we now arrange with Sassoon for settlement by compromise is agreed upon by you. I intended sending the power by registered post by this mail but it was not ready. This is for your information, and, God willing, it will reach you by registered post next mail. You should act upon the instructions which I will now explain to you :— When you receive the power, you should take it to the resident or British vice- consul and assistant resident at Bunder Abbas. He will read it over to you and vou should admit before him that this power is from you to me and that 1 am your agent in Calcutta in the same way as in the days of your father, and affix your signature—IS ejef- bin-Ali-Ahmed-Saleh—in the place winch is marked in pencil, then the resident or vice- consul will record his testimony and seal it with the Government seal. You should forward it soon and avoid procrastination and delay and you should send it to me by registered post to Calcutta soon and without delay. On the same day when it reaches you, you should take it to the resident or the assistant who is now present at Bunder Abbas. I have written you this letter by this mail so that you may know that you will receive the power by registered post. I am sending you this letter in my father's letter and have forwarded another letter to you by post. Surely I will write you by the next mail also with the power. Your letters to me should continue without interruption as before when Haji Ali continuously kept me informed of the situation and of the reports. This is what was necessary to be said at present. _ God willing, I will settle matters after the receipt of the power and proceed to your side in Shavval. This is what had to be stated, and may you remain preserved and generous. Your friend, ABPXJLLAH-BIN-HASSAN SAMIEH. Appendix 20. Mr.T. J.

I am further told that Neief had declined to give bamieh the required declaration.57 Appendix 21. Affidavit ofNejcf-hin-Nakhoda March 19, 1910. Nejef-bin-Haji Nakhogla Ali states on solemn affirmation ;— JL solemnly declare the following to be the facts regarding my interviews with Mr. J nomas Brown, of Messrs. V/onckhaus and Co., and, if necessary, I am prepared to confirm this statement by oath on the Koran before a mujtehed. I have had several conversations about the Abu Musa case with parties interested. The first was wnen Abdu!' ali -bm - H assan Samieh came to see me accompanied by Mirza Hussein Grermani. fhey came to Bunder Aobas and stayed in the house of Haji Amin-ut 1 ujjar. Abdullah, on landing from the ship, came to my house and asked rue to come over and have a talk about the matter at Haji Amin's house. I went over to Haji Amin's house, and there Mirza Hussein, Abdullah, and Haji Ali ' Germani ' were piesent. Abdullah asked me to give him a paper stating that 1 handed over my share of the concession on Abu Musa to Abdullah-bin-Hassan. The paper was to be given a date prior to the date of the contract between Messrs. Wonckhaus and Hassan. He also asKed me to give him another paper saying that I was quite satisfied with the contract. 1 refused, saying that 1 would not do anything of the sort unless they settled up my account with David Sassoon, that is, my father's, on account of oxide, carpets, &amp;c. I said if they did not give me back the carpets they should pay me 20,000 rupees and settle my account, and then I would give them the paper. However, they did not give me the money, and I mentioned the matter to the British consulate. These two persons came to Bunder Abbas not long after the British consul, Lieutenant Gabriel, returned there from a trip he made to Shargah, &amp;c. Some months later Mr. Brown came to Bunder Abbas. The exact date can be ascertained from the consul. Bunder Abbas, as I reported the matter to him at the time, but it was just about two years ayo. Mr. Brown had two interviews with me, once at the house of Jamshidian's agent and once at the custom-house. At the first interview Agha Ghulam Ali Khorassani was present, at the second Mr. Moses Khan, the customs director. Agha Ghulam Ali is agent of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. Mr. Brown had a long talk wuth me. Before beginning to talk about Abu Musa he dismissed two Hindoos, Gulshan and Asanand Ghulab. Mr. Brown asked me why I had not signed the paper shown me by Abdullah and Mirza Hussein. I said there appeared to be no advantage for me in doing so, and therefore 1 hadn't. Mr. Brown said he had bought the share in the oxide company belonging to Sheikh Sagar for 250 reals. 1 replied that Sheikh Sagar had never made anything out of the business, and so would sell cheap. Mr. Brown said he wanted to buy my share, and said that he would settle up all my accounts with Hassan- bin-Ali and Abdullah. I never offered to seil my share to Mr. Brown. In fact, as I reported to the consulate at the time, Mr. Brown offered to buy my share. I would swear to this on the Koran. This took place in the presence of Agha Ghulam Ali Khorassani. At the second interview, and after Mr. Moses Khan tried to persuade me to_ go to Lingah to settle with Mr. Brown, he continued to endeavour to make me do this for a long time, and, on my refusing, he got annoyed with me, and worried me to such an extent that I finally had to resign my post as Hamal Bashi at Bunder Abbas.

During my interview with you we held a conversation alxnit the visit to Abu Musa Island of Wonckhaus, the German, and you said you heard it was in connection with the lease of that island, and you warned me not to let him approach me. Please note that the fact is this as I informed you, that Wonckhaus visited the island merelv to inspect the oxide, saying that if he approved (the oxide) he would perhaps com municate with me with regard to the price, and would probably buy some. This was his object. You should not think that I would fail to let you know if he communi cated with me on the subject which you indicate. We could not allow this sort of interference from any one, especially on the part of these persons. You may rest assured- On seeing the oxide he approved that from one of the mines and returned to Lingah, and says that he will perhaps buy 300 tons if he obtains reasonable rates of freight. He left for Bushire some time ago, and has opened a branch there for the transaction of business. Hassan Samieh (After compliments.)

I take pleasure m replying as follows :— J r &gt; . , Fl f st ' ^ 18 evident that whoever wrote the sentence was not a thorough scholar m Arabic, as he confused the masculine and feminine forms in the last word of the sentence. Tomy mmd the obvious translation of the phrase is, 'the annulment of this agreement is better than its acceptance.' I do not think it is at all obvious or possible 0 . ^anslate the sentence ' the annulment of this agreement is better than to'complv with (his wishes). This translation is, to my mind, a forced one, and not the natural signmcance of the words in question, whatever be their connection, I am confirmed in this opinion after consulting with one or two Arabs concerning the popular use of the pronoun in such a sentence, and I find that they agree with me tnat there is a great looseness m the use of the feminine or masculine' nronoun at the c^ose of a clause or sentence. I am sure that nine out of ten Arabs would give the preference to the former translation of the sentence as the obvious and natural intention 01 the writer. Although my opinion does not carry weight beyond that of others who have a speaking ana reading knowledge of Arabic, yet I feel confident that in this case it is not a matter or expert grammatical opinion, but of everyday usage in the Persian Gulf and i have no hesitation m saying that the first translation*is the right one. hi \ Appendix 25.

It is not hidden from your Honour that I received my education in the Gulf, and that 1 am not an expert in the niceties of grammar and the shades of meaning of various measures of words. When I write, I write according to the usages and under standing of the community in which I live.60 As regards the use of the measure JliaxL^, as synonymous with 1 '■ e use is quite an ordinary one in these parts, and I can mention many other instances of the same, such as ('reposing'), -Lc'^xL^ ('continuance ), v-'UaduJ ( oei-ng ruined'), ('advancing'), Leliu--\ ('remaining ). There is no idea of a ' desire to ' here. Again, you will note that in the letter from my son tsa, dated 7th Moharram, 1325 (20th February, 1907), to Sheikh Sagar occurs the sentence :— (' Va atluh mm jenahekum almosaadeh fi naqz va istebtal-i-hazehel varaqah. ) (' And 1 heg your Honour for assistance in the breaking up and annulling of this document.'; This shows that the words and JlkxL/i were used synonymously. Furthermore, when writing to me on the 23rd Moharram with reference to my letter to him (dated 8th Zilhejjeh, 1324) enjoining on him the sas &gt; JUaxLJ Hassan used the same form of words as I had, thus :— ' You particularly wrote about the deed of contract which I executed with Wonckhaus, the German, for the sale of oxide from Abu Musa Island. ^ I understood what vou said, namely, that your son Isa was not agreeable to the execution of a docu ment of this purport for the reason that I had not consulted you and that it was necessary that the partners should not enter [into transaction] without the knowledge of the other partners ; that this humble one had entered into this transaction without consultation,* and that Isa feared that complications would result owing to the admittance of foreigners [into the concern], and U-'Wl i jjb (' The annulment of this contract is better than its acceptance.') Again, in writing to me on 15th Safar, 1325 (30th March, 1907), Hassan suggested that I had better, if I thought fit, write to the German myself and explain to him regarding the annulment of the contract. His precise words were ;— It will be seen that he here used Jlk.- and not JlkxL^. It is clear therefore that Hassan understood me fully in the sense I intended to convey. Secondly, the explanation of the use of the spelling is as follows in my opinion :—• It is rendering into writing of a colloquial construction of speech. Thus, in conversation, if referring to a masculine object, such as ' zaid,' I should not say &lt;0UliLj, but jjUULLJ, leaving out the ' zamah' after the ' h,' but substi tuting the 'zamah' for 'kasrah' after the 't.' Similarly, if I were referring to a feminine object I should not say but substituting the 'kasrah' after the ' t' for the feminine pronoun ' ha.' Likewise, in writing a colloquial letter I should render the above sounds into writing. The word or is constantly used, in my parlance, in reference to a thing in the sense of ally-*. It is also evident from Hassan Samieh's reply above quoted that he uses it in this sense;— ('Better than its acceptance,' i.e., better than the acceptance of the contract.) The pronoun is used in the feminine, and could only refer to the contract. ABDUL LATIF-BIN-ABDURRAHMAN. March 23, 1911.61 Appendix 2g. Letter from Hassan Sa Latif. (After compliments.) Moharrum, 1325 8, 1907). Your letter dated Zilhijjeh 1324 reached me in due course, and I was glad to receive it and understand its contents. You particularly wrote about the deed of contract which I executed with Wonckhaus, the German, for the sale of oxide from A.bu Musa Island. You said that your son Esa did not agree to the execution of document of such a nature, and complained that I did not consult you, although it was necessary that no partner entered into transactions without the knowledge of the other partners ; that I had so entered into transactions without consultation ; and that, as Esa feared that complications would result owing to the 'entry of foreigners into the matter, the nullification of the contract was better than its acceptance. I under stood it all. Oh I my brother, at the tune I executed the deed of agreement I communicated to you the details of it, copied in Arabic alongside the English without addition or omission, and you came to know of it and approved it, and wrote to me in reply that it was all right. Similarly you asked me for a copy of the deed, and I sent it you, and you acknowledged its receipt and approved of it. It is now a matter of eight months. How can I cancel it ? You, by the grace of God, are a wise man, and if you suggest complications. Remember, the German has no connection with the leasehold of the mines; he has no concern except to take from us the oxide itself, nothing further, for a stated period. There is no harm in thi?. The object is to effect sales and the stuff be sold whether to him or to any one else. You are aware that he took some from us last year, and we saw nothing objectionable in his deal with us ; and, as you know, we have spent a considerable sum of money in expenses in this connection. If we do not sell the stuff how are we to get back our own ? Please God, the matter will end satisfactorily! Salaams to Esa and the brothers. Appendix 27. Esa-hin-Abdul Latif to Sagar-h in-Kal id. (After compliments.) 1325 20, 1907). I HAVE to communicate with your honour with reference to the lease which I and two partners acquired from the Government of Shargah relating to the extraction of red oxide from your island of Abu Musa. As your honour is aware, the document of lease was drawn up in the names of three persons, namely, your humble servant Esa-bin- Abdul Latif, Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Samaiyeh, and Abdul!a-bin-Hassan Samaiyeh. 1 have come to know that on the 1st June, 1906 (8th Rabi-ul-Thani, 1324), the said Haji Hassan entered into a contract with a European merchant named Wonckhaus, without consulting me, and that according to the terms of the document he bound him self and his partners in giving an absolute monopoly for the. extraction of the red oxide for a period of four years. And the said Haji Hassan executed this agreement and bound himself without consulting me previous to the drawing of the deed of contract. The details of the said deed have only now reached me, and I do not agree to the terms of this contract. Accordingly I forward to your honour a copy of the deed of contract for you to examine ; kindly look into it. 1 beg from your honour assistance in taking the necessary steps for the cancellation and annulment of this contract, for I arn altogether unwilling to agree to this lease. Previous to this I have written to Haji Hassan Samaiyeh expressing my disagreement to this contract, but he has sent me n® answer. Finally, I am obliged to call your attention to the deed of contract, the beginning of which is as follows :— ' Contract between Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Samaiyeh, of Lingah, owner and holder of the Abu Musa Concession, and M. Robert Wonckhaus, of Lingah.' [926] R62 Now Haji Hassan Samaiyeh has no deed of authority from me giv ing Lim any general power in regard to action which he might take respecting the lease, c. , ow then has Haji Hassan the right thus to mention himseif only, without consui mg or referring to his partners, of whom I am one ? I am in consequence obliged to ma e a complaint on the subject to your honour, and it is tor your honour to issue Oiders. Appendix 28. Statement of Gu Gulum Hassan states on solemn affirmation :— I have been living on Abu Musa as caretaker ol gardens and ilocks for the last twelve or fifteen years. The following are the circumstances under which shots were fired by Sheikh Sagar 8 guards in connection with the arrival of Abdalla-bin-Hassan Samayieh in a,^ ' ooom (pattern of native craft) from Lingah. The vessel arrived about noon and dropped anchor off the spot where the oxide is shipped from about 300 yards to the westward of the heaps on the' seashore. A jolly-boat full of people put off from her after she had anchored, and came towards the shore. At this time there were only ten or fifteen men present out of Sheikh Sagar's guard, the rest were over at the village. Some of those present were now on the seashore in front of the oxide heaps and some above them on the rocks at the side. Those on shore shouted to the people in the boat not to approach, but as she came on one or two shots were fired from the rocks near the big oxide heap. They Were not fired at the boat or dhow but in the air. The German was in the boat, and at the time one Haji Ali, whom I understand to be the German's clerk, was standing up in the bows of the boat ready to jump off as the boat neared the shore, but I myself called out to him, ' Don't attempt to land, as there is no permission for it.' I heard no answer. Then the guards on the shore called out, ' If you want to ask or see anything send a man ashore, he can see and go back ' Two negroes, whose names I do not know, then jumped into the water and swam ashore. They only remained a few minutes. They were led up to the huts where Sheikh Abdulla-bin-Ahmed bin-Sultan was—he was in charge of the guard from Shargah—and they asked him what was the position of affairs and why had the shots been fired. He replied, 'We are ordered not to let anyone land ; if you don't like it go and get permission from Sheikh Sagar.' They then returned to the boat and the boat to the boom. As the dhow did not show any signs of departing the guard feared she might be ihtending to stay till dark and try and effect a landing, so about 4 p.m. they began shouting to the dhow, warning her to be off. At this time there were waves and some surf. Soon afterwards, I being in the huts at the time, I heard three or four shots fired by our men, but 1 did not see what at. The dhow then, I believe, moved from her place and went farther round to the right, but I did not see any more of her myself. Dated Abu Musa, February 17, 1908. Statement of Mattur-bin-Shamhan. Mattur-bin-Shamhan states on solemn affirmation :•— I was one of the guard which Sheikh Sagai* sent over to Abu Musa and was present on the occasion when shots were fired in connection with the presence there : of a dhow from Lingah. The dhow arrived about noon and anchored opposite the oxide heaps on the shore. The guards who had gone over from Shargah were about eighty in all. Of these about thirty were present at the oxide heaps Xvhen the boom arrived. After she had anchored a rowing-boat put from her containing about ten . persons. As they got near we recognised Abdalla-bin -Samayieh and a native clerk of the Germans, who was known by sight to some of us. did not notice the German himself.Ilf List of Annex© s. x.

'fhie is lay reply with regard to three points firstly -=- in regard to the Mica Agreement I was fully ctwar© oi it and Sheikh Sella consulted me (about it) and it would not have been posolbl© that tho bald agreement could be ioeuod without coming to my knowledge as auling Chief. But ac I informed you two years ago, I had left to Sheikh Salisi all the income which he could obtain fr-m the aforesaid ialand, and coneequently I did not trouble (myself» to object to this (agreement). At the same time wfcanZoo ■iprerented to you th© sale stntsment regarding ay relations i&gt;neikh r»alira la roanoot of IM Kusa, tto© question of fehls : icr contract kss did not occur to ray wind at all, for# afe you r.mst b® aware, the Mica affair produced no result whatever. As regards the sua of pf payable by Inotalaonta to Shel'th Lai la, have no information as to how many instal- aents were received by Sheikh aalin. I did not trouble to r^lc© enquiries about the inetalaente« nor did I demand anything froa Liieikh Salira on that account- It was My wish that he should get something frota it and that he should not trouble rae shout his rxpenaee* secondly - As regards the right to jotaam and flotga?s on Bu Ihiea Island and ail the island© of Cowacsim, it i® not open to doubt that it is due to the Chief of the Kowaeisa, but the usual custom on the Osam Coast in that the inhabitants of the place ^xact their rights on the scene of the wreck and whan the Chief comes to hnotr of it he settles the matter according to his- own opinioni soneti^es he takes his own share from his subjects and sometimes he does not take from then. In the case of Bu Muss, as I had left all the revenue to Sbei'-h salim, I treated ay right of Jotsan and flotsaa as a part ci the tnoons to go to hi® and used to ask no ousg tionr about it. Thirdly - With regard to the rejected draft of the Oxide agreement, I have not/ noted ito wording but had neither seen nor heard of it before, the reason for its rejection Is eb- vlously because nhellch Oallm could not write about Bu Kusa in these tet^s, namely, 'so Ions as I, my children and brothers live, no on© is entitled to raise objection to it'. Ko doubt this was the cause of the draft being changed. This Is -what was necer nry to be stated and sali,a!ssl. (L.s.)Sagar bin Khaled bin Sultan.mil 2of 1^0.48.

I remember that I had been absent on duty at Rush!re during tii© spring oi the year in csueotion end It was on my return to Shargah that the project for an Oxide Concession was disouss- ed. The draft had been drawn up by Abdullah bin Hasan Samaiy- eh and it was he who showed it to me. At the same time he and Hakhoda All, who was also there, asked me to let my son Isa come into the concern as they needed some one on the spot at Shargah in order to keep in touch with Sheikhs Sagar and Salim. I agreed, but pointed out that the terms of the proposed Con cession as at present drafted were quite impossible, and that neither Sheikh Sagar would confirm it nor would the Govern ment approve it. What I escecially objected to was (1) the sentence in which Sheikh Salim is made to say 'so long as i, my children and my brothers live, no on© will be entitled to raise objection to it' and (8) the Inclusion of Hakhoda All as a signatory on the document. With regard to (1), 1 would explain that Salim was an old man of 70, who might be expected to die at any time, and I was taking into account the fact that if he died, we should thenceforththenceforth have to deal with Sheikh Sagar. As regards (2) I thought the inoluslon of Kalthoda All was inexpedient, ac I had just been visiting Bushlre and knew him to be in very bad odour with the Reaidenoy in connection with hi a Bush ire affairo and he was also at log gerheads rfipRjm with the w@ll»itnown Hoin-et-TujJar of Tehran, holder of the Hormuz Concession, and I feared the letter would be likely to give us trouble if he came to know that Wakhoda All was a partner in a rival Oxide enterprise.

(Dated SBth March 1911). the history of the paper purporting to be the Bules of Partnership is ac followet- The drawing up of the original draft was done by ae» the reason being that the oxide laining work had been in operation for nearly a year without any definite plan of operations having been arrived at. I was anxious to put the work on a raore busineae-like footing and therefore drew up pome rules and sent thm to Hnsan. Sie latter made certain additions and had five documents drawn up including the additions and signed by himself, Abdullah, and Hakhoda Ali, and he forwarded thera all to rae for completion by the attachment of the signatures of Sheikh Sagar and myself, then cot. pic tod, I was to return 3 of the® to him, one for himself, one for Abdullah, and one for Hakhoda Ali. of the remaining two I was to give one to Sheikh Sag&amp;r and keep one rayself. I did not however care about the extra con dition which he had inserted and wrote back and said so. There the matter ended. These deeds were never completed nor f| were any revised documente dram up. I never showed then to Sheikh Sagar and produce them now in the state in which I received then.

With referonco to the meaning of the Arabic oentence and the probable intention of the writer in tiaing those words concerning which point you asked ay opinion, I take pleasure in replying as followsJ- First» it io evident that whoever wrote the sentence was not a thorough scholar in Arabic, as he confused the mascu line and feialnlne forms in the last word of the sentence. To jay mind the obvious translation of the phrase is, 'the annulaont of this agreement is better than its acceptance'. 1 do not think it is at all obvious or possible to translate the sentence 'the annulment of this agreement Is better than to comply with {his wishes)*. This translation is, to my mind, a forced one, and not the natural slsnifiCBnoe of the words in question, whatever be their connection. I an confircied in this opinion after consulting with one or two Arabs concerning the popular use of the pronoun in ouch a sentence, and I find that they agree with ae that there io a great looseness in the use of the feminine or masculine nronoun at the close of a clause or sentence. I cua sure that nine out of ten Arabs would give the preference to the fomer translation of the sentence as the obvious and natural intention of the writer. Although ny opinion does not carry weight beyond that of others who have a speaking and reading knowledge of Arabic, yet I feel confident that in this case it is not a matter of expert graiamatical opinion, but of everyday usage In the764 the Persiaw GiiXf, and I have no hesitation In aaylng that the flret translation 14' the right one.ANKHX ).

M 1 s Foreign Office 1 No.1498 to the Government of India | Bushire of the spring of 1909, when troops had to be landed from Mis Majeaty'p. Ships for the protection/ of Foreigners. I beg reference to that report from which point my present note^ takes up the thread. At that time (the Summer of 1909) I considered that I had a good deal to complain of in the attitude towards me of the Acting German Consul Herr Wassmuas, and in this view Sir George Barclay fully concurred on seeing papers which I showed him per sonally in Teheran; I attributed this mainly to the fact that Herr Wassmuss as a new comer with no knowledge of the country or language, was necessarily in the nands of his Dragoman. Both he, however, and Dr.Listemann, the pxaxx permanent incumbent, placed implicit reliance on the man and neither would hear a word against him. This of course was not unnatural. P As will be seen from what follows the man has since been entirely exposed, discredited and summarily dismissed. On the termination of the disturbances and the expulsion of Seyyid Murteza, Mirza Muse in gave up his to local politics and by judicious bribery among the community of harbour boatmen (his father was a local Nakhoda) got himself elected a member of the Bushire Anjuman. Later on,in January 1910 he was able to contrive his selection and that of his ally Mirza All21( ? All Kazerunl (soe my report cf June 190y) as candidates for two of the seats in the xeheran Majlis allotted to the Gulf Ports, The Governor, however, intervened on the ground that the elec tion was not a bona fide one and their deputation never took shape. Meanwhile Mirza iiusein's operations in arms dealings in association with Maji Muhaimnad Hassan, the local broker of Messrs Wonckhaus, proceeded as usual^ but some of the captures of arms by His Majesty's Ships were reported to have involved the pair in heavy losses and put them in some financial diffi culty . In March 1910, owing to tlie stagnation of trade in Bu- shire and other causes, Messrs Wonckhaus withdrew their Euro pean agent for a time and left the broker aaji Muhammad Hasan in charge. The jealousy evinced by Mirza £ ckkbkk Husein at not being given the agency himself, resulted in a split between him and Haji Muhammad Hassan which led to a good deal of mutual recrimination and consequent exposure of their shady business affaire. In September 1910 a sum of £1700 odd which Messrs Wonckhaus had despatched through the medium of aaji Muhammad iiassan, to the neighbouring coast by sailing boat for the pur chase of grain for export, was lost. The money disappeared in transit and suspicion, fostered by Mirza uusein, fell on Haji Muhammad. The latter eventually absconded to Tangistan and Mirza Husein was appointed in his place as «¥onci£iiaus agetii/. The firm, however, soon came to the conclusion that Mirza Husein was implicated, and Muhammad nassan more sinned against than sinning, and induced the latter to return from Tangistan. A short time afterwards they preferred a claim on his behalf against Mirza ausein for misappropriating in the broker's absence a cargo of arms which the latter had ordered out. These arms Mirza xxusein is said to have sold to various dealers of whom one Abdul Karlm bought and secreted 10. These arms having been traced and seized, the Director of CuotomB, having obtained proof of their import by Mlrza ^useln, took up the case against him with the Governor and tne German Consulate.

To this end Mr.Krumpeter, Messrs Wonckhaus 1 then agent, armed with a letter from the German Consul intimating his dismissal and sn- oloeing his pay to date, proceeded with the Consul's authority to the Mirza's house with the intention arresting him or aeiaing certain important documents which he was believed to hold. hirza Husein, however, escaped by a back door and took 'bast' with a local Mullah. Monsieur Constant, the Belgian Provincial Director of Cuotoms, Bushire, about this time received instructions from •teheran to report to his Administration concerning the case against Mirza Husein and informed my Commerciul Adviser, Mr. Chick, of the purport of a telegraphic report which he had sent towards the latter part of March, -vhich was to this effect, viz; 'Herr Krumpeter had been deputed by the German Consul to 'hand Mirza nusein a letter of dismissal and the salary due 'to him. The Mirza took to flight, realising that he had 'been unmasiiod and convicted of extensive robberies on the 11 German Firm'. £ Mirza Musein is now spending large sums of money in order to procure false evidence from the Mullahs. ' r Mirza Husein has long since been known to the Customs as an importer of arms and is at the moment being prosecuted by the Customs for smuggling 10 rifles,and in this connection the Governor of Bushire has informed me that^Mirza Husein had sent him 150 tomans as a bribe« He, Mirza Husein, V4s now haggling as to the amount of fine which he should be called upon to pay. Mirza Husein is an agitator and a rogue whose downfall will be welcome! by all honest members of the community'. Charges against Mirza Husein are still pending and meankhile the German Consul is withholding the rent of the German Consulate premisespraraioea, whloh belong to - Irza in connoction with his debt to tha ^eman firm. Lastly^hia kx old friends of the spring of 1909 have since turaod against him and recently got up an axtenaive round-robin (signed among others by hie Nationalist acoomplioe .irza All j^azeruni) in which they accuao him of being Seyyed . urteza'a instigator and evil genius and domand^ that ha should be made go d^agwrgo or refund the money which he had prompted Seyyid i..xart©za to plunder from the Government Cu tome, i.t will be aeen that -irza 'Usein has beon tiioroughly dia- oreditedj denounced by the Local governmentj prosecuted by the uustoiBB and the ierm&amp;n firm for dishonesty and summarily dia- misaed from his post in the German consulate.

I have the honour at length to submit the material col lected for cur i-eylyto the German Rejoinder in the Abu Musa Case, together with my observations on it. 2. When I telegraphed fr^ 7 ' Henjam at the end of March that I hafl collected the local material and that the writing of it up would occupy some days, I did aot realise that it would prove to be quite the intricate task which I nave found it to deal with all the small points used 3r the German Communication. When at Headquarters I am subject to incessant interruption and I have only been able to complete the report by coming for a few days to the Shatt-el-Arab and working in quiet on the 'Lawrence'. The German Rejoinder was a formidable document if read by itself, but when studied by the light of the papers already recorded a great deal of the substance fell out of it and I have seen no reason to alter the appraisement which I made of it in Enclosure (1) to my Note of February 19th 1910 submitted to H.M's Foreign Office. So far as I can judge the fundamental points of our cane re main unshaken, and the papers now submitted will, I hope, be found to supply a not unsatisfactory reply, to accompany our offer of compromise. To save time, I have ventured to forward two copies of the naners bv the same mail tc the Political Secretary India Office, papox^ ^ J have, etc., Lt.Col P.R.lAO BUIKF GOmniT m SUMMASt OF THE FRESH ARGDMEHTS AHD EVIDE80B HOW SUBMITTED.

Hi® 'iaouee* referred to below arc those fraraed in that note. I b stir (a) ( -j) She right to jotoaa and flotsan. It is shown by dociimentary and testamentary evidence that in the Gulf the right is levied by the local inhabit- ante and their overlord# if he can,and sees fit to do so, takes his share. It is shown also that no one but the Ruling Sheikh has been recognised in this connection, but that he (sagar) in virtue of the arrangement by which he allowed Salim the income of Abu Musa, has left the levy to hia. (2) the rejected version of the Oxide Conossslon dated 6th April 1P.98 is shown to have been drafted by Abduulah bin Hasan Saraalyeh hiaself, and to have been rejected by Abdul Latlf specifically on account of the unwarrantable claim therein put Into SalIra's mouth, of formal ownership. The final version of the Concession was then drafted by Abdul Latlf hlraself. {3). Vihat the German Mote calls 'revenue from mother-of- near l«» a. n d canary seed' Is shown to bo a mistranslation. It ohould bo 'ground rent from storage of 'muhar* and i zixmi * oyster-shells' . The ♦muhar' and * Jilnnl are two Bnooios of pearl -bearing shells.

Was given ^ith the Ruling Sheikh's knowledge and consent and Sheikh Ballia wet© allowed to take proceeds as nart of revenue of island. It proved to he a mare's nest and fisizled out. Salin* b enjoyment of the Income of the Island, with the consent and subject to the nleaeure of the Ruling Sheikh is not disputed. I nay raention here for the information of Government*— jpt has bean considered urmecesBary to mention it in the evidence - that a change has come about in the relations between Sheikh S&amp;gar and Salim. Sheikh Sagar*e eon Khaled, Sheikh of rtae-el-Khaima, having died of consumption, Sagar sent hie unci® Sails there temporarily to take charge ao Deputy Governor. Soon after hin arrival there his son coramitted a murder in con nection with a love-affair. Sheikh Sagar wanting to have the murderer tried and punished. Sail® in order to save his uon set himself up adversely to Sheikh Sagar and placed hlmeelf on the defensive. It being the pearling Season and all his men away. Sheikh Sagar took no punitive action and eventually made terms with Salim and allowed him to ssKfcstettJi remain sa Sheikh of Ras-el-Khaima. He has accordingly ceased to pay him any pension and withdrawn Abu iluca from his enjoyment. I do not think we need mention this as the development is still fresh and had better be left to crystallize quietly. Issue (b). A quantity of similar evidence has been obtained in refutation of the merchant!le and clerical evidence fur nished in the German Rejoinder. Issue (c).

As a natter of fact it would probably have oaved a good deal of subsequent trouble la this case, had the Resident allowed Sheikh Sagar to take what steps he pleased against Sheikh Ralls, merely sending a ship to the spot to aaTfe sure,that, apart fron their quarrel, there should be no disturbance of the general peace.

It wan both his intoreoto and those of loa bin Abdul batif which fornod the 'ootenoible ground' for Sheikh Sagar's action. (See also item 7 of British Memorandum). Tho Sheikh gave his own reaoons for withdrawing the concession; they were, that Hasan had given a monopoly which he had no authority to do and had thus mads it evident to the Sheikh that his own rights over Abu Jiusa sight be endangered by the continuance of the ccnoeo- eion in such unsafe hands. He in fact realised that Haoan was acting in a way calculated to prejudice Ms Interests, and in his laterlotter of 26th March to Hasan (Annex ir. of Mrst German J emorandun) in reply to Hasan*a protests, he explained himself in further. He said he had concurred/the original concession be cause all the narties were British subjects and thus every one concerned was under his own control or that of the Uritish Go vernment; but he objected to the adaission into the concern of the subjects of a foreign power over when he would have no fjyt,- control. He feared that Raines micht go out of his possessions and it in clear that the apprehension was not altogether an ©rapty one, for in their letter to the Sheikh dated 15th October 1907 Messrs. WonckhatJ® wrote *We have paid to them (Hasan etc) very considerable advances x x x and wo consider that the oxide lying on the sea-shore is our propert y and that the rdnee and the conoosBton are security for the said advances'. Again, when Messrn. Sonckhaus• enploye, Brown, attempted to land at Abu Musa on- SHnd October 1907 with Haji Ali Tashankar and a nunber of en fro-' hingah, and wrb prevented by the resolute attitude of the Sheikh's guards, ho was reported by Lieutenant Gabriel to have had with his a German flag which he intended to erect at the Oxide nine or over the accumulated nineral. Lastlylife when Dr. Liatemenn, Con«ul for Germany at Bunhlr©*ad dressed. GiiBl'ch Sa^ttp dl rfict on 19th November 1907, protesting Rt hi« action, he wrote that ''eerrB.

In the ca»® of the Oxide Concession the position would be that galla gave the concession after obtaining the concurrence of hlaself as Regent and subject to Sheikh Sagar*e oonfimation. In the case of 'Mica • Oonoession he gave it after consulting Sheikh Sagar ^/ho was hiraself preeeht. As regards Sheikh Sagar's letter of 11th October lone to the British Resident. His statement that 3alim granted the Concession 'as Regent' would still stand so far as it went? and the motive of its assertion is quite an intelligent one and quite different to the far-fetlfohed one that the tieraan Rejoinder saeks to put on it. They say that being under the mistaken belief that he was prohibited by the Treaty of from entering into such transaction with any on© but a Brit ish subject, and Hakhoda All being a Persian subject, he was anxious to persuade Oolonel Keeball that Rakhoda All was not a Concessionaire at all and that if there had been any fault it was Salin*s and not his. The only basis for this view is a garbled version of a remark said to have been dropped by Sheikh Sagar, and there is no real foundation for the hypothesis at all. To go back to the letter itself and Colonel Keaball*® let ter to which it is a reply. I would explain that business with the Truclal Chiefs is carried on almost entirely through the Heeidenoy Agent. Direct letters between the Hesident and the Sheikhs are of coraparatively rare occurence, and when they are necessary the Resident 's letters are always sent to the Agent under flying seal (or accompanied by a copy for the Agent 's record) for delivery. Eiailarly the Sheikh 's reply addressed to the Resident direct is gfcven to the Agent to close and forward. So Sheikh would think of answering a letter of the nature of this one (Oolonel Keffiball's) without consulting the Agent before replying. In this particular case too. Sheikh Sagar knew that the Agent himself was per sonally and financially interested and consulted hin fully as7 ( I ''■ c t;&gt;m8 tihiehhe had 'beet reply, in proof of this v«, aavs the feet the Sagar'a letter, above quoted, la found to b© written on the Agent*s office paper bearing the Oo- ens. of India Water-mark. it I b obrloue that unless Qielkh tiagar wanted to quarrel with Abdul Lntlf, the answer nuat be tiie latter wanted and advised, and utiat Sheikh said to the Resident, In other words, wass- ^ hat you have heard about the Abu Musa Oxide Concession being In the hands of MaJchoda All, of whow I know you have a bad oplnxon, is not true; the Coneeeeionairee are three of your o\m people and I oupposed your Agent had given you the neceaeary detail® of it, oaee you may notice that the Gon- ceaaion was executed by Balln and not by rae, I would explain tnij.t oalim grantee it with full power© as Regent for ae, during I ay absence at Mecca, and it I0 still operative, and hae ray support - 00 1 hope you will not think It necessary to jaafee any difficulties about it'. His object was not to ALeclaia responsibility at all, but on the contrary to make it clear to Colonel Kemball that the Concession wao In order and had hie own approval# Am a matter of faot A there was y no ban whatever against Na— I khods All, qua Persian subject. The position at the time in this regard 1» set forth in Ites 80 following. (13). SHEIKH SAG/u'i 1H0REASED THIS ALLOWAii0- s : BY THE REVENUE OF I ABU MUSA, IHOLUDIMU THAT DERIVED THE RED OXIDE MIBSS. This statement is correct. (14). MEMOftAKDUJI OP SBFllCK EADAR, DATED 8SRD FEimUAHY 1898. This Is a clerical error. It should, of course, be 1908. (16). ATTEKTIOU MUST BF CALLS!)

Th® po:.ntsa aussootion in the Geman reply that we had I'sason for not producing the letter, Inclinef? me to suppose tnat they have oeen It. thin Is quite possible. At the time tiie letter was written there was no German element oonneeted with the Uonoeasion, and Sheikh® Sagar and saliia, Abdul Latif, and Hasan iiamaiyeh, ^ore all in eaoh otiier's oonflderioe, and the Resident•© enquiry and Sheikh Sagar'a reply would have been of intoroat to and probably discussed by all of then:. I ara not sure of the reason which prompted Government not to produce this docuaent, but I should presume it to be this? Nafchoda Ali was s Persian subject but no objection tmo then raised by the UoHidenoy to his participation, 'i'he Gemans /V might argue that if Uheikh Gagar had in 1898 granted a Con cession to a foreign oubjoct, and we had not objected for 4 years, why f?hould Sheikh Gagar object^as he now hfts; or we^ to the entry of Wonckhaua into the concern. As a matter of fact Oolonel Keaball was mistaken. Hakhoda Ali was not a sharer in the original Concession, his name was dropped for a epticific reason. As a fraudulent bankrupt he was a disreputable person and incidentally, whoa neither the Cheikh nor Government had any ultimate control.

It may be a matter of opinion whether the theory, that Article 3 of the Treaty of 6th March 1892 precludes the grant of a mining Concession to a foreigner, is compatible with the principle of the open door, but that question hardly . at tno time when Sheikh Sagar addressed arises here because at2*ls la't'tap of 1 Itli uotober 1902 to U0X0310X i»0ist)aXX 'tiid onXyj warning ho had. rooeivad on the oubjaot v/aa that contained In OoXont»X Meade * a lettsr to iiesidenoy .igent, ^aargah, dated 17tlx J'jhru&amp;ry 1900 in which the JTorsaor wrote:- ' Y ou siiould inform the TruoiaX Jhlefs separately that 'the Eosldent .'.'ouXd bo ready to help them with advice in 'respect to any proposals jcade to them for trading pri- 'vile^os, such ae ninlng concesslona, etc. In doing ao 'you would, of course, aaJie it clear to the ^hiefa that 'the ii«aidant haa no desire to Interfere but it «ould bo 'to their advantage to obtain advice before concluding 'arrangementa for raonopoXiea and exclusive priviXegea, 8 thereby protecting theraaelvea against unscrupulous 'traders'.

It was all very ell for Abdullah ounningly to put ouch words into Sheikh Sallm'a mouth, but Salics knew well enou^i that he was not in a position to make such a pronounces?ent and the draft waa rejected eneoifically on that account. Directly Abdul Latff saw it, he said that it would not do and wrote out an amended draft omitting the objectionable words. Until I show ed it to him a few weeks ago. Sheikh Sagar had nev^r seen or heard it. The c i -utiouc Abdul Latif also realised that the admission of Wakhoda Ali into the original agreement with the Sheikh, which would have to be reported to the Residency, was inexpedient as he had a bad reputation and was disapproved of by the Reside ncy, and hie inclusion would orobably bo objected to,%MIM*b If 1 *a,, til a nam© was therefore omitted from the original agreement and it was decided to bring him in on a subsidiary agreement between the partners inter se.

Time went on and the sections of the Jowasim on the Persian Coast after some generations became as it were permanent settlers there and quarrels began to arise between parties of them and their kinsmen from OmanGisan sojourning on the islands, r/hen their grazing interests clashed, in order t© put an end to this recurrent friction the Chi e^, a of the Clan came to a friendly understanding under which particular islands were henceforth to be ueea exclusively hy different portions of the tribe, under th3,s understanding Abu Musa fell to the Shargah trench and the arrangenent then Bade has never been disturbed, While not ordinarily intervening in the internal politics of the Jowasis or other Arab tribes in treaty relations with then, the British Authorities have in practice recognised this position, and, in pursuance of their time honoured policy of maintaining the 'Maritime Truce', the principles of which,as we have specifically notified to the tribes,, are held to apply to the islands of the Gulf as well as its waters, we have interfered in the present instance in so far as that when alien trlbesaen frois Debai and elsewhere have attempted to send their flocks for grazing, or otherwise to meddle with Abu Musa or Sir Bu Nuair islands, they have been directed either to desist or first obtain the acquiescence of the Ruling Shaikh of Shargah in thesfproceedings. It is true that on one or two occasions the Persian (3 ivernsent,apparently from ignorance or a misconcep tion of tho history of these islands generally, have attempted to insinuate a claim to Abu Muaa,but in 1888, when this olaim was firsy asserted,in conjunction with a similar one In connection with Sirri,C&lt;lonel E.C. Ross, for 18 years Resident in the Persian Gulf, writing t© Sir Henry Druawond Wolff, His Majesty's Minister at Teheran, on 28th April.188B, observed; ' the claim now put forward to the island of Abu Musa has no jus tification whatever and any attempt to assert Persian authoritykvjy.^3 ihi* Je^y k U^c^l&amp;y ^ /q ''fssiyt*** » ■'■rt r t ^jjt/. authority there in a practical form would lead to ' ' diBturbance? Again in April 1904 when an over zealous Belgian C ub- toms official proceeded to the island and incontinent ly hauled doT /n the Shargah flag and hoisted the Persian ewhlem in its place, the Persian iiovemaient were called upon to repair the unwarranted affront and a British iran-of-vifar was sent to see that it had been, done and that the Arab flag was replaced with due cereaony• Thus, as far as the Jowasiis ere concerned the position which existed from time iwaemorial has been Maintained up to the present rsoment, and every year in the spring, when and after rain has fallen and vegetation isade its appearance, the Ruling Shaikh of Shargah and his int- Diediate relations have been in the habit of sending their livestock to graze on the island. So much for the abstract history of Abu Muea as an appanage of Shargah, Tfe rsay now turn to the aspects brought into relief by the present misunderstanding in connection with the grant of a Concession for min ing oxide on the Island. In the year 1882, the Ruling Chief of Shargah was Shaikh Salia bin Sultan. He had held the reins of tribal governnent for about 18 years, but his r regime was a weak and unpopular one. This Shaikh had taken a particular and enterprising interest in .Abu Muea and had planted corse date groves and built hinself a rough residence there. In the spring of 1685 he was according to his habit spending a few weeks there with the tribal horses and flocks and had left his nephew, Sagar bin Khalid a youhg nan of about 26 years of age, in charge of his head quarters at Shargah. Among these Arab chieftains the principle of •slight is right* prevails and Sagar bin Khalid find ing that the Majority of the tribesmen of the princi pality^ 347 QSJ principality were tired of his uncle's rule end ready to support himself in a coup d'etat, seized the govern- aent and proclaimed himself Shaikh on 4th April 1883, informing the Resident of his action. The British Authorities leave these questions of personnel to the will of the tribes concerned and usually do no more than recognise the individual whoa the support and choice of the tribe puts in a position to handle the reins of governaient; and in this case Shaikh Sagar received recognition in due course. As soon as he had made sure of his position he addressed the Resident Con 17th May^lSSSI saying that he now proposed to expel Shaikh Salin from Abu Muss. In reply he was reminded that the Residency had in former years specifically notified to the Trucial Chiefs that the principles of the Maritime Truce rsust be held to apply to the inlands as well as the seas of the Persian Gulf and that he should consequently endeavour to ar- a rang- A pcaceablc settlement with hie uncle. Simultaneously Shaikh Sallm left Abu Musa for Lingah and thence wrote to the Resident asking his' good offi ces. He in turn was advised to remain in Ling ah (it being more convenient for purposes of communication) until he could come to an understanding with Shaikh Sagar, Being in the weaker position Salim soon came to terms and a settlement guaranteed by the Shaikhs of Ras-eJ-Khairaa and Debai, was arrived aft la ^ J'aJty 1883 under which Shaikh Salim was to receive a pension of 600 dollars per annum for his maintenance. A copy of the settlement is attached. Shaikh Salim however found it difficult to refrain from intriguing against his nephew, in the hope, no doubt,of getting back the Shaikhdcm. Thus, on 81st January 1884 Shaikh Sagar complained to24% t© the Resident of his uncle's conduct and In the course of his letter he wrote; 'At present you ere 'aware that Salin resides on Bu Musa, which is an 'island dependent on Shargah, and I cannot spare it 'to others and perhaps Salim aiay create sosa© dis- ' turbace which nay break the itaritiae peace. I beg 'therefore that you will tindly warn Saliia and in- 'foris hi* that if he is desirous of living at Abu 'Musa he must do so peaceably, you being his guaran- 'teo that nothing wrong will be done by him of a 'nature to disturb the Maritime peace. But should 'he not choose to obey it will be your choice either I 'to remove hi* froa the island or to leave us t© 'settle the matter between us and in that case we 'should not be called to account in the event of our 'attacking one another. I leave the matter to your 'disposition, a In reply the Shaikh was informed that if either party broke the maritime peace he would be promptly repressed. About this time the Shaikhs of Ras-el-Khaina and Debai also complained to the Resident against Shaikh Salim 1 a violation of the agreement, guaranteed as it had been by themselves. On 14th February following Shaikh Sagar again wrote to the Resident politely urging that it was all very well for him to say that whoever broke the Maritime peace would be repressed , but reminding him that Abu Musa was his , Shaikh Sagar 1 s property - a hereditary appanage of Shares ah . He added ; ' If Salim wants to live there and guarantees that he will not commit anything which would interfere with my affaita , or disturb the maritime peace , so be it j but I cannot dispense with this Island , which is of the greatest use to me » I beg therefore that you will plainly write to me on the subject and likewise instruct your I Agent '341 5 Cj on this letter was recorded an office note to the / following effect : ' Shaikh Sagar eeems to insist that if Calia continuea to live on Bu Musa he should give a guarantee through the Resident that h» will not do anything to disturb hint , Shaikh Sagar , or the maritime peace * 11 1 On 5th April Shaikh Sagar wrote the Resident another i letter pressing for a reply to the above • He added that he had coaraunicated his precise object in writing to the Residency Agent,who would explain it . ©lis was that now that spring had arrived he wished to send hie horse® as usual for grazing and was not sure whether Shaikh Sail* would leave the* and their caretakers in | peace • If the Resident i?ould not allow hin to make his own arrangeaents for ensuring safety of life and | property on the island he wanted an assurance from the f Residency that his stud would not bv molested by Shaikii Sal is. * Shaikh Sali» however who was now getting into finan-f -clal straits solved the difficulty himself , He sad© { an appeal to the Residency alleging that Shaikh Sagar and the guar?mtors of the Agreement of 1885 had not stood by the terms of it s that they had taken away the state horses which as Shaikh of Shargah , he had had wdbth him on the island when his nephew ousted hi* from the Shaikhdoa tthat he , Shaikh Sail* had had to sell all he possessed to maintain himself and now had nothing left j and that he had now come to beg his nephew to provide him with the wherewithal for a bare living . He declared that if he got this h© would remain in peace and quietude , Finally he begged our Agent to intercede for hia and to induce Shaikh Sagar to act up to the Agreement • By the advice of the Residency Agent , Shaikh Sagar, who had found the 600 dollars somewhat too much for his purse , consented to pay his uncle a reduced all- -owance of 400 dollars annualJy , half of which only maa to be pSfc4 In cash and the other half in grain andother articles , He also proaised to assign to shaikh Sail* the revenue of the island of Sir Ahu Nuair which contained some salt deposits and was expected to bring in about 200 dollars more « A document in the above sense was drawn up at a meeting at Ajman and there ratified • When reporting the conclusion of this agreement the Residency Agent mentioned that Shaild Salim was at present going on a visit to Rae -al-Khaim^. and that his family would spend the hotweather there and the winter on Abu Muaa . Things went on smoothly after this for a time but the two Shaikhs eventually got at loggerheads again and in April 1889 our Agent reported that Salim had endeavoured to raise an attack I on Shargah . On getting wind of his uncle's intentions Shaikh Sagar , as usu^al , asked the advice of the Bri j -tish Agent and the latter soon succeeded in bringing about a friendly meeting between the two resulting in the framing of a third agreement in superceseion of the preceding ones ♦ This was to the following effect j 'i Shaikh Sagar bound himself to pay his now aged uncle | the 400 dollar pension regularly and to permit him to return to the mainland of Oman and to live where he pleased within certain limits , He also offered to j take Shaikh Salim into his sevic© as Vazier or chief I A j adviser and to consult him in all matters affecting thj the interests of the state • Shaikh Salim in turn T undetcok to serve Ms nephew in obedience and loyalty .

'• t i note . In replying to the German Case it aesms unneoessary for us in the first Instance to go behind the Srd agreement of 1889 whleh is s till in operation, the others having lapsed* If, however, it is considered advisable for us to refer to this Agreement of 188S in detail, it would see© prudent, in order to preclude misunderstanding, to give an explanation of the reference to Abu Musa island in the text of Sheikh Salia*B undertaking. Read by itself the t&amp;nm of this document would perhaps enable the Genaan Goveraaent to argue corroboration for the assertion made in their case to the effect that Sheikh salin was the owner of the island and not Sheikh Sagar. In r.oint of fact the explanation of the reference is natural and simple* As stated in my raemorandtsa on the atatua of Abu Muaa it had been the custor. from time iaraeisorial for the Sheikhs of shargah to send their State and private horses and livestock over to graze on the island every spring? and at the time when Sheikh Sagar seized the government from his mole, it will be reaesbered that the latter was spending his yearly visit to the island and » had a number of the Otate horses with him. After the coup d'etat the disposal of these horses became one of the chief difflenities in the way of a friendly settlonent; but eventually taliD had to give them up. While therefore, in the interests of peace, acquiescing in sheikh Salim's taking up his residence on the island for the present sheikh sagar naturally did not wish to forego the conve nient practice of sending his stud ove • to graze? on the other hand, for him to have sent them over without being able to take any adequate stops to ensure their safety would have been to put In Salla's hands a simple effectlK^ means of annoying hi® nephew by interfering with the horses. Sheikh .agar therefor® got Sallm to give him a written assurance that while he resided in Abu Musa Sheikh sagar could send over his horses as usual with out apprehension.I (i)- Letter dated 19th 'luharram 1SS6 and r.eaorar »duj5i from Si)eiKh.

W© now learn that Haji Hassan bib All Samalyeh on 10th October 1007, that is to say after 8 months after the annulment of the con- , sold a share in the oxide company which had formerly belonged to Yueuf bin Abdulla. How could this person possibly sell a share in a concern which a long time since had been done away with wholly and entirely. And seeing that the procedure of iiaji Hassan is against all principles and his motive is to create con fusion, it is necessary for me to inform you that i am unable to accept or agree to this action and in view of the fact that the buyer and seller are dependents of the British Government, i re quest that you will take steps for the suppression of these objeot- ionabl e proo^jaD lags • And whereas you have enquired of m® the nature of Sheikh balim's connection with Abu ilusa, your honour must be fully aware of the circumstances, namely that since the time of my assuming the Government of Shargah and its dependencies, 1 have left the income of the island of Abu Musa for the subsistence of my uncle Sheikh Galim so long as he remains steadfast in his loyalty to and concord with myself; and his sojourn there has been with my acquiescence and at my will, and my honoured uncle cheikh Salim in no wise denies this, and as you will see from his letter to me in which he details the true facts of the position in which we ; .re placed towards each other in this connection. For yourinformation I send you Sheikh Salim's letter in original. Furthermore I have recorded in a note the nature of the position in regard to Abu Lius© inaheikh Sagar bin Khaiid's exnlanatlon of the position in roglrd to Abu Husa. In reference to the Island of Abu Muea, it Is well known to every body that it is the property of the £hei&gt;h8 of the Joimeia of Oman and on that point there is no doubt. As to the residence of my unci© in it the facte of the matter are as explained below. Prom olden days, from the tiiae of my ancestors Sheikh Sultan and others, it was their habit in the days of epring after a fall of rain and the oprouting of vegetation to send their live©took to the Island of Abu lum for grassingf and also a number of our subjects from Shargah and Khan habitually nojoumed on the island during the winter for fishing purposes and had houoes and huts there. In the year 1500 Hijrl Shaikh Calim who was then Ruling Chief of shargah after sending his livestock there as usual went over to the ialand and by ihe fate ordained by God the populace called upon roe to become their ruler in place of Sheikh Sallm, and I accepted their call and occupied the post of the Sheikhdoo. It was then open to sae to expel Sheikh Sal Ira Brom Abu 'uea Island and 1 addressed the Resident in the Persian Oulf on the subject In letters which mat be available on your records; the first was dated SSnd Rabl-uiwwal 1301 and the second 14th Rabl II 1501 but the Resident pressed tne to -.make a peaceable settlement so that there might be no cause for a breach of the saaritirae peace * Ac cordingly ne agreed that I would set apart for Sheikh Salla . : ... I pension for his subsistence, every year 600 dollars. That settle- went afterwards became void by jay not being able to pay the amount fixed, and subsequently, a second agreement was come to between us under which I was to pay him yearly 400 dollars and also the Income derived from the island of Sir Abu iTuair which was expented to approach £00 dollars. This Agreement also became void and In the year ISOfi we made a third agreement with sheikh Sallm by the mediation of the uovernment Agent, and in view of the fact that up to this agreement no income had beeh obtainable from Sir Abu liuair for Sheikh Sallm, mention of the island was omitted and hie pension retsainedremained at the previous figure of Ann ^ ^ 6 o400 dollars, but I now agreed to the return of Sheiv-h th &lt;■» Shafeofc '-nd I took hi* into ny eervloe. Then later on in the T ' 1 went on the Mecoa pllgrlnage and appointed 3heiVh q«n« + ^ - ,alim to a °t for ne in the Shargah C0 TOrane nt and on ny retuni sheikh 3allB ^ ^ ^ boon afforded an opportunity a „ d h a d aeS n tt to our lnt9rBBt to lease the mines of Abu Muaa fn +&gt;,««« vo three persons subject to the British Government. I did not renudlat* 4 + „ ^ re,uaiate it and saw nothing objectionable I acquiesced in it? and seeing that Sheikh Sali® had ' S j ' ! ,ra ' 10 con ' ,laln 'hat the eum of 400 dollore was not suffi cient for his aubslstence, 1 voluntarily set aside the amount of this rant for him, that It might make up his subsistence, oo that the total of what oan.e m *» to his, yearly .sight be floo dollars to m ! 0 ! 6 ' ' &gt;nd 0Ver ' and thSt n0 CiUee 0f olBh t he lef . t a o 00 unt of the paucity of his allowance. I have absolutely not given him any deed In connection with the Island nor In regard to the nines therein, all x did was to relinquish the Inoooe to mr , in me way^of financial asolstanoe from to hla - and It -t-B , one voluntarily and at ny own discretion. And I have not ceased in the days of spring in years when there has been rain and herbage to send my livestock to the island for grazing purposes as has been our custom from of old; and my flag ceases not to fly there. .uon ~ tas . -o*. oi the matter and I have recorded them for your Information. signature and seal of Sheikh Sagar bin Khalld bin Sultan.3.7 Sal la bin Sultan, To Sheikh Sagar bin Khaled, Sheikft of Shargah. After oompllnenta. I write to Inform your honour that whereas 1 have come to know that Hajl Haae&amp;n bin All Saraaiyeh and the friends who advise h*3 assert that the oxide mines which are In the island of Abu i usa are ray personal property and that the leas® which was Issued by me to Ilajl Hassan and his partners was given by me in my own right and not by proxy in your behalfj I fear that this statement may become a cause of ill-feeling between us» I have therefore thogght it neoessary to apprise your honour of it and to acquaint you with what is in my mind, namely that I absolutely made no such claim as that which interested parties allege; and I hereby admit that when I came before you in the presence of the British Agent on 4th Shaaban 15501 I had no pension or means of subsistence and you were kind enough to place the Island of Abu Uusa under my supervfefeion so that I might cultivate therein and reap from it the means of subsistence end you did so conditionally that I loyalty and concord and obedience to you in all respects; and I am well aware that the Island in question and the mines which are in it belong to your honour and that you might at any time mJ^t decide to take the island ffom my charge. It is at your disposition to do so, and I have no status or power to gainsay you. And when 1 leased the mines of Abu Musa 1 was off1- elating on your behalf and the concession was given by proxy t* you and I was well aware that on your return from the pilgrimage to Mecca, if you considered that my action in the matter of the concession was good, you would confirm what I had agreed to, and if in your opinion it was objectionable you could annul It either at the time or at any other time; and I altogether disapprove of the proceedings of Hajl iiasean bin All Samalyeh in regard to this lease and in respect of whatever action you took in this connect ion, that is in cancelling the document, 1 was acting in accord with you , seeing that your action was taken in consultation with mmurn and for the interests of us all. « . . in-roepect have I any view contrary to yours, and ^ t 4«, 4 . » na it is in order to dispel doubt from your mind and as an evidence n-f &lt; , 0 '' w y singleness of view with you tlmt i have written this «« tv-«* uuat you may have cognizance. signature and seal of Salla bin Sultan. 18th Muharram 1386.♦mm /% „ (■ 3ti / /J jr 26th November 1904.

Nothing of iciportanoe was heard of the matter until I , •, reports or some objectionable compact between Samaiyeh and 'oncjOihua reached the Resident in August 1906, and j , t \ on investigation it appears# that there was evidently truth in the report in question and that Hassan Samaiyeh was endeavouring to throw dust in the eyes of Esa and his father and tookeep the precis© terns of the deed of contract secret from then. Thus on 7th June he had written to fcr. Tigrano 7th June 1906. Maloolaj of Bushir© who claims to have a subsidiary sharein the concern; and on 11th June to Abdul Latif telling them of his deal with tonckhaus, but not mentioning the existence of any forsal deed and glazig- over the fact that an absolute monopoly of purchase had been granted to the German Firm. In the German Case ' trie letter is oonepiououf by? its absence from the enclosures. Abdul Latif our Native Agent on the Trucial Coast ■fkc after,,warnings which he had given to Hassan, not suspect ing Hassan's good faith and attracted no doubt by the prospect5th July 1906 •prospeot of reaping profit fro® a concern from which during ten years paot his aon had derived no benefit, did not appreciate the real significance of Rasean^s naive remark that 'if more was extracted Wonokhaus would be a taker of it% and in the absence of the text of the document was misled into expreeaing hie satisfaction. He clearly did so however on the supposition that no lease or formal deed had been executed for in intimating pro/iaional approval he repeated his foraer caution in this regard, 14 th June 1906. In reply fiasaan pooh-poohed his apprehensions and assured him that there had been nothing more than a simple sale of oxide. It was now that Hassan began a series of liee in tended to facilitate concealment of the text of the contract with Wonokhaus as long as possible. Thus when asked by 'r. Malcolm for a copy of the agreement he re plied that it was in German and that he could get no one to copy it. This letter was forwarded to the Resident by . ! r. Malcolm of Busiiire who had mentioned the matter in conversation a fow days before. Recourse was then had to the Residency Agent Shargah but nothing resulted for some time. Meanwhile Mr. Malcolm heard again from Hassan who now excused himself from sending a copy on the grounds that the 'German* - - - - : had en.lolned eeerftcv upon him , The Residency Agent Shargah wrote two or three times for a copy, meanwhile the Resident being on tour at the end of October called at Sh&amp;rgah and asoertainid that a copy was still not forthcoming, but having regard to the purport of th® letter from Hassan to Abdul Latif dated 11th June which was now shown to the Resident was adviaed to write and repudiate th# contract. On 2nd November the fcingah Agent forwarded a copy obtained after a good deal of pressure. It was found to SSrd August 1906, 87th August 1906, 14th October 1906. 7th Hovember 1906,f / to be In English and not German ae pretended Hasaan 3^3 and the terms of it were in parte open to objection. 2nd November 1906.

Abdul Latif however continued to press for it and 11th Hovesaber 1906. 16th December 25rd January 1906. a/ - a at last- on 16th December fiaesan sent a copy to hia. On getting it, or soon after, Abdul Latif wrote on behalf of his son and objected to the terms of it. Meanwhile authority was received by the Resident from the Government of India to discuss the question with the Sheikh of Shargah, and in the result the latter addressed riaasan a oomiuunication intimating the imllif&amp;oation of the Concession, Esa bin Abdul Latif protesting against Hassan* s conduct simultaneous ly. In spite of the evidence to the contrary forthcoming in his previous letters, Hassan Basaiyeh now began t© pretend that he had sent Abdul Latif a copy of the deddJ when first asked, and that the latter had agreed after Seeing it. 8th March 1907 He also complained to the Residency in an un dated letter received 12th March 1907 making the same allegation namely that he had sent Abdul Latif the terms of the Agreement in English and Arabic in the first instance and that it had been agreed to by Esa and his father. 18th March 1907 This appears to be absolutely untrue, see Hassan's letter of 11th June %o Abdul Latif and subsequent cor respondence showing that h© intentionally kept the terms eecret. It is to be noted that the letter of Abdul Latif to Eassan dated 27th !»aroh 1907 is the same as enclosure 10 in the uennan Oase, but there is some divergence in our translation. 27th «arch 1907 The two letters dated 30th ' arch 1907, but- unsignedunsigned thoush apperentljr fro., ^ Ab&lt;#ul ^ and th. shellch of Sh.rgW. can foP no cp60lM reaRrk&gt; Fma th« above papers it k« xz w111 hB »e®® that whereas th® Hasidsnoy Agont at Lingah waa %r4»4i SM « ' 8 vl SllaHt and astut# throughout in connection with the conduct of th-i* -wig concession# th® behaviour of our Sharsah Ag^nt waa not alto se tl 1Br f r6e Wmi ,, hi tr aui me, I thins, that he is not a man of bualnson, and did not at first reaiia^ ♦*,« _ ^ 09 tho sarlouB poBslbUlttes of Hassan samai yell .s raiatlona with the Oeramn Pin..

I have come to know that on let June 1906 (6th fiabl-iil-Thani 1324) the said fiaji Hassan entered into a contract with a European iaerchan|t named Wonokhaus, without consulting and that according to the terras of the docun&amp;nt he bound hinaelf and his partners in giving an absolute monopoly for the extraction of the He* oxide for a period of 4 years. And the said Hajl Hassan executed this Agreement and bound hissself without consulting roe previous to the drawing of the deed of contract. The details of the said deed have only now reached me, and I do not agree to the terms of this contract. Accordingly I forward to your honour a copy of the deed of contract fior you to examine? kindly look into it. I beg from your honour assistance in taking the necessary steps for the caAoellation and annulment of this contract, for I am altogether unwilling to agree to this lease. Previous to this I haw written to Hajl Hassan Saraaiyeh expressing ay disagreement to this coh- tract, but he has sent me no answer. Finally I am obliged to call your attention to the deed of contract in the beginning of which begins as follows; •Contract between Haji Haesan bin All Samiyeh of lingah owner and hold er' of the Abu Husa Concession, and Mr. Robert Tonckhaus of Lingah*.

Abdul Latif bin Abdur Rahman. m : A.C. four esteemed letter dated this month has been received and your friend has understood it® contents especially your remarks in regard to my contract with the Gernan to the effect that it is not a question of the sale of the red oxide only as I had informed you previously. %ur^Uitr, what is prevod to me is this that it is really only (for) the sale of the red oxide but for a specified period a certain quantity every year until the expiration of the period. It Is not a lease of the island. Deeds of contracts and conditions for sales are always (made) on these lines. He agreed to take a certain quantity froai me every year and I agreed to ex cavate the oxide from the nines and to deliver it to hia as long as there exists red oxide in the same ouality as before, 'very person *hen he sells anything must necessarily take out s deed of sale and this is not a leas® once for all. You know that I will not be entrapped either by the Gersan or others but perhaps you are being forced to dispute about this; for the rest the Geraan has bought some red oxid® and nothing else froa the lease holders of the oincs at Abu v .usa island; Hassan bin All &amp; Co. mJ ' ^ JTvon were w© to convey the mxAmsoxide him to Ling'&gt;h - ifi ir Lx-voS the expenBBs thereof being paid by us - he would have no object- tion neither would he ^av# any thing to say about the island or be-ou Ce-sr: the possession of it. Notwithstanding thie, when I received S ' OA letters from you on this subject (saying) that surely the con tract oould be nullified, I communicated with hi® regarding the nullification of the same. He replied *if you suggest any inter ference in the island, I (the Genaan) will writ© a document for you(to the effect) that I have no concern in the lease of the islandisland • 1 have slnmly bought oxj.de from the less® holdere ©f th© Mines on the island of Abia Kusa for a epecified period in the same Ra otners buy from you. I hare been in deallnge th axl c-ne merchants of the Pereiaa and Arab CoaAt® and there has not been the least confusion in our intercourse with the peopxei and ii you are not satisfied with th® writing and wish notning but the nullification of thie contract all right, but please pay me 15 shillings per ton according to the contract and ale© tae raoney I paid for expenses. If you pay me the money, I will no longer require the agreement and will relinquish it. .■therwi' e it ic not possible for roe to abandon my rights. We are not sitting here to play games in business setters. We act in accordance with rules'. 3ow^ If you think it advisable write hia a letter and give him explanations regarding the nullification of the contract. Perhaps |ie will agree, otherwise, as far a# I can Judge, I have not the power to depart froa what has par-sed in the way of'son- dltioas of sale except after the expiry ©f the period according to the deed of agroeaent. And you are the wisest ©f the learned. It Is proved to you that I did not do (this) until I was satis fied that you would approve of this transaction. You had better drop discussion about this bepjuks© the road is closed (to any discussion). If the Uerman says he will write you a letter according to your desire saying that he has no concern in the island or in the mines on the island and that he has only purchased from the lease-holders of the island, Hassan bin All &amp; 0© the red oxide which is being excavatad from the mines on the island, he las left no grounds for further nrgumentand you are aware that aush a wholesale transaotion cannot be obtained »t all times; and that we have spent considerable over this since wo leased Zkm.this mine up to the present.

After ooaplimentc. • lUi the higheet reopeot I beg to represent that I have learnt that Sheikh Sagar bin Khalid in pursuance of the advice of the Britloh Oovcrnment has arranged that Kasaan bin All Ganaiyeh, should the German Firm ask him to ship the oxide which is lying on the beach of the island and ready for ohipaent, should be permitted to ship it on specific conditions. Seeing that I was originally a partner in the said concession, I have thought it necessary to make the following representation to you. It is now ten years since the commencement of the lease, and in the beginning it was agreed between ua partners that no sale or transaction should be coanleted without consultation with all? and in this past period Haji Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh extracted a large amount of oxide from the xaines of Abu usa Island, and he hai been always accumulating it against the a time that he might find^purchaser, so that the oxide sight be ready for sale. Thus I opine that frora the oonasenoement up till now he has sold probably 3000 tons and now there is probably available In the island some 6000 tons or more, r#hich they have extracted from the mines a long time since, out of that is the quantity which as mentioned above they have brought down to the sea shore for shipment by Geman Ship? I have not ceased to ask hln .(Hassan) to render an account but have not obtained It, and Kajl Hassan has not given anyone anything whatever? and I fear that by reason of the termination of the oonceseion it is orobable that Hajl Hassan will put the whole of this oxide to his own credit and seeing that this oxide which is available there was extracted before the inci dence of Hassan ' s agreement with V-onokhaus which I did not agree to, find in any case previous to the annuls nt of the deed of lease by Sheikh Sagar, I consider myself entitled to my share in all the oxide ' 1 (Ttll1T&gt;i ioxldo that ha® beon extracted. I have therefor© informed you and beg fro® your kindness that Haji liasean should be called upon to place his accounts before you fro® first to last, 00 that he may not alter or change the account and that there be a dlvisioh ac cording to shares, bo that each say tale his »hare.Uxab 9X- ; 3Tu3ci.

Sketch map of Abu Musa Island. , I have since passed in | connection with the | projected removal of j certain oxide lying | on the beach at Abu 1 Musa. i I 2. On leaving Buohire on 14th February, I proceeded to Lingah and sent for Haji Hassan bin All damaiyeh in order to enquire from him whether, supposing that Messrs Wonckhaus asked him and that 1 could obtain Sheikh Sagar's acquiescence, he was prepared to ship the oxide referred to, said to amount to about 20no tons. He replied that he was willing to do so but went on to explain that there was a great deal more than 2^00 ton® of oxide lying on the island ready excavated and that it would take not three weeks but from 2 to 3 months to clean and ship it. I did not then enter into any argu ment with him, but merely exnlained that the present question was simply474 simply on© oi quipping certain heaps 7 lying with hia boats and g08,r, on toe seaohor® ready or nenrly ready Tor loading. H® re plied that he was rilling to do as directed. 3» On -Leaving Lingah 1 proceeded to Abu hiuoa to see the various accumulations of oxide for myself, and now forward a sketch map of the inland to acalo showing the position of them. x should oxpxain here that ever oince the grant of the o«s9ion in 1698» the Concessionaires hav# apparaj^tly amsll number of coolies permanently employed in excavating the oxide and colxeoting it in heaps near the pits so that when any sal® is effected the stuff may be more handy for transport to the seashore. Ti*« process of'cleaning' the material simply consists of crushing the earth in course of which operation, stones, lutips etc are eliminated r'rom it. 4» in view of the evident hop© which existed in the concession aire's mind that under the present permission he might be able to handle all the oxide already excavated, I was at paifaa to ensure uiat in the letter written by Uheikh Sagar to ansan Ganayieh and in ray communication giving cover thereto, it should be mad® quit© clraar which heaps of oxide and which only were now under discus sion. 1 tools the same precautions in my interview with Dr. Lieteraann on 26th February and in my confirmatory jbetter to him dated 4th I arch. He in return assured me that there was no misunderstanding on this point; that he Quite understood that the only oxide in question was that referred to lying on the beach near the huts and that he ha^ made it quite clear in his communication to M oovbs wonckhaue that there was to be absolutely no communication with the mines themselves, nor were the coolies to go near them. He fully concurred in the contents of the letters shown him. 5. I now request reference to th« enclosed sketch of the island from which the position will b« rendered clear. The presence of oxide is sho^n by red wash at 3 places, X , y, &amp; z. Tfcwre is no mine of oxide at Z which is merely the most convenient place from which the loading of it on to steamers can be effected. There are borings at X 4 Y and lying above the excavatiohs are sundry heaps7. rn / / heaps Ox oxide* At each pjbaoe (X y) there are apparently about 8000 to 3000 tone, accumulated as far a® one can estimate without experiment# The quality at Y is not good and was not approved by i easra •onokhaus# but the probability is that it is surrepti tiously used for adulteration where possible. It is the localities X &amp; only which are concerned with the present dispute. From X to the seashore at the distance is about 1^ miles, the ground perfectly flat and the going good; but in order to iacilitate the work of the transport carts employed a hard track of rammed oxide hes been made# I have not modified Commander Philbrick* s figures estimating the content of the several heaps at as he measured them system- atioally, but except by actual weighment of some of the oxide, it is impossible to gauge it accurately and I think the present figures will prove to be too lafge. 6# ?/hlle at Ling eh I was careful not to enter into discussion with Hassan Camaiyoh or to treat him in a way which might give the German firm cause to think that I had been putting pressure on him, but I asked him to give me a copy of his transfer deed with Lir® iirown, dated 10th October, and also inquired whether he had received his moiety according to the terms of his agreement for the oxide now to be shipped. He would not give a direct answer on this point saying that he had received large sums from Messrs Wonckhaus entered in a running account and he could not say how he stood without going into that account fully. It seems to me pronable that the line he will take in order to justify his conduct of the concession vis a vis his former co-sharers and to play into Wonokhaus hands will be to endeavour to show (with Messrs Wonckhaus' assistance), that the firm ha® advanced him in cash more than the value of the oxide hitherto received; that he is still indebted to them and has nothing to divide, but that on the contrary the Gorman firm have claims on all the oxide in the island. F or this reason it seems important that we should get pooses- aion of his account books without delay.7. Th» Heaidonoy Agent Lingali left her# by mall on 88th February with the letters for Llngah and haa inetructiona to prpoeed to Abw Muaa trhen Haeaan Samalyeh r s party does, and to remain en- camped there during the preparation®.

Major, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.(6). m regarding the Abu Musa Dlaputo, \ 1) „ In cstae w# might at some future time want to ecquire the Island of Abu Musa and in view of the faot that the German Case admits that the Island is part of the territory of the sheikh of Jhargah and he under our protection, it seems unncessary for us to eay anything more than that and better for us not to nuggest that the island is the property of the tribe vested in a Ruling Sheikh, who has no power to alienate. As a matter of faot the Jowasim tribes have dwindled down to about a dozen members, all immediate relations of the present Sheikh, so that he and his family are now synonymous with the 'Jowasim tribe'. (2). Sheikh Salim scouts the idea that the Germans can possess any documents indicating ownership by him, as alleged in para graph (1) of their Case, (3), There is nothing remarkable in Sheikh Sagar having asked for a share in the oxide company nor is his doing so in any way in compatible with his ownership of the island. On the contrary it seems perfectly natural for a person placed in the position of him ol? Sheikh Salim to wish to beoone a sleeping partner in such a concern and to have a share in th® profits if there were going to be any. As soon as he saw that on the contrary he might have to put his hand in his pocket he severed his conneotion with the speoulation. (4). The Residency Agent at Shargah keeps press-books for his private correspondence. He went through these with m® but one or two letters which appareently passed from him to Hassan either had not been entered or were too faint to read. He assures me however that he does not in the least fear anything that Hassan can produce in his writing and that nothing exists mors committing than is found in letters already forthcoming. (5). Enclose 3 of the German Case. The words ' So long as the mines are workable and in lease* clearly show that the termination of the lease by either party was contemplated.(6)- I^plo8ure ¥ IZaaiOl. The letter which Kaeean refers to as 'the letter in which Abdul Lstif agrees to the Contract* is olearly that of i;lBt Rabi-el-Thani 1324. He never seriously quote any other, though in other places he pretends that he sent Abdul Latif a copy of the Contract with translayion alongside vide Enclosure 14 lines 14 and 15. (7). the conduct of Mr. Brown in the present case in going over to Abu ?'usa with a German Flag to protect the rights of this Company gives us reasonable grounds to suppose that were the pretended s^are of Messrs Wonckhaus in the leas®, allowed t® stand, the first thing the G®raan Finn would do in the event of a dispute with the Sheikh of JShargah or other Concessionaires would be to hoist the German Flag over the Mines. The evident possibility of such action on their part seems to bring the Case within the scope of Article III of the Treaty of 1892 with the Trucial Oheikhs. Lease to a British subject is quite a different matter, be cause if the latter gives trouble the protecting power can at one® clear him out, and there is no question ofnoomplioation arising from the presence of a foreign flag.

To my mind the obvious translation of the phrase is, 'The annulment of this agreement is better than its acceptance.' I do not think it is at all obvious or possible to translate the sentence, 'The annulment of this agreement is better than to comply with his wishes.' This translation is, to my mind, a forced one, and not the natural significance of the words in ctuestion, whatever be their 'connection. I am confirmed in this opinion after consulting with one or two Arabs concerning the popular use of the pronoun in such a sent ence, and I find that they agree v /ith me that there is a great looseness in the use of the feminine or masculine pronoun at the close of a clause or sentence. I am sure that nine out of ten Arabs would give the pre ference to the former translation of the sentence as the obvious and natural intention of the writer. Although my opinion does not carry weight beyond that ofThe Moslem World A QUARTER l_ Y REVIEW OF CURRENT EVENTS, LITERATURE AND THOUGHT AMONG MOHAMMEDANS AND THE PROGRESS OF MISSIONS IN MOSLEM LANDS SAMUEL M ZWEMER..

As to what you had stated that any one wish ing to violate the Regulations of the Maritime Peace will oe repelled, whether he be Salim or any one else. This is certain to us, but according to what we stated to you for merly regarding the Island of Bu Musa, viz that it belongs to Shargah and is our own town and you have information about it, if Salim desires to dwell therein and to stop there and if a guarantee is obtained from him that no in cidents will be caused by him which may annoy firstly our selves and then yourselves and that there would be no dis turbances, then it does not matte . But we cannot dispense with the Island and it is of great use to us. We request you to furnish us with definite information and to advise your Agent thereof. Secondly, you have stated that complaints have been made against us by your subjects residing in my town. These af fairs are not as represented, but exaggerations have been made against ua. Your Agent has inquired into them, and God willing you will not see anything on our part except what is desired by you as in the past and we are always observing obedience toANNEX { ).

A.G., writing The object of/this letter is firstly greeting and secondly to Inquire after your health. May you ever be xavoured with all what is good. On these parts the movements are quiet and the affirs are satisfactory by the grace of God. We sent you a letter previously but no reply has come from you and we do not know what it was that has prevented it. IVe hope it a propitious one. Further, the condition which has already been arranged between us and Sheikh Salim through the medium of the Sheikhs Honeid bin Abdullah and Hashar bin Maktoom is not hidden from you. On the present date, there took place an assembly of the aforesaid Sheikhs with us and they asked Salim for adherence in accordance with the arrange ment existing between us and him,' and they did not gain the object from him but withdre what had been undertaken by them for him and acquitted us of the guarantee which they had given for us and to us. And the condition which (existed) between us and Salim has been disturbed at present. You know that he is residing at Bu Musa Island, which as you know, belongs to Shargah and perhaps mischiefs will emanate from him and evil doings. Firstly he will disturb the Maritime peace for the reason that he is residing in the island, oecondly, as we have mentioned to you, it is a dependency of , uargah and is our town and we will not grant it to any one. And you have Information about it, and its affairs are not hidden from you. We request you to warn Sheikh Salim that ii he desires to dwell at Bu Musa a guarantee should be forth-comingC£f- -orthcoming from you for him that he will not creatsany mis chief which may annoy us and you in regard to the Maritime poao Should that (guarantee) not be obtained from him, it will be for you to decide whether you wish to expel him from the island or put up with what now exists between us. If he trans gressed against us or if we transgressed against him, then there should be no argument. Tour opinion is the higher. This is what was necessary to be stated and you may hint to me whatever that may be necessary. May you continue to be pre served. Greeting!- »iiiiiii • ', I ANNEX ( ).

You had mentioned to me about the Island of Tomb, (stat ing) that you have received letters from the Government Ageiit and Sheikh Qmlifah that I desired to take possession of the Island. Please note, my friend, that I have not entered upon the Island of Tomb with any special purpose, but that the Islands of Tomb, Abu j usa and Sir are the dependencies of the Qov.asem of Oman and my (grand) father, the late Sultan, retained their possession in his lifetime, and the Island of Henjam belongs to the family of Bu Saeed and the Islands of Gerri and llabiyu to the Qowasem of Fars. This is known to all the people, so much so that Tollasan, inhabitant of Debai settled down at Tomb for three or four years and ray (grand) father Sultan went to him and expel.©d him from there; and he is now at Henjam. I have proofs of this and think that you will not ignore this. And as regards sheikh Khalifah (my) condition and his are one (i.e. we are jointly united) and there is no (question of) islands or anything else betveen us. Che property is one (i.e. we are so united that we are partners in our respective property). But this year there was a necessity for me, owing to the (prosence of) locusts and the absence of vegetation, and we sent our horses and animals there so that the donkeys may be im proved by feeding on the grass. And I advised Sheikh Khalifah that he should prevent the A1 Bu Someith from coming and using, a? i t using the vegetation and destroying it, but tiiat if he j (himself) sent horses etc., it would not matter. He returned no reply to me and I heard that the A1 Bu Someith had stated . \ i ve will pass over (to the Island) without the consent of \ ■ I ;&gt;heil:h i'.halifah and will not care for hira'. When I heard this I advised him about it and advised the Government Agent, so that he nay prevent them from making mischief. This is the nature of what took nlace, so that you may be aware. And MtHsxHX even if they pass over (to the Island) it would not bo necessary for me to proceed against them because (our respective) communities are one. So that you may know and salaams.ANNEX ( ).

Now, this year, grass has been destroyed in our side owing to abundance of locusts and we sent our horses and all the animals to the Island of Tomb. And I have received a reoort that after the 'id' (festival) the A1 Bu Sonelth will go over to the island and consume the vegetation which ie there; and this is detrimental to ub; and during our interview with brother Sheikh Khalifah I informed him (of this) but he has negligence and pre- crastination. So, please warn them and note that if they massed over to the island I will, inevitably, send men to turn them out of it and no blame will attach with me. I have informed yon of this, so that you ^ay be aware of those circumstances. I expect a rersly and salaams. sai AMEX ( ).

It has been customary from old times for the Chief of Shargah to send his cattle to that Island and the peonle of Debai sent sore horses and cattle there some time ago and a dispute took place between the two Sheikhs about that island. I tv/ice wrote to the Chief of Debai to keep away from that Island but received no satisfactory reply. This proceeding on the nart of the Sheikh of Debai becoming known, the Sheikh of Shargah ordered 30 boats to be prepared to go there also manned and armed for war. Seeing that much disturbance would ensue, from this move on the island and at the sea, I went to the Sheikh, Salem, and after much difficulty nersuaded him in abandoning his Intention. He then ordered the boats not to move. I wrote thereon to the Chief of Debai to bring back his horses and cattle fron the Island of Boo «usa that this cause for quarrel may cease among them all. By a mere chance the weather was unfavourable for the boats proceeding to Bu Musa fro r : Debai and they did not suc ceed in reaching the island and had to return to Debai with their animal g . The Chief of Debai replied to my letter that he had given up his- intentioas in regard to the Island. I enclose the correspondence that took place on this subject between the Sheikh of Debai and myself. fANNEX ( ). Copy of a letter from Oolonel E.G. ross.

Sheikh Salin bin Cultan to whom the Persian Deputy Go- vernor of Lingah addressed a demand for the extradition of an inhabitant of Sirri Island was formerly Chief of Shargah, but at prenont han no right to ex^ercioe jurisdiction any where, so it is necessary to consider this particular case, in its present form more thoroughly. No doubt, however, we may be prepared to hear of further similar demands on the Trucial Chiefs of Oman. Up to the srenent time the Governors of Lingah were Arabs, v kinsmen of the Oman Joasimins and they freely communicated with one another on matters affecting their common interests. Mow that the Persians have assume^ direct administration the circunstances are altered and I think it is necessary to cise a closer supervision over the correspondence between the Persian Authorities and the Trucial Chiefs.Liz A 'SRX ( ).

Your esteemed letter dated 4th Rabi II was received by us through the hands of the Honoured Haji Abul Qaaim bin Abbas, and we understood its contents and we were most pleased for it. As to what you had stated that any one wish ing to violate the Regulations of the Maritime Peace will be repelled, whether he be Salim or any one else. This is certain to us, but according to what we stated to you for merly regarding the Island of Bu Musa, viz that it belongs to Shargah and is our own town and you have information about it, if Salim desires to dwell therein and to stop there and if a guarantee is obtained from him that no in cidents will be caused by him which may annoy firstly our selves and then yourselves and that there would be no dis turbances, then it does not matter. But we cannot dispense with the Island and it is of great use to us. We reqiiest you to furnish us with definite information and to advise your Agent thereof. Secondly, you have stated that complaints have been made against us by your subjects residing in my town. These af fairs are not as represented, but exaggerations have been made against us. Your Agent has inquired into them, and God willing you will not see anything on our part except what is desired by you as in the past and we are always observing obedience , tolib to the High Government. This is what had to be stated and please do not discontinue your good news from us and mention to us all you may require. And Greeting.ANNEX ( ).

On these parts the movements are quiet and the affirs are satisfactory by the grace of God. We sent you a letter previoxisly but no reply has come from you and we do not know what it was that has prevented it We hope it a propitious one. Further, the condition which has already been arranged between us and Sheikh Salim through the medium of the Sheikhs Homeid bin Abdullah and Hashar bin Maktoom is not hidden from you. On the present date, there took place an assembly of the aforesaid Sheikhs with us and they asked Salim for adherence in accordance with the arrange ment existing between us and himj and they did not gain the object from him but withdrew what had been undertaken by them for him and acquitted us of the guarantee which they had given for us and to us. And the condition which (existed) between us and Salim has been disturbed at present. You know that he is residing at Bu Musa Island, which as you know, belongs to Shargah and perhaps mischiefs will emanate from him and evil doings. Firstly he will disturb the Maritime peace for the reason that he is residing in the island. Secondly, as we have mentioned to you, it is a dependency of Shargah and is our town and we will not grant it to any one. And you have information about it, and its affairs are not hidden from you. We request you to warn Sheikh Salim that if he desires to dwell at Bu Muea a guarantee should be forth-cominglis forthcoming from you for him that he will not createany mia- ohief which may annoy ub and you in regard to the Maritime peace Should that (guarantee) not be obtained from him, it will be for you to decide whether you wish to expel him from the island or put up with what now exists between us. If he trans gressed against us or if we transgressed against him, then there should be no argument* Your opinion is the higher. This is what was necessary to be stated and you may hint to me whatever that may be necessary. May you continue to be pre served. Greeting IANNEX ( ).
