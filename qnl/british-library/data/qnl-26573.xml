CONFIDENTIAL. ^ (15803) Section 1. [E 3/3/25] Copy No. 1 r) S SECRET. Ibn Saud’s Claim to A kaba and Maan. [An explanatory map is attached; for other maps which may be useful in this connexion, see page 18 of the Report of the Royal Commission on Palestine (1937 : Cmd. 5479), and the map attached to the Foreign Office memorandum entitled “ The Frontiers between Transjordan and Nejd and Transjordan and the Hejaz ” (Cfl. 15789).] AMONG the territorial questions in dispute, though not in active dispute, between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Arabian Government, is a claim by Ibn Saud, which he has inherited from King Hussein of the Hejaz, to the districts of Akaba and Maan in what is now Transjordan. 2. In considering this claim from the legal aspect there are two main points to be borne in mind :— (1) The historical and administrative position of Akaba and Maan in the Ottoman Empire. (2) Ihe manner in which the question of sovereignty has been affected by conquest, occupation and administration, and by certain measures of Allied and British policy, during and since the War of 1914-18. 3. The position as regards (1) can be stated quite briefly. In 1886 the Sanjak of Maan (which included Akaba) was transferred from the Ottoman Vilayet of Syria to the Ottoman Vilayet of the Hejaz. In 1894 it was restored to the Vilayet of Syria, and remained part of that vilayet until after the outbreak of the Great War. In 1915 the Vilayet of Syria was extended southward so as to include portions of the Vilayet of the Hejaz down to Wejh and El Ala, the line between these two points marking the recognised northern limits of the Hejaz in the old sense of the Holy Land of Islam. That this line is the boundary of the Holy Land can be confirmed from history and is of importance as providing a refutation of the argument sometimes put forward (see paragraph 15 below) that Maan and Akaba should rightly belong to “ the Hejaz,” because they are part of the Holy Land. In 1916 the Turkish Government, for reasons of wartime expediency, enlarged the Sanjak of Medina so as to include Akaba. No other administrative change seems to have been made by them before the conclusion of hostilities. Historically, therefore, Syria would appear to have, if anything a somewhat stronger claim to Akaba and Maan than has the Hejaz ' 4. The position is more difficult as regards (2), since the history of the disputed districts after the revolt of the Shereef of Mecca (afterwards King Hussein of the Hejaz) in 1916, is very complicated. In 1917 the Shereef captured Akaba from the Turks, and his troops remained in effective occupation Oa the place until 1919. Although it appears that the British authorities had at the time no intention of committing themselves as to the future status of Akaba, and indeed considered that it should remain in British hands after the war it also appears that it was thought impolitic to emphasise to the leader of town ^ reVOlt at that Stage th6 temporary nature of his own occupation of the n 5 - ^. fte ^ 1 the the conquered territories were divided bv General Sir Edmund Allenby into various spheres. Akaba was not at the time specifically included m the provisional area known as “Occupied Enemv Territory (East) ; Maan may or may not have been intended to fall within thn'f area. On the other hand, Sir Edmund Allenby was, in January 1918 given bv His Majesty s Government supreme authority as far south as ’ the line [805 m—1] B2 Ras Fartak-Tebuk, 100 miles south of Akaba, although King Hussein was not told of this. Later, Sir Edmund Allenby’s Headquarters definitely asserted that Akaba had always fallen within “ Occupied Enemy Territory (East), and claimed that “ no civil or military appointments there could be recognised unless made by Damascus^) with the Commander-in-chief’s approval.” 6. ' But even Sir Edmund Allenby’s claim that he was responsible for Akaba A and Maan was not apparently meant to prejudice their future status, foi^ Colonel C. E. Wilson, the British agent at Jedda, was instructed by His Majesty’s High Commissioner at Cairo in January 1919, to explain the position as regards appointments at Akaba to King Hussein, and in so doing to “ point out that the King’s renunciation will be short-lived, since Akaba must very soon cease to be a military base and return to a small village.” 7. In November and December 1919 His Majesty’s Government, as a matter of high policy, withdrew British troops and control from the southern or B Area of cc Occupied Enemy Territory (East),” leaving it entirely to the Arab administration at Damascus. The British withdrawal seems to have terminated any exercise of British authority in Akaba. 8. In August 1920, however, His Majesty’s Government adopted a plan for the reoccupation of the territory east of the Jordan with the consent of the inhabitants, and a number of British political officers went there at the invitation of various Transjordan notables who invoked British help in organising a local government. The question arises whether this invitation could be held to include a return to Maan and Akaba and to the position His Majesty’s Government had asserted there in 1919. It is difficult to contend that the invitation had this effect, in view of the fact that both Akaba and Maan were at that time under Hejaz administration. 9. But, whatever the theoretical position may have been, it is interesting to note that when, after the reoccupation of Transjordan, the attitude of His Majesty’s Government gradually crystallised into a determination that Maan and Akaba should be retained for Transjordan, which at about this time came under the rule of the Amir Abdullah, one of King Hussein’s sons, this object was always envisaged as being achieved with the consent of, and by agreement with, the Hejaz authorities. The question of Maan and Akaba was thus, in fact, left over after the war for friendly arrangement with King Hussein, although it was certainly the intention of His Majesty’s Government to induce him to give way to them. 10. King Hussein’s obstinate attitude, however, made a friendly arrange ment impossible. For instance, the policy of His Majesty’s Government found expression in the instructions issued to Lieutenant-Colonel S. C. Knox, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, before the Koweit Conference in December 1923, that he should attempt to obtain the acceptance by both King Hussein and Ibn Sand of the proposal that the Transjordan-Hejaz boundary should run westwards from the point of intersection of meridian 38° east with parallel 29° 35' north to a point on the Hejaz Railway in the neighbourhood of Mudawara, and thence to a point on the Gulf of Akaba south of Akaba town. This attempt to reach agreement failed, however, owing to King Hussein’s refusal to send a delegate to the conference. 11. The situation changed completely with the advance of Ibn Saud against the Hejaz in 1924 and the collapse of Hejaz authority in the area in question. Hitherto the question of Maan and Akaba had been one for friendly negotiation with King Hussein. Indeed, there was, even as late as October 1924, a distinct possibility that Akaba town itself might be left to the Hejaz. But the advance of Ibn Saud put an end to this policy of patience and it became necessary to consider the defence of Transjordan and Palestine against invasion by the Wahabi troops. The strategic frontier required for this purpose had to include both Maan and Akaba. 12. A message from His Majesty’s Government was therefore conveyed to Ibn Saud by the Political Agent at Bahrein in a letter dated the 21st October, 1924, to the effect that His Majesty’s Government would regard unprovoked aggression beyond a line running from the point of intersection of meridian ( 1 ) Where an Arab administration under the Amir Feisal had been set up. Although he was King Hussein’s son, his acceptance did not mean that the peoples of Damascus and the other liberated Arab territories considered themselves in any way under King Hussein’s authority.38° east with parallel 29° 35' north to a point on the Hejaz Railway 2 miles south of Mudawara, and thence to a point on the Gulf of Akaba 2 miles south of Akaba town, as an attack upon territory for which they were responsible. 13. In May 1925 it was reported that Ibn Saud was contemplating the despatch of a force against Akaba, and a further message was sent to him, in which it was declared that His Majesty’s Government could not allow Akhwan ^forces to violate this line, that if such forces attempted to enter Akaba His Majesty’s Government would take the necessary steps to eject them, and that His Majesty’s Government were taking steps to establish the authority of the Transjordan administration in the whole area comprised within the boundary communicated to Ibn Saud in October 1924. Ibn Saud replied that he had noted the contents of this communication, and called oh his troops. 14. In October 1925, on the occasion of the negotiations for the settlement of the frontier between Transjordan and Nejd which culminated in the Hadda Agreement of the 2nd November, 1925 (Cmd. 2566), Ibn Saud was informed of His Majesty’s Government’s decision that the frontier line between Transjordan and the Hejaz should eventually be drawn in accordance with the declarations referred to in the two preceding paragraphs. 15. When, after the final conquest of the Hejaz by Ibn Saud, it was decided to enter into negotiations with him for a new treaty, it was proposed that a protocol should be attached to the treaty, embodying Ibn Saud’s agreement to the Hejaz-Transjordan boundary claimed by His Majesty’s Government. Ibn Saud at first presented a counter-request for the return to the Hejaz of the Maan- Akaba district. When it was made clear to him that His Majesty’s Government had no intention of receding from their attitude in the matter, he withdrew his request, and suggested that the whole matter should be dropped from the negotiations, saying that acceptance of the proposed frontier would expose him to severe criticism in the Moslem world for having ceded a portion of the Holy Land of Islam to Great Britain, and that the question should be left over until a more favourable moment. At the same time, he stated his readiness to pledge himself secretly not in practice to raise the subject or question the occupation and administration of the district by the officers of His Majesty’s Government. Moreover, after further pressure, Ibn Saud eventually proposed, albeit reluctantly, that he should give a guarantee in writing to respect the status quo for the time being. After much discussion, it was agreed that this guarantee should be included in an exchange of notes to be attached to the Treaty of Jedda (Cmd. 2951), which was eventually signed on the 20th May, 1927. 16. In these notes,(') which were dated the I9th May and 21st May, Sir Gilbert Clayton, on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, defined the frontier on the lines already indicated in the present memorandum, and Ibn Saud, after stating that he found it impossible in the present circumstances to effect a final settlement of this question, went on to say that nevertheless, out of friendship for His Majesty’s Government, he desired to express his willingness to maintain the status quo in the Maan-Akaba district and not to interfere in its adminis tration until favourable circumstances would permit a final settlement of the question. 17. But in addition to the published notes, there is also a secret, unpublished note,( 3 ) dated the 21st May, 1927, in which Ibn Saud stated that his request for the postponement of any settlement of this question had not been dictated by any desire on his part to dispute the ownership of the territory in question, but only his fear lest, owing to the activities of his enemies, his acceptance of the frontier proposed by His Majesty’s Government might be seized upon as a weapon for hostile criticism against him; and that, when it became necessary to effect the final settlement of the question His Majesty’s Government would find him willing to abide by whatever decision they might think just, 18. The question remains up to the present time as defined in these notes, and confirmed, so far as the official notes were concerned, in an exchange of notes( 4 ) (Cmd. 5380) of the 3rd October. 1936, modifying the Treaty of Jedda. But when the report of the Royal Commission on Palestine was published in July 1937, Ibn Saud made it clear that if as a result of this report Transjordan eventually became independent of British control, he would expect Akaba and Maan to be made over to him. The possibility was accordingly explored of offering C) See Annex C. B 2 ( 2 ) See Annex A. [805 m—1] (•q See Annex B.4 A Ibn Saud a frontier rectification which, while transferring to Saudi Arabia the town of Akaba and some part of the region to the north and east, would still leave Transjordan (as well as Palestine) with direct access to the Cxulf of Akaba. It was eventually decided that the retention of the town itself was important strategicallv for'the defence of Transjordan,( 5 ) but no reply was, in the upshot, sent to Ibn Sand on this point and he did not raise it again. His action suggests, however, that he regards the secret assurance of the 21st May, 1927, as ai^^ assurance to His Majesty’s Government only, which does not invalidate any claim he may have against Transjordan. 19. In an Eastern Department memorandum of August 1926, the general position is summed up as follows :— “ Transjordan’s claim to the ownership of Akaba and Maan as against the claim of King Hussein, was never entirely established. The question was deliberately left over during the war for negotiations afterwards, and these negotiations never achieved finality. But we have never in any way admitted to Ibn Saud that he, as successor by conquest to the Kingdom of the Hejaz, was entitled to include Akaba and Maan in his kingdom. On the contrary, in all our dealings with Ibn Saud, we have adopted the consistent attitude that the boundary between the Hejaz and Transjordan runs south of Akaba and Mudawara. Ibn Saud has never categorically agreed to this boundary, but he has tacitly acquiesced in our contention. The disputed area is not historically part of the Holy Land of Islam, and any claims which King Hussein may have had to it were personal, and due to his occupation of the district as our ally during the Great War. Whatever obligations we may, therefore, have been under to King Hussein, have been liquidated by the fall of his dynasty.” 20. The problem probably presents itself to Ibn Saud in a somewhat different light. He probably feels that being at war with King Hussein he was entitled to take possession of all King Hussein’s territory if he could, and that he undoubtedly could and would have occupied that part of King Hussein’s territory represented by Akaba and Maan had not a third party, who had not been able to assert his claim to those places as against King Hussein, or had at any rate not seen fit to do so, suddenly stepped in and occupied the territory in question himself, instead of continuing to pursue the claim as against Ibn Saud by the same diplomatic methods which he had employed in the case of King Hussein. But all the same the argument indicated in the last two sentences of the preceding paragraph appears to be the best reply His Majesty’s Govern ment can make to any argument based on the events of 1916-20, which, as has been shown, throw some doubt on the intentions of His Majesty’s Government at the time as regards Maan, and even more so as regards Akaba. 21. In conclusion, it may be said that Ibn Saud’s claim has no merits in itself. Akaba—and still less Maan—are of no value to Saudi Arabia, which has a long coast-line and infinite stretches of desert. But both places, and especially Akaba, are of great importance to Transjordan, which has no other outlet to the sea. Eastern Department, Foreign Office, January 12, 1940. (*) -*!

Your Majesty, 1 HAVE the honour to remind your Majesty that, in the course oi our negotiations, which have happily resulted in the conclusion of a treaty ot friendship and good understanding between His Britannic Majesty and youi Majesty, the question of the frontier between the Hejaz and Transjordan was discussed, and I explained to your Majesty the position, as defined in a draft protocol submitted by me to you, which His Majesty’s Government have taken up on this question and to which they must adhere. His Majesty’s Government regard the above-mentioned frontier as being defined as follows :— “ The frontier between the Hejaz and Transjordan starts from the intersection of meridian 38° east and parallel 29° 35' north which marks the termination of the frontier between Nejd and Transjordan, and proceeds in a straight line to a point on the Hejaz Railway 2 miles south of Mudawwara. From this point it proceeds in a straight line to a point on the Gulf of Aqaba 2 miles south of the town of Aqaba.” Respects.

Jedda, October 3 ; 1936. ^ I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Royal Highness’s note of the 17th Rajab, 1355, corresponding with the 3rd October, 1936, in which you recall the fact that the period of seven years specified in article 8 of the Treaty of Jedda of the 20th May, 1927, corresponding with the 18th Zul Qa’da, 1345. expired on the 17th September, 1934, corresponding with the 8th Jumad ath-Thani, 1353, and that under the said article the operation of the said treaty may be terminated on six months’ notice of such termination being given by either ( G ) Treaty Series No. 25 (1927), Cmd. 2951.party to the other party. Your Royal Highness refers to the negotiations in which our two Governments have been engaged for some time past, with the.object of placing their relations on a more stable basis, and to the fact that, animated by a common desire to consolidate still further the friendly relations happily existing between them, they have, as a result of those negotiations, agreed to modify the ^conditions under which the said treaty may be terminated, and also certain of the ^provisions of the said treaty and of the letters exchanged between His Majesty King Abdul Aziz and Sir Gilbert Clayton at the time of the conclusion of the treaty, subject to certain stipulations which have been agreed upon and which are recited in your Royal Highness’s note under reference. I have the honour to confirm, on behalf of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, the agreement which has been reached and the stipulations to which it is subject, as follows:— * * # # * * * 4. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdbm take note of the reservation made in paragraph 4 of your Royal Highness’s note under reference, with regard to the Aqaba-Ma’an area, as set forth in the letter of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, King of Saudi Arabia, to Sir Gilbert Clayton, dated the 19th Zul Qa’da, 1345, corresponding with the 21st May, 1927, in reply to Sir Gilbert Clayton’s letter of the 19th May. 1927, corresponding with the 18th Zul Qa’da, 1345. My Government, for their part, adhere to the position defined in the said letter of Sir Gilbert Clayton. Annex D. When in September 1922 the status of Transjordan in relation to the mandate for Palestine was under discussion at Geneva, the representative of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom submitted a memorandum on the question (see Cmd. 1785). By this memorandum the council was invited to pass a resolu tion making certain provisions of the mandate applicable to “ the territory known as Transjordan, which comprises all territory lying to the east of a line drawn from a point 2 miles west of the town of Akaba, on the gulf of that name, up the centre of the Wady Araba, Dead Sea and River to its junction with the River Yarmuk; thence up the centre of that river to the Syrian frontier.” 2. So far as the strategic aspect is concerned, it seems that the roadstead off the coast between the town of Akaba and the Palestine frontier is as good as, if not better than, the roadstead off the town itself. But if the town did not belong to Transjordan, hostile forces or tribesmen, who would otherwise have no convenient point of concentration, would find it easier than at present to attack or raid South-Eastern Transjordan.^ ' (THIS DJGUlviENT I SECRET M&gt;£.(0) 215 K QQivjvil TTEij^ Off T^PilitTAL GOkklTTEiS SIaNHING O FRIGIaL SUB-GOMViITTBiE FOR QUESTIONS GONGLRNING gQR.Y of a letter from Mr. Go W.

New governor has been appointed to kaf and another 1 gather to febuk. 6 0 In view of above I suggest following course (a) that I should continue to deal with incidents in the neighbourhood of Transjordan-Nejd frontier on lines I have already followed, that is to refer to them as occasion arises in dis cussion of Trans jordan-Nejd. frontier but without going into de tail* (bj that I should address personal letter to Yusuf Yasin dealing separately with area between Rum and Akaba but without mentioning Tutun and expressing hope that recurrence will be avoided as, whilst exact frontier in this area is outside the scope, of present negotiations, it is certain that Transjordan territory was violated. (c) that very delicate question of enticement should be postponed until we see whether arrangements described in para graph 4 above produce more satisfactory situation. 6 . In making these suggestions I am influenced by my belief that Saudi patrols have of late refrained from further violation of Transjordan territory and by fact that during the past relations with Abdul Aziz Ibn Zeyd have been generally friendly.

MRo RENDSI, explained that the line which he had taken with Fuad Bey Hamza in the summer, as recorded in his letter of 19th July to Fuad Bey, had been entirely conditioned by the categorical statement of the authorities concerned that it was a matter of vital necessity to retain xor j_ransjordan the car track passing round the Maizila bluff to the east of the Jebel Tubaiko Had it not been for this, it would have been a comparatively simple matter to reach a settlement, and the very reasonable proposal put forward by Fuad Bey as his second alternative (summarised in paragraph 11 of Mr 0 .Rendel’s letter of 19th July) would no doubt have been generally acceptedo The situation had now been completely altered by the discovery by the local authorities of an alternative car track in this areas but His Majesty’s Government might now find themselves in an embarrassing position if they had to go back to the oaudi Governmenu and say that they had been wrong in the views they had -9-any premature expressed last July® Apart from this 9 acceptance of Fuad Bey’s proposal? before he had answered the proposals put forward by His Majesty’s Government? would probably arouse Saudi suspicions and might even end in Fuad’s proposal being withdrawn^ A discussion ensued on the best method of approach to the Saudi authorities, and it was generally agreed that it would be better, before any indication was given that His najesty’s Government would now accept Fuad Eey's proposal, to obtain a reply from him on the points referred to in paragraph 14 of hr. Rendel’s letter. It was generally agreed that Sir Andrew Ryan should be instructed in this sense. A full discussion took place on the question of the necessity for a frontier de-limitation commission in this area, which had been discussed at the 39th meeting of the Sub-Coimaittee, held on the 8th March, 1935, with particular reference to the cost involved. MR. HALE suggested that in the light of the latest information, and owing to the discovery of the alternative car track, such a commission might be un necessary. MR. RENDER'S view, however, was that in any event, whether a settlement were reached or not, an indeterminate frontier was full of danger, and the cost of such a commission would be negligible compared with what might have to be expended should any trouble arise. During discussion efforts were made to see whether it would be possible to obtain any estimate of what such a commission would cost. It was pointed out that the majority of the technical personnel would have to be provided by the War Office. It was, however, found impossible, at the meeting, to arrive at even an approximate estimate of the cost.the Colonial Office It was suggested that perhaps might put up this question to the Treasury* with a view to the matter being settled by the time Sir Andrew Ryan had approached Fuad Eey on the question of his proposals. But it was pointed out that His i ajesty’s Government were, in effect, committed to boundary delimitation by the letter already sent to Fuad Bey Haiuza, if the Saudi Government wished to adopt that alternative, and it was decided to take no action in the matter. CONCLUSION: THL SUB-COMhITTFS agreed (a) That Sir .Andrew Ryan should be instructed to remind Fuad Bey Hamza of his undertaking (recorded in paragraph 15 of hr. Rendel’s letter of 19th July, 1935, to Fuad Bey) to submit the proposals of His majesty's Government to King Ibn Baud; and to cress Fuad Eey for an early statement of the Saudi Government's views. (b) That Sir Andrew Ryan should be confidentially informed that, in view of the changed situation revealed by the despatch cf 27th December, 1935 from the High Commissioner for Trans- Jordan to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, His Majesty's Government would now be ready to accept the second of the two alternative proposals put forward by Fuad Bey on 15th July, as recorded in paragraph 11 of hr. Rendel's letter of 19th July, referred to above; but that His majesty's Government consider it preferable not to take the initiative in informing the Saudi Government to this effect. 2&gt; Whitehall Gardens, S.

Conclusion reached by Middle Fast Official Sub-Committee on 24th February (which is not modified by your telegram) is that, in view of complete change in situation produced by discovery of alternative car track avoiding easterly bend round Maizila Bluff (shown on 1918 mam as in Saudi territory), there is now every advantage in accenting Fuad Bey’s second alternative,as recorded in paragraph 11 of Mr. Rendel’s letter of 19th July to him. There are, however, obvious objections to taking initiative in so informing Saudi Government before latter have replied to proposals of His Majesty’s Government (see paragraph 15 of Mr. Rendel’s letter). 2. Best course will therefore be for you to take early oppor tunity to remind Fuad Bey orally of his undertaking to submit those proposals to Ibn Soud, and to press him for early state ment of Saudi views. 3. Next step will depend on Saudi reaction, but you should bear in mind position described above and do nothing likely to lead Fuad Bey to withdraw or modify the proposal which His Majesty’s Government would now be ready to accept. Presumably there is little prospect of Saudi Government accepting either of our proposals (although there would be no harm if they did), and in that case it may be easier to secure adoption of Fuad’s second alternative if this is eventually represented as a concession by His Majesty’s Government rather than if it is allowed to appear from the first that we should welcome it.

[E 4422/341/25] Record of Second Part of Fifth Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza at the Foreign Office on July 15, 1935. THE first part of this meeting was devoted to a brief discussion of the question of the dues paid on goods imported through Bahrein into Saudi Arabia, and is recorded separately. The following were present:— Mr. Rendel. Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi- Sir A. Ryan. Arabian Minister for Foreign Mr. Ward. Affairs). Mr. Malcolm. Mr. RENDEL recalled the protest which the Saudi Government had made, in their note of the 3rd February, 1935, to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, against the use by Transjordan car patrols of the track at a point named Thaniyya Taraif, and he reminded Fuad Bey that before leaving Jedda Sir A. Ryan had informed the Saudi Government that this question was necessitating exhaustive study owing to defects in the maps, but that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to discuss it with his Excellency Fuad Bey in London. In fulfilment of this promise, Mr. Rendel now wished to explain the situation which had arisen. Local investigations, which were still proceeding, had shown that many places on the Nejd-Transjordan frontier were not by any means in the positions m which they were shown on the 1918 “ International ” Asia 1 : 1,000,000 map. referred to in article 1 of the Hadda Agreement. In fact, that map had now been shown to be very seriously inaccurate. It had been compiled on reports supplied by travellers, but those reports were now being found to have contained progressive errors, which had caused a correspondingly progressive series of inaccuracies in the map. The final result was that many of the features on the 1918 map either were in a totally different position fronTthat shown on the map. or lay in an entirely different relationship towards each other from that shown, or, in some cases, did not exist at all. As a typical example, Mr. Rendel cited the route shown on the map as followed by Carruthers in 1909. This route was shown as passing diagonally from north-west to south-east through an apparent gap between the Jebel Tubeik and a small hill to the east of it called Thaila Maizila, and in this gap it was shown as crossing Captain Shakespeare’s route of 1914, so that on the map there was a continuous route round the Jebel Tubeik within Transjordan territory. But it now turned out that there was no such gap, and that the Thaila Maizila was merely a rocky spur of the Jebel Tubeik itself, and an integral part of the Tubeik massif. Mr. Rendel, turning to the map, explained the indications it gave of the mam intentions of the negotiators of the Hadda Agreement. It was clear that King Abdul^ Aziz, on the one hand, had sought to keep the whole of the Wadi Sirhan for Saudi Arabia, and that Sir Gilbert Clayton, on the other hand had sought to keep for Transjordan the whole of the Jebel Tubeik. This was the only explanation of the general line of the frontier, particularly at its southern end. The natural inference was that Sir G. Clayton, relying on the fact that the map showed Carruthers’ and Shakespeare’s routes as passing round the eastern end of the Jebel Tubeik, had drawn the southern end of the Transjordan-Nejd frontier, where it is shown on the 1918 map, with the object of leaving the route round the eastern end of the Jebel Tubeik entirely within Transjordan. Now. as Mr. Rendel had said, Carruthers’ route had proved an impossibility since the Jebel Tubeik massif and the eminence called Thaila Maizila were air part of the Transjordan-Nejd Frontier. [456 s—2] B0 -r same mountain and there was no practicable gap between them. On the othei hand, the British authorities in Transjordan, believing that the Hadda Agree ment entitled them to a track round the eastern end of the Jebel Tubeik within Transjordan territory, had naturally made use of the existing track nearest to the mountain. In so far as this track could be plotted at all on the 1918 map, it appeared to go round the eastern end of the bluff known as Thaila Maizila. But this bluff, although shown on the 1918 map as just running oyer the frontier, apparently lay in a totally different position. Its exact position could not be established without a full and detailed survey of all the other features in the neighbourhood on both sides of the present boundary, and such a survey would certainly have to be carried out before any satisfactory decision could be reached as to where the true frontier really lay. In order to approach the problem with any hope of success it was necessary to consider the intentions of King Abdul Aziz and Sir G. Clayton; not with a view to changing the frontier, but with a view to securing a true and correct interpretation of the frontier which they were, in fact, trying to establish when they signed the Hadda Agreement. They were both wide-minded and far-seeing men. who would naturally have dealt with the problem on broad and common- sense lines, and who were not likely to be preoccupied with trivial issues; and, in view of the hopeless inaccuracy of'the map, particularly in this area, it was only by the criterion of the true intentions of the negotiators that proper effect could be given to the agreement which they had reached. Bearing these considerations in mind, Mr. Rendel thought that there could be no doubt that, just as the projecting edges of the Wadi Sirhan were intended to fall within Saudi Arabia (wherever they might actually lie and however different their true position might be from that shown on the 1918 map), so the track round Thaila Maizila (which was the nearest approach in fact to the Carruthers and Shakespeare track shown on the 1918 map) should fall within Transjordan. Mr. Rendel therefore suggested that the only really effective way of settling this difficult problem would be in the first place to arrange for a full and accurate new survey of the whole area by agreement between both parties. This survey would have to extend over Saudi as well as over Transjordan territory if all the features were to be correctly placed in their true relationship to each other. By this means the true facts would be established. Secondly, it would be necessary to agree as to the main intentions of King Abdul Aziz and Sir G. Clayton, with a view to establishing as nearly as possible exactly what frontier they Avere trying to lay down. When this had been done, and the facts had been established and a general criterion agreed upon for the interpretation of doubtful points, it would be necessary to appoint a frontier delimitation commission, whose task should be, taking into account these intentions, to mark on the ground and on a full and accurate map, the nearest possible approach to the line which King Abdul Aziz and Sir G. Clayton had tried to lay down. FUAD BEY asked Mr. Rendel whether he could be furnished with the new data which had led His Majesty’s Government to form their present view as to the inaccuracy of the map. Mr. RENDEL replied that this information was still fragmentary and inconclusive. It had shown quite definitely that the 1918 map was hopelessly wrong. But it had not yet been possible to produce a correct map of the whole area. It was for this purpose that a new survey, extending over both sides of the frontier, would be required. FUAD BEY observed that, if the intentions of King Abdul Aziz and Sir G. Clayton were to be adopted as a criterion, the Saudi Government would certainly have to press their claim to Hazim. Mr. Rendel had spoken of the projecting edges of the Wadi Sirhan, and this was definitely part of the Wadi Sirhan system. Moreover, King Abdul Aziz had claimed the Jebel Rashrashiya at the head of the Wadi Sirhan, and this had formed the subject of detailed discussion at the time of the negotiations. It had been intended that King Abdul Aziz should have this hill, and Hazim naturally went with it. Mr. RENDEL pointed out that it was clear from article 1 of the Hadda Agreement that the phrase regarding the projecting edges of the Wadi Sirhan only applied to the part of the frontier which turned eastwards, south of parallel 31° 25', where the frontier began to slope eastwards. This was the first time that3 he had ever heard of any Saudi claim to the Jebel Rashrashiya, which had never been mentioned in connexion with the Saudi Government’s claim to Hazim, and of which he had found no trace in the records of Sir G. Clayton’s negotiations which resulted in the Hadda Agreement. These records were, however, very full on the question of the allocation of Qaf, which had for a long time formed the main point in dispute, and when it was eventually agreed that Qaf should go to King Abdul Aziz, the area which went with it had been clearly specified as consisting of its date gardens and salt pans. There had been no suggestion that any larger area should be conceded. If, however, Fuad Bey could produce any T ™ ^ k a d been the clear intention of the negotiators that the -hMiel Kashrashiya should go to Saudi Arabia, any such evidence would, of course, be relevant and would have to be very carefully considered. FUAD BE\ HAMZA said that his statement was supported by the testimony of others who had taken part in the negotiations on the Saudi side. Mr. RENDEL said that, apart from the merits of the question, this suggestion provided a good example of the difficulties which had arisen, since, if King Abdul Aziz thought he had secured Hazim and the Jebel Rashrashiva (although the line as drawn on the 1918 map patently left Hazim in Transjordan), ^ir G. Clayton equally thought that he, for his part, had secured the whole of the Jebel Tubeik massif and the route surrounding it for Transjordan. Mi. Rendel added that the map of the northern end of the Transjordan-Nejd fiontier appeared to be much more accurate than at the southern end, since the c ountn in question was much better known and far more frequented. f UAD BE\ HAMZA at this point interjected that King Abdul Aziz in any event claimed the Jebel Tubeik under his dormant claim to Aqaba and the Sanjak of Maan. Mr. RENDEL reminded Fuad Bey that it had been agreed last September that this question should not be raised for the present. He did not, therefore, vJsh to raise it. But unless Sir G. Clayton had wished to secure the Jebel lubeik massif for Transjordan, the southern end of the Transjordan-Nejd frontiei carried as it was so far to the east and south—would have been meaningless. The Jebel Tubeik fell within Transjordan because the Transjordan- • 1 U tontier extended to the east and south of it, and not as forming part of the Aqaba-Maan territory. The Transjordan-Nejd frontier was a valid inter national!} agreed boundary and could hardly be disputed. FUAD BEY HAMZA then asked for a full statement of His Majesty’s Government s view of the problem, and he suggested that, if Transjordan needed any particular concession of territory for practical purposes, the Saudi Govern ment would no doubt be willing to consider granting it, subject, of course, to their obtaining corresponding concessions of equal value in return. Mr REM)EL said that if luad Bey wished, he would let him have a written statement ot His Majesty s Government’s proposals such as, he hoped, would be ot assistance to Fuad Bey in laying these proposals before King Abdul Aziz He considered, however, that questions of give-and-take did not arise at this stage and might never do so, since what His Majesty’s Government were trying to establish was merely the true line of the Hadda Agreement frontier. Mr. Rendel trusted therefore that the Saudi Government would be willing to co-operate with His Majesty s Government in making the necessary survey, in deciding what were the intentions of King Abdul Aziz and Sir G. Clayton, and ultimately in appoint ing a frontier delimitation commission. All this, however, would necessarily take a ong time, and he asked luad Bey whether he did not think that in all the circumstances and in view of the number of other difficult questions outstanding it mignt not be better to carry on for the present with the existing line. The nnt S !n t f ta i 1 V^^ CCepted *? 0 £ nd i a ^ y ’ W fj^ ch had long been observe d in practice, had not, m fact, led to many difficulties There had certainly been frontier difficulties but these were of a different order and were due to raiding or to irregular otortZtTtodff 1 v W 6 !' ° fficials - He WOuld ' fOT lnsta 'A Hke to take the opportunity to draw Fuad Bey s serious attention to the unsatisfactory reports Mich had been received by His Majesty’s Government as to the attitude of the Saudi Amir ot Qaf. He did not wish to pursue the matter in detail at that [456 s 2] m b2moment, though the complaints against the Amir of Qaf had been serious. The point he wished to make was that these difficulties were not, in fact, due to the line followed by the existing boundary, which might, therefore, well be allowed to remain as it stood until other outstanding questions had been disposed of and the whole question could be finally and thoroughly settled. SIR A. RYAN mentioned the three principal places in regard to which there had been, or were, disputes. They were : Haditha, over which His Majesty’s Government had, after careful enquiry, frankly admitted that the Saudi Govern ment’s view was correct; Hazim, over which His Majesty’s Government considered that the Saudi Government were mistaken; and now Thaniyya Taraif, which involved so many factors as to make it, in His Majesty’s Government’s view, necessary to re-examine the frontier as a whole. Apart from these, there were, he believed, no points in dispute in connexion with the alignment of the frontier, and he thought, therefore, that the status quo might well be maintained in the meantime. FUAD BEY HAMZA replied that the Saudi Government might agree in general to this suggestion, but that they could not agree as regards Thaniyya Taraif, which was, he asserted, in Saudi territory. Mr. RENDER explained again the reasons for which His Majesty’s Government were convinced that any such assertion was open to serious question. FUAD BEY HAMZA then proposed that all the existing physical features shown on the 1918 map as lying to the west of the frontier should be regarded as falling within Transjordan, and all those shown as lying to the east of it should be regarded as falling within Saudi Arabia, irrespective of where they might actually be on the ground. A new frontier could thus be established without difficulty. If Thaniyya Taraif were shown on the 1918 map as lying to the west of the Hadda line, the Saudi Government would admit that it was in Transjordan, but if it were shown as lying to the east of the line, they could not allow Transjordan to make use of it without special permission and would be obliged to treat any Transjordan forces frequenting the spot as trespassing on Saudi territory, with all the consequences that this might imply. Mr. RENDER, in reply, made it clear that the interpretation of the Hadda Agreement line and the recognition of the physical features was precisely the difficulty with which both sides were faced. It was, in fact, extremely hard to know where that line lay on the ground. He had already explained the difficulty of identifying the physical features. So long as there was any doubt on this point, it was impossible merely to draw a frontier on the basis of the features shown on the 1918 map. Mr. MARCORM indicated with a sketch the type of difficulty which would seem likely to arise if this criterion were adopted. He drew a diagram showing four imaginary physical features, numbered in order 1 , 2, 3 and 4 . He assumed that an accurate map might well have the effect of altering the position of these features so that the numbers ran, for example, 1 , 3 , 4 and 2. It might be possible, in the first case, to draw a line which would place features 1 and 3 to the west and 2 and 4 to the east of a frontier, but the second case would wholly alter the alignment of the dividing line. A frontier based on the position of each feature as shown on the 1918 map might appear reasonable on the 1918 map, but the same principle might produce a hopelessly tortuous and impracti cable frontier if the relative positions of the features were shifted. FR^AD BEY HAMZA then proposed as an alternative that the frontier should be fixed purely by the points of latitude and longitude given in article 1 of the Hadda Agreement, irrespective of the physical features. He said that the Saudi Government would willingly agree to this method, and he wished to put it forward as a definite proposal. Mr. RENDER pointed out that this would not give effect to the Hadda Agreement. Article 1 of that agreement specifically mentioned the 1 : 1 , 000,000 ££ International map (i.e., the 1918 map) as the relevant map, and for this and other reasons {e.q., the reference to the projecting edges of the Wadi Sirhan) it was clear that the frontier was intended to approximate as closely as possible, in relation to the physical features, to the Hadda Agreement line as plotted on[456 t—1] * THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOYERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). CONEIDENTIAL. [E 4422/341/25] T 1 4 (] 9 'I o o r * July 19, 1935. Section 1. Mr. Rendel to Fuad Bey Hamza. My dear I uad Bey, Foreian Office, July 19, 1935. I WRITE as arranged to summarise the results of our discussion of the 15th July on the question of the Transjordan frontier. 2. You will remember that I began by referring to the Saudi Government s protest of the 3rd February last against the use by Transjordan car patrols of a track passing through a place known as Thaniyya Taraif which the Saudi Government claimed was not in Transjordan territory. Sir Andrew Ryan had informed your Government before he left Jedda that this question was necessitating exhaustive study, owing to defects in the maps, but that we should be prepared to discuss it with you during your present visit. It was in consequence of this communication that I was raising the matter. 3. I then explained to you that our investigations had shown that the existing maps of this area were very seriously inaccurate. The 1:1,000,000 “ International ” map of 1918, which had been used in the negotiation of the Hadda Agreement and in the delineation of the frontier laid down in that agree ment (and which is, indeed, specifically referred to in article 1 ), had now been shown to be quite unreliable, and many of the features in it either lay in entirely different positions in relation to each other or were quite unrecognisable. In some cases, indeed, they did not exist at all. These errors appeared to be most serious at the southern end of the line in the neighbourhood of the place referred to in your Government’s protest of last February. In particular, the bluff marked on the 1918 map as Thaila Maizila had now been shown not to be an isolated eminence lying well to the east of the Jebel Tubeik, but to be an integral part of that massif, and so closely connected with the main portion of the mountain that there was no practicable route between the two. The Transjordan car patrols were thus obliged to go to the east of this bluff in order to travel round the Jebel Tubeik on their ordinary patrolling duties, and the route round the Jebel, shown on the 1918 map as having been followed by Carruthers and Shakespeare and passing between the Tubeik and Thaila Maizila, had now been shown to be non existent and impossible. 4. Without a full and detailed survey of the whole area and an agreed decision as to precisely where the Iladda frontier should run in the light of the new information now available, it is difficult to say that any precise point in the particular neighbourhood now in question is definitely in Saudi Arabia or in Transjordan. The uncertainty in regard to the relative position, and even existence, of the various physical features makes it, in our view, impossible to apply the Hadda frontier to the ground without a great deal of further informa tion, and in advance of any general agreement as to the principles which should be followed in interpreting the Hadda line. On the other hand, it is likely to be a long and complicated business to reach a final settlement of this question, and the boundary at present observed, which has long been tacitly accepted by both sides, has not led to serious practical difficulty. 5. In these circumstances, I suggested two alternative possibilities. The first was that we should agree to let this matter stand over until further progress had been made with regard to the settlement of other outstanding questions, when we might be better able to deal with the present question with the thoroughness which it required. Alternatively, if your Government felt it necessary to try to clear up the whole question without further delay, I suggested that we should review the whole question of the Transjordan-Nejd frontier, as established bv the Hadda Agreement, and that, for this purpose, it would be necessary to take the following steps :— 6 . In the first place it would be necessary to obtain full and detailed information as to the actual geographical facts, i.e., where the various physical2 features really lie, and how far those marked on the Hadda map can be identifie , and this would involve a new and detailed survey of the whole frontier area on both sides of the frontier, for which, of course, we should need the co-operation of the Saudi Government. Hitherto we had been most careful to avoid crossing into what was recognised as Saudi territory and had, therefore, only carried out a fragmentary and limited survey on the Transjordan side of the frontier which was insufficient to establish all the relevant facts. 7 . Secondly, it would be necessary, in our view, to come to some agreement as to the principles which should be followed in interpreting the line laid down by the Hadda Agreement in the light of the new situation revealed by the inaccuracy of the map. For this purpose I suggested that it would be essential to be guided by the known intentions of the negotiators. You will remember that we had some discussion as to these intentions, and that I expressed the view that it was clear that the broad intentions underlying the Hadda settlement were that King Abdul Aziz should retain the whole of the Wadi Sirhan up to and including Qaf, with its date gardens and salt pans, and including its projecting edges, to the south of parallel 31° 25' N.; while it was equally clear that Sir G. Clayton had pressed for and secured a line running as far to the east and south as it did {i.e., to the east of the crossing of the Carruthers and Shakespeare tracks, and well to the south of the Jebel Waila) in order to retain the Jebel Tubeik, and the tracks passing round to the east and south-east of it, within Transjordan territory. 8 . I suggested that when we had thus established the facts, and agreed about the broad intentions of the negotiators of the Hadda Agreement, a frontier delimitation commission should be set up to delimit on the ground the nearest possible approach, in the light of the new information available, to the frontier which King Abdul Aziz and Sir G. Clayton were trying to lay down in the Hadda Agreement. 9. You did not welcome either of these proposals. You explained that if it was a question of taking into account the intentions of the negotiators of the Hadda Agreement, you considered that King Abdul Aziz would have a good claim to the whole of the hill known as Rashrashiya to the north-west of Qaf, and thus to the village of Hazim (about which there has already been a good deal of correspondence between our two Governments), since this was part of the Wadi Sirhan, and the King’s claim to it had formed the subject of special discussion during the Hadda negotiations. On this point I felt obliged to say that I had not seen any record of any such discussion and that, on the contrary,' my recollection was that, when Sir G. Clayton had eventually agreed to the retention of Qaf by King Abdul Aziz, the concession had been specifically limited to the town of Qaf with its surrounding date gardens and salt pans. Moreover, the line drawn on the 1918 map clearly leaves Hazim to Transjordan. You replied to this that the 1918 map equally showed Thaniyya Taraif as in Saudi territory and that, if we were trying to obtain any adjustment of the frontier in its neighbourhood, your Government would be willing to consider any such proposals from us, but would be obliged to claim some equivalent concessions in return. I did not pursue this suggestion because, in our view, what is required is not so much to introduce any modifications into the frontier as to establish as accurately as possible on the ground what that frontier was really intended to be. 10 . You then made two proposals. The first was that the frontier should be delimited on the ground purely in the light of the description by geographical co-ordinates, i.e., by latitude and longitude only, as given in article 1 of the Hadda Agreement. 11 . Alternatively, you suggested that each recognisable feature in the neighbourhood of the frontier should be allotted to Transjordan or to Saudi Arabia, as the case might be, simply according to whether it appeared on the Transjordan or the Saudi side of the frontier as drawn on the 1918 map irrespective of its true position. 12. The comments I made at the time on these two proposals were as follows : As regards the first, I explained that, in our view, the specific mention of the map and the specific reference to the projecting edges of the Wadi Sirhan in article 1 of the Hadda Agreement made it clear that the frontier must be deter mined, not in the light of latitude and longitude, but as far as possible in relation to the physical features as shown on the 1918 map. I added that a frontier plotted solely in the light of geographical co-ordinates would almost certainly be atcomplete variance with what King Abdul Aziz and Sir G. Clayton were trying to lay down, would be entirely artiliciai and unnatural, and would probably prove to operate just as much to the disadvantage of Saudi Arabia as to that of Transjordan. 13. As regards your second suggestion, I explained that we were not trying to escape from the Hadda Agreement, but, on the contrary, to give the fullest possible effect to it. We were quite ready to agree to the physical features being allotted to Transjordan or to Saudi Arabia, according to whether they lay on the Transjordan or the Saudi side of the Hadda line as plotted on the Hadda map. 1 he difficulty was that, particularly at the southern end of the frontier, these features were largely unrecognisable and that they lay in an entirely different relationship to each other from that shown on the map. It was therefore necessary to have some principle of interpretation if an entirely fantastic line were to be avoided. You will remember that, at this point, Mr. Malcolm drew a little diagram for you showing how the “shifting” of the physical features might make a frontier which was intended to be straight into a quite impracticable and unnatural series of loops. 14. I hope shortly to send you our record of the discussion, and so I need not record it further in this letter. But my main object in writing now is to record the definite proposals which were made; that is, the two alternative pro posals which I put forward on behalf of His Majesty’s Government and which I have summarised in paragraphs 5, 6 , 7 and 8 above, and your two alternative proposals as summarised in paragraphs 10 and 11 . I have already summarised in paragraphs 12 and 13 the difficulties which we see in the way of the adoption of either of your proposals, and although I will, of course, submit them to the proper authorities, I fear there is little hope of our being able to agree to either of them. 15. Meanwhile, I understand that you will submit our two alternative pro posals to King Abdul Aziz, and I hope that, if His Majesty feels unable to agree to the provisional maintenance of the boundary at present observed pending a more favourable opportunity for a final settlement of the whole question as suggested in paragraph 5 above, he will be prepared to consider the alternative summarised in paragraphs 6 , 7 and 8 . 16. I should add that it is, of course, understood that our discussion was concerned only with the frontier between Transjordan and Nejd, as laid down in the Hadda Agreement on the 2 nd November, 1925, and that the question of the frontier between Transjordan and the Hejaz. which is dealt with in notes 1 and 2 signed at the time of the Treaty of Jedda. remains entirely unaffected. Yours very sincerely, G. W. RENDEL.-1- Co) Reference No.TC/105/34, TRANS-JORDaN High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan Jerusalem. 27th December, 1935. Sir I have the honour to refer to your predecessor’s Secret despatch of the 31st July, 1935, regarding a meeting at the Foreign Office at v/hich the question of the frontier between Trans-Jordan ana Saudi-Arabia was discussed with the Deputy Saudi-Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs. 2. My attention has been drawn to a proposal made by Fuad Bey Hamza, noted on page 4 of the printed record of the meeting, that all the existing physical features shown on the 1918 map as lying to the west of the frontier should be regarded as falling within Trans-Jordan, and all those shown as lying to the east of it should be regarded as fall ing v/ithin Saudi-Arabia, irrespective of where they might actually be on the ground. Fuad Bey repeated his suggestion later in the meeting. 3. Examination of this proposal in the light of the known positions of the physical features concerned leads me to the conclusion that it would probably constitute a settlement of the question satisfactory both to the Royal Air Force and to the Trans-Jordan authorities. Indeed, it appears that it would in most essentials accord v/ith the intentions of the negotiators of the Hadda Agreement, v/hich His Majesty’s Government contend should form the basis of an agreed delimitation of the Hadda Agreement frontier. It would place the whole of the Jebel Tubaik in Trans-Jordan The Right Honourable J.H. Thomas, M*P., etc., His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies.with the exception of the small spur between Shaib Tarais and Shaib Thanayya which is shown on the 1/1,000,000 map as lying to the east of meridian 38° E; it would establish the Trans-Jordan - Nejd frontier generally along the south western edge of the Wadi Sirhan, thus assuring to Trans- Jordan an area valuable both for the grazing for Beduin flocks and also from the point of view of the defence of Trans-Jordan; it would assure Hazim to Trans-Jordan; and it would fix the southern terminal of the Trans-Jordan - Kejd frontier approximately seven miles further south than its position according to geographical co-ordinates, thereby moving the Trans-Jordan - Hejaz frontier between that point and Mudawwara further to the South. 4. The abandonment to Saudi-Arabia of the spur between Shaib Tarais and Shaib Thanayya would admittedly be a disadvantage, since it would deny to Trans-Jordan the use of that part of the track round Jebel Tubaik which runs along the Shaib Thanayya as far as Maizila and thence turns in a north-westerly direction. With this point in view the Air Officer Commanding caused reconnaissances to be made of the eastern part of the Jebel with a view to finding an alternative car track across the spur. It has been found that such a track could be made which would follow approximately the frontier defined by the physical features marked on the 1/1,000,000 map, and which would be very little inferior to that part of the present track which lies eastward of such a line. It was also established that a track passable for cars could even be made across the Jebel Tubaik from North to South westward of meridian 38° E, that is, within the frontier as defined by co-ordinates.-3- (D k Enclosure I . 5. I enclose herein for your information copies oi a report dated the 20th September, 1935, in which Major ^ J.B. Glubb, Arab Legion, first drew attention to the probable advantage to be derived from accepting Fuad Bey’s Enclosure II . suggestion, and of a letter No. ?TJ/5/4/Air of the 21st November, in which the Air Officer Commanding records tne results of the reconnaissances referred to in the preceding paragraph, and his own conclusions on the matter. The British Resident is in general agreement with these views and considers it most desirable that the lirst opportunity should be taken of accepting the proposal made by Fuad Bey Hamza in the course of the meeting at the Foreign Office. As regards the exchange of territory suggested by the Air Officer Commanding in paragraph 8 (ii) of his letter, Colonel Cox agrees that such an exchange would be convenient, but he suggests that it would be preferable in the first instance to accept Fuad Bey Hamza's proposal without reservation and to postpone any suggestion for its modification until the general principle has been accepted by both parties. The British Resident also observes, with reference to the final paragraph of Major Glubb ’ s memorandum, that any Saudi claim to Jebel Rashrashiya should not be challenged on the ground that there is no such place, ps the range of hills in the region in question is occasionally referred to by that name by local tribesmen. 6. In the light of the foregoing advice I have reached the conclusion that it would be to the advantage of His Majesty’s Government, and of Trans-Jordan, if a settlement of the frontier question could be reached on the basis proposed by Fuad Bey Hamza, and I recommend that the proposal should be pursued at the earliest opportunity.I agree with the British Resident that it would he unwise to prejudice agreement on the general principle hy introducing too early a suggestion for the exchange of a .‘'•art of Jebel '. r aila for the spur between Shaib Tarais and Shaib Thanayya or for territory elsewhere. am sending a copy of this despatch, with its enclosures, to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. I have, e tc., (Sgd.) J. HATHORN HALL. HIGH COM'!! SSI ONER’S DEPUTY FOR TRANS-JORDAN.ENCLOSURE NOol SECRET The British Residents Amman. I heg to inform you that I have studied the minutes of the second part of the fifth meeting rn.th Fuad Bey Hamza at the Foreign Office on 15th July; 1935 ? (No.E/4422/341/25 dated the 18th July 9 1935). I heg to make the following comments 0 The most important statement made in this meeting was the twice repeated offer by Fuad Hamza (pages 4 and 5) to agree that the frontier should be that shown on the 1918 map. Ne have been seeking high and low for several years for some pretext to enable us to claim this frontier^ when lo and behold! Fuad Hamza offers it as a free gift- It is true that certain recent surveys have shown that the physical features on the 1918 map are sometimes erroneously placed with regard to one another; in addition to being all 20 miles or more out of their true geographical position. But such relative errors between physical features near the frontier were slight; except in the relative positions of Hughaira and Banat Bapr souoh of lubaik. If a 1918 map solution were adopted; a kink would eventually appear in the frontier in this area 9 but this really does not seem to present any great obstacle to its adoption. .actually there are very few frontiers in the world which run in a straight 1ine tor 110 miles as tnis one does. A couple ox kinks would not do it any harm. Generally speaking; however; the adoption of the 1918 sheet frontier removes all our difficulties, and is infinitely the most advantageous solution for which we can hope. -5- —vr .XTHE NEJD F RQFTIBR » The discussion held with Fuad Hamza at the Foreign Office presumably affected the Trans-Jordan - Nejd frontier only.* \7e may therefore first consider this frontier alone ? as distinct from the Trans-Jordan - Hejaz frontier. Let us consider the effect of adopting Fuad Hamza’s suggestion that all features west of the frontier in the 1918 map should be in Trans- Jordan and all features east thereof should be in Saudi Arabia. The application of this principle to the Hejd frontier seems to present no objections and no obstacles whatever. The relative errors in the positions of physical features 9 (as explained by Mr. Malcolm at the meeting) seem to apply only to the Hejaz frontier; not to the 7adi oirhan frontier. Thus the adoption of the 1918 sheet solution for the Nejd frontier presents no obstacles; and secures to Trans-Jordan the following enormous advantagess- (1) In general it re-establishes our frontier along the edge of the Y/'adi Sirhan. 7e could scarcely hope to obtain any other solution so favourable by any form of negotiation. (2) It establishes the south-east corner of the frontier south of 7aila; which automatically throws the whole of Tubaik north of the Hejaz section of the frontier; when the latter comes to be discussed. ( 3 ) It establishes a precedent for accepting the 1918 solution; which may be used to press for the adoption of a 1918 sheet solution to the Hejaz frontier. Such a solution on the Hejaz frontier is enormously favourable to us. (4) It gives us an immediate and final solution to the Trans-Jordan - Nejd frontier which would be a great relief. The 1918 sheet solution has one drawback compared to the present de facto arrangement; and that is that it deprives us of Ma’aizila. In practice; however 9 this is not a very serious drawback; because we are almost certain to lose Ma’aizila in-7- But the ground rises gently from Ma’aizila westwards towards the main Tubaik. massif* and the 191'.. Si.ee&lt;, thr the frontier only two miles west of the point of Ma aizila. s* I am fairly certain that* with an expenditure of* say, £1,000, a car track could be made over the spur two miles west of Ma'aizila. By any other solution, however* we risk a much more serious loss in this area. I 'believe j therefore ? that a notable opportunity escaped us when we failed to close with i?uad hamza's offer to adopt the 1918 sheet as our criterion, and I most earnestly recommend that, as soon as a suitable opportunity offers, we express our willingness now to adopt tms solution. TK in KkJAZ ?K0N. , IK R» The adoption of the 1918 sheet solution for the hejaz frontier 5 whenever that comes to he discussed would he e\en more advantageous. ouch a solution would give us the present car track from Mudawwara to J.T.A. and Ma aizila. This track runs from south of Mudawwara to Ruv/aih s Khuhra Mujawwak* Galahat al-Naga and Khuhra Atik. To gam tnis track would he ample compensation for the loss of Ma’aizila. No other possible solution seems likely to procure it ior us. It is true that the application of the 1918 sheet solution to the Hejaz frontier would mean a slight complica tion owing to the error in the relative positions of Banat Baqr and Mughaira. But there^does not appear to he any radical objection to having a couple of kinks in the frontier here; or alternatively we mi^ht give away Banat Baqr (which is much further south than it is shown on this map) in return for a concession elsewhere.9MI &lt;n I therefore most earnestly request that a suitaoxe opening he sought^as early as possiole^ to conclude an agreement with the Saudi Government on the basis of Fuad Hamza’s offer for the Nejd frontier ? namely ? that tne 1918 sheet he the criterion - all points v;est thereof hej.ng in Trans-Jordan and all east thereof in Saudi Arabia. JEBEL RASHRASHIYA* An interesting light is thrown on Fuad Hamza s knowledge of the frontier hy his claim that Jehel Rashrashiya should belong to Saudi Arabia. Now, owing presumably to an error in interpreting the sketch of some early explorer, the word Rashrashiyci hao oeen written along a ridge of hills. In practice, however, Rashrashiya is the name of an extensive hollow full of bushes, south of these hills and between Kaditha and Kaf. It is indisputably and entirely in Saudi Arabia. The cliff overhenging Hazim on the south-west is called Burqa El Hazim, which means the Hazim sand hills (the word ’burqa’ is used for hills of mixed sand and rock and means piebald). This illustrates the fact, often patent to those who know the ground, that Fuad Hamza obtains his information from our million sheet maps, not from the men on the ground - in other words, he often does not know what he is talking about.

Palestine. ^&gt;lst November, 1935* Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter TC/105/34 recommending the adoption of the proposal made by Fuad bey basis of settlement of the Trans-Jordan - Saudi -Arabian frontier as defined by the Hadda Agreement. 2, The essential point in connection with Ma^or Gluoo s recommendation appeared to be the possibility of ootaining a satisfactory car track, alternative to the existing one round the eastern tip of Ma’aizila, inside Trans-Jordan territory should the frontier be drawn on the lines put forward by Fuad Bey. In order to establish this a reconnaissance party proceeded to Tubaik to investigate conditions on the spot. The following is an extract from the report furnished by the officer who carried out the ’’There is no great difficulty in getting cars from North Camp to the south face o± lubaik west of 58 0 E. and there is no insuperable diificulty in maxing a track down the face. Such a track would, however. dated 2Cth September, 1935, which forwarded a letter from the Acting British Resident, Amman, under cover of which was transmitted a memorai andum written by Major Glubb Hamza at the Foreign Office on the 15th July, 1935, as the reconnaissance.

The Chief Secretary, Govsrnment Offices, Jerusalem.-10- mum be appreciably slower going than T.J. track and would run through country well suited to ambushes if a determined enemy was established m tne hills, track can be made running north and south three miles west of the tip of Maizila and joining ^ trac;v at each end 3 and such a track would be practically as good going as the existing ±.J. track 3. The reconnaissance has therefore esbaelish^d the fact that a track can be made west of 3S°h. v/hxCh is actually within Trans-Jordan territory in this vicinity as the frontier is at present defined. In addition a good track is also available between Tubaik and ha’aizila which&gt; at a distance of three miles west of the tip of Ma ? aizila is considered to be practically on tne frontier as it would be drawn under Fuad 3ey ? s proposal. 4. It is considered that this proposal* namely* that the physical features as shown on the one million 1918 map (irrespective of where they may actually be on the ground) lying west of the boundary line should be in Trans-Jordan 9 while those to the east of the line should be regarded as falling to Nejd* approximates very closely to the principle held by the Foreign Ofiice in tneir discussions with the baudi authorities that the irontier should be settled according to 'the intentions of the negotiators'. By applying Fuad Bey’s proposal to the actual conditions on the ground regarding which accurate information is available from the reconnaissance referred to above; from Major Brain’s surveys and Major Glubb’s local knowledge of the terrain* it becomes evident that the result is, in effect 'tne intentions of the negotiators'. Furthermore, the fears expressed byMr. Rendel at the meeting with Fuad Bey that the frontier if settled on this 'basis would he a ’'fantastic' line are shown to he groundless. There would he a small kink between Ma'aizila and waila hut no difficulties would arise in recognising where the boundary lies since here it would he obvious from physical features. By adopting Fuad Bey's suggestion, Trans-Jordan would thus secure practically all its desiderata. Moreover it is likely that these gains would almost certainly he greater than would be obtained were any other methods of settlement to he pursued. 5. The advantages contained in the above proposal are:- (a) The movement of the line C-D to the edge of the Wadi oirhan, which is one of the principal desiderata from the defence point of view; (h) The carrying of the line D-E further east to in clude the Tubaik massif; (c) The movement of point f E' some seven miles further south; and finally (d) The definite inclusion of Hazim to Trans-Jordan. The locality known as Ma'aizila would, however, be within Saudi territory. The importance of this locality lies in the fact that the existing car track round Tubaik and Ma'aizila is on flat country on whicn cars can maintain high speeds, and have a clear view over the plain to the east. 6. Secretariat telegram No. 18, dated 31st March, 1935, stressed the importance to Trans—Jordan of tne car track round Tubaik in connection with tribal administration, and the problem of defence from external raid. There is no doubt that the loss of the track round Tubaik would be inconvenient but the advantages to be gained by adopting© 6/ Fuad Bey’s proposal are so substantial that it is considered that the loss of the portion of the tracic round Ma’aizila spur should not he allov;ed to stand in the v;ay of obtaining so favourable a settlement of tne Trans-Jordan - Nejd boundary question. In this connection reference should be made to Air Council letter S. 30366/Ill/S.6. (paragraph 3) dated ^9th May, 1935, of which a copy was forwarded to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan under cover of Colonial Ofiice letter Secret dated 5th June, 1935. In this letter a similar view is expressed, namely, that the, car track in tnis sector should not be allowed to vitiate the chances of reaching agreement with the Saudi authorities. 7. Turning now to the Trans-Jordan - Hejaz frontier^ While this frontier is defined solely by a unilateral declaration on the part of His Majesty’s Government, it may reasonably be held (as Major Glubb submits) that v/ere Fuad Bey’s principle agreed in the case of the Trans-Jordan - Nejd boundary, its application, on the basis of reciprocity, to the Trans-Jordan - Hejaz frontier would also be admitted. A frontier with the Hejaz settled on similar lines would, as Major Glubb points out, produce important advantages for Trans-Jordan, including all the southern face of Tubaik and a large portion of the car track, which, skirting its southern outcrops, proceeds to Mudawwara. 8 . It is now desired to submit certain proposals which are illustrated in the sketch map 55 accompanying this letter and which show the boundary lines which would result were the various suggestions carried into effect. x Not attached. -IS--15- Adopting Fuad Bey's proposal in principle we can:- (i) Adhere strictly to his method of settlement, which would result in a frontier as marked in red. (ii) Offer the portion of Waila in exchange for Ma'aizila and the tip of the spur Between Shaib Tarrais and Thaniya Tarais. This would give a frontier as marked By the green line. (iii) Offer the portion of Waila as a bargaining counter for some advantage elsewhere. This would result in the frontier indicated By the blue line. Of these alternatives, alternative (ii) , that is the green line, would be the most satisfactory solution. I have ? etc. , (Signed) R.E. C.PiilRSB ? Air Commodore 9 Air Officer Commanding, Palestine and Trans-Jordan.77006/1/36. Colonial Office, Downing Street, S.« r .l* 5th February, 1936. My dear Hall, vie have been studying the High Commissioner s Secret Trans-Jordan despatch of the 37th December regarding the frontier between Trans-Jordan and Saudi Arabia and are rather surprised (but at the same time gratified) at the information that an alternative car track in the Maizila- Thaniya Turaif area has been found• The discovery of these alternative routes alters the position considerably, and if it had been known at the time of the conversations with Fuad Hamza that there was an alternative route, Eendel might have pursued somewhat different tactics. But at that time we were tied by the statement made in the High Commissioner's telegram No: 18 of the 31st March, 1935, that it would be impossible owing to the configuration of the ground to make another suitable track, and that the loss of the existing track, which runs outside the Jebel Tubaik, would render the administration and defence of that area completely ineffective. In these circumstances we feel that it is a little hard that Glubb should speak of a notable opportunity having escaped us •hen - e failed to close with Fuad Hamza’s offer I Glubb no doubt did not intend that remark to apply to anyone in particular, but if indeed a notable opportunity has been l 0 st, I think you will agree that the blame can hardly be attached to the Colonial Office or Foreign Office. There is one point in the correspondence enclosed with the despatch which we should like to clear up witn you. -14--15- Peirse speaks of 'the movement of the line C-D to the edge of the Wadi Sihran'. All I presume that Peirse means 'by the phrasing of paragraph 5 of his letter of the 21st November, 1935, is that, if we accepted Fuad’s proposal, it would have the effect of re-establishing the line as intended by the negotiators of the Kadda Agree ment, as opposed to the principle that the frontier must be finally settled in accordance with the geographical co-ordinates. The phrase 'edge of the Wadi Sirhan' also worries us a little. We have understood that the method of shewing the Wadi Sirhan on the 1910 map was deceptive; i.e. that in point of fact there is no clearly marked descent into the Wadi but only a gradual shelving of tne ground. The edge of the Wadi Sirhan is, therefore, very difficult to interpret and I presume that all that . eir^e means when he speaks of re-establishing the line c.t tne edge of the Wadi Sirhan is that Fuad’s proposal would give us the line C-D as shewn on the 1918 map. This line, o* course, does not come up to the green marking at some points, but we cannot ask for more than the intentions of the negotiators, as shewn on the 1918 map, give us. Will you kindly let me know whether the above is a correct inter pretation of the position as you see it at your end? incidentally, the acceptance of Fuad’s proposal would mean that we should be committed definitely to the frontier running to the Jebel Anaiza in the north-east. Tms presumably does not matter, as it is generally agreed that we shall eventually have to accept this m any case, bui, it means, of course, that we could no longer use the surrender of the piece of territory between the geograph ical co-ordinates and the Jebel Anaiza as a bargaining counter.Pending the receipt of a reply to this letter we are sending the High Commissioner’s despatch to the Foreign Office for them to see and are ashing them for their provisional views„ Yours sincerely 9 (Signed) O.O.R* WILLIAMS. .

WILLIAMS, LSG. i C.M.C-. -19- No.Tc/59/33. ft (^) chief Secretary’s Office* Jerusalem, Palestine. 16th November, 1935. My dear Williams, Please refer to you letter No. 79005/35 of the 16th October shout the car trac? in th-’ neighbourhood the Jebel Aneiza. You are quite right in thinking that the reconnaissance mentioned in my telegram No.52 of the 10th October is in order to find an alternative to the car track on the sections which might fall outside Trans jordan in the event of the frontier being moved. You ask me to indicate on the proof of the new Damascus sheet of the 1/1,600,000 map the precise position of the present track. In fact, it is already indicated on the map (which I return herewith) by the continuous red line which leaves Amman in a south-easterly direction through 3s Sahab and after making a detour to the north of Jebel el Uweinid proceeds in an easterly and north easterly direction to cross the Trans-Jordan - Iraq frontier at ooint 922. The eastern part of this same track forms the de facto frontier to which both parties work in that region. It will immediately occur to you that at its nearest noint the track as shown remains nearly three miles north of the frontier when the latter is redrawn to point 935 of Jebel Aneiza, so that the first point in my letter of the 21st September appears to lose its weight. But there is considerable doubt whether th relative positions of the track and the co-ordinates asmarked on the proof sheet, ore really accurate. Peirse has carefully compared the proof with Holt s survey of 1922, an Air Survey from Amman to Rutba made in December* 1952, and G.S.G.S. map Ho. 3937* and advises us that they show considerable differences and that there can be no certainty* if the frontier is swung even to point 940* that when it is demarcated parts of the track will not be found to cross the frontier. Reference to these various maps has made the Air Officer Commanding even more apprehensive than before that the moving of the frontier might show Hazim in Saudi Arabia. On the other hand, Moffatt, basing himself on a point fixed by Major Brown at 31° 23' 56' H, 37° 00' £4' S, in 1932 established the geographical position of Hazim to be 31° 36' 0' N, 37° 15’ 30' E: if this is so it appears from the enclosed map and the 1918 print of the adjacent SI Bjauf sheet that Hazim, whether in the position shown on that sheet or in its correct geographical position, would lie to the North of the frontier if drawn to point 940 on the new Damascus sheet. But it seems impossible with the data at present available, to be certain on the point, and while we realise, as I said in my letter of the 21st September that the Foreign Office intend to assure the retention of Hazim in Trans-Jordan, I -ntirely agree with Peirse that we ought not to take any unnecessary risk of losing Hazim, or even of enabling the Saudis to suspect a possible weakness in our claims to the place in advance of the general frontier negotiations. The Air Officer Commanding informs me that no mention was made, in the statement of the Trans-Jordan desiderata, of the present car track because it was considered that with the opening of the new road alongside Tvan Petroleum Company's pipeline, the Royal Air Forcetrack became strategical-ly of secondary importance.* 5 The reconnaissance for an alternative mentioned in my telegram No.52 has now been made and it appears that a new alignment could be found to replace the sections which are near the Trans-Jordan Saudi frontier* but the construction of a new track v/oulb present considerable difficulty and expense and the new track would probably be inferior to the ures^nt one. But the possibility of making an alternative track is relatively unimportant, compared with th dancer of weakening our claim to Hazim, and the other objections to a re-drawing of the frontier at the present time mentioned in my letter of the 21st September. Yours ever, (Signed) J. HATHORN HALL.-22- 71 fftl (&amp;) Extract from a Secret Semi-official letter from Mr. Heap, War Office, to Mr. Blaxter, dated the 11th February, 1936. x x 35 3. Hall's third paragraph is puzzling as regards the discrepancies between Holt’s survey, G. S. G« S. and the Damascus sheet in the positioning of the track from Amman to the Iraq. Trans-Jordan frontier. On tne G. S. G. So 3937 series this track was plotted from air photographs, and controlled by fixes made by Major Brown. The track appears only on sheets 13 and 14, and will appear on sheets 15 and 16 when and if they are published. For the Damascus l/M sheet this track was taken direct off the published sheets 13 and 14 of G. S. G.S. 3937 and the compilations of sheets 15 and 16, and so should (and as far as we can see does) agree exactly with G. S. G. S. 3937. The eastern end of this track as shown on the Damascus sheet was taken from Holt's survey of 1922, controlled by the position of the track as shown on G. S.G. S. 3937 and by the Iraq Survey Department’s fix of Jebel Aneiza and its vicinity. The necessary adjust ment to make Holt's work fit the control was negligible. In brief, we cannot detect the 'considerable differences' which are referred to in the third paragraph of Hall's letter as far as Holt, G.S.G.S. 3937 and the l/M Damascus sheet are concerned. We cannot, however discover what he means by the 'air survey from Aimnan to Rutba'. G.S. G.S. 3937 was as stated above compiled from air photographs which did not, however, extend as far as Rutba, so that it would appear that the air survey to which Hall refers is yet another map. If so, we should very much like a copy with a brief description as to how72' ( it was compiled with special reference to the control used. Apart frow anything which this air survey wap may disclose, we feel that there is little doubt that the geographical position of the track on the new Damascus sheet is reasonably reliable. 4. The same cannot be said for Hazim. On the 1918 edition of the Djauf l/M sheet, Hazim was fixed from Huber's work fitted on to Philby (the latter did not visit Hazim). Brown apparently did not visit Bazim, but went very near, and when we were compiling our 1 / 500,000 sheet Amman he adivsed us that the position of Hazim was shown too far to the west on the Djauf sheet. me 1 / 500,000 sheet Atman G. S.G. S. 3932 published in 1933 (on which by the way the Trans-Jordan ITejd frontier is drawn towards o .935 on the Jehel Aneisa) shows Hazim at latitude 31 35 n 45' north, longitude 37 13’ 42' east, hut this is admittedly approximate. If we moved Hazirn further east in accordance with Moffatt's figures, then even though the adoption of his figures moves it also a little north Hazim falls so close to the frontier (though on the Amman sheet still on the Trans-Jordan side) as to make it by no means certain that it would fall on the Trans-Jordan side if the line of the frontier as at present defined were to be demarcated on the ground. Prom Hall's letter it would appear that fcoffatt's figure for Hazim are considered reliable. Is it is important to get this point in its correct position in future maps we should be very grateful if you would cause enquiries to be made with a view/ to confirming whether these figures can in fact be taken as thoroughly reliable. If there is any doubt about them, may I suggest that the Palestine Survey Department might be asked to make an astronomical fix at Hazim. _ 23 _•/ 5. This brings hie to the next point. In the fourth paragraph of Hall’s letter he refers to the Djauf sheet of the l/M series which was compiled in 1918, when our geographical knowledge of Arabia was even less than it is to-day. I can only advise that no great reliance should be placed on the geographical position of any place as shown on the 1918 edition of the Djauf sheet. Since that date we have collected a lot of new information, ana j e actually started the compilation of a revised edition of the Djauf sheet about three months ago. I am hoping that this sheet will be published before the end of this year, assuming that we can get to first proof stage by about August. As Hazim has now become such an important place it is essential that it should be fixed on this new sheet as accurately as possible. I shall be gratefuo., therexore, if you can let me have the information asked for in paragraph 4 above as soon as possible, as any appreciable displacement in the position of Hazim will of course affect the surrounding detail. Failing such reliable information, we can only put Hazim as shown on the 1/500,000 Amman sheet. 6. In the last sentence of his letter Hall uses the expression ’’re-drawing” the frontier. Trans-Jordan throughout this discussion have taken the view that to place the junction point at Jebel Aneiza would be ”re—drawing” the frontier. It seems to us - and I believe to the Foreign Office - that it is in fact Trans-Jordan who want to ’’re draw” the frontier by moving the junction point from the Jebel Aneiza, which is defined as the western end of the Iraq Fejd frontier by the Treaty of kuhammerah of 1922, which however goes on to say that the Jebel Aneiza is situated in the neighbourhood of the inter-section of o ^ latitude 32 north with longitude 33 east. Trans-Jordan want to move this junction point from the Jebel Aneiza to -24-3 -25- 0 o the actual junction point 32 north 39 east, and base their claim on the Hadda agreement of 1925 whose wording is contradictory to the Treaty of huharn.'ierah but which does not cancel that Treaty, That, however, is a matter for you and the Foreign Office to fight out with the Governments concerned, but we come into the picture in that we shall of course want to know what is decided, and also there is one piece of geographical information which I have recently received, and which seems worthy of con sideration, I mentioned it verbally to kalcolm one day when he was here. On the Damascus sheet two summits are shown on the Jebel Aneiza points 935 and 940. The Air Officer Commanding in Iraq some time ago recommended that the Treaty of huhammerah should be interpreted as meaning ,.935 on the grounds that it is this summit which is usually accepted by the Bedouins as 'Jebel Aneiza'. Malcolm thought that the opinion of the Bedouins was not sufficiently conclusive to induce us to choose this point, and he thought that . 940 should be chosen on the grounds that it ie higher than »935 and also that it is rather o nearer to the inter-section of latitude 32 north with longitude 39° east. On the Damascus l/M sheet 'F. 0. U. 0. ” edition the frontier has been drawn to ,940, On the Amman sheet 1/500,000 on the other hand, as explained in paragraph 4 above, the frontier is drawn towards .935. Since , alcolrn expressed his preference for .940 I have seen Major Papworth who has recently returned home from survey work in Iraq, and he tells me that . 935 is a prominent summit whereas .940 although 5 metres higher is on the top of a flat ridge, and is not really prominent to the naked eye. This seems rather a strong point in favour of the assumption that the framers of the Treaty interred to refer to .935, and I think it is a point that wouldimpress any Boundary Commissioner unless he had Been specifically told to go to the highest point (which for all we know may still not he . 940). 7. The decision as to the exact junction point of these three frontiers is affecting us rather seriously. Not only does it affect the Damascus sheet hut also the Djauf iheet of the l/M series? and the Rutha sheet of the 1/500,000 series, both of which are now being compiled, the .Amman sheet of the 1/500,000 series is affected, as also is the 1/4,000,000 Persian Gulf sheet which is hadi^ in need of revision and which I am hoping to start this year.' / ♦ c / A C0MMITT33 CP IMIC'RIAL D2PSKC3 STANDING OP F ICIAL SuB-CGIC^ITTPP FOR QUEST IQR3 CONCDRNIITG THE MIDDLE LAST c The attached sketch map is circulated with reference to Paper No. MAD«(0)201.

July 18, 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2 . '[E 4422/341/25] Record of Second Part of Fifth Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza at the Foreign Office on July 15, 1935. THE first part of this meeting was devoted to a brief discussion of the question of the dues paid on goods imported through Bahrein into Saudi Arabia, and is recorded separately. The following were present:— Mr. Ren del. Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi- Sir A. Ryan. Arabian Minister for Foreign Mr. Ward. Affairs). Mr. Malcolm. Transjordan-Nejd Frontier. Mr. RENDER recalled the protest which the Saudi Government had made, in their note of the 3rd February, 1935, to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, against the use by Transjordan car patrols of the track at a point named Thaniyya Taraif, and he reminded Fuad Bey that before leaving Jedda Sir A. Ryan had informed the Saudi Government that this question was necessitating exhaustive study owing to defects in the maps, but that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to discuss it with his Excellency Fuad Bey in London. In fulfilment of this promise, Mr. Rendel now wished to explain the situation which had arisen. Local investigations, which were still proceeding, had shown that many places on the Nejd-Transjordan frontier were not by any means in the positions in which they were shown on the 1918 “ International ” Asia 1 : 1,000,000 map, referred to in article 1 of the Hadda Agreement. In fact, that map had now been shown to be very seriously inaccurate. It had been compiled on reports supplied by travellers, but those reports were now being found to have contained progressive errors, which had caused a correspondingly progressive series of inaccuracies in the map. The final result was that many of the features on the 1918 map either were in a totally different position from that shown on the map, or lay in an entirely different relationship towards each other from that shown, or, in some cases, did not exist at all. As a typical example, Mr. Rendel cited the route shown on the map as followed by Carruthers in 1909. This route was shown as passing diagonally from north-west to south-east through an apparent gap between the Jebel Tubeik and a small hill to the east of it called Thaila Maizila, and in this gap it was shown as crossing Captain Shakespeare’s route of 1914, so that on the map there was a continuous route round the Jebel Tubeik within Transjordan territory. But it now turned out that there was no such gap, and that the Thaila Maizila was merely a rocky spur of the Jebel Tubeik itself, and an integral part of the Tubeik massif. Mr. Rendel, turning to the map, explained the indications it gave of the main intentions of the negotiators of the Hadda Agreement. It was clear that King Abdul Aziz, on the one hand, had sought to keep the whole of the Wadi Sirhan for Saudi Arabia, and that Sir Gilbert Clayton, on the other hand, had sought to keep for Transjordan the whole of the Jebel Tubeik. This was the only explanation of the general line of the frontier, particularly at its southern end. The natural inference was that Sir G. Clayton, relying on‘the fact that the map showed Carruthers’ and Shakespeare’s routes as passing round the eastern end of the Jebel Tubeik, had drawn the southern end of the Transjordan-Nejd frontier, where it is shown on the 1918 map, with the object of leaving the route round the eastern end of the Jebel Tubeik entirely within Transjordan. Now. as Mr. Rendel had said, Carruthers’ route had proved an impossibility, since the Jebel Tubeik massif and the eminence called Thaila Maizila were all part of the [456 s—2] b■PH 2 same mountain and there was no practicable gap between them. On the other hand, the British authorities in Transjordan, believing that the Hadda Agree ment 5 entitled them to a track round the eastern end of the Jebel Tubeik within Transjordan territory, had naturally made use of the existing track nearest to the mountain. In so far as this track could be plotted at all on the 1918 map, it appeared to go round the eastern end of the bluff known as Thaila Maizila. But this bluff, although shown on the 1918 map as just running over the frontiers apparently lay in a totally different position. Its exact position could not be established without a full and detailed survey of all the other features in the neighbourhood on both sides of the present boundary, and such a survey would certainly have to be carried out before any satisfactory decision could be reached as to where the true frontier really lay. In order to approach the problem with any hope of success it was necessary to consider the intentions of King Abdul Aziz and Sir G. Clayton; not with a view to changing the frontier, but with a view to securing a true and correct interpretation of the frontier which they were, in fact, trying to establish when they signed the Hadda Agreement. They were both wide-minded and far-seeing men, who would naturally have dealt with the problem on broad and common- sense lines, and who were not likely to be preoccupied with trivial issues; and, in view of the hopeless inaccuracy of the map, particularly in this area, it was only by the criterion of the true intentions of the negotiators that proper effect could be given to the agreement which they had reached. Bearing these considerations in mind, Mr. Rendel thought that there could be no doubt that, just as the projecting edges of the Wadi Sirhan were intended to fall within Saudi Arabia (wherever they might actually lie and however different their true position might be from that shown on the 1918 map), so the track round Thaila Maizila (which was the nearest approach in fact to the Carruthers and Shakespeare track shown on the 1918 map) should fall within Transjordan. Mr. Rendel therefore suggested that the only really effective way of settling this difficult problem would be in the first place to arrange for a full and accurate new survey of the whole area by agreement between both parties. This survey would have to extend over Saudi as well as over Transjordan territory if all the features were to be correctly placed in their true relationship to each other. By this means the true facts would be established. Secondly, it would be necessary to agree as to the main intentions of King Abdul Aziz and Sir G. Clayton, with a view to establishing as nearly as possible exactly what frontier they were trying to lay down. When this had been done, and the facts had been established and a general criterion agreed upon for the interpretation of doubtful points, it would be necessary to appoint a frontier delimitation commission, whose task should be, taking into account these intentions, to mark on the ground and on a full and accurate map, the nearest possible approach to the line which King Abdul Aziz and Sir G. Clayton had tried to lay down. FUAD BEY asked Mr. Rendel whether he could be furnished with the new data which had led His Majesty’s Government to form their present view as to the inaccuracy of the map. Mr. RENDEL replied that this information was still fragmentary and inconclusive. It had shown quite definitely that the 1918 map was hopelessly wrong. But it had not yet been possible to produce a correct map of the whole area. It was for this purpose that a new survey, extending over both sides of the frontier, would be required. FUAD BEY observed that, if the intentions of King Abdul Aziz and Sir G. Clayton were to be adopted as a criterion, the Saudi Government would certainly have to press their claim to Hazim. Mr. Rendel had spoken of the projecting edges of the Wadi Sirhan, and this was definitely part of the Wadi Sirhan system. Moreover, King Abdul Aziz had claimed the Jebel Rashrashiya at the head of the Wadi Sirhan, and this had formed the subject of detailed discussion at the time of the negotiations. It had been intended that King Abdul Aziz should have this hill, and Hazim naturally went with it. Mr. RENDEL pointed out that it was clear from article 1 of the Hadda Agreement that the phrase regarding the projecting edges of the Wadi Sirhan only applied to the part of the frontier which turned eastwards, south of parallel 31 c 25', where the frontier began to slope eastwards. This was the first time thathe had ever heard of any Saudi claim to the Jebel Rashrashiya, which had never been mentioned in connexion with the Saudi Government’s claim to Hazim, and of which he had found no trace in the records of Sir G. Clayton’s negotiations which resulted in the Hadda Agreement. These records were, however, very full on the question of the allocation of Qaf, which had for a long time formed the main point in dispute, and when it was eventually agreed that Qaf should go to King Abdul Aziz, the area which went with it had been clearly specified as consisting of its date gardens and salt pans. There had been no suggestion that any larger area should be conceded. If, however, Fuad Bey could produce any evidence to show that it had been the clear intention of the negotiators that the Jebel Rashrashiya should go to Saudi Arabia, any such evidence would, of course, be relevant and would have to be very carefully considered. FUAD BEY HAMZA said that his statement was supported by the testimony of others who had taken part in the negotiations on the Saudi side. Mr. RENDER said that, apart from the merits of the question, this suggestion provided a good example of the difficulties which had arisen, since, if King Abdul Aziz thought he had secured Hazim and the Jebel Rashrashiya (although the line as drawn on the 1918 map patently left Hazim in Transjordan), Sir G. Clayton equally thought that he, for his part, had secured the whole of the Jebel Tubeik massif and the route surrounding it for Transjordan. Mr. Rendel added that the map of the northern end of the Transjordan-Nejd frontier appeared to be much more accurate than at the southern end, since the country in question was much better known and far more frequented. FUAD BEY HAMZA at this point interjected that King Abdul Aziz in any event claimed the Jebel Tubeik under his dormant claim to Aqaba and the Sanjak of Maan. Mr. RENDEL reminded Fuad Bey that it had been agreed last September that this question should not be raised for the present. He did not, therefore, wish to raise it. But unless Sir G. Clayton had wished to secure the Jebel Tubeik massif for Transjordan, the southern end of the Transjordan-Nejd frontier—carried as it was so far to the east and south—would have been meaningless. The Jebel Tubeik fell within Transjordan because the Transjordan- Nejd frontier extended to the east and south of it, and not as forming part of the Aqaba-Maan territory. The Transjordan-Nejd frontier was a valid inter nationally agreed boundary and could hardly be disputed. FUAD BEY HAMZA then asked for a full statement of His Majesty’s Government's view of the problem, and he suggested that, if Transjordan needed any particular concession of territory for practical purposes, the Saudi Govern ment would no doubt be willing to consider granting it, subject, of course, to their obtaining corresponding concessions of equal value in return. Mr. RENDEL said that, if Fuad Bey wished, he would let him have a written statement of His Majesty’s Government’s proposals such as, he hoped, would be of assistance to Fuad Bey in laying these proposals before King Abdul Aziz. He considered, however, that questions of give-and-take did not arise at this stage and might never do so, since what His Majesty’s Government were trying to establish was merely the true line of the Hadda Agreement frontier. Mr. Rendel trusted therefore that the Saudi Government would be willing to co-operate with His Majesty’s Government in making the necessary survey, in deciding what were the intentions of King Abdul Aziz and Sir G. Clayton, and ultimately in appoint ing a frontier delimitation commission. All this, however, would necessarily take a long time, and he asked Fuad Bey whether he did not think that, in all the circumstances, and in view of the number of other difficult questions outstanding, it might not be better to carry on for the present with the existing line. The present tacitly accepted boundary, which had long been observed in practice, had not, in fact, led to many difficulties. There had certainlv been frontier difficulties but these were of a different order and were due to raiding or to irregular behaviour on the part of frontier officials. He would, for instance, like to take the 0 PP 0 i'tunity to draw Fuad Bey’s serious attention to the unsatisfactory reports which had been received by His Majesty’s Government as to the attitude of the Saudi Amir of Qaf. He did not wish to pursue the matter in detail at that4 ES-HSEsrassfi remain as it stood until other outstanding questions had been disposed of an whole question could be finally and thoroughly settled. ^ SIR A. RYAN mentioned the three principal places m regard tlvit the Saudi Government were mistaken; and now Ihamyya Taiaif, w Involved so manv factors as to make it. in His Majesty’s Government s view necessary to re examine the frontier as a whole. Apart from these there were he believed no points in dispute in connexion with the alignment of the frontie1 ’ he thought, therefore, that the status quo might well be maintained the meantime. FTTAD BEY HAMZA replied that the Saudi Government might agree m general to this suggestion, but that they could not agree as regards Thamyya Taraif. which was, he asserted, in baudi territory. Mr RENDER explained again the reasons for which His Majesty s Government were convinced that any such assertion was open to serious question. EL T AD BEY HAMZA then proposed that all the existing phvsical featuies shown on the 1918 map as lying to the west of the frontier should be regarded as falling within Transjordan, and all those shown as lying to the east of it should be regarded as falling within Saudi Arabia, irrespective of where they might aetuallv be on the ground. A new frontier could thus be established vithm difficulty. If Thaniyya Taraif were shown on the 1918 map as lying to ^ of the Hadda line.* the Saudi Government would admit that it was Transjordan but if it were shown as lying to the east of the line, they cou allow Transjordan to make use of it without special permission and would be obliged to treat any Transjordan forces frequenting the spot as trespassing on Saudi territory, with all the consequences that this might imply. Mr RENDER, in reply, made it clear that the interpretation of the Hadda Agreement line and the recognition of the physical features was precisely the difficultv with which both sides were faced. It was, m fact extremely hai know wWe that line lay on the ground. He had already explained the diffi^ty of identifying the physical features. So long as there was any doubt on t ^ point, it was impossime merely to draw a frontier on the basis of the featu.es shown on the 1918 map. Mr MALCOLM indicated with a sketch the type of difficulty which wou c seem likely to arise if this criterion were adopted. He drew a diagr|n showmg fniir imaeunarv nhvsical features, numbered in order 1, 2, 3 and 4. He assumeu ha an a g ccuiSe P map might well have the effect of altering the position of these features so that the numbers ran, for example, 1, 3 4 and 2. Jt nossible in the first case, to draw a line which would place featuies a Fe west and 2 and 4 to the east of a frontier, but the second case would wholly MterMhe Alignment ofthe dividing line. A frontier based on the position of each feature as shown on the 1918 map might appear reasonable on the 1918 map, but the same principle might produce a hopelessly tortu ons a nd impm cable frontier if the relative positions of the features were shifted. FUAD BEY HAMZA then proposed as an alternative that the Hontiei should be fixed purely by the points of latitude and longitude given ir utlL g^ ofthe Hadda Agreement, irrespective of the physical features. He said that the Saudi Government would willingly agree to this method, anc e put it forward as a definite proposal. r* , , Mr RENDEL pointed out that this would not give effect to the Hack a Agreement Article 1 of that agreement specifically mentioned the 1 .1.000,000 “international ” map (i,.. the 1918 map) as the relevant map f^rthmaml other reasons (e.a., the reference to the projecting edges of the Wad ^ was clear that the frontier was intended to appioximate a • jJj tte( j on in relation to the physical features, to the Hadda Agreemo si the 1918 map. If the latitude and longitude alone were now followed, an entirely different and wholly artificial frontier would be produced, which might operate just as much to the disadvantage of Saudi Arabia as to that of Transjordan, and which would be completely at variance with the intentions of the Hadda negotiators. It would also deprive Saudi Arabia of Hazim and of the Jebel Rashrashiya, but this would be the case whichever of Fuad Bey’s methods were ^adopted. FUAD BEY HAMZA said that His Majesty’s Government appeared to him to rely on the 1918 map when it suited them and to discard it when it did not. He considered that there must be one criterion for application to the whole line— i.e., either the allocation of the physical features as shown on the 1918 map, or the latitude and longitude. He did not care which of these was adopted, but he could not accept the suggestion that the intentions of the negotiators should be taken into account, unless the Saudi Government were free to press their claim to Hazim and the Jebel Rashrashiya on that ground. Mr. RENDER demurred to Fuad Bey’s criticisms. He repeated that His Majesty’s Government were in no way questioning the validity of the Hadda Agreement, but that what they were seeking to do was to secure the adoption as exactly as possible of the line which King Abdul Aziz and Sir G. Clayton intended to lay down by it. So many of the natural features on the 1918 map were, however, either unidentifiable or of doubtful existence, or in completely transposed positions, that a new and detailed survey of the whole area was essential as a first step. His Majesty’s Government were, however, prepared to adopt one of two alternatives—either to carry on with the hitherto accepted existing boundary until a suitable moment should arrive to go thoroughly into the whole question and settle it finally, or to reach an agreement with the Saudi Government on the necessary steps for arriving at such a settlement without further delay; In the latter case agreement would have to be reached (a) on the true facts— e.g., by an early, complete and accurate survey of the whole area; (V) as to the main intentions of the negotiators; and (r) for the appointment of a delimitation commission. The object of the commission would, as he had explained, be to establish on the ground the frontier which King Abdul Aziz and Sir G. Clayton would have drawn had they had a correct and complete map. It was subsequently agreed that Mr. Rendel should write a letter to Fuad Bey summarising the discussion and recording the various proposals which had been made in the course of it, and that Fuad Bey should submit to King Abdul Aziz the two proposals which Mr. Rendel had put forward on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, and seek His Majesty's instructions thereon.

(Papers Nos. M.E.(O) 171, 172, 173 and 174.) Copies of telegrams from the High Commissioner for Transjordan to the Colonial Office. (Papers Nos. M.E.(O) 175 and 176.) Copies of telegrams between the Foreign Office and Sir Andrew Ryan (His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda). (Papers Nos. M.E.(O) 177 and 179.) THE CHAIRMAN said that the views expressed in Sir Andrew Ryan’s telegram dated 6 th March placed a different aspect on the problem. Although the High Commissioner for Transjordan was averse to opening up negotiations, Sir Andrew Ryan was quite definite that a general discussion on the Transjordan-Nejd frontiers could not now be avoided. We should now have to decide whether or not it was necessary to take up the general question of the re-definition of the Trans jordan-Nejd boundaries, from Points A to E, with the Saudi Government. Before making this decision he would like to be assured that in the view of the Foreign Office and their legal advisers we should have a sound case to argue on the basis of the intentions of the negotiators of the Hadda Agreement, the 1918 map having been proved to be inaccurate. MR. RENDEL pointed out that the Foreign Office felt satisfied that we could base a strong case on the intentions of the negotiators of the Hadda Agreement regarding the frontier laid down in the 1918 map. He would like, however, to put in a caveat, which might be important from the Air Ministry point of view, about the Transjordan car track. Although there appeared to be a strong case to include the whole2 SL “ft ® of the Je'cel Tiifcaik massif in Transjordan, it might he difficult to ensure that any recognisable physical feature which was in fact marked well to the east of the frontier on the 1918 map should he accepted as falling; witein Trans jordan even if it formed an integral part of that massif. This meant that the eminence known as Thalia Maizila, which was shown to the east of the frontier line in the 1918 map, ana tne position of which on the new correct map, was approximately unchanged in relation to the other fea„u, hut which was of great importance since the Transjordan car track made a loop round the eastern edge of it, might he difficult to secure for Transjordan. On the other hand if the question were taken on its broadest lines on the basis of the intentions of the negotiators and taking into con sideration the alignment of the ue facto frontier, there seemed a good hope of securing this loop of the car tracm. VfiNG COiftiAKiER PIRXS, although agreeing that we should base our case on the principle of the intentions of the negotiators, referred to the views of the High Commissioner for Transjordan that a re-definition of the boundaries, whilst endangering our position relative to the Transjordan car track, might result in Transjordan losing Hazim if porno A v;ere moved to the summit of Jebel Anaiza e In reply to the Chairman, MR. RENDER said that possicmy the War Office, in hestiating to accept the argument ahouu the intentions of the negotiators, had in mind the principle on which His Majesty’s Government were accustomed to act, that the intentions of the negotiators should net normally be taken into account when interpreting the terms of an international instrument. That principle certainly held good as regards instruments whose terms were clearly intel ligible. In the present case, however, the document contained contradictions (e.g. , the reference to the - 2 --3- terminal point of the Iraq-Nejd frontier) ana, being based on a wholly inaccurate map, could only be interpretea in the light of further data of some kind. In these circum stances the Legal Advisers to the Foreign Office considerea that it would be proper, and indeed necessary, to interpret the document in the light of the negotiators’ intentions. MR. WILLIAMS referred to the fact that we had not yet replied to the Saudi Government’s note about Hasim, referred to in Sir Andrew Ryan’s telegram dated 6 th March. The reason was that it had been thought advisable to await the result of this general discussion on the Transjordan boundary, but there vas no doubt that the intention of the negotiators of the Hadda agreement had been to include Hazim in Transjordan. In reply to the Chairman, WING COMMANDER PIRIE said that it v T as quite possible that a re-definition of the boundary points A to B incurred the risk of Hazim cemg shown on the wrong side. MR a RENDEL explained that the position of Hazim in relation to the frontier might conceivably he affected by an redrawing of the line between points A and B, as a result of the altered position of the Jebel Anaiza which had now been found to be some 20 miles to the north-east of the geographical point A. But this variation would only take the line a very little way northwards at its western end, and it seemed most improbable, therefore, that the revised line could go so far north as to affect Hazim, unless the position of Hazim itself was wrong. Moreover, as Hazim was a definite and recognisable physical feature and the 1918 line had been clearly drawn to the south of it, it seemed clear that it was the intention of the negotiators that it should be-4- includtd in Transjordan. It aopnar^d in fact to be one of the several key points 'which had determined the drawing of the line. If this couid be established there should be no doubt about its remaining in Transjordan in any circumstances. He was hopeful 9 howeverthat the question of the position of the Jebel Anaiza might not have to be raised. The portions of the line which had led to controversy were those bordering the Wadi Sirhan and the Jebel Tubaik, It might perhaps not be necessary to re-define the north eastern end of the line, more especially as this could hardly be done without raising the question of the Saudi- Iraq frontier on the terminal point of which the line to B depended. It was unlikely that either the Iraqi or Saudi Government would wish to raise the question of the Saudi- Iraq frontier at present. Referring to the Jebel Anaiza MR. WILLIAMS said that the Hadda Agreement described the point at which the fron tier between Transjordan and Nejd should start in the north-east, as the point of intersection of meridian 59 ° and parallel 3S° north. MR. RL1TDLL pointed out that these co-ordinates were only quoted as defining the terminal point of the Iraq-Nejd frontier and that it was that terminal point rather than the co-ordinates which constituted the key point, since the Transjordan-Rejd frontier could not begin, so to speak, in the air. WING COMMANDER PIRIE said it was certainly essential for military reasons to ensure that Transjordan retained Hazim and suggested that a good point for arguing our case was the cession of Kaf to Ibn Saud during the Hadda negotia tions. We had been most loth to give up Kaf, and it was only ceded as a last resort in order to reach an agreement.~’ven &amp;o^ it agreed ciibt Ibn Saud should have no more than Xaf with its date gardens a. d salt pans. There therefore seemed a good reason for conceding no further ground to the liorth or North-West of Kaf. MR. RINDEL said that this was a useful point. Kazim was to the North of the boundary near Kaf 9 and if it had been intended that the Saudi G-overnment should have Hazim* this would certainly have been mode Co.ear at the time. THE CHAIRMAN said it was clear that we could base our arguments on the intention that the Saudi Government should be given the wadi Sirhan and that we should have the who^e of the: Jebel lubaih. It would be necessary to know whether the Jebel Tubaik massif included Maizila. MR. WILLIAMS asked whether we could argue that the de facto line expressed the negotiators’ intentions. He gathered that Sir Andrew Ryan was rather afraid of this point. MR. RILDExj said that 9 if a Frontier Delimitation Commission were to be set up, it would be necessary for it to have very full terms of reference, providing that it should taxe into account both the intentions of the negotia tors (in the broadest sense), and also the existing ue laCbO boundary, which had been adopted with a view to giving eiiect to those intentions. On these principles, and in view of the hopeless inaccuracy of the 1918 map, it might oe possible to secure the inclusion of the whole of the car track on the Tran s jordan-Nejd section of the frontier, including its eastern loop in Transjordan. WING COMMANDER PIRIL pointed out that the car track had been aligned as close as possible to the Jeoel inbaik massif, on the assumption that the negotiators of the Hadda-6- agreement intended at least, the whole of the massif to full within Transjordan. It was not possible to align the track any closer to the .nassix^ and it tnerefore - reasonable to suppose on the above assumption teat W- boundary could not be delimited on the irano joraan ^Id of the car track. Till. CHAIRMAN asked whether ; if we lost the eastern loo j of the Transjordan car track, the result would be that at the eastern end of the Jeoel Tubaik there wouxd an area which we could not protect? WlhG COAi.IALIDIiR PIRIh and G CL ORAL ADAM agreed that we should be unable to concentrate our forces, and we should not be able to stop any penetration through the gap. The former added that another point to be bo^ne in mind was that this solution would piobably necessitate an increase in the establishment of the Transjordan 'land forces 1 '. TiE, RLADLL thought that the closest possible reproduction on the new and accurate map of the i91o frontier line would make the sector of that line running between points D and L run along meridian 08 • 10 e.s shown in red on the new map, since meridian 38°. iG' appeared generally to correspond, in relation to tne physical features with meridian 88 ° on tne 1918 map. This would give us everything we wanted between poinus L and L, except for the small loop of the car track round Maizila. If this loop could not be otherwise secured he thought it might be possible to get an agree ment that the frontier commission should have certain powers of 'give and taKe', so as to enable it to vary the line a few miles either way in tne light oi existing local conditions. For instance, we might give theSaudi Government the Jebel Waila in return for the car track* and it might alao be possible to agree to vary the line for* say* three miles on either side. TH T CHAIRMAN asked Mr. Rendel what was the usual procedure for these Commissions. Was agreement on points of dispute reached before the Commission started its work? MR. RhNDSI thought that the main objects to be aimed at should be as follows :- (1) To get away as far as possible from the 1918 map* on the ground that it was hopelessly in accurate in every respect. (2) To reach an agreement on the broad intentions of the negotiators as to the Wadi Sirhan system* Kaf* the Jebel Tubaik massif* and certain other specific points. (3) To get an agreement that the de facto boundary* which had been adopted with a view to giving effect to the intentions of the negotiators* should be ta^en^ into account* as well as the intentions of the negotiators on the broad issues. (4) That the Commission should have discretion to vary the line to a depth of two or three miles on either side* provided any such variations balanced each^ other and did not unduly favour either side. WING COMMAND R PIRID* stated that the Air Ministry would be insistent on two points. In the first place they could not contemplate losing the use of the Transjordan car track and secondly* i.rom the point of view of the security of Transjordan it was essential that the boundary line from points n to D snould be-8- $ as near to the Wadi Sirhan as possible so that 0 m aircraft reconnoitring at 1500 - 2000 feet could ^*1 see into the wadi and so be able to locate raiders taking shelter in the kadi. MR. RhUDhL said that the Hadda Agreement gave us a strong case for the latter since it was clear that the line was meant to run along the ciiif edge of tne Vadi Sirhan 9 as otherwise there would have been no object in specifically providing for the '“projecting edges 1 ' of the Wadi. But unless point E. were brought much further south it seemed inevitable chat we should lose the southern bend of the car track on the Transjordan-Hedjaz de facto frontier. In reply to the Chairman he stated that it had been agreed that it would not be possible to deal with the Hedjaz frontier at present. VIITG CCMMAhDBR FIRIE 9 in reply to a question by Mr. Williams^ pointed out that the lunding ground (JTA(LG)) 9 shown on the War Office sketch map of the frontier area Aqaba to V/edi Sirhan 9 was actually on the car track. TUL CHAIRMAN stated that the arguments for and against re-opening the boundary question had all been considered previously., but bir Andrew Ryan's latest telegram had altered the situation considerably. In their letter dated 26th January^ 1935 (circulated as Paper No. M.B. (0) 19l) the Colonial Office had given the opinion that theI (g) (Ol frontier question sloul^ 'be tnken up with the Saudi Government now, subject to the views of the High Commissioner for Trans jordan. Personally, he was in agreement with Sir Andrew Ryan, and if in suite of the latt r’s telegram the High Commissioner for Transjordan still toolc the view in his last telegram, it would, of course, be necessary to refer to the Secretary of State. MR. REifOEL said that his original instructions were to agree that for the present matters should be allowed to remain as they were, and not to press for an immediate re-definition of the boundariesr these instructions had, however, been given before Sir Andrew Ryan’s latest telegram had been received. He agreed with Sir Andrew’s arguments about our nosition over the Thanniyya Taraif. He considered that we were now in an uncomfortable position, and that we might be much worse off if we left the initiative to Ibn Saud than if we took advantage of the oresent situation to try to reach a friendly se ctlement by agreement which might lead to our obtaining much better terms than if we were driven into the position oi attemoting to defend an illegal position against a strong Saudi attach. THE CHAIRMAN asked whether there was any way in which we could deal with the orotest about Thanniyya Taraif without taking up the general question of boundaries. It, in faco, this were possible, it would suit the Colonial Office, out he could not himself see that it could be done. WING COMMANDER PIRIE said he thought this was hardly a question for the Air Ministry to decide, but should it be decided to re-open negotiations, the Air Ministry felt strongly that the two points he had mentioned should be secured. n-. s- were - (i) the inclusion of the car track wichin Transjordan, and (ii) the alignment of the frontier between points C and D along the western edge of the Wadi Sirhan. -Q-THE CHAIRri/U! said that if vie corae to the conclusion, as Sir Andrew hyan had suggested, that the initiative v/as passing to Ion Sand, and. that we should open negotiations, he considered that the position would have to he put again to the High Cormissioner for Trans;jor&amp;an who must he given an owoortunity to express a further opinion before any action '' :r e s t a f e n. MR. RENDEL stated that he thought that the foreign Office would probably wish to sumport Sir A. Ryan's latest views. He was inclined to regard the risks of a continuance of the present situation as greater than those which we should run if we decided, to initiate negotiations, though the argu ments were fairly evenly balanced. It was, of course, quite impossible to guarantee that we should be able to retain the whole of the car track, but if we took no action we might be faced with the possibility of losing a great deal more. In his view there was a better prospect of getting a satisfactory settlement by agreement if we took the initiative. In reply to the Chairman he said that although the Saudi Government could not appeal to the League of Nations they could, make a strong case and place us in an invidious position. They might quite easily propose arbitration, which it would be very difficult for us to refuse. WING COMMANDER PIRIE asked if Sir A. Ryan had been made acquainted with the views of the Air Ministry in regard to the military factors involved. On Mr, Rendel replying that he had, Wing Commander Pirie asked if he had exmressed any opinion as to whether he could secure the agreement of the Saudi authorities to the requirements of the Air Ministry. MR. RENDEL replied that Sir A. Ryan’s views had dealt with the question as a whole. He knew our requirements; but the question was which course of action was likely uo involve leas urisk. Sir A. Ryan inclined to the view that we might lose more in the end by waiting than by taking the initiative nov. Mr. Rendel thought it might be very difficult for us co got any territory which the 1918 map shewed, as part of Nejd.. it was clear, moreover, that the Saudi Government were better acquainted, with the geography of the frontier region that we had supposed, MR. LAITH7AITE said he agreed generally with the views expressed by Mr. Rend.el. The Ind.ia Office were interested in the matter as it affected questions of our general negotiacions with Saudi Arabia, such as the ’’.flue Line”, Kuwait blockane, etc. He stressed the importance of the ’’Blue Line”, and was of opinion that whatever concessions we made to Ton Saud should be in return for concessions in this connection, rather than for concessions on the Transjordan frontier. If we gave any concessions for the latter we might be giving away some thing which could be used to better effect elsewhere. THE CHAIRMAN said that he thought that the questions of the ’’Blue Line” and the Trans jordan-Nejd frontier must now be dealt with separately. MR. RENDEL suggested that the arguments put forward at to-day’s meeting should be developed and communicated to the High Commissioner for Transjordan and His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. He repeated that the Foreign Office would probably be inclined to support Sir A. Ryan’s views. In reply to the Chairman, MR. BRIDGES said that no questions of finance were involved, he had noced that the Air Ministry had been using the Transjordan car track for the last three years, and the only thing that seemed to have precipitated the Saudi protests was the boundary marks which rrgre said to have been put up. He wondered, therefore, whether it might not still be possible to settle these wrotests without▼ ^ © 10b re~o-nening the whole nuestion.

CHAIRMAN said that the views expressed in u^r ^ndr^.. Ryan's telegram dated 6th March placed a different aspect on the problem. Although the High Commissioner for Transjordan was averse to opening up negotiations, Sir Andrew Ryan was quite definite that a general discussion on the Transjordan-Hejd frontiers could not now be avoided, should now have to decide whether or not it was necessary to take up the general question of the re-definition of the Transjordan-Hejd boundaries, from points A to u, with Saudi Government. Before making this decision he would like to be assured that in the view of the Foreign Office and their legal advisers we should have a sound case to argue on the basis of the intentions of the negotiators of the Hadda Agreement, the 1918 map having been proved to be inaccurate. MR. REHDEL pointed out that the Foreign Office felt satisfied that we could base a strong case on the intentions of the negotiators of the Hadda Agreement regarding the frontier laid down in the 1918 map. He would like, however, to put in a caveat, which might be important from the Air Ministry point of view, about the Transjordan car track. Although there appeared to be a strong case to include the whole. v,, « of the Jebel Tu'baik massif in Transjordan, it might he difficult to ensure that ar^ recognisable physical feature which v j as in fact marked well to the east of the frontier on the 1918 map should he accepted as falling within Trans jordan even if it formed an integral part of that massif,. This meant that the eminence known as Thaila Maizila, which was shown to the east of the frontier line in the 1918 map, ana the position of which on the new correct map, was approximately unchanged in relation to the other features hut which was of great importance since the Transjordan car track made a loop round the eastern edge of it, might he difficult to secure for Transjordan* On the other hand if the question were taken on its broadest lines on the basis of the intentions of the negotiators and taking into con sideration the alignment of the oe f acto frontier, there seemed a good hope of securing this loop of the car track* vnm GOLCviANkER PIRIE, although agreeing that we should base our case on the principle of the intentions of the negotiators, referred to the views of the High Commissioner for Transjordan that a re-definition of the boundaries, whilst endangering our position relative to the Transjordan car track, might result in Transjordan losing Hazim if point A were moved to the summit of Jebel Anaiza. In reply to the Chairman, MR. RENDER said that possibly the War Office, in hestiating to accept the argument about the intentions of the negotiators, had in mind the principle on which His Majesty’s Government were accustomed to act, that the intentions of the negotiators should net normally be taken into account when interpreting the terms of an international instrument. That principle certainly held good as regards instruments whose terms were clearly intel ligible. In the present case, however, the document contained contradictions (e*g. , the reference to tne -2--3- terminal point of the Iraq-Nejd frontier) ana, 'being based on a wholly inaccurate map, coula only be interpretea in the light of further data of some kind. In these circum stances the Legal Advisers to the Foreign Office considered that it would be proper, and indeed necessary, to interpret the document in the light of the negotiators’ intentions. MR. WILLIAMS referred to the fact that we had not yet replied to the Saudi Government’s note about Hazim, referred to in Sir Andrew Ryan’s telegram dated 6th March. The reason was that it had been thought advisable to await the result of this general discussion on the Transjordan boundary, but there was no doubt that the intention of the negotiators of the Hadda agreement had been to include Hazim in Transjordan. In reply to the Chairman, WING COMTvIANLER PIRIE said that it was quite possible that a re-definition of the boundary points A to B incurred the risk of Hazim being shown on the wrong side. MRo RENDER explained that the position of Hazim in relation to the frontier might conceivably be affected by an redrawing of the line between points A and B, as a result of the altered position of the Jebel Anaiza which had now been found to be some 20 miles to the north-east of the geographical point A. But this variation would only take the line a very little way northwards at its western end, and it seemed most improbable, therefore, that the revised line could go so far north as to affect Hazim, unless the position of Hazim itself was wrong. Moreover, as Hazim was a definite and recognisable physical feature and the 1918 line had been clearly drawn to the south of it, it seemed clear that it was the intention of the negotiators that it should beincluded in Transjordan. It appeared in iact to be ono of the several key points which had determined the drawing of the line. If this could be established there should be no doubt about its remaining in Transjordan in any circumstances. He was hopeful 9 however 9 that the question of the position of the Jebel Anaiza might not have to be raised. The portions of the line v/hich had led jO controversy were those bordering the kadi Sirhan and the Jebel iubaik. It might perhaps not be necessary to re-define the north eastern end of the line, more especially as this could hardly be done without raising the question ot the Saudi- Iraq frontier on the terminal point of which the line A to B depended. It was unlikely that either the Iraqi or baudi Government would wish to raise the question of the Saudi- Iraq frontier at present. Referring to the Jebel Anaiza MR. WILLIAMS said that the Hadda Agreement described the point at which the fron tier between Transjordan and Hejd should start in the north-east, as the point of intersection of meridian 39° and parallel 32° north. MR. RLHD3L pointed out that these co-ordinates were only quoted as defining the terminal point of the Iraq-Nejd frontier and that it was that terminal point rather than the co-ordinates which constituted the key point, since the Transjordan-Rejd frontier could not begin, so to speak, in the air. ¥TNG COMMAHDBR PIRIE said it was certainly essential for military reasons to ensure that Transjordan retained Hazim and suggested that a good point for arguing our case was the cession of Kaf to Ibn Baud during tne Hadda negotia tions. We had been most loth to give up Kaf, and it «as only ceded as a last resort in order to reach an agreement.■&lt;S- t\V 1 n ven qo 9 it waB agreed chat Ibn Baud should have no more than Xaf with its date gardens a.id salt pans. There therefore seemed a good reason for conceding no further ground to the horth or North-Vest of Xaf. L'lR. RLNDhL said that this was a useful point. Hazim was to the North of the boundary near Kaf 9 and if it had been intended that the Saudi Government should have Hazim 9 this would certainly have been mode c.Lear at the time. THh CHAIRMAN said it was clear that we could base cur arguments on the intention that the Saudi Government should be given the 1adi Sirhan and that we should have the whore of the Jebel fubaik:. It would be necessary to know whether the Jebel Tubaik massif included Maizila. MR. WILLIAMS asked whether we could argue that the de facto line expressed the negotiators’ intentions. He gathered that Sir Andrew Ryan was rather afraid of this point. MR. RLNDEju said that 9 if a Frontier Delimitation Commission were to be set up 9 it would be necessary for it to have very full terms of reference 9 providing that it should take into account both the intentions of the negotia tors (in the broadest sense) 9 and also the existing de 3.acto boundary 9 which had been adopted with a view to giving effect to those intentions. On these principles 9 and in view of the homeless inaccuracy of the 1918 map 9 ic might oe possible to secure the inclusion of the whole of the car track on the Transjordan-Nejd section of the frontier* including its eastern loop in Transjordan. WING COMMANDER PIRIL pointed out that the car track had been aligned as close as possible to the Jebel Tubaik massif* on the assumption that the negotiators of the Hadda -5-♦ US © agreement intended at least the W hole of the massif to fall within Transjordan. It was not possible to align the track any closer to the massif, and it therefore seemed reasonable to suppose on the above assumption tnat boundary could not be delimited on the Transjordan side of the car track. fill. CHAIRMAN asked whether ; it' we lost tne eastern loo ^ of the Transjordan car track 9 the result would be that at the eastern end of the Jeoel Tubaik there would be an area which we could not protect? WlnG- CCWiWJI&amp;a PIRIB and CCLOiliL ADAM agreed that we should be unable to concentrate our forces, and we should not be able to stop any penetration through the gao. The former added that another point to be borne in mind was that this solution would pxobably necessitate an increase in the establishment of the Transjordan 'land forces’'. MR. pf-PDll thought that the closest possible reproduction on the new and accurate map of the 1916 frontier line would make the sector of tnat line running between points D and L run along meridian 38°. 10* as shown in red on the new map, since meridian 38°. 10’ appeared generally to correspond, in relation to the Physical features with meridian 38° on the 1918 map. This would give us everything we wanted between points D and E, except for the small loop of the car track round Manila. If this loop could not be otherwise secured he thought it might be possible to get an agree ment that the frontier commission should have certain powers of '•give and taice', so as to enable it to vary tne line a few miles either way in the light of existing local conditions. For instance, we might give the - 6 -** 0 Ilf' Saudi Government the Jebel Waila in return for the car trach ? and it might also be possible to agree to vary the line for, say, three miles on either side. TH T CHAIRMAN asked Mr. Rendel what was the usual procedure for these Commissions. Was agreement on points of dispute reached before the Commission started its work? MR. RhNDSL thought that the main objects to be aimed at should be as follows (1) To get away as far as possible from the 1918 map 9 on the ground that it was hopelessly in accurate in every respect. (2) To reach an agreement on the broad intentions of the negotiators as to the Wadi Sirhan system, Zaf 9 the Jebel Tubaik massif, and certain other specitic points. (3) To get an agreement that the de facto ^ boundary, which had been adopted with a view to giving effect to the intentions of the negotiators, should betaken^ into account, as well as the intentions of the negotiators on the broad issues. (4) That the Commission should have discretion to vary the line to a depth of two or thrue miles on either side, provided any such variations balanced each other and did not unduly favour either side. WING COMMAND R PIRIS stated that the Air Ministry would be insistent on two points. In the first place they could not contemplate losing the use of the Transjordan car track and secondly, from the point of view of the security of Transjordan it was essential that the boundary line from points C to D snould be - 7 --8- as near to the Vadi Sirhan as possible so that aircraft reconnoitring at 1500 - 2000 feet could see into the Wadi and so be able to locate raiders taking shelter in the Wadi. MR. REIIDLL said that the Hadda Agreement gave us a strong case for the latter since it was clear that the line was meant to run along the cliff edge of the Vadi Sirhan 9 as otherwise there would have been no object in specifically providing for the 'projecting edges' of the Wadi. But unless point E. were brought much further south it seemed inevitable chat we should lose the southern bend of the car track on the Trans jordan-Hedjaz de i'acto frontier. In reply to the Chairman he stated that it had been agreed thai it would not be possible to deal with the Kedjaz frontier at present. WHIG CCMMAEDER PIRIE 9 in reply to a question by Mr. Williams., pointed out that the landing ground (JTA(LG)) 9 shown on the War Office sketch map of the frontier area Aqaba to Wadi Sirhan 9 was actually on the car track. THE CHAIRMAN stated that the arguments for and against re-opening the boundary question had all been considered previously, but bir Andrew Ryan’s latest telegram had altered the situation considerably.

CONCLUSION (I ) THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed:- that the Foreign Office and Colonial Office should he invited to draft a telegram to the High Commissioner for Transjordan and His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda - which should he shewn to the War Office and Air Ministry before despatch - putting forward all aspects of the question as viewed in the light of the latest telegrams and dis cussing the question whether it will he possible to dispose of the Saud.i protests concerning Thanniyya Trraif without raising the question of the inaccuracy of the map referred to in the Hadda Agreement (inter national Asia map 1:1,000,000 of 1918) and the re-definition of the Transjordan-Nejd frontier generally, or losing the use of the Transjordan car track, and asking for their views as to the best course of action.II. THE ISLAND OF TAHB. THE SUB -COIvGvlI TTEE had under consideration - Copy of a letter with enclosures from Mr. J.G. Laithwaite, India Office, to the Secretary of the Sub-Committee (paper No. M.E.(O) 178). THE CHAIRMAN asked Mr. Laithwaite to give the India Office view on the situation at Tamh resulting from the action of the Sheikh of R&amp;s-al-TUiaimah and described in the telegrams circulated with Paper No. M.E.(O) 178. MR. LAITHWAITE said that the Foreign Office had thought it desirable that the question cf Tamb should be discussed in the Middle East Sub*-Committee because of its possible reaction on the Persian negotiations, in which it had in the past from time to time figured prominently. After giving a short geographical description of the island and referring to its history and status, he said that the causes leading up to the present situation were clearly set out in the telegrams circulated with I&amp;per M.E.(0 ) 178. The title to the island rested in the two Jowasimi Sheikhs of Ras-al-nhaimah and Sharjah, but since 1921 Ras-al-Khaiinah had been definitely the senior partner. No forces were maintained on the island, but there was a lighthouse (the right to erect which had been granted to His Majesty’s Government by Sharjah in 1912). Under instructions issued locally the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah was required to keep his flag flying on the island and to maintain a man as a guard. At the end of December the Senior Naval Officer had reported that the flag had been removed and the guard withdrawn. The reasons for the Sheikh's action were still not clear, but the explanations given suggested that they were: (a) that he wished to blackmail us into paying some rent for the lighthouse;-14- (t&gt;) that he was in negotiation either with the Central Persian Government or (more probably) with local Persian officials on the South Persian Coast. The Sheikh’s action had not been well taken in his Sheikhdom or locally and the Sheikh of Sharjah, immediately on hearing of the withdrawal of the flag, had asked permission to hoist his own flag and had beer dissuaded from doing so only by the Residency Agent. It was now necessary to take a decision as to the course of action to be followed. The alternatives appeared to be: (a) to request the Sheikh to replace his flag and offer to pay him a rent in respect of the lighthouse; (bJ to refuse to be blackmailed and to require him to replace his flag within a given number of days, failing which His Majesty's Government would take sach action as they thought fit; (c) to allow the bheikh of Sharjah to hoist his flag on the understanding that he would keep it hoisted an! maintain a guard; unofficially (d) A suggestion which had been/put forward by the Foreign Office - that His Majesty’s Government should annex the island, either permanently or temporarily, the argument being used that the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah under his treaties ( had no power to cede it except to His Majesty’s Government,and that if he evacuated it they were entitled to step in. Sir Samuel Hoare’s view was that the first alternative could be ruled out; that there were strong objections (which the Political Resident shared) to the fourth alternative; and that the right course was a combination of the second and third, the Sheikh being required to replace his flag within a given number of days, failing which the Sheikh of Sharjah would be allowed to hoist his flag. It was relevant that theIflag flown by Sharjah ana Ras-al-Khaimah was the sane. MR. LAITHWAITS said that as regards the informal Foreign Office suggestion^ the India Office fully apP 1 * 6- ' dated the importance of the point made by the minister at' Tehran as to the undesirability of any apparent change of ownership while negotiations with Persia were still under consideration. On the other hand, the objections to the suggestion which had been put forward were very strong. It would not put us in any way in a better position vis-a-vis Persia; it would cause trouble with the Trucial Sheikhs, who would accuse us of land-grabbing; and finally it would affect our relations with the Sheikh of Sharjah, who had a legitimate claim to the island and who had been restrained from asserting that claim only by our local agent, and who had of course given us considerable assistance inoealing v/ith the air route. It seemed clearly desirable to take an immediate decision; the island had now been left without a flag for two or three months, and this situation could not be permitted to continue during the progress of negotiations. THE CHAIRMAN said that as the possibility of annexation had been suggested by the Foreign Office, he would like to have Mr. Rendel’s views.-16- MR. RI-^DxjIj in reply suid thdt he hod not yet been able to submit this question to his higher authorities* and ne therefore had no instructions on the subject. He had however suygosted that it should be discussed by the Sub-Committee as it seemed desirable to explore the ground at once* particularly in view of txio possibility oi the problem assuming considerable importance in the near future. He felt that the problem should be looked at in its widest aspect. The difficulties of our present position in the Gulf were mainly due to our having failed to t a he a decisive line when it was open to us to do so. Had we regularised our position by definitely annexing certain key positions in the Gulf when we couj.d have had tii^m for the a axing early in the 19th century* or even in 1557 * half our present troubles would never hove occurred. The first point for consideration in the present ease seemed to him to be to decide whether the island of' Tamb was of any possible value or importance to us strategically or otherwise. If it was likely to be of value* we now seemed to have an exceptionally favourable opportunity of establish ing our position there on a regular basis. COMMITDLR .PICKSOH seid that from the Admiralty point of view Tamb Wos on i.y important on account of the lighthouse* which* oi course* was necessary for navigation purposes generally* and not solely for Admiralty requirements. The island could not ce used for any other purposes. There was no harbour and it was not a possible base. The Admiralty would like go see the uestion settled and to rid tnemselves of an extra commitment caused by the 3.H.O. having to keep a sloop in the vicinity of Tambo-17- WING- COMMANDER PIRIE stated that this island had no direct interest for the Air Ministry. MR. SEAL said that the Admiralty could not contemplate this island being handed over to Persia. It did not matter to them which Sheikh controlled the island^ but he could not see any adequate reason for annexation * nor did he see how annexation could improve our position in the Persian Gulf. we did not want any more incidents like that at BasidUy where the British flag had been left unguarded and had been insulted by the Persians. Proceedingy MR. RENDER said that he had put the question about the importance of the island so that we might if possible avoid missing yet another opportunity of establishing ourselves in a sound and legally defensible position in a place which we might subsequently find was essential to us. If Tarnb were of really important strategic valuey now was our chance to take it over. The Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah had violated his treaty with us by virtually withdrawing from the island and leaving it to be taken over by the first comer. Whether he had intrigued with the Persians or not 9 there was little doubt that if we had not kept a sloop there the Persians could have acquired it. The Sheikh had undertaken not to alienate any part of his territory except to his Majesty’s Government. his Majesty’s Government therefore seemed in a very strong position to take over the island if they wanted to. On the other handy if the island reedly were of no value or in terest to us y the fact that the sheikh had virtually dis interested himself in it seemed to give us an opportunity of utilising it for some political purpose. Before now attempts to reach a general settlement with Persia had broken down mainly on the question of this island. If it were really of no value &lt;, and v/e did not want to keep it 5-18- \l£ and the Sheikh of Kas-al-Ehaimah was indifferent to it, was it really worth allowing our relations with Persia to be vitiated by our obligation to protect an island no value which no one really wanted? Might it not better policy for us to take over the island now ourselv &gt; so that we should at least be free to use it if it should prove desirable as part of a bargain with Persia under which Persia would, for instan.ce, abandon her claims to Bahrein, etc. , recognise the Arab rulers oi the e-alt and special relations with them, and generally undertaite n to be obstructive to us in the Gulf? Would it not be a mistake to renew our embarrassing commitment to protect it for an Arab ruler who cared little about it and to whom we owed so little? It was for these reasons that he had put forward, as a purely personal suggestion, the idea that we might take advantage of the Sheikh Ox Rao-ul Khaimah's apparent indifference to the island to take over the island, either to keep, if it were of value, or to use as a counter in negotiation, if it should prove /alueless. He did not suggest that we should necessarily formally annex the island. His idea was rather that we should take it over for the time being and decide subsequently v/hat to do with it. As regards handing it ower to oharjah, he emphasised that the Sheikh of Sharjah had never been mentioned in any of the correspondence with the PersicOis during the last five or six years as having any claim or title to the island. On the contrary, we had insisted very strongly on the fact that the island was a possession of the aheixh of Ras-al-Khaimah. He feared that our position vis^^yis the Persians might be somewhat embarrassing if we now suddenly took the line that the island was the property of someone else. Biis would not of course have been the case if we had told the Persians from the first that the island was not the personal property of the Sheikh of-19- vfc&gt; Ras-al-Khaimah hut a sort of trust possession of the Jov/asimi tribe 5 but v;e had never done this. He still felt * therefore v, that there might be a good deal to oe said for our taking it over ourselves* though he did not want to press this suggestion unduly* particularly as it was* as he had explained* only a purely personal one. Thk CHAIRMAN referred to the telegram from His Majesty s Minister at Tehran dated 8th February* 1935* in v/hicL the Minister stated that our control would be strengthened oy adopting the suggestion of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* which was that the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah should be ordered to replace the flag within a stated period and if he failed to comply* then the Sheikh of oharjah should be authorised to take this action. He thought that the Sheikh of oharjah had a very good claim* and he did not see that it should be difficult to explain the 'G° s i'ti on the Persian Government* to whom there had been no occasion to mention the Sheikh of Sharjah’s reversionary rights while the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah was in occupation of the island. MR. LAITHWAITE pointed out* firstly* that the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah could hardly be regarded as having violated any treaty engagement by this action* while * in so iar as the Jowasimi sheikhs were concerned* Sharjah had applied to be allowed to hoist his flag immediately on the Ras-al-Khaimah flag being hauled down* and had been prevented from doin^ so only by His Majesty’s Government’s local representative. Secondly* that if we permitted the Sheikh of Sharjah to hoist the flag instead of Sheikh Ras-al-Khaimah, no change of ownership of the island would be involved* as both Sheikhs belonged to the Jowasimi tribe and each had an interest in the island and each flew the same flag. In view of the fact that Sharjah had a good title to the island (though he had in practice now for many years been so much the junior partner that that title had not oeen of anyimportance until the present juncture) there seemed everything to he said for letting him take over. In reply to a question* he said that our general principle in this area v/as not to interfere in the internal affairs of the Sheikhs more than v/e could help and not to endeavour to holster up Sheikhs v/ho were not strong enough to stand on their own. So far as their external relations were concerned^ our principal concern was to ensure that they had no dealings v/ith any foreign powers and that they did not sell or cede any territory save to His Majesty’s Government. COLONEL ADAM said he was in entire agreement with the India Office views. CONC L USION (l l). THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed - (a) To recommend that His Majesty’s u-ovemment should not agree to payment of rent to the Sheikh of Has-al-Khaimah for the lighthouse on the island of famh or to any other financial inducement to him to re-hoist his flag,; (h) That there were objections to the temporary or permanent occupation of Tamb by His Majesty’s Government in view of the claims of the Sheikh of Sharjah; (c) That in the circumstances they recommend that the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah should be re quired to re-hoist his flag and replace^the guard v/ithin a period of ten days* failing which His Majesty’s Government should authorise the Sheikh of Sharjah to hoist his flag* on the understanding that he will keep it hoisted and maintain a guard. The Resident in the Persian Gulf to be left discretion as to whether the ultimatum to Ras-al-Khaimah should contain - (i) a warning that failing compliance the Sheikh of Sharjah will be allowed to hoist his flag; or (ii) a statement that His Majesty's govern ment will take such action as they think fit; If the Resident chooses alternative (ii) he should let it be known locally simultaneously with the issue of the ultimatum that the, intentions of His Majesty's Government are as laid down in alternative (i).

Two courses were suggested at the meeting 9 one of which was to allow matters to remain as they are. The frontier at present being observed has proved reasonably satisfactory and 9 except for a few minor incidentS 9 for example in the neighbourhood of Hazim, has not elicited any serious protest from Ion caud. 3* Attached. - 1 --2- If His Majesty’s Government now embark on negotiations with Ibn Saud and attempt to iemarcate tne frontier between Trans-Jordan and Nejd ? they might find themselves in the position either of having to break off negotiations (with the result that the question would be reft undetermined and serious friction might well arise until some final settlement was reached) or of permitting the southern terminal of this frontier to be fixed so far to the north that the interests of Trans-Jordan on the Hedjaz section of their frontier might be seriously prejudiced. The other course suggested at the meeting was that His Majesty’s Government ^ould take the initiative at once in raising the matter with Ibn Gaud. The whole question of the frontiers between Trans-Jordan and Saudi Arabia cannot be left unsettled indefinitely, and it is unlikely that a more favourable opportunity than the present will present itself. It is now known that the map used by the negotiators of the Hadda Agreement is entirely in accurate, and His Majesty’s Government would, therefore, be on strong ground in proposing a re-definition of the frontier in the light of the o'cvicus intentions of the negotiators of that Agreement._ Moreover, His Majesty’s Government might find themselves in a somewhat invidious position if at some future date Ibn Saud were himself to take the initiative, since they might then be forced to admit that they had known for some time that the map was inaccurate, but had taker, no action in the matter. After consideration of the views expressed at the meeting. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister has reached the conclusion that the balance cf advantage lies in taking up the question of the frontier with Ibn Saud now, and subject to the views of the ether interested Departments of His Majesty’s Government he suggests that His Majesty’s-3- i2 + \r Minister at Jecida should be furnished with suitaoie instructions in this sense. Before however such iiiSt.*. ucti ons are sent to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda dir Philip Cunliffe-Lister considers it very desirable that the High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan should be given an opportunity of commenting upon the action proposed and upon the terms of the instructions.

Air Ministry, MR # WILLIAMS said that he wished to thank the War Office for their readiness to release Major Prain at short notice to go to Trans-Jordan a second time* and he expressed the aporeciation of the Colonial Office of the speedy and effective manner in wnich Major Prain had completed the additional work. He suggested that in the first place the meeting might discuss the effect on the various problems connected with the frontier of the new information supplied by the War Office as a result of Major Prain’s recent visit to Trans-Jordan. 2. BRIGADIER MACLEOD explained that it had been hoped that it would prove possible to draw the frontier on the new map in the same relative position to the physical features as it appearad on the 1918 map. Uniortunaoely the information now available established the lacu that the relative positions of certain physical features were inaccurately shown on that map. For instance it was nowMiknown that Shibliyat is about 2 miles S.S.Y/. of the Jebel Waila instead of about 12 miles S.S.E. as shown on the 1918 map. The result is that while it migho be held bhat the frontier should run through the Jebel Walla, ion Saud might equally contend that it should be west of Snibliyat. The suggestion was made that the eminence described as Djala on the new map might be the same as that described as Shibliyat on the 1918 map ? so uhat the physical features would really be unchanged and the only mistake be one of nomenclature. But MAJOR PRAIA explained that this could not be the case as the term Shibliyat was a descriptive one which could not apply to the eminence marked Bjala, and that it was therefore definitely a case of the physical features having been wrongly marked on the old map. In reply to further questions, MAJOR ?RAIN said that Maizila, the Jebel Waila and la'ala were all spurs of the Tubaik massif. 5. MR. RENDER said that in his opinion the information now available would make it difficult, n not dangerous for us to base our arguments on the smaller physical features shown on the 1918 map. It was now known for certain that this map was hopelessly inaccurate aiid it aeemed clear that we should only be able to deal with the question on its hroadest lines and on the basis ot the obvious intentions of the negotiators of the Hadda Agreement. It was sufficiently clear that in defining the frontier which is laid down in the Hadda Agreement, Sir Gilbert Clayton and Ibn Baud had two main considera- The first was the Wadi Sirhan. Ibn Saud tions in view.al was anxious to get the frontier in this section pushed as far north and west as possible, so as to leave the whole of the Wadi in Nejd. On the other hand, Sir Gilbert Clayton aimed at a line drawn as far south and east as possible in order to widen the frctns-Jordan corridor, and in particular to retain as wide a margin as possible round the Jeoel Tubaik massif in the south. His Majesty’s Government eventually conceded the whole of the Wadi Sirhan (with the exception of the extreme northern end) to Ibn Baud, but it was clear that Sir Gilbert Clayton had nevertheless triad to draw the frontier as far to the east and south as possible, since otherwise there would have been no point in making the specific exception in the Hadda Agreement regarding the projecting edges of the Wadi Sirhan. 'ihe fact that these were specifically left to Saudi Arabia in derogation of the general frontier line showed that the line must have been meant to run to the east of those projecting edges. In return for this important concession to Ibn Saud of what was his main desideratum - i.e. the Wadi Sirhan system - Sir Gilbert Clayton had obviously concentrated on securing for Trans-Jordan the whole of the Jebel Tubaik massif ^ and had for this reason carried the frontier as far to the south east as possible. This was clearly the intention underlying the choice of the south-eastern terminal point of trie frontier (point Z) 9 and seemed to give a good ground for asking tnat the whole of the Jebel Tubaik massif with all its spurs and buttresses should belong to Trans-Jordan in the same way as the W'udi Sirhan system with its projecting edges should belong to Hejd. The use of geographical co-ordinates in the description of thefrontier had merely been used as a convenient method of describing the frontier as shown on the 1918 map. 4 # wihG C0MMAHD3R PIRIE emphasised the importance from a defence point of view to Trans-Jordan and the Royal Air Force of the car track which runs round the edge of the Jebel Tubaik and westward along the de facto frontier between the Hodjaz and Trans-Jordan. He pointed out that raids planned into Trans-Jordan from hejd would debouch from tne Jebel Tubaik and that it was essential to oe able to patrol the southern edge of the Jebels 9 both by air and by land in order to prevent hostile elements penetrating the hills in order to concentrate for raiding purposes. It was brought out in this connection that 9 while it was desirable to secure as wide a margin as possible to the east and south of the car track* the Jebel Waila was not actually essential to Trans-Jordan since the track runs through a valley between the Jebel Waila and the Tubaik massif. It was also suggested miau* ix occasion arose* some arrangement similar to that adopted in the case of the Wadi Sirhan might be agreed upon for the southern section viz. that the projecting edges of the massif of the Jebel Tubaik should remain in Trans-Jordan. 5 # t®. WILLIAMS raised the question of when and how the matter should be broached with Ibn Laud. It v, ' as undecided whether this question should be taken up as part of the projected general negotiations and tnere might possibly be advantages in merely maintaining the stamis—puo^. 6. MR. RLMDEL said he felt strongly that the wisest course would be for us to tame the initiative at once. The 1918 map was hopelessly inaccurate and we 9 therefore* had a good reason for suggesting a re-definition of theHH 139 -8- 'boundary 0 Moreover ? if ? Imowing the facts, we took no action, we should be in a somewhat invidious position if the Saudis themselves took the initiative later on. MR. RENDER, therefore, suggested that we should at once take up the matter with Ibn Saud on some such lines as follow. We have new received information which showed not only that the relationship between certain physical features and the length tude and latitude on the 1918 map was hopelessly inaccurate, but that the relative positions of the physical features themselves had been proved in several cases to be shov/n incorrectly. The intentions of the negotiators of the Hadda Agreement in regard to the main features marked on the 1918 map were well understood, and had in practice been effectively carried out by the adoption of a de facto frontier which had existed for nearly ten years. Now that accurate information regarding the actual positions on the ground of the physical features is available, we suggest that the line obviously intended by the negotiators and in fact already adopted in practice in the present de f a cto boundary should be re-defined on the spot in the light of this information, and that a Commission with suitable terms of reference should be appointed for this purpose. 7. BRIGADIER MACLEOD said that he agreed with Mr. Rendel's view that we should take the initiative at once. He also agreed that in presenting our views as to the frontier, we should ignore questions of detail and should deal with the question on the broad issue of the intentions of the negotiators. 8. MR. BLAXTER suggested that the balance of advantage might still lie with a waiting policy. In-9- i |4o spite of a few rcinor incidents, particularly in t’r.-. neighbourhood of Hazim, the position was not unsatis tory, and we knew that the Saudis were as much in the dark about the geographical situation of the frontier ao been ourselves at one time. As regards the proposed Commission, he expressed considerable doubt regarding its prospects of success unless the frontier to he demarcated had first been agreed with Ibn Saud. 9 , WING COJvMANDER PIRIE, while admitting he had no instructions on this point 5 felt uneasy as to the possih result of the action contemplated, Ke felt some apprehension that if we once took the matter up with Ihn Saud we might conceivably find ourselves in the position of being forced to admit that part of the car track was actually in Nejd territory. In this case the use of the car track would be denied to Trans-Jordan witn the result that the problem of defence would be extremely difficult if not insuperable. The present position whereby we used the track with only occasional and very half-hearted protests from Ibn Saud, who was obviously uncertain as to the exact situation, suited the Air Ministry admirably. The action contemplated, he felt, might place us in a worse position from a military point of view than we were at present, RONDEL anticipated no serious difficulty in devising terms of reference for the Commission which would enable it to work on the basis both of the de_fact i o frontier and of the intentions of the negotiators in regard to the main features. It would of course be necessary for Sir Andrew Ryan to agree with the Saudi Government on these terms of reference in the first instance. II weconcentrated on securing the establishment, by these terms of reference, of the two guiding principles of (a) the intentions of the negotiators in regard to the main features (i.e, the Wadi Sirhan system with its projecting edges and the Jebel Tubalk mas sif with its easterly and south-eadterly spurs) and (b) of the d o facto line which has been observed in practice during the last ten years or so, he did not think that the Commission would meet with serious difficulties. Ibn Saud had alv/ays shown a considerable sense of realism and was more likely to be influenced by these commonsense considerations than by abstract principles such as a strict adherence to geographical co-ordinates. Moreover, the British members of the Commission would have very clear instructions as to the desiderata of His Majesty’s Government and would be able to refer for instructions on any point of difficulty, and it would still be possible, if necessary, to adjourn the Commission’s work if any difficulty should prove insure rable. 11. Some discussion took place regarding the position of poinm E (i.e. the southern terminal of the Trans-Jordan Nejd frontier). The unilateral declaration regarding the Trans-Jordan - Hejaz frontier made by His Majesty’s Government at the time of the signature of the Treaty of Jedda states that His Majesty ? s Government regard the frontier as following a straight line drawn from the termination of the Trans-Jordan - Nejd frontier (Point S) to a point on the Hejaz railway two miles south of Mudawara. Even if drawn on an enlargement of the 1918 map, such a line would seem to leave a part of the Trans-Jordan car track to the south of the Jebel Tubaik in Saudi Arabia; but, applied to the ground, it would cut across the Jebel, which we now know to be many miles further south than it appears on the 1918 map. Unfortunately, it seems practically certain that we shall not be able to secure the establishment of point E so far south that a straight line drawn from it to a point two miles south of Mudawara would leave all the southerly spurs of the Jebel Tubaik and the southern curve of the Trans-Jordan car track within Trans--Jordan. The view was expressed by MR. PRIIOSL that it would nevertheless be worth fixing this point as far south as possible, and that it would be better to do this than to risk the point being eventualJy established so far to the north as to lead to a bisection of the Jebel Tubaik. If the frontier were delimited now by friendly agreement in the light of the de facto situation and of the intentions of the negotiators of the Hadda Agreement, it might be possible to take its southern terminal (Point a) somewhat further to the south and east; and, if the question of the Trans-Jordan - Nejd frontier were amicably settled to the satisfaction of both parties, it might even be possible eventually for His Majesty’s Government, in the improved atnosphere that would then exist, to obtain the acquiescence of the Saudi Government in a slight amendment of their unilateral definition of the Trans-Jordan - Hejaz frontier by which the whole of t he Trans-Jordan car track would be included in Trans-Jordan. 12. MR. WILLIAMS asked whether it was still intended to link up the frontier question with the proposed general negotiations wit h I bn Baud. He foresaw some danger inthis and pointed out that we should not he asking Ibn gaud for any concession., but merely suggesting to him that the frontier intended by the negotiators of the hadda Agreement should be re-defined in the light of the true positions of the physical features in the frontier area* Moreover^ the position would be unsatisfactory if trie general negotiations hung fire. 13. MR. RENDER expressed the view ti^at the frontier question should be taken up at the same time as the general negotiations * but should not be too closely linked with them. By this means we could treat the question of the Nejd frontier independently and on its ov/n merits * but at the same time we might be in a position to reap the benefit if a favourable atmosphere were to be created in the general negotiations ^ and might even make some play with concessions in other directions to secure a more com plaisant attitude on the part of the baudis over small adjustments of the line. On the other hand &lt;, of course 5 any hitch in the general settlement might re-act unfavourably on the negotiations about this frontier. But in that case we should be no worse off than we are at present. Mr. Rendel explained that the preparation of detailed instructions for bir Andrew Ryan was still held up pending further views from the Government of India and the Persian Gulf regarding questions connected with the south-eastern frontiers* Bahrein* Koweit* etc. * but tnere was neverthe less some prospect of our being able to maue considerable concessions to Ibn baud in connection with these matters* and particularly the Bahrein transit dues* and these might help to constitute a quid pro quo in connection with the settlement of any difficulties that might arise over the present question.-18- 14. urn 14. ME. EmNDEL said that he wished to mention a point which had been raised hy the Foreign Office legal advisers They agreed that His Majesty’s government would be on solid ground in claiming that the true position of the frontier must be deduced from the intentions of the negotiators of the liadda Agreement regarding the physical features shown on the 1918 map which they had before them 5 and which was specifically mentioned in the Agreement * and that the description of the frontier by geographical co-ordinates was merely secondary c, and explanatory of their intentions. But the strongest legal a: gument in support of this view was the specific mention in the liadda Agree ment of tht fact that the Transjordan - Mejd frontier started u at the intersection of Meridian 89°^ and Parallel 3h°N which marks the termination of the frontier between Nejd and Iraq*' . The Iraq - Nejd frontier was laid down in the protocol of Uqair* which describes its western terminal as trie Jebel Anaisa ^ merely adding the geographical co-ordinates for explanatory purposes. The Jebel Anaiza is now known to lie some twenty miles to the north or north east of the intersection of Meridian 39° and Parallel s and it is clear therefore that 9 as there cannot be a gap between the two frontiers 5 the Trans-Jordan frontier must be taken as beginning, at the Jebel Anaiza and not at the o o intersection of Meridian 89 and.Parallel 3e . This argument was«, in the view of the Foreign Office legal advisersr absolutely conclusive^ ana would enable us to re-draw the wnole frontier. But it operated in this par ticular sector to the disadvantage of Transjordan since it would mean the loss to Transjordan of a narrow triangle-14- of territory tstv/een the Jebel buraizathe intersection of Meridian &lt;39° ana par allel 3jd°, and Point B noitn-//e^t of the Wadi Sirhan ahere the Transjordan - Nejd frontier turns south. This would slightly narrow the corridor, which would he most inconvenient; hut we obviously could not adopt a principle when it suited us (as in the ^outn) and discard it where it went against us (as in 'tne north) If 5 however , we did not lay too much stress on the point regarding the geographical co-ordinates, hut Lss^u our request for a re-definition of the frontier primarily on the general inaccuracy of the maps, on the existence of a de fact o line and on trie hroad intentions of trie negotiators, particularly as regards the wadi Sirhan system and the Jebel Tubaik massif, it might he possible to avoid any serious alteration in the northern sector of the frontier, particularly us such an alteration might involve a corresponding re-definition or alteration in the frontier between Saudi Arabia ana Iraq, wnicn v/c*s not strictly speaking a concern oi his ^.ajesty s Government. 15. Discussion of this point ensued, ana tne general feeling was that we must face any risk there might he that our attitude in regard to the southern section would disadvantageously affect the position in the north. At the worst, only a relatively small section of territory might have to he ceded to Ibn Baud hut any adjustment of this sort would not affect tne ownership of hazim which, under any interpretation of the line, would remain in Transjordan. 16. MR. BLAXTER referred to the desire o± tne Transjordan authorities to get the frontier between-15- Points B and C moved some ten miles to the eastv/ard and he suggested that this should not he lost sight of if ar fy opportunity should present itself during the general negotiations. MR. R3NDEL said that the alteration of the frontier proposed hy the Trans-Jordan authorities in/olv-^d a cession of territory hy Ihn Sand. There was no hope whatever of extracting such a concession trom the ning unless it were balanced hy equivalent concessions hy his Majesty’s Government in other directions. 17. The meeting then discussed immediate procedure. It became apparent that the representatives of all the Departments desired an opportunity of referring the matter to their higher authorities and that no useful purpose would therefore he served at the present stage hy submitting the views of the meeting to the Middle East Official Sub committee. It was finally decided that the minutes of the meeting should first he agreed 9 and that they should bhen he circulated to the Departments concerned for their comments.■ —- N/^7 ' • (THIS rOGUIt'TBFT IS TH^LJ &gt;B 2^EI!X.JI t '‘ WTCi RBTr;M1 ’ 'T(I KA^STY'S GOVHR^.iIIT-l) SECRET .

AIR MINISTRY, 8th February, 1935, Sir, I am commanded 'by the Air Council to refer to Colonial Office letter No. 77006/1/35 of the 26th January, forwarding the views of Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister as to the course v/hich His Majesty’s Government should he advised to adopt in the light of the fresh information regarding the position of certain physical features, which has been obtained as a result of recent surveys, of the Transjordan—Nejd frontier area. 2. The Council fully appreciate the desirability, on political grounds, of talcing up the question of the frontier with Ibn Saud now, but feel some anxiety lest the result of any such negotiations should adversely affect the security of Transjordan, 3. In the opinion of the Council the inclusion of the entire Jebel Tubaik massif and the Transjordan car track, as shown on War Office 1934 Sketch Map of Frontier Area Aqaba to Wadi Sirhan, is essential to the security of Transjordan. It is, in their view, of equal importance that the frontier line CD should touch the Western edges of the Wadi Sirhan, as was clearly intended by the negotiators cf the Hadda agreement. The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, S. /. 1. ft See Paper No. M. E. (0) 171. - 1 --2- €1 &lt;» 5 3 As Sir Philip Cunliff e-Lis ter will appreciate, any tribal elements preparing to raid into Transjordan, normally asoernole in the vicinity of the watering places and excellent natural cover in the Wadi Sirhan on the East, or the Jebel Tubaik in the South* 4. with the frontier 'between points C and D touching the Western edges of the Wadi Sirhan, aircraft are able without crossing the frontier, to reconnoitre the natural feature^ of the Wadi with reasonable chances of discovering any con centrations of raiding parties. It would, however, be im possible, without infringing the neutrality of Saudi Arabia, for aircraft to observe any concentrations or movement in the Wadi if the frontier between points C and D were adjudged uo be as laid down geographically in the Kadda agreement; ana as a result raiding parties would be able to debouch from the Wadi without warning, making the tasu of interception, especially if the raids were heading for Amman, almost insuper able* 5. Similarly, with the Transjordan car track in our hands, we are able to prevent the assembly of ary concentration of hostile tribesmen in the Jebel Tubaik and thus to make raiding from that direction an extremely hazardous undertaking. Should, however, even any part of the car track be adjudged to be v/ithint iiejd' the problem of the defence of Transjordan irom raido from the South becomes at once one of ohe greatest d.ifxiculty. As Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister is no doubt aware, the present situation whereby the Military Forces of Transjordan are able to use the car track with only occasional and very half-nearbed protests from Ibn Saud, is by no means unsatisfactory to the Air Ministry* 6. The Council trust that they may receive an assurance that their views on this matter are accepted and that in anynegotiations undertaken with Ihn Sand no efToro would oe spared to obtain in full the desiderata outlined aoove c.nd that no agreement would he entered into with him which did not guarantee :- (i) the inclusion of the entire car track within Transjordan; (ii) the alignment of the frontier between points C and D along the Western edges of the Wadi Sirhan. 7. Unless such assurance can be given the Air Council request that the matter should be examined b^ the Middle &amp;ast Sub-Committee before any decision is taken to open negotiations* 8.

In October last (vide my No.44) I agreed with suggestion that advantage might be taken of discussion or comprehensive settlement of outstanding questions to clear up the frontier situation. But while I still appreciate the desire of His Majesty’s Government to re-define boundary with reference to an accurate map I have now reached the conclusion after consulting Cox and Peirse* that there would be some danger and no real advantage in broaching the question with Ibn Saud at present. Ibn Saud acquiesced in the present d e facto frontier apart from occasional allegations of specific violations of the frontier by patrols and the language of his protests confirms the view that he does not feel on sure ground. If negotiations are opened we should at best secure the retention facto frontier and should avoid further complaints of like nature from Ibn Saud. But any negotiations must at an early stage reveal to Ibn Saud the fact that we have been operating for a considerable tine in what we knew to be, 9 according to frontier as defined by co-ordinates in the Hadda agreement, Saudi territory, and at the worst we might not only lose a strip of the Northern Corridor but also endanger - 1 -the possession of car tracks round jebel Tubaik which is vital for defence purposes. With regard to paragraph 15 of record of meeting of 7th January it appears doubtful whether Hazim would remain in Trans Jordan if point A were moved to the summit of Jebel Anaiza. I note that the Foreign Office Legal Adviser agrees that His Majesty’s Government would he on solid ground in claiming that true position of the frontier must he deduced from the intentions of the negotiators regarding physical features. The argument will he equally sound in future if the question is talcen up on Saudi initiative and would also furnish answer to any criticism of action of His Majesty’s Government in not clarifying position as soon as the inaccuracy of the map was discovered. Consequently I strongly recommend that His Majesty’s Government should not take the initiative in broaching the question with Ibn Baud. -2-t (THIS DOCUl'IHNT IS THE PROPERTY OR HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S OOVERNMERTR SECRET.

He has now sent personal letter in reply to one from me giving particulars of note exchanged last year. he states that Shaib Thaniyya Taraif is a large Shaib (valley or water course) beginning on Transjordan frontier ana ending in Saudi territory. Statement that it is in Transjordan is therefore incorrect. He expresses the hope of coming to a clear understanding with me on subject at an early meeting.-3- m Previous Saudi communication descriloed place in question with reference to distance from named places given differently in each. Fuad’s present description suggests that he is relying on 1918 map. Addressed to Foreign Office No. 33, repeated to Transjordan No. 31. Decypher, No. 34. IV. Sir A. Ryan (Jedda). R. 9.30 p.m. 20th February, 1935 20th February, 1935 Your telegram No. 31. I am impressed by views expressed in second sentence of paragraph 9, of record of meeting of 7th January though I cannot estimate extent or gravity of danger indicated. I also think that difficulty of agreement with Saudi Government on terms of reference will be greater than was perhaps realised at meeting especially if we have to refer to de facto situation otherwise than as a resultant of the intention of original negotiators. Mention of it as a separate factor (see paragraph 10 of record) would probably create suspicion that we had definitely encroached on Saudi territory and knew it, While drawing attention to theabove considerations I agree it would be better to take the matter up without further aelay with Saudi Government on lines suggested in paragraph 6 of record. Their attitude regarding ihaniyya Taraif (see correspondence ending with my telegram No. 33) both afford an opportunity for this and increases necessity for clarification. Moreover Saudi Minister in London toldme on the 19th February that he favoured an attempt at delimitation on the ground. Definiteness of this language suggests that he was expressing Ibn Baud’s views. iibove applies to Trans jordan-Nejd frontier, consider however that attempt might be made at outset to get the King to clarify the position between point 3. and Mudawara. Question of including matter in general negotiations no longer arises. I do not think any concessions that we can offer in Eastern Arabia will of themselves affect King’s attitude in regard to Transjordan frontier. Nevertheless his avowed desire to get as many questions as possible settled and his fear of complications with His Majesty's Government on eastern side may make him more amenable as regards his north-western frontier. I agree strongly with the view expressed by Mr. Rendel in paragraph 16 of record.

SECRET. RECORD OF A MEETING AT I’HE FOREIGN OFFICE ON THE 28TH SEPTB.1BER REGARDING THE DEFINITION OF Tf CAUDI-TRiJ ^JORDAN FRONTIER. Mr. Rcndel presided at the Meeting, which was attended hy Sir A. Ryan (His Majesty's Minister at Jedda) and Major Glubb (Chief Desert Control OfficeYin Transjordan); Mr. Blaxter of the Colonial Office; Colonel McLeod and Major Fryer of the War Office; Group-Captain Peck and Group-Captain McClaughry of the Air Ministry; and Mr. Johnstone. 2. MR. REFDEL and SIR A RYAN explained the general position of this question. After his conversations with King Ihn Baud at Taif shortly before his departure on leave, Sir A. Ryan had suggested that it might be desirable to arrange a general settlement of all the major questions outstanding with the Saudi Government, on the basis of making a fairly liberal concession to Ibn Saud as regards his eastern and south-eastern frontiers, subject to a satisfactory agreement being reached on other matters. The Middle East Official Sub-Committee had considered and endorsed this proposal on September 15th, and advantage had been taken of the recent visit of the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs to London to put it before him. Fuad Bey Hamza had shewn himself, v/illing to consider in principle the possibility of a settle--, ment on the lines suggested.3c One of the questions which might possibly be brought into^ettlement was that of the Saudi-Trans Jordan frontier. Various difficulties had arisen about this frontier and it might be to the advantage of His Majesty's G-q vernment and of the Transjordan Government to take this opportunity to try to get these difficulties cleared up once and for all. It had appeared from the conversations with Tuad Bey that King Ibn Saud was not prepared to consider the possibility of abandoning his claims to the Aqaba-Maan district, although he y/as willing that the present arrangement with regard to that area, as embodied in the letters exchanged at the time of the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda, should continue. It had however been tentatively suggested to Fuad Bey that, while the problem of the Trai sjordan-Iiejaz frontier might be left in abeyance, the opportunity of a general settlement might be taken to clarify the situation in regard to the Transjordan- Nejd frontier where various local uncertainties might need some clarification. 4. Fuad Bey had taken the line that, if the Aqaba-Maan question were left in abeyance, his Government would prefer not to touch on the de fac to Transjordan-Hejaz frontier at all; but he had not excluded the possibility of a clarification in regard to the Transjordan-Nejd frontier, regarding which i 6 ' vas recognised that there had been occasional controversy, notably regarding Hazim. The purpose of the present meeting was to determine, so iar as was possible on the information at present available, whether it would in fact be worth while to include this question,/question (i.e. a ’'clarification” of the Transjordan-Nejd frontier) in the proposed general settlement, the negotiation of which might be expected to start soon after Sir A. Ryan’s return to Jedda in December. The question would fit naturally into the suggestion which had been made that a general redefinition of the frontiers of Saudi Arabia should be agreed on, as far as possible, as part of a general Anglo-Saudi settlement, in view of the uncertainty which existed regarding various parts of the frontier, it might be very desirable to take this opportunity to clear up the whole matter: On the other hand it was possible that any attempt at a redefinition of the frontier might either not improve the position or merely lead to fresh disputes with the Saudi Government, and that for this reason it night be better to continue on the present indefinite basis. 6 . Mr. Rendel further explained that so far as the purely legal aspect of the question was concerned, the Foreign Office were advised that there was solid ground for contending that the true position of the Transjordan-Nejd frontier must be deduced from the frontier line drawn by the negotiators of the Hadda agreement on the 1918 edition of the T: 1,000,000 inter national map of Asia (which is specifically referred to in Article I of the Hadda Agreement) in relation to the physical features shown on that map, and not in relation to the lines of latitude and longitude marked thereon, which in the view of the Foreign Office, had only been quoted by the negotiators for convenience in describing a frontier which had in fact been i agreed on on the basis of the physical features only. The 1918 1 map had now been proved inaccurate, and the relationship of thePhysical features to the latitude and longitude was in fact quite difierent from that shown on it. But in the Foreign Office view, particularly as the 1918 map was referred to in the text, the system of physical features as shown on that map was still the determining feature rather than the (explana tory and supplementary) geographical descriptions given in the relevant documents. 0. If the Transjordan-Nejd frontier could now be redefined on the basis of the 1918 map, i.e. as drawn on that map in relation to the physical features only, the difficulties which haa arisen might be disposed of. a solution on these lines would have two particular merits: (a) it would render it unnecessary to take u P separately each of the disputed points the frontier, e.g. the question of Kazim; and (b) if the southern terminal point of the frontier (the so-called Point E) couxd once be established in a manner satisfactory to His ,.^esty s Government, it might greatly ease the position in regard to the Transjordan-Hejaz frontier, of which the termination of the Transjordan-Nejd frontier, wherever it might to, was m fact the key point. The present position was that the so-called Point E had been marked on the latest sketch maps of this area solely according to the geographical description in the Hadda agreement i.e. at the intersection of Meridian 88 °E and Parallel 29°S5' North. But if the Foreign Office interpretation of the Hadda Agreement were adoptedf &amp;nd P ° int E were ^ablished in the same relation to the ’ Physical features as on the 1918 map referred to in the Agreement, irrespective of its description by geographical coordinates,/8./ rut) 5. coordinates, it might be bound to lie from ten to twenty miles further to the south-east i.e. between the Jebel Waila and the Jebel Shibliya ridges, and some five miles or so west-north-west of the southwesterly end of the latter ridge. Major G-lubb pointed out (at a later stage of the discussion) that the fact that the bluff kn^Sa as Mai si la (which is shown on the 1918 map as coincident with the frontier to the north of the Jebel Waila) appears on the revised sketch map as very much further to the east, but as in much the same relation to the Jebel Waila as in the 1918 nap, seemed to suggest that the physical features in tills area might lie in approximately the same relationship to each other as shown on the 1918 map, notwithstanding the general inaccuracy of that map, and this would further strengthen the case for accepting the inter pretation of Point S suggested by the Foreign Office. It might then be that, if this interpretation could be established, and the true point E were thus found to lie ten or twenty miles further to the south-east than had hitherto been supposed, a line drawn from it (as the true terminal point of the Trans- jord&amp;n-Nejd Frontier) to a point two miles south of Mudawara Station (in accordance with the definition of the Transjordan- Hejaz frontier laid down by His Majesty’s Government in Sir G. Clayton’s note of May ISth 1927), would leave within Transjordan territory the present R, A.F. landing ground to the south of the Jebel Tubeik, which was the point of most importance to His Majesty's Government. If such a result could be secured, it would be well worth trying to reach an agreement with the Saudi Government with a view to securing the definite establish ment of Point E in tnis manner,,mm * C\%&amp; SIR A. RYAN suggested that in effect the present prohlem raised three questions:- (a) Would it be to the general interest of his Majesty’s Government to raise the Transjordan frontier question at all with the Saudi Government? (b) If so, what would be the best method of approaching the problem? Should His Majesty's Government suggest a written redefinition of the frontier in the first instance, or a delimitation of the frontier on the ground by a frontier delimitation commission? (c) In any case, would it be possible to establish the southern terminal of the Transjordan-Nejd frontier (Point E) in such a way as to give His Majesty's Government what they required on the Transjordan-Hejaz frontier (i.e. the Jebel Tubeik landing ground) without any further reuefinition of that frontier? 9. In the ensuing discussion, these points were taken in the reverse order. As regards point (c), it v/as agreed that the recent survey operations to the east and south east of the Jebel Tubeik, had not provided sufficient material for it to be yet possible to state exactly where Point E would fall if established purely in relation to the physical features of the 1918 map. 10. The War Office Representatives explained that the 1918 map v/as so inaccurate that the physical features shown on it might either not exist at all, or only exist in a very different relationship to each other from that shown on the map. Major Glubb on the other hand explained that the relevant physical features i.e. the Maizila bluff, the Wadi Tnanayya,/Thanayya, the Je'bel ^aila and the o eh el oiiioliya ridges were in f^ct well-marked features, well-known to the local inhahioants, and bearing much the same relationship to each other as shown on the 1918 map. It was pointed out that no survey had been carried out over this particular area, in deference to what were under stood to be the wishes of the Foreign Gil ice. Sir A. hyaa explained, however, that the cave jit which he had put forward, and which had led to this restriction, was only intended to apply to the carrying out of a survey over areas which were incisputably Saudi on any interpretation of the relevant instruments, ro^n S IR A. RYAN and MAJOR 0-LHB3 pointed out that the part of Saudi Arabia immediately adjoining the area in question did not appear to be effectively occupied by the Saudi authorities, and that there would therefore be no objection to carrying out an aerial survey for at any rate twenty miles to the south-east of Point S as provisionally marked on the latest sketch maps on the basis of the geographical co-ordinates. 11. It was agreed that on the present data no definite opinion could be formed as to whether the Foreign Office inter pretation of Point £ would bring it sufficiently far to the South-East to enable a straight line to be drawn therefrom to a point two miles south of Mudawara in such a way as to include the Jebel Tubeik landing ground in Transjordan. The next and most urgent step was therefore to carry out an immediate aerial survey on this area, so that this point might be cleared up. 12. Until this point was decided, it would be impossible to say whether it would be generally in the interest of Mis Majesty’s Government to raise the Transjordan irentier quesbion at all with the Saudi Government(Sir A. Ryan’s question (a)) since if Point E could not be satisfactorily established, it would probably be better not to pursue the matter at this stage at all.13. Ag regards the remainder of the Transjordan- Wejd frontier, Nx, Aendel pointed out that there might he considerable advantage in establishing our inter pretation of the frontier in relation to the Wadi Sirhan, since, if the frontier were crystallised on the basis of the geographical co-ordinates alone, a wide strip of country on the edge of the Wadi Sirhan would be lost to Transjordan, with consequences v/hich, as Major GTubb had pointed out in one of his reports a year or two ago, might be serious for the local tribes. Colonel Macleod was inclined to take the view that the physical features shown on the 1913 map on this area were in fact so uncertain that it would be impossible to establish any frontier satisfactorily in this area without a very careful new survey. But it was agreed that any survey over the edge of the Wadi Sirhan would be impossible without Saudi concurrence, since the Saudi Government exercise full administrative sovereignty over the Wadi Sirlian, so that the situation is quite different from that existing in the neighbour hood of Point E. On the other hand, Major Clubb stated that the Wadi Sirhan did possess a definite edge closely corresponding with the contour line shown on the 1913 map (in spite of the admitted inaccuracy of that map) so that it would not necessarily be impossible to establish in advance of a further general survey, a frontier line corresponding to that shown on the 1913 map in relation to the physical features on that map. 14. As regards 3ir a, Hyan's second question, it was thought that, if the matter were proceeded with, tner e•••.* ’ /3ft. IV'} \Zf oner e ml gat be advantages in aiming at the appointment oi a delimitation Oonmaiseion rather than in trying to secure a new written definition of the frontier. fuch a commission might be given a certain measure of dis cretion enacting it to make miner local adjustments on either side. It could make its own survey, and thus dispose of many minor difficulties in the course of its operations, io would be inclined to tackle problems on common sense lines and in the light of local factors and conditions; while the superior technical knowledge and skill of any British representatives on it would place them at a considerable advantage vis-h-vis the o-uci delegatee .aid might make it easier to secure a reasonable solution of any outstanding difficulties. Mr. Blaxter, however, suggested that there might be possible clangers in the appointment of a Delimitation Commission, unless Ibn naud had agreed beforehand that tne frontier laid down in the Iladda agreement 'was as drawn on the 191C map. lo. Ine geiiar-d conclusion oi the meeting, however, was tnat no decision could be reached as to the line no oe taken with the Saudi Government, or, indeed, as to wnethen one Question of the Transjordmi frontier should oe broached at all, until further information was available regarding the geography of the area, and po-rticularly regarding tne true position of the physical features in the neighbourhood of Point B. It was agreed tlij.t there need be no objection to an immediate extension of the recent survey of the south-Bast corner of nransjordan up to an approximte position at which Point npoint i.; migiit lie on the construction of the existing agreements most favourable to Transjordan, since Ihn baud was unlikely to protest, and, even if he did so, the survey would not have keen extended into territory indisputably belonging to Saudi Arabia. It was accordingly agreed that arrangements should at once bo put in hand for a supplementary survey on this basis, 1 it appeared, after further consideration, that the information collected during the recent survey did not sufficiently cover the area m respect of which further information was desired. If a supplementary survey were found to be desirable, the Air Ministry woulo. draft the necessary instructions to ’ohe local air authorities in consultation with Major Giubb; and they would seek the concurrence of the other interested Departments in the instructions as been drafted. soon as they havemam Notes.

The Saudi protest appears to have been occasioned by the presence of an armoured car and two aircraft at a point on a car track which has been used for routine patrols during the last three years by the Transjordan authorities without any protest from Ibn Saud, and which according to the map is within the Had da Agreement Frontier, though a recent survey has cast doubt on the accuracy of the map^ -It is considered, however, that it would be inadvisable to disclose this doubt to Ibn Saud at the present stage, and His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires at Jedda has been instructed to reply to the Saudis that the car track has been used as a matter of routine for the past three /three years and that it is situated in Transjordan territory. The Saudi protest comes at an awkward moment ^ince H.M.G. had decided to carry out a further survey in this area in the near future, with a view to collecting information which is essential for determining the line to be taken with the Saudis on the whole question of the Transjordan frontier, which is one of the questions which Sir Andrew Ryan will have to discuss with the Saudi Government on his return to Jedda. The Foreign Office and the Charge' d’Affaires are averse to making any communication to the Saudis regarding this further survey, since this might give the impression that H.M.G. are doubtful of the strength of their case in maintaining that the track is definitely within Transjordan territory, but the Resident does not consider that an additional survey is likely to lead to incidents of a serious nature. There are reports of disaffection among the Ifiorthern -tribes of Saudi Arabia, and Saudi rces have been sent to deal with the situation (Please see P.Z. 6441/34 and the extracts from R.A.F.Reports at Flag D). This explains the presence of Saudi forces in the areas'ad j oining the car track which haVehitherto been believed not to be under effective Saudi administrative control. 1 -rirAL COMM* * POUT ' C 3 o 0G137706/34 Secret Pt, II. PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Acting High Commissioner for Trane-Jordan# (Sent 10.15 p.ra., 5th October, 1934.) Important. No. 58 Secret. It is probable that in near future attempt will be made to reach settlement possibly in new treaty of all outstanding questions of ma^or importance between His Majesty*s Government and Ibn Saud. Question of Ibn Saud*s frontiers in eastern and south-eastern Arabia hae recently come into prominence. Under Conventions between United Kingdom and Turkey of July 29th 1913 and Karch 9th 1914 eastern and south-eastern boundaries of Ottoman territory are laid down approximately as follows. A straight line running from the coaet of the Persian Gulf near Ukair as far as parallel 20, thence at an angle of 45° to Lakmat on northern frontier of Aden Protectorate. question of Ibn Baud's boundaries in eastern Arabia has recently assumed importance in connection with oil concessions in Persian Gulf area. His Majesty's Government originally informed Ibn Baud that they regarded his eastern boundaries to be those laid down in 1913 and 1914 Angld-Turkish Conventions, but as a result of further information now received from which it appears very probable that there is a No Man's land between the frontier laid down in the Conventions, and the hinterland frontiers of the Persian Gulf sheikhs, His Majesty's Government are now of opinion that while they are justifiedJuatifi** in ntgotlntlag on the baele of the Anglo-Turkiah line it would be reasonable end expedient to offer to treat this frontier question in a liberal spirit in return for acceptable concessions elsewhere* liis Majesty*a minister at Jedda haa also had reoent oomrereatione with Ibn Saud as to future relatione between his ia4ssty f s Oorernnient and Saudi-Arabia, and it appsars that an opportune time may now be approaching to endeavour to reach a general settlement with Iba Baud of all outstanding questions. Concessions which it may be desirable to make to Ibn Saud in respect of his eastern frontiers may offer valuable bargaining counter in other directions. 2. Present position is that informal conversations have taken place in hondon with Fuad Bey Hamza with a view to establishing a basis for discussion of general settlement foreshadowed above as soon as Sir A.Ryan returns to .Tedda in December. It has been suggested that this discussion might afford a more favourable opportunity of clarifying situation in regard to the Saudi-Trans-Jordan frontier than if it were left to be dealt with Independently later. Preliminary conversations make it almost certain that Ibn Saud will wish to leave dispute regarding attribution of Aqaba-Ma*an region in abeyance, but attempt might still be made to secure our desiderata in Trans-Jordan-HeJd sector by redefinition or even delimitation on ground of frontier in that area and perhaps also to secure (though conversations with Fuad Hamza were not encouraging on this point) Ibn Uaud^e acquiescence in a new definition of de facto frontier between Trans -Jordan and Hejaz which would give us our desiderata in that sector also.3 » I shall h 3 glad to learn whether you eee any ion in priaciple to Saudi -'Trane-Jordan .irontior problem bein£. handled on above lines and to be furnished with any vieweyou may dsoirs to offer at this stage. 4* Information obtained vn a result of recent survey of He4az-Trunf5-Jordan frontier area ha© been subject of discuasion between Departments concerned at which Drain Gator and alubb were present and it appears that certain eneentia! infomation arcund point B is lacking. +n view of proposed nogctis.tion© it la desirable to identify end ostabfish the correct positions of points such an Jebel '.valla i»;;i-'ked on 1913 map in vicinity of point 1.

T t * i Q 3 4 } iBritish Legation, Jedda# 25th September, 1934 0 Sir, With reference to my despatch No*28b (2520/115/13) of the 18th September, in which I briefly reported Ibn Sard’s return to Riyadh from Taif, I have the honour to inform you that although the King^ movements convey the impression that the general situation in this country give no cause for disquietude, I have recently received reports from two sources which would suggest that Ibn Sard’s triumphant assertion of power in his recent struggle with the Yemen has not altogether overawed certain disaffected elements within his own country. 2. Discontent is said to exist in the Jauf and Teima areas and forces are being sent there to stabilise tne situation. My Indian Vice-Consul has just returned from a visit of several weeks to Medina and reports that recruiting is being unobstrusively carried on in the town, the troops being destined for service in those northern districts. That there was trouble, of an undefined nature, in respect of three tribes in the north whose names however were not specified, I gathered a few days ago indirectly from a subordinate in the Governorste here. 3. These reports lend interesting corroboration to the information which has recently been appearing in the Royal Air Force Monthly Intelligence Summaries for Palestine and Trans-Jordan, of which the most recent example is contained in paragraph 261 of the Summary for August, 1934. 4./ The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., K.C.V.O etc., etc., etc.' I IUTEHIJAL SECURITY. V J ■ „ Paragraph 247 showed that there are important disaffected elements in northern SAUDI ARABIA; that internal security has deteriorated and that the trihes of JAUF intend to revolt if IJAWASH SKALLAU is given an official position in their district. Ample confirmation of the situation was forth coming during August. Several more letters were inter cepted from widely divergent sources all of which remark on the recrudescence of inter-tribal raiding and a growing discontent with the authorities. But towards the end of the month it became apparent that Government action was being taken to restore order in village and desert. The garrison of JAUF has been reinforced by a large number of camelmen (some sources give the number as 500), and a chain of military posts has been established between JAUF and the old HEDJAZ railway. -Monthly Summary of Intelligence, Palestine and Transjordan for August 1934.V mu m - -r' * c££) iM 1 4 M TEIMA. Jl6^. A mass of information has been received from various sources in northern SAUDI ARABIA during the month. Its consistency is remarkable and once again desert•interest is centred on TEIMA. The town, which has never submitted to the SAUDI regime, expected to be attacked after the REEAIDA revolt in 1932 and IBN RUMMAN, its Governor, made preparations to resist. (Para. 137 and 196 of 1932). His fears were not realised. Again, in December 1933, rumours were current of an impending attack (para. 144, 158 of 1933, and para. 214 of 1934); IBU RUMMAN then began to make alliances with the SAUDI tribes in his vicinity and even talked of initiating a revolt against I3N SAUD in the event of an unsuccessful issue to the war with the YEMEN. Para. 261 of the last Summary reported that IBN SAUD has taken measures to improve the security of his northern districts and has established certain posts between JAUP and the HEDJAZ railway. It now appears that he has also decided that TEIMA shall be brought to heel. Letters from IBN RUMMAN have been intercepted which say that action is about to be taken against TEIMA and that a determined resistance will be made. Also, letters intercepted on their way to TRANSJORDAN from HAIL and JAUE clearly show that there is recruiting activity in these districts and that the tribes have orders to raid the TEIMA flocks. IBN MUSAID, Governor of HAIL, seems to be the instigator of the movement. Various travellers from SAUDI ARABIA have confirmed the news in the letters.

Immediately before Saudi protest was received His Majesty's Government had decided to carry out in near future further survev oi tuis area (lasting 5 or 4 days and involving a few flights and snort ground trips to fix 3 or 4 key points) with a view to clearing up various obscurities on points about which accurate information is essential before decision can be reached as to line to be taken with Saudi Government on whole question of Transjordan frontier. Arrangements have been made, subject to concurrence of acting High Commissioner, for survey to start at end of this month and it is most important that it should not be unnecessarily delayed, I am most, reluctant to make any communication to Saudi Government regarding this survey, since it is not intended that aircrait should in any circumstances fly over indisputably Saudi territory and communication might only give impression that His Majesty's Government were doubtful of the strength of their case -ah maintaining that car-track and adjacent areas are definitely wi thin Trans j ordan, Hitherto it has been assumed that this survey could be carried out without risk of difficulty from Saudis since adjoining areas of Saudi territory have been believed not to be under effective Saudi administrative control.

Protest no doubt refer^s to presence on September 23rd at place named of armoured car and two aircraft in course of patrol on regular Transjordan frontier patrol car track. If so His Majesty's Government must point out that patrols of this nature along this track have been a matter of routine for past three years and that car-track on which place named is situated is in Transjordan territory.

The note declares place is Saudi territory and that the presence of aeroplanes and armed forces constitutes aggression and violation. Minister for Foreign Affairs deplores the incident, lodges official protest and states that he awaits satis faction and information as to measures taken to avoid recurrence, text by bag in due course.
