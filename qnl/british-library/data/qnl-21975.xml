This shipment of Tea represents quotas issued from this Department as far back as May 194-3 and up to February 12th, 194-4, from which you can see the delay experienced between the granting of the quotas, and the arrival of the Tea. It would therefore still appear advantageous,to press for direct shipment from Calcutta. In reply to paragraph 2, of your memorandum under review, before giving any opinion as to how long the above consignment will last, it would be necessary to know just how much is for Bahrain,and how much is for re-export to Saudi Arabia. It is,however, anticipated that the consignment for Bahrain should last for atleast 9 to 10 months, and will be disposed of in the proportions of 13 tons per month for local consumption,and 17 tons per month for barter.No.PA/FC/ OFFICE OF THE FOOD CONTROLLER, BAHRAIN: # 13 th August, H.B.1 ' 1 s Political Agent, Bahroin* \ M emorand um Reference your memoranduia No.C/1127 of 30th July, 194-A- I enclose herewith a list showing the distribution of quota for Tea for the year 1944/4-5. — ' FOOD CONTROLLERMo.

Subject:- Tea Political Agent, Bahrain has reported that of the quota of 417 tons for the year ending March, 1944,only 61 tons had arrived at Bahrain up to August last. He indicates that the main reason for delay is due to the fact that the tea had to be railed from Calcutta to Bombay and there await allocation of shipping space. It is pointed out that, apart from this channel being inconvenient considerable expense is incurred in railing and storage. 2. It is therefore suggested that Government of India reconsider the question of shipment, which could be effected from Calcutta, as jit is understood, in the case of tea quotas for Iraq and Persia. SD.

Position, however, is that, while expprt of frustrated teas will be debited to regular quota to start with, export of frustrated teas will be allowed even after 1944-45 allocation has been^exceeded, and Government of India will meanwhile continue negotiations with ELs Majesty’s Government regarding quota position resulting from export of frustrated teas, in these circumstances there should be no reluctance to import frustrated teas. 5. Government of India will be glad if urgent instructions are issued to Political Agents to facilitate import of frustrated teas and Government of India informed by telegram of action taken. . 6. Procedure laid down in Foreign express Letters No. 812-N/44, dated 28th January 1944, and Wo. 3(73)-N/43, dated the 27th July 1944 regarding release of tea is not applicable to these ’frustrated teas’Tas distinct from ’regular allocated tea’)T From point of view of consuming territory only relevant condi tiorv/-condition is that exports will be allowed to such consignees as now receive tea under Ministry of Fbod Scheme.

Our previous estimate of frustrated teas licensed prior to ISth^ September 1942 by Indian Tea Licensing Committee was approximately 8 million lbs. Further 3 million lbs. licensed since loth September 1942 by Conmittee who then had no power under Tea Control Act to refuse licences. Necessary legal powers since taken to refuse licences and Committee duly empowered. Out of total 11 million lbs. actual export Persian only estimated at less than 3 million lbs. are concerned about disposal balance 8 million lbs. frustrated tea which has been paia for by importers and covered by Committee’s licences although issued in some cases after 15th September 1942, destinations being not only Persia but other territories like Persian Gulf, Dubai, Muscat, Iraq, Sgypt.• As these teas did not fulfil conditions explained our 8335 dated 1st October 1943, we declined release so far. # As our exportable surplus now reduced to 364 million lbs., in circumstances explained our 2103 dated 23rd February we recommend following disposal of balance 8 millioniii lbs. of frustrated teas which are unsuitable for Indian or U.K. market. These should be released to respective destinations to be debited against their 1944 quota. Price, quality, freight, insurance must be settled between exporter® and importers without any responsibility attached to Ministry of Food or Tea Controller. If licences already issued expire on 31st March under Tea Control Act exporters should secure fresh licences. We consider these arrangements will (1) enable Combined Food Board to allocate more tea to countries from our 1944 exportable surplus (2) save Indian exporters from considerable loss (3) enable tea which would otherwise prove dead loss being consumed by markets wanting them. As quantity involved is small and its disposal should suit all interests concerned, we strongly recommend proposed course. On knowing your views we will obtain accurate Tinures and destinations so as to advise you further details.

J Sir, Having been £iven t# understand that the present system ef distributiag the annual allotment ef tea queta sanctiened fer Bahrein is being discontinued. Instead The Bahrein gevernment wants te import the whole allotment through one merchant dispensing with the rights el all importers. It is respectfully submitted that already a major portion of the trade in food stuffs has been dinerted from regular merchants who have already suffered in their business and very limited scope of work is left to them. With the introduction of the quota system and allett ment Honourable The Resident has always supported the — principle that control system does not mean the transfer- ing the trade from original merchants to some individuals. At the introduction of the quta system when the question of shipment for Saudi Arabia Persian Gulf section was raised it was Honourable The Resident who refrained % the Saudi Arabia Agency to inport directly but arranged thatfr the merchants herebeforeinterested were given the chance and their trade was nestored on the prewar procedure. It is requested that the distribution of allotments may as usual^be made in Bahrein amorng all the merchants as otherwise nearly the trade of those interested in food stuffs will come to a stand still and they will be the most sufferers to lose their whole scope and suffer heavily If your honour v/ill be kind enough to grant us an 'to interview we shill be able^place and satisfy your honour about the contentions raised in our application. *'^verdhandasTdhIraMDAS * Y.urs Obedie.tly, BAHREIN.

Memorandum: Reference your endorsement No. 3274-29/18 dated 13th August 1945. 2. One of the main objects of the Bahrain Govern ments measures in buying and importing food supplies etc. is to combat rises in prices and to reduce the cost of living. In the past the Government has been in the habit of paying 15% profit to importers of tea and by the new arrangement the Government will pay a commission of l-^% only to the firm that purchases the tea and ships it from India to Bahrain. The difference in cost will benefit the public consumers of tea. 3. Under the previous arrangement there was a serious leakage of tea from the stocks held by the merchants,bwhich were drawn upon by the Government. Cases after being taken over by the merchants became damaged and the quantities of tea diminished. The explanation given by the merchants was that the tea leaked from faulty cases. As tea was at one time worth Rs.9/- per lbs. there is reason to suppose that substantial losses of tea from storehouses were not due to accidental causes. When the Govern ment takes over tea it is believed that there will be no leakage from the stocks. 4. The tea will be issued to local authorised shopkeepers and to Government ration shops for sale in the same way as sugar is sold. 5. The statement by the petitioners that they have already suffered heavily, presumably in trade/during the war, is one which cannot be taken seriously. Most of the petitioners have made handsome fortunes from war time activities. Adviser to the Government.

The Poojara Trading Co. have also spprcached me in this connection. This canalisation of exports is directly opposed to the policy of the Government of India which is directed towards the liberalisation of exports as far as is possible within the frame work of the Control. I have accordingly informed Messrs Dhamanmal Issardas and the Poojara Trading Co. that I cannot agree to their request and that shipments must be handled by all members o£. the Persian Gulf States Pool. 2. It would be manifestly unfair to the other members of the r Pool if the Poojara Tradipg Co. were to be allayed to handle the whole of the Bahrain tea quota, particularly so as their fair share of the shipments is something below 10$. 3 .
