                           Abyssiniato Muskat [Muscat], Dr. Hojel's treasury examination of 1 March 1870, and the arrival of a french gunboat
                           La Bruatat Bushire and that he Commander and first officer called at the Residency.The letter also discusses Narroyen's attempts to get tube rose bulbs for Pelly and informs him that Isaacson has laid out a plot of ground for a flower garden; and reports from Reshire that the cattle are being set adrift to eat what little has attempted to grow and that they have given up hope of being able to cultivate their land this year. Edwards informs Pelly that he does not have high hopes for the melon and cucumber gardens and that he fears the fig and grape trees will also suffer from the lack of moisture but that they should have a good crop of dates.A postscript to letter encloses 3 papers on Bahrein [Bahrain] for Pelly's information (the papers are not enclosed) and reports on the movements of a Dutch frigate which is going from Koweit [Kuwait] to Bahrein and then on to Bunder Abbass [Bandar Abbas] and Bombay.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024189687.0x000033#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
