I append the following few remarks, which if accepted I think will make the buildinps more convenient. S. i^oat Office : (a)The Southern verandah ^B f x 8* is too mch shut in. '^he desk may be placed at the eastern end, and the west side of the verandah should be open. The south 'nlllars should be fewer 1m number and as wide apart as 'oossible - of a round or other ornamental abearance. (b) the proposed window at north-end of east side of the Main-room mny be made into a door for use on windy days, ^e ^ropos^d window on west side (into servants qixarters) is not nece^ary. (c) the northern verandah is not necessary, but the ground outside should be paved for a width of 6 feet,and the win lows and door-way should be pro vided with sloping fixed shades to kt^ep out rain and the early afternoon sun.s-s s, ^oatiaa^-ter' s Reai lfcnofc ; (a) Ground-plan.(1) Door, froja passape into verandah on North, imneoeasar^r, (2) Window in Hew Kitahen on 'Cast may be altered into a ventilator, high up, (3) the otsspool (?) shown outside the wall at north-west comer cannot be allowed,as the site is intended for a clerk's kitchen later on» (b) First ^loor. (1) Windows on &lt; ast side of Sitting room 18 f :c 11 • are not lesirable, as they will overlook servants * zenanas• (^)the 4 xrindows on south side of house might be provided with fixed sloping shades to keep out sun %nd rain# (3) I think 2 doors between bed-room and bath room are preferable, as some ojcupants may prefer to bathe down stairs, and to use the bath-room as a. sort of verandah, 4. V/hen your plans and Estimates are completed, please send them to me for submission to the r'ost master General, Bombay, as the :?*mds wlll^X imagine, have to be placed at your disposal by the Postal Department, njid not -ohe TPoreigh Lepartment. ^e Present Postmaster's Residence was built out of Postal Funds at a cost of r?:^7^8,11 #8 in 190^-03• I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant Gaptain , i J olitioal Afent, hahrain.No: 19081 Political ^enay BAHRAIN, Persian Gulf»/^August. 1908, From, , Major F.B .i -'rideanx, Political Agent, Bahrain. » 70, The Poatraaster General, BOMBAY. Sir, I have the honour to adflress you on the subject of the Post Office and Sub-Poatmster's resiience attached to the Political Agency, Bahrain. 2, You are probably aware that in 1900 A.l&gt;. the Government of India established an Assistant Political Agency ior an uncovenfu ted Civil Officer in this Station, and that in 1904 the appointaaent was raised to the Status of a Political Agency (a graded Officers appoint- nont) vide Foreign department Resolution ITo:1573-G dated flimla, the ISth July 1906. 3 * In 1901 t.he Crovemiaent of India sanctioned the t construction of an Official Kesiience for the Assistant Political Agent, and about the same period a correspond ence ensued betv- en yourself and the Political Real lent in the Persian Gulf on the subject of the provision of new quarters for the Sub-Postnaster. Previous to this time the Postal Lepartnent had b en paying is:? in rent for a Post Office in addition to is; 15 for a residence for the Sub-Po stuaater .

The Political Agent, however, re- quirea tliia room for hi a own office and an eatimate for Es. 4,768 Y^aa approved of by me for the conatruction of a P.W.D. building for the poat office. The Political Agent haa not been able to give the aite originally propoaed and a new site had to be selected and fresh eatimate prepared. I forward the new plana and fresh eatimate amounting to Fs. 7,661. It aeema to me that although the accommodation propoaed ia not excessive, that ia too large a aum to apend on a amall poat office like Bahrein which ia maintained largely for political reaaona. I would,therefore,enquire whether I may ac cept the eatimate or whether the Political authoritiea may be aaked either to allow the poat office to remain in the present situation or to provide free of coat some other suitable accommodation.
