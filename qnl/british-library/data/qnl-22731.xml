The orifice diameters were checked and all installations made in the presence of the Bahrein Governments Royalty Gauger. In some instances it has been necessary to change the original orifice size due to variations in refinery operations, but the older sheets have been included herein with the new for purposes of record.

ROYALTY GAS METERING File #075.12 Dear Sir: In December 1944 an auxiliary royalty meter R-23A was added to No.2 Power Plant to measure the gas consumed at this plant during times when the flow was too low to be measured by the original meter R-23* Since then it has been observed that the flow has been consistently so low as always to be measured by this auxiliary meter,' the original meter virtually being inopera tive. In view of this it has been decided to remove the auxiliary meter R-23A from service and revise the orifice plate for R-23. Accordingly the orifice data sheet for R-23A is cancelled and should be removed from your Royalty Metering Manuals and a copy of the revised sheet for R-23 is attached for insertion intfo your Books Nos. 3 and 4.

These are R-9o 'Total make up gas to Crude &amp; P,K»R. Units n - $0 lbs® Fuel Gas System; capacity increased because of anticipated increase in the amount of gas used when field gas is introduced. R-18. 'Fuel Gas to Atmospheric Furnace' - No.3 Crude Unit; capacity increased because of increased Crude throughput. R-24.. n 50 lbs. Fuel Gas Supply' - NoCrude Unit; capacity increased because of increased Crude throughput and anticipated increase in the amount of fuel gas used when field gas is introduced. R-25. 'Fuel Gas to Unit' - G.C.U.; capacity increased because an additional portion of the unit is now used for rerunning Polymers. R-26. 'Propane Fuel Gas to Compressors' - G.C.U. Compressor House; capacity decreased because only three compressors are now running instead of the original thirteen. R-29. 'Gas from Depropanizer Reflux Drum' - Polymer Plant; capacity decreased because the amounts of gas passing through this line were not sufficient to give an accurate reading. BAHRAIN R' ^ ,PA-ZCL - 2 - 16th August, 1947. Two copies of each of the Orifice Meter Data Sheets covering these revisions are attached for transmittal to the Financial Adviser to the Bahrein Government for insertion in his Books Nos» 3 and 4o Attached also are copies of the official data sheets for two new Royalty meters R-37 and R-38, R-37 measures the field gas coming into the Refinery Fuel Gas System and R-38 the field gas to the Engine Fuel Gas System. These two meters are for the purpose of measuring the amounts of field gas used in the Refinery on which royalty deductions cannot be claimed# It should be noted that the calculations involved in these revisions and additiona have been made using coefficients given in the 'Orifice Meter Data Book' of this Company# Later chart coefficients have been used because of improved metering practice giving small refinements over those shown in the Royalty Manual* Presently the Royalty Manual is being revised to take advantage of the latest available information and revised issues will be soon forwarded to all interested parties.

Since this gas contains propane there was always the danger o a . times feeding liquid propane to the compressor engines. To elirairete this possibility, the gas produced in the Polymer Plant wil hence forth be routed to the Cracker Drip Tank and eventually to the Refinery 5(Wsystem through Meter R-2. No change is necessary to R-2 but in the future R-29 will be maintained merely as an indication of Polymer Plant production and should no longer be carried on o Royalty Gas Balance. (2) Metor R-18 - Since the 75#Engine Fuel Oaa System will no_ longer receive gas from the Polymer Plant, the system will draw its entire supply from the Producing Field line through R-38. This would make R -38 read off scale, hence the 10 range tube was rep ace with a 50' tube. A new data sheet is attached here-^o for 1.-30. (1) Meter R-28 - During the Aviation Project this meter measured Alkylation Plant gas to the 75#Engine Fuel System. Upon 19^9 start-up of this unit the gas produced in the Alkylation Plant vi be routed to the vent line to Cracker Drip Tank and thence ^through R-2 to the 50#Yard Fuel System. Since the gas will be metered eventually at R-2, this meter (R-28) will not be carried on tnft Royalty balance, but the data sheets are attached hereto merely to complete the record. r f rhntiaL B \ no A--^ .. czm.mPA - 847 -2- January 25th, 19^9 Please acknowledge receipt of these two data sheets in the space provided below, and return together with the two obsolete data sheets.

ROYALTY GAS METERING SYSTEM File 075.12 Dear Sir, ^ Several changes have recently been made in the Royalty Gas Metering System as follows The Royalty Gas Meter R-2 measuring 50/ Fuel Gas from the Cracker Drip Tank became very inaccurate and was removed from service. The meter, an old Foxborough, was found to be mechanically unsound and requiring extensive repair work. In view of this and the importance of the meter in computations of the Royalty Gas balance a Taylor instrument has been installed in its place. The orifice installation remains unchanged but the Taylor chart is a 0-10 Square Root which alters the meter factor from 11,000 to 110,000. A new data sheet is attached showing these changes. On meter R-37 measuring Field Gas Flow to the Cracker Drip Tank, the normal flow of gas when there is full gas production in Refinery Operating Plants, is very small (approx. 40,000 C.F.H.). On the present meter R-37 flows as high as 40,000 C,F.H # register at a low point on the chart and great difficulty is experienced in try ing to compute accurate production figures. An additional meter (R-37A) has been installed on the same orifice taps as R-37 but with a full scale flow of 155^300 C,F # H. This new meter will be used for Royalty Gas measurements on small flows whilst R^37 will measure the large flows of field gas consumption when the Refinery Production drops. A data sheet for R-37A is attached. Royalty Gas meter Rp-28 measuring gas production at the No # 4 Naphtha Stabilizer and Rerun unit has been causing some confusion since the readings are not required for the Royalty Balance, All gas passing through it to the Drip Tank is subsequently measured by R^2. In future R-28 will not be regarded as a Royalty Meter. The range tubes on both meter R-2 and meter R-37A have been sealed by the Government Representative.-2- PA-8A 3rd April, 19^9.

House gas engines is attached to a new orifice plate connections on the new fuel gas manifold* There has been no change on the meter nor in the orifice size, and no new data sheet will be issued* (3) The patent orifice meter flanges used on the meter instal lation at Rp-9 have been replaced by normal 300/ R,F # orifice flanges. The Robinson flanges had been leakingbadly and inaccurate readings on the meter seemed to indicate that the orifice plate was not seated correctly in the flanges. The orifice plate remains the same size and there is no change in the factor of the meter. A new data sheet is attached showing the change in the flanges. (4) The Foxboro meter R-6 has been suffering from mechanical defects and has been continually going off calibration* Due to lack of spares the meter could not be repaired to give sufficiently accurate readings and it has been replaced by a Taylor meter. This meter uses the same type of chart and there has been no change in the orifice size, but a new data sheet is attached showing changes in meter data. (5) Meter 1^25 measuring fuel gas to the Gas concentration Unit has been equipped with a larger orifice to take care of requirements when the F 4 G # C*U« starts up« A data sheet showing the change is attached. (6) Meter R-26 measuring fuel gas to the compressors has been equipped with a larger orifice to take care of the demand increased by four compressors for F # C«C # U # service.
